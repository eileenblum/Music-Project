[Ian, Frankie]

Unknown, ungrateful
Faces gliding through the blitz
We force you down,
Kneel at your death
Your mouth we fill with piss

[Chorus:]
Our orders are to murder and rape
Murder and rape
Murder and rape
Murder and rape

Hate's the cure

Hate is a fuel
Fuel for blood, pus, semen sprayed
Too late for you and the ones you lost
You shall forget all that you saw

[Chorus]
