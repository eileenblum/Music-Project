[Jory]

Infant-- starved to death
Rotted flesh-- aligns my crib

[Chorus:]
Redirect my fate
Only so much a man can take
Reconnect your corpse
Flesh and blood no more

Mother-- wretched whore
Betray-- my father's trust

[Chorus]

Innocence is relative
Marked for death,
Not to forgive
My flesh replaced with
Cold, frail glass
Life and death is relative

Father-- not himself
Must make-- the crying stop

[Chorus]
