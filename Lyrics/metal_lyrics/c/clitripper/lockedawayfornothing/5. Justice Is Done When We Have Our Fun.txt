[Ian]

Stranglers from deep inside
Lashing out you got nowhere
To hide
Metallic force, unsafe aggression
Raping all that's pure to
Somehow teach a lesson
What we've done in the past
We must have our fun
Life doesn't last
Justice is done
Justice is done
Justice is done
Justice is done when we have our fun
