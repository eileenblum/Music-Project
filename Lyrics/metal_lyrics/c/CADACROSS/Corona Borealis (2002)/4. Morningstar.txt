[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

Ages ago in a region far north
Their godly breath roared throughout the earth
Shaped the stones, built mountains high
Invoked forests verdant and oceans wide
Then made rapids to roar across the wild untamed
With blooming fields of gold woody lands he framed
Gave name to all those places that yet were without
Or at least that was what he thought
For there was a place that he did not know of

The fee with all its control
Sent down from heavens above
To expose the deed ancient days
The angels from heaven into hell
And I saw the beast rise out of the sea
And he stood on heads, black and hoofs
And here's what he said, "Today I'll burn you"

So he's never come to this before
There's a far bank over breaching the shore
He climbed up on the ranks with people flesh
"Well I just clear here and leave you burn"
And so the people dance upon today
And so I live; I've never fucked a fang
Swallowing winds I was suffering can comprise
Iâll reach around the port-holes with this guise

[Intermezzo]

And August is when the worlds hear to dream
Awake just farmer; his shadow in near
Colossal demon who shows no fear
Violence just kill on that autumn day
And the shadow is here to shelter, to slay us all

Their apocalypse has never been seen
For it, it is composed of high and low
This is not the worst possible diorama to paint the worlds of fear
In a river from the top deck, men saw storms forming north swallow
These violent judges, these noble beasts
The fire has claimed more

Majestic sight it must have been
When the griffin twins took on the wing
Faster than winds, streaking like hell
Seeking the one that disturbed their peaceful sleep
Their beating wings revive the dreaming fire
Now those flames burn forevermore
With sparkling claws they shatter the earth
And rape the dawning life
Underneath the blaze of Morningstar

So he's never come to this before
There's a far bank over breaching the shore
He climbed up on the ranks with people flesh
"Well I just clear here and leave you burn"
And so the people dance upon today
And so I live; I've never fucked a fang
Swallowing winds I was suffering can comprise
I'll reach around the port-holes with this guise
