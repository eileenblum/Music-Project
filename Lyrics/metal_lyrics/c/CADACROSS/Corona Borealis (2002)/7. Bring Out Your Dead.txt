[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

Letâs go!
The end is near, but have no fear
Take a vacation to pits of hell
First-class flight awaits you all
We fly to hell via twilight zone
The bell tolls noon, the bell tolls doom
So bring out your dead and bring your friends too
For we're all doomed, no turning back
Last day dawns black in the eastern sky

Never will you close your eyes from this!
Witness the lifeless gaze of the dead
Bodies that lie before your very eyes
Are they asking you to join?
Are they asking you to join?
So come on and bring out your dead

The end is near, but have no fear
Take a vacation to pits of hell
First-class flight awaits you all
We fly to hell via twilight zone
The bell tolls noon, the bell tolls doom
So bring out your dead and bring your friends too
For we're all doomed, no turning back
Last day dawns black in the eastern sky

Never will you close your eyes from this!
Witness the lifeless gaze of the dead
Bodies that lie before your very eyes
Are they asking you to join?
Are they asking you to join?

[Solo]

The end is near, but have no fear
Take a vacation to pits of hell
First-class flight awaits you all
We fly to hell via twilight zone
The bell tolls noon, the bell tolls doom
So bring out your dead and bring your friends too
For we're all doomed, no turning back
Last day dawns black in the eastern sky

Never will you close your eyes from this!
Witness the lifeless gaze of the dead
Bodies that lie before your very eyes
Are they asking you to join?
Are they asking you to join?
