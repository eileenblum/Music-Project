[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

Now shelter I must find from strong gale about to rise!
The northern lights delight me
Sets the darkened skies ablaze
As I slowly make my way over glade
To reach the firewoodâs rising gates

But savouring came the jaws of night
Swallowing all but moon and stars
Storm, it groped till raging blow
Impaling bare-clothed
Like dagger thrown by embittered foe

Beneath the flickering eyes of night
There under firewoodâs branch, he rests
In the cradle made by encrusted snow
Without a grief or care

The northern lights delight me
Sets the darkened skies ablaze
As I slowly make my way over glade
To reach the firewoodâs rising gates
The ice windâs cold breath forces me
To this fortress of ever trees
That offers me a place to rest
Den for me and the beasts as well
Oh Fortuna thou hath abandoned me!

Who could see through the veil of night?
Could hear the fainting call of the desperate one
When the storm rages on and on
And once again it strikes forth with
Such a furious howling blow
No mercy given for the lost
Who is seeking a way out from
This horrid maze of ice and snow

Under the stars may moon guide your way
But cold North winds will blow eternally
Under the stars, beneath blazing skies
You were forced to leave from where forest remains

Out from the darkness just like that
A swelling light became
Now chanting for the traveller
Whose road became to its end

The northern lights delight thee
Sets the darkened skies ablaze
As you slowly make your way over glade
To reach the firewoodâs rising gates
Savouring come the jaws of night
Swallows all but moon and stars
Storm it gropes till raging blow
Impaling the one who tries
To conquer the forest's throne
Beneath the stars may moon guide your way
But cold North winds will blow eternally

Beneath the flickering eyes of night
There under firewoodâs branch, he rests
In the cradle made by encrusted snow
Without a grief or care
