[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

From where the eye can see beyond miles
From the top of mountain high
I found it shining on the ground
Blood-red like dragonâs tear it was
The second by placing spoon on a stump
From magpies nest I obtained
What a beauty met my eyes
Where silver in daylight sparked

From where great rivers run down by the ocean
Where winds weep and waves forever sing
From there I found the third, on a reef
Like blazing fire it was
Burning like a lively golden flame

Where the treetops reach out to the blue sky
In the deep woods, where no man-made pathways go
From there the fourth-one I did find
From inside the trunk of great pine tree
On a mossy bed scarlet glow and I went on

Where goblins once used to live
Long before our days
At the end of cavern deep and dark
I found it, grey as a dragons scale
For you my sweetest wolverine I force a wreath of seven stars
So that in the times of darkness it reminds us
Of the glory of our days

[Solo]

From where the eye can see beyond miles
From the top of mountain high
I found it shining on the ground
Blood-red like dragonâs tear it was
The second by placing spoon on a stump
From magpies nest I obtained
What a beauty met my eyes
Where silver in daylight sparked

From where great rivers run down by the ocean
Where winds weep and waves forever sing
From there I found the third, on a reef
Like blazing fire it was
burning like a lively golden flame

Beyond the horizon where crimson sun sets
We will sail to our haven afar
If winds favour and the storms let us go free
With sails of silver, with helm of gold
Towards the cosmic seas we sail
The wreath will guide our way
Descending glory of our days
