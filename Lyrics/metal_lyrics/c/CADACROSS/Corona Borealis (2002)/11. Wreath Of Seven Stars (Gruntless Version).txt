[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

From where the eye can see beyond miles
From the top of mountain high
I found it shining on the ground
Blood-red like dragonâs tear it was
The second by placing spoon on a stump
From magpies nest I obtained
What a beauty met my eyes
While silver in daylight sparked

Where great rivers run down to the ocean
Where winds weep and waves forever sing
From there I found the third, on a reef
Like a blazing fire it was
Burning like a lovely golden flame

Where goblins once used to live
Long before our days
At the end of cavern deep and dark
I found it, grey as a dragons scale
For you my sweetest wolverine I force wreath of seven stars
So that in the times of darkness
It reminds us of the glory of our days

[Solo]

From where the eye can see beyond miles
From the top of mountain high
I found it shining on the ground
Blood-red like dragonâs tear it was
The second by placing spoon on a stump
From magpies nest I obtained
What a beauty met my eyes
While silver in daylight sparked

Where great rivers run down to the ocean
Where winds weep and waves forever sing
From there I found the third, on a reef
Like a blazing fire it was
Burning like a lovely golden flame

Beyond the horizon where crimson sun sets
We will sail to our haven afar
If winds favour and the storms let us go free
With sails of silver, with helm of gold
Towards the cosmic seas we sail
The wreath will guide our way
Descending glory of our days
