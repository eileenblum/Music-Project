[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

Whence will I find the passion once lost?
May it rise with strength to burn
Away these synthetic sins of mine
Away those days by gone

For my demons never rest down here
Where morbid dreams form reality
I don't know who you are nor where you come from
I only know of who I am and when my shape is shifting
For I have learned the dark
And its never-ending quest
Down here I never rest
Down here in my gloomy depths
Where morbid dreams form my reality
They would never let me slip away

Spirit keep what my flesh cannot
I still bleed red
No memories, no breath
Torn apart I will drift till death

Spirit keep what my flesh cannot
I still bleed red
No memories, no breath
Torn apart I will drift till death
All these faceless creations
They seem to grope along the way
Leper guides for us to lead astray
To be lost and how to find the way

Days of torture and redeeming pain
Lies ahead, will I stand or am I to fall?
Everything here forced to sustain
For my demons never rest down here
With nails I masturbate my deepest wounds
And ages most profound came to me

Whence will I find the passion once lost
May it rise with strength to burn
Away these synthetic sins of mine
Away those days by gone

For my demons never rest down here
Where morbid dreams form reality
I don't know who you are nor where you come from
I only know of who I am and when my shape is shifting
For I have learned the dark
And its never-ending quest
Down here I never rest
Down here in my gloomy depths
Where morbid dreams form my reality
They would never let me slip away

Days of torture and redeeming pain
Lies ahead, will I stand or am I to fall?
Everything here forced to sustain
For my demons never rest down here
With nails I masturbate my deepest wounds
And ages most profound came to me
