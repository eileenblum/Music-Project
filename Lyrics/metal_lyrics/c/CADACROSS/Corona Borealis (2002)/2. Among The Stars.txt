[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

Don't you want to see how it ends?
Gaze the comets that scrape the sky
Close eyes and make a wish
Don't you pray for the stars to fall?
Eternally burning chaotic brightness
Further from our galaxy
Where ignorance meets king fear
They came

Descent from heavens on to the earth
Destructive angel horde
Bring sorrow for tomorrow
Summon endless agony
For wounded we are on our crusade
To a lost paradise
Oh' how my heart yearns back
To shores of ever dark

Chariots of fire flew
Downwards from heavens blue
Over lands, lakes, over mountains high
Dashed Faethon on his way

Thousand stars burn in the night
Blazing glory ride on the final day
At last as one, we can be united
None better, none less
As we merge with the stars
Thousand stars burn in the night
Blazing glory ride on the final day
At last as one

Don't you want to see how it ends?
Gaze the comets that scrape the sky
Close eyes and make a wish
Don't you pray for the stars to fall?
Eternally burning chaotic brightness
Further from our galaxy
Where ignorance meets king fear
They came

Descent from heavens on to the earth
Destructive angel horde
Bring sorrow for tomorrow
Summon endless agony
For wounded we are on our crusade
To a paradise, my sons
Oh how my heart yearns back
To shores of ever dark

Thousand stars burn in the night
Blazing glory ride on the final day
At last as one, we can be united
None better, none less
As we merge with the stars
Thousand stars burn in the night
Blazing glory ride on the final day
Thousand stars burn in the night
Blazing glory ride on the final day
At last as one
