[Music: Georg Laakso, Lyrics: Sami Aarnio]

Still I yearn to see chaos and calm in harmony
Arcana that lies beyond the dream of ever blazing skies
And the night fell black upon the ones who yet
Blinded still wander in the mysteries of life
In blood are the murdererâs hands once again
As I hold you, my child, for the very last time
Though I'm crushed by grief, there is no other way
I shall burn it all remains, just let it slip away

I am the Flaming ember
Flood of never-ending pain
Rise my sons now from the flames
Now! Now!
Release Hell

Come new life like old once did
Weed out the weak now from our way
With your wisdom guide our way
Burning down the walls of the ever blazing skies

Before this earth from dusk was drawn
When gods were sleeping, I was born
Son of chaos and mother whore
Tempter strong yet without form
Come new life like old once did
Weed out the weak now from our way
?
Come new life like old once did
Weed out the weak now from our way
Leave their bodies to be eaten
By the beasts that haunt at night

[Solo]

Through your eyes I see this enraptured disharmony
Arcana that is never solved by the one tangled in dreams
And the night fell black upon the ones who yet
Blinded still wander and refuse to see the truth
In blood are the murdererâs hands once again
As I hold you, my child, for the very last time
Though I'm crushed by grief there is no other way
Tattoos in my soul displays the fall of heaven's dome

I am the Flaming ember
Flood of never-ending pain
Rise my sons now from the flames
Now! Now!
Release Hell
