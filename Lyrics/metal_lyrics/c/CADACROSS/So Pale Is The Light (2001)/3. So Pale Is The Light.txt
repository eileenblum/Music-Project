[Verse:]
So pale is the light before the dawn
I was standing alone beneath the cross
Veil of the bride, bride of the night
Witnessed weakness of the cross

Bewitched by the beauty of the night
Shadows of the cross in my mind
Promises of god of eternal life
Was broken like them always was.

[Chorus:]
So thin is the line
Between the truth and lies
Can I face the truth
Without any doubts

"So thin is the line, between the truth and lies
Can I face the truth, without any doubts
It'll begin where it ends this lifetime hell of mine
I suffered whole my miserable life, under the soulless skies
A dim black flame is burning inside of me"

Dreams have failed me all my life
No truth was found no lies are lost
Those hidden words in my mind
No more lies now I must to live
No more lies now I must to live

So thin is the line
Between the truth and lies
Can I face the truth
Without any doubts

Boundaries of darkness were closing in,
My blood suddenly ceased
I saw the beast came up beyond the skies,
Like storm it rise up from the flames

[Verse]

[Chorus]
