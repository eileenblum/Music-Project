Morning star has come, darkness reaching the earth
Battles have begun, cold breed of death was all around
Rays of dead sun, swept through the battle ground
Men cry out their pain, cold breeze of death was all around

They were lying on the ground
Fallen to the dust
Rotting to the ground
In the battle of north

Promises of God those lies of paradise
They were still all alone in this night of agony
They cry out for their god, they cry out for their creator
They were lying on the ground waiting for their destiny

In the night of the glorious sun
All alone in a cold bleak of darkness
Wonder why their god has failed them
Hatred passion is torturing them

They swore by their blood that they hate the Christ
By their hearts 'til their end will come
In this night of the glorious sun
All of my faith and beliefs will be gone

Promises of God those lies of paradise
They were still all alone in this night of agony
They cry out for their god, they cry out for their creator
They were lying on the ground waiting for their destiny

They were lying on the ground
Fallen to the dust
Rotting to the ground
In the battle of north
