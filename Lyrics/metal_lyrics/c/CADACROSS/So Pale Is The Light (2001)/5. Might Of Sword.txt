[Verse:]
In morning of mourning men gathered to the fields
March of the death lead this savage race
With might of the sword they slaughtered enemies
Dawn of this cruel day, I see the raging flames arise,
From the deepest hell. Like thunder the warlords were thrusting
With their sword. Cold steel turned to red with blood of enemies.
In morning of mourning war blood turned to cold

[Chorus:]
I saw warriors in the battle fields
Thrusting swords into soft flesh
Spilled blood turned fields to red
Empty graves filled up with the warriors
Warriors
I can hear how cold steel sank to flesh
I can hear last breath of these brave warriors
Dreams of war have become true
Like the hell was landed to the earth
Bleeding corpses were lying on the ground
Smell of burning flesh flown everywhere
In the air

[2nd Chorus:]
With rage, they fought their battles
With rage, they gave no mercy
With pain, with pain they fell to a frozen ground

With rage, they fought their battles
With rage, they gave no mercy

With rage, they fought their battles
With rage, they gave no mercy
With pain, with pain they fell to a frozen ground

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
