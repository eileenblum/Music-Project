In twilight I stand beneath the raving skies
I can feel the strength of thunder, in my veins
Blood on my hands, I reach for the skies
With grief and the sorrow I shouted to the skies

[Chorus:]
Take me my lord
Let me be the servant of eternal flames

"Lord, blind my eyes to these visions and deaf my ears to these screams.
I have seen legions of God's army fall and heard dying cries of a thousand angels"

I soared through my past, with wings of imagination
I saw my life drift away, like it has been a dream
Now I am standing here to face my fate and begin my eternity
Cursed by this madness, I started my trip to hell.

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
