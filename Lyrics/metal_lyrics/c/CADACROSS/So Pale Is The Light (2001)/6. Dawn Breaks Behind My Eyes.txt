[Verse:]
Dawn breaks behind my eyes
Light revealed a shape
Shape from deep in my eyes
This beast I saw in my dream
This beast has drained my strength
Chained me like a slave
I have lost this battle
Battle of my soul

[Chorus:]
Beyond my grave, I face my eternity
Beyond my grave, I grief for thousand years
Beyond my grave, I face my eternity
Beyond my grave, I grief for thousand years

[Verse]

[Chorus]
