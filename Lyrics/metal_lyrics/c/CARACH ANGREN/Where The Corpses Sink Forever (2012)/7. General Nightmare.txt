Staring, screaming "Bring my map!" with clenched fists. "Colonel, Attaquez l'Allemagne!" "Tous nos hommes, sans aucun remords!" This storm of sacrifice will reign!

I have conquered! "Murdered!" I am your leader! "No! You slaughtered us all!" DÃ©serteurs! "We'll infest your nightmares with our pain!"

General Nightmare!

He dreamt the horrors of the ones condemned to death; screaming women, children... TourmentÃ©s, brÃ»lÃ©s, violÃ©s, tuÃ©s!

Woken from delirium (by) the stench of burning flesh. Wading through an ocean of blood and tears still fresh.

"Suis-je fou? Mais je reste puissant! Je m'en fous de la populace!"

ATTACK!

Trembling, raging "Bring my map" with clenched fists. "My orders: Attack! Attack!" "Tous nos hommes, sans aucun remords!" This storm of sacrifice will reign!

General Nightmare!

He dreamt the horrors of the ones condemned to death; screaming women, children... TourmentÃ©s, brÃ»lÃ©s, tuÃ©s!

He dreamt the horrors of the ones condemned to death; screaming women, children... TourmentÃ©s, pour l'Ã©ternitÃ©!
