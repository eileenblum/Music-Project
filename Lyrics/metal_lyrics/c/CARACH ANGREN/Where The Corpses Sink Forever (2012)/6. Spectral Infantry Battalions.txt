Battle formations, dead but still wandering ahead. A gigantic apparition keeps rising from a field, once colored red from bloodshed.

Where the sounds of war can still be heard and the balance of nature is seriously disturbed.

Spectral infantry battalions marching through a freezing timeless void. Again, ghostly cavalry regiments shall ride the lands they'd once destroyed.

Battle formations, fog-like infantry battalions. Battle formations marching unto an endless destination.

This is the sound of death;
(Death) a military haunting!
(Death) Battle formations,
(Death) still marching ahead!
(Death) Battle formations Death Death Death!!!
