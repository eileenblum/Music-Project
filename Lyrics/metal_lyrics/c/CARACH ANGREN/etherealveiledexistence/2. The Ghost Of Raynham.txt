Norfolk is cursed for the dead left a trace.
There a grand mansion was marked as unhallowed
place. Obscure sightings were frequently seen,
wandering dim hallways with an unearthly gleam.

Strange querimonious laughter at night. Probably
the consequence of ignoring heavenly light. Somehow
a sad spectral reality...
kept reflecting the presence of a shade called the brown lady.

I shall guide us through it's arcane past.
It was a time of romance and wine, before the (vis) count
Townshend, found out about his wife.
High was the price. Her indidelity would be severely punished for life,
Locked behind the walls at Raynham hall's apartments.
There's where she remained, driven insane until death came.
It was a shame,
"Unfaithful salacious whore... you will never get away!"
That's why Dorithy died.
After being held in this antiquated prison for life.
Sickness was the reason of her mysterious death..., was said.
Though many have told she'd broke her heart... then her neck!

Over the years dark tales have appeared of a shade in a brown brocade dress.
It was the ghost of the brown lady, still seeking for ethereal rest.
