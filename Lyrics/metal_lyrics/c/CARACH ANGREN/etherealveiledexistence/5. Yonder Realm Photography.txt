Two photographers were on assignment for a known magazine.
They approached the accursed hall.
Unaware of the ghost that... still dwells within.

They were assigned to profile. Raynham's structure.
Focusing on adequate exposures.
There hung a mystic sphere.
Emotions of unexplainable fear made them clear they'd rather disappear.
For this old house gave them weird conjectures.
As if something dark come near.

Misty form roams through the night.
Torturous soul astrayed from light.
Portraits of dead entities.
Yonder realm photography.

Gazing with fear up the staircase.
A ghostly shape a rose before their eyes.
Quick!... There is something strange.
Click!... Was the sound that the flashlight pistol and the camera made.
They developed a picture that showed a morbid image... apparently of the brown lady.
