This storm, lightning, fierce winds and monstrous waves.
A demonic tempest. My men complainingâ¦
I command! We set sail!

"I beg you, my captain! Christ has forbidden to set sail on Easter Sunday!"

âWhat?! Your God!? May he suffocate! May he rot!â

Â Kept the bible close to me. His book of lies I shall now cast into the sea.

"This is blasphemy!"

âYour hold your tongue or Iâll rip it out and have you hanged for mutiny!â

"No! You cannot send us into madness! We shall not obey."

With my knife I slowly penetrate his tender throat. I curse in rage:

"Godverdomme! Wij zullen varen, al betekent het mijn dood!"
