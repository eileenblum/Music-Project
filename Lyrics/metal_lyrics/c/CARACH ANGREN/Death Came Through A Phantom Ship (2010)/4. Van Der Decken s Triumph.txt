"Weigh the anchor and hoist the sails!
Work harder you drunken snails!
For treasury like pepper as gold.
Let this nautical voyage begin.
We are powered by strong European winds."

The triumph of The United Dutch East-India Company.

We run a monopoly: spice trade, violence and slavery
"Full speed ahead!"
He's hollering as if he's mad.
This ship is captained by a successful psychopath.

Fearless... No conscience...
The infamous captain Van Der Decken.

So obsessed to be the best. Nothing less. A crude master yet staunch, refusing to back away from any kind of tumult. For mace, nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. For silk, porcelain, ivory and opium. Victoriously sails the VOC!

Through the foulest gales, along dangerous reefs and treacherous bays.
Respect and obedience.
Under his command they felt challenged but safe.
Determination and greed is what he felt.
Possessed and focused on profit and wealth.

"Weigh the anchor and hoist the sails!
Work harder you drunken snails!
For treasury like pepper as gold.
Let this nautical voyage begin.
We are powered by strong European winds."

"Bring me the rum
To celebrate the fortunes to come.
Let us sing and drink on a rich and glorious time.
For we shall succeed just like this harmonious rhyme."
