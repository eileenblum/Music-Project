Ouija, are you there?
Ouija, are you there?
Is there a presence among us?

Oui... ja, oui... ja

Dark is the memory I set out to forget
We used an oracle board to contact the dead
Young, bored and impatient we asked the name of the entity
The glass suddenly moved spelling out "Charlie"

Why are you here?
What do you want?

"Protect you."

How do you wish to protect me?
Charlie, are you a member of the family?

"No, I am a friend."

Fun and excitement turned into fear and disbelief
It gave answers to questions no soul knows but me
We moved the glass planchette to say our goodbye
It moved the pointer to "No" so we asked Charlie "Why"

From that moment the atmosphere began to change
Kind answers became evasive, dark and strange
Threatening the spirit: Leave, in the name of the Lord!
Bone-chilling messages came forth from the talking board

"Bitch! Slut! Whore! Cunt!
Go fuck your God! Fuck your God!"
D-I-E spelled out repeatedly
It threatened my family with death

The glass shattered
Releasing a scent of decay
We failed to perform a portal-closing spell
Panicked, we ran away

Charlie
Something is watching me
Charlie
It's a shadow
Charlie
It is following me

Why are you here?
What do you want?

"Destroy you!"

Charlie wants to kill me
Charlie is not a friend
