Pitch-black box
Death unlocks
Consume us all
Feed on our souls

A black cursed casket
Carved from wood, by the devil's hand
Filled with relics
Left by the dead, this box is damned

"Thou shalt not open"
Engraved in blood above the lock
Yet countless mortals
Have heard the dead, from inside, knock

Pitch-black box
Death unlocks
Consume us all
Feed on our souls

I thrust the skeletal key inside
Turn six times left, then three times right
Oh pitch black box, show me what you hide
And grant me the treasures from beyond the light

Pitch-black box
Death unlocks
Consume us all
Feed on our souls

Pitch-black box
Death unlocks
Kill them all
Feed on their souls
