A blackness comes forth, thick clouds from the North
A serene cemetery atmosphere
Transforms into one of melancholy and drear

The wretched remaining seek shelter ahead
Huddled together, shedding tears for the dead
And âmidst the silence before that storm
The beginning of this peculiar tale is born

Ravished by infernal winds, hail and rain
A storm surge generated by a deadly hurricane
Caskets plucked like feathers and swept into the sea
Into a maritime eternity

Charles Francis Coghlan, born in Paris, 1842
A remarkable actor awaiting his breakthrough
Charles Francis Coghlan moved from Ireland to the United States of America
His charisma would put a spell on you
Talented, handsome and eccentric
A rising star... reaching far

Rough waves carrying caskets towards another destiny
And most of them sink into the cold blackness of the sea
Yet one coffin keeps floating steadily

Charles Francis Coghlan, rising star, reaching far...
Charles Francis Coghlan, rising star, reaching far... in death

Breath-taking was his play, expressing joy, fear, sorrow and rage
He collapsed to the floor
And when his applause died down, he truly died on stage
Charles was no more

Day and night dancing and swaying along with the tide
Crushing rogue waves pounding the box of death until itâs out of Sight
Until there's no more light

Corroded by maritime salts
Submerged into the oceanâs cold
Sinking away from the circling sharks
Pulled down into the dark

Charles Francis Coffin - rising star, reaching far
Charles Francis Coffin - rising star, reaching far... in death
Charles Francis Coghlan - rising star... reaching far.
Charles Francis Coghlan - rising star... reaching far in death

Taken by the wave from its Texan grave
Coghlanâs coffin drifted like a ghost along the American coast
Until 7 years later, after the storm had abated
The casket was found washed ashore on Canadian ground
We are artists for life until the last drop has been shed
And true artists will always perform until their very last breath
Even within the cold and timeless theatres of death
