Hatred's occultation
causing harm upon their relation
No amour tomorrow
when love shall be consumed by sorrow, sorrow!

In olden days these kind of acts were a shameful disgrace
Maybe the price of jealousy and hate sealed her malicious fate
One night the village was awakened by agonizing screams
Her castle burned like the sceneries in Hell
She suffered like a pig
Oh god, I love this tale to tell!

Whorish desire sentenced with the punishment of fire
Repulsive temptress in white prepare to die
And kiss thy pale, warm skin goodbye

HÃ¶r mir zu!
Dein Fleisch ist in meiner welt verboten
Du solst tanzen im Schattenreich, dem Land der Toten

In Dunkelheit..
In Finsternis und Einsamkeit..
In Finsternis.. in Dunkelheit..

Whorish desire sentenced
with the punishment of fire
Unfaithful mistress in white
where is your pride?
Accept your faith in twilight

In Dunkelheit..
In Finsternis und Einsamkeit..
In Grausamkeit und Finsternis..
Im Schattenreich..
