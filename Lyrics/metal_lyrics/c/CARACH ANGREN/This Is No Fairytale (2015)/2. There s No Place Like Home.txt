Once upon a time
there stood a house of ill fame
a drug property associated with violence and crime
there lived a family in despair,
sorrow and tragedy
father was a drinker and a goddamn fiend
a sadistic motherfucker who could not keep his hands off his own kin
his soul was meant for the devil
it was rotten from within...
After all these years of sin.
Mother was a skeleton whore,
fucked up on heroin wine and pills
whatever she could score
more more more!
Her black circled eyes were simply empty
her body was bruised and scarred
oh,life was hard!
And if her sick alcoholic husband had a temper
he would beat up his wife.
One time he took a knife and stabbed her twice.
No! Not deep enough-for she survived!
Once their marriage,
an enchantment of love and trust.
Hopes and dreams became nightmares of shame,
abuse and disgust,
assault,assault!
Domestic violence!
Family battery!
Rape,violence,violence,violence,violence!
Assault,assault!
Abuse,abuse,domestic violence!
Assault,assault!
Once upon a time
they were blessed with two children
a boy and a girl
now by the age of twelve and nine
traumatized and neglected
in a household of blood
tears and wine!
One night,father became a completely insane
the children awoke by a horrible tumult
from downstairs,sounds of screaming,breaking glass and the throwing of chairs
but the children fell asleep again
and the girl had a disturbing dream:
A stifling feeling of a hand covering her mouth,
a smell of alcohol all around.
She doesn't understand and cannot defend herself.
When will this suffocating dream end?
Finally! She is able to breathe,but when her bastard father shut the door
behind him she realized:
This nightmare was no dream! No dream! NO DREAM!
