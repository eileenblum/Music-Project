Supreme power leads the way
Ghost King holds the Book of Life and Death
Supreme power leads the way
With his pen in hand, he takes away their breath

Evil tyrant smiles covered by the dust
Blazing cannons light the sky
Bloodthirsty legions unholy lust
By chilling wind their flags will fly

Supreme power leads the way
His heart was black with every sinner's pain
Supreme power leads the way
Those names were carved when injustice reigned

Evil tyrant smiles covered by the dust
Blazing cannons light the sky
Bloodthirsty legions unholy lust
By chilling wind their flags will fly

Upon the Mirror million corpses fall,
souls of bitterness filled the halls
Guards and ghost troops dread in hell,
deadly ambiance putrid smell
No day no night not even twilight
Ghost King laughs as hell resides
Tsing-guam, young medium behold,
traverse the Underworld alone

In the Book of Life and Death
Their names are all condemned
