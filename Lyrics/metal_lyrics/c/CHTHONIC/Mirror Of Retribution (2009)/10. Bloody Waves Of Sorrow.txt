Waxing, waning
The moons transform with the greatest of ease
Now there is nothing left but misery
They sealed their destiny

Demon bulls, toxic hornets
Hungry wolves and filthy rats
Hell's creatures thronged to Hong-do
They joined the final combat

Break out, massive attacks
Knocked down, no going back

Waxing, waning
The moons transform with the greatest of ease
Now there is nothing left but misery
They sealed their destiny

Through six eyes on his charred black face
Guan-yim, his wrath released
Ten Ghost Kings see everything
Their fury won't be ceased

Break out, massive attacks
Knocked down, no going back

Defeated
He fell into the infernal ocean of blood
The shores fill up with corpses
An abnormal morbid flood

Louder and louder;
He hears the cries of his people that died
Over and over;
He feels their pain as red waves collide

He hears their cries
Red waves collide

Still flaming
The infernal nine suns of the damned
Rise up to the sky
They burn with a nuclear hatred
Destroying his hope and scorching his eyes

Louder and louder;
He hears the cries of his people that died
Over and over;
He feels their pain as red waves collide

He hears their cries
Red waves collide

He hears their cries
Red waves collide
