Limited vision, limited union
Unlimited division, unlimited illusion
Limited freedom, limited right
Unlimited island, unlimited fight

Our hearts are pounding with a heavy beat
The rights of millions lay at your feet
A society marching needs true justice
A world like this needs true union

Limited vision, limited union
Unlimited division, unlimited illusion
Limited freedom, limited right
Unlimited island, unlimited fight

We have the land, the strength, the power
Rise up, overcome, take it over
Ignored too long, we became stronger
Tear down the walls and let us run over

Limited vision, limited union
Unlimited division, unlimited illusion
Limited freedom, limited right
Unlimited island, unlimited fight
Limited freedom
