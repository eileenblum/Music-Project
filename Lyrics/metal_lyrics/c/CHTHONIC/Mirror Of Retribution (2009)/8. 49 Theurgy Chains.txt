He made it through the Festering Iceberg
Now he shakes for something else
Unrelieved burden, unrelieved anger, unrelieved hermetic theurgy chains
Unrelieved trauma, unrelieved terror, unrelieved hermetic theurgy chains
He broke right through the courts of hell to erase the names where Ghost Kings dwell
His soul was sucked back by the spells that night they came
Wizards lashing their flaming reins
Sanctioned forty-nine theurgy chains
Tie me in chaos, bind me in pain,
Sanctioned forty-nine theurgy chains
He made it through the Bleeding Volcano
Now hes burned by something else
Unrelieved torture, unrelieved sorrow, unrelieved hermetic theurgy chains
Unrelieved hatred, unrelieved malice, unrelieved hermetic theurgy chains
He broke right through the courts of hell to erase the names where Ghost Kings dwell
His soul was sucked back by the spells that night they came
Wizards lashing their flaming reins
Sanctioned forty-nine theurgy chains
Tie me in chaos, bind me in pain,
Sanctioned forty-nine theurgy chains
The tyrants genocide
Drives me to suicide
The tyrants genocide
Drives me to suicide
