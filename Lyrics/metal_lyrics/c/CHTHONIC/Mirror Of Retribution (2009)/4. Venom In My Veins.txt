Beyond the River of quicksand
with ghost troops underground
the pounding drums of hatred
unholy evil sound

Venom starts to boil inside my veins
As tortured distant screams drive me insane
Venom start to boil inside my veins
We will have revenge and rise again

Monsters tread with bloody hooves on rocky roads to nowhere.
They penetrate the freezing cold with poison breath.
Demon bulls, Ghost king possessed, when dark red eyes start to stare.
Rotting flesh ripped from their bones, death virus spreads.

Ghost troops scattered
Wicked beast attacked
Tsing's power shattered
Wicked beasts were hacked

Monsters tread with bloody hooves on rocky roads to nowhere.
They penetrate the freezing cold with poison breath.
Demon bulls, Ghost king possessed, when dark red eyes start to stare.
Rotting flesh ripped from their bones, death virus spreads.

Venom starts to boil inside my veins
As tortured distant screams drive me insane
Venom start to boil inside my veins
We will have revenge and rise again

Venom starts to boil inside my veins
