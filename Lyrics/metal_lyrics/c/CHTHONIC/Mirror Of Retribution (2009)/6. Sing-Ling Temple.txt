Lightening strikes upon sing-ling temple tonight
Brutal tyrant's soldiers killing with delight

Oo-gu-lam is filled with blood and filth
Ghostly smoke outlines the bodies killed

Lightening strikes upon sing-ling temple tonight
Brutal tyrant's soldiers killing with delight

For hundreds of years they were slaves to their fear
The tyrants have come to make life disappear
Tsing-guan has the power to bring them all back
But the spirits are planning a vicious attack

Tears fall from the guardian lion
Tears of freedom, tears of a nation
Tears fall from the guardian lion
Tears of freedom, tears of a nation

Spirits dance upon Sing-ling Temple tonight
Led by evil wizards under the moonlight

Oo-gu-lam's engulfed in burning flames
The island's sky will never be the same

Spirits chant upon Sing-ling Temple tonight
Led by evil wizards under the moonlight

The temple is covered by the potent seals of hell
Tsing-guan's power is tied up by the spells
The tyrants have won but they've only just begun
Terror was born by the pale white sun
