Bloody mirror of retribution, evil spirits bound
Countless souls in the underworld there's no way out
They Trade their sins for the frigid wind and a carving sound

Blades call for native enmity
Burning Liberty refined
Blades call for native enmity
Building ethnic soul with pride
Set your fear aside
Iron trees and a mountain of knives

Hatred Blades, venom thorns
Tongue-ripped phantoms face the Ghost King rampage

Bloody mirror of retribution, evil spirits rage
Countless souls in the underworld cry out in flames
They scream in vain from Injustice Reign, their fate is all the same

Blades call for native enmity
Burning Liberty refined
Blades call for native enmity
Building ethnic soul with pride
Set your fear aside
Iron trees and a mountain of knives

Hatred Blades, venom thorns
Tongue-ripped phantoms face the Ghost King rampage

Unchangeable evil machine, unthinkable evil they dream
Unchangeable evil machine, unthinkable evil they dream

Blades call for native enmity
Burning Liberty refined
Blades call for native enmity
Building ethnic soul with pride
Set your fear aside
Iron trees and a mountain of knives

Hatred Blades, venom thorns
Tongue-ripped phantoms face the Ghost King rampage
