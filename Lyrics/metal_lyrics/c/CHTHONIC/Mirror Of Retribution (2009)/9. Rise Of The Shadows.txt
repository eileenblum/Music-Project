Axes swinging, tridents crashing
The demons are born from their furious smashing
Spirits steaming, corpses braising
The monsters will feed when the fires are blazing

The Eternal Wheel of Reincarnation is cracked by a soul and spinning in vain
On the Mirror of Retribution, shadows of the intruder rise again

Axes swinging, tridents crashing
The demons are born from their furious smashing
Spirits steaming, corpses braising
The monsters will feed when the fires are blazing

On the Mirror of Retribution
Shadows of the intruder rise again

Across the Oblivion, through Hot Suffocation
The Final Punishment is his destination

His retaliation would bring satisfaction
A flagrant violation of hell domination
Across the Oblivion, through Hot Suffocation
The Final Punishment is his destination

Transform the Goddess into Charred Face Ghost King
Guan Yim, the most brutal of all
Tsing-guan is weak and broken down from all the suffering
Deeper into Hong-do he falls

The march of ghost troops, the drums of hate

The march of ghost troops, the drums of hate
Deep down in Hong-do, ten Ghost Kings await
