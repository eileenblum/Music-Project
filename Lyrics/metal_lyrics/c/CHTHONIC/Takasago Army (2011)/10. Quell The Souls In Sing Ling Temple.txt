Fire and ice - attack as one unite
Light and dark - courage and strength, we fight
Ying and yang - chaos entwined in spite
Steel and blood - all are in same tonight
Across the o-gu-lam gather
The temple lights asunder
Demon creatures crawl upon the banks
Horrific wonder
Now overflowing in fire
The burning oil flows
Statues of the divine
Start to melt and decompose
Fire and ice - attack as one unite
Light and dark - courage and strength, we fight
Ying and yang - chaos entwined in spite
Steel and blood - all are in same tonight
Piece by piece pillars crash
Drop by drop the tears fall
Brick by brick sealed in hell
At their side shield them all
In your name we fall
Blood red sun set, a new dawn arise
Survived the harshest fight
Now find my demise
All that will be, entrusted now to you
From once again coming true
Temple is covered by potent seals of hell
Tsing-guan's power is tied up by the spells
Blood on my face, the proudest mark of all

Death awaits us all
Empire's head will fall
Death awaits us all
Empire's head will fall
