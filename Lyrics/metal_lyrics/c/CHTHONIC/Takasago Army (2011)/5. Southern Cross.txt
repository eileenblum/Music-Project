Under the southern cross
I am just a stranger in a strange land
Shadow beneath the stars
Though i have seen this cross
I am just a whisper in the strange land
Endless waves of souls fill eternity's mass grave
So numb to the slaughter, wave after wave
Under endless skies
Shadows stalk the land
Draw the demons out
Last night beneath the cross
I will be forever in this strange land
Shadow beneath the stars
Once more beneath the cross
Never comes my last night in this strange land
A lone shadow, within no fear of death
The last battle, behold the final death
Bottomless blood pit killing without thought
Victims are calling, destiny is wrought
Under endless skies
Shadows stalk the land
Draw the demons out
I see the southern cross
Now that i am rooted to this strange land
Shadow beneath the stars
Fading, the southern cross
I am but a shadow in this strange land
A lone shadow, within no fear of death
The last battle, behold the final death
