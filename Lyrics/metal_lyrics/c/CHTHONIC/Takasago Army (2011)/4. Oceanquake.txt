The demon clouds rise in the sky
Hear savage solders  battle cry
As sacred blood flows through our veins
We are immortal, feel no pain
The motherland has called us here
Killing machines who have no fear
Our flash and blood upon the earth
Called to this destiny from birth

Silence, brings insanity
Darkness, sweet depravity
Nature, surrounding
Movements, confounding

Deathly winds falling
Gods of war calling

No steel will find me
Death moves too slowly
Silent mystery
Deathly winds falling

Gods of war calling
Gods of war keep them from crawling

In the smoke hear the blades fly
Souls join and as one arise
