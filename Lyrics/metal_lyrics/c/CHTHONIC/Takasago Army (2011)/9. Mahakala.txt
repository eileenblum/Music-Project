Mahakala calls to you
Souls are burning, power coursing through
Bloodlust once consumed us
Banished it to the deep
The beast now has left us
In smoky mountains sleep
The demon rise again
Never will peace be found
A tyrant's madness rules
From the gods not a sound
We shed blood in the past
The instinct now awaken
Our will never outlast
Our land not forsaken
There's no way past
Dormant awaken
There's no way past
Dormant awaken
Will not outlast
Never forsaken
Mahakala calls to you
Souls are burning, power coursing through
Deadly white Sun
Blocks out the sky
The demon rise again
Never will peace abound
A tyrant's madness rules
The gods cannot be found
Ingrained in my eyes
Crimson of foes and I
Ocean of blood below
Machetes in the sky
Mahakala calls to you
Souls are burning, power coursing through
Mahakala calls to you
Guide my will
