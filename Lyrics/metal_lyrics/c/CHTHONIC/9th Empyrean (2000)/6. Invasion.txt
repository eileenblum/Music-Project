rode with gloomy wind and magical clouds
soldiers equipped with devine weapons
marched to waste land.

the headquater of sina ordered four armies
the leaders put armies into battle array
all minds were the same one
light to win the final war
everyone got excited to kill

rode with gloomy wind and magical clouds
soldiers equipped with devine weapons
marched to waste land.

the land once occupied came to their eyes
there was millions soldiers defenced on the border.
the sina leaders exployed their troops
used the strategy for attack
sea moved and waves whirled into sky

"all troopers of sina gods, follow me!!the envory will be your vanguard!defeat them!march into frontier for revenge!

before attack,there was only slience suddenly rocks blew up to sky
earth shook,mountain collapsed river flooded thunder rolled all mortal gathered.

kill tore tranquillity shock the isle
as armies marched,barrier turned into crimson
the sina gods
had the dream of dominion
fought fot harass againist isle's gods
to disguise their ambitions

isle gods resisted in the barrier
gods killed each other,bloof spilled over
all isle gods decided
to kill enemy for guard
