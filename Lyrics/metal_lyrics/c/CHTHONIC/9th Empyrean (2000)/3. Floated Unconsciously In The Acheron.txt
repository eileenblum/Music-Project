Breeze blew, Dust Spread
Shady mist flew sky was covered in gray
acheron flow through, deep as abyss
in the inferno, only silence remained

as thunder struck, the sky broke
suddenly millions of dead souls fell
into acheron and made big waves
struggled hardly all in the acheron floated

in memories of light, there's a flash of swords
where dit it ho wrong? my heart broke
scare why could i remember nothing?
my life had slipped away i had unclear injustices

Cold wind chilled me from skin into bone
across the water, my soul melted into acheron
surrounded by acheron, my body floated
in the acheron all dead soul flowed
stink spread all over dead gods seemed alive
my heart ached with anxieties
looked the acheron where did it flow?
floated the acheron where did i go?

Change,crack,collapse,tremble,shadow shock,riot
scare,still,twist,chaos,shake,vague,fight
in memories of fight there's a flash of swords
where did it go wrong? my heart broke
scare why could i remember nothing?
my life had slipped away i had unclear injusties

Cold wind chilled me from deep into bone [Taiwanese part]
Across the water, my soul melted into acheron [Taiwanese part]
Surrounded by acheron my body floated [Taiwanese part]
in the acheron all dead soul flowed [Taiwanese part]
stink spread all over,dead gods seems alive
[Taiwanese Part]
my heart ached with anxieties [Taiwanese part]
Looked the acheron where did it flow?? [Taiwanese part]
Floated in the acheron where did it go??

Sign,war,shadow,kill,lance,cut,destroy
Stare,quite,cease,fear,flame,end,fall

Memories of past light came to me
in the last battle,there's so many died
i can hardly recall and fell so rage
looked around and wanted to fight

All hatred remained although i was deceased
i could not escape from the tide of acheron
acheron called more deeper my soul sunk
my soul could not struggled out of the acheron

acheron's calling me....
