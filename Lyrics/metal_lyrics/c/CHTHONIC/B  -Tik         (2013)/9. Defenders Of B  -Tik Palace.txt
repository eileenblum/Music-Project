Walls collapsing all around
Heads high face our own demise
Bolts of lightning strike the ground
Demons of the mind excise
Gunfire sounds the first attack
Brothers in arms to the end
Putrid bodies on their backs
Sacred symbols will defend

Who now stands before me like a ghost within a dream? (Within a dream)
When did come the day when things became not what they seem? (Not what they seem)
Outside of this palace where my loyalties to lie (Where do they lie?)
For the gods or demons with but one I choose to die

Bridges crashing to the ground
Heads high watch them as they fall
Tremble at the thunderous sound
Hear the siren's final call
Cannons ripping us to shreds
Brothers, where have you all gone?
Demons collecting the dead
Spirit's final breath is drawn

Who now stands before me like a ghost within a dream? (Within a dream)
When did come the day when things became not what they seem? (Not what they seem)
Outside of this palace where my loyalties to lie (Where do they lie?)
For the gods or demons with but one I choose to die (I choose to die)

Ghosts that I see, haunting my dreams
Surrounding me, what to believe?
Sunset decries, nightfall's demise

Mirror's reflection is blinding I cannot see
Timeless sentence
Sounds of the shackles grow louder, insanity
Timeless sentence
Timeless sentence
Timeless sentence
Timeless sentence
Timeless sentence

War of the ages, the violence returns
Immortal warriors escape from the urn
Hundreds of years and we pledge hundreds more
Infinite hatred for those at our door
