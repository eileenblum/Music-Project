Poso Kofuni's woods witness
Countless ca'davers in tragic WuShe autumn
Toppling in-to River Acheron
Float away from rived memories
Death comes! Battle rages on
No doubts in warriors' heart
The end immaterial, All
hearts set on honor once more
Poso Kofuni's woods bends with
Desiccated corpses in dark WuShe autumn
Slides in-to River Acheron
Relinquishing their mortal hold
Forth ward! Cowardly Surrendering
Far from their hearts and minds
The end immaterial, All
hearts set on honor once more
Hbalaw Khoni yahen su na megena ga emnu
To war! The end approaches
Fate tied to justice regained
Flags fly, beckoning the worthy
Souls to Rainbow bridge
