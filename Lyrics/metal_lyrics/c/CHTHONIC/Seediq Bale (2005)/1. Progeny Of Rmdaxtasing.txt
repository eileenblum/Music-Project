Sacred Mountain of White,
Spiritual habitat, birthplace of all
Where Great Father Tree towers
beacons for lightning, the catalyst for life.
Emanates

Sprung from Vast Grove, gestated by Sacred Rock
A million generations' hope, Chiliad gods applaud
Benah su babaw Khoni. Wu hai su musa genga
Emrax bi sejeg. A-na Bidax gnuwan
E-na menehx haya ga Nenugenna na

Sacred Mountain of White,
Spiritual habitat, birthplace of all
Where Great Father Tree towers
beacons for lightning, the catalyst for life.
Avalanche of rock, shattering, splintering
Shapes the inauguration of the Warrior
Bedesan ga glax su, gina duwa beoda gaya Utex.
Bedesan ga glax su, gina duwa beoda gaya Utex.

Birth prophesized, destined for sublimity
The Seal is broken, the way is laid cleared, Mona comes
