Winter years, four centuries
Ceaseless foreign invasion
Sukuladan, ever still mighty
Rivers weep unceasingly
Alien rule exacts hefty
Tribute, scar-pits Motherlands
Lineages of honor-marked faces
Fade like wilting cherry blossoms recite
Fog wounds, surrounds serrated peaks
crowning the axis of the Motherlands
Nigh sky, the Mountains tru sons
Seediq, scattered petals on wind
Winter, years, four centuries
Ceaseless foreign invasion
Sukulada, ever still mighty
Weeps for despoiled forests

Bunohon Mountains endured centuries of pillage
Patterned faces blanch under suffering, consumed by
impotence in defending the Holy Land, evanesce
Bunohon Mountains endured centuries of pillage
Patterned faces blanch under suffering, consumed by
impotence in defending the Holy Land, evanesce
Paso Kofuni Great Woods,
ancient advice hangs ragged amidst outgrowth
Seediq spirit, downtrodden slaves under the Red Sun Empire

Valor makrs evaporate in
smoke, extinction nears
