Clans destroyed, and broken,
Motherland ravaged
Survivors hunted to the last
Painful history recast
Exiled misery
War-lust unquenced, spew forth much ire
Victorious army gloats and plunders
Tragic history recurs
Fractured Homeland

Battle hath consumed the warriors
Those left behind merely flesh shells
Chuan Isle, new home of the banished
Ancestors wait for the laggard souls
