hathor and anubis have
awaked
their cold breath is
spreading
in the valley of kings a
slight breath
of disquiet the death is
near

a glaem of light falls in the
darkness
who dares to distrub the peace of the
godlike king?

eyes which hardly accustomed to the
darkness
see what for thousands years only could be
seen by ra's eyes

they desecrate the peace of
tut-ench-amun
blinded by gold and precious
stones
and only concerned about their
own glory
no-one observes the inscription on
the wall
that promises misfortune

for those who despise amon-rÃ© and
his son...!

hathor and anubis have
awaked
their cold breath is
spreading
in the valley of kings a
slight
breath of disquiet the death
is near
the lord of the sun don't know any
mercy...!
