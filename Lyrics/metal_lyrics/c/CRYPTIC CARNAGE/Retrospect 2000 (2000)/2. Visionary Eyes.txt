when comes the time
where a new age begins
and where religions are
meaningless?
when comes the time
where we live in harmony with mother
earth?

a man from salon
known as michel de
notredame
had visions even in his
childhood
the course of history was known
to him
but he couldn`t tell it
anyone
the lord of lilly won`t
trust him
in a gilded cage he will die
soon
but he didn`t wanted to know about
this thread
and so fate was
fulfiled
in a cruel way

see how the old sun
falls
use the time and solve the
mystery
will rule eternal
darkness
or will rise a new sun?

Those which we`ve lost 2000 years
ago?

coded hidden burned and
misunderstood
