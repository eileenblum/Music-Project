A young aristocrat came to
Paris
To marriage Margot the King`s
Sister
(But his Religion wasn't the religion
of the Valois)

This wedding meant new hope

After too many wars
Which didn't gave this land any
peace

Thousands came to the
capital
To celebrate this wedding of
peace
Thousands didn't knew their
destiny
They only came to die

Which is the true
religion?
One nation devided
A wedding should bring peace between
the religions
But the night of St.
Bartholomew
Destroyed every hope
Une mort terrible au nom du mÃªme
dieu
