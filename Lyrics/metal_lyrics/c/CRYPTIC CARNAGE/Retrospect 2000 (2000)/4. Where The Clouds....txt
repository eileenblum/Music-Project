A scientist drifts in his boat the
silent river down
He follows the waters
current
(The flow which defrauds him...)

The monotony of whistling
chuckling
and singing  Voices is tiring
out of man
And suddenly - a rolling
thunder
First still in distance but soon a
increasing loudness
thunder - Like from a storm of
nature
breaks the still around, still
around...!

closer and closer comes the
risk....
Now return or approach to the
shores
It's urgent - the time runs
against him

Where the rainbow raises in the
unknown....
Where a river flows into the
lowlands....
Where the water darts in steep bows into
the deep....
Where gigantic veils of thigt
haze rise....
And the elements build a
unit!
On this place there are living
the gods,
and there the clouds will be born
in water....!
