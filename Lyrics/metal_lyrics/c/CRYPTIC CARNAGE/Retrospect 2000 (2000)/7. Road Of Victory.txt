Legendary and fairytale

Conquest and exploratory
urge
After eight years ? the

My lord...! He gained all
Asia

He wanted to proclaim the hellenic
empire
The Greek united his army

But it was never
realized
He died by disease and left

To discover and conquest

To march along into the

They devoted themselve to their

And marched along into the
