Put in chaines the poor girl suffered
And the duke creates his plans
He send Franziskus the old Monk,
So she would learn about her fate

[Monk:] "The lord`s not master of his temper
He will kill your father, kill your man
Give in, I plead you, or he`ll make it true!"
[Girl:] "Oh, Franziskus, I can`t do it
Been so happy but it faded
I love my father
I love my man
I will be faithful, whatever will come!"

Beeing told her decision
[The lord explodes:] "She lived to die, now it will be!"
