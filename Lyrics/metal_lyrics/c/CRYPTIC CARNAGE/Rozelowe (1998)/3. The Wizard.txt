At the court of the duke
There lives an old magican
Who tries to heal his master
In every way he can

He looks into his masters heart
Foreseeing his love with a woman

A dream is haunting him every year
Of a young child and a white woman
The vision of a terrified face

At the court of the duke
There lives an old magican
Who tries to heal his master
In every way he can

Promising misfortune
With bloody judgement
Worried about the master`s face
He advises him on avoiding
ROZELOWE...
