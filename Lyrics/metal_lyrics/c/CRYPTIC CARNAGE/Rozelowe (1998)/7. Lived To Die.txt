Anonymous and all in black
His right-tightly holding the axe
The axe-inevitable for the work
The executioner is waiting silently

They lived to die so bitterly!
[Duke:] "So end her father`s live now
and leave her pleading for hers own!"
[Girl:] "Master, still you never get
what someone else has already  won!"

They lived to die so bitterly!
[Duke:] "Be quiet now it is enough!
My rage is only growing
Proceed-and kill her lover

Again the shadow moves...
