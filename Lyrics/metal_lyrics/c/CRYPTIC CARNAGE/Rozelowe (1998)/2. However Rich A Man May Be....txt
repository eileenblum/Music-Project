ItÂ´s springtime and close to june
Forest and country are fresh and green
For duke and mistress-ready for hunt
Await for the trek of the duke

The call of wild of redeer and of swine
It entice the lord to stay here
It entice the baliffs daughter too
A girl-just a gracious wife
He starts to loving her-after all the time

However rich a man may be
He has eyes but still can`t see
What there is to come tomorrow
And what the future holds for him
All his money will not be
A guide through life for him

From all parts of his land-peasants arriveed
To bait the wild for their duke
They hunt with spears with arrows and
with dogs
Each lord of the duke`s land-
they let it know
The duke calls up-for coming on

However rich a man may be
He has eyes but still can`t see
What there is to come tomorrow
And what the future holds for him
All his money will not be
A guide through life for him
