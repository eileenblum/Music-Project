A river cuts the land in half
Each side of it equally beautiful
Willows and oaks, rough and old
They still hold the voices of birds

A touch of green revives the nature
And the sun brings back all living
Spring has finally come
Overhelming one with pleasure

Seems as if the trees try to tell
The stories they heared long ago
Nothing has changed in 800 years
Listen carefully for this is true...
