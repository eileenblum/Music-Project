The confidence that you portray,
It turns to grey it pulls me down,
The picture perfect painting fades,
My doubt holds my heart to the ground.

It doesn't matter what I say.
I found a letter that night, I wrote it in my sleep,
I can still feel you here beside me, it read
Dear if you're reading this,
Dear if you're reading.

You stand over me as I sleep,
Your hands cover my eyes so that I cannot see your eyes,
You'll be there when I wake up the snow it surrounds me.
I can't wake up and you're here,

Your hands cover my mouth so that I cannot breathe,
Your breath is the cold that I feel in the air,
You're the seasons the reason that I've lost all feeling this year.

I wish that I'd wished you away.
