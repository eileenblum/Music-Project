Now hope seems so far away,
Am I the coward you became?
I am hollow and it shows,
And I swear that I'm not coming home.

Distance fills the space between,
Our fingers used to fit so perfect,
But I have cuts on my hands,
And I don't want to remember you as you are now to me.

I can only hope, and swear that I'm not coming home.

The feel, of the water reminds me,
Your tears don't taste of salt.
Your bitter soul.
The fear in your eyes is blinding,
It cuts through the cracks in your soul.

I waited, just in case you walked by,
I could have caught your eye, that evening.
The snow, the snow fell hard that day,
But I couldn't care if I tried, I wont forget that.

I won't, forget...

I swear that its so, I pray that I don't make it home,
I swear that I wont make it home, I won't forget that.
