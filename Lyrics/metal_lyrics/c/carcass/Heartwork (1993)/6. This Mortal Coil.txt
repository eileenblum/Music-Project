Tearing down the walls
Breaching frontiers, unlocking the gates
To a new world order
A fresh balance of terror, the equilibrium of hate

Archaic nescience unleashed
Entrenched, a bitter legacy
Tempered in mental scars
All flesh entwined in mortal equality

Tangled mortal coil

[1st lead: Steer]
[2nd lead: Amott]

Twisted and warped
Tangled mortal coil

Tangled mortal coil

Tearing down the walls
Breaching frontiers, unlocking the gates
To a new world order
All flesh entwined, in the equality of pain

Twisted and warped
Tangled mortal coil
