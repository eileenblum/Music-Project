A grim myriad, a grey kaleidoscope, sterile, contrasting
Born and die, institutionalised, a bleak epitaph, an apalogue so sad

Cross indexed, cross dissected
Cross referenced, contabescence
Cross indexed, cross bisected
Cross referenced, certificate of death/certified dead

Machine coded, reduced to hard memory, in a data base
Digitalised, statistical obituary, your only legacy, your final resting place

[1st lead - Steer]
[2nd lead - Amott]

Bill Steer: lead guitar;
Ken Owen: drums;
Jeff Walker: bass and vocals;
Michael Amott: lead guitar.

Thanks to Benjamin.L.Ahlin for correcting track #6 lyrics.
