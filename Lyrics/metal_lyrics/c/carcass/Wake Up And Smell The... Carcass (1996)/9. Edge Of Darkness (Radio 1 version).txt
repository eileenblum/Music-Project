[Music: Steer]
[Lyrics: Walker]

A rising, bleak dawn
A blackened sunset,
On the human condition
A boot perpetually treads.

Illumination snuffed
A long shadow cast
Time is a mirror
Condemning to repeat the past

Endtime
The realms of a setting sun
Twilight
A new age has begun
Decline
Decension to a new dark age
End time
An old world not quite so brave

Right on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Right on the edge,

...on the edge of darkness

A fading dusk
Empty, blanketing shade
A dying sun
Only darkness radiates

An aeon ends,
A millenium overturned,
Time lies in embers,
As barren horizons burn
End time
The realms of a setting sun
Twilight
A new age has begun
Decline
Decension to a new dark age
End time
An old world not quite so brave

Right on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Right on the edge,

...on the edge of darkness

[leads]

Endtime
The realms of a setting sun
Twilight
A new age has begun
Decline
Decension to a new dark age
End time
An old world not quite so brave

Back on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Back on the edge...

[lead]

Back on the edge,
Of a new dark age,
Right on the edge.
