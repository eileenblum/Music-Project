[Walker/Steer]

YEAH, CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE,
IT WILL ONLY END IN TEARS, EYE FOR AN EYE,
FOR AN EYE,
IF BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP,
THEN THANKFULLY I AM BLIND,
CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE,

CROSS MY HEART, COME CROSS THE LINE,
WON'T YOU BE MINE, MY BLOODY VALENTINE?
PUT ME ON A PEDESTAL, I'LL PUT YOU ON A SLAB !!!!!
CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE,
COME, LET'S CROSS THE LINE,
THERE'S A FINE LINE, BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE,
LET'S TEAR IT APART,

CROSS MY HEART, AND HOPE TO DIE,
CROSS MY HEART, COME LET'S CROSS THE LINE,

TIME IS NO GREAT HEALER, QUICKLY THE SENSES NUMB,
COME CROSS MY HEART, VOID AND NULL,
LOVE IS A WEAKNESS, LUST CONQUERS ALL,
CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE,
WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE?

THERE'S A FINE LINE, BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE,
LET'S TEAR IT IN TWO,

CROSS MY HEART, AND HOPE TO DIE,
CROSS MY HEART, COME LET'S CROSS THE LINE,

LET'S TEAR IT APART.
