[Walker/Steer/Regadas]

DON'T WANT YOUR NUMBER,
DON'T WANT YOUR NAME,
DON'T WANT YOUR COLOUR...
DON'T WANT YOUR POLITICS,
DON'T WANT YOUR CAUSE,
DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE,
DON'T WANT TO WEAR YOUR EMBLEM
DON'T WANT YOUR CULT OR SECT,
DON'T WANT YOUR FAITH,
DON'T WANT YOUR RESPECT,
DON'T WANT YOUR LOVE,
DON'T WANT YOUR PRAISE,
DON'T WANT YOUR STUPID FASHION,
DON'T WANT YOUR PHASE,

POLARISED - TELL ME WHAT COLOURS DO YOU WEAR?
YOUR BELIEFS, POLARISED,
I JUST DON'T CARE FOR WHAT YOU CARE.

I JUST DON'T CARE FOR WHAT YOU CARE.
