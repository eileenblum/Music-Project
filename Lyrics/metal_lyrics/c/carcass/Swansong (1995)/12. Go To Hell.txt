[Walker]

SOME PEOPLE AREN'T CUT OUT TO BE SAINTS,
AND SINCE I WAS BORN IN ORIGINAL SIN,
HEDONISM HAS A CERTAIN ATTRACTION,
I THINK I'LL CUT THE CRAP, CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN,

AND GO TO HELL,
I'VE SOLD MY SOUL, SO WHEN MY BODY GOES COLD,
I'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL,
GO TO HELL,
WON'T YOU BE TOLD?
I'VE SOLD MY SOUL,
GO STRAIGHT TO HELL

YOUR PARADISE DOESN'T SOUND TOO FETCHING,
IT'S NOT ONLY YOUR SOULS WHICH MUST BE LOST,
"HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE",
YEAH, TOO RIGHT, MY HELL IS YOU,

THE SINS OF THE FLESH SOUND SO APPEALING,
SO LET ME WALLOW IN MY GUILT,
YOUR HELL WILL BE MY HEAVEN,
SO LET'S TURN UP THE HEAT, LET ETERNITY BEGIN,

AND GO TO HELL,
I'VE SOLD MY SOUL, SO WHEN MY BODY GOES COLD,
I'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL,
C'MON,
LET'S GO TO HELL,
WON'T YOU BE TOLD?
I'VE SOLD MY SOUL,
GO STRAIGHT TO HELL,

LET'S BURN IN THE FLAMES, YEAH!!!!
