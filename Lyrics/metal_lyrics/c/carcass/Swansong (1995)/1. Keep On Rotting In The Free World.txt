THE THREADS OF GLOBAL FABRIC ARE UNITED,
THE ROLE OF THE WESTERN FREE WORLD IS IN DECLINE,
STILL FREE TO CONSUME, FREE TO BREATHE,
FREE TO EXIST, FREE TO DREAM, YOUR LIFE OF DREAMS,

KEEP ON ROTTING, KEEP ON ROTTING, KEEP ON HOPING, DREAMING, ONE DAY MAYBE,
KEEP ON ROTTING, KEEP ON HOPING, WHILST IN THE REAL WORLD YOU...

CONSUMER OR CONSUMED, YOUR LIFE IS CHEAP,
ECONOMIC SALVATION IN SWEATSHOPS RETURNED FROM THE EAST,
DESPAIR THE ONLY QUALITY OF STRIFE,
A REASON FOR EXISTENCE IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE PRICE,
IF YOUR PRICE IS RIGHT,

KEEP ON ROTTING, KEEP ON HOPING, KEEP ON DREAMING, ONE DAY MAYBE,
KEEP ON ROTTING, KEEP ON HOPING, KEEP ON DREAMING,
WHILST IN THE REAL WORLD YOU...
KEEP ON ROTTING, KEEP ON HOPING, KEEP ON DREAMING, ONE DAY MAYBE,
KEEP ON ROTTING, KEEP ON HOPING, KEEP ON DREAMING,
WHILST IN THE REAL WORLD YOU...
...ROT!!!!!
