[Walker/Steer]

YOUR KINGDOM IS OF EMPTINESS,
INVISIBLE EMPIRE OF ILLUSION,
THERE'S NO MAJESTY IN YOUR EMPTY WORDS,
YOUR IDEOLOGY - SELF DELUSION,
REVISIONISM IS THE FUTURE,
SO LET'S HAIL THE SAME OLD DAWN,
KNEEL BEFORE THE SAME OLD ORDER,
YOU'RE NO KINGS - ONLY PAWNS,

YOU'RE WAITING FOR TOMORROW, WELL TOMORROW NEVER COMES,
HA, YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR NEW DAWN, SO SAD TO SAY THERE ISN'T ONE,
BECAUSE, (YOU FOOLS) TOMORROW BELONGS TO NOBODY,

TOMORROW - BELONGS TO NOBODY
