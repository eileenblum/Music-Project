The rotting corpse lies on a mortuary slab
Pus starts to burst from each visceral scab
Body temperature drops, bone seizure takes place
As the discharge oozes from the boils on the face

Suppurated - Pyosisified
Pustulated - Soggy insides

The cataleptic remains incite the suppuration
Giving way to the stench of anal emanation
This repulsive concoction drips onto the floor
Cleansing the viscous enzymes of the body's inner core
