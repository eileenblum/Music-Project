Your pulverized torso languishes in its pool of pus
Minced, cancerous viscera - gore seeps from the guts
My fetid fetish is to excavate the moulding rot
I drool my gastric juices as I chomp on you blood-clots

Fermenting innards, bubbling with rot
Alcoholic pus, dissolves the wooden box

I gouge into the chest's cavity to rip out the intestines
Slivering soft entrails to release the foaming secretions
I suck up the concoction and eat the decay
With cankered disgorgement I excrete my gurgling prey

Bile, chyme and blood in the offal effervesce
I eviscerate the bowels and drink the clotted cess
