Oozing chyme reeks as your duodenum is hacked
Secreting gastric juices, enzymes melt your faecal tract
Torn major arteries, your corpse with blood is drenched
Your mouth is ripped inside-out as your oesophagus is wrenched

Maggots and grubs bore into the mouldy remains
Masticating lymph, caked blood and cankered decay
Maturating brains play host to the grisly fete
Stuffed anal passage, served on a plate

Purulent torso is a perfect maggots meal
Spilt cerebrospinal fluid is sucked up with zeal
Botulism vitiates the emulsifying bile
Liquidized gall bladder, viscid pus smells vile
