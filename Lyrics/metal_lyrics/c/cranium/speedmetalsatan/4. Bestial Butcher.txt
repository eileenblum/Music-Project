A bestial butcher in the city tonight
He's killing with chainsaw and axe
Stalking the streets of this night without light
The butcher's leaving no tracks
Suddenly a scream cuts through the haze
Flesh, eyes, tongue, hands fly in the air
His shadow appears, death is a moment away
You shit your pants you're so scared

Bestial butcher, hacking and slashing
Raping with chainsaw and salt
Shit, blood, brains, piss into the air
The bestial butcher beware!

In his home a collection of heads
The bodies are piled on the floor
He's raping the bodies and kissing the heads
And for dinner there's plenty of gore
Once again he's waiting in the night
Young woman walking alone
Two things are heard, the scream of the fright
Then the roar as the chainsaw is on
She's screaming for mercy but there's none to be had
Violent rape with a chainsaw
He doesn't hear because he is mad
In his mind only onslaught
Possessed by blood and burning hate
When you see his face in the window

Try to run but it's too late
Your wife is soon a widow
Thrashing, killing, raping, slaying
Rotten flesh on the ground
The bodies in his house are slowly decaying
And he's never found

Bestial butcher, hacking and slashing
Raping with chainsaw and salt
Shit, blood, brains, piss into the air
The bestial butcher beware!

Next time you're walking the streets in the dark
Remember, this is a warning
Your flesh is soft and the chainsaw is sharp
You won't live to see the morning

Bestial Butcher [x4]
