Jesus Christ-son of a whore
Nailed on the cross, but you'll suffer more
Christianity-a false belief
No heaven above just hell beneath
Lucifer the glorious king
Ruling forever in fire and blood
Satan!-his glory we sing
Roaring in hate as he's raping your god!

Jesus is raped by the forces of Satan
Dressed up in leather and spikes and chains
Even Satan plays speed metal
Evil riffs in the fires of hell
Diabolical drums, the troops on the march
Attack from below with bombing bass
Chainsaw guitars, evil metal
Malicious vocals, the voice of hell!

Crushing the skies-with a mighty sound
Evil noise in the universe
Raped by demons-dressed in leather
Satanic art, eternal curse
Once again-we take the stage
Music from hell kills the christian scum
Releasing the power-unholy rage
We cut you down as you try to run!

Jesus is raped by the forces of Satan
Dressed up in leather and spikes and chains
Even Satan plays speed metal
Evil riffs in the fires of hell
Diabolical drums, the troops on the march
Attack from below with bombing bass
Chainsaw guitars, evil metal
Malicious vocals, the voice of hell!

Raped by demons-you try to resist!
Raped by demons-noise in your ears!
Raped by demons-fucked with a spiked fist!
Raped by demons-impaled on a spear!
Raped by demons-dressed in leather!
Raped by demons-bitches of Christ!
Raped by demons-armageddon!
Raped by demons-and antichrist!

Jesus is raped by the forces of Satan
Dressed up in leather and spikes and chains
Even Satan plays speed metal
Evil riffs in the fires of hell
Diabolical drums, the troops on the march
Attack from below with bombing bass
Chainsaw guitars, evil metal
Malicious vocals, the voice of hell!
