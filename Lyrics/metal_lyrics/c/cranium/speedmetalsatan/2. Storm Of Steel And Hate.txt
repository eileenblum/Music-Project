Like a ramrod made of steel
Like a grinding metal wheel
All the power that we feel
Transformed to a storm of steel
Messengers of war we are
We fly across the sky
With hammer like precision
We let our arrows fly
The fleeing masses run before us
Panic in their eyes
Our mission not complete
Until the last one dies
Like a roaring tornado
Like a raising crescendo
This sound louder than thunder
Leaves our enemies rent asunder!!!

We storm the gates of God!!!
And piss in angel blood!!!

Evil demons ride from hell
Raping angels in our way
Demons forge in Satan's spell
We ride on armageddon day!

Storm of steel and hate [x4]

We ride the storm of steel and hate
New masters of the earth
Steel and flesh grotesquely mate
This is Lucifer's rebirth
Evil demons ride from hell
Raping angels in our way
Demons forge in Satan's spell
We ride on armageddon day!

Storm of steel and hate [x4]
