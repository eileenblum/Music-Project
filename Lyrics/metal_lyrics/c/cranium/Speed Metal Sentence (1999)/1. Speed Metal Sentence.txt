Necro-Nudist walks the floor
Decapitating the last whore
Through a sea of beer and gore
We make our way towards the door

But now we are surrounded
The cops await with guns
It seems that there is nowhere we can run
We're facing rabid dogs
And choppers in the air
Now we are chained and dragged by our hair
Now we are thrown in jail
You guessed it, there's no bail
They lock us up in tons of heavy chains
Now we are behind bars
(There is no drinking bar)
And we are living now on numbered days

[Chorus:]
Speed metal sentence! Sentence of death!
Speed metal sentence! Sentenced for life!
[2x]

Now they give us each a ball and chain
Attempts at escape are all in vain
But we know that we will get away
Put our faith in Satan, to him we pray
Speed metal's gonna break the wall
Speed metal will be their downfall
Speed metal against your disco
Replace Spice Girls with Michael Kiske!

Now we await the demons
And soon they will appear
The sound of evil wings will fill the air
By diabolic force
We're gonna crush the wall
And once again we will stand proud and tall
We know we will return
And you are gonna burn
Somehow there will be fuckin' tables turned
We draw the pentagram
Prepare the final slam
And with satanic strength the wall we ram!

[Repeat Chorus]

By diabolic force
We're gonna crush the wall
And once again we will stand proud and tall
We know we will return
And you are gonna burn
Somehow there will be fuckin' tables turned!

Sentence of death! Speed metal sentence!
Sentenced for life! Speed metal sentence!
Sentence, sentence, sentence [6x]
Speed metal sentence!
Sentence, sentence, sentence [6x]
Speed metal sentence, speed metal sentence
SPEED METAL SENTENCE!
