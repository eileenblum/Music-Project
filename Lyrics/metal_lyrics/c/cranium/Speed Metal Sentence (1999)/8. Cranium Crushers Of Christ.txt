[Verse I:]
Up from hell we ride tonight
The Christians shall die!
Demons forged in evil fire
Nowhere you can hide!

[Bridge:]
Evil satanic force
Will permeate the night
Metallic Satan hordes
We will put out the light!

[Chorus:]
We crush, we slay
This is the judgement day!
In blood, and fire
We pile the corpses higher!
From hell, we strike
Impale you all on spikes!
Now Christ, and God
Are trampled in the mud!

[Verse II:]
Up from hell we ride tonight
The Christians must die!
Demons fill the steaming air
The world will not be spared!

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

Attack on the left flank!
Storm the church!!!!
Yeah, kill the Christians!!!!

[Finale:]
We are Cranium - crushers of Christ!
And we will torture you, when you have died!
This is rebellion - we kill the earth!
And now we celebrate - Satan's rebirth!

REPEAT FINALE UNTIL SATAN'S VICTORY IS ENSURED!!!!
