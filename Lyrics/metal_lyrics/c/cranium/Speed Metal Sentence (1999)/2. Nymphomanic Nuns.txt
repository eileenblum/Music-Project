[Verse I:]
Necro-Nudist is my name, I ride my metal bike
Dressed in leather, studs and chains
And long satanic spikes
I suffer breakdown on the road
I got to get some help
Come upon a monastery and I ring the bell

[Verse II:]
They open up, I go inside and soon I realize
This is a nunnery and now my dick will rise
This dirty drummer's dick is what I think
They will all need
I line them up against the wall
And fuck them till they bleed

[Bridge:]
Yes I will desecrate
When I ejaculate
The nuns are all insane
I bring them lust and pain
You fuckin' Christian whores
Get down upon the floor
They like to suck and lick
My heavy Kaufmann stick

[Verse III:]
I take them on the altar underneath the holy cross
One by one I penetrate, virginity is lost
Satan watches from below, I leve the nuns defiled
Crazy orgy, ecstacy, now heaven is defied

[Repeat Bridge]

[Chorus:]
My dick is like a loaded gun
It's time to fuck some nuns
Fuck you with an inverted cross
Now you know who's the boss
This dirty drummer's Kaufmann stick
Is what they all will need
I line them up agains the wall
And fuck them till they bleed

[Bridge II:]
I'm Necro-Nudist and I am the one
My Kaufmann stick is like a loaded gun
I'm Necro-Nudist, I am Satan's son
I desecrate and penetrate the nuns

[Repeat Bridge II]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse IV:]
Now I leave the monastery, the nuns are satisfied
They want me to come back again
I promise that I will
Another day I will return on my bike I ride
I'm coming back to penetrate
More Christian cunts to fill!
