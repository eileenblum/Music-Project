Uh, this is Grave Raper!
I'm back in the graveyard!
Midnight has come again...

Midnight strikes, I'm back again!
Time to find another stiff
Satan in my soul again
In my head satanic riffs!

That's right! I'm evil!
My soul is dark like pitch!
That's right! Hail Satan!
I dig for another bitch!

My former mistress broke up with me
Scattered pieces of human debris
Now I'm digging for another whore
Rotten and filled with stinking gore!

That's right! Satanic!
I am the bass player!
That's right! Diabolic!
I am the Grave Raper!

[Chorus:]
Full moon fistbanger!
Under the moon I work!
Full moon fistbanger!
In the graveyard shadows I lurk!
Skeleton! Brings hard-on!
I bang my fist to the moon!
She's stiff! I'm stiff!
Making love inside the tomb!

Earth and stone surround us
As I revel in your pus
And now her stomach bursts
I'm sorry, hope it didn't hurt!

That's right! I'm evil!
My soul is black like pitch!
That's right! Hail Satan!
This is just another bitch!

The cross is upside down
Hell has come to your town
No one is ever safe
Not even in the grave!

That's right! Satanic!
I am the bass player!
That's right! Diabolic!
I am the Grave Raper!

[Repeat Chorus]

Every night I fuck the dead
While you sleep in your bed
Nocturnal desecration
Satanic stimulation!

That's right! Satanic!
I am the bass player!
That's right! Diabolic!
I am the Grave Raper!

Full moon fistbanger!
I bang my fist to the moon!
Full moon fistbanger!
Making love inside the tomb!
