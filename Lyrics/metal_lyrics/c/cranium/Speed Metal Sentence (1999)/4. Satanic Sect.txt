[Verse I:]
Cult of the damned
Outside of town
The old abandoned house
A place you all avoid

[Bridge I:]
Inside those bloodstained walls
Inside these torture halls
Demons here, Satan is here
In dark satanic rites
Children are sacrificed
They cry in fear, no one will hear

[Verse II:]
Now you're brought forth
From the cellar
You shake in mindless fear
And then you see the spear
We will impale
Take you to hell
Satan awaits you there
Where fire fills the air

[Bridge II:]
Black candles burning bright
Made out of human hide
They smell like hell, now sound the knell
The bell is the signal
You're placed upon the altar
In nomine Satana, in nomine Satana

[Chorus I:]
Satan, Lucifer
Come to us tonight
Unto the lord of darkness, we sacrifice
Satan, Beelzebub
Against the Nazarene
Decapitation, by guillotine

[Verse III:]
The Mayor in town
Is the high priest
He controls the police
Even they worship the beast
No one must know
Where they all go
The ones who disappear
Just never reappear

[Repeat Bridge II]

[Chorus II:]
Satan, Lucifer
Come to us tonight
Unto the lord of darkness, we sacrifice
Satan, Beelzebub
Now come forth
Now he is here, can you hear his roar?

We conjure, the fire
The flames are burning higher
We summon, the demons
In rage and hate they're screaming

[Repeat Chorus I]

We conjure, the fire
The flames are burning higher
We summon, the demons
In rage and hate they're screaming
REPEAT UNTIL SATAN APPEARS!!!
