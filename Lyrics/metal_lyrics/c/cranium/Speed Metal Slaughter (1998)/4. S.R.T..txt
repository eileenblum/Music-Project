Fire burns, in the town
But don't you worry, we'll soon be around

We're not an ordinary rescue team
We don't care about your horrible screams
(Oh, help us, help, oh!)
Our tank is filled with fuckin' gasoline!
We're Satan's servants, you will see

[CHORUS:]
Satanic Rescue Team
Instead of water we bring gasoline!
Tonight we barbecue
Satan is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!

Here goes the alarm, but we won't save you, we will do you harm
We are murderers, we are insane, your screams for help are all in vain

We're not an ordinary rescue team
We don't care about your horrible screams
(Aaahhhh, I'm burning, help me, oooohhh!!!!)
Our tank is filled with fuckin' gasoline!
We're Satan's servants, you will see

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Fire!

Some of you try to jump from the fire
But we await you with sharpened spikes
You are cremated and still alive
We are possessed, we are demonized!
Ha, ha, we are demonized!

Satanic Rescue Team
Instead of water we bring gasoline!
Tonight we barbecue
Satan is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
Satan is, Satan is, Satan is waiting for you!
