Oooh... I am Grave Raper
I am a creepy guy
I have a date at midnight
A shovel in my hand...

When others sleep I'm hard at work
Horny like hell, digging earth
Six feet down is where she lies
Lady temptress, smell of flies
She is a perfect lover
Her coffin is our bed
Here she is, I throw away the shovel
I kiss her decomposing face

I am the Grave Raper
I am a creepy guy
I'm gonna fuck you til,
Until you fucking die
But that's impossible
You are already dead
It's time for blow job now
Give me your rotten head

[CHORUS:]
In the night I creep and skulk
I told you I'm a creepy guy
In the night I desecrate
Rape you in your grave
I fuck your corpse to pieces
I am your necro-lover
No worry of diseases
I always use a rubber!

Between your legs I place my head
Your rancid smell I sniff
Now I kiss your skull instead
Come on, don't be so stiff!
Shining through your skeleton
Gives me a bad hard-on
Turn you around in the graveyard grass
To fuck what used to be your ass!

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I am the Grave Raper
I am a creepy guy
I'm gonna fuck you til,
Until you fucking die
But that's impossible
You are already dead
It's time for blow job now
Give me your rotten head
Shining through your skeleton
Gives me a bad hard-on
Turn you around in the graveyard grass
To fuck what used to be your ass!

Oh, shit, here's the morning
Time to go home
But I'll be back...
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
