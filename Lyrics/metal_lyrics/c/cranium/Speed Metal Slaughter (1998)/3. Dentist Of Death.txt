Welcome to my clinic
Have a seat in the padded chair
I'll fix your teeth alright
And my price is always fair
And now you wake up screaming
The drill is bouncing in your oral cavity
This is real, you are not dreaming
Your limbs shake in insanity

Eat the fuckin' drill!   AHHHHHHH!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!   OHHHHHHHHHH!

[BRIDGE:]
Tongue and teeth, fly in the air
The drill is alive inside your head
You shit yourself and you're strapped in the chair
Your brain explodes with pain and then you're dead

[CHORUS:]
The final swing is indeed a drill
It's how many patients I can kill
I'm in charge and I drill at will
The dentist of death!
What once was a pretty head
Is now a mess of skin, teeth and flesh
My white coat is now blood red
The dentist of death!

How can I help you sir?
Oh please, have a seat
I'll free you of your pain
Yes I am armed to the teeth

Open your mouth, idiot!   AAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!
Ha, ha, ha!   OOOOOHHHHHH!!!!!

[REPEAT BRIDGE]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Open your mouth!   OOOOHH, AAAHHH!!
Eat the drill!   UUAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!
You idiot, eat it!   AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!

[REPEAT CHORUS]

The final swing is indeed a drill
It's how many patients I can kill
I'm in charge and I drill at will
The dentist of death!
[REPEAT x2]
