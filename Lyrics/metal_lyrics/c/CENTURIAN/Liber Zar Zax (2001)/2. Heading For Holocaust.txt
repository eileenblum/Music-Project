Born to undo
God and his brood
Burn to bring down
Father and son

The Agitator
Breeding disorder
The death of god
And the end of the world
Am I

Unbound under possession
Hungering for the kill
I know only chaos
And the Gods above god

Satanic furor
Mad and with many
Spreading destruction
Nothing compels me

Churning masses
Chanting my hate
They will die
Laughing and slaying

Exhumed
From Hell and below
Unleashed
To get rid of god
Conquering
Under Satan's will
Revelling
In the stench of decay

Burning with fury
Feeding fires of blackest hatred
I propagate war
Let the battle escalate
