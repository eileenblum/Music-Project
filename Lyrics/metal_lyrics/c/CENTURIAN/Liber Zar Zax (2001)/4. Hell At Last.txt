The second death becomes me
As I stand in front of god
I swear out loud that I hate him - kill him!
And that he will rot

I must burn in hell
Suffer and pay for my sins
But god's the one who's losing
Satan always wins

Hell at last
I'm dying fast
Through the gates
Into the regions of hell
Eager to meet
The angel who fell

Foul and nasty god
It's not to heaven I wish to go
I'd rather die forever
I am of Satan's bloodline

Thrown to hell but proud to burn
Barred forever from the blessed
I won't end up inside the hole
Where angels rot in holy bliss

I'll make his servants kill for me
For I am the provider of death
I, Ensnarer of life
Will mark the goddamn slaves as mine
