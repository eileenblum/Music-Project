Rejoice in the reign of Satan
Now is the time to purify
Make way for crisis
Welcome god's demise

Rebirth through violence
Renewal through war
God's peace is pathetic
Craving for hell

Worthless are the weak
Crush the cult of the Nazarene
Hail unto Satan, giver of license
To waste this world and the vermin of christ

Christians were born to be smashed
Beat them to death with their bible
Their god is a cockroach, made in their image
Remove this pest from the earth!

Last rites for the holy flock
Away with their corrupted lives
Darkness falls upon the lands
And god has nothing to say

Ad Majorem Satanae Gloriam

Be done with them! Be done with this filth
Kill to exalt the lord of Hell
Offerings with blood and meat
Butchered and beaten for Satan divine

Blood demons of eternal death
Attend this ritual

Butchery on the altars of god
Bleeding flesh for the glory of Satan
Sacrificial slaughterhouse
Empty their church until nothing is left
