Black and foul, the lifeless core
Of my existence
An open grave, restless and hungry
Defines my being
No creation, nothing divine
Shall escape the darkness
Fusing and crushing all that I sense
My vision of life
Is what remains to be killed

Feel the pull towards the end
Cursed forms disintegrate
Dragging bodies into naught
Your universe must die!

Behind my eyes, the sphere of death
Ever growing, all consuming
Grinding your souls into meaningless waste
Voracious tumourous evil
No billion lives can satiate
The blasphemy which I must serve
Feeding the darkness with those in my grasp
Feeding your flesh
To the black nuclear chaos

Feeding hatred with hatred
Pure hatred for creation

Feeding darkness with darkness
Utter darkness growning blacker

Feeding chaos with chaos
Malignant chaos ever expanding

Feeding flesh to the gorge of Hell
To the infinite hunger of death

Dead black nucleus
Gorge
