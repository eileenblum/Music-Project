I am All and Nothing
Deformed and formless
Disembodied
Prepared for death

I fall into the darkest sky
Into madness and beyond
I end the earth and it's feeble gods
Never to return

Bonds of reason torn to shreds
Laws and logic scattered
Untie my Self from time and place
From doctrines of existence

Blasting forth, as aethyrs burn
This fleshless body of hate
I ascend above the heavens
Far beyond god

ZarZax unto Zax
Back into the abyss

Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

Serpents whirling at my side
Blazing in full fury
The realm of chaos welcomes me
Ready to devour

Into the Womb, that I may become
The Avatar, mindless and void
To strike at creation from every dimensions
Absorb my killing
