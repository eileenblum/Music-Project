Hand in hand with death and the damned
Sick of life and sick of your god
My heart pounds chaos, no need for living
Stabbing away what remains of my soul

I am three times three, the threefold curse
Knower of death and anti-matter
I am the seed of entropy
Demonically sworn to chaos and evil

Into the pit with no repent
For this is my will
All left behind, I look ahead
Severed from god and redemption

I stand in god's way and I stand not alone
Forever committed to Hell
I burn with the million favoured ones
I am become

One of the legion
