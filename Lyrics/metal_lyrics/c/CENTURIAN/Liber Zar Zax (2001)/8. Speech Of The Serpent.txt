Pierced hands strangling your soul
Making you gasp for mercy
Choking confessions from your penance
Suffocate! You are a sinner

Watching and judging, nothing escapes
The prying eyes of their lord
Adding up sins, you must be punished
Cave Cave Deus Vivit!

He sees you!

Totally lost in the desert of christ
Thirsting for truth, alone in despair
Listen to me! The desert is empty
Listen to me! Jesus is dead

Treacherous are the ways of their god
Renounce your guilt and see for yourself
His sheep stumble blind amidst opportunity
Their pain and weakness go unrewarded

Don't be a fool, come enter into my world
Turn his wasteland into a land of plenty
Taste the fruit of shameless indulgence
Redeem yourself and burn at my side

Burn!

My wisdom, poison to god
Be enlightened by my knowledge
Allow the flames to cleanse your soul
Our bond is forged in purest fire

Wield my power to conquer and create
Your desire becomes a willing body
To be as Gods, so natural and supreme
Take pleasure in this other blessing

Become divine
