Alas, alas go weep and weep again
For thereÂ´s a plague among thee
The scandal of twelve
Unfaithful disciple defecting from him

My mouth is the mouth of hell
Rip the gospel with my words
Awakening the atheist 
I redeem this earth from god

Reversing all speech 
I alter the word
Receive the new birth!
Tongues of fire descend upon thy heads

Fulfilling the prophecy
I commit the sin unto death
Unfolding the charlatan
His stinking coven be corrupted!

Blamed and defamed
Predestined for damnation
Hanged and despised
I killed thy lord
