Fallen as a sinner
In a fallen world of sinners
For his testing
For his purification

He shall try thee
Live unbound to the sinnerÂ´s will
He shall try thee
Those shallt choose sin and hell

Thou shallt bleed for the lord thy god
Bleed into death!
Thou wert born a blasphemy
Die with bloody hands!

Thou shallt bleed for the lord thy god
Cover thy sins!
More blood upon the altar!
More conviction!

Thou shallt bleed for the lord thy god
Smash thy head to the ground!
To the ground!
To the ground

Bash thy brow until it bleeds!
Until it bleeds!
Until the sign of worship
Reveals itself!
