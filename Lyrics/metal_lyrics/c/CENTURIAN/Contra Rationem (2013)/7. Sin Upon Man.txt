God is sin
Who shall delivered us
From the body of this death?

Too pure to approve god
Too pure to look at god
Our divine nature cannot abide god

God is sin 
It has filled the soul 
With sickness and disease

Confess it repent of it 
And thou hath solved any hardships
That besets thee

God is sin
And forever lies
Beneath our wrath
