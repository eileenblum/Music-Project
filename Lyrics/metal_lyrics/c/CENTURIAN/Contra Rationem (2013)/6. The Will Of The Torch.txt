Fools!
Come to the light!
Fools!
Follow the will the new torch!

Luminous!
Thy fiery god precedes
Will he take thee to the resurrection?
Or will he lead into death?

Elusive!
Thy fiery god recedes
Hath thou fallen into the spirit?
Hath thou died in the lord?

Pray his face to shine upon thee
Pray his face to shine upon thee
Pray his face to shine upon thee
Pray his face to shine upon thee

Shut up in blindness
Thou shallt walk by faith alone
The brightness of the flickering flame
Defiled by a flicker of doubt 

His fading face never shined and never will
The light of the holy ghost
A ghost light forever
A ghost light forever

Left in pitch darkness
Thou art not far 
From the kingdom of god
From the kingdom of god
