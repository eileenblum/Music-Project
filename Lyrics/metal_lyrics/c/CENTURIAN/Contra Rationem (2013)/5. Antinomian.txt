No law can rise above my will

Fuck the world
Fuck the holy ways of man
Fuck the world
I am the exception of the rule 

The fundamental need
To abandon all truth other than mine
I view reality from the opposite angle
The lightning I bear scatters all lies

No law can rise above my will 

Scorned for vices
That reject what is just 
Nailed to the cross of undying darkness 
I am prepared for absolution

I suffer not 
Smiling as my eyes drip blood
The light of chaos shines upon me
Alive without the law 
No law can rise above my will
