I stand
Where no man can reach me
In league with eternity
I am forever

I stand
Where no man can judge me
For I am god
Until eternity ends

Lex maiestatis
Thou hasth betrayed me
Thou hast failed
To worship the emperor

I stand
Erected as a phallus
Thrusting in the womb of antiquity
I have overcome damnation

Thou hasth murdered my flesh
Thou hasth asked to desecrate my dead body
And condemn my memory
That I shall be completely and totally forgotten
Thou hasth tried to scatter all of my images
My statues defaced
Thou hasth tried to remove my name
From the scriptures
That I may be erased


Thy ignorance shall be awareness
I shall be ever present in the minds of thy children
And in the minds of thy offspring
And generations to come

My reign is never ending
Remembered and hailed as the third emperor
Thou shallt dread me
Even in death
