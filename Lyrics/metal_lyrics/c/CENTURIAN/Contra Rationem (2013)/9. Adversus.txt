Counted with those
Who go down into the pit 
Proud and accursed
We have sworn and wonÂ´t repent

Counted with those 
Who go down into the pit
Loyal to hell
And committed to die

Versus all!
We accuse and oppose
Versus all!

Blessed are the averse
Who walk in the counsil of the ungodly
The just are against
Our covenant is opposition
