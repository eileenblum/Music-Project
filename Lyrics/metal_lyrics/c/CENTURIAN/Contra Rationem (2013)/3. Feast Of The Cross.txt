Choronzon with us abide!
ItÂ´s the night of the cross
All come to the congregation
Come to celebrate the sign of our lord choronzon

Come to receive the perfection of light
Tonight out spirits burn under the cross of redemption

Follow the path to the foot of the cross
Follow the path reversing and blessing
Follow the path concealed in revelation
Follow the path the one way is threefold

Erect ye the shape of infinite fire
Raise aloft the serpent within
Return and find ouranos sulphur
Erect ye the cross of unconscious will

We bear the mark that scatters illusions
We bear the mark that dissolves the gods
Be it multiplied and worshipped
Carved on the foreheads of all!
