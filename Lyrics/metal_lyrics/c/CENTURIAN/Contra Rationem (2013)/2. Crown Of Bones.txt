Layer by layer
I shake the ground
Layer by layer
I shake the deceased

Into the city of coffins
The eyes of a thousand Christs
Stare in silence
How I revel in the ashes of man

I follow the call
That echoes from the grave
Bone to bone
I bring together what has been buried

Smell the dead!
The priceless essence of human bones
Inhale the dead!
Touch the thick scent of the afterlife

A hundred floors down
Slip through the legacy of dust
In the sands of time
None who turns his back on death can be alive

From coffin to coffin I descend
Visions channeled through empty sockets
At the sign of death
I claim my crown of bones

Through the rattle of fleshless bones
I hear the dead speak!
âWhat we are you will be
What you are we once wereâ

Shineth through me!
