Meet god's children
Slay them, drink them
Get drunk on the love that flows out of them
Damned are the newborn lambs of god
They shall all live to bleed
They all shall live to crawl
To pray and to get punished, untill all is dark
And the day of dying has arrived!!!

Jesus christ is not a king
He lays stinking and rotting
Among the false prophets
Death to them who worships him
To slay is to salvate, and to have salvation
Godless chaos is the way
The power of christ compels me not!!!

Murder is righteous
To kill is to live
To kill is to smother, the stink of god
Find peace in killing, and take christian life
Make victims and violence
For SATAN's rise!!!
