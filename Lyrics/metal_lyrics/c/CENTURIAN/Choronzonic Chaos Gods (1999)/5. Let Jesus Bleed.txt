TO THE CROSS!!!
TO THE CROSS!!!
NAIL HIM TO THE CROSS!!!
Beware, beware, jesus lives
Take heed, take heed, he is here
Peeled from the cross
Torn from his slumber of suffering
Second coming, certain death, in god's name

To the cross, nail him to the cross

With torns from withered roses
I will lame a crown
And press it into his skull
While spitting in his face
With a smile I'll kill
His every follower
Branded am I
To end god's corrupt plan
I will drink of his blood
Until the last drip is pinched
From his open wounds
And all will chant:

TO THE CROSS!!!
TO THE CROSS!!!
NAIL HIM TO THE CROSS!!!
