I am the God you worship
I am the messiah
I am god's son like jesus was
I am salvation for the sinners
I am the prince of profanity
I invented lust and life
I wrote the fowlest fantasy
I am the bringer of sweet Death

I am author of damnation
I sealed the book of Sodomy

I am the purple sky
As you lay strangled at my feet

Hail Caligula!!!

In my name you lust is sacrificed
In my name your soul is sold
For the glory you feast with blood
For my glory the ritual is done

Step inside my heaven
Step inside my home of sin
Go with the mad emperor
Go with Caligula

Bow down before the master
Bow down in front of me
Crawl, children crawl
Crawl for Caligula!!!
