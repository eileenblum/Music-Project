Remorse unspoken, no soul bothered
Jesus christ, Do you still believe?
Now on the cross, and no big loss
Thanks to your own mischief

I can't wait to be in Hell
I can't wait to meet you there
I can't wait to watch you burn
While I shall stand the flames

Forget god, he is dead
Say farewell, to your father
Burn and be pleased to burn
For there's no other way

Than the law of burning

There's no life only Death
Take pleasure in his living lifeless
Behold the true God!
He who gives birth to life's death

I never understood your pain
But this is what you wanted
Never ever will I sympathize with you
When I'm in Hell, I won't stop laughing
