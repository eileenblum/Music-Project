Where else can I go with my hate?
Molesting my skin, I struggle to bleed
No longer to bear the rage in me
Am I an assassin to be ?

Why not kill the ones without a will?
Why not burn the house of god?
Why not catch the insects
And trap them all to dirt ?

So close to the line where I will snap
Itâs taking over, bloodlust fury
Christians in sight, knife in command
Away with the law, death is at hand

Trying to save my sanity, through prayers working weak
I donât expect them to succeed, my soulâs lost
I will always bleed, which way shall I fly
To let them know the beast, that dwells in my heart unleashed

The cross of Fury!!!

On their way to make me pray
But whatever they say itâs rotten
They bother my will and plan to kill
Sperm of the miserable crucifix

They are blind
Kill their kind

I bleed and sow the seed of Satan
Feel the demon grow
Flourished from my pain
Purified from anger... I am sane
