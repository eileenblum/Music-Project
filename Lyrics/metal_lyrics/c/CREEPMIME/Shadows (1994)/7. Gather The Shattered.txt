Internal descent down every ladder in existence
lie naked with the dragon-no interest in resistance
to give myself vision where I was blind
I trip the trigger and detonate my mind

Fragmented memories and kaleidoscopic visions
reality is mutable and open to revision
seek the supersonic become one with all
immerse myself in the ocean of my soul

Gather the shattered remains of thoughts
thought mattered
redefine my world
debris is scattered, a fleeting glimse of the hereafter
liberates any soul

Lost in myself, alone I stand
searching for a death of moments
divine and mundane reconciled. I live

The world realigns and begins to take form
breathless and weak yet alive, reborn
experiment or experience? Rejoice or regret?
Only one way to know as I take my first steps
