Utterance of a word to give form
to give being all
corrupted by aeons of interpretation
misinterpretation of all

No longer a path back to that which once was
now a suicidal game of chinese whispers of god

The word mutated: a phrase of fallacy
the phrase a law that rules our lives: insanity

Assimilate myriad delusions
seek the whispered word
behind the roars of ingorance

Seek the path back to that which once was
no more futile fumblings for a misunderstood god
