I'm seeing the parts in me
that which I hate to see
suffer the shadows
suffer the shadows

The child inside weep for my life
for such bitter twisted dreams
the fool by her side could never see lies
any economy of truth he believed

Blind to compassion
I shall suffer the shadows in my past
depressed and saddened
I shall pay my debt to nature

The mother insode feels my sadness and pain
in this growing pool of desire
the father by her side could never have cared
cold blooded he lived as a liar
