You shall die so many times before you perish

Surrounded by living, self indulging mirrors
digesting temptation's stolen fruit
moving on self-fulfilled circles
personality hanged on a rope called capitalism
organism breathing a life of false ecstasy

You shall die so many times before you perish
consuming the fruits of ill virtue

Personifying the sickening nature of man's lechery
lusting society's forbidden fruit
loving in uncaring detachment
creativity sacrificed to a world of conventions
hedonism existing in a maelstorm of lies
