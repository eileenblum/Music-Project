A dream become a creed, a want become a need
a serenade for the tragic
a lover self confessed, a circle truly blessed
emotional hegemony

Sanity on a shoestring, a tripwire tragedy
oscillation between extremes
of agonizing sumblimity and sublime agony

Skirting reality with holistic perceptions
absorbtion of truths
wanted as evidence and evidently unwanted

An unprotected sensitivity, a capacity to drink poisons
gladly court oblivion
by loving with death and dying to love

Desires pursued to their bloody ends
and compulsive denial
of unpopular possibilities and unasked for reality
