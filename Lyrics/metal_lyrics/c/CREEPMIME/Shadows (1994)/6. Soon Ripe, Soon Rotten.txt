He that lives in hope, dances to all ill tune
for wantonness knows no law
and corporations have neither bodies to be punished
nor souls to be damned
the road to oblivion is paved with good intentions
and work incentives

In the world of the blind
the one eyed man makes corporations
corporations leaving sickness
which can't be cured which must be endured

One funeral brings many in civilised society
a society soon ripe, soon rotten

A guilty conscience needs no accuser
but silence is mistaken for consent and to erris human
drive out nature with a pitchfork and she'll neither come back
nor breathe for us again
the road of oblivion is paved with good intentions
and momentary lapses of reason
