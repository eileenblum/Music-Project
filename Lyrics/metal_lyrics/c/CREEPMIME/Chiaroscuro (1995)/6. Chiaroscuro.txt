[All artists are subjected to the same social prejudices. It's a fight 'til]
[the bloody end so hang on in there. Fuck the rituals]

My godform's a potent reality
A living formula for all shades of divinity
I've felt its soul
Introduce me to modes of insanity
And infinity
It's put me in touch with a real reality

My life forms in ways which you'll never see
A growing enigma for the thoughtless majority
I've had their rules
Reduce me to moments of poverty
Self discovery
I've been put to their test
And I feel a shameless certainty

I'm unknown colour and diversity
A uniting harmony for a world of disharmony
Can you feel it pull?
Seduce you?
Rip and tear at your sanity?
Your entropy?
It will bring you dangerously
Close to understanding me

Chiaroscuro
I see, I know the light for the shadows
Liberty's sacred not shameful
Chiaroscuro
Fuck the rituals
Follow your heart

I live a life of infinite possibilities
I move in other dimensions and realms of being
I experience unknown pleasures
I have conquered my fear of the known
I am removed from the human framework
You cannot take this away
