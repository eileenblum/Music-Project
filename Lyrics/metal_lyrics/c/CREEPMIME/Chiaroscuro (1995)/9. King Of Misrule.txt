[This is a song of chaos and misunderstanding]

I am the king of misrule
A puzzle of jigsawn emotions
An enigmatic witches brew
Of reality, illusion
And helter skelter sanity
A fusion of confusion
I use

I am the king of all hate
A dilemna of conflicting devotions
An agony addict twisting fates
And harmony, intentions
One lick and I promise insanity
A chaotic creation
I abuse

I am the king of misrule
I am the king of all hate
