[If you lose your heart you'll kill to get it back]

Aphrodites puppet
You love and your world's well lost
Embrace the make believe
She's a godsend
Ride every crest of every wave

Blind boy prodigy
You're stung, and cupids arrows are deadly
Escape your wonderland
She-devil
Look for a loophole in your love

How heartholed and fancy free
You've loved and your world's lost
Endear yourself to liberty
Black widower
Break every heart there is to break

Rush a heart of fools gold
A heart of fools gold
