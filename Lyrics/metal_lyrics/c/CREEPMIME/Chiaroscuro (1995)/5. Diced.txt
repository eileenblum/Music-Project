[A guide to good living after Luke Rhineharts 'The Dice Man']

I am one
I am multiple
Impulse control
Selves an integral part of myself
Chaos in a nutshell
Beautiful
I am free
And chance is my god

I am one
I'm chameleon
A random man
Every promise a dicers oath
Doubt in your trusted hell
Unpredictable
I am me
And chance is my god

Every moment a game of chance
As I dice with my life and death
Diced
