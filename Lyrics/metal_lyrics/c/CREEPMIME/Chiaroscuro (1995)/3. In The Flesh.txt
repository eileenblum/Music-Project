[The chameleon man is free and searching for answers.]
[He cares little for the world]

Master of all moods
Jack of none
Eight wonder of the world
Angelic when I please
Possessed to some

Dreamer in the clouds
Down to earth
At sixes and sevens with
Every heaven and every hell
My god is yet to come

Madness in the flesh
Bohemian
I'm figuring in anarchy
And stability
I'm at rest
Neither troubled nor undone

Rainbows have an end
Dreams come true
So I'll live without your blessing
Head held high
While I grow
To become or become undone

Madness in the flesh
