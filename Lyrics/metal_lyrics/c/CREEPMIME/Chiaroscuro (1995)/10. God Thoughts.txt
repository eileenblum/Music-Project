[An understanding of the one universal truth is all that's needed to know the]
[godhead. Easier said than done]

Generations
A nuclear family
Centres of small worlds which itch for attraction
In stillness of spin
Energy
Potential for creation

Interactions
Merry go round hierarchy
Forces of nature in motion for aeons
Invalid or potent
Potency
Empowered and charged

We savour the flavours of
Strangeness, beauty, and charm
And we're sensing the truth
But our questions stay unanswered
And the thought of god still elude us
Thoughts of god. Gods thoughts
