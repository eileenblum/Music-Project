[Some things, no matter how right they feel, are not as they appear]

Sink your identity
Fuse with a heavenly body
Lose your heart
And make a god in her image

Sink into oblivion
Friends, your love I have forgotten
Mend your hearts
And make a god in her image and mine

Is this what you call ecstacy?
Child your paradise is foolish
Feel your heart break and bleed
As she steals it

Think of an alternative
Friend a soulmate isn't worth your soul
Free your heart
Exorcise the devil from your life

Caught between the devil and her deep blue eyes
Friend foolish, beauty wise, in a fools paradise
