Edges turning, turning in my way
Servants crawling, crawling to the grave
Endless working, working up the pace
Constantly burning, burning with a shade

Edges turning, turning in my way
Servants crawling, crawling to the grave
Restless ego starting up a war
Priceless substance, kills forevermore

Banished if you fail [x3] you will be

Edges turning, turning in my way
Servants crawling, crawling to the grave
Endless working, working up the pace
Constantly burning, burning with a shade

Liquid demons, flowing in the haze
Magic meltdown, taking up your space
Negative thoughts, bringing on the game
Glowing hatred, lighting up the flame

Banished if you fail [x3] you will be
