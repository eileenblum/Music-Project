Of all the scars I have ever known
This one will hurt the most
Of all the doors I have opened in my life
This one will remain closed

I can fell it staring at me (staring at me) I can feel it so close
You try to open up the wounds that never heal
You try to ruin my life
All I get is a vicious smile back
As I walk the knife

Low, low can you feel It inside
Slow, slow as you turn the knife
Go, go won't you spoil my life
Low, low I can't predict your lies

Missing in the action, surpassing all the bets
Into satisfaction 'til you make your last breath
There's no way I can go, there's no way I've been told
What still remains and what is next

Lost and eager to find the truth I see
Those demons always try to get a piece of me
I'll be under pressure burning constantly
Mind over matter lives no more inside of me [x2]

Low, low can you feel It inside
Slow, slow as you turn the knife
Go, go won't you spoil my life
Low, low I can't predict your lies

Of all the scars I have ever known
This one will hurt the most
Of all the doors I have opened in my life
This one will remain closed

Low, low can you feel It inside
Slow, slow as you turn the knife
Go, go won't you spoil my life
Low, low I can't predict your lies

Lost and eager to find the truth I see
Those demons always try to get a piece of me
I'll be under pressure burning constantly
Mind over matter lives no more inside of me [x2]
