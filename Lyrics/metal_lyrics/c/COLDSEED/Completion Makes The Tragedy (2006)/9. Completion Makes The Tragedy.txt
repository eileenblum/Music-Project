Completion makes the tragedy!

Ten times is not enough
You'll suffer 'til the end of time
Imaginations will turn to dust
And break the silenced kind

You reach the spot, you wanna burn
A moment of hypocrisy
You turn cold, you wanna turn
Completion makes the tragedy

Like a sinner on the threshold
You pull the strings out of nowhere
You break the silence
You strike the nerve

Like a serpent that will never let go
Let go!

What makes the tragedy
Speak out, I gotta know
It turns its back on you and grows
What creates the pain I feel
Speak out, I gotta know
Times changed and you will never know

Completion makes the tragedy!

A great loss turn the page
You might as well do it again
A great trap it's all the same
You made it to the deep end

Completion makes the tragedy! [x2]

What makes the tragedy
Speak out, I gotta know
It turns its back on you and grows
What creates the pain I feel
Speak out, I gotta know
Times changed and you will never know

Ten times is not enough
You'll suffer 'til the end of time
Imaginations will turn to dust
And break the silenced kind

You reach the spot, you wanna burn
A moment of hypocrisy
You turn cold, you wanna turn
Completion makes the tragedy

Like a sinner on the threshold
You pull the strings out of nowhere
You break the silence
You strike the nerve

Like a serpent that will never let go
Never let go! Never let go!

Completion makes the tragedy!

What makes the tragedy
Speak out, I gotta know
It turns its back on you and grows
What creates the pain I feel
Speak out, I gotta know
Times changed and you will never know
