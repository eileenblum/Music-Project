Now that you have shut the doors again
Feel how all of the sins are being washed away
Nothing but a loser, a senseless cruiser
Of insanity I am

Nothing but a loser, just spread the name
An exceptional abuser, cause you're all the same
Cause I am, (forever damned) cause I can't understand
Why you're so desperately haunting me
Nothing but a loser, just spread the name

This life is going way out of hand
Inside you feel the ever-growing mortal stand
Nothing but a deathwish, a smile with a deathwish
Sets the light of the day

Nothing but a loser, just spread the name
An exceptional abuser, cause you're all the same
'cause I am (forever damned) 'cause I can't understand
Why you're so desperately haunting me
Nothing but a loser, just spread the name

Nothing but a loser, just spread the name
An exceptional abuser, cause you're all the same (forever damned)
Cause I am, cause I can't understand
Why you're so desperately haunting me
Nothing but a loser, just spread the name
