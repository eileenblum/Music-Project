I gotta realise it, I gotta make it through
And when I turn the pages
I can see through you
I try to get the pace up
But you just slow me down
It all just seems so fatal
We're stuck in a soundtrack with no sound

I wanna tell you something
Cause my time just reflects
Don't you know that I've been walking
The path that rejects
I'm never alone
And I never repent
I feel like a brick in the wall

I wanna tell you something
I wanna catch my breath
The path that I've been walking
Was always put to the test
We live two separate lives
Alien to each other
Blown out of proportion
Bursting out in disguise

I wanna tell you something
Cause my time just reflects
Don't you know that I've been walking
The path that rejects
I'm never alone
And I never repent
I feel like a brick in the wall

Gotta make it fine
But you know that
I'm a different kind
Won't you close the door
Cause you don't feel at all
I'm leaving now

I wanna tell you something
Cause my time just reflects
Don't you know that I've been walking
The path that rejects
I'm never alone
And I never repent
I feel like a brick in the wall
