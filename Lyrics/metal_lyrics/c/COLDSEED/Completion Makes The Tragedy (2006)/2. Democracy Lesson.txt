In a bitter sense, you're close to arrogance
As a sign of your bitter fall, you fall into trance
Your words, your promises are lost and will never be found
Take a look in the mirror now, cause you can't make a sound

All you could see was already known
The mouths that you feed will be turning the point
Come back and show me the things that I've done
Cause I can't see at all
The truth stands tall in the trust that I've made

Such a mental choking democracy
(The violence within me)
And a collaborating society

Despite your loneliness, you're all going down
Dig a hole in your mindtrap and pretend to be numb

All you could see was already known
The mouths that you feed will be turning the point
Come back and show me the things that I've done
Cause I can't see at all
The truth stands tall in the trust that I've made

Such a mental choking democracy
(The violence within me)
And a collaborating society [x2]

Desperately wanting something (you really never had)
Constantly recharging (the endless battery)
May all those dreams be not in vain
It's there but it's not to take the blame

Such a mental choking democracy
(The violence within me)
And a collaborating society

Since when do we have such a constant greed
(And the public demand chokes the need)
And a collaborating society

Desperately wanting something (you really never had)
Constantly recharging (the endless battery)
May all those dreams be not in vain
It's there but it's not to take the blame
