Facing the helpless, was the vulture of the throne [x2]

Sent from a time where everything turns black
You never care if its right or wrong
Your permission will turn to lack

Bring back those haunted years
In a second you are gone after all those years

I've perished and nothing remains the same
You better believe it
Put your trust in endless pain

You're trembling, defending the vulture of the throne

Obey your disease, it destroys your needs
Watch out for the careless mind
As it cuts and you bleed

Mortal innocence, no intelligence
Dividing the throne as you fall
Fading self defense, ruthless arrogance
Dividing the throne as you fall

Walking back there alone
And you feel so relentless
Make your way to the throne
As you're facing the helpless

Sum it up with a mind control
Such a vicious disease
Shut it out, shut it out
The desire is there as you bleed

Lean back and face your fears
In a second they are gone after all those years

Nobody can change my mind
Nobody can ever deny
My mind is clear
My mind is clear

Walking back there alone
And you feel so relentless
Make your way to the throne
As you're facing the helpless [x2]
