What am I, what am I gonna do
Left out again, I've been choking

All those lies, I've left behind
What am I, What am I gonna do

Wreck the hatred that must have shown
All the time that you spent alone
Bury the hatchet and start to speak
Pass the word and it will retreat

It ain't no lies, as far as I know
And I can't find what you are searching for

I'm left alone and I already knew
That you were faking all those times

Wreck the hatred that must have shown
All the time that you spent alone
Bury the hatchet and start to speak
Pass the word and it will retreat

All alone and the clearance have shown
Through the eyes of a broken home
I see my future and present glow [x2]

I got a solution, I'll fire at will
My pride, my constitution will help me get my fill
I decide I will ride, I will break my conscious mind
To the core, even more, now is the time

What am I, What am I gonna do
I've lost a friend
And It's aching!

Wreck the hatred that must have shown
All the time that you spent alone
Bury the hatchet and start to speak
Pass the word and it will retreat [x2]

All alone [x4]
