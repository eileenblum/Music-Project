I know, I know
If you take me away from the cold
Like gold, you're sold
They are selling your mind don't you know

Give it away as you pray
Take it away if you may [x2]

I know, I know
If you take me away from the cold
Like gold, you're sold
They are selling your mind don't you know

And then I hit the ground
It slowly kills the sound
Like a choking ricochet
The fires are burning
Reflections, directions
Take the moments away

Give it away as you pray
Take it away if you may [x2]

I know, I know
If you take me away from the cold
Like gold, you're sold
They are selling your mind don't you know

And then I hit the ground
It slowly kills the sound
Like a choking ricochet
The fires are burning

It's deeper than you will ever know
It's just as close to the bone
From all the people that will never show
There's a darkened cloud [x2]

Hanging over you
Constant lacking
Of a restless belief
Constantly clashing
You'll never cease the day

No function, cause it's so wrong
The facts you constantly repeat
It's all fiction, my affliction
All you'll do is just deceive

Give it away as you pray
Take it away if you may [x2]

I know, I know
If you take me away from the cold
Like gold, you're sold
They are selling your mind don't you know [x2]

Give it away as you pray
Take it away if you may
