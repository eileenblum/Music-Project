Cold, black heart attack
Everyone just seems to be turning black
Who needs a soul, who needs it all
I see a brilliant solution

No time to believe it or not
You gotta live and just stop to rot
Confirmation, for the nation
I'm gonna tell you what it's all about

I'm on my way! [x2]

Stand tall and just make a change
Stand tall and just generate
You'll kill it all, you'll never fall
Fuck it up just right

Cold, black heart attack
Everyone just seems to be turning black
Who needs a soul, who needs it all
I see a brilliant solution

I'm on my way! [x3] to face my pain
Nothing to report today [x3]

I'm on my way! [x3] to face my pain
Nothing to report today [x4]
