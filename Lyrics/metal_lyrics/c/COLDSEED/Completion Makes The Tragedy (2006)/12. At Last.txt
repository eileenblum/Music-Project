Fill it up with all your rage now
No more time to kill the pain anyhow
Take a chance and make the sirens scream
Take a glance you're going insane

One more trick before your soul dies
No more time to kill the sound anyhow
One more sign before your mind explodes
It's too damn full and you make it blow

Blow your mind to get a break now
No more time to hesitate anyhow
One more trick before your soul dies
It's too damn sick to pay the price

Stretch your power to the end now
No more time to kill the sound anyhow
One more sign before your mind explodes
It's too damn full and you make it blow

It could have been you, you know it's true
It's stabbing the heart of mine [x2]

Running, running
Running away from the past
Reaching, reaching
Reaching out at last

It could have been you, you know it's true
It's stabbing the heart of mine [x2]

Running, running
Running away from the past
Reaching, reaching
Reaching out at last

Blow your mind to get a break now
No more time to hesitate anyhow
One more trick before your soul dies
It's too damn sick to pay the price

Stretch your power to the end now
No more time to kill the sound anyhow
One more sign before your mind explodes
It's too damn full and you make it blow
And you make it blow
And you make it blow
