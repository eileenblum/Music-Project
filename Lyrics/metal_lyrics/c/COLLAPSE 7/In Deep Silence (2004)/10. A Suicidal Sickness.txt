A fervent rain invades the planet
And let us inhale the insufferable winds
The inner tragedy ends in pain
Seeking the scorn in our burning faces

In a span of anguish time stands still
Perennial visions of horrible dreams
The inner despair burns in our minds
Soon we shall suffer eternal and blind

Now this world will bleed forever
Our destiny calls to strike us dead
A time for war is everytime
Mankind in suicidal sickness

A new creation of evil
Diminution from decay
Cold ashes reflecting sorrow
Evolution in dismay

The fragile future
Is one with frustration
That leads our journey
Into termination

A new creation of evil
Diminution from decay
Cold ashes reflecting sorrow
Evolution in dismay

The fragile future
Is one with frustration
That leads our journey
Into termination
