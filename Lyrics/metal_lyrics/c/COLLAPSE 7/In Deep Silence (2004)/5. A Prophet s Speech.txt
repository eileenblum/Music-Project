Blessed is he who in the name of charity
And good will shepherds the weak to the valley of darkness.
For he is truly his brother's keeper
And a finder of lost gilt.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
And furious anger those who attempt to poison
And destroy my brothers.
And you will know my name is the law
When I lay my vengeance upon thee.
