Awake!
Awake, it's the journey's end
Meriless times across the land
This crippled world screams for release
A sorrow filled mass alone with their belief
This one way path of untrue faith
Is burning under your broken feet
The final words left to die away
And their souls entangled in pestilent flames

Awake!
Awake, it's the journey's end
A failed belief that fights us to death
Man's downfall is so complete
A final solution is what they seek
This one way path of untrue faith
Is burning under your broken feet
The final words left to die away
And their souls entangled in pestilent flames

And so we walk hand in hand
Into our ouw demise
Sustained vy the sickness in yoou
Depressions what we despise

A false divinity has grown
In that shadow empire where bloody seeds are sown
And all sense is earthly life
Is killed by technologies unknown

What we became - is all to blame
Their faith in flames

A carnal god breeds hypocrisy
Millennium madness dressed in black decease
Our hearts impaled on misery
Follow the blind who stand for victory

Your palace of hate with godly parts
Are watching the faithful hands
They wave their last goodbye
With unseen glory in their hearts
The anticipation will come true
Their holy eyes shall turn to sand
His ignorant flocks are never to be free
Like lost sheeps, hopeless and on command
