Deep down in a hidden place
Raped of eternal blackness and coldness
Strained by a continuosly malevolent vision of fear
An unknown dimension

An age of darkness ablaze the soul
Reflections of pain decay unfolds
Perished and drowned in blood
No expressions of seedig life
All illisions fade
Into visions of death

Confused and deformed within
I stare out through my sick eyes
Into the night surrounding us constantly
The fearful signs of a prophet's speech

Seized by misery
Burning from within
A fatal fallacy
Weird memories remain

Deep down in a hidden place
Raped of eternal blackness and coldness
Strained by a continuosly malevolent vision of fear
An unknown dimension
