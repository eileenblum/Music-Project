Alone without thoughts and no light
Empty emotions fill their minds
Alone without faith an no truth
A sickening way to gaining fools
The endless search for a warmth inside
As they starring through blinded eyes
The weakeing flocks bleed to death
And twisted souls are condemned

Exalted from domination
Completely high on adoration
Unspeakable acts of perversion
In rapture of torment
The pain is so real

In chains they lay - never to be released
In pain they trust - together they'll suffer

Exalted from domination
Completely high on adoration
Unspeakable acts of perversion
In rapture of torment
The pain is so real

In chains they lay - never to be released
In pain they trust - together they'll suffer

Intensive signs of desolation
Lost souls destined to rot
A thoughtness exploitation
Of hearts once filled with light

Alone without thoughts and no light
Empty emotions fill their minds
Alone without faith an no truth
A sickening way to gaining fools
The endless search for a warmth inside
As they starring through blinded eyes
The weakeing flocks bleed to death
And twisted souls are condemned
