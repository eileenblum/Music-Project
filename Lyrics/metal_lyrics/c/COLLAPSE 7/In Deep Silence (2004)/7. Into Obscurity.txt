Afflicted by death - banished from life
Paralized souls numb and blind
Horror fills this hollow earth
Never a salvation to find
Far insisde fear and falseness
The essense of our thoughts

Leading the minds - into obscurity
Leading the minds - into obscurity

We are caught in deepest sandess
Forever lost in a black emptiness
Fear transfix our bleeding eyes
Our hearts are full with lies
Far inside fear and falseness
The essense of our thoughts

Afflicted by death - banished from life
Paralized souls numb and blind

The weary past sometimes hurt
A final respiration
When all comes to an end

We are caught in deepest sandess
Forever lost in a black emptiness

The weary past sometimes hurt
A final respiration
When all comes to an end

Leading the minds - into obscurity
Leading the minds - into obscurity
