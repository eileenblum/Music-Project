A timeless void seize my mind
An unknown fear comes to life
The nightwind blows into my face
As I get swallowed and lost
From an endless and cold dark maze

And with every breath I try to inhale
The smell that I follow to escape
From this tombs of depravity

The voice of the storm is whispering doom
Damned souls of the night are constant surround
As oppression rise I close my eyes
Now time stands still and forever I'll bleed

The fountain of sadness is deeper than the ocean
All sources of life are exhausted and still
Former survival urge impaired through isolation
Renewing the past with a lifetime conflict

The fountain of sadness is deeper than the ocean
Former survival urge impaired through isolation
Indistinctive fear is consuming my soul
Caught in a perishing cycle
And now I'll die all alone...
...I am dying alone.
