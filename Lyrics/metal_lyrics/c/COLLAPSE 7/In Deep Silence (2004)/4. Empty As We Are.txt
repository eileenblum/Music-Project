The grief of thousand wars
Is pmping through our sick veins
So here we are to die again
And fall into a leaden sleep
An endless deep eternal fear
Rages on in our minds
This suicidal atmosphere
Dark shadows all over mankind

Depressed feelings overload
Dark veils now unfold
Black becoming future skies
And all beneath are born to die

An endless deep eternal fear
Rages on in our minds
This suicidal atmosphere
Dark shadows all over mankind
The grief of thousand wars
Is pmping through our sick veins
So here we are to die again
And fall into a leaden sleep

A light by death reborn
Has come to burn the scorn
Our fate is just a scar
Empty as we are

Avarice leads to compliance
The plans now have validity
Refret echoes throught the mond
Reflected is iniquity
...And feel the last hope is gone
...And see the last survivor fall
...And our fate is just a scar
...Empty as we are

A light by death reborn
Has come to burn the scorn
Our fate is just a scar
Empty as we are
