The signs of cold time can't be denied
Sickening dreams in black, obscurity divine
An outblast of emptiness
Elements of brutality
A suffering process

Lost in a realm of chaos
Confusion dominates
Afflicted minds condemned to death
Legions of blackness

The spawn of evil is spreading fast
Our time has come, forgotten pain will last
An outburst of emptiness
Elements of brutality
A suffering process

Infernal infection - purity gone
Lifeless souls - resurrection absurd

The world lost in decay
Copmulsive frustration overcomes
Last hope fades away
Fatal reality of human existence

Infernal infection - purity gone
Lifeless souls - resurrection absurd
