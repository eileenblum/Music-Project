Darkest clouds steal the light
Dismal skies prevail
Inconstantly shadows
Formed to transform
The transmission is complete
All weak points abused
And cruel fevers rule
Horrible scenes in pain
All life shall die

Deceptive appearances
Overactive fantasies
A deep fall into nothing
Prolonging the pain

Deadly thoughts take their form
Exeution of innocent souls
A plague is controlling this world
Formed to transform
The transmission is complete
All weak points abused
And cruel fevers rule
Horrible scenes in pain
The flesh shall burn

Deceptive appearances
Overactive fantasies
A deep fall into nothing
Prolonging the pain

A massive infection
Creating hallucinations
Permanent spreading
An unknown disease

Awaiting the silent times
An alliance with decline
In deep silence
