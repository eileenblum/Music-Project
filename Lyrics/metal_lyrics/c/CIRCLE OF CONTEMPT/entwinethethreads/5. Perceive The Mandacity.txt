Strike me down with encouraging words,
contributing the way I shall think of myself.
Manifest that the war has begun,
that I'm ineffectual and unable to take charge.

Some have desire to consume and devour,
Take what comes!
Each time I still hear that same old sound,
watch me rise and ingest with this.

You still think it's inevitable?
Just to tell them you all are wrong!

I will show you all where I will stand!

Laughter feeds my hunger to testify that you are all wrong.
