Conceive the difficulty to breathe.
Hands, rubbing slowly, sending nerves information.

We lie next to each other, we will rest here together,
we will rest forever..

Soul's struggling for approval, neglecting the sins.
Decompose to earth and never to rise again.

Resurrection will not be an option in this demise of mankind.
Exhume the corpse, fasten the chest with nails.

Rage has taken it's place for now and forever.
Fill in the ground with soil, make it secure.. Forever.

Infested mind and body.

Relinquish this place until the light fades away. 
You remember the ones who cared.
Eyes closed now this is the way it's going to end.
Just to notice that no-one cares.
