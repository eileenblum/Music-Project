Feelings that grow within you,
complicated thoughts that exist.
As if it was unfair to be self-centered.

Distinguish the truth from false,
skillful enough to notice the difference.

Collide the world's continents, 
make them fall apart.
Overturn the whole atlas,
so it can't hold these sins anymore.

The curtain is dropped,
this show has come to close.
Demolished dreams are now ours!

The curtain is dropped,
this show has come to close.
Demolished dreams are now ours!

Lies that are told to us,
forced to us,
will end this sadness,
will end this pain.

And what comes to the lies that are told.
Revenge is hard to achieve.
This fight is just for us to win,
commit to the ones you really love.

The curtain is dropped, 
this show has come to close.
Demolished dreams are now ours!

The curtain is dropped, 
this show has come to close.
And I shall take what is mine!
