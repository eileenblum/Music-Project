A dark mist sets down,
covering underneath it
this world will set down,
obey and content oneself.

A modern way of living, 
one rule what we should follow with.
Don't dare the precept,
raise your fists and cheer for me.

Recognize your leader,
generation of an army so colossal.

Lacerate the weak ones,
desert them, they will believe your lies.

Joint bread will be served,
drops of sweat drips down your skin.
This is what you will get,
this is the price you pay for freedom.

Proletarians created,
each drone designed to do it's job.
Cutting down the vitality,
still the faith remains in place.

Lacerate the weak ones, 
generation of an army!
Lacerate the weak ones, 
desert them, they will believe your lies.
