Examples are placed on the board, 
each piece cut precisely.
They told us it will happen now soon,
we look and wait for it to breathe, wait for it..

Atmospheric sounds gather to incarcerate you,
still the noises linger.

Were they only just a warning for all of us?
This alluring yet despicable kingdom of greatness.

Was it a sign which we never understood?
Time will show it's true ability with dread.

This alluring yet despicable kingdom of greatness.

Arise, behold and notice that there is a transient belief in death.
