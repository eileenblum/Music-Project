Spread the infected in circles.
The clock is ticking around this failing human breeding ground.
This cursed race is destined to crawl in its own filth,
And scavenge the cure from the masses
Of the fallen.
Someday youâll never understand
Your days are numbered,
And then the day will come when u know
Your days are numbered.
After the evacuation of evolution
The sky will mourn the light away,
And there will be no survivors.
After the evacuation of evolution
The sky will mourn the light of day,
And there will be no survivors.
The clock is ticking..
