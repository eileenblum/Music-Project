The price of seduction, trapped but unleashed.
Fragile minds without pure conscious.
The price of seduction, trapped but unleashed.
Fragile minds without pure conscious.
They can never turn back.
These remains of mankind are sailing away.
Last look, nature's last look in to the sky,
Far away from the shore they used to call home.
They canât turn back.
This world is made for thieves, good man die like dogs
They can never turn back.
This world is made for thieves, good man die like dogs
They canât turn back
These remains of mankind are sailing away!
