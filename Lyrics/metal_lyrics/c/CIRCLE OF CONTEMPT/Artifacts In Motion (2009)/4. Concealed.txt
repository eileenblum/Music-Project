Paralyzed cadavers drowning in quicksand,
They will sink forever clutching their secrets.
With all the leaders, all the inside jobs.
(Hold your tongue)By trial and error
(Hold your tongue)our masters are still holding their tongues.
Pay no attention to the consequence of ages, the dreaded years of wrath.
Perfect covenants perfect propaganda lay on, on the hands of the self-deceived.
They will sink forever, find your captive strength and fight!
They will sink forever, find shelter underneath the arms of this circle.
