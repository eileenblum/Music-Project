The meek has now closed their doors;
Their screams keep penetrating through our thoughts,
Even though our hands keep around their throats.
Since this beautiful massacre,
Since they built this empire of insomnia.
But they only try to mesmerize and break away.
The time runs thin for redemption.
Our only need is to sacrifice our souls before the dawn.
Tomorrow we'll sleep all day.
There is no forgiveness, donât forget that you once closed those doors,
The time runs thin.
And remember we drew your chalk lines!
We are taking everything!
The time runs thin.
