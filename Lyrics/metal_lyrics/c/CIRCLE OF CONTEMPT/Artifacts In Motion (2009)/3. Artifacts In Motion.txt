These hollow resolutions can only perpetuate your fatal situation,
Agonizing self-inflictions permeating throughout.
The guns are assigned, Let the games begin.            
Programmed oaths of loyalty without inherent servitude,
Where the dignified and selfhood reign supreme.
The animus makes us what we are,
The treasons shows who we are.
Nemesis made us more beautiful than others
To conceal its own weakness.
The architect is abortive,
As are his children.
Infinite in its potential, and fragile in its design.
The guns are assigned, Let the games begin
