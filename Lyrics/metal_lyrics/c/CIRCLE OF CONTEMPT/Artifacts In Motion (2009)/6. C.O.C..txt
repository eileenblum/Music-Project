You all remind me of cancers, who burn every bridge,
Who are the center of all disrespect.
Now the truth has risen
From the chained book
That told you to be honest,
But it caught you red-handed.
Look into a crimson sky that is covered with shades of gray, which army has yet to come.
This tragedy is dragging you down on a one-way path,
There is no true escape, when fate has changed.
And another bridge is in ruin yet again.
This solitary requiem ends the battle in the streets,
By insulting your creator, you also destroyed yourself,
And now your own bridge burns to its own demise.
