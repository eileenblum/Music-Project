You taught us how to hate, now take our hearts apart.....
This is the way of the ancient,....
Blood sacrifice.....
Tear out your heart lay it down upon the alter.....
Repeating sins of culture,....
They sing songs of violence. ....
Look at them now they have stolen the truth,....
Look at us now forever enslaved.....
You taught us how to hate now take our hearts apart!....
Pay in Blood!....
Now Play in Blood!....
This is way of the winds,....
This is the price of truth.....
Now open my chest, but donât stitch the wounds.....
So look at them now and know this world is not yours.....
This is the way that it ends; the price of truth!....
I'll pay in blood to end this. (This is how it ends)....
I found my own way to love.....
