Turn around and lock your doors, this world is searching for its thieves.
Now look at the beautiful valley of Eden,
And witness the power of our casual destruction.
Burned and raided,
It did not talk, it did not scream.
Now this world has its own regime.
Cloaked in immense beauty and infinite ruin.
Motionless forever in time,
It feeds our fallen nightmares where we can hear it playing its last alluring song.
The nature will deprive us all without human rebellion.
We are now at the mercy of beasts,
As it was meant to be.
