I was born into a world with unstructured souls
I'm done to justify to the supreme.
Searching the way to be distinctive in a place that's deprived.
Forms are spread out within this collective consciousness.

I regain faith while the torment is scouring my insides.

Distinguish these thoughts from the rejected ones.
Collide the obstruction and deliver a solid path to find the ethereal place of my own.

The veil of this delusion has been torn, trying to reveal...

Subliminal threat grows inside these reflections we share.
The creation weakens but the core encapsulates in.
The veil of this delusion has been torn.
Trying to reveal the paradox in front of me. Trying to reveal the paradox.
