[Featuring Ville Laihiala]

Warcry like a thunder hums in your ears
Peace and silence of the past suddenly disappear
End of life, end of an era, crushed to conqueror feet
Burning sky is the sign when other nations bleed

The haven of your life, turns into flaming hell
Torturing and murdering, none left behind to tell
With the dawn of pain, they arrive across the seas
They are the disease, poisoning your future dreams

Conceited, unknown power watch ancient city wails
Isolated, surrounded by hatred, tainted with crucifying nails

The havoc is hiding behind holy sins on the sails
Noble glory covers the world by ornamental blood trails
Hate of a stranger lay upon your world
Convicted to vanish, they will kill you all

Run and hide, but this time you can't win
Everything different to them is a threat and a sin
You opened the gate and they came to take it all
Last sight is a groaning structure, a crumbling city wall
