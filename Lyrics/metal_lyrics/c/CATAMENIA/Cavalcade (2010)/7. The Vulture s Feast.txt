Through the windiest trail to the highest hill
Looking over shoulder, there's no one to see
Now my painful journey starts, it's soon to end
The way it's going to happen, I don't know just yet

Gazing down from the edge to eternity
Where the silence will comfort me in a forever sleep
Silence to creep into my sceptical mind
Should I take the step to go down into eternal peace

Close your eyes, lean over to reach your destiny

My body is only flesh, but the soul keeps on walking
Stuck in this moment, but still I am falling
Closer to my final destination, am I only dreaming?
Silent sets my mind at rest, though I am still screaming

This overwhelming pressure on my hollow chest
I need to shunt it off by any means necessary
Desire to free myself is greater than will to live
The solution for my pain is in death's embrace

Spread your arms, lean over to find your immortality
