As I walk through this wrecked land
The only thing that keeps me going
Is this endless pain and fear of death
I start to lose my faith and lust
All these years I've travelled by myself
With this curse that makes me hollow

I fight my way to the destination, there's nothing that will ever stop me
To survive through these evil times, I must keep my callous mind
A callous mind, a callous mind

I think it's time to end this journey
I must forget everything that I am
So close but still so far away
Feels like I'm walking blinded by dust
Small and sharp rocks underneath my feet
Leaves bloodstained marks behind me

I fight my way to the destination, there's nothing that will ever stop me
To survive through these evil times, I must keep my callous mind
A callous mind, a callous mind

To born, to live, to die, it makes me say goodbye
To see, to hear, to feel, it makes me feel unreal
To fear, to scream, to bleed, it makes me feel the greed
Now I should rest in peace
