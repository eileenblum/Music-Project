Secrets of wisdom buried for eternity
Too far for man to unveil and find
Around us written last signs of sanity
Too close because we are blind

The dust has set and silence cradles man into false peace

Evil within, symbolical endless rain
Wash in sin, the falling statues of pain
Crying saints, scrabble to shameful victory
Here they come, forgotten corps of misery

Fail of one became the destiny for all
Trail of gun makes mankind aegis fall
Broken heroes on the wings of history
Watching another sorrow's Cavalcade...

Fail of one became the destiny for all
Trail of gun makes mankind aegis fall
Broken heroes on the wings of history
Bleeding for the sorrow's Cavalcade

Tear down all the remains of honor, bear the memory of your brother

Now look back and tell us what you see
The dark is path, in the ruins it leads
Give up now, let the wounds of sadness bleed
Wipe away, shades of our memory
