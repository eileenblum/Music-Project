This is the time when everything feels cold
Nothing feels real, it's like a bad dream
Endless sleep, endless illusions
Only way out is to let it go

Expect no mercy...Expect no relief...
Expect no mercy...Get ready to die!

I give you nothing but pain and fear
Suffer you shall and hear you scream
I am the painful sting in your flesh
Only way out is to let it go

Expect no mercy...Expect no relief...
Expect no mercy...Get ready to die!

We're one step closer to the final call
Control my senses, behold my world
No more fear and fear no more
It is a moment, then it is all gone
Blood's getting thicker in your veins
I feel like I'd be the time and space
Time runs out and it is your time to pay
Slowly fade away, this is your last day - alive! Begone!

Hear the voice of the sharpening steel
Feel the coarse, cold blade on your skin
Cry for help, no absolution
Only way out is to let it go

Expect no mercy...Expect no relief...
Expect no mercy...Get ready to die!

We're one step closer to the final call
Control my senses, behold my world
No more fear and fear no more
It is a moment, then it is all gone
Blood's getting thicker in your veins
I feel like I'd be the time and space
Time runs out and it is your time to pay
Slowly fade away, this is your last day - alive! Begone!
