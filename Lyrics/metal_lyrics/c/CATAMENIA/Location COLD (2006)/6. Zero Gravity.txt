In Zero Gravity

Once balanced, once stable
Now broken and in pain
Caring nor hoping for nothing
Living in world of glass

In Zero Gravity

Emptiness taking all over
And nothing is making any sense
But I don't mind at all
Just trying to get more numb

Hollow inside, dead in mind
Tortured in ways no one has felt
Now soullessly wandering in pain
Still no feeling or caring

Just empty, broken passenger
Inside the counterflow of time
I close my eyes and let it go
I don't care no more

Hollow inside, dead in mind
Tortured in ways no one has felt
Now soullessly wandering in pain
Still no feeling or caring

In Zero Gravity
In Zero Gravity

Hollow inside, dead in mind
Tortured in ways no one has felt
Now soullessly wandering in pain
Still no feeling or caring
