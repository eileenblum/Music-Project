Here they come, the tides of coldness
On the waves, rides sons of darkness

Now it's time, to redeem bloody revenge
Wings of hate, shall carry out predictions
They take away, lands of ancestors
They make you pay, belch you to the lost

Bow before the Coldbound...

Torn of death, wipes away your future
Lay down blade, useless resistance
Final pray, face the hell of destruction
Forget life, approve your devastation

Close your eyes, feel us arrive with rage
Now we're here, standing at your gates
We take what's ours, we take it all away
We crush your soul and watch how you fall

Bow before the Coldbound...

Torn of death, wipes away your future
Lay down blade, useless resistance
Final pray, face the hell of destruction
Forget life, approve your devastation
