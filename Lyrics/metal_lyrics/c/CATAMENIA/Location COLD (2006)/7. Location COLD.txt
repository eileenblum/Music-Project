Where I am, it's so cold. I want to stay here
I am feeling so sincere. This is my place to stay
Search for the treasure untold. I want to face the fear
Only night, only dark. There's no absence on this way

Here I am, no more thoughts. Living inside of ruins
Nowadays I listen to my lord. Master of all creation
The one who said, the one who rules the world
No more things to say, this story never said

I want to live and die in...LOCATION COLD
Stories I heard from... LOCATION COLD
My past, my future is in... LOCATION COLD
Come to join with us in here... LOCATION COLD

My soul, my heart. Found the way back to home
The unchained, the only one. Nature so raw and pure
Hiding in noman's land is futile and pointless
Seeking for the place that never existed

I want to live and die in...LOCATION COLD
Stories I heard from... LOCATION COLD
My past, my future is in... LOCATION COLD
Come to join with us in here... LOCATION COLD

Fathers before me, they are all there
Waiting for you to enter their paradise

We want to live and die in...LOCATION COLD
Stories I heard from... LOCATION COLD
My past, my future is in... LOCATION COLD
Come to join with us in here... LOCATION COLD
