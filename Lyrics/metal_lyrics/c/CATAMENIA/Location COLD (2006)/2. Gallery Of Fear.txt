Wandering endlessly through the time
To explore fear inside of me
Neverending pain, neverending misery
Still searching for more

Observing, controlling, admiring the pure coldness

My mind is full of sickness
Seeking for the truth of pain
Dimensions after dimensions
Mind falling like vanishing rain

Observing, controlling, admiring the pure coldness

The more I search for answers
The more addicted I get
Trapped in my confused mind
No way out from gallery of fear

Like a fly in spider's web
Waiting for the end to come
Without salvation, without hope
No way out from cold fear

Die by illusions of unreal
Which is veiled on words of lies
Deceitful thoughts cross the line
And kill remains of heedless

Observing, controlling, admiring the pure coldness

The more I search for answers
The more addicted I get
Trapped in my confused mind
No way out from gallery of fear

Like a fly in spider's web
Waiting for the end to come
Without salvation, without hope
No way out from cold fear
