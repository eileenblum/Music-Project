Left alone to tragedies
Staining the soul, undivine
Things once dead came back alive
Nothing ahead and ghosts behind

I realize that I canÂ´t escape
ThereÂ´s no turning back
My past will haunt me
To the end of my life

I saw myself before the closed gates of hope

We didnÂ´t loose the faith, it lost us
All streams of life have turned into dust
We are left without any hope
And we are standing without fear

Erase this scenery
That I tremble before
Everything left empty
Dead skin holds the pieces inside

I saw myself behind the closed gates of hope

We didnÂ´t loose the faith, it lost us
All streams of life have turned into dust
We are left without any hope
And we are standing without fear

Left alone to tragedies
Staining the soul, undivine
Things once dead came back alive
Nothing ahead and ghosts behind

I saw myself before the closed gates of hope

We didnÂ´t loose the faith, it lost us
All streams of life have turned into dust
We are left without any hope
And we are standing without fear
