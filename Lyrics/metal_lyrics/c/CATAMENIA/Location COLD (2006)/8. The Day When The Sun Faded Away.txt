All I see is shadows and night
Four seasons turn into one
It's a cold and dark time
Fear grasp a hold of me

The whispers in my ears
They are getting stronger all the time
Moment by moment 'til end
All sources of light has gone

The last sunset is near
The sky is so dark and clear
It's time to end it all
I'll do it all by my own

The day when the sun fade away
The day when all light is gone away

All I feel is emptiness and fear
I'm fumbling in dark without a guide
There's no turning back, no return.
My soul is in forever burn

The last sunset is near
The sky is so dark and clear
It's time to end it all
I'll do it all by my own

The day when the sun fade away
The day when all light is gone away

All I see is shadows and night
Four seasons turn into one
It's a cold and dark time
Fear grasp a hold of me

All I know is I am dead
All is done, all is said
No more life in me
Just leave and let me be

The last sunset is near
The sky is so dark and clear
It's time to end, to end it all
I'll do it all by my own

The day when the sun fade away
The day when all light is gone away
