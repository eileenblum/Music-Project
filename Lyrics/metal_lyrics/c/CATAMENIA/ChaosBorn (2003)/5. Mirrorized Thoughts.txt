Leaves are fallen, times have passed by, pitch black moon stares from the sky
Coldness emerge with the night, im wandering in dreamland of my own mind

A silent, fading whispers haunts me
Am i dreaming again or is it there

Mirrored light blinding my eyes, can`t feel anything real, cant compromise
I feel nothing, sometimes i wish i was still unborn child

All these visions, all i have done, nothing makes sense anymore i must been paralyzed
All these visions, all i have done, nothing makes sense anymore, everything is gone

Darkness i feel, these shades with me
Broken fears, what is this dream
Is it my mind, making sensless cry
Give me a sign, to leave this pathetic life

A silent, fading whispers haunts me
Am i dreaming again or is it there

Leaves are fallen, times have passed by, pitch black moon stares from the sky
Coldness emerge with the night, im wandering in dreamland of my own mind
Slightly im beginning to remember my past life, so distant in my mind
So clearly i can see those times, fading away from this souls entwine

All these visions, all i have done, nothing makes sense anymore i must been paralyzed
All these visions, all i have done, nothing makes sense anymore, everything is gone All these visions, all i have done, nothing makes sense anymore, everything is gone
