Can it be more darker
Darker than your blackest mind
Can i or can it be seen
From the long distant far

Deep down in the void of soul
Soul cries for feed it`s hunger
Nothing, nothing more it needs
Only the way to the darkest relief

Discourage...
Way of no belief...
All is useless...
Without the control (of soul...)
