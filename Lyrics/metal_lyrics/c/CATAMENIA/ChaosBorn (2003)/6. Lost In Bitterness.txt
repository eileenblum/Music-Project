Your life is so narrow, so is your mind
You think you are something?...`cause you`re not

You live your bitter life day by day
Never reaching anything real, anything lasting

Im giving you chance to see the other side
Im giving you chance to fi nd your own mind
Im willing to guide you through these times
Im going to show you what is life without lies
Step out from light, so we can unite, to walk this path as one

Don`t pretend to be strong...`cause you`re not
You are weak from inside, unstable and blind

Im giving you chance to see the other side
Im giving you chance to fi nd your own mind
Im willing to guide you through these times
Im going to show you what is life without lies
Step out from light, so we can unite, to walk this path as one

`...It`s your time to realize...I?ll give you a sign...`

"No one hears you...you are silent as I
No one near you...you are lonely as I
No one sees you...you are invisible as I
No one needs you...you are ready to follow"

Your life is so narrow, so is your mind
You think you are something?...`cause you`re not
