I am the lightbringer...
I am the vizionaire of time...

Im watching the stormy clouds above the nightly sea
So far, so distant in my sight
Still so comfort refl ections for my mind

It was calm before the storm
When the hate in me was born
It was calm before the storm
As the world is completely torn

After the rain was end, i realized it`s not my time
To keep this gift i hold, let the storm take us all

It was calm before the storm 
When the hate in me was born
It was calm before the storm
As the world is completely torn
