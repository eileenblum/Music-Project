I am the fallen angel
Burst through the clouds
Scorched in the sky`s fire
Betrayed and deceived

I am the fallen angel
Looking for the revenge
No rest, no donation
Before punishment`s done

I wont be your heaven`s slave
I curse all with my anger`s blaze
Battle continues ti`ll my soul rests
Upon the highest and darkest mountain crests

I am the fallen angel
Feeling big sense of loss
Yearning for what used to be
This revenge I will never stop

I wont be your heaven`s slave
I curse all with my anger`s blaze
Battle continues ti`ll my soul rests
Upon the highest and darkest mountain crests

I am the fallen angel
Justice has done
Now i rest my dark soul
To beyond eternity

I wont be your heaven`s slave
I curse all with my anger`s blaze
Battle continues ti`ll my soul rests
Upon the highest and darkest mountain crests
