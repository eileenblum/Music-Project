Walking in this endless pain
Feeling lies on my way
My hands are tied by thy chain
I wanna hear no more, nothing to say

Darkness swallows my screams 
What are these rotten dreams
No one can hear my anger
My voice, a shining thunder

Dark lord uproot my name from my chest
I wanna be the begin of the rest
Make me the orphan of memories
Which fi nally sets me free

Will you be my fear`s shadow?

Watch them, nothing beyond eyes
Hear and enjoy as my blood dies
Cut my wrists with your sharp nails
This life, their souls, damned jails

Leave alone, if you can`t hear my voice
You aren`t, you`ll never have the choice
Dark presence save me from this hell
Leave me alone, why? I`ll never tell...

Dark lord uproot my name from my chest
I wanna be the begin of the rest
Make me the orphan of memories
Which fi nally sets me free

Will you be my fear`s shadow?
