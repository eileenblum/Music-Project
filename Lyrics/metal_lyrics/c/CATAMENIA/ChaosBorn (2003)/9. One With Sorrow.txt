She was daughter of sun, child of evil creation
She will tear the sky and earth apart
As the night shall become over us
When the path for heathens are marked

I admire her for what she could have done
How she could wipe us away
How she could set the world on fi re
To everlasting darkness

I can not hear, I can not see
Can`t understand my own believes...
I shall see, I shall feel
Another life, another existence...

Blinded by shadows she led us
To the path unknown, path of blood
Surrounded by silence, torn by the gods
She blinded our minds with false thoughts

I can not hear, I can not see
Can`t understand my own believes...
I shall see, I shall feel
Another life, another existence...
