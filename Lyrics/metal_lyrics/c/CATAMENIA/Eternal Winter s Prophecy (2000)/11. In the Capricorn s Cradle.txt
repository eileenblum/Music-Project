Oh, the divine ones
lo thy eyes on these flames
for eleven more times
I will spurn the light, I will burn herein this night.

And seeth the rise of a-man
the rise of the beast
and the fall of the light

[Chorus]
Aah...the night, embracing me thou winds by my side.
Aah...the night, feeling the night in the god`s throne...
a-night!

And the deeds done, one-three
here, god-forsaken, I forever bleed

And seeth the seed of the night
the one, bleeding
forever spurning the light

Oh, the heavenly ones
lo thy eyes on me
for eleven more times
I will be roaming this forever night

Seeth the fall of a-man
the fall of man-beast
the rise of the chaoschrist

[Chorus]
Aah...the night...
