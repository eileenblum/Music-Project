Burn your mind, that no one will find
turn your mind to the twisted kind
searching for the true belief
seeking, bleeding, is this all just a dream.

Answer is mine, answer is lie...
emotions, reflections, passing through your life
sweating, burning, cracking and thinking
what is the thing you should be twisting.

[chorus]
Let it all in, make no resistance
black thoughts are crawling deeper
why to battle against the stronger one
realize that you are one of us.

Deny the world, deny yourself
only hope is your lonely face
should I be me, should I be test
illusions of red, it`s pressing my chest.

[chorus]
Let it all in...

[solo]

[chorus x2]
Let it all in...
