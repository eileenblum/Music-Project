Through the damned halls of frozen north
I ride with silver dragons of Drakal
to make despair and spread sorrow
`cause then my dark kingdom will come.

I gathered with legions of thunder
in mountain of fallen stars
where no-man have been losted
and where evil takes it`s form...dragon.

[Chorus]
God`s of war...
masters of despair...
dragonlords of the skies...
rulers of mighty kingdom...

In crimson morning`s mist we battle
against whirlwinds of east.

[Chorus]
God`s of war...
masters of despair...
dragonlords of the skies...
rulers of mighty kingdom...

Way to perfect victory is bloody
armies fall under the king`s name
everything destroyed from the legions path
which is just forwarding towards...
