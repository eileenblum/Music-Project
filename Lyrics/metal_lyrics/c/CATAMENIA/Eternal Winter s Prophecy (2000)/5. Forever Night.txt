Blackhearted angel, open the gates for me
let me walk through the skies eternal.

[Chorus]
Embrace me with your flaming nightwings.
Together we will dominate and grow stronger,
so there`s no defeats for us.

Black souls, firestorms, lead us in this endless journey.
blizzard winds, creations of ice, make us immortal against the light.

We shall conquer and crush all our enemies.
This is the moment we have been waited, forever night at last.

[Chorus]
Embrace me...

Our visions and thundering words, those what we have spoken, became a truth as our victory agains feeble ones.
