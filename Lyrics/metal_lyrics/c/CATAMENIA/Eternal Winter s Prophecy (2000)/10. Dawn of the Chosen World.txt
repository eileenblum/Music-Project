Am I the chosen one
king of the darkest thrones
blessed with demons blood
which makes my way through the christian flood.

Am I the poisoned one
from the bite of serpent`s crown
marked with seventh fire
which makes my way to desire.

[Chorus]
Bury the sun into eternity
that dark shall come upon
hail the future for chosens
in the world of endless coldness.

Am I the seduced one
by the mistress of the night
lusting for bloodpath
take my arms and cut the veins with wrath.

[Chorus]
Bury the sun into eternity...

I am the chosen one...
I am the poisoned one...
I am the seduced one...
with these aspects, I take the control to this world...

[Chorus]
Bury the sun into eternity...
