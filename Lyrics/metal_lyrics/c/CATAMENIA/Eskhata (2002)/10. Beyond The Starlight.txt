Now when moon have went beyond the sun
I watch the dancing stars on the sky

Lightnings like fire...
Makes shape of eclipse for my eyes...
Burning the memories to my mind

Lunar space enlightening me
Spectral visions, dreams inside of me
Tranquil shapes of despair
Strenghtening me from inside
I hope that someday, I can feel
The universe like a starstorm through the sky
