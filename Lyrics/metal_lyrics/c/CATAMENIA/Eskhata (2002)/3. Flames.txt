Do you dare to follow me?
Into the place where you can see

What you`ve missed, what it could be
Can you taste it? Can you feel?
So many secrets can be revealed
Chaos of truth lives in here

There`s written the name of unknown
But can you handle what is shown?

I`ve been so many nights
So many years wasted away
Still I`m searching, maybe I`ll find
What`s been written in these stones of life

I made my mission, just show the door to you
It`s your choice, are you going to make it through
Thought of dark haunts you, flames of fear grown into
crossfire of souls, flames haunts you
