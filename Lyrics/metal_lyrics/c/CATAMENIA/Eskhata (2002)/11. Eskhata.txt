Time brings wisdom, time wrecks and destroys
Shadows come above the sky and takes one by one
Why did you forgot the things of it`s bringer
Although you rose on third day from the dead?

You promised us the new earth and sky
But you betrayed us over and over again, why?
You found us completely without a story
From the darkness our voices will be heard

Generations to the other, blood will be shed
World trambles slowly towards to it`s end
Voices of dark breaking the silence
And swallows the earth, the mindless

Who will not serve itself the master
Achieves nothing and will be forgotten
There is no use for the fear and pain
When you wake, you got thorns of power and strenght
