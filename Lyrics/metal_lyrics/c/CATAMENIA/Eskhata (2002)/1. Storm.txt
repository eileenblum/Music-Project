Now the faces that stood with me yesterday, are
convicting and pushing me away, sinner little smile
slowly turns to wicked laugh, bloody hands hiding and
wait another back...to stabb.

I know that you`re still there waiting. I see you all
there waiting, but I won`t allow myself to crush
broken this time. When day turns and night takes over.
Then begun the time of dark, and I let you all crush
broken tonight.

Look at me, look to your hunter, just take your time,
cause I...

Become the night, I see the fiery golden path, but I
wont allow myself to crush broken this time, the night
is torment, crushes all broken tonight, I see the
chaos realm, where raven retry to...reborn.

By the number you choose the side of your state...
