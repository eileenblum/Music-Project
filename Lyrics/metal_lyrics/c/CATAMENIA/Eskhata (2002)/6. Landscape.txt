Northern landscape
Calm freezing night
Demons in this black sky
The shadow ends or my life falls

Breaking out, chosen soulfire
And so essential
Now find the ending
All we shall rise

I saw the cries of dreaming me
I sacrifise
I saw myself in the
Romance of night

I call the life for me
Keeper of the lightnings
Surrounded by 
The night we`re living

I saw the cries of dreaming me
I sacrifise
I saw myself in the
Romance of night
The revelation never, ever shown
Romance of night, I am falling from sky
