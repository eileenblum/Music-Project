Emptiness surrounding me
Tearing me down, tearing me down
Dark like a black deep space
Voiding my soul, voiding my soul

Calmness raping my mind
Breaking my hope, breaking my hope
Endless fear of pain and tears
Shatters the dreams of reality

Life is a form of million moments
And every moment is closer to a death
Second by second drifting into torments
Time to face the final last breath

Resurrection, no more mortals
Desecrating life, desecrating life
Forces of darkness
Provocating to die, provocating to die
