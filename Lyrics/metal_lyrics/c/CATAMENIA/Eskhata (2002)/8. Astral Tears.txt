When watching the night black sky
Shadows of stars dancing their ride
I fall where is no place, no time
Everything seems like a endless night

I can`t feel no pain, no fear
All the former leave, disappear
Nothing I see and nothing I hear
All that`s there, just the astral tears

I sense where`s all our fears
Despite I can`t feel, no see
I know where`s all our tears
Going astral, deep inside me

The reason to stay is so great
Turning back is way too late
Beast`s claws are like a spears
All that`s here, just the astral tears
