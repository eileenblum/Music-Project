I came from shadows to take what belong to me
I turn this circle which makes me invisible
So when time goes on I can understand what is the meaning
To know the truth of existence, and how it makes everything possible

Call my name and you will see, how everything is not
what you see, material is only twisted distortion of your eyes
There is only one way you can go, if you want to
understand secrets of this coexistence...circle

In the eclipse you can find deep
Wormholes of lunar space, 
Those tranquil shades of spectral universe
Which confuses your shallow mind state
