Devilish cold surrounds me
Everything feels so untrue
Am I real, do I exist
Am I dreaming, do I dream...

Opened my eyes to see what I feel
Truth lies beneath under me
Trail of blood and trace of anger
Makes me continue my journey for free...

Follow the blood 'til the ravens scream
Then you know you've reached what you seek
Taste the blood 'til the wolves howl
Then you know you've reached what you bow...

The blood on the path that says
Follow right thru this way
Realizing that's just blood
Dripping from me, only from me

On my path...I've been there
On your path...I've been here
On this path...Have I been there
On this path...have I been here

There's no sense nor reason
Alone I am, and yes it is real
Path of circle, walk forever
Never will find a way out here...
