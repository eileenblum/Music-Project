Frost came and took your heart of darkness
You're lost, fear creeps in and let it start
Night cracks the spine of dying day
Fight but you can't make it go away

Fill your soul with ravenous fire
Kill the light and reborn for the light
End up times among the pathetic lies
Rise above the majestic life

Open mind for a newfound world
to be the part of our herd

Follow us, the heart of darkness
Follow us, no more mortal
Come with us, the heart of darkness
Follow us and you're free

Blind was the son who promised us the new kingdom
Died by our sins, but took away your freedom
The word was spread with inquisitions blades
Life for sale, they decided dying days
