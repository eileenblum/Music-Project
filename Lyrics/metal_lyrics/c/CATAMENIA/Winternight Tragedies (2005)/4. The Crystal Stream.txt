Struck is now the Sun, he's bleeding so hard
And tainting the sky, with this brand-new red dawn
Now slowly he just fades, fading into the night
Ravashed by the darkness, the dusk's purest of lights

Blood is now spattered, across the whole dark sky
Dusk shall now wash it, with darkness and with night
I watch him perish now, I see his slow demise
And smile toward the Heavens, for this great gift of thine

Thou art the one true queen
Mistress of the night
Sun's bloody slayer
His one true fright
Above the howling stars
Above the fiery Hell
You reign most supreme
With yours, the crystal stream

You, who now slaughter the day, and send your pale beams
Of madness and of pain, On ours, the feeble minds
Your sweet heavenly figure, as pale as the white bone
Lights through the black darkness, of the long sattered throne

And so you carry on, to conquer and to reign
Until the fallen Sun, shall rise yet once again
So your empires fall, your reign, it turns to dust
Your beauty and pale beams, are now forever lost
