Sun descents under the horizon
Here starts the time for darken
Time we're calling as Kaamos
Dark as deepest black

Warrior of the enlighten soul
Will go on for thee
I'm in haven, I am for free
What I've been to take me?

Gathering her children
All that time goes
Passing that chime
Fly high as one alive
Listening all lies
Mind of a freezing night
Goes all my life
Still passing by ... the Nocturne

Dark and black as deepest cold
Thoughts are here, were only hope
Warrior sacred, am I for free
Always for more, always for thee

Battle for one, battle for two
In crimson night I see all of you
'til I die I want to see
My hand will reach over the sea
