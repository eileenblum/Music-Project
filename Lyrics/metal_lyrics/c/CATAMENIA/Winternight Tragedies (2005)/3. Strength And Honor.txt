All my life been stared
Oh, the misery and pain
Finally I've stood and dared
Like I'd been here to stay

This is for neverending
No more weak to come
This is for journey for free
No more feel, no numb

...Wondering...near to me
...See in...too close to deal
...Dying...all but one
...Come in...soon to be me

All my life lies on trust
Oh, the luxurious lust
Is there a motion must
Like to be wind of dust

This is for strength and honor...

Maybe too good to be true
My doom is for you too
Always life comes for you
Death follows you soon
