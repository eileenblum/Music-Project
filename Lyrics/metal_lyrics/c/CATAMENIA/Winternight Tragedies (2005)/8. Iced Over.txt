Thru the thick bright ice
I see the thundering sky
Cold I feel on my skin
Move I can't, ice covering me

Thoughts crawl into my head
Wish I was soon to be dead
This pain what I feel
Is something that I can't deal

Please someone end this misery

All my life, like endless night
All my pain, go away
In my mind, I see I die
Only dream is what I see

Can't see the light of day
Feels like I'm passing away
Time became meanless
Fighting for a life is useless

Please someone end this sorrow

Waiting that sweet death
To end this sick nightmare
Come here to me to get
Now I'm leaving from here

Please someone end my life
