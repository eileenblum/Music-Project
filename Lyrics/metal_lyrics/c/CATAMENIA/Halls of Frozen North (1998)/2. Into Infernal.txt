Blaze of the night, flash of lightning
falls into shadows deep inside me
winds of winter, northern lights
summons the evil, dark as night.

Empyrean burns, angels fall
daylights gone, new ones born
bethel of heaven falls into decay
evil ones rise will be the way.

During the cold spells in winter
I emerge with fall of darkness
during the cold spells in winter
I endorse the endless life.

Damnation, blasphemy
defrost our destinies
extince of onesty
fades away like mortality.

He keeps the hands of god
making them lost
and praying for this one
'cause I...

I am immortal, mystical as isengard

I am the curse possessor of flaming torch

I am the throne observing and crucial...into infernal.
