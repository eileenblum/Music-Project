Growling in the night when the gromwell dies, hearing the whispering from the empty hall...diskies.

Coming from graves, from the night, when the shadows of the winter rises from the north...wind of sin.

Coming moonlit grimness when the dusk of child, nebulah winter rises from the sky...astral wind, astral winter, wind of lies, wind of sin.
