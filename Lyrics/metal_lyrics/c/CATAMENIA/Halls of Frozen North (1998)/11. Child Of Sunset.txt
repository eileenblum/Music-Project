I throw away my life
and try to touch the darkness
I watch the burning clouds
and the night falls inside me
I breath the storms of winter
and watch the light forever
burning sky calls the past winds
to wake me from insanity.

Light kiss the blindness
and saw child of sunset
shall the black winds
rise in darkness
where the red rivers burning fire...
fire make me burn.

And when the night goes down
then the child of sunset will coming...
And the shadows scream
when we will be together or alone...

I throw away my life
and try to touch the darkness
I watch the burning clouds
and the night falls inside me.
