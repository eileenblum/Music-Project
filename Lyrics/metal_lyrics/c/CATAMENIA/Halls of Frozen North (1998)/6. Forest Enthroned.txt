I am a night in to the darkness, only soul lost with me, I walk through the
night in to the forest and everything stays behind me, I'm waiting for another chance...it calls.

I capture my eyes, I wait for the end, I see the holograms of today, only soul with me I carry my shadow, and it calls my name...my name.

I see the light, my mind can't touch it, emperors name and the final thoughts, hearing whispering from my soul, I'm so cold inside but still it's a truth...whispering inside of me.

I touch my eyes, I'm dreaming for end, and enchanting woods is only a dream, I feel the sun my eyes will burn, for my soul I see anything.
