The centuries of madness, war and mayhem
One man's betrayal, the world caved in

Look the past of mankind, the kill of nothing
Two faced evil, you let it in.

So you all rule the world, with blood on your flag

Why I'd to be in man's forsaken dream
Terror rips my soul, the way we searched for road of bones
Why I had to see, all this misery
From the flesh and stones we built this road of bones

The dust you walk on is constructed by fathers
On their flesh and blood, we step with an honour

Madness comes where the truth lies
You ever wonder, where the road comes from

So you all rule the world, with blood on your flag
