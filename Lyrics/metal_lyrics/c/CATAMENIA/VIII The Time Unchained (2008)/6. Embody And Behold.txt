I try to seek, the path of lucidity
I'm like a drop of blood on a pale skin

My mind is dark so is my feelings for you
You better watch out, you cannot hide the truth

Embody and behold!

You'll teach me feel, but let me down
Turned to ice and let me wonder alone

I die alone in the place so dark and cold
There's nothing left to say, you'd better start to pray

Am I blind or am I dead?
Be my eyes and guide my soul
Is this true or is this dream?
Embody and behold!

I'm falling into the dreamspace
Drowning for eternal haze

This is the end, I know there's no return
I follow these steps of my shadow
