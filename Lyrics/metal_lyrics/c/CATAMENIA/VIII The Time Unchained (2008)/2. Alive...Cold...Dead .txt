Alive...cold...dead!

A life we called for was liberty to none
The vision we believed in was wasted, by gone
It's only a game mental awareness
It's surely a play someone to gain

A mechanical existence, devil's assistance
A mechanical existence, insignificant resistance
A venom needs, murdering breeds
We are the prime engines of great sadism
We! The slaves of material achievements
A venom needs, murdering breeds

Alive...cold...dead!

The meaning of our life has changed
Your passage to hell is already arranged
It's only a game, mental awareness
It's surely a play, someone to gain

Go! Alive...cold...dead!
