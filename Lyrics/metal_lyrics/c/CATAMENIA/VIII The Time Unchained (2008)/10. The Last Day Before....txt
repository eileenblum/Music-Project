When I am alone I hear a voice
It's calling for me to end this world
I try to hide from this dark task
It's a suffer for me, suffer you

Push it further, make me do it
Now I'm stronger, finally ready
Escape from reality
It's cemented, viciously rooted

Still so much unsaid,so much undone
Felt so cold and dead, under darkening sun
Tomorrow tears all apart

I'm kissing my invincible gun

This is the last day before...
The remorse, the extinction
The definitive, the end

No more control, no one to lean on
Silence is over, ultimate power
I'm taking over...

Your contempt, your mind of soul
