I am gone into sky of broken dreams
Never got myself to realize the pain I caused

Bleeding with the thought knowing that I am the one with the lost soul...

I've done things I'm not so proud of at all
Forgive me all I've ever done to anyone
It's all in my head, in my mind, processing
This is just my life, that I just have to carry on

Suffering with the thought knowing that I am the one with the damned soul...

Because I am the fallen one...no need to to take me down
I am the one with the curse and hate...would you ever take my hand
Though I'm the fallen one...see me, please do hear me
Please pull me out from this neverending pain...

I wish I would be a soulless, with no regrets
Day by day I follow the one road of emptiness
I do not know what the future brings aside
Sometimes I feel like fading away and gone

I am dying with the thought knowing that I am the one with the dead soul...

Bleeding, suffering, dying...
Bleeding for you...suffering for you...
I am dead to everyone!
