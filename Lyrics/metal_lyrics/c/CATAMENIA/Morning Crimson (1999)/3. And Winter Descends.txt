The hope turned to frustration
in the first night of the winter
a walk in dark forest
suffocates my own spirit
to break the cries of moon.

calmness turned to restlessness
in the first silence of winter
greedy thoughts and ego minds
are covered with shadows of lies.

The spells turned to curses
in the first storm of winter
lonely thoughts with endless fear
my night starting to fade out.

Calmness turned to restleness
in the first silence of winter
greedy thoughts and ego minds
are covered with shadows of lies.

The last mind was twisted
in the last days of winter
the souls couldn't scream
no they couldn't dream.

The hope turned to frustration
in the first night of the winter
a walk in dark forest
suffocates my own spirit
to break the cries of moon.

Calmness turned to restleness
in the first silence of winter
greedy thoughts and ego minds
are covered with shadows of lies.

The spells turned to curses
in the first storm of winter
lonely thoughts with endless fear
my night starting to fade out.

The hope turned to frustration
in the first night of the winter
a walk in dark forest
suffocates my own spirit
to break the cries of moon.
