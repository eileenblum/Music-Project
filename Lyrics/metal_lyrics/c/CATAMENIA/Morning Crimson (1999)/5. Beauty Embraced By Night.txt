Like a mist on moonlit sky
mystified the essense of light
glorified never satisfied
beauty embraced by the night.

The one that lived in darkness
was harmed by bright innocence
Then the twilight of life turned
into black velvet unfoldt.

Lonely whispers of night... hear me and guide

Once so glorious will be passe
away to the dark river of time
once so mightfull washed
by the cold stream of life.

Like a mist on moonlit sky
mystified the essense of light
glorified never satisfied
beauty embraced by the night.
