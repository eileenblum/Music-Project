Searching the truth in the forest
denying the story that believes in past
knowing there's something imposing to come.

Moon, you are my goddess
night, you are my hope
trees are the shades behind me.

Wolves, you are my courage
ravens, you are my sight
winds are the strength in my mind.

Frozen ground saves me from the past
close your eyes, look into the stars
feeling the truth coming out from the dark
suprised by the greatness of might
and I look for the forests of tomorrow.

Moon, you are my goddess
night, you are my hope
trees are the shades behind me.

Wolves, you are my courage
ravens, you are my sight
winds are the strength in my mind.
