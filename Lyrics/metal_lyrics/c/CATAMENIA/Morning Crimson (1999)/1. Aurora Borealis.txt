Silent Death is creeping in the night
while the burning sky gives hope
owls watching the dying wanderer
flames in the sky, freezing night

Why is the sky so bright at night
who put the flames in our lives... northern lights
winds are so cold and he knows the only hope
is to follow the flames in the northern sky

Guide me burning sky, guide me
kiss goodbye the freezing night
northern lights, will you take me
guide me burning sky, guide me

Why is the sky so bright at night
who put the flames in our lives... northern lights
winds are so cold and he knows the only hope
is to follow the flames in the northern sky.
