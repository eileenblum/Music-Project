It all started when the frost took the lakes
it all ended at the same time
it all lasted for a second or two
it all lasted for eternity...

I saw all the source of life fading away
the sun will forget to rise tomorrow.
Spending the rest of my time strolling in woods
I saw the moon crying again...

It all gave rise to wintry snowstorm
it all stopped the wind, the silence came in
it all blinded us, it all took the sight
it all was the vision of the last winter...

I saw all the source of life fading away
the sun will forget to rise tomorrow.
Spending the rest of my time strolling in woods
I saw the moon crying again...

It all started when the frost took the lakes
it all ended at the same time
it all lasted for a second or two
it all lasted for eternity
