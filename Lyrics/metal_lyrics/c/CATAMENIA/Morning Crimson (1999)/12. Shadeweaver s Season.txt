It is the shadeweaver's season,
the widowmaker's fall
and it takes no reason to tear you apart.

Cast a side your enlighted soul
I'll tell you story untold
throw away your mask so proud
I'll do it with or without.

As came the time shadows seize the day
without passion, life went on anyway
thought it should end, and my soul descent
on my throne of thorns, under crown of sin.

The convex tears of infinity, there wept
before dawn of time...

As came the time shadows seize the day
without passion, life went on anyway
thought it should end, and my soul descent
on my throne of thorns, under crown of sin
