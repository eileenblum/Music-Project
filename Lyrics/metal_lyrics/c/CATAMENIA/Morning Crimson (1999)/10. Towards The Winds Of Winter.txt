In the shadows with moonlight
beauty of darkness raped by the light
born where the flames never die
and falled in throne of night.

Shadows wandering over the land
with coldness they come among burning path
winds of winter so cold and dark
revel with storms in northern sky.

Dark waters flow away from Kamaar
to the eternal seas of frozen Sendar
dawn of freezing moon shall rise
in land of ravens and fallen light.

Black sun is rising from sky azure
infinite darkness cast the stars beyond
horizon of Sendar will burn in black
and died in frozen streams of Borda.
