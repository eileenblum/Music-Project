Burn it down.

You speak as though your words,
Were written into stone.
But paper pages burn,
Just as fast as they fold.

Placed binders on their eyes,
Transfixed on your disguise.
Theyâll curse all you lies
With no kingdom to behold

We do not seek the sheep,
Weâve come to slaughter your shepherds
Drag you down from the pulpit,
To burn at the stake.

Woe to you false prophet
Thou shalt not bare false witness
Thou shalt not judge
Lest he be judged himself

Youâre gonna pay hard for this one
Iâll see you in Hell

Free these shackles of our hands
Let us live as free women and men
Til the light shines on us again
Til the light takes us again

Weâll hunt you down
Until the bitter end
Reduced ashes
Until thereâs no trace of you left

Weâll hunt you down
Until the bitter end
Reduced ashes
Until thereâs no trace of you left to burn
