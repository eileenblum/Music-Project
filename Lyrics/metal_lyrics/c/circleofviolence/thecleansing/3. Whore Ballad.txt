Your face on vulgar display,
Degradation for profit.
Put a price on your dignity,
At least you'll be getting paid.

You're gonna be somebody now.
They're gonna make you a star kid.
Go make your daddy proud.
Now open that pretty mouth.

You little whore,
Be what you are.
Off your high horse,
To you knees once more.

All praise the self righteous courtesan.
Bow down at her filthy feet.
In all her self loathing indignation.
All hail the Harlot Queen."
