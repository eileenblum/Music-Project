The Black Crusade, Marches on,
Til streets of gold run red with holy blood.
To Heavens gates, we'll lead the charge.
Paradise will once again be ours.

Your lies strike hearts into awe,
Tonight we shall end it all.
The Memoris of your kingdom become,
Ashes beneath our feet

The Black Crusade, Marches on,
Til streets of gold run red with holy blood.
To Heavens gates, we'll lead the charge.
Paradise will once again be ours.

I can see it. Victory is near.

Lightening tears across smoke filled skys.
Fire and hatred be our guide.
Feed on the fear in our enemies eyes.
Their screams be drowned by our battle cry.

The Black Crusade, Marches on,
Til streets gold run red with holy blood.
To Heavens gates, we'll lead the charge.
Paradise will once again be ours.

Ill see your crown, cast upon the ground.
Ill squeeze the life from your beating heart.
As i piss on your bleeding corpse.
This throne is no longer yours.

No more. No more.
We shall bow no more.
