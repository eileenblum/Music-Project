We tread across green meadows,
Through the 7 gates.
The dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity.

To where the serpentine stands,
Watch as it coils its tail.
Now we begin our descent,
Into the lower circles.

The violent tempest, 
Tears away their flesh.
The winds of destruction, 
They shall never rest.
For tempter and temptress,
Their fate is this.
Torn from side to side,
From this storm no one can hide.

Cerberus, Cerberus, Cerberus.

The great wyrm of gluttons,
Tredges through this bog.
Where the blinded masses,
Pay the debt of their excesses.

Freezing rain, noxious sludge,
Mighty Wyrm, consumes all.
Freezing rain, noxious sludge,
Cerberus, consumes all.

Then i saw the greedy ones,
Those who squandered all they sought. 
With he weight of all their gold,
Bound forever to their souls.
Where in life stacked wealth so high,
Buried beneath cry.

Wrathful hands grasp for Charons ship,
As we cross the black waters of Styx. 
Now the darkness closes in,
We have reached the walls of Dis.

Oh city of heretics,
Guarded by the damned.
The foul stench guides us in,
We now ride the Phlegethon.
Oh river of boiling blood,
Guide us to our Home.

We are Circle of Violence,
Join us in blasphemous song.
We are the Circle of Violence,
Join us enemies of God.

We are the Circle of Violence,
We are the Circle of Violence,
We are the Circle of Violence,
We are the Circle of Violence.
