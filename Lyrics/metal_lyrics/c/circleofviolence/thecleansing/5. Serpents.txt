Close in the serpents of woe,
Coiling around your throat.
Choking out any semblence of hope, 
Calling nightmares to surround your soul.

There will be no dawn

Alone you're screaming.
Of horror you're dreaming.
In terror you sleep
You'll never be free

All that lies you before you is true pure insanity.
Blinding fear and carnage as your eyes can see.
Holding your head you tremble and collapse to your knees.
And then only deafening laughter as you scream

Alone you're screaming.
Of horror you're dreaming.
In terror you sleep
You'll never be free

I call for blood.
