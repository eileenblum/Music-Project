Would you?.. be satisfied in Heaven!?
Without the One who saved you?
I pray.
God have mercy on your soul!
GOD have mercy on your soul!
I PRAY!
God have mercy on your soul.

Why!
Do you treat the cross like a prostitute?
And purvey a false gospel?
You'll gain the world but lose your soul.

You're not a Christian!

You're nothing close.

Selling only what looks good!
You call it prosperity, but you're wrong.

You have forgotten
(YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN!)
The salvation that came.
You have forgotten
The Cross, the salvation that came.
No man can earn it.
God is the only reason you're saved.
You have forgotten
The Cross, the salvation that came
No man can earn it.
God is the only reason you're saved.

Your prosthetic happiness will never be enough.
It's purely greed and lust!

You're an impostor!

You'll only reap corruption!
I'd rather die than lose my soul.

You're not a Christian!

I'd rather die than lose my soul!
