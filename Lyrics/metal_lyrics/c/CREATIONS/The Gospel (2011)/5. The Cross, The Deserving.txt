We Crucified him!
Every crush with every sin.
Forsaken, crushed!
For our iniquities.

I weep in fear for the souls of those who will not hear!
There pride keeps them from truth, and so this message Iâll scream, desperately!
For the ones who by Godâs grace may be saved, desperately desperately.

He who knew no sin became sin for the glory of God.
Like a lamb led to the slaughter!
He died!
It was only by Godâs mercy and grace.
He died!
Daily we spit in his face.

We crucified him, every crush with every sin.
Forsaken, crushed!
For our iniquities!

This amazing grace was not the sweetest of sounds, the day He died for the wretches we are.
So pick up your cross, repent of your sin, or for your iniquities you will be crushed.
You will be crushed!

He who knew no sin became sin for the glory! of God.
Like a lamb led to the slaughter,
He died!
It was only by Godâs mercy and grace.
He died!
Daily we spit, but he did it any way

I WEEP IN FEAR! for the soul who will not hear, for the heart with the deafened ear.
Tremble, for God is just and holds the whole world in his hands.
He is holy and righteous he holds the whole world in his hands.
Tremble, for my God reigns.
My God reigns.
