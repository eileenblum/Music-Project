For the time is coming where people will not endure sound teaching.
But having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to seek their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.
Many will follow their sensuality and because of them, the way of truth will be blasphemed.
In their greed they will exploit false words to their condemnation from long ago is not idle.
And their destruction is not asleep.
But as for you, teach with accords of sound doctrine.
For Jesus said repent.
And believe the gospel.

WE ARE CALLING OUT!
Lets get back to our first love.
We have wandered off into myths.
Let us return to the cross.
This is a call for discernment!
