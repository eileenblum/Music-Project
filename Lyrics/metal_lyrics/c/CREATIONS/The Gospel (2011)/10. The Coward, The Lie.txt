My heart cries out,
May my voice be heard.
May my voice be HEARD!
Run Run away
From those who will not preach the gospel.
They do not speak the truth their only goal is to tickle your ears!

They are Godâs judgement on a people who only want what their carnal hearts desire.
Wanting the kingdom without the king.
But when the king brings judgement
You will find they were so good at lying!

They had themselves deceived.
You canât have the kingdom without the king.
You canât have the kingdom without the king.
Without the king!

How dare you treat my God as means for gain.
Iâm disgusted by what you call Christian.
You have no authority; you have no right to tell my God what to do.
Repent or on the judgement day.
Youâll see his face on the battleground!

For the day of judgement will come.
And if you do not kneel a rod of iron will break your knees!
Found guilty!
Found guilty!
A rod of iron will break your knees
Found Guilty!
