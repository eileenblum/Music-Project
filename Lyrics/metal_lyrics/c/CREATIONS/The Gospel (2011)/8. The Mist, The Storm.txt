Waterless springs!
And mists driven by a storm!
For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved.
Secretly they bring destruction,
Deceived they bring corruption!

They speak heresies!
Even denying the master.
They bring swift destruction upon them.

Secretly they bring destruction,
Deceived they bring corruption!
Their condemnation from long ago
Is not idle.

With greed they exploit you with false words.

They promise you freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption!
Beware of false teachers; they are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm!

They will not preach repentance.
They defile the cross, and prostitute grace.
Do not be so easily snared.
Destruction follows with them.

Destruction follows with them.
Follows with them.
Destruction is coming for them.
Itâs coming for them.
Destruction
