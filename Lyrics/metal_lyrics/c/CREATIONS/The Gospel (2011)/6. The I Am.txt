How can I profess!
The holiness of you oh God.
Oh how glorious, you are majestic in all your ways.
You are seated high above.

I am now found here on my face.
I wish to give you everything,
GIVE YOU ALL OF ME!
I see now that a wretch like me can never make it on my own!
My sin oh God, take it from me.
Holy spirit, make me more like Christ, for this is the only way to please you oh God,

Holy spirit, make me more like Christ, for this is the only way to please you oh God

May you be glorified in your people.
May you be marvelled among all who have believed.
A transformed mind tells me you are my victory.
My delight is in you, God!

Oh how glorious you are!
Oh!

You are majestic in all your ways!
Seated high above, oh how glorious you are.
