You say that you are rich you have prospered and there is nothing that you need.
But you are wretched blind and naked!

Everything you have can be taken away!
In an instant

You sit in Godâs hands whether you like it or not.
So repent hell-deserving wretch, repent!

God knows your works and you are neither!
Hot nor cold!
Because you are lukewarm he will spit you from his mouth!

Everything you have can be taken away!
(AWAY!)
In an instant

You will be drained hanging upside down
Your gold will spill like blood.
Instead of perfume there will be rottenness.
The stench of your corpse will please the Lord

You will be drained hanging upside down.
Your gold will spill like blood.
The stench of your corpse will please the Lord!
Your gold will spill like blood.
