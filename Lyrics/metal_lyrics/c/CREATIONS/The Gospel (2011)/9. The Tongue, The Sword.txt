You liar!
You snake!
Your words are poison and Iâm sick of your FACE!

[X2]
You walk around and devour the weak.
You wear their skin like clothing
Youâre a wolf! And every one should know.
You're a wolf, and everyone should know.

I pray God tears your tongue from your mouth so you will never be able to speak again.

This fight you picked out will be the end of you

You can kill me!
Use your defiled mouth and speak against me.
But your decrepit attack
WON'T HOLD ME BACK!
I will speak the truth until the end.

But for you
BUT FOR YOU
A lake of fire AWAITS!

You wolf!
You wolf!
YOU WOLF!

Youâre a liar and a snake and Iâm sick of your face!
Youâre a liar and a snake and Iâm sick of your face!
You wolf!
You wolf.
