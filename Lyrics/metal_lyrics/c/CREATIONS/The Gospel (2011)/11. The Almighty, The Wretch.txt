God is holy, righteous and just.
He sits above everything.
Sovereign! He reigns!
Everything sits in his perfect will.

You can run from him, you can hide.
But itâs only by his grace that youâre alive.
There isnât one who deserves this life.
We have all been born sinners!

No one is righteous all have turned aside.
The wrath of God is all we have chosen.
Hell is our birthright!
Jesus lived the perfect life but he laid it down and died.
He became our sin hung on a cross, to save those who God chose, from the beginning.
Repent and believe the gospel.
Oh Jesus is the only hope.
Only hope, God is holy, righteous and just.
He sits above everything.
Sovereign! he reigns
Everything sits in his perfect will.
Soli deo Gloria.
(soli deo gloria!)
Gloria
Gloria
