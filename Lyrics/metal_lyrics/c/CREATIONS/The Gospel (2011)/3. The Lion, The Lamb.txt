A cross doused with the blood of Christ.
Shed for those who he would save, by grace alone! So no man can boast.
By grace alone!
Will you turn from your sin?
Your depraved state of mind and repent, or will you die and only wish you had?

Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price for his life.
In his great mercy.
God intervened!
To put Christ forward!
As the propitiation of Godâs own wrath.
Godâs own wrath!

A cross doused!
With the blood of Christ!
Shed for those who he would save.
A cross doused
With the blood of Christ.
With the blood of Christ!

Christ absorbed the curse!
That we deserved, by grace alone!
Alone!

God in his majesty, in his sovereign will, sent his son to the earth so that he himself would bare our sin in his body on a tree.

God breathed out the universe, out of dust he made man.
THIS IS THE GOSPEL!

Man rebelled! walked away from God!
Only deserving wrath.
THIS IS THE GOSPEL!

God came down to earth on a cross became the final sacrifice for sin.
THIS IS THE GOSPEL!

Now a wretch like me may be saved to live again.
This is the gospel.
