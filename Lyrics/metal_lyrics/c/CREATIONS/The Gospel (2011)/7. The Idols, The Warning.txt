The words I have to speak, are not easily heard.
But I will preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.
While so many are comforted behind closed doors.
Success and money
It's lust and idolatry
They worship their whores!

Open your eyes!
They stand on a stage telling God what to do.
Telling you to be you!
Open your eyes!
God answers to no one.
God answers to no one!

The heart is deceitful and wicked so donât be easily tricked, when a man says God is the slave to him.
Itâs all a lie.
They have forgotten the saviour, and they serve their own flesh.
It must die

For God is not concerned with just this life.
You will surely die.
For your soul a price must be paid.
A price must be paid!

And it was either Jesus on the cross or the day you die
Hell awaits!
For your soul a price must be paid.
(A PRICE MUST BE PAID!)

So donât be easily tricked when a man says God is the slave to him.
Itâs all a lie.
They have forgotten the saviour, and they serve their own flesh.
It must die!

Open your eyes.
A price must be paid.
Open your eyes.
For your soul is at stake!
