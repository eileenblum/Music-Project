Religion has killed what once was love, and turned it to idols and nothing more
than scheduled prayers and empty words.

You are better than this, God you deserve so much more.
All You want is intimacy with me, thatâs why You gave everything.

Daily convict me of my routine. I need you to be more than a pulpit on Sunday.
I desire to give more than a song.... Is this all that you have become?
A plastic Jesus I wear around my neck, paste on my car or wear on a shirt.

No I will not stand by. This is for the Church of Christ. The ones that call
themselves the Body.
Burn your plastic Jesus. You will stand naked before God.
Burn your plastic Jesus. You will stand naked before God. And all else will
fade away.

We stand before You today, with all else stripped away. Take all of me, let
nothing else remain.
We stand before You today, with all else stripped away. Take all of me, let
nothing else remain.
We stand before You today, with all else stripped away. Take all of me, let
nothing else remain.
