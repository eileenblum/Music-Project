If God is for me then who can be against me.

You can never stop this work in me. The word of God stands forever.
You can never stop this work in me. The word of God stands forever.
Bring your fire, throw your stones. You can never stop this work in me.

The Lordâs hand is upon me. The same hand that gives us life and created all
things.
We will rise up and say we will be the chosen ones.
This is the place, now is the time. We will rise up and say we are the chosen
ones.
Rise up. Rise up. Rise up and say we are the chosen ones.

All hell get on your knees, cause every knee will bow 
and every tongue confess: Jesus is Lord.

Hell you tremble at the name we carry. Thatâs right, you should be on your
knees.
We have come to gain more ground, get on your knees.

Hell trembles at the name we carry. In the name of Jesus, shake, get on your
knees.

In the name of Jesus, shake, get on your knees.
