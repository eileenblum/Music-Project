You blackened your windows... you coward.
Youâre like a candle without its wick, what is your purpose?
What does a lighthouse without its light accomplish? Please tell me this.

If everything inside knows weâre called to illuminate Christ, then what are we
waiting for?
Stand up, get up, itâs time things change. Ignite, weâll draw the masses with
our flames.

The whole world is waiting, un-tint your windows. We are a lighthouse. Shine
forth.

The Kingdom of God is yearning. We will stand for our King. 
We will stand for our King. We will stand for our King. 
We will stand for our King. We will stand for our King.

Our battle has already been won and so we stand before You today.
Lift high the name above all names.

All chains break loose. All chains break loose. All chains break loose... Let
go....
