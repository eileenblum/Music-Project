I saw a dead man walking, buried just three days ago...buried just three days
ago.
This man that can heal the blind and set the captives free.
I heard He died for us on a broken tree. I once was the dead but now Iâm alive.
I once was dead but now Iâm alive. Now Iâm alive.

For God so loved that He sent his Son to die.
I have a reason to live, it is no longer just I.
If He could do it back then He can do it today.

Oh Lord, the heavens shake when we cry Your name.
The gift of God has captured our world.
Stand and embrace the power of this moment.
The King of Kings, the great and mighty!
We choose to meet You, face to face.

We are the healed, we are the redeemed. Set free, we are free indeed.
We are the healed, we are the redeemed. Set free, we are free indeed. Amen!
