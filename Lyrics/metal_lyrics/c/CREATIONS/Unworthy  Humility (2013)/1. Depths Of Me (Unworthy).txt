I can hear you screaming  âWhy must you Persecute me?â Flesh ripped from your back the pure and spotless lamb hanging like meat This your glory Blinding me. sacrifice to resurrection now defining me I am a murderer Search the depths of my heart Black empty with an altar Built for an idol of me I've tried so hard there are just some things on my own i cant let go and even you'd be surprised at the filth that was in my head Your resurrections brought me, new life, and in this i am no longer defeated, my heart was dark so very dark I was the chief of corrupted flesh My throat an empty grave I denied the Father spit at the son Justice awaited me  I can hear you screaming  Why must you Persecute me Flesh ripped from your back sacrifice to resurrection now defining me But I have done so much wrong, my heart is full of bitterness and hate, this my guilt like shackles to me Hold me, hold me back, its all my mind seems to do to myself, when i constantly let this guilt dictate that i am Unworthy I see myself as unworthy But in real life You have made me son.
