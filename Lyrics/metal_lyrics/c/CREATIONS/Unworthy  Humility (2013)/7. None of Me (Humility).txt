I am the perpetuator
I am the one clinging to dead weight
Up until this point on time
In the back of my mind

I thought I was the catalyst
The physical driving force behind the initial push
Without me would anyone even know who you are?

Oh how false my thinking was
For there is no one good
We all hide evil in our hearts

I've lost touch as I watch every fault,
Every failure replay in my mind
Teach me humility

More of Christ and none of me

I had made this life about me
Thinking the whole time
I was on the road for ministry
But I had even tricked myself
Through my ego I secretly wanted the glory all to myself

Jesus, you are the catalyst
You are the only reason anyone exist
All glory be to god
For anything good in this world
Has nothing to do with me

I couldn't do what you did on my own
I couldn't live as you lived on my own
Where I have failed you Jesus have conquered
Teach me to be more like you
I am aimlessly lost without you

Teach me humility

I was the perpetuator
I was the one clinging to dead weight
So hang upside down the cross with two beams
'cause my blood could never bring
The redemption of anyone's sins

More of him and none of me
More of you Jesus Christ and none of me
