[feat. Dean Atkinson]Possessed by the voices in my head that Crept through my heart full of envy I am your perfect son I am the righteous one No one can prove me wrong, My opinions held higher than the throats of the ones i slit to bring forth the schemes in the darkest depths of my heart. Iâve done it all, I've done it all My works for the world to see Who are you, Who are you to correct me. Oh Son of man Iâll tear your kingdom down As long as my empire stands Corrupted from birth By sin and society With A heart of stone I lash out Corrupted I have blood on my hands We have blood on our hands Death is Gods Justice I have done nothing but spit in the face of Christ Full of pride with the stench of filth, on my breath Ill-deserving, Forgiven from my sin with Blood shed my slate you cleaned Irresistible, your grace delivered me And broke my heart of stone This heart of stone that was giving to me by this world  i once called  home.      So I deserve the justice for my sinful ways. But as for me I will take it with a grain of salt,Cause i cant see the means to that end, so ill use His grace to justify the way Ive been acting.Ive been wondering in and out of consciousness, Ive been searching for you with a bottle in my hand. these words of uplifting just come so easy to me, But the actions i take not even I understand I am the very state of corrupted in thought, I am the one who lead you all to believe and than got caught.God is there any point to know if you are still there, It shames me to know that through the past 6 months you actually care.
