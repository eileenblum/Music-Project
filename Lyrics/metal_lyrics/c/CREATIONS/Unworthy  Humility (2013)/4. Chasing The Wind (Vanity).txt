Our Control is out of our control, is out of our control, is out of our control. why do we hold on, when its out of our control, its out of our control. Selfishness, runs ram-pit in my brain, it holds on to everything, trying to sustain the life it wants to lead. the only problem is, that's the most damaging part of me.unmask this, side of me that holds on to sexual immorality Unmask this, side of me that holds on to the lies the hate and the deceit I have hidden it, behind a dark mask of control that leads me down an empty road take it, take it, the only good in me is you Jesus Christ Take it, even though i know how humiliating it will be,What is hidden in the dark, shall be brought to the light What can  i compare to the beauty of your humility, that of which only can be made equal to when complimented by your Grace, that comes when i wear this selfishness so defiantly as a coward with a mask on my face. But i desperately held on to everything, everyone around me i tried to control the outcome of every circumstance that life brought my way. The money, the stress, the worry never seems to melt away as  i denied your every offer to take these burdens away. chasing the wind, chasing the wind, its all vain without Him, I am chasing the wind, chasing the wind, its all vain without Him Deny yourself, pick up your cross and follow Christ If you, try to, hang on, to your life, you will loose it, but if you, give up your life, for my sake, you will save it. If you, give up your life, for my sake, and, for, the sake of, the, good news, you will save it.
