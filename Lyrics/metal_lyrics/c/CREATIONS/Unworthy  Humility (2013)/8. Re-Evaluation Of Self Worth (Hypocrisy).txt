Did you think this through? did you? Did you think this through before you opened your mouth? always casting blame. the words we speak are so condescending all we do is tear each other down, so who are we to question what is fair in a world we had no hand in creating. All we do is step on the weak, and now the world is the spitting image of us,It is shameful to think we have been given this all for free  and some call it a disease but if we as Christians go around pointing out each others flaws when will the body get built up, A house divided against itself will not stand, and i can see the walls crumbling in my hands We need unity Why am i so obsessed with the speck in my brothers eye when I have yet to dislodge the plank from mine I cant see past my own self glorifying desires long enough to realize that pointing out hypocrisy is like putting a mirror in front of myself.  On the gossip bandwagon again no one needs someone to talk about them, they know every mistake that they've made, what we need is Gods love and compassion and  To help pick each other up when we fall Unworthy is what I was but faith humbled me to your throne My mistakes are many but Lord your blood has washed me and made me whole God you are all that matters, let your presence be made known Lord help me to be an example of you instead of the reason they don't believe
