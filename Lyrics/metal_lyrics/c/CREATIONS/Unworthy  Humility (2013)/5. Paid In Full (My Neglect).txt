[feat. Michael Foss]We must pay  more careful attention, therefor, to what we have heard. For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, how shall we escape if we ignore such a great Salvation?What have I done to attain this great and confounding gift.I was  the vile Poison compared to your Holiness In light of this infinite Glory, I was the black spot on the sun.  I was the infinitely Damned Living a life of ignorance To the point of death while Claiming bliss Only makes you the fool It only made me the fool Who woke up on the other side Of my death bed Haunted by the life Iâd led I ignored the warning signs. I disregarded the tug of the current the water eroded the sand from beneath my feet unbeknownst to me, the undertow took my foundation from underneath me I drifted on account of neglect Ignorance is a choice To ignore is to choose Focus your heart and your mind on Jesus Christ claim to know nothing but Christ and Him crucified Darkness floods the light when all you do is Look away Hating every word they say I have my own brain So Iâll fill it With every selfish motive Until I kill whatâs left We will kill whatâs left Of hope So I look back And itâs more than a beating He took for me I deserve death But itâs more than life That he gave for me I will suffer We will all suffer My sin condemns me And Jesus died to set me free I have drank the poison i was given the remedy, and i just set it on the table and i walked away Its a matter of time, and its ticking, ticking away My life's an hour glass and its ticking, ticking away To ignore is to choose We must pay  more careful attention, therefor, to what we have heard, so we do not drift away. For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, how shall we escape if we ignore such a great Salvation? I thought i was better off, with out you my neglect of the gospel sent me on a for sure course to ruin, We need your salvation To escape the undertow, you have to live with the consequence To escape the undertow, you have to let it drag you to the bottom
