All we have Empty words Thatâs all I am to you A promise and no outcome I am the abyss The empty sea incapable to predict and rely on Empty words Thatâs all I am to you A promise and no outcome I am the abyss The empty sea incapable to predict and rely on We are all worth nothing If there is nothing of a higher grounds to stand upon We are all falling We are all worth nothing Except the price in the eye of which beholds us Lost in the perversion Of glory We will always walk in circles With our eyes forever set on âmeâ To our demise We are falling in This great ocean of Self centered liberty I am on my own  I am the abyss The empty sea Who needs filling I am everything the eye can see but hold's nothing I am the abyss There is a great divide a cavernous hole inside me There is a great divide a cavernous hole inside Fill it with words, no fill it, only you have more than words to give us I am a man clutching a golden crown rotting from the inside out rot my disgrace rot over time numb from the emptiness my pride is causing decay All this time i have made empty promises and put hearts in graves. I have taken something so meaningful to me and used it for something meaningless All we have are words Hopeful words that's what i am to you, a promise you kept with forgiveness as an outcome, I am the abyss, the raging sea, but you awoke and calmed the angry storms inside of me With your eyes you gazed upon my heart and saw the depths of which were desperate and dark, where there once was a hole i tried to fill with anything but it only brought guilt, Jesus where the world saw a price that was too great, you saw a debt that we could never repay just so my empty words could be filled with the love that was  a promise that  you freely gave. Jesus where the world saw a price that was too great, you saw a debt that we could never repay just so my empty words could be filled with the love that was  a promise that  you freely gave.
