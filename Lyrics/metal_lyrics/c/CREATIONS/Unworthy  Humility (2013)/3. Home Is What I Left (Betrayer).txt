[feat. Brook Reeves]I feel like i turned my back on everything seeking my dreams I can hear them screaming at me I hope everyone is listening Home is where I left you I left you without a tear in my eye for a calling at least i wanted it to bebut my lust kept in and choked out its lifeI am the betrayer       I am the one with my back turned     How can I say that I care about God     When I leave every one else to die     Supplier Every one look at me While I sacrifice everything  By the means of my family Is this really what this book is teaching  To become so cold   With no shoulder for tears to fall on  Am I really supposed to be So hard that the love that saved me Canât penetrate Not even skin deep I, have been brainwashed into thinking that because i have a passion i should run with it, but  when did listening to the voice of God get put second to what i thought i wanted. Blinding, every rush every sway of the wind our moods are swinging. as we run to the next feel good sense of having purpose. I am the betrayer       I am the one with my back turned     How can I say that I care about God     When I leave every one else to die    I Have taken, the focus off of God Bring it back, Bring it back to Him For my passion should be placed in Love I am the fool I hope everyone is listening My only hope is God Iâm coming home.
