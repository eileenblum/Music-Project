I was born on wasted ground
And I'm damned to be alone
I have seen such awful
Always on my own

I long for silence
I'm facing the wind

Used to fight the god of storm
Couldn't break his heart of stone
I looked for the promised land
Always on my own

I need silence
I'm facing the wind

And the storm rages on and on
Tonight I will descent for the last time to see
It's a war that can't be won
All my blood will be spilled on just one day
We'll find salvation and freedom for all.

Sailed across the seven seas
I have seen the trees of hope
All my memories fade away
I am all alone

Still need silcence
I'm facing the wind

Now my book of life is closed
I have reached the end
Don't forget my don't lay
Your fate in other hands

I found silence
And you face the wind
