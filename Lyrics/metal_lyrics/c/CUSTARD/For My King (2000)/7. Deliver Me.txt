I see you standing there, like a painting
When I realize you're not here heart starts aching
Some time, somehow, somewhere I'll find a way to carry on
But now I feel just pain and fear, oh god what have I done

What can I do - I cry
Cannot live, cannot die

A promise it's forever - just a lie
(we) said we stay together - just a lie
some time, somehow, somewhere I have to find a life without you
but memories can't disappear, you know that I still love you

What can I do - I cry
All I have to do, is to say good bye

[Ref:]
Deliver me (let me) out of your heart
I don't wanna be always a part of you
I can't endure more sorrow and lies
Deliver me, I pay the price of love

Time is passing by - I'm still alive
My tears for you are dry but it still hurts
Maybe you feel now like I felt, you see me in your dreams
You're in my arms, you hold me tight but it's not like it seems

You awake - you cry
Yes, remember that I said good bye

[Ref:]

Deliver me..

[Bridge:]
We know some time we're ready to start again
In another time, another life

[Solo, 2 x Ref.]
