Late at night - moonlight shining
From beyond - deadly lightning
You run fast - fall on your knees
And you find the end at least.

And you know he'll open the door
No regrets - no remorse.

And when you see the light
You know that the time is right
To meet the ferryman.
And when you see the light
It shows you the way to find
And meet the ferryman.

Kiss the blade, you think you're dead now
You're alive but you don't know how
The reaper shows the way to go
You're afraid and you scream NO.

It's too late, you've got no choice
Now obey the ferryman's voice.
Now you've reached your destination
All your fears turn into frustration
Time has come to take your last breath
Enter now the kingdom of death.

You don't need your body at all
'cause you heard the ferryman's call.
