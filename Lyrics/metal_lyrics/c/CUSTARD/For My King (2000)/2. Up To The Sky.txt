500 hundred years of slavery
no will to fight against the lord
of damnation and misery
we know our hope is lost.

I always tried to live my dreams
But every time I failed
Hidden from the sunlight
In the dungeons of disease.

And I scream for independence
Let's stand up for independence now.

I don't know how we can escape
But someday we'll be free
We'll pray to the sunlight
"shine for us eternally!"

Beyond the waterfalls of doom
We'll march to peaceful shores
And we will proudly cross
The forest of belief.

I can feel my independence grow
Listen to the independence song.

Why don't you take my hand
I lead you to the land
Where birds silently whisper your name.
Why don't you take my hand
I will show you the land
Where the drangons will carry your dreams
Up to the sky.

Hunted by the legions of the storm
We seek our destination
All of us know the way
To freedom is hard to find.

Only the gods can make us strong
The golden majesty
Will lead us on this way
To find our destiny.
