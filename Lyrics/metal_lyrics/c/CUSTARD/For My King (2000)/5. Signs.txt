Coming from nowhere
We travelled so far
We are the chosen ones
To follow the star

We rode this long way together
To offer our strong helping hands
We're fighting the evil we're fighting as one
The battle it has just begun

You spread your wings
Capture the wind
Stay by my side and our force will arise
Fire will burn in our eyes
All evil dies we burn'em away

Signs of the end
Forces of darkness appear in the night
And we'll defend
Thunder and lightning will never destroy our race

United power forever 
The signs of the end fade away
There'll be more evil we will fight as one
It's written so it shall be done
