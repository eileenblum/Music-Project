Arrived right from, the dead
The sails of terror are already set
Pain and death they will bring
I follow the path and I run for king

Run - faster than the storm
Run - to tell the king the battle's lost

I'm crying out loud
My pain is so endless but I'm still proud
I'm alone - I hear them sing
I follow the path and I run for my king

Lord of fire and ice
Help us to be free
Our kingdom's destiny is in you hand.
Lord of fire and ice
Help me to believe
In your holy might - save our land.

Now I see a light
The fortress of ice is shining so bright
I hear the dark force appear
I follow the path and I run without fear.

Now you can see what you are meant to be
Carry the seal and live eternally.
