Don't know many things in my life
Which seem to be unreal
But one certain vision controls
My mind for several years

It leads my thoughts every day
It's my guide to find my way

I know you
I know who you are

I walked through the city last night
To see a now born day
But at the end of the road
I somehow lost my way

The vision starts melting away
Where's my guide to find my way
