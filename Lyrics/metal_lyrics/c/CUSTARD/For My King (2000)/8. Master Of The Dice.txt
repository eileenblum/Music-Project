Straigt ahead - right through your eyes
Await your last breath - pay for your lies
Once again you betrayed me
Play for your soul play to be free

Get away
You can't win this deadly game
Never dare
You could win but your pain
Won't end someday

Come on now 'cause time runs and runs
Play the game you just can't lose at all
Hey come on now 'cause time runs and runs
In this game I'm to the master of the dice

It's hot you sweat - now make your choice
Remember my laughter remember my voice
You know you'll be my eternal slave
Now roll the dice make the step to the grave
