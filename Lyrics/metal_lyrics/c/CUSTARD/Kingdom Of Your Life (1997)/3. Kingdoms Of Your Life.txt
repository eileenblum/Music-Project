The kingdom of a fairyland, the threat is the dragons'might
The princess'life is in your hand, 'cause you are the chosen knight
You seek for the heart and you win the fight,
its head lies in front of the throne
But suddenly your mind is all alone

A flight across the universe, the last survivors aboard
The aliens'force destroyed the earth, now it's up to you to escort
In a new world you save all your friends then you fly back to attack
But all you see is captive in your head.

And you travel - past and future
See your life begin and end
As you travel - past and future
Never lay your fade in other hands.

In Death Valley there is no hope, crime is the law of the town
You have to wear the "justice robe", outlaws and killers fall down
Fear runs away, you're a hero again, you live in peace with your wife
This is just another kingdom of your life

And you travel...

You're on the way - in no time you will stay
There are too many things to explore.
And you'll never find your real life anymore.

And you travel...
