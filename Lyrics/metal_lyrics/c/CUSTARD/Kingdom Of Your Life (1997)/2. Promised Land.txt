Violent despair can't break the rules of glory
We see our world destroyed by their hands
They killed our neighbours, dead bodies on the field
Nowhere to run now, their swords against our forks.

This can't go on, got to set sails for our quest now
Hoping to find the peaceful promised land
Children are crying, the old ones start to pray
Where will we go to, lord help us find the way

The time has come to leave the land
Protection from the evil hand
He is the saviour god has sent.

Don't hesitate, the chosen one is our companion
He leads our way to freedom and we'll see
No more destruction, decay of the possessed
Their flag will burn and we will forget the past

The time...
