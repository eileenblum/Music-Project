I'm just here to see what friendship is all about.
You belong to me like candles to holy ground
I'll be there for you, wanna live my life with you
What can I do?

Remember the day, the sky turned from blue to grey.
You left me alone. I cannot live this way.
I'll be there...

I awake to see the light of day
And I awake to see you

We used to be friends, but memories can fade somehow
And our last dance will open a gate of clouds.
I'll be there for you, won't you share your ways with me
eternally?

I awake...

And when we are dead, all the pain has reached the end
The memories are gone, and we'll live again.

I awake..
