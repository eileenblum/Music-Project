They always say that you have to live their way
You never see your own chance
And why don't you try to break free right in time?
Don't be their fool anymore.

Walk on with pride through all darkness and light
Don't be afraid of the fall
And keep in mind that you must realize,
your world belongs to yourself.

Don't hide all the things which make you mighty
We don't let you walk alone.

We stand for honour. We fight for freedom
We just want our rights to tell what's in our mind.
We stand for honour. We fight for freedom
We just want our rights. We break the barricades.

Tear down the walls 'cause between all their calls
Are words which make no sense at all.
This is the time to break free and you'll find
You're not their fool anymore.

Don't hide...

We stand...
