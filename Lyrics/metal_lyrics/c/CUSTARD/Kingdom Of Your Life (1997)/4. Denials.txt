Running down an empty road, you're the guiding light
Which takes all my fears, but I should have known
That truth disappears, as your words became black
Dust in the streets

...and I hear another lie.

With shining eyes and hands of a friend, you promised me joy
And heaven on earth, but I should have known
That it wouldn't last, you pulled my heart out of my chest

...and I hear another lie - empty words are passing by

You sealed my fate.
I curse you with my endless hate
It's all in vain
Your false smile awakes my pain.

No more denials!!!
I've seen you without your masquerade.
I call you a liar.
My trust in you will never  be the same.

You used to be the meaning of life, you gave me a reason
To keep dreams alive, but my future failed
The moment I tried to live my own life with your plans by my side

You sealed..

No more...

You play your game and I am your toy, but don't forget bitch
I 'a man not a boy, you made the rules
But I am the ace, you cannot win, 'cause I know your real face

You sealed...

No more...
