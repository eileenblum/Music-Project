Giving life and taking life
Right hand of mother nature.
Bright as the sun, dark as the night.
You will drown and none can help you.

A loving mother - a merciless killer
The sea shows you the last contrast.
Find your dreams - meet your grave digger.
Watch out! Will you live or rest?

It's your best friend in life
It's your worst enemy
It will judge about your fate.
It's a nice place, indeed,
but one day you will find the answer
why you hate - the sea.

Don't trust the beautiful scene in the moonlight,
never forget all the danger hidden in the sea

It offers food, it's your employer,
millions can't exist without it. We surf on it.
It's so damned good. I'm sure there is no about it.

But it's also an obedient slave of death.
See the dying man on his last quest.
Feel his cold and deadly breath
No chance to get his life back.

The lord of tides is dying now.
Pollution wins the fight
Sick mankind survives somehow
But can we pay the price.

We kill the source of life we need
One way street until the end.
Human beings have to bleed.
This is my revenge.
