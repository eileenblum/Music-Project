I'm staring at a wall, which can't be broken
Sweat and blood an dying flesh, under these chains

I can't remember the reason why I'm here
I can't remember my own face at all

I came from far away, where are my friends now?
Smell the stench of their remains, pumped up with lead.

I can't remember my mothers'voice so I can't fall asleep
I can't remember my own voice at all

I'm a prisoner of war, haven't seen the sun for years
Never felt like this before much too proud for silent tears
What about my home, am I a forgotten man?
This is what I can't deny, I'm locked up in a cage of pain

Words of deliverance are words unspoken
My skin is hot, my throat is dry. When will it out?

I can't remember...

I'm a prisoner...
