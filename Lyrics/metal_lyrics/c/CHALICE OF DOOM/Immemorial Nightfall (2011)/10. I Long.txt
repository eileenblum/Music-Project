[Saturnus cover]I do me wrong
And i do it again
My sorrow rain
My feeling pain
See me through, walk me through

I long
I still long
I long
I long so much away - from me - for me
I long
I still long

Take my lips
Kiss me sweet
Take my feelings
Stop me from sweating fear
My sweet nightmares end

I long
I still long
I long
I long so much away - from me - for me
My sweet nightmare ends
