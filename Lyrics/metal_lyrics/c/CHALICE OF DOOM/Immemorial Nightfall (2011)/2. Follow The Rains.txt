I am shedding my skin, And peeling out my night.
Asking for a warmth , through the winter's sight.
With the mist that surrounds me, I fall behind..
With no hands around me, I fall in my mind.

The story has ended, as the winter descended
But These cut hands refuse to give in ..

I follow the rains, till they crash down
Holding on my scars, And screaming with no sound
Those hollow breathes would deafen you..
If they've ever reached to you..

Gently touches, Buried Kisses
Warm breathes, Distorted thoughts

The Distorted thoughts Never Leave..
