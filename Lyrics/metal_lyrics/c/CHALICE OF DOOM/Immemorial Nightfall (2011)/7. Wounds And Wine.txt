Fill my cup with the virtue of your shame..
Feed me lies..cosmos is just a game
The wine is streaming from your lips till the end time..
Your sins I wont remit, grant me another crime..

Cascades of virtue have turned to vice..
Fill the cup and carve the way..
Fill the cup and spit my days..
Fill the cup and lead astray..

Feed me lies...
I am through wounds and wine
Feed me lies...
Let the heavens cry..
Fill me lies..
Let my hate go blind..

The final kiss was over
On the moon-set time
The only things left here..
Are my wounds and wine

I am through wounds and wine..
Let the heavens cry..
I am through wounds and wine..
