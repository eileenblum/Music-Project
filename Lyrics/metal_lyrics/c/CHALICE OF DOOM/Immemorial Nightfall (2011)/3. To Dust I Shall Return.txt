Oh Mother Night...Feed me a piece of light
among the thorns I lay my body for years
This decayed body, became so pale
This grave is mourning upon me
I cant rest in peace..
I cant rest in peace..

Enjoy the darkness...and emptiness
Between the forlorn graves...life
Every grave has a story..
But no one listens..
No one listens

From Dust to human
from human to dust
A tragic circle..
Of blood and rust

Once I drank the rains and grew
And spread my roots around your love
But now the planet has one grey cloud
And Seven swans to guard our remains

I am calling from my grave..
Only stones..Only dust
Only memories ..

Oh father grief...Where's my relief
On these shores I've waited for a thousand years
This lonely hand became so paralyzed
This place is pulling me down
I cant live in peace..
I cant live in peace..
