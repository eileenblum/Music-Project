The butterflies inhale the scent of the corpse
And I am standing still..licking The Dagger..

I set her free , from the thorny cage (life)
And Granted her wings to fly away..
Away, from my rotten existence..

I set her free..

The scent reminds me, of the days she used to leave
Its all over now, you got what I've received..

I cut your lip from your face to take it with me..
The sweetest memorial of what we used to be..
I'll let the birds, snitch your naked chest..
And let your screams arise from the east, to the cheating west..
