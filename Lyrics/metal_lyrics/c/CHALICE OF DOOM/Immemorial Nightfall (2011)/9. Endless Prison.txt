Another Golden Failure.
In the sunset aeons.
Where the sand can scream.
Grey colors to the sky.

[Spoken:]
Nothing will be the same again.

When the last kiss blew
When the poison erupted
When the lifetime fell
When the line has been broken

[Spoken:]
Now we are drunk
By the grief of the sea
By the Height of the waves
By the taste of her lies

Lies.

Rebuild the portrait of our sight.
False beauty to be drawn

Her eyes.my despair
Her lips.my torment
Dead stares from her lies
Blind lights from the skies
Black lips and death to rise
Embrace. and her demise.

Her demise.

The water reflected you
Black shadows in my depths
She touched my naked essence
Then sanity has been drowned
Lonely shades and warm misery
Sick dreams and frail hope

Lonely shades, warm misery
Sick dreams, frail hope
Lonely shades, warm misery
Sick dreams, frail hope
Lonely shades, warm misery
Nothing will be the same again.
