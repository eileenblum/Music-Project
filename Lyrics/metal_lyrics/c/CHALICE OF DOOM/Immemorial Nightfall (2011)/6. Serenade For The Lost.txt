Oh, Winter please, Peel the darkness out...
Oh, Autumn please, Leave us so fast..

Two hundred raindrops are touching the surface of my face
While the moon is warming up my veins and my disgrace
The heart is spitting beats, bitterness and names
We slept alone forever, we left without a trace

Oh, Autumn please, Leave us so fast..

I wish to be touched by the sunlight..
The bones are crashing down by the coldness that is mine..
I wish to be free in these darkened skies
To fly upon the the coldest clouds to atone my ancient crimes

Oh, Winter please, peel the darkness out...
Oh, winter please, wash my salty shoulders..

Two hundred years are passing the features of my face..
While the moon is warming up my veins and my disgrace..
The eyes are streaming grief, suffering and names..
We slept alone forever..
We left without a trace..
