[feat. Roger "Rogga" Johansson]With bare feet she danced..
Upon my tomb..
Vice, fill the voids
Shame, written in blood

She danced beneath the melodies of my moans..
Death, romance, disease..

With cut feet she danced
Upon my tomb
Vice, kiss our wounds
Shame, written in blood

The steps were sending shivers down my wrecked spine
The shame that's written by my blood, is my wine tonight

"I was the cancer that grew its roots around us,
and death refused to spit our souls"

The sweat and my blood are streaming on her skin
Like the flaming winds to the world of ice
She fell..And asked for more..
Submission to the sins..
I fell like the sun of november
These cuts I can not take

The bare corpse is gone
But the smell remained
Vice, puke my name
Shame, written in blood
