[feat. Giampaul Andrianopoulos &amp; Christina Kroustali]I'll throw my last coin to the fountain
Summoning the stars to bring you home
All these coins are drowning deeper
further than anywhere you roam

I am gone away,
Free from these chains.
Your love imprisoned me.
So many centuries.
I am gone away,
And healed from the pain,
You sacrificed our dream
Along the darkened way.

The story began, When everything ended
When the heart was bleeding by destiny
I'll throw my last coin to the fountain
Waiting the pain to swallow me.
Waiting the pain to swallow me.

I am gone away,
Free from these chains.
Your love imprisoned me.
SO amny centuries.
I am gone away,
And healed from the pain,
You sacrificed our dream
Along the darkened way.

She died around the fountain
And no coins are left
She bled all of her hope
And threw her soul into the coin fountain

I am gone away
Free from the chains,
Your lies had tethered me
To the misery
I am gone away,
And healed from the pain,
You sacrificed our dreams
Along the darkened way.

Waiting the pain to swallow me.
"And healed from the pain..."
I'll throw my last coin to the fountain
