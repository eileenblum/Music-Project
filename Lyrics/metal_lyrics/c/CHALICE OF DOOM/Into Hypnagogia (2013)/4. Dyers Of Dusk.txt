When the night began
We were all young.
Searching for the moon, for the light.
The skies were grey.
And the rains were cold.
The ground was falling toward the clouds.

The smoke of vice was caving my lungs.
The smell of dying dreams was smothering.
The sanity in me.

"We were young, but too old.
To run away from the dark."

The years have passed over our paled faces
And the innocence became flashes of memories
We fell a thousand times and crashed our chests
Our remains kept us alive... 'til now

We fell and then we died.
We woke up into. Another dream

When the day began.
We were all gone.
The rays of sun warmed our remains.
The skies were blue but we see no more.
The clouds walk on the ground again.
