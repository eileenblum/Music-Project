[feat. Giampaul Andrianopoulos]The death gown I am wearing,
The scent of my skin
Are painting this place with funeral Winds.
The death gown I am wearing,
The roses behind
Are carving my eyes till I am blind.

And finally, I am no longer breathing
No more words are left to write.
And finally, I am no longer staring
No more walls are left to stare back at me

In the fading cold light I found you
Let the fabric of night surround you
Kissing you was cold like a winter
Then my heart you froze with a whisper

The death gown I am wearing,
The roses behind
Are carving my eyes till I am blind.
