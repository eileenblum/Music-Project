[feat. Giampaul Andrianopoulos]Like a grain of sand.
I am waiting on this beach.
The shores bring you once.
and take you away a thousand times.

As the sun sinks
The tide blinds my eyes
As the moon appears
I sink with only you

I smell your white skin In every wave I see
Like the salt you've been melted Into the ocean

When the water turns black
I embrace your ghost
With every touch I build my ruins
And destroy these walls of hope

Like a trail of dust
I am dancing through the rays
Seeking for a shred of freedom
In a world so grim and cold

Dear freedom
I miss your touch and frozen kiss
Dear freedom
your ghost is haunting me again

Profound is your place Within this shallow dream
Profound is the dream of touching you again
