[feat. Christina Kroustali &amp; Marius Strand]Against the winds I embrace myself
And kiss the scent of the cold December
Autumn brought sadness
Winter brought scars
Two seasons of madness
Are kissing my wounds eternally

"My hands are trembling
And begging for some warmth
My footprints are aching.
And dying by the black snow.
Black as the night
Black as my soul"

Walking upon my dry blood through the winds
Two shadows on the ground call for me.
Two suns are hiding behind the clouds.

I am the other sun
The bringer of grief and silence
I warm your fingertips from beyond
Since the day I cut your wings.
I've been here warming your soul

"Since the day you've gone
The coldness never left..."
