Walking among the woods
Searching for the bridesmaid
To share the emptiness of all these years

After the last smile.
The summer blew on earth.
And left our barren chests.
Open.

I am trying to turn the page
But my arms are cut
I am trying to tell it all
But my tongue is frozen

"The dust fills my eyes
And I cant see the woods again"

The throne of your cries, the crow and the owl
Through their eyes I've felt your soul
You've killed me in a full moon night
Beneath the snow, I am burning bright

The dust fills my eyes
I cant see the woods again
The cuts fill my heart
And I cant feel my wounds again

On these caves I dig your name...
within these mourning poems.
The light of the candles...
caresses these lonely places.
My eyes are an ocean of a million words.

"Atlast she resigned to her fate"
[A quote from "Veronika Decides to Die"]

Five roses are wilted. But they feed my soul.
The smell of your dry tears takes control.

The dusk fills my sight
And I cant see her trace again
