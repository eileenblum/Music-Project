From the womb of war
The childhood bleeds
Guns and stones against reality
Life cut the umbilical cord...
We want to breath freedom

From the womb of war
We dig our way
And peel the darkness of the years
Life cut the umbilical cord...
We want to breath justice

Six decades of inhuman torment
Genocides consumed our eyes
Will the children forgive the fathers
For everything they did and said ?
Six decades of killing dreams
Homeless and nameless
Will the children forgive the fathers
Everytime they leave us to die ?
