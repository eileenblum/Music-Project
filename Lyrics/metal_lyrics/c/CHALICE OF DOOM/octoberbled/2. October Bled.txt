Old Names through dust-winds.
Seashores of hollow days.
Yellow sparks and smothered clouds.
Glowing seas and mourning sounds.

Wilted gardens in her eyes,
Flowing poison from her lips.
She wrote the end of memories.
As I enjoyed her final drips.

[Spoken words:]
"As the seasons passed us by
As the disease is growing
She bid farewell for the final time
And the wings have been stolen"

Nothing. Has left to hide.
Nothing. Has left to be burned inside.

[Spoken words:]
"Stop bleeding for the sake of breathing...
Stop breathing for the sake of living..."

Nothing..Has left to hide
Nothing..Has left to be burned inside

[Spoken words:]
"The Autumn will close its doors,
But seas will never forget this day"
