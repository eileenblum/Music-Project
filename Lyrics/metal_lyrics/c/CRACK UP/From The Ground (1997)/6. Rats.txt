one rat to another said:
i'm lucky to have met you
it's not friend-wise, just to feed me well
(go to hell)
FEED ME WELL, MAKE ME HIGH
AND I WILL GO MY WAY
WITHOUT RESPECT, NOTHING REGRET
AND I WILL GO MY WAY
(without you)
in extreme need, the fat rat said:
lucky to have met you
you make me high, so i regret
(can't leave you fat)
