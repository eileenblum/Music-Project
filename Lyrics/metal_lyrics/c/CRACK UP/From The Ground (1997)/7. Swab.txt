cry, if you want to cry
die, when you need to die
lie, if you have to lie
love, when you want to lose
people passing, gods keep laughing
crowds are running, all the same aversion
pour minds watching, so-called power crushing at my laughing side...
i'm laughing by my side
...ES BRENNT DAS FLEISCH!
people passing, gods keep laughing
crowds are running, all the same direction
pour minds watching, so-called power crushing at my laughing side...
i'm laughing by my side
blessed coming, slowly running
they are expecting all the same explosion
sad kinds crying, so-called madness
reigning at my drying side, i'm drying up no more
do you see what i see?
do you feel what i feel?
did you know what i know?
do you think?'
