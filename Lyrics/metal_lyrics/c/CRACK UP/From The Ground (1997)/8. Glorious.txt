it's getting glorious!
so different perspectives, so different sight
such unreal illusions, so different eyes
so different preachings, so different preachers
such serious faith, such unreal lies
THE BREED BECOMING FABULOUS
THE LUMBER'S OUT OF TOWN
WE CELEBRATE TO DROWN
so different perspectives, so different preachings
so different faith, such unreal lies
so different perspectives,so different sight
such unreal illusions, so different eyes
the time's not passing by
i wish the time's not passing by
to stay here for another while
i wish the time's not passing by
feels like a wreck, i'm lying to myself
feels no more wrath but it goes on
