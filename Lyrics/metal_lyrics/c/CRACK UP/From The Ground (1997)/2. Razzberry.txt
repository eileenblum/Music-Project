the day i angle no more angel
for no beggars try to crack a smile
the day the stars will turn to black
all happiness will end up dead!
change your name - one million times
change your style - one million times
come and learn - each different things
come and learn - won't learn from me
ALL THE TIMES YOU TRY TO SEE
AND ALL THE TIMES YOU TRY TO BE
CREATE A RAZZBERRY IN ME!
ALL THE TIMES YOU LEARN FROM ME
ALL THE TIMES YOU'D WISHED TO BE
CREATE A RAZZBERRY IN ME!
change your name - one million times
nothing will ever change with you
no one will tell you what to do
nothing will turn out right for you
