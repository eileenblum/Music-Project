throw it all away
we throw the bad away
who will be the broomer?
supposed to come a broomer
who cleaned my head last night
this might be the broomer
let's be gone forever
let's be gone and ever
let's be gone forever
let's be gone and ever
faces around me
them walking beside me
i'm right by my side
who will be the broomer?
supposed to come a broomer
throw it all away
we throw the bad away
