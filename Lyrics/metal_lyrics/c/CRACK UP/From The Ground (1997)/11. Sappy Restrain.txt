fake me, kill me, take me, you thrill me
you made me disappear
closed my eyes and cursed the fear
i came down to make you see
that life is not/my reality
IT'S A SAPPY RESTRAIN
COME WITH ME
GO WITH ME
BLESS ME
i would never fall in love today
i would never crack a smile
i would never try another one
i would never speak a word
i would never try to say good-bye
i would never stay another while
i would never kill the family
i would never leave the house
i don't enjoy this anymore
there's no corner on the floor
