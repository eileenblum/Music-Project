i see blood on the floor
i don't enjoy this anymore
now please believe me
now please relieve me
i'm looking for someone able to resist
i'm looking for something that doesn't exist
don't you see all useless trips?
don't you realize this loneliness?
LEAD ME BACK
TO WHERE I WAS BEFORE
TO WHAT I'LL NEVER BE
WHERE INNOCENCE IS REAL
STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW'
i'm looking for someone able to resist
looking for something that doesn't exist
don't you see all useless trips?
don't you realize this lonliness?
blood on the floor
don't enjoy this anymore
now please believe me
now please relieve me
