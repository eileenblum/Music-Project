this pain is always coming back again
i only wish it would be yours tonight
to make you realize what you've done
to make you see what has become of me
i've grown old within minutes
wounded by now, scarred forever
...never be the same again
let's create a mighty vision
unanswered Q's in my head
scarred forever, they drive me mad
this mist will never lift
burns will leave to remind forever
BURN! IN THE HELL I'M GOING THRU
AND FEEL THE PAIN I'M FEELING HERE
BURN! IN THE FIRES YOU USED TO LIGHT
AND THE BURNS SHALL NEVER LEAVE
kill'em...kill'em...kill'em
kill and burn!
kill and burn!
kill and burn!
kill and burn!
