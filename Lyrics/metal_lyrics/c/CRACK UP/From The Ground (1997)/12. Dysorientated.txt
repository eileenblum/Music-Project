i wish the silence (would) turn to noise
then turn it down on low again
i wish all monsters (would) disappear
to let them out, to go/kill again

i shot my head,not only trying to forget
i wish the silence (would) turn to noise
then turn it down on low again
i wish all monsters (would) disappear
to let them out, to go/kill again
