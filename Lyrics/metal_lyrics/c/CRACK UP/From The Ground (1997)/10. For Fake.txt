and i'm bored by all of you
like there's nothing you could do
even if i would pretend
sham will end up with no friend
still here i go
don't tell me what i wanna hear
my wisdom is with fear
tell me what is left to prove?
I DON'T REGRET A THING
EXPERIENCE ANYTHING YOU NEED
I LET EXPEREIENCE SLOWLY SEEP
you won't tell me what i wanna hear
my wisdom is with fear
tell me what is left to prove?
you won't acknowledge what i do'
and you won't tell me what it means
and you can't see how much remains
what to do and what do you expect from whom...
from another kind of me
for fake...for fake...for fake...for fake
