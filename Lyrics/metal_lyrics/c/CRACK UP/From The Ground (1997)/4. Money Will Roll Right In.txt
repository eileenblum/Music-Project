i'll go to hollywood
be a star yeah i'm so good
i won't care how i feel
and i'll get to fuck brooke shields
HERE I SIT AND GRIN
MONEY WILL ROLL RIGHT IN
i want to be star
i'm going to have a car
and you'll have to admit
i'll be rich as shit
HERE I SIT AND GRIN
MONEY WILL ROLL RIGHT IN
i would give you some
if you only would've treated me nice
you'll wish that you did
you'll feel pretty stupid
HERE I SIT AND GRIN
MONEY WILL ROLL RIGHT IN
it's fun to be a star
it's nice to have a car
yeah you'll have to admit
i'll be rich as shit
HERE I SIT AND GRIN
MONEY WILL ROLL RIGHT IN
