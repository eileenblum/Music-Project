everything that i got
is everything that you want
everything that i got
is everything that you fucked (up)

the little that you see
is nothing to believe
high - high - higher ground
turn - turn - turn around

you wouldn't get it if you'd tried
no chance to get it if you'd cried
simply forget it and go home
just keep on resting good ole bone
don't you believe it's time to leave
there's nothing left you could receive
maybe you'd get it if you'd tried
maybe you'd get it if you'd cried
