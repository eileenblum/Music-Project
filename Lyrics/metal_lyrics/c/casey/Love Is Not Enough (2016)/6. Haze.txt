How much do you remember about those summers we spent together? Because I don't seem to be able to recall all those things I thought that I'd miss, your perfume and your sun kissed skin, turns out they meant nothing all along. I was haunted by the emptiness that filled the hole you left, a grave I still can't bring myself to visit yet. Though I won't be losing sleep, I still refuse to forget, it took me so long to admit we were dead;
But we were dead.

You buried it in the backyard of a house that we built with our bare hands where you said we'd grow old together. I felt safe there, I knew every crooked frame and every creaking stair. I could have stayed my whole fucking life, but time was never a friend of mine.

I got so scared that I disappeared into my head for 8 lonely years and it killed me, but it hurt you too, and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but you weren't there when I needed you most. I felt like I was a ghost of someone you used to love, but I was never enough to save us.

Are you happy? Are you happy?

So tell me, is it serious between you and him? I hope to God that he makes you happy, I hope I never hear your name again.

Now the home we made is nothing more than a house, where we fucked and we ate, but never fell in love. You're sleeping in the bed we made, with somebody else.
Are you happy?
Are you fucking happy?
