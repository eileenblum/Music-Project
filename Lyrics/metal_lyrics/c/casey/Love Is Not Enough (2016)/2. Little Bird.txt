Lay awake or sleep for days, you wouldn't notice either way. Couldn't help you with your pain, but always hoped that you were safe.
It took hours of silent phone calls for me to finally realise that just because you act with the best of intentions, it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't be wrong.

I thought my heart could be our home, but all you thought of was the cage. Praying for the sun, beneath my ribs you sat in shade. You were my little bird and I saw fit to clip your wings, and then resented you because for me you never chose to sing.

So there was silence in the house, the hallways echoed with a growing doubt that we would never make it out of the Hell that we created.

I guess that's why it never felt like home, because we'd lay together but were still alone. Desperate for the warmth of someone's comfort but not our own. We were always vacant, nothing more; we spoke until our throats were sore. Our hearts lay on the bedroom floor, and
one was mine, but both were yours.

I'm sorry I could never find the words to say, I had chewed them all into my tongue. Your negligence has left me frail.
I never asked to fall in love so young.

I know I promised not to call again, but I've still got so much to say. I hope to God that you are sleeping well, I hope that someday you will ache the way I ache.

Someday you will ache the way I ache.
