The emptiness I harboured in the questions that I asked was almost palpable
It tasted like the soft skin on your back
And when I said âwhere did you go?â
What I meant was
âSince you left
I have havenât had the chance to hate you
Nearly half as much as I've hated myselfâ

We were in love
At least thatâs what I came to call it
I was never really quite sure if it was
Because in growing up
The hardest lesson learned
Is just because you love someone
It doesn't mean they love you in return

I always thought youâd fade when I buried you and me
But on our grave a bed of flowers bloomed
And now each day you grow more beautiful
as Iâm left to decay
I guess itâs true that some things never change

Itâs been quite a long time now
Butt Iâm still so weak
I found a bliss in my ignorance
Until ignorance found hell in me
And when I said âwhere did you go?â
What I meant was
âSince you left
I have havenât had the chance to hate you
Nearly half as much as I've hated myselfâ

Itâs been a long time now
But I still spend my nights laying away
The kind of tired that sleep wouldn't shake
The kind of empty that fills the entire space in my chest cavity
Where I tried to keep you safe
But you escaped

Itâs been quite a long time now
Butt Iâm still so weak
I found a bliss in my ignorance
Until ignorance found hell in me
And when I said âwhere did you go?â
What I meant was
âSince you left
I have havenât had the chance to hate you
Nearly half as much as I've hated myselfâ
