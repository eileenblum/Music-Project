I donât need you like you think I do I just want you here tonight
I know this might sound crazy but my head it just donât feel right
I miss your bones buried beneath my sheets
My voice shakes when I try to speak
Your name is stitched into my teeth
And every time I talk I feel you there

Every night the floorboards creak outside my bedroom door
18 months of losing sleep
Because your host has been pacing in the halls
I know they say time heals all wounds but when will it heal mine?
âCause Iâm sick of waiting for you to bring me back my peace of mind

I still miss you like the moon misses the warm kiss of the sun
When the earth dances between them and steals away itâs love
I asked how long youâd be gone
And you said âas long as it takesâ
And I was always so impatient with our love
But I swore Iâd wait

Iâm tired of living in the fear that one day youâll come back
And after all these years, I wonât be able to look you in the face
And say âI've let you goâ

âCause yours is the only love I've ever known
