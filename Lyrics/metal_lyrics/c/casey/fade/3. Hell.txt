[Bonus Track]I know I promised not to call
But I left so much unsaid
And you barely said a word at all
But I knew exactly how you felt

How fast did we decay?
'Cause I remember falling into love
But never out again
It felt like one day I woke up
Add we werenât there
We'd lay our bones in the same bed at night
But our love had disappeared

Lonely is as lonely does
Sink beneath the bed sheets
Drowning in the thought of us
A bloodless vessel, empty
Toothless, I've been thinking of a way to let you know
Hell is loving you in my sleep and waking up alone

I guess I just couldn't bring myself to face the fact that maybe we were never what I wanted us to be
Maybe the love that we had made was not the beautiful home I always imagined that we had built
Because you were the light of my life
But no matter how brightly you shone the shadow you cast was never dark enough to cancel out the glare
Maybe I would have left sooner if I could have seen it then
Maybe you were never there

You never saw it as us
Only ever you and me
You were the blood in my veins
You only came to watch me bleed
Our love set me on fire
And you stood and watched me burn
You told me once you couldn't love me
But I guess I'll never learn

Lonely is as lonely does
Sink beneath the bed sheets
Drowning in the thought of us
A bloodless vessel, empty
Toothless, I've been thinking of a way to let you know
Hell is loving you in my sleep and waking up alone
