My fingers broke holding the rope that tied me to the past,
I choked on every simple syllable I'd stitched into my teeth;
Since the bones reset I guess I think about you less, unless I'm drinking or upset,
But honestly that doesn't happen frequently. I'm not even sure why I'm still calling you up,
When I know that your phone's been disconnected for months.
I guess it's hard to break a habit that reminds you of love,
I just needed you to know that I don't miss you at all. And needlework would never hurt,
I embellished all that I was worth with words so passionately birthed by lovers losing hope.
But in the end I hated every metaphor we made,
Every sickly sentiment that I had sewn into my skin.
I'm learning to remove your every suture, every wound is proof that even love is ruthless,
I was used, but I survived no thanks to you.
