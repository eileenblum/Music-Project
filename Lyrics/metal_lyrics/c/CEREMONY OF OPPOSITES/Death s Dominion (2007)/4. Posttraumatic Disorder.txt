Returning from the warzone
Completely bend and broken
By all that he has seen
Transformed into another
Several times facing death
Has changed a man to machine
The memories will never leave
The memories of what he's seen
And now there is no turning back
To his former state of mind
Forever suffering the consequences of
Posttraumatic disorder
Nightmares terrorize his mind
Re-experiencing everything ones more
Derealizating from the world
Doomed to live within the past
Estranged from his normal life
Now only living in one moment
Losing everything he ever had
Living solitary he'll spend his days
And now there is no turning back
To his former state of mind
Forever suffering the consequences of
Posttraumatic disorder
