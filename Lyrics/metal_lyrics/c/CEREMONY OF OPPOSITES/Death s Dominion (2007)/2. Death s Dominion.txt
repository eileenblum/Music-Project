Drowned in the pool outside
as suddenly the ability to swim fades
None to help, no one to see the vision
Left in the hands of death's dominion!
Elecrocuted by the wires surrounding
Coming closer to her body
Now there's no way out, no way to escape confrontation
Left in the hands of death's dominion!
One night of misery
A night of greater loss
As they all seem to die
In ways never forseen
No one could explain
The cruesome accidents
That sacrificed their lives to
Death's dominion
Arsened by the dragon's fire
That scorches the soul during the nightmare
As he opens his eyes, he sees the come true vision
Left in the hands of death's dominion!
Torn apart by the voices inside
Which no one can hear, but drives him insane
And as he sees the apparition
Left in the hands of death's dominion!

[Chorus]

Hanging at the end of the rope
As he slipped and fell, now there's no way out
Inevitable suffocation
Left in the hands of death's dominion!

[Chorus]
