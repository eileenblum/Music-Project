Longing for the ability to fly out to the sky and be where I've never been
Longing for the ability to touch that what I've never touched before
Longing for the ability to walk ahead and see that what I've never seen
Longing for the ability to escape this cell and embrace my
Freedom, the wish from deep inside to break out
And to not be unheard again
Freedom, the wish from deep inside to break out
And to take over this life
Again I'm trying to break out of this chains that are keeping me so tight
Again I'm trying to fulfil my deepest desire
Still I'm waiting for the day to step out of the dark and see the light
Still I'm waiting for the day to start my life and embrace the
Freedom, the wish from deep inside to break out
And to not be unheard again
Freedom, the wish from deep inside to break out
And to take over this life
