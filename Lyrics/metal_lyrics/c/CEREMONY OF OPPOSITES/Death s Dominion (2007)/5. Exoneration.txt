Another execution of a guilty soul
The cruelty of his crime made humanity decide
That our society should be safe from his violent thoughts
And he should be erased from the surface of this earth
Not to commit another crime forever!
Death penalty, the righteous end of a human life
To be executed in front of the eyes of the world
Death penalty, the righteous end of a human life
Your soul will burn eternally within the flames of hell
The irreversibility of the ultimate punishment
Is often proven to be wrong in the end
An eye for an eye can't be what we wish for!
Exoneration no longer possible
Now that the conviction has been performed
Death penalty, the righteous end of a human life
To be executed in front of the eyes of the world
Death penalty, the righteous end of a human life
Your soul will burn eternally within the flames of hell
