Finally awakening from a nearly everlasting sleep
Finding that you're lying in a pool of bones and blood
Realising after all this time that you are in too deep
Swimming in a seemingly unending bath of gore
And as you bathe in gore
The wish to return to the world above grows stronger
And as you bathe in gore
You realize this is the end and there is no more
Crying for some help you waste the last bit of your energy
While knowing that no one can hear you still
Now the end is near you open up your eyes so you can see
You're drifting in your self-created hell
And as you bathe in gore
The wish to return to the world above grows stronger
And as you bathe in gore
You realize this is the end and there is no more
Asking yourself why you have deserved to overcome this fate
Realising there's no way out fills you sickened mind with hate
Slowly wakening from the nightmare lying between rotting corpses
Trying to escape this hell though finding that you're trapped for good
