A game it seemed to be yet never was
All seemed useless but was to enrich your soul
And still you think that life is this superficial
But what you don't know is that what will surprise you
Inconvertible changes
Every lesson ever learned
Will be taken along beyond death
All the wisdom ever obtained
Won't be thrown away at the path's end
You will find the deeper meaning of your life
As you enter the gates to the life beyondâ¦
When you've finally found the world behind the horizon
That's when you'll know the true meaning of life
Inconvertible changes
Everything that's ever seen by man's eyes
Will change life and how we look at it
All the steps we'll ever take on our journey
Won't make us remain who we are
We'll never be the same again
Now that we've changes for good
