The battle between good and evil will last forevermore
Our eternal need for power drives us to these cruel acts
These deeds can't be justified by the thoughts in our soul
Though are responsible for the suffering and death
Behind our dark side lies a place that's filled with eternal light
Though hardly shown it doesn't lack importance in our lives
Is it the fear of weakness when showing a side that cares?
Or is it the lack of understanding for the part we try to hide?
I'm hiding myselfâ¦ behind a wall of darkness
Being hereâ¦ I won't be hurt by their vicious looks
From here I will build my own world, stronger than theirs
To eventuallyâ¦ take my revenge
Can you show the light within you that's hidden behind this wall?
Or will choose eternal imprisonment above freedom
Try to free your mind by being who you are
And remove this mask that only covers your true identity
The battle between good and evil will continue forevermore
And bring diversity to those unable to fight
These deeds will never be justified by the thoughts in our soul
And bring us down from out of the height
Behind our dark side lies a place that's filled with eternal light
Though hardly shown it doesn't lack importance in our lives
Is it the fear of weakness when showing a side that cares?
Or is it the lack of understanding for the part we try to hide?
