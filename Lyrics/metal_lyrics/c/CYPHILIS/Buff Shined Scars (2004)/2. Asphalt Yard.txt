I Don't Even See Why
Not Let Ourselves Waste Away To Shit
And I Don't Even Know Why
The Sun Rises To My Soul Everyday
And I Don't Even Care Why
I Fill Your Lobotomy Up With Spit
And I Don't Even Ask Why
I Hate This Place So God Damn Much

[Chorus]
When I Look To The East
Viewing All That's Deceased
It's A Punch Line Divide
Ruptured Veins And All
So As We Feel The Need
We Wanna Burn The Seed
And Count The Number Of Times
We Shoot Ourselves In The Head

I Don't Even See How
The Tides Have Turned Into A Chain
And I Don't Even Know How
To Stop The Birth Of Indirect Light
And I Don't Even Care How
The Air In My Lungs Makes Me Feel So Weak
And I Don't Even Ask How
Long It Takes Until We Destroy

[Chorus]
When I Look To The East
Viewing All That's Deceased
It's A Punch Line Divide
Ruptured Veins And All
So As We Feel The Need
We Wanna Burn The Seed
And Count The Number Of Times
We Shoot Ourselves In The Head

[X4]
This Is What They've Made You
This Is What You Are

[X4]
This Is What They've Made You
This Is What You Are

[Chorus x2]
When I Look To The East
Viewing All That's Deceased
It's A Punch Line Divide
Ruptured Veins And All
So As We Feel The Need
We Wanna Burn The Seed
And Count The Number Of Times
We Shoot Ourselves In The Head
