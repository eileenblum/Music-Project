What Makes One Man Rise Above... Another
Is It The Fact That His Clout Can End Your Future
Just By The Very Social
Status That They Hold
Isn't It Amazing How
They Can Cast Us Aside
To The Side Of The Road
As If We're Waste Waiting To Be Collected By Those
Who've Stood Up To the Man and Learned

[Chorus]
I Am... The Bastard
I Am

Learned The Hard Way
About Lazy Arms
And Bright Minds
So What Can Be Said For This Land Of Milk And Vomit
The Answer Lies In A One Way Ticket To Equality
Which Inevitably Comes As Soon As
Reality Can Defecate Your Being

[Chorus]
I Am... The Bastard
I Am
I Am... The Bastard
I Am... The Bastard
I Am... The Bastard
I Am... The Bastard
