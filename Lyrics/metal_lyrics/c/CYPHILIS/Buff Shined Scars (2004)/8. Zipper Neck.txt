We Are All In A Sea Of Structure
Here To Guide Us On Their Paths
Slaves To Their Ideas And Ways
Watch The Mother Fuckin Deprivation
Once Again
Run My Head Into The Pavement
Can't You Hear
Our Screams Aloud
Bye-Bye
Disposable Commodity
Suck The Tit
Green Juice
Satisfaction Is The Only Fuckin Act
Which Burns Inside The Mind Of A Conformitist
With Their Hands So Tight Around Your Zipper Neck
That The Inside Of A Bottle Smells Sweet To You

[Chorus]
Crisscross The Cross To
Find A Way To Keep Me DOWN
Tasting The Barrel
How Well Does It Feel TODAY
When The
Gun Is
In The Other HAND

Screw My Face
To The Bowels Of A Clock
Ascertain The Days Of Bound Life
Waste Our Time
Until We're Dead
The Time Has Come
To Face The Fact
Day To Day We're Fucked In Every God Damn Way
Lays A Smile Upon The Face Of A Conformitist
With Their Hands So Tight Around Your Zipper Neck
That The Inside Of A Bottle Smells Sweet To You

[Chorus]
Crisscross The Cross To
Find A Way To Keep Me DOWN
Tasting The Barrel
How Well Does It Feel TODAY
When The
Gun Is
In The Other HAND

I'm Stripped Of All My Pride
Zip... Per... Neck
Zip... Per... Neck
Zip... Per... Neck....
