If time weren't so worthless I'd have you done
And at the end of my life I've just begun
I'm gonna spit... polish... and shine you bright
Oh mother fucker take everything... in sight
Hammer to place all the strips as one
This alabaster face is the prodigal son
Of a mouth, and eye, an internal sense
Come and see what I've built inside this fence

[Chorus]
Five feet down
They fuck me to the ground
To become
The numbers of the sum
I can't win
My hatred is a sin
A tempered fuckin ban
That helps me build my spit can

So what do you think of my little creation
We think it's ready for the devastation
The answer came in the words that were spoke
And it seems like all my work is just a joke
So I ripped... tore... and broke it down
Without a single hint of a fucking frown
As I set in the pieces I'll never again
Let the world come down and be my friend

[Chorus]
Five feet down
They fuck me to the ground
To become
The numbers of the sum
I can't win
My hatred is a sin
A tempered fuckin ban
That helps me build my spit can

Helps me build my spit can
Helps me build my spit... can
