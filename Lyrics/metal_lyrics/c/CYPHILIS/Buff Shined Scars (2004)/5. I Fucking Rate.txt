It Would Figure
Just About Now
The Mighty-Mighty Man
Come To Put Me Down
Fuck All That
I Don't Give A Fuck
Pride In My Soul
My Only Fuckin Goal
For Once I Stop
I Beg No One To Differ
I Live My Life
With No Bullshit
Critique... My Every
Fuckin Discussion
God Fuckin Damn That Makes Me....
So......

[Chorus]
I "Fucking" Rate
It's Time To Listen Up
If We Are So Free
Why Are Limitations
On Every Persons Mind

Please Talk Shit
On This Song
I Fucking Rate
Is The Way I Feel
Problem Is Written
On The Finger
Point It To The Mouth
With A Big Question Why
Fuck Your Why
I Don't Give A Fuck
I Salute
You Fucking Dicks
Limit My Every
Fuckin Thought
It's the Hate That Makes Me...
So...

[Chorus]
I "Fucking" Rate
It's Time To Listen Up
If We Are So Free
Why Are Limitations
On Every Persons Mind
