I See Something Looks Can't Buy
Rapacity Lures Our Mind
Influence Shows Your War Cries
Blind Us With Your Perfect Lives
Oh God Damn California Dreamer
Starve Ourselves To Be The One
Built To Cover Dead Beaches
Party Waste All That's Not Ours
End With Pill Fed Tears Left Bleeding
Oh God Damn California Dreamer
Squeeze Yourself To A Head
Watch It Go And Now You're Dead
I'm the One You Fuckin Fed
Let Me Hear You Cause I Said

[Chorus x2]
I'm Not From California I'm
East Coast
Pure Bred
Pissed Off
Mother Fucker

Oh God Damn California Dreamer
California Messiah
Jealousy Runs So Rampant
Must Be Nice To Have That Life
Red Hatred Swims Through Our Blood
Oh God Damn California Dreamer
Squeeze Yourself To A Head
Watch It Go And Now You're Dead
I'm the One You Fuckin Fed
Let Me Hear You Cause I Said

[Chorus X4]
I'm Not From California I'm
East Coast
Pure Bred
Pissed Off
Mother Fucker

[Bridge x3]
Squeeze Yourself To A Head
Watch It Go And Now You're Dead
I'm the One You Fuckin Fed
Let Me Hear You Cause I Said

[Chorus x4]
I'm Not From California I'm
East Coast
Pure Bred
Pissed Off
Mother Fucker
