Left To What Shows My Path
More To Have, More To Want
What's The Difference If I've Lost
I'm Too Far... Now To Win
Break My Legs With Temping Eyes
Poke My Ears So I can Hear My Lies
And Hear Me Scream...
As I

[Chorus]
See No One
Behind Myself
I See No One
When I Can Pass My Beaten Past
See No One
Behind Myself
I See No One When I Can Pass My Beaten Past

As My Eyes Observe
Retreat Is Where Man Has Put Me
Eat My Flesh With Bleak Bars
No You Can't Return
To The Point When One More Breath
Can Take Its Place
And All You Care Is That...
I Equals I....

[Chorus]
See No One
Behind Myself
I See No One
When I Can Pass My Beaten Past
See No One
Behind Myself
I See No One
When I Can Pass My Beaten Past

Just Too Thank Yourself
Thinking And Pleading And Begging It Over And Over Again....

[Chorus]
See No One
Behind Myself
I See No One When I Can Pass My Beaten Past
See No One
Behind Myself
I See No One
When I Can Pass My Beaten Past
