Dedicated to YOU - hidden in a room full of mirrors
lookin' at them just before goin' out at night..........

Your father's dying - you're parasitizing in his new house
fattening on his incomes,
sleeping half a day like a vermin in a cesspool.
Faster, faster... please pass out ... expire ....
A dance of mellow tears:
outwardly tragic - inwardly cold and calculating.
Born of an error, born to redeem a vicious sensation of guilt
by charming and living of the others.

OUT OF TIME, OUT OF SIGHT
OUT OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD NOT LIKE
A POISONED FIX DRAINING ALL YER HOPES
A FEMALE VULTURE TO DEVOUR ALL THE HAVINGS YOU'LL AFFORD.

Her definitive aim / is to take more + more /
to retire him in a slave's shell /
bending feelings under sword.... /

TIME OF THE VULTURES!
TIME OF THE VULTURES! [x2]
