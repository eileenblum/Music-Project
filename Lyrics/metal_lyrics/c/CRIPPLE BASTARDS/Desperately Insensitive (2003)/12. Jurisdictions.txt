Every sub-citizen's social obligation
is to fall in a meaningless breach,
then drag cross &amp; nails in front of the jury,
be condemned and pay,
spit bowels till the last coin,
the last millilitre of blood. jurisdictions

Available for being the exploitable...
we work to give back the mere shit that we've earned.
Registered at their court, a signature to a file,
we increase civil power and demote basic rights.
