good ol' Yugoslavija - you're my holocaust of sadness
a country backed by an ancient history of knowledge and tradition
suppressed by a new world order that no mouth denies
subjected to an alien system of values and concepts
punished 'cos non-fitting the mandatory westernized standards
poisoned with separations and inner conflicts
pressed between catholic bigotry and Muslim fanatism.

..and US peacekeepers have brought death to my brothers
to a land whose only guilt is to be stuck among different fires
US peacekeepers point Serbs as traitors and criminals
in a war of words and pictures hiding a dark storm of lies
US peacekeepers have done justice to no-one:
as NATO missiles rained down KLA murders went on indisturbed
US peacekeepers bombing hospitals &amp; monuments
leaving hundreds of civilians in a nightmare of blood.

WE STARE IMPASSIVELY
DESPERATELY INSENSITIVE

Krajina: a mass of serbian natives kicked out of their land
thanx to a pitful âconstitutional changeâ
around the lines of outgoing refugees croatian soldiers and fanatics enjoy throwing stones,
spitting and insulting people whose only guilt was to be born in a territory doomed to be âtradedâ.

Kosovo: entire families deprived of their houses,
children massacred &gt; bowels turned up on their faces
stabbings, terrorist injuries to non-military targets....
ever wondered whatâs the real NATOâs goal on this sphere of occupation and hatred?
To ensure the safety of a handful of rough albanian invaders? No way.
Does an average US citizen have a minimum knowledge or interest on the history of the Balkans??

Starting a war to save peace is like
fucking to preserve virginity.

you &amp; your fat ass parked in front of a TV
crunching pop-corns happily Yankee brainwashed
you ignoring where real culture derives from
â¦come to Srbija to scream and suffer.

Treated like a bunch of savages
Lead to an injustified war
Broadcast manipulation: fucked up.

Just because we are Serbs we have to pay.
