A filthy presence obstructing my veins,
the fanatic exaltation of a negative feeling.
I love to hate, I hate your love.
...and I can't feel affection for people like you.
Consumed verbal roads, projected through our dead lands,
your thoughts - drowned in my tears. A sad premonition.
I love to hate, I hate your love.
...and I can't feel affection for people like you.
Your love is opportunistic, precarious, untruthful.
My hate is stable, irrepressible, aggressive.
I love to hate, I hate your love.
...and I can't feel affection for people like you.
