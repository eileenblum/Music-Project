CARDBOARD, I EAT CARBOARD,
CARDBOARD PILES OF CARDBOARD.
CARDBOARD EVERYDAY
SHOWING TEETH AS I PROUDLY CHEW.
CARDBOARD, MUD AND CARDBOARD.
CARDBOARD ON CARDBOARD.
WHOâS TO STAY ALWAYS BENT DOWN
THE NEXT HOLE MEETING THE SCREW

Social expansionism heating your bed
while few steps behind thereâs somebody growinâ &amp; dying of anger
my cancer explodes in front of you screwing my sister.
Cold like this blood pulsating all over my face
hearts turn to nitrogen &gt; nausea stucks my brain.

CARDBOARD, EVERYDAY.
I ABUSE â EATING CARDBOARD.
CARDBOAD â I CHEW. CARDBOARD &amp; MUD.
CARDBOARD, PILES OF CARDBOARD.
WHOâS THE NEXT TO BE BENT
URGE OF HOLES FOR MY SCREW.

Public buttsucker â mutual bed-heater
donât give up, enjoy her climax, deep inside.
Beating my brain on time with the bitterness
of these âdazed but actualâ social codes.
Apart from the appearances what can you give?
A metaphor on your life &gt;&gt; plastic flowers, the empty crysalid.
Ever watched behind the walls
reflecting your smarmy brainless smile?
Cold like this bell dividing the rounds of our fight
the strength of an ego vs
the egoism of strength in suitânâtie.
