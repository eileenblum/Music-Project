[INTRODUCING THE PERFECT HANDBOOK TO SELF-DEFAMATION]
Inside out of your corpse
emotions wonât change
another dull rose wastes its thorns
let me ill-treat my casual vehicle of lust
young dead meat here to regenerate cum.
Queues of dazed slaves claim their weekly dose â INSIDE OUT , INSIDE OUT
Who ends to lead the game / who does the supine whore today â INSIDE OUT , INSIDE OUT
We made it a convenience, grew &amp; spread a psychosis â INSIDE OUT , INSIDE OUT
Anesthetic has been injected / beasts look resigned and emptied â INSIDE OUT
Inside out of your corpse
no-one can show us whatâs better or worse
compassion and dignity, shall I give a shit
or just train my metabolism to this steroid-fueled society
Buxxx in advance / make room to the next cock â INSIDE OUT , INSIDE OUT
youâre a mouth to be shut, never worth of being heard â INSIDE OUT , INSIDE OUT
me. on the route to erase feelings that no longer fit â INSIDE OUT , INSIDE OUT
you. just bend your head, turn my savings into white hot drops â INSIDE OUT

[P.S.:] 27 YEAR OLD. ADDICTED TO PROSTITUTION
A DOUBLE EDGED FALL INTO ETHICAL PERDITION

Canât you see, I have yer cunt printed on my face.
Iâm fucked and gone / lost like the shittiest junkie in his suicide mission to Planet Dope.
If you want something to meditate about, wonder how and why did I come to all this.
Like sperm under water when it curdles, in cholesterol-clots runs this magic virus of frustration
I feel it inside my veins: think of blood slowing down to a jam-like consistency. Heavier.
Canât you seeâ¦ in this squallid micro-infinite paradise of opportunism
where all humans are motive of disillusion, you women play the unlucky role ofâ¦
*** cash converters ***
Any complaints? Kick my face and letâs see whoâs fucking who.
