[this text has been removed from various CB records due to the endless diatribes that took place as soon as somebody from the SHARP scene heard about it. â¦.at least we tried to say what we think, unlike the majority of cowards in the scene of today. GTB anyway wants to apologize for the somehow generic expression used, which may offend people who's been kind and honest to us for ages and not just those we refer to. Be yourself - not part of a category, call yourself a man, not a skin, a punk or whatever. This means being the "original"]

[COMMENTARY:]
Idiots think slower,
pigs shouting "OI!-OI!" when some other shaved puppet goes up on stage,
always the same hits - unchangeable juke boxes, beer after beer.
Idiots think slower but kick harder,
sticked to old fashioned crap, all in Fred Perry's, all in the same boots

THE KIDS ARE UNITED - THE KIDS ARE UNIFORMED

..they'll tell they're true rebels and you won't contradict
rebels conformed to a stereotype, even street life can be a model.
Idiots think slower, idiots need their icons.
Idiots think slower but beat faster,
and fast they can be in screwing up a life
attacking 10 against 1, breaking bottles on your face.
Lonsdale = corporate / Fred Perry = corporate
Dr.Martens = corporate / Recycled trends = corporate
IN-CORPORATED / CORPORATE.
IN-CORPORATED / CORPORATE.

This mass of SHARP scumbags pretends to be antiracist
but acts just the same like Mussolini's vigilantes.
S.H.A.R.P. to stand vs something that is not so dissimilar from them
the only thing that differs lies in a political excuse.

[PS:] graffiti seen a while back in Belgrade / Serbia...: BETTER DEAD THAN SKINHEAD
