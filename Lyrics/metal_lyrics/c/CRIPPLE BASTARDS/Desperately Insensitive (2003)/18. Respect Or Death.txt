aka the invincible "2 eyes for 1 eye" theory
Did we ever had a word?
Offence is taken - the sandglass is running
what the fuck did we ever share in this world?
You failed once - you'll pay 10 x
..setting up fire to a stake from now on burning up your ass
U N R E M O V A B L E
Offence is taken - face my doublesided genes:
SIDE I) kindness, elegance hospitality
--spitting on these manners you felt in the backdoor
SIDE II) carelessness equals repression
--now discover a race wth no sense of diplomacy;
under this friendly exterior -
a shroud of red, squealing nerves.
WEIGH UP EVERY SINGLE FUCK YOU SAY
GAIN YOUR PRIDE, 2 EYES FOR 1 EYE
IF DISHONOUR COMES - GIVE REVENGE
LIFE FOR US HAS LEFT NO TEARS
