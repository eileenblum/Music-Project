Half-sleep, staring at an impending fatal widow
the mask of my downfall shining in this night of ordinary quiet.
CHOOSE____ : chained to insecuty / forsaken by purity /
another game of jealousy we won't get rid of. /
Invisible glue quick-setting hopes, temper, resolution.
Cornered by a puzzle-shaped situation no move could float to the top.
Entering an era of psychotropics, sadness, asocialism
then violence echoing like a whale goin' adrift to its death.
CHOOSE____ : greet this phase of slavery / sink into a rien-ne-va-plus of empathy /
weak human psychology every sentence a stab.
Abuse me, slander my dignity,
give me scars, humiliations, more piss to swallow,
slice through the flesh &gt;&gt; let blood spatter until I faint
divulge my defects then burst into laughter,
trample on the thin shore I still dare to call "LIFE"...
have fun as long as it comes my turn.

ME &amp; HER LOST TO NOWHERE
PINCHING THE PSYCHE, A PARANOID BRAIN FOLDER.
