I look in her eyes, I see the walls of this city - I HATE HER
socially dominant, a female corpse kept alive by rules - I HATE HER
avid, spoilt, majesty in a little puddle of piss - I HATE HER
blocks our freedom with asphalt, infects our blood with morals - I HATE HER
She went to the butcherâs and bought 2 Kg of blood-stenching meat
I HATE HER

She attended mass and bought Godâs mercy: âcharity &amp; loveâ
I HATE HER

She voted for a moralist dick, âto suffocate all immigrants in their own pitful shitâ
I HATE HER

She came back home and taught her sons to abhor those like me
I HATE HER

Consume your shameful dinner,
then drug your brain with TV-fix - I HATE HER
do the slut with your husband,
somebody said âfrequent sex = rejuvenateâ - I HATE HER
take the children to school,
be sure to grow them strong, proud and blind as shit - I HATE HER
support ghettoisation...
your raceâs âsense of propertyâ to banish minorities - I HATE HER
