People are walls...
walls symbolizing ignorance and prejudices;
radically separated from us - neglecting our pain.

Dishonesty and lies are everywhere...
fantastic, inevitable standards subliminally introduced
in every kind of human relationship.

People are walls... walls trapping our freedom.
Prejudices are their weapons
and we are immobilized targets.

We, a weak/frangible minority
walking on rotten roots.
We, the collapsing cages,
surrounded by arrows pointed at our hearts.

Prejudices and walls.
Fierce eyes, raising affliction.
Prejudices and walls.
A nest incubating my death.
