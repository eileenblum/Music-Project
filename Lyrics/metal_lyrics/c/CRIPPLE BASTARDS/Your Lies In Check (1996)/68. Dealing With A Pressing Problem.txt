A bled, faded woman dressed in black,
a barrier of cement, your cadaveric paper-smiles.
We can't be on overtime.
We can't be on overtime.
Baseless problems are giving more and more discontent;
it's time to present your rightist/nationalist ideology
as "a simple solution to the deep economic crisis"...
I look upon myself:
"We can't unleash our words". WHY?
I look upon myself:
"We can't overstep the mark settled by our exasperation". WHY?
Silent normality - fertile land for nazism and racism.
Indifferent mentality - hiding bigotry and systemised prejudice.
Consent reality - dawn of violence and oppression.
We can't be on overtime.
We can't be on overtime.
