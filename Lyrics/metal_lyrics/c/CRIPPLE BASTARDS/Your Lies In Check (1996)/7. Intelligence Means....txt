Ignorance deleted interesting forms of rebellion.
But on the other side "strong" minds mangled our existences.

We can't refuse it, we have to reach a sort of mental balance
which can give us the security to use our own intelligence
without damaging our world.

[COMMENTARY:]
A cross between perfection and disgrace - intelligence;
the only hand driving our fates, the only presence marking our lives.
Like a double edged knife,
glittering on one side and bloodstained on the other...
Development and positive culture
in eternal contrast with lies, cruelties, profit and deadly power.
Choose your own progress-line.
