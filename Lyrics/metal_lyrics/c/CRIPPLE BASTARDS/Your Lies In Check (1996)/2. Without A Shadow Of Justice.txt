Yesterday I sat on this ground, waiting for a reconciliatory look.
I waited... in the hope of seeing it.
(But my optimistic enthusiasm was broken off...)
Without a shadow of justice.
When "someone" will call down his revenge,
upon these grey, rotting walls...
(...your innocent world will break down)
I'm waiting, in the hope of seeing him.
Without a shadow of justice.
