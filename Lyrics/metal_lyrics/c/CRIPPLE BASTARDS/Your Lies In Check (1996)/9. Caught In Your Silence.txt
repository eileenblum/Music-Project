[The following passage is a sort of monologue written by somebody who's not here anymore. This is neither a text nor a poem; it's just a sequence of feelings and emotions dropped on paper in wild confusion and mental shock...]

"To suffer an injustice...
The ring breaks, it's corroded by the acidity of time,
your life's a castle of cards in the midst of a storm.
Once again... hate is the only friend left to embrace.

Sad to see you explode, vomiting bitter tears,
and look at you... arms ruined with a blade,
blood dripping onto a defeated shadow,
furrows opening up in flesh...
They'll never be as deep as the ones you have inside.

Nice to see you hope, build visual paradoxes,
so far from those around you, so near to the one inside you.

A shadow of regret... but what's left of those days?
Blood on your thoughts, for all the times you cried.

Caught in your silence, among millions people,
too many lives - too many problems...

They have a brain.... but no time to use it.
So... no-one could approve,
no-one should approve,
no-one could approve, no-one could..." HE'S GONE.

[SOME SENTENCES USED IN THE SONG:]
No-one should approve.
Believing in your lies - HERE SOMETHING MUST BE CHANGED.
The smell of women's cries - IT'S HAPPENING TO ME AGAIN.
As my heart tends to approve... MY MIND STANDS, FUCKIN' RIP-OFF!!
