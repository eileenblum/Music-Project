A raving world at my back,
my mind bursts into cold tears.
Another day ended in pain.
This is a routine that will go on year after year.
When I am enveloped by darkness
my eyes continue to see...
there's a wall in front of me,
a wall that obstructs all my plans.
When the silence absorbs my room
my mind is deep in thought...
my protest died but my hate survived
and it'll prevent me from falling asleep.
MY SERENITY IS ABOUT TO DIE.
MY SERENITY WON'T STEP ASIDE.
