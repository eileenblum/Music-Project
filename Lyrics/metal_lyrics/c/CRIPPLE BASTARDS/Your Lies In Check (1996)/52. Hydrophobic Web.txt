[COMMENTARY:]
Invisible chip of emotions projected in the human sphere,
uncertainty or sadness are the only reactions of a fanciful mind;
Sense of perversion, aggressive hate...
stagnant feelings entangled in sinews.
My brain's wrapped by hydrophobic webs.
Your plastic existence will conduct it near the nervous breakdown.
My conformity would mean complete annihilation, mental blackout.
Suicide left as the ultimate act of freedom, escape. But no, not for you.
WHERE PEOPLE SEE A PROMISING FUTURE
I CAN ONLY DISCERN AN ENDLESS ABYSS.
