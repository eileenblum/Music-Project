WHO'S GOT THE 50 DM ON CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?? [x4]
[Then no lyrics, just vocalized hatred and insults]

[COMMENTARY:]
Your nervous eyes in search of love -
always discontented, melancholic, bewildered.
Few minutes of pleasure and then... goodbye.
Your compensation is narrow, the effort inevitably pathetic.
September, 18th 1993. The visionary freedom of a filthy stupid bitch.
Today charismatic heroine, tomorrow unwanted trash.
