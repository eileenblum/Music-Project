[COMMENTARY]:
Frantic crowds of suit and tie idiots,
and the sickening threat of being like them,
trapped into their aseptic models.

"Earnestness"
- something I can't call freedom... too rigid.

"Ratiocination"
...but where's a smile among those upset screens,
always standing on the same old picture: money.

Disagreeable selections:
- you die in comfortable emptiness /
- I live my tragic oddness, alone but free.
