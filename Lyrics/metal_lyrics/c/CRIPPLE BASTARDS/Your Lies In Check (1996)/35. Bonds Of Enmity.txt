Suffered characters engraved in my nerves.
Don't ask me the reason... verify:
my conflict goes on, I assert my rights.
I assert my rights - Disconnection.
I assert my rights - Separation.
I assert my rights - Violation.
I assert my rights - Usurpation.

[COMMENTARY:]
Violent culture flogging my ideas,
middle-class arrogance screwing my life.
I can't resign, my conflict goes on.
I assert my rights,
sunk in their shit... clinged to my freedom.
