You told me that I'm a paranoiac
'cos I'm a person who lives on stressing joints,
'cos there's nothing I love in this fuckin' world,
so you told that my brain is psychologically insane...

Open your ears fuckin' asshole,
I'd rather choose the way of an insane paranoiac
than follow a plastic society again and again...
MY HATE AGAINST CONFORMITY IS AN UNAFFECTED FEELING!!

I'd rather choose the way of an insane paranoiac...
I'd rather choose the way of an insane paranoiac...
