Forced smile. Internal delays. Concentrate of lies.
Your intransigent simpathy to obtain my conformity.
Your intransigent simpathy to change my opinions.

[COMMENTARY:]
Your eyes - Repugnant triangles scratching my face.
Intransigent - Promulgator of a well-mannered mentality,
too mediocre for being assimilated.
PEOPLE SMILING, INSIDE DISGUSTED.
HATING ME, THE INFECTED.
