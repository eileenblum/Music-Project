A dark threat assaulting my life again,
time has come to wear a uniform and obey...
It's the worst phase of their systemized repression,
It's a psychophisical indoctrination...
a dark threat insulting my rights again.
- Carried away, eyes filled with pain,
what have I done for having so much to pay?
after 21 years of corrosive disdain...
more restrictions, why?
More restrictions. Why?
- Carried away, eyes filled with pain,
stuck in the grip of your military chain,
death from the hands of another system's prey...
..It's a calculated doom.
