[COMMENTARY:]
God is an imposition to justify
the insecurities of those who feel most secure,
a lurid insult to human intelligence,
a shameful parody that has been going on for thousands years.
THERE'S NOTHING ON EARTH,
NOTHING THAT COMES FROM HIS (ITS) HANDS.

God is an empty room, without walls or windows,
an abyss of illusions dug by people's ignorance.
God means waste, thousands of beings massacred,
mountains of money thrown away or stolen,
tons of bricks used to build his damned monuments...
THERE'S NOTHING ON EARTH,
NOTHING THAT COMES FROM HIS (ITS) HANDS.

Or perhaps, yes, there is something...
There's pain, intolerance, violence.
The dishonesty of those who represent him.
The only waters in which I can see his image reflected,
are soaked with blood, fear, hatred.
