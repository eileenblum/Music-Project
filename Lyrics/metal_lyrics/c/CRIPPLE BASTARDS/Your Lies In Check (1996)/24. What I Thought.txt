Far away from me, perhaps this is the best solution.
Drown in the abyss of your mediocrities,
return to life as a loser - smile lazily at your "rebel" past...
Disappear into the crowd that not long ago you hated and accused,
but which, after all, isn't so different from you...
You're deeply attracted,
a new existence falling into same old routines.
Foreseeable actions, you're nothing without them.
IT DOESN'T RUN IN YOUR VEINS /
CAN'T BE ASSIMILATED BY YOUR MIND.

[COMMENTARY:]
Lacking enthusiasm and individuality,
feel the usefulness of "being against",
disappear in a non-protesting crowd.
Punk seen as a childish fashion. Museum-freak.
