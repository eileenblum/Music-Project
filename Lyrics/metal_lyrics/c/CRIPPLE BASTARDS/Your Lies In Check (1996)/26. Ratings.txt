My life can't close itself in a hole,
can't vanish in the sad waiting list of those who have lost before they've begun,
of those who haven't gone beyond the gates of an imposed normality.
Forced hate, I wish I had never met you.
Tears of boredom, snapped nerves, instant horror.
I see my body move from one cage to another,
I spend my days cultivating apathy, disinterest, suffocated violence.
I feel offended and inoffensive, a headstone stuck in cement - a broken candle.
Hanged in silence, the disappointment is reciprocal.
Kicks in the teeth, everyday, explode in your houses, in your schools, in your streets...
A INCREASE OF "CULTURE" - AN ABANDONMENT OF FEELINGS.

[COMMENTARY:]
Creativity against passive dependence,
diversion against imposed standardization.
Give the right value to individuality...
don't fall in the nullity of a speechless crowd.

LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES, INVENTING ONE'S LIFE, THIS MEANS LIVING.
