[COMMENTARY ON A WINTER DAY IN VUKOVAR. 1992 CHILDREN PLAYING UNDER THE SNOW]

The bomb has completed its flight
and now it's exploding among innocent children...
FACES TWISTED WITH FEAR...
There's no time to realize
what has caused this immense pain,
RED ON WHITE, THE METAPHOR IS CLEAR...
Images of war / Images of pain.
Images of war / Images of pain.

[SOMETHING MORE TO ADD:]
"The game has been the same for centuries;
players change, masters change, weapons develop,
but the result is always the same - murder.
There's nothing progressive, nothing good,
just suffering, fear and pain.
On every side victims...
here from communism to nationalism,
there from democracy to leftists or nazis,
rightists or stalinists, capitalists etc. etc...
It's all the same - the only thing that changes is the iconography.
Killers became heroes, heroes became kings,
liars became lawyers, real men became traitors and cowards.
What an irony." [Taken from B.Z.R.'s Split LP with Nula]
