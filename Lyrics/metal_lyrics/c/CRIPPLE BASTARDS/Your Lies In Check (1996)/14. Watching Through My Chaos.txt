It's deadly and empty,
fogbanks on a motorway..
..where my life is a car without lights and brakes
driven at full-speed by a confused mind.
Watching through my chaos.
Inactivity is my endless masturbation,
too many things to do - unable to give'em a right order
and choose where to start.
I'm a child - lost in my universe,
a mixture of creative ideas and frustrating schemes.
Watching through my chaos.
