Walk away... to a suffered world.
(vocalized hatred)
Walk away... Do you think to be sincere?
Do you need it??
(vocalized hatred)
After days made up of months, you walked away from me.
After days made up of months, you walked away from me.
After days made up of months, you walked away from me.

[COMMENTARY:]
Left behind in the abyss of despair
too far from your phallic reality,
where ideas and spontaneity
are replaced by cold carnal contacts.
