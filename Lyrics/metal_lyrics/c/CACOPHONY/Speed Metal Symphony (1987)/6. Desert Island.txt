So much obnoxious noise
I want to spend my life at the beach
I'm getting tired of the daily shouting
City gets the worst of me

I'm on the desert island
In the middle of the sea
Put a message in a bottle
That's all you'll hear from me

I need some time to loosen up
Get my head on straight
If I don't leave this city
I think I'll go insane

I'm on the desert island
In the middle of the sea
Put a message in a bottle
That's all you'll hear from me

Desert Island, out in the sun
Desert Island, out in the heat

I want some real sunshine
Can't you I'm crying out
Break the wall that you built up
And listen to me shout

I'm on the desert island
In the middle of the sea
Put a message in a bottle
That's all you'll hear from me

Desert Island, out in the sun
Desert Island, out in the heat

Desert Island, out in the sun
Desert Island, out in the heat
