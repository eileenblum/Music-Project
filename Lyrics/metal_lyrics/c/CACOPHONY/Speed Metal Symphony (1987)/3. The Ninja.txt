The sun was red and to the right
The scene behind me was so bright
On the land where fighting has been 
And honor meant to a man

The characters shined from inside my mind
One meant strength, one meant to live
Ninja
Ninja

The sword made of steel, the Ninja did bear
Destroying what came in his path
So distant the fear
A dying legend, waiting to leave
Away from the past
The Ninja cries out desperately
With a vengeance he rides

The characters shined from inside my mind
One meant strength, one meant to live
Ninja
Ninja

Ninja
Ninja
