Took a chance, rolled the dice
Played my cards, won't think twice
Gambling all I can
Never quit, until I win
All my life, played the game
The outcomes always the same

When the day turns into night
And the world is passing by
See my fortune where it lies, on the line
And my quest for it seems bright
Taking all the risk insight
See my fortune where it lies, on the line

Got to win, it's my turn
Yesterdays are bridges burned
Spin the wheel, once again
Waiting for the day I win

Still I'm searching every day,
I don't know any other way

When the day turns into night
And the world is passing by
See my fortune where it lies, on the line
And my quest for it seems bright
Taking all the risk insight
See my fortune where it lies, on the line
