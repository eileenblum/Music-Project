He is a master of the ultimate empire
A shattered nation, a victim of his fire
They hold the secret in their hand 
And he will ascend upon command

Burn the ground
He walks on
Burn the ground

He was created from a violent combination
He brought destruction and mass contamination
Now there's a second chance for you 
But will you leave to see it through

[2x]
Burn the ground
He walks on
Burn the ground

He was created from a violent combination
And now our nation is a victim of his fire 
They hold the secret in their hand 
And he will ascend upon command

Burn the ground
He walks on
Burn the ground
