I spend the endless nights looking out the window
My eyes are clouded by the haze

There's something out there waiting in the dark
Something I'm too blind to see

I'm gonna take you on a journey, she said
The Earth will spin, desire fills the night

There's something out there waiting in the dark
Something I'm too blind to see

The floating world like a wheel it will turn
I'm living out some twisted dream
The floating world like a cyclone it will turn
And I know you're out there somewhere

I feel the pulses beating faster in my heart
On comes a fear I've never known

There's something out there waiting in the dark
Something I'm too blind to see

The floating world like a wheel it will turn
I'm living out some twisted dream
The floating world like a cyclone it will turn
And I know you're out there somewhere

The floating world like a wheel it will turn
I'm living out some twisted dream
The floating world like a cyclone it will turn
And I know you're out there somewhere

The floating world
I know you're out there some where
