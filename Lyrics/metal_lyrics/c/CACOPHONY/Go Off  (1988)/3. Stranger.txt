Don't strike in fear, so hard to see
Yeah the monsters in my mind they're eating all my time

There's a stranger in your dreams
Like a shadow in the night
I'm a stranger in your dreams
And there's nowhere you can hide

I can't get out nowhere to go
No future here, I'm hard as stone

There's a stranger in your dreams
Like a shadow in the night
I'm a stranger in your dreams
Stranger
And there's nowhere you can hide
Nowhere you can hide

You lie awake lost in your dream
There's no escape away from me
Stranger in your dreams
Stranger
Like a shadow in the night
Shadow in the night
I'm a stranger in your dreams
I'm a stranger
And there's nowhere you can hide
Nowhere to hide
