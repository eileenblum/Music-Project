You got X-ray eyes
I'm loose wandering through the night
The animal comes out in sight
Hidden eyes no visible disguise
Can cover up your twisted mind

Now I wonder what you'd do
If you saw me how I saw you

You got X-ray eyes, like diamonds in the night
You got X-ray eyes, lookin' right through me

All alone, reflections in the mirror
Coming out through the night
Mind attack flashback like a nightmare
Anticipate the light

Now I wonder what you'd do
If you saw me how I saw you

Lights are out all across the city
It's time to hit the streets
There's no doubt, no compromise, no pity
It's time for you to be beat
Now I wonder what you'd do
(What you'd do)
If you saw me how I saw you

You got X-ray eyes, like diamonds in the night
You got X-ray eyes, lookin' right through me

You got X-ray eyes, like diamonds in the night
You got X-ray eyes, lookin' right through me
