A livin' nightmare through darkened days
I see the future, invest in ways,
I'll tell the fortune, I'll risk my life
There's no end to this madness
And there's no end in sight

I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down

To stop the sinner clench the fist
Don't believe what I predict
Don't fuel my hunger, don't fuel my drive
It might be tryin' to get out of this place alive

I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down

There is a vision in my mind and its extra sensory
I am the only one left behind possessing E.S.P.
Possession obsession will fuel my oppression beware
Don't tempt me I'm dangerous, or try to lock me away
Ascension dissention I show no intention or fear
If E.S.P. guides me why can't I see a way out

I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down

There is a vision in my mind and its extra sensory
I am the only one left behind possessing E.S.P.

There is a vision in my mind and its extra sensory
I am the only one left behind possessing E.S.P.
