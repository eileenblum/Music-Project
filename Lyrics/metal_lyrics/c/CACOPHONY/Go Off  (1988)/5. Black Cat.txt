Sleek and shiny, dark and fast
Never let it cross your path
The panic begins, its a battle you'll never win
She'll bait the trap, don't mess with the Black Cat

Superstition isn't true
Could it be maybe I love you?
The panic begins, its a battle you'll never win
She'll bait the trap, don't mess with the Black Cat

Don't mess with the Black Cat
If you believe in superstition
Don't turn your back
Never mess with a black cat

Blazin' eyes, stalk the night
Cold and hungry in the dark
The panic begins, its a battle you'll never win
she'll bait the trap, don't mess with the black cat

Don't mess with the Black Cat
If you believe in superstition
Don't turn your back
Never mess with a black cat

Don't mess with the black cat
If you believe in superstition
Don't turn your back
Never mess with a black cat
