Ticking, ticking, ticking,
My final impression
I'm too late, warrior lost in time
Destruction will surely be hell
It's plain, yeah I see it in the stars

Ticking a force unrelenting
The stage was set
God give you life never ending
I will forget
We won't forget
The sword of the warrior
Sung with steel
We won't forget
The sword of the warrior
Sung with steel

Tripping malorder and pain
Battle cry lost in a modern world
Madness will soon be displayed
Sword of steel it's the test of time

Ticking a force unrelenting
The stage was set
God give you life never ending
I will forget
We won't forget
The sword of the warrior
Sung with steel
We won't forget
The sword of the warrior
Sung with steel
