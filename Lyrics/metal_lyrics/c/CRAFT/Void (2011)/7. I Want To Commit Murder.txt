I have only one last wish before my time comes to an end. Something I have craved for far too long: to ease my hunger. I want to commit murder! Knowing you exist makes me sick. I want to tie you down. I want to carve you. I want to see the image of death through your teary, blank eyes. I want to commit murder! My mind screams to me like a black metal record in dissonant accord. My mind sings to me murder songs, into passionate frenzy. I want to dig your grave. I want to collect your shadow. I want to terminate your body. I want to commit murder!
