On the issue of whether to live by their two-faced norms: if you are proud, if you are strong, there must be just as strong contention. Succumb to sin. Your concern is yours alone. Work hard to earn your Mark of Cain, then wear it like a badge of honour. God's got nothing on you anyway. Your idols are amorality, untamed mind and chasmic reason. Transgressions get things done, and you are infinitely greater for it. Morality is significant like sound in vacuum. Be proud to wear your Mark of Cain. Wear it like a badge of honour. God's got nothing on you anyway.
