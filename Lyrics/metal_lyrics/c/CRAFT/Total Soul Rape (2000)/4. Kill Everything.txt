Fire, floods, devastation, murder, rape, obliteration, revolution, hate. 
Hell, heaven, collision. Beautiful diseases. 
You deserve all my praise, for I have seen the wornderful ways You erase! 
All deaths come as such release... 
Kill anything. Kill everything! 
Any god serves me that serves my beliefs
