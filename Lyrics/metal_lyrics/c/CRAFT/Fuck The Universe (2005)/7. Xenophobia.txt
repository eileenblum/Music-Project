Hate
...the clouds, the rain, the air that lets life-forms breathe.
...the land, the sea, the places where the humans breed.
...the skyline, the zenith, where the sun rises, travels, and sets.
...the homes, the lands, the places of shelter for man.

Back to your past, human.
All dust.
All hail xenophobia.

Hate
...their hands, their claws, longing to spread disease.
...theirs minds, their flesh, asking to be abused.
...their laws, their gods, basic and weak in their essence.
...their fiends, their fears, so small and oh so trivial.

Back to you past, humans.
I hate you all.
