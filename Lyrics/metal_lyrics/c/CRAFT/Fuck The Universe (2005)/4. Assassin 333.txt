[Lyrics by Shamaatae]

Wrathful forces unleash themselves via disturbances through the cosmos.
Darkness absorbing stars.
Kliffotic elements defiling life.

Uex and madness switch the essence of happiness.
The essence of the human mind is now contaminated.
The eleven gods then follow - mocking, destroying, annihilating.

The twelve are distinguishing, as the serpent splay it's oriface.
The seven returns to zero, as the cosmic turbulence fades.

Spirits are burning in black flames - souls of false matter abolishes into nothing.
Weakling gods of cosmic ways devoured by forgotten malignity.

Nothingness stands - bearers of the black light are coming, followed by everlasting Chaos.
