Hail the ways that lead beyond the mysteries.
Hail the key of disrespect.
Hail the key that unlocks the inner flame disguised as hate.
Firstborn out of Hell

Fuck the universe.
Its drowning in it's own blood.
Leave it here to die.
Hail the key, Misanthropy.

Hail the ways that lead beyond the worldly.
Hail the key of sacrifice.
Hail the never-ending source of negativity.
Unholy chalice for kings.

Hail the ways that lead beyond the cosmos.
Hail the gate of Leviathan.
The see the world be greeted by The Origin already dwelling in black hearts.
Hail the silent gift of total death, which is the final rest.
When souls revel in the void.
When YHVH had his defeat.

Fuck the universe.
Its drowning in it's own blood.
Leave it here to die.
Hail the key, Misanthropy.

Oh, the glorious darkness that has come to us now when the hated light is extinguished forever.
Listen to the relief of Lilith's children, and hear the final breath of YHVH.
