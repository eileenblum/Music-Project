We are messengers 
Of future times to die 
We will show you the way 
And you need to follow us 

This is the dawn of your race 
And the dusk of your enemies 
For they will need to be killed 
Killed...killed...killed...killed 

Killed forever in eternity 
We rage forever in eternity 

This is the beginning of the end
