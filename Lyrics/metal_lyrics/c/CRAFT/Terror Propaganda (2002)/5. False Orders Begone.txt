Once you can see 
The sun rise from the earth 
Direction to the sky 

And once you can feel 
Rain fall down on your skin 
Once you have skin 

(in pain....in blood.....) 
In what you have blessed 
(in blood.....) 

What you have is eternal 
You have the pain in my 
In my....world 

Pain of the memories, of the ruthless world 
Which once were in the hidden order 
War soldiers run remembering the war 
The emptiness swallowing...all
