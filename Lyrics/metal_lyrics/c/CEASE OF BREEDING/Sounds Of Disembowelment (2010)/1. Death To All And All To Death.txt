I hate the world, I hate the humans, I hate them
I pray everyday to darkness, I pray for a destruction
I dream of extinction
I can't take it anymore, I'm sick of their faces
I wish I could drown them in their own blood
Break their little necks, stomp their fucking faces
I'm sick of them, burn them, boil them
I must do whatever it takes to disappear their pitiful existence
Take the fucking happiness from them, they don't deserve it
Kill every fucking human who is laughing, I'm sick of you
Pathetic scums

MAKE THEM STOP, PUT THEM IN THE GROUND
BRING MISERY TO THEM
HANG 'EM, IMPALE 'EM, DESTROY 'EM
DEATH TO ALL AND ALL TO DEATH
