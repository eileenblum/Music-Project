Another foggy morning has come, the stench of death is coming from the window
I hear the sound of the role around their neck, it sounds like music to my ears
Vultures with pieces of flesh in their mouths
Flies all around the bodies, what a wonderful picture
Another good morning, another good sightseeing

Every day I touch their cold flesh, I want to feel their suffering
I love the taste of the dead, I adore their blank eyes, the smell of decompose
Every man behaves differently when they die, I love the excitement of someones
death
I really enjoy the process of strangulation, I cut carefully some parts of them
and I pull out their entrails
This is the signature of my art, my unique hobby makes Neva unique person

My list is getting bigger, day by day I hunt them down
Becoming part of my collection
I choose them randomly, I have bodies of all ages, everyone here had a
personality
Everyone here had a name, I hang them from a pole, I really like my yard full
of them
I have a unique collection, the sight of hanged men always makes my day
Collecting hanged men is my addiction
