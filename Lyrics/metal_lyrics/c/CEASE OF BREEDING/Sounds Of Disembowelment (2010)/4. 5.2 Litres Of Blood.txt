A bucket filled with blood
An opened body with all it's fluids spilled out
All walls are painted with it
Painted with 5.2 litres of blood
Every drop drained from the body
Gathered in a green plastic bucket
The stink of blood is covering the small room
All the organs have been disposed
Some of them are in the corner of the room
The blood is used for paint
This red colour is considered by some as inspiring
Some believe that blood is better
Some enjoy the scene of it
5.2 litres of blood is all that a human body can contain
It's all used for paint, for blood red paint
