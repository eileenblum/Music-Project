I collected all the bodies in my residence, I put them down beneath in my
darkest room
I covered their screams with my sounds of pleasure
I have nailed all the corpses, I have nailed them upon my wall
I have nailed all their organs, I have nailed all their limbs

I have tasted all the bodies, I had pleasures on their flesh
I have nailed all the corpses, I disfigured all the bodies

I collect them from day to day, I am searching to destroy
I have nailed all the corpses, I can take them down with me

I am a superior human being, I hunt them for my own pleasure
I enjoy their tears of fear, I kill for I am the one who they worship!
