Sound of broken bones, cracked skulls, empty shells
Sound of blood spilled out of the neck
Choked voices of dismembered humans
Sick and perverted sounds all over the room
Cries from tortured souls begging me to release them

I have made it through here, my salvation is at close
The quantity of the dead bodies shall be written in history
The scars on my body reveals the number of victims
My mind is aching, I haven't got much time, I have to gather more

Sounds of disembowelment like a music in my ears
Sounds of disembowelment like a fucking disease
Sounds of disembowelment an addiction to me
Sounds of disembowelment like a fucking disease

I must see them dead, all of them dead, all of them dead
I have to hurry, the time is running quick
They shall not find me, I shall murder more
I must salvage my soul, my work hasn't ended yet
The world must see what I achieved
They must see what I can do
My mind is aching but the sounds of disembowelment
Makes the ache stop
