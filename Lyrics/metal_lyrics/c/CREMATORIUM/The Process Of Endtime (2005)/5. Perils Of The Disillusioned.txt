Don't let yourself be fooled

The left hand path has 
Grown over with these idealistic
Notions of glorification

Through the idiosyncratic
Social diagram sketched out
Through lesser forms of communication

The righteous treck has been
Mortified in a gradial decline
Through helpless humiliation

There has got to be a way
A better way to live
There has got to be a time
A better time to live
Before the sacrifice
Of the falsified law

The way I see this
Slow down
The way we'll end this
Slow down

From above this all
Our problems must seem so small
So miniscule on the grander scale
When measured against what's trully hell

Your gene pool has been poisoned 
With the common place surrealism
When what we need is to adopt 
A true form of nihilism

The way I see this
Slow down
The way we'll end this
Slow down

Twisting and turning the words
Into doctrines of fear
And warlike glorification

Discard the meanings
Suffocating progression to
Any form of communication

Eroding at the foundations
Spreading horrid distaste
Through global humiliation

This fear of death
Look what it's spawned
A trend of followers
That fall behind the pawn
Wretching in this world
With our plagues and disease
Walking hand in hand
Into the boiling seas

Fools
