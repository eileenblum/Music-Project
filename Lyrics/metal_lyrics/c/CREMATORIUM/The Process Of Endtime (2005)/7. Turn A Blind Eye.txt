The fruits of soiled remains
Petrified growth process
Blocking out life
Spreading seeds of spite
Shaping blinding light
As if we don't need this life
As if we need our lies
Decades of erosion shaping
Foundations of culture
While fueling movements
Of a regression from
Anything resembling humankind
As if we don't need this life
As if we need these lies

Knocked down
Dead from the inside
In the syncopations of which we call life
Born to never realize
We're rotting from the inside

Brought down from the palaces
Like a monument
Brought down from the palaces
As a deviant life

While

War machines are born to suffer
Encompassing the slavekind
War machines are bred to suffer
Marching for the godlike

Blind our eyes
One by one
Get in line

Mythologies
Spreading plagues
Meant to distract
Census of light
Furthur divides
Produce a mask of flies
As if we don't need this life
As if we need their lies
Continuing to be drowned
As if we don't want this life
As if we need our lies

Knocked down
Dead from the inside
In the syncopations of which we call life
We're born to never realize
We're rotting from the inside

Brought down from the palaces
Like a monument
Brought down from the palaces
As a deviant life
