We are the choice of a new generation
But to me all this shit tastes the same

Gaps between the ages filled with the same selling points
Over and over and over again

Will we seek a life that we construct on our own
Or will we scream for a change that's so unclear
I know that this life belongs to you
And you bow down to no one else
But we could do so much better
Without these bullshit scenes

How can we see a change
When we ourselves sell out to survive their game

While filling the next generation
With anger fueled through hatred and angst

Spread the sickness
We're blind
Create the sickness
That binds

Creating the futures loss
Through words clouded by fear
While the shepards gain
What they stood against

Spread the sickness
We're blind
We are the sickness
And our ignorance is not bliss

Will we seek a life that we construct on our own
Or will we scream for a change that's so unclear
I know that this life belongs to you
And you bow down to no one else
But we could do so much better
Without these bullshit scenes

While we sit here and point our crooked little fingers
Of non-conformity through mass conformity

Fiscal gains overshadow the messages
And then we'll be the ones for which they sing
