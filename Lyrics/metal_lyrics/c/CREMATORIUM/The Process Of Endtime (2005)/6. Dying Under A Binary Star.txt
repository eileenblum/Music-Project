These technological upgrades 
Are ruling our decisions in life
The bitterest of the summers harvest
A constant reminder of What we've come to lose
What we've choose

Reset into the blank emptiness
Voices
Life...reprogrammed

Binary fiction is rewriting
The history books to exclude
Hands free while the prophets 
Code your kingdoms doom
A constant grain of salt 
In the dead wound

The silicon mother board replaced your family value
While the fillament desires teach our youth the decline

Draining our resources to satisfy our desires
For an easier time in our controlled environments
Contracting unending spools of technology
Replacing our supernova with this created
Incumbent
Binary star

When we give up our right to think 
For an easy way out we build machines 
To encompass our goals in life
Science fiction becomes the new life 
Horrid reality we learn face
Creations rise in utter disdain 
Recoding the food chain
Changing the face of our dismay

Our dismay

Systematically wiring past the law 
Of the sun cloning back the molecules 
That bind the chains of reality 
Optic strands run in normality
The ghost erased we become replaced
Footprints in sand covered over with electric grace
Completely controlled by the machines we create
In a hopeless state, we destroy fate
