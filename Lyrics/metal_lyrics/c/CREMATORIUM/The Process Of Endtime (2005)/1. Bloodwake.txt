Writhe
Within this inner struggle
Which we call rebellion
And the hopeless masses
Decaying under nations
We speak in so many tongues
Only to keep repeating
Same old nothings
Into the same dead

Fabrications made of cold steel
The seperations are bred within the veins
Through the desecration of your creators soul
And the illusions of your governing controls

Breaking through life
Facing bloodshined eyes
Ending it with home made cyanide
With your man made kerosene
Swallow it all down

Born only to fail
Created only to fall

Fabrications made of cold steel
The seperations are bred within the veins
Through the desecration of your creators soul
And the illusions of your governing controls
