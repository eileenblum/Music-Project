We breed new life
As the dead rise
Through the deadtides
We seek new life
As the dead rise
Through the deadtides

Have we found ourselves
In the twilight of our days
Have we found ourselves
As the dead rise
Through the deadtides
Of our

Life's
Incumbence
So
Revealing
Mirrors
Reflecting
The
Childlike
Natures

And the fear that we've created 
In our own image

This time we've gone to far

We condition the unborn
To prepare for the misfortunes

We breed new life
As the dead rise
Through the deadtides
We seek new life
As the dead rise
Through the deadtides

Have we found ourselves
In the twilight of our days
Have we found ourselves
As the dead rise
Through the deadtides
Of our

Life's 
The coiled lifeless serpent 
With the blackest of eyes
Lurking in the shadows 
Of our forgotten paths
Bodies are endlessHopeless
In our search for
Our endless nothings
