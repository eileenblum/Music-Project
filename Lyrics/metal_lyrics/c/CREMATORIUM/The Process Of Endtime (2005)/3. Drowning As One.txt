Someday that real rain is gonna come
A sea salted with many tears
Rivers originating from mountaintops
Washing away these countless years
Cleansing the face to a clean slate
A natural way of clock resetting
Leaving behind only broken trusts
Of a time based on bloodletting

Will we
Seek the shelter
Or remain
Open armed
To accept
Our given endtime
And give back
To what we've harmed

As we drown as one
Can't soon forget

Someday the real rain is gonna come
The only way to wash away sins
Rivers ripping down the mountain tops
Bringing it back to where we will begin
Cleansing our history to a clean slate
Blowing out the sun to a final set
Leaving behind only blowing dust
So our timelines can soon forget

Time is not on our side
And time will soon forget
Plagues of arrogant minds
Erasing with one final
One final
Time is not on our side
And time will soon forget
Plagues of arrogant minds
Erasing with one final
One final blow

Corrosion
Corroding
Burying all of this Atlantis
A modern day Babylon
This utopia is banished
To a dying end
Melting the pillars of salt
Into caustic gasses
Suffocating
Choking out
The skyline

Let the next species exist

Someday that real rain is gonna come
A sea salted with many tears
Rivers originating from mountaintops
Washing away these countless years
Washing the faces away to a clean slate
Enshrouding the entire earth with ice
Leaving behind only our frozen tears
As an epitaph to the final price We payed

As we
As we drown as one

Time is not on our side
And time will soon forget
Plagues of arrogant minds
Erasing with one final
One final
Time is not on our side
And time will soon forget
Plagues of arrogant minds
Erasing with one final
One final blow
