Huddling together
In this crude little wasteland
You're building a figment
Of your imagination into reality
Symbolisms painted
With the stars and stripes
Ropes tied down
And anchored through depravity
Using fear
To propel this monolith
Masking the truth
And the intentions of your legions
Of our failing sun
Reconstructing a regime
Under the nose of millions
With your blind approval
With your mindless consent

Wretching through
Violated house of dreams
Puked out
Into the killing scheme
Through these well lit halls
Building up
Matter at all
Reconstruct a regime
Under the nose of millions

Ten tall buildings crashing down
Upon this house of lust
A storm of dust and boiling blood
Prophecy of broken trust
Wires whip through the sky
Electrical fire sparks fly
Pressure expands against the glass
Windows burst like exploding hearts 
Everything they've ever told you
It was all a lie
Everything you meant to them

Was meant as a lie

You meant nothing to them

Memories run from the surface to drain
Penitent soldiers in tunnels of veins
This is a forbidden time
As this all was meant as a lie
