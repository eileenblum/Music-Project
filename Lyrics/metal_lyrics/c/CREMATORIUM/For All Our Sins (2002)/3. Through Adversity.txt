I don't see any sign of life
I consider these sins as such as life
I can't see anything shining through
I can't turn the cheek
To your hand of doom

Trick wires pulse as the season is lost
What you have suffered is not what you've lost
Writing yourself until nothing is gone
Loosing yourself within this day
Watching youself swimming in cost
Running yourself until the symptoms are lost

Alone with ones self

I'm staring at the sun
Watching myself witness the end
I'm staring at the son
Asking myself is this the end
I'm staring at the sun
Watching myself
Is this the end

This is your life in hell

Washing sin in the racist sun again
Want to know why this life is times again
Wash myself in these lifeless times again

And I was taught to do unto others
Before I do unto myself

Washing in chemicals
Everything's lost
Loosing the lies that we've studied so well
Bury yourself to nothing at all costs
Living yourself like there's nothing to trust
I don't see any sign of life
Watching these sins through my bloodshot eyes
Loosing myself unto times of disgrace
Loosing the life until nothing is left
These are the tools used to bury this life
Bury myself goodbye to my lies
I stand against the grain
Only to loose
Again

I'm staring at the sun
Watching myself witness the end
I'm staring at the son
Asking myself is this the end
I'm staring at the sun
Watching myself
Is this the end

Forever
I shall lay
Silent
With myself
