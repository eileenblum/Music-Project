It seems
We've lost touch with the
True voices
Inside ourselves
We've let our inner thoughts be stiffled
By a reality we can not see
We've laid witness to the rape
And destruction of our earth
Letting guilt
As old as your time
Keep the wool
Over your fucking eyes
For god and country
What happened to
For life and humanity

I'm not a sheep
I will not be
Led to the slaughter
You can only do so much
On your knees
With your eyes sewn shut
Stand up and take a true look
A true look at the hell
That we've all created

Unlearn

Free will
Thought to be a sin
Loved narrowed down
To promote racism
Like puppets
Being pulled through life
On Strings
Woven with lies
This is the way
That you Choose
To build your false utopia
This is the way
I choose
To build my false rebellion
For god and country
What happened to
For life and humanity

I'm not a sheep
I will not be
Led to the slaughter
You can only do so much
On your knees
With your eyes sewn shut
Stand up and take a true look
A true look at the hell
That we've all created

All Created

Unlearn

This has gone on
For too long
We've let our senses be numbed
Only fucking one way
To Reverse
Your Creation
It must be unwritten
