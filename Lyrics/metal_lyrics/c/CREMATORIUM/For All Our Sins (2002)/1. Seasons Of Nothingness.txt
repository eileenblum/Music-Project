Falling with fire from the sky
Overly injured and burnt up dry
Dreams are stuck and shining through
Can't you see that it's destroying you

One in itself
And this new disease
One in itself
And it's shining seas
One in itself
And it's line of thought
One in itself
And it's loss of light

I take this life
This is no ones else
This is the life
That you give unto your
Self

Look in self
The times you know
Flies up
And find themselves alone
Rise above
Before I know
What's censored
And find myself alone
I shalll stand before myself
In the greatest lie
I shall stand alone with myself
This is what I despise

No
You shall know
Lies
Forever grow
Outside this life
There is no one else
This is the light that you
Bury unto yourself

This
Is
Not
My
Life
