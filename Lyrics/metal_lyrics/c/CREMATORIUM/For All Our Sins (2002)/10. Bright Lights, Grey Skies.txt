I see this life as we stare at the sun
This is your life the damage be done
Taking losses inside the damage is real
This is yourself inside nothings concealed
I set this life like staring at the lies
What they says that in size has decayed inside
Will I suffer alone and bury this life
What has decayed inside shall bury your lies

I set this life that you know that's disease
Rise up the anger inside
Bright lights; Grey Skies

Let's see the life that's you know that's inside
Let's set this anger inside
Bright Lights; Grey Skies

Never trust reality to know what you see
This is life inside you better believe
What you take from this life will bury your soul
What is left will make you loose all control

I set this life as I stare at the sun
Once this decay is known better be done
Once you become these lies bury the truth
Nothingness left inside stabbing through

Lets set this life that you know that's disease
Rise up this anger inside
Bright Lights; Grey Skies
