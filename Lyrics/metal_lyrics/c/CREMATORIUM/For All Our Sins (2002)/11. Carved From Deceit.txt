Maybe in another time and space
This would have meant so much more
Taken my time and what my reactions left
Everything was thrown to the floor
There are no more moments
Under the old oak trees
This is not all the time we have
Nothing is left inside of me

Maybe we should spend some time alone
Maybe we should spend some time apart
Maybe we should spend some time with ourselves
Before it falls apart
And everything shall turn to dust
And the earth shall burn in flames
Maybe we should spend some time to ourselves
Before we blow it all away

Maybe in another time and space
This would have meant so much more
Taken my time and what my reactions left
Everything is thrown on the floor
There are no more moments
Under the old oak trees
Take some time with what life is left
And nothing is left inside of me

Maybe we should spend some time alone
Maybe we should spend some time apart
Maybe we should spend some time with ourselves
Before it falls apart
And everything shall turn to dust
And the earth shall turn in flames
Maybe we should take some time to ourselves
Before we blow it all away

I will never heal from this

Loss
I see this hatred
Right before thier lies
What's that
I see this life that
Comes

I perceive the lies of their Jesus Christ
Once inside this system you decide to loose your life
Once inside this system you become what corrodes
This is the time when deceiving myself becomes old

Maybe in another time and space
This would have meant so much more
Taken my time and what my reactions left
Everything falls to the floor
So goodbye to what life is left
Under the old oak trees of time
