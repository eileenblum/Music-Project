Can't you
See how this is ruining your life
Living out time
Being so blind

Dare to break the fucking design
You stupid motherfucker
How do you stay in line
When you're gonna die
This is the time to defy
You stupid motherfucker
How do you step outside
Your gonna fucking die

You're spending to much time
At war with yourself
You're spending too much time
Now it's all gone

I know the ways that are inside
You stupid fucking punk
This is the way to outshine
I know the fucking design
You stupid motherfuck
I killed the fucking design
I know the time has come again
This is the time to rise again
This is the truth in human design
Why do these bastards choose to fucking get in line

You're spending to much time
At war with yourself
You're spending too much time
Now it's all gone

I know the ways that inside
As you turn your fucking backs
Watch them one at a time
I know the ways inside myself
This is what's part of my new design
I see the time has come again
Casting your stones
I chose my life to live against the system
I tend to stand alone

All alone

Cast your stone

This is your way to break ties before your broken soul
This is the process I despise
all of this gets so old
you're spending too much time

You're spending to much time
At war with yourself
You're spending too much time
Now it's all gone
