I defile your fucking skies
What was sent has said that the war is dry
Beelzebub this is your lucifer
The modern day plague bearer

Cities rise
As I seethe below
Rise in sut
As the city grows
Beelzebub
This is your lucifer
The modern day plague bearer

Serotonin

Wash yourself down
Before I loose myself again
Rising down before blood
This is the war again
War against race inside yourself
Launch itself
Against the cityship

No one will survive

I deceive against your fucking scheme
I decide to bury your dreams
Beelzebub I am your lucifer
The modern day plague bearer

What is considered yourself
Serotonin
What you're standing against
Melatonin
Writing itself into your scheme
Rotting itself into your dreams

Writhes itself
As I disown you
Just justice
As I disown you
Rise above
Before your lucifer
The modern day plague bearer
