I see man is plagued with a moral disease of life
Can't you see that your blind inside
Fortunate to give your life
I seek life within a buried soul
Drying the blood of your soul
Broken down and loosing all control

Like child
This word is born again
Into a rusted sea of salt and spoils
A broken dream laid to rest in crude blood
Like broken arms of the clocks of existence
Pointing us beyond a southern cross
Past the times of preconcieved nurturings
Give yourself unto yourself
You are the god of your own individual plane
Of existence

I see man is plagued with morals loosing life
Can't you see that your blind inside
Limit youself and making yourself so blind
This is what you call loosing all control
The dyes of seperated self ties me to loose my soul

You are the god
And all that matters in your world
A world of bones brittled and battered
Smashed into a powder that clouds this vision
A vision of a perfect world
And that one place
The place in which we shall call home
The home at rest with the collection of thought
A place to rest with no memory
Blackened and peacefully cold with ones self

We live
To Die
With no answers
The truth must go on
So we
Can see
The lies hidden behind the words

In our lives you know there's so much pain
So why do you live at all
Some sort of sadistic
In this life you know there's so much hell
So why do we live at all
Some sort of sadistic
Game

We live
To die
With the truth
This lifes answers must go on
So we
Can see
Lies hidden behind the words
This life shall pay
Like the broken clocks hand
Of dawn
So we
Can see
