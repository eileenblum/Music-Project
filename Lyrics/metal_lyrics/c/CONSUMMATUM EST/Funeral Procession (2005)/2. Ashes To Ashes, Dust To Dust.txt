Winter comes slowly
And like a sweet poison
Inebriates the senses
And freezes the heart
It's like a nourishment
For flowers made of dust
Grown in the hope
Whitered in the oblivion

Forgotten fields
Where flowers are stillborn
Immutable skies
Where stars don't shine
Here is my home
An abandoned place
Where I can rest
For an eternity and more...

Please let me drown in this womb
Where life turns to ash
Please let that the dust entomb me
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust"
