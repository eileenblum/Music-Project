Listen to this sound, so soft, like a caress"
This sweet melody is like a kiss in my forehead"
I think that this night will be long, neverending"
But I have no fear, we are protected here"

Sweetly, slowly, soft snow is falling
Covers our grave, brush the tombstone"
But here we are protected,
Under some metres of dump soil"
Our flesh will be gnaw by the worms
Embraced for the eternity we will stay
Lulled by the silence of the grave
Lulled by" our sobs"

Sleep, sleep my dear lover, the night is still long"
Sleep, sleep my dear lover, the night is so long and cold"
This night is neverending and keep us safe
This night is neverending and keep us safe"
