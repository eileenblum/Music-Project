The crowd slowly passed
Moans everywhere
Confused whispers
Formed a prey

Heavy grey clouds
Came with the mourn
Tears from the sky
Kissed the coffin

Like a choir of shadows
Rise our prey of death
In these moments we don't know
Who is the dead, who is the living"
In our heart go by a black veil
And in these moments we are the dead"
In these moments
Is also our funeral"

This is the funeral procession
And we are all dead"
This is the funeral procession
And we have never lived"
This is our funeral procession
