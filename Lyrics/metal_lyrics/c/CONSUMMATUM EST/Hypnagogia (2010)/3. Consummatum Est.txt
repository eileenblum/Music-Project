I've seen the fall of man
One last breath before the silence
Death rattle in the darkness
One last tear before the rain

I've seen children of war
Melting under the sun of shame
Consummatum est!
The sky cries it's fallen ones
Angels that loose their wings
Consummatum est!

We must kneel down
In front of the end
We must admit that
We have always mistaken
