Scarlet moon, eye of a dead angel
Whose glance have gotten lost in the divine sperm
Ashes cover your cold naked body
Where hungry dummies come to feast

In orgy of dolls and ravens parades over the sea
All is phosphoric and full of flies
The stench of dead flesh was too strong
Can you count all the teeth and tongues on the ground?

Scarlet moon, eye of a dead angel
Whose glance dies among the waves of our lust
Embrace me and eat my right eye
The miracle is completed, cut me half
