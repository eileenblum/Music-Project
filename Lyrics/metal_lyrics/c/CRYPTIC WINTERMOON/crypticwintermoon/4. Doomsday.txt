A journey to infinity
Lucifer, he waits for me
The loss of human kindness
Is the only way to survive
The war between good and evil
The war between darkness and light
Is settled on that stony ground
Is settled except the last fight

The dizziness trough that desert
Of madness and pain
Demands a decision
Demands to break my chain

A long way left behind me
All memories are gone
On this world I'm a stranger
What have I done?

I can't see good or evil
But I see torment in their eyes
I spit on this decision
A decision between lies

Lonely in this twilight world - I will find the right way
I left my soul behind - in the beauty of day
I left my soul behind - in the beauty of day

A journey to infinity
Lucifer, he waits for me
The loss of human kindness
Is the only way to survive
The war between good and evil
The war between darkness and light
Is settled on that stony ground
Is settled except the last fight

A long way left behind me
All memories are gone
On this world I'm a stranger
What have I done

I can't see good or evil
But I see torment in their eyes
I spit on this decision
A decision between lies

Lonely in this twilight world - I will find the right way
I left my soul behind - in the beauty of day
I left my soul behind - in the beauty of day
