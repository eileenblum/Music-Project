Do you feel that the night comes
The sun is going down
The nightmare is beginning
Your fear now has grown
In the eyes of the night
You will see your own fall
See the darkness of night
And the darkness in your soul

You'll see blood on your hands
You'll see death in your mind
Pain and desperation
In the next victim you will find
Remember your visions
The pain in your own
No one can help you
You are alone

Dark visions in the night
Eternal yearning for light
Don't ask me why
Tonight you gonna die

Dark Visions in the night
Eternal yearning for light
Don't ask me why
Tonight you gonna die
Tonight you gonna die

Do you feel that the night comes
The sun is going down
The nightmare is beginning
Your fear now has grown
In the eyes of the night
You will see your own fall
See the darkness of night
And the darkness in your soul

"Demons in my mind - they show the way
I cannot find. - The light of day
Is what I fear. - Now I will cry
My final tear before I die"

I prepare for my grave
Now I must pay the bill
I'm just a toy
I don't want to kill
I will will follow visions
Now I hear my death bell
The nightmare is over
I will go to hell

Visions of eternal darkness
Visions of eternal darkness

I prepare for my grave
Now I must pay the bill
I'm just a toy
I don't want to kill
I will follow my visions
Now I hear my death bell
The nightmare is over
I will go to hell
I will go to hell
I will go to hell

Dark visions in the night
Eternal yearning for light
Don't ask me why
Tonight you gonna die

Dark visions in the night
Eternal yearning for light
Don't ask me why
Tonight you gonna die
Tonight you gonna die
Tonight you gonna die
