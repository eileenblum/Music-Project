Night is finally closing in, but I have no fear
In the hour when the night falls
Voices from the dark side are calling my name
Slowly fading to the world where I belong
Ebony rising, I close my eyes
Flashing pictures of an old remembrance passing by
On obsidian wings I fly, leave the gates behind
Through the colonnades of eternity
This is the end for me, I'm dying

[chorus]
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
On black wings I fly, as I cross the dark sky
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
When daylight dies, eternally

As whispers surround me, see people I have known
Remember times I had forgotten long ago
Dark arms embrace my soul, emptiness fills my mind
As the pulse of life is slowly fading
Now a storm is rising 
Then he appears 
Cloaked in a robe of black
Waiting to guide my soul from here
Across the stream of life, to a kingdom beyond, back to the place of birth,
So this the end for me, I'm dying

[chorus]
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
On black wings I fly, as I cross the dark sky
So I close my eyes, and I can see the shadows rise
When daylight dies, eternally  

A world of silence, waits for me, the end in darkness, is my destiny
As my life passes, before my eyes, from my birth, to the time I die
From my cradle, to my grave, a little time, until the death embrace.
Now my memories fade away, the past forgotten, a new life waits for me.
Will I reincarnate, will I die forever, when I meet my fate, at the break of dawn.
Soon I will now, if there is endless darkness, or there is blazing light.
When daylight turns to night.

Eternal Silence
As my memories Fade to black
Rising darkness
And there is no turning back
