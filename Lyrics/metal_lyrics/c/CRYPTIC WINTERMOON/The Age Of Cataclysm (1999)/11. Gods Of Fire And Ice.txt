A caress of moonlight (a touch of stars)
It keeps me strong is this curse of life
The sunlight burns in my eyes (escape the day)
Saved by embracing darkness
Deep in the night (beyond your fears)
The gate away from all the tortures
to the kingdom of glory

The throne is burning in fire, The throne is frozen in ice
Might is their desire; Life is my sacrifice
The mirror is broken, I leave the tortures of life
Swearing allegiance; Till the end of all days

Gods of..... Gods of fire
Gods of..... Gods of ice [2x]

To the Gods of fire and ice I will pray
The baptism of blood will now be done
Appeasing their anger with the blood from my wrist
Begging for their mercy, from death I'll be kissed

Ascending the altar, the last step for my flesh
Oppressive silence surrounds me on this holy place
Now I am feeling the cold wrath of darkness
Forcing me to breathe the odour of putrefaction

Blazing in moonlight
The knife cuts slowly through my veins
I fill the chalice with blood-red wine
This, my life will soon be thine

Burn my body - ashes to the past
Leave your soul behind - what was once will ever last
Gods of fire, gods of ice
Cheerfull we awaited you - together we will rise

The throne is burning in fire, The throne is frozen in ice
Might is their desire; Life is my sacrifice
The mirror is broken, I leave the tortures of life
Swearing allegiance; Till the end of all days [2x]

Gods of..... Gods of fire
Gods of..... Gods of ice
Gods of fire and ice
