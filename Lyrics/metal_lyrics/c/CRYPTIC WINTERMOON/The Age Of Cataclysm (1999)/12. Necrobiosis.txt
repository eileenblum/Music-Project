The rising terror
Strikes fear into heart of man
A nameless horror
Never to be seen again
Curses my dreams
Controlling my motion, controlling my mind
The blackened whispers
Sleepwalking to insanity

And when the cold wind blows, there will be no regret
Never to be unleashed, the breed of the living dead

The growing bloodthirst
The endless hunger for living flesh
Now eating corpses
You will be a hunter until your death
Leaving them wounded
They soon will be one of you
You are cursed
Necrobiosis

I can hear them crwaling, and I can hear them creeping
And there is no place, no place to hide for me
I can hear their cries, can hear them crying in pain
And I can feel my hunger, the hunger for human flesh

Tasting the blood, feeling the necrobiosis
The soul is dying, but the body lives on
A darkside creatures is your destiny
A lifeless zombies, is what you are going to be
