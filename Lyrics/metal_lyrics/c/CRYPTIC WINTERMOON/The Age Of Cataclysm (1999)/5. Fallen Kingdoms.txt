Wicked winds - blowing hard
Riding straight - into the dark
Ebony mist - rises high
Ravenwings - I can fly
A fearless heart - will survive
A soul of pain - will never die
A sword of grim - a hate so old
And I will strike - Just as foretold
(Just as foretold)

A mighty burst blasts the gates of the dimensions
Flying right into the heart of the chaos engine
Strange things I see, strange things I hear
Nowhere to hide, nothing to fear
The deeper down - as I go
Into the place - you'll never know
To face the enemy - eye to eye
A mighty battle - one shall die

Not me !!!
Into eternity

The deeper down - as I go
Into the place - you'll never know
To face the enemy - eye to eye
A mighty battle - one shall die

WAR!!!!

Fighting hard, as armies fall
Batteling gods in marble halls
I am wounded down on my knees
They can't kill nature, cause nature is me

Noone believes in you - so will die forever
Noone will pray to you - you will be dead forever more.

The deeper down as I went
The more I knew what it meant
Eternal wind take me away
No more reason for me to stay
The gods are slayn, the battle won
The nature free, revenge is done

So I am dying - but you will die forever
Noone will know you - but nature will be foever. [2x]
