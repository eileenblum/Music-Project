Sunlight ... is fading ... the season ... of blood will now begin

Burning coffins, eyes of fire, the dark lords wander through the night
eternal damnation, thirst for blood, and now they will embrace the dead
essential liquid for immortality, but the condition is to kill
the whole existance, remains in darkness, never see the light of day

There I see you, nameless one, a woman raped by evil
Come to my Kingdom, victim of lust, and now welcome the darkside
I cry in pain, of my desire, but now you're here to heal me
I'll drink your blood, and I relief you, then you will love the darkness

[Ref.]
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no sin
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no Sin

"Hidden lusts will break the gates to light
the night secrets my desire for blood"

Burning coffins, eyes of fire, the dark lords wander through the night
eternal damnation, thirst for blood, and now they will embrace the dead
essential liquid for immortality, but the condition is to kill
the whole existance, remains in darkness, never see the light of day

[Ref.]
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no sin
Sunlight is fading the season will begin
Black Moon is rising to survive is no sin
