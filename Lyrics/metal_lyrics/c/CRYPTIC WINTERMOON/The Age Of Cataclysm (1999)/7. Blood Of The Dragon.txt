In the times of the warriors, swords, blood and honour
When tales of wizards and black magic became reality
When the period of never ending cruelty, the rulers just accept
But the creatures of the night retired to the outlands

Where love was known as a beautiful vision but hate and revenge
Were the first laws in every man's live
The time has come for some respectable warriors to lay down the sword
And to turn away from battles and death

He thought about the children and hoped they'll never see
The cruelty of the battles where thousands had to die
His sword lies down in honour and it didn't want to kill again
But the periods of peace sometimes fly away like the stormwind

The calm will not go on
The sword lies restless
The calm will not go on
The sword lies restless

The battle........is won...........but the dark age will return
Thousands......had to die......but it lives on and on
At that time they went together, afraid of nothing
They thought to be invincible, but they're not immortal
Blood was flowing like a river but they could be victorious
The battle is won, but the dark age will return

"Listen warrior...... in the past you have been victorious,
but the decisive battle is still before you.
The dark lord is now mightier than before,
and he will return with his armies of immortals to devour all live.
I will tell you what you have to do:
Do you remember............................"

"Well, there is no more time to loose
the sword has resteed long enough
let us put an army together
as big as the biggest mountain
as strong as the strongest giant
as mighty as the mightiest storm
and let us beat them with the blood of a dragon on our blades
the the dark lord will yield the armies of the light.
We have to go now, to our fate
But this victory will last eternally."

[Chor:]
(...for the blood of the dragon will flow)
United we'll stand, with swords in our hands
To bring glorious days over our enchanted land.
Let us do the confession, we need the agression
To beat the dark armies and defend our land.
We must fight with the fire of dragon's desire
His blood is our ally, the essence of life.

At that time they went together, afraid of nothing
They thought to be invincible, but they're not immortal
Blood was flowing like a river but they could be victorious
The battle is won, but the dark age will return

In the times of the warriors, swords, blood and honour
When tales of wizards and black magic became reality
When the period of never ending cruelty the rulers just accept
and the creatures of the night returned from the outlands

The calm will not go on
The sword lies restless
The calm will not go on
The sword lies restless
