He rises from the ashes - he rises from the dead
A wolf-hearted children - just as the legend said
Through the murky forests - across the silver seas
To a place of silence - where I love to be
Wandering through the landscapes -
Where a thousand rivers flow
Over highest mountains - need a thousand years to grow
Into caves beneath the hills - for noones eyes to see
Through deserts bare of life - but there is no escape for me

Paradise - is what you?ll never see
Endless torture - for my enemies

The journey to the realms of gods -
below the mighty halls of stone
His battle against the enemies -
He must fight alone
Deadly lightning bolts flaming in fading light of day
Icy winter storms guide a long and deadly way

Paradise - is what you?ll never see
Endless torture - for my enemies

Darkness - stormclouds cover the land
Until the blood of the gods is the blood on my hands
Ashes - into ashes you will turn
Hellfire - in the flames of hell you will burn [3x]

He rises from the ashes - he rises from the dead
A wolf-hearted children - just as the legend said
Through the murky forests - across the silver seas
To a place of silence - where I love to be
Wandering through the landscapes - where a thousand rivers flow
Over highest mountains - need a thousand years to grow
Into caves beneath the hills - for noones eyes to see
Through deserts bare of life - but there is no escape for me

Paradise - is what you?ll never see
Endless torture - for my enemies
