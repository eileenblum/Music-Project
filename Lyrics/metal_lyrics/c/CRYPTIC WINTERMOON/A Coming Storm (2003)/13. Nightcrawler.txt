HOWLING WINDS ARE SCREAMING ROUND
AND THE RAIN COMES POURING DOWN
DOORS ARE LOCKED AND BOLTED DOWN
AS THE THING CRAWLS IN YOUR TOWN

STRAIGHT OUT OF HELL ONE OF A KIND
STALKING HIS VICTIMS DON'T LOOK BEHIND YOU

NIGHTCRAWLER BEWARE THE BEAST IN BLACK
NIGHTCRAWLER YOU KNOW IT`S COMING BACK

SANCTUARY IS BEING SOUGHT
WHISPERED PRAYERS A LAST RESORT
HOMING IN IT`S CRY DISTORT
TERROR STRUCK THEY KNOW TEY`RE CAUGHT

AS NIGHT IS FALLING THE END IS DRAWING NEAR
THEY`LL HEAR THE LAST RITES ECHO ON THE WIND

HUDDLED IN THE CELLAR FEAR CAUGHT IN THEIR EYES
DARING NOT TO MOVE OR BREATH AS THE CREATURE CRIES
FINGERNAILS START SCRATCHING ON THE OUTSIDE WALLS
CLAWING AT THE WINDOWS "COME TO ME" IT CALLES
ATHMOSPHERE`S ELECTRIC AND IT NOW DESCENDS THE STAIRS
HIDING IN THE DARKNESS IS SO FUTILE TO IT`S GLARE
DEATH COMES IN AN INSTANT AS THEY HOPED IT WOULD
SOULS ASCEND TO HEAVEN WHILE IT FEASTS OF FLESH AND BLOOD

NIGHTCRAWLER BEWARE THE BEAST IN BLACK
NIGHTCRAWLER YOU KNOW IT`S COMING BACK
NIGHTCRAWLER IT`S GONNA GET YOU
