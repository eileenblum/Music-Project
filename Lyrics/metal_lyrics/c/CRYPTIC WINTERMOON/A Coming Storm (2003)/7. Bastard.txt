GLORYFIED - GORIFIED - IDOLIZED BREED
DURFING ON ADRENALINE - I FEED - I FEED - I FEED
SMELL MY ODOUR -  FEAR IF PERFUME - BOOTLICKERS CHOICE
IF SORROW MEANS A JOKE FOR YOU - I MAKE YOU LAUGH

I AM YOOUR PAIN AMPLIFIER
IN THE DARK OF NIGHT - I RUSH INTO YOUR SOUL
FUCK YOU - SHITFACED CREATION
I WILL AMPLIFY YOUR NEEDS

DIE BASTARD - DIE BY MY HANDS
DIE BASTARD - ROT IN HELL

PARALIZED - STERILIZED - FOOLS TO THE CORE
A PUPPETSHOW WITHOUT PUPPETEERS
ADVERTISED -  BRAINWASHED MINDS -  STAMPEDE OF SANITY
DOES ANYBODY NEED A GOD - I`LL MAKE SOME MORE

I AM YOUR GOD`S CRUCIFIER
SO WELCOME ME - JUST LIKE A STAR
WAKE UP -  THE TRAIN HAS GONE TOO FAR
YOU WILL DEIFY MY DEEDS
WHO NEEDS PROFESSIONALS
WHEN STILL FOOLS EXIST
KEEPING UP THE IDOLS
THAT MADE YOU SO PISSED
LAUGHING - WHEN I HIT YOUR FACE AGAIN
REAL ENTERTAINMENT - THIS IS NO FUN
BASTARD - I WISH YOU HELL
RIDING ON THE WINGS OF WRATH - WRATH

LOWER INSTINCTS DOMINATE -  TO GAIN VICTORY
NOTHING BUT A CHAPTER -  IN SOME LITANY
TOUCHED BY A SHADE OF THRUTH
