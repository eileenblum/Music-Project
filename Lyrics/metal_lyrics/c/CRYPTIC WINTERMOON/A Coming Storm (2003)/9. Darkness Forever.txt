CLAWS OF FEAR TOUCH YOUR HEART IN THE DARKNESS
THOUGHTS OF SOULBURNING HORROR RIP YOUR MIND
FEEL HIS PRESENCE BLEED YOUR SOUL -  STEEL YOUR LIFE
ENDLESS BLACK - EVEN DARKNESS STEPS ASIDE

HEAR THE CALL OF THE GOD - YOU DIE
ONCE A GOD FELL FROM GRACE INTO OBLIVION
ENTOMBED IN DARKNESS - ENDLESS VANISHING
BANISHED BY GODS FROM LIGHT - DESCENT TO TWILIGHT
BUT ONE DAY FROM THE ASHES HE WILL RISE

I AM THE EVIL WITHIN YOU AND YOU WILL NEVER REACH ETERNITY
DARKNESS FOREVER
MAY THE GATES BURST OPEN - MAY ALL HELL BREACK LOOSE
WHEN THE SHADOWGOD ARRIVES
ARMIES FORGED OF STEEL AND SULPHUR
ON THE BACK OF NIGHTMARES THEY WILL RIDE

THERE WONT BE A QUICH SALVATION -  I WILL MAKE YOU BLEED FOREVER
I`LL ENTWINE YOUR WORLD WITH FIRE - FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
AND THOUSAND PLAGUES WILL RIP THE LAND - HUNGER THEN WILL RAGE AND WAR
BUT YOU WILL SUFFER ENDLESSLY - FOR AGES AND EVEN MORE
YOU WOULD OFFER EVEREYTHING JUST TO DIE - BUT THERE WIL BE NO REMORSE
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG A HUMAN CAN SUFFER - ETERNALLY AND EVEN MORE
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AND MORE - FOREVER

COME WITH ME I`LL LEAD YOUR HEART TO DARKNESS
BE MY FRIEND OR MY ENEMY
VICTORY TO THE SULPHUR LEGIONS
DEATH TO THE ARMY OF THE FREE
I WILL GRIND MY ENEMY INTO THE GROUND
THE DWELL OF LIFE WILL BE DRY FOREVER
LIFELESS BODIES LAY ALL AROUND
AND MY REIGN WILL LAST FOREVER
