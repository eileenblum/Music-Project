Standing alone down by the riverside
A coin of gold don't loose it hold on tight
Pain and suffering forever left behind
Beyond the stream a better world you'll find
You feel that death is taking ground
Your thread to life unbound

A sea of shining lights the ships come to port
A coin of shining gold pay and step on board
A gasp of wind then the ships leave the shore
Heading for the storm returning nevermore

As you sail through winds and stormy weather
You know that nothing lasts forever
Now listen...
One of your sons is coming home
Open up the door don't let him stand out in the darkness all alone
He has walked a long and stony road
Cross the streams of life where the winds of eternity blow
Now coming home...

The storm is easing up the clouds step aside
Out of the darkness a ray of shining light
You reached the promised land at the end of your way
And if it's the will of fate we will meet again some day

As you sail through winds and stormy weather
You know that nothing lasts forever

In darkest nights all alone
The candles flame will guide you home
Nothing to hear nothing to see
But you are watching over me
I hope you are there to see us smile
I hope you are there to see us cry
And when words fail to describe
This is my way to say goodbye
