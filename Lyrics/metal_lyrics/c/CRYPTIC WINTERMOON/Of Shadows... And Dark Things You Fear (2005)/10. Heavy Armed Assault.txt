Armies from the gates of hell â creatures breathing ash
Massive rocket impact â as the armies clash
Confronting heavy armed assault â fully armored black
Clashing at our boundaries â there is no turning back

Burning skies â as fire begins to rain
Drowning the world in endless pain â as death comes closing in

Bullet impats cracking bones â seeking for your head
Our defense pounded to the ground â leaving them all dead
Wave by wave comes storming in â there is no end to see
Ankle deep in pools of blood â dead bodies lying next to me

Burning skies â as fire begins to rain
Drowning the world in endless pain â as death comes closing in

In the light of the dying sun â your world falls to peaces
In grinding artillery fire â as pain and damage increases

Bomb explosions â knocking gently on your door
Hear roaring cannon fire â that's the drums of war
That's our art of war

You can run â but never hide
Here death will always find you
Kill efficiency â industrialized
Genocide â mechanized

Firewalls â cremating human flesh
Wardemons â grinding them to death
