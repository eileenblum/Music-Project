Atmospheric electric â the hurricane is near
We carry on our soil â to get you all my dear
Heading straight on forward â but never out of sight
An egotrip rebellion â heavy armed delight

Hallowed or just hollow â imprisoned be the will
Maximize the coin machine â mass media overkill
Generation zero â sing for the deaf
Ubiquitous mindlock â always looking for the thrill

Feeding oil to the flames â the quest has just begun
Faster, harder, more and more â implicit faith will make you stun
Our trademark, Mr,Misbehaviour â we don't care whats right or wrong
Lack of common sense â now sanity is gone
Sanity is gone â sowing the wind to harvest the storm
Without any regrets â without any respect
More firepower â on all fronts

We take on everyone â we reconcile with everyone
Sowing the wind to harvest the storm â more firepower on all fronts
Manmade mirage â turning the words
Pull down the trigger â without any regrets

It's feeding time for the beasts of prey
Serving them their favourite meal
Reload your weapon systems â onwards without signs of fatigue
In need of mental values â we're here to gain control
Heading straight on forwards â we erase your thoughts
With methods oh so dirty â when all sex is sold
When all the sex is sold

Feeding oil to the flames â the quest is on the run
Without any regrets â without any respect â this what we have to do
Come on, follow us â we know we are right â without any regrets â we entertain tonight

We entertain tonight
