Burning sign â in the sky â storms rise â on the northern side
Thunder roars â lightning strikes â man the ships â to war we ride

Demons from a place unknown â where evil dwells and dark things grow
By the grace of firegods â assault our land if ice and snow

Written in the prophecy ages ago â the war between fire and snow
Demons unleashed from the darklands core â this time it's war

My heart for the lands of winter
And my sword strikes for the light
For my god I will die
And my fate is the shield of mine
Born in the land of north and here I will die

Sail across the seven seas â that is your destiny
Where great evil reigns â and the oceans meet eternity
The fortress of shadows â in the frozen wasteland
The core of darkness â mankind's fate of is at hand

Of mother of north â hold safety your sons
Oh father of storms â bring us north from here
Hold darkness from us â not death only failure we fear

Sail across the seven seas â that is your destiny
Where great evil reigns â and the oceans meet eternity
The fortress of shadows â in the frozen wasteland
The core of darkness â mankind's fate of is at hand
Sail across the seven seas â through the seven gates of hell
To the forbidden place â where great evil dwells

Moving shades of black â shining eyes of fire
Death hiding in the darkness â and it seems that all our gods have left
Approaching the realm of fire â fighting side by side
Fighting day and night â we will win or we all will die
