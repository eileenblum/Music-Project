In between the wastelands of endless ice and snow
Lays the place abandoned from mankind long ago
Frozen seas of blood â towers built of flesh and bones
And the presence on insanity on the shadows throne
Great evil is dwelling here for ages â high in the lands of frost
Stories turn to legends â and empires fall to dust â the awaking of the ancient is at hand
Spreading the reign of shadows terror â high up in the abandoned land
Moving shadows at the edge of the wood â where twilight found you out there all alone
In the darkness and the freezing cold â and far far away from home
Ages went by in a storm of years â in the wind blasted north
For a time there were rumors to hear â of shadows and the dark things you fear
And beneath a great mountain hidden in darkness a shadow writhed in chains
Eaten by hate to the edge of madness moving figures â playing his games
All figures set â for the final strike leaving me alone against a hundred â this night

So I grab weapon and shield â ready to face my fate â a quick prayer comes over my lips
To those gods up there who left me up there where my brothers a wait
Courage was what my gods honoured â one against hundred
And with all hope lost I engaged into battle
But suddenly wind was rising and turned into a storm â a blizzard of ice and deadly cold
It did me no harm but smashed my enemy and slayed then one by one
And amidst the blizzard I could see moving shadows of my father
And all my brothers I have lost in battle
So my prayers have been heard in this darkest hour my northern gods have returned to me...

Deadly blizzards â beasts of ice â in northern lands â where northmen rise
Blessed by cold â the winteborn â to give your life for your god you've sworn
Your heart for the lands of winter â and your sword strikes for the light
For your god I will die
And my fate is the shield of mine â born in the land of north and here I will die
Ages went by in a storm of years â in the wind blasted north
For a time there was a legend to hear â of a man who fought shadows and the dark things you fear
Once... in the windblasted north...
In between the wastelands of endless ice and snow
Lays the place abandoned from mankind long ago
Great evil is dwelling here for ages â high in the lands of frost
Now stories turn to legends â and empires fall to dust
Once... in the windblasted north...
