And so we meet here again, old friend â welcome back to your journey's end
Here at the keep of all darkest nights â where the source of your sorrow lies

All your nightmares â only worse â have become bitter truth for your infected mind
And nothing could save you from torture and grind â slowly fading â from your world
No more spring will thaw your frozen heart anymore â forever, forever, not anymore

Uncertain stumbling through the haze â thousand eyes staring at your face
A savage unintortured chase â don't expect any help from grace
How that the gleam of your eyes went out â your frightened glance betrays rising doubt
About what soon is to come for you â bad fate, you can rely onto

Guardians of nightfall, lead me behind â the borders I'm loosing for the peace to find
Never meant to be a sinner in religious ways â "why the hell no one hears my prayers"
Portals of nightfall, open your front â and grand me entrance to the world beyond
But please don't forsake my death â yearning soul -...I hear the demons of embers call

Unbearable the burden gradual becomes â drags me down the maw, and deeper down below
My corpse aglowed a long time ago yet â while passing through the chambers of the dead
There are no words to define all this dismay â nothing you have known is destined to remain
When I made you inhale my toxic breath â for I am the everlasting death

Portals of nightfall, open your front â and grand me entrance to the world beyond
But please don't forsake my death â yearning soul -...I hear the demons of embers call

Just take a look around you my son â and be aware of the shades to come
Then you forget what the bible taught â consolation in rain be sought
So this will be your true fate, old friend â welcome back to your journey's end
Here all the keep of all darkest nights â where the source of your sorrow lies

All your nightmares â only worse â have become bitter truth for your infected mind
And nothing could save you from torture and grind â slowly fading â from your world
No more spring will thaw your frozen heart anymore â forever, forever, not anymore
