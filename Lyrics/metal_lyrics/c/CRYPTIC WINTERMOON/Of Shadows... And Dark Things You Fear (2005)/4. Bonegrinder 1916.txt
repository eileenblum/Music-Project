The smell of poison gas â fills the air
No need to search for death â he will find you there

Soil drained with blood â cities pulverized
Dead bodies twisted â humans carbonized
Bonegrinder â grinding bones â eating them alive
Spitting them out dead â no one will survive

War is the only answer
My gun spreads bullets like cancer

Bombs like rain â day and night â moving out â suicide
Death angels â from the sky â descent from hell â thousands die
Machinegun fire â detonations â rifle rounds â devastation
Grinding bones â artillery shell â draining blood â here is hell

Fire, roaring thunder â will be my coming signs
Planting death and havoc â among the defense lines

Thousand bodies â lay ripped and torn
The sound of cannon fire â roars like thunderstorm

Soil drained with blood â cities pulverized
Dead bodies twisted â humans carbonized
Bonegrinder â grinding bones â eating them alive
Spitting them out dead â no one will survive

War is the only answer
My gun spreads bullets like cancer
