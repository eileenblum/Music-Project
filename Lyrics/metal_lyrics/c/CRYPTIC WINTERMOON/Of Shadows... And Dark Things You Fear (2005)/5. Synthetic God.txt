I am the Antichrist â I am divinity â I am the coming storm â I am the sun that keeps you warm
I am salvation â I am the greatest sin â I am your synthetic god â I am what dwells within

You can run and try to hide â but you will find no shelter
I am the new empire â built upon the ashes of the past
So lustful with eyes to see â human race a whore to me
Raise some glasses in the sky â and celebrate the effigy

Tell me what you deserve â say what you are longing for
Reveal your inmost dreams to me â playing roles in a real world pirace

I am hate
I am greed
I am the voracious
Breed

I am what you are â I am the masterwhore â I am what you want me to be

I make the cities turn to dust and worlds fading into grey
I am the blasting silence in a world full of rust
We live blinded and despised in a pleasure painted paradise
We are the hate we are the greed
We are the voracious breed

Call me punishment and pain I am the prison you are in
My embrace is never ending now be a servant to your pride
Stigmata of this enslavement a world filled with scapegoats
Still trying to reanimate a little bit of self respect
I am the Antichrist â I am divinity â I am the coming storm â I am the sun that keeps you warm
I am salvation â I am the greatest sin â I am your synthetic god â I am what dwells within

Am I what you are â am I what you want me to be
Are you what I am â do you laugh at my command

Are you what you are â I am salvation â I am the real you
Am I salvation for you too
