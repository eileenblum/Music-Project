Addicted to protoplasmic matter
I avail myself do that wide abundance

For I am the creator â they call me god
This naive rattle I just cultivated to quench my thirst
In my laboratory lovely named "earth" â your incubator â you grow and wilt
Scrutinized and analyzed
And when my work is done I simple pull the plug

I am theory â and practically don't exist
Syntax error â the unknown force of downfall
My name a synonym for terror â my blood the elexier of horror
I sustain all synthetic factors of physical composition

Archieving of all nocturnal phenomenons
The ultimate supervisor of statics â weaver of dimensions

Listen to that voice so mellow â close your eyes and fall asleep
But be on your guard not to go astray in the shades

Back to generation zero â thrashomatic overdrive
Enigmatic origin stain by hidden force
Extinguishing the flame of mortals â systematic termination
Monumental patron of the unhallowed hordes

I sustain all synthetic factors of nocturnal grace
