As crimson colours the sky â where ravens fly
Staring to the sky above â the incoming darkness
And lonely we die

No one who prays for us â no one who cries
We die â to the place where our dead brothers lie

And now the cold grips my heart
I can see them coming
A heart of ice â and the eyes like winter

Not afraid of the coming night â remember where darkness there is a light
A burning flame forever to remain
Just another grave in the cold without a name

Now darkness fills the sky â see the Valkyries fly
A last look to the sky above â we are warriors born to die
