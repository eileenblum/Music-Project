I come from nowhere I am nothingness
Beyond the eternal desert of night
Light of the moon a substitute for sun
Innocence born in horrors,
Metamorphosis has just begun

After utopia of life horny dreams await
Now from the chaos I rise
To the sky...

Blinded by light darkness calls so sweet
Travelling so far but still unmoved...
...Indeed

[lead: Bielewicz]

I'm still flying, my wings are burning
While angels' art is so near
Call me, hear me, sail with me through the universe
I am the wave that'll flood your hope forever... and more!

Vortex of desire calls to eternity
Come my children, come, reach the infinity!
Warm and glamour from the bottom of my soul
Thy presence makes the weak forgotten
Of pain and christian fever

Impossibility becomes the brightest night
Forbidden fantasies of the nameless
Open the entrance to another world
Undefined ones...
