Fruit of magic will blossom in your eyes
Stupidity will cast your minds to condemnation
Black warriors with torches in their hands
From ashes into fire will turn these lands

They don't look for bliss
And with pride go ahead
Emperors of chaos come...
Through the fireplain

They don't look for happiness
And with honour act their duty
Emperors of chaos come...
To the Fireland

Then will be bloody rain
Which will spread the fire
Like slaughter of innocents
You all will die!

For ruin of love
And damn of emotions
They steal your sun
For glory of disaster
And glory of hate
They turn the world into the fireland!
You'll be suffer forever
It's the land of fire
It's the land of infinite despair
Of souls and bodies of bigoted people

For ruin of love...
