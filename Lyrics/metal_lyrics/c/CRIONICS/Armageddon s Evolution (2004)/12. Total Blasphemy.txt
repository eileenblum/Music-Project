[Bonus track]

Day and night I walk alone
Looking for victims, the time has come
Need to kill the bastard son
I'm destroyer, unholy one!

Drinking and screaming
The life has new meaning tonight
You'll never betray me
'cause your life is black'n'roll
Come to me bow to me
You will worship me tonight

Come to me bow to me
You will always worship me

Not strong enough
Looking for peace and love
Are not worth of living this world
So take my hand and listed till comprehend
I'm saying these words of command:
Every day, every night
Stay against all is white
Darkness and black these two I admire
Worship devil, worship hellfire

Praise the beast, worship me
Never stop so you'll be free
Bang your head through all your life
Let the madness be your wife

Drinking and screaming
The life has new meaning tonight
Come to me bow to me
'cause your life is black'n'roll

Praise the beast, worship me
Kill yourself to make you free
Need to kill the bastard son
O'm destroyer, unholy one
