Welcome to kingdom of mine
In world of war against naturalism
Meet my ego-god
He and I hold power of three
In shadow of the horns
Lays weakness of mine
I follow the beast
Called nine

Od tooat nonucafe

Spit and put mud on your eyes!

At altar of future my past is bleeding
Balance of deeds and purity of soul
Interrogation at confessing latrine
Of world's machinations no more!

Introductory transmission
Of filthy truth for combination
Of your mind and flesh to serve yourself
