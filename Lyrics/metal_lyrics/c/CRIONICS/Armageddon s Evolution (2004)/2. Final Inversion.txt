How many are there which remain
In the glory of the earth which are
And shall not see death

Until stupidity doth fall
And their followers doth sink?

Burning incubators of stupidity
Razed to the ground
In my common dreams
Conviction of Christian byres to be forgotten
And corruptible servants of god deservedly cursed

Final inversion succeeded
When beast inside me born suddenly
The creature of darkness unleashed
Annihilation complete...

Come forth! appear! unto the terror
Of the earth and to our comfort
Niis! zamaran! ciaofi
Caosgo od bliors

Burning incubators of stupidity
Razed to the ground
In my common dreams
Conviction of Christian byres to be forgotten
And corruptible servants of god deservedly cursed
