Dweller of infinity
He, who died not two thousands years ago
Dwelling in infinity
It is in me when I travel
Through immensity of thousands

Not to kill what was given
To explore and find the key
To the peace of mind
Alienation is the clue
Of reflection

The sun is my enemy
Participation in void and freezing
Stars' cold purity
My strangulation is not because
Of perfect vacuum that surrounds me

Hydroflooding thoughts of megasin
Comes from beyond to grow up here
Infinite is supernal
Human is inhuman

What comes to us from beyond
That comes to us from within
What comes to them from beyond
Shadow realms of wisdom
Is a thorn in their flesh

Death to the blind, eternity to others
I'm obstinate and want to survive
In freezing fields of infinity
I walk alone and will die with stars
Rise above limits of human experience
And reach to other realms of existence

(I! I! I! me!)
Not to kill what was given
To explore and find the key
To the peace of mind
Alienation is the clue to become a god
