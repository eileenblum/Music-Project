Moving to the times of thousand years before Christ
We can imagine only in some measure
How important for the pagan tribes
Were five elements of the earth: 
Soil, wind, fire and water
And holy spirit reigning over everything

They were so important
' Cause pagan rituals depended on them
Old men with hooded heads, strong and wise
Came through the woods, drew sigils

They worshiped their gods: 
Fenriz, Midgard, Moloch
They threw the blasphemies 
On those who wanted to bury their culture
And those who wanted to do this
Had to fight with the descendents of the old man
