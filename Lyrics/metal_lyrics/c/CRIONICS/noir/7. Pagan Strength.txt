Defeated or not they come back in silence
And evil on their faces
Give the feeling of vengeance's desire
Centuries went by and there were many wars
Once they were triumphant and once not
The enemies has been expanding, gathered
And pagans have been losing many battles
After many years they were 
Attacked, oppresed and killed
They hid in the woods and caves
But after all they were murdered
Only the strong survived
Wrote tales that rouses fear and thrills
And their sanctuaries, stone circles and ruins
Prove that their power and beliefs will survive... 
Forever!
