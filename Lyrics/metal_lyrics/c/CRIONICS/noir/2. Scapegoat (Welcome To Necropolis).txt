Living at the edge of madness we dream our dreams
believing time has stopped to let us discover whether there's any sense
in challenging our destiny.

Would you dare to dance with the Death? What would the sacrifice be?
You are their scapegoat.
Metamorphosized into beast

beast you have to feed
unleashed, evolving into dark, dangerous thought
will raise its sword to rape and kill
Welcome to Necropolis

where all hope is gone...
life dwells in darkness...

where moan of all empty windows
takes your mind for painful trip
Across the ocean of forbidden words 
and all your memories you swim.

drop by drop they'll suck your blood.
this is immortality.
Look beyond the horizon
see the sun making love with the moon

and hear them singing for you.
This is perpetual rapture humanity had never given to you
So spread out your wings and fly up high
your prize is awaiting.

Fooled by their promise you've failed to see
the thin line between illusion and truth.
How does it feel to be their scapegoat?
Across the ocean of forbidden words 
and all your memories you swim.

Welcome to Necropolis
where all hope is gone.
life dwells in darkness.
where moan of all empty windows

takes your mind for painful trip
You are their scapegoat.
