Of all the shadows yours is the only one
that I remember, that makes me whisper your name...

Dust and ashes...
Is that what you are truly living for?
Just make your wish, darling,
so I can make it real

I am The One, The One who knows what hurts, what heals
I am The One... so make your fucking wish!

Come and take the key to my bedroom
and rip my bleeding heart out
and then take what never meant to be mine...

Come, come closer, I want to show you worlds beyond this world

Landscapes of madness that brought you down to me
Landscapes of madness that brought me down to you

Of all the shadows mine is the only one
that you remember, that makes you whisper my name...

Tell me where's the key to your bedroom
I'll rip your bleeding heart out
and I'll take what never meant to be yours or mine...

Even death will never take what always meant to be ours
