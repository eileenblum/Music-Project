Blessed by night
baptized by the ancient oath
drifting among the fields of self-destructive imagination
you're drowning down the sea of perdition

Is this a world you have been promised?
Wipe off your tears and face the truth
that lies among the realm of fall.

Perdition
Perdition
Perdition
Realm of your fall

Perdition
Perdition
Perdition
Realm of your fall

All they desire, all that they ever wanted to know
have now been discovered and lies upon your feet.
So take your chance and create a new order
become a god.

Would you dare?
Their world has come to an end.
Will your dreams come true right now?

Perdition - realm of your fall.
Perdition - realm of your fall.

And angels wept over the ruins of their dream
forced to kneel down to honour their new god.
