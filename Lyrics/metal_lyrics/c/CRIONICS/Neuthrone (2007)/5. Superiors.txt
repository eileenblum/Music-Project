"Do nothing secretly;
For time sees and hears all things
And discloses all"

The words of a wise man
You chose to ignore
And proved what human wisdom means
And the value of man's word

The secret prevails
The Rye'ehD'aah are blind and deaf to us
They don't know we have become
They are deaf to our thoughts

We can plan in peace
With our superior race
And prepare to annihilate
The scum that inhabits the earth

We have sprouted from you
Like an oak tree from earth
Which is nothing more than decaying mud
We will clean and purify the globe of uch vermin
And execure directive zero
To wash away our tracks
