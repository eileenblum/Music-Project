"The fear of Gehenna that has already once been suffered
Makes one aware that worse hell always exists"

What gives man his strength
When the whip over his head
Gives the orders
And the tormentor behind his back?

Hope is the second-last thing
Of which a man can be deprived
The other is only his life

When you hit rock bottom
Depraved of human dignity
Can you still feel human?
Is there, without the right for you to choose
Any point is using the gift of thought?

Hope is the second-last thing
Of which a man can be deprived
The other is only his life

The culmination of hatred and frustration
A sick metamorphosis, devolution
Tied hands, exhausted body and mind
Are driving you to insanity...
