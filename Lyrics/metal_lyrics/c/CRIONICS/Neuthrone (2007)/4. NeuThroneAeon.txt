Set off neutron bomb!
Annihilation for the new beginning
Destroy pyode amedha
Forefathers' death for development of new life

When your feeble organisms are exposed
To a lethal dose of prompt neutrons
You are finally aware of what us coming

As molecules disintegrate into ionised particles
So your world falls to pieces
That which you had not taken notice of
Will accompany your dreams of freedom

Neuthrone era -- white hell
Frozen earth, where are your greens and blues?
Icy coffin, rotating in space
A warning sign for the weaker

We watch as the dirt is washed out
You are caught in the whirlpool
Of the dance of death
The icy water is a new baptism to purify the earth

Turn on the neuthrone climate control systems
Prepare for acclimation

Blessed are those who will not survive
As the future of those who do
Is in the colours of death
