Rye'eh-X'D'yh, the work of excavation
Is coming to an end
We are running out of resources
We are drawing up further plans of action

Until the end of excavation and take off
Do not stop filing reports
Even in just cases
The council doesn't permit
The use of the directive zero

The destiny of each race
Is to find itself in the universe
To achieve unique, cosmic harmony
To exist and co-exist among the stars
For as long as they do

Efficiency and safety
Separation of the new species
Calm plan formation and realization of directives
Away from the cosmic cattle

Decoding and reconstruction complete
And escort ready to take
Over the X'no-D'aah from level 6
