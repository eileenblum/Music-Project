Down, into the mines!
That's the way your evolution is going...
Closer and closer to the very bottom...
Wasted chances and possibilities to create
The better and more organised

So many years have we trodden on your face
Forgive us our ignorance and egoism
Let us go back to the times of symbiosis
Our dearest mother earth!

Work, don't think!
You were the masters of your own face
Now it's time for you to be
What you are best at being
Pyode Amedha (soft scum)

So many years have you trodden on her face
Your sins have been judged
Work, don't think
Your hell earth

Unanswered prayers
Empty words, so many years without change
...amen...
