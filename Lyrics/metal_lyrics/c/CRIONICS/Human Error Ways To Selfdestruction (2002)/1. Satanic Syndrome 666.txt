I obliterate all feelings of mine
This is the beginning of the end
You repress a revolt inside
You won't succeed

Fear disappears in infernal fire
Venomous flames burn your desire
Ashes to ashes, blast to blast
I feed my power with false trust

Rip off the dirt that smears you from birth
Try to take your own torch and find the way
I am The One, Cosmic Power Of Destruction
Open the gates and follow The Beast...

...Here comes my microarmageddon...

Satanic syndrome six-six-six
I lead the crowds of threading crucifix
Fuck the human words of devotion
Satanic syndrome is the right emotion

...Here comes my macroarmageddon...

From fire and carcass you garbage!
You trod your hope on pessimism's edge
False acclamation has blinded you
Now you feel pain of the double betrayal!
