The handicap of mine that leads me to gallows
A vessel of time leads towards eternity
As virtue is torment for mortals
A poisoned chalice immortals awaits

Garden of Eden, the day evil dreaded
Dressed in blur of paradise you were
Guidance of God broken
Taste inferior world
In instalments dying

Relics of past sunrise beheld
Distorted ideas poisonous grain sowed
Announcement of evil presence
Hate, love, stone to death hallowed whores!

Midnight arrives with sins of thousands years
Mourners in black share in distress
Rise up in erotic fire
And burn the curtain of lustful desire

Lure that graces the creatures of meat
As javelin drives in
But take it out to make you humble
And tainted with lunatic supremacy
