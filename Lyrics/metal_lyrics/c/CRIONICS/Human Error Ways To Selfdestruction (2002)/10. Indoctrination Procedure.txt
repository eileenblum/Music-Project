I abandon what can't be proved
To free my mind of the doctrine of lies
Overbearing king, common dictator
Now I am God

Bow to me, down on your knees
Mass culture will be no more
Sardonic laugh around the world
Fluctuating human nature

Sleazy priest, vault of naivety
Come my sheep I will keep
My hands on harvest of gold
...God bless you...

Fucking priest, morbid desire
Come my boy be my toy
Let me touch your skin
...God thanks you...

Persecution of human race
With holy host and trey
Deratisation of grey masses
Man, god, rat, Absolute, worm?

Avid for aspergillum sinner am I?
Mean Adam's descendant?
I hate phlegmatic reactions
Deeds of flesh emitting humility
Contempt...

Complexity of human nature
Intricacy of choices, moves and behaviour
Allows living in different ways
Not to adopt dogmas thoughtlessly

It's time to exonerate our minds
To stop Christian expansion
Based on weakness and myth
Reign in confusion sophisticated solution
