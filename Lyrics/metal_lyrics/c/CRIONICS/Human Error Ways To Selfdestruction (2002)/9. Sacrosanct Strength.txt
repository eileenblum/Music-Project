Defeated or not they come back in silence
And evil on their faces
Give the feeling of vengeance's desire
Centuries went by and there were many wars

Once they were triumphant and once not
The enemies expanded, gathered
And pagans have been loosing many battles
After many years they were
Attacked, oppressed and killed
They hid in the woods and caves
But after all they were murdered

Only the strong survived
Wrote tale that rouses fear and thrills
And their sanctuaries, stone circles and ruins
Prove that their power and beliefs will survive...
...Forever!
