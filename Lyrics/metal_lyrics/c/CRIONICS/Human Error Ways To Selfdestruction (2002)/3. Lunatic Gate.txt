I'm discounting my life by the hour - glass of suffering
Locked in my mind
Betrayed by my own dreams
My eyes flashed with hatred

Walk by the lunatic gate
Enter an icy cold existence
Thorny passage in starlight
In the line of horizon's end

I'm preparing my body for the great moment
Enter an icy cold existence

...Stench of the world in decay
I'm travelling through
The oceans of anxiety

Inside of me!

There's nothing more than burnt ruins
Non-existing nightmares swallowed me
Within a strange dream of delirium

Thorny passage in starlight
In the line of horizon's end
Welcome to my unreal vision
Cosmic travel with insanity
