Feel the darkness that surrounds my soul

Feel the cold in the dark, feel the anger that fuels me and tears me apart
Why did you die without giving me a final chance to say goodbye?
You've left me all alone

Down to my knees I fall and I'm realizing that I'm crawling in the dark
Yes, I know. I'm down to my bones
Mark my words; I will stand my ground

These last words I had to say were words meant to bridge the gap that tore us apart
But you did without leaving me a final chance to say goodbye
You've left me all alone

Down to my knees I fall and I'm realizing that I'm crawling in the dark
Yes, I know. I'm down to my bones
Mark my words; I will stand my ground

Between love and hate, suffer and anger
Can you see my soul that is in danger?

Down to my knees I fall and I'm realizing that I'm crawling in the dark
Yes, I know. I'm down to my bones
Mark my words; I will stand my ground
