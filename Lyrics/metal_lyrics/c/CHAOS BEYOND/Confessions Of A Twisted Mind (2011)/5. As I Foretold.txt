You have never ever thought before about the reason you're living for
You live your life in loneliness; nothing's there but emptiness
Your emotions are just taking away the breath that you need
To soothe your heart that's saying: "The only salvation lies in death"

I did foretell. There's no way you can escape
You've been dead long before

All you've done for relief pushed you deeper into grief
Living on makes no sense, it's too late for amends
The fire in your heart is fading, you can't seem to find a remedy
The voice in your head is saying: "The only salvation lies in death"

I did foretell. There's no way you can escape
You've been dead long before

No fire to go on, no reason to live
It's salvation you're seeking and salvation lies in death

I did foretell. There's no way you can escape
You've been dead long before
