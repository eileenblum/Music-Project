See the shadows in the dark, see them haunting me
The creature's glowing eyes watching my steps, I cannot run
Am I paranoid? Is this real?
Am I distracted from my trial?

I'm lost, I can't describe
My fear is taking control of my mind
I just want to save myself tonight

I try to hide myself but there's no place to rest for me
And it is my fear and paranoia that take control of me

See, the creatures in the dark are surrounding me,
They have me in their vice, there's nothing left but to fight

I'm not paranoid, this is real!
I am obstructed from my trial

I try to hide myself but there's no place to rest for me
And it is my fear and paranoia, that take control of me
