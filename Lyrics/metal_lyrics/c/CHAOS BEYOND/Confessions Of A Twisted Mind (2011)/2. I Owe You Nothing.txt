When you told me that you needed distance between us
I was petrified because I did not expect that you had the nerve to be so cold to me
You were just inconsiderate

Now it's out. It's over
You've ruined all I've felt for you
And I owe you nothing more than a cold goodbye, enough spoken
Now I do realize all the times we had were wasted
But I will not give up to show you that I'm not broken

Thank you for the pain you have caused in my heart but since I have heard that you suffer
I feel better now

No, I do not care for you. These times are gone
Leave me and get out of my sight

Now it's out. It's over
You've ruined all I've felt for you
And I owe you nothing more than a cold goodbye, enough spoken

Now I do realize all the times we had were wasted
But I will not give up to show you that I'm not broken

Can't you see you walk alone?
Solve your issues on your own

I will not forget that it was you who taught me how to hate
