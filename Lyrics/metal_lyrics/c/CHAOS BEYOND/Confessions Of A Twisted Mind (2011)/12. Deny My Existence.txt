See me roaming through the night to find the light
That has gone out the moment that you've died
See me shiver in the cold, I can't go on, all that I feel is this emptiness

See me drowning in the pain of loneliness
There is no one who can hear my call into the void
You disappeared

I dedicate myself to the things that I fear I cannot live
But I live without you and

Here I am again at the point of no return
It's the end of the game, I deny my existence

I dedicate myself to the things that I fear. I cannot go on

Here I am again at the point of no return
It's the end of the game, I deny my existence

You lie six feet underground
I will follow you into your grave

I dedicate myself to the things that I fear I cannot live

Inside my memories, there are so many things that I regret, but I cannot take them back
Inside my memories resides a picture of you, but it fades
