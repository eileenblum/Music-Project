See the hordes of demons, all invading into our realm
I fulfill the prophecy and stand alone against this evil army

I fight, I rise against
You see me there until I'm falling
I fight until I die
And when I bleed
It's desecrating

Can you see the angels falling from the sky?

I fight, I rise against
You see me there until I'm falling
I fight until I die
And when I bleed
It's desecrating

Despite I have a soul, this desecrating essence in my blood comes from hell, because I'm a demon

I fight, I rise against
You see me there until I'm falling
I fight until I die
And when I bleed
It's desecrating

This essence in my blood, you see me fight until I die
