We are meant to be, this is what I want
This is what I need, it is so hard to find the one
Why won't you come and be by my side
I have to leave this world outside

I am not more than alone and lost inside myself
I don't have the will to go on, I'm heading into my grave

It is prepared for me, this world won't let me be
I don't want to play this stupid game
What do you want? Please tell me
Don't just obey society

I am not more than alone and lost inside myself
I don't have the will to go on, I'm heading into my grave

Spread your wings over my head, I need your shelter
Come, spread your wings over my head, I need your shelter
I need it now

This wretched world can go to hell, I have to know where I belong

I am not more than alone and lost inside myself
I don't have the will to go on, I'm heading into my grave

Spread your wings over my head, I need your shelter
Come, spread your wings over my head, I need your shelter
I need you now
