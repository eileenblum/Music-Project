I cannot see a way to escape
My bleak destiny awaits
The path I've chosen, a mistake
The chains that bind me will never break

Long time ago I sacrificed
My heart and soul for you
I cannot find my peace of mind
Look at the pain I'm going through

All this agony that I took away from you was just
The sacrifice I had to give
It was your final chance to live

But you just kept going on and on like you did before
You did not learn anything from this

Why won't you offer me a helping hand to pull me out of the shadows that tie my soul to the depths of suffering

My sacrifice was all in vain
The gratitude you've shown was fake
Please release me from this pain
There's nothing more that I can take

Do you see me in the dark?
My soul is burning in eternal flames for you to realize
That you need to redeem yourself
But you've abandoned me although I did this all for you

My sacrifice was all in vain
The gratitude you've shown was fake
Please release me from this pain
There's nothing more that I can take
