Your eyes are watching me with anger and aggression
Your mind is full of hate, suppressing your depression
You've never thought about the reasons for your doings
And no one cared about you as a human being

So you've never cared about the consequences
This is what you've got, your life is in ruins now

Can't you see that you're on a lonely path to hell?
And I've told you long before that you've just given up yourself to pain and hate

Your violence is a cry for help, because you suffer
From agony that has destroyed your feelings

So you've never cared about the consequences
This is what you've got, your life is in ruins now

Can't you see that you're on a lonely path to hell
And I've told you long before that you've just given up yourself
To pain and hate

Six times I've tried to drag you out
But everything was in vain
Now that you are on your knees again
A seventh time won't occur my friend
