Blood is all I need; I need to kill
I need to feed
My eyes are observing
My sight is bloodred

I scent your fear when I hunt
I cannot wait till we confront
Angst gives your blood a sweeter taste
I'm ravenous

And when you lie then in my arms
There's no use denying that there is this craving in my heart
I'm doomed to kill and seek your blood

I can't control myself because the beast within is stronger
I am eternally lost and doomed to kill

And when you lie then in my arms
There's no use denying that there is this craving in my heart
I'm doomed to kill and seek your blood to grant me eternal life and survive the curse of darkness
My sight is bloodred

Blood is all I need
I need to draw your soul
I need to goddamn feed
In my arms you die tonight
You'll be dead by my side
All I need is you and your blood
