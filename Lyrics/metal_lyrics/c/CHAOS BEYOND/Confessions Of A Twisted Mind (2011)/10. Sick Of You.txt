I am sick of it all
Sick of your actions, sick of your self-overconfidence
I can't watch anymore
I have to react and tell you what you are

Your anger comes from fear that you'll end up alone
Depression's causing you to be insane

I can tell, this violence leads to nothing more but misery

You believe that the ones near you are guilty for your faults
They have to bleed when you see no other way out

You are nothing more than a man without faith, a man without respect for others
I am telling you this, because I can see that you spread this misery

You believe that the ones near you are guilty for your faults
They have to bleed when you see no other way out

Your anger comes from fear that you'll end up alone
Depression's causing you to be insane again
