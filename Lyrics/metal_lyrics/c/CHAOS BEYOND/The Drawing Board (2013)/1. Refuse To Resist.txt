I've never felt like turning tables.
I've never felt the need to care
for problems of modern community
All I want is my bubble of reality
I choose the path of least of resistance
a wall of security
all I have ever done was turn my head
away from reality
Never
has it
been part of my business
The secret
To my happy life
I close my eyes
Turn off my mind, I refuse to resist
Keep all sorrow in periphery
No, I don't want to have it close to me
Poverty and civil wars are not my fault
If I don't look then it won't touch me at all
Why don't you come and have a look?
You will find bliss in ignorance
Inside my cozy bubble
There is a madman's paradise
It is the key to an easy life
I know what you should try
Turn off your mind and refuse to
Participate in this chaotic madness of today
Follow my signs and refuse to resist
By insisting, we will live our lives in pain
This isolation, you don't have to understand.
Do you know what this means?
Respect my existence
Solitude is what I've chosen
Leave
Expect my resistance.
Wait a minute, I'm just the same
I should have it close to me,
participate,
turn on my mind
and not refuse to resist.
