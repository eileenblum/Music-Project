I am awake. my eyes are open
But something feels off today.
These images â have I lived through them
Or is my mind playing tricks on me?
Is this my life? Is this dream or reality?
I'm insecure. I don't know what's in front of me.
Each step I take might lead me into
A maelstrom of memories.
I look for help, my senses fail me.
How do I deal with uncertainty?
I can't discern dream from reality.
Two worlds have merged,
So what is in store for me?
The path's before me but I can't find my way.
I want to move but my feet won't leave the ground.
These illusions are nothing but obstacles,
Preventing me from doing what I want to do.
I won't allow myself to lose control.
I am the master of my own world.
What I recall are lies my mind creates,
The foreign matter I won't tolerate
They're all the same, dreams or nightmares,
Are hindrances in my way.
And I won't rest until I've found them,
Until they're shattered to see things clearly
No, I won't rest, until they're gone - again.
There they are! I will get rid of them.
It's finally time to say: âDistorted reality, be gone!â
The dreams are dead. I am completely free.
Nightmares have left my plain of existence.
My wounds are healed. My focus is regained
Determination is now my companion.
Dreams are a construct of the mind.
The answers lie in the present.
