It's party time!
I'm hanging with my bros, looking for some fun
To seize the night.
Tonight's going to be legendary
We are done warming up
We're heading down to our favourite club, let's meet some ladies
The place is packed, the girls are hot. Where are our drinks, mate?
A couple of shots in front of us, let's get this party started!
Oh, look at that! a girl is walking up to us and she says:
"Forget it, boys. you will never get this."
What the fuck? That's ridiculous. No one looked at her! What got into this
bitch?
So please explain to me
What's with this rejection?
They should enjoy themselves,
Embrace their lives and socialise
Let's get serious: why don't they loosen up?
Is there a certain reason for their unnatural behaviour?
They defeat
The very
Purpose of human nature
What do they
Expect to
Gain from their pointless tough act?
What is there to prove?
Do they want to be miserable?
Why would someone act like that
by their own choice?
Why do they even bother
Going out at night when
They're unable to
Enjoy the company of others!
So nightlife seems to be only their grandest stage
A circle of people who want to show what they are not.
What the fuck? That's ridiculous! Life is so much fun but they're doing this shit.
