This is the truth you are scared to face
Wake up, rise and shine
Stretch out your arms and legs
Breathe in the stench of a brand new day
Nothing new awaits you today
Get in line, take your place
Enjoy the company of the mindless ones
Your daily routine does not lead to fulfilment
It is a doctrine meant to break your soul and will
Come disregard the values forced upon you
Betray your kin and simply
Turn your back on this horrid travesty
Don't you want to be free from all of this
I can't see why you're still a part of this
I don't know why you blindly obey, but
I won't give in. No, I won't give in at all.
Hey, you!
Yes, I'm still talking to you. Are you still
In this
Tedious cycle they call a good life?
What do you need to lastly proceed
To being far more than they want you to be because
Fulfilling our dreams is all we have
Remember you're a unique individual
Protect your precious freedom against all odds
No, don't believe what they say
Oh, this is no time to obey
No, don't believe what they say
Fight!
Deny!
Their filthy, useless lies
These thoughts are vital, vital
Don't let them out of your head
Accept!
React!
Yourself you must protect
These thoughts are vital, vital
For survival
