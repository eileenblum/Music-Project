You were the reason why I woke up
Why I breathed and why I cared
You were the oxygen I longed for
When I was down and gasped for air
You are the one
That Iâd call worth dying for
The only thing
I ever worshipped and adored
You were the one
That gave me strength to hold on
My precious one
Iâll never let you go
We knew sometime this day would come
The day youâd have to leave
I just didnât know it'd come so fast
I still donât want to believe
Yet I see images of you
But then they disappear
There's so much i want you to know
I wish that you were here
The hopes for us I've had are gone now
But the warmth inside remains
The time we've spent together
Has turned me into
The man I am today
All these places we have been to,
Where we laughed and found a place to rest,
My fond memories I've held dear
Are now pale shades of grey
You've tried to
Promise me that things won't change
It's not your fault
That not a thing has stayed the same
Sometimes I
Wish I could turn the hands of time
To change wrong to right
The hands of time wonât move for me
It is time for me to see
That you won't walk this path with me
I will have to find my way
The hopes for us I've had are gone now
but the warmth inside remains
The time we've spent together has become a relic of the past
There's no need to tell me how you feel
the inner truth needs to come to light
accept these feelings as they are something
I should not hide
