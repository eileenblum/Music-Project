Welcome to this world
Come take a seat and make yourself feel as comfortable as you can be
Donât shut your ears
What youâll hear might make you resent the world and what it stands for
Possibly, the only thing to keep us sane is
Magically hidden in plain sight
Liberty, love and equality
Withheld from and by us unwillingly
Insanity, commoner than common sense
Tragically's turned into normality
Community is what we've got to be
But triviality is our enemy
Something has the world united
Something has the world divided
For us to see, for us to be
Forever something that we'll never be
Wait with me, come to see
This humble message won't be heard
What we do, equals to
Fallen leaves fighting against the wind
Society, twisted and corrupted, could work
Perfectly if we were to see
Finally that all conflict is our doing
And not some natural phenomenon
Humanity, stubborn and xenophobic
Honestly fears evolution and
Diversity, so we're blind to see
That no solution is needed
Something has the world united
Something has the world divided
For us to be, for us to see
Forever something that will never be
The world's before you, ask yourself what you see
The revelation twists your head
The world's around you, ask yourself what you feel
The truth might hurt, don't you agree?
Everything has the world united
Nothing has the world divided
Free your selfish mind
