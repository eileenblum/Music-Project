Arise
Horsemen of the apocalypse
The bells have chimed
For tonightâs the night
When we will set out and attack
Smash the worthless lives
We will define a new breed
Because rotten seeds have thrived
then we shall burn down the field
Regret them
Confront your sins
The time has come for us to rise
Accept them
Redeem yourselves
Our patience is exhausted, you've woken the storm
From menacing shadows
Observe the burning sky
The seventh seal is broken
As angels blow the clarion
Your fate is set in stone
Mortals,
Get down to your knees
And bear witness to your deeds
For we are
Law, jury and judge
What
You saw
Is what
You reap
Brace yourselves for the final judgement
The apocalypse is near
The apocalypse is here
