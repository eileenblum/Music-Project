As I returned from embattled fields
Within I carried the fetor of death
Along with the forsaken's wrath
My loss, my agony and shield
My soul is wounded
It was behind forgotten lore
If I cannot reach
Salvationâs hand in time then
Hatred shall reign
Over me for evermore
Wicked vengeance
Will you forever blind my sight?
No more battles
It is settled
My hatred is dismantled
A new dawn
Emerges
The path to serenity is enlightened
No further blood
Shall be shed
For I have found my inner peace
Lust for payback
Will decease
As time has come
For no regrets
Resurrection
My old self is gone
The past has shown
The feelings that I now deny
Retribution
It plagues me no more
The world shall know
That this is my final hatred
Lo and behold!
No nightmares
I have emerged enlightened
I've overcome
Damnation
Harmony will prevail from now on
No vengeance, I'm independent
and my descendants
Will carry on the will of life
My obstructed mind
Swayed and confined
I couldn't see the light
The chains are broken
Free at last
I'm washing off my dreadful past
The door is open
Bridges burn
I've reached the point of no return
