The sky is clearing up
The sun is bright and warm
Captured by this single moment
It feels like time is standing still
And everything around is faded out
The second that your eyes met mine
I could feel my heart ignite
Not a thought does not revolve
Around your flawless beauty
I now know, I can't resist
Your precious smile
The path I walked had always been blocked
But you came and paved the way
Only with you as my companion
It seems like I am not on my own
I want to walk this road with you
Even if I don't know where it may lead me
For so long it felt like ages
I had no direction in life
On a road leading far away from home
On my own i used to stumble
With nobody by my side
To show me the right direction
To guide me into the light
But now it seems as if relief
lies in your sparkling eyes
The path I walk is meant for two
I want you to know I'm here for you
This road we'll take together at all
I can assure you I will catch you whenever you fall
Now with you as my companion
This road seems to be good and true
The path ahead is leading us home
Wherever this place is meant to be
