For we are many
We will stand on our feet
United we will rise
Rise up from the ashes you left by
burning down our self-esteem
Like a child with a magnifier
Playing god, plaguing ants
You try to pull us down
New role models, plastic mannequins
Success equals looks
Who needs skills?
Every path we walk
Persuasion's opulent
Break out of this vicious circle
This is your chance
Go move your ass
It is only up to you
Break the cage to free yourselves
From the claws that hold you tight
We'll burn the pictures implanted
Take a look into the mirror
And you will find your confidence
Everywhere you look
Superficial, artificial
Idols of beauty
We wonât take this any longer
The time has come to bend the bars
Of the prison you've made us
This is our chance
All the shit you have given us to digest
Now seems so useless and easy to resist
So now watch
Your fake empire
Burn to the ground
You'll pay the price
Weâll smash your plastic dreams
That you have created
Your own weapons
Will bring you down to your knees
It is only up to us
Break the cage to free ourselves
From the claws that held us tight
Weâve burnt the pictures implanted
As we looked into the mirror
We have found our confidence
To put obstructions in your way
Our resistance will live on
We don't give a damn about your looks
