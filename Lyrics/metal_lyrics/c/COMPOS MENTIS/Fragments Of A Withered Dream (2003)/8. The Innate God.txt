Chaos surrounds me, my world has crumbled up
Only fragments left of what I believed in
Leaves me with a broken soul, bewildered
I yearn for the times that were

Hate flows through my body as I realise
Years were wasted, I based my life on a lie
Subjects of an illusory god inveigle into hypocrisy
Leading puppets into self-deception

A phenomenon created to anaesthetize
With a slumbering world as the aim
White clouds of coma descend from above
It's called religion
But I'm the only God now
Now there are no rules

Unleashed power surges through my veins
I'm reborn as the ruler of the world
Leaving the weak masses to fear me
In their imaginary innocence

I have reached the highest state of self-control
Nevermore shall I be told what to do

A phenomenon created to anaesthetize
With a slumbering world as the aim
White clouds of coma descend from above
It's called religion
But I'm the only God now
Now I make my own rules

Divinity is innate
