As I scrutinize my inner self
I see what I really am
I understand that evil is a part of me
I don't know what to do
All my life it has been suppressed
Now I can't hold it back
Abrupt outbursts of rage keep confusing me
And I have lost control

I don't know why everything has been taken from me
There's nothing left but an utter loss of hope

Lingering behind my innocent facade
It feeds on my weakness
Heal me
The beast inside must be who I really am
It lies beneath my skin
Help me

As I look upon the changes
I see what I've become
But now I've learned to accept this new identity
And I know what I want
I understand the great joy of solitude
All my life I'll stay alone
A constant flow of pure rage delights me
Now I'm in control

Now I realize why everything is gone
I have unchained the beast that I am - and I've been born again

Traces of atrocity follow me
Chaos leads the way
Hate me
The beast inside must be who I really am
It lies beneath my skin
Fear me
