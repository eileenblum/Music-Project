Cast among the waves of an ocean of hate,
His mind is like a storm
Torrents of thoughts drift aimlessly around
Yet they only focus on one thing

The moon embraces him with her cold light
As he is swallowed up by the clear and frosty night
Darkness flows through his quivering body
And intensifies his burning hate caused by

Temptation, projection - you become my scapegoat
Temptation, projection - I can't resist

The steel flashes proudly in the moonlight
As he flings himself on the dark silhouette.
Her frightened eyes open up wide with fear
While the knife penetrates the flesh.

I dream of her with another
I think of her with another
I see her with another
If I can't have her no one will

Temptation, projection - you become my scapegoat
Temptation, projection - I can't resist

Red flowers come out around the body
While her life slowly fades away.
All they ever had is ruined within seconds
Love is a sin
