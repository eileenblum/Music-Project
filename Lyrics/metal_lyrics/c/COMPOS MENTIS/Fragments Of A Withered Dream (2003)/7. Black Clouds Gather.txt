Black clouds gather
Small drops are born and whirled down
They splash against the cold ground
Perplexed and ignorant of what to come

Engulfed by a stream and carried away by the current
All attempts to get away are in vain
And the stream just keeps going, keeps growing
A chaotic ride in the torrent of life

The moment we are born we begin to die
Mortal souls longing for salvation
A carnival of mindless and blind forms the world
Lying, drying, dying

Crushing against sharp rocks the drops are shattered
And cast up in the blue sky
Struck by rays of light they evaporate and disappear
Nothing ever changes

Small drops drown among millions of others
In their search for an explanation
Thousands of archaic lies disguised as solutions
Save from absurdity

Searching for meaning
Striving for innocence
Following the prescribed
The only thing that gives strength

The moment we are born we begin to die
Mortal souls yearning for salvation
A carnival of mindless and blind forms the world
Lying, drying, dying

Black clouds gather...
