As I look into the mirror all I see is a shadow of what I used to be
This is I - strangled in conformity
Somewhere deep within, I know the embers glow but the flames refuse to burn
This is I - dying while trying to live

All I want is to spread the wings of passion
And break free
Unfold my leaves like a rose in spring
And be free

Stripped of every dream, every vision
Emptiness walks with me

I've looked on my life as a detached spectator
Watched the passion die away
A weakened creature is what's left of me, my existence is merely tragedy
I tremble as I realise that none of my dreams were fulfilled

Locked up, fucked up... I fear the end is near
I hate myself for what I have done

I want to spread my forgotten wings of passion
And break free
Unfold my leaves like a rose in spring
But this is I - dead among the dead
