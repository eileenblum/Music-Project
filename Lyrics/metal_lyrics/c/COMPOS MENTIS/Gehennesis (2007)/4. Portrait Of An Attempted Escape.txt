A cold caress awakens me
An omen of nightmares to come
Illumination and darkening amalgamate
Blinded, I resign

Imprisoned behind imperceptible bars
I am in a daze
I reach out for the outside world
But it escapes my embrace

We are all caught in a web of meanings
A web that we have spun ourselves
Humanity walled up in this prison of its own
Portrait of an attempted escape
We strive to read the book of nature
But it's our own story that we tell

Oh, please let this nightmare stop!

I shiver as I suddenly comprehend
The nature of my beliefs
Illusions invoked by tradition
Deception descended on mankind

Imprisoned behind invisible walls
This I cannot face
I reach out for the outside world
But it escapes my embrace
