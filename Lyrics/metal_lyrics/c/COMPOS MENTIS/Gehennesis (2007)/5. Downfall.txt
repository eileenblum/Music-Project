Whirling through claustrophobic tunnels
Thrown from side to side, relentlessly
I'm surrounded by viscous walls
That reach out for me

I flee with broken wings
Through the darkness of eternity
Shadows of memories repressed long ago
Pierce my thready mind

A flight from myself
A flight in myself

I flee with broken wings
Through realms of forgotten nightmares
Raped by the deepest fractions of my mind
It leaves me bleeding

A flight from myself
A flight in myself

But the fear abates
As my hope fades away
Every feeling subsides
In line with the advance of nothingness
