A journey through the land of the dead and hollow
Towards the radiance where treasure is dug
Down through the valley of the shallow
Escaping silently from the forest's fog

My precious shadow, it might now seem
That time has come to revive your flame
The wilderness' daze has blurred your gleam
But I'll obey the calling and surrender to the game
Expand the narrow horizon with streams of wine
Before the milk will strengthen my sorrows
I seek for what was always mine

The rise and fall of a kingdom's prime
Brief visions of a flag that time has torn

Mountain peaks lend voice to the wind
Angel choir cries, enticingly they sing
As I reach for the dawn in sin
Forgive this obsession and the forging of wings

Humility is blessed with nothing but scorn
To the piercing sound of the hollow horn
True will dares death without tears

The rise and fall of a kingdom's prime
Brief visions of a flag that time has torn
Towards the beautiful view with the immense roar
Prayers under the azure emptiness of time
