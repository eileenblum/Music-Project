Away upon waves of red
I depart from your gentle rivers of words
Now sail me off to strange worlds of plenty, tonight
Take me dancing on oceans of death
Sacrifice my soul to the blue fields of freedom

Let me sail away on uncertain streams of ecstasy and fizz

Shatter my body into tiny pieces
See how mountains of foam lift me up and the poles unite
Hear me now unfold like a suffering, but golden butterfly

The wind breathes new life into the never stagnant surface
Building massive towers at my sides
Opaque liquids cause bubbling naivety of the unseen, a heady voyage

Penetrating my mind with a watery rush and swallowing me

Let me sail away on uncertain streams of ecstasy and fizz

Crystals taking shape to puncture tired dreams
And old nightmares that'll reform anew
Hard and beautiful as a diamond's secrets
Illuminating the twilight like clouds
Floating in dissolved gravity beyond the ticking of time
Tickling, stirring and tasted by all possible senses

Thunder rumbles beyond the vault
A crack splits the sky into fluttering clouds
Now the eyes are lured closer to the spiral hole
Where the smashing waves kiss my wooden hull
Let me sail away on uncertain streams of ecstasy and fizz
Awake me when it's time
