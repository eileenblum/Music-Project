The metropolitan suburbia is a cage
Wings are naÃƒÂ¯ve banners, but keys
I see you in your jail of despair
Yeah, see you in your jail of despair

Suburban bird lost in gentle pain
I see you strangled in your fears
Spread your fantasy and unlock this repressing cell
Denude your heart today

Hear you utter a disguised lament
Frail and sore your prayers extend
But my hand is just a crude bridge
Yeah, my hand is just a crude bridge

The halo is a sling of shiny rope
Laughter a blithe dress of lust
Not a funeral parade beneath the sun

As I whisper my last goodbye
