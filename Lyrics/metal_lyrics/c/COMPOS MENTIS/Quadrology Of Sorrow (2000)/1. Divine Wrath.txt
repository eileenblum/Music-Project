Unfairness I now see
A man whose fate so terrible grim
A life in glory has been ripped away from his honest hands
A bride to be
Now nothing but a fantasy
Left alone with half a soul
And no more tears left to pour
But suddenly now I see
Raging from within a dark corner of his soul
A bestial lust so frightening large
Causing even me to close my eyes
A change of heart
A change in a man
A face which changes to an animal's
A cold, dark and vicious wind touches my skin
He is as calm as can be
He stands upright and calls out these words:
"der Mench ist Gott!", "domine Satanas!"
Vampires and demons gather and kneel
They have made a new master
He rips his shirt from of his body
And roars and hauls at the moon
And turns his face towards me
I now see his yellow eyes
Filled with lust and demonic power
He smiles and spits on his late beloved one's grave
He spares me
But I know not why
Till' this day I have never known why

And then he runs with all of his subjects out into the night
But when they reach the gate, warmth and light causes them to freeze
The demons scream and fight their way back to their own world
And the vampires dissolve and leave their ashes on the ground
I close my eyes
