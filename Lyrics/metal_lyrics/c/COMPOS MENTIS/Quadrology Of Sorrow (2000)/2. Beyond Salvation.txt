Farewell my beautiful bride to be
Let thy raven guard upon thy soul
Thou shall not be forgotten
No, not by any chance
Trust in me to be thy raven
A soulless carrier
Devoted in nothing but thy memory
Chosen and trusted
Beyond salvation
Let me be the one to carry thee to the land of the dead
I will fly thee through the dark forest of pain
I will protect thee from the lost ones
Soulless beings who reach out to grab thee
Just to make thee a member of their fiendish union
I already see their faces and hear their screams
"get thee hence!" I will scream
But they would already have turned away
Thy inner light have beaten them all
Just by one glance
And even the mightiest demon falls by thy hand
But I know not where I will find my peace
While my angle cries me to sleep
