Iâm on a road, on a highway
Gonna black and blue itâs my way
Have a word with you tell me something good

Always looking for a way out,
You know I wanna break out of concrete boots
Iâll be walking to hell for sure

Take you to a place you know so well
Gonna go back to our roots and throw it all away
Iâve been hiding this pain for all my life
Gonna start all over again

Iâll be walking to hell for sure [2x]

I want you back in my arms
The stone and the blood
Now itâs gone
I donât remember what we had
But it made me feel alive

Iâm on a road, on a highway
Gonna black and blue itâs my way
You know I want to break out

We are getting old
But we donât ever age
We just live our lives
Thereâs no time to waste

Find the shortest line
From the center of the world
Gonna start all over again

I want you back in my arms
The stone and the blood
Now itâs gone
I donât remember what we had
But it made me feel alive

Iâm on a road, on a highway
Gonna black and blue itâs my way
You know I wanna break out of concrete boots
Iâll be walking to hell for sure

Tell me if youâre on the road that leads us to the end
Iâve been hiding this pain for all my life
Find the shortest line from the center of the world.
