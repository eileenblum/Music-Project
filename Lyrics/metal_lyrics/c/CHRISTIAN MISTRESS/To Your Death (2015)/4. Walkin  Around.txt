It isnât enough for me to say you are no more
As I live and breathe I know you do the same
Now beyond the door, across this side of life
Walkin' around without a sound, without a voice

Lookin' for something to hold
But youâre givin' me nothing at all

At the edge of the forest Walpurgis nacht
Drink the black wine, do your own thing but get it right
From the outside lookin' in, youâre wanting more
Looking for something, something to hold

This fire will always burn
These hands will always work
This mind will always learn
But Iâd rather you were here
