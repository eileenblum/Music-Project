We wait for the dawn
Canât escape the knife of the neon lights burnin' out the stars
No one can see who we are
Just a teenage dream lookin' for a scene and falling apart

It was a dark place in time
To come runnin' back
And I was out of my mind
But thereâs no turning back
To the blinding light

I donât care anymore
I donât care
I donât want to hear it
Wherever I go youâre callin' my name

If I sing you this song
Itâs the only way Iâve got to throw the knife in your heart
Now arise from your sleep to seek precipice
Where things are not as they seem
And thereâs no turning back 
To the blinding light

I donât care
I donât care anymore
I donât care
I donât want to hear it
Wherever I go youâre callin' my name

Let it raise the dead where the blood was let
Our hardened hearts will damn the rest
We are standing on shaking stone
In the hours before the dawn
When we meet the dark, everythingâs alright
