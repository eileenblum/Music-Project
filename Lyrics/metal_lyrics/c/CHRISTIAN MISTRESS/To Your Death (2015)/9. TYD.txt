You think youâre free but youâre livin' in a fantasy
You try to get it right but itâs always so challenging
I wanna wait for you
I wanna see it through but stranger days are coming

I have made my choices, live free or donât
What more to say

Now my time has come and I have got to leave this town
Get rid of everything that threatens me into the ground
Out where the streets dissolve and houses are no more
Hereâs to your death, it meant nothing at all

I have made my choices, live free or donât
What more to say
