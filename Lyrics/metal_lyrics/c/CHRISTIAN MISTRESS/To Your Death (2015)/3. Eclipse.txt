Black moon horizon
How still is the night

Iâve been gone for so long
I can hardly clear my mind

Thereâs no place I can find
Moon is falling over the sun
Canât see what weâve become
Mixing words til their meaningâs gone

I am the diviner
Fiery tongues to burn the tomb

Donât ask me mortal questions
Iâm just a dreamer passin' by

Thereâs no place I can find
Moon is falling over the sun
Canât see what weâve become
Mixing words til their meaningâs gone

We take the damage done. 
The fall of Lucifer goes on. 

Youâre gonna take it all away
Your gonna take it all
Nothing to give, nothing to gain
Youâre gonna take it all
There is no place that I can find
Not even shadows left behind
