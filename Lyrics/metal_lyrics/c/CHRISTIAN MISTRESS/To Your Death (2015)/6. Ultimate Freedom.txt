Well thatâs life, feeling low again
Timeâs a wheel and we wonât see the end
Right now itâs the weight of the world
Will you carry me?

Comin' down from the highest mountain
Will you carry me?

Oh this road is worn, Iâve been here before
And tried to make it easy, put my heart in a grave
But thereâs no comfort there
Your love makes me insane
I am in disgrace, donât know where my mindâs been

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I am free

Iâm free to chase these ghosts
Surrounding all around infernal machine

Itâs what Iâm runnin' from that I want the most
But things just take too long and then I am lost
Itâs such an ageless time and life is flyin' by
How can I escape these never ending chains?

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I am free

Iâm free to chase these ghosts
Surrounding all around infernal machine

How can we live under this curse
And walk the labyrinth of lies that build our world?
All that we are reduced to stone
The hand of doom wonât leave us alone

Now in the ground and surrounded by dirt
Lay my defences down
Iâm the corpse that is willing to burn
Infernal machine
