The eye is watching me, where can I go?
Where there is nothing to see
Is it all for yourself?
Are you under its spell?
Does it radiate all that you know?

Black night
Gotta find the life beyond the light
Death creeps in the mind within gaining speed
Disaster when the scales are tipped
Never knowing when weâll meet again

Full moon night is a candle that will light your path
Through the hours and restless days
Hear me now
A story told beyond this world
Hear the words resounding fade

Maybe Iâm just wasting my time here
Lonewild stars across my eyes
Going back to all of the old ways
All of the things that I used to know

Maybe Iâll be left to decay
Or in the sky Iâll fly with the birds
Death creeps in the mind within leaving
All this is not my home
