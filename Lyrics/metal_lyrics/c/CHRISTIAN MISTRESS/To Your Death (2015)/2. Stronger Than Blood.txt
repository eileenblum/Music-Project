Death City: our sacrifice
Comin' for you don't be left behind
Dead angel out on the shore
Take our souls, you know who we are
Weâre ready to fight
Are you comin' along?

What weâve been told is not the only way
Where have you gone my friend?
Have hard times led you away?
Stronger than blood, stand beside me
Weâre ready to fight
Are you comin' along?

Weâre walkin' down all these dark streets with blood on our hands
We take the blame for our actions to live this way

I gotta know where Iâm goin' if itâs only today
I gotta get what Iâm after
Weâre ready to fight
Are you coming along?

Weâre taking something from nothing
Gonna give it away
Weâve got to fight for the answers
To live this way

I gotta know where Iâm going, if itâs only today
I gotta get what Iâm after
Weâre ready to fight
Are you comin' along?

What weâve been told is not the only way
Death city streets, where Iâll be found
Stronger than blood until the end
