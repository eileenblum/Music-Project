Other worlds, other worlds
Where I know youâve been
Things are not the same
And your life will begin

Looking for a place
Where your mind can let go
A simple ritual
To unleash the soul

Is this the open road
Will our bones go cold
Seeking the truth

Everywhere, everywhere
I see only ghostly hands

The silent warning
To leave while I can
Cannot breath, cannot speak
Iâm floating in the air

The weight of a feather
The glaze of a stare
Keep me in limbo
Attempt to define

The two-headed beast
That lives in my mind
Out on this open road
Will our bones go cold
Seeking the truth

Are we going down
To the place of no return
