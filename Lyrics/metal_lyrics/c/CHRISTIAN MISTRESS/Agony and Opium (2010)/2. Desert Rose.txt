High above the falconâs crest
Make way for earths unrest
Soaring on the razor line
Legacy of our demise

You are not just what is seen
Fill the cup â the burdenâs beast
All those who speak your doom
Lash out with no relent

What you see
Could burn out my eyes
In many ways I am lost
Oh desert rose

Donât you want to lie in the ether
Give in to mindâs unrest
Rays of light descending down
Vision of whatâs to come

There are things you cannot hide
Nothing escapes your eyes
High above vantage be damned
Rest in peace until your end

What you see
Would burn out your eyes
In many ways I am lost
Oh desert rose

How can you love someone
And never let it show
In many ways I am lost

Desert Rose

Only time will tell of the unfolding
What we search for
What weâre seeking is not
But a desert without end

I will lie in the ether
Give in to minds unrest
A ray of light descending down
Vision of whatâs to come

There are things I cannot hide
And nothing escapes these eyes
High above vantage be damned
To rest in peace until the end

Desert rose
