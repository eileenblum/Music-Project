I donât even want it
Oh but itâs the price that I pay
One foot before the other
As if there was no abyss

Itâs hard to see whatâs going on beneath the solid lines
All along the edges creep the things you cannot hide
Beckoning to the other side

All along the edges
All along the edges of death
Looking for some action
Looking for a new way to live

Riding on the edges
Riding on the edges Iâm sure
There wonât be another
Life that I know

Itâs hard to see whatâs going on beneath the solid lines
All along the edges creep the things you cannot hide
Beckoning to the other side

I donât even want it
Oh but itâs the price that I pay
One foot before the other
As if there was no abyss

Never enough, never enough
That is what I hear you scream

Telling me things I cannot seem
To get out of my head

Down on the floor and all ripped up
Nothing really affects me
Except for the way youâre trying to
Get inside my head

Never enough, never enough

There is a light
At the end of the road
Gonna get it right
Itâs my last chance I know

Hour to hour, dawn to dawn
There is no answer the feeling is strong

I can never get enough
Hour to hour
I can never get enough
Dawn to dawn
