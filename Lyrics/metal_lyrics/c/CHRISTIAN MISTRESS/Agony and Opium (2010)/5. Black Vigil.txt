Iâm gonna run
So far away from you
And when Iâm gone
With nothing left to loose

Iâll find a way
To get out of my head
All of the things
I was living for

On the horizon
On the building storm
How could we see
What would become

Iâm gonna run
So far away

Oh Iâm gonna run
I wonât be found
In tombs of fire and burning fates
You rest your head forever

Iâm gonna run
I know Iâm drifting on
Thereâs no time to wait

Through the ages
A reflection
Rivers flow
With agony and opium

Iâm gonna run
So far away

Oh Iâm gonna run
I wonât be found
In tombs of fire and burning fates
You rest your head forever
