Now dead and gone
So lay our bones

Coarse remains
Sepulture of days
We walk to the edge

Now dead and gone
A pierced to marrow

Cryptic pattern
To tear the walls
We walk to the edge

Until our death
Weâre unable to show
Nothing is sacred
Everyone knows

Caught in the lights
Faces aglow
Never stop
To see who we are

I see the door
Beginning to close
The final sky
It dissolves

Carry me home
Iâm lost out of sight
Lead me on
To the unknown

Oh please be kind
One last time â I lost myself
Now Iâm gone and I got no more worry
It is all made of stone
