I canât get by on what you give
You lead the lie and I know your tricks
Thereâs something wrong with a second chance
Always looked for what you have left

Iâm not the one and weâre not free
To know the rest of the story
Iâm not the one
Even unto the end

Black as light the only light
A single flame cannot be shown
Jagged pulse you feel no pain
The numbing deep is what you crave

Have I seen the catalyst
The rising corpse of tragic love
Got to get back got to leave that
Home in the sun

Thereâs a wicked look that hides your face
Canât ever get to a real place
In sleep as deep and sweet as death
See the past fading before me

Iâm not the one and weâre not free
To know the rest of the story
Iâm not the one
Even unto the end

Black as night the evil eye
Is staring out beyond the grave
Thereâs no cover I can run to
Never should go

As I write these final words
I lay the cards out showing why
Got to get back got to leave that
Home in the sun

Dirt cheap, sorely downcast
Had a lot of living low
I know that weâre damned from the start
Dirt cheap, slowly downcast
Had enough of little love
I know that weâre damned from the start
Dirt cheap, slowly downcast
Canât escape your evil love
I know that weâre damned from the start
Oh evil loveâ¦

Iâm not the one
Even unto the end

Oh this flame will never be shown
Though I never should go

All day long the evil eve
Is hammering a jagged pulse
Got to get back got to leave that
Home in the sun
