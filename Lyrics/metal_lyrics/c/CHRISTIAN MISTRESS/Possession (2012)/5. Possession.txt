[originally by Faith]Forces of unknown time and rage,
Knowledge that increases rage
Dark nights all filled with sleepless souls
My force of legends long ago told

Wizards, madmen you learned me all,
All that I know will make you fall
Misty light, shine of the crystal ball
My force once bitten you're all sold

[Chorus:]
Possession of nightmares
Make souls shout - out
Possession of all fears, scream it out

Now, just dream away and you will stay,
Stay in my power
Don't try to escape,
Cause I will rape you with my power

[Chorus]
