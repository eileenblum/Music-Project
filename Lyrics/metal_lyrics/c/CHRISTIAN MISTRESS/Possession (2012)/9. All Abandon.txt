A refuge
Leaves you wanting
Torrents overflowing

Come with us
There is excess and lust and it's
Just enough to fire the brimstone

Oh I wanna make a scene
Divination strong in my veins
Radiating so with all abandon

Had the chance to let it go
But we've known for so long
There's no hope against this river

Lost the key
Buried the blood
Now we let it go
With all abandon

Why deny your desire
Ringing out a sounding bell
One day we will be unveiled

You give in, time is now
To slay the saint, build your hell
One day we will be unveiled
