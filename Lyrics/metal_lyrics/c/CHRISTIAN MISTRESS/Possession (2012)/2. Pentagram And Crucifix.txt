Offering
Reeks of death
When the demon speaks
Feel its breath

Ritual of blood
Penetrate the womb
Poison the holy men
Shouldering their cross

I'm Leviathan restless daggers
Pushing in around his sides
Pentagram and crucifix
Mandalas put to the test

Level the head of the holy man
He's got no right to dictate life
He's gonna be damned with the souls of man
And bury in their strife

Writhing pain
Find the vein and attack
Sever the source of life
Won't wait to save you

A cry in vain
Strikes right through him
He can't begin to find the way
Pentagram and crucifix
They begin to look the same

Level the head of the holy man
He's got no right to dictate life
He's gonna be damned with the souls of man
And bury in their strife
