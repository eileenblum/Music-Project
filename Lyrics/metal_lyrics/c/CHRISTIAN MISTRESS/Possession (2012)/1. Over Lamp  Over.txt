Would you like to drink of this wine
Though the stakes are high you are on my mind
Move in color under a lost god
Sharp distraction but oh it's so divine

Lakes of black water
Drink and be well

C'mon fighter, show no remorse
I shine my boots with your blood I spill
All is forgotten &amp; you're a lost cause
Sharp distraction but oh it's so divine

Lakes of black water
Drink and be well

I wanna go
Straight back to those arms
Over &amp; over
Get the feeling it is wrong

I tried to stay back
Back where I belong
Over &amp; over
Its no way to get along

Draggin' down, losin' ground
I don't need your sympathy
Over &amp; over
It's the place I will be

Those words come on strong
I am goin' under
Wreckless, lies take hold
I will never know

Over &amp; over
Oh you drag me down
Over &amp; over
Seems that your love is never over
