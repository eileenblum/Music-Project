Don't believe in heaven
Don't believe in hell
There isn't anything
Beyond the physical

Eternity is a long time
Would you want to know yourself that well
Eternity is a fine time
But it's all in your mind

A light shines beyond the door

I've got plans for the long run
I got stories to tell
I've got schemes &amp; there's no knowing
What the future will hold

Eternity is a long time
Would you want to know yourself that well
Eternity is a fine time
But it's all in your mind

A light shines beyond the door

Nobody wants to wait around
Feel like they're sinking
And there's no way out

I had a vision deep in my head
We were laughing
As we met our death

You hold the fire
An eternal fire

I want to live not be broken
If I can't have that
Let there be nothing

Lightning strikes from
My hands, my eyes
Illuminating the unseen glories

How I live there is no tomorrow
How I live there is only today

You hold the fire
That eternal fire

I see truth in the madness
I will chase it to my last breath
I'll be no slave to mecca
Death will show

How I live there is no tomorrow
How I live there is only today
