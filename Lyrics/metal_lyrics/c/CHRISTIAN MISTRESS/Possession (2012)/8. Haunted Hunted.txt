If there's a time &amp; place
He will be gone when it comes along
He just needs to find somewhere to hide
Haunted, hunted

Feels the fire burning hotter
In the grave will he ever
Wait for the sky to turn around
Until the moon comes out
Will he ever

And in his garden at night
Where the black flowers bloom
Under the light
Of the flames reaching higher

Will he find somewhere to hide
A focused mind to get lost in a time
Where ancient reveries rise

I am death you are the vulture
Sinew, flesh and bone my altar
We are circling the tower
The pinnacle of sorrow

I know there' s wisdom inside
But as I seek it
I sever the line
To the pure heart I adored

Need to find somewhere to hide
A focused mind to get lost in a time
Where ancient reveries rise

I can feel it all around me
Sleight of hand surrounding
Sacrifice of your life
To reach the depths

To live or die drugged lover
What does it matter in the long run
The world goes on, it's oh so wrong
Until the depths

Haunted, hunted - I've had a taste
haunted, hunted - But now it's too late
I've been hunted - The omens of fate
Haunted, hunted - Chasm awaits
