I asked the mountain
Take me away from here
Out of this world
Where there's nothing left to give

I asked the sea
Would you bury me
In your waves of misery
Of right &amp; wrong

Waiting all night
But there is no sound
No sign they hear me cry

And the path you once walked through my mind
Can lead to you anytime
But there is no sound
No sign you are alive

All day is shadows
A valley of death between us
I want to find the way beyond

Before we return to dust
All we are forever lost
I want to walk into your sun
Until I am blind

All day is shadows
A valley of death between us
I want to find the way beyond
