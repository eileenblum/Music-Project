Am I a raging tyrant
A Lusitania beast
Do I have to tell you
We have taken this too far

Oh we are living so strong
But we are in the arms
Of yesterday and I want to be free
I'm on my way

Anger that pounds the streets
A fist on burning flesh
There is no sanctuary
Just mutation of the law

We are living so strong
But we are in the arms
Of yesterday and I want to be free
I'm on my way

So many things that I want to say my friend

Days are adding up
Time takes its toll
All your words like chains
Down to my soul

We are damned upon this stone
Let us be as one

I have not forgotten my resolve
I'm on my way
What's a voice without conviction
A song for yesterday
