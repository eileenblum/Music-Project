Down below
I choose where I want to be
But who couldn't use some convincing

Born in hell
Among the ever burning fears
Don't you pass me by I'm not hanging around

Never longed to belong

I'm movin' on
Even though there is nowhere to go

Black to gold
Some seek, some dissolve
Black to gold
You have got me feeling so bad

Heavy heart
Leaves me as the walking dead
Dreams I seek are already in my hands

Live it up
Fan the coals buried within
Beware when soon comes the end

Black to gold
Some seek, some dissolve
Black to gold
I can't give you my affection

If I let this go
With my mind exposed
Will the words turn black to gold

Though we play the part
And the chain is strong
Doubts echo all around
