falling down into the secrets
the secrets in my mind
leaving all my life behind me 
absolution hard to find 
memorys dawn in pale forgiveness
i know i was unkind
can you please forgive me
never enough, i fall apart

sawing feelings in my own cage
my soul is crying loud
longing for some rest in my brain
no more turning inside out
memorys dawn in pale forgiveness
my time to feel is gone
can you please forget me
never again, i`m lost on

heaven`s ground - lost between those feelings i have never found

sometimes i look in the mirror 
the mirror of myself
is it just a waste?  or something
something i should build
memorys dawn in pale forgiveness
my time to feel is gone
can you please forget me
never again, i`m lost on 

heaven`s ground - lost between those feelings have never found

i am lost in myself - on heaven`s ground
i am lost in myself - my soul cry`s loud

heaven`s ground - lost between those feelings i have never found
