even though you can`t rememeber my name
(you know me)
unhealthy games of love and pure disdain
(between us)
forlorn feelings lost in one small frame
(two in one cage)
breaking in silence, without pain
(we thought so)

and i`m so sorry i can`t hold you now, i can`t hold you now
yes i`m so sorry i can`t hold you now, i can`t hold you now

all the voices blaming me again
(echoes in my heart)
pretending lies, it`s always the same
(two in one cage)

and i`m so sorry i can`t hold you now, i can`t hold you now
yes i`m so sorry i can`t hold you now, i can`t hold you now
and i`m so sorry i can`t hold you now, i can`t hold you now
yes i`m so sorry i can`t hold you now, i can`t hold you now
