and here it is, the rain, i have waited for so long
coming down on my faith and bringing back so much that was gone
drop by drop an ocean, waving at my heart again
washing away the pain, here is my rain

here i stand naked again
i do not grieve anymore
innocent like a child again
the grief i`m waiting for

and here he is, the saint, i have prayed for to come
teaching me a lesson now and leaving all behind that was wrong
word by word a grace, growing in my brain
pulling under all the pain, here is my saint

here i stand naked again
i do not grieve anymore
innocent like a child again
the grief i`m waiting for

sometimes love grows
(sometimes) in a painful way

and here it is, the rain, i have waited for so long
falling down like tears of joy, keeping my heart save and warm
here is something i don?t want to miss again
here is my beloved rain

here i stand naked again
i do not grieve anymore
innocent like a child again
the grief i`m waiting for
