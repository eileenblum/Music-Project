save the pain - lift your head up and see
save the tears - and be free

you know you need the scars 
to see the truth in your mind
be strong and sure where you belong to, 
don`t be blind

save the pain - lift your head up and see
save the tears - and be free

the rain of self contempt comes down 
hard and unconditional
and you crawl with your wounds wide open 
on a long way of time
only to hear the chime of your heart again, 
and to save the pain

save the pain - lift your head up and see
save the tears - and be free
save the pain - lift your head up and see
save the tears - and be free
