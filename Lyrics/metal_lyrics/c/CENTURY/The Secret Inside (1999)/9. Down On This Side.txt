i`m sittin` in my room and waitin`for you to come,
but sometimes things are getting worse
and you are always wrong
you reached in every pore, in every nerve and fibre
i never tasted love like this before

down on this side - and i shouldn`t do the same
down on this side - and i shouldn`t do the same 

i was gettin? more than every boy, waitin`for you,
so easily
i liked the talks, i`ll always remember
i never wanted something else

down on this side - and i shouldn`t do the same
down on this side - and i shouldn`t do the same
down on this side - no i shouldn`t do the same
down on this side - no i shouldn`t do the same

i complained, you shouldn`t do, but you did...

down on this side - and i shouldn`t do the same
down on this side - and i shouldn`t do the same
down on this side - no i shouldn`t do the same
down on this side - no i shouldn`t do the same
