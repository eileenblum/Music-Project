far away from my last life
the sinner?s gone, i pray for you now
like a final breath, your are my forgiveness
there is nothing left to loose

all the memories i have, i have to accept
are they my inspiration?
I hope they have a meaning, i try to keep them secret inside

now your eyes are my world 
so wide shut, don?t you see me
not like my first lie, you can be the saviour
without i?m useless

all the memories i have, i have to accept
are they my inspiration?
I hope they have a meaning, i try to keep them secret inside

my revenge will come like the rain 
my faith is almost alive
your love will be my resurrection
my revenge will come like the rain

all can be nothing sometimes
if you have it, and still don`t crasp it
but also nothing can be everything sometimes
i have to accept

all the memories i have, i have to accept
are they my inspiration?
I hope they have a meaning, i try to keep them secret inside
