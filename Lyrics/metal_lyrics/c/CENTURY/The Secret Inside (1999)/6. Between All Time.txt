everything is like the dust on our memories - a great lie
all great exspectations fade like the sun in natural harmony

while we try to hold each other forever near - the shadow grows 
all these invisible lights we conceal will be released in tears

time - against us - a chain until death
time - between us - stealing every breath
acting in silence - all our lives - we are between all time 
there is no chance to try - all our lives - we are between all time

every day a burden sinking on our destiny - the distance melts
and all the days we have to go decreasing so easily between time 

time - against us - a chain until death
time - between us - stealing every breath
acting in silence - all our lives - we are between all time 
there is no chance to try - all our lives - we are between all time

my arms around you, please save this moment with me
maybe this moment can be the reason, 
maybe this moment will be the key 

time - against us - a chain until death
time - between us - stealing every breath
acting in silence - all our lives - we are between all time 
there is no chance to try - all our lives - we are between all time 
my love for you - we are between all time
my life with you - we are between all time
