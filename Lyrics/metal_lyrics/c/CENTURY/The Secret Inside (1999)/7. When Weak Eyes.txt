like any drop in the pouring rain, he falls the same,
without disdain, and he try`s,
try`s to find his own way out, honest and proud,
without a doubt

but then one day they detect, that hope and fear 
inside his head, and then they,
then they reached out their hands to touch his soul
to make him crawl

when weak eyes - see false light - in false lives - the truth lies

and after all his eyes turned black, so weak and lost,
so cold and sad
deceiving all the dreams he had one day,
his soul turned grey

when weak eyes - see false light - in false lives - the truth lies

when weak eyes - see false light - in false lives - the truth lies
reaching out their hands to touch his soul to make him crawl
when weak eyes - see false light - in false lives - the truth lies

when weak eyes - see false light - in false lives - the truth lies
