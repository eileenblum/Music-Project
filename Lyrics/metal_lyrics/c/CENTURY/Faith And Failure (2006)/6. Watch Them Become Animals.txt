Run with wolves. Breath in smoke.
Become your fear. He will become his fear.
They will find him. And they will ask him, what have you worked for?
What have you obsessed over? What have you hurt yourself for?
He'll say in life I was an artist, a painter.
And we'll watch his face change as he realizes his ideals go as far as his threshold for pain.
And he'll say in life I was something, I was someone, I had purpose, I had meaning, and they will all remember me.
They will keep a place for me in case I return.
Watch them become animals. Watch them feast.
Watch them break and dismantle themselves.
