And time collapses around them.
And suddenly home won't feel like home anymore.
They are guilty of trying.
But it goes both ways.
For you, for me, it's the same.
I won't take part.
Say your prayers then forget them.
Discard your affection.
And in time you remember.
More to say.
More to live for.
Repeat the motions.
Refine your existence.
Understand what you've done. Become your excuses.
Consequence you remember.
More to be, more to die for.
And they won't recognize your face anymore.
They will forget you.
Your time is up. Your life is gone.
