Set yourself ablaze for the last time you should know my name by now.
Put this world to sleep for the first time your failure in life will be taken to heart by the people who replace you.
And I'll take my place beside you. They heal you then eat you alive.
And time resolves space between us.
The captain is bound and will march off the plank while we laugh and we jeer and we spit and we find him guilty for the things that we've done.
