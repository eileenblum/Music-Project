Commence your cryostate self-preservation,
While I waste away in the landfill you've claimed before my home.
I would blow out my brians, I would choke my own heart,
To clean your soaking dust from the soles of my boots.
And speaking of souls, how much is left of your spiritual side, you ungrateful fucks?
I know you'll be dead long before I'm gone,
But I'll spit on your grave with every single song.

You better do it if it pays the rent, dick.
Cause you don't even know what you consider sacred anymore.
We're called to duty by our weapons contracts,
And front the bills to be locked up in a jail cell.

In two hundred years they'll thaw me out,
Pack me up and ship me off so I can fight their war.
I'll catch a bullet in the neck and return to the states,
But not before they confiscate my fucking shoes at the airport.

From the wolves all seated adjacent.
Lights out.
Lights out, motherfucker.
Can you see me? I'm coming.
Lock your fucking doors cause I'm bringing hell.

I finally found the sun tonight,
But she died long before we burned away the sky.
And years will pass us by, our truth becomes our lie.
We were so wrong to believe at all.
But now we know.
She'll find her way back to the light.
Find her way back to the light, and quietly begin again.
She'll sing her song again.
And years will pass us by, our truth becomes our lie.
We were so wrong to believe at all.

I got one more for you,
Clean up that fucking mess that you made in the gulf.
You think I'm buying this shit for nothing?
I need to poison myself in that ocean.
We got a price on our heads, so thank god for the deficit.
