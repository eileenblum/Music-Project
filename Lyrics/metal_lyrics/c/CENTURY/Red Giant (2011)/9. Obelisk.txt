So undeserving.
You've wasted it all.
You should have never had the chance.
Steady handed and desperate.
So undeserving.

Leave me behind.
And I had so much hope but now we've sealed our fate.
This is the end.
So just give up on yourself and become what you think you hate.

Remove your heart, erase your mind.
Consume yourself, become nothing.

We can see you from where you stand, and you do not look strong.
We've worked so hard to dismantle the heart of all your work.

And they all die the same but I'm still the man I never wanted to be.
I used to be the hand of god.

Leave me behind.
And I had so much hope but now we've sealed our fate.
This is the end.
So just give up on yourself and become what you think you hate.

Leave me behind.
And once we've shed our skin and forgotten our names.
This is the end.
Only then will we see we're all exctly the fucking same.

Remove your heart, erase your mind.
Consume yourself, become nothing.
