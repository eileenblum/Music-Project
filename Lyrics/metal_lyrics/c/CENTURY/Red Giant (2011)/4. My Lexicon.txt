Your delusion is deafening so our whispers will go unheard.
You've lived in my head for what seems like years.
Sleep soundly.
Sleep soundly while the house burns down around you.

All of your secrets are pieced together from fragments of something better.
You've lived in my head for what seems like fucking years.
Open your eyes.
You think you've made a dent.
I'm just embarrassed for you.
You've become a parody of yourself.
You've become what you think you hate.
Where is the one that I looked up to?

You have nothing profound to express,
You have nothing to offer me.
No original thoughts,
Nothing to say worth hearing.
Stop trying so fucking hard and just embrace it.
