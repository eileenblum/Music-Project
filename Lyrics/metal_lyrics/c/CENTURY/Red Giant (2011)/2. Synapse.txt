I was the brains behind this process.
The questions disappear and the logic is offset.
And how the fuck can you buy your own thoughts,
When they're sold to you by every bad idea you've fought?

And it won't always be this way.
By the time it goes to shit we'll be at heaven's gates.
But for now we indulge, for now we're ok.
While we ignore the consequence that our children have to pay.

Just make sure we stay terrified.
We need to sate our fucking fear and it's feeding time.
The homeland security system just went apeshit,
But I can't recall the code so I'll hide in my basement.

And it won't always be this way.
By the time it goes to shit we'll be at heaven's gates.

Everything we've ever discovered, everything we've accomplished,
Every disease we've cured, every family we've torn apart,
Every life we've created, every god we've ever feared,
Every phallic monument constructed: it's just a fraction of a millisecond.

In time the sun will expand and heat the earth until the oceans turn to barren land.
The sky will be red when our god is near,
And we'll burn the fuck away like we were never here.

And it will never again be this way.
And now we find ourselves standing in front of hell's gates.
But for now we indulge, for now we're ok.
While we ignore the consequence that our children have to pay.
Our children will pay.
