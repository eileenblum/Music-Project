Now watch your life come apart for someone else's entertainment.
Shoot everyone in your office building.
Drown your kids in the bathtub.
Burn your home to the ground.
Leave it behind. Leave it behind.
I was a baby-boomer's kid so you can all go fuck yourselves.
I saw three failed wars sponsored by corporate contracts,
So I'm not gonna shed a tear when this bitch falls.
Sacrifice yourself for a fucking idea and die for nothing.
Fly a plane into a building.
Now you've become your god and now you're gonna pay.
We're funding both sides of a war we can't win.
You wanna do something fiscally responsible?
Just kill yourself.

Welcome to Hell.
I'm counting down from ten with a knife in my head,
Like Rosemary Kennedy trying to recite the pledge.

Do you think this is fucking funny?
Do you even comprehend this bullshit?
Fuck you mother fucker
I will rip your head off
And fuck whats left of your esophagus
I wanna stab your eyes out
Eat shit you fucking bastard

Whoa Mike, calm the fuck down.
You don't have to yell and curse so much.
What are you so angry about?
You act like they've abandoned and sold you out.

Complacence and rapists and homophobes and war-mongers
And white supremacists and lobbyists and xenophobes and hypocrites
And every single seat in the U.S. House of Reps: Fuck you.

Walk through my spit, through your war-path.
