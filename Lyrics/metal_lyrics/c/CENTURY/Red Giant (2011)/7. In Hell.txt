We are the martyrs. We die for murderers.
We've been waiting for years for the hand of god.
Mercenaries travel in groups on the back of truck beds and pick our women at will,
And put the gun to their heads like they're just theirs for the taking.
While your sick god is too busy keeping the free market alive.
How could you ever make me bring a child in this world?
Just two searching eyes that just stare at me for answers.
But like a nation himself, he's divided in two by his own hopelessness and delusion.

You've been watching us swim in a sea of broken glass.
Yeah you've been watching us swim and we've got diamonds in our nails.
And no one knows it's me on the screen.
No one knows it's me at all.

Why couldn't I have just fucking died?
There's no room in hell for any of the shit you believe.

So just stare out into the west into the land of the bastards.
I don't think that you have enough money to keep yourselves at bay,
Even though somehow it seems you've collected it all.

You've been watching us swim in a sea of broken glass.
Yeah you've beeen watching us swim and we've got diamonds in our nails.
And no one knows it's me on the screen.
No one knows it's me at all.
