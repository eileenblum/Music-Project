If death dances with broomsticks,
I'll sweep the floor until I fix the disease that haunts the halls of my high school.
Dumb brunette broomsticks.
Bite the dust and get their nails did with the blood of animals.

Didn't you hear the wind?
She told the dogs to hide from the smog clouds painting the leprosy sky.
Oh, I know we're dirty.
We're putting superheroes on the backs of currency.
I know that something's wrong.

And if greed swings from stripper poles,
We'll fight the war with the bones of marilyn monroe and anna nicole.
And with their femurs we'll carve the swords that break the mirrors of little girls,
Cause beauty's made with an airbrush.
Beauty's made with an airbrush.

Didn't you hear the wind?
She told the dogs to hide from the smog clouds painting the leprosy sky.
Oh, I know we're dirty.
We're putting superheroes on the backs of currency.
I know that something's wrong.
