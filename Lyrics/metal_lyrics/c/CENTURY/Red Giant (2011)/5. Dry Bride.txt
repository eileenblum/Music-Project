Surrounded by animals, you are the wolves outside.
I'm wasted, I'm leaving tracks, I know what you want.
You're too hot to be served alive,
But you can take me off everyone's hands for a little while.
I've been punishing everytone that I love just by fucking sanding there.
Don't you know what it's like to be a phantom to everyone that you'd rather see make it out?

I'll get mine, no matter what, you'll die by only my side.
We'll ge there, just trust me, I want to feel your insides.
Yeah you think you're smart just cause you clawed your way out to the yard.
But goddamn it, didn't you know there are miles between you and the life,
That could have been so much etter without them watching your every move?

This is love, you clean up your mess.

I see them, the deities, I'm fucking desperate out here.
I smell them, the families, I'll bring you all to hell.
I wait and I find so many others to die through.
