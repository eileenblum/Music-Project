Your skull on a network broadcast.
Sweaty palms holding a bloody hall pass.
Show their faces so they keep on watching.
If silence shows up then just talk though it.
Endless echoes in a big old hallway we rot in.
We report and you die.
We even let you speak for us, you worthless piece fo shit.
Just shut up. Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
You don't even know what you're saying.

I can't think while I'm staring at the screen.

Our lifeless trophy, fixated and unaware.
Blinded with pride, becoming the enemy.
While the amputee salutes and the lynch mob ties their noose.
We can't help but drown before the ship even starts to sink.

I can't think while I"m staring at the screen.

The days turn to weeks, maybe we'll find a way.
And I'm not getting sleep.
I'm not fucking sleeping.
I've ground down my teeth till they're dust.
But you need me, I'm telling you this.
We'll burn down our house together. Together.
We're fucked.
Every man for himself.
Our currency is ignorance.
And we've been doing just fine.
We'll keep rewarding ourselves for economic genocide.

I can't think while I'm staring at the screen.

The days turn to weeks.
Maybe we'll find a way.
