I`m slipping away sometimes in memories,
Especially made for you
I`m getting senseless there and nothing more is
real, so unreal
And even though you know my mind
Is not completely torn apart
For me this is the only lie, the perfect lie

I throw away everything I can`t bear
I throw away my life, I don`t care
I grow in every day
into this is the perfect lie

I throw away everything I can`t stand
I lay my life in your hand
into this is the perfect lie

I'm crushing into something sad
Especially made for me
(I'm) hoping the next door will not be open
And please believe me, when I say to you
That I won`t go into the lie
The only lie, the perfect lie

I throw away everything I can`t bear
I throw away my life, I don`t care
I grow in every day
into this is the perfect lie

I throw away everything I can`t stand
I lay my life in your hand
into this is the perfect lie

Something inside
You open the door
Something inside
You open the door
