Sweet and tender on my tongue
I taste your tears of passion and sadness in our love
Together we`ll get lost in there
Together we won`t find out, (that) one of us two was a liar
Let me show you how
Let me show you how
Let me show you how I could believe someone like you

Please can you deceive me, I would know
Please can you release me, I would know
Please can you believe me, I would know
Please can you forgive me now

Bored and tired in my skin
A feeling like i`ll never see you again, no never again
(It) seems, that I have lost this game
(It) seems, that I have not known what everyone should know
I am here somehow
I am here right now
I am here for my love, that is real and I want to know

Please can you deceive me, I would know
Please can you release me, I would know
Please can you believe me, I would know
Please can you forgive me now

Please can you deceive me
