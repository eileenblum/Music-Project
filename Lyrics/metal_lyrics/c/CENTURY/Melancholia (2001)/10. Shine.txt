Fallen lies, between these eyes
I see your crown of dirt
So beautiful you are
So beautiful you are to me

Don`t try to be someone, you are not
And you will shine
Don`t try to free someone, who is lost
And you will shine for me

Even though it`s so hard
For me to bear this love
So magical you are
So magical you are to me

Don`t try to be someone, you are not
And you will shine
Don`t try to free someone, who is lost
And you will shine for me

Don`t try to be someone, you are not
And you will shine

Don`t try to be someone, you are not
And you will shine
Don`t try to free someone, who is lost
And you will shine for me
