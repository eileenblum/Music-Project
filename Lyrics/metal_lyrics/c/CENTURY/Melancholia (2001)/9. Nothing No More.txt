It`s never easy in this routine
To understand, what this could mean
You are the one, who knows my needs
And you will always understand me
You will always understand
It`s never easy to be loved
It`s never easy to hold on

Please love my denial
Don`t touch me tonight
Can`t you feel my heart means nothing to me
Nothing, nomore

It`s never easy to create
To build, what everybody breaks
It`s never time to let things out
For people, who will always doubt
And if it`s time to recognize
You will see it in my eyes

Please love my denial
Don`t touch me tonight
Can`t you feel my heart means nothing to me
Nothing, nomore

It`s never easy in this routine
To understand, what this could mean
It`s never easy to create
To build, what everybody breaks
It`s never easy to be loved
It`s never easy to forget
It`s never easy
