I kiss your lips and see your eyes, I will fall for you

We will meet someday, in this life
For my empty heart and you will show me the way
I never thought, I could fail
In this fine world you should not fail
But I have to walk these unknown ways

I will fall for you my love

I kiss your lips and see your eyes, I will fall for you
I touch your faith and feel your heart, I will fall for you

We will bleed someday, holding back the tears
We should cry, like a disease grown up with me
I never thought I could fall
Like I did for all this love
But now I have to release myself

I will fall for you my love

I kiss your lips and see your eyes, I will fall for you
I touch your faith and feel your heart, I will fall for you

I kiss your lips and see your eyes, I will fall for you
And I touched your faith, so I could see through
your heart

I will fall for you
