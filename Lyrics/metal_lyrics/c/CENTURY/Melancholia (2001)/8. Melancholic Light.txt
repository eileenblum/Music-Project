It`s like I always lived in this melancholic light
It`s like I never said nohing more, than ironic lies
It`s like I never found myself in you to know
It`s like I never felt noone but myself

But now, these two hearts are falling
Into that sacred light, that sacred love forevermore
And there`s no doubt, these two hearts are falling
To go this far, to be whole forevermore

It`s like you always flew over me, so high above
It`s like you never touched, something you adore enough
It`s like you never trust the way we try to go
It`s like you never trust noone but yourself

But now, these two hearts are falling
Into that sacred light, that sacred love forevermore
And there`s no doubt, these two hearts are falling
To go this far, to be whole forevermore

It`s like I always fight with this melancholic lie
It`s like I`m always sad, even when I'm satisfied
It`s like I never find myself in me to know
It`s like I never find nothing in this light
