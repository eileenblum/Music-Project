You can hear my voice, but the words don`t belong to me
You can look in my eyes, but these eyes don`t tell the truth

From now till the end of time
From now till the end

Me, myself and I - can you take my hand and be a part of me
Me, myself and I - can you be my friend and set me free
Me, myself and I

You can break my self-esteem, if you want to break it
And you can always pray for me, do you want to pray?

From now till the end of time
From now till the end

Me, myself and I - can you take my hand and be a part of me
Me, myself and I - can you be my friend and set me free
Me, myself and I

I can hear my breath and the air flowing through my veins
I can feel my hate and the fear surrounding me

From now till the end of time
From now till the end

Me, myself and I - can you take my hand and be a part of me
Me, myself and I - can you be my friend and set me free
Me, myself and I
