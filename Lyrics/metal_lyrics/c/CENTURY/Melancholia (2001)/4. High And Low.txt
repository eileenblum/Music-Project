Let me see you, when you're down
I'll never fall apart
We are strong enough to go
Let me see you, when you're high
(And you're) falling down for me
I'll never be apart from you

So high we can go tonight
So high we can fall inside
So pure we have to grow
For this something "high and low"

Let me see you, when you bleed
Far away from me
So alone now
Let me see you, when you're white / wide
White / wide for me
Tonight

So high we can go tonight
So high we can fall inside
So pure we have to grow
For this something "high and low"

Let me see you, when you drown
Drown in your own sea
The sea, that I expect to be
For the sake of my heaven, that you used to be
There`s nothing more you can feel inside

So high we can go tonight
So high we can fall inside
So pure we have to grow
For this something "high and low"
