Much to long you broke the waves for me
For me you made my heart feel blue and cold
I never thought, that i would understand
I'm infected by you, reflected by you

This is the day, the day I regret all my sins
I never met someone like you
This is the day, the day I regret all my sins
I would take on and on this live for you

I regret

Now it`s time to use my own eyes faithfully
And Believe, that nothings given to conceal
I`m born in this world to know
I love you so, I love you so

This is the day, the day I regret all my sins
I never met someone like you
This is the day, the day I regret all my sins
I would take on and on this live for you

I regret

Can you hear me call your name
Can you see me move for you

This is the day, the day I regret all my sins
I never met someone like you
This is the day, the day I regret all my sins
I would take on and on this live for you
