At last I`ve found you
At last I`ve found you for me

Oh, I dream of that sacred love to have
But I know for sure, that everything I gave was not enough
For me and you, we grow so strong, so much we can resist
But you`re far away, I have to wait for you

Every day and night I feel your love inside
But I can`t find you, no I can`t find you
I cannot find you

Yes, I try to find something I don`t know
I want to stay free, in my heart I`ve always known
Forever, like a game I try to know how hard it is for you
how you feel inside, you will break my heart in two

Every day and night I feel your love inside
But I can`t find you, no I can`t find you
I cannot find you
