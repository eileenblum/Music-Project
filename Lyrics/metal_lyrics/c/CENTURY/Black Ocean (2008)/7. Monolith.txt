Our last chance has come and gone. We have earned our consequence and we stop here.
You're on your own and I embrace the end.
And I will begin again. Say goodbye. Goodbye to the life you hide behind.
We are an ocean of unspeakable secrets. But what we're not supposed to hear always sounds so much better.
Begin again. Give your life and in the end they greet you with cries of hate.
You always asked for it. Now take what you have left and say goodbye.
Goodbye to the life you hide behind.
