How quickly our morality devolves before the fear of pain.
We sell our children off. Now we speak in a different language.
This is where we sleep tonight. We took it all. Drug mules with fear in our stomachs.
A self-induced coma to forget our failure.
And if we could only claw ourselves open, we could fight over our cooling entrails for a moment of warmth.
We're fucking dead. They left us to fend for ourselves.
We mourn their deaths but we overlook what they gave their lives for.
We have nothing. We took it all. We have nothing. We gave it all away. We have everything.
