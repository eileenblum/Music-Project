This is our last day as humans. We've given everything back.
Our cities have been abandoned. Our profound regret dissolves into nothing.
We no longer betray each other. We no longer feel hatred.
Avarice takes on new meaning and in no time no one will remember.
They find us hiding in the forest. They emerge from blackness wearing our skin.
They tear us to pieces and eat us alive. Their hooves break our skulls apart.
Their fur is slicked with our blood. Vegetation consumes ruins of our office buildings.
The forest engulfs our deserted parking structures.
Grass grows up through our highways. Our foregoing lives have been eaten away and in time no one will remember.
