They see through walls. They watch us sleep and it never ends.
It only gets worse and we'll be sorry one day. The page that we never turn past.
The night that lasts for days. And when skin becomes paper we'll know why we couldn't stay here.
What have we done? What have we learned? Our fables become our dedications.
Black ocean. We never saw it coming. Our towns become prisons.
They hunt us down and we our hides to keep their fur dry.
Tie yourself to the stake. Peel your skin back. Become their prey and it never ends.
It only gets worse. And we'll be sorry one day when the lives we build are worth no more than the lives we take.
