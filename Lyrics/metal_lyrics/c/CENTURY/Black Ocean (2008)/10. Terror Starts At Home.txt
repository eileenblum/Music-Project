Our shame writes stories in the earth.
The days go by faster and faster but we'll never know loss. We'll never know selflessness.
We are the same. We become what we tell ourselves we are.
Equated in hatred and loathing. But we throw one last desperate swing at the carcass of civilization.
Our dependence on each other becomes cannibalistic.
We hold each other down and break our limbs off. But we'll never know selflessness.
We'll never know loss. We are the same.
