Come to me, Iâll offer you liberty
Release you from the pain of life
Intoxicated with your last breath
Pleasure to see your bloody guts

Nothing can stay in my way
Your warm blood on my hands
Disfigured face still smiles at me
I sacrifice my dreams to let you free

Severed parts of you
A puzzle in red
