The night is coming, I am prepared
To fight the wicked forces, as told in whispers


Voices command me to kill
Iâll serve them till the end
Thatâs my true purpose
To clean this sinful world

Rotten smelling corpses lie at my place
A collection of homeless and whores
An exhibition of sin that I despise
They must repent, Iâve heard it in my head

Day by day, I release the evil from them
I canât be stopped, a perfect justice of compassion
