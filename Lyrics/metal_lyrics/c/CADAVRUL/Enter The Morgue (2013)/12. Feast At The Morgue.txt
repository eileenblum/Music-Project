We are an insane couple
But whatâs normal these days?
To kill, to slash, to eat
The only way to survive

The hunt has begun
Hungry for human flesh
In search for victims
Fresh human blood

Delivered at morgue
Voluptuous feeding
Constant need to chop
Insidious urge to feed

Itâs never enough
Deep hidden in our senses
The taste of the dying men
Never ending domination
