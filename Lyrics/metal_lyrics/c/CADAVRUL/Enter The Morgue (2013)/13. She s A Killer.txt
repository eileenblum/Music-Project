Need constant male companionship
Possess jealous suspicious nature
Hate unfaithful kind of men
Like to make them disappear

Donât abandon her, sheâll make you decompose
Donât lose interest in her, youâll vanish
Youâll be with her forever
Sheâll stand by you eternally

She loves to sit amidst the coffins
Surrounded by all her lovers
They will never leave her
And they are all hers

Arsenic â this is her poisoned gift to you
She â the black widow loves you to death
