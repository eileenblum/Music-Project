Walking around this wicked world
There is no one to blame, but you
In my mind one thought is lurking
To cleanse this fucking reality

No innocents, all of you are guilty
I wonât stop until I terminate you
The ends justify the means
And my means are terrible

Electricity is now my partner
I love to electrocute you
Your shock is my excitement
As I watch you shaking.
See my chainsaw shredding you
Smell your burning flesh
Feel my dagger on your skin
Hear my bullet near your head
