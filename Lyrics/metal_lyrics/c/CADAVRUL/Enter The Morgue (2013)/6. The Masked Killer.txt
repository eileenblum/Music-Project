Standing tall and calm
Peacefully awaiting
For the next to come
Holding heavy axe

Do your job and die
Iâll do mine and kill
Separate your head
Itâs my only will

Meet the executioner
My mask is all you see
Before I take your life.
Your blood slowly drips.

I can taste your neck
Your pulse excites me
Victim by victim
I become a god
