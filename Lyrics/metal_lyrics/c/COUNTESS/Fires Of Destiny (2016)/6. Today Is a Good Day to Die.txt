With forty legions we march into battle
Amidst rivers of lava and walls of fire
On through a hot, smouldering canyon
An honourable death is all we desire
I hear my brother chanting a battle cry
His eyes bulging with revenge and hate
His blade takes down two dozen men
Many fall on this day of darkened fate

We stand tall in a lake of blood
Our warrior souls do rejoice
Walls of fire and rivers of lava
All we hear is our war god's voice
Today is a good day to die

We stand against overwhelming odds
Our ranks thinning 'til but three remain
To stand against our foe's entire army
But our fallen brothers did not die in vain
Three great warriors from legends of old
Fighting an army a magnificent sight
Taking the high ground the sun in our back
Forcing them to battle against blinding light

We stand tall in a lake of blood
Our warrior souls do rejoice
Three men against an army
All we hear is our war god's voice
Today is a good day to die

Our swords are axes soar like the wind
Enemy heads and limbs fly through the air
Drunk with battle frenzy we are invincible
Bent on destroying our foe in his own lair
After a day and a night of glorious battle
Victory is ours no more enemies to fight
The mountainside is covered with dead
Not a square meter of ground in sight

We stand tall in a lake of blood
Our warrior souls do rejoice
A mountainside covered with dead
All we hear is our war god's voice
Today is a good day to die

Our enemy's body we find by the river
Its waters running red with spilled blood
From his torn carcass we cut out his heart
For us to feast on in honour of our war god
Today is a good day to die
