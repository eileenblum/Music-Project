The walls of the city - are slowly crumbling
Once again Europe's fate - hangs by a thread
For two long months - the siege has now lasted
The garrison weakened - filled with dread

Another bloody chapter will be written
In the endless struggle 'tween east and west
Like so many times in history before
The steel of Europe shall be put to the test
Supplies depleted, in the grip of fatigue
Desperation behind old strong walls
Bonfires suddenly light the night sky
The allies arrive before the city falls

The fires of destiny burn in the night
For freedom, for glory, for Europe we fight
The enemy forces shall meet their fates
They shall not breach the city's gates

Never before were we pushed back so far
Destiny unfolds on this field today
September 12 never forgotten
Ten thousand enemies shall we slay
Like the Spartans millennia before us
We stand against invading eastern hordes
They fight well with all their might
Yet shall fall 'neath our shining swords

The fires of destiny burn in the night
For freedom, for glory, for Europe we fight
The enemy forces shall meet their fates
They shall not breach the city's gates

Infantry and cavalry now attack the enemy
A massive bloody battle that lasts all day
The crescent moon is engulfed by clouds
By nightfall our foe is forced to give way
Our foes destroyed, running for their lives
A victory achieved unheard of before
Many the spoils of this glorious triumph
Centuries ahead shall see much war

The fires of destiny burn in the night
For freedom, for glory, for Europe we fight
The enemy forces shall meet their fates
They shall not breach the city's gates

The fires of destiny burn in the night
For freedom, for glory, for Europe we fight
The enemy forces have met their fates
They did not breach the city's gates
The fires of destiny burn in the night
For freedom, for glory, for Europe we fight
The enemy's expansion brought to a halt
The steel of Europe withstood their assault
