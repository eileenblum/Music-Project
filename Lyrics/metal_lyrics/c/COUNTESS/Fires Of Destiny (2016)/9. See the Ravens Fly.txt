Kinship will be defiled
The sun's beams shall turn black
An age of axe and sword
The tree shall shudder, the giants attack

Harsh it is in the world
The earth turns red with gore
Siblings slay each other
Shields will be cloven, monsters will roar

See the ravens fly
Across the northern sky
Hear the ravens cry
The end is nigh
Hear the loud horn call
Soon the gods shall fall
See the flames devour
Man shall cower

Blood thirst is everywhere
The world's fate is revealed
An age of wind and wolf
The gods know sorrow, soon they must yield

Prophecy will be fulfilled
The heavens engulfed by fire
Ship of the dead sets sail
Earth is in chaos, desperate and dire

See the ravens fly
Across the northern sky
Hear the ravens cry
The end is nigh
Hear the loud horn call
Soon the gods shall fall
See the flames devour
Man shall cower

Do you still seek to know?

Flames shall consume the world
The earth and mountains shake
An age of greed and gloom
The stars will vanish, all bonds will break

The rainbow bridge shall crack
The gods slain by their foes
The earth sinks into the sea
Death and destruction, hear the death throes

See the ravens fly
Across the northern sky
Hear the ravens cry
The end is nigh
Hear the loud horn call
Soon the gods shall fall
See the flames devour
Man shall cower

See the ravens fly
Across the northern sky
Hear the ravens cry
Now the end of time is nigh
