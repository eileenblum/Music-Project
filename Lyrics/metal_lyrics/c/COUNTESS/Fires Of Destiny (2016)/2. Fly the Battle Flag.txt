History is written always by the victors
Behind their walls of lies the truth lies hidden
Yet the past shall not remain forever obscured
Even when the symbols of verity are forbidden

Raise the sacred banner
Remember those who fell
Fly the flag of defiance
Shout out the rebel yell

Fly the flag of honour and pride
Raise the banner for all those who died
Fly the flag of the brave and the bold
Remember the glory and heroes of old

Throughout the bloody pages of mankind's past
Always the brave stood against impossible odds
The Greeks at the gates, the sons of the south
The children of Europe who were true to their gods

Raise the sacred banner
Remember those who fell
Fly the flag of defiance
Shout out the rebel yell

Fly the flag of honour and pride
Raise the banner for all those who died
Fly the flag of the brave and the bold
Remember the glory and heroes of old

Remember the heroes who stood against oppression
Honour their legacy and speak their names with pride
Fly the flag they valiantly carried into battle
They stood against the tyrant and gloriously died

Raise the sacred banner
Remember those who fell
Fly the flag of defiance
Shout out the rebel yell

Fly the flag of honour and pride
Raise the banner for all those who died
Fly the flag of the brave and the bold
Remember the glory and heroes of old
