On the misty battlefield
Many fallen warriors lie
When eerie chants of woe
Slowly emerge from the sky

As the ghostly chanting swells
The chosen slain slowly rise
Leaving flesh and blood behind
While two ravens circle the skies

Hear the choir
Of the Valkyries sing
Hear them call
All the slain to the hall
See the host
Of the Valkyries fly
Watch them bear
All the elect to the sky

The chanting goddesses carry
The chosen fallen from the field
To their father's glorious hall
And again steel they shall wield

Hear the choir
Of the Valkyries sing
Hear them call
All the slain to the hall
See the host
Of the Valkyries fly
Watch them bear
All the elect to the sky
