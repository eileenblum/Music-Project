The evil ritual has been completed
Now the 7 priests' work is done
All shall hail the chosen one

Far away the wolf cries evil
The sons of Abraham doomed to die
Slaves shall serve the end is nigh

Rise of the horned one
Evil shall now prevail
Ascent of the chosen son
All hail the unholy grail

The horned one rises from the sea
All shall worship the scarlet beast
Forces of destruction are released

He reigns over the kings of earth
The second coming never to be
The dragon rises for all to see

Rise of the horned one
Evil shall now prevail
Ascent of the chosen son
All hail the unholy grail

The world takes the mark of the beast
Behind his banner armies assemble
In fear saints and angels tremble

The horned one's revenge is complete
The holy city reduced to dust
Heaven torn apart by wrath and lust

Rise of the horned one
Evil shall now prevail
Ascent of the chosen son
All hail the unholy grail
