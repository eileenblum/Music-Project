Watch them pray, watch them kneel
See them crawl before their worthless god
Hear their slander, hear their lies
Listen to their vile self-righteous cries
Their false god does not hear their pleas
They'll die as they lived, on their knees

May the plague strike the holy
Pestilence and death upon the believers
Devout Worship is of no avail
Their pleas powerless, their prayers fail

Plague upon the pious
Like a fist of wrath from their vengeful god
Plague upon the pious
See the holy drown in a lake of blood

Their skin decays, their bodies spasm
Vomiting blood in excruciating pain
Clerics and believers suffering alike
Powerless against this wrathful strike
Their just fate for adhering to lies
Persisting in ignorance, scorning the wise

May the plague strike the holy
Black death and famine upon the believers
Cries to their god are of no avail
Holy writ is powerless, their lies fail

Plague upon the pious
Like a storm of steel from the ancient ways
Plague upon the pious
See the holy perish in a gruesome blaze

Plague upon the pious
Like a sea of rage from the gods of yore
Plague upon the pious
See the holy decay in agony and gore
Plague upon the pious
Like a force of vengeance from times gone by
Plague upon the pious
See the holy crumble their end is nigh
