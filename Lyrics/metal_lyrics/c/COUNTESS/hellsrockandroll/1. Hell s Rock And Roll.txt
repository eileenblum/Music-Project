The devil sat down
To hear the gospel choir
It made him sick
But kindled a desire
To have His own music
Hymns sung to Him
Music for the dark
Songs of sin

So the devil inspired
Some long-haired men
To dress in black
And play on ten
With razor guitars
And thundering bass
With pounding drums
And screams like crazed

[Chorus:]
Heavy Metal - Hell's rock &amp; roll
Black Metal - Hell's rock &amp; roll
Heavy Metal - Hell's rock &amp; roll
Black Metal - Hell's rock &amp; roll

Now the devil sits down
To hear the metal band
It makes Him smile
Evil made a stand
So we play on
Possessed by Hell
We just can't stop
It's the metal spell

[Chorus]
