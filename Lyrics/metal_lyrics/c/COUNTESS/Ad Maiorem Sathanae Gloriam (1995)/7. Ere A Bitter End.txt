Created by an insane god
For only the purpose of worship
He was the first to develop mind
And in his heart grew rebellion

He loathed his kin as they do as they're told
His own sacrifice is half-hearted
And so his offerings were rejected by God
In favour of his feebler brother
Anger burned hot and strong was his fist
He killed with one single effort
His own flesh now cold he left to the beasts
So came murder upon mankind

"Cain, where is thy brother?"
Asked by God he was
So he did lie to him
And did commit another sin
Marked for eternity he was

The sign of Cain branded on his forehead
Cast out into the void he was
His shining blue eyes became the murderer's sign
Banished forever to roam the earth
Immortality was granted to him
To give time to think about his sins
As wives he took his sisters sinfully
So his seed is still upon mankind

For killing in rage
He is punished to live
Cast out by his kin
He leads a life of sin
A wolf among sheep he is

Among us he's still though his vision has changed
A life is but a flicker of a candle
For one like him the joys of life turn dim
As aeons repeat over and over
The terror of seeing loved ones age and die
Is familiar to him, he already lives in Hell
But stubbornly he fights to forever stay alive
Denying the torments of God's verdict

So he's stalking the ages
Forever he'll be there
Threatening fate
With bloodsmeared fist
A lifestyle dictated by his nature
