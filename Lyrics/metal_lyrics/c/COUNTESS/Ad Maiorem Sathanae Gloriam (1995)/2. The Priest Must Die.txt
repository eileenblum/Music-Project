When the moon is full oh let him cry
Kill the priest, the priest must die
Smash his face, break his bones
Let morbid laughter drown his moans

Slave of lies, puppet of God
Eat his heart, drink his blood
Burning hate will conquer love
See the wolf rip to shreds the dove

When the moon is full oh let him cry
Kill the priest, the priest must die
Smash his face, break his bones
Let morbid laughter drown his moans
