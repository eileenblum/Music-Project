Into the noblest blood the Master's seed was sown
Married to gain Hungary's throne
Evil's incarnation, supreme in her day
Her deeds beyond words to her people's dismay
More than six times a hundred maidens fair
Lured into the countess' castle unaware
Dark lady of Hungary obsessed by blood
The virgins trapped in Hell cries in vain to God

Shed your blood oh virgins pure
To feed the wrath of Satan's whore
You've been chosen to let your blood
To make the mistress live for evermore
Gallons of blood she took for vampiric abuse
And for years nobody dared to accuse
But too many virgins vanished on her road to despair
Butchered by cruel servants in the countess' lair
Parents wailing while their daughters disappear
Her people for ages dwelt in terror and fear
Until at last she was caught and tried
Convicted and lacking her bloody diet she died

Cut off the source of virgins pure
Who fed the wrath of Satan's whore
Yet deep within her castle's endless halls
Linger still Erzsï¿½bet's desperate calls
