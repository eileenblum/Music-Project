Once again the hour draws nigh
The night of the chosen has come
Our hopes and expectations burn high
Will we succeed this time?

The return of our beloved Master
Is what we desire so much
To lead us His children in most unholy reign
And the weakling shalt be trembled in the dust

Sheltered under the claw
We're gathered to summon our lord
In evil praise we sin
For the return of the Horned

Our efforts are answered at last
The ground opens to spew forth
Surrounded by sulphuric flames
From the abyss He doth rise

Now His evil reign unfolds
As foretold by visions ages old
Upon His children His spell He doth cast
Forever in indulgence we shalt live

Sheltered under the claw
We bathe in the presence of our lord
In evil praise we sing
The gospel of the Horned
