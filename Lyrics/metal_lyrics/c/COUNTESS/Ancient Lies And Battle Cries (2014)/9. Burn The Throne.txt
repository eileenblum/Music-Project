Skies darken above the throne
Fires of rebellion burn in the night
Behind his walls the monarch trembles
Shining steel to crush 'divine right'

Thunder roars and lightning strikes
Freedom calls the king must die
His banners to burn before the morn
In a blazing storm revenge is nigh

The castle walls are coming down
The king today will lose his crown
With spite his illicit rule we spurn
On this night the throne we burn

The last of a long line of usurpers
Finally shall meet with his just fate
The castle soon reduced to rubble
When legions of steel storm the gate

The monarch's reign now ends in blood
His birthright void, his minions slain
The castle burns, the crown is crushed
Our swords the royal bloodline's bane

The castle walls are coming down
The king today will lose his crown
With spite his illicit rule we spurn
On this night the throne we burn
