Relate to me tales of ages past
Show me the future long gone by
Speak to me of history yet to be
Show me the past you did foresee

Show me the past, the ways of old
Show me the shining walls of gold
Show me the glory of days gone by
Show me the gods beneath the sky
Show me the sacred bloodied rites
Show me the holy burning nights
Show me the king, sword and shrine
Show me the hallowed cycle of nine

A journey through the veils of time
In magic mist ancient bells chime
Winds of destiny, clouds of fate
Drifting through an ethereal gate
Awakening amidst a storm of woe
Walking fields of bloodied snow
Amongst my kin who came before
Standing tall at the dawn of war
From far we journey to the shrine
The ravens' flight a divine sign
Ten thousand warriors side by side
With my forebears proudly I stride

Gathered 'neath the sacred northern sky
Winter shall yield spring is nigh
Torches blaze, sacrificial blood flows
Through the trees the wild wind blows
Songs are sung and prayers are said
To our gods so great loyalty is pled
Our glorious ancestors we praise
Yet soon shall perish our olden ways

From the south the shadow draws near
The ways of Rome shall soon be here
The age of the cross is upon our land
No matter how brave and strong we stand
Houses of the foreign god shall rise
To befoul our once proud pagan skies
The disgrace of baptism upon our kin
The chains of the lie, of guilt and sin

Yet not all is lost in veils of time
When history fades to myth and rhyme
Only the temple's ashes may remain
Gods of the blood can never be slain
I see the future, the ways of old
I see the shining walls of gold
I see the glory of days to be
I see the past you did foresee

What once was, shall be once more
A golden dawn for the gods of yore
