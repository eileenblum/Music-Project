We raise our horns to our gods
In the storm eight hooves we hear
Time has come for our foes to fear
Runes are cast and steel is forged
Sigils of might woven into our steel
Before our gods the enemy shall kneel

By the hammer of the thunder god
By the sacred blood in our veins
By the wisdom of the High One
By the iron will to break our chains

Holy fire shall consume the lies
Hear our ancient battle cries
For our gods we fight and bleed
We shall crush Abraham's creed

For ages our faith was oppressed
Yet always the runes did remain
And now shall end Jehovah's reign
United behind the banner of the gods
Our hearts ablaze with pagan pride
Through fire and blood we shall ride

By the hammer of the thunder god
By the sacred blood in our veins
By the wisdom of the High One
By the iron will to break our chains

The mighty hammer cracks the sky
Beneath our blades our enemies die
Victory shall be ours this day
For glory to our gods we pray

Today we answer All-Father's call
His One Eye in the sky does glow
Today blood will flow in the snow
Wolves are howling the holy names
Our divine steel our enemies' fate
They shall bow to our gods so great

By the hammer of the thunder god
By the sacred blood in our veins
By the wisdom of the High One
By the iron will to break our chains

Down upon us two ravens look
As we slay the minions of the book
Our temples we shall raise once more
For the glory of the gods of yore
