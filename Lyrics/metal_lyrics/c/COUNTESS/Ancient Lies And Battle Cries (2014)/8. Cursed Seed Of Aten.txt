Beneath the blazing desert sun
A powerful king lost his mind
Betrayed his kindred's ancient gods
Unleashed a curse upon mankind

The gods and goddesses forsaken
Shrines destroyed, temples defaced
On the mad pharaoh's road to ruin
Statues of the gods laid to waste

One creed, one god, one lie
Prophets of the curse we shall defy

The first of many prophets false
Creator of the one god curse
From history he was eradicated
Destroyed was his faith perverse

Yet the seed of the lie was sown
The curse to haunt mankind for ages
From the east spread over the earth
Cataclysm staining history's pages

One creed, one god, one lie
False prophets face our battle cry

Almost forgotten the gods of mankind
We shall revel in their divine return
The one god lie shall forever perish
Soon all the houses of Aten shall burn

One creed, one god, one lie
Annihilation of the curse is nigh

The curse shall fall
