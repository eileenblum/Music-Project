They are not omnipotent, they are not infallible
Yet they are immortal
They are not unchangeable, they are not judgemental
They are the gods
Many gods there are, in infinite diversity
In countless realities
My life they guide, my heart they sustain
My soul they illuminate

Glory to the gods

Gods of war, they bless our steel
They give us battle
Gods of lust, they bless our loins
They give us desire
Gods of art, they bless our minds
They give us inspiration
Gods of death, they bless our passing
They give us life

Glory to the gods

The gods are us as we are them
And all is one in the end
As we evolve, so do the gods
And together we grow
Beyond morality, beyond rigidity
The truth we will find
And on our quest, our relentless pursuit
The gods are with us

Glory to the gods
