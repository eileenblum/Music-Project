Heavy metal was forged by the gods
With hammer and anvil and fire and ice
Pure and majestic, a glorious sound
It shook the earth and cracked the skies

They saw that it was good
They saw that it was right
By the hammer and by blood
We worship the gods of metal tonight

Heavy metal was forged by the gods
In the holy forge of celestial steel
Nothing can oppose its might
Before the metal altar all shall kneel

They made it loud and fierce
They made it strong and proud
By the hammer and by blood
The war cry of heavy metal we shout

Pray for the cult
Recite the metal creed
Pray for the cult
The oath of steel is all we need

I swear allegiance to true metal
To fight the false with the power of steel
Forever true to the gods of metal
To no man shall ever I kneel

Heavy metal was forged by the gods
Through holy magic by sacred seal
Onto us the torch of metal they passed
Ghosts of leather soldiers of steel

They gave us the might of metal
They gave us the power and pride
By the hammer and by blood
For the glory of the cult we ride

Pray for the cult
Recite the metal creed
Pray for the cult
The oath of steel is all we need
