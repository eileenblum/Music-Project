The gods of old where have they gone
Since our folk their worship forsook
Their temples and statues destroyed
Their wisdom replaced by lies of the book
No longer did the gods their wisdom provide
They may be sleeping they cannot have died

Hear the call of the ancient pantheon
Listen to the cry of the gods of yore
From the past their voices sound
Calling for a holy war

Have the gods moved on beyond the stars
Are they hiding in some desolate abode?
Did they leave us when we abandoned them?
To fend for ourselves on a desolate road
No longer their blessing do we receive
Yet I do not believe they did forever leave

Hear the call of the ancient pantheon
Listen to the cry of the gods of yore
From the past their voices sound
Calling for a holy war

Hear the cry of the gods of times past
Listen to their call for a holy war
We shall fight for their return
Let the holy fire burn

The gods of old shall return to their kin
When again to the true gods shall we pray
Their temples and statues are resurrected
Never again their folk to be led astray
For the pantheon of old we fight a holy war
To restore our gods and revive ancient lore

Hear the call of the ancient pantheon
Listen to the cry of the gods of yore
From the past their voices sound
Calling for a holy war
