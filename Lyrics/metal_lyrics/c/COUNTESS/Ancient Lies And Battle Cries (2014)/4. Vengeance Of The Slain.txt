Bells are tolling when the past is calling
The dead shall rise on this dark winter night
Spells are broken when the runes are spoken
Those once forgotten now return to fight

Through thunder, mist, wind and rain
The dead return to fight again
Resurrected to be the vile foe's bane
This is the vengeance of the slain

The hammer cracks and the thunder rolls
Slaves of the cross are trembling in fear
Once dead warriors ride forth from beyond
After centuries of woe retribution is here

Through thunder, mist, wind and rain
The dead return to fight again
Resurrected to be the vile foe's bane
This is the vengeance of the slain

Again the warriors heed the wanderer's call
The betrayal of kings to be avenged by steel
Finally revenge to be exacted on the enemy
Nevermore our folk to a false god shall kneel

Through thunder, mist, wind and rain
The dead return to fight again
Resurrected to be the vile foe's bane
This is the vengeance of the slain
