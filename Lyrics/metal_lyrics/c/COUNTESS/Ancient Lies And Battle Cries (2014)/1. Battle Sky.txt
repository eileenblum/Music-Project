Swords are silent, the battle has been fought
The wind still is raging, but arrows no longer fly
Corpses cover the field, so many warriors fell
Ghastly goddesses now descend from the sky

Across the clouds Valkyries ride
Mounted on wolves, in the sky
Choosing the slain, fallen heroes
To carry them to the hall up high

Shield maidens weave the web of war
Ordaining the clash of sword and spear
Corpses of kings, bodies of champions
The horn of war they all did hear

The goddesses bear the brave dead
From the fields of blood and woe
Their bravery will now be rewarded
To the most splendid hall they do go

Above the field the Valkyries fly
Riding high
'Neath the fallen heroes lie
Riding high
Above the field the Valkyries fly
Riding high
'Neath the chosen warriors lie
Riding through the

Battle sky

Across the clouds Valkyries ride
Armed with spears and shields of gold
Through strong winds and magic mist
A magnificent sight to behold

Blood of the slain has reddened the field
So many brave warriors fell on this day
When arrows flew and swords did clash
And now the Valkyries carry them away

Gruesome beings yet ghostly beautiful
They fly from the field into the battle sky
The warriors slain will feast in Odin's hall
Across the rainbow bridge way up high

Above the field the Valkyries fly
Riding high
'Neath the fallen heroes lie
Riding high
Above the field the Valkyries fly
Riding high
'Neath the chosen warriors lie
Riding through the

Battle Sky
