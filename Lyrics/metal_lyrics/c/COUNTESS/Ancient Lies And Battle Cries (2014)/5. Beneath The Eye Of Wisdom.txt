Upon the windswept tree hung He
Nine nights and nine whole days
To Himself given by His spear
Down infinite depths did he gaze
Upon the tree with roots unknown
Knowledge of the runes did He learn
Screaming loud He seized the staves
And from the depths did return

Beneath the eye of wisdom
The might of the runes strengthens our souls
Beneath the eye of wisdom
All-Father's knowledge guides us to our goals

Beneath one of the great treeâs roots
To wisdom's well He made His way
For a drought from the sacred source
With one of His eyes he had to pay
He drank much knowledge from the well
Into the hallowed water sunk His eye
Still way up high His one eye glows
And looks upon us from the sky

Beneath the eye of wisdom
We shall return to the glorious ways of yore
Beneath the eye of wisdom
Ancient powers awake when we wage a holy war

Beneath the eye of wisdom
Age-old words of great power are spoken out loud
Beneath the eye of wisdom
Behind the banner of the gods we ride strong and proud
