In deepest Night, when Sleep does flee
And utter Dark does draw its Weave,
It chokes my Breath, crams the Heart in my Breast;
Squats on my Body like a hot Succubus!
When in burning Pain I roll and turn
And fearless I know my last Hour has come... The Nightwind blows...

The Candles cease, I let the Nightwind in,
Let its cold Breeze cool my heated Skin;
My tortured Soul lies embraced in its Arms...
Carry me to foreign Lands! Show me the Unseen!
On Paths untread - A secret to all save you and the Stars.
And may Death be the End, I beseech not to remain when the Nightwind blows...

Then I let the Nightwind carry me away,
My crippled Soul on your Wings so black!
Gliding onto you, I murmur through Shades,
Whispering gently my Thoughts desperate...
Learn the Wisdom of Darkness, perceive the Secrets of the Night;
Places hidden and Ages lost I roam where only Nightwinds rule...

Like Sand o'er empty Graves I drift
Onwards through endless Night and Mist;
To Temples of Gods long forgotten I fly,
Mystical places that demand human Blood...
(And) Where once Maidens were screaming in Vain,
Now Monuments are crumbled to Dust that upon the Nightwind floats...

Along the Weaves through the Void of a Dream
I drift towards Death - or so does it seem...
I wander Caves lit by fierce Dragonfire,
The Bond to Life grows diffuse and lighter...
I smell colours! I see Emotion, I'm but so alive!
Never I wish to wake nor return from the Realm where only the Nightwind rules...
