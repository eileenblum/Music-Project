Countess playing on his stereo
Cold beer in hand he's good to go
The true metal life he is leading
Breaking the law forever speeding
Always overtaking on the right
Wimps and posers filled with fright
Thousands of tickets fill his trunk
He doesn't care he's much too drunk

Tyrant of the motorway

Like a maniac bouncing on his wheel
Banging to the tones of metal and steel
His speakers produce an awesome sound
The wheels of his car leaving the ground
Chewing endlessly on candybars
While crashing into other cars
The product of Bavarian cooking
He ain't fat just healthy-looking

Tyrant of the motorway

Inviting little girls to take a ride
On the back seat they'll spend the night
Perverted and sick he doesn't like it clean
The Bavarian barbarian is rough and mean
Always overtaking on the right
Wimps and posers filled with fright
Thousands of tickets fill his trunk
He doesn't care he's much too drunk

Tyrant of the motorway
