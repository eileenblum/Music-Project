Skill of Dwarves - Wisdom of Elves - Dread of Men
Skill of Dwarves - Wisdom of Elves - Doom of Men...

Hear now, ye Children, the Tale I sing, of Steel forged by Witchcraft so foul.
Destined to tip the Balance of Fate and to bring Man's World to an end...
Powers so much older than Man bound together Material unfit;
Three great Blades thus they brought to be, their Destiny carved in Human Skin.

A mysterious Book contains the Key; The Riddle is clear to those who may read,
Yet Knowledge means Horror unbearable and more than one chose to die...
Three warriors of Man with Powers so great are chosen to wield the Steel of Wrath.
To Glory or Ruin, who is to tell, once the Threads of Fate are woven...?

After two Years of Snowstorms and Frost the Time of the Meeting draws nigh;
Bloodred the Star of the Conqueror burns its Message onto the Skies!
Behold now the desperate Host of Man, struggling to face the Horror of old...
Sacrifice burnt, the Blades are drawn; Who's to live and to tell...
