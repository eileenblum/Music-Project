On black death I ride
The sword of hate I wield
In Satan's name I stride
On Armageddon's battlefield

Satan's Child I am
Chaos horde I lead
Towards eternal victory
On Armageddon's battlefield

Satanic master calls
Infernal steel I raise
Infernal death you die
On Armageddon's Battlefield

By the powers of Hell I shall challenge your God
He shall be fed to the Hounds of Hell
Upon his throne I shall masturbate in lust
While his son is nailed to the cross once again
On Mary the Whore shall indulge my hordes
By the flames of Hellfire, so mode it be!

Winged warriors helplessly
Try save god's throne of gold
Aid the nailed - they fly and fry
On Armageddon's battlefield

On black death I ride
Through Heaven's gate I crush
Satanic plague I spread
On Armageddon's Battlefield

Jewish god tastes my steel
Aeons it takes to die
Hell's wrath does prevail
On Armageddon's Battlefield

By the powers of Hell I crushed your god
His corpse is now fed to the hounds
Upon his throne now I masturbate
As his son is nailed to the cross once again
On Mary the Whore Hell's hordes have their fun
By the flames of Hellfire, so it is done!
