In the dark I feel at home
It clings to me like a second skin
In my pain my glory lies
It comforts me like an evil sin
In misery I feel secure
It soothes my soul that feels so old
In despair I am myself
It's who I am: lost and cold

Like the proud angel who fell
And found his glory in the depths of Hell
Like the sinner who lived his desire
And found his glory in eternal fire
Like the warrior who in battle was slain
And found his glory in eternal fame
Like the heretic who died in fire
And found his glory on his funeral pyre

True victory can only be won within your own heart
True freedom can only be found within your own soul
True wisdom can only be gained within your own mind
True glory can only be achieved through your own pain

Do not hope to vanquish your foes
When you have not yet conquered yourself
Do not hope to be free from others
When you are still bound by your own chains
Do not hope to see what lies hidden
When you are not even seeing yourself
Do not hope to bathe in glory
When you have never been through pain
