Catharine de Medici a truly evil woman
Mistress of Italy's renaissance history
After the death of her husband Henry II
Regent of France in a time of turmoil

Calvinism's thought spreading like a plague
The sick teachings of true Christianity
Attacking the evil Catholic church
And even challenging the monarchy

In the 1550's the burnings began
Many Huguenots already killed by Henry
But after his death they kept on coming
Catherine had to take radical action

[Chorus:]
A wedding drenched in blood
A cruel and brutal massacre
Thousands of Huguenots dead
Hail to the evil Catherine

In Paris they all came together
Many important Huguenot leaders
To celebrate Navarre's wedding
But their feast became a massacre

On the day of Saint Bartholomew
Wedding guests dragged from their beds
All slaughtered unceremoniously
A heavy blow to the Huguenot party

[Chorus]
