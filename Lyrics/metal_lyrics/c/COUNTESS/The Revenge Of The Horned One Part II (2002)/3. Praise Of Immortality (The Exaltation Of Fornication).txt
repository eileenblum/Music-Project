Carnal lust is burning in my soul
All morality I deny depraved I truly am
Fornication, copulation, masturbation
I writhe in filth and rejoice in sin

I want the flesh of horny bitches
I fuck the whores and rape the sluts
Women exist only to please me
To spread their legs and drink my semen

[Chorus:]
Praise of immorality
The exaltation of fornication
Praise of immorality
The utter glory of perversion

I sin for the Master's glory
Disgraceful deeds to worship Him
Fuck for pleasure not procreation
I follow all my lowest instincts

Ethical behaviour is alien to me
I only live to spill my seed
Virtue I deny, vice I embrace
Evil fucking, fucking evil

[Chorus]
