Behold the Wrath of my blazing Steel forged to cleanse you of your life!
Soon I'll feast on your puny Soul, a reward for Centuries I strove...
Aeons passed, and long forgotten were your Crimes - or so you thought;
Now you gaze at my Fist of Vengeance, Hope for Salvation brought to Naught...

Feel the Bite of my burning Hate ripping through your very Life;
Your prayers to your alien God are but a trifle late - haha!
Now, you little Christian Worm! Behold the Glory of Hell!!
You are about to enter my Lair, a Victim of Lord Satan's Spell...

Behold the Horror of your own little Hell, the Stake is piled really high;
For taking Lives of those who were dear your poor lost mortal Soul shall fry!!
Wailing and pleading won't help a bit, yet I feast on your despairing Cries!
Life Eternal turned on you somehow and in vain your Saviour died...

Of Torment unknown your are to learn, in Pain you'll remember once things really start!
Your terrified Grimace reflects in my Steel, my black Blood boils in satanic Lust;
Your guts spilled down the Altar Stairs, a Feast for the Hounds of Hell;
A Sacrifice to my Master you are, the dread Lord of this Realm...
