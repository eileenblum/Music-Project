Hey, you wanker, IÂ´m the Filth Machine
I like it rough, I donÂ´t play it clean
But thatÂ´s the way of HellÂ´s Rock &amp; Roll
Exist only to sin, to heed the MasterÂ´s call

[Bridge:]
Boozed up every night, bitches everywhere
Sleeping through the day, I really donÂ´t care

[Chorus:]
IÂ´m the Goddamn Filth Machine, IÂ´m gonna get your bitch
IÂ´m the Goddamn Filth Machine, IÂ´m gonna eat the rich
IÂ´m the Goddamn Filth Machine, always fuckinÂ´ drunk
IÂ´m the Goddamn Filth Machine, smelling like a skunk

I have never worked a single day in my life
I rather stay home and beat my wife
IÂ´m the bastard mother warned her about
Not quite quiet, I scream and shout!

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

IÂ´m a total narcissist and fuckinÂ´ ugly too
My socks are so filthy they could kill you
I was born like this itÂ´s the way IÂ´ve always been
But I donÂ´t care Â´cos IÂ´m the Filth Machine

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
