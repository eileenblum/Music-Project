Standing before the altar
I raise the sacred dagger
Approaching the naked virgin
Tonight IÂ´ll be reborn
I seek not ChristÂ´s salvation
Forsake all hope of redemption
I choose to serve the Master
Tonight IÂ´ll be reborn

I killed the innocent virgin
Her warm blood on my hands
I give my soul to the Master
Tonight I have been reborn
I feel the wrath within me
HellÂ´s hate burns in my soul
I wield the powers of darkness
Tonight IÂ´ve been reborn

[Chorus:]
A sacrifice in darkness
A pledge to the King of Hell
Bathing in innocent blood
IÂ´m born again in sin

I live to please the Master
I commit sin after sin
I revel in my wicked ways
I was born again in sin
I indulge in lechery, usury
Gluttony, anger, sloth
Pride and avarice, deadly sins
I was born again in sin

[Chorus]
