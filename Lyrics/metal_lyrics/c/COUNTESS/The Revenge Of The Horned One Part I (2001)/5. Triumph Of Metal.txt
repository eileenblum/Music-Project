The sound of 'The Gospel' offended the meek
'The Return' followed suit to lash at the weak
The ignorant insulted again by 'Ad Maiorem'
'The Book' yet another fist in the trendies' face

True warriors 'Kneel Before The MasterÂ´s Throne'
Howling along when 'The Wolf Cries Evil'
We His children are 'Sheltered Under The Claw'
We fly through the night 'On The Wings Of Azazel'

[Chorus:]
The triumph of metal
The glory of steel
The triumph of metal
To no man we kneel

Tonight metal, power and might will prevail
Hear power and steel call the chosen
Wimps are wailing and crying out in pain
The warriors of metal are on the rise again

Metal the holy sound of the strong and the pure
The glorious music of the MasterÂ´s race
GodÂ´s chosen are covering their ears in vain
The power of metal and might cannot be denied

[Chorus]

Heads are banging and beer is flowing free
The strong are indulging in sin forever more
Metal and steel continue to fill the air
Cries of power and glory ring through the night

True metal warriors glory in obscurity
Good reviews are like insults to us
Metal was made for the masses to hate
Only the chosen should revel in sin

[Chorus]
