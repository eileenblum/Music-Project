We are all the Master's children
Hard as iron, strong as steel
We donÂ´t worship the false prophet
To no mortal man we kneel
Working for the MasterÂ´s glory
Praying for the AntichristÂ´s birth
Questioning all that is not questioned
Our mission to create Hell on earth

Hell on earth

We are all the MasterÂ´s children
For us there is no other way
But to obey His every command
So in darkness we do pray:
"Our Father, Who art in Hell
Hallowed be Thy Name
Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done
On earth as it is in Hell"

[Chorus:]
On earth as it is in Hell

Hell on earth

We are all the MasterÂ´s children
Standing proud with banners high
Where in obedience others bow
We donÂ´t follow but ask "why?"
One day our time will come
When mediocrity is no longer law
When pride no longer is a sin
And people see what they never saw

[Chorus]
