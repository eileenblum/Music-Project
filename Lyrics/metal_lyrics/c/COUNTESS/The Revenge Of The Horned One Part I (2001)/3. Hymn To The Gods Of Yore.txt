Gods of yore I hear your voice
ItÂ´s singing in my blood
Wolves are howling your holy song
I see your faces in the stars

Gods of yore I worship you
Your images float my mind
Your temples will surely rise again
Your likeness recast in stone

Gods of yore I draw your signs
Sigils of power and might
Dormant forces awake again
Ancient steel is forged anew

Gods of yore I sing your praise
Your names ring through the air
Abandoning their modern ways
Your people turn back to you

Gods of yore I drink to you
The mead flows in your name
Ancient fires are lit again
Again we sacrifice to you

Gods of yore IÂ´ll come to you
Your dwellings in the sky
I hail the true gods of my race
Forever I am yours
