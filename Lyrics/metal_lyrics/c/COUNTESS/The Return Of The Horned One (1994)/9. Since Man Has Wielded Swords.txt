Since man has wielded swords
Man has gone to war
Since man acquired speech
He has lied for evermore
Since Abel was struck by Cain
His brother man has slain
Since man has wielded swords
Man has battled for power and fame
Since man acquired fire
He has set the world aflame
Since Eve led Adam to sin
Man's dark desires will always win
