Straying through the dark forest
The night so black, the mist so cold
A lonely path to destiny
Feel Evil's desperate hold
Feel the presence of the wolf
As the hunter roams the silent woods
A fire burns, close yet so far away
Men they dance in robes and hoods
And the wolf cries... evil
The wolf cries evil

A thick blanket of fog covers all
Feel the darkness all around
Breathe the evil, be the darkness
Forever and ever and ever Hellbound
Become one with all darkness and evil
Join the pack, howl in the night
Hail the Master for all eternity
No more fear, no more fright
And the wolf cries... evil
The wolf cries evil
