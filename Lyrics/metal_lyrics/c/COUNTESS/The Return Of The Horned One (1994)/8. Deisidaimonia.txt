Tread the Path of Destiny
Walk under the Sign
Guided by the light of Set
Will ever the moon shine?

Eternal desert lies ahead
The smile of Azazel
Whisper an ancient incantation
Cast an unholy spell

Descend into the darkest chamber
Celebrations of sin
Worship of Evil so much older
Than Prometheus' kin

Weird reality surrounds the chosen
Deep in Midgard's womb
Taste the smell of absurdity
In this infernal tomb

Manifestation on the altar
Pray to eternal truth
Sacrifice through fear and lust
Virgin flesh so smooth

Awake in forest of nowhere
Symphony through the haze
Innocent blood drowning your soul
The skyline is ablaze
