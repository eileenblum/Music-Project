Mountains engulfed by darkness
Campfires blazing in the night
Ten thousand warriors gathered
The fires their only light

Now let the sacrificial blood flow
To appease the war gods
A great battle is at hand
We must fight against the odds

The enemy awaits us
Ahead lies victory or death
Steel cuts through flesh
Breathe your last breath
Blood flows everywhere
The woods are turning red
Spears fly and hammers clash
My sword severs your head

Force of life and omen of death
Blood colours my sword red
We find glory on this battlefield
Where so many fought and bled
Once every man must die
If not by the spear by old age
Worthy are only honour and pride
So on the battlefield I rage
