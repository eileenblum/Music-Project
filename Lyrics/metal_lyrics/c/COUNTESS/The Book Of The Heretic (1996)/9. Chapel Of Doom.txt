A morbid organ fills the chapel of doom
With horrible sounds, litanies of gloom
Oh! Lady of darkness, the Goat is so near
Are you in trance, or filled with fear?
Are you a victim of an unspeakable rite
Or a black priestess sacrificing at night
Maybe you are trapped within a spell
Who will ever know, who will ever tell?

[Chorus:]
Where must I travel? Where must I go?
To find your soul, or maybe my own?
Will I find you where eagles fly?
Or to find you, must I die?

Will you fly on the first night of May
To the Harz or even further away?
Will I ever be able to set you free
Or will you be damned eternally?
Caught in a spell outside my life
I beg of thee, Master, let her be my wife!
The horns, the sign, the blood, the tears
We all walk in shadows of ancient fears

[Chorus]
