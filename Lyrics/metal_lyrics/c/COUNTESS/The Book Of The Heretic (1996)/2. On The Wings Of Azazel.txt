Those who follow the 'celestial light'
Enslave their souls to illusions
Self-denial fed by holy fright
Righteous compulsion where Yahweh reigns
False prophets preach ancient fears
Will thy soul be free from chains?

[Chorus:]
On the wings of Azazel
Those who fear shall perish
Across dimensional boundaries
Into the dark reality

Those who embrace the 'mournful gloom'
Dare to see beyond false prophecies
In Lilith's night shine shrines of doom
Walk in the shadow of the Goat
Enter the fire of Moloch's empire
Join the chosen, swear the oath

[Chorus]
