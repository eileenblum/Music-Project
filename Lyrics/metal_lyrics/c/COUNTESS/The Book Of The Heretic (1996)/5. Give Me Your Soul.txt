Welcome to my lair, darling
I hope you do enjoy the view
You will stay for a while, won't you?
How about eternity, for a start?
Give me your soul

Welcome to my chambers, darling
Yes, it's cold in here, in absence of God
But don't be afraid, it's not just your flesh I want
And don't you think I'm after your blood

Give me your soul

Welcome to my Hell, darling
Yes, I do want your flesh
And yes, I will drink your blood
But most of all I crave your soul

Give me your soul
