I burn his image and mock his words
I tread on his cross and spit in his face
I insult his father and slay his believers
I worship his adversary and loathe his love
'cos I live my life in hate of Christ
And I will die in hate of Christ
And I will burn in hate of Christ

In hate of Christ

I curse his gospels and laugh at his pain
I burn his churches and piss on his saints
I torture his followers and deny his birth
I break his commandments and indulge in sin
'cos I live my life in hate of Christ
And I will die in hate of Christ
And I will burn in hate of Christ

In hate of Christ
