At last existence to be seen
As it has always been
Life and death always an illusion
The end brings only more confusion
Chaos, the truthful answer why
And even chaos itself a lie
Good is evil, black is white
The dark is light, the day is night
The end brings no escape
A new beginning will take shape
Impossible to annihilate eternity
Slaves to existence we'll always be
