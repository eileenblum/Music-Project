Amidst the great deeds of Xerxes and his Greek foes
All the valour of the second of the Persian wars
Stands out a single battle as the most heroic
The defence of a mountain pass by a Spartan force

A strategic error left several hundred Spartan men
Surrounded by an overwhelming Persian might
For two days they managed to hold on to the pass
Led by king Leonidas to the last man they did fight

Thermopylae [4x]

The Spartans were exceptional in their courage
Whatever number their foe they would not retreat
With hearts of steel and incredible battle prowess
They managed to achieve such an amazing feat

Even though the Spartans lost this great battle
Time was gained for the Greek armies and fleet
The progress of the vast Persian army was halted
And the Greeks were prepared their foe to meet

Thermopylae [4x]

At Salamis the Persian fleet was largely sunk
And at Plataea the Greek army proved the best
It was the beginning of the empire's downfall
Establishing the Greek dominance of the west
