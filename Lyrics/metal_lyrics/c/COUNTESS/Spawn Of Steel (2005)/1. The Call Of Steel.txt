Black winds are blowing the hammer is calling
'Neath power and might wimps and posers are falling
Warriors ride
Live to fight
The gods of metal are smiling upon us this night
Wielding our proud steel we know we are right
Blackened hate
Our holy fate
Brothers of metal are heeding the call of steel
Going to war to fight for metal that's real
Metal might
Shining bright
Sons of the hammer today we make our stand
Soldiers of steel the strongest in all the land
Fire and ice
Ancient cries

[Chorus:]
The call of steel
Heavy metal zeal
Wolves in the night
Join the holy fight

Lightning strikes when metal's warriors chant
The glory of steel and might is now at hand
Hammers fall
Heed the call
The full moon's light is calling us to ride to war
With fire and metal forge anew the magic of yore
Darkened skies
No more lies
Now the time has come to set the world alight
Spawn of steel and fire we shall rule the night
Honour bound
Glory found
The ecstasy of battle takes us up into the sky
Death or glory today might be a fine day to die
Iron and fire
Metal desire

[Chorus]

Black winds are blowing the hammer is calling
'Neath power and might wimps and posers are falling
Metal might
Shining bright
The gods of metal are smiling upon us this night
Wielding our proud steel we know we are right
Fire and ice
Ancient cries
Now the time has come to set the world alight
Spawn of steel and fire we shall rule the night
Hammers fall
Heed the call
The ecstasy of battle takes us up into the sky
Death or glory today might be a fine day to die
Darkened skies
No more lies

[Chorus]
