Beneath forgotten castles in deserted wastelands
In the darkest of dungeons the seal of wrath is hidden
Once broken the seal will unleash the darkness
For the Earth to be consumed by all God has forbidden

Thirteen warriors are chosen to commence the quest
Conceived in the most unholy of rites
Raised to withstand the treachery of God
With hearts as black as the darkest of nights

On the eve of the longest night the quest begins
Armed with magic the thirteen warriors advance
Their swords of steel slay the servants of God
Against the strength of hatred the meek stand no chance

The thirteen swords create a whirlwind of doom
The warriors come ever closer to finding the seal
No crosses or garlic or holy relics can stop them
They march on to the tones of metal that's real

The warriors ride to the heart of the wastelands
After years of hardship the quest's end is near
They enter the castles and stride through the dust
Until they locate the dungeons of pain and fear

Breaking the shields woven by spells of white magic
They go down into the dungeons and uncover the seal
The chosen warriors use their powers of black magic
To break the seal and unleash the reign of steel

The seal is broken and the Earth violently opens up
The dungeons explode in an eruption of Hellfire
The world is engulfed by unholy waves of lust and hate
All of Earth is consumed by darkness and desire
