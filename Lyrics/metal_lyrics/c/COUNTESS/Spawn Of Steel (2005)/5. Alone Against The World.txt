A fire burns within
The flame of steel and hate
I stand against the world
Solely guided by my fate
No possibility of retreat
My steel will soon be tried
My courage will come through
My glory will not be denied

[Bridge:]
Fighting with metal, the power of steel
Victory or death, to none I shall kneel
Blood will be shed, my enemies fear
The whole world, my war cry will hear

[Chorus:]
Alone against the world
The courage to stand tall
Alone against the world
My enemies will surely fall

My armour blinds my foes
Shining metal for all to see
The time of wrath has come
All will die or bow before me

Dark knowledge at my side
Wicked powers to prevail
The light forever to wane
The forces of good shall fail

Much hardship I will endure
To overthrow all conformity
Mighty steel will bring victory
Eternal glory waits for me

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
