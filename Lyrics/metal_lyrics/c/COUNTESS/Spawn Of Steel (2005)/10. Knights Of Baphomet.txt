Back in early twelfth-century Europe
In a time of reform and spiritual rebirth
An order of knights was brought to life
To defend the holy land from the infidel

A new kind of knight, a warrior-monk
Soldiers sworn to poverty and self-denial
Yet fighting bravely with primitive means
Against a vastly superior force

Years of battle, blood, fire and death
But between slaughtering and pillaging
The knights stumbled upon various cults
And delved into mysterious mysticisms

The knights discovered the forbidden
They saw the pleasures life has to offer
And ultimately they decided to change
They chose to tread the Left Hand Path

The order throve in its new-found power
Acquiring massive material possessions
Becoming a force to be reckoned with
While rejoicing in lustful blasphemous rites

But the success of the knights templar
Would ultimately become their undoing
The king of France envied their wealth
Charged them with heresy and blasphemy

Through torture confessions were extracted
And the order was completely dismantled
Its vast possessions seized by the king
Its leaders burned to death at the stake

But the order triumphed beyond the grave
Both king and pope fell to the curse
Cast upon them by the Grand Master
While flames were already caressing his flesh

The templars lost a battle but not the war
The order went underground and survived
Throughout the centuries it exerted its power
Its rituals being practised to this very day
