In the mist of a winter dawn, the trumpets sound
Blood and fire and death await us on the battleground
The gods of war are smiling upon their kin this day
Into glorious battle we ride as black prayers we say

[Chorus:]
The trumpets of dawn are calling
Soon hammers shall be falling
Ride to war! [4x]

In the mist of a winter dawn, the trumpets sound
With axe and sword and scythe we will stand our ground
In the cold winter sun our blades of metal do glow
Mixed with morning dew our enemies' blood will flow

[Chorus]

In the mist of a winter dawn, the trumpets sound
In bloody battle honour and glory will be found
Before the sun has fully risen victory will be ours
We shall burn the spoils to thank the dark powers

[Chorus]
