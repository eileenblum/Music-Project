The house of god is a vile site
The sheep who follow him there gather
To bow before him and writhe in obeisance
To crumble before their would-be father

The house of god is a disgusting mental brothel
It must be devoured by the flames of Hell
Crush the hold of monotheism once and for all
Let none of its slaves be allowed to live to tell

Beneath the cold moon Evil's warriors ride
Carrying swords, torches blazing in the night
Hearts filled with hatred of all that is holy
Before long the house of god will be set alight

Wolves are howling and rain is falling down
A black storm bellows its symphony of gloom
Wakened by this threat the virtuous know fear
Tonight the slaves of god meet their doom

[Chorus:]
Torch the house of god
Burn it down to the ground

The minions of god try to defend his house
But against the steel of evil they cannot fight
And the torches of evil do their wicked duty
The house of god burns to embers this night

On the ashes of the one god's whorehouse
Temples of sin will arise all over the earth
Where heathen rites dormant for aeons
Shall enjoy a glorious rebirth

[Chorus]
