A people enslaved by the laws and lies of the book
Hear freedom's call
Corrupt clerics clinging to the power they once took
The priest must die
One fateful day in this land a little bastard boy is born
Hear freedom's call
Shunned by his society his youth is lonely and forlorn
The priest must die

[Chorus:]
Rise warrior, out of the night
March sword king, into the light
Fight the battle, now stand your ground
Slay the enemy, war drums resound

Poverty is all he knows, petty crime his single goal
Hear freedom's call
Vengeful wrath and rebellion are burning in his soul
The priest must die
One day thrown in jail for breaking religious rules
Hear freedom's call
But one day he will surely crush all the holy fools
The priest must die

[Chorus]

Finally he breaks free
Rising for all to see
War is upon the land
The king will make his stand

Angry young people flock to the self-proclaimed king
Sound the drums of war
By the thousands they march while battle hymns they sing
Sound the drums of war
The clerics try to crush the rebels but they are too late
Sound the drums of war
Their holy buildings soon to be destroyed by fate
Sound the drums of war

[Chorus]

All holiness defiled by the rise of the warrior king
Hail to the king
Holy books are burned everywhere blasphemy does ring
Hail to the king
The slaves of the book are destroyed once and for all
Hail to the king
Glory abounds for those who heeded the sword king's call
Hail to the king

[Chorus]
