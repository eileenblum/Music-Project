We're ghosts of leather and spirits of steel
From the distant past when metal was real
We have no place in the modern age
Our souls are burning with hate and rage

We're relics of the past, we're out of date
But we don't care that we were born too late
We refuse to conform to fashion's flow
The power of ancient metal is all we know

[Bridge:]
Black leather and loud guitars
Spikes and chains and sleazy bars
On every smoke-filled stage we cry
We're ghosts of leather and we'll never die

[Chorus:]
Ghosts of leather; spirits of steel
Warriors of metal; to no man we kneel
Ghosts of leather; demons of fire
Ghouls of iron; we live our desire

Wimps and posers may say we're antiquated
But the might of steel and metal is never outdated
We are beyond trends 'cos metal never dies
In the end once more we'll hear the false one's cries

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
