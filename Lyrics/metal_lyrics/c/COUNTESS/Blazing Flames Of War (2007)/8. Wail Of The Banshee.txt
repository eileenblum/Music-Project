A disembodied soul, woman of the fairy mound
Death is always near, when her wail does sound
Death is at your door [2x]
Clad in green and grey, with long streaming hair
Her eyes a fiery red, all mortals she may scare
Death is at your door [2x]

[Chorus:]
Wail of the banshee [2x]

Appearing near a river, a death she will presage
Hear the terrible wail, a cry of piteous rage
Death is at your door [2x]
When many weep together, tragedy is at hand
A veil of darkness falls, grief all over the land
Death is at your door [2x]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
