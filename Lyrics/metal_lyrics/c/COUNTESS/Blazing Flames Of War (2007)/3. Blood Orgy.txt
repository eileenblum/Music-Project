Black candles on the altar in the cave of desolation
Wizards and demons in velvet robes of black
Prostitutes and lecherous women are present
The rites of lust and hate will now commence

[Chorus:]
Blood orgy, blood orgy
Worship of evil supreme
Blood orgy, blood orgy
Bloody rites of sacrifice

Ritual daggers and swords are brought forth
The innocent virgin is taken to the shrine
She is put on the altar with her legs spread wide
And the tyrant-goat is brought to be the first one

The beast rapes the virgin in glorious unholiness
The virgin's soul lies raped in demonic lust
Now all the demons and wizards fuck the bitch
Spilling their seed all over her delicious body

[Chorus]

Now the evil rite of unholy rape is concluded
Time has come to slay the bitch for the tyrant
A sacred dagger slits the former virgin's throat
The blood flows freely in honor of the tyrant

Demons and wizards celebrate the unholy sacrifice
They eagerly drink the blood of the desecrated virgin
Then they fuck her lifeless corpse over and over again
While the satisfied tyrant smiles upon them...

[Chorus]
