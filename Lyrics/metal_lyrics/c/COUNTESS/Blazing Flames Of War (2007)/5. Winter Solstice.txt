Month of Yule, howling snows ravage the land
Time to hail the gods so renewal they will bring
Around the holy tree a great feast will be held
Much ale we'll drink and many songs we'll sing

[Chorus:]
In the cold of winter sacrifices will be made
Ancient rites of blood in honour of our gods so great

Winter solstice [2x]

In the long midwinter night sacrifices are hung
In the sacred grove on the branches of the tree
Nine males of man and horse and pig and goat
The blood flows freely for our mighty gods to see

[Chorus:]
In the cold of winter sacrifices now are made
Ancient rites of blood in honour of our gods so great

Winter solstice [2x]

In nine holy days seventy-two beings are slain
In the glare of the torches lighting the dark night
The runes are cast while the gods look upon us
The rites of blood will ensure the return of the light

[Chorus:]
In the cold of winter sacrifices have been made
Ancient rites of blood in honour of our gods so great

Winter solstice [2x]
