In ancient times was born the Duncan
Among the druids, the Hunter's son
Sacred to this tribe, a mighty warrior
Every single battle he fought he won

The greatest chief his clan ever knew
All over the Highlands he was revered
Divine blood flowed through his veins
By all his foes his blade was feared

Then the Christians came [4x]

The Duncan's clan fought the Christians
With fire and steel for many years
But too many christian soldiers came
The Highlands soon were drowned in tears

[Chorus:]
Swords shine in the highlands
The blood of Christians flows
Swords shine in the highlands
Yet the one god lie still grows

Statues of the gods now desecrated
Druids slain and holy trees cut down
The Duncan grew old a miserable fugitive
Robbed by the enemy of his crown

His sword was broken by christian might
The old Duncan died stripped of all worth
To Hell his evil wicked soul descended
But the Master sent him back to Earth

Reborn the Duncan the son of a whore
Fathered by the ancient god of the spear
Still remembering his mortal life past
A child he already inspired terror and fear

Growing up in the dark Highland woods
An outcast by birth yet a king by blood
Already a killer and rapist in his teens
Pledged his life to the most unholy god

[Chorus:]
Swords shine in the highlands
The Duncan lives another time
Swords shine in the highlands
Oh! Hear his wicked rhyme

Again he became the fiercest of warriors
Guided by the Master in his war god guise
Swords flock to the mighty Duncan reborn
All youngsters dissatisfied with christian lies

The Duncan clan returned to ways of yore
His blade forged anew amidst pagan cries
Shining swords march against the Christ
Doom of the church fills the Highland skies

Then the Christians died [4x]

The Duncan leads his clan into battle
Fighting for the glory of the ways of old
Beheading priests with his Lochaber axe
Finally crushing the foreign faith's hold

[Chorus:]
Swords shine in the highlands
The Duncan rides once more
Swords shine in the highlands
For the glory of the gods of yore

Many a loch reddened by christian blood
No mercy for the Nazarene's slaves
Slaying and killing, raping and pillaging
Piles of Christians rot in mass graves

Churches are burnt all over the land
Victory is achieved the triumph of hate
Total destruction for the Master's glory
The Duncan has finally fulfilled his fate

Centuries the Duncan ruled his lands
His rightful rule restored once and for all
All memories of the cursed creed erased
The king had truly heeded the Master's call

[Chorus:]
Swords shine in the highlands
Fulfilled is the Duncan's fate
Swords shine in the highlands
For the glory of lust and hate
