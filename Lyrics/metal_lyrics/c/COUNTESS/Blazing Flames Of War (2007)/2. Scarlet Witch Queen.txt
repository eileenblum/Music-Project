Motionless on the silent battlefield I lay
Waiting for the reaper to come for me
Drenched in blood, the pain already gone
My end soon to be...

Then a scarlet radiance breaks through the fog
A woman blindingly beautiful, an incarnation of sin
Appears before my tired, closing eyes
I try to speak but only blood drips from my chin
Suddenly I am bathed in magical, scarlet rain
I feel strength running through my broken limbs again
The entire battlefield is shrouded in a scarlet blaze
The gift of immortality, the Witch Queen's grace

[Bridge:]
Spawned from Nothingness
Fostered by the Dark
Raised on Infinity
Her heart a silver spark

[Chorus:]
Scarlet Witch Queen
In thy name my steel I raise
Scarlet Witch Queen
Thy name ever do I praise
In thy name my steel I raise

Her scarlet lips on mine, a kiss of life and death alike
Sensations inconceivable by men still bound to mortal life
Investing me with hidden powers, life eternal her gift
Her vassal I must be for an eternity of strife
Many earthly moons have passed since that fateful day
I travelled through the ages on missions for my Queen
Feeding the fires of hatred in the minds and souls of men
There cannot be much my undead eyes have not yet seen

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Still I cannot grasp who She is, was or may have been
Could it be She is His daughter Sin I serve forever?
Whatever the truth I could and would not change my fate
Eternal Hell surely worth are the times we lie together
