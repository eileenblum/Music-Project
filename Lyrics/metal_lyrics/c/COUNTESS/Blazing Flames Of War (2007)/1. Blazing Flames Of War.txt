In darkness we ride, a thousand torches alight
Swords and axes held high, reflecting the moon's light
Gods of battle we hail, we beg they bless our steel
Our honour is all we have, to no mortal man we kneel

Blazing flames of war [x4]

In darkness we fight, a thousand torches alight
Our enemies will die well, in this their final night
The joy of battle fills our souls while we fight to our last breath
Warriors die with smiling faces, having achieved an honourable death

Blazing flames of war [x4]

In darkness we prevail, a thousand torches alight
Beer we drink to celebrate our victory in this fight
The battle won, victory achieved, our mighty gods we hail
In a battle in darkness, fire and blood will always prevail

Blazing flames of war [x4]
