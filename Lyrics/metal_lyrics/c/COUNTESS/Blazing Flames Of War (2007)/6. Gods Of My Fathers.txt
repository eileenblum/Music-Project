In the dismal present my mind does wander
To my fathers' gods, the great gods of yore
Surviving centuries of monotheist oppression
In my blood they are stronger than before

Gods of my kin, of thunder, wind and rain
They will return through fire, blood and steel
All the traitors will endure gruesome fates
The power of the hammer our foes will feel

[Chorus:]
Gods of my fathers, gods of the past
Pray return when the runes are cast
Gods of my fathers, gods of my line
Once again your splendour will shine

In the dreary present my heart does long
For my fathers' gods, lofty gods of the past
Enduring the bleak age of monotheist tyranny
In my soul my gods forever will last

Gods of my blood, of hammer, runes and might
Again their holy names will be called out loud
With our true gods a new world we will shape
Man shall rise and with his gods stand proud

[Chorus]

Houses of the treacherous one god shall crumble
His mindless servants shall endure horrible pain
Those still loyal to the old ways shall come forth
After centuries of desolation they now shall reign

On the ashes of the one's houses temples rise
When our glorious gods have come back to stay
The old ones' images are again cast in stone
Never again mankind to the one god shall pray

[Chorus]
