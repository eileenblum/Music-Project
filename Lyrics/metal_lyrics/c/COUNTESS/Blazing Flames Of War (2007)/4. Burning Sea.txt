Sparta and Athens, 27 years of war
Athens' triremes ruled the roaring sea
Spartan hoplites dominated the lands
Decisive victories for long not to be

Both sides won their share of the battles
And the war dragged on year after year
But after a quarter of a century of war
At last an Athenian triumph seemed near

[Chorus:]
The sea is burning
When ships of war collide
The sea is burning
On the waves warriors fight

Athens achieved victory after victory
But the hands of men do not fate weave
And a change in fortune was imminent
When destiny's forces Athens did leave

A minor victory by Spartan Lysander
The fate of Athens' general did seal
Alcibiades not re-elected and retired
A crucial turn taken by fortune's wheel

The admiral Lysander now took charge
An untypical Spartan, comfortable at sea
A trustworthy man, a friend of Persia
He built a fleet Athens' nemesis to be

[Chorus:]
The sea is burning
Dozens of triremes alight
The sea is burning
Destruction of naval might

Lysander seized many enemy cities
A ruthless campaign he led and inspired
Attacking Athens' allies and Attica itself
The Spartans gained the glory they desired

At Agospotaemi the war came to an end
The Athenian fleet was completely destroyed
And the only option now left was surrender
For years to come Athens' power was void

[Chorus:]
The sea is burning
Fireworks for the gods
The sea is burning
Victory against the odds
