Ancient Rome, Caligula's reign
Days of decadence and lust
Utter indecency, complete immorality
Wanton vice and total depravity
Constant orgies, evil conspiracies
Sex and murder went hand in hand
Countless abortions, many poisoned
A veil of sin did cover the land

Amidst the schemes, lust and hate
A woman rose to great heights
Of noble ancestry, imperial blood
A soul untainted by the christian god
Married at twenty, to cousin Claudius
At the court she rose to power
No man safe, from her desire
Her insatiable lust made men cower

[Chorus:]
Messalina
Queen of sluts
Messalina
Empress of desire
Messalina
Harlot of the gods
Messalina
Seductress and liar

Caligula died, through assassination
Weak old Claudius now the emperor
His wife still burned, with lustful fires
Truly a woman of dark desires
Her elderly husband, always unaware
Of his young wife's sexual prowess
Tricked by her, to execute her foes
Rivers of semen flowed for the mistress

A legendary prostitute, she did challenge
To a shameless contest of copulation
Debased fornication, all through the night
She still was going when long it was light
The gods themselves, couldn't speculate
How many men she satisfied
The greatest slut, in the world's history
No perverted impulse she ever denied

[Chorus]

After a decade, of marital mockery
The empress plotted to kill her husband
Devious scheming, with her lovers' aid
But the risks she took were too great
Her conspiracy foiled, by Claudius' men
Yet her lustful legacy, lives to this day
Just thirty years old she was executed
For this saint of evil black prayers we say

[Chorus]
