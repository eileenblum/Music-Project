The moor lies black... unholy clock strikes twelve
Trumpets break the silence... the wind is howling
Bloodred torches blaze... tearing the night apart
Hideous people appear... sick laughter is heard
Forming a circle... around a vacant throne
Suddenly they kneel... the Master arrived
Sits on the throne... the Sabbatic Goat
Time to worship... osculum obscenum

All over the moor... strong stench of blood
Sacrifices commenced... twelve hanged men
Little dead children... with golden daggers cut
Drink the blood... unholy communion
Witches and demons... rejoice in sin
Unbelievable orgy... ritual debasement
Demons play music... the faithful dance
New converts step forth... Full Moon Baptism
