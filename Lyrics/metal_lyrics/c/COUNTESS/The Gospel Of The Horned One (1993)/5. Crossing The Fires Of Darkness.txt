Seven blazing gates to cross
Before I reach my goal
Seven purifying porches
For my parting soul
After life my soul takes flight
Into the eternal night
Heading down the blazing lane
To Satan's promising domain

Seven blazing gates......

Crossing the fires of darkness
Raise the excluding spell
Passing the thresholds of timeless
Leaping right into Hell
Treelike flames surround my spirit
On its way so darkly lit
A road untrodden, all floating round
Underneath no solid ground
Seven blazing gates......
Crossing the fires......

Soon I will behold the highest
Lowest prince in all His might
I will join His ranks infernal
And worship Him in this inferno
