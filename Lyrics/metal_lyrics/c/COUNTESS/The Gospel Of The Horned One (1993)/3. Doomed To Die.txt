Hear the reap of Armageddon, see the fire scorch the sky
Watch the sorcerer awaken, millennium of evil dreams
Altars red of evil rites, faithful feel their glory near
Possessed warriors go berserk, blood reddens the moon
Ancient lords return to earth, now evil finally prevails
Mortals run but cannot hide, pray to god to no avail
Total destruction delights demons, satisfies the Antichrist
Witches sing, evil chorus, mankind surely is now...

...DOOMED TO DIE, Christ did lie
...DOOMED TO DIE, the heavens cry

Hear the bells of evil chime, undead legions march from Hell
Heed the call of hate &amp; war, feel the winds of mayhem blow
Blasphemy &amp; victory, the Master hath returned
Take His hand with no fear now, enter his eternal realm
Sound the charge, into battle, fiery chariots ride the sky
Holding high the banner black, hailed by strong ones &amp; the wise
Side by side into the war, at last the prophecy fulfilled

Witches sing, evil chorus, the universe forever now...

...DOOMED TO DIE, god did lie
...DOOMED TO DIE, the angels cry
