Black Duncan recovered himself for a moment
Then he took his Lochaber-axe
He swayed his arm in the air
Dashed forward, and with a last fierce blow
He split in two the thick skull of Rannoch.
The fight had ended
The storm took full possession of the inn again
The slain Rannoch was dragged away
The Duncan taken care of
And the game continued.
Few days later Black Duncan rode forth again
The fierce gale had passed over
As always, there was still a fresh Nordic wind
But the skies were clear and blue
with only a few white clouds
There was still a long way to go.
