I sold my soul in a cold &amp; dark past
Infernal contract signed with evil blood
Gave 1000 years of earthly pleasures
Now I hear my Master calling me His child
I see the bridge glowing in the dark
Across the bridge of death I must walk
A godforsaken path to the eternal fire
Final part of the evil road I walked
Before long I will enter Hell and......
......KNEEL BEFORE THE MASTER'S THRONE

Dark desires of lust &amp; evil in mind &amp; soul
At last in Hell I will meet the Countess
Reward for lives of total darkness
Unholy 13 lives I lived on earth
Faithfully spreading the Honrned One's gospel
Crossed the bridge I enter His kingdom
Halls of Hell full of fire &amp; brimstone
Sword of thunder &amp; steel still by my side
Before long I will see my Master and......
......KNEEL BEFORE THE MASTER'S THRONE
