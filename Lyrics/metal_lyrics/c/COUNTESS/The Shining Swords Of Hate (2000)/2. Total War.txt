The moon is full the mirror cracks
Smiling from the depths He reigns
See the red eyes in the dark
Tonight the chosen break their chains
Evil dwells, eternal, unstoppable
The warriors of darkness ride
Our souls rejoice in cries of pain
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We are wolves and we are proud
Blood drips from our unholy jaws
Tonight we claim our victory
The priest torn apart by evil claws

We drink the virginÂ´s blood
The High One speaks to us
We hunt on DianaÂ´s trail
We cry in Ecstasy
We know no more fear
The eternal fire we feel
Our fate we embrace
To no mortal man we kneel

Ages old warriors atop a mountain cold
The shining swords of hate by their sides
To an eternal life of blood and honour called
By the One who rides disguised through the night
One with darkness in wind and rain
They feel the Fourth Storm drawing near
For centuries for The Sign they waited
At last the eternal winter is here
They have returned to wipe out their shame
The sheep will drown in blood and pain
Revenge is sweet as a virginÂ´s flesh
All your fuckinÂ´ prayers said in vain
At last the reign of the king of slaves
And his worshippers will be done
The cross nothing but a memory
When the final war is won
For two centuries the slaves of Christ
Spat on mankindÂ´s true Father
But now clouds of darkness and hate
Above JehovahÂ´s throne gather
