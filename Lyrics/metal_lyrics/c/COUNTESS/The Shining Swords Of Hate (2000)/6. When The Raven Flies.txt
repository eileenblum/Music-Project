When summers are forgotten
And brothers slay each other
When the legions of Surt rise
And MuspellÂ´s horde fills the skies
When the Norns annihilate all peace
And Naglfar sails the seas
The dawn of the final war is here
When gods wage war the end is near

When the horn of Heimdall blows
And holy blood in thick rivers flows
When the son of Loki breaks his chains
And Midgard is consumed by flames
When forces of darkness and light collide
For puny mortals thereÂ´ll be nowhere to hide
The dawn of the final war is here
When gods wage war the end is near

When the raven flies
We must heed the call
When the raven flies
We will stand or fall
When the raven flies
We must heed the call
When the raven flies
We will stand or fall

When the sky turns black as night
And nothing is left but the will to fight
When the Einherjar are to fulfill their destiny
ThereÂ´s no more use for All-Father's necromancy
When giants and trolls united ride
And even Wodan and Donar fall side by side
The dawn of the final war is near
When gods wage war the end is here
