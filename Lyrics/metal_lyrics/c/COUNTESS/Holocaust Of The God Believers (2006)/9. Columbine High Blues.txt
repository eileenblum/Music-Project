I got the blues - the Columbine High blues
Popular kids scorn me - guess I wear the wrong shoes

Now I wear a black coat - I'm different it shows
I'm lost in my own world - my hate it sure grows

I'm thinking of a plan - my revenge on mankind
To go out with a bang - leave a lot of corpses behind

I fetch me some guns - some bombs I assemble
All the kids who hate me - soon they'll all tremble

Once more I'm off to school - but I won't learn a thing
I'm shooting at will - my bullets they do sing

Jocks and christians fall - wounded victims I chase
Until I take my own life - I have made my case

It must have been my music - or those computer games
But what about my rearing - yet my parents no one blames
