Darkness is falling, the Master is calling
Shining swords of hate will swing
Tonight the black metal storm will rage
The songs of evil we will sing

Blowing speakers, Hell's rock &amp; roll
With fire and steel we heed the call
Thunder strikes and metal sounds
The glorious roar of Hell's mighty hounds

[Chorus:]
Black metal storm
Heads banging everywhere
Black metal storm
Sign of horns in the air
Black metal storm
Steel and fire in the night
Black metal storm
War upon the light

Blazing black leather, spikes and chains
For those who stand against the light
We were chosen to spread His word
For the glory of Hell we ride the night

[Chorus]

We bring tears to the eyes of Christ
In utter defiance we invert the cross
Ride the winds of darkness and evil
The Master's glory is Yahweh's loss

[Chorus]
