Raise the banners of evil
Oil the swords of hate
Today we ride for Satan
Today we ride with fate

Join the legions of malice
Polish the blades of doom
Today we bring destruction
Darkness, death and gloom

Hear the devil preacher
His sermon calls for war
The black legions must ride
For magic and might of yore

Thousands of warriors follow
The pennant of hate into battle
Against the god of deception
With fire and steel show our mettle

Join up with the black crusade
Enrol in the legions of hate
March against the laws of the light
With fire and steel and metal might

Join up with the black crusade
Enrol in the legions of hate
March against all obsequiousness
Our shining swords the Master will bless

Join up with the black crusade
Enrol in the legions of hate
March against the throne of divinity
Our blades to forge total blasphemy

All hail the black crusade
We proudly wave the flag of hate
All hail the black crusade
We march towards our holy fate

All hail the black crusade
We ride for darkness and death
All hail the black crusade
We march 'til our very last breath

All hail, all hail the black crusade [4x]
