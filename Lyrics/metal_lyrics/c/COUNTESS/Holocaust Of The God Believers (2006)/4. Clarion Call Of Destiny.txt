Hear the call of destiny it's ringing everywhere
The clarion call of metal, wimps and posers beware
Calling us to fight and bleed for metal pure and real
Turn up the amps and let the world know the sound of steel

Hear the call of destiny it's calling us to war
The clarion call of metal cries for magic of before
Darkened clouds are rising to fill the metal sky
Bolts of lightning strike where gods of metal fly

[Chorus:]
Metal is our destiny [4x]

Hear the call of destiny it's singing in our blood
The clarion call of metal, hammer of the thunder god
Metal warriors ride the night with leather, fire and steel
Proud and strong we carry on forever the call we heel

Hear the call of destiny it's ringing everywhere
The clarion call of metal, wimps and posers beware
Darkened clouds are rising to fill the metal sky
Bolts of lightning strike where gods of metal fly

[Chorus]
