The slaves of god lined up for execution
The globe to be cleansed of this human pollution
They lived their lives in self-chosen slavery
In their death throes all they hear is our mockery

The houses of their god all fall to the flame
Now the sheep will die in disgrace and shame
They're hanged or gassed, stabbed or shot
Mercilessly butchered and not saved by their god

[Chorus:]
Holocaust - holocaust of the god believers [4x]

Massive piles of bodies slaughtered they lie
Amidst horrors of evil blasphemy they did die
Their fantasy of paradise will not be fulfilled
All that's left are streams of holy blood spilled

[Chorus]

The dawn of wrath is here
False faith has turned to fear
The glory of evil abounds
Hell's cry of victory sounds

God's slaves reduced to dust
The triumph of death and lust
The greatest massacre of all
Heeded is the Master's call

Into the ovens... [2x]
Where is your god now? [2x]

[Chorus]
