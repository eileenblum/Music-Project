Impregnable fortress, prepared for siege
Above a steep rock face rising high
Its summit deeply covered with snow
To capture it men would be able to fly

Many had taken refuge in this fortress
Including the lord's daughters and wife
Oxyartes would not submit to Alexander
But the fortress was his last hope in life

[Chorus:]
Sogdian rock [4x]

With iron pegs and strong flaxen lines
Macedonians set out covered by night
Climbing the steepest part of the cliff
The summit was seized at first light

Enemy troops now on top of the rock
The defenders shocked by this sight
Without any more resistance they yielded
Further glory for Alexander in this fight

[Chorus]
