I am the priest of the ways of old
Through the ages my sword I wield
Broken in two or shining in glory
Whatever the odds never I yield

My sword never sleeps [2x]

I teach you secrets, cast the runes
The magic of yore is what I bring
I am howling, wolves are praying
Listen to the olden hymn we sing

My sword never sleeps [2x]

Many times you have seen my face
But do you dare look into my eyes?
Many times you have heard my song
But do you dare listen to my words?
My sword never sleeps

Unbowed after centuries oppression
My holy flame still burns with might
The slanderous one god never I fear
My divine blade will inspire your fight

My sword never sleeps [2x]

I am the one who carries the torch
I am the one who wields steel of yore
I am and always will be your guide
I am the priest of the ancient lore
