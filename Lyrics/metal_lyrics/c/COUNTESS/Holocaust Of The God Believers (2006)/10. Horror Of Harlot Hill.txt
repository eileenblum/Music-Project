On the hill an ancient brothel stood
Where vice did reign for many years
Evil copulation and unholy fornication
Sins of the flesh that every christian fears

[Chorus:]
Lustful desires and wicked sins
Degenerates do the Master's will
Hear of the horror of harlot hill

Servants of god tore the brothel down
Erecting a filthy church in its place
Thinking harlot hill was now purified
And blessed anew by the one god's grace

[Chorus]

But the priest of the church on the hill
Was an evil sinner if ever there was one
By day he pretended to be a man of god
But by night all his goodness was gone

[Chorus]

In the dark in the church on harlot hill
The priest practised the most unholy rites
Raping many children for the Master's glory
Lustful dark sins reigned through the nights

[Chorus]
