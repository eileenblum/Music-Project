[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

No burst out, just this inheritance, no resort deathwish is next
War takes over, fades out the past shrinking from this present

Fades out the past
You can't run you can't hide
On your knees the hands tight till the strength is ending
From our gory and rotten leavings they are eating - deathwish is next

This epitaph has been carved, this Course has been stroke out
This Chapter has been written, this weapon has been cast
Deathwish is next!
