[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

Forgotten souls and doomed existence remain in the mud
Progress and gain lead us to the oblivion
Elusive safety submitted to us by this system
A perfidious quiet and tranquillity surrounds all

Day by day we raise the pace
Day by day we distend the limits
Simplicity of the being we have unlearned
Basic pillars of foundation we have lost
Deep hollow pits will be dumped out of the soil
Massive ditches are torn apart ailt up all

Day by day we raise the pace
Day by day we distend the limits
