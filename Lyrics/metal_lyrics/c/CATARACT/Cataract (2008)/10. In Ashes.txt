[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

Ashes, ruins and dust - pain, tears and distrust
Corpses, blood and waste - empty fields of the past
Smoke and Stench rises from the fields - ashes, ruins and dust

The battle lost under iron shields - pain, tears and distrust
The swords of resentments that have hit corpses, blood and waste

Left blood and waste
Violent swarm descended the hill - left blood and waste
Raging beasts attack the throats - no prisoners

No prisoners!
