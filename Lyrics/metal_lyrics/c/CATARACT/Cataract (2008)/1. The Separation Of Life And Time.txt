[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

From the remples of divinity a call for a craven dogmatism

Demonized! Trapped in life!

Threatening with purgatory, claiming the flawed realm
A strangehold over all life and finding meaning in another world
Defaming civilisation and this world's refinement

Demonized! Trapped in life!

Repressive violence sealed with faith, slaughtered thousands profane souls
A strangehold over all life and finding meaning in another world

The separation of life and time
Life and time!

Defaming civilisation and this world's refinement
Demonized and trapped in this life
The separation of life and time

Demonized! Trapped in life!
