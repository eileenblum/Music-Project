[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

Taking over what we call our own, feeding your rancor and your sightless scorn
Through the time you forgot, you forgot the past
Dragging down our thoughts and power by using this force with a smile on your face
Taking all back to the blackest hour off this world's greatest disgrace
Fearing the pressure of diversity and denying life and it's variety
Blinded ignorance enforced by hate your anger leads to your fate
We will see behind, behind the mask you wear and we won't forget the past
