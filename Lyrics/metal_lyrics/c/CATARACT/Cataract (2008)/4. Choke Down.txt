[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

This incontent industry cashing in on your misery
Selling products that decry, channeled into a consuming lie
Our own abilities have been displaced, projected onto items we're forced to own

Bloodsucking industries will get you all
Bloodsucking industries will cut your throats
Bloodsucking industries will crush you down
Bloodsucking companies will get you all

Choke us down

Caught in this wheel from birth there's no way out
This treadmill is our curse. Choke us down!
Keeping it until death is here. Choke us down!
Dignified by constricted fear. Choke us down!
