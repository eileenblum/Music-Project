[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

So where the fuck are you now, I heard loud words long time ago

Nothing but a teenage riot? Nothing but an empty scream?
Nothing but a teenage riot? Nothing but an empty scream into the night?
This where you needed up! So where the fuck up are you now?

Scream into the night

No sincerity in your words, nothingness is left of what I heard
Nothing but a teenage riot? Nothing but an empty scream?
Nothing but a teenage riot? Nothing but an empty scream into the night?
This where you needed up! There's no sincerity in your words!

Scream into the night

Slipped off your skin!
Embrace what you have become, this is where you ended up
Your revolution is a loss, or just a youth rebellion
Slipped off your juvenile skin, the black snake you've been
Your revolution is a loss or just a youth rebellion
