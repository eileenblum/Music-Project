[Music by MÃ¤der, Kuzmic and DÃ¼rst; Lyrics by Carminitana]

Righteous defamation, dexterity in days of divinity
Sinister gods of destruction and war take over their roll
Obliteration of the sacred force the campaign of propaganda

Banished from this dying world
The campaign of propaganda
Blood soaked enlightenment and brutal crusades
Have been spanned over death and burned amd the stake
Banished from the fortress of this dying world
Force the campaign of propaganda

Banished from this dying world
The campaign of propaganda

Sworn to poverty!
Blood soaked enlightenment and brutal crusades
Have been spanned over death

Burned at the stake!
