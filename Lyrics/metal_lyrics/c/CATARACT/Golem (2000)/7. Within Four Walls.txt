Aren't you happy
With the world you're living in?
I see you fighting and fighting
For the same values as before
No step forward
No step back
In a system you are part of
Once more i have to say
I'm sorry for your behavior because you're stuck
Within your four walls
Don't even want to know
Whats on the other side
Don't even care whats outside
Stagnation caused by wanting progression
Oh, cant you see, oh, cant you feel
Satisfaction is driven by anger
From men just like you
Wisdom is power
Hate is the move
Tell me, where are you heading for
A few kids follow your ideas
Is not enough to make a change
You're stuck within your four walls
