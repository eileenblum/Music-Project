When men was created
It was for good and bad
To spread the human race
What a smile stood for
Was to clear every man
The struggle of survival
Surrounded by a smile
But today death came knocking
On my best friends door
My tears were winning
And my smile is gone
He took it to his final place
Buried deep down it lies
Tell me how to get back my smile
Cause I'm sick of tears
That tear me down
The loss of a smile
