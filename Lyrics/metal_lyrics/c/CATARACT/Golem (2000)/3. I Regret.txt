Now that I've got you
Where i always wanted you to be
Fallen from your throne
There will be no heaven for you
What can i do
What will i do
As you crawl in front of me
Shot point blank in your knees
You will never rise again
See the world you used to see
I haunt you in the dreams you have
I turn your future black
And i will waste every inch of the way you walk
Shattered dreams
Eye for an eye
Death before dishonour
Regret the day i was born
