I've made my decision
I've chosen my path
At this point of life
Everything is coming together
Through the depths of all thoughts
That's where i have to go now
Against my wish
I don't deserve this
No way to choose your future
Blinded by darkness
I walk this endless journey
I fell left alone
No one here
To stand by my side
Fire is lightning
Shadows still rising
Blinded by darkness
The darkness that claims me
With every light
Comes some unhappiness
Shadows burn like fire
No choice
I've made my division
I've chosen my path
Just emptiness
Full of hate
Just emptiness
Full of jealousy
