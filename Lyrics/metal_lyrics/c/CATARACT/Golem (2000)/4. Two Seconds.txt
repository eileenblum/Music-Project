Two seconds make the difference
You always know
You will never question
You never doubt
Cause you're the one
Its nothing to you
A pile of broken glass
A broken stick
A load of trash
But its a world to me
A reason to give
A reason to fight
A reason to live
How could you understand?
As you don't even care
How could you understand?
My choice
Cause you don't care
You don't dare
To question yourself
You always know
You will never question
You never doubt
Cause you're the one
