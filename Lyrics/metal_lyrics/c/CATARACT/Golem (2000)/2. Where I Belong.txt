These are our lives
Between two worlds
No place where i feel home
Nowhere any safe
This is our love
Having and giving it all
All that you can
For our own dreams
These are our aims
The goals of our lives
For our intention
A desire to hold on to
This is where i belong
These are our lives
Between two worlds
But i wont change
