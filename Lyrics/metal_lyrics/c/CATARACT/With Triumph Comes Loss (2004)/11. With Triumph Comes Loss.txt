Humanity is covered by the veil of suffocation compassionated world is set on fire the 
leaders rule with no regret dead bodies have formed the absolute the foundation of 
oppression they have been given is the result of nations history has driven this engulfed 
world we have to set free this crippled bodies we have to heal Most western civilisations 
often take their social and economical structures as the basic platform for a healthy 
society. Without considering the cultural and social evolution, they try to stamp their 
own meaning of life onto other civilisations in the meaning of being the only "right" 
solution for all their problems. We have to fight this triumph of loss.
