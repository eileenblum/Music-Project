Empower your servants, there will be anarchy All evil will rise and Gomorrah will be here 
Burn the holy book, the book of tales and myths There is a new power to be risen on our 
planet Ashes will cover all false believes And hope will be the new destiny This will be 
when we will have strength This will be when we will overcome Set free the legions 
dominating species For a new planet earth and a new world order I destroy your believes 
No gods - no masters I destroy your symbols No gods - No masters No gods - No masters 
No gods - No masters When our mind is free from (religious) imagination and beliefs this 
world is going to be a better place. Humanity uses symbols to hold on to lies and to 
justify their unworthy unrighteous behavior. Terror is based on beliefs and false hope. 
War is based on books about tales and myths. Freedom died when humanity started 
reading the holy books and started creating symbols to justify their insecurity about 
things they can't explain. We have to overcome this urge and accept that we can not 
know everything. They should fear the revenge and not hope for forgivingness.
