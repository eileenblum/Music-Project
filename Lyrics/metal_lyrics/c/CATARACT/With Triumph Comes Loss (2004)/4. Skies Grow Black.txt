Drifting from the living the skies grow black Truth's now bleeding pure blood of the lack 
Beast of possessions licking your blood From burned stumps their future's cut Denial of 
freedom, denial of salvation, denial of life for their salvation Dominion's been revealed and 
erased all cultural breathing Slavery will take control of your chained soul! Of your soul! 
Modern war is not just about a conflict which has to be solved. Todays "leading" nations 
use their destructive war machinery to achieve power and political influences for future 
economical actions. No matter what the consequences are for the freedom and will of the 
people who live in the regions of interest. And reality strikes again.
