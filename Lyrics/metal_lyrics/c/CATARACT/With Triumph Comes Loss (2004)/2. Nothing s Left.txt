So many times we shared our thoughts So many moments we were so close So filled with 
joy and full of trust We walked along the lightened road Nothing is left now that I m gone 
Now I see your hidden face Nothing is left... Tied by my feelings in my heart, I couldn't 
see behind the mask It's all past and from this spot now I can see what you were and 
what I despise I ll go my way with compassion towards the light The decision I took 
opened the door to take a step out of the dark What is left of the angry and creative 
energy that we used to have when this was supposed to be the most important thing in 
your life. Together we developed passion, dedication and trust for this and now that you 
grow older you turn your back and everything you ever talked or just thought about is 
worth nothing to you now. There's nothing left of you!
