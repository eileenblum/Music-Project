Is this our road to keep moving on following your heart in the right direction? Dreams and 
desires, where are they left Dreams and desires, vanished in the dark Vanished in the d
ark Passions and wishes buried in empty fields Passions and desires, you oppressed 
yourself These are the chains we re force to wear These are the chains we have to break 
Chains we re forced to wear! Chains we have to break! Are you really free to decide what 
to do with your life? Is there individuality? Aren't we just born into a framed life, limited 
by values and rules? Is there a way to get rid of this huge pressure on our back since 
we're born? If we stop questioning ourselves we wont be able to have an impact on any 
outside influence. Everybody has certain patterns he is given by birth. Humanity needs to 
educate itself to get rid of this burden. The way to do this is hard, very challenging and 
most fail but if we stop, we drown in chaos... we have to break our invisible chains.
