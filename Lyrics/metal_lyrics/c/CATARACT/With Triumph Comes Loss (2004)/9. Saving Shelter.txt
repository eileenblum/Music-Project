The saving shelter I want to achieve This last drop of blood running down my knees I see 
the path of endless passion No estimation for my determination This is ... what i would kill 
for This is what I want to carry in my heart This is what i stride for - my strength and 
truth You have betrayed your own existence Focused on broken dreams that ll burn you 
soul This is ...What i would kill for! This music has give us the most important experiences 
in our lives. The importance of what this means to us can never be described by words. 
Everyone who just stood on a stage for a single second knows what we mean. This is 
something that we don't want to miss, this is our life and this is our destiny!
