I won't give in, I won't back down No matter what you say my heart carries the truth 
Whatever you say fuels my engine And every action you take is the pavement I walk on 
There's only one truth I carry with me No one else can see No one can take it from me 
Take it from me I won't give in I won't give in Everyone can doubt about your actions, 
beliefs and thoughts. They can try to hold you back and try to put you down referring to 
them. What they fear is what they know you are able to achieve, so they won't let you 
do it. They can doubt about your goals because they don't understand what motivation 
you have. But there is no one that can doubt about the pure strength of your will and 
your heart. It is your pathfinder and the only thing they can't take away. We won't give in.
