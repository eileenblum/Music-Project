Everyday struggle for freedom and for peace Will smash humanity for it's unreal habits 
With every battle there comes death A world torn between triumph and loss Insulted by 
information and manipulated by look 
Infiltrated by your leaders and used as their weapon 
The orders we follow implant deadly seed 
That splits us apart like jackyl &amp; hide The ghouls are implanted through power and lust To 
empower the weak to rise as we speak To rise as we speak As we speak I face my ghouls 
of my resistance 
Will fight your seeds Indoctrinated As we speak ! Everybody is stuck within a system, no 
matter what kind. Even the most independent gatherings have rules and leaders. With 
every news we get, with every step we take there is information we got indoctrinated. 
As for people in a more educated and democratic world, we are still capable to judge 
whether it's good or bad. And yet we cannot avoid to get indoctrinated by information 
that manipulate us to act a certain way. We all have a two sides in us. We all like to 
good and the bad. It just shows in different ways. As varied as humans are, as many 
faces the devil has. We need to overcome our indoctrination code and be aware that we 
have to stand for our own beliefs. We should base the laws and systems on being aware 
of our own demon. The demon of greed, power and lust...
