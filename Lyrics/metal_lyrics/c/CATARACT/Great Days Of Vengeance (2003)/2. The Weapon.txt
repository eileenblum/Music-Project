Where's the true knowledge?
This weapon has to rise upon the shadows of heaven to equality that will mean salvation
Where's our progress?
Our holy acquisition of socialisation brought dirty sow and misery erased all self achievement
This is the weapon to set their heart on fire
This is the war which has to be done

We don't want to provide our process built inside, burn in hell!
Clean your hands in consciousness and dirty bodies will burn in hell
Burn in hell!!
They don't know hope! They don't know life! They don't know joy!
...but they know fear!

This is the weapon to set their heart on fire
This is the war which has to be done

This is the war
This the weapon... the only weapon!!!
