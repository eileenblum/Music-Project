Enslaved since our birth we walk the path built by angels of blind tradition
Down the valley of lies and oppressions, strangled guilty minds tied by poisoned strings
Sinner from birth in a dying world built the walls,
Walls around our social grave stone by stone

Walk on broken glasses carrying their requirement
Crippled wings of freedom are burning our hope

Burning!
Burning our hope!
