I beg for the big eruption, the renewal of mother earth
Take back what is hers, recover from bleeding wounds
Open the monster's gate and oceans will disappear
Unleash the holy fire and burn this gory fields

With ashes from within, streams of boiling stones
Gas that's poisoning air, rise the burning hell

Open the monster's gate and oceans will disappear
Unleash the holy fire and burn this gory fields

...burn this gory fields

Insects will rule this world and eat what's brought,
Brought by hellish storm
Ashes will cover the ground for creatures
It's the needed bound

Brought by hellish storm
It's the needed bound

...so burn this gory fields

Deliver us from evil, for the sake of a new order
Set free the world from killing and create a brand new willing
