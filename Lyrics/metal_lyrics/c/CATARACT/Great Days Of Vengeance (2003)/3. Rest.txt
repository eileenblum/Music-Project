I don't walk your path I won't breed that seed
It's deep in my heart though you're my blood
Losing it's deepest bonds crack it's final chains
Unbound the willing from those that are killing

None of the ultimate can save from grace
And here we stand for the final race

Turn from devil's eyes or become his final servant
No way you can hide for it is your destiny
