The humans are breeding for what they'll be bleeding
When machines takes control we've lost our soul

Technology took it's place set back the human race
What was to be our future divides our human culture
The Screen took our privacy Bios is the premier key
For profit and great fame who is to blame?

Technology took it's place set back the human race
What was to be our future divides our human culture
The Screen took our privacy. Bios is the premier key.
For profit and great fame who is to blame?

The humans are breeding for what they'll be bleeding
When machines takes control we've lost our soul

We've lost our soul!

Primitive instincts like back in Trias
But knowledge's bound... bound to bios

I won't follow
All your leaders

I won't follow all your leaders
And be one of the feeders

I won't follow
All your lies
