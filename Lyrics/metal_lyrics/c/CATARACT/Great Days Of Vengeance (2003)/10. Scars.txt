Sometimes years go by
And wounds lay open
No intention for action
Cause time heals all wounds
It's said that there is
No sorrows after days
No pain after months
No regret after years

No regret
After years

If wounds do heal why do we choose a different way
How can we judge what's wrong and what's right

Scars cover my heart

If wounds do heal
Why do we make
A different decision
A change of priorities

But if wounds do heal
How can we avoid
To do all mistakes
Again and again

...again...

Scars cover my heart and I am so proud to carry them deep down inside
Scars make me breath give sense to my feelings they carry the truth
For future decisions

If all wounds do heal why do we choose a different way
How can we judge what's wrong and what's right

Scars cover my heart
