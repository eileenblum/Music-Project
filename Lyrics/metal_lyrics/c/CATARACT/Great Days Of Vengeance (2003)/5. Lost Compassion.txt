Lost compassion and closed eyes, ignoring truth and freedom inside
Fear becomes directed hate towards all those in different shape
Inflicted cast that separates bright from dark in any case
Closed eyes that lost control of a sane reality and a sober soul
We won't turn away
We won't close our eyes
We won't let you try
Never!!! Never!!!

With eyes full of hate fighting equality
Manipulating theories for a their ideology
Discriminating life cause their afraid

We will fight your words!

We take a stand towards this hating ignorance
Will incinerate their hatred and poisoned thoughts
Won't accept their disrespect to dignity and humanity ...
To dignity and humanity!!!

We won't turn away
We won't close our eyes
We won't let you try
Never!
