Kill projected fantasies and escape the unconsciousness definition of the sacred !
conceal your fear of end with sharped obsessions
placate the renunciation of this guilty order
This is the reuniciation, your endless mortification, this is your lie to this world !
your life is a lie !
Made to measure human life, guided by intellectual needs created to lead and dominate and followed by blind obedience
your life is a lie !
decline this slander through glorious scavengers
erase the ancient stench of this illusions
your life is a lie !
conceal your fear of end with sharped obsessions
placate the fail of this guilty order
