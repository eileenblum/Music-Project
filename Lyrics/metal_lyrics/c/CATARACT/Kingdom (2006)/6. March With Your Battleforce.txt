Take down your tyrannic mask and speak out your leadership
The total reign you're seeking for, for full control you're reaching out
Running over civil life, use your mighty warriors
To take it all with your list, march with your battleforce
Unifying goatherd beasts running infested demons
Paralyzing truths and rights in frozen dust you spilled the blood
Running over civil life, use your mighty warriors
To take it all with your list, march with your battleforce
March with your battleforce
