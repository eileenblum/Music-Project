legions are waiting to enter the gates of this fortress in which conspiracy grows.
Take the power, to lead your masters not considering the blood they waist to lead your nations and feed your boil destroying cultures for power and oil
Corpses, decapitations and rape!
you opened the gates to strike the evil.
Thousands condemned, defined your enemies you have defined your enemies
