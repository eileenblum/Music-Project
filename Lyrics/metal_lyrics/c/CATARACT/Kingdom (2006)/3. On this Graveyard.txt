Day by day we see them fall, all alone we hear their call
Cold tears drop from their eyes on this graveyard full of lies
Torn to pieces, ragged and frayed In the coffin locked and saved
In this world they have been betrayed by their faith into their lords
The laws are silent, quiet and notched In these days were weapons speak
Dropping millions in despair children die in scanty fields
Day by day we see them fall all alone we hear their call
same tears drop from their eyes on this graveyard full of lies
Cold tears drop from their eyes on this graveyard full of lies
