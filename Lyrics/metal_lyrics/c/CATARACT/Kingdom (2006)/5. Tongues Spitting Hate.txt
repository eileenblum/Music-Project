Tongues spitting hate - Words of lies, pull the strings around human neck
Blades drowned in poison - in the black skies, resurrecting hope through wars and bloodshed
The seed of damnation your highest goal, trivializing illusion, that fall from the cliff
Walk your own - reality, preached your faith spilled with hate!
Machine gun fire penetrating cold bodies, your life for shattered glass stuck into your flesh!
