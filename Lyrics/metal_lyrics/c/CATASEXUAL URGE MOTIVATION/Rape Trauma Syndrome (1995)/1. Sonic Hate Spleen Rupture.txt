My right-side brain
Is deranged and burst out
Dissect and examine
The inside of my head
Hold back stream of artery
Fevered, boiled, reversed, putrefied
Mutation of nerve cell
Pressure of expanding madness
Malignant angioneurotic edema
Scar ruptured in malignancy
Dying my sight luridly
Obsessed by body-destruction
Practice of mass homicide
Sympathy with the serial killer
Absolute order from them
"Do it, at all costs."
