Harvest of the blood
Hooked through the foot
Hanging bloody pulp
Chopped razor's wound
Reason dripping with blood
Lose consciousness slowly but surely
Shudder for pleasure moment
Extract of addrenalins
Be intoxicated over drug
Dreaming in eternity
Human juice collected in tub
Hemoglobin flew into pieces
Cast off of soul
The origin of life
Body soaked in bloody pond
Bloody flesh keeps forever
