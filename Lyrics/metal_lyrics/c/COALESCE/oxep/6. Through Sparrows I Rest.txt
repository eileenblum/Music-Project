Whisper truth and make yourself of no reputation.
Don't fear the "righteous" and their new loves.
Kick against those who throttle their strength as a master.
Embrace the weak with more than you have and lead.
Don't hide your sick.
Put it on display for everyone to suffer and kill your secrets dead with one moment.
I will not meet any of your needs and I will disappoint.
We will not avert our eyes.
And to those who say "I only ask the least," I say ask nothing at all.
Demand they give all of themselves.
If my heart and tongue must be poisoned to purge my flesh, then let it fall off the bone.
This will fail at the grave.
We excel at saddling a suffering on all those in reach.
I can see only young cowards that plot against man and all his stock.
Against me.
Let me find rest through sparrows, who focus on the moments needs and do not stray from the facts.

Whisper truth and make yourself of no reputation.
Don't fear the "righteous" and their new loves.
Kick against those who throttle their strength as a master.
