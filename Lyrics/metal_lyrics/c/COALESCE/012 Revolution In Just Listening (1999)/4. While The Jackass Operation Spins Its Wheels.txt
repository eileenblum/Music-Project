My very existance offends you and I love while you are
spinning your wheels I move straight ahead ten fold
with nothing more than a gut feeling to move. While
you're spinning your wheels for a lousy name. I never
met anyone who tries as hard as you, you're up all
night,learning the big words to come off strong. The
only ones you're fooling are your so-called allies.
You live off them and call it a revolution. Well,
you're a joke. and a lousy friend. You're just another
p.c. jackass operation. Self-imposed poverty in a
squalor for bitching rights is embarrasing. But, you
kept it real cozy at home. So, send all mail bombs to
mom and make the whole family proud of just what he
teaches. You talk a square into a circle, but nothing
really changes. You have an out. Real people don't,
real people don't give a shit how you thikn they
should live.
