If you still need to double check my work to make sure
you agree. If you need to sign an "X" before and after
every title before it's relevant, then I've wasted six
years of my life on the simple notion that this was an
open forum. Then I've wasted six years. Burn them, if
your edge is so sharp it severs ties. Burn them, if
you've never been proud. Burn them all. Burn them, if
you've never been ashamed. Burn them. Burn them. Burn
them and be done with it. Burn them, if the music only
plays second stage. Burn them, if you've never been
scared. Burn them, if your edge is so sharp, it severs
ties. Burn them, if you've never been proud. Burn
them. Burn them. Burn them and be done with it. Burn
them. Burn them. Burn them and be done with it. And
none of us have all the answers, that's the whole
point. Just the opinions that serve and piss off the
masses whether left, right, or right at home. .
