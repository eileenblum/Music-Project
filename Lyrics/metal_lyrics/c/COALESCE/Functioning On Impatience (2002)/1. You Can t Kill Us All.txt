What more do you want from me? Some sort of apology?
Well I promise that forgiveness is the most you'll
get. And what I demand of you is to put up or shut up.
So make your decision, but remember - you can't kill
us all. I know you don't know what you say but I don't
feel any safer from you. Hate is too easy and we'll
both find a way to be right. No matter how far a
stretch. And even now I've all but forgotten what
we're fighting for. To end something or to begin it? I
don't even know why I care to continue. Old habits die
hard I guess. But we don't. And the threats are still
made. I'll kill you. Even though turning away seems
safer. I want to be in the middle. I want to go for
the jugular, but I don't remember why. Was it to start
something or to end it? I know why I continue. I do it
all for them. For her I can be an influence and for
them a backbone. To end the old and begin a new age of
compromise and clear thinking.
