I'm listening but I can't believe the arrogance I'm
constantly bombarded with. If I were a lazy man I
could swallow the debt you put us in. But now, I fear
that maybe I can't roll with these punches. I don't
want to be that man. Independence is all me have but
that's now becoming a joke by your actions. I don't
want to be that man who let it all go and found out
how sweet revenge really is. So sweet it consumed me
and pushed me toward crime. Oh, only if you put in the
hours I have to make this work. Put in the time I
think you want me to beg for what I work so hard for.
Simple independence. All I ever wanted was for
everyone to be content and safe. I won't be that man.
