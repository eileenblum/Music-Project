[Music: Jesse Pintado, Mitch Harris]
[Lyrics: Barney Greenway]

Got to grab all while you can -
A perversion !

Once you had the gall to even up the score,
moving in common circles, where the circles stood for human bonds.

The tide has turned, allegiance tested.
Upward and uninterested.

Beforehand, adamant and strong, prosperity could not transform.
Snort the drug, gather the assets, step on the head of the drowning man.

The tide has turned, allegiance tested.
Upward and uninterested.

Hailed as a saviour as enterprise succeeds, your obsession overrides.
Where once you fought to stop the trap enclosing, now you lay the bait.

Speculate, capitalise.
Words that distort to promote financial genocide.
Ideals for trade, respect invested.
Upward and uninterested.

Got to grab all while you can - A perversion!
