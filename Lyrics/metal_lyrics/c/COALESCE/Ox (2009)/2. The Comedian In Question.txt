Liars!
Oh, these hypocrites!
I was right!
They are their own enemy.
And only represent their own wants and needs.
Why have you fooled me?
I have no will to entertain them.
His heart, it whispers lies that he's beyond reproach.
Beyond reproach of men.
That there is no room for those that question their need for distractions.
Defy the though that I have anything to offer based on the cut to your ego.
