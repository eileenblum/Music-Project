The world was undone.
We were beasts running rampant.
Our lust was in our mouths with the law to justify its purpose.
We had our own ideas of what righteous was and we staged it all of our minds
It was dishonest and a little bit cheap, but it made the way for our war anthems.
Our love was weaker, so we drew from our hate.
It's all we had.
We could fight our foes if we became the beasts that we claimed to slay.
Ignore the strings.
We had created a new law, and no one forced our hands.
You were replaced by our needs.
We bought our righteousness with what we had refused.
Like all laws...
Fail or flee.
I failed the law.
