Come on loyal woman, I gotta hear that wild ox moan.
Come on loyal woman, I gotta hear that wild ox moan.
I think heard that wild ox moan.
I think heard that wild ox moan.
Come on loyal woman, I think that I can hear that wild ox moan.
I think that I can hear your heart beating, but can you handle the depths to which I will sink to satisfy myself, and stomach my needs.
Does your loyalty shake at my secret deeds as I do?
Would you judge me before I have finished my own story?
You've seen me, you don't look away.
Can I trust you?
For several years I woke in sweat that I murdered that boy under the north wall.
The weight on my heart was so heavy it would heave and vomit often.
Of the devil's family now; as the fantasies of a justified kill in Topeka made me just as weak and ill.
And to you men who fail in their hate, I am your voice.
Come on loyal woman, I think I that I can hear that wild ox moan.
