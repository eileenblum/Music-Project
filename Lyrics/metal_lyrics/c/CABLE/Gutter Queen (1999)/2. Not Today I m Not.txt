Not today i'm not
Said the greasy disgrace of a man
You're the biggest fuckin' loser in town, fuck.
Cheapest fuckin' hooker in town, fuck.

I can sell you a coke.
But you can't use my telephone.

I just want to get out of this place
Hell is in Missouri.

I've had my fill of coffee &amp; pills,
Give me another smoke.
If you only knew the nightmares i've had
While sleeping in your bed.

You can fuck your southern hospitality,
There's gotta be more than
One way to run to Georgia.
Gonna run those dogs through your heart.

Six dead in the delta
Six dead in the delta
Six dead in the delta
Six dead in the delta
Six dead in the delta
Six dead in the delta
