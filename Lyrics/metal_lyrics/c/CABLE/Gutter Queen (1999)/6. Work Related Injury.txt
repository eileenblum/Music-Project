Workin the night shift again
Got one more hour in me
Shouldn't be near these machines,
I'm askin' for trouble.
Didn't learn my lesson the first time.
Body crushin' machine
Body crushin' machine

Baby i'm in love
Baby i'm in love

You would look so good with bandages on your face...

I'm hurt again
I'm hurt again

Another cast, sew me up.
I'm out, fucked up again.

Send me to the therapist so i can spill my guts
I'm losing my mind in this place
The painkiller's wearin' off, get this boss off my back
I'm losing my mind in this place.
