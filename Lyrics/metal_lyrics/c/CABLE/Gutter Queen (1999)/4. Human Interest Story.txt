I'm a gamblin' man.
Every mintue, every second of my life.
Walking here's the easy part.
Miles from home in my piece of shit car.
Look at me, kiss my face.
It's all 50/50 and it can only get better from here.
Vegas- never-looked- this good.
...Twenty eight days in this steamhouse...
Another scumbag suicide
I'm wide eyed and snow blind
Waiting for the worst of it all to come.
Sold my soul here in the desert
And i'll be damned if i get it back any time soon.
This city's an eyesore among eyesores,
Looks like this round's on the house
So do me a favor and give me one last goodbye fuck.
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
Dying never looked this good.
