Desperate people makes desparate actions
When your view of life is from the bottom
Take what you will and you kill if you have to
In this world is there no justice
Is there no justice
Day in and day out
It's the same situation
Come out ahead by trusting no one
Heart beat decisions from the end of a bullet
Logic of the youth from a gun

[Bridge]:
Is there a method to this madness
Is there an ending? There must be a way

[Chorus:]
Half way down the drain
Nothing will ever change
Halfway down the drain
The story ends the same
A body waiting for a grave

Land of the free is the shit that they feed
Keep me down, I will fester
Never be soft when you live a hard life
Sorrow for others doesn't matter

[Bridge/Chorus]
