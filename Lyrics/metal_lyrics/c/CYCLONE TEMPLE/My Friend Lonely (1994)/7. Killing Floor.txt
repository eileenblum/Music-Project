A house of fire
Without the prayer for rain
Slay 'em one and all
That's the power of this game

At dawn they killed
To conquer and invade
Man, woman and child
Shipped away on death's crusade

[Bridge:]
You'd die to live
Forced to give
Straight between the eyes
You live to die

[Chorus:]
Why does man
Inflict his pain
Is it simply because he can
Is it the majority that will always rule
Or the color of the man
This is the Killing Floor
This is the Killing Floor

Dead pray for the living
'Cause they're the ones in hell
Lambs to the slaughter
Whisper not if you dare

[Bridge/Chorus]

Take the young ones
Of this inferior race
The futurethreatened by their hand

Destroy the old ones
The source of history
Let them not take a stand

Your body stamped
With the mark of the beast
Too weak from hunger
Too weak to cry
Stricken by maggots
That eat away your mind
Mutilate your soul
Then terminate by fire
Terminate by fire
Guns to the left
Guns to the right
Barbed wire fences
That say work or die

Damn the sunrise
It makes a New Day
Buried alive, right before your eyes
