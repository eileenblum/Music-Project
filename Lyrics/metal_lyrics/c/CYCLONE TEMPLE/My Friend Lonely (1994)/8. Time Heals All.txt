Time waits for no one and i've got none to waste
Like an old-time remedy slowly ease my pain
And if the hour were my friend
I'd undo all I've done
If the minute hand could understand
Just how far I've come

When I die before I take my last breath
Take me away 'cause only time
Can cure me of my pain, my rage

Should've would've could've done
Am I just the only one
Sometimes it feels this way
Should've would've could've done
And all things I meant to say
I meant to say

Take from me this precious thing
The thing that I need most
Makes the old and dying cherish it like gold
And if the hour hand were my friend?i would have no fear
What doesn't kill only makes you strong
And your hindsight very clear
