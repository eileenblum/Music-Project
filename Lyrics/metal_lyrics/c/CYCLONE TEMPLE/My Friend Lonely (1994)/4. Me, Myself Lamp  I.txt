Everytime you speak
Your insecurities shine
True signs of the weak
Do they think I'm blind
I hear the things you say
When you verbally crucify
It's you that drive each nail
With every spineless lie

[Bridge:]
It's always been me for me and only me
Bitterness and I go way back
Some find comfort in other's misery
Heaven't you heard, never bite the hand that feeds
I'll never turn my back on me
Because I know that I'm on my side
I'll be me until the end. Why can't they see
All I've got is me, myself, and I

[Chorus:]
Me, Myself, and
Me, Myself, and
Me, Myself, and I

[Chorus]

Hearing the laughter behind my back
Often makes me wonder
Try and raise above, but they're always pulling me down
So called friends, trying to pull me under

[Bridge/Chorus]

Has life forsaken me
Once blind, but now I see
Innocence stripped from me
The more you give, the more they feed
Never let them take away
The part of me that brings me peace
I'll never believe
I'll never trust
