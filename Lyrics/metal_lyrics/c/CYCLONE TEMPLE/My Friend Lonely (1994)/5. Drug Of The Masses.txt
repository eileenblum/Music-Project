This is the way to overcome your problems
The more you use the better you feel
Talk to the sky when you need an answer
It relieves all pain and guilt
Give all you have to put your mind at ease
One of the millions that blindly follow
Distorts your sights and make you believe
Words you recite control tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Washing out reality but it's only momentarily
These are the scriptures mankind has written
Who's to say heaven's above the sky
Should you believe because it's printed
Who's to say that hell is beneath the earth
Maybe we're already in it
Time effects man's perspective
Changes made to what's recorded
Is this the book we must follow
It will change again tomorrow
Drug Of The Masses
Drug Of The Masses

Rely on it for all your trouble, until it becomes a crutch
Get on your knees and bow your head
But does it really change much
Recite a prayer when it gets rough
When you're in over your head
When you pray it's done in vain
God helps those who help themselves

[Chorus]

Is there an afterlife
Did they return to tell you
Live your life for the next world
When tomorrow isn't promised to you
What about the time you still have
The time is now to strive
Because when you're dead and buried
Is when you find out that they've lied

Who's to say heaven's above the sky
Should you believe because it's printed
Who's to say that hell is beneath the earth
Maybe we're already in it
Drug Of The Masses
Drug Of The Masses
Drug Of The Masses
