Eighty-six the weak shit
We backs of the so-called hip
Button down your ego trip
'Cause you're tryin' to hard to stay in step

Jock the tip of those who move and shake
On a pedestak put those who reek of fake

Never walk in another man's shoes
You may not always win but you'll never lose
One man One mind One voice is all I am
I'll be myself think for myself 'cause this is who I am

Always one to follow no one
Always one to never bend
Set your clock by what's hot and what's not
Just like your shallow friends
