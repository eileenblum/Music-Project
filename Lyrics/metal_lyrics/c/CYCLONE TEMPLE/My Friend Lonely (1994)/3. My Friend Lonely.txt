She'll watch to see when I'm alone
She'll come if I cry
She'll come around when my hurt is to the bone
She can make a man wanna die

She knows when I swallow my pride
That's when she embraces me
And the pain in my heart is put there to remind
That she's my friend lonely

When the tears roll down my face
When my heart's but an empty space
She's my friend lonely
When the silence of being alone
Feels like a bittersweet welcome home
That's my friend lonely

She's there when others turn their backs
You don't want her but she's around
And like a home-sweet-home
She's there when you're alone
To make you feel lower when you're down

She hears what others don't hear
The things I think to myself
She'll hold your hand
When no one's there to understand
That's my friend lonely
