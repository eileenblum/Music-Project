I was always a loner because I think for myself
You never accepted me for me but why did you pretend
Why should I speak when no one ever listens to me
Inside I die misery my only friend

[Chorus:]
Why  Why  Why can't I be me
Why  Why  Smothered from reality
Scream  Scream  Someone listen to me
Scream  Scream  Pay attention to me

I will be what you want me to be  I will think what you want me to think
My reason for being only my parents to please
I'm not the perfect child you made me out to be
My problems my imperfections you never wanted to see

[Chorus]

Dear Mom and Dad,
I write this letter telling you
I am now free. It was your lack of
love and attention is what killed
me. So don't blame some heavy metal
record to cover your own neglect.
Your perfect picture turned fatal,
portrait not what you've come to expect

Each time I squeeze the trigger the pain slowly subsides
Put the gun to my own head now I too must die

Die  Die  Dying to be me
Why  Why  Smothered from reality
Scream  Scream  Someone listen to me
Scream  Scream  Pay attention to me

Eighteen years I've hurt in silence and now they ask why
Why did he snap  Why did he kill  He was always the perfect child
Live your life through me and telling me how to live
Sheltered from reality did anyone care how I felt
Five o'clock on the evening news child goes on a killing spree
Now I have your attention  Now you'll listen to me

[Chorus]
