Time after time you said you'd be there for me
But over and over your words ring of insincerity

[Bridge:]
These words that pass your lips
Often spoken but never meant
You hurt the ones you love
Am I the one that you love to hate
Say what you mean
And mean what you say

[Chorus:]
Why must I live in fear
Why must I hurt this way
Contemplating my every move
Insecure 'til your dying day
You inflict the pain
'Cause I'm the one that you call friend
Had enough of your foolish games
Just go  Just go away

I would walk a thousand miles if you asked me to
But why must I spend my whole life proving these things to you

[Bridge / Chorus]

How many times must I stand broken hearted
When will I ever learn
How many times must I fall to pieces
Everybody gets a turn

Time and time again
You're like an old black and white movie
It's all been done before
You're the same old song and dance
You're a tired old cliche
You know the end before it comes

Why must I live in fear
Why must I hurt this way
Contemplating my every move
Insecure 'til your dying day
You inflict the pain
'Cause I'm the one that you call friend
Had enough of your foolish games
This will end  This must end

If I had a dime for every time you said you loved me
I'd be a millionaire
But if I had a million for every time that you meant it
I'd be poor as hell

Never will I ever
Walk this road again
For as long as I live the love that I give
Won't be given up in vain

[Chorus]

Time after time you said you'd be there for me
How many times must I fall to pieces
Everybody gets a turn

Never will I ever walk this road again
But for as long as I live the love that I give
Won't be given up in vain

[Chorus]
