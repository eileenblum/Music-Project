Slamming the door
That echos through the cellblock
Nothing can I see
Guilty until proven innocent
Never again to be free

Deathrow is like one bullet in an empty gun
Pull the trigger
Hanging by a thread
So quiet I hear my thoughts aloud
Hate getting stronger

It's been so long
Since I've heard a human voice
Isolated
It's been years since I've seen the light of day
Slightly demented

Memories die  Bad blood flows
The love of man is gone
Emptiness reminds you well of the things that must
Come to end  Come to end

[Bridge:]
The tears I cry  The blood I bleed
The hell I feel  The hate within
I stand alone  Not always proud
But on my own  Nobody at me side

[Chorus:]
Silence so loud

I am innocent
I scream over and over
But no one hears me
I am the victim of a witch hunt
Oh god help me

I fear the truth won't be found
Locked up key thrown away
I'll be dead before they discover
I've been accused falsely

Darkness  Silence
My only friend
Solitary confinement
Is where I'll be until I'm dead

[Bridge / Chorus]

Lady Justice can you help me
I am indigent and can't pay your price
What about innocent 'til proven guilty
Or is it reserved for those with money and might
Is being poor punishable by law
While the rich plead guilty and go free
Only in the land of milk and honey
Can justice be sold from sea to shining --

[Chorus]
