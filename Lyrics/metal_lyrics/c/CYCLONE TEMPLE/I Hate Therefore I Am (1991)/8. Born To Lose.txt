As he yelled out to the sky
As a tear rained from his eye
Oh was I born to lose
Why does the color of someone's skin
Raise the fear that lurks within
That makes men hate as they do

[Bridge:]
Created equal so they say
When this was written
I was property not man
Growing bitter day by day
Battered but proud
I will defy until the end

Take a chance and cross the line
Met with resistance for what's rightfully mine
The strong take from the weak
And the wicked destroy the meek

[Chorus:]
Take a chance and cross the line
Ignorance breeds hatred and hatred is blind
The strong take from the weak
And the wicked destroy the meek
When you're born to lose

Born into a world
Where you're considered one of them
Tell me what can you do
equality is hypocrisy
Often spoken but seldom used

[Bridge / Chorus]

The pain  The pain
Never a day without it
The lies  The lies
Never a day I'm not reminded

Buried alive and no one hears you scream
The chains that bind you that no one ever sees
They fear my anger but they don't see my pain
Deep down inside me burns the rage
