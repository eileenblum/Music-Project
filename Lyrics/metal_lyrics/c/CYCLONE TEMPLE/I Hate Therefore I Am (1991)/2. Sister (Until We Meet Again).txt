I hear you call my name
I turn and you're not there
If these four walls could speak
They'd tell me what you felt
You cry yourself to sleep
A pain no one can share
Never felt such emptiness
This void's consuming me

[Chorus:]
I can't talk to you no more about my troubled thoughts
You seem so far away but always in my heart
No harm can come to thee  I've lost you to the dark
Until we meet again please forget me not

Sister I'm in pain

Did your heartbeat pound with each raindrop
As your blood was washed away
Why does it take the loss of someone
To make you value all you do and say

No yesterday
No tomorrow
Only memories and photographs
No sunlight
No rainbows
All that once was is now black

Memories run through my mind
Of the days gone by
What I felt was never said
Something only time could mend

Never seem to miss the well
Until the well runs dry
Why didn't I say it when I had the chance
So tragic how it ends

[Chorus]

Tomorrow never came  Yesterday is gone
Never to return  Like darkness gives to dawn
For you pain is just a word now
Time has no meaning
Never to return
Peacefully sleeping
