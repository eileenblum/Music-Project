Mosquitoes sting like lightning
Beams of mid-day burn my neck
A hundred miles behind me hear the cries of rapid breath
Yellow fever eats my brain
Soon the maggots prey
The final step before I fall and they shall have their way

[Chorus:]
Step by step 'cross burning sands
The jungle hears no prayers
Introduced to virgin eyes
A hell like none before

Some will live  Some will die
Are you proud soldier now
I am death reach out and take my hand
Pain solution here

The stench of death and weakness
The body count will rise
Those of us who cry for help thine eyes look toward the skies
March survivors crying out
In endless agony
Those of us left behind will pay through suffering

[Chorus]

Step by step I see
Inch by inch I bleed
Mile by mile I hunger
Killing all in my sight
Woman and child no mercy
Towards the enemy no feeling

Ironically I am captured
Now the enemy has no feeling
I'm on the losing side  I must suffer
Indestructible  We can never lose
Unbelievable  How they brainwash

The hunter's now the hunted

Oh what will become of me
I must hang on
Another day I must see
Oh is this a bad dream
I must be strong
Oh god help me
