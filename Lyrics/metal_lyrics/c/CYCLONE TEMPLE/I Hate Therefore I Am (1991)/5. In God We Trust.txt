The stage is set
Backdrop lit
Testing  One  Two  Three
Now don't forget when I wave my hand
Flash the price across the screen

And when I raise my eyes towards the heavens
Don't be late with the cue
And when I raise my fist I want a clap of thunder
Instilling fear is how I rule

[Bridge:]
Mindless people follow your master
Multitudes of lambs to the slaughter
Like lost children searching for an answer
While I feed on you like cancer

[Chorus:]
Can you feel me
Touch you  Heal thee
Almighty dollar gives me strength in power
In God We Trust

I am pure I have no faults
I am a man of truth
Take these words from this book
Interpret them for my use

[Bridge / Chorus]

Headlines rage
Followers divided
Tell them in whom they should believe

Pity me people
For I am only man
Never again will I deceive

Drunken scap fleecing his flock
They're with me all the way
My kingdom's done from what's become
Is it me or god that they praise
