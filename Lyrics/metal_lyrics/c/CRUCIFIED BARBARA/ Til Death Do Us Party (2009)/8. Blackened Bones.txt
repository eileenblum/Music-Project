I'm crucified, you left me hanging high
When all the blood is dry
There's nothing left but blackened bones
Nothing left but blackened bones

I saved your ass, so never ask for anything
You just bring me down,
I'm hanging here because of what you said

I'm sorry man
Who stepped on you?
Your self esteem
Is running low

When the hour is close to midnight you should fear
When I open up my eyes for the very last time
I forgive your act of anger, not your soul
'Cause I know it's black inside like my rotten bones
My blackened bones

I'm crucified, I'll be the first to see the sun
Looking down on you, I'm the shadow that follows
The stars you're reaching out for
Will never shine for you, but don't you blame it on me

I'm sorry man
Who stepped on you?
Your self esteem
Is running low

When the hour is close to midnight you should fear
When I open up my eyes for the very last time
I forgive your act of anger, not your soul
Cause I know it's black inside like my rotten and blackened bones

When the hour is close to midnight you should fear
When I open up my eyes for the very last time
I forgive your act of anger, not your soul
'Cause I know it's black inside like my rotten bones

When the hour is close to midnight
When I open up my eyes for the very last time
I forgive your act of anger, not your soul
Cause I know it's black inside like my rotten and blackened bones
My blackened bones

You, fear
My blackened bones
