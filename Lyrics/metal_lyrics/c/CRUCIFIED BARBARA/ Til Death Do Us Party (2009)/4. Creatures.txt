Something's weird inside my head
'Cos I hear the noises under my bed
Have I finally lost my mind
I'm afraid of what I might find
Someone's breathing up my neck
Cold meat is holding me down
Can't move I'm Parallyzed
I've never been so scared in my whole life
I Don't know what to do

Here they come
One by one
Can't fight the nightmare
Will they miss me when I'm gone

Here they come
One by one
Can't fight the nightmare
Will they miss me when I'm gone, here they come

Someone's staring right at me
Standing by my bed, making me shiver
can't breathe, I'm lost in time
I've never been so scared in my whole life
I don't know what to do

Here they come
One by one
Can't fight the nightmare
Will they miss me when I'm gone, here they come

Here they come
One by one
Can't fight the nightmare
Will they miss me when I'm gone, here they come
