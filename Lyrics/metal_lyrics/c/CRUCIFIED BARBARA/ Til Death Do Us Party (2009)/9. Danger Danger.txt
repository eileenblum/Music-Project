Danger, danger

Yeah I remember everything
I remember the gig and the pain in my neck
I opened a beer just to cool me down
Then I went straight to bed

I woke up like a princess on the floor
Already dressed and prepared in a makeup
My hair was a mess but it looked kinda cool
Me and my friends
We don't give a damn
Don't give a damn

Danger, danger
So you wanna hear
But I m pure like Cinderella
So if you wanna rock'n'roll
I won't be your alibi
No, I won't

Yeah I remember everything
I remember the voice calling my name
But I didn't wanna wake up them
And I'm old enough to decide for myself
I don't know why there's mud on a clothes
I'm sure there is an explanation
Every heard was to me/watching me
It must have been someone else - you say

Danger, danger
So you wanna hear
But I m pure like Cinderella
So if you wanna rock'n'roll
I won't be your alibi
No, I won't

I am a responsible girl
I don't wait up 'til the night comes alight
I am a responsible girl
So don't ask me again why
I slept on the floor

Danger, danger
So you wanna hear
But I'm pure like Cinderella
So if you wanna rock'n'roll
I won't be your alibi
No, I won't

Danger, danger...
