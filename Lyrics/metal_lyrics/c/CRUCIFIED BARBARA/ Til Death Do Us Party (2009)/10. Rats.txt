Give me a reason
For me to keep you alive
You know what you've done
Give me an answer
Why you're running on my backyard
Looking for a shag

You're in deep shit honey
Come on, look into my eyes and tell me who it was
Who sneaked round my lover
Trying hard
Enough's enough
I'll take you down

Rats on the table when the cat is gone
I can tell that you've been around
Rats on the table when the cat is gone

Give a reason, give me one sign
You have crossed the line now
You've been running on my backyard
Too many times

You're in deep shit honey
Come on, look into my eyes and tell me who it was
Who sneaked round my babe
Trying hard
Enough's enough
I'll take you down

Rats on the table when the cat is gone
I can tell that you've been around
Rats on the table when the cat is gone
I can smell a dirty little girl
Dirty little girl

Now tell me what are you doing in my way
Are you stupid enough to be standing still?
I can see that you've been around
The holes in my backyard
Is from a rat for sure

Give a reason
'Cos you're in deep shit honey
I'll take you down

Rats on the table when the cat is gone
I can tell that you've been around
Rats on the table when the cat is gone
I can smell a dirty little girl
I'll take you down

Rats on the table when the cat is gone [4x]
