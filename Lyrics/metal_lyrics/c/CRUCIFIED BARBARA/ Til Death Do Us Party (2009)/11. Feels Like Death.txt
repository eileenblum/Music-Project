All the chances I've got, it wasn't enough to give myself a nasty reputation
Got a hole in my head, got a big fat bed but notthing to do with all the leisure
Gotta go, gotta do anything to stay sane, I wanna be delighted
Now I'm talking to the wall, anything to kill the silence

It feels like death

All the feelings I killed, it wasn't enough to save myself from swallowing my tongue
And all I have is a pain in my darkest room and voices talking right behind me
Are they laughing at me I don't care I don't mind, I'll never be a victim
But now I'm standing on the edge, anything to kill the silence

Surrounded by the world
But in the end there's no one there

It feels like death [2x]

It's nothing I can run from
There's nowhere I can hide
When it feels llike death
It feels like death

All I'm asking for is one little thing to disappear from my head
Take away this rotten one, growing stronger
Taking over me

It feels like death
Feels like death

It's nothing I can run from
There's nowhere I can hide
When it feels llike death
It feels like death
When it feels llike death
