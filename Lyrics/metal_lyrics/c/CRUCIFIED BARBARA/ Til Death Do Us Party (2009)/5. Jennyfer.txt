Hey girl, you're beautiful, he said
But it turned out wrong again
He didn't mean to make you sad
He didn't know what you carry on your back

All the stones you've painted
With the colours of your sorrow, the black in your story
Will never fade, you'd better deal with it
Don't walk away

And it's a hard life to be a tough girl
But deep within, you're not mean

Jennyfer, it's a dirty kind of love
Jennyfer, you don't need it anymore
Jennyfer, let your heart have a rest
It's been broken
So many times before

I'm here for you, he said
But he couldn't carry all your fears
He didn't mean to let you down
But he couldn't stay to dry your tears
All the friends you turn to when the world's getting dark in the loneliest hour
It's all fake
You'd better run girl
Or you'll break

And it's a hard life to be a tough girl
But deep within, you're not mean

Jennyfer, it's a dirty kind of love
Jennyfer, you don't need it anymore
Jennyfer, let your heart have a rest
It's been broken
So many times before

Your heart's desire Is a long lost dream coming back
No words, no fear, no one
Could bring you down this time

Jennyfer It's a dirty kind of love
It won't break your heart
Just tear it apart
It's a dirty, dirty, dirty kind of love

Jennyfer, it's a dirty kind of love
Jennyfer, you don't need it anymore
Jennyfer, let your heart have a rest
It's been broken
So many times before

Jennyfer, it's a dirty kind of love
Jennyfer, you don't need it anymore
Jennyfer, let your heart have a rest
It's been broken
So many times before
So many times before...
