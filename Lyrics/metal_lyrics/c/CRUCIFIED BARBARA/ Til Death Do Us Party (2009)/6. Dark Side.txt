Feel my desire I have a dark side
And I won't let it out when you are around
I'm a maniac I killed him myself
Now I'll hunt you
Til you die on the ground

Open up the gates
Come out and play

Time to run
My dark side is coming for you
Tonight I can smell your fear
You better run
My dark side is coming for you
Come on and let me catch you

Sleep with the enemy for a last time
Cause what I need is something I can't control
I'm the animal you cannot escape
Cause I'm for real and so is the pain

Open up the gate I wanna play

Time to run
My dark side is coming for you
Tonight I can smell your fear
You better run
My dark side is coming for you
Come on and let me catch you

Feel my desire I have a dark side
And I won't let it out when you are around
I'm a maniac in need of a prey
And I will hunt you down
Come on and play
