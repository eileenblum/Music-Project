Welcome to the darkness
Tonight it's all yours
You can bring all your bullshit now
Let's kick in the door
You want to leave all this mess
But you're still stuck in the ground
You're running like a sinner
But you're too slow

Wasted like a piece of trash
A killer on his knees
Bang bang
It's coming for you
It hurts to fall when no one's there
To catch you

Do you know what divides you
From the rest of the pack
It's a lack of heart that turns your soul into black
You want to leave all this mess
But you're still stuck in the ground
You're running like a sinner
But you're too slow

Wasted like a piece of trash
A killer on his knees
Bang bang
It's coming for you
It hurts to fall when no one's there
To catch you

Lick the devil's ass
Divide your tongue in two
Come and watch the fire
Where you gonna burn

Wasted like a piece of trash
A killer on his knees
Bang bang
It's coming for you
It hurts to fall when no one's there
To catch you

Oh what I said
A killer on his knees
Bang bang
It's coming for you
It hurts to fall when no one's there
To catch you

A killer on his knees (wasted)
Wasted
Oh what I said
A killer on his knees
Bang bang
It's coming for you
Bang bang
It's coming for you

(killer on his knees)
killer on his knees
(killer on his knees)

Wasted
