He's a beautiful boy with the saddest eyes
Skinny legs and a rock n roll style
Sweet as sugar, hard as steel
We're the perfect match, we're the real deal

He's all I ever wanted
He's so much more
Can't handle love

I'm gonna break his heart
I don't want to but I do it so well
I'm gonna break his heart
I don't want to but I can't handle love

We headed through the hard times
Right from the start
But both of us had too many scars
He's a fighter, I'm afraid
It can't be good, gotta run away

He's all I ever wanted
He's so much more
Can't handle love

I'm gonna break his heart
I don't want to but I do it so well
I'm gonna break his heart
I don't want to but I can't handle love

I'm gonna fall apart again
Cause I can't handle love

I am the one to blame for all his tears
One day some girl will make him smile again

I'm gonna break his heart
I don't want to but I do it so well
I'm gonna break his heart
I don't want to but I can't handle love

I'm gonna fall apart again
Cause I can't handle love
