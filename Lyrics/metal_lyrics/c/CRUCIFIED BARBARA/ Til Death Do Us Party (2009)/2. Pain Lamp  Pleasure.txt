You tried to take a piece of me
A bite of my heart
But I was fast enough to see
Where we were heading
Everything you put me through
Right from the start
How could I believe in you?
Cos' I wasn't ready
All this pain and pleasure
All the games that you play
I won't take it no more
Get out of my way

Baby, you do what you want
Anytime that you like
But you don't do me

Baby, you do what you want
Anytime that you like
You don't do me

So much better off alone
Than stuck with you
Getting stronger now I know
I'm done pretending
All this pain and pleasure
All the games that you play
I won't take it no more
Get out of my way

Baby, you do what you want
Anytime that you like
But you don't do me, now

Baby, you do what you want
Anytime that you like
But you don't do me

I do no longer believe
In the white horse and the knight
Fairy tales are not for me
I rather stand up for my rights

One, two, three, four, c'mon, hey
Do not do with me

Baby, you do what you want
Anytime that you like
But you don't do me

Baby, just do what you want
Anytime that you like
