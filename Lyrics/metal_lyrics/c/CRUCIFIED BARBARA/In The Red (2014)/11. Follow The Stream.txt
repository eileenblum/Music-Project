Panic and despair, 
Can not breathe the air. 
Running from the smell of bodies in flames. 
Families torn apart, 
Damned from the start. 
Fighting for my life, 
But I can't get anywhere. 

Don't say you're sorry, 
Don't look away. 
Cold and hard you deny, 
So easy to live in a lie. 
Follow the stream like the others, 
Do what you have always done. 

Behind that secret door, 
There's blood on the floor. 
Screams from the past, 
Got stuck in the walls. 
Tell me I'll be fine, 
Say it's just a dream. 
Running for my life, 
But I can't get out of here. 

Don't say you're sorry, 
Don't look away. 
Cold and hard you deny, 
So easy to live in a lie. 
Follow the stream like the others, 
Do what you have always done. 

Cold and hard you deny, 
So easy to live in a lie. 
Just try to think for a moment, 
Don't take the easy way out. 
Follow the stream.
