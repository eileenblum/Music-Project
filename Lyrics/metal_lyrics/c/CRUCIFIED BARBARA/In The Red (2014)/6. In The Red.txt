Kickin' the gas and let the engine scream, 
It s time to get the party started. 
Lickin' dust with tires made of steel, 
The piece can't be parted. 

Feeling alive and out of control, 
There's no turning back. 
Giving it all, now the game is on, 
There's no turning back. 

Nothing can stop us now. 
Push it hard and make it loud. 

Let's go, 
In the red tonight. 
It started with a dream, 
A wish to excite. 
Crossing borders to hell and back, 
Heaven to be found in a guitar stack. 
Let's go, let's go. 

Put it together, 
watch the surface glow. 
When all the pieces are in place, 
Let it burn and let it overload. 
Can't be destroyed in any ways. 

Kicking the gas, turn it up, and scream, 
There's no turning back. 
The night is ours, come walk with me, 
There's no looking back. 

Nothing can stop us now. 
Push it hard and make it loud. 

Let s go, 
In the red tonight. 
We're rolling like a machine, 
Built to unite. 
Crossing borders to hell and back, 
Heaven to be found on a guitar stack. 
Let's go, let's go. 

Oh, don't be afraid it might get loud, 
But I won't hurt you. 
Oh, don't walk away it's just the sound, 
Of something true. 

Let's go, 
In the red tonight. 
It started with a dream, 
A wish to excite. 
Crossing borders to hell and back, 
Heaven to be found in a guitar stack. 
Let's go, in the red tonight. 
Let's go, in the red tonight.
