Once upon a time you had a sun in your mind, 
Everybody could see it shine. 
It made you glow like a star, 
Like a God among the city lights. Like a queen of rage, 

You'd spit in the face of men, 
Who tried to bring you down, 
While the good ones found their luck in your attention. 
The unholy ghost is loving your kind, 
Raping your mind, it walks right behind you. 

Whispers lies to make you go blind, 
Who's the one to blame for all the pain? 
Who think he's got the right, 
To say what you're not ok, 
The ghost inside you. 

Step by step it would break you down, 
Everybody could see you fade, 
Like a big mistake from the glamorous hights you fell, 
You hit the ground with a crash, 
Boom sound and everyone looked away. 
You're a stranger now that nobody wanna be around. 

The unholy ghost is loving your kind, 
Raping your mind it walks right behind you, 
Whispers lies to make you go blind, 
Who's the one to blame for all the pain? 
Who think he's got the right to say that you're not ok. 

The ghost inside, 
Don't believe a word, 
Don't be afraid, 
The voice is just a fake illusion, 
Born to lead astray. 
The ghost inside you. 
You've gotta bring back the fire, 
You've gotta learn to fly again, 
Cut the volume of the voices in your head. 

You've gotta tell yourself, 
To get back on your feet. 
Get back there, 
Be the one we desire. 
Who's the one to blame for all the pain? 
Who think he's got the right to say that you're not ok. 

The ghost inside you, 
Don't believe a word. 
Don't be afraid, 
The voice is just fake illusion, 
Born to lead astray. 
The ghost inside you.
