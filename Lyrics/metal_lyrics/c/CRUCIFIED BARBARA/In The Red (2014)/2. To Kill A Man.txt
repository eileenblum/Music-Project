Theyâre too young to either vote or marry
It didnât stop his dirty hands
He destroyed their bodies and minds
Theyâre beaten down, but he still stands

My sisters went under
I wonder how it feels

To kill a man
Empowered by the fear
I know I can
Find so many ways

He walks among us, just a common stranger
Living, laughing, could be anyone
But heâs evil, he means danger
Uses his power as a loaded gun

My sisters went under
I wonder how it feels

To kill a man
Empowered by the fear
I know I can
Find so many ways
Man, empowered by the fear

I know I can
Find so many ways
To kill a man
Iâll find so many ways
I know I can
One for every tear
I kill
