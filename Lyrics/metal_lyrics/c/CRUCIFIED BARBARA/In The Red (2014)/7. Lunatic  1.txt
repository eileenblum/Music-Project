Ready for the game
I'm standing right beside you
We aim for the same
Pleasure and fame
I know we're gonna make it
It's just a matter minutes
'Till we're high up in the sky

Waiting for the sign
That will make you explode
Make us run fast and rule the world
I bet on you tonight
Cause you'll never let me down
Are you ready for the take off
Ready for the rush

Heading for the stars
Making the dream come true
We can go far
I'm giving it all for you
You'll always be my lunatic number 1

Everybody scream
We're made to rumble
Let the game begin
Spit adrenaline
Here to run fast
Let's bring the thunder
Are you ready for the take off
Ready for the rush

Heading for the stars
Making the dream come true
We can go far
I'm giving it all for you
You'll always be my lunatic number 1

Heading for the stars
Making the dream come true
We can go far
I'm giving it all for you
For every step we take
For all that we've been through
You'll always be my lunatic number 1

Number 1, number 1, number 1, number 1, yeah!
