You say I'm good for being a girl
Not sure I'm in it for real
For years I proved you wrong
Then you say I'm getting too old

Can't hear you now
I'm sorry, we're playing too loud

I sell my kids for rock n' roll
Sex, late nights and alcohol
What a dirty woman
You think it's true, don't you
Think about it one more time
I'm just a player in a band
That's what I do
Living the dream, not you

You wonder how we get along
Find the time to write any songs
You think we're busy painting our nails
And all the things we girls gotta do

Can't hear you now
I'm sorry, we're playing too loud

I sell my kids for rock n' roll
Sex, late nights and alcohol
What a dirty woman
You think it's true you don't you

Think about it one more time
I'm just a player in a band
That's what I do
Living the dream, not you

I'm just a player in a band
Think about it one more time

I sell my kids for rock n' roll
Sex, late nights and alcohol
What a dirty woman
You think it's true, don't you

Think about it one more time
I'm just a player in a band
That's s what I do
Living the dream, not you

I sell my kids
I sell my kids
I sell my kids for rock n' roll
