It's burning hot
I've got a wicked feeling
I don't know what to do
How can I get to you
I've made mistakes
Forgot what I believed in
I carry all my sins
Right underneath the skin

Oh...tonight's the night
I can see the sign

Electric, electric, electric sky
Electric, electric, electric sky

It hurts a lot to stop a heart beating
No matter what I do
It always breaks in two
Pieces of mistakes
Bad luck and desire
I've been to funerals
And you don t wanna know
Come on be wild
I won't stick around
Tonight is once in a lifetime

Oh, close your eyes
Let me take the lead
Oh, tonight s the night
I can see the sign

Electric, electric, electric sky
Electric, electric, electric sky

I see you across the room
I wanna stay by your side
But it 's calling

Electric, electric, electric sky
Electric, electric, electric sky

If you don't need this
If you don't t want me now
I'd say it's a shame
But baby it's alright

Uh, tonight's the night
I can make you shine

Oh, 'cause tonight's the night
Can't you see the signs
In the sky

Electric, electric, electric sky

I see you across the room
I wanna stay by your side
But it's calling

Electric, electric, electric sky
