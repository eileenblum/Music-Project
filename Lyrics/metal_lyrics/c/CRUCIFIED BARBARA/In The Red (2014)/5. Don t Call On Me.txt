You'd better move back in your time machine.
Gotta make things right if you still want me.
If you're going down, if you got the need,
Go write another song about feeling alone.

Don't call on me,
I'm over you now.
Don't call on me,
I've got another.
I will never come back,
To you are heading for a fall,
Don't follow,
Don't call on me,
Call on me,
Call on me.

You're whining all the time like a new born child,
Like a man with the flu that's just like you.
Grow up and get it on.
I'm not by your side.
Go write another song,
'Cause I ain't going home.

I'm over you now,
Don't call on me.
I've got another,
I will never come back to,
You are heading for a fall.

Don't follow,
Don't call on me.
Call on me,
Call on me,
Don't call on me.
I will never come back to,
You are heading for a fall.

Don't follow,
Don't call 'cause I never gonna love.
You can't hurt me anymore.
Don't follow,
Don't call on me.
Call on me,
Call on me,
Don't call on me.
