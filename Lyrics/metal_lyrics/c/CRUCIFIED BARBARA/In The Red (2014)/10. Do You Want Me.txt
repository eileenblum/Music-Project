Don't be sad I treat you all the same, 
I'll be gone before you know my name, 
Always, 
I promise everything but don't trust me. 
You can't get close enough, 
You can't be safe you see. 

I don't need no prison. 
I feel alive because, 
The night is on me. 
Do you want me? 

Don't you wish that you could take me home, 
Make me yours and watch us growing old. 
Oh no, I belong to strangers every night, 
I can't give up the things that make me feel so fine. 

I don't need no prison. 
I feel alive because, 
The night is on me. 
Do you want me? 
I can never be you sacred angel. 
Do you want me? 
Do you want me? 
I'm trouble, you're in danger. 
Do you want me? 
Stay away from me. 

'Cause, I don't need no prison. 
I feel alive because, 
The night is on me. 
Do you want me? 
I can never be you sacred angel. 
Do you want me? 
Do you want me? 
I'm trouble, you're in danger. 
Do you want me?
