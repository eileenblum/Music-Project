There's no forever
Times are changing
It used to be my lie
To keep myself on the good side

I'm walking in circles
Can't find my way out
It all looks the same
I gotta keep on straight ahead
I need to be brave

I got lost in a dark place
I'm in the shadows
I got lost in the wrong trail
I'm in the shadows

What if i stay here
So I can't be found
If I close the door
Nothing can hurt me anymore

Don't need no prayers
To keep me bound
I don't need no light
All I used to fear is shining so bright

I got lost in a dark place
I'm in the shadows
I got lost in the wrong trail
Can't get out of here
I hide in the wilderness
I'm in the shadows

I feel in love with a dark place
I'm in the shadows
I got lost in the wrong trail
Can't get out of here
I hide in the wilderness
I'm in the shadows

I'm in the shadows
