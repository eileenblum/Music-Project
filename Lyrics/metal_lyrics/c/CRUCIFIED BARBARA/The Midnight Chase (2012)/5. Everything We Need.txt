oh what a perfect night
Crowd is hot
And the music is alright, is alright
We're on the go
No time to chill
The beat is on
A countdown to the thrill

We'll never stop
No
To turn it up
Yeah

Everything we need
Everything is what we got
Everything we want
Is already here

It's time to let it out
It's time to unleash the wild
Everything we do
We do it for you

If you are feeling low
Remember the good times
And let that feeling grow
Let it grow

Put on that song and dream along
Make it real
The countdown to the thrill

We'll never stop
No
To turn it up
Yeah

Everything we need
Everything is what we got
Everything we want
Is already here
Yeah

It's time to let it out
It's time to unleash the wild
'Cause everything we do
We do it for you

Everything we need
Everything is what we got
Everything we want
Is already here
Yeah

It's time to let it out
It's time to unleash the wild
Everything we do
We do it for you

Everything we do
Everything we do
Everything we do
We do it for you
