You were gone so long last night
Where the hell have you been, what have you done
The smell of something raw and nasty
You silence tells me all I need to know

What can you say
Itâs all over town now
Baby, donât explain
Just make it go away

Lie, or shut your mouth
Lie, or shut your mouth
Turn back time, turn it upside down
Fake it âtil I donât remember, Iâm begginâ you
Lie, or shut your mouth

I tried so hard but I wasted time
While you did a good job making a mess
Into the fire, innocence is gone
Betrayed for lust, watch us going down

What do you want me to say
Itâs all over town now
Baby, donât explain
You canât save this round

Lie, or shut your mouth
Lie, or shut your mouth
Turn back time, turn it upside down
Fake it âtil I donât remember, Iâm begginâ you
Lie, or shut your mouth
