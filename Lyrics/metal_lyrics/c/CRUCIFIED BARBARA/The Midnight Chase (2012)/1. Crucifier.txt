You close your eyes and pick a target for the night
Just to still your hunger before daylight
You take a bite, you spit it out and walk away
Do you ever wonder why it always taste the same
Youâre already dead

I am the crucifier
I am the crucifier
You made me what I am
The moment you stabbed me in the back
Sweet revenge will come

There was a time when I was innocent and pure
Now Iâm in front of you, blinded by madness
Iâm breaking bad, Iâm nothing like before
Youâve done me wrong, and I wonât take it anymore
Youâre already dead

I am the crucifier
I am the crucifier
You made me what I am
The moment you stabbed me in the back
Sweet revenge

There was a time when I was innocent
There was a time when I was pure
Far away from trouble, far away from you
There was a time when I was innocent
There was a time when I was pure
I learned my lesson, Iâm no longer insecure
Youâve done me wrong, and I wonât take it anymore
Youâre already dead

I am the crucifier
I am the crucifier
You made me what I am
The moment you stabbed me in the back
Sweet revenge will come
