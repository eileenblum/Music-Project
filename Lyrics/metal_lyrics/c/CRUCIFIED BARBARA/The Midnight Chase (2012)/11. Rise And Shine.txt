Theyâre all standing in a line
Waiting for the sign
Wondering who is next
To find glory and success

They wonât look me in the eye
âCause they now that any day
Theyâll might have to push me down
âCause Iâm standing in their way

Walking over bodies to be the one in the lead
There is no excuse, no regrets, just greed

I wonât follow
The ones that bring me down
Who sacrifice it all
Cross the line to rise and shine
I wonât follow
Iâll walk the other way

As they sacrifice it all
Cross the line to rise and shine

Theyâre standing in the line
Dying to fit in
The fucked up humankind
Wonât stop for anything

Walking over bodies to be the one in the lead
There is no excuse, no regrets, just greed

I wonât follow
The ones that bring me down
Who sacrifice it all
Cross the line to rise and shine
I wonât follow
Iâll walk the other way
As they sacrifice it all
Cross the line to rise and shine
