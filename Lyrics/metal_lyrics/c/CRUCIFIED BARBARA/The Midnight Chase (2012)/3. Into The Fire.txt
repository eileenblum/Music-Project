I am your fantasy, the essence of your dreams
I like to play it hard, Iâm everything you need
You dream of sanity, of love and pleasant times
But Iâm not here for you, no that would be a lie

Donât you tell me how to do things
Donât you try to kill my flame

Into the fire
Donât steal my thunder
Iâm wild, Iâm crazy
Watch me running
Into the fire
Can you feel the heat
Iâm wild, Iâm burning
Watch me running free

I am the perfect catch, the spirit of the night

But I do not agree on what you think is right
You want me to shut up, smile and blink my eye
But Iâm not here for you, no that would be a lie

No mansâ sweetheart
Pleasinâ who I want but hey donât tell me how
You can start a fire, I can blow it out
I ainât gonna feed your flame
Iâm always burning brighter than you

Into the fire
Donât steal my thunder
Iâm wild, Iâm crazy
Watch me running
Into the fire
Can you feel the heat
Iâm wild, Iâm burning
Watch me running free
