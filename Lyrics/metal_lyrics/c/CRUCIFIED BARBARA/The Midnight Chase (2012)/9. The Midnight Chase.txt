Itâs time for the midnight chase,
I canât hide any longer, itâs in front of me
Itâs time, to rise and shine,
Iâm on the front line now, gotta let it loose
Whoâs breathing down my neck,
tryinâ to hunt me down
I wonât let no loser steal my crown

I push it to the limit, heading for the top
Iâve gotta to let it out, now or never

Run, Iâve gotta Run
The adrenaline rush is all that I need
Run

Itâs hard to measure the speed of light, with a human eye
But I try, to make things right
and in time Iâll conquer you
I need to do it faster, I gotta get away
I wonât let nobody hold me down

I push it to the limit, heading for the top
Iâve gotta to let it out, now or never

Run, Iâve gotta Run
The adrenaline rush is all that I need
Run

Itâs time to erase the past,
I wonât turn around, no I wonât look back
Itâs time for the final round,
Iâm in the front line now, gotta let it loose

I push it to the limit, I ainât gonna stop
Iâve gotta to let it out, now or never

Run, Iâve gotta Run
The adrenaline rush is all that I need
Run
