I left my world for you
I came to save you from the fire
And Iâll hold you close, angel eyes
I will never let you down

Count me in Iâm going anywhere, Iâll be there
Count me in Iâm going anywhere for you

If they try to lay their hands on you, or take you away
I promise that Iâll hide you under ground
But donât be scared, angel eyes
No I wonât let nobody get to you

Count me in Iâm going anywhere, Iâll be there
Count me in Iâm going anywhere, for you

I wonât let go âcause I know
Iâm the only one who can
Save you now, angel eyes
I can never set you free

Count me in Iâm going anywhere, Iâll be there
Count me in Iâm going anywhere, for you
