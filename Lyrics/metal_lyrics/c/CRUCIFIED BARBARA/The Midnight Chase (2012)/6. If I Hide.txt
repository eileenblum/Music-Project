I come from a cold and dreary part of our town
Where they teach you how to fit in, how to be no one
But I never did it right, never got the reasons why
Always longing for an ally, to get me through the night

Then you came, like a windfall
Blew the misery away forever
For the first time, I was someone
We were meant to be

If I hide, would you look for me
If I fall, would you catch me
Would you bring the light, when itâs polar night
What if I hide, what if I hide

They always said I think too much,
to wipe the black from my eye
You taught me how to nevermind,
to be free and how to fly
Talking every night and day,
we made our own secret world
Where we could be anything,
we didnât care we were unheard
You took my hand, you led me right
I wish that it could last forever
For the first time, I am someone
Are we meant to be?

If I hide, would you look for me
If I fall, would you catch me
Would you bring the light,
when itâs polar night
What if I hide, what if I hide
