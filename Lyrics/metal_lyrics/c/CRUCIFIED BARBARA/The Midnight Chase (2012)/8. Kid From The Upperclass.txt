I was fighting for you
So hard to understand
âCause baby you donât shine
When youâre crying like a dog, beg me to forgive
A lie behind every corner
To make me sleep at night
Donât you think that Iâve noticed
Everything about you is changing

Boy you are spoiled like a kid from the upperclass
Dance with the girls in the line if thatâs what you wanna
Boy you are spoiled like a kid from the upperclass
Please donât waste the time of my life just because you can

Yeah it was hard to handle
You never broke the news
I was the last to know
Now youâre crying like a dog, beg me to forgive
I used to think you were special
So much more than me
But baby you donât shine
When everything about you is changing
Everything about us is dead

Boy you are spoiled like a kid from the upperclass
Dance with the girls in the line if thatâs what you wanna
Boy you are spoiled like a kid from the upperclass
Please donât waste the time of my life just because you can

I used to think you were special
So much more than me
But baby you donât shine

I was fighting for you
Now I leave you behind
âCause baby you donât shine
When everything about you is changing,
Everything about us is dead

Boy you are spoiled like a kid from the upperclass
Dance with the girls in the line if thatâs what you wanna
Boy you are spoiled like a kid from the upperclass
Please donât waste the time of my life just because you can
