I donât wanna be with the one whoâs causing all this trouble
But I can not really help myself
No I canât fake it, âcause when you walk in through the door
I get all messed up, yeah I loose it

Everytime you touch me, I shiver to the bone
As a part of the game, that you canât play alone

Rock me like the devil
Whip your tail and turn me on
You turn me to eleven
Leave me burning when youâre done

I wish I never heard about the ones you call adventures
I guess Iâm part of those
But I canât help it, âcause when youâre playing
With my mind
I gotta have you, thereâs no other

Everytime you touch me, I shiver to the bone
As a part of the game, that you canât play alone

Rock me like the devil
Whip your tail and turn me on
You turn me to eleven
Leave me burning when youâre done
Rock me like the devil
