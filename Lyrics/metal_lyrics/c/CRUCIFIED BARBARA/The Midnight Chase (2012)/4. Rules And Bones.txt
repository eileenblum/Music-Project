Nothing is real
What have we become
I can not feel
Letâs gather up, itâs time to fight

Rules and bones are made to be broken
Follow the trail to the outlaw ocean
See the leaders fall
Crashing into the wall of mayhem

I used to cry alone âtil you opened up my eyes
All the damn lies, made us choose sides
We used to be jaded but we turned it to hatred

Rules and bones are made to be broken
Follow the trail to the outlaw ocean
See the leaders fall
Crashing into the wall of mayhem

Liars corrupt to the bone
In the war against truth youâll be on your own
âCause we are here now and weâre ready, ready to rule
We are here to fight for the right thing
The kind ones gone cruel

Rules and bones are made to be broken
Follow the trail to the outlaw ocean
See the leaders fall
Crashing into the wall of mayhem
