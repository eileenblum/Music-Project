You rock my world

I was amazed by this beautiful thing
Guess I was blind by his show
I was just a part of his stupid game
The player has gone insane

[Chorus:]
He's a rock'n'roll bachelor straight from hell
Posing like a fool with a devil's grin
He was under my skin like a fucking snake
Then I knew his heartbeats were fake

Motherfucker
Shouldn't play with me
You'll get burned 'cause
I rock the world tonight

[Chorus]

Check him out, you can have him
He will please you baby like you've
Never been pleased
Check him out, you can have him
'Cause he's nothing but a nice
Tight blue jeans ass to me

He had the coolest guitar
He wrote me beautiful songs
But he lost it all tonight

[Chorus]
