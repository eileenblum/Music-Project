[Pre Chorus]:
But you don't get it
I don't care
Yo, baby

[Chorus]:
You're losing the game again
You're all out of coins

You've lost the game

I wasn't born like this
No - I worked so hard
The blood and sweat that I put in
Is the title on my card

[Chorus]

Come on yeah
You don't get it
I don't care
Yo, baby - you've lost the game

You suffocate me with your bad attitude
You're like a lifetime of disease
I said: Hey babe cut it out
I'll never do it as you please

[Pre chorus]
[Chorus x2]
