Fuck desire, I was born to fall

You took me to a level where I've never been
Reaching even higher everytime we sinned
I'm the one to blame 'cause you were
Heaven sent
I'm the one to blame

[Chorus:]
So watch me now
As I'm going down
I've never been this low
Yeah I'm bleeding for you

Baby come and save me
I'm such a mess
Help me inhale now
I'm going down

Every story has to end so I told you
We can only be friends and then I ran away
I'm the one to blame 'cause you were heaven sent
I'm the one to blame

[Chorus]

(I've never been this low)

[Chorus]
