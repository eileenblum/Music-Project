Tough luck honey, I don't care

[Chorus:]
Hide your boyfriend (he's hot)
Hide your girlfriend (she's so foxy)
Hide 'em all, babe

I'm a bad thing, I'm sorry that I made you cry
Now you tell me you'll never forget my crime
Tough luck honey, I don't care

Yeah, I'm a bad thing, I take your breathe and then your friends
I like to scare the shit out of you at night
I'm the darkness of the world

[Chorus]
