I've got my rock'n'roll in your fucking face
Your fucking face, you're so sweet and
I can't breathe now, you're coming closer
So much closer

It's the smell of your heart
When it's breaking apart
But you like to rock'n'roll and
You know I want it all

[Chorus:]
Hey hey hey, come a little closer
Hey hey hey, feel me
Give it to me
Lick up the limelight, the taste of my stage
Come on babe, do it
Give it to me

So you're back, I can't believe it
You're so damn cute
I need a cowboy from hell
And you are not, you are not
Oh man, you can't breathe now
When true life strikes you
True life strikes you

It was never meant to be so good for you
But you like to rock'n'roll and
You know I want it all

Watch your back...
I'll hunt you down down
Give it to me... give it to me
Come on baby, do it
Give it to me
