It was a bad, bad smell that hit me like a bullet straight up my nose
It was a joke
It made me laugh
And then I realised-No!

Oh yeah I felt I really had to go
Before embarrassment was a fact
I could have killed, killed for a moment alone
One moment alone

Oh no, I'm getting wet
I wet myself, oh no...
...but it's too late now...

It was some minute I will never forget
It was a lifetime of pain
Thought I was doing well
Until the female from hell went up by my side

She said: I'm not sure I'm glad you're here
It looks like you're getting wet somewhere
She said: Get out of my house
Before you ruin my fucking carpet

Oh yeah! I felt that it was time to go
But there was something I wanted to do
So I said: hey guys, I wet my pants
And it's fun, you should try it too

Oh yeah, I'm getting wet
I wet myself, oh yeah
