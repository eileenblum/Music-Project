I've got five more drinks to finish before
The night is back again and I'm ready for more

1, 2, 3, 4, five more give me some more [x2]

[Chorus:]
I've got a bad hangover
World is turning upside down
I'll never go there again, where I just been
Bad hangover
Oh man, next time I'll stay sober
I've got a bad hangover
Feeling like shit 'cause the devil's
On my shoulder

I don't know who I am and I don't know
Where I've been
I woke up with my boots on in a bottle of gin
I've been beatin' and kickin'
Both my hands are sore
I've been under the influence of bad alcohol

1, 2, 3, 4, five more give me some more [x2]

[Chorus]
