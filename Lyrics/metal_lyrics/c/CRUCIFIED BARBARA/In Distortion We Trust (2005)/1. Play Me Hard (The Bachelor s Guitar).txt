You pull my strings
Then you wonder why they always break
You hand me over to your friends, it's always
When you're drunk
You're such an ass

Now hear this:
Treat me nicer, or your baby will go insane
I'm so out of tune, soon the feelings is
Forever gone

Then you'll regret the things you've done to me
When your vintage baby's calling
Come, come on, come on

[Chorus:]
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
I know you can't resist me,
In the end I am the one
Come on, come, come on and play me hard

You're so bad, and the story's just the same
I hate your stupid songs and when you play them on me
Come on, come on, come on

[Chorus:]
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
I know you can't resist me, in the end I am the one
The one who sleeps in your bed when all your girls are gone

Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard

You're treating me like shit, but you can not destroy me
I am all that you've got, I'm on top

I know you can't resist me, in the end I am the one
The one who sleeps in your bed when all your girls are gone

[Chorus]
