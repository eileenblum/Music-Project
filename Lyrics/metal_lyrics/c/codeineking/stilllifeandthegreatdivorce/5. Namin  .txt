the night is silent except for the distant train of thought running through my mind.
I wonder why I'm awake, listening to the barely audible memories of you and me.
I miss the way you looked at me, so amused when I tried so desperately to fall asleep.
the little things just bore their way into my soul and tear me apart endlessly... this pain has no self control

everything falls back to me, the poisoned tree has bloomed the fruit of decay.

you told me I was your sun, when your eyes clung to the stars... a constant reminder that I was never enough.
this light pollution saves me from the pain of looking up to the sky and remembering everything.
like how we stood ten feet apart, blanketed in silence,
finally past the point of talking ourselves through this heartbreak.
the emptiness in the sky is eating me alive, you were the moon that guided me so gently through the fucking night.
through the night.
you were the moon that guided me so gently...

everything falls back to me, the poisoned tree has bloomed the fruit of decay.

everything I touch always turns to stone, everything I love always leaves these shaking bones.
these shaking bones, they crumble.
