[feat. Ro Han of I Built the Sky]a slave to this hysteria, losing touch with what it's like to feel human,
I've been pieced together from crack rocks and heroin... I guess I'm gonna need help.
the sky above me can't be recognized, through this haze of crystallised demise.
I've got nothing to live for, but the love of being sick.

every time I fight back, I always start to relapse,
burn the foil and the black has got my eyes rolling back.
what a perfect tragedy, it has taken over me.
a constant back and forth, a fucking love and hate,
always down for my queen but I think she fucking hates me.

I was once the sun in her eyes, but now I'm just a long dead star that's been fucking hollowed out.
it's been ages since the heart in my chest has given me any warmth to live with,
my limbs have become atrophied and numb.

I can't even pull my face off the floor, I'm at the point where it might not even fucking matter anymore,
I've spent my life reaching for the hand that will lead me to my grave and whisper in my ear,
"just dig, build your home in the earth... just dig, make your bed with the worms writhing underneath our feet."

I see a fire in her eyes, a beacon shining in the night... a lure drawing me closer to the end of my life,
I found bliss in your lie.
I've got nothing to live for but the love of being sick,
I've got nothing to live for, so I'll just fucking dig

I breath you in... my addiction gets it's fix
