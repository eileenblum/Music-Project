Blackened, black as one can be
The one and only mentor leaves me be
Blackened, I can not resist
Fill my heart and sou! with the antichrist

Black, black, call me by my name
A silent, smile upon my lips and hen
You suck 'em, suck 'em in your brain
The spell is broken and I have to

Obey, obey, obey, obey
You touch the flame, ha, ha
Betray, betray, betray, betray
It's all in me, it's all in me, all in me

YOU DONA GIMME MORE, GOTTA
GIMME MORE,
GOTTA, GOTTA GIMME MORE,
DONA GIMME MORE, MORE
GOTTA GIMME MORE, GOTTA
GIMME MORE,
GOTTA, GOTTA GIMME MORE,
GOTTA GIMME MORE

Black, black, I live in a flame
I feel no fear, no hurt, a forgot to pray
Demon, I'm intoxicated
Break the law and then you have to
Obey, obey, obey, obey

YOU GOTTA GIMME MORE...

Black, black, I hear no word you say
Deaf and dumb I feel the beast in me
Reflections, on my passing live
A foolish child, the one that is next to die

YOU GOTTA GIMME MORE...
