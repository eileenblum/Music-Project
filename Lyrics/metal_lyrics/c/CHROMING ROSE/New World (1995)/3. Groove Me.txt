Welcome to this sink of iniquities
You may stay there anytime you want it
Welcome to this pleasure dome

And you will never say goodbye
Have a good time
And I know you feel alright
Stay inside and groove me

I know you've had a really good time
And now you're waiting for the flat-line
You think it's time to fade away
It's the groove of your decay

Trapped inside this state of self-delusion
Paralysed
You're passing second level
You may stay forever

'Cause I can see you're shaping well
You don't care about tomorrow anyway
Stay inside and groove me

I know you've had a really good time
And now you're waiting for the flat-line
You think it's lime to fade away
It's the groove of your decay

Welcome to this private state of terror
Dead inside
A living human dummy
Now you stay forever

And their grinning makes you frown
Have a good time
And know it takes you down
Groove me, groove me, baby

I know you've had a really good time
And now you're waiting for the flat-line
You think it's time to fade away
It's the groove of your decay
