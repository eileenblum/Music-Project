Call my name beside your own grave
The demon in me will listen
I'll follow you everywhere you go
It's in me and I can't resist it

You got me - out of my mind
You got me - back, 'cause l'm blind
You got me - out of my way
You got me - back, fuck you

Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT
Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT

Now that I am ready to obey
Your lips start to whisper spells
A devilish smile's upon your face
Your abolished greed has kissed me

You got me - out of my mind
You got me - back, 'cause l'm blind
You got me - out of my way
You got me - back, fuck you

Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT
Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT

You're the one to fill my heart and soul
With a spirit I've never dreamed of
I swallow the poison out of your mouth
I'll drown in these wanton floods

You got me - out of my mind
You got me - back, 'cause l'm blind
You got me - out of my way
You got me - back, fuck you

Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT
Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT

You seem so strange
You weird thing
And that's why
I can't let you go away

You got me - out of my mind
You got me - back, 'cause l'm blind
You got me - out of my way
You got me - back, fuck you

Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT
Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT
Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT
Impertinent, deliverant, imperious
UNKIND PIECE OF SHIT
