All the memories, deep inside
All the thoughts, of times I left behind
Weight on my shoulders
Can I face the things undone
And turn around and watch the way behind

Well, everybody knows
That the only way to see the light is
Get the truth, oh yeah, get the truth
Oh yeah, get the truth, get the truth
Get it all out.
We don't have to cry
The ship is sailing
FAR FROM NOWHERE
Oh baby, get the truth, oh yeah,
Get the truth, get the truth, get it all out,
We don't have to cry
The ship is sailing
FAR FROM NOWHERE

Some said the way to reach the goal
Is never found by them who want to know
Where all comes from
Where do we go to, when's the time
When do we pay me price for all our crimes

Well...

FAR FROM NOWHERE

The one to speak the final word
Can be forgive as we were told, as we were told
Pass your sentence on our lives
Remind me 'cause it wasn't meant to be bad

Well...
FAR FROM NOWHERE

I see tears tn the night
Whsn the dragon is screaming
You don't have to cry
The ship's ain't sailing nowhere
Tears in the nfght
When the dragon screams
You don't have to cry
The ship is sailing
FAR FROM NOWHERE
