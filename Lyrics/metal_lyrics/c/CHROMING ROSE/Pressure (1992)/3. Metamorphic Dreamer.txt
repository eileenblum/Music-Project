I'm not here
And world's waking up
I can see
Beyond the golden doors
No sense of time
No walls to touch
Now what I feel
Transformation's
Turnin' wheels
She is there
She is in my wildest dreams
Metamorphic dreamer
In my dreams
Like a mirror of my life
What I see
Each time I go there
In your world
I can follow anywhere
I please
There's no limits to livin'
Living in my dreams
