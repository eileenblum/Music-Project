In the black of the night
You find snake and his boys
Sneakin' around
Now don't get in this way
'Cause everyone knows
He'll bring a good man down
When the city lights
Turn into the night
He makes his own law
He's the worst bad boy
They ever saw
Killing heard for time
Takin' a life for nickel or dime
You can hear'em now
A message clear and loud
The snake is out
And somewhere in his heart
He'd like to turn around
And make a brand new start
He'll always be the same
He doesn't know how to change
And now they call him insane
