Now picture the world
The mountains, the oceans
And the rivers
Reflect and round
Untouched by no man now
Times have changed
Now everything looks old today
Cold black rain
Is turning that picture to grey
Now look at New York
The buildings and canyons
Made of steel
Ain't man really great
As big as nature - it seems
Times have changed
And nothing is gonna be left
Cold black rain
Is falling we gonna get wet
In the skyline of the world
The mountains
The deserts are going -
Going - gone
It was our only one
Now look what we've done
A billion years
Are almost lost and gone
Now back to the life
Where oceans and skies
Never ended
Where air is for free
And water is clear once again
Times have changed
Now everything looks old today
Cold black rain
