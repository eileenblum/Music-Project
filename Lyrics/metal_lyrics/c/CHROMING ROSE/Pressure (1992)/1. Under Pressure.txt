Out in the desert
Cold and heat
Vultures over you
Almost feel like a defeat
But you gotta be strong
Situations in daily life
To face the sh*t around you
You need a lot of drive
If you wanna change it
Then shout it out
Under pressure, no more power
Decisions must be made
To survive
Under pressure, resignation
Find the will
To turn around and fight
Sometimes you can't fall asleep
It gets to be too much
Gotta draw that line
And shout it out
Shout it out
