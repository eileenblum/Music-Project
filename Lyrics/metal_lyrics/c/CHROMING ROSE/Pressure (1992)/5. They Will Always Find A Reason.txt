Not one day passes
Those children
Aren't dying in the streets
They are all victims
Of all the hate in the world
In this nasty world
Yeah, in this nasty world
They're dying of hunger
Killed by war
Natural disasters
That and more
Killed by diseases
Lost by the world
Those to blame just don't care
They never understand things
They hold in hand
And they just don't mind
'Cause they all are
Spending their money
For weapons
They fight pushing their way
They show their might
Historical quasrrels
On those god is best
Change, people to animals -
Overnight
They never understands things
They hold in hand
And they just don't mind
'Cause they all deaf
And very blind
But they will always find a reason
They seem to make
The same mistakes
Making by promises
They never bring
Robbing the poor to live like kings
Political systems
A spit in the face
A total destruction
Of the human race
They never understand things
They hold in hand
And they just don't mind
'Cause they all deaf
And very blind
But they will always find a reason
How will the children learn?
If we show'em the wrong way
Hope for the future
Is lying in our hands
But we must see that all the evil
Will never disappear
From this world
If we don't fight it
We'll all be losers
When will man learn?
But they will always find a reason
