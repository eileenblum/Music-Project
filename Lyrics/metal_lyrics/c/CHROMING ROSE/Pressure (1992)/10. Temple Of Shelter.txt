Now they sailed across the sea
'Cause those bastards
Wanted me
And my new world full
Of gold
They were cold
Lies - they only brought lies
Somehow I just knew ahead
That my people would be dead
In the name of god, they'd die
But the name of lies
We only heard lies
I had a plan
Temple of shelter
Save what you can
And we took a lot of falls
Put in the chains like animals
But we spread the new like five
We're gonna fight
Yes we will fight
Hide the gold we gonna hide
Now I was always
A man with a plan
No one knows just where it is
Better lost that with Cortez
'Cause I hide it deep and well
Those who find it
Will burn in hell
Lies - they'll die for their lies
