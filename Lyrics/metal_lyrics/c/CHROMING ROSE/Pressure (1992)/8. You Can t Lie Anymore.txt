Re-run your life
You finally see
The wrong you have done
The things that you feel
Can't turn it back once again
You can't escape
It's your judgement day
There's no deathbed wish
It's much too late
The countdown is on
Your sins were too great
And panic moves in your brain
You made the choice
Now hell has your name
The time when you
Can't lie anymore
The time when you
Can't cry anymore
No time to change it
Just time to regret
The devil is waiting
Right next to you
You killed, you stole
Year for year
Lying and cheating
You never cared
Didn't think 'bout
The consequence
You hour has come
For the wrong you did
Right now
