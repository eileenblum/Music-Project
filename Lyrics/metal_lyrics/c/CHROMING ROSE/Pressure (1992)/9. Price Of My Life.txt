Hey mister
In your black-red cape
I remember you from
My sinnin' days
I know you're coming
Straight from hell
What it's my soul?
You wanna sell
You took me for a ride
In a wrong direction - I know
And now the devil sent you
From his financial section
Okay so
Tell me the price of my life
But give me 10% reduction
'Cause I wanna be free tonight
Let's make a deal
Let me sign the line
Now I see
You don't want no cash
Let's talk about an even match
What's your game?
I'll get you decide
Dice of poker
I have plenty of time
You took me for a ride
In a wrong direction - I know
Now it's my turn
To send you back in your section
Okay so
Tell me the price of my life
