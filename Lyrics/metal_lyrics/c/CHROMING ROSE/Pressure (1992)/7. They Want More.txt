Walking down an L.A. street
Watching asses movin' sweet
Of girls that look
For just one thing
Which long haired boy
Is who now?
Which band get their jeans
Scratch the action for satisfaction
They want more ice cold feelings
They want more
They go screaming
Screaming for more
She wants a ride on my guitar
Got cotton brains and money
And a key for every star
Hit-up by a blue-eyed girl
Don't need her, don't need her
Messin' up my world
