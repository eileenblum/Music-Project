Prowling through the night
Hiding from the light
Searching for your destiny
Fighting for your cause

The fox is chasing you
The fox is facing you
Stricken by your fate
Searching for the gate
Shooting in the dark
You're wide beside your mark

The fox is chasing you
The fox is facing you tonight

Shoot the fox, shoot him down or die
Here's your chance, you've got no choice but to try
Shoot the fox, shoot him down or die
Here's your chance, you've got no choice but to try

In the light you're feeling the darkness
In the light, there's just no place to hide

We have the force, there's no chance for you, for you
We have the force, there's no chance for you

You'll never reach your aim
You'll always be the same
Eternal looser cannot change, face the world
Accept it now

The fox is chasing you
The fox is facing you tonight

Shoot the fox, shoot him down or die
Here's your chance, you've got no choice but to try
Shoot the fox, shoot him down or die
Here's your chance, you've got no choice but to try

In the light you're feeling the darkness
In the light, there's just no place to hide

We have the force, there's no chance for you, for you
We have the force, there's no chance for you

I will kill, I will kill you now

Shoot the fox, shoot him down or die
Here's your chance, you've got no choice but to try
Shoot the fox, shoot him down or die
Here's your chance, you've got no choice but to try

In the light you're feeling the darkness
In the light, there's just no place to hide

We have the force, there's no chance for you, for you
We have the force, there's no chance for you
