come on, hey listen, this is the song for you
forget your daily shit, may all your dreams come true
fast guitars, dangerous girls, we'll have a party tonight
all that we want while playing here is to get you really tight
maxi wattage, light speed changes, give us what we need
come closer to the stage, our friends, we give you what you need
explosions! announcing our arrival!
we came down to pray for you, we are the gods of noise
we came down to pray for you, we are the gods of noise
listen to the words, our song is loud and clear
go out and spread this message, everyone has to hear
we stand for our music, that's spreading like a flame
in any situation we'll always take your blame
and when your good friends leave you, no another to be found
the gods of noise appear and lift you off the ground
[chorus]
even when the show is over, remember us, we will return!
