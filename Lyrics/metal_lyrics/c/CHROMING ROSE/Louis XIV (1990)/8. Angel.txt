Heaven is burning down
My faith has fallen to the ground
I feel the touch of a demented mind
Something's solid I couldn't find
There's power in the fire
Beaconing me
It's so hard to resist, my god has deserted me

Sound of silence
Shadows of violence

Angel, don't break the spell
If you don't win, I'm doomed to eternal hell
Angel, don't break the spell
The last round, can't you hear the bell

My whole life is passing by
A blinding light searing my eyes
The unholy wizard so soothing to my mind
Anarchy throughout the land
My life, my fate is in your hand
The final conflict that you have to win

Sound of silence
Shadows of violence

Angel, don't break the spell
If you don't win, I'm doomed to eternal hell
Angel, don't break the spell
The last round, can't you hear the bell
