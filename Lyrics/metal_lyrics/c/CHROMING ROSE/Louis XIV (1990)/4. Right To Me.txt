in dreams i'm running over mountains, over fields
nothing is unreacheable, you can't believe how that feels
but then dreams are not reality, just my thought are still with me
the rest of the body doesn't move, my god, am i alive?
no words, no screams can describe what i mean
no pain, now why, just give me the right to die
i hope i'll find a confidant, someone that may help me
just two seconds of your time, my friend, at last you've set me free
[chorus]
