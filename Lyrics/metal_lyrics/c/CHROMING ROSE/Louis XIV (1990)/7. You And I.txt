long ago, was it really just a woman's sin
we still don't know, did we have help to stand upright
perhaps we someone's higher expectations
evolving up from tiny snails
maybe a little gene manipulation - we don't know
[3d time - 'now we know']
faster - science is our master
applied research, breakthrough coming
prototype model on the floor
against the control group you were tested
your scores were always lower than mine before
you and i still might try
to find our past - so closely together tied
thrid generation product - hybrids incomplete
you're perfection - i can't compete
history shows, with lessons learned we still cannot win
the seed we've sown, it's come back to seal our fate
why don't they do their own procreation
it's worked well for many years
wasting our money on their simulation - when will they know
we must respect improvements on the past
science must also be tamed
make it work for us, not we for it
