Bound you are to brotherhood of flesh
With cold harness of iron behest
One falls, another crawls
Remembers none why march at all
One screams, another weeps
And the dead you drag along

Onward!
Pace to keep with dawn
Onward!
Further from light beyond

At one with chain
At one with pain
Refuse to lie, refuse to die,
And no light will have you

Onward,
Thy will reborn
Onward,
Thy soul unsworn
