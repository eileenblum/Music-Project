Beyond the suns fading warmth
Belief and fear in darkness born
Year by year frailer grown
Cast to flame on wildfire season
Departing light and omen cold winds wore
Rise on their wings and leave these shores
Feathered hope flee the winter claws
Weeping skies and wildfire season

I burn, sear graze of flame inside
I burn, leave no serene thought alive

Ablaze
Once famine seizes the way
No plans flames obey
Consume the heart in hideaway
I burn with heat of hate divine
I burn in cold sunless light

Beyond the suns fading warmth
Belief and fear in darkness born
Year by year frailer grown
Cast to flame on wildfire season
Departing light and omen cold winds wore
Rise on their wings and leave these shores
Feathered hope flee the winter claws
Weeping skies and wildfire season
