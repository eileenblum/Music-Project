As life ever was
In trails you retrace
Stream never pause
New dawn chase

Heart shedding ashes white
Furnace rimmed in frost
Devoid of searing bright
Brim they never crossed

Fall sundered ways to seek your shadow hearth
Soul-deep in dark
Cast sorrows forth and they shall depart
Unless dawn proves us scarred

Pathways worn deep
By many or none
Yet past only weeps
Passing of one

Casting tails unveiled
Silhouettes besieged
Retreating vulpine shades
All borders breached

Fall sundered ways to seek your shadow hearth
Soul-deep in dark
Cast sorrows forth and they shall depart
Unless dawn proves us scarred

Fall sundered ways to seek your shadow hearth
Soul-deep in dark
Cast sorrows forth and they shall depart
Unless dawn proves us scarred
