Sail between three winds of war
One leads you home while others crave more

Have I conquered the shame?
Do they now sing my name?

Ride forth my son, slain as your guide
Ride to match your fathers stride

Was I worth it all?
Was I? Dusk I can't recall

Beyond pristine ways
Heaving sea, temerity, storm hope away
Sail sorrows grey
Drifting astray, solace frail as moonlight ray

Sail beneath the vanguard of sky
They might have fallen but still hold the light

Am I part of this land?
Am I the last of my clan?

Beyond pristine ways
Heaving sea, temerity, storm hope away
Sail sorrows grey
Drifting astray, solace frail as moonlight ray

Sun silver, rain spear
Waves shattering white

Winds sigh cold...
What mercy dark did hide
Winds sigh cold...
Wake in world veiled white
Winds sigh cold...
Where seared shores reside
Winds sigh cold...
Sheltered vernal fright
Winds sigh cold...
What mercy dark did hide
Winds sigh cold...
