Are you afraid?
Are you ashamed?
The light has died...
Your last goodbye.

You'll never know how it feels
To lose yourself, to be complete
And no-one else will take the blame -
It's mine to bear.

"Come, play with me!"
...And so did he.
Beyond your trust
Hurt you I must.

You'll never know how it feels
To lose yourself, to be complete
And no-one else will take the blame -
It's mine to bear.

My body's tired of losing you
The drug of lust you withdrew
Tonight I had no choice
To leave you breathing...

You'll never know how it feels
To lose yourself, to be complete
And no-one else will take the blame -
It's mine to bear.

You'll never know how it feels
To lose yourself, to be complete
And no-one else will take the blame -
It's mine to bear.
