Hear we too are made of fated stars
Cold and far apart, shine the bright mirage
Judging by the true heart
Gone so vague with time,
Frail with sleep, cruel with savage crimes

Seam my wandering eyes, dim the pryin sight
Stand guard the blade and wings in vigil
Beneath red wool we children sleep
Safe from the shunned fables and yonder deeds
In the nest of slithering dreams
Fright between this night and becoming eventide

Two heads have I
Twin voices with a will of third
One of dusk, one of monring sky
And each talon raised lambs impaled
My tail devouring words

Will you march with the dream
Or will you tread alone
Will you stare at the flames
Cruel play of shades,
will faltering fades
Will you hold my doubt
that left us scarred
Dream upon we drown

Your dread concealed
Fools quiet fears
Are wisdom to wield
And with lies cohere
The leash must be long
Slaves shackles share
Cast of imbrued freedom
Threat of heaven impaired
