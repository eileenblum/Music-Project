It's a long road
When you're on yor own
And it hurts when they tear
your dreams apart

And every new town
Just seems to bring you down
Trying to find peace of mind
Can break your heart

It's real war
Right outside your front door I tell ya
Out where they'll kill ya
you could use a friend

Where the road is
That's the place for me
Where I'm me in my own space
Where I'm free
that's the place I want to be

Cause the road is long yeah
Each step is only the beginning
No breaks just heartaches
Oh man is anybody winning

It's a long road
And it's hard as hell
Tell me what do you do to survive
When they draw first blood
That's just start of it
Day and night you gotta fight
To keep alive

Any of you boys want to shoot,
now is the time,
There isn't one of us
That doesn't want to be someplace else,
But this is what we do, that we are,
Live for nothing or die for something
Your call
