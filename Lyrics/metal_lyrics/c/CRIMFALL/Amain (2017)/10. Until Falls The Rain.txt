Dry the orders, shelter the commands
Will drowns with flowing words
For those raised to arms
Warpaints on icons interred

Feed the flame
Until falls the rain
Feed the flame
Until falls the rain

Sun your to keep
Until falls the rain
Who of us first to yield
When falls the rain

Curse the beast and its heart
Shadow in soul thought tamed
Old is the fear in mortal's blood
Lion's share of unleashed flame

Bold is the rage against the unsealed cage
Bold is the hate
for shadows and decayed

I see them in the last of stands
What once was outrage cry
Wail of candor dying
on breathless horns
Seeking hands
to the waning sky
Throat of heavens torn
Bleeds out the scorn,
the pouring blame
But not the truth, only rain
