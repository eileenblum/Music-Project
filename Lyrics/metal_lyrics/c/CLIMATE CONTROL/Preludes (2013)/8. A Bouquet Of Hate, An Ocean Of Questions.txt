[feat. Spencer Martin]Thereâs something about the way you move tonight
Gliding across the floor like you donât feel at all
Thereâs something I need to say, can we move aside?
The glass of your eyes shows me you donât care
Â 
Please tell me you need to stay
You've had enough time to think
Do you intend to change?
Iâm not ignoring you, just blocking you out
Â 
I wonât accept apologies from someone who is dead inside
Bleed me out, leave me dry, you suffocate the tears I cry
Four cursed words! Letâs try being friends
Bitterness embraced, the devils might care
Your calloused heart feels no remorse
Itâs blackened out! Itâs blackened out.
Â 
Thereâs a distant light that burns your eyes
That light is the truth that youâre scared of
Donât tell me you feel the same as you did before
Your lies draw me in to false comforts once more
Â 
If only I had no shame
Iâd burn your ears with my rash words
You plague my thoughts and say
Iâm ignoring you and blocking you out
Â 
I wonât accept apologies from someone who is dead inside
Bleed me out, leave me dry, you suffocate the tears I cry
Four cursed words! Letâs make this work
Bitterness embraced, the devils might care
Your calloused heart feels no remorse
Itâs blackened out! Itâs blackened out.
