The conversation ends here
No more room to breathe your own air
Youâre tired and alone here
So you crumble down and become one of them
Â 
Still my eyes remain inexplicably dry

Watching you fall faster than I ever thought you would fall
How can you all conform like its second nature to you?
Why canât you stay true?
Â 
Will you ever see the truth now?
Through the dirty panes of your lie-filled eyes
But youâre happy and alive here (liar)
Youâre only fooling yourself, you know inside
Â 
But still my eyes remain inexplicably dry
Â 
Watching you fall faster than I ever thought you would fall
How can you all conform like its second nature to you?
Why canât you stay true?
Â 
You hypocrite! Get away
Stop poisoning my sight
Get away!
