Thereâs an answer on everybodyâs lips
But will it provide questions?
Forget these not, the words that I speak to you
I've found the tools to end time
Â 
Will it find you?
Lost in time
Will it find you?
Forever changing face
Will it find you?
Will you ever change this place?

Friendly faces, concealing cell corruption
Never-ending chase after your own salvation
Destroying minds around you while youâre keeping me sane
Whatâs left but this blindness to this cross I bear
Â 
Will it find you?
Lost in time
Will it find you?
Forever changing face
Will it find you?
Will you ever change this place?

No one will ever know about you
No one will ever know about you
Life is damned
