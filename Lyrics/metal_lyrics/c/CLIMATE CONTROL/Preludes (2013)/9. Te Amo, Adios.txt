I remember when you could relate to me
I remember when you said you loved me
The time when you could live on the edge
When weakness resides, thereâs nothing left
Â 
I remember the day you became beautiful
I remember that time, I made myself fall
I donât understand why youâre so negative
You said donât ever look back, but I already did
Â 
Â¿QuiÃ©n tiene la culpa? Â¿QuiÃ©n se siente mÃ¡s dolor?
(Whoâs to blame? Who feels more pain?)
Â¿Por quÃ© no estÃ¡s contento con mi corazÃ³n?
(Why are you not happy with my heart?)
Â 
I hope you are proud of your frozen heart
Gave myself to you, this was the result
Hell in my room, blue light surrounds
Darkness engulfs, my soul sinks down
Â 
Iâve hit the ground, lower than the floor
Iâve stood up tall, taller than you are
I will not let you break me down again
Te amo, adiÃ³s. No te busques por mi
(I love you, Goodbye. Donât look for me.)
Â 
Â¿QuiÃ©n tiene la culpa? Â¿QuiÃ©n se siente mÃ¡s dolor?
Â¿Por quÃ© no estÃ¡s contento con mi corazÃ³n?

Te Amo, AdiÃ³s
