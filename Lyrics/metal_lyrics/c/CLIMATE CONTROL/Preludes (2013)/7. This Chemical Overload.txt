Another flood cascading through my mind tonight
This week has been deducting years from my life
Trapped inside a shell of senses
The sights and sounds have all dulled down
Â 
So grant me this wish of numbness
And let absence work its wonders
That slight, familiar feeling will re-enter
And purge my earthly form of all this anger
Â 
My veins collapse from chemical overload
All made by me, but equally destructive
I must control the flow of this
Canât be tired of all this just yet
Because it will come again
Â 
So grant me this wish of numbness
And let absence work its wonders
That slight, familiar feeling will re-enter
And purge my earthly form of all this anger
