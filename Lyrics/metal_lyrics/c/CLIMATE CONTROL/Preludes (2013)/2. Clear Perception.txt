Everything in circles
Numb acceptance for whatâs changed
For it is too late now, I know
I hope one day you have my sight,
Feel and understand
Please
Know my pain:

Where have you gone? I've been waiting too long
Dust around me from the time spent stagnant
I have not grown, have not let go
Thereâs no way for me to grasp how you could
Â 
I find myself. I find myself lost
Times of light and then absence thereof
When all seems lost, empty and defeated
All I have to turn to are those images already lived
Already loved. Already gone.

Where have you gone? I've been waiting too long
Dust around me from the time spent stagnant
I have not grown, have not let go
Thereâs no way for me to grasp how you could
Nothing lasts forever, kill or be killed
In this life so far, all that I've learned
Let go of your foundations or suffer
Unless thatâs just meâ¦
