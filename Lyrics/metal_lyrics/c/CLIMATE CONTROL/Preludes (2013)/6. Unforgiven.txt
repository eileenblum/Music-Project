As you opened up my eyes, no past will be remembered
Just drown all your fears in my dreams, in my heart
Â 
Oh, the madness starts here. I canât be away for much longer
Or I will burn
These thoughts are killing me faster than any poison would
Iâm encaged
Â 
You felt the cold of the morning
But you wonât feel the cold of the night
You will battle through the rest of this nightmare
Iâd hate to be you

I canât open up my heart and let you take my blood flow
For you donât know the meaning of love
Youâre empty
Â 
Your wake of disaster will hardly be forgotten
As you know well
You will never stop there, your train will move relentless
And Iâm ashamed
Â 
You felt the cold of the morning
But you wonât feel the cold of the night
You will battle through the rest of this nightmare
Iâd hate to be you
