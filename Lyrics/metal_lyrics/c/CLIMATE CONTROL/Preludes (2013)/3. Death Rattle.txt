Iâll carry you home to the grave
Youâll bury me once again
And with this dying breath Iâll make everything that you've done come back tenfold
Your heart will swell up now
These wounds will bleed out loud and youâll scream but heaven will not hear you
Â 
Iâll scream out loud for you
But you wonât hear me
Youâll fall when you cry wolf
And they donât answer you
Â 
You stand for nothing more
Than dealing your black soul
Your selfishness is a blinder to the actions that tear those around you
You lie for daily breath
You've ripped apart the walls that once held you
Even hell will ignore you
Â 
Iâll scream out loud for you
But you wonât hear me
Youâll fall when you cry wolf
And they donât answer you

Empty your soul, youâre no good for me
Itâs not my fault that you've turned out this way
Itâs easy for me, I have no more shame
Reap your rewards with the utmost dismay
