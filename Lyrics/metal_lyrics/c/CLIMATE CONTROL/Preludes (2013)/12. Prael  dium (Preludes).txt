Press your hands to your eyes and watch the stars collide
Then open them and witness the real thing
In the sky tonight, we watch the worlds in flight
This was always coming
Â 
Blackened clouds envelop the sky
From now on, perpetual night
Canât help but feel more alive than I've felt for years
All our actions have brought this on
And no remorse can reverse this storm
Everything that mattered yesterday is lost in the ash
Â 
Will all our purposes be fulfilled if tonight the world ends?
Or was there ever any purpose anyway? (Anyway)
We all say goodbye, stand and face the red growing wave
And we all pray, we all pray and make our minds up
Â 
At the peak of our lives, we seldom stop to say
Thank you for the Universe
For the balance and the calm that we've all tried
So hard to destroy
Â 
Will all our purposes be fulfilled if tonight the world ends?
Or was there ever any purpose anyway? (Anyway)
We all say goodbye, stand and face the red growing wave
And we all pray, we all pray and face the consequences
Â 
Itâs started
We will all step into the darkness together
This darkness thrust upon us
Today will be the last day
Tonight, the last night
This is the end.
Â 
Our time has come
Where will you be when it all comes down?
As the ground takes flight, and you replay your life
Will you have made amends?
How will you take your last breath, sweet or despairing?
And how will you greet the face of death when your soul leaves your body?
