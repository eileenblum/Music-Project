Even if I have to let her go
I canât bear the thought
Nobody can have her
The way I have

Her face is too great to behold
Nobody deserves to look upon it
And feel the warmth,
Feel the warmth come apart

No, please stay
No, please stay
No, please stay
You called out now
No, please stay
No, please stay
No, please stay
You called out

It comes in waves
And leaves my thoughts in disarray
So weâll wait until the tide returns
And all is grey

So do what must be done
And Iâll try to hold on

Pulled through the water
Climbed up the stairs
You left the lights on
But no one was there
I make my decision
I start to erase
Stumble back to the waves
To fill my lungs again

But stillâ¦

No, please stay
No, please stay
No, please stay
You called out now
No, please stay
No, be safe
No, please stay
You called out now
Her face is too great to behold
Nobody deserves to look upon it
And feel the warmth slide out of her hands
But still
No, please stay
No, please stay
No, please stay
You called out.
