Inside your shelter, you pray for something more
But when the time comes, your broken heart exposes its claws

Who you are, who you are
I'll never know
Who you are, who you are

And I'll save the light that guided you here
Embrace the fight; enjoy the night
I'll say goodnight, and leave you here
Embrace the fight; enjoy the night

You shrink behind your mask again
I'd love to see your eyesâ¦
These thoughts will rust and fall away
You'll stand there waiting
These memories will fall away

And I'll save the light that guided you here
Embrace the fight; enjoy the night
I'll say goodnight, and leave you here
Embrace the fight; enjoy the night
