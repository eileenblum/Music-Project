These days I've come to learn the awful truth
That there will always be another one of you
As much as your smile denies it, you know
I see through your frail disguises

Aside from the fall, I think I've been alright
Despite
This feeling that I have been wasting all
This light

Oh, you promised me
Oh, that you'd always be there

And in the end, we move along but don't forget
The simple words replaying over in our heads

We are in motion

Oh, you will not be
Oh, the end of me
I've rebuilt these walls and patched up the holes
I've locked this gate
Oh, until better days
