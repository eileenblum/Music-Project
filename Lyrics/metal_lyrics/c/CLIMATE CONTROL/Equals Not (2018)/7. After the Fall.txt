Would you open your eyes and see
That you left me alone in the same room
The one that we built together
(when we thought we had time)
We'd sit and decide our fate
Without taking a step towards it
And knew we were both to blame

And when she's near
Will you look away, will you look away?
(further than this life)
That we hold so dear
And when she leaves
Will you be OK, will you be OK
After the fall?

You somehow expected me to be
The one with all the answers
Circumstance we shared the same
I was just as scared and powerless
Did you mean everything you said
Before this separation?

If I had known how many years would come to pass without resolution
I'd take a few more risks and stop sitting still like this
If I had known how much your eyes would haunt my waking hours
I'd tear down every structure in our way, and lead us home

And when she's near
Will you look away, will you look away?
(further than this life)
That we hold so dear
And when she leaves
Will you be OK, will you be OK
After the fall?
