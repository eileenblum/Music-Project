You see how it ended
I'm asking for rest so we can lock this door for good
Like we know we should
And though the pages still ache with words unsaid
They'll have to remain that way

I am violently shaking, these tears have been falling like rain
The water's meant for the lawns of your heart, but it's wasted the same
It's dried up
We fade out
A cut scene of your house
Where we sat, and waited
For this to go somewhere.
Somewhereâ¦

You see how it ended
I'm asking for rest so we can lock this door for good
Like we know we should
And though the pages still ache with words unsaid
They'll have to remain that way

When your heart has finally packed up and moved on
So discoloured from all the times we've left it out in the rain
Just remember that we were just too weak to move on
We're still standing there

You see how it ended
I'm asking for rest so we can lock this door for good
Like we know we should
And though the pages still ache with words unsaid
They'll have to remain that way
