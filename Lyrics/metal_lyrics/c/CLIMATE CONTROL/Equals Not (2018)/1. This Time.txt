It's taken forever to see you like this
To know what I'm missing on those nights all alone
It's taken forever to know you are home
To know I am home and it will always exist

This time I can't believe
That it's taken so long
Just to wake up and remember
That you are my victory
And I won't let you go
Until the earth starts to tremble
And we all, and we all fall off

I am in awe of you
And I intend to
Be more what you crave
Yeah, I want your soul to flower
With all these years and circumstance yeah it's been complicated
Go back to the time we started out and it was something pure
But I cannot forget your eyes
You've always helped me to survive

This time I can't believe
That it's taken so long
Just to wake up and remember
That you are my victory
And I won't let you go
Until the earth starts to tremble
And we all, and we all fall off
