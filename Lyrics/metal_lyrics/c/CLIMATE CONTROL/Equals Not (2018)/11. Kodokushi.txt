I gave my life to someone else
They placed it on their highest shelf
So beautiful, so fragile yet
So poorly used, never broken in
One day our eyes began to dwell
On other things; we'd never tell
They glazed over as we lived inside
The constructs of our feeble minds

I only get home when I crash into you

Such endless comfort you bring to me
But I am the mountain, and you're the breeze
What if I can't return the favour?
Such astounding debt
Someone you haven't metâ¦

I gave my life to someone else
They placed it on their highest shelf
So beautiful, so fragile yet
So poorly used, never broken in
One day our eyes began to dwell
On other things; we'd never tell
They glazed over as we lived inside
The constructs of our feeble minds
