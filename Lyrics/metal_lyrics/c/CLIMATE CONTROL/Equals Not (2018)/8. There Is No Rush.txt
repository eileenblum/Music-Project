Living life from a backseat view
And never closer
Being there with you is not something I could do
Burning time with my back to you
Looking for answers
In longing for the past but neglecting what's ahead

You said, "Look forward to the things we all
Dreamed of when we were youngâ¦"

When we were younger, the world made sense in every way
The skies looked brighter and we felt so free
The years bring wisdom but the dimming of the light came along
And we all took our separate paths; we travel them alone

Do we believe in the world we knew
Or the one that now stands before us?
Do we enjoy this life
Or live it like they told us to?

â¦live it like they told us to
We're living on our strings
Like they told us to

Self-aware as I mourn my fading youth
Even writing these words down, my eyes burn
This life of love and loss looks balanced from afar
But inside, it burnsâ¦

Do we believe in the world we knew
Or the one that now stands before us?
Do we enjoy this life
Or live it like they told us to?

We fall.
