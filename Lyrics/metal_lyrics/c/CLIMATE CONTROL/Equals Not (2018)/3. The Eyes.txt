We've wasted years
Should have made this vision real
Where you would be leaning up on me
Your eyes watching this unfold

You're waiting there with eyes filled up with memories that blind you

Our love was always aligned
(Away away away)
But you were never mine
(Away away)
Can you help me find
A way, a way out?
Do you still see me?

As much as you'd like to think it
This story's not black and white
It might have felt that way at first
But we are part of an ending that fate left behind

Our love was always aligned
(Away away away)
But you were never mine
(Away away)
Can you help me find
A way, a way out?
Do you still see me?

We live as cracks on the floor
It's not enough and it's broken
But we would never know that this would always be
A storm that melted away
An unfinished book that we started
We can't bear to look but
We can never leave

Have I let you down?
I thought that you would be here soon
Have I let you down or did you
Fade away in this fight?
Ashamed to even feel this
Consumed by everything
As we rewind
Replay this; replay this
Eternally.
