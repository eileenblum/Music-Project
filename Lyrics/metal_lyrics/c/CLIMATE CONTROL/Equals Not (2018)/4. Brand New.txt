Hold them all
You know what lies in wait
Before it is too late, 'cause we are prone to wonder
So much more
To understand before
We're left to watch the veil flutter gently in their wake

And I know now
We lost the plot a long time ago

Collect your things
'Cause time is coming
To untie these strings
To the lives we're given
And I know now
We lost the plot a long time ago

We're left to do what calls our hearts
In spite of this, we let our roots get buried deep
And knowing that we'll all depart
We're consumed by this notion of our fate
That we create
We're living in waitâ¦
We're living in wait.

Collect your things
'Cause time is coming
To untie these strings
To the lives we're given
And I know now
We lost the plot a long time ago
