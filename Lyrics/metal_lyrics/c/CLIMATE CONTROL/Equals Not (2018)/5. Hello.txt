You and the sunlight in your hair
Linger in my mind
You let the world die when you left
And blamed it on me

An endless game, just running around
We fall apartâ¦

Let's trade problems, you and me
We'll put on a smile and we'll make believe
That it's all better now
That we're all cured somehow
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
We'll pick apart our demons
And maybe down the line
We'll move onâ¦

Just lay here and see the light spilling in
Golden shadows across our bodies tangled there
It's a place in our minds
We've been there alone for quite some time
So let's meet up far away in another life to make this real

Let's trade problems, you and me
We'll put on a smile and we'll make believe
That it's all better now
That we're all cured somehow
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
We'll pick apart our demons
And maybe down the line
We'll move onâ¦
