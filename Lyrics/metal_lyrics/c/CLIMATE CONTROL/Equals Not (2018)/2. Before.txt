And as we fade, so will the memories we've made
So will it all, and like a candle burn
Into dust of once formed things
But before you goâ¦

Save me from a life filled with regret
From a fate we never met and always wonder
We're made of medicine
And it's the cure to each other's sins
I just hope we learn to let each other in

We always knew that these days would have to come
But we cast the thought behind the sun
In hopes they'd burn when out of sight
But in time, we knew would come the night
I've learned these thousand times we've said goodbye
That you are my sugar-coated sigh
Forever, always, but not quite yet

Save me from a life filled with regret
From a fate we never met and always wonder
We're made of medicine
And it's the cure to each other's sins
I just hope we learn to let each other in
