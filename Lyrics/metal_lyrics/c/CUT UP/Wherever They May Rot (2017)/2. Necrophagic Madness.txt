Devouring the living and scavenging the dead
Those stinking carcasses will melt

Welcome to the tombs where the rotten cease to be

Connoisseur of the undead, birthfather of death
Chewing, gnawing, revel in their flesh
An appetite for guts, wormfilled caskets molding corpses
If it bleeds, it's already gone

Welcome to the tombs, where the rotten cease to be

Filthy, naked and buried alive
Crawling from the caskets to die

Welcome to the tombs where the rotten cease to be
Welcome to the tombs where the rotten cease to be
