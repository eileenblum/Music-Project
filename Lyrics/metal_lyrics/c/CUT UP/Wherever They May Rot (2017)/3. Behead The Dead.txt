Buried, resurrected then slaughtered again
Suffocating, stabbed, hung and impaled

Behead the dead, the only way to kill
Behead the dead, the cold steel cuts
Behead the dead, an axe through the neck
The corpse still refuses to die

Covered in blood with all skin scaled off
Drowned, poisoned, strangled and shot
Inner organs removed and burnt
The heart ripped out and cut to pieces

Kneeling in a pool of ripped out entrails
A reek of slaughtered inhuman remains
The hollow body finally collapses
Torch what's left of the dead

Pieces falling loose from the tortured body
A neverending work to create the perfect death

Flesh removed, peeled to the bone
Electrified, mutilated, frozen and blown

Behead the dead, the only way to kill
Behead the dead, the cold steel cuts
Behead the dead, an axe through the neck
The corpse finally dies
