Battered to the ground where you belong
Twitching in pain amongst the filth on the floor
Blunt objects, morbid procedures
Agonizing screams as your bones get pulverized
The pain that you feel will never end

Cranium crusher

Waves of suffering, the skull gets shattered
Rearrangement of facial features
Blunt force trauma, extreme torture
Forehead collapsing, the light dies
One final nightmare to end your miserable life

Sledgehammer the tool of the trade
Skeletal obliteration
Each blow a demolition of teeth
Hammered into the tomb
Hammered into the tomb
