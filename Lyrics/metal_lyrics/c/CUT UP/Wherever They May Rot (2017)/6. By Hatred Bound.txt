They fall in line- on command
Cult of righteous kills- death is at hand
Taken down, one by one, bludgeoned, knifed, shot
Dress them in viscera- burn them, spare them not

Expect redemption- none to be found
Retaliation- by hatred bound
Expect redemption- on sacred ground
Promoted to fully dead- receive no burial mound

Die forever- cut up, pounded, hanged
Awarded no body bags- mummified in sand
Left to rot- choke on their guts
Sent into oblivion- worthless scum drowned in pus

Hammer the knife straight into the head
Splitting the skull, drill deeper by twisting the blade
Break off the handle, eyes turning red
Stabbings that turn into jackhammer beating, proud of the art being made

Warmonger treatment- knifed to their deaths
Chaotic killing, introducing their heads to the blades
Warmonger treatment- knifed to their deaths
Stabbing that turn into jackhammer beatings, proud of the art being made
