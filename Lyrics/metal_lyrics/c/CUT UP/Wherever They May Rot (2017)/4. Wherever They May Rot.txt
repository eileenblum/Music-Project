Blackened earth, dying future
This domain has fallen in decay

Decrepit, broken men decomposing in the mud
Total elimination, the ultimate revenge
Through years of oppression this debt is paid in blood
Cast down and executed, dug up and defeated

Corpse by corpse exhumed, lifted from the ground
Carcasses disintegrating in a molten mound

Atrophy- flesh decaying from their broken skulls
Obsolete- a legacy forgotten and destroyed

All are dead
Withering scum
Piss on their remains
Wherever they may rot

Doomed to waste away
Carrions under a dead sky
A graveyard for the rotten
A graveyard for the slain

All are dead
Withering scum
Piss on their remains
Wherever they may rot
