Swarms of insects ridden with disease
They came crawling through the night in trails of misery
Uncontrolled breedings draining all life
By any means necessary they must die

A rain of fire falls scorching them all
Cries of a burning mass purged by the flames

Deprived of limbs, teeth, flesh and skin
Charred remains scattered in this scene
A fathomless annihilation, yet a new dawn for man

Melting away, denied the grave
Visions of blackened corpses at this
Vermin funeral
Vermin funeral

Black smoke rising higher
Bodies feed the fire
Reeking burial pyres
Leeches now expired

Thousand slaughtered at this
Vermin funeral
Vermin funeral
