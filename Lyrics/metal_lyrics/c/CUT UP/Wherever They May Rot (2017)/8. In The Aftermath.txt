The stench is everywhere, burning bodies
Mile after mile, this is the aftermath

Scarred for centuries
The soil is swamped with blood

A cataclysm, we brought upon
Termination, it has begun

Those few that survived, crawling skinless
Naked mutated ghosts, searching for cover

Shelters already infected
Every breath is deadly

The final dawn for mankind
A toxic mist will devour us all

The atmosphere is thicker than blood
None will live to face the dawn
Caustic horror, fatal burns
Life eradication

A cataclysm, we brought upon
Termination, it has begun
