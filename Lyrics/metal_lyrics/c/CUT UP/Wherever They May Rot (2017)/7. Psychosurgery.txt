Knocked out by chloroform, immobilized and numb
Placed on the stretcher prepared for dissection

Scalp detached from the head
Skullcap removed, brain exposed
White and grey matter craved
Experiments in anatomy

Lacerating through the nerves with surgical precision
Incisions reshaping tissue the inmate awakens

Morality replaced by lethal hatred
Vengeful hands claw and tear
Vital organs removed and ruined
Helpless surgeon now the victim

Humanity lost
Slaughtered sanity
Altered under the blade
Psychosurgery

Open gushing wounds
Innards on the outside
A newborn killer glare upon
His disemboweled maker

Humanity lost
Slaughtered sanity
Altered under the blade
Psychosurgery
