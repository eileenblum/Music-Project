Mouth sewn shut, sinews cut, every vertebrae crushed
Crippled, horrified slut, welcome to the butcher's block
As the skin gets pierced and the steel drips of red
This masterpiece is taking shape

Defiled on the bench, the torso gets deformed
With steadfast hands the future is resolved

Lines carved into the flesh
The art of mutilation
Slow death, bleeding scars
Raped by the blade

The dagger runs too deep, ruptured veins unfold
Panic struck eyes- this maniac has lost control
Rib by rib cracked, bowels ripped and torn
A room decorated in abdominal cruor

Savage fists imbrued in gore
Human raped into bloody mush
A creation utterly destroyed

No mercy spared
The object is dead
Inhuman desires
To desecrate again

Defiled on the bench, burial time has come
With bloodstained hands the devil's work is done

Lines carved into the flesh
The art of mutilation
Slow death, bleeding scars
Raped by the blade
