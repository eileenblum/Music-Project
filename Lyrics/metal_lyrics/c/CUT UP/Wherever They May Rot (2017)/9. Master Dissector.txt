Pliers, the favorite tool for torture
Used to remove the fingers one by one
Then the scalpel will do the work
When it slowly tickles the flesh a thousand times

Bonesaw, chainsaw, cut the skull in half
Maiming, lacerating, tear off both arms
Hatchet, cleaver, cut off the legs
The master dissector

Bolt clipper, on the toes
Five incisions and they are removed
Carve through the tortured flesh
Shovel the gore from within

Bonesaw, chainsaw, cut the skull in half
Maiming, lacerating, tear off both arms
Hatchet, cleaver, cut off the legs
The master dissector
