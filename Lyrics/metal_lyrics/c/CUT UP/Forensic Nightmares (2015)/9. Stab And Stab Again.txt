Still haunted by those savage dreams
The mind obsessed by blood and guts
Fiction shapes reality
The thirst for pain must be satisfied
A grotesque sense of relief follows every act of violence
Blood from slaughtered rats and insects covers the butcher block

Stab and stab again
Maim without control
I, I killed them, I killed them all
They are dead, they will never breathe again

Now the prey increase in size, neighbors lose their animals
Dissected pets cut into pieces, burned to ashes in the stone
Still craving more blood and intestines
Animals can't satisfy the urge
The taste for cutting into human flesh will now be unleashed

Chained to the wall the butchery will begin
Knives and axes carve through their skin
Pliers remove tendons and bones
Chainsaw ending the reaping of their souls

Strengthened with an increased technique, to kill and cut the flesh
A growing mental orgasm when the hands get drenched in blood
The appetite for human kills is totally out of control
Lunacy and butchery walk brutally hand in hand
