A grotesque incision through the clotted, rotted flesh
Decomposing carcasses dragged into a pool of blood
Under the festering skin maggots chew the hollow meat
The intestines have been violently removed
Lungs and heart ripped out, a butchery improved

Blood and flesh, skin and bones, molded meat
A grisly stench of human waste
Cut to pieces, internal mush, guts all over
A reeking pile of human fragments

Pungent fluids pour from the infected cuts
Wounds made deep enough to never heal
Bleeding, abandoned to feed the worms
Devoured over time

Tortured piled up corpses
A morbid carnal cutting feast
Extremely violent flesh aggression

Cut to pieces, internal mush, guts all over
A reeking pile of human fragments

The ripped out eyes and tongues already turning grey
Broken collarbone and neck tendons torn apart
In this tomb of slaughtered violated human remains
The intestines have been violently removed
Rot in viscera, smeared in reeking gore
