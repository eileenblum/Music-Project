Trapped behind reinforced concrete, surrounded only by darkness
An acrid smell fills the lungs, every breath aches with pain
No way out, all doors are shut, welded steel bars block the way
Inhale both fear and poison, the skin begins to itch
Naked, scared and covered in chemicals
Lights tuned on exposing all caged victims,
Entrapped for human experiments
Screams start to echo inside the chemical bunker
There's no escape, no survival, just a slow and painful death

Hair falls from their rotting scalps
Eyes already blind
Intestines turn to liquid
Boiling skin melts from the flesh
Disfigured human mush
Bone, teeth and nails float down the drain

Crawl in the discolored pus and guts that cover the floor
Fight the rats and cockroaches to survive on human leftovers
There will be no understanding, only massive torture
Mental murder of what's left of the mind
Intestines dissolve from inside, ooze from every orifice
Melting every organ exposed to the injected chemicals
Before all traces of humanity are totally wiped out
The process of the chemical decomposing is recorded
