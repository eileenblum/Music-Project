Self-mutilation, scars bear witness to a psychotic night
Left with a mental void emptied of all but fragments of horror

Brain cell holocaust, nothing but mush within walls of bone
Gas and fluids uncontained, ominous signs of inner decay
Locked in foetal position unable to move
Excruciating pain

Stomach insurgence, violent discharges
Shifting in color from green to red
Gore - runs down the walls
Gore - drowning all
Vile regurgitation, consciousness fading

Crawling in pus
Bathing in blood
Extreme convulsions
Praying for the end of life

Blood - runs down the walls
Blood - drowning all
Intestinal failure, body shutting down forever
