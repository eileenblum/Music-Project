Awaken from a dream of hunger, a new born appetite for flesh
Images of mutilation subconsciously fill the mind
A taste of blood and guts so present, almost like it's real
Imprisoning the lust for bloodshed
Fight against the urge to maim

The will to kill will take command
The will to kill will take command

Slowly lose the human reason
Grab that axe and keep on dreaming
Suffer through the never ending pain
The endless pain

An increasing will to cut and saw relentlessly through meat and bones
Revel in a butchered pile, from a freshly slaughtered carcass
The taste for murder takes control, the dreams turn into reality
Embrace the urge to maim

The will to kill will take command
The will to kill
Kill!
