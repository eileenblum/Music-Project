Dragged into the shed, exhumed from rotten soil
Decaying pale skin covered with scabs and boils
Stripped of all emotions, dilapidated thoughts
Realize the madness and violate this corpse

A morbid carnal lust to drawn in clotted blood
To dwell with the maggots inside the rotting holes
Fornication beyond the boundaries of sanity
The corpse lies dead and impaled

Haematoma and bruises exposed
The shaft starts to rise as the smell fills the nose
A ceaseless urge for necrophilic bliss
Compelled to penetrate each and every orifice

Rigor mortis
Gaping mouth empty eyes
Forced to kill then fuck

Bodily fluids gush, pelvis gets crushed
Violent phallic thrusts turn the subject into pulp
Erupting from inside, climax has been reached
Dead blue lips stained by bestial seed
