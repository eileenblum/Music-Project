Ravaging through the human flesh to clean out the inside
Removing all intestines, muscles, pulverized bones and tendons
Cut the neck wide open to rip out the brain

Exhuming the entrails

All remaining word now is to swab up all the blood
To carve the last nerves from the skin
Remove all the nails and rip out the eyes

Smell the slaughter
Inhale the fumes of autopsy
The cadaver starts to shape into my camouflesh

Exhuming the entrails

When preparations are done, crawl inside the empty carcass
The shiny skin is stitched to fit, standing in a cold pile of gore
A hideous morbid mirror image staring back

Smell the slaughter - inhale the fumes of autopsy
The cadaver starts to shape into my camouflesh
Desecrated cut up human - eviscerated guts
The cadaver starts to shape into my camouflesh
