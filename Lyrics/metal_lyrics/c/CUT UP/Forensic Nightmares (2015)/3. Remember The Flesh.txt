Spawned from liquid squeezed from dismembered zombie flesh
Mixed with nuclear waste they start to grow
A new breed of flesh eating monsters comes alive
Stronger, more vicious, faster when they hunt

Skin carving claws of steel, bring the suffering, suffering

Hordes of morbid rotten soldiers, driven by their hunger
Ripping every living thing, piece by piece
Screaming victims begging for the torture to end
When they slowly carve through still breathing bodies

Remember all the flesh and blood
When the buried starts to breathe
Remember all the spilled guts
When the buried starts to eat

Is there an end to this, embrace the butchery
Execution of humanity, this is the end, this is the end
