The smell of gasoline mixed with blood
Forcing the chain to chew the meat
Euphoric rapture fed from the screams of the dying
To satisfy their maiming urge

Knee deep in gore
Caress the mutilated torso
An army bred for dismemberment

The order of the chainsaw
The order of the chainsaw

Sawed up bodies left in rotting piles
In a putrefaction process to mold
Unpleasant reek when the festered remains erupt
Surrounded by their innards pus

Worshpier of the flesh caving machinery
They cut simultaneously through the spine
In a shower of blood, with violence they rule
They follow only one law - the chainsaw

They follow only one law
The order of the chainsaw
