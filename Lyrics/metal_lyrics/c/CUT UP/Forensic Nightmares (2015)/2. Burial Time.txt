Suffering, you have never felt the pain I will give
Mercilessly I thrust my nails through you

First your hands, then your feet, the blood will flow
Ravaging the skin, limb by limb
Rending through the human waste, I will defile your flesh
When I finally take your soul

Dismemberment, when I tear what's left apart
Disemboweled, the intestines fill the ground

Onslaught, upon what once was breathing
Now it's dead, it never stopped bleeding
Ripped apart, organs, skin and bones are everywhere
Grab the shovel, burial time is here
