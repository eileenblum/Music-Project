A massive killing spree
Violent butchery
The extreme torture lasted for hours
Nail by nail slowly removed
From the finger tips
The flesh peeled to the bone

Pliers separated the fingers from the hands
Then the wrists were burned
To temporarily stop the bleeding
Punctured biceps
Shoulders maimed with an axe
Arms ripped from the torso

Toe after the flattened with a hammer
Until only the skin remained
The feet crushed by the same hammer
Until the bones were burning into dust

Far above all sanity
Lunacy prevails
Mangled beyond recognition
A forensic nightmare all that's left

Ankles cut loose with the axe
Shins cut into pieces 
Knees chainsawed in half
Femurs ripped from the flesh

Legs completely destroyed
Balls kicked until nothing
But fluid covered the floor
The victim must be dead by now

The cock set aflame with a blowtorch
Those cut upm intestines spread everywhere
Severed head by the neck
Eyes punctured, the final stage
