Intestines exposed
By violent thrusts
The innards removed
Dissecting the guts
To rip through the skin
Tissue and muscle
Cartilage shredding
Draining blood vessels

Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes

Flesh matters the most
When splattered around
It's never morose
Absurdly profound
Fresh insides come out
Excitedly done
My purpose in life
To kill just for fun

Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes

Frantic disembowelment
Deprived of vital content
Organ loss without consent
Spastic slicing an event
Sharpened steel my covenant
Frantic disembowelment
Mutilating miscreant
Sickening accomplishment
Spreading gore is time worth spent
Perpetuate this mad intent
Eternally malevolent
Frantic disembowelment

Kidneys exploded
The pancreas flew
Stomach deleted
The spleen I did chew
The carving is over
You lost and I won
Fulfilling my dream
I killed you for fun

Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes

Frantic disembowelment
