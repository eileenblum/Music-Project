Conceived through rape
Procreate
A vicious brood

Ravaging intercourse
Penetrate with force
Forsaken, nude

Spawn of the wretched, born of the rape
Dawn of the murdering beasts of hate
Spawn of the wretched cunt defiled
Pawn of the darkness, blasphemous child
The wretched spawn, inherently vile

Inherited traits
Reprobate
From birth, an urge

No chance to change
Born deranged
Violence will emerge

Spawn of the wretched, born of the rape
Dawn of the murdering beasts of hate
Spawn of the wretched cunt defiled
Pawn of the darkness, blasphemous child
The wretched spawn, inherently vile

Spawn of the wretched, bred from the damned
Gone are the instincts normal for man
Spawn of the wanton loins of the cruel
Spawned by brute force, used as a tool
The wretched spawn, violence will rule

Heredity dictates brutality
Doomed to carry the legacy
Genes of the butchers, a killing breed
Revel in making the helpless bleed

Scion of the murderers
A bloodline so profane
Born insane

Predestined to annihilate
Through sinister eugenics
Sworn to kill, they will

It was made to kill

[Solo - O'Brien]

Massacre the innocents
A slaughter without meaning
Bleed, screaming

Only one remains untouched
Her fate is violation
Vile
Impregnation

[Lyrics and Music - Webster]
