Buried waist deep gagged and bound
Piles of heads lie on the ground
Executioners start to assemble

Condemned man shakes with fear
Doom now becoming clear
The faces of the heads he resembles

Severed
Head
Stoning

His family's heads strike him
The most recent victims
Without mercy savage killers throw

His wife's head breaks his jaw
Bruised flesh becoming raw
From many wounds blood begins to flow

When the victim dies
They chop off his head

Severed head stoning

Badly beaten, in a daze
Eye pops out, fluid sprays
Pulsing veins cause the wounds to gush

The end is near the bloody slumps
Mangled face a mass of lumps
What was a man now reduced to mush

Mashed into a pulp
Dozens of bones break

[Solo - Owen]

Severed head stoning
