Staking out the residence
Of the chosen target
Entering the empty home
Lace the food with poison

The hapless victim never had a chance
Precise contamination killed him fast

Shocking news traveled fast
But I have traveled faster
The only clue that's left behind
Poison in the cadaver

Cyanide assassin is my trade
Exacting methods are my quarry's bane
Toxic killing tactics stop your breath
Precision dosage leaves the victim dead
Cyanide assassin

Life, my task to end
Death, I don't regret

Analyze the next assignment
Select the proper tools
Gas will be the most effective
That is what I'll use

Release the vapors in the victim's room
Sleeping chambers fast become a tomb
Calculated venting should work fast
Enclosed space filled with poison gas
Cyanide assassin

Life, it should end fast
Death, he now should pass
Gasping, he fights for air
Face, fixed with despair
But the end does not seem close
Misjudged the lethal dose
I must return, my work's not done
He's still alive, but too weak to run

[Solo - Owen]

A sloppy job must be finished
Can't leave him in a coma
With my mask I won't smell
The almond-like aroma
With syringe in hand I walk into his room
He's struggling with the damage from the fumes
I plunge the needle deep into his vein
Completion of the murder ends his pain
Cyanide assassin

[Lyrics and Music - Webster]
