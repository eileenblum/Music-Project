[Lyrics and music: Jack Owen]

As I walk behind her, her scent trails to me
What is it that draws me nearer, what could it be?
Once I was normal among the sheep
Now I'm immoral, in the night I creep

Searching for the one, 21, she will run from the gleam of my
Blade, she has strayed.
She will pay with the only life that she now knows. Captured by
The gender she loathes

Now she is tied, terrified, set aside.
As I prepare, she stares, as
I tear at the garment she hides behind.
Her young flesh is so divine.

One final deed, she will plead, I proceed.
Satisfying my urge, I will scourge, as I surge
Through her hallowed feminine domain.
From her young body, I can't abstain.

Lifeless she now lies, now untied, I defile.
Carefully scoring her skin, I begin from within
Removing her organs inspected.
Still nothing detected

[Solo: Owen]

One way to achieve
The info that I need,
Continuing to cleave.

[Solo: Owen]

Gradually consumed,
She was foredoomed,
Body one big wound.

Now I am through, as I chew on the few pieces that
Remain of the brain, nothing gained, I continue my
Searching in the night for the one who fulfills my plight.

Searching for the one, 21, she will run from the
Gleam of my blade. She will pay.
Nothing left to mutilate
Nothing left to mutilate

[Solo: Owen]
