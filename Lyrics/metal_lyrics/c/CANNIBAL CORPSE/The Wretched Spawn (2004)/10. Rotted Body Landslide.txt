Climbing the mounds to escape from death
Ten thousand left to rot
In this gorge

Bodies lie
Putrefy
I won't die

Suffocating stench of corpses wafts
Up from the pits of deaths
Fumes disgorge

Rancid heap
Walls steep
Vapors creep

Underneath
Putrid tide
Rotted body
Land

Slide
Genocide
Mountains of dead mark the place where they died, they died

Transfixed with horror as the corpses fall
Flesh sloughs off as I try to grasp
Start to slip

Suffocate
Corpses' weight
Seals my fate

Underneath
Putrid tide
Rotted body
Land

Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalanche of cadavers down the mountainside

Slide
Genocide
Mountains of the dead mark the place where they died
They died

Bodies of the dead
Smother me with rot
Remains are crushing me
Decomposing mound

This is where I die
Nameless dead my witness

Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalanche of cadavers down the mountainside
