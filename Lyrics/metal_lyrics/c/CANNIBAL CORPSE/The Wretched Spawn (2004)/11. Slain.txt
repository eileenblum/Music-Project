The outlander walked into town, covered in gore
He knew he could not wait much longer, he needed more
Death
Pain
Terror
Blood...

On the high plain they lost their lives.
Hundreds were slain.
Why they died no one will know.
Their bloodstains will always show for all time.

Wasting no time he began defiling whores
He would be the last man they felt, a carnivore
Tear
Rape
Ravage
Maim

On the high plain they lost their lives.
Hundreds were slain.
Why they died no one will know.
Their bloodstains will always show for all time.

Firing. Loaded rifle. Never ending killing spree
Slashing with machete. Body parts are the debris.
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs
to the fullest extent.
One more town, slowly going down.
This is the coming of endless torment.

[Solo - Owen]

Unburied victims lie, blood soaking into the sand
Remains of the slain, a dead body wasteland
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs
to the fullest extent.
One man left, sheriff bereft, faces the stranger with intent

[Solo - O'Brien]

On the high plain they lost their lives.
Hundreds were slain.
Why they died no one will know.
Their bloodstains will always show for all...
Time
Expired
Big iron
Both die

On the high plain they lost their lives.
Hundreds were slain.
Why they died no one will know.
Their bloodstains will always show for all time...

Slain

[Lyrics and Music - Owen]
