There is something inside me
It's coming out
I feel like killing you
Let loose of the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold
Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding
Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead
Eyes bulging from the sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
Through the crack
Blood does leak distorted beauty,
Catastrophe steaming slop.
Splattered all over me
Lifeless body, slouching dead
Lecherous abcess.
Where you once had a head
Avoiding the prophecy of
My new found lust
You will never live again,
Soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
Facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half
Crushing, cranal, contents
Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facil region
Suffer, and then you die
Torture, pulverised
At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, No one can stop me
Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue
Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now the way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead
