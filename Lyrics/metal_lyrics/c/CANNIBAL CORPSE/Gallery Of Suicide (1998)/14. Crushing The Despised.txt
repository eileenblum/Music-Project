[music: Webster/Owen]
[lyric: Webster]
[vocal patterns: Webster/Fisher]

Screwdriver repeatedly lands in his face
Gouges and hacks at the man of disgrace
Tearing off muscles from the bones of his chest
Rending his flesh with rage I've been blessed

Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack

Crushing the despised

Under my boot I hear your bones crack
So many things that you want to take back
I won't forget and I won't forgive
Not so long as I allow you to live

Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack

Crushing the despised
