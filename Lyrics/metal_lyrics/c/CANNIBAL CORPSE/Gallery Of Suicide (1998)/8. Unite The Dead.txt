[music: Owen, Webster]
[lyrics, vocal patterns: Webster]

Her flesh decaying she rises to see
Lecherous ghouls with rotting erections
Her breasts are lactating blood and pus
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust

Gray skinned bodies pulsate as one
Grasping her flesh, erotic undead
Maggots crawl on their rotting cocks
Into her cunt, rigid like rock

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

Breeding the damned
Carcasses writhe
Revel in death

Bleeding and sore
Insatiable corpse
Consummate the bonds of death

Beautiful eyes are now vacant pits
Her body contorts, her vagina has fangs
Putrid fluids will mix in her loins
The seed of the undead will grow inside

Hiding from mankind the embryo grows
Nourished by flesh the mother consumes
After the birth the child will grow
Prince of the dead conceived by profanity

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

Gifted with speech
The offspring will lead
Establish their reign

Lusting for flesh
But living, not dead
The corpses will rape
Rape!

Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create hoards of their own

Lust of the dead will multiply
Thousands of corpses beginning to rise
Living again for rape and destruction
Ejaculate bile from their erections

Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create hoards of their own

[Solo - Owen]

Kingdom of rot the bastard will rule
Stinking of death, zombies will roam
Through the whore the world was crushed
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust

Licentious masses rejoicing in sin
Larva faced sluts fucking the ghouls
The rancid bodies will copulate
Their barren world they repopulate

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate
