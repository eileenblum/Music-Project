[Music - P. O'Brien, Lyrics - P.Mazurkiewicz]

Immence oceans of gore, rivers of pus, mountains of bones
Rapture, fester in filth, abnormal wealth, immenced in a world of decadence
Ecstacy in decy, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure 
Pervading of vicera
Rejoice in gristly disgust
Exorbiant reality
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates 
Ecstacy in decay, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure
Pervading of vicera
Rejoice in gristly disgust
Exuberant castigation
Wading in bile, soaking in guts, ancient inards

Immence oceans of gore, rivers of pus, mountains of bones
Rapture, fester in filth, abnormal wealth immenced in a world of decadence
Mind altered, eternally fetid cadaverous empire
Squelched domain
Swamped ruins, dismal necrotic incarnate metropolis
Lost dwelling
Exorbiant reality
Obfuscated ossuary
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates
