[Music - J. Owen, Lyrics - P.Mazurkiewicz]

Black forest of evil, a demons possession
A beast in the wild with nocturnal dementia
Unearthly revival of clandestine extinction
Reborn creature, malicious being
Resurgance of a grusome species
With carnal obsession, it lusts copulation
Scent of fresh human blood invades its dominion
Surrounded in darkness, she enters a realm of hell
Infernal quest from a savage of death
Brutal attack, the innocent are unprotected
Hellish fury, deviance provides conception
Vicicious onslaught, its primal lust instinctual
Macabe fuckfest, inside her cunt, the brute's erection

Raped by the beast
Anamialistic, pure hideous appearance
Repulsive re-existence, bearer of morbidity

[Solo - Owen]

Ritual, habitual
Black forest of evil, a demons possession
A beast in the wild with nocturnal dementia
Scent of fresh human blood invades its dominion
Surrounded in darkness, she enters a realm of hell
Raped by the beast
