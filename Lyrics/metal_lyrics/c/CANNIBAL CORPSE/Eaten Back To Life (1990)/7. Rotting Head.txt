[Lyrics by Jack and Chris]

A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell
Hidden from the prying eyes of curiosity
Experimental surgery made him what he is today
His head is rotting but his body lives on as a worthless vegetable
Unknown to mankind, the incredible power of his mind

Hideous heredity, genetic imbalance, resorting to cannibalism
A feast begins as the patient's skull is cracked open like a walnut
Brains devoured in a frenzied slaughter, thrist for gore nothing more
Bile is dripping, pus from wounds, as the coroner drinks it down

The sights before your eyes you can't describe
A trip through this living hell will rot away your skull

Genital lacerating, anal asyphyxiation
Blockade of bowel passage, defÃ¥cation, hemmorage
Cadaverous mutilation, metamorphial radiation
Devourance of arteries, decapitated extremeties
Cranial excavation, cerebral liquidation
Brain turned to soup, ears are dripping goop

Slimy, cozing, dripping pus, torn out fingernails starting to fuse
Shredded cartilage victim lies, eye sockets, but no eyes
Miles of intestines strewn all about, facial features strickened with gout
Hanging bodies dripping with blood, the blackened fluid sinks in the mud

[Solo: Bob]
[Solo: Jack]

A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell
