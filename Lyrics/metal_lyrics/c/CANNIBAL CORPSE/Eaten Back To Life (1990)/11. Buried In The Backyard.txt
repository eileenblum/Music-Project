[Lyrics by Chris]

To kill, is why I live
My God, gives eternal life
Slice you, i watch your blood flow
Rotten brains, I feed 'till I'm full
Pressure building, the body starts to swell

The souls of my victims brings me great power
Feasting on flesh by the hour
Lungs explode as I cave in your chest
Probing through your organs - searching for meat
Chewing the heart of my kill builds by evil will
Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice
I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight
To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill worship me below
I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity
Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty

In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell
Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know
My armies of zombies will inherit the earth, and answer to my spells
Mutilated the human race in search for immortals

I drag the carcass home, it feels stiff and cold
Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul
Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood
Its death flows through my body, indulge in its pain

Crucifixion in the cemetery, awakes the dead from their sleep
Rising from their graves, to devour the weakened mortals
Under my control, I own their tortured souls
