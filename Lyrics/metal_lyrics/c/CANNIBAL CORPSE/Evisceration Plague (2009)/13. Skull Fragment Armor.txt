[Bonus track]

Adversaries will cower
In the wake of his appearance
Clad with remains of their friends

Bludgeoning them with power
As they strain to make a defense
The bringer of death descends

Skull fragment armor
It's a trophy of war

Pieces of cleft craniums shield the gore

Towering clad in bone
Cranial plate mail spattered
With the blood and brains of the foe

Murdering dozens alone
Countless skeletons shattered
Rivers of fresh blood will flow

Skull fragment armor
Designed by the cruel

Decimation is the only rule

Hewing through a frightened face
His rotting visage gleaming
Demented lust for violence and pain

Impervious to counter-strikes
He mangles without feeling
Only satisfied when all he sees are slain

Another head collapses
His spiked club dripping brain
Torrents of blood are gushing from the hole

Towering over corpses
Nothing here still living
He begins to scavenge, a killer with no soul

Skull fragment armor
Is a trophy of war

Pieces of cleft craniums shield the gore
