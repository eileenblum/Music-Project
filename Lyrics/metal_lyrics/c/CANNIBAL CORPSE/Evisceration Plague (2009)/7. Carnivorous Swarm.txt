[Music By Pat O'Brien, Lyrics By Paul Mazurkiewicz]

Stain the sky Armageddon
Dormant mass now awakened
Summoned fury devastation
Enormous force annihilates
All that breathes shall be engulfed
Within its path everything dies
Ravage the earth
Conquer its life
Here to devour
Vicious attack
Ferociously savage beyond a primal desire
Horde of the apocalypse arrives
Bombardment from oblivion
Invading legion gorges
Eradicate through infestation
Horde of the apocalypse destroys
Strike begins
It is a battle that is one sided
Swarm consumes
Droves assail
Congregation with aggressive nature
Swarm of death kills
Stain the sky Armageddon
Dormant mass now awakened
All that breathes shall be engulfed
Within its path everything dies
Ravage the earth
Conquer its life
Here to devour
Vicious attack
Ferociously savage beyond a primal desire
Horde of the apocalypse arrives
Bombardment from oblivion
Invading legion gorged
Eradicate through infesting
Horde of the apocalypse destroyed
Strike began
It was a battle that was one sided
Swarm consumed
Droves assailed
Congregation with aggressive nature
Swarm of death killed

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Ravage the earth
Conquer its life
Here to devour
Vicious attack
Ferociously savage beyond a primal desire
