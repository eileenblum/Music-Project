Die every day
Dying for years now
Kill every day
Killing for years

Revive every day
Reviving for years now
Kill every day

You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark
I see the light

Die every day
Dying for years now
Kill every day
Killing for years

Revive every day
Reviving for years now
Kill every day
You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark
I see the light
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be

Die every day
Revive every day
Kill every day

Die every day
Always the same
Killed every day

Dying for years
Revived you for years
Kill you for years

Killing for years
Always the same
Killing for years

Die every day
Revive every day
Kill every day

Die every day
Always the same
Killed every day

Dying for years
Revived you for years
Kill you for years

Killing for years
Always the same
Killing for years
You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark
I see the light
A light so dark controlling me
Altering who I'm supposed to be

Choking
Starling
Breathless
Asphyxiate
Lifeless
Gasping
Breathing
Resuscitate
