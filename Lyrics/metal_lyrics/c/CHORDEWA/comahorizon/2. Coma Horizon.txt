Inner path of the reality
Reflects the projection of gravity
Coma eyes of mine
Icon of the burden

Behold the stars through the coffin
I swallow white
And vomit the black sun
In avant-garde of psycho spectral colors

Psy fall stands steel
In the fabric of rational mind
Invincible...
Inner icon of the future
Coma horizon of mine

Instants of present
going away to past
Space of blackened visions
And glimmering points of light
