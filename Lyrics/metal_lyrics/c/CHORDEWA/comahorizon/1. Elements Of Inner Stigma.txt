Avant-garde of existing space
Within the void mindthreads desert
An expanse of hallucinations
With inherent scar of perversions

Expectancy of arcane genesis
Worthless word carved deep
Feeding you lies and fears
With notional perfection

Kiss of the snake from inside
Eyes of tomorrow are raped and descend
Psychic frame of mind is logically ill
Pretends to be real

Eye contemplates your perplexed existence
Psychic stigma comprehension fails

Maggot of truth
Venom magnet future
