Spectrum of what dying eyes reflect
Collects the congeries of abstract kinetic
Utter comprehension
Depends of the notional knife of the creator

Dense night prodigious attraction
Elemental
Mayhem of your parts
Naked and skinless confront reality
On the side of shattered neural trust

Ascension to the point of the realview mirror
By the chariots of the Electric Emperor
Through haze my abstract kinetic is more real
Then you're feeling of quenchless reality
