Intimate chaos
Spine of fierce tarn
Tarn of unpromising maze
Deifies the cosmic wide spiral
Serpentine light of sulphur flame
Entwined cold open eyes
Witnesses the face of lethiferous pain

Izard of my grey feathers
Can't touch the sanctity of your sulphur
Vortex of unwritten matters
Entwined cold open eyes
By mechanical reckless motion
And you stand...

Alone in the dance of death
Dwell in the glance of frost
Distant fragments of infinite
Take off my wings

Vortex of unwritten matters
Serpentine light of sulphur flame
Entwined cold open eyes
By mechanical reckless motion

Vacuum of intimate construction
Like a stentorian giant
Casts our time to forgotten depth
And adorns with stars
A thousand senses of pain
