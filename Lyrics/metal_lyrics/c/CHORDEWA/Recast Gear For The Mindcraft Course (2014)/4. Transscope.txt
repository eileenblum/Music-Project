Ecstatic never ending painting
Time brush plays again
Cyclic matrix compositions
Are the keys to wake?
Intellect frame never broken mirror
Does not reflect the trail
An independent mind signal
Eats the Tail again

Futurefind compass stops
In all of 4 directions
Quintessence of the paradox?
Exclusive hibernation

All my 5 senses in 3 dimensions
Convert into dynamic pressure
Of the expanding highly supersonic spirit
Beyond an empty agony
And every exploding pulsar
To search for 6 and 4

Futurefind compass stops
In all of 4 directions
Quintessence of the paradox?

I walks alone and walks beyond
In all of the 4 directions
By seeking lens of my TransScope
Through stars and constellations

My mindâ¦
â¦magnet and repress the stress
To compress time-varying
All dimensional essence
Into the perfect mentation
