As the time we have no return options
A subject of the perfect transmission
Affective and intangible existence
Art of fragile mindshifts is undercosmos pearls

Mind chameleon path cross the spectral fields
A sign lock in the dust of the future world
Configured in the mirage without the limits
Electric shifts of mindâs battlefront

There was nothing inside the collection of reality
I recreate my cosmos in a new design
Psyche in the shell practice with repulsive theory
On a map of my navigation

Pseudo presence line
Altogether apart Pseudo presence mind
The third eye
Silver line of ice
Mind is white
The speckless blind
Altogether apart
Aimless avoided life
Landscapes of ice
Silver Sea of the mind

Orchestral glass shatters within psychotic eye
Like an atom of nuclear incarnation
As the time we have no fatal line
I can always play in my comprehension

There was nothing inside the collection of reality
I recreate my cosmos in a new design
As the time we have no fatal line
I can always play in my comprehension
