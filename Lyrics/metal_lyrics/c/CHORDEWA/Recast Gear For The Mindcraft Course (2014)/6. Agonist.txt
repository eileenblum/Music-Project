Soul...
You leaving
Swallows the time
Swallows my mind
Coldâ¦
Insistent
Universe is open wide

No more time to breathe
No life to exist
A new form of spirit
A new born Agonist

When the speed of sound Is my ultimate lover
When the speed of light I'd raped for the other
Trip to absorb the infinite

Is it the great one truly sense I want?
A porn print of paradox
A cold kiss of paragon
Closing what's opened
Open the deep down
Experiment to see mind's mutation

Through deep dark of the light
I walk forth instead to take the time to breathe
When you can't see â
Mind absorbs the infinite

The infinite
What you can't see
Swallows the time
Mind is open wide

I walks alone and walks beyond
Beneath within the absolute
