Bizarre thoughts â tainted clockwork
Riddle core wherein mind rifts
Turbulent agony is norm

Fracture depth of inner world screen â tragedy
Sterile grain â mannequin numb
Print of faith on canvas slit recreate
Crossbreed of Â«IÂ» and framework shell

My spiral spine grown in a trice
From the both ends
Engineering tentacles
Of timeless D.N.A. pulsing without cease
From the soul sphere
Of mindcrocosmic genesis

My spiral spine taintedâ¦

Pull the trigger
Eat this tempest
25 years I gravitate towards
The atomcode to clone time
And to linger on the masterplan
To resize tomorrow

My spiral spine grown in a trice
From the both ends
Engineering tentacles
Timeless D.N.A. pulsing without cease
From the soul sphere
Of MINDCROCOSMIC GENESIS
