Look around
What's going on?
Hatred &amp; fear
Violence &amp; anger mounting daily
People running, afraid of the dark

Put down
Talked at
Spit on
I've had enough
Shut up
I'll fucking kill you

Stand up
Slapped down
Ripped off

What are you going to do?

I'm sick of hearing that
There is nothing we can do
I'm sick of hearing nothing
Ever change
What we change changes
What we do gets done
The time seems like forever till
You're there, then it's done
We are running out of time
The problems of this world
Are not going to go away
The problems of this world
Are not going to go away

The time to make the change is now
