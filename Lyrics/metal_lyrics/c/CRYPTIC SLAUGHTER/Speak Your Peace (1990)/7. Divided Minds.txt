Printed word of a divided mind
What you read here is just a lie
What you see here you won't find
Start looking for answers in your mind

In your mind, in your mind
Start looking for answers in your mind
In your mind

Keep waving your crosses while you lie in wait
Keep pleading your causes while you sow your hate
You want control so you deceive
With knowledge withheld
We recede!

Unceasing questions of wondering minds
You try to crush them to see what's inside
You see the danger, we call it change
I see the end of your lies and our chains

In my mind, in my mind
I see the end of your lies and our chains
In your mind
