Gleaming castles built on bones
There's people dieing don't you know?
You never give you only know how to take
They beg for bread but you say let them eat cake!

Deathstyles of the poor &amp; lowly
Brought to you by the rich &amp; greedy
Doomed to a life of existence at best
But all you say is fuck the needy!

You know I need to know why?
Why they have to die?
Please tell me, why!

Modern condo is your sign of class
Looking down on the lower mass
You're always living like a king
But no, you never share a thing!
You hoard and hoard but never use a drop
No, it sits in warehouses to rot and rot
The poor stand hungry but you pass them by
You know I need, I need to know why?

Deathstyles of the poor &amp; lowly
Brought to you by the rich &amp; greedy
Reality check: life's not like TV
The world's filled with the poor &amp; the needy

You know I need to know why?
Why they have to die?
Please tell me why?
