Thoughts of war, complete destruction plaguing
My brain
Desperation of a world, when will it change
The need for peace the need for something to
Give me hope
Cause this planet soon will reach the end of its
Rope

Governmental bureaucratic assholes tell me that
All is well
They also tell me that to have peace, stockpiles
Must swell
It seems to be though that their logic somehow
Just doesn't work
They must take us for jerks

Insanity by the numbers
Pushing till we break
It's insanity by the numbers
How much more will we take

We always sit and let them push us around
This is democracy let's stand our ground
For death is certain and life is not
Don't waste the time we got

The final countdown's slowly ticking away
On a clock that's gonna fucking blow us away
We're fighting for our very lies
Do we die or survive

Funny how we've seen its power yet we still build
Wasn't Hiroshima enough, 92,000 dead
But still this insanity keeps on dragging me down
What is this fascination they have with zero ground

It's insanity
