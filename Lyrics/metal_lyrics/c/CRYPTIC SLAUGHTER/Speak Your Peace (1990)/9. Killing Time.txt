Pressures press
Your station set
Cut your groove
In the bench
Release control
It's for the best
Decrease your will
I'll do the rest

Reality is just a word
It's meaning so obscured
A tried and tested thing of which
I just can't be sure!

People laughing
Cause people died
They had it coming
And so they fried
A mockery
Of faceless men
The justification
Of their end

Get ahead then you're dead
- I guess I'll get behind
Search like mad but you've been had
- There's nothing there to find
Cause reality and sanity
- Are just a state of mind

The clock stops
The floor drops
From far away
You see yourself
Faces flash
Darkness comes
Now betrayed
Now undone
