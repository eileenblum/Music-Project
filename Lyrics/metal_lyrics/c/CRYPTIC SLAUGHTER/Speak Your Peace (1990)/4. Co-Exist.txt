Fear! A fear that is learned
- Somebody told you
Hear! What I have to say
- Or must I show you
We're! All in it together
- So don't believe the lies
You're! Gonna make a difference
- But only if you try

Round and round
We keep going
On a train
No sign of slowing
But I tell you it's
Got to slop
Beat a dead horse
Till we drop

Man! We all are the same
- There is no difference
Can't! We ever be one
- And see beyond the skin
Race! Is something to win
- But we keep losing ground
Peace! Before it's too late
- I want to hear the sound

A slight of hand a twisted mind
The touch of hate has made you blind
Fight in the streets can't get no sleep
Pushing and shoving we're in too deep
