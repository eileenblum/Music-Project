Driving fast of taking a blast
Living in a life that just won't last
Jump from a cliff or jump in a pit
Choosing the way your life will pass
Speed is obsessing
Shift into high
Burning so brightly
Raging to die

Who are you?
Can you still see?
Hating your life
Trying to be
Someone you're not
What do you want?
Open your eyes
See what you've got

Fanatics of god
Fanatics of sports
Everyone is a
Fanatic of sorts
Lives in excess
Lives that regress
Degenerated
Are the lives we love best
