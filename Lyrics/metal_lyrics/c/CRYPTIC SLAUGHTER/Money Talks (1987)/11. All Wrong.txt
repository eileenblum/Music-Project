How far do you think you can go?
On ignorance and what you think you know
And how far can you push me?
To get you to face reality
I try hard to deal with myself
You depend on drugs and anything else
Frustration controls your every thought
Loneliness is all that you've got
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
You're all wrong
Close-minded ignorance
You thrive on innocence
Close-minded stupidity
That's all you'll ever be
What is it you're trying to do?
Someday it'll catch up to you
You lie and cheat all your friends
You will meet a bitter end
