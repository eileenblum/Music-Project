Here's a group of right wing wives
Looking to get there faces on the news
Gonna tell us how to live our lives
Because of there ideals and there views
So our music deals with political violence
They say that it's corrupting the young
So what about the US defense
I suppose that it's made for fun
Who are you to tell us
How to express ourselves?
All you want for us to do
Is sound like someone else
So you think you're in control
Of the land of the free
Your censorship is bullshit
Hail the P.M.R.C
Bible-thumpers in every respect
Corporate pressures change the way we live
To burn the labels and kill the bands
So now real music is for the conservative
If we upset you're way of life
You'll throw us in jail and make us pay
Worse comes to worse and now we've learned
We're effected by every word you say
