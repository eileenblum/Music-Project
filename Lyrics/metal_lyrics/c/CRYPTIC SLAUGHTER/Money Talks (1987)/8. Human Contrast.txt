You tell me I can't have my say
Why do you give me a price to pay?
You tell me I can't make my stand
Do I have to prove myself a man?
I can't compare with your state of being
I can't compare with your state of mind
Do I dare ask what you're seeing?
Do I dare ask what to find?
You tell me I'm all alone
But at least I'm not another clone
You tell me the right way to act
But is your whole life so intact?
What is life like
Through the eyes of someone else?
Why be like the others
When you can be just yourself?
You tell me the place not to be
Obviously not in your society
You tell me what life is all about
In your mind there could be no doubt
