Somebody hassles you try giving them a ten
They'll probably never bother you again
Because money talks and people listen
To get rich is the American ambition
Money talks and people listen
To get ahead and get some more
That's what this country was built upon
And all it seems to stand for
So capitalism makes you free?
This is no democracy
We have no humanity
Not in this society
The disease of greed affects us,
I think it always has
Because nothing talks louder
Than cold, hard cash
We only care about how we can get more
This country has no use for anyone who's poor
The American dream completes the scheme
Exploit the poor without remorse
Social barriers, we lie to hide
Dog eat dog with our false pride
