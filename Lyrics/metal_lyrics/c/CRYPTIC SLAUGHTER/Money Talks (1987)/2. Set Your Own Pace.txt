What's your ambition?
Do you wanna go somewhere?
You wanna be somebody?
Do you think the others care?
They'll give you false ideas
And tell you what to do
They'll say it's alright
But you've been played a fool
(You have to) make your own decisions
And do things your own way
No matter what they tell you
You have to set your own pace
You think you're something special?
You'd better think again
You're old enough to kill
You just can't win
Even if you're young
You've just begun to fight
Just no way to win
But, you are in the right
No doubt in your mind
To do what you believe right
Let them try and stop you
You've just begun to fight
Believe in your own thought
There is no other way
Fight there unfairness
Set your own pace
