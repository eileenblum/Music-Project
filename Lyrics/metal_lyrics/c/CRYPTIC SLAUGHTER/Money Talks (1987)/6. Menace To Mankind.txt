I'm a threat to your way of life
A menace to all mankind
Is that what you think of me?
When all I want is to be free
Ronnie says he wants to help us
Bullshit, he'd rather kill us
To fulfill his insane cause
And burden us with two-faced laws
Speak for peace, as you spend for violence
Lives will cease, our voices silenced
War is death, and you will murder
Unheard screams, I'll just scream louder
Nuclear bombs are indispensable
My life to you is just disposable
You preach freedom, you make me ill
All you teach is how to kill
So while you all sit back and relax
A million die with one swing of an axe
Try and control the lives we lead
That type of life we don't need
