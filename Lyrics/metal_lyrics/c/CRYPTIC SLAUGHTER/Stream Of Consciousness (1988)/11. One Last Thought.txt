[Lyrics: Bill Crooks, music: Rob Nicholson]

Skating along upon thin ice
Of this thing we call modern life
Blinded by what we want to see
Believing that we're oh so free

Is there truth in anything today?
Is war really heading this way?
These are questions asked again and again
Endless circle where no one wins

Living with your resolutions
Is killing me one of your solutions
Behind the lines you plot and scheme
But some believe it's the American dream

Waking up every day is the same
Feeling that I'm a step behind in the game
Reasoning with you has proved no use
Rebellion seems to be our only truth

You think we're all just a fucking joke
Someday on those words you'll choke
Laugh at us as rebellion begins
Anarchy is rising again
