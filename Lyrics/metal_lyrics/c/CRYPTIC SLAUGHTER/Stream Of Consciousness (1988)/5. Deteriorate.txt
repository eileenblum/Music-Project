[Lyrics: Bill Crooks, music: Rob Nicholson]

The deterioration of modern society
Has begun for you and me
They put us down and keep us down
We protest silently
Living life day by day
A step closer to the sky
Seeing things that frighten you
Seeking now to die

Modern man's losing battle
To seal his own fate
Lost into a fading void
Prey to manipulate

What is really going on behind
Your cheap pathetic grin
Politically you've lied and
Morally you've sinned
Smiling as you lie to me
Prey on lacking minds
Locked out of your shallow world
Fearing what we'll find

Do you have opinions the thoughts
You've held so long
Inspired you to rebel against
What was and still is wrong
Reinforcement of rules at us with
Each and every day
To speak out to fight against
Provides another way
