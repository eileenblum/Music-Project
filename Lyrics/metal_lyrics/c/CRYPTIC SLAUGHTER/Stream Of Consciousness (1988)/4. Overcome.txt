[Lyrics: Rob Nicholson, music: Les Evans]

Time goes by as they feed the fire
The future now shows us what's to come
Vermin set in as they spawn the mire
Yet we anguish and more is done

The infection continues to demoralize
What is left will someday soon be nothing more
Our water and air slowly deteriorate
Just a mere shadow of what was there before

We've been overcome

Helping hand they wield a vice
Degrade our lives to iniquity
These are taxes hard at work
So why aren't they helping me?

The toxins destroy consume malevolence
And the politicians still can't compromise
Future youth are put forth in this vile world
In our society we still are brutalized

We've been overcome

Contamination
It's our future
Abomination
We must rise
