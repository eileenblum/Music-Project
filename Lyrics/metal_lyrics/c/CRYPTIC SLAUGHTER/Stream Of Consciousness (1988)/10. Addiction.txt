[Lyrics: Bill Crooks, music: Les Evans]

Corrupting the third world
Lying to appease
Destroying smaller countries
Comes to you with ease

Conquering the world
Pledging democracy
Leading us to ruin
Brink of insanity

Addiction to power
Killing to succeed
Addiction to corrupt
Doing as you please

Taking every bit
Bleeding dry the nation
Leading us to hate
Overbearing frustration

Marching through the world
Ticket to oblivion
Killing as a goal
Death among the living
