[Lyrics: Scott Peterson, music: Rob Nicholson]

You say I'll never succeed at anything I do
I should be more determined be more like you
Saying the road to your future is looking bright
All your saying is you can't tell wrong from right

Your climbing so high up the corporate ladder
Hurting people to do it but that doesn't matter
All that life is to you is how rich you can get
Someday there just might be nothing left

I got the last laugh
There's nothing you can do
I got the last laugh
Now who's laughing at who

All the pressure is building up inside of you
Too many responsibilities what are you gonna do
Your so afraid and won't admit the truth
You say it's not fair this should happen to you

Your out of work how are you going to survive
You don't have enough money to help stay alive
Too many decisions you don't know what to do
Now I'm having the last laugh at you
