[Lyrics: Bill Crooks, music: Les Evans]

Drift away into the shadows of your mind
Look within yourself and maybe you will find
What you have always been searching for
Turn the key and open up the door
Does someone tell you how to live your life?
Does someone tell you when you should die?

Do you really need someone to hold on to you
Have you finally found what you want
What you need to do

So drift away into the shadows of your mind
I hear you sat that life is so unkind
Do you feel that you are all alone?
Do you need something to call your own?
Sometimes I feel life moves too fast
So I go drifting and I'm never coming back

I drift freely into my open mind
I'm looking I'm searching but still I cannot find
The things I want, the things I need
The thoughts in my head only I conceive
There is a meaning to what I feel inside
Until I can find it, there is a place to hide

Do you really need someone to hold on to you?
Have you finally found what you want
what you need to do?
