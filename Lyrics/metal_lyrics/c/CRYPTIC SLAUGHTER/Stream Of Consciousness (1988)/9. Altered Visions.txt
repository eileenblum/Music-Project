[Lyrics: Rob Nicholson, music: Rob Nicholson]

My eyes see the subversion
Taking away the thoughts
Subliminal conception
It's image calls the shots
Temptation is alluring
I can't find the start
But when they walk beside me
In death I will take part

It fills my mind beyond restraint
What can I see
My feelings are felt far away
Only way to me
In pain I scream my life away
No one listens
This beast has thrust it's claws in deep
Altered visions

When I reveal this fantasy
There are no friend or foe
Others will live my reality
Relapse to what I know
Lunacy thrives throughout my veins
You won't see me crack
I'll change myself in every way
Before this life goes black
