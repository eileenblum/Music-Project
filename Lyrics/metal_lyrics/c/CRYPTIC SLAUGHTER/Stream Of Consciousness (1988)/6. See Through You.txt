[Lyrics: Scott Peterson, music: Les Evans]

I can see right through you
A little game with no rules
I can't believe you're so cruel
But to you it's nothing new

Think you had me in your trap
But it's a little game I played
Making it seem there was nothing wrong
Now it's time for you to pay

Wait 'til it's my turn - see through you
Then you will soon learn - see through you
Our lives aren't quite the same - see through you
It's time to end the game - see through you

It was a little game to mess with my head
I was stupid to follow, I was mislead
Believed everything that was said was true
But I was used for far too long by you

My life to you is just a game
And I'm going to end it now
So it's time for my revenge
Don't worry when,you should worry how
