Mad - mutually assured destruction
Mad - killed by inner combustion
Mad - death throughout the nation
Mad - total annihilation

Both Russia and the U.S.
Don't want to be second best
Build more bombs to be ahead
Until the day that we're all dead

I see no reason for us to fight
You are wrong and we are right
All the money that you've spent
Should be used in disarmament

Join the army, see the world
But you're signing up for war
Taught to kill men or child
The more you kill, the more they smile

After talks and all's been said
War is over, both countries dead
The people gone, now it's too late
We've all shock the hand of fate

The children of today
are the killers of tomorrow
Nothing in their future
except for pain and sorrow
They'll send us off to war, 
to pay their cost
Even if the war is won,
we're the ones who lost
