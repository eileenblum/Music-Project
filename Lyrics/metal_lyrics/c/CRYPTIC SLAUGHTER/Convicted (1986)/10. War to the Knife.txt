Onward in battle,
soldiers aware of their fate
Following orders, 
though those we fight don't we don't hate
Murdering children,
nothing will stand in our way
Destruction of life,
but we are the ones who will pay

Slaughter their faith
Killing their youth
Raping their land
By the blood of my hand

Thousands of troops,
brought here against their will
Innocent youth,
trained and forced to kill
Jungle warfare,
can't fight what we can't see
Senseless death,
the harsh reality

None of our business, but still we intervene
Untold horrors the public has not seen
Police action, it's not a real war
Foolish pride is what we're fighting for
