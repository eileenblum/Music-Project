You say you want to help me
I know it isn't true
Useless lies behind my back
I'm not a stupid fool

I don't need a lying friend
The kind I'd rather kill
You'd better think suicide
Before I live my will

You know that you're a hypocrite
I really hate the way you live
You deserve anything you get
We won't put up with hypocrites

You look me in the eye
Tell me I'm your friend
Then I catch you lying
Time and time again

I confront you with my hatred
But you just deny
Just another day for you
And just another lie

So long sucker, you pushed me too far
One too many lies, now you're seeing stars
Lies to reality, now you've met fate
Life for you is over, for you it's too late

You think you can get away
Someday I'll make you pay
