In this country, we live and we die
Paranoid violence, we're sick of your lies
Hatred runs deep in the eyes of the youth
Your prejudice is sickening,
We'll make the our own truth

A country's sin
Or society's bait
We're stuck in
A nation of hate

Used and abused, we can't take anymore
Stay out of our life, we can fight our own war
You fucked up this world and left us to rot
Now instincts and bullets are all that we've got

Africa's dying, why should we care?
We've got our own problems, no money to spare
We have to buy nuclear bombs so we'll prove
With no future coming, we've got none to lose
