Superior attitudes
Change the way to think
If you don't get your way
You'll just sit back and sulk

Do you know who I am?
Do you really care?
You think you've got me figured out
You think your world is fair

You live your little world
That's what I don't get
You make it all for yourself
So no one else can fit

You are the majority
The world consists of you
We'll just wait and see
Who's been played the fool

You've built your little world
Now you're stuck for good
Now there's no coming back
There's nothing you can do
