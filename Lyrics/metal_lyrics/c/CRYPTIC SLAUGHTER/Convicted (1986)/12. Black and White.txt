Violence throughout the land
Racial groups, they plan attack
I'm tired of white man's crimes
It looks to be for good this time

Brother and brother
They kill one another
Without a real cause
Fight for what's fair
For what's really theirs
Only to get themselves lost

Whites took the land from the blacks
Killed their children to keep them back
Stole their land and shot their pride
Started up this useless fight

Riots start as whites flee
Their last chance to be free
Rocks fly throughout the skies
A gun is shot, a child dies
