Time goes by and makes me
Wonder what I'm here for
I'm waiting for a sign or
Someone to open the door 

At times my life seems at an error
Without a real purpose
Will I survive problems in my head
And beneath my own surface?

What the hell is going on?
I feel like I'm dead
Is it life around me
Or am I fucked in the head?
I'm tired of hypocrisy 
And murder by the state
I'm sick of your stupid lies
You tell us it's okay

Life seems at an end
Death is on your back
Ronnie and his generals
Just sit back and laugh

Time for you to act now
To make one final stand
There is no alternative
Your life is in your hands

You think that you're the only one
To solve your problems with a gun
Does it make u feel like a man
To take a life in your hands?

There is no way out
You'll just have to fight it out
No useless world to save
Nuke threat and no escape
