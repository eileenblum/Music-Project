You were convicted of a crime
Now you're out, you served your time
With no skill, what can you do?
Got no education, you're nobody's fool

On the streets, you'll have to steal
Got no money for a nourishing meal
A losing battle, you can't survive
A ringing in your head, pain in your eyes

No friends, no fun, no life to lead
No job, no pay, you can't succeed

Always hear "no," a door in your face
Keep to yourself, stay in your place
You've lost your will, you have no care
Society's outcast, and it's not fair

You start to run, maybe get away
You can't hide it, it shows in your face
I know you've tried, you begin to realize
The only way out, you come to suicide
