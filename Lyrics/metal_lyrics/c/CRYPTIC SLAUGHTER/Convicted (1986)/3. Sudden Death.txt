It's always wrong, never right
It's always such a useless fight
Living life with nothing to gain
Tired of feeling burning pain

Could hang it high
'Til I die
Could slit my throat
Who would know?
Could blow my head
'Til I'm dead
Could hold my breath
For sudden death

I'm waiting for a sign
That it's time for me to die
Now it's time for me to step
Into nothingness
