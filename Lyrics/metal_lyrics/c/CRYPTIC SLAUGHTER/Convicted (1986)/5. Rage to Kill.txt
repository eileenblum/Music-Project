A victim is chosen
His future awaits
Someone is watching
No one can tame
Satisfied hunger
Hatred within
Can't go on longer
Internal conflict

The psycho wants
Innocent blood
Kills without fear
Living a hell
Tortured by guilt
Outrage survives
Violence, his truth

Rage to kill
Blood will spill
Blinded sight
Lie from fright
With no compassion
Fear breeds his hate
Constantly watching
Deceiving the state
Threatened by no one
Too smart to get caught
Always remembers
The hatred he fought

He cried out for help
But nobody hears
He knows that he's insane
Reflecting his fears
Only a shotgun
Will answer his prayers
Attacking society
Because nobody cares
