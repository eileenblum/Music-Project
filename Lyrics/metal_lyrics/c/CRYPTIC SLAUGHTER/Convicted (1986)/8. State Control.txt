Born to live, then to die
Never ask the question why
State control by mindless men
Believe in death, they live to win

State control - your time has come
Mind control - go get a gun
Life control - you'd kill to win
State control - they've won again

Shoot you down again and again
Want to live, your biggest sin
Fight the system, only to die
It's hard to live with hate and lies

Take your mind, programmed to kill
Make you fight against your will
Sadistic men obsessed with death
Shot in the back, lose your breath
