In my dreams I've drowned,
awoken I have choked
the horrors behind my soul
showed me a garden
full of bones

The streets I run they whisper
your ghosts are your failure
you've bet so much,
you've won an empty corpse
you've put your hope
to the stranger in the mirror

Someone gave me the chance to choose,
I didn't ask for that
and I would mind not being free

But the hell that it takes to wake up
to embrace the power I should need
to live a life of joy,
a life of joy and greed
and no one ever will teach
how happiness gets seed

In my crooked state of mind,
this whisper it greets me one more time
stop following dear conscience
but the voice, it still resumes
what have you done to yourself
what have you done to the other
yes, I'm ashamed
I attempted no harm

Everyone feels lost in a time
but time is the thing that I've lost
when my heads in the sky
there are no doors locked

And every day I wish for the people
who have saved my past,
because the present has stolen my laugh
the future, the only way to go
one day in the afterlife,
I'll leave behind that rope
