In years I've tried to make you smile
your view was just reserved for despite
you've forgotten all the things that I've done
so I'll forget the mask that I've won
the hardest part is living

I won't sopt counting days
I won't stop soacking my blood
I won't stop closing my eyes
until hell receives my guts

this is a breaking point,
but the devil is a part of mine
withouth pity
we are all born to die,
but the devil is a part of mine

I won't stop counting days
I won't stop soaking my blood
I won't stop closing my eyes
until hell receives my guts

I won't regret what I have sold,
you'll never get what I have born
this hate this rage that we have felt
this love and borders we have grown
fell now to ashes
and the fault is our own

Because as long as I will live
death himself will eat my soul
the hardest part is not forgetting

I won't be weak
but you have pushed your nays to deep
and the poison in my heart
you've injected, has stolen my sleep

I won't regret what I have sold,
you'll never get what I have born
this hate this rage
fell now to ashes
and the fault is our own

I wish you all the best my dear,
one day we all will smile,
but I will promise you my dear
you lose yourself in all your fails
but I will promise you my dear
you'll lose yourself in all your fears
you disgusting piece of sadness
one day we all will smile
