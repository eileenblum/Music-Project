I will remember, I will remember
I have surrendered, without any tender
I have no sight for what I should have
beauty is lost, my eyes are so blind

Illness inside, health is a crime
crowning a win, selling a lie
silence caused my ear to deafness,
life is louder I can bear

Breathing underwater,
words swimming in the air

I learned to live, I learned to be
and it feels like death is following me

I will remember, I will remember
I have surrendered, without any tender
I have no sight for what I should have
beauty is lost, my eyes are so blind

I will remember, I will remember
I have surrendered, out from the ember
like a ghost, like a ghost,
with broken neck I've reached no coast

I'm not sure if I'm talking in tongues
what means a word behind I can't hide
I'm not sure if am talking in tongues
what means a word, if letters can't cry

I won't reply all the questions
while death holds my hand
my life broke apart,
before it began

Keys to a hollow life
born with this regret

I am aware of myself
in the most precious way I live
but I didn't know
how hard it could be
to ruin myself for a life I can't see
