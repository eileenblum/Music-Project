With the Sun, that we share
comes the disease,
that we taste
It's a curse which I trust,
a path of resignation and waste

I am still restless, oh I am so restless
all I know is my passion
blinded form gifts we wish for
together we lighten the dark
and fight for our progression

Stabbed by shadows
I can't resist
my bed feels like a gallow
I can't adjust

This is just the beginning,
or is this the end of believing
everything we remember
is our loved ones disappearing

Nearby there is desperation
and so often they have said
everything is going to be fine in the end
everything is going to be fine in the end
and if it's not
it's not the end

The reflection of our own
is a frightening chapter of insecurity
we think too much about the way we die
and less about a life concept of quality

Mother, you've become a shadow
Father, our lives have been a lie
beloved I live without intention
inside you've died so long ago

It's a curse which I trust,
a path of resignation and waste

We were born and we learn,
but words are like wind

Hope seems sometimes to burn
the brick we call life
we can't kill what we earn
hope seems sometimes to burn
this brick we call life
there is no return

This is just the beginning,
or is this the end of believing
everything we remember
is our loved ones disappearing

Once again all the same stories
but in the end we all have to try
to seek the answer
we have to try living in a world we hate
so unprepared for the end
I hope there's something that is worth living
more to give than fallen memories
please show me life's worth living
