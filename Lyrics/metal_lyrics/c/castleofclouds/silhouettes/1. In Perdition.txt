You are painted like no one else,
not the former grey, around us all,
we grew like webs, beneath our hearts,
we breathe and sleep, in orphan arms

All seems gone, all seem done,
All seems so far away

With reckless hearts,
we drew ourselves,
for our loss its sake,
we hid in the void,
but now youÂ´re the grey

With reckless hearts,
IÂ´Â´m not sure, who I am
circled from divided lies,
but now youÂ´re the grey
IÂ´ve never felt free

We drowned our home
weÂ´ve gone astrayÂ´

Smiles have disappeared

Living at itÂ´s finest truth,
Words we heard, the words we spoke
Witnesses of stolen dreams

I wonÂ´t be the last,
with a graveyard under my chest

We drowned our home
death is in the air,
We drowned our home
WeÂ´ve ended, in despair

Cut up, move the clouds, and I see, now I see
suns have changed
shades got bright
showed up light for
who we are

We are the grey,
we drowned our home
as it may be
I wont loose faith

We are the grey
