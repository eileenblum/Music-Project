Diving into prodigious landscape beyond experience
Stars have died in this desolate wasteland of infinity
Limits collide and shatter into endless parallels
Physical form has ceased to exist, only spirit without carrying form

Outside the form as the breath of howling winds and darkness
The world never appeared in reality nor even a wretched dream
Black holes open wide in between the galaxies unseen
The consciousness has escaped from its bounding walls

Open wide the gates to unreality...
Disappear into the waving stream...
Darkness as your guide..
Devil in your veins..
