Spirits of multiverse
Unspeakable presence of malice
Heading towards the infinite

Ordained with crown of disdain and irreverence
in the principality of nightmares' inheritance

Rays of the addling planets
intoxicating,contaminating

Wretched distortion of light
Inanimate ventures to struggle

View bleeding in coma
Shapes dancing around a pallid scenario
Wrapped in murder

Hours go by as the lights grow dim
paintings of black and red on the floor
Silence engraves these wounds
Serenity of evermore
