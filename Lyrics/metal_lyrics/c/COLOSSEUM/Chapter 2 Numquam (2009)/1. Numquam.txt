Wavering empty minute when existence flows towards its persistent fate
Blear imagery before your eyes
Seen defeat behind glass, mantles of smoke

Asking nevermore what went wrong
Scars shall heal no more
All you gave wasn't worth a dime
Empty stare - bleeding wrists

...and not a single smile will ever appear on your face

Emotions decay and pass away
Rotten corpse of compassion ravaged and raped
The air is grinning wheeling colours of the womb
Born again while perished
