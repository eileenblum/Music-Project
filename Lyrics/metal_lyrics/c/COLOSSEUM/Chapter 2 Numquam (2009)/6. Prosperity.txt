Great abundance of grief, prosperity of poverty and wealth of misery prevails
Losses you gain with weakness as your power while rejoicing at your plentiful agony
Darkness as your guiding light, winter frost keeps you warm through the night
Gallons of absinthe to keep you sane, only death keeps you alive

Solitude as your companion and silence to hear your cries
Hatred for you to cherish and pain for you to enjoy effusively

Flying to stay on the ground, Fleeing to face the present
Touching the prosperity you always failed to see
