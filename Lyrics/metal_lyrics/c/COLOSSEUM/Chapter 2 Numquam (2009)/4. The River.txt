Staring to these white walls and waiting for them to vanish
Feeling of cold grows stronger and sight is blurring in these tired eyes
No questions remain anymore as they're all wiped away
Only this moment where time stands still reaching its limits
Stillness awaits while touching the calmness merged with pain
that soon will cease to be with my shattered consciousness
River is flowing down in constant movement, further down

Slow aching movement and last shadows of horror appear to this gruesome sight
Too weak to move anymore lying still awaiting the darkness to come
Sight is growing dim and white turns to black drifting away, away
Can't turn back the time, it's claws mangle what's left of me

No letters, no empty words...
