Moments languish in their absence while silence moans
Paralyzed in dormancy, lifeless slumber drowning in emptiness
Senses still flicker awaiting the hopeless awakening to a vague travesty of being
Carrying human body in a long dead soul

I've abandoned the flame once burning within
Seeking only the depths of fathomless stillness
Surrounded by wills of the wisp in this reeking swamp
Where demons swarm by my side

Once I gazed upon a mere reflection of light
As if through the eyes of the living
Reflection has gone and will never return
I curse this sight to the lowest pit of damnation
