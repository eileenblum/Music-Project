Shadow of myself or was it god
There's voices in the walls all around
Mocking my weary distress
Duplicating memories of nowhere
Aching inside convulsive sleep
Foam and worms among broken glass
Absence of time, abrasive roar
Why do you feed me with needles...
Why?

Trial shall open now
The mirrors awaken
Breeding monsters, demons within
Judge is me transformed, multiplied

There's no place for me to rest anymore
Torn from inside, bleeding in vain

There's no place for me to live anymore
Trapped inside the wait for a dawn that's never here

Writhing in terror
They're coming for me
Demons of my sleep returning through the ages
Calling for anyone, but none will hear
There's nothing more but the pain
This neverending pain

I bid farewell to everything and cast my last breath
Final touch of pain remains my dearest and only friend
