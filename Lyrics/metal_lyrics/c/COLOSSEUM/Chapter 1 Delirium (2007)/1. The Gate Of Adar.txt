I've gazed beyond the stars and infinite space
Beheld the dimensions unknown to man
I've shaken while seeing the laws of time and space crumble to the pits of pandemonic horrors

For what I've invoken can't be banished
and I'm too weak to fight
Alone I tremble in underground chambers of isolation

Pits where grotesque ungodly beings scream for centuries
Called beyond the universe of mortals
I've opened the gate and now it's too late
The Great One will appear, the ultimate death draws near
For Mankind

Tunnels filled with maddening stench of hell
Inbred creatures that will rip human flesh
Screams of pain and timeless terror
From below the day of doom shall come forth

Standing at the gate and waiting
Dark waters stir again
The coming of the apocalypse
Destruction of all that I've once held dear

Standing at the gate and waiting
Dark waters stir again
I suffer this terror until I face my death
With all mankind
