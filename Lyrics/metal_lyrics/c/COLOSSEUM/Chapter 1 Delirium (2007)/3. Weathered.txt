Vast fields of ice prevailed by gloom
Still they flicker in relentless storm
Echoes resound through the years
Silent screams that will never leave

Spheres of chaotic reign
Beyond sleep - bereft of life
Escape the earth through nebula
Enter the mind

Walking through the seasons unchanging
You saw the autumn long time ago
Winter's grasp choked its' quiet roots
Lying dead beneath the snow

Were you ever here at all
Absurd of absurdities
Now close yourself within unending sleep

Floating among angels of blood
Gargoyles chanting in circles of stone
Enter disappearance and blankness eternal
Gargoyles chanting in circles of stone
Beyond time
