Bleak time stands still here
Frozen vastness of nothingness
I feel nothing but pain
Can't escape the infinity of screams

I writhe in unending bliss of torment, neverending
So blind to my being that once existed beyond agony

Slowly I drift to slumber exhausting
to awake in another reality
More unforgiving and..
Cruel

Hollow walls painted with tears uncried
Sullen chambers for dead to lie

Close your eyes and try to see
Something that you've never seen
