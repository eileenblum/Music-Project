Cold within myself
I stare to empty gloom
Languishing years predicting the end
Were there even beginning at all

Lying above myself
Gazing at my body
Ravage of empty self
Pale soulless embrace

Opium has left my veins
Reality's gruesome knives lacerate my flesh
But I'll never cry

Please leave me be within these shades of grey
Soulless nonexistent flame must be extinguished without a single tear
