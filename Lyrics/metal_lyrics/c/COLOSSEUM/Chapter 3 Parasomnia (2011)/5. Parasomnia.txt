Still vast desert of being
Roaming and crawling through this empty field
Last autumn for somnambulist to drown
Aimless and forgotten, restrained and aching

Thoughts echo in parade of unforgiveness
The invisible dead march in solemn torment
Painful mirage strikes through your blinded eyes
Cranny for your disease - All you failed to achieve

Lungs are bleeding black
Nightmares are coming back
Awake from your illusions of hope
Mistaking for your surroundings in black empty space

You have not sensed the world for ages
You have not ever been present in this harsh reality
You painted your world to invisible cloath with grey and black
You have been the last drop of water in this now broken glass
