The mirror shows but half the truth
I am not only what they see
I hide behind my wicked mask
The face of him I long to be 

My fathers face reflects in mine
When they see me they think of him
They think I am what they can see
But I am more than flesh and skin 

What I can do, what I can be
Stays hidden in my twisted mind
They think I am a quiet boy
My wicked mask makes people blind 

My life is a play
The script always changing
I look into the mirror
And prepare for the charade 

Who I am, they can not see
While I am lying sick in bed
I wish everybody dead
Increasing madness in my head
