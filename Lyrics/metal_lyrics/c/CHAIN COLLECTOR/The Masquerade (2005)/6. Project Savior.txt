As mass hysteria breaks out
Beginning of the end
Paranoia reborn into society
The only law is survival
Sings of infection
Extreme aggressive behaviour 

Loss of memory
Loss of self
Bleeding eyes
The final symptom of conmination
Death expected to occur shortly after 

The divine intervention manmade
Survival ensured by death of millions
There can be only one nation
The can be only one savior
Manmade hell
Man remade death
Assimilate
Recreate 

Chosen are few
To survive the cleansing
Designed messiah's
Place made possible by arms
The nemesis virus
Project savior
Chosen are few 

Project savior
The only law is survival
End of contamination
Deconstruction complete
Man is no more
End of contamination
Project savior
Deconstruction complete 

Loss of memory
Loss of self
Bleeding eyes
The final symptom of contamination
Death expected to occur shortly after
