Do not speak of our laws
For there shall run no water in our blood
Born in the chain of command
We infiltrate
We annihilate
You shall not know us
For we carry our faces inside

Pray for me, pray for them father
For they do not know what they have done

Pre Chorus: The code of Silence
The blood of Family
We are the brotherwar
Vengeance is the one we call God

Pull the trigger, make him disappear.
Do not speak his name, for he is dead to me.
For there shall be no compassion, there shall be no mercy
To silence the blood, vengeance is the one we call God.

Hierarchy of murder
Scars worn with pride.
Cut deep when you first strike
Heavens key is forged in blood
The circle can only be uphold by the death of innocence
As the old world fades away, Sin City grows for every day.

Fire walk with me
Fire walk with me
