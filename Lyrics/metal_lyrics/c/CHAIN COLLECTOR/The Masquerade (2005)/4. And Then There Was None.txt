Monsters and man
Transforming
Becoming
The art which cannot be understood
By those lesser than me
I am god alike
Transforming
Becoming 

Enslaved by hatred
Forsaken by humanity 

For that. That should be broken
And never given life again
And then there was none
As the new world order dawns
Reject every compromise
For that. That should be broken
And never given life again
And then there was none 

Enslaved by hatred
Forsaken by humanity 

As the new world order dawns
Where there once was life
Buried are the remains of once man
Long gone, beneath the sand
Last was the mourning
Of what to come
Total annihilation
Come fourth undone
We are alone
And then there was none
