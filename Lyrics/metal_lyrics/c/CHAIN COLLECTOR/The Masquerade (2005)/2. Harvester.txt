Under the nameless one
The great overseer
By the command that holds all command
The final patterns speak with only one tongue of what to come
As the harvest commences
By the dead breath of my enemies
There shall be order again
Answers will not be given
And so we shall take them by force

I am the Plow
Harvester of red earth
God of childrenâs fall
He who walks behind mirrors
Harvester of red earth
God of childrenâs fall

Let the water give life
To the rotten corn below
Sharpen your scythe
That you shall reap the earth you saw
Beneath the roots
Where my children grow

Oh lord of the Harvest
Make me your fucking fist
Make me your servant
Oh lord of the Harvest
I giveth
And I taketh
Oh lord of the Harvest
I giveth
And I taketh

I am the Hammer
I am the Plow
The seed of disease that continues to grow
Within the eyes, that can only see so far
Shame brought upon the fatherâs heart
The man in the moon
Died to soon
And I was alone again
In my childhood
By the house that was not a house
Oh how I long for the flesh of man
