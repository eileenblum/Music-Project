Neverwhere
Will I be saved again?
In this place that keeps my memory still
Neverwhere is forever there
Neverwhere
Ooh, will I be saved again? 

In these dreams I have
I can still see
They took my eyes
But my heart is still free
For in the kingdom of the blind
The one eyed man is king 

Silent is the cradle of tomorrow
Asylum of thoughts
Dreamers divide
And we who are left behind
Have no voices to scream with
The lies of salvation
Redemption is my name
Neverwhere 

Everything was calm
Who do the sinners pray to?
I do not wish to know
For the evil man has their own god
And he carries no nail of ours
Who do the sinners pray to?
I do not wish to know
