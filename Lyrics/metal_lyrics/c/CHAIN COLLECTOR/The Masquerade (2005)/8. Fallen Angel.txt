Mankind was given mortal life
The joy of life fills the hearts of men
The children of man feel the rain
And the soft breeze touching their skin 

The angels were given immortality
Pure salvation fills the hearts of angels
The children of angels have never felt the rain
Or the soft breeze touching their skin 

The children of man
Are born with dreams
They dream of having
Wings to fly 

The children of angels
Have no imagination
They can fly
But they can not enjoy 

I dream without knowing how
I am a fallen angel
I dream of being a mortal man
I am a fallen angel 

The children of man
Are inquisitive explorers
They wonder and ask questions
They long for knowledge 

The children of angels
Are natives of eternity
They have got all the answers
They long for ignorance
