Winter princess, queen of snow
Hair of white and eyes of blue
In her artificial night
She does not dream like me and you 

Never ending freezing fever
Hallucinations turning real
Never ending freezing fever
Her open wounds will never heal 

Winter princess, cold as ice
Takes the heat of dreams apart
Fantasies of love and light
Can't survive inside her heart 

Winter princess, be my star
Tell me what to do and say
Make me cold and unaffected
Take my burning pain away 

Winter princess, girl in white
In her hand a frozen rose
Wind and storm protects her sadness
Dancing snowflakes where she goes
