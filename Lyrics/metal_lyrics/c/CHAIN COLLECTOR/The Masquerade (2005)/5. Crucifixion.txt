They took my body today
I saw them tear it to pieces
They filled my lungs with water
then gave me air again

My flesh was worth nothing
my blood even less
Their words were ice and fire
My answers silent as death

They were blind for my tears
They were deaf for my screams
They didn't know I was watching
They didn't know that I heard

They took my body today
but my mind is still free
They believe that I am dead
but I still think, and therefore I am...
