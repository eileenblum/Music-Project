Injection of self
Alteration combined mutilation
To live out their given days
Without possibility of pure offspring
Bloodlines collapse
Heritage drowned by filth 

Injection of mutilation
Alteration of self
Wheat have we become my children
Rejecting ourselves
The money that turns the wheel of fools
And still, oh still
We cry in the night
Tapping the vein of what's left inside 

The containment must be uphold
At any cost
Project hate
Tapping the vein of the master race 

The final instrument of genocide
Heaven sent to spread damnation wide 

The religions cry out
Plastic tears for your doubt
It will never change
Tapping the vein of religious pain 

Tapping the vein
Shall it never go away?
