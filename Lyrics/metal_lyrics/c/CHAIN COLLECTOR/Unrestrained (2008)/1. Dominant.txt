Always walk within the shadows
Never enter their light
Control the anger that controls your world
Stare objectivly upon them
Feed upon their hopes
Bring fuel upon their war but enter not their
Reality

Now feast upon the spine of their ideologies
Break their will from within then watch them
Hide behind the lies
Give them fuel give them fire burn them down

Dominant you shall stand there
Pulling the strings of a future world
Let the cleansing commence
Dominant you shall remain
Control the anger that controls your world
Let the cleansing commence
Dominant you shall stand there
Dominant

Throw the dice now
Play violently upon the strings of hate
Set loose the fear among them
Dominant we will remain

Cast your masks down
No need to hide now
Stare into their eyes
Throw the dice now
Play violently upon the strings of hate
