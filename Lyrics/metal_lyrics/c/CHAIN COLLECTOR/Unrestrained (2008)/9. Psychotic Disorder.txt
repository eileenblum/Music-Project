Let me in, now let me out
I've taking this punishment no escape in sight
Feel the iron walls tremble as the door closes

I want to stab you a thousand times and a thousand times over again
Take your last breath your last call grasping for air
The last thing that you shall see is the edge of a knife
I'm in this state of mind
Don't know right from wrong

I'm in a dream world filled with hate
Water from the eyes dripping down on me
I'm lost with no exit sign in sight

Oh it's fucked up no control, totally out of it
I don't know what to do
I'm strangled in between thoughts
A twilight zone my own private hell
Screaming voices of agony will forever be in me

My self inflicted wounds scorn in hate
Cruel intentions roar in the sub conscious
Creating a false state of mind
I do not belong in this world

My heart shattered like broken glass
Thousands of pieces of a time gone by
Never will I be the same again
New world open before my eyes
