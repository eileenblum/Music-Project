Hide within yourself in your haven
Whisper carefully your dreams
To every shadow in the room
Always hiding, trying not to breath
Embrace their perverted minds
Like a natural part of life

Touch the mirror once
And a glimmer of hope
Is this real just a dream?
When may I wake up from this pain?
Fear not for I am here
I'm lurking in the shadows

Tears be your only companions
They stroke your face like a ghosts hand
Collect your one way ticket to your destination
Approach your resting place

Dream yourself away
Soon you'll fade out

Hide within yourself in your haven
Whisper carefully your dreams
To every shadow in the room
Always hiding, trying not to breath
Embrace their perverted minds
Like a natural part of life
Close your eyes now and wish yourself away
Let us leave, leave the pain behind
Drink of your personal lethe and forget this place
Hand in hand with your shadows now walk away
