There is one eyed man in a tower
Gazing upon the blinded world with a sad heart

A theatrical scene dressed in a cloak of madness
Constant whispering voices bending the balance
Which part shall you take?
Lurk in the shadows or walk in the light?

Quick now before the starts
The pieces are moving
Nightfall dress the sky in black
A sudden silence before the rain

The elder sins anticipating
The unavoidable destiny of us all
A faint voice is heart
Now let it commence!

A last breath he draws
Finally closing the world outside
A grand play indeed it was
The gods themselves would have wanted an encore

The curtains close the final show is done
The crowd is gone a scene without a play
An author walks away with a grin in his face
His masterpiece is finally complete
