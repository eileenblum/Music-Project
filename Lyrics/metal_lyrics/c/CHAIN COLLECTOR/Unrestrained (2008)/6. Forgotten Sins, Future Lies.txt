In your own mind an image burns so bright
A dream of finally being free
Watch over me father for I have done no wrong

Rip the wings off the angels
And let them fall to the ground
Let them bleed for the sins they've done

Standing watching as forgotten sins become lies
Rip off the wings let them fall
Standing watching as forgotten sins become lies
Take my sins and hide them

Watch over me father for I've done no wrong

Slaughter them in thousands claim it in his name
Suppress them all and feed them your thoughts
Make them suffer for your cause
Never looking back
When will we learn not to bow down to any man?

Take my sins and hide them away
See them dress their thoughts up in clay
They watch them bleed for what they've done
Like needles deep in your eyes
You hear their lies
Cut them down, silence them
