I walk the path
Of condemned souls
Soft rain fall
From the stars
Embraced by the hands
Of the night
I walk on
Even further

Seek your heart and find the truth
Lure me not from the shadows
I wish not to enter the light
Walk with me in darkness

Guided by wings of ravens
Or by the brightest light
Choose a path and walk it
In a footsteps of a legion

The northern light dance upon the skies
The marionettes we stumble below it
A crown of thorns is presented to all
Accept it now and enter the gates

Guided by wings of ravens
Or by the brightest light
Choose a path and walk it
In a footsteps of a legion
