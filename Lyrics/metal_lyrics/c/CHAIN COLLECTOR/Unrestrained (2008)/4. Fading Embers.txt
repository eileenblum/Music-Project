Broken by the bleak reality
You stare at the infection
Life itself a disease you say
Feel the nails inside you
You swear always to be different
Break free from their chains
Crush their idealistic thoughts
Life itself keeping the chains tightened

Like a dying ember
You cry out for life
You flee from the light
And hide in the night
At the break of day
You seek the dark
You long for the night
It fills your heart

Burning hate flowing through your veins
You let it grow within you
Watch them spread their disease everyday
Like the pathetic insects they are
Crush their idealistic thoughts
Life itself keeping the chains tightened
You swear always to be different
Break free from their chains

Feed upon the virus
You cry out for life
Feel the growing hate
And hide in the night
Embrace it now
You seek the dark
And let it loose
It fills your heart

Hide your sins within you
Rest with them by your side
Make your own truth
Create your own true image
