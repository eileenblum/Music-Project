Closing my eyes I've never seen so clear
Seeing their intentions makes me sick
A cruel smile behind their broken masks
The true essence of their words revealed

Cast down the crosses that blind you
Let their lies burn to the ground
Now open your eyes and see
And you too finally can see it all

The letter I see the shadows of the reality
The letter I hear the echoes of their thoughts
The letter I see only the sparks from the flames
The letter I hear only fragments of the truth

Tell me which truth you seek and I will help you search
Think twice before you confess your thoughts
They may hold your fate and your demise
Split tongues yielding the poison
