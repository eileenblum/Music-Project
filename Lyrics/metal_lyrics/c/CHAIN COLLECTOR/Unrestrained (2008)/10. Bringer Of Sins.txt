Hear the violins play tonight
For they play the devil's tune
Draw your breath and listen
For they will come for you now

Streams of silver from her eyes
No tongue, no ears, only a child's eyes
Gently remove one limb at a time
Let her see them before her

Demons, arise!
They come each night
Like a thief in the dark
They leave without a trace

Smile to her as you fetch your blade
So silent she is...
Tears are all washed away
Finally she is no more

Streams of silver from her eyes
No tongue, no ears, only a child's eyes
Gently remove one limb at a time
Let her see them before her
Nothing but a limbless body left
Bring her a single red rose
Kiss her lips then put them back
For tonight she dines in heaven

The performance is done for tonight
An angels wings lies torn apart
Draw your breath and listen
For they will come once again

Tormenting your mind yet again
Bringing forth your darkest secrets
Sinful wishes walk hand in hand
Hiding from the sun for all time
