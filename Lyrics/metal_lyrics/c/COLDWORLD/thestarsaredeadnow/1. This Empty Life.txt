No one ever survived, in this empty life
This pleasure is to our, emerge with a star
You have not realy lived, your life has no goal
You watcher her getting old,
Your empty eyes can't tell no story
Your empty heart can't stay alive
You're empty and so paralized, almost nothing,
Makes you cry... this empty life 

Suffering, to be alive
Don't start again, to be alive
You are empty... 
In this empty life

Your empty eyes can't bare no sight
Your empty hope can't speak of her
Your empty heart can't bare a life,
You're good as nothing, makes you cry
This empty life
This empty life
This empty life
