A dark place called heart in a world as we know it
With a scar on the surface that lets us look inside and see...

Deviation from life
Devotion to the evil
Desperation to our divine

Misanthropic deeds

A battlefield full of rotting corpses
A massgrave full of radiative humans
A land full of hungry peoples
A church full of despairing prayers

H-bombs, terror, storms full of radiation
Oh yeah god loves us all

Screaming crying bleeding dying

From Mecca to Rome the books tell us a way of life
The rules are set just follow god and you'll be free

Just kill your fucking neighbor he doesn't act your books anyway
Fuck your fucking lies your divinity means nothing to me

I don't want to give my faith into a paranoid daydream thats questionless followed by the masses

I'm no part of your fucking game
I'm no slave to your higher fantasy
Millions of prayers tearstained to kneel down
Begging for a world that will never appear
The biggest sign of misanthropy
Was the invention of religions
God sent us his fucking abortion
To tell us how to live our life
Oh god your sheeps didn't learn a thing
Now nail your prayers to the cross
