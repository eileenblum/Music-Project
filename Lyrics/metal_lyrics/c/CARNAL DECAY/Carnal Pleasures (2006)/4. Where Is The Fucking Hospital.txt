[Lyrics taken from one of Kern's favorite movies, Toxic Avenger 4]

My arm is broken
My legs are fucked up
I've gotta pee like a race horse
Yes I do

Where is the hospital ahw shit
This ain't the fucking hospital
This is not the fucking hospital
Hey you've got a pisser in here

Cause I've gotta pee real bad

Oh my gosh who could do such a thing to a defenseless
Beautiful exceedingly attractive woman

I must free her yeah
Here I come Kabukiman to the rescue
