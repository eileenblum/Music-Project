My clothes are soaked by piss and blood
The beat of my heart is killing me

Not able to move my body out of here
No chance to scream cause no one hears my voice
Imprisoned in a cage of cowardice
No way out of this straight jacket they gave me

The more I cry for riddance the less I am heard
The more I cry for life the less I am embalmed

The salt in my raw I'm becoming frenzied
Gasping I'm creeping trying to breathe
My body's one itch I'm scraping confused
I hear the chuckle of thousands in my head

Darkness surrounds me
From inside
Every breath so savagely
An invisible strap strangles me
