I'm Excavating the exanimated / Open the coffin by main force / I'm wadisgusted vomiting bile / Iknow the I'm vile / Then seduction concuers my deeds / And the smell of rotting corpses drives me to a point of lust 

Molesting the Dead
Fucking a corpse is my addiction
Molesting the dead 

The corpse is laying right before me, I flail fer sevenfold / Her face is devastated her body destituted / Obsessed by desperation I ravish this clod slut / I chock her on a cross with not a stitch on her body / She's hanging there like Jesus Christ I'm fucking this cold whore / developing immense lust while I'm fucking this exanimated body 

She begins to convulse /Her stomach grows / Her raws disappear / Her pale face smiles on me  

My sperm was the drench to resurrect a corpse 

Her empty eyes are staring at me / Her frenzy smile craves for more/ Her empty eyes are staring at me / Her frenzy smile craves for flesh

Molesting the Dead

She's pregnant the demon needs to be feeded by human flesh / The fetus eats his mother from inside penetrates her stomach and looms

She's dying again with this frenzy smile

Our Breedthe carnivore comes to this world
