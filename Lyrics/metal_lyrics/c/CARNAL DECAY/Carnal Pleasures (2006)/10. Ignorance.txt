[Bonus Track]

Five men attacking a fellow breaking his ribs
Till they're sticking into his heart blood is flowing out of his mouth
They're sticking knives into his lifeless body
Punching the dead one to be the hard ones

The people are standing at the side
Like there is nothing to hide

Fear
Ignorance
No reaction

He is dragging a young girl
Into his car
Driving so fast
Driving so far

Out in the forest he is raping her helpless body
Taking this girl to the point she never again will be

She never again will forget this moment as her life got so fucking deep
Never again forget the pain
Never again will see the light
