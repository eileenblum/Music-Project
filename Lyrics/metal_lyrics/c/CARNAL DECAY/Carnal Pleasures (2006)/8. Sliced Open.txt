A sharp ripping knife in the hand of fate 
The cold steel approaches to me
I feel the gush of warm blood
Flowing down on me

I feel no pain just the frozen spider
Running so fastly down my back 
My blood begins to freeze in my veins
My head begins to burn

Gore on my whole body 
Ridden I'm laying down
Soaked is the bottom
Of my blood that's cooling down

Now fear and torment
Grow up inside
And I begin the resignation of my thoughts
Sliced open I'm laying down
My body begins to rot
