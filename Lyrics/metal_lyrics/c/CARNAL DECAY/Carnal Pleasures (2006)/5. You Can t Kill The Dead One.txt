I am the ghost that enflames your thoughts
Don't try to kill me cause I am dead

I'm torturing your brain sending you my nightmares
Show you a world you never want to see
This is the hell on Earth coming from your brain
Just crush your head and you'll be free

With your eyes spread wide open you see me gnawing on your own
Destituted you're crying your only wish is to die

Open my grave and lacerate my corpse
Kick my bones and break my skull
I'm watching you smiling like a frenzied

I was the sacrifice to your god now I'm back
Showing you the depths of a dead world and now dream on
