You're looking so fucking happy
I'm disgusted of your smile
The anger rises up in me
The ravishment of devastation obsesses me

Bond on a chair with straddled fucking legs
The chopped off in our sewed up mouth
Tearstained eyes beg for sudden death

I like the look of agony in your face

Days go by the room is filled with your rotting stench
Your face looks (like a putrid potato)
My gorge rises (I spew it into your face)

Putrid potato with a dip on it
Let me try a little ah what a great taste
A little salty in the end

I know what it needs just a little sugar
Now let me try again ah you're better
I think now you are finished

Now I need an oven I don't like cold flesh
Got to bake a dirty crippled motherfucker to enjoy the full flavor
Of your putrid fucked up happy dip potato face

Now you taste like fish and smell like the rotten abscess of a putrid cow
Disgorging your flesh brings your smile on my face
Now I've got the reign over your inner self

I've got a weakness for putrid
Baked happy dip potato faces
