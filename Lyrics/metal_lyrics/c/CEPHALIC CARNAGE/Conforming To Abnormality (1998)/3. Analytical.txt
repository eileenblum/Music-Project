This is the end you've gone too far talking shit incision emotional scars,
You'll rot away, ulcers bleed today,
Bleeding profusely, yet you refuse to quit,
Grab a bottle of gin and take a healthy swig,
I've tried to help you, yet you refuse me, because I smoke pot,
You've never seen me in a drunken stupor,
For years I've watched you be a pathetic fool,
People have robbed you.
Not any more I'm leaving home, sordid man you will die alone.
Analytical your words they echo in my head,
I'll miss you more when you are dead, for all the hateful things you said, analytical!
You could never hold a job, ever since the death of mom, but I tried to help you,
The years of drinking own your soul, you're addicted now, it's beyond your control,
I hate you and wish I were never born, zombified there is no hope,
Paralyzed succumb to the pain in you, father you will writhe in pain,
Ostracized renounce thy family name, sad as it is I wish the best for you,
I smoke weed to keep from killing you... you must let go of the past,
Mom is dead and never coming back, 16 years of verbal abuse,
I was forced to live my life with a chronic alcoholic,
Success was my only goal, all the times I was told I was a worthless piece of shit,
You were never there for me, I supported myself without your help,
Because I can't stand you, you are stupid, going senile xerosis infected.
The cycle of this disease has been broken by me, die die die.
