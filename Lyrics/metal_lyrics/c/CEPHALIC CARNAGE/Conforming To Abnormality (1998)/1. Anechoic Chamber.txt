This world is perilous,
Destroying all we create,
Bury our dead to have condos built on gravesites,
We decimate our old so we don't have to pay social security,
And they pollute our air so we don't want to breathe,
And contaminate our water so the children will have nothing to drink,
Kill all we can so we can eat now.
Anechoic chamber is asteroid damaged earth!
