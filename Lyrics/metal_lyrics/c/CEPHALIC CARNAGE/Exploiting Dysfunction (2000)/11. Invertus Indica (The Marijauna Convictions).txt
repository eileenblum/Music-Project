I wish that I could smoke
The weed at the turning of the century
From what I have read, In early 19OO's
Immigrants would smoke,
then go habitually insane
Resort to a life of crime or violent rapes
Assaulting police officers, in bordertowns
Extreme prejudism
from this rising plague
Infecting our youth,
Change will commend
Arrests were made,
weed is slowly criminalized
State by state officials were terrified
Mostly minorities that smoked
Jazz musicians were being watched
Under section 2F...
Possession without a prescription
was made presumptive
evidence of concealment
Drugs illegally imported
in violation of this act
And made possession a federal crime
Esta ya ledio las tres, exhilarating effects
Three inhalations of marijuana.
The first puff
induced feelings of well being,
The second provoked extreme elation,
coupled with activity
The third was reputed
to make the smoker oblivious to danger
Developing superhuman strength
El Paso in 1914 characterized
a hot bed for marijuana fiends
Reportedly common
not only among Mexicans,
but among Blacks, Prostitutes, Pimps,
and criminal class of Whites,
Meanwhile alcohol prohibition
was a losing cause
Government paranoia was soon abound
Mafia propaganda was gaining ground
Through violence and bribery...
alcohol could be found
By 1921 an increase of marijuana
was noted Cannabis Indica,
which is Indian Hemp
From Hashish to Opium raise new fears
Cocaine in further demand
on July 15, 193O Harry Jacob Anslinger
was appointed Acting Commisioner
of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
Eager to fulfill his role as an evil crusader
Against the evils of narcotics
The influential of public policy
toward drugs from 193O-1968
Employ every tactic possible
to convince legislation
Marijuana is a national monster
Boys smoke it with girls to seduce them
Still heroin use is rising higher
Public oppositions had very little say
I'm living here in 2OOO
and I have never smoked weed
That made me want to kill
or become hostile
All these crimes
must have been committed
under the influence of alcohol
Smoking pot gets you stoned
You get mellow,
so fuck the bullshit from the past
It is time to grow up
Out of religious pesting
or goody-two-shoe politicians
or lobbyist, addicted to tobacco,
whores, and social drinks
Now's the time for us stoners to revolt
take back a country
we lost a long time ago
Change the laws more suitable for
man... Invertus Indica
