Septicemia, Yersinia Pestis
Delusional Hyponatremia
H2O poisoning without knowing
Tap water infects my throat
Nausea, retching,
pallor bowel movements
Epigastric discomfort
Consume water from the sink
Trying to rehydrate myself
Virulent liquid maggots produce
Rapid progressive condition
Instant depletion of body fluids
Electrolyte balance precarious
Secretion of intestinal polypeptide
Dilation of blood vessels
Asiatic cholera secreting fluid and salt
In the intestinal tract, viremia, vipoma,
Water born epidemic
Confusion in thought
Intestinal rot, Bacterial Fate
Trying to rehydrate
Leading to hypovolemia...
chronic renal dysfunction
Massive loss of potassium,
ion (K) from diarrhea and vomiting,
Reaching for the stash tray
Load a bowl... fire it up
Trying to control nausea
Internal anal hemorrhaging,
bleeding sphincter
and constantly wiping,
Lying in pain slowly dying
Wandering in disbelief
Yearning at the terror inside me
Cramping in unbearable I want to cry
Somehow this has to end
Same bacteria eats my friends
Drink Pepto-Bismal to remiss
Smoke a joint to progress
Pale and pink... acid vomit sprays
Dizziness erupts... I slip away
Immune system starts to fade
A fight with time
Antibiotics will save my life
Cryptosporidium killing inside
Burning and churning, intestines writhe
I am still breathing, but barely alive
Parasites dying, I come back to life
Cheating death, smoke another bowl
Regaining hope, bless my soul
The body is gaining strength
No more bloody stool, I hit the bong
Eating to constipate
Hoping I won't defecate
Water epidemic deploys town
A defective filter is what was found
At the water treatment plant,
Intake/Outtake valves
Were somehow crossed,
sending untreated sewage
Into the home, community infected...
Cryptosporidium infecting my body,
Living to tell the this purulent story
Smoking some kind and feeling alive
