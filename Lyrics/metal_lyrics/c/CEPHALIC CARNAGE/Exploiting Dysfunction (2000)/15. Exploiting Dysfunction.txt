Before the tornadoes came,
the sun never shined the same
Rabbit freak on a bridge,
pissing on cars driving below
Cat hunters ride, drowning cats
to be brokered for a dollar a pound
We need milkshakes and glue
Sisters play with their tits
innocently yet seductively
Brothers wrestle out debates
Incestuous story a lttle girl tells
about her dirty dad
Small town teens born into hate
the cycle grown,
some will not escape
Sniffing glue reveals his brother's queer
Little kids with vulgar mouths
attack the rabbit
Rob nothing,
this city has a high disable rate...
A.D.D. Ritalin boy, black midget liaison
with a distraught
Abused as a kid, manic depressive
in dire need for love
Stumble onto a fellow cat killer,
ask his whole life story,
Break into his house
and euthanate this dormant lady
There's a guy
who pimps his retarded sister
Such a normality
People with atrial septal
defect coarctation of the aorta,
tetraloy or fallot
Despondent man,
gossiper tries to feel up
the impending sisters
Older inbreds party,
wrecking up a house,
crushing the table and chair
like wild vultures
Living in a house with a mother
who never cleans...
Boxes, clothes, trash piled everywhere,
piled everywhere, piled everywhere,
Exploiting Dysfunction...
Soaking in a tub of green water
Mother brings to him a plate of spaghetti,
plate with ketchup,
chocolate bars falls in the water
Pick it up and eat it
Before the tornadoes came
our splendid town was never changed
From a movie that I was,
it was disturbing
Big wigs exploiting dysfunction
of the worlds' freaks- Jim Rose,
State Fair obscurities, conjoined twins,
congenital amputee,
born a side show attraction...
Exploiting Dysfunction
Kill the chair,
nobody smokes in the water
Must be the water
pretty much like the cities I've seen...
Dysfunction is a way of life
Like the side show freak glamorized.
