Driving down the freeway
About to smoke
A tulip of fresh pseudo nugs
Reaching for the lighter
My taste buds are enticed
I'm feeling high
Listening to Fleshgrind
Watching the idiot in front of me
Veer to the left, accelerate
Speed traps radars me,
Police lights flash
Oh shit... they are pulling me over
Runs to the car, smells the reefer
Pull me out throws me to the ground
In his panic, feeds me to his dog
Road is hot burning flesh
While back-ups destroy the car
All for a little bid of weed
Dog bite my arm,
treat me as a murderer
Please let me up
the handcuffs are too tight
I'm begging you please this is not right
These hicks fucking laugh at me
You bled to much, you're under arrest
for what your done with no contest...
Cannibal cop
You bastards will pay when I sue you
For the tremendous brutality
for smoking weed
While most people receive citations
You punched me in the head,
kicked me to the floor,
Blackened my eye,
bloodied up the nose,
for ingesting danga, and broke my arm
Said I resisted arrest
Nazi pig blessed man gay as hell
Prejudice too
Taking out frustration
or raping unsuspecting men
You bite their cocks
Glad none of that happened to me
Medical attention is at hand
Still I'm chained to this hospital bed
Then you'll laugh as if this were a joke
Throw me in a cell
with bloodied up clothes
You punched me in the head,
beat me in the ribs,
Kicked me in the nose
'cause I'm not gay
Nazi pig blessed hag, you'll be shot
by Christ-fearing men...
Eradicate Authority
Cops beat nimble,
Cops beat quick,
Crushing human faces with a nightstick
If people like this
are sent to patrol the meek
Harrassing civilians,
terrorizing the streets
Only smoked a joint,
look at what they did to me
Beaten to a pulp
Your honor hear my plea,
What I speak is the truth
Only smoked a joint
Honesty of my youth
And you'll treat me like shit
The justice system is a commodity
designed to make money.
