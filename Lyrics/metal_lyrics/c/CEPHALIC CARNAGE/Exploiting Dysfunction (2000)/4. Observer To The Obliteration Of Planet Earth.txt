Aliens hover in space
Observing the human race
Studying who to abduct
Past abductees will be sought
And now about me
I'm a serial killer
Demon of the earth
Should have been killed
through aborted birth
Molesting pubescence
I'm lower than the dirt
Masturbating constantly
I love the smell of death
We are forced to believe
Walking down the street
Impulse to kill
I levitate into a blinding beam of light
Something trying to control my thought
Like when I was young
But the mind won't let it
It's developed immunity
I've got a chemical imbalance
No pineal gland
Therefore no telepathic capabilities
Fiber-Optic wires try to bind me...
Revenge
Attack of the greys
I must defend
Raped by technology when I was a kid
Taking a laser scalpel
I start to dissect
Fucking the pus wound
Growing erect
With surgical precision
The esophagus is slit, coitus inside
just like a clit
They need me to impregnate
For them to survive
In return they'll save our planet
from anthracite
Mass murderer that consumes me
Compelled to destroy
Mutilating lizard like intelligence
Because I have no pineal gland
With no telepathic capabilities
I cannot fly this craft
Succeed in becoming a god
I'm forced to watch the obliteration
of the planet earth
Down below there is war and hate
Bombs they fly, millions die,
our world is not at ease
Nuclear force, famine spreads
brings you to your knees
A planet in flames
War-torn minds, Oxygen depletes
Panic amongst the humans
Few will remain
Tsunami waves erode the land
Earthquakes crack and spline
War mongers have killed us all
The moon will never shine
We are forced to live underground
The sun it grows so hot
Festering boils upon the flesh
Bodies start to rot
The air we breathe is second hand
from melting ice caps
Fetal wart fungus
I'm a serial killer
Destroyer of the earth
Slashing aliens
Meant to save the world
Decompose slowly, corroding
Rotting here in sperm
Jonesing for weed... How long has it been?
