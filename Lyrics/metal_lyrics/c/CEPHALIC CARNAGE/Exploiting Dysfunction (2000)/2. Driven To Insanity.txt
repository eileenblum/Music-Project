It's sad when kids take their lives
In the act, kill 13 peers
What drives a mind to kill?
Must have been really catastrophic
To hate violently stockpile guns
Inflictin' revenge gruesomely
that oblivious day,
who would foresee media spectacle,
Enshroud in tragedy
Victims will beg and plead
Nation in shock, copy-cat's mock
Upscaled high school...
Killing of the rich
can happen anywhere...
Even in your neighborhood
Children are snapping...
Peach thru annihilation
It kind of sucks... Innocent people died
What made this happen...
Condolence to the bereaved
Deranged adolescents...
Or victims as well
Society could learn from this
Listen to your kids
Two die brains go splat
