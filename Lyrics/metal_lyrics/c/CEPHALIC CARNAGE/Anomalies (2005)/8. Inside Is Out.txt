Chasing lies
That which hurts most
Believing
Leave it

When it comes
Let go of fear
Take it

As I said
You will like it
Being here
Burning

The dust we become coats the dust we come from

Digging deep, frozen grave, through cold veins, and to feel, cold blood race, proof of
Emptiness, and when it's done, dust we become coats the dust we come from

Fingers pierce - my soul is pulled - from my body - is cast down - from heaven comes exile

Left behind
Wanting to breath
Start the fires
That boil the seas
Beg for nothing
On broken knees
Ultima bless me so

Yet, you watched her escape, your grasp, you've slipped

Bless me so
I won't fall through
To come hear again

In your grief
Find your new place
Now repent
Then go drifting
Into the dark
To find no light
To search forever

Start the fires
That boil the seas
Beg for nothing on broken knees
