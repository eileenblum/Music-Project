Do what you wilt, yes I am the way, trust in me and I'll heal your pain.
Religious anomaly, salvation is hate,
Yet people die every day, religious conflicts for their right to pray, going to their grave, dead from their faith,
Kicking people is bad; people should never do it.
The ignorant man they envoy, promising eternal life.
Wise men have the answers to the afterlife, heaven, hell, or a planet in the sky, in the ground to rot in a box, where do we go when we die.
They think the sun is our god, without it, we could not survive.
Pious souls, rectify our differences, years of unrest, the gods are depressed.
Why pretend these wars will ever end, religious disease, a never ending trend,
Religious anomaly salvation is hate.
Kicking people is bad people should never do it. The will or the way.
