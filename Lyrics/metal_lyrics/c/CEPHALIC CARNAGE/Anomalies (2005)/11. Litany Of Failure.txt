Why do you believe, one man can police everything?
Should I be forced to be believe what you say?
Your theoretic views really make me ill;
Let me welcome you to the 1 world corporate states,
They first bring democracy, using atomic force,
Subvert a whole country,
Tyrannical raiding are enforced.
Kill it's infrastructure, siege and prevail, exhort theocracy,
If Jesus Christ, came back to life, you would have him re-crucified,
The soldiers lives you sacrificed, our economy that you've paralyzed
It's your litany of failure.
