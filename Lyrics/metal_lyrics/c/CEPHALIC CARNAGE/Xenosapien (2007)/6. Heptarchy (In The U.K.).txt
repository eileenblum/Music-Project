Some of those, are put here to wake us from our sleepiness
And open our minds, gives us hope, inspires to make our dreams come true
Give reason for the voices to be heard, as we pay homage to the fallen warriors
Who have sacrificed themselves, plagued us with their thought
To the imperial monarchy, we hail the UK
The mighty heptarchy of the modern age, forged in steel from, a clan of the elite
Triumphant in the battle, on victorious Sabbath, a priest led the way
Honor of thy maiden, the enemy was vanquished to Babylon
Poisoned by the venom, consumed by the mass
A Saxon rose above, to heed the call of the kings
Spread the loyal words, disciples of the Anglo-land
Sounding out their charge, together we slayed the opposers
Tigers and ravens by our side, napalm in the night, like a UFO in the sky
