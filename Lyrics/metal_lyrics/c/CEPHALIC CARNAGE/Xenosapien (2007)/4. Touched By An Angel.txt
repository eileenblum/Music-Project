The church is all powerful, they influence the entire world
Amass great wealth, the pope is like the president
The bible is a book of rules, explaining how to live
The trails of those before, beliefs for you explore
Priests read scripts of faith, take a vow of celibacy
To be pure and of god, not to bring pain on man
For centuries imposing their will, molesting the youth of the world
Exempt from the law, papal supreme, scarring their minds
Cure you of sin, destroy you from within, tormenting thy dreams
Touched by an angel, blessed by the hand of god
Victims of clerical abuse, live in fear
They can't escape
The rage inside, it just burns in their minds
Pontiffs disregard the allegations, settlements are paid
He's sent to a new congregation, to spread his morbid plague
The cycle is repeated silence is their way, of dealing with it
Another kid gets touched, pedophile is made
For centuries imposing their will, molesting the youth of the world
Exempt from the law, papal supreme, scarring their minds
Cure you of sin, destroy you from within, tormenting thy dreams
Touched by an angel, blessed by the hand of god
A priest should be allowed to marry a bride
Procreate with her, and to bare the gift of life
Instead they swore the oath, to recite holy words
For his mass, not to cast shame upon his loyal flock
Someday this will be the downfall of the church
When faith has died, who will you preach to now?
