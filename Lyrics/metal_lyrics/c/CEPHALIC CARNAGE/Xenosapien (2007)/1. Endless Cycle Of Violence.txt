A child's mind is easily inspired, violence fuels the fire
Video games and chaotic scenes, are what they see, act out violently
Absorbing what they view, repeating words we say
In a culture of profanity, ignorance starts at a young age
Throughout history, bloodshed would always be
No way to stop the conflicts fought, we have destructive genes
Entrenched in our anatomy, from genetically enhanced apes
Planted by beings from space, a loathing hate we can't delete
In this endless cycle of violence, we can't escape
From the big bang to street gangs, we live it everyday
When this endless cycle of violence, reinvigorates
Give us our lives, give us strength
TV shows the mind to kill, images of murder every night
Triggers their brains, to be adult like in every way
A baby sitter for lazy parents, we can't control it
The corporate sponsors, flood them with gluttons
Absorbing what they view, repeating words we say
In a culture of profanity, ignorance starts at a young age
Throughout history, bloodshed would always be
No way to stop the conflicts fought
We have destructive genes
In this endless cycle of violence, we can't escape
From the big bang to street gangs, we live it everyday
When this endless cycle of violence, invigorates
Give us our lives, give us strength
