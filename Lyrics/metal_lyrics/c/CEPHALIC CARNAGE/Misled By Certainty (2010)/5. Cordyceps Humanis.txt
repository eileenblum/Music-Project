Cordyceps Humanis
Like something out of science fiction
We've grown too far over population
Nature has this way of thinning us out
Fungi spores mutated from ants
Enters the human host's respiratory system
Slowly invading soft tissue
Manipulating thought process
Eating skin and flesh going insane
A self induced cannibal
Is what we've become
Clinging to the trees and skyscrapers
Where we soon shall spore
A cordyceps of malady
Autosarcophagic human
Soon to infest the species
Stroma protrudes the skull
Cranial growth conjoins
Only our mushroomed, half-eaten
Deranged skeletal vestiges will be seen
Reduced to reproductive structures
Of the Body Snatchers
