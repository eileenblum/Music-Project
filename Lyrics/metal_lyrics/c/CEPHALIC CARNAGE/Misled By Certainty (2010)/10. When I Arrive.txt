After my crucifixion and resurrection
I find salvation through tribulation
These words I leave unto thee
Praising only me
To fulfill your prophecy
Dying for destiny
Those who swear their lives of faith
Don't live by the commands
Carved in stone
With no way to atone
You claim I am your deity
When I arrive will you remember me?
And the conquering that will be
Use my name in vein
The trillions who were slain
Carved in stone
With no way to atone
These wars i would never condone
After my crucifixion and resurrection
I find salvation through tribulation
These words I leave unto thee
Praising only me
To fulfill your prophecy
Dying for destiny
I will not bear this shame
Rapture is far from where you are
When I arrive will you remember me?
Will I appear the way I'm supposed to be?
Praying with the locust by my side
When I arrive and I am re-crucified
When I arrive will you remember me?
Will I appear the way I'm supposed to be?
Praying with the locust beside me
When I arrive will you remember me?
