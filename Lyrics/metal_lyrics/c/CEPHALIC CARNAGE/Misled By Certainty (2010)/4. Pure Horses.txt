Life filters through like shutters
Frame by floating frame
As Satan's blood burns in the stomach
With corroded noses
Hovering above a porcelain god
Vomit projecting
Cleansing inside
Purging the shit out
From the heart
Strong enough for a horse
Insufflated en masse
They're pounding on the door
I'm puking straight through death
Pure horses in it?
