A deep slow inhale
The smoldering orange crystals
A singeing cloud of milky omnipotence
The smell of souls
Unveiling phosphorescent architecture
The disintegration of earthly perception
A regrettable selection of symphonic dissonance
A bleak portrait consuming and malignant
The mind recoils in horror
Paralyzing the nervous system
An un-refusable invitation to an alien hell
The wrath of the spirit molecule
Interweaving shadows, circling an exposed mind
Witches from another realm, prodding through the withered rind
Dismal array of sorrow. seeping in the bones
Vortices insufflate, spiraling plight
There's no way around fear
Accept this fate
There's no escape
Pain radiates
Mental rage
There's no way to prepare
Shadow beings hovering, conquering, inoculating
Examining the inner workings of human tendencies and intrinsic greed
Harboring a dark and vicious creed
Inside the sleeve ugly, corroded, weak
Amaurotic Sheep
Initiating. Humiliating. Intimidating. Ostracizing. Chastised
Infiltrating. Castigating. Penetrating. Reprimanding. Scarified
Hallucinational vacationing
To escape finite gaian reality
Emanating from the spiteful sentients
A roiling bath of harsh enlightenment
Apeirophobic restoration
Of the humbled and bewildered
The infinite circling inquisition
A hallow-graphic paradigm defiles
Discombobulated perception
The disarray of terra incognito
