"C'thulu R'lyeh Fhtagn"
Seismic thrust perturbs dreams of psychically hypersensitive eccentrics
Voodoo swamp priests, Eskimo Satanists
Lured to the abyss, walking reverie
To an elder realm, morbid insanity
Orgy and sacrifice, reciting sacrament
C'thulu, i summon thee
Abraxas of Filth
O Guardian of Hell
Rise to me
Acropolis of Slime
Stench from a 1000 graves
Distorted miasma obscures
Flaps membranous wings
Eldritch contradictions of
Celestial order unleashed
Father of the night
Born before time
C'thulu, i summon thee
Abraxas of Filth
O Guardian of Hell
Rise to me
Acropolis of Slime
Cyclopean nightmare ascends
Gravitating to the stars
Earth's utmost terror
Lunacy falls around
Titan oozing structures
Krypton hieroglyphs
Tonight you live
Azoic one
