There once was a place, far beyond the sky
A world of debauchery and habitual plight
The Chosen One peering up at the sky
Compass in hand, as the tents are raised
Archaic gods are praised
Goats heads in the stars, ov crimson storms
Reveals prophesied visions of twinge cruel incision
Fast asleep, the guards lie bereaved
Malnourished and diseased
Kill the lambs so we can feast
From the blood comes to life
Inhale the sulphuric blast
Of assassination from the past
Return to Neo Golgatha
War erupts, the vestal is found
Aroused by the light
The orb is in sight
Thrusting fourth into the womb
Lust will secrete
Procreation is now complete
Impregnated host
Incubation of the new Messiah
Engaging revelation
Futuristic executioners want to see him dead
Religion is a cancer that must be removed
They journey back in time
To destroy the orb
Rape the virgin's mind
Seeding imminent verve
Of this extinct future race
In their symbiotic Eden
Raped by an orb
