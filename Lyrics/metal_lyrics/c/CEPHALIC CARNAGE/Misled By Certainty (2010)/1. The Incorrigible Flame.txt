Have you ever had a strange revelation
Or a cryptic premonition
Something you can't describe
A fright that lingers inside
Sends chills up the spine
Reeks chaos on the mind
Paranormal, supernatural, or divine
Staring into the mirror
Red eyes glaring back
If your saw your own death
Would you tell your friends
Visit them in dreams
In the timeless space
Of the oneironauts
Adrift from the limitless light
In the here-before, and here-after
Ethereal being insight
Eternal and omniscient
In an ever-changing expanse
Unable to wake up
Horripilations confirm
I know I've been here before
Living in a simulated reality
My private twilight zone
Venturing in the unknown
Dead sherpas guide the way
Through a glitch in time and space
Dimension bizarre
Shaman's songs call your name
To lightless holograms of black
Staring into the mirror
Red eyes glaring back
Eternal and omniscient
In an ever exchanging expanse
The incorrigible flame smolders
the cephalic shrinks
You can barely see
The imagination burns bright
Feeding into the sight
Unable to wake up
Horripilations confirm
I know I've been here before
Living in simulated reality
My private twilight zone
Venturing in the unknown
