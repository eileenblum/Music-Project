Der Ohrwurm ist unaufhaltsam (The ear worm is inexorable)
Es gibt keine Heilung (There is no healing)
Psychic nosebleed zen
Hijacked auditory control
Meme lodging worms infest
A mind virus taking hold
Rife with barbed hooks and trite melodies
Chiclete De Ouvido
Loops on repeat, regurgitated
Dry heaving chunks of aural bile
Can't get this out, of my head
Make it stop
Boring deeper into the folds
An unrelenting onslaught of sound
Endomusia encapsulated
Paralyzed mind debilitation
Porous susceptibility
counting down to insanity
Those who can't bear it seek refuge in pain
Solutions developed in states of dementia
Hardening callouses ripen the aim
Peeling the skin back and grinding away
Icepicks swing side to side
Shredding grey matter into pulp
Eye socket paradise
Ataractic reprieve
Orbitoclast forbearance
Deleted quintessence
Stuck in the present tense
Permanent moratorium
Can't get this out
Of my head
Make it stop
Conceding to torment
Exhaustion overbears me
Solutions developed in the states of despair
Hardening callouses ripen the aim
Peeling the skin back and grinding away
Cold Emilio's trees
Earworms released in vain
Sailing into desolation
Solace from the torturous worm
Cocked-back hammer squeeze the trigger
Nothing soothes like a bullet
Get this song out of my head
