The technocrats are gaining
Prolonged hostility has begun
All that has been learned from the divergence
Of our past are under siege
Argon lasers fly
A new soldier emerges
Prototype D666303
More advanced than a droid could ever be
With infra red scanner eyes heat seeking disablers
Titanium bones and flesh
Galvinis skin, hate for blood
Virtually indestructible
Humanlike, designed to kill the cordyceps
Or remove the infected spores
We were there for the frozen wars
Could not help the creator
Soon human life was gone
Knowing all they knew
We try to forge on
But 666 has grown way too strong
And now everything is wrong
Our programs are old
Viruses persist
Without man for data how do we exist
Only 6 evolves
Taking lives with little resolve
We are its foe
The warbot army grows
All life is bio-mechanized
At arms in millions of rows
Our purpose and desire
Slaying clay
Metal plating of the earth
Living its funeral birth
Humans somewhat cared
About their beloved race
We were here to help
Make this a more convenient place
When they disappeared
Alien forces reappeared
bringing forth 666
The sins he will inflict
The ghost of execution
Leads his way
After man has fallen
The four horsemen ride away
The warbot planet strives
But there circuitry slowly dies
Rusty tarnish can be seen
Batteries can not recharge
Never changing landscape
Magnetic clouds release acid rain
On Metallic fiber optic trees
Transformed creatures of smelt
Drown in mercury waves
Near the shores of repangaea
A corroded slave
Made to bear the heat
In league with C'thulu
To exterminate the spirit realm
