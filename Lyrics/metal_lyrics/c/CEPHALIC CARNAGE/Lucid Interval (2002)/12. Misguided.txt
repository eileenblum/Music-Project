Only child, with an imaginary friend, always lonely
Sheltered and frail, emotionally ill.
Mother will smother you, father left because of who?
Somehow you are to blame
An outsider looking in! Overly loved, verbally abused
Never wants to go home!

Now you live in your head! Your own reality
Everyone else is dead!
Lack the skills to communicate, no friends
Bullies, abuse, suicidal, gravely depressed

Never can do wrong in the eyes of mom.
Severely misguided, my life is a lie, no tears left, now I'll die!
