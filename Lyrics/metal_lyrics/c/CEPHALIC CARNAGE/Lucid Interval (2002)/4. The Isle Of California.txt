Furious winds, sky grows black
Circum polar vortex, weather changing patterns
Causing solar storms

Living on the San Andreas fault line
I feel the earth shake, ground splits open wide!

Massive tidal waves, seaports flood
Power lines fall, bridges rip apart.

Cars drop into the sea, crimson stench rises up
Observing the light, gas lines burst out in flames.

Water starts gushing everywhere, sharks wait to claim their prey
No one will survive on this day, the west coast slips into the sea
The worst quake in world history.
