Growing up a lonely kid Blaine had an infatuation with fire
Stealing lighters, matches, whatever he could get
Pyromaniacal son of an architect, working hard
Pioneering buildings that would not burn
Gained praise from his colleagues
Never anytime for a wife and son.

This would make Blaine mad
The ill neglect from his mom and dad
Infuriates him to see blood red
The only relief from the pain.

Ignite up the night sky
Tears inside, pain subsides
Watch the structure fall, immolate us all
His destructive hate, burnt the whole block down.

And it felt so good, gotta get away
Before I get caught
Worst case of arson the city ever saw
Policeman arrives so many casualties
All my family died!

Incinerating my house and everything inside
Paramedics could not save their lives
Fire struck while everyone was sleeping
Heaps of seared flesh, I was I were dreaming
I burned my pain away

Now that Blaine has grown, living on his own
High school graduate, valedictorian
Becomes a fire man, to cleanse his soul.

But the arsonist in his mind is still alive, urging him on!

Starting fires again building structures descend
And saving lives how I have to pretend
I am a humanitarian
Hypocrite that I am
&gt;From my father I inherited the gift to invent time-ignited fires
At buildings of my choice
Then I sit back and wait, for the emergency call from 911
Sirens sound, burning down the hospital and stadium,
Both at the same time.

Arriving at the catastrophe, I see victims around me baked
Many souls have I taken away.
I work franticly to douse the flames, moving diligent
I start to cry, hundreds wounded!
