Flying high on a hit of crack, need to find some speed
Hit the liquor store, the companionship of a whore
Drunk and driving stoned and frying
Severely impaired to see group of pedestrians in front of me
The music is loud, laughing at the church I make an evil smirk
All of a sudden the car goes crash.

My mind goes black, smashing into a crowd
Standing on the corner, waiting to cross the street
Ice causes a man to slip, head goes under the tire
Brain death, life for him has expired!
