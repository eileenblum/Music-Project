I sit alone in this room
These walls stained with blood
The walls are crying and it's starting to get to me
I'm ticking like a bomb

My mind is failing
My sight is failing
My lungs are failing
My body is failing

With these broken legs I'll stand up and fight
Buried deep, a victim of my own mind
It's only a matter of time
I know that I'll be just fine

I'm fighting to save myself
I try to climb my way out
Of this abyss that I've let myself become
It's getting harder for me to breathe
I don't know if I continue to live
If I can learn from my mistakes
When will I be able to live?
I can't believe that I can be saved
Where is the person I used to be?

My mind is failing
My sight is failing
My lungs are failing

With these broken legs I'll stand up and fight
Buried deep, a victim of my own mind
It's only a matter of time
I know that I'll be just fine

Inside out and upside down
A million times I do this to myself
But I, I know this is a test of my will
I'm not letting it go until I'm okay with myself
I'm not okay with myself

With these broken legs I'll stand up and fight
Buried deep, a victim of my own mind
It's only a matter of time
I know that I'll be just fine

I'm fighting to save myself
I try to climb my way out
Of this abyss that I've let myself become
I'm not giving up
