This is when it ends

This is not the natural
Oh I can't believe what I have seen
Oh this cannot, it cannot, it cannot be real
For the waters are coming into my soul
These waters fill my weakened soul
But these demons will not drag me down to hell
They won't drag me down to hell

And all the worlds collide as it ends tonight
And all these memories slowly drift away
I'm feeling colder now as the sun burns out
And ash falls from the sky, the air's no longer mine
As it ends tonight

Come save me, oh god
The Earth is blackening
The water turns to blood
The beast is roaming and claiming
While we are down on our knees
The sirens sing their songs
While the wicked souls are standing
Right where they belong

Well each breath could be my last
So I intend to use it wisely

And all the worlds collide as it ends tonight
And all these memories slowly drift away
I'm feeling colder now as the sun burns out
And ash falls from the sky, the air's no longer mine
As it ends tonight [3x]
And all the worlds collide [4x]
As it ends tonight [2x]
And all these memories slowly drift away
I'm feeling colder now as the sun burns out
And ash falls from the sky, the air's no longer mine
As it ends tonight
