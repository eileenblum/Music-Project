So this is where they left us
With nothing but a pale and a pile of dust
We have come too far
To sit and watch them tear this world apart
I think it's time we start drawing a line
We start making a change instead of wasting our time
Don't you see this is life here?
Don't you see this is a world worth fighting for?

But it's not too late, for we
For we can make a change

We will not be victims of circumstance
If this is our only chance, then we'll take what's ours
We will be more than the lost souls, a future without hope
We are the light of the world

We are the hope
For our generation
We are the hope
For the world we live in
This is the way that we fix the problem
We are the ones who control the outcome

Fight the ones who built the walls
Change the world, this is my cause
I will fight this, I will fight this til my hands are bleeding
Fight the ones who built the walls
Change the world, this is my cause
I will fight this, I will fight this til my hands are bleeding

Cause we are not the lost souls
We have something to fight for

We will not be victims of circumstance
If this is our only chance, then we'll take what's ours
We will be more than the lost souls, a future without hope
We are the light of the world

We are strong enough to let our weakness show
We've come so far and now we're finally home

We will not be victims of circumstance
If this is our only chance, then we'll take what's ours
We will be more than the lost souls, a future without hope
We are the light of the world

We are the hope
We are the hope
We are the hope
We are the light of the world
