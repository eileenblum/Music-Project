Just like a thief in the night
You stole the crystal and gold, run, run
I always knew you were filth from the start
Soaked with the blood of an innocent soul
I swear Iâll find you, no matter how hard you hide, run, run
You condescending exaltation end here
A fall from a window will be a gift to the world

You think you can leave me, Iâll leave too
Youâll wish you were nothing when Iâm through
This pain that youâve left me is not how itâs ending
The end will be with you
When itâs over, said, and done
Once again will rise the sun
This pain that youâve left me is not how itâs ending
The end will be with you

Run, run and take your insolence with you
You took our pride and now weâre taking it back
Your filthy ways are finally bringing you down now
And now we have the upper hand
And already your kingdom is falling
You thought that we were undeserving of life
And now youâll be the one whoâs falling

You think you can leave me, Iâll leave too
Youâll wish you were nothing when Iâm through
This pain that youâve left me is not how itâs ending
The end will be with you
When itâs over, said, and done
Once again will rise the sun
This pain that youâve left me is not how itâs ending
The end will be with you

Your fall from a window will be a gift to the world
A fall from the window will be a gift to the world

When you take you final breath
And itâs lifted off my chest
Iâll stay a while just to admire
And when itâs over, said, and done
Once again will rise the sun
A brighter world, now that youâre gone
The end will be with you

You think you can leave me, Iâll leave too
Youâll wish you were nothing when Iâm through
This pain that youâve left me is not how itâs ending
The end will be with you
When itâs over, said, and done
Once again will rise the sun
This pain that youâve left me is not how itâs ending
The end will be with you.
