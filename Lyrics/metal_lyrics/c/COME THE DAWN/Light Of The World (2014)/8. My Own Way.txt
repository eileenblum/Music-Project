For the first time
I truly feel like Iâm living my life
For the first time
Something feels right
So let the record show that Iâll never give it up
To anyone, for anything
Itâs time to take what once was mine Iâm taking back my life

What if I jump and I donât fly?
Maybe Iâm chasing after a lie
But Iâll keep hoping for a victory this time
And everyone told me all along
That these dreams I had were wrong
But Iâll keep reaching for the stars until theyâre mine

Iâll keep reaching for the stars
Until theyâre mine, until theyâre ours
Iâll keep reaching for the stars

For the most part
Iâve been living my life too afraid to live at all
And Iâve been feeling like Iâm undeserving of everything I have
But I wonât give up
Because I need these words to mean something
To someone other than me

What if I jump and I donât fly?
Maybe Iâm chasing after a lie
But Iâll keep hoping for a victory this time
And everyone told me all along
That these dreams I had were wrong
But Iâll keep reaching for the stars until theyâre mine

And I will fly,
I will fly

What if I jump and I donât fly?
Maybe Iâm chasing after a lie
But Iâll keep hoping for a victory this time
And everyone told me all along
That these dreams I had were wrong
But Iâll keep reaching for the stars until theyâre mine

Iâll keep reaching for the stars
Until theyâre mine, until theyâre ours
Iâll keep reaching for the stars

I will never second guess myself again
I will try to find my own way
I was made for something more
Iâll never give up, Iâll never give in until I get it all
This is where my path begins
My path begins.
