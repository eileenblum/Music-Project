Incessantly you cut me down
You rip me up
From these roots that hold me down

Yo, let me take a little sec
I hope you're holding your breath
I'll tell you something that you'll never forget
So I'll put my flag in the sky
I put it up wave it high
Now you know what I'm not

Show me what you got!

So you think that you could cut me off?
After all I gave to get where I was

Look at what I've given up

I've found my way out of this open grave
You should've buried me when you had the chance
And now I'll show you that it's like to be cut down in your prime
Yeah, this time I'm not holding back

This is what it's like to be cut down in your prime
Like you were me
I always told you that this was what I'd do
And now your time has come for you

Because I've given up my whole life for this
I'll bury you six feet deep

I've found my way out of this open grave
You should've buried me when you had the chance
And now I'll show you that it's like to be cut down in your prime
Yeah, this time I'm not holding back

You must be in denial
There's nothing I won't do to reach the top again, again

I've heard that at the end of the day
There's only one thing to say
You still end up in my way
And I've earned my second chance at the top
So just as soon as it drops
Then that's the day it'll stop

If you thought this was the end of me
I hope you're holding your breath
You've chased the shadows of your past lives for far too long

I've found my way out of this open grave
You should've buried me when you had the chance
And now I'll show you that it's like to be cut down in your prime
Yeah, this time I'm not holding back
