Take a look at your life now
From another perspective
Why do you do all the things that you do?
Why do you say what you say?

I know you may feel your mistakes define you
But itâs a man that defines his mistakes
So stop letting yourself down and start picking yourself up
Youâll never find any pity from me

You know this life is only as hard as you want it to be
And I just thought that I would let you know
I thought I would let you know
Youâre not the only one that feels this way

Just know that youâre the only hope for yourself in the end

[2x]
I know all you really wanted was a second chance
For what itâs worth I hope you never thought of giving in

Never thought of giving in
