Wake up, wake up
Canât you hear them clawing at your mind?
Donât you know that theyâre the ones Who pray on those who are easy to fight?
And theyâre not gonna stop
So raise your voices with me
A voice alone is not enough
But all together weâre a force to be reckoned with
And you know itâs not over yet

Iâve been sitting too long while youâve been doing it wrong
And now itâs time for me to rise
I guess itâs time to be.... the monster that you have been making of me

Wake up, wake up
Itâs our time to take control
And itâs now or never
They wonât get the best of us
We will stand our ground and keep our heads held high
Brothers and sisters they will never take us alive

You are not wise to underestimate strength in numbers
Because I know there are a million ways for you to use our minds
But there is just one thing that you forgot
We are tired of playing your twisted games
Everything you say is always the same and weâre not gonna take it

Enough

When dictatorship is a fact,
revolution becomes our right I canât wait til the day we say
What a pleasure to burn down the industry

[3x]
Wake up, wake up
Itâs our time to take control
And itâs now or never
They wonât get the best of us
We will stand our ground and keep our heads held high
Brothers and sisters they will never take us alive
