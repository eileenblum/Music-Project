[feat. Caleb Shomo]I know your simple mind is struggling to get this
This world that I live in is a world you'll never see
I get the point that we were never intended
What part are you missing to get this closure?

We were just a dream, you never had me
We were just a dream, you never had me

It's never enough but it's never too late
And baby, honestly, honesty got us running back to where we began
And I'm chasing what matters most, and it's not you
We had the best of intentions
But we're moving in different directions
And I will find the truth without you

How many times will I continue to say
That you were just in the way, of something bigger than you and me?
It's becoming much harder for you to breathe
But nothing you say will get this closure

We were just a dream, you never had me
We were just a dream, you never had me

It's never enough but it's never too late
And baby, honestly, honesty got us running back to where we began
And I'm chasing what matters most, and it's not you
We had the best of intentions
But we're moving in different directions
And I will find the truth, and it's not you

Just close the door that I walked through
This is bigger than the both of us

It's never enough but it's never too late
And baby, honestly, honesty got us running back to where we began
And I'm chasing what matters most, and it's not you
We had the best of intentions
But we're moving in different directions
And I will find the truth, and it's not you

I will never let you bring me to my knees
This is the moment that I'll stand up and scream

This is my dream
