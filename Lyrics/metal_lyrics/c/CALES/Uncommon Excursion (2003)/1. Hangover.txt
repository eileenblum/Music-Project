Everything is broken
Chaos in my mind
Booze is a bitch
And my passion for life is dangerous
I have a feeling
That I do everything the other way round
The inner demon broke silence
And you broke into tears
If I push too much
I won't make any difference
Feelings of guilt ...
It seems so absurd and futile
I don't really know what else I should do
I better move on
Why can't things be as they used to be? 
Everyone is so grumpy tonight
Hey fucker, something's gonna happen tomorrow
And you may understand the meaning of your dull life
It's freezing cold outside
I'm staggering down the street
Beaten up and lonely
My will conforming to the instinct of war
And limbs want to destroy
Blackout caused by a fall
Broken face, body bruised
An emotional fit taking turns
With burst of laughter
I'd like to cry but I don't know how to
The only solution is sleep
Then I'll board up window
And be your cute li ttle boy
