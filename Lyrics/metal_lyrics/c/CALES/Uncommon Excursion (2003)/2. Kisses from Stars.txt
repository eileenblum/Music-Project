Welcome to my inner world, baby
I dont feel either pain or hate
I just dont know whether you can carry the weight of my fervour
On the whole Im happy and satisfied
Perhaps I just feel a little bitter aftertaste of my silliness
Which I have learnt to swallow like alcohol gained from oil
Forgive me I did not perceive you at the moment when kisses from star were coming and my
transcendental memory was ousting everything passing
I cannot explain why these abnormal states take such a long time
You should have kept your mouth shut and watch soap operas
Anyway, it suits you best when you are under, turning your cheek with mouth open
