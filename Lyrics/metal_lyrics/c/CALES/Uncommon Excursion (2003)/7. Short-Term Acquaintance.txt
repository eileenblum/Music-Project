Glorification of trash and megalomania
Talk shows and the world of color magazines
Distorted facts about the life of rich and famous
The subject of heated discussions
Among young ambitious girls
A display of disposable plastic beauty
Stupid trends of another season
The breadth of your views ends a few feet away
Your inner world is perfect mathematics
Your conduct is controled by money
You wont ever set your eyes on the skies in captivation
Because your eyes see just the emptiness
And the imagination woke you up
It's almost touching
Your ambitions and direction of your life in quotation marks
If you should spend a single
Day without your pseudoneeds
I guess they'd rush you to hospital
You're a great fuck but your company gets me tired
