Look how free I am
I won't let them catch me
All your banal worries are strange to me
All your petty interests seem so shallow
I don't understand why you'd waste words on this
Don't you know
That Im free from the problems
That plague you
Thats why I can't understand them
I had a feeling we had a lot in common
Now I'm coming to realize
How distant we were
And I'm not surprised at all
I wanted to offer you a sightseeing flight
Show you how to relish freedom
And give you a piece of my mind
Now I'm coming to realize
That you are stark blind
And your narrow-mindedness
Fills you with contentment
But I don't feel sorry for you at all
