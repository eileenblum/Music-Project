It's within reach
Just a few more steps and I'll be free as a bird
Everything's moving on the edge
It takes a little and hopes vanish away
Im at the threshold
Entering the paradise of my wishes
But does future hold for me
I'll just let it flow without worries
So much has changed, so many have left
Chained by the emptiness of everyday
Slaves to cozy homes
I'm still here and the flame of youth is burning
I'm not gonna devote my life to watching TV
To the rat race, feeding my family and humble obedience
I cant make peace with my failure like you, father
Everything I do guides me towards my freedom
Running a risk of drowning in feces
If it doesn't suit you baby, you better go
Pain does not last forever
Out of sight out of mind
