I'm the night you walk into
As if you were the full moon
You're the ray of hope cutting through
The crepulcular depths of my wild heart
You're the sunlit aurora
And I'm a snow-covered plain
You glide through like a ghost
I'm astonished by your limpid purity
The moment all creation became silent
To stare in amazement at the beauty
Without you I am a summer day without sunshine
My dreams merged with yours
My soul loomed from darkness
To bask in your radiance
A demon's dancing with an angel
The sea of time will thunder over
And there'll be nothing left
They'll keep walking along the path we trampled down
And we now know it leads nowhere
I've made my sacrifice to fulfil our life dream
Our pact will remain a secret
Just like your undisclosed past and origin
I'll take care of you and mold your character
To my liking and you will fill your mind
with reconcilliation after a long struggle
Then when my time comes
I'll walk into the bosom of your realm
To become part of the circle
A perfect harmony
