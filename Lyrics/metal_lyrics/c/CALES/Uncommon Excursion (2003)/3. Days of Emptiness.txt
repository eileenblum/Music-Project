Sore days of emptiness
There's no end to the winter
Twilight carries through
Despair reigns over your heart
You don't know where to start
Frustration eats deeps into you
Prospects of a better future are a cynical utopia
As if everything's been lost
Its just a question of time
You need to find inspiration
Look up and let it pass by
And don't forget that whenever you call me
I'm here for you my friend
There's so much ahead for both of us
There's so many beautiful girls out there
Waiting for you to make your wishes come true
Dont be a hick, turn that fucking tv off
Get out of your flea-bitten den
Change your shorts and let's go
We're gonna rock tonight
Oh, I almost forgot
I'm broke, could you front me?
