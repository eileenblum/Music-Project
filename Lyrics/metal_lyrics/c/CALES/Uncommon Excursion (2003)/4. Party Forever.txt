Our life is a neverending party
Disorderliness on the verge of crime
Gallons of booze
Throngs of cheap sluts
And hearbroken naive admirers
I'm hitting the rock bottom
And soaring into euphoric heights
It's better to die young than grow old
They want us to assume responsibility
For their own benefit
Yet they don't realize we don't need them
The wolf's loyalty cannot be turned into lamb's meekness
I am a bohemian and this is the fuckin path I've chosen
In the high sea of time I have sailed all the way here
And I will go on, further than you can imagine
Look, I do what I please
And I dont care what they think
They don't dare to do it cos they're not up to it
They would love to knock me down
Yet they cant defeat me
And they won't even succeed long after I die
I will always do what they expect least
Its like sifting grain from the chaff
Pigs don't know what pigsty is
Just like people don't know what life is
