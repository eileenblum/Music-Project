My life is a flight across the azure skies
I'm soaring in elation
And swooping into the blood-red sunset
Not to lose my strength
In the landscape of my Mind I roam
Throught the places of my dreams
In a vast stretch of perpetual inspiration
Without the chaos of our time or people like you
I spread my wings only when I want to
Im not delirious I just have slightly different views
No one speaks in vain here
No issues and no misunderstandings
Everything is clear, gracious
And surprising in its eternal beauty
