I'm watching your grudging look
With a dead pan expression on my face
And inside Im laughing
With the voice of the Devil
You're just another hypocrite
In this herd of lesser people
Indulging in perfidy
You life flows too unruffled for you to be different
You had everything you wanted
You have no idea how some things work
You've never taken anything in your own hands
Without the help of your wealthy parents
Just your double talk for playful girlies
Who spread their legs for anyone
Don't even think you can win me over like that
Your woman just won't stop following me around
But all she can do is suck my dick
You and the bunch of faggots dressed to kill
All the crap you pay so much attention to
Makes no sense to me
All the bullshit that comes out of mouth
I can't stand
I see what's inside your heads
And I'll get rid of your malicious thoughts
In no time with the deadly sound of my guitar
The only thing you can hear from me
Is one loud low pitched
