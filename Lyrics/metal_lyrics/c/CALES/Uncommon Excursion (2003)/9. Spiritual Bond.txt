You left so early
I feel bad about all the dirt
Hatred and disregard
But it cannot be redressed
So young and determined
I remember your talent and individuality
I looked up to you without you knowing that
You loved hemp so much
Your stuff was the best
We went separate ways
Our worlds were just one step away from our reunion
Its too late now, you're gone forever
And others want to profit from your death
You have won
And Im sure you feel good
I remember you
And I envy you sometimes
A piece of you is hidden within me
As if your spirit lived though me
