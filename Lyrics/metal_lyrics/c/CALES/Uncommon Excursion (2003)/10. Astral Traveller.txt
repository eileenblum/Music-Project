My time comes
When the night does
genius with his head in clouds
eccentric hunk
obscure weirdo
introverted visionary
Hemp's smouldering over the candle flame
Dark thoughts fill up the room
The bliss of the sensation
Fragments of time make up
A mosaic of the mystic beauty
Perpetuation of the splendid moment
I've mastered the tongue of the Earth
The metallic sound of the voice resounds into infinity
Seemingly insane
I'm just about to conclude my scientific research
Purification of the human spirit
Through prolonged seclusion
The state of mind opens the entrance gate
The time machine has been built
There's just a few tests ahead
Time travel almost drove me insane
If you don't tell anyone
We might set off on
An adventure into the unknown
