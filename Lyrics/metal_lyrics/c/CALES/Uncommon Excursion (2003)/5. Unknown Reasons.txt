Every sentence you say
And every desperate attempt
To draw attention hides a lie
Diseased, pathologically inflamed
Shaped by your sophisticated eloquence
You vehemently assert your devious views
Which reign over your smallness
A champion at mystification and treachery
I don't understand how you can still do this
To someone you call a loyal friend
Is it possible to listen to someone
Who hears no one but himself? 
Why compromise and trust someone
Who's betrayed you countless times
I'm not gonna watch the same game
Over and over again
I'm not like them
Here's the money for your patch work
You can't overpower me
And this is not a trademark
To camouflage your indolence
How do you want take command
Without knowledge, morality, logic and rules
Just useless words and waste of time
Still the same old business while things change
Go fuck yourself
I don't know the answer to your question why...why
Why? Maybe because shit smells
