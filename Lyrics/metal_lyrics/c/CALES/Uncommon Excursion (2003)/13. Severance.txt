The path you tread is desolate
How can you be so happy and content
While I have to struggle so much
Unbelievable, this hollow parody of a man
Who used to be my friend
People like you never know their distance
Can't you have fun without the filth
You force on me all the time
Im not gonna share this psychotic drama
Of dismal ambivalence with you
Its too late and you know it
You will never get your life under control again
All the values went down the drain
You're laughing at your own impotence
You've defiled the purity of our friendship
And the road back is blocked
By deposits of self-delusion
Evolution's been passing you by
As time goes by
Only a handful of memories remains
And no more adventures for you
Im soaring too high to swoop
If I did I might miss out on something
That makes a difference
Something I'd hate to lose
