Icy wind is blowing between my lips
Wine went sour, froze in my mouth 
Together with water in the caves of eternity. 
... Thousands of transparent stalactites ... 
I can't see why they resound with love songs 
Full of perversity 
And I don't know why under their glance 
I always find so much despair. 
I must enter the womb deeper 
Before its heart is frozen. 
I must find the elemental furnace, 
To sacrifice to its limpid fire 
And to go up in flames. 
I must feel the force 
As once in a premonition of bloodshed, 
Otherwise we will burn out like sparks 
Shot into the depths of night.
