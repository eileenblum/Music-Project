... Winter came suddenly 
Without mercy it set its icy hungry teeth 
In our necks. 
Heads of noble birds swimming on the water surface 
Flew to thousands of parts just before it froze 
As if struck by invisible hammers. 
Little peevish parts of icy air consumed 
Everything unprepared, wind aided in it and played 
Melancholic symphony of extinction on its silver icicle violin. 
Thousands of icy headsmen with pigs' wailing in the background 
Executed without the only drop of blood. 
... in several minutes only a family of rats remained on the little
island, 
that survived the last winter dance unknowingly ... 
... until the morning the queen of frost 
danced on her icy mirror
At eh snowy throat of winter
