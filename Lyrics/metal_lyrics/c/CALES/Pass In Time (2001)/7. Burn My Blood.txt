I suck from the cup of old age 
Accompanied by my girlfriend Darkness 
Hidden by night I am hunting the invisible 
Through the eye of beast of prey I look at the beginning. 
My spirit is as old as time itself 
And it likes to wander among stars 
Falls through freezing universe were inspired in me 
My eyes are cold forever now 
But my ego behind the horizon of eternity 
Is seeing the grievances and is screaming. 
Burn my blood. 
Burn it, you, whose sense of living is to forget 
You, who have faithful lies and death at their heels 
And your soil gives birth to worms merely. 
Today the whole sky is dimmed by impenetrable sadness 
Red drops are falling through cosmos. 
Burn my blood.
