When twilight gives way to warming beams of the upcoming dawn 
I hover with freedom 
Over open surfaces of lakes 
With coming of early evening when sun lies down into mountain clefts, 
In moonshine I am coming back in the form of hawk, 
Rushing headlong where forests border the horizon. 
Dark hostile lands, where wild animals rule, are my home. 
Where roaring waterfalls rush down rocky cliffs, 
Wild unbridled water ruins banks, 
Furrows its way through slopes and aims down, south. 
Where storms do not end 
At time of winter kingdom's frost, 
Where bunches of mist are gathering 
And fade away again 
When pure pale morning illuminates white plaines with hoarfrost, 
Where time stays unmoving 
To be formed by moments of changes. 
There I live in inseparable bonds of appurtenance.
