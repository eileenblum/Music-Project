Roar of wars was covered by the heavy cloak of dust 
Noises of steel reins were broken in echoes 
Air sweetened with blood 
Pagan rabble 
Fallen under the flag of antiquity. 
I like to breath in and I devour greedily 
Each little drop of the times passed away 
Times of blood and of primary love as well. 
In the evening falling into dark I speak to faces in the walls 
They are much older than we are willing to understand 
And also stronger than us, time and the power of oblivion 
They are engraved into walls by songs from universe. 
I like to listen to the narration of the endless labyrinth of horror 
And at the same time I feel the most material and intoxicating power of
times
With which I feel to be bound.
