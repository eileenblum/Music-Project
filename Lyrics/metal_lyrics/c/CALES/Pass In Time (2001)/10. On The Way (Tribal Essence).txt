We've been marching under the gloomy sky 
Dispersed into small crowds 
From horizon to horizon 
Since time immemorial, for many years. 
Under the endless vault of the sky covered with stars 
Through the land which sucked blood for centuries 
Through the rising clouds of dust 
Through rain and raging winds. 
Past enveloped in mystery 
Future out of sight. 
Hundreds of thousands of stars shattered in space 
Scattered galaxies 
Where the order met with chaos. 
Everything is only a moment, 
Story told many times 
By travelling traders, wanderers and confused dreamers. 
Legends and myths 
Memorials of heroism and great acts 
Real dreams 
Frustrated lives. 
Everything is only a moment 
As well as this song, 
Which I use to hear sung by rooks 
During autumn days of fallen leaves. 
Sea of loneliness in the distant universe 
Phantom, passing allusion, eternity? 
Jump into the abyss or fly up 
Defy or give in. 
Is it a matter of coincidence or free choice?
