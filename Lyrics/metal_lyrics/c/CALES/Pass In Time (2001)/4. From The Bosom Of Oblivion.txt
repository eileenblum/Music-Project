Through oblivion I have been travelling for hundreds of years 
Hidden from your sight 
Passing your fates. 
Born by the night dark 
Into the deeps of blinding darkness 
I penetrate everything. 
I was a pool hidden in a thicket, 
A spring breeze and a winter windstorm, too. 
I guard worlds spun of dreams 
Beyond levels of double truths 
Under the signs of ogam. 
It is me who rides on the saddled time.
