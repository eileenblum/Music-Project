From the deep red shine
From the rumble of the thunder 
From the storms and rain and haze of the mist 
We were created, the superior grand nation 
We stepped up on the way to the peak 
The way led across unknown lands 
We rised milestones along the way unknowingly 
We received the fame will uncover 
The silent is past and the past is in the right 
We rose from the mud from which the world arose 
The fumes of the past fires disappeared over the horizon 
and time scattered us to all parts like a flok of crows 
Over the sparks of the fire we narrate..... 
memory amongst the the leaves blowing in the wind 
So we link together the future and past 
Like the clouds that fly over the sea 
We are the bonds that world is going to acquit and the world will go on 
Like people to their dreams
