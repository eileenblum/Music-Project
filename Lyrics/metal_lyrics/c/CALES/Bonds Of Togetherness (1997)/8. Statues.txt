A dusty flute played Mozart a brace of pigeons on the window 
Sill shit down on the statues of abandon heroes 
They didn t care that someone will dust off 
The statues and uplift them to heaven 
The years-longs dance of flies 
around the useless crap will begin 
This story has an end as well 
The statues aroused dislike, got covered dust, 
and cobwed curtains and pigeons to shit on them 
again Dust off, set up love, get disappointed, hate, 
cover with dust, abandon, and crap on...
