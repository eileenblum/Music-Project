Autumn has returned along with rooks 
rain is cleasing the air of the dust from the roads 
clouds of steam are slinking in the hills 
and bringing dreams of ages past 
a pack of dogs are playing with children 
Horses are running along plaints 
it s peaceful and quiet 
The dreaming land slowly desappear in the mist 
and at once something becomes cold in our hearts 
Trees are falling a sleep 
All is so silent 
As though time has spopped for a while to wish us to remember 
We have known each other for a long time
