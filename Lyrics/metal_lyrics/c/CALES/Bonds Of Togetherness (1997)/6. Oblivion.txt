Wizard voice sung faraway and the sun dive into deep oceans
Night queen is stretching her sparkling dark habit across the sky 
Volves howled at the moon theis psalms 
and stars, silent witnesses for all are going to tell 
Fantastic stories of pilgrimeges and fates of savage tribes, 
People who disappeared like dust blown by the wind 
Timeless combat of fire and ice of races and nations 
Stars turned into shiny memorials in the sky 
Their settlements became deserty covered by sand 
Countries overhelmed with water 
Many are forgotten but some still live in our spirits 
However it s over like a dream passes away 
So hear the song that have been croaking by ravens from the ages 
in autumn days of falling leaves 
Wander through the mist 
Taken by the wind.......
