When energy will disperse in every directions 
Stars will explode 
Planets will collide and flames will strike the sky 
Vulkanos will be revided from their hundreds of years of dozing 
and boiling lava flow 
When icy claciors crack and oceans overflow 
The matter will split and disperse into space 
Then the freezing universe of infinity will swallow 
Up everything and the rule of darkness and ice will begin
