A shock therapy, start
Close your eyes
and cover your ears
Blood pressure pills
Take as much chance as you can carry
To be able to forget
An adorable bundle of nerves
Turned back, hiding behind a womanâs skirt
Take care of your humpback
The Devilâs cane needs no rest
Like a nightmare you cannot chase away
A silly intrusive scene and flashback
A picture you cannot erase from your mind
Days grow shorter, nothing more to say
Oh, how deeply he scorns you
The demon arisen from unceasing wrath
He trampled out the last ruins of your soulless presence
And he keeps breathing in all the power of evil with the dragonâs mouth
And spits acid on your uninviting mask of goodness
Feeds entire hell with boundless hatred
Like snapping oneâs fingers the punishment comes
Not a grain of ash remains
deceased, forgotten, swept into nothingness
With all that can remind of your face
Days have been counted
Nothing more to say
No one will miss... feeble minded lies
Six feet under is the only place where I want to see you
And then Iâll take whatâs mine
Else we shall burn down there

See down there
