Golden gown with the stench of incense
Blood coloured velvet stained with sperm
...how young bite for your uncontrolled lust

Pressed against the wall, with the gun in your ass and heart on a thread
Not an easy way out, when you know whom you face
Brainwhashed with all this silly philanthropy....
Do you really believe human life has the value they attribute it?
How funny ...

So many sliced wounds for my delight
Deeper and deeper to the bone
Skin covered with bleeding runic signs
Lack of conscience
Heartless and cold to your cries
Madness culminates
and the stabbing gets faster
Watching the body ridden with a horrid nervous fit
Final blessing before your impalement
Youâre honoured with taking over the place of Jesus
It will be a pleasant look for your sheep

Do you really believe human life has the value they attribute it?
How funny ...
