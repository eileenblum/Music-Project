Where the mountain stream falls beneath the frozen shroud
In the bleak forest home, a thousand years old frost is the companion
Thick white clouds of haze embrace the animalsâ moss shelters
In the time of sleep, shared by all the forest creatures
While the ember is smouldering, ready to catch fire again
In the spring the snake crawls in to swallow the last shreds of grey

from the nutrient virgin soil
the colourful splendour of the world is reborn
the armed man and a stallion
...adventurous endless wayfaring

nobody knew where the way
he took would lead
Steel, which he refined
When his forge shined with the glitter of all stars into the black nights

The man treaded the wolf trails, crossed by those of deer, lynx and delusions
Frightened bird flocks let know of his presence
In the moments he resisted the traps of wilderness
As it read in the visions of his election

Alliance with mighty spirits ruling the weather
Influencing what is to become ...
How long did he have to travel to get to his destination ....
What things did he discover and learn
How many wounds did he suffer and how many did he have to deal

He who wields iron by rude force and delicate touch
He who tasted and dealt no mercy in regal portions

Words of return, gradually fell into oblivion
As so many moons passed, and people lost their count
No one had a clue who was the man the traveller spoke about
No one knows where he disappeared, and who cut off the head of the
the devil master, plundering here long ago
