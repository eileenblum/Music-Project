The wind is my company in the time of traveling
Caressing my feathers, speaks through the instinct

the zeal of the games with the elements flows in my blood,
when I spread my wings it softly creeps under

Such a high degree of confidence I put into this strength,
that I can know no fear
Noblest of the otherworldliness
Made the whelp a hunter, ignorant of hesitation

Although a storm could pull him down in an instant like a straw
Before he grow up from his wildest youth
Now he knows the due time when to strike and when to escape away
Since time immemorial, we have known, for so long,
where only the memory of gods can reach
The creature chained to the ground has never had a clue what freedom really means

Circling above the regions, where every time I come back
Here in the highlands, the scene of magical moments of harmony
whence came the motion for creation of a perfect coexistence with environment

I will gather all my courage and take a quest to distant hunting grounds
I will find the right current, drifting gently and steadily
In a killer dive headlong, I will seize my prey, swiftly like no other predator
Travelling downwind, soaring up over the mountain peaks, white
floating clouds, I land with a crown of majesty

I will wait till you change your direction and slow down your pace
Then let me safely float and fly again as fast as you can, my precious friend

I will listen to your songs with the most mystical of stories,
with gratitude and loyalty to the end of all ages
Ruling from the heights, soaring above the abysses of death and life

The body of the ground, the spirit of the wind
Back to the gods
...Return
