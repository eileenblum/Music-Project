And the enemy was stricken with a single fatal blow that broke all his rotten bones
His body hung upside down, a piece of frozen ice, sacrifice for the gods and food for hungry beasts
With the advent of spring, the remains of meat rot away in the sun and the wolf buries the bones for a hungry day

What hatred and contempt had the barbarians for the disfigured carrion
That brought ruins, loss, and enslavement
Disgusting helpless body, once heavy with grapes and flowers
Now smelling with urine and decay
And the malicious brood began playing tricks again
Weapons were not left in peace
Flames devoured the homes of their god, but the plague continued to penetrate the air

What was easily redeemed by blood
Time turned to dust
And all those who stubbornly resisted
Now rejoice in the festive hall
In the seat of the mighty ancient spirits
Far above the horizon of the setting sun
In the oases of eternal blissful reveries
