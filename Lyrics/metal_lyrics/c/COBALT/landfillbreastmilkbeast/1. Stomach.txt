I prefer sex when its an animal act,
Oh yeah.

So you sent me pictures of you,
Fucking someone else,
Progress, Incense,
Now we're getting somewhere.
Now that we've acknowledged,
That we're going nowhere,
I couldn't even pretend to care.

His eyes are lost, and his form is gone,
His time was up and he lies in the fields,
In the banks of rivers and on the edges.
What Iâve seen you wonât see,
Urge to kill and love and hold and smash.
Stomach.

The power energy fucking huge holes,
in the face of the universe,
that bastard has nothing.
The power is here.
The heart is in my crotch,
The powerful static,
Show me your insides,
Lets stick lies into each others skins.

His eyes are lost, and his form is gone,
His time was up and he lies in the fields,
In the banks of rivers and on the edges.
What Iâve seen you wonât see,
Urge to kill and love and hold and smash.
Stomach.

So turn off your dusty stares,
Because we're all alone out here.
I couldn't even pretend to care.

I prefer sex when its an animal act.
Beast. Mammal.
Beast. Mammal.
Beast. Mammal.
