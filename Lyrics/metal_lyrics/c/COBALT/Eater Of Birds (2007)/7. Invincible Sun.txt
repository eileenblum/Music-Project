Kiss the sky, and watch the world drown.
Seething blue waves, glistening clear
Deep, Quiet, Drowning solitary

Humanity come to silence
Sounds of world be crushed
Invincible Sun, let it all end!
Machines of the ages- elements, atoms, prostitutes

Slept with the enemy
Felt its embrace
No turning back, much too late
