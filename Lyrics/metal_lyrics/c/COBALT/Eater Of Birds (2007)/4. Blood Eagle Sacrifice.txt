I follow the shifting shadow of the master,
He never walks any slower and never any faster.
"Drape me in unliving flesh,
And smear shit into my eyes."

His breath smelled like rot,
But I couldn't see his face...
I Believe, I follow the black flame.

I see him whisper into clouds of ash,
From them rise men only to fall again.
Poi che se' si grande,
e per lo 'nferno tuo nome si spande!

Blood Eagle Sacrifice
