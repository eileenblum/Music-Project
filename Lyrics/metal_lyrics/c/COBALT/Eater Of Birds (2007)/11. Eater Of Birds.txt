When desert begins to shift, and sand takes its form
Trees turn with dust, breath like fire
Their skin held their soul,
But cut 'em loose
And watch 'em fly
Way, way up until we're all blinded by the sun
And black is light 
And sight is black
Lay 'em out and hold 'em down
No one's leaving 'til I'm euphoric!
I am one with the wilderness!
I stole the sky!
I am the eater of birds!
