Empty shores echo to me,
Arms of quiet tide, unquestioning,
Under an starlit sky open to accept,
The ship I have clung to over dark waters.
I fall crying into the wet beach,
Hands clutching, Mouth filled with sand,
Waves rolls over heel, back and down my nose,
My body sinks with the tide.

Unnatural breath against the enemy.
onethousand strikes of the stone hammer.
Hands plowing dry through clay and soil,
Bellies and fields are empty, they call for storms,
There will be no fires on this beach,
No spears shaped to hunt for a feast,
The man in the sky pulls the tide up high,
My body to the ocean, my tears to the tide.

Every heartbeat pumps your cries into my veins.
They turn to ash and coat my lungs.

I dream of you walking away
through October's cold rays
I see a beach the witherer can't see
standing in the dark listening to waves with me

I open my eyes
sorry to still be alive
his jaw is open wide
memories I cant hide.
