The Prophet is dead. And I can't see.
The Prophet is there. But I can't see.
The lost that are dead. Will set you free.
The lost that are dead. Will set you free...
Hey...

My neighbor is sad. I don't know quite why.
He relies on the drink. To maintain a line.
There's hives on my skin now. And my brow oh she bleeds.
My brow oh she bleeds now, now, now, now, now...

Hey...

And I believe, And I believe, And I believe, I won't believe.
And I believe, And I believe, And I believe, I won't believe.
Roll off the grass, and let the insects breathe.
Roll off the grass, and let us, the insects, breathe
Roll off the grass, and the let the incest breed
Roll off the grass, and let us, the insects, breathe.

Catching the sun! Watching the sun! Worship the sun! Stare at the sun!!
