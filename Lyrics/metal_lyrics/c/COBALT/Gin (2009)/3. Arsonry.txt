Cry at my feet; The god made of Man,
Drinking your face with my hands,
You were the one clinging to me,
There's nothing but the sex you gave us both,
I was always stronger than you,
I'm burying your soul with my boots,
Walking away, fucking and drunk.

Remember ten minutes of your worst time for me.
The ocean was trying to swallow the land,
I don't remember, the words never leave.
Those moments won't... Fuck I forgot.

Lets burn down together.
Lets burn down our houses together.
Lets burn down forever.
Lets burn down our children together.

I'll spit on you again but I don't know when,
I'll wait to see you outside the gates of heaven,
Now I could explain what I couldn't back then,
The devil walk me away with a sympathetic grin.

Lets burn down together.
Lets burn down our houses together.
Lets burn down forever.
Lets burn down our children together.

Burn me down, shoot me in the chest,
Burn me down, shoot me in the chest,
Burn me down, shoot me in the chest,
Burn me down, shoot me in the chest,
Lets fuck one last time, In a burning bed.
Lets fuck one last time, In a burning bed.
Lets fuck one last time, In a burning bed.
Lets fuck one last time, In a burning bed.
