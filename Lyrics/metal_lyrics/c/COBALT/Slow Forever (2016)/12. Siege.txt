We stand alone in the dark
Naked, with silver faces
The soultime dripping down our chests
Distant supernova children
Buried topography
One-eyed birds flying
Birds upset the fields
Fading faces in the smoulder
Blunt force
Pick axe within the
Cities fall
blank stare
Fire breathing
blank stare
The sky splits in two
Locusts are screaming
Sirens in the distance
