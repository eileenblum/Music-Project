Pity for the hardened screaming end of life
a former comfort or a lack of self
itâs not over now its just the tip of a greater fall
a greater fall

my second hand devotion is a first hand myth
a myth that echoes in the body, Manipulate

feed me tragic stories through rusted metal tubes
i prefer youâre leather skin to the corpse i know
or the savageness trapped in youâre eye

push the bottom deeper
bring us closer
self unable satiate

not one with youâre flesh
an unfelt betrayal

Pinnacle

pinnacle of the archetype
Spends its life in gangbang degradation

try and transcend
pull me out of my body
i wonât ammend
this smell is so heavy

Transcend

in dreams i bury you in my veins
With no emotion
Scrapped from the throat
of a wounded child

pull me out of my body

The pigs run wild.
