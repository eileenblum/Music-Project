Emaciated point of entrance
The oldest wound
Buried in eyes
The ease of dying
Condone the act of self destruction
Your sheltered life
Leaving you in between
Hope and addiction

Shaking

Conformity and self abuse
It's not a fad
Devote your self to selflessness
It's more than religion
Condone the act of self destruction
A ritual
And bury it in the veins of lovers

Shuddering on the surface reminds me of you
And how we'll burn
On that thin border line we will burn baby burn

I feel a fever coming on
What's always there is always gone

I can't trust anyone
Hit the streets with the cloak and dagger
Neon steam on a melting beam
Pissing gin with your bath salt stagger

Shaking
Emaciated point of entrance
The oldest wound
A ritual
The ease of dying
Condone the act of selfishness
Leaving you

Shaking

I feel a fever coming on
What's always there is always gone
What's always mine is always mine
I want to leave my mark this time
