Itâs unending and Iâm out of time
my confession, i have never felt but just a burning numb
Creeps inside instincts hide

selective conscious and truth less whispers
a fatal slip
a fatal slip

holding the tongue
holding the tongue

Time, regression, intellect
we move like cancer within the act

sink the poison and bury youâre truths
Blind fold body bag and talk about god
suck the chair leg and bite the curb

time regression intellect
we move like cancer within the act

Slow slide
Disconnect
no control
no control

Slow slide
disconncet
no control
no control

Fatal consumpition
moves inside me
and i pull it out
the design is old
and these hooks pull
commit the act
Ruiner
kill the light
ruiner
scrape the blue sky

Slow slide
Disconnect
