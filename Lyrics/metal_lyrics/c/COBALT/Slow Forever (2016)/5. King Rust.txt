A leaking drain
Broken through
A burnt roof
The stranger
Corrosive visions
On the other side
Of a black mirror

The glory chain

Stained glass sanity
To doubt existence is all she needs

Hoisting myself out of myself

Pushing and pulling and clawing my way

Spitting out moon dust and pushing away

And hearts unmend
And bodies unmend
And prayers unattended
And answers unquestioned

And I resist

If I could be a fly on shit
If I could just get some rest
And you could break my arms
I could find some solace

But I resist

Not in the picture
Or the common disgust
Its in cheap vodka
And the galloping neurosis

The glory chain

And bodies unmend
And hearts unmend
And prayers unattended
And the animals rule

Hoisting myself out of myself
