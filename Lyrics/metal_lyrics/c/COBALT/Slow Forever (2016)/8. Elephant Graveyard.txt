Riding the golden wave
I still see you without eyes
I still hear you without eyes
I still feel you without eyes
I still hear you without eyes

Dried up fingers applying pressure
Dried up fingers applying pressure

I still see you with my eyes
I still feel you with my eyes

Riding the golden wave

Painted nails that bleed out
Dirty hopes without care
And in the end
While youâre gone we will wish you were there

Cold whores hair mother fucking nightmare
Cold whores hair mother fucking nightmare
Cold whores hair mother fucking nightmare
Cold horse what a fucking nightmare

My hands still shudder
Prison door drops
I hear the fluttering of wings
I reached out and touched a horned goat
Draped in opiate songs and burnt candles
Dead owl split in two
Gift to the ghost of negative emotions

Cold whores hair mother fucking nightmare

Riding the golden wave

Cold whores hair mother fucking nightmare

Dont fuck with me
Ill set you free
Scar tissue
Too stiff for feeling
Plant the seeds
Youâre fading
I paid off whats mine
But money means nothing

All you wanted was comfort
All you got were graves
