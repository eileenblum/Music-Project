The fields of time are burning
shield are eyes from burning

Enslaved distilled violence survival
lizard brain hate

Iron to steel
steel to rust
rust to dirt
dirt to time

The past in pile of ash forgotten in the cycle
erased in a pile of ash forgotten in the cycle
For animal blood and bone
For animal blood and skin

down on the shit  sphere
Speaks from the deep
passion slow burn

the return of misery to the open lands
is the only law
the hunter is the final judge
hail cruelty the unspoken truth

Revenge. modern man is grave desecrated
Hey. modern man is a grave resurected

Carcass has fallen transfiguration beyond
let me be a lamb upon the blackest eye
see us walk over the bones of those who have fallen
let me be a lamb so that i can follow
the fire is winding every ember
Let me be a lamb so that i can follow

teeth of god bite where they will.
