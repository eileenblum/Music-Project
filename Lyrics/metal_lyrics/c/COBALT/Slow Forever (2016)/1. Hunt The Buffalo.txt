Mothers mouth is choking
On her past obsessions
She canât find an out
She canât find whats been swallowed

No guiding lights
Or selfless acts
No reason for just consequence
Spread out for all to fuck
Open teeth bare to all
Lines drawn

Blood and bone
Not unlike a person

I am not a man

Denial feeds youâre resistance
And it leaves with a bullet
Modesty only exists
In memory
Only exists in humanity
Final possession
Bitter consumption
Inbred texture
Savage beatings
Led to the well we will be
Slow forever

Shotgun blast rain dance

I am not a man

I am just a dog

Within thrall

Denial Feeds youâre resistance
And it leaves with a bullet
Modesty only exists
In memory only exists in humanity
Final possession bitter consumption
Inbred texture
Savage beatings
Led to the well
We will be slow forever

30 years shit luck
Hydromorphine
Kerosene
Anal sex
Amphetamines
Car crash
Anti-depressants
Incest
Depravity
We accept
Bed smells like burnt foil
Broken hope in a burning dream
