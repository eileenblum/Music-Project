Skin to skeleton [4x]
Some of its parts are moving
Bitter folds of flesh burning
Some of its parts are moving
Set the animals free

Sweet kerosene [4x]
Some of its parts are moving
The mouth is an open wound
Open cavity, where the heart used to be
Trapped in the throne of the Golden God
Precious, and flammable
A lucid shadow!

Old man.
Set them free.
Eat them whole.
Kerosene.

I followed the collapsing star
To the edge of the universe
And sat with the Golden God
All with dogs
All with bulls

Fists through glass to the other side
I want to breathe water
Into a den of hogs
Because in the end
We are torn from every which way
Just a man stumbling around
Until he canât feel anymore
