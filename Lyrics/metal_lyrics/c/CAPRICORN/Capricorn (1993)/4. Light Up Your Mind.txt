The one hidden behind the screen
Tellin' me what to do
Digital manipulators
Guiding all my moves,
Don't you ever dare, don't you ever try
Don't you ever twist or rule my life

All of a sudden
He kind of froze in his tracks,
It took him a while to realize
Out of himself, he was just a clown
Out of his head, for sure out of his own
So light up yourself, light up your mind
Light up yourself, light up your mind

The instructions to the games we play
Reflect sadistic fun
Send our boys down to hell
No matter what they've done,
Don't you ever dare, don't you ever try
Don't you ever blind or cover up my sight

Stop dizzying my head
Won't answer you, my soul's already dead
Your orders been implanted from the start
Were killing personality, but didn't reach my heart

All of a sudden
I kind of froze in my tracks
It took me a while to fight you

Never dare. never try, never twist or rule my life
Never dare, never try, never cover up my sight
