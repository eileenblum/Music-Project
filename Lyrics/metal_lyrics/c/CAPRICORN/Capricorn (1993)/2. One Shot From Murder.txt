Incredibly armed we're sneaking
Around beyond all law
Let the terror reign in our minds so dark
We're watching the world from the outdoor
Suspect of religion that knows no God

Lurking, creeping, violence still breathing
One shot from murder
One shot from murder
Like a knife in my back
Feel my soul is turning black
In a flood of sin we're drowning

Each of us so lonely
Sitting in a cage
With our heads so full of hate and rage
Lethargy will lose some day
And you'll set yourself on fire
Into another life a wicker image

One shot from murder
One shot from murder
One shot from murder
One shot from murder
