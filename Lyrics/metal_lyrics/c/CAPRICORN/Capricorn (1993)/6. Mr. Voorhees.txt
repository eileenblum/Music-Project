Alone in the dark, feel him close beside you
An icy breeze blown in your neck
A wind like pain freezing all your courage
His ruthless hand will cut your head

Rising from the cold lake
He's got a date with his second fate
Nine lives to carry death
Jason bringing down the axe
And send your soul to the black

No need to scream Jason knows no mercy
Wherever you run, he's already there
So if you meet him show some sympathy
Shake hands with murder take him as a friend

Alone in the dank, feel him close beside you
An icy breeze blown in your neck
A wind like pain freezing all your courage
His ruthless hand will cut your head
