I'm roaring thunder I'm howling wind
I'm the mightiest tornado you've ever seen
From 10 thousand feet
Now heading for the ground
Dancing with the devil, turning heaven upside down
Plunging into madness, I'm feeling so divine
Now's the time to set this world afire

I'm gonna burn
Never expire, gonna light up the sky
I'm gonna burn
Mr. Firestorm's gonna melt this town into form

I'm the hammer of Thor, I'm a punch like hell
I'm the ultimate overkill,
Ripping through the smoke with a breakneck speed
Writhing in death is the only drug I need
Plunging into madness I'm feeling so divine
Now's the time to set this world afire
