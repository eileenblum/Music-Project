Must be early in the morning
As I raise my head
Heard an eagles cry so far above in the air
Blinded by the rising sun
Crossing my memories edge
As he spreads his wings
Takes me back to the past

Lord, there must be someone
Listening to my prayer
Lord , there must be someone out there
Does anybody hear me?
Give me peace of mind,
Oh Lord lonely is the world

Sound of battle drawing nearer
A memory never banned
From a soul that killed and never shared
But raged across the land
So many, many of them died
This is where their spirits lie
Sometimes whispering in the wind
Listen, I can hear them cry
