The highway's where I'm livin',
The road is where I dream
Staring at that white line
Back home is where I wanna be
Missing all the women
The best that you can get
Thinking of my buddys
At the pubs that I like best
Day after day, mile after mile
Sleepless hours. I drive all night
The radio plays the sound I like
Pouring beer by beer as time goes by
It's an endless highway
Such a lonely road
Got miles to go
It's a long way home
Long way home

Colleagues on the CB
Two weeks the same old joke
Nothing new to turn me on
Can't even smile no more
