Life's an endless struggle
In decades of poverty
Doesn't matter what you feel in this modern slavery,
Consume! obey the economy law
It's gonna put up the limits
And no one's gonna follow

The higher they climb
The harder they fall
The harder they try, the harder they die
the harder they fall
The higher they climb
The harder they fall
The more they bleed, the more they need
The harder they fall
The harder they fall
I
Life's a constant battle
Setting every day
Fulfilling Darwinism in its whole simplicity
Condemned, destroyed, if not one of the few
Blessed are the fortunate abandoned are the poor
