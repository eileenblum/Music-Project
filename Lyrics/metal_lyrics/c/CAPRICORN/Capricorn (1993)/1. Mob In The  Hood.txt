Livin' it up when the sun goes down
Getting loaded. my mind all stones
Double action starts me up
Got time to kill, gonna hit another cop

From downtown gutter
To the red light district
I Feel so good
With the mob in the 'hood
Paradise wasteland
I feel so good
Paradise wasteland
And the mob in the 'hood

No remorse for the man in blue
shoot or get shot it's up to you
Violence sells so make your choice
Never fuck with the toughest boys
