Seconds passed like hours
Time stood nearly still
As he slowly crossed the dusty street
His gun already loaded
Prepared to seal his fate
Any withdrawal would be too late

Shotdown downtown
Shotdown downtown
Only one of the brave that wanted to save the world
Only one of the poor to fit the grave
And never come back for more

Entered the bar to pour his final drink
Sweat ran down his weathered akin,
Hands began to shiver courage disappeared
Clutched his belt to control his fear

Seconds passed like hours
Time stood nearly still
As he reeled across the empty street
Slowly hit the ground
All pain was somehow gone
Blood ran down his tired limbs
