All systems on alert
Suspense fills the air
I can see nobody scared
Though it's deafness they dare
All machines ready
When a flash blinds my eyes
With everything turned up to ten
I'll lead you out of dark
Into the light

From the limits of fear
Through the boundaries of ache
Nothing to stop me
Or stand in my way
From my wildest dreams
Till the end of the game,
Nothing to keep me
From exceeding the limits
Exceeding the limits of pain

Nothing to save you
From the madman on stage
Some mean blasting voice
Enslaves you to rage
Millions will follow
Ascending the peak
Shall writhe in powerful noise
But think of what it means
