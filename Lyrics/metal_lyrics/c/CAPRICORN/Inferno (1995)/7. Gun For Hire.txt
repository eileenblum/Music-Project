If you get into trouble
Or can't handle someone's hate
Better get him out of your way
Before it's too late
Don't look for me, I'll find you
Just give your rage a call
For the lowest fee
'Cause it's fun for me
To get rid of 'em all
To get rid of 'em all

Long goodbye or sudden death
Whatever you need
I'll do the best I can
Shoot to kill
I'm killing for you
Do or die, man
Life means do or die

Hiding at the end of the wire

You think you're wife's a loony bitch?
She's strangling your nerves?
You'll see I'm the perfect choice
To give her what she deserves
Don't look for me, I'll find you
Just give your rage a call
All what's left is a bag of red splash
On a lonesome back street wall
On a lonesome back street wall

Long goodbye or sudden death
Whatever you need
I'll do the best I can
Shoot to kill
I'm killing for you
Do or die, man
Life means do or die

Hiding at the end of the wire

I've got a gun for hire

If you get into trouble
Or can't handle someone's hate
Better get him out of your way
Before it's too late
Don't look for me, I'll find you
Just give your rage a call
For the lowest fee
'Cause it's fun for me
To get rid of 'em all
To get rid of 'em all
