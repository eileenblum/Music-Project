It's been a long sleep in the shadow
And no one has noticed the breed
Of anger, rage and disorder
Grown to a violent disease
Soldiers to fight for utopia
Helpless the nation's defeat
Banned from law and order
Bombing the land to its knees

Shot through the heart of the state
Destroying fucking liberty
A call for Armageddon
A call for global decay
Spread the chilling wings of the bat
Deliver the world
To the claws of the mad

Burning the temples of justice
Spilling the president's blood
Spreading fear and terror
Like a divine unstoppable flood
Our way to independence
Is just the mortal way of life
The power of the strongest
Leaving weakness far behind

Shot through the heart of the state
Destroying fucking liberty
A call for Armageddon
A call for global decay
Spread the chilling wings of the bat
Deliver the world
To the claws of the mad

Life for revolution
We'll die for anarchy
We stand for devastating
All your pleasures and dreams
Soldiers to fight for utopia
Waiting for their time to come
Clutching to manic illusions
Sure that it won't take too long

Shot through the heart of the state
Destroying fucking liberty
A call for Armageddon
A call for global decay
Spread the chilling wings of the bat
Deliver the world
To the claws of the mad
