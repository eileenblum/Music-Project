Introducing with a deafening roar
A giant metal dinosaur
Shrieking steel in a cloud of smoke
Jaws are gleaming, all systems go
Jaws are gleaming, all systems go

Tons of steel
On iron wheels
Eating helpless industry
You cannot stop this mean machine
Hungry for crunchy economic dreams

Iron biter
Iron biter
Iron biter
Hungry for crunchy economic dreams
Hungry for crunchy economic dreams

Swallowing trucks like chocolate bars
Chopping ships right in half
Trains and airplanes are just right
To still that monstrous appetite
To still that monstrous appetite

Iron biter
Iron biter
Iron biter
Hungry for crunchy economic dreams
Hungry for crunchy economic dreams

Leaving with a deafening roar
Eaten everything so far
Devastation disappears
Looking for another meal

Iron biter
Iron biter
Iron biter
Hungry for crunchy economic dreams
Hungry for crunchy economic dreams
