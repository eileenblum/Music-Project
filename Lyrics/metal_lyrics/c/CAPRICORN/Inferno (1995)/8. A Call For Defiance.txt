People, raise your heads
And realize what you see
You're living under pressure
You'll die between the wheels

The arrogance of power
Has built a reign of fear
Life's a brutal nightmare
That happens bloody real

How long will you kneel
How much are you going to take?
'Til you see that this judgement is fake

Raise your heads and realize what you see
People, stand for what you believe

Defy the leaders
Destroy that goddamn mastership
Deny the preachers on judgement day
Unite the people
Divide your minds from lethargy
Defy the leaders of a corrupt state
And cry for liberty

People raise your heads
And realize what you see
To make this world for living
And not for slavery

The mob has come together
And anger stills the day
Hordes of brave and faithful
Release this earth from pain

How long will you kneel
How much are you going to take?
'Til you see this system is fake
