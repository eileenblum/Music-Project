She's lying close beside me
On a white sheet painted red
My heart somehow in motion
As I gently touch her cut off head
Try to remember
To get hold of what has changed
The beauty of the evening
Into a paradise of pain

Moonlight
Moonlight
You sometimes make me smile

Witness myself creeping
Running for decay
Find my jaws are working
As they kill the night away
Just an evil shadow
That has found a human shell
The good in me is fading
But the wild side is doing well

Moonlight
Shining deep into my mind
Light the dark side of my soul
I'm moonstruck
Moonstruck on the whole

I'm moonstruck on the whole

Darkness embracing my sense
In the pale light of the moon
Darkness has taken control
I'm moonstruck on the whole
