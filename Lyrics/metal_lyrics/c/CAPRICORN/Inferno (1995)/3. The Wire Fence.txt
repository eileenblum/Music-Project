The staring crowd is standing
Their eyes an empty gaze
Don't know what they're waiting for
But breeding day by day
Millions gonna follow
Into the promised land
Ignorant and fed to death
I don't wanna face disgrace

There's hungry eyes watchin' the sun go down
Can't believe they're gonna make it through the dawn
The world doesn't end behind the wire fence
The world doesn't end
Behind the wire fence

Today I saw a black man
Crying on TV
In his arms his dying son
Jar of flies beneath
Staring simply desperate
Into my perfect world
But ignorant and fed to death
I don't dare to face disgrace

There's hungry eyes watchin' the sun go down
Can't believe they're gonna make it through the dawn
The world doesn't end behind the wire fence
The world doesn't end
Behind the wire fence

It's not a crime to be born
You know life's for everyone
But on this earth
Something's fucking wrong
Tear down the fence
And put three worlds into one
Put three worlds into one
Put three worlds into one

There's hungry eyes watchin' the sun go down
Can't believe they're gonna make it through the dawn
The world doesn't end behind the wire fence
The world doesn't end
Behind the wire fence
