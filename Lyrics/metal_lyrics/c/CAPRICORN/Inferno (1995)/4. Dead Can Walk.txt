I'm taming storms, I'm melting steel
Bare foot I'm walking seas
Every night my mind's across the skies
To hear the spirits speak
Feel immortal, feel no pain
Acting like the hand of god
Evil shadows, demon seed
Obey my holy words

I can give you sun
I can bring you rain
I can talk to ghosts
And they talk to me

Do you believe?
Dead can walk
Do you believe one man
Is gonna heal the world

Watch me praying on TV
Every night on the air
Thousands join me, a psalm for each
Together we fight despair
Send me money, bring me cash
Sure, I'm gonna spend it right
I'll keep it for me and the holy lord
And we'll live a faithful life

I can give you sun
I can bring you rain
I can talk to ghosts
And they talk to me

Do you believe?
Dead can walk
Do you believe one man
Is gonna heal the world
