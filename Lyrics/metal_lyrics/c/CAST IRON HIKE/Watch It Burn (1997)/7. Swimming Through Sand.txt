Before me and at
The foot of the stream
I found some sort of
Plastic sanity
But I never asked
For the sand in my eyes
To leave me dry
Oh my, oh my
I never wondered why
I couldn't embrace any hope
So I stood there staring down
At the end of my rope
So quick to decompose
I suppose it was all of
The endings I left untold
So quick to decompose
I suppose it was all of
The stories I never told
But I'll pull the sand
From my eyes
And I won't let
This bring me down
