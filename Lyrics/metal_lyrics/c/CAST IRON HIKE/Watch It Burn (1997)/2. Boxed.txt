There's a door that
I know won't open
And its windows
May as well be black
With a state check
And a lot of hoping
I'm trying to remember
My escape back
Youth is a myth
Into the womb where
The paint never chips
And a draft is as seldom
As is the whip
And absent is
My normal affliction
A pre-pubescent
Drug addiction
The orders come
And go with every breath
They seem to bleed
Until there's nothing left
When nobody gives a fuck
What have you?
When nobody gives a fuck
So what do you give into?
Man I feel as though
I want to just
Burn this all down
Now looking out of a box
I'm looking out
