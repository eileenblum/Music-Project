Dig deep into this pile of shit
That beats as my heart
There you'll find the longing
For something that I tore apart
I needed to turn my back
Like adhesive I stuck
Behind that line
I lost touch
After we last touched
And so now it seems
That I'm losing my mind
We wanted an ideal
And there's nothing
I wouldn't have sacrificed
Until I looked in the mirror
And found myself at home inside
Dig deep into this pile of filth
That pumps from my heart
Understand that if I can't find peace
Then I'll surely leave scars
Leave the door unlocked
I'm coming home
I don't want to be
Advised my rights
I don't need no reason
To hide behind an alibi
Take my breath
And sallow whole
This could be the last time
You stand upright
Wave your hair
From out of your face
And watch your life
Fall out of sight
