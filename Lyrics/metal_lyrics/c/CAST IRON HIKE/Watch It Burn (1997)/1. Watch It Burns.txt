There came a day
When I pulled the carpet out
From under my world
I had been led astray
At an early age
And in such a way
That their skin did curl
Because I made my best mistakes
Every now and again
In that tired mill town
Where I waited eighteen years
Of my life to pick my head
Up off of the ground
Without any reason
For leaving
Is this treason?
No, no, no
I don't want to hide it
And I'm too weak to fight it
While being trapped inside
Of it for so long
That motherfucker town
Took the furthest route
Out from under my skin
And by the time
That my jaded self
Finally found my way out
They tried to let me in
Still I never really
Did believe in this
Because it just seemed
That this was no way to be
But in the end it was through
All of their charades
That I did see
With no reason for leaving
We're still freezing
Burn, burn, burn
"I'll learn to hide it"
Still we stand divided
Because I've recognized
Now watch it burn
With every reason
For leaving, I'm freezing
Burn, burn, burn
I've recognized that
We stand divided
And I've grown to despise
Now watch it burn
