Top of the pavement steaming
Our bare feet are burnt to the bone
Expending miles and miles without reason
And trying so hard not to sour
You know that
This is not the way
It seems as though
They move only to gain
And we're face down
In the meal box
Chewing the lies that
We've reluctantly bought
It's all about the fall
This cup of tears
Sits steaming
While our voice
Quiets down to a drone
Expending miles and miles
Without reason
And trying so hard not to sour
They know only
How to push and strain
It's time for us
To realign our angst
We're face down
In the meal box
Chewing the lies that
We've reluctantly bought
It's time to realign
We're living by design
We live, we die by design
