Dead inside
Stopped up
Like a sewer pipe
Sealed in glass
She sparkles
Under streetlights
She paints her blood
Red with a paintbrush
So she'll never forget
How right the red looks
If she could shed this skin
She'd give it all back
Fixated on kerosene
And candlelight
She's got a dream but
It only keeps her up nights
She's sharing her twin bed
With a thorn bush
Because even the real thing
Never meant that much
If she could shed his skin
She'd give it all back
