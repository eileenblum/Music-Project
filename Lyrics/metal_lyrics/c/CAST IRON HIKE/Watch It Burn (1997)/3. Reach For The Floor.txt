I felt the tears calling
It manifests in subtle ways
It's hard to keep up the balling
When the tears are spiked
With feats of rage
Walk out, walk out, walk out
I just can't feel anymore
Load up, lock down, hold out
It's hard to tell exactly
What's in store
When I wonder how
I ever made it this far
My hands dig
Through my pockets
And they find out
Just how empty they are
And when I wonder
"How will I ever make it
Through this day?"
That's when I reach for the floor
Running hard into something
And wondering if I'll finalize today
Staring back at my nothing
Everyone wants me to
Wear a different face
Fed up, fed up, fed up
Your daily routine is my slow death
Tied up, fed up, live up
To all the horror in this head
When I wonder how
I ever made it this far
My head tears through my heart
And trades the emptiness for scars
And when I wondered
"How will I ever make it
Through these days?"
Well that's when
The horror hit the floor
Fed up, fed up, fed up
Your daily routine is my slow death
It's times like these that I do believe
That I'd be better off dead
I gave a smile
I gave two, I gave three
But still they wanted more
As the day deteriorates
My only defense
Is to reach for the floor
