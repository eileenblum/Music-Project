Your mind's an engine
That drives a wheel
A wheel that burns in the flesh
Like flesh on hot steel
I wanna make you suffer, I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel so bad
You'd even kill yourself to heal

No more

Now things have changed nothing remains the same
Once you were the proud, the gift, the son
Of your father's game. I wanna make you listen
To the words I found to hold your throat
And see you scream without a sound.

No more

Your hands are shakin, I'll make you dance
Further on now, kiss the devil's romance
Hate me, love me, I hate you, love..... ?
I'll use my hands and transform you
Into pieces I will tear you
Never had the will to bring you down
But now that I'm strong as you
I'd like to beat you to the ground
I'm feeling better
And wish that you could see
How I'm doing the same old things you did to me
