Words on the wall greet me
They make me feel alive
Looking at the door and waiting for dinner
but eating dogfood is not my style

Lonely, lonely, tonight, lonely
Gotta get away from here, the sooner the better

I keep seeing your face girl
How I wish I could feel you
Maybe you're screwing another one
While I'm in this box waiting to be done

Lonely, lonely, tonight, lonely
Gotta get away from here, the sooner the better

I've tried counting the days here
Can't tell the night from day anymore
Living as a homeboy
The worst thing that could happen to you is to feel
Lonely, lonely at night, lonely, lonely
A-another night, another time
Another day and a day in time
For a crime I didn't (commit)
I can't stand this any longer
Can't stand this no more
Can't take this no more
I'll be back you bitch
From the moment I'm walking out of here
Be ready for my sweet revenge
