You, you once broke my belief
And I know, I was so damn naive
Remember the days you acted so real
The things you said were not a big deal
You could call me,
whenever you wanted
I was yours, a toy, always ready
Get away, don't try to manipulate
makes me, wonder
Whenever you're hanging around
I die in the front of your feet
And I've tried to exist
on your heat

Sucking me dry for my energy
Sucking me dry with your energy
Sucking me dry for the energy

Get away, stay away from me
Get away don't come
ooh so close to me
And I know you'll be back
So tell, tell me what do you need
Allright, take my body to feed

Sucking me dry for my energy
Sucking me dry with your energy
Sucking me dry for your energy
Sucking me dry for more energy
