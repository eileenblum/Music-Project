At point black well you'll know
If you got the balls to win the show
So be aware, if you dare cause you're racin towards glory

Go on we're on the road
Don't give up never slow
Go on faster down that road
It's war on wheels

Sometimes we all need
Adrenaline to feed our greed
Feel free, what's more
To catch the big dollar fever

Go on we're on the road
Don't give up never slow
Go on faster dawn that road
It's war on wheel's

Something's going wrong now
I feel it
Pushing my luck over the edge
But I'm fucking fearless
Just a little bit faster
