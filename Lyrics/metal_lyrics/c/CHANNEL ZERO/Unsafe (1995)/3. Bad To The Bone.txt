Walk the streets of rage
On the edge 'coz you're goin' insane
Lovin' all the pain
Dragged through the mud, the confusion and daze

You can't escape it. Bad to the bone
Don't contemplate it. Bad to the bone
You cannot fake it. Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone

Blood begins to boil
Heated by the world's conflicts and toil
Anger takes control
Out of site, out of touch with your soul
See the vision of the dark reality
A Frankenstein created by humanity
With open arms I enjoy my vanity
Revel in its pain and insanity

You can't escape it. Bad to the bone
Don't contemplate it. Bad to the bone
You cannot fake it. Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone

Yeah the world is crazy
All these crazy people keep walking up, walking down the streets
They, they make me crazy
That's why I am so
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
