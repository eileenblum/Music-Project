Straight out, I'm heading for a miracle
Pushing the edge makin' it subliminal
To loose or win that's not the essence
Teamwork makes for us all the difference
Although you cannot tell me
They're all jokers on same training therapy
Programmed to go for only one thing
Gold medals hangin' on a string

Gotta run, run with the torch

So long ago all watching the TV-screens
Hearts beating like you never ever seen
Eternal flame burns in the heart
But every four years it glows for Olympiad
See them skating with the smile on the ice
A kind of magic straight outta paradise
Programmed to go for only one thing
Gold medals hangin' on a string

Gotta run, run with the torch

One thing's for sure, winning can be beautiful
Competition is real and totally natural
But be honest with yourself when
you're part of the game
Playing on dope just ain't the same
Tears of pain and tears of joy
It doesn't really matter as long as you enjoy
Programmed to go for only one thing
Gold medals hangin' on a string

The need for sport is driven by passion
United all over in colors and fashion

Gotta run, run with torch
