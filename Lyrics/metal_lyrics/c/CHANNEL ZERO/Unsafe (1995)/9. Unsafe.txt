Living all alone do I need security, no!
I got 20 locks upon my doors
Do they give me guarantees, no!

I bought a gun now !
I have a gun now !
I wear a gun now !
And I always keep it loaded

What's going on I hold my breath
To hear the noise, yeah !
My heart is beating in my throat
Did I heard a voice, no!

I bought a gun now !
I have a gun now !
I wear a gun now !
And I always keep it loaded

I'm living with a growing fear
I'm aiming at every single noize I hear
My dog's going crazy
But I'm glad that he's around
Even though we can't communicate
We both listen for a sound

My dog's going crazy
But I'm glad that he's around
Even though we can't communicate
We both listen for a sound

Do I have the door shut, my room, my windows locked
From the moment I see a stranger
On my property I will blow him away
From the moment I find someone in my house I won't hesitate

From the moment I hear someone
From the moment I see someone
From the moment I'll shoot someone
and I'll do it anyway
