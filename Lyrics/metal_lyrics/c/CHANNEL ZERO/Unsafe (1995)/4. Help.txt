Help strangers bearing down on me
Help no one else can cry for me
Help what is going wrong with me
Help, Help

Help why can no one ever see
Help that fate has left a scar on me
Hell I'm looking for some light relief
Help, help

Help faith don't mean a thing to me
Help walking down a dead end street
Help time has got me on my knees
Help, Help

Well listen up you friends of mine
Tell me what I have to leave behind
Hell I'm hanging by a thread, so fine
Help, help

Help faith don't mean a thing to me
Help walking down a dead end street
Help time has got me on my knees
Help, Help

For those who care
For those who love
Seek no sense don't try to understand
'cause if you do
You'll feel the pain
Inside your heart, never to explain
