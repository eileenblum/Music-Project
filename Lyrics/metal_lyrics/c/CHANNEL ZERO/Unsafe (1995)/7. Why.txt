Three weeks and 2 day's ago
Since I was released from goal
17 years behind bars
create a hate you cannot kill
Every time they scapped my face
Careful not to leave a trace
For many years I've borne the pain
I'm still alive but insane

Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again

You push my face against the wall
I didn't do nothing let me go
Check it out yeah, check it out yeah, check it out I'm clean
I didn't pull a gun I didn't kill no pig

Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again
Why don't you shoot me down
Why don't you shoot me again

Can't, can't see nothing, nothing that looks like cops
Badges blow my mind away
Uniforms just make me sick
