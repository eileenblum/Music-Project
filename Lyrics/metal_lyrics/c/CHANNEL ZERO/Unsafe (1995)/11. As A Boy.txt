Fate chose me as a conscript
Hang the carkeys on the wall
Pack my bags, change my home town
For the desert's night cold

As a boy, as a man
As a boy and as a man, yeah

Nothing to lose here
Except maybe your life
Only the goodness
They will protect you
The enemy's trophy that's what we are
Gotta be strong gotta kick some ass
Or kill the time by smoking grass

Stop get ready focus the first one
Stop get ready focus the next one

And shoot'em down in rows
That's better man
You'll become a man
You'll become a man of honour and pride
That's better man
You'll become a man
You'll become a man of honour and pride

Stop get ready focus the first one
Stop get ready focus the next one

As a boy, as a man
As a boy and as a man, yeah

Mama cries daddy's pride
Girlfriend's pregnant time to realize
Defend your country
Join the army fight for freedom
How the fuck, do you become a man here?

As a boy, as a man
As a boy and as a man, yeah
