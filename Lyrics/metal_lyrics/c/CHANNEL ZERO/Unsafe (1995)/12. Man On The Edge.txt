I'm a loser, in a suckers world
Left on the streets worthless and weak
Pointless drifting far from home
Is this the only thing that I deserve

They don't pay attention

Useless, in a numbers world
Dropped like a beercan in society
They don't pay attention! No!

They don't pay attention

Pay attention before you fall
