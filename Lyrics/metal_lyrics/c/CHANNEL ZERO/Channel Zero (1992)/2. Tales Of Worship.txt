We watch him everyday,
Mister C on Holy channel
His words are blessed and true
Please believe and light your candles
His thoughts will give us strength
And feed our kids and bring us harvest
Just give 'm what you got,
He'll take care of what you all miss

Tales of worship preached on our screen
Proclaiming cleric words of disbelief
Convincing and forsaking to achieve
Tales of workship take hold of us

Our fields are almost wasted,
All the roots are seeking water
The reservoirs are dry,
Everybody's praying harder
Please make it rain for us,
You possess the power of wet skies
Oh, Mister C we beg you
We always trust your legislated lies

Engagement! With virgins! Take you for excursions!
No Love! Salvation! Only for procreation
Armoured in his car, surrounded by guards
Who watch him carefully
He waves and makes a smile,
All he says is "Give me money"

Tales of worship preached on our screen
Proclaiming cleric words of disbelief
Convincing and forsaking to achieve
Tales of workship take hold of us
