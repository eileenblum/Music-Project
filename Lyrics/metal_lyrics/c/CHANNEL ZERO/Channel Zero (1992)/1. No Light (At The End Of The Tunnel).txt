It has shown, there is no hope in countries were black liquid reigns
War, of clowns, who had devised many plans to derange
The vanishing of oil barrels will one day reach
Saturation point, maximum squeeze, individual profits
But never forget, the sand won't yield

The horns announce another stage of alert
Misusing religion is totally absurd
Innocence is so far away
And I still see no light at the end of their tunnel

It's impressive when you see how one man commands this hypnotised fold
It's hard to believe when they are recruiting kids, 10 years old
Isolate the press from betraying,
To conceal the truth from the outside world,
Nevermind just what they say,
The news is hot and therefore they pay

The horns announce another stage of alert
Misusing religion is totally absurd
Innocence is so far away
And I still see no light at the end of their tunnel

Bold as brass, the point of no return
The capture of Kuwait, pipelines burn
Craters in the mind, craters in the ground
Explosions in their memories, without sound

It's carved inside and carved into my brain
It's all paid with blood, don't except the change
My trip is done, for me it's all over
The winner cries, now tell me who's the looser?

One day it's cold, the other warm
There's always wind before the storm
Whirling circle, what's the price
Is peace so boring after a lapse of time?

One day it's cold, the other warm
There's always wind before you see the storm
Burning circle, endless game
Everything returns from where it came
