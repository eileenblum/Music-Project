Sorry, I'm sure we got a real big problem
No need to think, sure you'll accept me
Check it in the lyrics of all bands with a mind
Rapintelligence has a lot of truth behind
That's what I call a cool form of expression
It's never to late to learn a lesson
By selfmockery is how they criticize
And nobody wants to do a sacrifice

I'm not the only one who wants so to interfere in this
Civilisation is not a modern wilderness
Black and White, yellow, red
You'd better watch yourself instead
We all have the same blood in our veins
And the colour will never change

Subways and gangs, the evening fall's
Tresspassing colours of graffiti on the walls
Passport domain you got it all to loose
Bitches, dope and the rest is on the booze
Face to face, they breath on your neck
Your cigarettes and wallet please never come back
Fear us, no police, because sooner or later
We'll make you a cold man, streetgang nature

Painfull jokes painfull jokes
Inability spreads inside they bring the temper down
Hate that grows hate that grows
Submission pays they show that justice's always to late

It's a difficult subject, who provokes who?
Two little innocent cell's they've made you
Native baggage, everybody gets a portion
Ever heard an embryo committing an abortion!
And even if I did, it had no single choice
Your brains, when in a primal state, made a lot of noise
So when you're not so happy about the colour of your skin
You should have talked to your mommy before she let him in

Painfull jokes painfull jokes
Inability spreads inside they bring the temper down
Hate that grows hate that grows
Submission pays they show that justice's always to late

Right now it's a hard way of living
Tomorrow the problems stay

Painfull jokes painfull jokes
Inability spreads inside they bring the temper down
Hate that grows hate that grows
Submission pays they show that justice's always to late
