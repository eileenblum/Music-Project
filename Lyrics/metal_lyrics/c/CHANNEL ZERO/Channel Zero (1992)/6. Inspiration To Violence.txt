Blind force, blind fate
No innocence, deadly hat
This time we're gonna see a fight
You'll who's wrong of who's right
We will walk on the street of the dead
One survivor, no regret
One rush that takes you away
Old forgotten souls have nothing to say

It's me or you
There's nothing left to do
You taught me how to offend
But we'll know who's the master in the end
We will see who's the first on the line
The killing tendencies, winning sign
Hate lives and reaches from the bottom
Time will tell who's loosing his scrotum

Inspiration to violence
Only one will survive
Aggression comes out in silence
The strongest will strive
And in the act of written defiance
It's time to cut the jive
And in the end of all the violence
The looser, swallows his pride

Beat it, break down
Only on my skull fits the crown
My throne, my law, is here to stay
Into the dark, the bad, in my domain
It's raining blood on your face
Come and beg me for my grace
Kneel down and obey as servants
In my kingdom of mental disturbance

Inspiration to violence
Only one will survive
Aggression comes out in silence
The strongest will strive
And in the act of written defiance
It's time to cut the jive
And in the end of all the violence
The looser, swallows his pride

Living and dieing, the law of nature reigns
History gives examples: power stains
The colour of blood, we confront it everyday
Victorious devil's dance without delay

Dead end, expose
Hostility is so damn close
Among the mob you can't escape
the will change you into a formless shape
You can order your coffin in wood
Dangerously living neighbourhood
Big scars engrave your body
Trail of combat upon your enemy

Inspiration to violence
Only one will survive
Aggression comes out in silence
The strongest will strive
And in the act of written defiance
It's time to cut the jive
And in the end of all the violence
The looser, swallows his pride
