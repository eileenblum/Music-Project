first flight, muster up courage
For the jump into the green misery
Twenty years switching over
Is this the reason why I had to be born?
Fight for my land, obey commands
Live and die for my own blood
Tin medals, are made for me
Be there when the chopper comes to take me back

Awakening eyes, watch from the hills
Invisible marksmen shoot like a handy skill
Some friends of mine got hit, I never saw them again
White parachutes swept the fields, My M-16 is now my best friend

Ravished, forced back to the south (South)
Dealing, against my will (Will)
Save me from this hell... I shifted in
Ravished, forced back to the south (South)
Dealing, against my will (Will)
Save me from this hell... I shifted in... to play the hero

No way, I can't get back now
I'm sick from repulsion
Forty men ready to strike
For most of them this will be their last turn
Red lights start to burn
One by one we leave the plane behind
Right now I'm flying here
Was I wrong or did I do the tight thing

Awakening eyes, watch from the hills
Invisible marksmen shoot like a handy skill
I miss my parents truly, can't stop myself from thinking
My nerves are eating me alive, this trip is so frightening
A salty taste reminds me of my girlfriends tears
Now this war has split us, after two years

Ravished, forced back to the south (South)
Dealing, against my will (Will)
Save me from this hell... I shifted in
Ravished, forced back to the south (South)
Dealing, against my will (Will)
Save me from this hell... I shifted in... to play the hero
