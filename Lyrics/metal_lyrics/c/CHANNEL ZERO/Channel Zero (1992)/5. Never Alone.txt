N more has more advantage
No single force ever change
Once you're born life's his prey
There's nothing to derange

Slowly creeping on you
Watch out where you step
As silent as a dark shadow
Never alone until you go

Today's my turn and tomorrow you will burn
I've seen what you are and you will be
What I am, what's left from me

Remember mortal
That this will be your fate in the end
Remember mortal
And think twice because it can strike really fast

Remember me
In eager acceptation
It lies dormant on the wait
Avoid to awake it, don't get trapped
Otherwise it's far too late

Slowly creeping on you
Watch out where you step
As silent as a dark shadow
Never alone until you go

Today's my turn and tomorrow you will burn
I've seen what you are and you will be
What I am, what's left from me

Remember mortal
That this will be your fate in the end
Remember mortal
And think twice because it can strike really fast
I posses your body fast
I control your heartbeat fast
Life's a reproduction of the last
Constant selfdestruction

Some people did, others did not
No commitment to think about
Has no sex, has no shame
It's very common with a universal name
But when it's there, your body know
something similar, cold as ice
All your people, realize
Rich or poor, we all pay the same
We all pay the same price
I'm not telling you lies
