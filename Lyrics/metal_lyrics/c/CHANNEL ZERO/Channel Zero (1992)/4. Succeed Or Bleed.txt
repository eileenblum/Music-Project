Obsession for the seeds of eternity
I've never learned to stop
Seminar steps into the scene of the hierarchy
How can I reach the top

Keep going my friend
Slave till the end
You always hunt for more
Exploring for a grip on immortality
Until the final score

Every night the same ritual
The counting of the sheep succeed or bleed
Never loose faith in yourself
The fire always burns in me

Time is money, never time to procrastinate
I sniff my dollars to heal
Down towns exchange, is short in currency
Into the hard business wheel

Keep going my friend
Slave till the end
You always hunt for more
Exploring for a grip on immortality
Until the final score

Pain, corruption, with blood on my hands
I should have know what I've done
Some family clans keep a sharp eye on me
I guess I'm not supposed to be alive

Facts pursue and hold me over again
1977, that's when it all began...
Blistering thoughts force me survive
Restrained education cuts me like a knife

Informing after and always finding a cover
He can't live without, domination
Every brain for crimes, exceeds the lines
That's where it turns around

Keep going my friend
Slave till the end
You always hunt for more
Exploring for a grip on immortality
Until the final score

Every night the same ritual
The counting of the sheep succeed of bleed
Never loose faith in yourself
The fire always burns in me
