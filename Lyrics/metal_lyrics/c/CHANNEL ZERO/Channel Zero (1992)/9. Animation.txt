I walk alone
My feelings have grown old
It's beginning of the end
Leaving this world behind... behind

Big wall's surround a world
I build up for myself
Ma minds perception of the inside
Segregates into my hell

Animation strokes my dreams
Dreams I can't forget
Restless thoughts of self-destruct
Are walking through my head

Stone cold, drawn in sweat
Can't sleep late at night
All those things that get me down
And keep me close to my demise

Animation strokes my dreams
Dreams I can't forget
Restless thoughts of self-destruct
Are walking through my head

I cry, I cry, cry, cry
Times do change, can't wait, only seeing what I've done
Lost nor found, minds unsound, from the other side of the line
Leave me, and don't ask, now I...
Say goodbye to all my cries an lead myself to higher skies... now...
Releasing myself into a new dimension, it's coming closer...
My soul, it wants to escape, to be released from my body,
To be free, yeah, to be free
My lifeshield was getting weak
I really didn't see the need
Totally conscious and I couldn't stop myself
Rolling down the hill with speed

Animation strokes my dreams
Dreams I can't forget
Restless thoughts of self-destruct
Are walking through my head
Through my head head head head dead head
