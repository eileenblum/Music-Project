The very first time that I saw you
Caressed my mind, attracted my view
It happened in the attic of a friend's party
I stood on the side of the uninitiated
All the others say you really make it
I passed the edge and got myself loaded with gold
Turns me so cold

Prays of gold shine through the rivers of my blood
I touch your skin and you get me fixed up

I'm the tear-away of the neighbourhood, I steal, I infest
I'm hunting for your beauty that separates you from the rest
I admit my addiction, in spite of a code
The season is open and I need to score
I'm after spring tide like a fish on the shore
I crack for the needle that puts me in the mood
With gold
Makes me so cold inside

Prays of gold shine through the rivers of my blood
I touch your skin and you get me fixed up

Panoramic sight sitting in a chair
On top of a mountain making love with the air
Big white whales pass me by
Give me some time to consider

Don't leave 'cos I feel so good
Food for graves, that's for sure
Don't leave, I start feeling cold
You got another thing coming

I crawl on my knees in search for your smell
I want you on top of me, you treat me so well
Got no time to waste and loads of things to taste
Over-dose
