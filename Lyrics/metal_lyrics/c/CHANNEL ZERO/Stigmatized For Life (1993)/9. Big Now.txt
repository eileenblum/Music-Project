Nowadays people have to be confronted
Visually, before they start worrying
About the problems which they refuse to see
As non-existent or overrated newspaper announcements
How many kids aged around 14 know what a condom looks like
Desire scores higher rates than self-protection
I share, this idea must tell, that aids has to be taken
Out of the silence in which it sneaks

Look at you
You're big now
Adolescence conflict
You're big now

Spring time, roll the drums
Their new shoes are ready for the first steps
middle finger in the air
They don't care what's wrong on this big ball
One thing we seem to forget
Were we better in our teens? No!!

You're big now

So we fall and stand up for the struggle of life
We learn the law of body communication
We don't know how to react
And tell me, who did? When they where doing it for the first time

Then be careful where you go
This disease is searching for victims
This brand-new pesticide
is already reigning outrageous
So be, be aware
Play it safe and forsee addiction
You can make love, not war
Don't let it come that far
That Aids is the one who's outliving

Expectations of a certain lifestyle
Do you agree when decisions are taken for you
Married, children, tradition, prove you're big now
Married, children, tradition, and how do you feel now?
So tell me, how do you feel

So we fall and stand up for the struggle of life
We learn the law of body communication
We don't know how to react
And tell me, who did? When they where doing it for the first time

Look at you
You're big now
Adolescence conflict
You're big now
