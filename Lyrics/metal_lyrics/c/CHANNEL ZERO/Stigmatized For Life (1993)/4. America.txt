I was born to conquer
Pushed by the wind and sea
Permission by the kingdom of Spain
Opened soiled doorways to my liberty
And as we sailed we roamed
We were lost and desperate
Until a loud scream from the crow's nest gave us hope

Burst of joy
Reconnaissance
Discovery of an unknown land: America

And I made the first steps
The beginning of a newborn world
I represent the catholic church
Those who preach: "You will not hurt"
And the Holy Book in one hand
In the other a sword
We have to teach those savages a lesson
Remission of sins

Let's go too
Heresy
Straight on to the promised land: America

We came to stay, 1492, was the year it all began
Kill, rape, yes, he wanted 'em all killed and raped
Barbarian It's to show who's
In command and makes the rules
Irresistible slaughter and indulge in dissipation
And he didn't give a damn about them
A hero was born

Solemn is his name within
Solemn in pose
History books offend me
They don't tell

My name is Columbus
I need your scalps
Finally growling and shaking
Get it out
Bleed scream
Bleed for me
Root'em out, weed'em out
Eradicate'em from my land
