Explore to explain
Is it the moon of the acid in the rain?
Like a thousand maniacs running through my bones and brain
Magnetic experience
Maybe a gift of inheritance
It comes and disappears, on a baseless proof

Unleash the dog in you
Unleash the dog in you

Keep the presence of your mind
No panic symptoms, are hard to find
The lock's possessed by you, seek and strike for the key
Submit and be guided
Jump in the cartridge, go and ride it
Shoot yourself away as a heart-beating bullet

Unleash the dog in you
Unleash the dog

I feel the dog come alive
Do you feel the dog inside
I can't help it, it's in me
It pumps me up instinctively
And I feel the urge, the dog's alive tonight
Yes I feel, it's the urge, don't deny it

That's the way it is
I can't deny
It's in the nature of the beast
Animal nature, it's my nature
nature

Cover the beast in me
And if you look you'll never see me
I'm the one who's allways there
but where?
