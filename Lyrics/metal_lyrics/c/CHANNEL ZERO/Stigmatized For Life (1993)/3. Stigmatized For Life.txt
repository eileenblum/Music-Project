Spiders weaving in my brain, get out
Somebody take these webs away, right now

Paradise shines so bright for those living in the dark
Appearances are deceptive, skin pure, but inside it rots

Parental confidence makes it so real
Hate made by hate, annihilation, communicate
You could not communicate as a normal human being
Your attitude proves you're hanging on a string

Paradise shines so bright for those living in the dark
Appearances are deceptive, skin pure, but inside it rots

Spider Webs
Stigmatized for live
I saw regret, and I saw it on your face
And I saw regret, but it was too late

Spider Webs
Stigmatized for live
I saw regret, and I saw it on your face
And I saw regret, but it was too late

Pictures recall, his parish life to me
Pictures recall life, parish mind's decree
Brains to remind, nevermind from where that will be
Brains do remind and some things stay and grow. Yeah...

... And when you call my name
Don't wanna hear, pretend I'm dead or somewhere else
And I want to run but
I'm not ready to walk
To walk
Don't do this to me
