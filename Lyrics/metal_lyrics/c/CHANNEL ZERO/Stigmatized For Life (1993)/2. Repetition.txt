Earth's candle slowly kindles
Has no time to slumber
Spins around, under sun control
One day nature will show of what it's capable
The long distance boomerang is thrown away
Who cares in what our children play?

Burn, burn, we should have known
Learn, learned to control

One Two Three Four Turn in Circles

Repetition: Why don't we realize?
Repetition: We live, the die
Repetition: Regenerate the chain
Repetition: And I wonder where we go?

One One Seventy Five Two
Do You eat out of my hand?

Repetition: Why don't we realize?
Repetition: We live, the die
Repetition: Regenerate the chain
Repetition: And I wonder where we go?

Are you ready
Are you ready to leave
God's ready
I'm ready to leave
To leave the sphere
To leave the sphere
