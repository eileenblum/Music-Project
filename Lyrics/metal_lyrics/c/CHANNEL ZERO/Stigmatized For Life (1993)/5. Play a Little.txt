Objection of the rules, God is so selective
Who says it's time to take, who decides when it's time to give
One thing's straight for me
Don't judge a case without knowing the game
Take a stand for yourself
Don't start fighting for another one's health

Suffer with
Suffer within
Suffer with
Pick on it
Information broadcast
The only matter is, to deal with
Suffer with
Do you admit
Sensational involvement
Actually it's none of your business
And when you think
Don't think too much
And about all your meaning I don't even care
Just play,
Play a little song for me
Play a little song for me

Reflection about facts is not bad when you trace a line
Experiments sound cruel
Decisions rest on the family will

Suffer with
Suffer within
Suffer with
Pick on it
Information broadcast
The only matter is, to deal with
Suffer with
Do you admit
Sensational involvement
Actually it's none of your business
And when you think
Don't think too much
And about all your meaning I don't even care
Just play,
Play a little song for me
Play a little song for me

I need affection and body warmth
Growing artificially
Fed by, Fed by machines

Desoriented, Driven off course
Which way is positive
Why can't they let me go

Suffer with
Just play another song for
Suffer within
For whom?
For me!
