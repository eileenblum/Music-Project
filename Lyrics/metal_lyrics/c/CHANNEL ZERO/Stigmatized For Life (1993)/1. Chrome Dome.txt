Sweet lips often spoke to me
Do you know how people fly?
From that day forth something changed
Don't ask me how it was arranged
My family preyed for heaven's sake
Too late... Drowning in a lake
At the edge of madness you can meet me there

Our house stands open for everyone, all night all day
Chrome dome is what they call it
You can get in but never get away, until it's over for you

Things seems so far and lost
Nothing holds me from my glory
They said I'd never understand
The only thing that keeps me warm
My leather jacket in my closet
I don't need it anymore

Our house stands open for everyone, all night all day
Chrome dome is what they call it
You can get in but never get away, until it's over for you

Please understand, don't wanna lead a vegetable life
Let me go, I'm the man with human wings
You'll see, one day I'll fly, and when I do I'll kiss the sky
You'll see, one day I'll die, and when I do
And when I die, and when I go
I wanna be cremated
So my soul can breathe the air, can stop living in despair

Faces I vaguely recognize
Complete strangers observe me
Now their doctors enter my privacy
They grab my arm and push me down
I keep on trying
Things can't go wrong now
I keep on trying
Sweet sweet dreams

Through the windowpane
I watch the birds play
I'd like to join them but my wings are weak
Living in a mad world

Our house stands open for everyone, all night all day
Chrome dome is what they call it
You can get in but never get away, until it's over for you
