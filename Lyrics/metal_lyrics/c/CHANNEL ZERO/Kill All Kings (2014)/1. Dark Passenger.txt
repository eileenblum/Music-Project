EVIL THOUGHTS I SEE THROUGH YOU
WITH REFLECTIONS OFF YOUR LIFE
WE KEEP IT LOCKED HIDDEN AWAY
HOPE HE WONT COME OUT  TODAY

LOCK THE DOORS MY EVIL SIDE DARK PASSENGER INSIDE
EVIL THOUGHTS CONSUME MY TIME I WANNA LIVE FOREVER

IM ON THE STREETS  WITH EVIL THOUGHTS
WITH DESIRES NO ONE CAN SEE
IM ON MY OWN ALWAYS ALONE
THAT FUCKIN SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME
LOCK THE DOOR MY EVIL SIDE
FIGHTING THIS ALL MY LIFE

I GOT A DARK PASSENGER LOCKED UP DEEP IN A CELL
HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT  HELL
WE KEEP IT LOCKED AWAY PREY HE WONT COME  TODAY
HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT  HELL
IâLL STAY STRONG AND BID FAREWELL

CONSUMED BY TIME THERES NOT MUCH LEFT
I WANNE LIVE FOR EVER
IM ALL ALONE AND ON MY OWN
IM FULL OF FEAR  

MY DARKEST SIDE I HAVE TO HIDE
IT FUCKING SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME

I GOT A DARK PASSENGER LOCKED UP DEEP IN A CELL
HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT  HELL
WE KEEP IT LOCKED AWAY PREY HE WONT COME  TODAY
HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT  HELL
I KILL HIM AND BID FAREWELL

I GOT A DARK PASSENGER LOCKED UP DEEP IN A CELL
HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT  HELL
WE KEEP HIM LOCKED AWAY PREY HE WONT COME  2DAY
HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT HELL
I SAY FUCK YOU GO TO HELL

HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT HELL   
WE ALL HAVE A DARK PASSENGER

I KEEP HIM LOCKED DEEP IN MYSELF
WE ALL HAVE A DARK PASSENGER

HE CALLS IT HOME I CALL IT HELL
HE SCARES THE FUCKIN SHIT OUT OF ME
