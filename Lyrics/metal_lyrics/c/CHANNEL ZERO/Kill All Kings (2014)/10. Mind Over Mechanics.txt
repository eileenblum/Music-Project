YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND MIND OVER MECHANICS
WITH CONTROL I CAN OWN IT ALL MIND OVER MECHANICS
BRAINS COMPUTER INTERFACE
NAVIGATE IN A VIRTUAL WORLD
KILL CONTROL   DEATH AND SILENCE
MIND OVER MECHANICS

IâM LOOKING FORWARD TO  MY DESTINY
IâM BURNING OUT SO FAST INACTIVITY
IâM FIGHTING FOR MY PLACE TO BE 
IâM ALIVE AGAIN 
MIND OVER MECHANICS

SCAN MY BRAINS TRACK THE CODE
INFORMATION OVERLOAD
SUCK MY FEELINGS FROM MY DISK
BE PREPARED  TAKE THE RISK
DIGEST MY TECHNOLOGY

IâM LOOKING FORWARD TO MY DESTINY
IâM BURNING OUT SO FAST INACTIVITY
IâM FIGHTING FOR MY PLACE TO BE 
IâM ALIVE AGAIN 
MIND OVER MECHANICS

IâM LOOKING FORWARD TO MY DESTINY
