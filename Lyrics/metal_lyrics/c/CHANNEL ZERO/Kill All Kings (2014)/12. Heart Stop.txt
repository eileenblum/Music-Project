WE CANâT  BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE NOT HERE NOW
SO MUCH PAIN
IN THIS HEART OF MINE
I SEE YOU SCREAM
AND I DON'T HEAR YOU
I SEE TEARS IN YOUR EYES MY DEAR

MY ANGER IS RAGING
MY SENSES DEGRADING

IT'S ALL SO CLEAR NOW
PUT AWAY YOUR FEAR NOW
AND SOON THIS WILL BE OVER
ANGER IS RAGING
MY SENSES DEGRADING
TIME HAS COME TO LEAD YOU TO THE GATE

MY ANGER IS RAGING
MY SENSES DEGRADING
ANGEL CAN YOU BELIEVE IT NOW THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN US ALL YOU GOT

ANGEL CAN YOU BELIEVE IT NOW THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN US ALL YOU GOT
ANGEL HOW ARE YOU FEELING I KNOW THAT YOU ARE GONNA BE ALRIGHT
