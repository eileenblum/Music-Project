WAKE UP I'M FEELING SO COLD
REACH OUT FOR THE MIRROR OPEN THE DOOR
MY BRAINS BECOME WIRED FOR IMMEDIATE REWARD
I'VE BECOME ADDICTED ELECTRONIC COCAINE
WE REMAIN CAPTURED BY DESIRE
DOPAMINE IS FLOATING THROUGH MY VEINS

I NEED SATISFACTION AND DOPAMINE
IF I'M NOT CONNECTED IN TOUCH WITH THE WORLD
MY IMPULSE AND DESIRE GOES OUT OF CONTROL
I'VE BECOME ADDICTED ELECTRONIC COCAINE

WE REMAIN CAPTURED BY DESIRE
DOPAMINE IS FLOATING THROUGH MY VEINS
ELECTRONIC COCAINE IS TAKEN THE MASSES
OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED TO GLOBAL DOPAMINE

I CAN'T STOP I CAN'T STOP I CAN'T STOP
IT CONTROLS ME
IT HAS TAKEN US ALL BY SURPRISE
I BECOME ADDICTED ELECTRONIC COCAINE

WE REMAIN CAPTURED BY DESIRE
THIS COCAINE IS HARD WIRED
DOPAMINE IS FLOATING THROUGH MY VEINS
ELECTRONIC COCAINE IS TAKEN THE MASSES
OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED TO GLOBAL DOPAMINE

I CAN'T STOP I CAN'T STOP I CAN'T STOP
IT CONTROLS ME
I CAN'T STOP I CAN'T STOP I CAN'T STOP
IT CONTROLS ME
