I AM THE MAN WITH THE PLAN
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU  WERE A FOOL
AND YOU HAVE  HEART OF A LION AND KNOW THAT  
I'M CRAZY TOO       

CONTROL YOUR OWN EXPRESSIONS
AND WHO YOU ARE IâM NOT PERFECT
I REACH FOR THE STARS

DID I FOOL MYSELF ABOUT MYSELF 
OR JUST THIS EGO  
WILL YOU ASK YOURSELF ABOUT YOURSELF
AND JUST LET GO
CONTROL YOUR OWN EXPRESSIONS
AND WHO YOU ARE IâM NOT PERFECT
I REACH FOR THE STARS   
BRING ME TOMORROW
YOU'RE EGO BRINGS ONLY SORROW
BRING ME TOMORROW
YOU'RE EGO BRINGS ONLY SORROW

IâM A FIGHTER
COMPARING TO SOMETHING BIGGER
NOT DILUTING  WHO YOU ARE IâM A FIGHTER
BRING ME TOMORROW
CONTROL YOUR OWN EXPRESSIONS
AND WHO YOU ARE IâM NOT PERFECT
I REACH FOR THE STARS

IâM A FIGHTER 
COMPARING TO SOMETHING BIGGER
NOT DILUTING WHO YOU ARE
IâM A FIGHTER
BRING ME TOMORROW
