SELFISH IDEAS AND FAILURE
OF LEARNING FROM THE PAST
THERE'S A WRECK OF FRUSTRATION
BEHIND THAT SMILING FACE OF MINE

THESE ARE THE NAILS IN MY BURNING COFFIN
THEY  ARE REMINDERS OF MY YOUTHS SUFFERING
IM NOT A MAN OF GOD BUT I'M ON MY KNEES

I SHOULD HAVE NEVER LIVED THIS TRUTH
THESE PILLS DONT WORK ANY MORE
THESE PILLS DONT WORK ANY MORE
THESE ARE THE NAILS IN MY BURNING COFFIN
THEY  ARE REMINDERS OF MY YOUTHS SUFFERING
IM NOT A MAN OF GOD BUT I'M ON MY KNEES

THESE ARE THE NAILS OF MY BURNING COFFIN
THEY  ARE REMINDERS OF MY YOUTHS SUFFERING
IM NOT A MAN OF GOD BUT I'M ON MY KNEES

BROTHERS KEEPER
