Dive into your angel heart
You gotta push it away kick it real hard
But don't let it be
Do whatever you do to feel free
And if they don't understand you
Tell 'em to skip the first part

I drive a cadillac in a fool's parade

Try to convince me and gimme a break
No one who controls no one to destroy or rip it apart
Now I can do whatever I want
With all the reasons you had to bring me down
It was a mistake

I drive a cadillac in a fool's parade

Hang on to the things you believe
Don't let it come over you
And take you over to behave
Strange how it feels to be on my own
Talking to myself enjoying to be alone

I drive a cadillac in a fool's parade

I'm breaking out of my nut case
I try to find my way out of any place
Thank you for helping me and waking me up
Thank you for killing me and bringing me luck
I'm all alone and doing real fine
You had it your way now it's mine
Inside of me I got rid of a rock
I feel stronger now so what the fuck
