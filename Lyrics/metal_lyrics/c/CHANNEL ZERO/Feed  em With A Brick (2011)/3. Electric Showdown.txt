YOU FEED ON THE PEOPLE LIKE A MONSTER THATS STARVING
NO FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES  YOU WALK LIKE A GIANT
YOU'RE  SPEAKING  OF LIGHT   WHILE CASTING DARK SHADOWS
YOU STEPPING ON LIVES LEAVING A TRAIL OF BLOOD
DEATH ROW
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DIM 
YOUR TIME RUNS OUT
DEATH ROW
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DIM
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN

YOU GOTTA AWAY WITH MURDER NOW ITS TIME FOR YOUR JUDGEMENT
LYING THROUGH YOUR BLOOD STAINEND TEETH
BUT YOUR EYES TELL A DIFFERENT STORY
NOW ITS TIME TO MEET YOUR  MAKER MOTHERFUCKER YOURE DYING
WERE TAKING YOUR LIVE  ITS OVER DID YOU THINK WERE GOD

JUST FOR A WALK ON THE  STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN 
YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND
YOU WILL FALL  TO THE SOUTH OF HEAVEN
WHAT WHERE YOU THINKING WERE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND

SHOWDOWN 

DEATH ROW
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DIM 
YOUR TIME RUNS OUT
DEATH ROW
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DIM
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN

I PULL THE SWITCH AND THE LIGHTS WILL DIM
YOU WILL PAY FOR ALL OF YOUR SINS 
YOU WILL FALL  TO THE SOUTH OF HEAVEN
WHAT WHERE YOU THINKING  WERE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND

SHOWDOWN 
DEATH ROW
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DIM 
YOUR TIME RUNS OUT
DEATH ROW
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DIM
ELECTRIC SHOWDOWN
