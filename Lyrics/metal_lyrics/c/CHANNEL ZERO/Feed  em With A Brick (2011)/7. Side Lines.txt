DECEPTIONS MAKE DECISIONS BEFORE I LOOSE
DECEPTIONS IM GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN AGAIN
WHAT IM LOOKING FOR LETS TAKE THIS THROUGH
OPEN THE DOOR STEP INSIDE SEE THE VIEW
DECEPTIONS
IM SITTING ON THE SIDELINES INTERIOR ESCAPE
IM SITTING ON THE SIDELINE ILL DO IT AGAIN
DECEPTIONS AND DREAMS ARE PART OF THE GAME
AS WE ALL GET INVOLVED NO CROWNING NO SHAME
DECEPTIONS TAKE IT THROUGH DECEPTIONS
A PART OF ME A PART OF YOU
IM SITTING ON THE SIDELINES INTERIOR ESCAPE
IM SITTING ON THE SIDELINES
FORCE THE UNKNOWN AS WE DRINK IT UP
SPIT IT OUT
INTERIOR ESCAPE IS WHAT IM LOOKING FOR
MAKING THE DIFFERENCE AND STANDING TALL
MAKING THE DIFFERENCE AND TAKE IT ALL

STEP INSIDE TAKE A LOOK AROUND
AS THE HAMMER FALLS DYING ON THE SIDE LINE NOW
AS THE HAMMER GOES DOWN
