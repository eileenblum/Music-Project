TREMBLE AND SHAKE BOUNDED BY BLOOD
TRAINED TO RESIST FEAR AND LOVE
BLOODSHED EYES NERVES ON THE EDGE
COMFORT'S LOST
CLOSE MY EYES BEFORE I DIE
THE CURTAIN FALLS WE'VE LOST OUR LIVES
NOWHERE TO HIDE IN HERE
I NEED SOME SHELTER

I START TO LOVE THE STRENGHT OF HATE
TREMBLE AND SHAKE BOUNDED BY BLOOD
THE MORE I KILL THE MORE I BREAK
WAR IS HELLWAR IS HELL I'M GOING INSANE
I NEED SOME SHELTER
MACHINES BURSTING OUT BULLETS
BODIES EVERYWHERE
SCREAMING IN FEARS
BODIES EVERYWHERE
WAR IS HELL
MARCHING HATING BODIES EVERYWHERE

PUT ON YOUR MASK CHAOTIC SCENES
SOLDIERS FAITH EXPLODING DREAMS
ALL YOU'VE EVER HAVE IS GONE
START THE FIRE

BROTHERS IN ARMS BURN DOWN THE FRONT
DROPPING BOMBS COME FROM ABOVE
CITIES OF CHAOS STREET IN FLAMES
ARE BURNING DOWN WAR IS HELL
WE NEED SOME SHELTER
MACHINES BURSTING OUT BULLETS
BODIES EVERYWHERE
SCREAMING IN FEARS
BODIES EVERYWHERE WAR IS HELL

SAVE YOUR LOVED ONES UNDEFEATED
LIFE IS NOT FOREVER
THEY'RE THE HEROES UNFORGOTTEN
IN OUR HEARTS FOREVER
UNFORGOTTEN HEROES IN OUR HEARTS
SAVE YOUR LOVED ONES UNDEFEATED
LIFE IS NOT FOREVER
WAR IS HELL
MILITARY CONFLICTS FUELS THE KILL MACHINE
WE'RE COUNTING ALL YOUR CORPSES YOU HAVE LOST CONTROL
TIME FOR REVOLUTION YOU HAVE LOST CONTROL
COUNTING ALL YOUR CORPSES ITS THE KILL THAT FEEDS YOUR BLISS
ETERNAL DEVASTATION TIME FOR REVOLUTION
