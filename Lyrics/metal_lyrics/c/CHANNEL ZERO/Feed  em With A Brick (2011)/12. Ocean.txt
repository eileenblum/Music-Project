I'M DRIFTING FURTHER FROM THE SHORE
SEEMS LIKE I'VE LOST IT ALL BEFORE
YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND
NOW YOU'RE DEAD INSIDE
IT FEEL'S SO STRANGE COS YOUR
READY LAY DOWN AND DIE

I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH ME
IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN ALWAYS RIGHT FOR ME

DROWNING SLOWLY [2x] I JUST WANNA BREATHE

AND IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN
YOU'RE ALWAYS BY MY SIDE
AND IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN
WE SWIM AGAINST THE TIDE
CAUSE I'M AGAINST THE CURRENT
THE FIGHT IS ALWAYS STRONG
AND IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN
YOU'RE NEVER BE ALONE

WAKE UP ON THE SHORE
WAVES CRUSHING ON MY BACK
THINKING TO MYSELF
HOW DID I END UP HERE

I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH ME [2x]

DROWNING SLOWLY I JUST WANNA BREATHE

AND IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN
YOU'RE ALWAYS BY MY SIDE
AND IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN
WE SWIM AGAINST THE TIDE
CAUSE I'M AGAINST THE CURRENT
THE FIGHT IS ALWAYS STRONG
AND IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN
YOU'RE NEVER BE ALONE

I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH ME [2x]
AND IN THIS DEEP BLUE OCEAN YOU'RE NEVER BE ALONE
