DRAGGING CHAINS OF HISTORY
WILL BE CUT FROM ME , EVENTUALLY

THE PROMISE OF MY FUTURE FALLS
MY DEMONS DONT EXIST UNLESS I LET THEM IN

SCARRED TO BE THE ONE THAT LOOKS
IN THE FUTURE MIRROR OF MY FAILURES

THE PROMISE OF MY VENGEANCE FALLS
READY FOR THE SHOCK AT ANY MOMENT
I WANNA TO LOOSE MYSELF IN THE CITY
RUN AWAY FROM MY PAST
TAKE ME WHERE MY DEMONS DONT EXIST
I HAVE TO FIND MYSELF IN THE CITY
RUN AWAY FROM MY PAST
UNDER THE BLOOD RED SKY
CHANCES FADE LIKE SNOW UNDER THE SUN

HOW DO YOU BREAK THE LAW
AND MAKE MISTAKES YOU CAN'T RECOVER

I WANNA TO LOOSE MYSELF IN THE CITY
RUN AWAY FROM MY PAST
TAKE ME WHERE MY DEMONS DONT EXIST
I HAVE TO FIND MYSELF IN THE CITY
RUN AWAY FROM MY PAST
