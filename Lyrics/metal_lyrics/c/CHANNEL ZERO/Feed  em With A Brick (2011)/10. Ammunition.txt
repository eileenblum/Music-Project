YOU BLEED WHEN I FIRE
YOU FALL MY DESIRE

I CANNOT CHANGE MY WAYS
IT'S WORTHLESS CANT YOU SEE
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK
YOUR END IS WHAT IS NEAR

LIBERATION AMMUNITION
LIABILITY CONTROL IT'S THE BLOOD ON YOUR SOUL

IT'S NOTHING TO DENY
YOU'RE PASSING

REVENGE IS MY STYLE
DEFENCE FROM MY RIVALS
ALREADY SEALED YOUR FATE
I SMILE AT WHAT YOU SAY
THE POWER IN MY HANDS
ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES

LIBERATION AMMUNITION
LIABILITY CONTROL IT'S THE BLOOD ON YOUR SOUL

IT'S NOTHING TO DENY
YOU'RE PASSING

GOT AMMUNITION YOU CANT SURVIVE NO WAY
GOT AMMUNITION TO END YOUR LIFE
GOT AMMUNITION YOU CANT SURVIVE NO WAY
GOT AMMUNITION [2x] LIBERATION

[Solo]

LIBERATION AMMUNITION
LIABILITY CONTROL IT'S THE BLOOD ON YOUR SOUL

IT'S NOTHING TO DENY
YOU'RE PASSING

GOT THE AMMUNITION
GOT THE AMMUNITION
AMMUNITION
GOT THE AMMUNITION
