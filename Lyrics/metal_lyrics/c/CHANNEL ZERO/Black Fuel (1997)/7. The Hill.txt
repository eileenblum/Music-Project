I don't mind if my mind
Paranoid hit the light
Feel the pulse living grief
Do I love or do I hate
Separate
In another time another world

I don't know where I go, going up
Going down,
Rolling down the hill, well you will
Rolling down the hill, where we belong

Grease it up, slip it in
Lift me up, take my hand, you gotta understand
In another time another world
I don't know where I go, going up
Going down rolling down the hill
I'm breaking up again to the grind

Can't decide, wrong or right
Warming up seek the heat, while I'm bare feet
In another time another world
I don't know where I go, going up
Going down rolling down the hill
