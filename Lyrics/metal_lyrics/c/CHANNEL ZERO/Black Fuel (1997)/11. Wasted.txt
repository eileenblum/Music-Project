Life's not hopeless there's hope enough to share
The darkness inside us is hidden everywhere
There's somethin' yeah somethin' that I want from you tonight
The devil's alive so be my victim all right

Nobody's wasted after all
Nobody's wasted you gotta speak to your soul

Scared for decisions you bet the wrong horse
You tried to break me by using your force
There's somethin' yeah somethin' I wanna say to you
It's ridiculous to think and act as you do.

Nobody's wasted after all
Nobody's wasted you gotta speak to your soul
Nobody's wasted your losin' control

It's hard to compromise
It's so damn hard to prove the lies
It's hard to compromise when you stand alone in here

How can you fight against the ignorance
Another day is another dance
How can you fight against the ignorance
When you stand alone in here

You gotta keep searching for answers that you need
And when you find them you only have to read
There's somethin' yeah somethin' you don't need me to deny
You always had a chance until the day you died.
