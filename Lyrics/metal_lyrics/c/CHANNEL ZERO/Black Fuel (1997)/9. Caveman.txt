Wake up the sun's arise
Out here it's do or die
Live in the mountain holes
Defend the ground of your territory
Born in the age of stones
Rot away flesh and bones
Intensive self-defence
Nothing is safe when the silence breaks

With the caveman

Worship the fire gods
Hunting for buffalo's
One creature one command
Danger looks at you everywhere
Time has no meaning here
Rituals expose to fear
Chasing the other clans
Burn them out kill 'em all while do you can

It's the caveman

Screams echo all over the hills and the land
I can hear the screams all over the land

It's the caveman don't you know join the caveman.
You gotta stay alive, stay alive, stay alive.
