Little piece by little piece
I trap you down on your knees
Deeper and deeper again
You call on me, you need me

Call on me again, call on me
Anyway you can find do so

Come to me I can take you really high
Imagine if you had wings so you could fly
Heart kicks in your face you're coming down
Listen to scary sound

Innocence makes you blind
Emotionally far behind
Deceptive affective aggressive
But you call you on me, you need me, you call on me

Call on me again, you need me, you call on me
Anyway you can find do so
Come to me I can take you really high
Imagine if you had wings so you could fly
Heart kicks in your face you're coming down
Listen to scary sound

More, I need some more
My mouth's so dry, dry salive
I'm going crazy I want more now
Hard cash blues,
Well you got used to be abused
Well you got used to be refused
There's no excuse no

Come to me I can take you really high
Imagine if you had wings so you could fly
Heart kicks in your face you're coming down
Listen to scary sound.
