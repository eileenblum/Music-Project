I had some news today
I lose control in here
My self control is coming down

I've lost the world today
I slightly fade away
My self control is going down

Ignorance feels the worst
The bad stay, the good go first
All I observe is black for me without a smile

My world falls apart
Reality strikes and hits you real hard
Sometimes reality is killing you without a sound

I'm gonna breakdown my agony
Mastering my self control
So I'll breakdown my agony
Searching for my self control

I heard the news again
I lose control in here
My self control is coming down

I've lost the world today
Slightly fade away
My self control is going down

I need to hold on tight
Mind struggling in my fight
My mind struggles every night since you're gone

I feel so helpless now
I try to catch it somehow
All you ever leave behind are memories to find

Breakdown my agony
Mastering my self control
So I'll breakdown my agony
Searching for my self control

Inside my head it's kinda weird
I try to follow you
I feel the pain it's like a gain
That keeps me going on

I speak to you, communicate
Ask for advice to know
Maybe it's a crazy thought
I know that I will walk alone
