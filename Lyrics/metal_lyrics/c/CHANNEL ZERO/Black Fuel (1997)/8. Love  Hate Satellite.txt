Explosion of dynamite emotional suicide
We'll bring you as close as we can
Universal misery assassination artillery
The camera's are making a scan
Devil in a beauty box moral bitches sucking cocks
Erections are made up for you
Everlasting media to paramountal violence
Competition the financial news

Remote control is eating my soul
Multiple choice bites you overall

It's a love hate satellite

Systematic deviation good belief or false creation
The presets are shifted by rules
Antiquated extradited sexually brutalised
The victims are treated like tools

Remote control is eating my soul
Multiple choice bites you overall

So what if you live for the screen
And you die by the screen
The information highways are overfilled
The frequencies were scanning on
Are drowning in the overcast
Please enjoy while it lasts

And I can't get enough

It's a love hate satellite
Love hate satellite

So now you're aiming for lust
Jack off in the dust
While the neighbours have ears on the wall
We socialize the human race
While sitting in a rusty coach
Please enjoy while it lasts

So now you blow up the sun
The show must go on
Blowing up the bridges that we have built
The aggression we're promoting here
Is giving you a moral blast
Please enjoy while it lasts
