Monday to Sunday gotta play if you could win.
Someday anyway gotta pay for a new begin
I got the cash and the class I got the power to maximise
A little prayer for my saviour you never know when you could win

Put it in, Yeah
Put it in, put it in fast
Put it in, Yeah stake it all out before I lose my...

Aces &amp; numbers they're the key to every game
Jokers &amp; smokers where do they live they have no names
And when I try to escape they track me down again
A little prayer for my saviour you never know when you could win

Put it in, put it in fast
Put it in, Yeah stake it all out before I lose my grasp

Bees to honey I choose the challenge
Playcards attract the user, tell me who's the loser
Did I wake up with it or did I go sleep with it
Maybe God is one and all fiction, what I do have is an addiction

Put it in yeah, put it in fast
Put it in yeah, stake it all out before I lose my grasp

Stranger than strangers I lose my identity
I had it all inside me but I gave it all away
Today is over but tomorrow could be OK
Another prayer for my saviour you never know when you could win

Put it in
You've gotta put it in.
