Ubiquitous, everywhere everyday

Growing, spreading ceaselessly
Nothing is what you thought it was endless

You're cells resigned
Selfish, continuous greed
You were not resigned

Sacrifice your voice to heal
At square zero you restarted again
Divide starting at zero
Undefined inside the unknown
Counter react progress

Nothing is a thing
Ceaselessly spread all throughout everything on this earth
Avoid senescence's death grip
You don't adhere
Permanent in dark

Immortal entity
You're not the one resigned
Consecrate yourself
They will never pay it back to you
Growing, spreading, infest
Divide starting at zero
Undefined forever
Endless forever unknown
Spreading forever out

Nothing is everywhere, every corner
Replace what they thought they had

HeLa
Such a simple world with such a small design
You replicate yourself, do it every time
No you will never die

Restarted at zero
