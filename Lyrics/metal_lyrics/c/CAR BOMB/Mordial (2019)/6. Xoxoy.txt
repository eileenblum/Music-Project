Honest ideas

All stored in its face
It never, it may never, may never be forgiven
It never, it will never
Positive consequence
Stash the blueprints
Underground

In its heart
Turned out from your eyes
Negate everything
The skull separates
From a stuck neck
Stereotype
Honestly it can't help you out
Old

Star
Old star circling, circling, imploding
This honestly got to be nothing
This honestly is all worthless, is all wasted space
Honest

Promised endeavor
Part of the placenta
Honest
Promised
The dead star
You can't afford to redesign
Dreams weighed down
Stand inside of the old star

Staring at the funeral
Wind down the frame from the wall
Time is not in the back door
Set alight the new star
Sit in the frame on the dead walls

Back through the terraform
Say the words "I'm coming home"
Cosmonaut
Do you recognize your home
Disembodies Xs and Os
Skeleton, folding in walls

X O X O X O Y
