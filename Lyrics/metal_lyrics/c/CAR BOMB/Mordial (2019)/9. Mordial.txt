Concentrate on the endless state of your suffering
Days move on as you run the wheel
In the now, never understand the truth always lost
This moment is all that's real
Right now
Break yourself wide open
Let it all decompress
On your way
On your way out
You will see all of it
All of it
You'll see everything connected the same thing
You'll see everything always the same
Present in the pastrate through the looking glass
This is your future
You'll see all of it
Step by step, day by day
Lost in the fray forever
Step by step, day by day
Break yourself wide open
Let it all decompress
On your way
On your way out
You will see all of it
Concentrate on the endless state of your beginning
Always lost in this moment
Forever
