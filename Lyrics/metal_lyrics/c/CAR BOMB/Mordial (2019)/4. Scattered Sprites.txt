Tonight

Ignite the fire
Program and control the roles
Set them up to dismantle perception
Let them see their committed engram
Let them scream it into the night
Separate them so they can see when you descend through the fiery heights
Synchronizing competing decisions
Enslaving both sides
Corrupt

Different sides erase themselves for you
Tonight
Sacrifice
Now nothing is considered sacred
Now nothing will be seen alight
They will all wait for the commandment
They descend through the fiery heights
Post them to their opposing sides
Cut the tethers from the pacifying light
Inside inner minds

Burst in eternal flames
Nine circles (trials)
Ascend through ash until you are new
Nine circles (trials)

Reborn
