Rewind on repeat forever
Save where you stay
Always in the past
Barricade yourself behind that wall
Just stop them at the tower
Constant vertigo
Ready to die
Discriminate the world
Construct a fabricated life to sell
Instruct them to work to death
End it all
It's for their own good
Just stop them at the tower
