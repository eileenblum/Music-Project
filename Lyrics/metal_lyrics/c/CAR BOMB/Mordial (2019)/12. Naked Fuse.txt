Now just listen to yourself
Drowning in pride
Cause the world to cringe
Compliment yourself
Scream for it
They just keep on over analyzing
Seeking approval from all
Control everyone
Never felt a fucking thing
The bad news is on the way
Black dark world
Blackout
Alone in the lighthouse
Battle cry
Not so subtle cringing
Masses die
