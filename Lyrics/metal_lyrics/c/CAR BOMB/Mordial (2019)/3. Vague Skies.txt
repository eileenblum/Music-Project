You walk the giants down to you

Dreams of powerful forms of life
Trap them in the world where you are
The out.
The in.
Life takes that bet you hold the line
Cannot fail, you cannot fail
Secrets strain your back of lies
I'm with you vague skies
Desecrate the burial
Dig it up, dig it up, dig it up
Single file opposition suffocate
In the burst of the cold star
Bury all the desperate
Dig it up, dig it up, dig it up
Pointing out the contradiction, juxtapose
Search in yourself for the last time
I'm with you under vague skies
After the setup
(the setup)
Say these things to feed their lies
The skies don't let up
(don't let up)
Live in sorrow
After the setup (the setup)
Disappear without their eyes
I'm here with you
Vague skies
Dust turns into sand that fills your eyes
As the foundation burns, burns, burns
Fire from your empty hand builds to the light
Burn, burn, burn, burn
All too late
Under vague skies
All of your self burns
Away
Reclaim what's yours
We become from the fire
We become from the fire
We become from the
Fire from your empty hands builds to the light
After the setup (the setup)
Disappear without their eyes
I'm here with you
