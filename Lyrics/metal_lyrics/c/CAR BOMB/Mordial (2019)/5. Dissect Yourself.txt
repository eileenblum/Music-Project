Cut through

Skin a long incision bleeds
Don't move
Let your thoughts infest your brain

It's true pain is truth
Immersed in the now, can't escape
Circumscribed

Seed is sewn inside your skull
Grows inside you
Just focus on the endless null
Now zero
Cut through
Cut through, can't undo
Endless inspection focused in Noumenon
Seed is sewn inside your skull
Grows inside you
Eyes give way to the roots that crawl
Operate
Dissect yourself
Watch how you work
Not in control
What a machine you are
Working un-conscience
Blind observer
Remove all layers of skin
External invert
Glowing inhibition

Waking fearless, defenseless so pure
Now, the perfect prison

Dissect yourself
