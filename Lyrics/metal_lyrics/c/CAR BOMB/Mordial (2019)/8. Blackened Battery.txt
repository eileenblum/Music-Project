You know this can't be real
Playing a role assigned
Question your pre-destination
Wait to see behind
Pull the curtain back
Bad call but you wanted it all for yourself
Free fall
Bad call but you wanted it all
Vengeance
A way out of the maze
But there's no way out
Searching the pre-laid tracks
Want to find your way back
All pre-defined corrections
Correct in the frame
Unreal but you cannot describe what you feel
No choice
It's real and you cannot escape
Bad call but you wanted it all for yourself
Free fall
Bad call but you wanted it all
Right?
This your god?
Break through the boundaries of the design
Break the chains that you put on
Break free
Unreal, you define your god
Reveal this god
A way out of the maze
But there's no way out
