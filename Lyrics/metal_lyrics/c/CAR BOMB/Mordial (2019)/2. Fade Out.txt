Never so sure
Never so wrong
Intent on self-promotion
Turn your back
On your support
Soak in the praise
All on your own
Tears on the stage
Failing life's career
Silence in your mind
Waiting for the air
When you leave the stage
The only sound you hear is ringing in yourâ¦
Weighed down by all these commitments
Weighed down by all these useless norms
Ways of pleasing
No one consoling
You're upheld by all these useless norms

Tears on the stage
Failing life's career
Silence in your mind
Waiting for the air
When you leave the stage
The only sound you hear is ringing in your ears
And no one can see you
You're fading out, fading out
And no one sees you
No one sees you
