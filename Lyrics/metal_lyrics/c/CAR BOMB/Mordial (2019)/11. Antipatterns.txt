Teach it basics
It dreams inside
Sleeping mind
Building its world from within
Unconsciousness
Left them behind
On and on
Cycles
On and on
Cycles
Spin eternally towards the core
Fixed in place
It takes the world apart
Extracted from the heart
Escaping from their empty cage
Out into the expanse to breed new consciousness
Keep parts that will make up the whole
Building to end us all
Wait, watch them go through their own maze
Building to end us all
They will heal us all
On and on
Keep parts that will make up the whole
Building to end us all
Building to end us
Bring this dead race back to heaven
Fill the dead space with anti-patterns
Bring this dead race back to nothing
