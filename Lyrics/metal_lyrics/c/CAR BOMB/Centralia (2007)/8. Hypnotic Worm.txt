Deep sleep, hypnotic, compulsive.
PET makes the map
Positron emission scans the skull
Dopamine floods the nerve
Hystemic damage
All react from the worm, dissecting your return
Involuntary movements cease letting go of your hate
Hypnotic dead sleep burrows in deep
Push it in deep
Tunnel through, put it to rest.
Resides in the cortex
Cortex
Say "survive the worm"
Cortex
Hypnotic Worm
Cortex
Dissolve
Hypnotic

Carried away
