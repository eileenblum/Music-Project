[Japanese bonus track]

Xerox the duplicate take it from the source

Ket-bra base (stop it)
Bra-C-Ket (stop it)
Combine (they can't stop it)
Sai (stop it)
Complex numb (stop it)
Bers (they can't stop it)
I can't stop it
They Xerox off degenerates themselves.

Bated copy comes crawling for the answer

Re-paste
Un-dead ket-bra

Button your lip

Cut your fucking face off
Complexion
Staring at the bracket
Form a single line of projection

Get in line
Single file
Corn rows
A projection of momentum operators

Burst the base of empty bra-ket book


Thanks to jacob for correcting track #1 lyrics.
