Tighten your tie
Let go you bitch
Black nailed Avril
You wear too much makeup

Let's see you real scared with
Drug-addict AIDS patients
Circling your body
White Glory

You look so beautiful crying on TV
How can I help you when you will not see me
I'm your only savior bless me

The bridge tour bus is
Tearing the roof off
The driver is so much
Sadder

Her life is compared to his
Sits on no such crucifix
One thousand white wrist bands can't hold
On to your dim pale hands there is nothing there
You are loosing grip my
Sheltered bitchling

Diaper to cash cow

All on my own

Blonde, turn your long hair to grey.
Burn your money and save.
All pieces of you are holes.
Money will not heal your selfish hungry twat.
