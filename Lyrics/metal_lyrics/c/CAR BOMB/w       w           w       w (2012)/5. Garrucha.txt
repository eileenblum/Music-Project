Dancing to garrucha, strappado
Slave you're lying whore tomorrow she will die
Soft white face staring eyes through the heart
Wait for the call sent from heavenâs dead eclipse
Place this clear secret force in the chest of the dying whore her sorrow will ignite the earth
Led to the firmament silently
Face the crying whore tomorrow she will die in court blind
Blind pale eyes fixed on dead clocks to kill the time blind
Low voices
Secret unsung - the song records the voice closed
Opened doors of the dying source
The point guides off to wait and suffer but they dance the blinded
Judgment seeks their name with hurried vengeance for their life of silence
Approved the judge to the jury
Orphan the plus from the minus
Low voices speak
Brace
Psychopathic slut shuts the mouth sewn shut
About to turn dead
Temper the burn
Ignited in turn to kill dead time
Dead clocks unwind
Capturing death
Frayed light fades slow
Pay the parting cost
Burn slow
All will stand cheering for their own death
Turn around face the crowd
Checking out the final taste you will have in the time that you waste in the firmament
Close out the agonized
Foreshadow everyone cheering for their own death
Sent without fear to be taken out
Eyes uncaring
"Do what they say" ignited the way
Psychopathic slut
