Magic bullets plot your paths
Trajectories move steadily
Spinning projectiles fly not from the Carcano
Cops with rifles stand behind the fence
Letâs put the brain in a trash can
Create a new identity
Eight hundred eighty eight pacified pages cover the curious with a warm blanket of false security
Stay in bed
Close your eyes
Stay asleep
Utopia flies on arcane wings
One more time
United truth with its slight of hand
Tells a story that no one will ever understand
Sewn together with the pieces that were ripped apart
Create a patsy who is going to take the perfect shot
Build a story too complex to ever know the truth
Send the killer to assassinate the living proof
Succumb the population into prison so we learn
To ignite the catalyst that takes so long to burn
Take off, tie off
Empty boxes
Empty loose ends
Fly through, spin right through the brain
Tie off all loose ends make them knot
Lie cheat, cheat and steal, keep them still
Inside enemy supremacy
Destroy the angels arcane wings broke down was up
The reel negates the myth
Itâs a mystery wrapped inside a riddle inside an enigma
