Itâs the freedom of this faith
Green eyes guide her way
So long
This sorrow
Creature of the hollow absent soft victorious
"Close your eyes and you will see"
Cliche lives in me
Swallow
The seconds
The minutes
The hours
The ages
The epoch
The time bomb
Predators in the end
Will give way to the week
Dominating the end
But then what?
Predators will pray
"Burn this house down"
No one cares
Build it up way outside
Destroy the whole thing
Turn inside out, way outside
Build a prison time bomb
Save it for the chorus
