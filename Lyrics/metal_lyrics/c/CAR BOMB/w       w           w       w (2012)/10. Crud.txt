Blinded
It's all within the page
Go on
Failure
Cold heart
My cold world
Close your sleepy eyes shut
Blow the final candle they lit for your funeral
Roses bloom
Just a thing they cannot forget till they burn the ashes of its shimmering light
Forfeit the dead
Corset air
Unzipped dead
Drown in the air
Most things are dead
Talking air
Hunting dead
Fearing the air
Why take this road
Done set go
Why take this road to that path?
Why choose those misleading words?
Don't get up
You build a prison with the same vocal pattern
Pay with your heartache
Lie down
Rise up
Blow out
Get it out now
