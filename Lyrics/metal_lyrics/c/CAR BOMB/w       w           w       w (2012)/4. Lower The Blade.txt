Don't quell her flame if her name lies on the blade
Such a shame
Naked, she cries out the name's frozen caress
Take her outside
Lower the blade
Flame in a maze, silent
Lower the blade
Just say its time
Just say its mine
This can't contain inside, this total complete meltdown
Don't quell the flame
Don't freeze the crime
Sickness inside the face covers the temptress of contentment
Wet wrists quell the thirst of dehydrated lonely saddened whores
Safe the violent thoughts for the last cage entrapment
Just let the fate of what's to come take control of your life's past
