Blind faith, white snake
Smile Archibald
Why kill it all slowly?
Now this is a party
Snake take a breath
Dim the light on the stones in the yard
Kill it all. Kill it, it grows
Push up through the soil
Blush of the skin
Hold on to the serum
Nothing will grow on its own
Those stones will revert
Put her to bed
She wants the cold hands of the dead in star light
Bright white
Who is on you?
Smile if you want her to
Faith bless her mouth wide
This will do the job
Dimming breath
The star arise
Eyes in this face where bright white
Lines on the stones mark the graves of the whitest lights
