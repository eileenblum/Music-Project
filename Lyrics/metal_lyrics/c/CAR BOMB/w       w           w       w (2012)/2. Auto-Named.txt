Soil the empty grave
Pointing inside the auto-name
Blinded by blue light
Eyes, bloodstained closed
Hijack the sun will never be enough
Son signed the paper with a cut
Pliable - Able
Dying and re-started signing your son to his end
Prison-Resin
See through eyes inside the seeing eyes of life
Foul
Creepy smiles all just buried in sand
Rid yourself of all thought
