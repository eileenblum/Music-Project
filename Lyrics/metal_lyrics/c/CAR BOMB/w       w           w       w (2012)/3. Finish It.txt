Dose
Kiss them goodbye
Too sick, violently sick
Hospitalized while in pain
Take it again, this is like torture
They look like sadomasochists wide virgin eyes
I stare, on my own
Down the hall they watch
You stare, on your own
Kiss them goodbye
Eyeâs signaling
"This is too much, Iâm sick of it
Sick of the bullshit"
Hush. Take your medicine
Finish it
