Speak your mind
Spirit of Poison
Jones-town stretches out for sentimental targets to recruit
Blinded as they are experimental methods will be used
To fly blue-bird, fly
Deaf and blind
No one knows nothing
Repeat induced words from sacramental textbooks to reuse
Sirhan acclimates experimental methods to be proved
Hands rise through the crowd for execution
Program complete
MK Ultrabirth
Give them the something to destroy the boy
Turn them into sand, put them in his hands
Donât contradict yourself spirit of poison
Donât contradict yourself boy
No one is what they seem
No one is giving up control
I cantt recognize the mask but the voice is so familiar
They won't give control
Donât fuck up
The boy walks the howling spirit
