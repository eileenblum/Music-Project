Can not divide the wings that pull you apart 
Infinite flight to the nothing past 
The future is not to last 

Take off from planes of gold 
Always look up 
Descend to the bracket of the nothing 

They took out their hearts and loved them all night 

They all flew off from the things that they took from you 
Guided to the finite promise that they ignite in flames 
Take it all then just go fuck off 

Fly 

They took out their hearts which bled out all night 
They took out their hearts and fucked them all night 

Burn off their wings and make them pay the price of pain 
The way they made you crawl and cry to your own infinite sun 

Take back the sum of the divide 
Zero 

Fly 

They took out their hearts and fucked them all night 

Pull of their wings and fly 
Take it back
