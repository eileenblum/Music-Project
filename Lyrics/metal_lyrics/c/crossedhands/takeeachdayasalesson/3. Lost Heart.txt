Like a bird in a cage, trapped in a silver jail.

Far from his home and so alone, there is no place to go...

Like a bottle in the ocean,
Waiting for the shore, to bring me anywhere...
Anywhere...

Heart lost in the open,
In search of something safe... (something safe).

Like a bird in a cage, trapped in a silver jail.
Far from his home and so alone, there is no place to go...
Like a bottle in the ocean,
In search of something safe...
Something safe...
