I don't know what is done tomorrow and I don't know when my time will come.
We all have two lives,
The second begins when you understand
That you have only one life.
Only one life.

Once again, I question me:
What do I choose between vice and virtue?
How do I know if I'm on the right track?

I try to find my way before it's too late.
I cannot look back when it's all over.
I try to find my way before it's too late.
No, I cannot look back when it's all over.

This life is not easy.
Only you can decide your fate.

What's right or wrong?
What's black or white?
All these questions remain unanswered. 

The past attracts me, the present scares me,
'Cause the future is death, 'cause the future is death.

Time goes by and every step brings us closer, closer to the Earth.
Time goes by and every day makes us fight, fight against reality.

The past attracts me, the present scares me,
'Cause the future is death, 'cause the future is death.
