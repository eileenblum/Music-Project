Sometimes I feel weird.
Questioning me constantly, harassed by my thoughts.

Emerging from my dreams I wonder who I am,
And what I become.
When the pendulum swings, I see shadows.
Life's teeming around me,
Loneliness rings at my door.

All my hopes have faded,
My fears are over.
I'm dead inside...

When the pendulum swings, I see shadows.
Life's teeming around me.
Loneliness rings at my door,
I'm dead inside...

The weight of time on my shoulders makes me realize that I'm getting old...
I can't change myself,
No I can't change myself...

Lock me in and throw the key,
Loneliness rings at my door.
Lock me in and throw the key,
Loneliness rings at my door.

I'm dead inside...
