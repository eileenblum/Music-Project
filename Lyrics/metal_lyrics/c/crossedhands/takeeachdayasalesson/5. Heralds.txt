One day, your life can change.
Wake up your soul inside.
Show us your lion heart,
Everything is in your hands.
Bring the fire inside you.

Illuminate the city.
Speak up, we want to hear you.
Spread your voice against the odds.
Only you can change.

Only you can take care of us,
Sometimes, life made you weak.

Become our shelter.
But do not raise the burden... alone.

(Do not raise the burden alone)
(Do not raise the burden alone)

Alone!

Become the messenger.
Help each other to find their way (find their way).
Become the messenger.
Prove to yourself that you are great. (you are great).

You are the herald.
You are the one.
Become the only hand raised.
For your family,
For your friends.
