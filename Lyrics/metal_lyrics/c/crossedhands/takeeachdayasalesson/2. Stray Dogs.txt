This life is a gift, hanged by a thread.
Don't waste your time, clean up your mind,
Unleash your soul inside.
Do what you want ; don't regret what you've made.
Each step is a new beginning,
A new dawn where your dreams came true.

Don't lose yourself,
'Cause we all die alone (we all die alone).

No matter what they think, no matter what they said,
Be proud of you've built, be proud of what you are.

We are all stray dogs (stray dogs) and we are free.
We are all stray dogs (stray dogs) and we are free.

No matter what they think, no matter what they said,
Be proud of you've built and what you want to become.

Don't lose yourself,
'Cause we all... (we all die alone).
Don't lose yourself,
'Cause we all... (we all die alone).

This life is a gift, hanged by a thread.
Don't waste your time, clean up your mind,
Wake up your soul inside.
Do what you want ; don't regret what you've made.
Each step is a new beginning,
A new dawn where your dreams came true.

Don't lose yourself,
'Cause we all die alone (we all die alone).
Don't lose yourself,
'Cause we all... (we all die alone).

This life is a gift, hanged by a thread.
Don't waste your time, clean up your mind,
Wake up your soul inside.
Do what you want ; don't regret what you've made.
Each step is a new beginning,
A new dawn where your dreams came true.
