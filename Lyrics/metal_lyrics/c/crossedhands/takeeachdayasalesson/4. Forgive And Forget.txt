I felt despair, lost in my broken memories.
I felt hatred, taking my wounded heart.
My feelings flow, as my tears down my face.
My tired eyes, looking for something new.

I am not mad at you, and I hope you've made the right choice.
For I would not look back this time,
I swear that I will not be the same anymore.
Forgive...

I buried my heart.
I buried my heart.

Forgive and forget.
