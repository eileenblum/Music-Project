their melody sips
from cracks in the pavement
virulent poison
primal and long

like my poor blind birds
I will never see the sun
no morning
for the sight I've undone

only choruses for midnight
and memories of mornings past

one was of sorrow
shaken with anger
one was a sweet trill
with measures of light
