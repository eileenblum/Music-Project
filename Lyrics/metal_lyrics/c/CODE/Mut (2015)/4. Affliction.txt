Whatever you are
I acknowledge your shade is moving

Potent and cool
Maybe empty
For where there were mars
Now the summer hides uneasy
And whatever you are
Made it so

Dim lights unbury you
Broken words and crumbling stone
Softly loom the night affliction
From a blackened benediction

From the thickening darkness
Soundless
Tyrant-eyed / rejecting light
An uneven crawl of hunger - slow steps of neglected dances
Unremitting flower of shadow
You have called to me in slumber
Stole out from your quiet collection
Latched your veins about my stupor

Dim lights uncover you
Broken words and crumbling stone
Cautious is your circulation
Toxic flux of cruel intention

Whatever you are I acknowledge your sight expanding
And somewhere in the room you are breathing
For where I was lost only you could fill my vision
And whatever you are made it cold
