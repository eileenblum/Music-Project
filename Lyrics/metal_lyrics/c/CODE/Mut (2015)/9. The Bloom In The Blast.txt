come, the atomized
oh, the surge in heat
bring the bright white
that paralyzed colonies
interrupted
a case of infection
all reduction in my perception
I felt the temperature
at my fingertips
sweep a darkened room
clear of malignancies
with pure radiation
in ripples that flow
through my cremation

grow
let me flow with the changes
imperfect glow
a glint in wide spaces
cut loose the lines
and drop into the white
the bloom in the blast
let me fade in

past the silent queues
frozen in the glare
captive characters
lost from a storyline
a hull distended
its bones re-arranging
all out of sequence
and outside intention
clotted air that must fall
in the throatlike molds
calefaction extracts
the redeption code
guant dolls rock
their marrows in vacuum
snap with misery's
dry white grin

on quiet world
over expose
gestures are frantic
like wild snow angels
the narrowing
needlethin shadows
who watch a star explode
