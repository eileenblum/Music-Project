Washed in weeping
Aeons of ashes
Pull a curtain
Across the sky

Cadavers crawling
Like creatures intrigued
Living like fossils
In pools of kerosene

Getting to know well
The geology of hell
Mapping the porous moon-
Leprous dermis of life

Terror and dread
Sick to the teeth
Perish the thought
Die or dream

Set it all ablaze
Set the world in flames
