Devoured heavens that haul the shores of my thought
In the empire of night I'm a victim of an audible heart
The building's nuclear gleam
Cruel houses of lost prayers
In temples of a nervous breakdown

I tread the boards of a dream
I kiss the mouths of dust

Radium
A spiral of human continuum
Radium
Occurs in the alkaline of imagination
Radium

Radium

The corrugated emptiness of magnetic lonely locusts
That catch my breath
Like daydreams of chattering aspens
At an opulent hospice
We'll nurse our hearts
From the fallout of sunsets

Radium
A spiral of human continuum
Radium
Occurs in the alkaline of imagination
Radium

Radium

Sometimes startled by our own darkness
Death has neither an end or a beginning
I must be dreaming, because I need myths and sickness...

A father must feather his followers and feelings...
To manufacture and create nuclear fusion in the minds or radiation therapists

I can't think anymore
I can't dream anymore
I can't love (you) anymore
