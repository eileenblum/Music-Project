Brittle air for blue lungs
Shuttle fare for radiant tongues
Untie your sleeping sores to wake up scratching
Rejecting death reign in a moment of bewilderment

Redeem (redeem)
Demand (demand)
Contort (contort)
Reality (reality)

Basement and backyard skymachine bleachers
A corroded drone is all that is left
Abate my eyes with bear traps and snares
The fear pounds in your chest
Like claustrophobic demons

Brittle air for blue lungs
Shuttle fare for radiant tongues
Untie your sleeping sores to wake up scratching
Rejecting death reign in a moment of bewilderment
And the fear pounds in your chest
Like claustrophobic demons

The mummified trauma of daylight delusions
Dilapidated posture dazzled by filth
Baking soda smile - Jackknife in the passenger seat
Sit back and watch retired ambitions croak

Redeem
Demand

It hits like a kick in the gut
Smashed through the floor
To find (out) what I was looking for
Rusty brain matter floating in rainwater

Redeem (redeem)
Demand (demand)
Contort (contort)
Reality (reality)

Fascination is wearing thin
Hag-ridden abscessed teeth of hope
The wrecking ball toll of crushed coal dreams
Decoding the pearls in the whirlwind
Disposable antidotes as fragmental cutthroats
These plastic superhero suits are starting to choke
Choke choke choke...

Redeem (redeem)
Demand (demand)
Contort (contort)
Reality (reality)
