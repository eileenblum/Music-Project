Street lamps stoop and kiss the street
Cover their eyes in the blazing heat
Turn the night against the sky
Fold it through the moon
The light slides down the reptile tiles
And gently lie

Run you through the streets of night
Run from the sound of laughing
Knock you out and hold you down
I hear brass dogs barking

Break your head against the wall
Strike the night it's blinding
The stars are sharp the moon rotates
It doesn't glide it's grinding

I've wasted time within your mind
Time that I came clean
Show this stallion city buck
And trample my subversion dream

What's it like to shout your name
Ten thousand voices asking?
I try to speak it but I hear
The brass dogs barking near

Down around the back
Stand up pushed down
Backs against the wall
Pushed over pulled back
In the alley taken behind
Like a puck on your back
That turns as you turn
Turning with you
Like an imp on your back
That titters as you turn
Worming into you

Trample city flay your hooves
Call us home
Our city, our city, our city
Our city breeds a twisted creed
Corpuscular creatures seethe

Try to sleep then just be silent
Coast the edge of dreams
I'll curl around you but I hear
The brass dogs barking near
I'll curl around you but I hear
The brass dogs barking near

Trample city flay your hooves
Call us home
Our city, our city, our city

Down around the back
Stand up pushed down
Backs against the wall
Pushed over pulled back
In the alley taken behind
Like a puck on your back
That turns as you turn
Turning with you
Like an imp on your back
That titters as you turn
Worming into you

Tin cans skitter the ground
Mimic the sound
Of brass dogs barking
The brass dogs are barking...
The brass dogs are barking...
