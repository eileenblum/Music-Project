[Lyrics by Kvohst]

Parlour magician
Saw me in half
Pull me from your hat
Break my body, break my back
Drag me through wives, lawns and suburbs
You the great destroyer of my childhood

Like a ship that was lost in a storm
I will lie in my grave and stretch out my arms
I will lay this body down
I will lay this body down

When the evening of judgement has come
When all the stars in the sky come undone
I will lay this body down
I will lay this body down
On the miry road

I hold your light
That bursts the banks
Of the rivers of my limbs
Brain set on fire
In a flavour of the celluloid
You're my odyssey, my glory
My last chance at reality
