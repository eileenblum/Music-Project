[Lyrics by Kvohst]

On a mattress of salt
On a sea of wounds
And only my arms for oars
White-knuckle dream ride
Cling on for dear life
Fare thee well my black-hole bride

My mirage cocoon of horses sail into the sky

It's so strange
What life looks like
When you're falling
Falling
Falling through the cracks

Is there anyone there
On the other side?
Do they know who you are?
Can they bring you back?

And in my deepest darkest dreams
The rattle of black teeth is growing and growing
In the heart of my brain

There's something coming
And it will never leave you behind
It's pulling you and tugging you
Til the light goes out in your eyes

When fate hangs you out
You out to dry
When you're finally coming apart
Then you'll start to know why

And in my deepest darkest dreams
The rattle of black teeth is growing and growing
In the heart of my brain

On a mattress of salt
On a sea of wounds
And only my arms for oars
White-knuckle dream ride
Cling on for dear life
Fare thee well my black-hole bride
