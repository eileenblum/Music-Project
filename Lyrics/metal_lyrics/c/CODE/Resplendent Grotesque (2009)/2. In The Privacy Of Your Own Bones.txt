[Lyrics by Andrew Nicol]

I am bone and I am silence
I am a tongue without a word
I am dust and I am violence
I am never heard

For I am the ghost of should have been
I am the ghost of almost near
I am the ghost of never know
I am never seen

Take my face in place of yours
And through your eyes I shine
Kiss your child goodnight and say
These lips aren't really mine

Oh these lips aren't really mine

I am bone and I am silence
I am a tongue without a word
I am dust and I am violence
I am never heard

For I am the ghost of should have been
I am the ghost of almost near
I am the ghost of never know
I am never seen

Take my face in place of yours
And through your eyes I shine
Kiss your child goodnight and say
These lips aren't really mine

Oh these lips aren't really mine

And should I die
Bring my shadow to me
Roll it up and swallow it
Withdraw my touch from all your hands
Recede and remain
A memory of absence

Through which a null wind unfurls
To disorder your world

And I shall breath in all my words
My fingers return to bone and curl
