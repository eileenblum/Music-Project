[Lyrics by Andrew Nicol]

I am bloodless and cry
My vessel breaks releasing
Ire

My shoulders raise and break
The cradle of the sky

The stars are falling
I am awake and should play
This is the end of days
The end of days
The end of days

My eyes split horizons
The ellipsis my maw
This is a call to war
This is a call to war
A call to war

My shoulders raise and break
The cradle of the sky
The stars cascade
My hands shred moonlight

My voice the joy of the sea

Searing you all with sound
With sound
I grab the earth and shake
The dead from the ground

I bask in light
And infinite vision
I am joy and destructions

Violent collision
