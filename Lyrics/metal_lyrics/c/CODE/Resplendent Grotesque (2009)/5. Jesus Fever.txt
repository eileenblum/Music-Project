[Lyrics by Andrew Nicol]

Is this all, the dark circled
Cracks and the crested eyes
Our deliverance, our deity cries
Watch me, watch me arise
This is the emergence of youth!

I have to break the face
Lift the effervescence and align the sky
Break the rocks and empathy deny
This is the emergence of youth!

Caught locked and brutalised
Thrown down you are the body, I am the mind
You deserve only suffering
I am divine

Here I am truly Scythian, alive
I evolve the world
My destruction belies
The buds of genesis, the fruit, the wine
I break the gables, the column, the vine
I am laughing in the temple of youth!

Jesus fever
Grievous Diva
Mischievous Shiva
Jesus fever
