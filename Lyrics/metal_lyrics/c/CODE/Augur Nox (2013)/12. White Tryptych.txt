[I]

Night limbs lean out to trace those long roots
The many arteries of this forest
And somewhere in its web I can find rest
Feeling entirely all the fractures of this space.

It shines out on hunters in stasis
Frozen in the membrane of night
Rapt under the Moon's cool skin on earth
And charged with purpose

I trap a fragment
An echo strapped in amber
Moth-like and held from home.

You, then, are my reluctant tutor
And through you I interpret the stark lunar stare
The mad visitation

[II]

Savour â fasting guardians of night
A black watch on the heath stilled by low currents
Grace â trickles of scent and heat
Fissures affixed as petrified twine

Bask â vain sepulchral hairs
Whose blossom aches and huddles close
Course â milk-light over hushed hearts
And breath's crystal hung celestial

For you the bellicose thorns wind
Like secret serpents from light
For you the players sway on a stage of alabaster
Clasping their hands
Clasping their hands

[III]

Bold in rich cobalts
From a bottomless well
An amour of ivories
Sutures of spell
Don't fade in my prism
I shall empty your book
And deliver to midnight
The majesty took

Shine!
Flood the fields deranged
Silver-white stain
It seeps to draw the wonder through the web
To teeter at the edge

For your gaze turns the cold stone
And bears a monument out of waste
For your dead walk ingrains Life with Death
And makes marvels of the gradients
