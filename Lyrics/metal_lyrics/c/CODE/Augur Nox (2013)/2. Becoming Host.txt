(Their wings block out the sunlight from my sky)

In shifting I watch the flies gather over this picture like a sheath / Wrap their lips around its secret and deceit
Suck the light from my eyes and burrow beneath my skin / And when it called I let it in
Swallow your soul and cut a hole right into you / They shudder and shake and cut a road
A body that lay like a stone stargazing now / shivers with life of its own
Make me a host / Make me a palace, parasite / Pull out the walls of my world
And build me anew / Build me from your antipathy / Shameless, complete and unfurled
A most becoming host / There's no pain here - a strange salvation to find
All confusion is simply traffic on these wires / Only hunger like a furnace
Only longing in the chaos / Gaps that burn with contemplation
Blister and split with a new infectious greed / A most becoming host
*Swallow your soul / and cut a hole right into you / They shudder and shake and cut a road
A body that lay like a stone stargazing now / shivers with life of its own
Make me a host / Make me a palace parasite / Pull out the walls of my world
And build me anew / Build me from your antipathy / Shameless, complete and unfurled
