Slide / Pale harmonies in drifts / Veils drawn over and / Sleep slunk in slow / Bite / Smile your bridal grief for / The more you weep
The more that seed can grow / / Ash is falling, just like snowflakes floating down / Shells and masks on gentle dreamers under cloud
Peace / Illuminate the faces by the road / I just know / I just know they keep quiet count / -misdemeanors, malice manifold
I just know / Sullen souls / Slumber now, slumber so / Slip away from the fold / From the toll, from the toll
Covered-up in the drift / Covered thunder's murmured roll / Thick with hunger / Distant and lowe / / Unending / The ash is alighting
to gnaw at their seeds under stone / An energy dark and voracious , a summoning under the Moon / I feel them, their focus and sorrow
A study of horror in flight / To worry my wounds with their wisdom / And draw out infusions for night / (Slide comas slow)
Upon the scaffold and the deaf beasts / (Harmonies in cloud) / Over the harrowed and the grime / (Suffering below)
By breaths - a barrow high with harmonies / (Dreamers under shroud) / For the grazing hive / Ash is falling, coma's winter
Cankers' feast of fitful thinkers / Alive, the curtain extends a slip of warning / Of sulphurs brave and intent, / Of sorrows homing
As if the faces can turn out of their moorings / Harmonies in cloud... / Slide comas slow
