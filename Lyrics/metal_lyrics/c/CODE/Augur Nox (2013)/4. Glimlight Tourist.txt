Ciphers unleashing throngs from a blazing throat
Swallows of sulphur, Swallows of Sanctuary's hope

In misted trains arranged
Spores in suspended rain
Course under spells
On predator wings

Blank invocations, Hollow and mute control
Binding the ruptures, Wringing the features strange
How will I mould you? How will I fill your eyes?
Slithers in silver or chiseled from pyrite and lime?

In misted trains arranged
Spores in suspended rain
Course under spells
On predator wings

Paradigm sweepers, Obsidian minds
Scanning the starlight for signs
Hues of dementia blur at their sides
And the boundaries of energy fray and decline
Their strange eyes shine
Fused to another
Palms raised to goad
Wisdom from ether

They form holes between worlds
That I follow with an eagerness
Down the dark slides and passages
Into gloom
Where wide, white pools of reflection
embrocate and charge their bones

Bleach out my memories back to the core
Where knowledge is energy
And magick is a cannibal, animal fire
Reign in the spores
Spoils of my soul
Adhered to worlds below

They form holes between worlds...

Conjure my others under my features
Doused in the river, pure and in pieces
Seek out my brothers, snuff out the candles
All of your emptiness I shall dismantle
