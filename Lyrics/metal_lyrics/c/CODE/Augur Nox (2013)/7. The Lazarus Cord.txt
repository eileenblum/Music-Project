Wading gapers lash &amp; mow / And in flicking pitch / They call from the bottom / Restless arms / Stretching-out
Blindly bat at the scent of the surface / Where a nodding forest draws / Sweet airs from the sky / To weep down upon them
Beneath the crust / Skin like chalk / Features eroded &amp; cracked hulls breaking-up / A sigh / That flies straight like an arrow
To bury itself beyond these halls of mould / Reprieve / Rise a bolt from the strong will / Another clambers onto / The Lazarus Cord
A line like dried skin, pearl &amp; taught / Hangs through the barbs and lips of the shadow / Pressed by wide / Thirsty eyes
Wet with failure and wild with devotion / At its base a brawl of souls / Scrambled structures, flapping and broken
Fallen high / from the cord / Dashed apart on the shards of their fathers / Alone upon that ivory line / A figure climbs the rope
from the rotten heap / Back to life / Out of death / Watched by ancient, toothless and open mouths / Bawling out their crimes to the shadow
Elemental, hoarse and forgotten / Beneath the crust / Skin like chalk / Features eroded and cracked hulls breaking-up / A sigh...

- And the rope reclaims a soul / - To its weave of sinews / Enervating, the dust on their dry fingers / In a slow-formed intimated cascade
Curling smokres step across and, embracing, / Like hunting nerves they scavenge for reason / On the Lazarus Cord
- And the rope reclaims a soul / - To its weave of sinews / Blind husks cling to the cord / leveled, their gaze at the / roots and the damp soil,
lined soft with light gossamer / Beheld from the catacomb / by piercing black diamonds / A glazed and gelid ether
As waters over / Waxen features / Their eyes a glass / In granite seizure / But it's all that matters / It's all that matters now
On the Lazarus Cord
