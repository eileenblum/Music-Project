Impatient ghost / In your wide smile I open / Pale as bone, / Incandescent and starved / A poem up from a field of corrosion
In folds of gold / To burst like a star / Abandon the light / Abandon the skin / Abandon the search for these troubles
I watched for a world that would let it fall in / An order ablaze in the rubble
(Trace of God, Trace of gold) / Imbued with / a reflected light and prose that wound over and over / and / struck out
rain a gilded cage / / Linger ghost / Claw that space with hunger
Cities twist to ash in your hand / I catch fire in a whirl of your verses / Elements unbound / / Abandon the ligh... / Crawl in type
shape / Scratch your song into sound / Burn / Breathe / Ignite the pyres / / Turn your back on the surface you own / Face the sky
Accuser / I will fall on your dreams / Your hand in my world
