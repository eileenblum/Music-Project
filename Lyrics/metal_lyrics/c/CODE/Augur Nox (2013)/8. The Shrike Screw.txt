Briars you sip / You siphon beaty / Speak softly through licks of carmine / Wet your tongues with finite sorrows / Closing horrors
bound into you / Wake / Awake with fascination / living tower / writhing temple / Speak only in hymns of passion
Power, ardor degradation / / Above you / Above you old observances / A murder of admirers / My dust to / flutter into the flow
On breezes, warm breezes / / Ah, the Shrike Screw / / Flakes / Like burrs / With beggar's faces / Bow from horns with pricking fingers
Cast, conducted by the totem / By your bleeding gulping centre / Lights and lures / and breaching bindweed / Wind the opened loam
about you Speak to me your hymns of waning / succor, cruelty / desecration / / Above you / Above you clouds are changing
their faces for you, adoring / I clothe you / I, in dust and clay and the wake enthralled and / Before you / Ah the Shrike Screw
