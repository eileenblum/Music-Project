Death incantation sowing the seeds of discord
Begets ascending etherial(?) will idolization
Terror unveiled is clenching the hearts of mortals stuck on their way -
The apotheosis of the Unholy Emperor's grandeur

Kingdom of dismay awaits on the shores where unfettered spirits belong
Either to be a perpetual torture or an eternal abode
It nourishes powers once to be released to sway
The enduring slumber of ages' cradle will last nevermore

As darkness awakes the hour comes
To honour the Black throne and meet Chimaera's
Gaze that purges soul with tongues of fire, pain and scorn

The kinglike divine of horror founts
Is casting its spell to kindle nocturnal
Flames that sing the siren's song of chosen worshiper's fate

"Under shroud of fog driving light away
Scud across the plains where your fear is blind
Through the spectral vault of Infernal gates
Towards wandering dusk never seen before."

The sacred dwelling of eternal night
Makes withering rays of dawn wear the curse of blight
Innumerable shadows of the blasphemous word
Are quenching infinite thirst of defiance's Lord

As darkness awakes the hour comes
To honour the Black throne and meet Chimaera's
Gaze that purges soul with tongues of fire, pain and scorn

The kinglike divine of horror founts
Is casting its spell to kindle nocturnal
Flames that sing the siren's song of chosen worshiper's fate

"Under shroud of fog driving light away
Scud across the plains where your fear is blind
Through the spectral vault of Infernal gates
Towards wandering dusk never seen before."
