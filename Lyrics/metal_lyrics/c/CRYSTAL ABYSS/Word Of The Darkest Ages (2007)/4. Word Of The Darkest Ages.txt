Seeking knowledge hidden beyond blinding light
Lusting to taste the song of spectral pantheon
Step on the path decorated with pain and laid out with thorns
Find it's end and enter silver gate to hear the name of mine...

My wisdom lies under dust on pages,
Carrying prophecies of the Fallen Pride
My powers are free winds that lust
To unveil the moonless night
From it's pale dress of a compelled bride
By kissing candlelight

My flesh was born by roaring fires
Consuming bones of sageness covered with gore
My blood was created from the tears of tar-blackened skies
Bewailing souls of legends that had withered before
My way lies under speeches of stars
Towards seas of fury, hatred and scorn

My way lies under speeches of stars
Towards seas of fury, hatred and scorn
Ashes of sunrays were covering my road to the far
I dance the nocturnal waltz on sparkling splinters of dawn
Ashes of sunrays were covering my road to the far
I dance the nocturnal waltz on sparkling splinters of dawn

I'm buried under sand trampled by one
Sentenced to be crucified
My confinement is irrigated by blood
Flowing down rough boards of the cross
I was meant to plunge into a slumber
Of pespirate(?) plains, never to wake
I'm spirit of those who tried to sip
My forlorn grace

But seers speak of my forthcoming rise...

Rise to make my vengeance flow
Like rivers through all souls
Bound and shepherded by a bane
For springs of sacred
Pride that rides on widely spread
Black wings of serpent's children
Guarding impassable approaches
To ghostly pages' vault

Flames will be tapestries along the way
Depicting episodes of my
Reign beyond the misty shores of mind
My ascendancy will proclaim
Beginning of new epoch
Ceasing my oblivion for times
All powers will decay
While I'll take possession
Of trembling souls, destinies and lives
My embrace will let
The heralds of my resurrection carry
Powers to embody all my wrath

Seeking knowledge hidden beyond blinding light
Lusting to taste the song of spectral pantheon
Carry my name until flesh is fraternized with Earth
Drowned among centuries I'm word
Where darkest ages mourn...
