In the haughty mountain pass
Where the river's floating by
There was a great fight
But the legend lays in dust...

I saw warriors fighting here
Tinkling of swords in the silent air
And the river was red
Of the bodies lying there

Bloody battle was over at last
Warriors lying as if they've slept
Under the crying wind
Their brothers by sword were waiting in the crypts

Granite rocks were standing in fear
Sky was cloudy and grey like tin
Upon the battlefield
Ravens had thir(?) feast

And the only tower remained
Looking by its black loop holes
As the sun went west
It fell from the edge of the world

In the haughty mountain pass
Where the river's floating by
There was a great fight
But the legend lays in dust...
