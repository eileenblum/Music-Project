Bleeding sundown take's behind
To another side of sky.
Close your eyes and walk inside
To another side of mind.
And I know that you will see -
The place that should not be.
There are clouds and nothing else
You are just flyin'...

I close my eyes,
I turn and run, I want to find
(a) My previous life...
...Where the rain is borning

Sleep is over, sleep is gone,
Leave you be a quiet alone.
You confused when you awaked,
You forgot the way you made.
Through the tears you see the rain,
Through the years you run again.
Still recall your life before -
You go wrong...

I close my eyes,
I turn and run,
I want to find
(a) My previous life...
...Where the rain is borning

I close my eyes,
I turn and run,
I want to find
(a) My previous life...
