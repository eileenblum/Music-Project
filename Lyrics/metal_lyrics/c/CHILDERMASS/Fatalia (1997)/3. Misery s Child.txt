I sorry you, but I got the pain,
Sincerely your dead...
I lost my dream, the hate I feel
Bleeding heart on a cold stone...

What can I do? What can I say?
Pieces of hope I'm trying to save
You are just gone, desolate my soul,
And too late I saw - love just a word!

A Misery's Child
You're tired to be bride
But mercyless fate
Has closed all are gates...

I still recall our life before
I'm waiting for nothing...
Searching everyday the new lust and pain,
You'll never find an exit...

Where is your mind? Where is your pride?
Only ugly smile on your face.
Cursed your soul, forevermore
Now you called again a scarlet whore...

A Misery's Child
You're tired to be bride
But mercyless fate
Has closed all are gates...

Hidden your own love, promise only lies -
Deliverance no more...
Following the life in a dogy style,
Following to none...
