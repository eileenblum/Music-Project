I love you,
My mother Earth,
I love you,
In a mist...

Your tears are black,
It crashes my mind.
You can't forgive (the)
Your bastard's tribe...

I see a dead sun in the sky
I see the acid in your eyes
Infected rain become's
your tears
Your revenge is so real!

Nobody's laughing at the end
We're the twisting shadow on the sand
Can you forgive us mother Earth,
If you never will rebirth?..

...Bring out your dead.
