Iâve fallen, lower than the depths of misery
I wallow in the sorrow of my own afflictions
Resentment my only release

Lost in a corridor of trees and all while the world is at sleep
An abundance of atrocities through a cascade of my broken dreams
Now hear my soliloquy, itâs a sombre tale of my dismay
Of how the last tear was cried for romance

Shall the flowers bloom when the earth collides with the sun
And all the fruits of once barren land flourish with splendor

Lost in a corridor of trees and all while the world is at sleep
An abundance of atrocities through a cascade of my broken dreams
Now hear my soliloquy, itâs a sombre tale of my dismay
Of how the last tear was cried for romance
