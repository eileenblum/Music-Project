Destiny or predetermined fate?
Travesty or parody gone stale?
Parody paradigm, parody paradigm

I watch with sadness, as I see you crawl
Back to those who never even fucking cared
Youâre on your hands and knees
Being used by them time and time again
The hollow, shallow, self-serving distraction
That you call living
Oh parody paradigm

Clarity, youâre dying inside
Self discovery, freedom you design
Parody paradigm, parody paradigm
