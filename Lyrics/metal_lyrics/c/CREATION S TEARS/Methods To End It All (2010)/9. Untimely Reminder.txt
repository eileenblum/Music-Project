Worldâs colliding, path subsiding, all so empty, Iâm lost in me

Iâve seen whatâs gone before this, I donât seem to learn
To live again, and again, untimely reminder

Loss is chilling, mindâs unwilling, functions numbing, Iâm lost in me

Iâve seen whatâs gone before this, I donât seem to learn
To live again, and again, untimely reminder
