When I assume this state of mind
My lustful quest for happiness
Is it any wonder that I fail?
Fail!

When I assume this point of view
I find it hard to see things through
Is it any wonder that I fail?
Fail!

It's like history repeats itself
For years now I wander lost
Tell me pain can't last forever
Fail!
