[feat. Sarah Jezebel Deva][Lyrics by Brian Eddie Reynolds]

Eyes open to life s isolation
Creation s tears echo in the silence
The forgotten sun lies dormant beyond the skies
But still this beauty rapes the mind

The naked truth exposed
As I gasp for breath
Drowned by life s sorrows
And the rivers of life overflow

Mind awakens to life s possibility
But dream stealers suppress vitality
The cup of life if full, but you re choking on apathy
Greatness can prevail from the midst of catastrophe
