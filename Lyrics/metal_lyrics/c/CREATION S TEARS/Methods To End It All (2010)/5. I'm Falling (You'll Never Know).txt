When standing by the light, it always seems to fail me
Or am I just weak from the things Iâve come to know
Forever content with the things I can control
Iâm sorry children, how youâll never know, know

Iâm falling...

Or am I just weak from the things Iâve come to know
Forever content with the things I can control
Iâm sorry children, how youâll never know, know

Iâm falling...
