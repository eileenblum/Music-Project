Here it comes again
Another collision
Life changing decision
Why can't you see
The magnitude
Of what it's doing to me
You're taking it lightly

Here it comes again
Another collision
Life changing decision
Why can't you see
The magnitude
Of what it's doing to me
You're taking it lightly
Self imploding
Sores exposing
Sometimes Weakness
Sometimes Strength
Scars Corroding
Grip's withholding
Sabotaging all that's been

Here it comes again
Another collision
Life changing decision
Why can't you see
The magnitude
Of what it's doing to me
You're taking it lightly
Don't look back now
Keep your focus
Best foot forward
Show me strength
Things look clearer
In the rear-view mirror
Sanitizing
All that's been
