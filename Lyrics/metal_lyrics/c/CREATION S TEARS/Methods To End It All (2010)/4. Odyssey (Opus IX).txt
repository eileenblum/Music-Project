Only oceans are between us
And it is through you that I believe I could live again
And if I should pass I will rest in your ocean
For these are the waters that once drowned me

Where is the light in my lonely existence?
I brave the dark and the waters bleak
For Iâve seen your image in the mindâs eye,
Fear is alluring but pain is no temptress.

Thereâs no point in coming crawling
The mighty temptress has fallen
Thereâs no point, no point, no point in coming crawling
