Take a look at the suffering
We have brought to this finite world

Men will do as they please
Nothing, no-one will appease this stark annexation

Oh, the ending time when we cross the line
Cover the world with darkness
Cover the world with mankind's progress

Since the day that we first stepped onto this earth
A thought inside our minds
Has led us to this day

Crossing social boundaries
Crossing autonomies
The will to conquer seems
To always conquer us

[Chorus:]
Fate will show that we are nothing more
Than a plague to all
Than a virus leeching
We are dammed with this desire strain
We can't change our pain
Chasing lives of plenty
Bequeath the carnal thirst

The road to tomorrow is jammed by what was yesterday
Built in to our genome, the urge to conquer everything
The forests are burning, the forests are burning away
And we are the cause, we're our own enemy

Manipulating my wants into necessities
Consuming the crime

As mankind fades into dust, failed memories turn to rust
The children lost their way

[Chorus]
