When the blood begins to flow
You face just what matters most
Appreciating every breath
Only now that you have been so close to death

Green is on the other side
Countdown to a brand new life
Time to face reality
What I want or what i really need?

[Chorus:]
Who said we were ever really alive?
Lied, we're dead until we bleed

Life is just a one man show
Pierce skin to let the pleasure flow
Vision of a child
See the world through your brand new eyes

Through your brand new eyes

My fate is tied to you,
My break it falls with you
Take time, review, revise, decide
Shall we survive?

Take the pain, break the wound
Bid farewell, time to fall
Now unchained, release the soul

As you face another day
Celebrate as others fade away
Pillars of light will pierce your sky
Through my eyes the world is just a shade of grey

Leaving the torment behind
Fortune so impertinent
Forget this reality
A real world replaced with fantasy

[Chorus x3]
