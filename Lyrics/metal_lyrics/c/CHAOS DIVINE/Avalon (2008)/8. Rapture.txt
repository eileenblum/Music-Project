Necessary destruction
Your cause has no point
Unless thy will is done

Doomsday cult
Electing to end the world
Prophecy misread

Rebuild the temple of Solomon
Whatever it takes the end must come

Doomsday cult
Electing to end the world
Prophecy
Misread

[Chorus:]
Sweet pure child your father said
It's the end now
Take no chances, plant the seed
At the gates we'll meet

Rising through the U.N
A false prophet of peace
We cannot trust them
No, our Bible tells us this

Looking to others for any signs of deceit
While revealing in your right hand
Is the mark of the beast

Self-fulfilling prophecy
We become what we believe
Welcome to the end of time
We will never die

Believe in the rapture

Weeping widows, dead children
Blood stained soil but I don't see him come

[Chorus]
