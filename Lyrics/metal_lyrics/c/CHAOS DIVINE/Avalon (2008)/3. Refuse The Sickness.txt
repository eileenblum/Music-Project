Your mental state, a fantasy
The wheel that breaks is within your mind
Susceptible to lose control
If you lose your mind
Have you lost your soul?

Fate of your life, so insecure
Fate determined by chemicals

[Chorus:]
Refuse the sickness
Overcoming
You and me, we will cry
For the process has gone awry
And the fallout is pain

Suffer the pain
Swallow this change
Suffer the pain
Resent your mind

Serotonin concentrations dropping
The synaptic dysfunction distorts the realisation
That we're engaging a mood swing alternation
Faces of loved ones transform to enemies
Now witness your moral depreciation
Forget about your cerebral limitation
A slave to the neurotransmitter malfunction
Condemning yourself to this personality destruction

Mechanical loss of control
Within the mind will take its toll

[Chorus]
