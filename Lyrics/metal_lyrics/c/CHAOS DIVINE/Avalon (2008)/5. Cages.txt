Wait for the answers to come
The last piece of the puzzle will bring you closure
Take all the time that you need
Fate is smiling on you, don't be afraid

We let the time pass us by
Seconds closer to the day that we will die
Fate is but a false, fickle dream
Unwavering equanimity

People in cages
Imprisoned for dreaming
People in cages
Lost visions of greatness [x2]

Fear is the key to the lock only built to enslave us
Consequences forbid you from living your life
Breaking the boundaries of all that we're forced to believe in
Calm yourself now before you commit to the crime

People in cages [x3]
People encaged
