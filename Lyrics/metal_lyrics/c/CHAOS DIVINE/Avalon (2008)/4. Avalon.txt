When the world was young
We came undone
And lost a place so close to heaven

Pure tranquillity
Like falling leaves
It's certain to become a memory

Gone was the beauty
In the eyes of eve
For soon she'll be discarded

Scream into the wind
The earth below me is breaking
Could it be a sin?
I'm torn away from
