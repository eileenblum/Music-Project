Accountability is not something you believe in
What will the future be?
What it holds you cannot see
Your eyes have been blinded by the falseness of bureaucracy
As there is no more time,
Our fate is now irrefutable

[Chorus:]
Can't we see what we're destroying?
Blinded by conceit
The tides will turn
The winds will change
We'll suffocate in Gaia's pain

You cannot run and hide
Shelter for you has been denied
Excruciating cries
We face the deletion of mankind

As our world ceases turning
Prophesies but were still learning
All is fine in our delusion

[Chorus x2]
