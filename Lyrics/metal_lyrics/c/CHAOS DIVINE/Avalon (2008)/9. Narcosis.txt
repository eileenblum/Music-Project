Why can't we speak aloud?
Raise your fists into the sky and shout it now
Show your priorities
Tie my lips together now you know I see
Create atomic designs
Justified for those who lie but for us a crime

[Chorus:]
This world is numb for your disdain
We will fail
Why do you seem so fine when all but hope is gone?
Free yourself with apathy

How can we still not care?
Individuality it's now a stare
Density, feel it grow
Skin so thick no purity will now break through
Alienate your mind
Total global media, resulting dissent

[Chorus]

Detachment of your sense
Unconscious state of bliss
Intellect to defect
This reject, anaesthesia

Shout it now

Your narcotic state
Leaves us in a wasted land
Disregard for politics
Though you understand

Indifference for humanity
Now consume a brand
No more time for audacity
Draconian

[Chorus]
