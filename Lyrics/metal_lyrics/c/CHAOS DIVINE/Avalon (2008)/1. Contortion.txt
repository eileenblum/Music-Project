A child of this world
Living life without anxiety

For we are burning now

Our time is fading
Molecules replaced and rearranging

For we are turning the page backwards
Yearning for the dreams of yesterday

[Chorus:]
We chase the past at the cost of the present
And lose what is here
This sentimental dream is our master
Nostalgia replacing truth

Contort yourself
Contort yourself to false infancy

For we are burning now

You fixate on pipedreams
You become a slave to absurdity

For we are turning the page backwards
Yearning for the dreams of yesterday

[Chorus]

Return to your youth

[Chorus]

Return to your youth
