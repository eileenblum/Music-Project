Punishing internally
For the pain, but won't it won't go away
Loosing your integrity
Become a slave, as the world decays
Let it be known
The flesh and the bone
Will not survive
This deflowering
Antagonistic
Unsympathetic
I will take you by the hand
Decontaminate
You must free yourself
Time to liberate
You Must Decontaminate
You Must Free Yourself of hate
You must emancipate
