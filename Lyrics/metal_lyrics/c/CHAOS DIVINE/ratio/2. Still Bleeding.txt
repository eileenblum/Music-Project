Once upon a time I thought that
I had, all the answers
And it seemed that you were
The answer to them all

Falling deeper into darkness
I can't see the light
What was once I wished for
Now is what makes me cry

Bleeding, why won't I stop bleeding?
For you, I would have done almost anything
But I can't hold onto this
Now its time to say goodbye

Frustrations build inside
But I can't let you know
The thought of hurting you
Is hurting me

I don't want to suffer
But all I do is suffer

Bleeding, why won't I stop bleeding?
For you, I would have done almost anything
But I can't hold onto this
Now its time to say goodbye
