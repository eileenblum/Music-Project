Look, Up above
In the sky, what do you see?
They are taking us
In the night, Far away
Don't try to hide
You can't escape their gaze
We would not believe it
We would not believe their lies
We saw the truth
But a truth we could not recognise
Behind, The light
Is a man, or is he not
These, Obsidian eyes
Are the last Thing that we'll see
We would not believe it
We would not believe their lies
We saw the truth
But a truth we could not recognise
Clandestine agencies undermining
The blue book was to disprove
Now we face the end
These far fetched tails have come true
We would not believe it
We would not believe their lies
We saw the truth
But a truth we could not recognise
