Denied anodyne again
I ask myself the question
Why won't the lights fall?
Why won't the darkness come for me?

Reliving the day in my head
Starlight seems to scorch my skin
Cabin fever from my bed
As I burn the candle, at both ends

I'm opening wounds that healed long ago
I reignite hatred that had been resolved

I want to forget
My memories
I want to forget
Set my mind free
Wipe the slate clean
Of my memories
