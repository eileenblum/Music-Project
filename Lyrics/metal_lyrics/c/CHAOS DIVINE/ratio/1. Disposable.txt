Born into this world, trapped in a body
A carcass of a shell
And on the eighth day of this life
He will be butchered
A father wanting to become righteous
Willing to do anything
Countdown to the time of confirmation
Devotion verified
Now he's taken to the land of Moriah
To become a sacrifice
Here the stage is set, the time has come
To kill the only son
This life is so pointless
We are all expendable
Forsaken by the father
Graciously disposable
See the eyes of the lamb at the slaughter
See the eyes, see the eyes
Hear the cries of the boy's father
Hear the cries, hear the cries

Now I feel betrayed
By my flesh and blood
You were so willing
To use me, to kill me
Use me
Kill me
