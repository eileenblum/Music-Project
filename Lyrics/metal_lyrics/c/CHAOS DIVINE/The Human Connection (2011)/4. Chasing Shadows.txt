Claustrophobia impending
Theyâd see through this disguise
Symbols turn and run in horror
To ridicule the eyes
Undivided concentration
It fails to bring the gains
Taunted by your own impairment
The will begins to bend

Hold on, be strong, the end will surely come when the world will cease this fallacy

Raise your head above the water
To be pushed down again
Drowning in the constant torment
Of those you thought were friends
Destiny is what awaits thee
Who pushes harder still
Fight the fear of total failure
Theyâll never break the will

This defect is a gift
Turn resentment to up lift
The wind is changing
Surrender the disguise
Look past your own demise
The wind is must change

And young child, donât walk away from your dreams
And young child, it's not as bad as it seems
Sticks and stones will break your bones, but
Only you can hurt you
As you crawl inside your shell you hide
Licking your wounds in the cover of the shadows, you renew

Desensitise your fragile mind, fortify the essence of your insides, calcified
Now you crawl out of the shadows
To face those that paint with scorn
They would hold you
If they could bear to wrap their arms around this aberration
Their repugnance shining clearly through

Hands are shaking
A mind of their own who you cannot disown
Unstoppable, out of control,never will you tame
