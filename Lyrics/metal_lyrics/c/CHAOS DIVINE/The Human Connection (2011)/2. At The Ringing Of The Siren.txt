I see how you live
Youâre so positive
In your purpose, your being
While I walk alone
Lost in the unknown
With nothing to hold onto

I canât help it
I canât stop it
This constant questioning
Now Iâm getting tired

Are we reborn?
Does life go on?
Does this life go on?

Faith now fading for you
So please renew

Evidence, you forgot to mention,
Must exist If we are not to question
This devotion
2000 years, on and on and counting
Falling tears, these questions still are mounting
Why are we here?

Proclaim, insist
The reason we exist
Then leave us with no reason

The book I hold
The stories that are told
Cannot refute the sceptic

So I call your name
Iâm questioning these claims
Please give me your rebuttal

Does life go on?
When the bodies gone
At the ringing of the siren

Hear the ringing of the siren
