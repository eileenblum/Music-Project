Forward, it takes us backwards

Beneath these misleading eyes
The instinct lies, the instinct you must deny
With only yourself to blame
The circle's broke
The circle's broken

Thrive, in the corporate heat
More than just stupid a piece of meat

Check your destination
Conforms to the equation

Falling to pieces
Your own lineage
Why canât you feel the
Need to break into this world

Invert evolution
Revert this constitution
Invert evolution
Humanity decaying

Life, has become a question
Have we lost the human connection?

IQs now decay
Social disarray
Corporate fallacy
Leads us to our own demise

Breed lunacy
Breed out sanity
Dystopia awaits
A dysgenic prophecy
