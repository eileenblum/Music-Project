You should know
That it is not my intention

To leave you alone
But if you stay itâs under false pretences

The faces that come
The faces are blackened in me

Look to my past
Into your future you will see

Nothing can last
So close to perfect I must leave

The faces that come
The faces are blackened in me

Now I donât know where Iâm going
But I know that I canât stay
As I pray upon your ashes
Wonât someone please save me

From my own hands
Whenâs this rescue gonna come?
Can they stop me
From destroying all that I love?

It wasnât fair
But that was not what I intended

I had a duty of care
And I let down those expectations

The faces that come
The faces are blackened in me

In familiar waters
Lusting storm is blowing over
Searching for sanctity
Bound to walk this beaten path

Molded by fate
Now cursed that I must plunder

Is it too late
To break the spell that Iâve been under?

The faces that come
The faces are blackened in me
