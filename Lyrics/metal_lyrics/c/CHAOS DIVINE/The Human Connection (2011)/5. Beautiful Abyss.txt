Disturbed by the impurity
Itâs the scar of this masquerade
Thereâll be no more insecurities
Once you pass through this doorway

But you knew more
Your soulâs paid for
This endless fight
Rewarded by delight

You were incarcerated
Within these walls blockaded

Stuck on this meteorite
Caught in this wicked wild fight

The fumes intoxicating
The smell of sin unfading

A soul restricted by this
Impure enclosure of flesh and bone

But you knew more
Your soulâs paid for
This endless fight
Rewarded by delight

Out of darkness through this night
Bathe in the oncoming light, you will
Hear no evil, fear no more
Rejoice you are home

Donât wait at the waterâs edge
Itâs time to step into the unknown blue

As time moves along
We forgot that we belong to something bigger

To know what is and what will be
To see with more than sensory
The song youâll sing is certainty
This journey begins

Move into the mist
This beautiful abyss it liberates you

Now a part of the ethereal, the celestial array
Born again in beauty impeccable
These wonders will never fade

Transcend
