We were one and the same
The blood that once passed through your veins
Now flows in mine

I need someone to blame
Who decided to end this game?
Itâs much too early right now

As I call out to you
Iâm not sure if you are receiving
Can you hear me?

It should never be true
This void that I can not break through
A heart divided in two

So I writhe through this night, gazing upwards at vacant skies
And itâs too much now, I canât face this anymore
But thereâs no escaping, thereâs only one door

They say this pain will surely fade
In time it goes away
But nothing seems to change
This aching still remains
No bridge onto your side
I must wait until I die

And I'll think of you from dusk 'til dawn
I'll hold my breath from night to morn
And Iâll call upon our last embrace
Tide me over until I see your face again

Will the world explode before I hold your hand
Will my tears bring lakes to this desert sand
And I donât know if I can be the man
That I knew, that you were
