Been here before, or have I?, cannot recall

Been here before, but I canât, see what Iâm looking for
Thereâs nothing left only memories remain

And until the end, Iâll search for my home

Progress haunts my dreams
And I canât stop this enemy
Forever stalking me

And to the world Iâd known, I bid farewell

I am homesick, while at home
And Iâve got nowhere else to go
I reminisce of the last time
That I stood on this sacred ground

Misplaced myself but Iâm still here
Never thought that I would fear
Losing my homeland
Iâve lost my sacred ground

Desperate, clutching straws
Distant, at arms throw
Canât face the new world Iâve come to
Rejecting what is before my eyes

Memories, lost and sold
Deface times of old
I reminisce of the past life
No compensation can compensate me for what
I have lost. I have lost

Grave mound, connections are fragmented
To my own ground

This wound, created for your welfare
Now left unbound

Tear it all down
No you canât buy this ground
Hold fast, face down
This canât be undone

This world goes to, the highest bidder
We can only loose, while they desecrate

Victim of our lust
No-one we can trust
Were all longing for fortune?
But somebodyâs got to pay

Nomad donât belong
Aimlessly I run
Never return to my past life
A vagabond born by solastalgia
I am lost, I am lost

Have I been here, before?
And Iâll be here, nevermore
