No more identity
No more desire
Now weak from dormancy
This heart's lost its fire

So my incentive died
So Iâm demoralised
Asleep behind waking eyes
Fading into comatose

Falling through the astral plane
Lost in purgatory
Flailing wings of disdain
Condemn me so I cannot fly
Falling through the astral plane
Never hear a scream
Thereâs no waking time in this astral plane

I canât, hear you
I canât, see you
I canât, feel you
I canât, break through
I donât, know how
I might, fall down
I sense, rain clouds
So I wonât try

No expectations
No way to defeat
Past procrastination
Now please conquer me

Itâs barely survival
This futility
Leave me in the gutter
Beyond the will to compete

This lethargy is calling you to come in from the light
Never thought to disappoint it

Pay the price for worshipping these walls that shield you from outside
Agoraphobia anointed

Blame my lamenting mind
Blame my folly insides
This body now atrophied
In everlasting comatose
