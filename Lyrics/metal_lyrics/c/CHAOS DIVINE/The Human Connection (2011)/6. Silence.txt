Fortified from the cries
No need to apologise
We all know that youâll be sleeping well tonight

Hard as stone down to the bone
A face of you fear you canât condone
Emotions now objectified

A friendship sewn but now itâs gone
Lesson learnt Iâll walk alone
This trust in you was so misplaced

When sympathy is gone
Were left to fend alone
The sympathy society once relied upon
Donât empathise today
Or youâll labelled as a slave to heart
Donât be ashamed
Be devoid of caring

Now Iâm aware, nothing is important anymore, but time

I fear
The chances of us breaking through this
Silence
Are close to less than none

And since the day we're born
We're forced to live a life so cold
It's not alright
It's not okay
That our humanity
Is all dehumanised
