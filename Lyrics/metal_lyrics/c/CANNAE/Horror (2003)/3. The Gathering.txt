Today is the day to throw
Away what's left inside
Gather all the things that
The things that still preside
We have to choose our sides though
Though we never split
It's an equal division of mind and spirit
Welcome this world pulls us together

Our mortality is not afraid
Slap us in the face
To rip us down
To put us in our place

Not a day goes by
We don't think of you
We remember things we used to do
Our life is short
So it won't be long
But until then we must remain strong

Since the time that you've been gone
Always felt you here
You're in every one of us
We know you'll always be here
An equal division of mind and spirit
