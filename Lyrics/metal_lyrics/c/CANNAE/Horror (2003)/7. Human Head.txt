Standing with a slight slant
The head seemed to be just right
Collared shirt and neck tie presentable to who

A smile stretched across his face
With puppet strings holding each side up
My head fills with images of old horror films

Creatures told me to severed limbs
On top of me headless torsos
Demon light tones tip toe around
My comatose body
Disturbing tremors
Creep underneath my skin
Just remember the narrators there for advise
My eyes burn from the salt that was put there
Burnt my comatose my eyes now burn
Burn from the salt
