Tomorrow is here
Damned by the speed of time
Imagine when becomes where did it go
Mindless people
They shake hands and smile
I should introduce myself with a slap

A nation of a million fools
Programmed by the media's mainline

Logic and reason
How does it escape your thoughts
Half the truth enveloped in lies
Face life with a vengeance
Shattered by an instant death
A bloody end to a hopeless life

A nation of a million fools
Programmed by the media's mainline

And then a chilling thought to the point of madness
Left in a grip of terror
Left to try recapture myself
With a gun to my head
In a grip of paranoia with a gun to my head
My spirit stands alone in a room
A bloody end to a hopeless life
