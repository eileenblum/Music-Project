One out of a million, they don't see me. I am to this world as a raindrop is 
to your forehead. Suppressed only by myself. I need to let me out, out of the 
sky falling. Time and mind seperated only by night and day. They all seem the 
same to me, no matter what anyone might say, I will never what I want, 
"free", like addiction I must come back to this. Endless loops of creativity, 
creatively sitting alone.
