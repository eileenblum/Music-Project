Troubleshooting death, it lets you find what makes you want more. Stay alive 
for ten minutes, then die in five. A minute never seemed so long when sitting 
at the bottom of a fresh hourglass. Hold enough breath to get to the bottom 
and not enough to get back. Freedom of choice can't be regulated by general 
(consensus) Why bother? Why try? It's hopeless, destiny shows us why. Teasing 
the beast of temptation. Hanging at the end of a withered limb. Why bother? 
Why try? These are our lives to die.
