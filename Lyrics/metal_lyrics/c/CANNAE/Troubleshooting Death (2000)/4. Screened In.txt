Split between choiced, you bleach your thoughts with stories of false 
prophecy. Unorthodox methods of self religion, decayed and edge-burned 
portraits of mythological entities, a made up story to present the rules we 
should live by. If religion is the cure for to blindsight, come now and give 
me vision, for right now I cannot see.
