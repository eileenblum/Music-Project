Subject to liability you say, well at least it was worth it to see your head 
sliced in half like a tomato. Roots sewn by your blood and then nurtured 
through your kisses. Crawling themselves effortlessly through my skin 
manifesting on my insides, they grow and then pull me apart from the 
intestines our while postmortem thoughts whirl around my head. How could I be 
so blind? Evilness disguises itself so well. I'm better now anyway. Better 
left for dead
