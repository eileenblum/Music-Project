Begotten in rape
Blood of the giants runs in his veins
Mother gave way to him on this world
The outset of new splendid legend

The fairest hair around his face
Beautiful, healthy, strong body
Surrounded with dwarfs, brought up by the- dwarfs
He had no equal to him

The seven summers passed fast
Child in Black Forest, alone
Fear, darkness, Nature and strength
Wolves and the forest demons around him
Slavic God of Fire protected him
Then fear he defeated,
His place in the house was restored
Yet that wasn't his own people
But Destiny came to him
Giantess of untold beauty
Became his lover and mother
She shaped and guided his fate

Yearning to act - this lethal sickness
Drove him to the adventure
The only cure for despair
Are the praiseworthy deeds

Is he a dwarf ? or is he a giant?
Your value is proven by you

The life-goal is to be in power
For power is sweeter than honey
More pleasant than her bosom
Shall you known its secrets
The power is by your side
