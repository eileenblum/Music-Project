You come to this world
With the mission to fulfill
Causative Power of Cosmos
Manifest itself in You
You are Human God, Divine Human

Your genes are the ground
Progress and will are the corn
Work of life is the spike
The harvest - Culture and Civilisation,
You are Human God, Divine Human

The stronger, the wiser, the more beautiful-
the more splendid
A maze of mediocre around You
Shape reality with Your will
Å°bermensch - so You'll be named by flincher

Man, God, Hero
Warlike spirit dwells in You
Mind leads the brutal force
Kalos Kai Agathos

Don't be afraid to use Your power
Give way to instinct and emotions
Wisdom will free them by the gate of New Eon
For You are Kalos Kai Agathos
