Multitude of aspects of every being
Of carnal or of transcendental
Multiplicity of prisms is attributed to everything
But the Universe is a Unity

Ages ago the Noble men
Lived in harmony with Nature
Which is far from false divisions
For the Universe is a Unity

False prophets from the East
Have torn the Day away from the Night
They have created good and evil
When the Universe is a Unity

Body and soul make the Man
Man and Woman create new life
The balance of Elements
Lets the Universe be a Unity

Ruins are the new foundations
Death purifies the Earth for the next generations
The Universe is far from the moral judgements
For the Universe is a Unity
