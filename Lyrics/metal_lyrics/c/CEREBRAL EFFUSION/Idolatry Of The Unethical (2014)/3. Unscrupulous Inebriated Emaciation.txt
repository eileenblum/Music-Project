Maximum somatization degree
Intoxication induced psychotic hysteria
Intravenous amphetamine overdose
Cognitive notions disorder, circulatory collapse
Anxiety prevails to pain

I phagocyte myself violently 
Ingesting my own organs
Severe jaw contractions while extracting the blood vessels
I feed myself back with my intoxicated blood
Spiral of an unsustainable delirium 

Cerebral dopamine receptor blockade
My nervous system is reaching its capacity limit
A new dose requirement to avoid the pain
Intense fervor to consume my own flesh

Visceral convulsions, hormonal starvation
Voraciously hyperactive degeneracy 

Each compulsion gets me closer to the end of my ordeal
Deep into this rampant self-mutilating behavior
A torment of contradictory excitements takes my minds control
Unable to coordinate my extremities
I pass out still unsatisfied 

I lie on the ground disemboweled 
Impotent to new stimulations
Abandoned to emaciation 
As the narcotic effects cease
I start to feel the stabs like a growing itchy sensation
Pain comes with abstinence
Culminating in an incommensurate agony
