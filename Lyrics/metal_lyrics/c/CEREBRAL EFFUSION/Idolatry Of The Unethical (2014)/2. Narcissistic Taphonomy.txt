I crawl among the filth
Inducing the metabolic rupture of my organism 
Active putrefaction process
Autolitic degradation of the skin
Expelling fluids from the incisions I provoke to myself
The grotesque forms that take my limbs
Consciously rejecting the regeneration of my tissues
Persuaded by the abandonment of my psyche
This yearning for tasting the rigor mortis sensation 

I'm consumed from within
The incessant congregation of purulence
Is distributed through the arteries
I perceive the degradation of my esophagus
Deliriums, arrhythmias, ceasing of the endocrinic systems
The absolute climax
The impotence of my infested diaphragm
Tenacious swelling of the gastrointestinal tract
Unable to keep its content
Voracious feeding for maggots
The embryo of a new life being born from rottenness 

My mental faculties become confused and inefficient
The uncertain but puncturing insight of failure
Neutralizes every reaction on my body
A state of perverse intoxication that satisfies my ego
At the time that I enjoy this despondency

The science of the suspended abortion
Elongating the feeling of decease
To delight myself with its cruelty during eternal nights
Evaporating the inhibited greed in a heartbeat
The ultimate martyr for mankind

I feel the decadence, for I am

I'm carried along
