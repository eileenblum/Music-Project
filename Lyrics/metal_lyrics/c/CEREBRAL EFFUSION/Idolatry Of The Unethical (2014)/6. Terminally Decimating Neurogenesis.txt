The time has come to succumb to depravity
The neurogenesis to wipe out mankind
Cerebral parasites that modify fear perception
With surgical precision 
Reaching the brain through the bile
Larvae invading the limbic system
Abducting your mind

A predator organism seeking its host's dysfunction
For its own gain
So it can evolve into a stronger living
Inducing to a vile cannibalism
Dismissal of every phobia that manifests
Bringing forth an immoderate confrontation 
Man vs. man

Increasing pulsations, growing physical capacities
Supernatural strength, predatory shrewdness
Everything is reduced to a physiological need
The taste of putrefaction between the teeth
Frenzy of consuming decay

Decomposed flesh swamping the landscape 
Natural habitat for the corrupt bacteria
Lethargic bodies attracted to the coagulate blood stench
Putrid fluids emanating from mutilated extremities 
Ways of propagation for this menace
The driving force to devastation 

The last from the species to dominate the world
Emerges embodying the inner dissidence of the individual 
Feeding from distress and corruption
In perfect symbiosis with the most overwhelming decadence
Last plague of eradication
