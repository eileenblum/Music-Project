We persevere with the search of the irremediable anguish
The purity of the depraved consciousness 
The isolation of the pervert volition
Meditation exercises of the obscene
Mechanisms that perturb the mind of the innocent 

Infants unprotected from the bizarre
They wound their procreators obstinately 
The cadence of the stabs into the flesh
Inexorable carnal consummation
Relentless ignominies just for the gratitude of humiliating
Blood stench coagulates their optimism 
And the blade tears their affection
They observe their agony impassively 
Unable to perceive the aim of their weeping 
Their lack of passion brings us closer
To the most fearsome of the achievements 
The incarnation of a repugnantly compelling concept

Their groans submerge under my vigorous coercion
The new instigator of the sickening
Extinguish the empathy with bloodshed
Pleasure convulsions that engulf us into the apathetic ecstasy
The recreation of a homicidal revelation
Segregated limbs, mutilated remains

The immaculate act of violation
Destroying the human shell that perverts it

We will achieve the control of the ethical
The practice of horror as a way of purification
The sacrament of the final atrocity
Supreme level of consciousness

The worst is yet to come...
