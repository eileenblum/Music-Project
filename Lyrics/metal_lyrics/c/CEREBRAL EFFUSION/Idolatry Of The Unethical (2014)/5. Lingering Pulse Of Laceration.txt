Iniquitous individuals' infamy 
Penitence through blood
Psychological terror procedure
Putting out the eyes
Rendering the condemned incapable of seeing 
The remainder of the torture

Methodically butchered 
Sliced off breasts
Hanks of flesh gouged out
Of the arms and thighs
Severed limbs
Restraint of deceit

Death by dismemberment 
Mutilated in the afterlife

The tamed crowd rushes towards the carnage
As the cuts follow
Indoctrination towards the morbid
Faces of ecstasy, blissful gazes
Mortification of the infidel
Act of humiliation after death

The last whispers of conscience 
Take hold of remorse desperately 
There's nothing like anguish to purify
A visceral vision of human dignity
To prolong the suffering to the unbounded

Ultimate flash of despair 
It's hold in a lost stare
Like a thread of hope does to life
A moving expression of sorrow
When abjection transgresses the virtuous 
That instant of clarity which reveals
The secrets of flesh
Prelude to the inhuman stage
