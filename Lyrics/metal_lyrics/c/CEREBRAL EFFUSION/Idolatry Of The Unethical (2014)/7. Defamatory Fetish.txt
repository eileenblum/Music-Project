My enthusiasm for the human anatomy 
Transgresses every ethical conception
Bizarre obsession to overcome natural limits
Hyperactive psychosis that culminates in sexual acts
Redeemed by the presence of dead flesh
Knelt down before my wishes forever

The ravages provoked by my disability 
Make me look for an answer in a vegetative state
Slowed down decomposition 
As the pulse of my depraved desire
Tanned skins with sickening anatomical rigor
Future defamatory objects
Ruthless sodomite trophies 

I have developed my mind deep into sickness
Making a vast effort to exceed this moment's perversion
Obsessive avidity to fill this emptiness with sadistic joy
Can't conceive pleasure without absolute submission

I smash that inexpressive face ont he rude concrete
Disfiguring it repeatedly with extreme violence
'Till the point I reach an irreversible arousal
A terrifying and lecherous gaze is observing me
While I ejaculate over dehydrated flesh
Letting the last blood drops spill all over my cum-blasted face
Channeling my obsession to be loved by someone

Tears and self-mutilations
Domination of blood over waste
The end of my anhedonic state
A voracious climax that plunges me again
Into the most distressing neurotic depression
