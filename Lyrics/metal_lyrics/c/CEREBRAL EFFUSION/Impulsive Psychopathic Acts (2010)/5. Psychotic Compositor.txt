As always i find myself facing the challenge of a
Blank paper, but my body is still smeared with
Blood and entrails. Now I have just to copy what i
Have written on the back of this motherfucker with this
Cutter, I list all Iâm going to do. I take advantage of it
Engraving his screams and using them in this
Realistic composition. So, after slashing the thorax,
The belly and making some drawings on the face
I change my knife to open his scrotum, it fucking sucks!
The damned screams like a bitch, he knows he
Smells his own shit. I tear the skin out from his back, so
He can dictate me what I have written and I can
Copy it on his chest too. I think I have to improve my
Handwriting, this time screams are louder than before, I
Have to see his ribs. This blowtorch will be useful since they
Are hard. I have to tenderize them so I can break them.
Perfect!!! Iâm going to cut the gluteus off. I need somewhere
To hammer my awls and machetes when I donât use them,
I donât like said that I have to blow out the lungs, burst
The liver and explode the pancreas. I will leave for
The end to stamp on the heart. I know perfectly well that
When I tear it out, the blood wonât stop pumping and
Flowing his long hair will be useful to clean it. Iâm
Separating the scalp from the cranium right now. The best
Compositions are the ones based on real experiences,
But each day gets more difficult to improve. You are
Going to be my inspiration source in a neat future, be sure.
