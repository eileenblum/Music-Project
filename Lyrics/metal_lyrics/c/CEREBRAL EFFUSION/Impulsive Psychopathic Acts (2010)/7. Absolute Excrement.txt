Excrement! Morbid worries, strange vices. Great evenings full of
Pleasure. I want more and more, my psychosis exceeds indexplorable
Limits. Their embalmed lifeless corpses contribute, achieving
My aims. Iâm the big chef, the best, the sickest, the king,
The hatred and the coprophagic. In some ways I know that
They like it as much as I do. Their expressionless faces
Make me feel continuing intensely. I only want to
Defecate and impale them with my dick. Without hearing
Complaints! Without refusing my twisted pretensions!
The best part of this audition is left yet. I have to smear them
With my feces as best as I can to taste their flavors mix.
The defecated skins are my favorite course Iâm the big chef!
The best! The sickest! Iâm the king! The coporphagic necrophiliac!
Iâm going to consume your skin and lick all of you, filthy corpses!
My only intention is to fuck them, defecate and eat them.
Sometimes I also like to toast them but only on special
Occasions I grill them. Iâm the big chef! The best! The sickest!
Iâm the king! The coporphagic necrophiliac!
Absolute excrement, absolute excrement!
