Eight A.N. like every morning a new working day starts
For me to aberrate, abuse, scare an sodomize that bunch
Of useless swine old cracks. Preys serve as flesh for a pervert,
Twisted, sick and upset mind. It makes me feel energetic to
Watch how they suck each time I put my cock into their mouths
After taking their worn out and old false teeth away.
I am a grateful person so I reward them with walking sticks
Into their flabby and wrinkled asses. The crutches are reserved
For dried and maltreated vaginas. Sometimes I have to try
Hard but I always get it. If I watch little signs of pain in their
Faces by any chance I get more furious and I subject them
To extreme and atrocious beatings. Sticks, chairs, zimmers
Are used incessantly. After the severest and most aberrant
Bestialities some of them donât survive, today several of
Those sights are waiting for me. I am enjoying myself
For sure! Without realizing time has past and I have to
Postpone it, but I canât. I think I am leaving like this,
Without punishing a few of you. I stick these pens in you
And with your eyes extracted from their sockets. I play and
Stamp them. We are giving it up for today. Fuck!
I didnât get satisfied but donât worry motherfuckers,
We will continue tomorrow.
