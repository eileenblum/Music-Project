The inevitable final hour approaches due to our wrought apocaliptic yearning
Result of our hate, our madness, our wickedness and our inexorable destiny
All the seas dyes with our blood, the mountains are enormous piles of bones, the earth is covered with putrid flesh and the extirpated eyes that full the infernal heaven, are the witness of this vehement human genocide.

The insaciable thirst of moral becomes in anguish of extinguished humanity, to degenerate to hunger of living flesh
And now I need to eat the entrails of my despised fellows to finnish with this antropophagous deficiency

Right now I've drunk your dense blood, I've eaten all your body, I've licked your bones and I've stolen your vital strenght, nothing will stop this insaciable and sickly hunger
Then my only choice will be phagocite my self in the limit of the extreme depravation
