Product of a sick and impious mind, the creation of an atrocius being, is inevitable the immersed deceit of beings in melancoly, permit "Dr. Meat" to carry then to his deadly hands

His fear permits to go far away of any human being, twisted intelligence by the dream of the immortality
The shine of his eyes, before the incision removes his masque showing his true face, thinking that the members and organs accumulated will be his salvation, the only carry to a permature death

The first grafts produce him erections and orgams, but they are only a reflection of his alienated imbalance the pestilence removed by his body
Submerges him a lake of grief and pain, victim of his dark thought
The grafts in his body return against him, the putrefaction seizes his body
Wait patiently to death, it will carry the dismembered bodies, that you condemned
