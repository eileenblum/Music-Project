Great nauseas overrun his body, and feels that something that is wringing inside, devours him slowly
I think my metabolism is changing (be)cause my veins arouse and my sweat becomes into blood

He shakes of pain and falls down, his stomach goes oppening little by little
In a moment I feel that I die, with the agony reflected in my face

A creature appears through the big hole that has made in my body, goes out of my, and in my suffering, almost dead I notice its murderous instinct

Dismembered by the alien, my corpse lies down now, the maggots will do the rest
The being that has sprout out of me will go on with this slaughter, first one and then other, human captures for an unknow murderous instinct that born and revive in a crypt besides some more
In a remot planet
A last breath before dying
