Here comes the omnipotent, bloody, arrogant and most supreme demigod,
Seeking another propitiatory victim that satisfy my pressing anxieties,
To slice viscose and visceral vital organs, the flavour of a liver, the dense and sticky touch of blood,
The pestilence of your extensive and acid intestines,
The beats of your still latent heart in my hand, destroy your lungs to deny your appraised oxigen,
Castrated by a final bite, and to take your viperine and serpentine tongue off with my powerful arm after an arduous and rewarding effort

Far away, even surpassin the pleasure of the sexual climax
Bloody ecstasy the biggest and incomparable sensation of being felt thus, a supreme being over good and evil
The first and greater exponent of a man done god
All you are and will be my acolytes, my subjects...
Despicable servants that will have to yield me tribute with your insignificant and dispensable lives

And you will fill and feed with your bodies as trophy my empty cup, until culminating my bloody ecstasy
