Torture, opression, hate, blood, pain, devastation, death, apocalypse, destruction, horror, anihilation, depravation, murder, agression, compulsion

Kataklysm, vengance, animosity, jelousy, anger, fury, desperation, lewdness, depression
Altough I want that all this end I think that the longiness of the wrong extermination didn't lease until the culmination of my bloody acts takes place

A tortured mind that it seems even to conserve minuscule cracks of lucidity, that was forgotten, violence in motion
