Pushed by the physiological and corporal need, should submit to the methods of the most rigorous and cruel hangmans and white dressed murderers, tortured and mutilated, postrated as a distressed paraplegic, in a narrow and disturbing strecher gloomy cell for an innocent, sick and chosen prisioner

Tormented human coberry, one more experiment, another expedient that will add to the list of your butcher failures
You don't listen my strident shouts of pain, and don't do anything to avoid the relaxation of my sphincters, drowing me in my bitter wee and resting upon faecal excrements
Attend my insistent requests and my desperate laments

I implore uselessly an aid that you are not going to give me, impatient in this growing spiral of sufferings
Your only solution is stuff me with ineffective drugs that annul my personality and destroy me psychological and morally
You lack any alternative to correct my persistent wrongs, playing thus irresponsibily with the more precious gift, the human life, summarizing only an horrifying death

But the more terrific and at the same time hopeful paradox is, that sooner or later every doctor becomes patient.
MOTHERFUCKERS!!!
