They have discovered me! Know that they'll catch me! But I want to continue enjoying the wines and the anguish of my dismantled and carved toys. I cannot resign to this sickly and assassin ludopathy. So I decide to deliver my life to death to keep on playing. A dynamite charge and I disintegrate in million and very small pieces of meat in front in your noses, splattering all of you completely with my guts and my blood. Once left back to earthly existence I found the victims that delighted and recreated me in my previous life. For my rejoicing, I'm going to be able to continue inflicting suffering my buddies again. Joining them in a eternal spiral of torture, pain shouts and joyce. Nothing comparable to the previously lived!!
