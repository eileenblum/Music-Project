I know that is inside me. Is lodged, it grows and reproduces left-hand sided and quietly. What for others is a disease and for me is and intense delight. When my mind succumbs and it totally alienated by the incessant search to inflict suffering and extermination, only simple perception of a life being, explodes the accumulated evil that's me, turning it brutal hatred. Now I don't think, I only act, to tear existence, to strangle souls, to take brains, to carve up spirits, to trample lungs, to vomit life. When I'm in calm again, my deliriums and paranoids get bigger as time goes by. And even though I'm trying to escape from the jail that this anguish produces, doubts and questions. Has it happen? Or has it happen only in my head? Blood and Dry Guts impregnate my clothes and body stars running over and over again. Then I don't act, I only think.
