[Music: Kjellgren]
[Lyrics: Schulman ]

For mighty misery and anger
With violence, fire and pain
The dawn of crusade chaos
Infernal - Eternal
The light of your existence
Is crashed to bleeding pieces
Your dreams of glory
Desecrated - Devastated

I have opened the gates
Now your soul is mine
In everlasting bloodshed
Your kingdom is gone

The blade of stormy hatred
A wind of total darkness
The triumph of hellish murder
Monumental - Dominion
A hellcult with demons
Embrace the swords of carnage
Forgiveness, entangled
Forever - Blasphemy

I have opened the gates
Now your soul is mine
In everlasting bloodshed
Your kingdom is gone

Your spirit is forgotten and dead
Almighty devil ripped your flesh away
I am the bringer of torture and hate
I spread my burning neverending shade

[Lead: Wiklund]

For mighty misery and anger
With violence, force and pain
The dawn of cursed chaos
Infernal - Eternal
The light of your existence
Is crashed to bleeding pieces
Your dreams of glory
Desecrated - Devastated

I have opened the gates
Now your soul is mine
In everlasting bloodshed
Your kingdom is gone
