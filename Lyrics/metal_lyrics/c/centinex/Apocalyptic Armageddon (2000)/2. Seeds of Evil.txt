On my way through the past
With guidance of the dead
Abandoned to the dark
With my demons of lust

I am the son of evil, born of hate and greed

I am the master starving for your blood
I am the chaosbreeder in my seeds of evil

I live forever in the dark
With whores by my side
Surrounded by demons
In my hellish domain

I am the son of darkness, born of hate and greed

I am the master starving for your blood
I am the chaosbreeder in my seeds of evil

Seeds of evil breeding your sins

[Lead: Wiklund]
[Lead: Kjellgren]

Feeble souls of eternal hate - forbidden sins in crimson blood
Morbid lusts of bleeding hearts - immortal art: Anno Satani

On my way through the past
With guidance of the dead
Abandoned to the dark
With my demons of lust

I am the son of evil, born of hate and greed

I am the master starving for your blood
I am the chaosbreeder in my seeds of evil

Feeble souls of eternal hate - forbidden sins in crimson blood
Morbid lusts of bleeding hearts - immortal art: Anno Satani
