[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

The triumph of death
Like a spell of mayhem it prevails
Sent to destroy
The Holy sacred feeble light
Devastating warlust
Follow the crusade against life
A violent kingdom
Where the dreams are raped with blood

Armageddon, revelation, Armageddon 666
The masters of terror reign further with blasphemy

Glorious destruction
Warriors of deadly freezing steel
It's time for war
It's time to unleash the final fire
Blasphemic beasts
Towards the silent morbid throne
Millennium chaos
Malice of the flesh raging near

Armageddon, revelation, Armageddon 666
The masters of terror reign further with blasphemy

The endless plague - a conspiracy of lust and death
Dominion - no sign of light
The hell has arrived

Devil's force - among division holocaust
A crescent flame - sings those dreams far away
No retreat - the new glorious age is here
The apocalypse - the jaws of the infernal antichrist

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Armageddon, revelation, Armageddon 666
The masters of terror reign further with blasphemy
