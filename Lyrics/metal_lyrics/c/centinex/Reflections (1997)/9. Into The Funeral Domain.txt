[Music: Schulman &amp; Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Blinded by the fear 
I'm trapped inside 
The twilight 
and the dark illusions drain 
It will guide me 
through the Northern storm 
The wasteland of eternity 
will reign 

I... enter the funeral domain 
On a neverending chaos we lay 
And I enter the funeral... domain 

You feed me with the flames 
of burning hate 
Memories of loss and cold desire 
With silent steps I face my destiny 
A land for the forsaken 
shadow to be 

A sorrowscape of my wonderland 
Astral gleams where we weep 
Beyond the grief infinity awaits 
I carve me through 
the shades of maze 

I memorize the dreaming ones 
I gather dark coldness 
As the light evolves 
I hide far away 

The golden dawn is blazing bright 
And I enter the mountain side 
I grab my visions of eternity 
And caress the strength of time 

Hear the lake and waves 
of a bleeding sleep 
Enthroned spirits 
of an evil damnation 
Whispers seals the wonds 
of my creation 
Funeral of shredded souls domain
