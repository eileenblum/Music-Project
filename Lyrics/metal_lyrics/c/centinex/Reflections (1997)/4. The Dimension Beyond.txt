[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Riding through storms 
And blowing winds 
The winter night 
Like a Northern breeze 

Onward to the grace 
Burn me in the dimension 
beyond 

The sun turns to black 
And moonshine prevails 
The power of shadows 
In grief and in pain 

Forever the serpent sign shall rise 
Eternal is the hate 
of the pagan call 
And bleed for me, seal my fate 
among the cries 
A dimension beyond 
the blackest times 

Follow the past 
And the arctic star 
It leads you to 
Chaos and lust 

Forever - The serpent sign 
Eternal - Is the hate 
And bleed for me - Seal my fate 
The dimension beyond 
the blackest times
