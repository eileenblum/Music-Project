[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Under the sky of blackened clouds 
A moonfog shall arise Seven winds of hate 
Awaits... 
I raise my sword to the sky 
to the sphere where the ravens fly 
Seal the sign of the twilight horde

Life, eternal life 
You're devoured as one 
Dominion of centuries behind

Across the horizon in North 
The forces are moving further 
Through mountains of snow and ice 
They ride... 
A century of blood 
In the name of dark 
Total wrath and pure destruction

Upon the throne of infernal blood 
I'm the ruler 
of a burning kingdom 
Blazing skies and winter nights 
My princess of fear is born

The seven keys to the seven gates 
Makes my land open wide 
The wolves are gathered in the woods 
A new era has been born
