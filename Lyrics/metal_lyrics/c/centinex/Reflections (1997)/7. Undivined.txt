[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Seven enshrined souls 
Stranded on a journey far 
On a shore of sorrow 
All the tears are gleam 

I'm your undivined God 

The rain is slipping 
through your hands 
Feared by the golden thorns 
A graveyard of wasted memories 

I'm your undivined God 
Now descending 
on black withering wings 

As the sun burns red 
I wrap my arms around you 
A wasteland of burn marks, 
a temple of shadows 
Reflections eternal, 
I touched the deeper dawn 
I enchanted your heart, 
the shades showed us the mark 

Your life is written in blood 
In love, in time, in fear 
A dark faced stranger 
from yesterday 

A void like a speachless silence 
Or a sleeping empty lie 
LIke a burning endless rainbow 
From a dimension far away 

Time to set the flaming sails 
Off to the unknown we leave 
Far away from the earthly 
We are gone for now and ever
