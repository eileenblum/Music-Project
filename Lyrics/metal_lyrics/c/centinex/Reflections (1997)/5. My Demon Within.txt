[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

A misty ground 
Seals my soul of pagan fire 
Ripped apart 
Dark emotions and inner thoughts 
We will all 
Take part in the endless journey 
As we weep 
To the hymns of an arctic star 

My demon within 
conquer my mind 
Echoes of frost 
(in a damnated soul) 
Damnation reigns 
A sorcery of fear and sorrow 
Eternal thorns 
Flew high like glory shadows 
In the past 
A silent age of divine destruction 
Led me through 
To a world 
of subconscious demons 

Illusions fall 
In the halls of slumber centuries 
Passed away 
In temples of obscurity 
Infinity 
I watch the land of mortality 
Eternally 
Dwell among the seven prophecies 

Beholding the winds 
of crimson calls 
Wastelands, 
the grounds of vengeance 
My demon, 
my princess of wisdom 
I sharpen my swords 
And into the kingdom I ride 

Prophanity 
I have seen the spiritual aeons 
A shadowdance 
Like a mistress of hidden thunder 
In time and space 
I am dying, I am searching 
For a fire 
Which can raise my inner demon
