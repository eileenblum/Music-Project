[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

And when the moon 
has turned to black 
Darkened clouds beneath 
the astral stars 
As the winds fly through 
with wings so dark 
A deep storming sea 
with griefull past 

I touch the grief, feel the pain 
Taste the sorrow, before the dawn 

The seagull fly in circles 
over an open sea 
A morning again has risen 
with silver tears 
At the shore of a dreadful baltic 
I touch the stones as the water 
echoes your name 

Here I stand all alone 
Themendous pain freeze inside 
The sun sets slowly, 
cold and silent 
One day we will be united as one 

I cry until dawn 
My mind disappears into the dark 
In a void where candles burn 
Sleep forever, dream those dreams
