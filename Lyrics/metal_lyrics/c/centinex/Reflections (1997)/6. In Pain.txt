[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Lost love beyond fallen sorrow 
See the black dawn rise 
We fell in ecstasy 
Turning the mist into shadows 
In pain I see the falling raindrops 
As they sweap my naked flesh 

In pain - 
I dwell 
My love - 
Dream those endless dreams 
Beyond the withering beauty 
The moon will shine 
red and bright 
Carried by the golden wings 
In pain I see the love fade 

I can turn the sky to ever black 
Roses fade in silent halls 
As the snow covers the trees 
Freeze the fear and promises 

At the gates of the ancient light 
Unblessed darkness burning still 
In hell I will touch my soul 
Thy my kingdom 
has risen with pride 

Cold scars and blackened rivers 
The red sea echoes your name 
You have sealed your wounds 
The flowers slowly decay 
In pain I see the falling rain drops 
As they cover my naked flesh 

At the gates of teh ancient light 
Unblessed darkness burning still 
Frozen tears in frozen eyes 
Here I stand at the dawn of lies 
Lead me into the Autumn years 
Then the shades 
shall dance before me
