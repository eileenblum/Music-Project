[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Embalmed in a frozen tomb 
Beneath the moon 
I face the naked dawn 
I stand still and stear 
through out the river 
A distant chant 
returns me to the past 

You, my Goddess, 
My queen of dark temptation 
You feed my hunger 
with black sinful love 

Freezing lust to my 
infernal mistress 
Seven prophecies forsooth eternally 
Summon your blood, 
my wine, dark erotica 
Seven prophecies forsooth eternally 

Searching for a griefull pleasure 
A shadow or a sign 
from my coldest bride 
Caressed by a guiding wind 
Leads me away 
to the horizon of tears 

A burning vision, 
they are my wings 
Into the flames, I fly 
I kissed the sunset, 
I adored the night 
A silent dance infront of me 

Like a portal with velvet lights 
I am now one with moonlight 
Like dragon shadows, like elves and stars 
I sealed the grief in a dreamscape 

Like illusions can fall apart 
Like stones can turn to dust 
The everblazing moon 
can be darkened 
Immortal is my passion 
Despair and memories 
Forever I will fill your existence 

Into the deep horizon I fly 
Searching for the new born dawn 
You my Goddess, 
My queen of dark temptation 
One day we will forever sleep
