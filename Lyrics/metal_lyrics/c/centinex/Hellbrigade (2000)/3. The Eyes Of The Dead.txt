[Lyrics: J. Jansson]

Crawling - Slowly
On the filthy smeary soil
Drowning - Falling
Into the crypts of burning flesh
Bleeding - Soring
Inwards to your rotten souls
Sweeping - Swarming
Around in the carnal halls of blood

Drivel around my hellish whores, consuming souls of the dead

Warfare against life - Bloodbath
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Demons surround me - Carnage
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead

Roaming - Floating
Onward through your empty veins
Seeking - Hunting
For a taste of boiling blood
Sneaking - Downwards
Into the tombs of morbid lusts
Twisting - Slithering
Around in my pool of blood

Drivel around my hellish whores, consuming souls of the dead

Warfare against life - Bloodbath
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Demons surround me - Carnage
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead

Floating into your filthy soul, onward through your empty veins
For a taste of boiling blood,
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Crawling - Slowly
On the filthy smeary soil
Drowning - Falling
Into the crypts of burning flesh
Bleeding - Soring
Inwards to your rotten souls
Sweeping - Swarming
Around in the carnal halls of blood

Drivel around my hellish whores, consuming souls of the dead

Warfare against life - Bloodbath
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
Demons surround me - Carnage
I'm seeing it all through the eyes of the dead
