[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Coming across the raped burning land
Ready to strike like a total armageddon
Welcome to a hellish show
The final breakdown of remaining dreams

It's the midnight hour
Onward to the battle with pounding fire

Guided by the heartbeats
With hellspawned power

The burnmarks are now to be written in blood
Souls are abandoned at the flamemarked line
The sun has failed to spread its glory
A neverending night has conquered the throne

It's the midnight hour
Onward to the battle with pounding fire

Guided by the heartbeats
With hellspawned power
Guided by the heartbeats
Towards devastation

See the bleeding spirits rise
Those are the shields of cursed lies
Heading for the unknown sphere
They are lost in time

Glory to the fallen ones - March on in the name of those
Warriors of eternity - A pure infernal hellbrigade

See the bleeding spirits rise - They are lost in time

Coming across the raped burning land
Ready to strike like a total armageddon
Welcome to a hellish show
The final breakdown of remaining dreams

It's the midnight hour
Onward to the battle with pounding fire

Guided by the heartbeats
With hellspawned power
Guided by the heartbeats
Towards devastation

See the bleeding spirits rise - They are lost in time

Glory to the fallen ones - March on in the name of those
Warriors of eternity - A pure infernal hellbrigade
