[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Forever my longing has been there
Like a sweet scenario of eternity
Bring forth the kingdom of fear and lies
Take me to the world where happines dies

In the abyss they feel the storming night
Sent with desire to the portal of power

Nightbreeder - Firefeeder
Nightbreeder - The mass has begun

In the darkness
I seal the mark divine
Streaming crimson chaos
Spawned from a devilish sign

Thousand demons, scornful legions of hate
Purest darkside shows the blackest way
Damnation appears, the flames are burning higher
Total grim existence, feed the dreams of demonic realms

Nightbreeder - Firefeeder
Nightbreeder - The mass has begun

In the darkness
I seal the mark divine
Streaming crimson chaos
Spawned from a devilish sign

Like a thundering storm I follow the path of the freezing mist
Into the dark, out to the unknown
The voices are calling, waiting for me to come through
Nightbreeder - A part of a sinful horde

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Depths of hell, the home of life unpure
We have risen awaiting the final call
Roar to the moon, gather around the throne
Take my soul, take me to the master below

Nightbreeder - Firefeeder
Nightbreeder - The mass has begun

In the darkness
I seal the mark divine
Streaming crimson chaos
Spawned from a devilish sign
