[Lyrics: J. Kjellgren]

Stabbing your soul into an unknown conscious
Neverending torture, time to reveal the pain
You are slowly drowning in a sea of blood
Let the evil have its way, let it crawl

Enter the eternal darkness
Pray for your funeral to come
Times of wrath strangles your mind
The home of evil I got inside my burning soul

You are possessed by the mighty darkness
A human sacrifice to honour our master

Enter the eternal darkness
Pray for your funeral to come
Times of wrath strangles your mind
The home of evil I got inside my burning soul

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Deep inside your frozen veins your blood wants to rule again
Deep inside your empty heart your soul will wake again

Tortured from the cradle to the grave
Arise, hear the moans from below
Release the armageddon, hell on earth

[Lead: Wiklund]

Stabbing your soul into a unknown conscious
Neverending torture, time to reveal the pain
You are slowly drowning in a sea of blood
Let the evil have its way, let it rule, let it crawl

Enter the eternal darkness
Pray for your funeral to come
Time of wrath strangles your mind
The home of evil I got inside my burning soul
