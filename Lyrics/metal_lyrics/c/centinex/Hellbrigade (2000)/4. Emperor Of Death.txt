[Lyrics: J. Kjellgren]

You are on a path which will lead you to the kingdom of the dead
Life as you know it has come to an end
The flames reaches higher and higher
There is no more light just the burning of hellsfire

Praise the infernal spirit of lucifer

I am the emperor of death, a wellknown slayer from the past
I am the emperor of death and the throne of evil is mine

Your eyes would bleed if I gave you a glance
You all cry blood just by hearing my name

Praise the infernal spirit of lucifer

I am the emperor of death, a wellknown slayer from the past
I am the emperor of death and the throne of evil is mine

The power of hell stands beside me
As I sacrifice the flesh of the holy lambs

[Lead: Wiklund]

You are on a path which will lead you to the kingdom of the dead
Life as you know it has come to an end
The flames reaches higher and higher
There is no more light just the burning of hellsfire

Praise the infernal spirit of lucifer

I am the emperor of death, a wellknown slayer from the past
I am the emperor of death and the throne of evil is mine

The dead has risen from the abyss of haunted souls
Their spirit fills you with fear - The earth is turning into ash
The throne of evil is mine
