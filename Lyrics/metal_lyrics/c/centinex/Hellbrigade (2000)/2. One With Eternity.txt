[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Undress the cold northern wind
Carry the strenght through bloodred waters
Feel the gloom of a cosmic universe
A moment of silence and nothingness

The mystery of a dying fire
Gaze into the astral skies
The sun has passed away
Unite the present with eternity

Embraced by the neverending doom
Desires desolated by the claws of time
Like a gateway to a timeless sphere
A passion for the eternal eternity

The mystery of a dying fire
Gaze into the astral skies
The sun has passed away
Unite the present with eternity

Reduced to ashes - Onward into the pleasuring chaos
The dynasty of demonwings - The grimness, the creation of cruelty

This is the end
Let the kingdom sink
Released for all to see
Tormented inner dreams

[Lead: Wiklund, Kjellgren]

Undress the cold northern wind
Carry the strenght through bloodred waters
Feel the gloom of a cosmic universe
A moment of silence and nothingness

The mystery of a dying fire
Gaze into the astral skies
The sun has passed away
Unite the present with eternity
