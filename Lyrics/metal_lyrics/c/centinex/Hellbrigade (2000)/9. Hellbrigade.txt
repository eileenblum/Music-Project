[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

A flash in the night, the legion is here
Like a mighty predator of hatebreathing steel
Out in the fields the aim is to kill
Until the end the fight gives a thrill

We are the hellbrigade
Troops of terror and fear
We annihilate, we desecrate
Out on a mission to devastate

The moon gives us light, the stars brings us strenght
We are the ones with bloodthirsty will
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We will strike hard with power supreme

We are the hellbrigade
Troops of terror and fear
We annihilate, we desecrate
Out on a mission to devastate

From dust to mud, from dawn to night
The fallen ones are buried and gone
Blood for blood, eye for an eye
We march with pride and victory in mind

[Lead: Wiklund]

A flash in the night, the legion is here
Like a mighty predator of hatebreathing steel
Out in the fields the aim is to kill
Until the end the fight gives a thrill

We are the hellbrigade
Troops of terror and fear
We annihilate, we desecrate
Out on a mission to devastate
