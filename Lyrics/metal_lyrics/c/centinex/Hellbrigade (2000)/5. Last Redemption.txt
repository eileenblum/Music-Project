[Lyrics: J. Jansson]

Endless nights in a splendid dark
Where the dream of hate is pure
Wasteless days in my living hell
Where the thorns are stabbing my heart

Falling, drowning in my soul of black
Leaving silent from this cruel world

I am a worthless soul with tears in my eyes
And the crows are stabbing my back

Wounded in my filthy evil soul
Darkish hellholes await my heart

Here I am laying at the point of death
Waiting for my passage to hell
I close my eyes and wait for the fall
Free from my wounds, free from my sins

Falling, drowning in my soul of black
Leaving silent from this cruel world

Here I am laying at the point of death
Waiting for my passage to hell
I close my eyes and wait for the fall
Free from my wounds, free from my sins
