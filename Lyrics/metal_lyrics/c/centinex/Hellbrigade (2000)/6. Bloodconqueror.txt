[Lyrics: J. Jansson &amp; J. Kjellgren]

In the age of darkness we are still riding through
Cold sweeping winds from the other side
The ravenshadow follows our path
Oh, mighty god - Give me power to desecrate

In the name of evil we are killing with power
Unleash the final fire and we conquer in blood

Now we have raised our swords in the cold northern lands
Heading for the battle with strenght in our hands
The aim is to kill you upon the freezing snow
Now it's time for war and your heart will be my stone

In the name of evil we are killing with power
Unleash the final fire and we conquer in blood

Hellish bloodshed in the north
Battles in the bloodred snow
Chaos is our killing game
We take your life, we eat your soul
The battle demon strikes again
I carve your flesh until the end

Chaos in the north
We take your life, we eat your soul - War

In the age of darkness we are still riding through
Cold sweeping winds from the other side
The ravenshadow follows our path
Oh, mighty god - Give me power to desecrate

In the name of evil we are killing with power
Unleash the final fire and we conquer in blood
