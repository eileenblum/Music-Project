[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

We are tormented souls of the unlight
Conquering the earth with spiteful storms

Rise from the realms of darkness
Centuries of unholy chaos
Lead me to the streams of slaughter
Dawn of the glorious war

Infernal conquest
Infinity rises
Misanthropic fire
Forsaken holocaust eternal

Victory in a naked painland
Anthems to the fallen ones
Until the eternity opens
We feast with our burning power

Infernal conquest
Infinity rises
Misanthropic fire
Forsaken holocaust eternal

Come my firestorm - We will desecrate
Exterminate - Blood-soaked beasts reign
Broken skulls - Black clouds drowning
We will blow - It to the kingdom unknown

Rise from the realms of darkness
Centuries of unholy chaos
Lead me to the streams of slaughter
Dawn of the glorious war

Infernal conquest
Infinity rises
Misanthropic fire
Forsaken holocaust eternal
