[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Jansson &amp; Schulman]

Searching for an evil way
As total darkness remains
To end your suffered life
Enter the threshold in your domain

Hellblood - Under the pagan glory

I'm in the gates
Where dark remains
I shut my eyes
Into total darkness

Awakening in paradise
Forgotten and laid down to die
Like an ever-burning stream
In blood it appears to me

Hellblood - Under the pagan glory

I'm in the gates
Where dark remains
I shut my eyes
Into total darkness

Glory will soon be revealed
As I slowly turn to my shadow
A voice spoke to me
I have opened the gate beyond the truth

[Lead: Wiklund]

Wrath of blood and sacrifice
Revocation through carnal hate
In the abyss of cursed mankind
The pure pagan glory reigns

For the banner of steel we ride
Vengeance by fire so silent
We are the hordes of devastation
Crush the race under the pagan glory
