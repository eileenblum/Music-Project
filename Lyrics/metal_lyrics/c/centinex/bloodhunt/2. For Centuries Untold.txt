[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Left to bleed in the wasteland
Spawned by the master
Fire below the domains
Possessing endless battles
Through the misty night
The legions of hell
Crush the sacred ones
For centuries untold

Life eternal - Infinity appears
Release the demons - Skies of cruelty

The light of the black moon is shining
In the shadows of nothingness
Damnation will reign
Restless violent roars
Deeper with strength and pride
To the portal of beauty
Existence grim and pure
For centuries untold

Life eternal - Infinity appears
Release the demons - Skies of cruelty

Thorns of doom, swords of mortality
Firestorm, thunder and winds of hate
Warlord, burning creations
Black horizons, hellhammer eternity

Dead but dreaming still
Follow the abyss of time

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Blood is the mighty delight
Forgotten in my destiny

Left to bleed in the wasteland
Spawned by the master
Fire below the domains
Possessing endless battles
Through the misty night
The legions of hell
Crush the sacred ones
For centuries untold

Life eternal - Infinity appears
Release the demons - Skies of cruelty
