[Music &amp; Lyrics: Schulman]

Through the fields of sorrow
Realms of torment
Destruction and bloodshed - Remains
Raising total hell
Creating silent ruins
Desolation and mayhem - War

Infernal battles and blackened bloodhunt
The beauty in torture, a blizzard of dust and steel
Hymns to the night-time, a diabolical firestorm
Pounding conquest, ruined by the art of darkness

Devastation - Mesmerised in ghostly creations
Destroyer - Towards like darkened storms

The gates of desaster are open wide
Sadistic slaughter, summon the age of cruelty
Force of the sinners, mighty warriors reborn
Holocaust and hellstorms, only chaos remains

Devastation - Mesmerised in ghostly creations
Destroyer - Towards like darkened storms

Whispering bullets
Blood upon the ground
Shadows from death 'til dawn
On the fields of frozen sins

[Lead: Wiklund]

Hear the distant cries
Fearful aggression returns
Dominion and eternal doom, a journey in burning pain
Crawling through molested woods
In a time of total death, in an age of carnal fear
Final Armageddon

An eternal wasteland
Pure hell - Damnation

Devastation - Mesmerised in ghostly creations
Destroyer - Towards like darkened storms
