[Music &amp; Lyrics: Schulman]

Haunted by a twilight void
Into the endlessness they flow
Tearing up the sacred flames
Darkness is they rising desire

Destroy - The sunrise glory
Passion - To the dark one
Silence - Obey the nightsky
Fire - Luciferian moon prevails

Open the burning gates of hatred
Unlock the abyss of dying time
A voice and a twisted illusion
Enthroned by a stormy inferno

Bleeding lies, flames of fire
2000 years of chaos
A demonic mind with chained secrets
Time to rise the Luciferian moon

Torn from their pure existence
Feeding the hellbreathing beast
Infernal everlasting ages
Closer, caress their soul with blood

Bleeding lies, flames of fire
2000 years of chaos
A demonic mind with chained secrets
Time to rise the Luciferian moon

Fallen delight - The call of the Master
Serpent's kiss - Misanthropy remains

[Lead: Wiklund]
[Lead: Kjellgren]

Bleeding lies, flames of fire
2000 years of chaos
A demonic mind with chained secrets
Time to rise the Luciferian moon
