[Music: Kjellgren]
[Lyrics: Jansson, Schulman &amp; Kjellgren]

Onward through the fields
I'm hunting for revenge
Effacing all in my way
I'm a killing warmachine
Built on iron and steel
I kill all in my sight
Bloodhunt

I'm out for bloodhunt and I want to see you dead
My sweeping bullets aiming for your head
I'm out for bloodhunt, I slash you through the mud
My eyes are red and all I see is blood

I'm still on my path
Searching for your flesh
Longing for your soul
I'm a reaper with disgrace
A slaughter fed by hate
Crushing all the weak
Bloodhunt

I'm out for bloodhunt and I want to see you dead
My sweeping bullets aiming for your head
I'm out for bloodhunt, I slash you through the mud
My eyes are red and all I see is blood

Bombraids - Destruction
Warfare - Massacre
Repulsion - Crusader
Vengeance - Chaos

I'm back on the fields
I dwell among the dead
And the victory is mine
My combat has succeeded
The silence has arrived
My mission is complete
Bloodhunt

I'm out for bloodhunt and I want to see you dead
My sweeping bullets aiming for your head
I'm out for bloodhunt, I slash you through the mud
My eyes are red and all I see is blood
