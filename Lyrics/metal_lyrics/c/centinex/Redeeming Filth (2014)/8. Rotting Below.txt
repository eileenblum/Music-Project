The purpose of life
Searching for happiness
Spending your time
Hunting for a meaning

Nothing matters
We are nothing
Meaningless circle
Circle of dying

Six feet deep
The tunnel of death
The mandatory path
worm nourishment

Rotting below
Rotting below

Spending your time
Bulding a life
Education, work,
Money and breeding

Nothing matters
We are nothing
Meaningless circle
Circle of dying

Struggling your whole life
In this meaningless circle
To end up feeding the worms
And rotting below

Rotting below
Rotting below

Our life is a waste of time
Your existance have just one purpose
The creators intention for you
To feed and shelter the worms
The corpse, a house of maggots
Laying eggs and giving birth
Nourishing on all the soft tissue
Soon you are nothing but dirt

The purpose of life
Searching for happiness
Spending your time
Hunting for a meaning

Nothing matters
We are nothing
Meaningless circle
Circle of dying

Six feet deep
The tunnel of death
The mandatory path
Worm nourishment

Rotting below
Rotting below
To end up feeding the worms
And rotting below
