Soul tormention
Bring death to all
In agony and ecstacy
A lethal final call

Slowly fading away
Never to return alive
Dreams are done and lost
A life to end in misery

A spirit forgotten
Enter the void of gloom
Hide behind the shadows
Upon the path of doom

Only pain remains - When bodies are deformed
See the darkest day - When bodies are deformed
Existence denied - When bodies are deformed
All hope is gone - When bodies are deformed

The jouney has come to an end
Others follow close behind

Soul tormention

A life to end in misery

See the darkest day - When bodies are deformed
Existence denied - When bodies are deformed
All hope is gone - When bodies are deformed
