Lying lifeless, total silence
Unmercifully it cuts right through you
Open mouth with starring gaze
Last sight was its superior

Death glance
Death glance

Both eyes open wide, it's looking
Looking right out in empty air
Starring through all the living
Death glance, looking right through you

Death glance
Death glance

There is something very special with a dead face
The life has left the body, taken away
Minutes ago it was breathing and moving
From talking and laughing to nothing and zero

Lying lifeless, total silence
Umercifully it cuts right through you
Open mouth with starring gaze
The eyes frozen in eternity

Death glance
Death glance
Death glance
Death glance
