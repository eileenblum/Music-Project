A burial ground
A dark and soulless place
Deep inside
Your empty body decomposed
Slowly rotting
Only memories remain
Haunted calm nothingness
A place for the final rest

Dead buried and forgotten
Ripped apart below ground
Dead buried and forgotten
Broken and forever drowned

Your empty body has moulded away silently
Ripped apart, broken and forever drowned
A destiny in the everlasting shadows
Ceremony has come to an end

Dead buried and forgotten
Ripped apart below ground
Dead buried and forgotten
Broken and forever drowned

Dead are the living
Living to die
Your soul will forever dwell in misery

Dead buried and forgotten
Ripped apart below ground
Dead buried and forgotten
Broken and forever drowned
Dead buried and forgotten
Ripped apart below ground
Dead buried and forgotten
Broken and forever drowned
