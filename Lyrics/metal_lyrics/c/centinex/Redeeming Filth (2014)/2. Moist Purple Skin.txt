Found dead sunken to the bottom of the river
Mummified from top to bottom
With blue plastic ropes
Chained to a big block of concrete
All wrapped in layers and layers of plastic

I thought it was going to be my little secret
To take this knowledge of a missing body to my grave
I thought that all of my problems were taken care of
Sunken to the bottom of the river and forever forgotten

Swollen beyond recognition
She is a result of a big misunderstanding
I told her not to yell and tried to calm her down
When both are afraid it's a sticky situation
It all happened fast, over in seconds

I was never bothered of her sudden disappearance
I did never miss her or feel sorry for anything
Probably her children were at home worried sickly
Shit fucking happens, what can I say?

Moist purple skin [2x]
Swollen beyond recognition
Moist purple skin [2x]
Destined to feed the fish

Found dead sunken to the bottom of the river

Moist purple skin [2x]
