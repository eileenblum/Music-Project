He is bigger that the average person
Inhuman strength natural from birth
Mentally handicapped, disfigured appearance
Never, ever sleeps to avoid dreaming

Walking around all alone in the night
Moving slowly and quiet in shadows
If you catch a glimpse of this beast
This beast will tear you apart

He will kill you instantly with just one stroke
Rip an arm off with his bear hands
Tremendous force, extremly fast
Stripping a body of bones and ligaments

His disability has made him a loner
Never talks, never sleeps
His worst nightmare, his own imagination
This beast will tear you apart
