[Lyrics: J. Jansson]

[Lead: Kjellgren]

In the darkened land of dreaming black
Our eyes of terror will slay you down
We strike as beast and deplore your souls
As you crawl on the floor of war

Chaos - On a violent soil
Tomorrow never know your final hell

We feed our lust with greed and hate
The sirens of war will peal again
Blood turns to black in the sorrow cold
We rape your flesh and march with pride

A killing spree on the fields of sorrow
We prepare the attack and kill your thrills
Behindthe screens of carnal hate
We come for you and sweep your legs

Bloodshed - On a hellish soil
Tomorrow never know your final existence

We feed our lust with greed and hate
The sirens of war will peal again
Blood turns to black in the sorrow cold
We rape your flesh and march with pride

Our burning peace is far beyond the black
On a violent soil you fear the men with demon wings
You feel the gloom behind the tears of bitter death
On a violent soil we dominate the floor of war

We feed our lust with greed and hate
We rape your flesh and march with pride

[Lead: Kjellgren]

In the darkened land of dreaming black
Our eyes of terror will slay you down
We strike as beast and deplore your souls
As you crawl on the floor of war

Chaos - On a violent soil
Tomorrow never know your final hell

We feed our lust with greed and hate
The sirens of war will peal again
Blood turns to black in the sorrow cold
We rape your flesh and march with pride
