[Lyrics: T. Berggren / M. Schulman]

They are kneeling around him, the emperor of deadly fate
They have come to join him, the master of brutal hate

Their eyes are filled with revenge, looking at the moon
Can you see their force, it's like the fire of doom

Black candles, the world is doomed
Gathered for war
The army of terror will bring forth the darkest death
Gathered for war

The darkness rises higher when they enter the unholy Grail
Further spread the message from the deepest pits of hell
The flames are burning red like the blood in their veins
Hatred and pure power when the demons enter the maze

Black candles, the world is doomed
Gathered for war
The army of terror will bring forth the darkest death
Gathered for war

The master chants;
"Gather all my souls, all souls of black,
You know what you came for"

"From far away we came - The demons harshly say
Here to spread the plague, to destroy the glory way"

Look at the demonic eyes and join the horde

[Lead: Kjellgren]

A mayhem - A torch of hate and grief
The master of chaos is here to bring relief

The darkness rises higher when they enter the unholy Grail
Further spread the message from the deepest pits of hell
The flames are burning red like the blood in their veins
Hatred and pure power when the demons enter the maze

Black candles, the world is doomed
Gathered for war
The army of terror will bring forth the darkest death
Gathered for war

Demonic warlust so deep - Spawned is the sacrilegious sleep
