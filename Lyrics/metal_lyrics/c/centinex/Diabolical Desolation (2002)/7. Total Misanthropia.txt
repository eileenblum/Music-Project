[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

[Lead: Wiklund / Kjellgren]

Darkness and warlust unleashed
We have destroyed the golden void
Sent to welcome the fear
Sent to crush the sparkling flames of hope

Hellish hatred is our infernal source
Mighty blasphemy gaines our sacred call
Into the darkside of a dream untold
Burning wrath and the seven bullets of joy

Total misanthropia - Total armageddon
Genocide and the rising crest for war

Words of light you whisper softly
From beyond we reveal the force
No forgivness nor human mercy
We rape and ruin your last shades of beauty

Total misanthropia - Total armageddon
Genocide and the rising crest for war

Our deeds - Will live on and on for centuries
With fear - You will look back and remember the deleted past
Forget your future - The nightmare is present, for now and forever
Global terror - We are here to carry out the final downfall

[Lead: Kjellgren / Wiklund]

Hellish hatred is our infernal source
Mighty blasphemy gaines our sacred call
Into the darkside of a dream untold
Burning wrath and the seven bullets of joy

Total misanthropia - Total armageddon
Genocide and the rising crest for war

Forget your future - Forget the disgusting words of love
Forget your life - Bury your dreams of eternal peace
