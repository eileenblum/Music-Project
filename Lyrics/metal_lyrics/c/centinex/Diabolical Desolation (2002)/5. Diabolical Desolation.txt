[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

In the night the undead forces cast their spell
Decease the light and embrace the infernal rites
Crush the sacred and spread the gloomy silence
Pure hate, lead the spirits of burning rage

Prophecies
A gathering of tales untold
Retaliate
Speak the words of blasphemy
Sacrifice
See the flames beyond the lies
Bloodlust
Await the day when happiness dies

Sodomize the silence
Evoke the misty darkness

The gates of hell
Are unlocked and open wide
Piece by piece
Tear apart the memories
Below the realms
Buried, forgotten, dead and gone
Genocide
With cold wrath it shall be done

Sodomize the silence
Evoke the misty darkness

Enjoy the grimness - Reveal the demons
Enlighten thy legions - Diabolical desolation

[Lead: Wiklund]

Vanish into afterlife
Obey the oneborn master
Breath strenght from the darkside
Like a neverending fire it burns

The gates of hell
Are unlocked and open wide
Piece by piece
Tear apart the memories
Below the realms
Buried, forgotten, dead and gone
Genocide
With cold wrath it shall be done

Sodomize the silence
Evoke the misty darkness

Enjoy the grimness - Reveal the demons
Enlighten thy legions - Diabolical desolation
