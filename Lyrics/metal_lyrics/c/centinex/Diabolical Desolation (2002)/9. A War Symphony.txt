[Lyrics: J. Jansson]

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Welcome inside my tomb and my heart of black
I am calling thy demons of war and let them all come to me
I have tasted the chalice of hate from the mighty legions beyond
I am crawling in the filthy mud with no more will to live

On my way through the deepest black
(I see) my sorrow angel spread its wings
Behind these bars of psychotic hate
I breath the hollow taste of death

Awake! - My demons of the damned
Arise! - My angels
...

I am in league with darkness and pain
My burden angel shows me the way
Through the shadows of sympathy
Inside my dreams of deadly wrath

Awake! - My demons of the damned
Arise! - My angels of the choir

A symphony in black
Inside my tomb of greed
My battle hymns of war
In my world of velvet sleep

Together we'll sing:
You tear me apart - Sin after sin
Nails in my heart - And I am the king
You rape my soul - Under your wings
Because I am the whore - That you can win

[Lead: Wiklund / Kjellgren]

On my way through the deepest black
(I see) my sorrow angel spread its wings
Behind these bars of psychotic hate
I breath the hollow taste of death

Awake! - My demons of the damned
Arise! - My angels of the choir

A symphony in black
Inside my tomb of greed
My battle hymns of war
In my world of velvet sleep

You tear me apart - Sin after sin
Because I am the whore - That you can win
