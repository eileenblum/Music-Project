[Lyrics: J. Jansson / M. Schulman]

The murder parade is back again
Filled with hate and shining eyes
Time for some action and killing pain
Beware of the squad before you die

Darkness and a hell of chaos
Violence upon the soil of sorrow
Hellspawned and eternal fire
On the bloodred fiels of forthcoming terror

Possessed by some hellish horror
Look out for some pure destruction
Welcome to a vicious depravation
Blissful desecration in the name of the flesh

Darkness and a hell of chaos
Violence upon the soil of sorrow
Hellspawned and eternal fire
On the bloodred fiels of forthcoming terror

Again we rise in this evil terror
Soul demise and the existence begins

Release the power before the dawn
Impurity will dominate the bloodsoaked grace

Achtung! - The enemy is coming closer
Tearing apart your golden illusions
Perkele! - Time to leave or kiss the steel
You will feel the predator hammer you down

[Lead: Wiklund]

The murder parade is back again
Filled with hate and shining eyes
Time for some action and killing pain
Beware of the squad before you die

Darkness and a hell of chaos
Violence upon the soil of sorrow
Hellspawned and eternal fire
On the bloodred fiels of forthcoming terror
