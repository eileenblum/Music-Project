[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Blood, grief, destruction
Bullets, agony, terror
Desecration, abomination, despair
Welcomes the warlords of hell

A burning inferno
The sky has turned to red
Infernal armageddon
An era of devastation
A stream of madness
The mighty forces of war
Spread their wings of fear
Sow the flames of fury

Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight

The smokescreen unfolds
The reality is scattered
A wasteland of ash
From north to south, from east to west
The kingdom once so proud
Was taken and conquered
The brigade moves on
Screams of anguish are left behind

Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Cruel ravishing slaughter
Like a horde of hungry wolves
Through seven days of terror
To endless nights of chaos

A burning inferno
The sky has turned to red
Infernal armageddon
An era of devastation
A stream of madness
The mighty forces of war
Spread their wings of fear
Sow the flames of fury

Mesmerize the hatebringer
Release the hellfire twilight

[Lead: Wiklund]
