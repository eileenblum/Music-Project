[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Kneel in front of me, obey me or forever bleed

Under the twilight moon
I search for the glorious truth
In the name of a thousand demons
I lead my scornful legions

Soulcrusher - The bringer of fear and pain
Soulcrusher - I desecrate your lifeflame

I cast a freezing spell
You are trapped in a living hell
With fear you will remember
You will never forget my name

Soulcrusher - The bringer of fear and pain
Soulcrusher - I desecrate your lifeflame

Kneel in front of me, obey me or forever bleed
I am the master of laceration, the father of pure damnation

With emptiness your eyes will see, my conquest, my victory

As I crawl from the fervent abyss
Bloodthirst takes over my soul
A burning kingdom welcomes me
I'm spawned by the infernal evil

Pure sweet insanity, from now on eternally

Under the twilight moon
I search for the glorious truth
In the name of a thousand demons
I lead my scornful legions

Soulcrusher - The bringer of fear and pain
Soulcrusher - I desecrate your lifeflame
