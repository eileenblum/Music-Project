[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

March towards damnation
Through a land laid to ash
Darkness has conquered
Every piece of light
A hellbrigade on the move
On a journey far, far east
No sign of light
The mission has succeed

We are,
Spawned to destroy - A chapter of chaos
Spawned to destroy - Total blasphemy and fear

Going fast forward
Troops passes by
The aim is to reach the target
Before the morning sun
Fires in the horizon
Lightens the path below
Chains and iron
Are art worth fighting for

We are,
Spawned to destroy - A chapter of chaos
Spawned to destroy - Total blasphemy and fear

Deadly attacks, deadly slaying force
Burning hate, endless rage
Taste the glory - feed the will
Feel the battle - seed the thrill

Honour, victory and pride
The tale shall forever remain

[Lead: Kjellgren]

March towards damnation
Through a land laid to ash
Darkness has conquered
Every piece of light
A hellbrigade on the move
On a journey far, far east
No sign of light
The mission has succeed

We are,
Spawned to destroy - A chapter of chaos
Spawned to destroy - Total blasphemy and fear

[Lead: Wiklund]

Destroy...
