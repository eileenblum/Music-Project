[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

People torn to pieces 
by the sword of God 
They are slaves to christianity 
when they drink your blood 
The punishment of death 
is a soul of torment 
Evil and Satan 
will win this for them 

Bells of misery 
Symphonies of hate 
Millions of corpses 
are showing your fate 

Total benediction 
Evil masturbation 
Gods inqusition 
Satans evokation 

The beginning of the end 
is a terror of darkness 
Your body will rot 
You can't help them now 

The time has come 
to unleash the evil 
and roasted flesh 
is the smell behind us
