[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

Bleeding shadows in the dark 
whisper silently to you 
Follow your mind 
through eternal times 

"As long as the sun burns red will 
we continue our journey" 

To the temple of memories 
where our souls dwell with joy 
Even when death tear us 
Even when death tear us apart
