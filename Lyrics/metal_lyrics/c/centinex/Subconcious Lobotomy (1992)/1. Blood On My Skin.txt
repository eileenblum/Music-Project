[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

Death will arise from the altar 
Piece by piece you fall 
Feel the disgrace 
It penetrates into your skin 
The suffering will arise 
I laugh when all the gods die 

Dead down in a wooden coffin 
Mutilated organs in blood 
Sons of the evil baphomet 
Rot in the light of the sun 

I carve through your eyes 
You are bleeding from inside 
Tearing apart your soul 
Insanity and disgrace grows 
Blood paints the sky 
Shiver as they cry 
I'm loosing my morbid mind 
I live like I died 

Pray for them who have given their 
immortal souls unto satan 
For each is damned to relive that 
wretched life through 
all times 

Left to bleed 
You can't see 
Can't you feel 
the pain so deep 
Touching your flesh 
Caressing it gently 
Crawling on the ground 
Your common sense is bound 
Crying corroded tears 
Praying for the other side 
See the evil in my eyes 
Take my hand and follow me to 
paradise 

Blood oh help me heal my skin 
Excruciated illusions live within 
Falling apart with your sins 
Morbidity lives I will win 

I let your organs decay 
Die the inhuman way 
Hacking your bleeding limbs 
The darkside of life arise
