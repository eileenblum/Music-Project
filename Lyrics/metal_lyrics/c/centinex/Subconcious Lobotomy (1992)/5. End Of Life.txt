[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

A pile of rancid flesh 
A piece of rotten meat 
This is all I see 
You will fall asleep 

Slash your face and cranium 
Crack your trachea and your face 
I bare my fist through your stomach 
and laugh when the scream disappears 

The smell from your fried eyes 
really make me high 
I drink the juice from your lungs 
A rancid coctail of life 

I'm a psychedelic murderer 
who will skin my victims alive 
put their tender flesh in my mouth 
and eat ruptured kiddneys for fun 

Maggots surrounding your body 
I'd love to see you die 
They eat you from inside 
A grotesque end of life 

Suck out your blood 
The rotten remains I eat 
I lick your dismembered organs 
and the septic mush from your feet 

Maggots surrounding... 

Suck out your... 

Time has come 
to end your life 
You will now 
suffer and die 

Slash your face... 

The smell from your... 

I'm a psychedelic...
