[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

In a sea of blood 
People of sorrow 
find their hell 
Their purulent minds decay 

Ocean of the dead 
Evil trepidation 
Eviscerate the corpses 
Morbid devastation 

After the holy massacre 
rotten limbs are floating by 

Evocation of aspiration 
steaming sacrifice 
oppressor of human race 
The demigod shall arise 

The wind from the upturned graves 
Aspiration of darkness 
Those who survived 
will fall to pieces (or die in hell) 

Ocean of the dead 
Evil trepidation 
Eviscerate the corpses 
Morbid devastation 
Hear the angels cry 
Now the suffering 
has came to its end 

Evocation of aspiration 
steaming sacrifice 
oppressor of human race 
The demigod shall arise
