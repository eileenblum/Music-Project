[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

I have found the pleasure in life 
Trequent with the dead 
I love their devoted eyes 
They never tell me lies 

I crush the corpses 
Crawl on the graves 
The smell of death 
fill my lungs 

I crush the corpses 
Crawl on their graves 
The smell of death 
fill my lungs 

Tear up your organs 
Eating the remains 
Suck your stinking fingers 
Soon I will be fed 

Feel the mush upon my lips 
Taste the septic bacteria 
Rotten buried dead 
Soon I will be fed 

The maggots dwell on your skin 
I rip your lovely skull 
Your flesh putrid and rotten 
I have found the pleasure in life 

Tear up your organs 
Eating the ramains 
Suck your stinking fingers 
Soon I will be fed 

I have found the pleasure in life 
Frequent with the dead 
I love their devoted eyes 
They never tell me lies
