[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

Cry of torture 
Victim of pain 
Darkness and evil 
smash your head 

Far beyond 
children scream 
Hear their voices 
in your dream 

Lord of power 
rip your soul 
Slaves of torment 
cut your bones 
Destroy your hopes 
Cruch your mind 
Take your dreams 
and die with them 

Destroy your... 

Death comes ripping and takes you away 
In your own dreams you feel the pain 
Night of the unborn is here to stay 
Beg for freedom on your last day 

Death comes ripping...
