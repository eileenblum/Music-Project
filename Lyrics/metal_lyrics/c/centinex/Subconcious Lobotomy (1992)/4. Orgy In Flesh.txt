[Music: Martin &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Martin]

Mutilated cadavers decay 
through your bleeding eyes 
Organs are drowned in mush 
I dispatch your unclean pus 
Suffer - you die 
Decomposed - with fear 
Awaiting to die in void 

I eat my lunch 
with a smile on my face 
Maggots in my soup 
What a charming taste 

I rape the cadaver 
Orgy in flesh 
I maltreat her brain 
Her body feels so fresh 

You should be dead 
consume your brain 
A blood-dripping funeral 
as limbs rot and swell 

Embalmed in entrails 
Infected corpses torn 
The septic flesh will shrink 
The mass of maggots crawl 
Pursue your scarly existense 
as the evil blood flows free 
Fragments from your open stomach 
with a sickly unhealthy disease 
Viscid fluid - is flowing 
A brutal death - is your end 

Mutilated cadavers decay 
through your bleeding eyes 
Organs are drowned in mush 
I dipatch your unclean pus 
Suffer - you die 

Putrid mush 
on my fingertips 
Mangled genitals 
when I lick my lips 

I rape the cadaver... 

A splattered carnage 
with some soggy flesh 
Infected juices 
What a lovely mess 
Embalmed in entrails 
Infected corpses torn 
The septic flesh will shrink 
The mass of maggots crawl 
Pursue your scarly existence 
as the evil blood flows free 
Fragments from your open stomach 
with a sickly unhealthy disease 

Pursue your scarly existense 
as the evil blood flows free 
Fragments from your open stomach 
with a sickly unhealthy disease 

Embalmed in entrails 
Infected corpses torn 
The septic flesh will shrink 
The mass of maggots crawl
