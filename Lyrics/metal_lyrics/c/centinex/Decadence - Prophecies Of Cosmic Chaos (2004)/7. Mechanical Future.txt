[Like puppets in a stigmatized supernova]

[Lyrics: J. Ahlberg]

Since the beginning of time, forced into this world
We all got programmed to not see the truth
Over the lapse of several years
We were destined to destroy ourselves

We were built to obey - the masterminds of the game
A million lives to fade
Like puppets and machines - we lost all of our control
We are waiting for our vacuous death

He waited for so long to make the end begin
Thousands of years of massdestruction
Thousands of years of genocide

We were built to obey - the masterminds of the game
A million lives to fade
Just be glad if you're dead - when the dark will arise
A silent deathblow to mankind

The world has faced the final end
Mechanical future is here - rejected humans everywhere
The world has faced the final truth
It's not a dream - it's cruel bitter reality

The final chapter of mankind
Thousands bursting into pieces
Thousands of years of massdestruction
Thousands of years of genocide

We were built to obey - the masterminds of the game
A million lives to fade
Just be glad if you're dead - when the dark will arise
A silent deathblow to mankind

The world has faced the final end
Mechanical future is here - rejected humans everywhere
The world has faced the final truth
It's not a dream - it's cruel bitter reality
We are all puppets in a stigmatized supernova
We are the scapegoats in the new world order
Mechanical future - The perfect warfare against ourselves
Mechanical future - The time is here when our minds are erased

Since the beginning of time, forced into this world
We all got programmed to not see the truth
Over the lapse of several years
We were destined to destroy ourselves

We were built to obey - the masterminds of the game
A million lives to fade
Like puppets and machines - we lost all of our control
We are waiting for our vacuous death

The world has faced the final end
Mechanical future is here - rejected humans everywhere
The world has faced the final truth
It's not a dream - it's cruel bitter reality
