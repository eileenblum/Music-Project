[Welcome the leader of divine domination]

[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Into oblivion, into a void of chaos
Gaze upon a circle of fire
Everlasting elements of innocence
Are transformed by the terrestrial silence

When will the rain turn to dust
When will white turn to black

This is the arrival - The dreamlike decay of mankind
Born with a reaping roam - A shapeless spectrum obscure

From here to beyond and back
Forward with the speed of light
Trapped within the walls of infinity
Decadence reigns in the halls of eternity

When will the rain turn to dust
When will white turn to black

This is the arrival - The dreamlike decay of mankind
Born with a reaping roam - A shapeless spectrum obscure

Upon the day and night of nothingness
Calmness is left and forever will

Prophecies of a fading dawn
Reveal the glorious masterplan
There will be no future
No future there will be...

Into oblivion, into a void of chaos
Gaze upon a circle of fire
Everlasting elements of innocence
Are transformed by the terrestrial silence

When will the rain turn to dust
When will white turn to black

This is the arrival - The dreamlike decay of mankind
Born with a reaping roam - A shapeless spectrum obscure
