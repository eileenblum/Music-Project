[Fast forward towards astral devastation]

[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

As stars and spheres collide
Like embers in a infernal gloom
The universe once so pure and clean
Turns into everlasting fire

The spiritual kingdoms divide
This is the entrance to doom
The past the present the future
Gone in a cosmic destruction

Come join me, come join me on the new world odyssey
Come along, come along on a dark ride lasting for a lifetime

Into the arms of death
Into the crypts of vanity
The echoes dance until the end
Recall the shadows again and again

I who hold the sights
I who rule the night
Revel in joyful desire
Welcome to my spiral empire

Come join me, come join me on the new world odyssey
Come along, come along on a dark ride lasting for a lifetime

Summon the screams of thunder
When dimensions fall asunder
Deep below decolourised halls
As the bell of revelation calls

Higher fire - flames of profane desire
The last whispers - from a stillborn quire
Illusions in the glare - of heavenly blaze
A venomous kiss - like a mysterious haze

Into the arms of death
Into the crypts of vanity
The echoes dance until the end
Recall the shadows again and again

I who hold the sights
I who rule the night
Revel in joyful desire
Welcome to my spiral empire

Come join me, come join me on the new world odyssey
Come along, come along on a dark ride lasting for a lifetime
