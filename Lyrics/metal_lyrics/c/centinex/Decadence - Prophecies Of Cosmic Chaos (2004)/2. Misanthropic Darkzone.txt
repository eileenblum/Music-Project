[The ultimate voyage of spiritual terror]

[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Taste and inhale the divine electric air
Breathe in, breathe out, (and) breathe in again in ecstasy
Forget the enigma and close your shattered eyes
Exhale and descend as happiness dies...

Born then reborn in a timeless sphere
Where mournful flames feed the forsaken
Carried away by the arms and minds of madness
When giving birth to the powers of sadness

Hail hail hail - computerized
Hail hail hail - stigmatized
Obey obey obey - you will be dehumanized

Free your mind and enter the pincode of life
Cross the bridge and await the crucial answer
Blistering thunder replaces the hours spent
Everlasting pain here from the future sent

Hail hail hail - computerized
Hail hail hail - stigmatized
Obey obey obey - you will be dehumanized

Forget the enigma and close your shattered eyes
Exhale and descend as the stairways to happiness dies

Step inside, step inside the labyrinth
Grab the rope follow it until the end
Take your thoughts and reflect your desire
Escape and enjoy the black terrestrial fire

Hail hail hail - computerized
Hail hail hail - stigmatized
Obey obey obey - you will be dehumanized
