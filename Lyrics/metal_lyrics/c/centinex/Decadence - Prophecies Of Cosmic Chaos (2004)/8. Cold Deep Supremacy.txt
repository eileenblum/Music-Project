[Taste the truth of the final end]

[Lyrics: J. Jansson]

From the anguish sphere far astray
The centurian beast arrives
Injecting demonic seeds of vengeance
Bringing forth glorious pain

Forgotten grapes of wrath in mind
Astral souls follow the sign

It's time to taste the cold deep supremacy
Can you feel the cold deep supremacy

The gyral gods are welcomed
A new universal order is set
Prepare yourself for the scornful rage
The centurian beast has arrived

Forgotten grapes of wrath in mind
Astral souls follow the sign

It's time to taste the cold deep supremacy
Can you feel the cold deep...
Traumatic reactions - neurotic fractions
Dysfunctional humans paralysed
It's time to taste the cold deep supremacy

Like a tornado the master spreads anger and fury
Shatter your hopes of never-ending glory

From the anguish sphere far astray
The centurian beast arrives
Injecting demonic seeds of vengeance
Bringing forth glorious pain

Forgotten grapes of wrath in mind
Astral souls follow the sign

It's time to taste the cold deep supremacy
Can you feel the cold deep...
Traumatic reactions - neurotic fractions
Dysfunctional humans paralysed
It's time to taste the cold deep supremacy
