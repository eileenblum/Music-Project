[Follow the leading star, follow the magic light]

[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

I look into your sparkling eyes
As the raindrops fall asunder
I reach out and touch the sky
And behold the everlasting thunder
Systematic seduction - sinful redemption
You are the everburning deathstar unmasked

You brought me back to life
You saved my heart that cried
You rescued me as one through life
And love until the end of time
With you I am alive...

Like stars embracing the nightsky
We head on a journey we never have seen
A trip to a sphere where time stands still
To a world that forever ours will be
Systematic seduction - sinful redemption
You are the everburning deathstar unmasked

You brought me back to life
You saved my heart that cried
You rescued me as one through life
And love until the end of time
With you I am alive...

You are the river - the river of divine eternity
Your touch will make me shiver and follow my soul eternally

You are the everburning deathstar unmasked

You brought me back to life
You saved my heart that cried
You rescued me as one through life
And love until the end of time
You brought me back to life
You rescued me as one through life
With you I am alive!
