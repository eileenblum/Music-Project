[Your destiny is written in a pitchblack hole]

[Lyrics: M. Schulman]

Dive into the world of pain
A rising dominion completely insane

A pitch-black hole, a deadly darkened tomb
A place where the shadows never will dwell
Secrets are hidden deep within the walls
The mystery will be immortal as the silent nightmare recall

Hollowsphere - dive into the world of pain
Hollowsphere - fade away and decay in vain

Falling down, falling into the abyss
Crawling among the purulent ones
Your destiny is here real and true
Your hidden inner fears are slowly coming through

Hollowsphere - dive into the world of pain
Hollowsphere - fade away and decay in vain

Round and round in circles
Catch the moment inside
Step into Armageddon
Where the light never will shine

As the sun no longer rises
Reality will turn to dust
As the stones have become powder
The forsaken ones are reborn with lust

A pitch-black hole, a deadly darkened tomb
A place where the shadows never will dwell
Secrets are hidden deep within the walls
The mystery will be immortal as the silent nightmare recall

Hollowsphere - dive into the world of pain
Hollowsphere - fade away and decay in vain
Hollowsphere - dive into the world of pain
Hollowsphere - a rising dominion completely insane
