[Target locked, await supreme fear]

[Lyrics: J. Jansson]

Serpent whispers beyond the sun
Nocturnal gates - devours the light
Synchronic vortex above the stars
Twisted forms - out of sight
Black holes surrounds the human race
We're connected and forlorn
Beyond deep astral stars
We're sworn into this world

When the shadows falls like curtains in the skies
Supersonic thrills bursts under our skin
When the curtains falls like velvet silver rain
We're swallowed into: Target dimension XII

We are connected - We are rejected

Unforeseen spheres take control
We're out in space and transformed
Giant vapours spins in circles
We're in the system of supreme fear

When the shadows falls like curtains in the skies
Supersonic thrills bursts under our skin
When the curtains falls like velvet silver rain
We're swallowed into: Target dimension XII

We're forced into this new dimension
Leaving mother earth behind
Subdivided planet eruption
Our synthetic existence denied

We are doomed...

Black holes surrounds the human race
We're connected and forlorn
Beyond deep astral stars
We're sworn into this world

When the shadows falls like curtains in the skies
Supersonic thrills bursts under our skin
When the curtains falls like velvet silver rain
We're swallowed into: Target dimension XII
