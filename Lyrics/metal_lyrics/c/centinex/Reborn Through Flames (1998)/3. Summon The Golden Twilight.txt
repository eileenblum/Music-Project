[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Bloodthirst reflects my freezing hunger
Shadows are born in a twilight fire
Tyrants lusting at the castle
The final chapter is to be undead

We are the infernal horde
Demonic souls we spawn
Through the storming wasteland
We proudly ride onward
Winds of ghostly skies
Hymns from the ancient ones
Spirits of our loved ones
Embrace our golden darkside

Summon the golden twilight
Gather the dark legions
Once we were born immortal
In the halls of hatred we belong

The dark age has risen
Thus we are eternal
Beneath the unspoken desire
Towards the enthroned master

The night and the moon
Brings me the power
As I enter the storm
And the gates of frost

Summon the golden twilight
Gather the dark legions
Once we were born immortal
In the halls of hatred we belong

Foretold are the burning visions
Retaliation is the living truth
Scornful silence descending
We are the lords of salvation

In the blaze of seven candles
In the shadow of the flaming moon
In a time of death and darkness
Everlasting visions reborn

We are the infernal horde
Demonic souls we spawn
Through the storming wasteland
We proudly ride onward
Infernal is the mission
Eternal is our path
In the realm of a dark kingdom
Our hearts breathe forever

Summon the golden twilight
Gather the dark legions
Once we were born immortal
In the halls of hatred we belong
