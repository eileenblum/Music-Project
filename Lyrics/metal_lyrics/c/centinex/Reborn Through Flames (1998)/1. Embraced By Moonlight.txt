[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Our dream became reality as we enter the path of mourning
The dark lord, our master, we follow the way foretold

We are spawned by chaos
Reborn through desaster
By nightfall we enter
Your soul with purest hate
A burning revenge
Will fall deep within
In the blaze of a black moon
We purify the infested ones

Embraced by moonlight
Embraced by mighty darkness
Enchanted through malice
In blasphemy we dwell

Burning like a candle
Caress the moonlight shadow
Forsaken and forgotten
Taste this dark reunion
Through domains of blasphemy
We are the only emperors
For now and forever
We are embraced by (thy) mighty darkness

Embraced by moonlight
Embraced by mighty darkness
Enchanted through malice
In blasphemy we dwell

The demons dawn has arrived
Desecrate the house of god
Hear the pray, hear the chant
The call for the feeble son

The darkened slaughter, a blessing ritual
Cover the crucifix with blood
The holy father nailed to the altar
Torn are the christian lies

Hear the ghosts in a forest left behind
Like in ancient times they spread their deepest fear
Come and lead us to the empire of creation
Eternally satanized, in blood we are immortalised

We are spawned by chaos
Reborn through desaster
By nightfall we enter
Your soul with purest hate
A burning revenge
Will fall deep within
In the blaze of a black moon
We purify the infested ones

Embraced by moonlight
Embraced by mighty darkness
Enchanted through malice
In blasphemy we dwell
