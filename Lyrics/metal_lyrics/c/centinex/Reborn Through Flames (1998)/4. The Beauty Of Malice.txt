[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Looking through the crystal ball
See the future in the painted glass
Inside the soul of a haunted one
Spirits of darkness raving in grief

In silent tears they close their eyes
Memories of blinded despair
Within the dreams of slumber loss
Memories of forsaken memories
The magic light is flaming bright
Lost in the shadows of a dead red sky
Illusions drown in a sea of sorrow
We are the force of the darkened malice

The beauty of neverending malice
The beauty of spirits forever gone

A journey through time and memories
On a path towards the hills astray
Reflections wither into the atmosphere
Beneath black fire and sinking stars

In silent tears they close their eyes
Memories of blinded despair
Within the dreams of slumber loss
Memories of forsaken memories

Looking through the crystal ball
See the past in the painted glass
Haunted shadows welter in blood
We are the force of the darkened malice

The beauty of neverending malice
The beauty of spirits forever gone

Embraced by endless horror
Fragments left by bleeding scars
Sinking slow to the gloomy abyss
The beauty of malice forever immortal
