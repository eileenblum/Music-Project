[Music: Wiklund]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

A dominion of twilight anguish
Born are the sons of darkness
Temptation is a sombre hunger
Prevail the ancient divinity

In the glare of the golden woods
Breath the lusting blood dawn
Hellfire centuries
Resurrected through metal and steel

Burn this soul of the seventh one
In the past together we ride
From time to time in a dying realm
Unleash my strength and set me free

In the glare of the golden woods
Breath the lusting blood dawn
Hellfire centuries
Resurrected through metal and steel

Terror and pleasure is thy name
My eyes - the elements of hatred
As the bleeding years decay
The echo from my soulvoice returns
Raise the kingdom tower
Bring the sign of torment
With the spirit of doom
Sorrow is the final resurrection

In a cirlce on a path of time
Travel beyond the silent seas
In mourning I open my eyes
and search for the darkest tranquillity

In the glare of the golden woods
Breath the lusting blood dawn
Hellfire centuries
Resurrected through metal and steel

In pain, in death, I'm the sign
The sign of the antichrist
