[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

In the skies of the twilight
A millenium of chaos, in the land forlorn
The purest hate unleashed
As I'm the reaper of everything that is holy

I gather my bloodlusting forces
Spawned by the slaughter
Devastate the feeble ones
Crush the holy ground
A bloodbath beneath the dark moon

Raise the flames higher
On the path through the night
My scornful laugh echoes
As the sword swings, (I hear) a scream from the impaled

I spit on your christian ground
I split your enormous lies
I rape and ruin your holy land
I am bloodfreezing devastation

Raging into a deep red battle
The third storm is raising high
The dark dominion is final
As we are gathered forever

I spit on your christian ground
I split your enormous lies
I rape and ruin your holy land
I am bloodfreezing devastation

Revelation - Total destruction and despair
Desaster - Breathing the fear of the wind
Slaughter - Torn are your illusions
Soulrape - Supreme neverending art

Blood flows red from the weak

The season of the ancient
Feed my possessed horde
Stabbing the christian lambs
Raping the whiteblinded whores

The human darkness recalls
The reign of death I follow
A revenge in my subconsciousness
We summon the eternal kingdom

I spit on your christian ground
I split your enormous lies
I rape and ruin your holy land
I am bloodfreezing devastation
