[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

With gloomy tears in my eyes
I lift away, on and on I fly
The coldest breeze of all winternights
Freezes my blood, I am gone

Sorrow above my soul
Deep inside my mind a wind so cold
My journey leads to nowhere
I will wander towards the loneliness

Shadows - I seek for the land of sin
The land beyond - where the moon captures the stars
Grab my soul - lead me through the past
Cut my wings - Thy we are summoned

Through celestial gates I fly
Like a lonely eagle, the one with wisdom and pride
Black tears of blood I cry
My longing for temptation I hide

Shadows - I seek for the land of sin
The land beyond - where the moon captures the stars
Grab my soul - lead me through the past
Cut my wings - Thy we are summoned

From the sea, a storm and a haunted ghost
With visions so clear and memories of a time to come

Like a lonely northern star
I weap the sky and caress the ground
Prince of darkness, moon of sorrow,
lead me towards the trees

I travel back centuries,
where the nocturnal wind breathes eternally
Far beyond known mortality, into a deep dark infinity

Travel with the fire
A flame which heals my mind, a frozen cloud
My mistress of desire
My princess, my darkened light

Shadows - I seek for the land of sin
The land beyond - where the moon captures the stars
Grab my soul - lead me through the past
Cut my wings - Thy we are summoned
