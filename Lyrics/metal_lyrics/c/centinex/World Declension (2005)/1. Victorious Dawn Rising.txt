[Lyrics: Schulman, Lead: Kjellgren]

This void born long ago is cold and silent
Five rings of decadence strikes deep and deadly
Bodies covered up with thick melting liquid
Blizzards reign supreme in this world and beyond
Hail the order, never weak nor speechless
Hail the order, one and one with power
Surrounded by rapture, harvest with the king of pain
The elite will always purify as blood runs deep then slip away
From the wooden innocent cradle to the metallic sinful coffin
(We are) doomed to walk this earth among the feeble mass of lies
Victorious dawn rising - Into a starless orbit
Victorious dawn rising - Forever it shall be
