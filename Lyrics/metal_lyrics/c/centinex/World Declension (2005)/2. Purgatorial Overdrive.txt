[Lyrics: Danielsson / Schulman, Lead: Kjellgren]

Creatures crawls up from the deep
Mother earth have summon them up
Waking them from their eternal sleep
The end and the purgatory has begun
The cleansing of this human plague
Earth elementals, divine power supreme
A force so ancient, a force so free
Fiery flames from below increase
On this tormented twisted soil
The blood of the mortals will flow
Their souls will be forever damned
Forever to be forgotten, lost in a void
The prophecies of disaster - They all shall come true
For our sins and evil doings - Deeds decayed and impure
The pathway to oblivion is open wide
The tormenting fires of hell shall burn
Purgatorial overdrive
The seventh seal has been broken
