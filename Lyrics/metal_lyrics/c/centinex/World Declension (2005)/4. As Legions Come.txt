[Lyrics: Danielsson / Schulman, Lead: Ahlberg / Kjellgren]

Crossing the rubicon
Will we stand up tall
The dreadful black water
Will we fail and fall
Crossing the river styx
For our sins we will die
This dark water of hate
Lays beneath your filthy soul
Fallen is our loved ones, returned to the soil
Surviving is not easy in this mortal coil
As legions come - Tainted is our curse
As legions come - Bringing forth the hearse
Crossing the seas of blood
Our faith in hope is gone
Trampled under foot
Could this be undone
Crossing the cesspool of filth
Rotting flesh, scorched earth
Soon we all be gone
Given the new ones, birth
