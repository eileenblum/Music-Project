[Lyrics: Kjellgren, Lead: Ahlberg]

We are diving into the deepest abyss known to man
It is time to reveal the truth of all the obscure
Unable to wake up from your everlasting nightmare
Armageddon is coming closer, soon we will die but until we do...
Turn to hate - Make them our enemies
The beast of Hades - Dwells inside of me
I praise the destruction, the human race will never be free
Spending our lives searching, ending up in caskets anyway
I will tear your world apart, nothing left to save
This is the final offer, there is no turning back at all
Riding on the crystal sky fed by the hellbound fire
Victimized since the day of birth, (the) destroyer will tear apart the earth
