[Lyrics: TB / Schulman, Lead: Ahlberg]

Listen to this story of my dark frustrations
Light up the candles in silent recollection
I am free - I can see - I will lead - Blood I need
Wretched cut - Show me your lust
Wretched cut - Turn you to dust
Revealed black demons standing on their knees
Now I soon escape through a cosmic breeze
My plan is now constructed, blueprints for war
Sinners follow me, not alone anymore
I start a new journey of pain and hatred
I smell my own soul, the bitter taste of death
Violence and horror is what you all feel
Come to me sinners, come forward and kneel
Now we take the path to far away beyond
The world is on fire, brighter and higher
Let us all be gathered like sinners in a wind
Rape and ruin this earth, we will forever win
