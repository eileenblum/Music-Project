[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Slowly I'm watching her die 
A fixed look in her eyes 
You bleed as I see 
Her soul fade with fear 

She shall suffer - I will slain 
This is my obligation - only 
Bleeding slices remains 

A torrent of blood 
Goagulate on my hands 
Slowly the innards decay 
Festering flesh beneath my nails 
A sick subhuman reality 

I slice her infected corpse 
Grinding and carving the flesh 
Are my hands doing this crime 
Or is it just dreams in my 
Satanic mind 
In the name of the holy god 
I tear the heart out 
Hacking her bleeding organs 
And cover my body with pieces 
Turn her body inside out 
Compeled to die 
The spirit dwell in a sanctum 
Forsaken with lies 

You have finaly found your peace 
Beyond the gates of silence 
You will never ever lie again 
As you sleep in the land of ice 

You have finaly... 

Forever laid to rest 
Ashes to ashes - dust to flesh 
My obscene dreams came true 
Only bleeding slices remains 

A torrent of blood 
Goagulate on my hands 
Slowly the innards decay 
Festering flesh beneath my nails 
A sick subhuman reality 

I slice her infected corpse 
Grinding and carving the flesh 
Are my hands doing this crime 
Or is it just dreams in my 
Sardonic mind
