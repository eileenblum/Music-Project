[Music: Schulman]
[Lyrics: Schulman]

Tombstones made of flesh 
Out in the stream of blood 
Forever to be gone 
And the memories flow away 
Beyond the gates of silence 
I'm torn forever 

Suffering - bleeding wounds 
Deformed being 
Silent decay 

Let me sleep forever 
Let me vanish in peace 
Save me from this hell 
To the eternity in my dreams 

Amorphous pile of skulls 
Human life condamned 
A crucifix of sacred bones 
Final peace evokated 

Take me far away 
My soul wants to rest 
"I am blinded by the grief 
Let me be dead, forever" 

Evil absorption of hopes 
Creeping smell of rottingness 
The deceased sinners in catacombs 
Funeral for the screaming mortals 

The path through illusions 
Sacrificed souls dissever 
Tombstones made of flesh 
A graveyard of mangled limbs 
Out in the stream of blood 
My life will be vanished 
Dissolved piece by piece 
Under the freezing moon
