So there they stood
On a mountain, revealing their wisdom
While taking in all that earth had to give to them
And what it hid, secrets that shadows of time concealed

What if when they saw burning stars
They thought it was a gift from beyond far
Look close between the lines
Beyond what you believe to be real
Are they just theories of time

Behold the tooth of yesterday
It holds the truth to set you free
From history some live their lives

Not long ago we looked at power as just a vision
To shatter dark with just a beam of light
It might be worth to take a close look at infinity
