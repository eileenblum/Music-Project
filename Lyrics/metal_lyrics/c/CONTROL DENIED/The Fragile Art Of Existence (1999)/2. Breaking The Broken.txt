I saw you, you saw me, you hid your fangs so well
I should have known better but it is hard to tell
In beauty the evil is waiting for possession
Deep inside reflections just a glimpse away

Your faithful servents, they bow to you
Together they're breaking the broken
We were set free, what is to be?
When its all said and done what is left to really say?
To be one turns to none now we are just yesterday

You speak in killing words, the kind that crush and kill
No mercy your pleasure to taste the blood you bled
The chase has ended in denial of glory
To trap and add to your servant souls
