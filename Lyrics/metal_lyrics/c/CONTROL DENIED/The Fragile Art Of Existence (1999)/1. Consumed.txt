Your face is hiding deep inside my mind
Your touch is on my tongue
Your face is the deepest depths of my eyes
The eyes inside my soul

Once I was free, but now I am trapped
Once I was trapped, but now I am free

I taste the tears you bled
I felt the fears you shed
You thought I did not feel
You thought I could not taste

Consumed, escape through dreams
Consumed, trapped by dreams
Consumed, forever it seems

Do you feel the pain that I feel?
The pain that lives inside
Do you wear the chains that I wear
The ones that rub me raw

Every time it is the same three words
Every time the number speaks
And when you see me and you think I am there
You will know that it is just a dream
