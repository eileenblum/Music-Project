A tool to do good has gone bad
Electric altar for a new religion

A new way to link
A new way to think
Individual thoughts that have become missing

Laugh at my words you fool
They will soon become living truth
Look at yourself in the mirror
Reflection is living proof

What will they do when the link they live becomes missing?
Will they survive?
When the link they breathe becomes missing

When we see the face of evil
It will be the demon reality
