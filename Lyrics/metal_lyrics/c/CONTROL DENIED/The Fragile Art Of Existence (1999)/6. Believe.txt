Do you believe what some might say can't be could be reality
Let seven be the one for me; six chapters of life laced with mystery...
Awaiting discovery

Immune you become a war to be won the soul of a voice...
Let the voice of the soul be free

For most it does not come easily
For some it comes with pain
From a thought to a living sight
For some it's a life for some a game

There are things in life worth fighting for
And some things are better off let go
A dream secured long ago or yesterday
Close to the top there's no looking down

When you believe
Do you believe?
If you believe
You must believe!

If I was paid for disappointments I would be a wealthy man
The magic lives in sincerity, in truth, behind the
thoughts I choose to stand...
Awaiting discovery
