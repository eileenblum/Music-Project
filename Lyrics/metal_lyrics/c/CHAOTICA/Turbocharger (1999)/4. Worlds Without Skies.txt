I've opened my eyes, here's what I saw -There is no
sky, and no stars at all. Alone by myself, surrounded
by fear, my only friend is my falling tear. So alone I
will pray for someone to see, that worlds without
skies exist only in me. If I cried out loud, what
could I say? I'd call out for hope, but hope's gone
away. I stretch out my hand, but no one is there, and
if someone was, I doubt they would care. So alone I
will pray for someone to see, that worlds without
skies exist only in me.
