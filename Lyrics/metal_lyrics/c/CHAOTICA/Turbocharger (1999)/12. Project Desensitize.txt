Homogenous chess pawns, Brainwashed and mechanized.
Individualism has been desensitized. Desensitize,
Desensitize! One by one they're lined up, Lemmings
ready to dive. Programmed society; Slave-like ants in
this hive. Android-like people of this assembly line,
Thoughtless zombies obey dictators of their minds.
Homogenous chess pawns, Brainwashed and mechanized.
Individualism has been desensitized.
