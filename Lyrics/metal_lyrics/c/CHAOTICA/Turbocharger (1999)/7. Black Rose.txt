That thorny twisted piece of nature that is always
there, That haunting figment of life that causes total
despair. Weaving in and around your life like a
parasite, It's starting to take control, you have to
stand up and fight. The Black Rose wants you to cry,
The Black Rose wants you to die, The Black Rose yearns
for your anguish, The Black Rose wants you to perish.
The Black Rose commands your actions as if you were a
slave, Die with this evil force and it'll follow you
to your grave. You can't heal your scars so your heart
will continue to bleed, It just grows stronger and
taller like an eternal weed. Life being extracted from
your very heart and soul, Leaving but emptiness to
fill that dark hole. This Black Rose does not feed on
water sunlight or soil, 'Cause it indulges in your
mournfulness and turmoil. Finally an answer emerges to
end these fears, A special person whom you love can
wipe away your tears. But no one wants to love someone
who has all of this pain, So the Black Rose will
continue to drive you insane.
