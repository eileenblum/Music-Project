You are the screw in my side, You are the fear that I
hide, You are the darkness inside, You are the hate
that never died. You are the poison in the pill, You
are the blood about to spill, You are the pain I have
to drill! Spins around through your head, Penetrates
'til you're dead. Burrows through, makes the kill,
Choose your gun, choose your drill! You are the virus
in my brain, You make my sanity insane, You are the
toxin in my vein, You are the source of all my pain.
You are the poison in the pill, You are the blood
about to spill, You are the pain I have to drill!
