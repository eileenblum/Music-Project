Horrific fragments I think
May form the whole
Or absolute goodness causes a war
No conclusion at all
The choice is up to whom
Neither others nor to you

Thousand years of fighting
Expectations and the tears
The darkness or the light
You will resist or abide

Life is like a mirror
Reverses what you see
Joy is turning to horror
You can never flee away

If darkness frightens
Then why do you sleep within...

Just like a delicate prostitude
You can find that hard to see
Abusive saints all around
Define to what you need

Just take a look inside
Behind your frozen mask
By your blinded foresight
Tear your soul apart

That's the true question
Taking life or give it back
Don't you think of all the answers
When death is close at hand

If darkness frightens
Then why do you sleep within...
