Red dawn at the gates of the agean sea
Welcomes the glory and death
Both sides are come across
And now they are all ready to
Set the world on fire

Arsenals of hellfire landing
At the shores of inferno
War cries are mixing to roar of the gunshots
Rising scream welcomes the death

Seems like a mass suicide
End of a generation
Imposed for the survival of the future
Baptised by fire

Trenches decorate just like the
Graves for the sons of nations
Five hundred thousand brave men
Ready to death to get lost in the myst

Brave sons of the brave nations
Rest in peace forever, hail to you all...

Half they fight the fortune at hand
Half is ready to death for homeland
With the first bullet and the first death
All hopes are caught under crossfire

Who could dare to give up fighting
Waiting for the end that is approaching
Soldiers are side by side cry for the same god
Creeping means now glory and pride

Brave sons of the brave nations
Rest in peace forever, hail to you all...
