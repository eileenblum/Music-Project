Once I had you,
You have been changing me
There is no way out
You won't sent me free
I lost my way by typical betray
Is it the end or is it half the way

You ruined me
You made me bleed
And you turned my life
Into some kind of shit
Make use of it...

As the days passed by
My life has turned to black
No reason why and
Now I want you back
Ever since you left
I tried to punish you
When I get my chance
I'm gonna fuck you too

You ruined me
You made me bleed
And you turned my life
Into some kind of shit
Make use of it...

I gave up my soul
To swtch sides with you
Ain't no turning back
I just become like you
It's just matter at time
See what I'm gonna do
As it happens to me
Your nightmare will come true

You ruined me
You made me bleed
And you turned my life
Into some kind of shit
Make use of it...
