Even if I could change the fate
Couldn't save you from your rage
Loosing my time and your fading essence
Creates new worlds but agony rise

Empower the ghouls by tears of fear
Whispered curses all you hear
Inflowing pain self induced gear
Solicits you to take it again

Everything burns inside your hate
Ever asked it yourself why doesn't it change
Don't fool me, no don't fool yourself
Leave the world on fire ever burn

Heart you own is hard as a stone
Forgotten past and everything has gone
Betrayed by fate and have no hope
No trust, no aim you have no love

Your vanity lies to you and me
With the pain you have hired the days passed by
Now spirits are crying where all hoped died
Before it's too late say your last goodbye

Everything burns inside your hate
Ever asked it yourself why doesn't it change
Don't fool me, no don't fool yourself
Leave the world on fire ever burn

Heart you own is hard as a stone
Forgotten past and everything has gone
Betrayed by fate and have no hope
No trust, no aim you have no love
