Once more the night and the dark fall
On to my heart and on my soul
Thoughts of heavy doubts to know
What is the life, where am I
Now the fear in my heart is rising
To manage my entire life
Never it's leaving
Stuck on my heart

Freedom to my soul I demand
Hundred times guns I've taken in hand
To open up a hole to take a breath
To walk for light once more in life

Life it seems such a burden
That I could carry no more
I've tried to keep on living still
I've really tried but I did not know
How could I stand this pain inside
Me and sorrow, side by side
Seems like holding tight
As hard as I should have died

Freedom to my soul I demand
Hundred times guns I've taken in hand
To open up a hole to take a breath
To walk for light once more in life

So tell me how could I wake
From this dream inside the dream
And so tell me how should I stand
This pain that grows inside me

So tell me how should I yearn for
After all, that I've never leaved
And cry for those which I have lost
If there are none all through my life
I should have asked to myself then
Have I ever lived or
Vanishing hopes, vanishing life
Night after night

Freedom to my soul I demand
Hundred times guns I've taken in hand
To open up a hole to take a breath
To walk for light once more in life

So tell me how could I wake
From this dream inside the dream
And so tell me how should I stand
This pain that grows inside me

Everyone is talking about something
Hopes and love they say always be there
Inside the darkest holes of your heart
They lie but you have to trust and let them out

Why I can not be just like anyone else
Living these truths and pain as they came into my life
Why it feels me like I am going under
Day by day encouraging me to give my soul eternal freedom...
Angel of death, will you take my hand
And please ease my pain

These are the last words that I'll say
Feels like so close to the blue sky
I'm so glad to be that near
Better can I get taste of myself
Passion and the admiration
Such happiness for the first time
In my life

Freedom to my soul I demand
Hundred times guns I've taken in hand
To open up a hole to take a breath
To walk for light once more in life

So tell me how could I wake
From this dream inside the dream
And so tell me how should I stand
This pain that grows inside me
