Wake up my beloved people
From this unbelievable dream
Your lastitude has caused
Of many many people's lost
Erasing the thoughts
In a systematic corode
Acting as if your hopes
Some part of outlaw

My government comprimises
About the future lies
In union they stand
To turn my homeland into a grave
The global resources
That keeps us rich and glore
All we have to change
Once everything we are by the way

The time was never on my side
To swallow whole the pain
And we try to make our own way
But they don't let us fly

Wake up my beloved people
From sadness and all the scars
To find out a way
To walk for another happy day
Get up and say no
And choose the way to go
Who you are you know
Woll the stone and
Let it go on and on

The time was never on my side
To swallow whole the pain
And we try to make our own way
But they don't let us fly
