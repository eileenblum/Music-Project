Covered and drifted with the blood
Something like hiding in the dark
Like the day we've choosed the way
When all dead lies are all beneath my eyes

There is light beyond darkness
There is light further all sins
As I am a damned kind for it is
I cursed to creep and got lost in the myst

Thrown away into this lands
With the burning sand
And wreaths of gods are
Always in my hands

There is light beyond darkness
There is light further all sins
As I am a damned kind for it is
I cursed to creep and got lost in the myst

Nightwolf, reignin' in the dark
Nightwolf, from dusk till dawn alone...
