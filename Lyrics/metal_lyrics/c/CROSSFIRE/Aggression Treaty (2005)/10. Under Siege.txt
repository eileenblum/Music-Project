Something is wrong with this night
Dreams hug me so much tight
Wake up in the morning
And I've seen my future almost dying

Shed my fear all around
Piss of now dirty thoughts
Get up from the bed so much
Work I had to do all day long

Stop right now what you've done
Get out of concil walls
Votes are now into garbage
Until you have your own decission

Say something your own words
Let me hear what I have chose
Thoughts are now under siege
Global think abuse the world I live

Choice seems a pretty illusion
Individuallity kills a happy nation
Matter of hope is a combination
Soul abuse and social invasion

I should knew who I am
Where will I go, where I came
Footprints that I left erased
By the man I've chosen to lead my fuckin' aims

Am I dead or alive
Can I breath or suffocate
Meaning of the humanity
Nothing more than cows that rest in shed

Choice seems a pretty illusion
Individuallity kills a happy nation
Matter of hope is a combination
Soul abuse and social invasion

Let's undress the fortune imposed
Reveal the truth once you posessed
Take back the power we hold
Know the truth and the law you hold
Now the time has come right now

Take back what you've leaved
Take back what you've lost
What you lived for
What you die for

Choice seems a pretty illusion
Individuallity kills a happy nation
Matter of hope is a combination
Soul abuse and social invasion
