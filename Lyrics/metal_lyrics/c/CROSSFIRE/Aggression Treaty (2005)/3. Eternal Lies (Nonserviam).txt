I've been searching for answers for all years
Have gone by with an aim "only revenge"
Why I have to be cursed
Why I have to be thrown into darkness

I'm the one, the lord of all the angels
And the master of holy light and flame
How could you expect me
To kneel in front of the sheeps of your creation

I don't believe my soul will be lost in the dark
And you can't curse me down
I will be dead if I see the
Whole of the world pray for you one day

You've just known your conceit and your ego
You can't stand me cause I am the master race
But you have shown me
Weak and ignoble in me beyond your highness

Now I swear on my blood with all my heart
Your mankind one day will be my faithful slave
Then you'll see what I mean
Even you could not have everything you like

I don't believe my soul will be lost in the dark
And you can't curse me down
I will be death if I see the
Whole of the world pray for you one day

Non serviam I never serve you
Non serviam I'll never obey
Non serviam I'll never serve you god
Non serviam to your eternal lies
