Steel and fire
Through the wind and the rain
Wheel monster freeway riots
Streets are marked with their name

Pride and glory
Through generations and time
Freedom seals their story
it's ultimate speed divine

I wanna make things come my own way
I aim to see my dreams come true
Heaven can wait I'll die another day
Just leave me be your king of fools

Have no boundaries
destination unknown
Wanna rest my piece oh...
Somewhere I could call home

Never followed your nowhere plan
Listen to me you son of a gun
Just let it be
Live and let die

I wanna see things come my own way
I aim to make my dreams...

Ever alone
Ever alone
Myself alone
Ever alone
