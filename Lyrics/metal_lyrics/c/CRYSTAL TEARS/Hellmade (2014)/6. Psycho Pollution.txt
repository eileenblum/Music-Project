Shed a tear for all the ones who we let disappear
Just from those moments in life we all fear
But when the ultimate end's closing near
And then it's you recollect

The love we never find, moments we leave behind
The simple things that keep us separated
It's never us to blame, our faults remain the same
Our ego makes us blind degenerated

WE'RE BLIND
The deadeye insight, forever denied, lifetime delusion
DECLINED
The battle of sins, goes deeper within, psycho pollution

Eye to eye, now it is kill or be killed, what a lie
Oh we can change all this shit if we try
It is more than you and me, gotta try
Just to fall with our pride

The love we never find...

WE'RE BLIND...

The love we never find...

WE'RE BLIND...
