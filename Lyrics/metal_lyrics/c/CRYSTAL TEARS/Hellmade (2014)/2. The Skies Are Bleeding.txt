Embrace the horror and the lie remains the same
This brutal planet commits suicide again
Trumpets will sound the soundtrack of death

Thunders and storms
Dimensions higher
Planet reforms
Cosmos on fire

Unleash the fur of the gods - The skies are bleeding
Heavens shall burn, it's war of worlds - The skies are bleeding

It's time to sell big news catastrophe of world
Deadeye disciples preaching vacant words of hope
What's to be done will be done no parole

Thunders and storms...

Unleash the fury of the gods - The skies are bleeding
Heavens shall burn, it's war of worlds - The skies are bleeding
Apocalyptic psychostorm - The skies are bleeding
Welcome to Hell, I bid you all - The skies are bleeding

Unleash the fury of the gods...
