Each time you look in your own eyes
The mirror's bleeding
Each tear another hero dies

Always blinded by your fears
Never wanted to tame that power
Burning up your savage heart

Unleash the beast that calls you night and day
Aware of all the things you may embrace

Tame the Devil inside
Do you have the guts to take your darkest ride
Free the Devil inside
Be careful what you're digging, don't know what you will find
Trap the Devil inside
Snake will keep on crawling, never look behind
Kill the Devil inside
Sow the seeds of chaos, find your piece 'o mind

Salvation Inc.
Find lies and truth on mystic path
There's no way out... no!

Unleash the beast...

Tame the Devil inside...

Tame the Devil inside...
