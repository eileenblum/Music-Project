Rock is bleeding from my eyes
Blood brothers, metally insane
It's rock until we fall, our metal horror show
Highway to Hell with Devil's train

Saint's and sinners, non-believers
A pure steel gallery of world
Metal action, chain reaction
It's primal instinct rock n' growl

One music, one nation blood - ROCK N GROWL
One will, united we stand - ROCK N GROWL
It's made in Hell or brought from Heaven
The world's a stage we plug and play

Faults we make remain the same
Can't realize rock who's to blame
Life's a game we have to play
Can't realize rock 'fore we bleed

Rock n' growl

One music...
