Lost in illusions, fear is the key
Blood-virus souls hypnotized
Land of confusion, dying new breed
Embrace the horror of reality

Blinded by ambition
Self-greed's on a mission
Balance on a razorblade

Out of the shadows - They can life you up and tear you down
Out of the shadows - There's no promised land but killing ground
Out of the shadows - You are building castles in the sand gotta get
Out of the shadows - It's a left-destruction nowhere land

Tears of the angels, choirs of the dead
When life and death will collide
Our revolution, twisting insane
Embrace the sickness of it all

Out of the shadows...

Out of the shadows...
