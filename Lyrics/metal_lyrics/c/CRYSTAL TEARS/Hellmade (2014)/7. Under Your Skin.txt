Faces and the secrets beneath wicked
Surface and the lies in the eyes
I will be crawling under that smile
No one can hide from his guilts

I'll be calling you at nights
I will be crawling in your dreams
I hear you creeping, cannot be dreaming
Oh... no...

Nightmare despair on and on
Oneiric storm, your twilight zone
Where will you turn for your sins
Search deep within, I'm under your skin

Secrets, inner demons make your nights
Sleepless, still the lies in your eyes
I will be crawling under your pride
You cannot hide from your sins

I hear you calling my name
I'm here to ease away your pain...
Oh... no...

Nightmare despair...

Nightmare despair...
