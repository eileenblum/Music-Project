Every word you said
Poisoned heart and brain
Malevolent intentions

Bitterness you gave
Malice was your name
Evil your temptation

But we will meet again
Father time will help me on this
And I'll take my revenge
You shall burn into my hell

Oh... I cannot forget
All the suffering and pain that you gave
Oh... I cannot forgive
For you never repented your sins

And the arrows fall [4x]

You had never cared
I'm alive or dead
Hypocrisy you hide

Memories remain
Poison in my veins

I found your disguise

Now we will meet again
And this time you will lose I will win
You will plea for your end
You shall bleed for your past

Oh... cannot you see
That you now belong to me

And the arrows fall [4x]

And the arrows fall [4x]
