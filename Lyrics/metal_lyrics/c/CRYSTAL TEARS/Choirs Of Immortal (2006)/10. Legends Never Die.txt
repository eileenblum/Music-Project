Tales of the heroes who died in the field
Brave men who followed their beliefs
Drops of their blood formed a contract of
dignity

And their ashes turned to dust
But they will never cease to last

They fought the earth and heavens
They battled in the seas
They had no rest until the end, oh, oh...
They're gonna live forever
Deep in the hearts of men
It's true that legends never die, eh, eh, eh

Face to face with the sickle of death

And their ashes...

The fought the earth...

The fought the earth...

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
