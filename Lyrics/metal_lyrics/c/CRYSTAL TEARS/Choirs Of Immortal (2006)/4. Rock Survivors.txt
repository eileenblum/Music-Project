It's time now or never
You have to make up your mind
It's win or be taken
Nobody's left by your side

'Cause why are we fighting
What is the meaning of it all
Never stop dreaming
Because you never know

- IN DARKEST HOUR
THROUGH HARDEST TIMES
WE HAVE SURVIVED
Rock survivors we are â [2x]

I've travelled to places
So many faces I've met
The show now must go on
'Cause rocking is in my veins

'Cause why are we fighting
what is the meaning of it all
No compromises, yeah
Follow your heart and your soul

â IN DARKEST HOUR...â [2x]

â IN DARKEST HOUR... â [2x]
