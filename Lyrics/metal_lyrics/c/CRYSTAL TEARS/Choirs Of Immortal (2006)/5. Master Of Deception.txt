You, you promised million lies
Manipulated minds
Truth behind your vacant look
Is locked away for good

You brought the air of despair
You never played fair
Took approval gave hell

Liar â Evil incarnation
Liar â Cynic your intentions
Liar â I need no salvation
Liar â Master of deception

You said you could save the world
"Trust me give me votes"
Lies, nothing more but lies
Behind your vacant eyes

Have never felt our pain
Your bodyguards keep you safe
You always walk away

Liar â

Liar â
