I sense you in my room, your spirit everywhere
I dream you dancing, your figure's in the air
I sail away to places I've never been
I dream away to chain your look in me

When the night is cold â I feel you holding
my hand
When the night is cold â I hear you whisper
my head
When the night is cold â I kiss you tasting
your breath
When the night is cold

I cannot close my eyes, lonely I am me
I can't escape, your phantom's chasing me
How can I stand, I cannot stand
When the day is gone, your face is haunting
me

When the night is cold â

When the night is cold â
