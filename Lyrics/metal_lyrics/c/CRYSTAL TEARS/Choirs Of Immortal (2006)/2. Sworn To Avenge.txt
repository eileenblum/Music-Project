Like a killing tiger
Heading for its prey
Gonna aim at the throat
Offer art of pain

When the day is over
And the night begins
I am bound to an oath
From unknown realms

Sworn to avenge
Back from hell
You won't see me coming
Sworn to avenge
Raised from dead
You won't feel me coming

Without warning
Storm is coming
Tortured soul's
Bound to avenge

Like a killing tiger
Ready to attack
Sacred oath has waken me
From kingdom of the dead

Sworn to avenge...

Sworn to avenge...
