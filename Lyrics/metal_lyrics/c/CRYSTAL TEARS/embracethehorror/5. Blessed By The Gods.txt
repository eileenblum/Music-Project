IN A LAND THAT IS SO CLOSE AND YET SO FAR AWAY
WHERE A MAN CAN DREAM AND YET CAN CLOSE NO EYES
IN A LAND THAT FAITH IS FATE AND GROWS UP IN THE SKIES
WHERE ALL THE MADNESS IS THE LOGIC OF TODAY

NOW I STAND ALONE AND DIVE IN OUR PAST
THE WAYS WE USED AND HOW WE HAVE SURVIVED
THE BATTLES WE HAD LOST SHOWED THAT WE WOULDNâT LAST FOR LONG
ETERNITY SEEMED SO FAR AWAY

[BRIDGE I:]
SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS
WE MUST HAVE BEENâ¦

[CHORUS:]
BLESSED BY THE GODS - DIVINE IS OUR POWER
BLESSED BY THE GODS - WE HOLD VICTORY
BLESSED BY THE GODS - WE âRE TOUCHING THE STARS
OUR FATE IS A PART OF A GAME

THE GAME IS US WE HAVE TO PLAY
WE HAVE TO CLEANSE OUR SOULS AND PRAY
âCAUSE WE âRE BLESSED BY THE GODS

TELL ME WHATâS WRONG AND WHAT IS RIGHT
TELL ME WHAT LIES BENEATH OUR EYES
âCAUSE TRUTH IS ALL FOR US

[BRIDGE II:]
COME SEEK FOR ANSWERS
WE MUST HAVE BEENâ¦

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

YEAHâ¦

[CHORUS]
