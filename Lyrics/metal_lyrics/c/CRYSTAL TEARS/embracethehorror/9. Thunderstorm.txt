WE HOLD THE POWER
WE NEVER LOSE CONTROL
DENIM AND LEATHERâS WHAT WEâRE FIGHTING FOR

WE HOLD THE SECRET
THAT KEEPS THE FLAME ALIVE
METAL FOR MUTHAS NO REGRETS TONIGHT

[CHORUS:]
âCAUSE WE âLL MARCH AND CHANGE WORLD TONIGHT
AND WE WILL CONQUER STARS MY FRIEND
OUR FISTS FULL OF STEEL AWAITING THE THRILL
TONIGHT WE ARE ALL THUNDERSTORM

THE BEAST IS INSIDE CRAVES FOR SPEED WANTS TO STRIKE
IT HAS SO MUCH STRENGTH TO REVEAL
HELL NO WE WONâT STOP âTILL WE WIN ALL THIS FIGHT
HELL YES THEY âLL SEE NIGHTMARES COME REAL

OHâ¦

IâM SURE THEY âLL FEEL
IâM SURE THEY âLL FEEL OUR THUNDERSTORM
THUNDERSTORMâ¦

[SOLO]

HEY METAL WE CLAIM
A THUNDER RACE
YES WE GIVE FLESH AND BONES
REVENGE WE TAKE YOU PAY

METAL WE CLAIM
WE WILL PREVAIL
YES WE DEVOTE OUR SOULS
WE AREâ¦
