I WANNA TOUCH YOU
I THOUGHT WE WERE UNDER CONTROL
I WANNA HOLD YOU
AND ASK YOU WHY THINGS WENT SO WRONG

[BRIDGE I:]
SO MANY THOUGHTS ARE IN MY MIND
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE BY MY SIDE
WE WERE TOGETHER WE WERE ONE
JUST FACE THE TRUTH SEE WHAT YOUâVE DONE

[CHORUS:]
JUST LIKE BEFORE
BETRAYED AND ALONE
THE SAME MISTAKES THE SAME OLD WORDS
HAUNTED BY THOUGHTS
OF FEAR, GUILT AND LOVE
JUST LEAVE ME BE, LEAVE ME ALONE

I WANT SOME ANSWERS
I WANNA KNOW WHO IS TO BLAME
I WANT YOUR ANSWERS
AM I THE ONE AGAIN TO BLAME?

[BRIDGE II:]
I DEDICATE THESE BITTER LINES
TO THOSE WHO LAUGHED TO THOSE WHO CRIED
I WANNA SCREAM, I WANNA SCREAM MY NAME
THE ONLY WAY TO EASE MY PAIN

[CHORUS:]
JUST LIKE BEFOREâ¦

[SOLO]

NO I DONâT THINK I AM TO BLAME
NO IâM NOT!

[SOLO]

[CHORUS:]
JUST LIKE BEFOREâ¦
