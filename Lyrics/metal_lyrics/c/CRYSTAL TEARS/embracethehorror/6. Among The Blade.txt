THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO BE REBORN AGAIN
I AM A STRANGER TO MYSELF I CRY
A THOUSAND LIVES I LIVED AND NOW I WILL REGAIN
FORGOTTEN POWERS FROM FORGOTTEN TIMES

[BRIDGE:]
AWAKENING OF A GIANT
AWAKENING OF A STORM
IâM BURNING INSIDE MY SOUL

THE TIMES I AM REBORN ANOTHER LIFE IS GONE
LORD I KNEW THE ANSWER TELL ME WHY
IâVE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IâVE TURNED MY HEART TO STONE
TO FIND THE TRUTH IâM CURSED FOR ALL TIME

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS I:]
I AM IMMORTAL
IâM TRAPPED INSIDE MYSELF
COME HELP ME NOW
BREAK GODDAMN SPELLS
WHEN I START MY BATTLE
DONâT DARE STAND IN MY WAY
I WAS BORN TO WALK
AMONG THE BLADE

[AFTER CHORUS:]
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
SHOW ME THE WAY
COME SET ME FREE SAVE MY SOUL

I START REALIZE NOW HOW HARD IT IS
I START REALIZE ALL THE GAME
IT IS A PART OF MY STOLEN DREAMS
IT IS A PART OF MY FATE

[AFTER CHORUS]

[SOLO]

[CHORUS II:]
HERE IS MY POWER
AND HERE IS MY RAGE
COME FEEL THEM NOW
TASTE MY REVENGE
I WILL DEVOUR
SEE WRATH IN MY FACE
I WAS BORN TO WALK
AMONG THE BLADE

[CHORUS I]
