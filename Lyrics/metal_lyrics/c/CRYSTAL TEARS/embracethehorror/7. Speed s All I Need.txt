I FEEL THE FIRE AND I WILL EXPLODE
A HOT DESIRE FOR MY SOUL
I HIT THE ROAD WITH SPEED I WILL ATTACK
AND MUSICâS LOUD IN MY CAR

[BRIDGE:]
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN REVEAL ALL MY RAGE

[CHORUS:]
SPEEDâS-ALL I NEED-IâM SO FREE-IâM ALIVE
A-DRE-NA-LINE-FLOWS-IN-MY-BLOOD-SPEEDâS-ALL-I-NEED-SPEED-IS-MY-DRUG

FREEDOM IS MY MIDDLE NAMEâ¦

I FEEL THE THRILL IâM EXCITED IâM HOT
SPEEDâS LIKE A PILL FOR MY SOUL
I HAVE NO FEAR IâM SO FREE IâM ALIVE
LEAVE EVERYTHING JUST BEHIND

[SOLO]

I SEE THE PEOPLE WALKING IN THE STREETS
THEY ARE STRANGERS AMONG STRANGERS
THEY HAVE NO LIFE JUST FOLLOWING RULES
OH GOD I MUST ESCAPE

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
