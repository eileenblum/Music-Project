IâM BURNING INSIDE
IâM VICTIM OF TIME
THEREâS NO WAY FOR ME TO ESCAPE
WILL I STAY ALIVE
WILL I SURVIVE
TIME CANâT BE STOPPED ITâS IN VAIN

JUST THINK IT ABOUT
THAT TIMEâS RUNNING OUT
WE ALWAYS WILL BE ON THE RUN
WE MUST REALIZE THAT WEâRE ALL
SLAVES OF TIME!

[BRIDGE:]
CANâT YOU SEE WE ARE ENSLAVED!
YEARS PASS BY AND PEOPLE FADE!

[CHORUS:]
HOW CAN WE JUST FORGET
THE INNOCENT YEARS OF THE PAST
PEOPLE HAD NEVER FELT
THE PRESSURE OF TIME IN THEIR HEARTS

SAVE US
CAN YOU SAVE US
WEâRE SLAVES OF TIME [2x]

[SOLO]

WALLS THAT WE BUILD AROUND OURSELVES
EYES COLD AS ICE OH WHO CARES
I DONâT WANNA KNOW
IF MY HEART STILL STANDS
TO FACE ALL THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE

DREAMS OF MY CHILDHOOD
COME TRUE IN LIFE
NIGHTMARES OF PAIN RETURN BACK
SOON WEâLL DISCOVER
WHAT THEYâVE DONE TO US
FORCED US TO FOLLOW THEIR PLANS

YEAHâ¦YEAHâ¦YEAHâ¦

[SOLO]

FORCED IN A FAST WAY OF LIFE
LOST IN THE MASS NONE CAN HEAR YOUR CRIES
TIME HAS BEEN NEVER ENOUGH
TIME ALWAYS TREATS US SO TOUGH

LIKE AN EAGLE IN THE SKY
SPREAD WINGS SMELL FREEDOM FLY
WE MUST NEVER FEEL BONDS OF TIME

[CHORUS:]
HOW CAN WE JUST FORGETâ¦

SAVE USâ¦ [4x]
