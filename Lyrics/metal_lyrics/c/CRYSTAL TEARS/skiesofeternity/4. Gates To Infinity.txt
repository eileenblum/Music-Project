WHEN IâM DREAMING EVERY NIGHT
I SEE MY LIFE IS JUST A FIGHT
I KNOW WE âRE PASSENGERS ON EARTH
AND ONE DAY IT WILL COME OUR TURN

WE MUST PREPARE OURSELVES THAT DAY
MAYBE SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO PRAY
âCAUSE TIME IS SHORT ITâS COMING NEAR
THE DAY WHEN WE âLL CRY CRYSTAL TEARS

[CHORUS:]
GATES TO INFINITY

CANâT YOU SEE ITâS ONE MORE GAME
OUR FATE IS PLAYING WITH OUR GAMES
WE âRE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL STRAIN
OUR LIFE IS GOING DOWN THE DRAIN

BUT THEREâS ONE CHANCE TO LIVE AGAIN
TO START NEW LIFE MAKE SADNESS END
THESE GATES ARE HELL OR HEAVEN SENT
WHO DARES TO FIND OUT WITHOUT BEND

[CHORUS:]
GATES TO INFINITY

NOTHINGâS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE
THE GATES ARE OPEN WIDE TO ME
BUT I AM RUNNING OUT OF TIME
I HOPE IT JUST DOES WORTH THE DIME

I CANNOT RUN - I CANNOT RUN
I CANNOT HIDE - I CANNOT HIDE
I SOMETIMES WISH THAT I COULD DIE

[SOLO]

AND NOW I REACHED THE GATES SO CLOSE
I CLOSE MY EYES AND GRAB A ROSE
TO OFFER TO THE WORLD I âLL SEE
NO MATTER HOW HARD IT WILL BE

I TURN MY EYES AND LOOK AROUND
AND I STAND STILL FROM WHAT I FOUND
THE TIME IS SHORT IT SURE COMES NEAR
THIS DAY WHEN WE âLL CRY CRYSTAL TEARS

[CHORUS:]
GATES TO INFINITY [2x]

TURN YOUR SIGHT INSIDE YOUR MIND
FIND THESE GATES OF WORLD
OPEN THEM AND FLY AWAY
WHERE NO ONEâS BEEN BEFORE
