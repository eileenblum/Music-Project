AFTER WHATâS LEFT FROM MY RETURN
THE SKIES MAY STILL HIDE THE HOLY ANSWERS
LOOKING INSIDE MY FLAME STILL BURNS
AND ALL THE BLISS I HAVE CONQUERS MY SADNESS

BREAKING THE CHAINS OF THE PAST
WALKING ON ROADS FULL OF DUST
MARCH HAND TO HAND WITH MY FATE
HERE IS MY ENDLESS AIM

[BRIDGE:]
THE GATES OF SACRED TIME
CANâT HOLD MY ACUTE MADNESS
I WANT TO PASS THROUGH VALLEYS
WITH FIELDS ALL MADE OF GOLD

SO GRAB MY HAND AND COME
TOGETHER WE WILL WIN
AND NOTHING WILL PREVENT US
FROM AIMING OUR SCORE

[CHORUS:]
BEYOND THE ENDLESS REALITY [4x]

WE âRE WALKING UPON
A BLACK AND THIN ICE
IT WONâT GET LONG
UNTIL IT BREAKS

MY HEART BEATS
IâM GOING MAD
IS THIS A WORLD
WHERE I STAND

[SOLO]

NOTHING IS LEFT FROM THE REIGN
ALL THAT WE HAVE IS OUR FAITH
NOTHING IS LEFT BUT THE PAIN
HERE IS MY ENDLESS AIM

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS II:]
FORGET ALL THE PAIN OF THE PAST
YOUR DREAMS MIGHT COME TRUE HERE AT LAST
JUST GIVE ME YOUR HANDS AND YOUR TRUST
BEYOND THE ENDLESS REALITY
