MANY VOICES ARE CALLING FROM BEYOND
I CAN HEAR THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR WORLD
PURITY HAS LOST ITS STRENGTH THE DARKNESS RULES AGAIN
LUSTING FOR ETERNAL VENGEANCE AND REIGN WITHOUT RESTRAINTS

WHERE IS THE NATURE DESTRUCTION EVERYWHERE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERYDAY
THERE IS NO EXIT THEREâS NOWHERE ANY ROAD
THE MOTHER EARTH IS CALLING S.O.S. US ALL

[BRIDGE:]
TAKE MY HAND LISTEN TO ME DONâT HESITATE
AND YOU âLL FULFILL WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE THESE YEARS
AND HOW YOU WILL DOMINATE THE SOURCE OF DARK AGAIN
SALVATION AND DELIVERANCE ARE WAITING NOT IN VAIN

[CHORUS:]
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED TO US
THE LIFE OF A FREE MAN HAS TURNED INTO DUST
MY EYES CANâT LIE I KNOW ITâS NOT LATE
WE HOPE WE âLL BE SAVED BY THE WINGS OF THE FATE

[SOLO]

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

OH, OH, OH, OHâ¦
