CRISIS - OUR LIVES ARE FULL OF PAIN
WE START TO LOSE OUR FAITH
IT ALWAYS ENDS THE SAME
WHY NOT THIS TIME

WE FALL INTO DECAY
WE WAIT FOR BETTER DAYS
AND IT ALWAYS ENDS THE SAME
FOR ONE MORE TIME

[CHORUS:]
I TURN AROUND AND TAKE A LOOK
AND SEE WHAT WE BECAME
MY EYES CANNOT ACCEPT THE TRUTH
ANOTHER SORROWâS GAME
WHILE OTHERS LAUGH I JUST WANT TO CRY
BECAUSE I SEE THROUGH FATE
AND I KNOW THAT DEATH WILL COME
ANOTHER SORROWâS GAME

CRYINGS - THE LAUGHTERS ARE NOW PAST
THEY âRE FADING VERY FAST
FOR HOW LONG WILL IT LAST
SORROWFUL TIMES

THE PEOPLE LONG TO HIDE
AND NOTHING ELSE THAN DIE
FOR BETTER DAYS THEY CRY
EVERY TIME

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

ANOTHER SORROWâS GAME [3x]
