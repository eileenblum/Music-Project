WHEN IâM REDEEMED FROM DARKNESS
NO FEAR NO PAIN NO MORE
THE LIGHT WILL GUIDE ME TO FULFILL MY HOPE

ANOTHER DREAM COMES TRUE
ANOTHER NIGHT PASSED BY
I HOPE THE NEW DAY WILL BRING ME GOOD SIGNS

[BRIDGE:]
AND IN MY DARKEST HOUR
IâLL TRY TO HIDE MY SORROW
I WISH I KNEW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
WHAT IS TO FOLLOW

[CHORUS:]
FIGHT - I WANT TO TRY ANOTHER TIME
I WONDER IF IS THIS A CRIME
I HOPE THERE IS A NEW TOMORROW
BUT TIMEâS FADING AWAY JUST NIGHT BY NIGHT
THE SHADOWS HEAR MY SILENT CRIES
I CRAVE FOR JUST A NEW TOMORROW

MY LIFE HAS GONE ASTRAY
IâM WASTED TO THE CORE
I WISH I WAS NOT IN THE EYE OF THE STORM

I MUST AVOID THE DOWNFALL
I WANT TO AIM MY GOAL
BELIEVE IN ME I WILL ASCEND MY THRONE

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
