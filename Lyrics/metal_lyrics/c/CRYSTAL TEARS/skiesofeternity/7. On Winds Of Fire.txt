SITTING ALL ALONE TONIGHT
CRYING LOUD
IT DOESNâT SEEM RIGHT

WISHING SHE WAS THERE WITH HIM
WHAT WOULD TAKE
TO SEE HER REAL

[BRIDGE:]
DREAMING AND WONDERING
HOW TO MEET AGAIN
THE PAIN AND THE TORTURING
THEIR PASSION WILL REMAIN

[CHORUS:]
ON WINDS OF FIRE THEY RIDE
THEY STAND SIDE BY SIDE
AND THERE IS NO TURNING BACK
THE PATH THAT THEY CHOSE IN THEIR LIVES
THEY WISH THEY COULD DIE
âCAUSE ONLY DEATH WILL UNITE THEM

[SOLO]

THINKING OF THE TIMES THEY HAD
MEMORIES
THEY DRIVE HIM MAD

ONLY IF HE SEES HER REAL
FOR ONE MORE TIME
HEâLL REST IN PEACE

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

TOGETHER THEY STAND
DEATH WONâT DO THEM APART
THEYâLL NEVER GIVE UP

ALL THESE DAYS
THEYâVE BEEN SUFFERING
BUT THEIR LOVEâS STRONG ENOUGH

WHATEVER IT TAKES
NO ONE CAN BREAK
THE LUST THAT THEY SHOW

DAY BY DAY
THE SOLUTION COMES
WHEN DEATH WILL GET CLOSE

TASTE THE TASTE
OF THE FATE
THAT DOMINATES OUR SOULS

THE LOVE AND THE HATE
ARE ONE MORE GAME
OF THE ONE WHO RULES US ALL

[CHORUS]
