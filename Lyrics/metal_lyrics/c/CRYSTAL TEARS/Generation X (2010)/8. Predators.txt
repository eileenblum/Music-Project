This world can be a weird place
Full of evil and disgrace
Predators everywhere
Out on a rampage they don't care

Are we just an evil race
Acting like predators

History the world has taught us there's a few sons and daughters
Who were sent off to war to find a weapon no one saw
Predators from a nation driven by a false intention
They were sent to save the poor while the rich were reaping more

They feed on your weakness searching for ways to break you
Once they have achieved this they'll strip you to the bone
To them you don't exist you're just a worthless victim
Your efforts to resist a journey to the unknown

Are we just an evil race...

History the world has taught us...

History the world has taught us...

Reaping more!
