A knife spins around you're afraid
As the blade flashes by

Life is but a mystery we spend our time making mistakes
And on this journey we can see around the corner
The weak will cry the strong will earn
The harder we try the more we learn we are strong

Have you ever wondered why
What's it all for the reason why

What makes the mind work when making decisions
When decisions make others cry
Why don't we ever question an answer that's given
What makes us see eye to eye

Wake up all you dreamers
We're only human made of flesh and bone
Don't give up believing
Those fairytales will guide you all the way home

This voyage through life is sometimes tough it's like
A landscape rough your wild imagination
Illuminate all that creative praise
Too late for yesterdays tomorrow brings new ways

Are we all just flesh and blood is there more to life than this
Will our fantasies remain unreal an abyss
Questions why unanswered multiply and then you can't deny
There must be a reason, a reason why

Oh... still if a knife spins around
You're afraid as the blade flashes by
'cause you're alive so stay awake
Don't be afraid of the dark

What makes the mind work when making decisions...
Wake up all you dreamers...
