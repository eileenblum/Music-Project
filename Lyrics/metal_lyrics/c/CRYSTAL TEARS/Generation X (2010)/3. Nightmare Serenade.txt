Revealing signs
Now they're plain to see
Like the Jekyll to the Hyde not knowing what goes on inside
Pain and misery

Blood flowing the pain's growing
All aboard for the nightmare serenade
The nightmare serenade

Passing times
Torn in-between two worlds
Lost inside tormented minds reality all senses blind
Dreams without no ending

Blood flowing the beast's growing
The madness has just begun

All aboard - the masquerade begins
This spectacle of minds a nightmare serenade
All aboard - exciting full of thrills
One time journey to the nightmare serenade

Come and see this strange disguise
To whom the madman shall reveal

His deeds he knows not what he's done
Or when his crazed desires begun
The skill in which he carves their flesh
A mystery only he must confess

Don't look into this stranger's eyes
Beware of what the truth reveals

You can't escape this strange parade - nightmare serenade
Once you've entered this nightmare serenade
All aboard - the masquerade begins
One time journey to the nightmare serenade
