I'd like to tell you all a story about a heroes' tale
My destiny a deed made long before me I must not fail
To bring you truth to give you faith all of these values long forgotten
A mighty rage took them away

It's not too late - to be all you should be
It's not too late - to be all of those things
It's not too late - to be glorious like kings
It's not too late - to be almost anything

The ground did shake some thousand years so very long ago
Make no mistake they tried in anguish
None did survive it's time to awake their hidden souls are still alive
Their heart's all will still survive

Yeah... - a heroes' tale
Their memories are safe there deep inside

It's not too late - to be who you should be...

It's time for the spirits to awake
Oh, oh, oh... A heroes' tale

... Too late - to be who you should be...

... To be all you wanna be!
