Gather 'round now listen we have a tale to tell our friends
Welcome to our new world here we set the trends
Watching over others 'cause no one can be hurt
Look back over your shoulder see us there

In this life it's clear as day
We all need someone and a shoulder to cry on
And in this world there's some who say
You can't trust no one 'cause life's a battle to be won

If you wanna play the game you've gotta feel the pain
Don't let your life be in vain

When there's lonely souls and lonely strangers
Lost inside their hearts and minds
To help each other well they can see if danger's lurking especially
This loyalty is so hard to find lonely souls a weird kind
Strangers lost inside an empty paradise

There's so much emptiness around
Millions of strangers not a sound
In silence they all will be damned

They live each day to make ends meet
Yesterday dreams now bitter sweet
Give them a helping hand

If you wanna play the game you've gotta feel the pain
Remember life is short don't let it be in vain

When there's lonely souls and lonely strangers
Lost inside their hearts and minds
Help each other if you see lonely souls in you and me
Sister brother they could be one and all so plain to see
Strangers lost inside an empty paradise

So when there's lonely souls...
