This life is killing me
I'd rather be dead and buried
With all this suffering I see
Maybe life after death is better

The day I die will be the day I start to see
To see a new world where I will be reborn
In the beginning

Life after death - life after death - has no regrets - has no regrets
That's why it just lives on
You'll never know what the future holds
Life after death at last

A new existence now a new beginning
I won't make the same mistake twice
A second chance I'll be the one who's winning
And losers pay the price

Now I'm living each day like it's my first day of living
Oh the first day of lay life

In the beginning
I'll build a world - build a world - the way that it should be
Oh... there for the living - living
Without hatred greed and endless misery

In the beginning...

In the beginning you can create your own world your own dream
