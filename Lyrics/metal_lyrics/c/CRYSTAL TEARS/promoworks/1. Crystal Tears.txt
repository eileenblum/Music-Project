Everywhere I see a lot of pain
Everybody's captured in chains
Hear us crying loud set us free
We want to vanish all this misery

The time has come to make our way out
And we will win for this there's no doubt
They'll us rise in front of their eyes
These are my words that will make them cry

[Bridge:]
Watch out - our anger
Watch out - our grief
Hear us - shouting
We came to win

[Chorus:]
Listen to the sorrow bells
It's time we raised our rebel yells
Nothing more than kill our fears
Hear them the cries of crystal tears
Optimism is what we need
And all our dreams will make them real
Tranquility and salvation's near
See the signs of crustal tears

Look into my eyes and see my spirit flying high
With all the faith I have inside I'm not afraid to die
You'd better run and find somewhere to hide - to hide
I wait to see your fall and hear your cries

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Oh, oh, oh, ohâ¦
