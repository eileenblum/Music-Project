Leading a life full of sorrow
Into a world made of stone
Under the whisper of silent screams
Someday my storm will reborn
Someday my storm will reborn
Someday my storm will reborn
Someday my storm will reborn

Into the darkness a sad and lonely face that is screaming in pain
Sad eyes are seeking revenge for every moment my tears are in vain
I look at myself in the mirror pretending to be a master of world
Searching for something that's real will bring the glory inside my soul

[Chorus:]
You see me rise from the ashes that set me free
Someday my storm will prevail
The eyes of the world won't believe in my victory
Someday my storm will prevail

My friends are the shadows of darkness that will make me see things so clear
The forest became now my shelter and I see my storm coming near
Now I can feel what is like when glory flows within my heart
It seems that I made it at last to break the outer walls of my past

[Chorus]

I see my eyes burning bright
I feel my strength in the air
The skies tell me now what is fake and not real
Someday my storm will prevail

Waiting a sign to begin my storm until the end of my life
Until the sun will turn black until my fall into the dark
Feeling the flames burn is so divine I've never felt it before
Emotions of darkness surround me I stand in the everworld

[Chorus]

The answers I seek for I know will appear
When skies reveal all my strength
The age of the glory is soon coming near
Someday my storm will prevail
