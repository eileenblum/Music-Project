[Spells and hymns from Gemini]
[Dec 03 - Feb 04]

"Naked I was sent back to the mountain top
The throne of an ancient earth.
Death came arriving at the top
of the endless stairs.
A shadow, which led me to a magic window.
Interlaid it was, with the heavens.

Led me on the endless stairs, but I was returned.

The tower carved of the mountain lay.
Crumbled, it lay. And death, it lay.
Alones, sad, and forgotten.
Incapable of escape from a dreary place.
I just lay and fazed into the times, at the stars,
and at the abyss. I have fallen, through oh so many
boundless places. I have fallen into the abyss.
Faint were the sounds of all knowledge.
A new war, a new spring, but always winter...
A new beginning... The tower, will crumble again.
The arrival, the return...

Who is to see? Our children, or none?
...The light of a god shall soon flicker out.
Which one is to vanish first?"
