[Spells and hymns from Gemini]
[June 02]

"To travel the void,
In the wavelengths of an intuitive
To be drawn to the aura of a radiant source,
is to find yourself, maybe lost.
Platonically meditate to immaculate infinity.
The celestia and stars our destination.
Or maybe to the spirit in the still homestead.
I obey the old master,
Of divinity (the spectrum).
There is a phantasm. The other side."
