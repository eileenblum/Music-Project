[Summoned by Frost Heathen]
[March 04]

Winters of death and despair
Casting a spell from a blackened lair
Isolated and misanthropic
Behold the rise of an evil Prophet!!!

Chaos, war, evil, and hate
Cursed and tormented shall be my fate
Fucked with dark forces
and summoned the dead
Demonic entrapment inside your head

Dancing round the fires of hell
Ominous vision of an ancient abyss
there's no turning back
They've come for ye
There's no turning back
Demonic Attack!!!

The witching hour has arrived, hahaha!
