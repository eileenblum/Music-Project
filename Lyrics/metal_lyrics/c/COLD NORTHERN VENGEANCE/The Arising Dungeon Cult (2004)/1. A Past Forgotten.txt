[Summoned by Frost Heathen]
[Oct 03 - April 04]

The Heathen wolves
Have returned once more
The second wolfmoon
Where the flames of old still burns
Of Nifelheim, the barbarian hordes
Must rise again
Ancestral spirit awake within...

For a past forgotten
For a wisdom lost...

Facing to the northern clime
Thrice he traced the runic rhyme
Thrice pronounced in accents dread
The thrilling verse that wakes the dead
Till from out the hollow ground
Slowly breathed a sullen sound...
