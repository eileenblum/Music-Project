Black winds of emptiness
Freezing cold has entranced my soul
Walk the path of desolation
The winds they whisper the darkness of once was
Cultivate the seeds of rebirth
Bringeth forth our Heathen AWAKENING...

This is our Northern Kingdom
Gnosis of the Pagan land
Behold our rise from darkness
Knowledge key to the dawn...

Life is death and death is life and...

We are once and shall be again
Riding our storm of Vengeance...
For Chaos is ALL...
