Is this the way?
The Gods shall have their say
I fall again
to their oblivion

Hammer by my side
I forge with the tides
Tis time that bears the truth
and I must fall to stand...

I am the seeker of secrets
and they all bear a price
I am the seeker of secrets
that cut like the knife...

Chaos was
Chaos is
Chaos shall be
For Chaos is ALL...
