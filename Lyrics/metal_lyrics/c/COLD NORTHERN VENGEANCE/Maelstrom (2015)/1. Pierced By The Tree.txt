Roots descend to darkness
Branch reaches to the light
Leaves are falling and returning
I am pierced by the tree...

Everything is coming and going
and when the love has left me
Tis the blood that runs cold
like the lone wolf

Alike the wolf
hunting for the loss
Alike the wolf
hunting for the loss...
