Lost out at sea
Waiting I plea
For the Gods to say why
They have forsaken me

Wave builds to crash
and rise again
it all sparks to me
Ocean's foe and friend

A voyage to knowledge
is fraught with deceit
and the tides and the waves
shall drag you down deep
but it was in those darkened
depths of hell
That showed me the
nature of this spell

Torn asunder by the storm
left empty and worn
no shred of hope
was left in me
and then came the light
that was dark like the night
some sort of
bittersweet paradox...

Into this maelstrom
of death!
Ppen! they eye
of the storm...

North, South, East, West
All call me home
Beyond the tides
Beyond the lie
Is where I'm home

I'm leaving and returning
wave is crashing
and building
and the dark is the light...
OPEN! OPEN! THE EYE! OF THE STORM!
