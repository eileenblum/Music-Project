There's a witch
on the strange side of town
Spellbound
Demonic smile
We planned our escape
from the King and his men
to the mountain top
where children sing...

Waning
I'm waxing and waning
Longing for the
different world
Waning
I'm waxing and waning
Longing for the
different girl...

Looked at everything
they told me not to
I found out why?
another side
The evil witch
She cast her spell on me
and now I dance
with death...
and Entropy...

Everything is not quite what it seems to be
Everything is not quite what she seems for me

Why oh why?
Did I call you hear
Why oh why?
You're the one to fear...

Waning
I'm waxing and waning
Longing for the
different world
Waning
I'm waxing and waning
Longing for the
different girl...
