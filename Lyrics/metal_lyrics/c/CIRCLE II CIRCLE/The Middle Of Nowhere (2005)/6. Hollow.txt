See the raging hearts
Waiting to explode
Tripping in the dark
They shift to overload
All they ask is to return
It surrounds you
Releasing all the pain
All the troubled times
Carrying that dead weight

I'm crushing the barriers of time
Keeping the hollow down inside
Away from the troubles that I've known
Waiting for the truth to finally show

Run alone again
On dark and winding roads
I reflect upon
This twisted web I've seen
It's so hard to return
Have they found me?
The light begins to fade
And I know it's time
Wash the sins away!

Approaching the barriers of time
Keeping the hollow down inside
Away from the troubles that I've known
Waiting for the truth to finally show

See the desperate hearts taking every turn
All that's come and gone
They borrowed and they burned
It's so hard to return

It surrounds you
Releasing the pain
All the troubled times
Carrying that dead weight

I'm crushing the barriers of time
Keeping the hollow down inside
Away from the troubles that I've known
Waiting for the truth to finally show
Approaching the barriers of time
Keeping the hollow down inside
Away from the troubles that I've known
Waiting for the truth to finally show
