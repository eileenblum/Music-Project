I used to think that life's a game
Meant to play then fade away
And take the journey slow
To the twilight of my days
Now my thoughts are so alive
I'll die trying to turn back the hands of time

I'm not sure what I found
Broken free from the
Self-created problems inside
I never had a reason to want to carry on

Watch the night begin to fly
You see a strange light from within
Don't try to fight it when you're feeling lost
And drained completely
Because of where you've been
In the middle of nowhere

You sat and watched from underneath
All the weight of broken years
Then along the way the nights
Left you shaking ever near
To the end that you desired
When you lost the fire the line was very clear

And all the things that I've found
Melting away like the rain that never
Seems to stop I never had a reason to doubt
You would carry on

Watch the night begin to fly...

Never look back, understand
Don't fade away and let it slip from your hands

I don't know how to feel
I don't know how to deal
Bound and stripped of all I really know

Pieces of the afterthoughts
When you saw that all was lost
There's nowhere to go this time
Now you finally know the cost
I can't save you from your thoughts

In the middle of nowhere
