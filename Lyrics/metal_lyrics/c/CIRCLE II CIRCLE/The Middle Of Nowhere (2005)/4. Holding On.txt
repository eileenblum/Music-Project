Look in the past in times you'll see
(The broken pieces of your life)
Everything that was in focus
(Broke apart before your eyes)
Nights you shook with cold despair
(That you really couldn't bear)
Then you scream to find there's no one there

Look into the face of a crying disgrace
Lies defeat you time's deceived you
You can't take it anymore

You know it ain't so hard to break you
Did you know how far they'd take you?
Can you see the scars upon you?
Still you face the nights alone
Everything is falling by the wayside
And it's calling you to find the reasons why

You're just holding on
Can't you see what's wrong?
Look at what you've got
Find out if it's worth
Holding on - Holding on

Your thoughts come through in only shades
(Things seem deep within your gray)
In this out of mind experience
(Only darkness will exist)
Remember days we used to show
(These deep divisions that we know)
Apparitions seen so long ago

Look into the face of a crying disgrace
The situation got you breaking
You can't take it anymore

You know it ain't so hard to break you...

Look into the face of a crying disgrace
Lies defeat you time's deceived you
You can't take it anymore

You know it ain't so hard to break you...
