Why can't you see?
You shouldn't have left me here
Far away from you
A long time ago
You brought me along
On this harrowing ride

I guess my fortune left
I rushed right into this dark descent
I couldn't hide placed on trial again
I dare not tell where I've been

Dark's descending, no use in pretending
That you know what's going on

The outlook is scary
Your face you bury in your hands
Seems you're not so strong after all

Faces in the dark, revealing what's inside

I'll always be a restless spirit
On an endless ride to eternity
Mortified to hear the truth you say to me

Dark's descending, no use in pretending
That you know what's going on

The outlook is scary...

Faces in the dark, revealing what's inside

Do you ever sleep?
You know you're testing the waters
Of mortality
Always drifting at sea
Feel the pressure start
And it tears you all apart

Dark's descending, no use in pretending
That you know what's going on

The outlook is scary...

Faces in the dark, revealing what's inside
Faces in the dark, playing with your mind
Faces in the dark, revealing what's inside
Faces in the dark
