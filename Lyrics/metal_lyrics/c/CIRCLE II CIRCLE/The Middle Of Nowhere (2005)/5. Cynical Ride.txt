Sometimes when you think
There's a way out of this situation
Somehow the unforeseen comes
Leading you back to the aggravation

Can't you feel the hours
Wasting away?
You're waiting to fall apart

Don't you fear all the demons inside?
It's not the image
Of an innocent child
In the midst of your cynical ride
Taking its toll - Taking its toll
As it tears you deep inside
Feel it staring you down?
As it takes you against the tide
Feel the weight coming down

Controversy sells like your soul
As you melt in your hole
While the treachery reappears
Resurrecting your fears

Can't you feel the hourglass
Counting your days?
In this impossible race

Don't you fear all the demons inside?
It's not the image
Of an innocent child
In the midst of your cynical ride
Taking its toll - Taking its toll
As it tears you deep inside
Feel it staring you down?
As it takes you against the tide
Feel the weight coming down

Mayhem feeds the chaos
Feeding the frenzy of all things lost
Feeling normal these days?
You don't have to search hard to find your grave

Can't you feel the hourglass
Counting your days?
While you're fading away

Don't you fear all the demons inside?...
