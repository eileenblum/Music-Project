If we're losing all we've come to know
Are we justified in letting go?

I could never change the world in this life
Everything is hanging on a thin line

Standing in a different place
Still it won't erase so many things
I looked right over lost among
This madness I've chosen
Now that it's gone and there's no trace
Could have been the one to guide you
Through your darkest days

Ain't gonna run this time
It's all played out
I'll stand right here
Face the wrath you give

I've dealt with the crime
I'm over doing time
Got to clear it out
It's my time to live

Stay awake 'til light
There's no end in sight
Ain't gonna lose this fight
It's my chance for flight

I've held on too long
To things that went wrong
It was far overdue
I'd erase it all for you
I'd erase it all for you

I could never change the world in this life
Everything is hanging on a thin line

I could never change the world
I could never change the world
Are we're losing all we've come to know?
I could never change the world
Are we justified in letting go?
I could never change the world

I could never change the world in this life
Everything is hanging on a thin line
