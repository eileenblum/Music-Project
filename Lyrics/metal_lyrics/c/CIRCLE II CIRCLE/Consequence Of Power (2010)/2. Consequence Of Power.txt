Don't know how I'll make
Hiding in the cold
Will I die here waiting
How long can I fight
Nothing left but pride
Got to find a way
To make it one more night
Feeling like I'm nothing
Like I was before
Praying for survival
For another round
Every second counts
Sometimes I don't know
If I can take anymore

Understand
The consequence of power
Never seen but always there
In your hands
The consequence of power
Is where the ride will end

Try to find a way back
Got to save myself
In this world
We lost control
Thought of checking out
Everything's in doubt
Feel like the tide is turning
But I've lost my soul
Spending every hour
Thinking âbout my life
I lost it all inside
It's all a mystery
How this came to be
I was in the wrong place
At the wrong time

Understand
The consequence of power
Never seen but always there
In your hands
The consequence of power
Is where the ride will end

Don't know how I'll make it
Running from myself
Lost in survival
Don't know what I see
Nothing left of me
Knowing there's a way
But I may not return
Spent all my emotions
Should I now confess
On the road of no control
All that I believed
All my ecstasy
Buried in the ground and burning
Right next to my soul

Understand
The consequence of power
Never seen but always there
In your hands
The consequence of power
Is where the ride will end
