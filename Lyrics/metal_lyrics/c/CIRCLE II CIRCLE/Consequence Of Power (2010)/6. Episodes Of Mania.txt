She died in a firestorm
It echoes from the street
A wasted life
Full of promise ending
I'm left to wonder
How it might have been
No one knows
How this fuels my hatred

In a maze of lies
Tearing down inside
And I know
This time they cannot hide

No more rides on the manic sea
I don't care what tomorrow may bring
No more spirals down an endless dream
My life's changing
But I'm living in your memory

Light comes into view
The sun breaks the horizon
Spend the hours thinking about you
The touch of your skin
The way you drew me in
Don't know if I could ever
Feel the same again

Through the darkest night
Through their sinister eyes
They will see
Their end has now arrived

No more rides on the manic sea
I don't care what the darkness may bring
No more silence I have fled the scene
Got my eyes
On the road that's now ahead of me

Now I wonder
What brought this to an end
Did they receive the message I sent
She's now in a better place
Leaving us to trace
A road that leads
To echoes that she hides away

In a maze of lies
Tearing down inside
And I know
This time they cannot hide

No more rides on the manic sea
I don't care what tomorrow may bring
No more spirals down an endless dream
My life's changing
But I'm living in your memory
