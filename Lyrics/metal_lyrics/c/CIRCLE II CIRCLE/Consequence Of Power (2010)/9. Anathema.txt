In the garden of hell
Did you heed the warning
You lie awake in your cell
Hear the evil calling

Look inside
This extraordinary place
Never know what you'll find
But there's no room for mistakes

So please understand
You must weigh the cost
You soul belongs to me now
No way out
It's what you live for

You will never know
Until its right before your eyes
Nothing will ever show
Open up your mind and recognize
You're not immortal
Just a soldier of fortune
At the crossroads of your life

In the shadows of death
I tried to reach you
What's going on your head
Hope you come back real soon

There's a chance you take
To escape on the ocean
Your debt is hardly paid
They removed your emotions

I was forged to leave
Running for so long
Now I'm on the dark sea
What will be
It's what I live for

You will never know
Until its right before your eyes
Nothing will ever show
Open up your mind and recognize
Your last decision
Fulfil your vision
At the crossroads of your life

Live the lie
Tell the story
A lifetime on this earth
If you die
What's waiting for you
Will the voice be heard
One more time
One for glory
Leave behind the hurt
Remember now
Through all the changes
The silence always burns

You will know the truth
It will keep you from harm
I know you feel the sadness
The madness
Deep within your heart

You will never know
Until its right before your eyes
Nothing will ever show
Open up your mind and recognize
Your last decision
Fulfil your vision
At the crossroads of your life

On the lonely road to redemption
