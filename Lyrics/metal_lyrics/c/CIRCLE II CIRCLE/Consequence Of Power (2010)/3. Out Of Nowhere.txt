Take a walk along
The highway to your mind
Take a chance
On all the things
You never thought you'd find
Take advantage of your universe
Erase the damage
Of a journey
Gone from bad to worse

All the anger
All the pain
Just when you thought
It'd never be the same

Look out there
The city of darkness
Is waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere
Something you'll never believe

Same old fears
Got you paralyzed
Same old tears
That you could have shed
In years gone by
Same old hesitations
You can rise above
We got every nation
Wondering what we've got in store

All the danger
In the game
And you're anxious every move
And that's a shame

Look out there
The city of darkness
Is waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere
Something you'll never believe

All the anger
All the pain
Just when you thought
It'd never be the same

Look out there
It's waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere

Look out there
The city of darkness
Is waiting to set you free
Your wildest moment
Out of nowhere
Something you'll never believe
