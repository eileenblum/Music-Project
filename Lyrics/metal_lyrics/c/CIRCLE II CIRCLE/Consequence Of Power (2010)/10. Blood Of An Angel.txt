Another empty night surrenders to the day
Just can't seem to get out of the rain
I'm getting tired of running from the pain
I could I start again
Hoping you would see
But I've been blind
You could see the future
Close enough to know
The past can hold all the ways
To make it through another day

There I go again
Getting lost in thoughts of you
You're the morning light
The stars that shine
Everything inside
I see you standing there
Then you disappear from view
A vision that I never will forget
The blood of an angel

There I go again
Getting lost in thoughts of you
You're the morning light
The stars that shine
Everything inside
I see you standing there
Then you disappear from view
A vision that I never will forget
The blood of an angel

I guess I had what I was looking for
Then it slipped away forever more
All the questions now surrounding what's
In store
Things are different now
I'm searching for a way
To pass the time
You still hold the future
Stay with me
Forever needs to wait
For all the things I didn't get to say
