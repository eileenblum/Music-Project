I've come to warn you all
A dark and deadly force
Is now beyond control
We don't have one second to lose
It's looking like
The end is coming soon

Nothing
Can stop us
From taking the fall
I know this
I've seen them
They'll tear down the walls

Search for a new life
A new day in plain sight
It's finally upon us
The morning has come
A new day is born
Leave the fear behind us
Remember the days of the storm

Don't get lost in your thoughts
There's a reason they've come
To program your mind
To their cause
And try to make you their kind

Nothing
Can stop us
Protect us from harm
For them
Leave nothing
Our destiny calls

Search for a new life
A new day in plain sight
It's finally upon us
The morning has come
A new day is born
Leave the fear behind us
Remember the days of the storm

Should I break the silence
Leaving everyone in sacrifice
Should I break alliance
With the ones
That let me keep my life

Get ready to make your move
We'll make the rules
And darken their mood
Then we will arrive
From a distance
Hear our battle cry

Show us
Save us
Protect us from harm
For them
Leave nothing
Our destiny calls

Search for a new life
A new day in plain sight
It's finally upon us
The morning has come
Escape all the violence
All in defiance
Anger fuels desire
Inside your heart

We've known all along
We can be strong
Leave the tears behind us
All that's been torn
Morning has come
A new day is born
Remember the days of the storm
