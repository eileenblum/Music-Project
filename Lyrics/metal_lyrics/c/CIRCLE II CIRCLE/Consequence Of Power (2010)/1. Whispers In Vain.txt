We must be strong
We carry on
Never alone
Our wrath has grown
We're all for one
The time has come
To save our souls
No one will ever know

You see it happen all the time
Looks just like everyday life
We are slowly weaving deep inside
And you will pay the price

Moving closer
To control you
And there is nothing
You can do

You know there's
So little time to break
On your knees you shake
Will you feel betrayed
All that remains
Are whispers in vain

The road is long
It stretches on
As the desert rolls
Not too far to go
We've come so far
With no light in the dark

We have travelled cross many lands
Things have fallen into the wrong hands
We were hoping you'd understand
Sorry to ruin your plans

Moving under
Feel the thunder
In a moment it's over

You know there's
So little time to break
On your knees you shake
Will you feel betrayed
All that remains
Are whispers in vain

Moving closer
Feel the thunder
In a moment it's over

You know there's
So little time to break
On your knees you shake
Will you feel betrayed
All that remains
Are whispers in vain
