In this cold dark city
Nothing for sure
Ain't nothing for free
The situation's a pity
Everything failing
Just existing
Ventured into places
Where you should not tread
One day you'll wind up missing
And they'll find you dead

It's time you figured out
Sometimes you're not allowed

When it all comes down
Face your conviction
Make you presence felt
They cannot speak for themselves
You were lost and found
Now you preach your religion
A witness to the dead
On the lonely road to redemption

Through this whole situation
Running for cover into the night
Endless confrontation
Something's missing
Something ain't right
Always call to question
Motives meant to pressure
Always take the hard road
Nothing's worth taking
Without a fight

Your judgement is in doubt
This time you're going down

When it all comes down
Face your conviction
Make you presence felt
They cannot speak for themselves
You were lost and found
Now you preach your religion
A witness to the dead
On the lonely road to redemption

It's time you figured out
This time you're going down

When it all comes down
Face your conviction
Never turn around
They welcome resistance
You were lost and found
Now you preach your religion
A witness to the dead
