All alone watching
Evil in the sky
Scan the desert
For a stranger coming into sight
But I have to be one step ahead
Let the eyes of time
Lead me to the end

Taking every chance
To trace these steps alone
Every circumstance
Leads to roads unknown

Now it's all around us
And the world has come undone
There's no one left to see
Nothing to believe
There's a ghost inside my mind
Keeps the memories alive
There's a demon on the run
Heading for the sun

Here alone and I'm half asleep
Thoughts are sick and twisted
Never what they seem
Always someone on the other side
Got to stop this spiral
Running for my life

All the evidence
Was hidden very well
That will never change
The stories one could tell

Now it's all around us
And the world has come undone
There's no one left to see
Nothing to believe
There's a ghost inside my mind
Keeps the memories alive
There's a demon on the run
Heading for the sun
