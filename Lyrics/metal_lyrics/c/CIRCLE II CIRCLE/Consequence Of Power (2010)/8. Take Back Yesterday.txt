Seems to me we could
Make it all work out
Seems to me by now
You won't consider lies
I really hope
That you've found it all a thrill
You have really shown
Desire for the kill

We're never giving up
They'll never bring us down
No matter what they say about us
We'll be back around

Sometimes in our lives
We all have to bleed
Sometimes giving up
Things we thought we'd need
Internalize your anger
Intensify the pain
Get back all you lost
Take back yesterday

Did you ever think
We could have come this far
Did you ever think you'd
See right through the scars
Can you believe it's out there
It's your will to win
Things we'll keep forever
Let the war begin

We never let it die
We always steal the show
Never ones to wait around
Now the world will know

Sometimes in our lives
We all have the need
Sometimes giving up
All our hopes and dreams
Concentrate your anger
Release all of the pain
Get back all you lost
Take back yesterday
