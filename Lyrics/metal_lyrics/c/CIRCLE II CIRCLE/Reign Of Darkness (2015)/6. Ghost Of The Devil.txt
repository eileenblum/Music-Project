Look inside the curse of creation
There you'll find the source of damnation
Through the eyes of those who passed beyond
They only speak by tearing us apart

When I first got word of the vision
Got a sense of a new religion
I lost all sense of the outside
I turned away from a normal life

Got my high from a force so vicious
Came alive with an act of vengeance
Now I never want to live without it
Got to finish what I started
I can feel the power

Now we ride into the edge of night
To a world we've found
In the cover of darkness
Come lead us now
Eternal life is ours
Just submit your power
State yours final vows
To the ghost of the devil

Wasn't long 'til I knew I'd never die
Made friends with the dead on the other side
I can see their faces beckoning
I can hear their voices calling me
I can feel the power

Can you taste the madness?
Can you hear the laughter?
Can you feel the life is fading
My final thoughts escaping

Now we ride into the edge of night
To a world we've found
In the cover of darkness
Come lead us now
Eternal life is ours
Just submit your power
State yours final vows
To the ghost of the devil
