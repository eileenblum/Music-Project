[Lee / Stevens / Stewart]

In this strange situation
The future is so unclear
And I stop and think about the times
I tried to disappear

So I wait within the endless days
Reaching for the sun

Who am I to be?
You could never see
Always pretending
What you are to me
What am I to say?
When all you do is hate
Got some news
Nobody wins this game
This game

If I say I know the reasons
To implications that you bleed

Never knowing how to feel
Which one of me is real?

Who am I to be?
You could never see
Always pretending
What you are to me
What am I to say?
When all you do is hate
Got some news
Nobody wins this game
Nobody wins this game
It's all about yesterday
Gonna find a way
Someday

All the signs are there
So I'm on this tear
To right the bloody wrongs
To remain real strong
The approaching end
Threads of life were spent
Tried to justify
The decision's never mine

If I say I know the reasons
To the unforeseen
I've come to clear your conscience
Of the burdens
Of a thousand dreams

So I walk within the endless days
As I'm reaching for the sun

Who am I to be?
You could never see
Always pretending
What you are to me
What am I to say?
When all you do is hate
Got some news
Nobody wins this game
This game
