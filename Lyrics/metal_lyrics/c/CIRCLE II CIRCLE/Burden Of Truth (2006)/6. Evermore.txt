[Stevens / Stewart]

Enter the death angel's curse
And the fate
Behind the door
Into the cradle of dawn
Lies a trace of evermore
All the scars
Hide the hate
They have shown
Chosen to fall from
The forces unknown
Out of the darkness we crawl
To the place Evermore

Blood in his eyes
Feel his demise
Total control
Existing as though
You're resisting the cold

All of the people who tried
To make peace
And they died
All of their fortresses shine
Like the cross
As they ride
Never unfolding the truth
Still unknown
Altering consciousness
Evil has flown
Following mercy alone
The masses have grown

Ruling the streets
Deliver deceit
Deceiver in darkness
Believers are sought
And their souls are possessed

Blood in his eyes
Feel his demise
Total control
Existing as though
You're resisting the cold

Enter the death angel's curse
And the fate
Behind the door
Into the cradle of dawn
Lies a trace of evermore
All the scars
Hide the hate
They have shown
Chosen to fall from
The forces unknown
Out of the darkness we crawl
To the place Evermore
