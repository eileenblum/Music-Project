[Stevens / Stewart]

Listen close to the sound
As it travels through the night
How could we live to see
A time when we walk holy ground
Like it was a given right
How could it ever be

All this desperation
Leading us in vein
Hopeless alteration
To the world
We sought to gain

Life has a price to be learned
Through the lessons of our time
How could we ever hear
The cries overcome
As we fought
For the vengeance of a crime
Though it was never clear

All my life I've known this
I never would confide
Into a fate of loneliness
I throw my wounds aside
To find you

How can we learn to live as one
How can we run from things we've done
Could we ever let it go
How can we learn to live as one
Is there nothing left to follow

All this desperation
Leading us in vein
Hopeless alteration
To the world
We sought to gain

How can we learn to live as one
How can we run from things we've done
Could we ever let it go
How can we learn to live as one
Is there nothing left to follow

How can we see
Through another's eyes
How could we learn
To sympathize
Could patience protect us
From the fall
How can we see
Through the blinding rain
How can we leave this life of pain
Could emotions hide the truth at all
