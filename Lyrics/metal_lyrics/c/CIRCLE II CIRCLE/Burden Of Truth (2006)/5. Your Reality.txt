[Stevens / Stewart]

Voices calling out for yesterday
Painting pictures
Of souls who've lost the way
Hopes are falling
Through the hands of the betrayed
All searching
For the same thing
Were they ever saved

Tell me what's inside of you
Is it really over now
Are you falling into silence
As the war divides
All I ask of you
When the willingness is blind
Hold together
Will you ever survive
If this is your reality

Winter's calling out for a new day
Thought the feeling
Is so long decayed
Running in circles
Longing for the faith
To lead them to a better place
Were they ever saved

Tell me what's inside of you
Is it really over now
Are you falling into silence
As the war divides
All I ask of you
When the willingness is blind
Hold together
Souls endeavor
Will you ever survive
If this is your reality

How will you deal with things
You perceive as real
What's left to offer
Time to reach right down
Into what you feel
At the cost of trust
Would they seek you again

Pray for the lost
For the meaning has died
Hate for the men
Who betrayed us
Twisting of words
Like the mirrors
Will hide
Knowing your soul still burns
Where do you turn

Tell me what's inside of you
Is it really over now
Are you falling into silence
As the war divides
All I ask of you
When the willingness is blind
Through the word of God
You painted a world
Full of lies
Hold together
Souls endeavor
Will we ever survive
