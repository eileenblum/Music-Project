[Stevens / Stewart]

I walk alone
Along a winding road
Filled with thoughts
Recovering from all left behind
I passed a church
And saw the children
And the world
Through their eyes
The greatest gift
We ever could receive

Hold the ways of the Son
Am I the only one?
Hold the weight of your soul
In mine
I hope that you are the one
Sent to guide me on
Can't you see
Nothing can hold me down
I can't turn away

With your past in disguise
All the pain
Still in your eyes
I know that I must
But I never can trust
Keeping you in the dark
Feel the strange desire
From the passion
In your eyes
Awake and alone
But I've just got to know
I'm keeping you in the dark

I wonder if
I would have come here
Not knowing who I am
By the force of the truth
I will stand
So I thank you once again
For giving me the news
And protecting me
Through the hate
That will proceed

Hold the ways of the Son
Changes from now on
Hold the weight of your soul
In mine
I hope that you understand
Held within my hands
Can't you see
Nothing can hold me down
I can't turn away

With your past in disguise
All the pain
Still in your eyes
I know that I must
But I never can trust
Keeping you in the dark
Like the wind rushing by
Like a memory deep inside
Awake and alone
But I've just got to know
I'm keeping you in the dark

Rulers of the world
Seeing changes
But the choice
Is not your own
It won't return
Voices with a creed
A reflection
Of a modern prophecy
They will find you

Find a new horizon
In the ways
That we have found
And we'll find
A better life
Like the times we had

Gotta find a reason
Gotta make it seem alright
Out of all the questions
Something is coming
To bring us closer
To the light
