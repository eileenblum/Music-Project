[Stevens / Stewart]

Days of waiting
Are behind me
I see the moment's come
Fate is revealed
My body wasted
By this sacrificial pain
What's the reason
For the damage I sustained

Hear you somewhere
Feel you calling

Don't want to let you go
Never could let it show
Why do I always trust you
I'll never let it go
I've carried on the line
And made the most of time
Waiting for this day to arrive

I wonder if you're out there
Understand the darkest needs
Are never fair
I'm the prey
That they are hunting down
Turned a slave
For the wearing of the crown

Hear you somewhere
Feel you calling

Are you somewhere
Can you whisper
Hear you calling
Someone listen

Don't want to let you go
Never could let it show
Why do I always trust you
I'll never let it go
I've carried on the line
And made the most of time
Waiting for this day to arrive
