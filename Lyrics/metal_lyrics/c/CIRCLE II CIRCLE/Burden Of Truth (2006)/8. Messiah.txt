[Stevens / Stewart]

Virtual darkness
Imposing disturbance
Forcing of will
Upon the innocents
Dawn of a new day
Losing what they deserved
Kneel down and pray
And hope it will be heard

Still the world keeps turning
Through the maze of lies
I am returning
To replace your lives
Feel them closing in
Follow me this night
Blood is their desire
Enter the new Messiah

Inform the people
The healing will begin
Wrought with evil
Appearing deep within
A soul's possessions
Converted into sin
I lead the resistance
A fight that we must win

Still the world keeps turning
Through the maze of lies
I am returning
To replace your lives
Feel them closing in
Follow me this night
Blood is their desire
Enter the new Messiah
