[Stevens / Stewart]

You know it's just a matter of time
Until we come
To see the light
It's really not a question
Of whether men had sought
To deify
And so we seek
To cast away the visions of the order
Take away destruction of time
Until it's over

Will you hold on forever
Through the pain that held you inside
Will you say you'll never
Never see truth in the lies

The wheels keep spinning around
Inside a world that's held in doubt
Forever losing sight
Of the things that kept us down

Will you hold on forever
To the change that held you down
Believe you'll never
Abandon the way that you found

I see the world
Threatened by the darkness
Covered in a haze
Of troubles and sadness
Taken over now
Controlled by the liars
The pilates are the ways
Of the demons
Held inside

Will you hold on forever
Through the pain that held you inside
Will you say you'll never
Never see truth in the lies

You know it's just a matter of time
Until we come
To see the light
The wheels keep spinning around
Silence the questions
In your mind
So we seek
To cast away the visions
In our lives
You know it's just a matter of time
