[Lee / Stevens / Stewart]

Now I walk alone
Every waking hour
This power
I make my own
I'm not who I've been
Everything is changing
Arranging this flight within

They're looking for something
Racing through this mad life
There's only one thing
We can take this time

I can show you
I control you
Welcome to my life
I know you
I'll conceal you
I can heal you
Of what you have become

Now this time's arrived
Every waking moment
I wanted to feel alive
Breaking from the past
I know I'll never have to
Go back through
Those places
At long last

All of us falling
On the sacred roads they've led us
Hear the calling
They will never forget us

I can show you
I control you
Welcome to my life
I know you
I'll conceal you
I can heal you
Of what you have become
