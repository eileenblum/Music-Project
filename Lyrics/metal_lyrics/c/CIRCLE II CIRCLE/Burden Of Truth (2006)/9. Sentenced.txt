[Lee / Stevens / Stewart]

The silence grows
Desperation seeping through my skin
Desecration holds
I'm praying for a light within

All the violence within myself
I know you always tried to help
You will never see
The sentence that was handed to me

Just another day of longing
Just another day I hope will bring
The silence of an early morning
Leave it all behind
To find a chance to begin
Again

Spent a life
Confiding in myself
Wasting in this
Final stretch of hell

There's no sense to anything
While I'm hanging from this string
Only seems to reason
The closer it gets
The harder it is to reach

Just another day of longing
Just another day I hope will bring
The silence of an early morning
Leave it all behind
To find a chance to begin
Again

Why does it always have to end?
I had all the perfect things
Never feels like things will change
All that's left are fears and shame

Now I'm calling out
But no one ever answers
Already been afforded
All the second chances

There's no sense to anything
While I'm hanging from this string
Only seems to reason
The closer it gets
The harder it is to reach

Just another day of longing
Just another day I hope will bring
The silence of an early morning
Leave it all behind
To find a
Just another day of torture
Just another reason to begin
Searching for a final answer
Looking back to see
Just who I am
Search for an answer
Again
