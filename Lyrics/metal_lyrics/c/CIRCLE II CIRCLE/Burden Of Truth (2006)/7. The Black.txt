[Lee / Stevens / Stewart]

Into the black
With a final chance to save my soul
Waiting for something
To release me from this hold

I feel the cold wind through me
Like I've been set free
I guess it's never set in stone
I'm headed home

Destruction taking hold
Etched upon your face
It's all that you can take
Let the demons go

Into the black
With a final chance to save my soul
Waiting for something
To release me from this hold

I'm heading out tonight
A season lives and dies
My inner world is a child
A phantom in the dark
Watch the waves go by
Until they drift apart
Waiting for the end
Let the pain begin

I see the lightning glow
Like the inner child
Watch the waves go by
Let the demons go

Into the black
With a final chance to save my soul
Waiting for something
To release me from this hold
Into the black
With a final chance
To rule the world
Enter the power of the force
That's taking hold

Dealing with the complications
Pressure from the expectations
When you look inside
At what you chose to hide
Living with the persecution
Problems with the institution
The future's gone away
And the world is filled with hate

Into the black
With a final chance to save my soul
Nothing but hurt
But the truth of your destiny
Is worse
Into the black
With a final chance
To rule the world
Enter the power of the force
That's taking hold
