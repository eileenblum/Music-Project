Life is like the night
Drifting aimlessly
A course for which we sail
Sorrow's sweet release
Reflecting in the words you say

Too blind to know
We never show
The part of us that knows

See the walls created
All the time we're fascinated
Mirrors distract from the truth
That stands right there
Waiting for you

Never knew dreams lead to a dark despair
Have you felt the eyes of a demon stare
Never felt the same things
That you will inside this night
Remember when the end
Of emotion was here
Forever in the wake
Of an ocean of fear
We're stealing the day
And we're running away tonight

Surrender to the past
Inside this lonely time
I believe there's something
Covered in the lies
On their wings salvation flies
Written in the sands of time
Souls appear at last

Painting shadows
Of the visions
Spinning all around you
If you care to know
The questions of the past have found you

Never knew dreams lead to a dark despair
Have you felt the eyes of a demon stare
Never felt the same things
That you will inside this night
Lost along the way
To the unknown side
Helpless in the way
That you're feeling this time
We're stealing the day
And we're running away tonight
