I feel your presence when I walk into the room
I see the vision of a face that I once knew
I feel your whispers when no one hears a word
And I know your voice will never go unheard

You better not run
I'm here tonight
And we are one

Lonely nights by candlelight
I swear I've seen you there
Winter finds me
Searching out
I'm captured in your stare
Voices I can't seem to find
They speak without a sound
Knowing that you're there
Is all that matters now

What have you become
What is to be
When our days are done

Lonely nights by candlelight
I swear I've seen you there
Winter finds me
Searching out
I'm captured in your stare
Voices I can't seem to find
They speak without a sound
Knowing that you're there
Is all that matters now

You better not run
Why am I
The chosen one

Lonely nights by candlelight
I swear I've seen you there
Winter finds me
Searching out
I'm captured in your stare
Voices I can't seem to find
They speak without a sound
Knowing that you're there
Is all that matters now
