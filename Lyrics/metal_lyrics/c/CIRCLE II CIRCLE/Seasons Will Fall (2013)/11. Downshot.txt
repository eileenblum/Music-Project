I'm looking around
For some kind of trouble
I'm looking to find
Some friends of me

Been a long time coming
I'm not turning back
This time I'll take it all
Into my hands

'Cause I'm downshot
But I'm not gonna let it stop me
I'm downshot
Looking down the road ahead
I'm downshot
But I'm picking up the pieces
I'm downshot
And I'm never gonna let it end

I'm on the run
One place to another
Gotta get it done
I'm the only one

I've been a long time
Running the wrong side of the track
It's time to make my way
While I still can

'Cause I'm downshot
But I'm not gonna let it stop me
I'm downshot
Looking down the road ahead
I'm downshot
But I'm picking up the pieces
I'm downshot
And I'm never gonna let it end
I won't let it end

Been a long time coming
I'm not turning back
Been a long time
Since I've been on the attack

Downshot
But I'm never gonna let it stop me
Downshot
Looking down the road ahead
Downshot
But I'm picking up the pieces
Downshot
And I'm never gonna let it end
