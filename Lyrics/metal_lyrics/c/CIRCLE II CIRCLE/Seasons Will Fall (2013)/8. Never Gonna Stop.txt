I was standing in a world out on the edge
Waiting for it all to stop
I really must confess
It was cold and in the night I was alone
Hiding from the things you sought
For reasons still unknown

In the silence of this night
I feel your presence there
Calling from the visions
Of this cold nightmare

I'm never gonna stop
Never gonna hesitate
I got a little taste
Now I know it just won't wait
You got me running wild
And I feel it burning deep inside
I'm ready for the ride
My soul is free to fly

Hear the whispers
Of the words but no one's there
I know I'm not alone
But no one ever understands
Within the remnants of this place
That stood before
The vision of your face appears
A hint of what's in store

All at once I feel a change
Something's on the brink
I feel your sweet salvation
And it's clear to see

I'm never gonna stop
Never gonna hesitate
I got a little taste
Now I know it just won't wait
You got me running wild
Feel it burning deep inside
I'm ready for the ride
My soul is free to fly

I'm never gonna stop
Never gonna hesitate
I got a little taste
Now I know it just won't wait
You got me running wild
I got a feeling burning deep inside
I'm ready for the ride
My soul is free to fly
I'm never gonna stop
You know I'm never gonna hesitate
I got a little taste
Now I know it just won't wait
You know you got me with your fire
I got a feeling burning deep inside
I'm ready for the ride
My soul is free tonight
