Gather round
Collect your fears
I know the story well
You'll believe
It's all so clear
The lies we often tell

In the pages
Of this life
That somehow twist
Your head around
Feel the raging will
To fight for things
You want right now

No one can help us
No one decides
Deep in isolation
We were left to die
No one can find us
We can only pray
It's our destination
To live another day

Save your tears don't allow
Weakness to prevail
All the years all this time
Is now a distant haze

And though everything
Dropped out from under you
So long ago times are so uncertain
You're afraid to try alone

No one can help us
No one this time
Deep in isolation
The future is denied
No can find us
We can only pray
It's our destination
To live another day

No one can help us
No one this time
Deep in isolation
The future is denied
