Just when you think
It's all been settled and
There's nothing wrong
You're losing sight of where
This all might lead
And where it's gone

We live inside the darkness
Our hopes run free tonight
With every thought that beckons
For another try

So many years we spent
Just going through the motions
With no real sunrise
Coming clear on the horizon

You write the ending all alone
The yearning never died
Although the truth is still untold
No one seems to mind

In the shadows of sweet despair
In the window you see there's nothing there
Just when you thought it could change forever
You let it slip away
In the shadows of sweet despair
In your soul it seems there's nothing left
You got a taste of what you wanted

Just when you think it's all been written
And the ending's done

Although you fight for all it's worth
You see your dreams denied
But every part of you that hurts
Will refuse to die

In the shadows of sweet despair
In the window you see there's nothing there
Just when you thought it could change forever
You let it slip away
In the shadows of sweet despair
In your soul it seems there's nothing left
You got a taste of what it meant

In the shadows of sweet despair
Everything you lost will come to find you there
Just when you thought it could change forever
You let it slip away
In the shadows of sweet despair
In the center of your soul there's nothing left
You got a taste of what you wanted
