Who would've thought
That things could change so fast
Who would've thought you'd be
Sitting here reflecting on the past
We always like to think
It's gonna last forever

Everybody's got some things
They want to try
Everybody's hopes they're gonna leave
Some kind of mark on this life
You gave it your all in the end my friend

You promised you'd never go
Walking through this crazy life alone
Nobody ever knew just what was wrong
Never leading on just hiding
Like a ghost within your song
Never letting life get in the way
You never knew how much you had
Now all that's left
Are pictures of the past

You're gone for now
But a part of you remains
We hear the sound
Every note you ever played
You gave us something we could believe in
It was only yesterday

You never thought
It all could change so fast
You never thought you'd be
Sitting here reflecting on the past
We always like to think
It's gonna last forever

Yes it's over now
But the questions are the same
I don't know how
But we justify the pain
You gave us something we could believe in
It was only yesterday
