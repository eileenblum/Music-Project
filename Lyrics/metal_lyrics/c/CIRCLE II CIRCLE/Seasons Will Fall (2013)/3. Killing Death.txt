For years I'd given up
Thought that it was done
I said for what it's worth
I'd pretty much seen everything
That's gonna come my way
I think of all the time
Wasted down the line
We'd sit back and take
But there comes a day
When you can't hesitate

I'm never looking back
At the shattered past

All the time it hurts
I remember the words you said
I never thought
I'd see the world like this
I'm killing death
You've given me the courage
You gave me confidence
To never be afraid of life
Afraid of killing death

At times I think of you
You changed my point of view
But when you disappeared
I had to learn to get by
Somehow justify the tears

I'll run through this life
Find a place to hide
My fire burning
Somewhere deep inside

All the time it hurts
I remember the words you said
I never thought
I'd see the world like this
I'm killing death
You gave me confidence
To never be afraid of life
Afraid of killing death

Yes I'm still alive
Yearning to be found again
A fire deep inside
Take me to
Whatever waits at the end

All the time it hurts
I remember the words you said
I never thought
I'd see the world like this
I'm killing death
You've given me the courage
You gave me confidence
To never be afraid of life
Afraid of killing death
