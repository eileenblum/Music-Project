You there, searching for
A brand new day

Used to dream, now you're living
Through the pain

Full of laughs, full of lies
And we all just, see our passing lives
On the edge of time

Somewhere in the distance
When I came to my senses
I could see the smoke and rain
You're a saint yet a sinner
You're a hopeful disbeliever
Situation's all the same
Open up the silence
Always hiding from the pain
You're the drug that feeds the violence
Running through my veins
I can see the tomorrow is far away

Winter fades like mist on the horizon
Nothing's really what it seems to be
Summers always say goodbye forever
And the seasons will fall
All the pain will bleed
Lies you will believe

It's a strange situation
The walls of your temptations
Are falling apart again
Feeling your desire
In your arms I'm really dying

Whatever it takes
To see the end
Take me over
Take this world
From under me
The places I can take you
No one else could ever see

I could see the sunrise yesterday

Winter fades like mist on the horizon
Nothing's really what it seems to be
Summers always say goodbye forever
And the seasons will fall

Here I am
Far away
Like an ordinary day
I wanted you
Like no one else
Now I chase
The pain away
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I only had the reasons why
On the edge of time

Winter fades like mist on the horizon
Nothing's really what it seems to be
Summers always say goodbye forever
And the seasons will fall
All the pain will bleed
