Running in the distance
From everything you see
Afraid to hear the answers
In the darkness of your deeds
Promises delivered
You don't intend to keep
Lost in your reflection
My troubles far too deep

If you think
The past is thrown away
There's no hiding
From those days of pain

I see the way
That you deal your demise
Cutting through me like a diamond blade
Leaving me helpless
I fear the way
That I look into your eyes
Running through me like a diamond blade
Holding on for dear life

There is no resistance
You know my weakness well
And in time you'll offer lies
And wrap me in your spell
The lesson to the story
A modern tragedy
I knew the ending well before
But only you could see

When the future
Shows itself today
Time won't change things
They happen anyway

I see the way
That you deal your demise
Cutting through me like a diamond blade
Leaving me helpless
I fear the way
That I look into your eyes
Running through me like a diamond blade
Revealing your disguise

Once again I'm losing pieces of my soul
I try with all my strength but
I don't want to be alone
Should I seize the chance to break away
Far from all this pain

If you think
The past is thrown away
There's no hiding
From those days of pain

I see the way
That you deal your demise
Cutting through me like a diamond blade
Leaving me helpless
I fear the way
That I look into your eyes
Running through me like a diamond blade
Holding on for dear life
