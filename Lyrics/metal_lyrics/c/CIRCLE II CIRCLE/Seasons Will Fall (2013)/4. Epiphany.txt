Things are quickly changing
Everything I knew before
Somehow disappeared
All this time of looking away
Not believing was the easy road to take

Come here, save me
From this nightmare, calling for me

I would never have known you
There's a question how you came to be
Why was I the one you found
How am I the one you see

All this time you've waited
While I simply faded
Now I'm lost and you've come to me

In the places we hide the sadness
Are the things we lost somehow
Seems we're missing all the answers
Though we're searching all around
In the forest of all the nightmares
All the feelings we've lost inside
Sometimes all of the years
Are stories we've yet to write

All this time of hesitating
All my dreams were fast escaping
In my life
I've never known where it would lead
All this time I can't replace it

All the while my soul has faded
Withered in the darkness
Longing to release the bitterness

Loneliness will help the healing
If you're lost and out there fading away
Fight for the strength to follow
Inspiration all at once
Back to a place
We had in our younger days

In the places we hide the sadness
Are the things we lost somehow
Seems we're missing all the answers
Though we're searching all around
In the forest of all the nightmares
All the feelings we've lost inside
Sometimes all of the years
Are stories we've yet to write

In the shadows that hide the madness
There are so many tears to hide
Fears expose the face you see
That stands before your eyes
Maybe all of the years of searching
Maybe all of the visions in vein
Are the difference in what we envisioned
And what remains
