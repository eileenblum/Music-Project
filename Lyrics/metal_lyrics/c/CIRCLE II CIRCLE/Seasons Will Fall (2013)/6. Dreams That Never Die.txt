For a while
It seemed like everything we hoped for
Would come true
We were confused
For a time
It felt like every road
Was there for us to choose
We were born to lose

Darker days have since gone by
Apparitions in the light
The minutes will turn to years so fast
And the truth outlives the past

I feel a change coming on
I've seen the worst of it all
The sky is opening
The end is closer
I see the walls coming down
I hear all the sounds
Leave the tears behind
In desperation you try
To hold them inside
There forever
Dreams that never die

After all we've seen
Would you believe we're standing
On the brink of prophecy
The days are passing by
Like thoughts that race
Across the midnight sky
Can you hear the lies

Don't you feel the longing in you heart
Did you play a different part
Controlled by the years you hold inside
Shadows reveal the fears you hide

I feel a change coming on
I've seen the worst of it all
The sky is opening
The end is closer
I see the walls coming down
I hear all the sounds
Nothing left to hide
In desperation you try
To hold them inside
There forever
Dreams that never die

All of us drowning in worlds of sorrow
Nothing will set us free

Can't you see
All of the faces
With empty stares
They're walking along
Never trying to see

Don't you know that
Dreams they never die
They never look behind
Never in disguise
Somewhere in your mind
Never meant to leave
Soon everyone will see
The truth will set you free
Inside all your dreams

All the world can see
Darker days have since gone by
Won't you come into the light
The minutes will turn to years so fast
The truth will always outlive the past

I feel a change coming on
I've seen the worst of it all
The sky is opening
The end is closer
I see the walls coming down
I hear all the sounds
Leave the tears behind
In desperation you try
To hold them inside
There forever
Dreams that never die
