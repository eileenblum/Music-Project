You know it's over
Turning twisting
always awake from the chill of another day
Wild
From never sleeping
Methamphetamine for the last time

And if you reach the surface
Where will you hide
And when you find the answer
Look inside
While you chase the lies

You say it's all done
Wretched in your hatred and your false ideology
I
Will hold you to everything you've done
No matter what you try

And if you solve the question
One more time
Avoid disaster
Look inside
While you chase the lies

And if you reach the surface
Where will you hide
And when you find the answer
Look inside
While you chase the lies

And if you solve the question
One more time
Avoid disaster
Look inside
While you chase the lies
