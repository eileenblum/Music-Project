Just another
Cold and misty morning shining through
How could someone
Make my life so tangled like you do
Hanging tough
Won't cover for the things
We're running from
Sacrifice won't pay the price
For what's to come

I can overcome you
I can look right through your eyes
Gotta keep on riding the rolling tide
I can give my soul to you
I can never lose the fight
So many reasons I don't believe in

I am numb to the fact that all I had
Was stripped away
I succumb to the usual surroundings day to day
All these things I see
But I never really care
Wandering around in a hopeless stare

I can overcome you
I can look right through your eyes
Gotta keep on riding the rolling tide
I can give my soul to you
I can never lose the fight
So many reasons I don't believe anymore

I can overcome you
I can look right through your eyes
Gotta keep on riding the rolling tide
I can give my soul to you
I can never lose the fight
So many reasons I don't believe in
So many reasons I don't need it
So many reasons I don't believe anymore
