I face the changes and the way things have fallen
I look away and see reflections in the lies calling

Feel the war inside
It crushes everything
And though I fight
Shadows still remain

It's somewhere
So you look for a door
It's all there
But no one knows
In the wilderness I stand as one
Maybe I'll find a crack in the sun
Where silence
Waits for me
In the dead of dawn

I need a sanctuary from the lives I've broken
I look away in silent rage
The words remain unspoken

All the wounds inside
They conquer everything
All the hurt you find
Will shortly fade away

It's somewhere
So you look for a door
It's all there
But no one knows
Will it start when the ashes descend
Is this just the beginning of the end
Where silence
Waits for me
In the dead of dawn

All the times you tried
To conquer everything
Through the rise and fall
It always ends the same

It's somewhere
So you look for a door
It's all there
But no one knows
In the wilderness I stand as one
Maybe I'll find a crack in the sun
Where silence
Waits for me
In the dead of dawn
