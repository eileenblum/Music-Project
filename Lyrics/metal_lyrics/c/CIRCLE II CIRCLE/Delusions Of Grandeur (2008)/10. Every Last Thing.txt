As I look through the night
Memories are weighing on my mind
Of all we left undone
Then I look honestly
At everything that we tried to be
Hoping no one sees what I've become

Headed for the rain
In a restless summer
Spiraling within your pain
While you run away
The days have been so long
Since the time you left us
But I know that where you are
You'll hear my silent call

I've had all I can take
And I'm not gonna make it too long
You said all this would carry on
I've been here too long

Don't want to regret that I can't run away from you now
I'm willing to give every last thing
I'll make it somehow
Time ain't a friend and I can't run away from the dark
Never again will I play the part

With a dying mind
Without a destination
Waiting for the past to align
Before you will decide
Before they conquer all
Justice is descending
As we watch them build the wall
Hear my silent call

Every possible fate that I could have imagined
Was wrong
After all of the magic is gone
I've been here too long

Don't want to regret that I can't run away from you now
I'm willing to give every last thing
I'll make it somehow
Time ain't a friend and I can't run away from the dark
Never again will I play the part

All that's left inside us
Is a world that will divide us
And the depth of all the silence
'Cause the worst has come

I feel the weight of the world fall
Heavy upon my soul
I see a fate underscored by escaping the earth

I've had all I can take
And I'm not gonna make it too long
You said all this would carry on
I've been here too long

Don't want to regret that I can't run away from you now
I'm willing to give every last thing
I'll make it somehow
Time ain't a friend and I can't run away from the dark
Never again will I play the part
