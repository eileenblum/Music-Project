Stop everything
Too late to see
Then you feel the moment of darkness
That's when you forget
Everything they said
Then you're headed back to the fortress
Hard to define
The past has denied
Serving as a grim reminder
The way it went down
Came back around
What we thought was behind us

You know it's a fatal warning
Wouldn't believe what you would find there
You know it's a war they started
Over the seas of regrets

When you brought me down through the fire
Opened up my mind to desire
All the things I learned to rely on
All the dreams I left here to fine
Are now gone

Nothing to see
Obvious to me
Then you feel the moment's upon you
Could they conceive
What's come to be
Now you rest in solitude

Met your demise to their delight
So many souls forsaken
Could not believe
What the end will bring
Can't repay what's been taken

You know it's a fatal warning
Wouldn't believe what you would find there
You know it's a war they started
Over the seas of regrets

When you brought me down through the fire
Opened up my mind to desire
All the things I expect to depend on
All the dreams about to descend
Are now gone
