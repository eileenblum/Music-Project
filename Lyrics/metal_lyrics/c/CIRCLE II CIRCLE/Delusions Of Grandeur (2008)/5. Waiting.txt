After all the things that happened
Way too fast
After all the traces buried in the pasty
Now I know the time has come
Now I know
I'm on the path that I'm supposed to run
It's getting closer

Nothing can hold me down
The waiting is over
I won't be led to ruin
I'm standing on the ground
The waiting is over
What's done is over now

The feeling is mutual
I'm sure that you can see
Always speaking words that
Don't really mean anything
Bearing down a heavy load
Cutting it close is all I've ever really known
I'm getting closer

Nothing can hold me down
The waiting is over
I won't be led to ruin
I'm standing on the ground
The waiting is over
What's done is over now

Now the remnants of the world
That I once knew
Stand before me
Cast in honor of the chosen few
I'll be looking forward too

Remembering the greatest days were the ones
I spent with you
I'm keeping them closer

Nothing can hold me down
The waiting is over
I won't be led to ruin
I'm standing on the ground
The waiting is over
What's done is over now
