(You) You've died inside
(Why?) Nowhere to hide
(Lost) Inside an empty room

(All) Your life is gone
(Time) Can't heal the wrong
(Now) It seems you're on your own

You're not alone
Just too far from home
You've traveled so far

But you could be forgiven
Someday

I've seen night turn to day, turn to night
In the loneliest light
Far away, from the day
Hides the loneliest life
What a waste, all betrayed
Because you can't seem to
Fly away from the storm

(Now) Please understand
(God) God lent his hand
(You) As always turned away
(Now) It's all but lost
(Try) To bear the cross
(Stay) I'll chase your fears away

No, now you're not alone
You're too far from home
You traveled too far

And you could be forgiven
Someday

I've seen night turn to day turn to night
In the loneliest light
Far away, from the day
Hides the loneliest life
What a waste, all betrayed
Because you can't seem to
Fly away from the storm

Turning and burning and yearning
It's all about learning and knowing
We never quite know what it's showing
And anytime it could be taking you down

You feel so high
But someday we'll find you

Alone, alone, alone, alone

Turning and burning and yearning
It's all about learning and knowing
We never quite know what it's showing
And anytime it could be taking you down

What made you fly
Where no one could touch you?

I've seen night turn to day turn to night
In the loneliest light
Far away, from the day
Hides the loneliest life
What a waste, all betrayed
Because you can't seem to
Fly away from the storm
