In the darkness that feeds your mind
In your cavernous seething eyes
You lost some things you never could replace
Tell me why
I see the forces that drive you
Who said I?
For you it's too late to see
Tell me why
Will they make you feel righteous?
Hear the cries 
They'll flash their twisted faces across my screen

In a world ruled by obsession
Seeking retribution
Breathing pure aggression
A reflection of the hate that you must breed 
You're out of reach
Out of reach 

So you got to keep on with your sinister life
It's too late to change your mind 
Your end will be violent and abrupt
Make sure what's done is done 

Tell me why
I see the forces inside you
Who said I?
For you it's too late to see 
Tell me why
Does it make you feel righteous?
To flash their twisted faces across my screen 

In a world ruled by obsession
Seeking retribution
Breathing pure aggression 
A reflection of the hate that you must breed 

You're out of reach
You're out of reach
Out of reach 
You're out of reach 
Out of reach
