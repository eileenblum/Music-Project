I float against the tide
Alone against this cold, cold feeling
Never knowing why 
Refusing just to see
What became of
All these things inside 
I wish someone
Would somehow try and reach me 
I will never be the one to stay
While we waste away
Throw my whole life into the wind 
Never thought of words to say
Wouldn't matter anyway
In another world I seem to have been 

I look at where it's gone
Never really seeing
All the emptiness so long
It's hollow now inside 
Swallowing the bitterness
You left behind 
The fears can finally now subside 

I will never be the one to stay
While we waste away
Threw my whole life into the wind 
Never thought of words to say
Wouldn't matter anyway
In another world I seem to have been 
Time for waking up again
To escape the sin
Don't know where I need to begin 

Who's the one to blame?
You know you're all your afraid of
What life's really all about 
I seek a space in time
Where everything is really nothing
Nothing to figure out 
Nothing to think about 

I will never be the one to stay
While we waste away
Threw my whole life into the wind 
Never thought of words to say
Wouldn't matter anyway
In another world I seem to have been 

Time for waking up again
To escape the sin
Don't know where I need to begin 
I would never be the one to say
As I face the day 
Threw my chances into 
Into the wind
