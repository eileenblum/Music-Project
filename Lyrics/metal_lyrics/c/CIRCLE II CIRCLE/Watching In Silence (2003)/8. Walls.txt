I turn away
There's nothing to see here
Only a distant memory
Of how things really were 
Supposed to be 
And life moves on
Ever so quickly
I see my past it flashes by
Like the stars in the sky flickering 

And the years come around
Years come around
I'm left here praying
That the tears falling down 
Tears falling down
Are worth me saving
And I don't know how to go on 

Tear down the walls of your life
You can't stop them anymore
Tear down the walls of your life 
And find your way 

How long
Can this life carry on? 
How long
Watch the walls 
Watch them burning down 
How long 
How long must we run? 

I lost my way
When I was younger
I regret lots of things I did
Just maybe I didn't give quite enough 

And the years turn around
Years turn around
Their faces fading
And the years going by
Years going by 
There's no replacing
And the souls will all carry on 

Tear down the walls of your life
You can't stop them anymore 
Tear down the walls of your life 
And find your way 

How long
Can this life carry on? 
How long
Watch the walls 
Watch them burning down 
How long
How long must we run? 

Tear down the walls 

How long
Can this life carry on?
How long
Watch the walls 
Watch them burning down 
How long
How long must we run?
