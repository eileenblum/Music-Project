In the dead of the night
There's something calling to me
I can see all these visions
Of insanity - Insanity

There's no way to control it
Feel adrenaline rise
All these things that I see
What are they telling me - Telling me?
Will they set me free -  Set me free?
Yes I've got to believe - Got to believe
It's unreal

Because I'm back in the circle
The circle tonight
All around me the faces
Reflect in my mind
I turned the page
Now I'm back in the circle
Back in the circle again

As I walk through the shadows
Filled with uncertainty
I get lost in this moment
Of insanity - Insanity

I have tried to make sense
Of the things that I see
I follow the light
'Cause it's my destiny - Destiny
Will it set me free - Set me free?
And I've got to believe - Got to believe
It's unreal

Because I'm back in the circle
The circle tonight
All around me the faces
Reflect in my mind
I turned the page
Now I'm back in the circle
Back in the circle again

I've got things going on - Inside my head
Seems so long I've been gone - This road has led
To everywhere
I'll never be the same at all

Because I'm back in the circle
The circle tonight
All around me the faces
Reflect in my mind
I turned the page
Now I'm back in the circle
Back in the circle again
Caught in the circle

You got to believe - Got to believe
What you're hoping to see - Hoping to see
What you want to believe - Want to believe
Is what you want it to be - Want it to be
Yes you got to believe - Got to believe
What you're hoping to see - Hoping to see
What you want to believe - Want to believe
Is what you want it to be - Want it to be
