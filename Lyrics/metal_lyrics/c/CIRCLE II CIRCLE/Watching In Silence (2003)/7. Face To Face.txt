As I walk around
Casting shadows on the ground
I begin to see it all 
In the aftermath
Things I can't put in the past
I try again to break the fall 
I don't know what it's like
To clear my head
Of all this craziness 
Coming at me
Lots of time spent
Doing all the same things 
In my haziness
I know you tried to save me
But I've already died 

Time to hate you
I forsake you
But I could never 
Replace you 
Should have never tried at all
Time, it breaks you
Time, it takes you 
I should have never tried to change you 

I am longing for a change
I'll reach the other side
I believe I'm face to face with time 

All these confrontations
Slowly rot the years
I just made them disappear 

Everybody's trying
To fill my head
With all this craziness
All around me 
All the time spent
Doing just the same things
In my haziness
I know you tried to save me 
But I've already died 

Time to hate you
I forsake you
But I could never 
Replace you 
Should have never tried at all
Time, it breaks you
Time, it breaks you 
I should have never tried to change you 

I am longing for a change
I'll reach the other side
I believe I'm face to face with time 

Time to hate you
I forsake you
But I could never 
Replace you
Should have never tried at all 
Time it breaks you
Time, it takes you
I should have never tried to change you 

I am longing for a change
To reach the other side
I've been waiting for the day 
That I will have to fight
I believe I'm face to face with time
