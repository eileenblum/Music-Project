Tell me what you feel inside
Maybe there's a way that
You can hide
From the world that you made 
In your state of inner rage 
Isn't hard to see right through
Penetrates your crystal shame
Look at what's become of you 
In this prison that you made 

I want to fly away
Take me to the edge of light
This place is not the same 
I'm drifting in my mind
Floating in a field of white
My soul has taken flight 

Somewhere buried deep within
Well beneath your surface skin
Is this thing a hold of you 
And there's not much I can do 

As you start with your descent
What's become of what it meant?
To consider what's at stake 
When all you ever do is break 

I want to fly away
Take me to the edge of light
This place is not the same 
I'm drifting in my mind
Floating in a field of white
My soul has taken flight
