Agony lives in my soul, 
passion haunts my mind, 
peace and chaos fight in my heart, 
in my dreams there is always daylight... 
Black was the day, 
Constant the flow of my tears... 
Black is the day, 
My yearning is invincible... 
Beauty surrounded me, 
Illusion was beauty made true... 
Beauty surrounds me, 
The dream is always there... 
I can hear the thunder of silence, 
I feel the cold in the middle of the flame... 
I see shadows of the invisible, 
I breathe where there is no air... 
I eat the bread that ran out yesterday, 
I am dumb but I cry Thy name... 
I regret the joy I have, 
I suffer from the happiness I wish for... 
I am a prisoner behind bars of freedom, 
I now sense the things that have never happened. 
Beauty surrounded me, 
Illusion was beauty made true... 
Beauty surrounds me, 
The Hope remains for ever...
