Night of moon and dreams...

We're stumbling around. for what?
When we leave, we leave for good
Darkness, shimmering cold
A night of moon and dreams

Our breath is getting slow
Silent movements in the night
Ancient riders in the sky
With the purpose of what?
Questions are coming and draining
Close and away like the sun and the rain

An ocean waiting dark - dark blue
In depths of dreams unconscious
The harmless cold, licks the skin
A night of moon and dreams
Versus the veil of reminder that once was
So flickering and light like the blood in the veins
Transporting the life

Turn around and back again
A sight forever lost
Turn around and back again
A sight forever lost

Moments of eternity, in front of our feet
Curtains on fire, far away
This is a night of moon and dreams

Let's jump off the building
And watch our strange bodies
Lying bloody against that wonderful ground
I have no more thoughts
No more wisdom

Asking the question:
What are you afraid of?
I must ask you to ponder this,
Why do we fear?
Is it because courage isn't natural?
When the body experiences a sudden jolt
It cries out through pain
Awakening you to the absurdity of your actions
Perhaps the body cries out with fear because
Just as life is pain
The universe is terrifyingly cold - vast
The universe harbors inside its every molecule
That desire to feed

An ocean waiting dark - dark blue
In depths of dreams unconscious
The harmless cold, licks the skin
A night of moon and dreams
Versus the veil of reminder that once was
So flickering and light like the blood in the veins
Transporting the life

Turn around and back again
A sight forever lost
Turn around and back again
A sight forever lost

Though you can never see
But eternity has past
Now I stand in front of the mountain
And shiver in fear
I see my life before me in dark blue clouds
Go on, take me home now
Cause I shiver in fear
