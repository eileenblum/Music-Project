Alone in silence I seek the Lord, reveal to me your holy spirit O Lord 
Cleanse me in thy holy blood, forever shed for me 

Lord, I am seeking you, come and fill my soul 
One day I will meet you when I reach my goal 

No more sorrow, no more tears 
I will bow before you and you will wipe my tears

Thanks to dyslexicpanda110 for sending track #3 lyrics.
