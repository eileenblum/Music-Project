Lost in the heart of cold
Powerless on the ocean of grief
I realize once more the advent of grim hour
I still sense death, the black death
Your rigid name is desolation
Your embrace is constant pain
Was I wrapped up
Under barren rocks in the desert?
Was I banished
To the womb of the underworld?
Nobody saw, Nobody heard
Nobody wished to see
Nobody wished to hear
In memory of time
In memory of joy

Before my eyes there is again an armoury
At my foot there are books
With mumuring clear water
Stubbornly I wander ahead
Complaining of thirst and wounds from battles
As if I didn't want to see
As if I didn't want to hear

Time has come to cover one's sword in blood
Time has come to sound the battle cry

Earthly vanity surrounds me
Forsooth, a chasing for winds
There is nothing new under the sun
No green sprouts in the desert of life
Am I still a slave of emptiness?
Did I lose the fight that once I won?
Naked and disguisting I regard the dark reflection
Do I myself create my wondering?
Will I lie dormant
When the fight for existence draws near?
My wish is to see
My wish is to hear!

Time has come to cover one's sword in blood
Time has come to sound the battle cry!

Scorned, whipped. left, killed.
In truth I see the master of the domination
For me sacrificed
For you sacrificed
In memory of time
In memory of eternity

The bitter curse of grief goes to its final rest
The black mantle of death has fallen away and dissolved

Time has come to cover one's sword in blood
Time has come to sound the battle cry!
