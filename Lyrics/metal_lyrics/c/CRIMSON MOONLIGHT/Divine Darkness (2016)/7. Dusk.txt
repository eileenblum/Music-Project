Each brick of ice held in firmly in its place
With my bitter and salty tears once criedâ¦
Decorated in the golden glow of my shed blood
And laced with fragile lines of lost hope

Asphyxiation occurring with cognitions
Pastilleâs crowned reality to halt the yearned
Intimate whispers fall upon raven winds

Repeated fallacies to create
This tainted reverie surrounding
Solitude beseeches the presence of confused
With crimson rivers hindering attachment

Pain manifests with unanswered devotions
Resting beneath something greater intangible

Only burdening hands of tickling meter
Will expose the foreordain closer
But never allowing anyone neither in nor out
You are close to breaking through my walls

Another dawn to pass the recess of loveless
Another dusk to fade in confine of grey scales
Another day to without a face or expression
Atrophied limbs seeded depressions soils

Unknowing your voice, but your words I hear
Sight unseen, yet seeing you so clear
Your strength, a mystery but every touch I fell
Iâll just close my eyes, and glimpses Iâll steal

Asphyxiation occurring with cognitions
Pastilleâs crowned reality to halt the yearned
Intimate whispers fall upon raven winds

Pain manifests with unanswered devotions
Resting beneath something greater intangible

Another dawn to pass the recess of loveless
Another dusk to fade in confine of grey scales
Another day to without a face of expression
Atrophied limbs seeded depression soils
