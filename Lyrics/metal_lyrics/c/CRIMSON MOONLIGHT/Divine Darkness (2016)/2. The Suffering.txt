Pain surrounds, Mentality is broken down
The powerlessness internalize
The powerless is now one with the body
The strength is finished again
The blood runs slowly and it feels as
The life disappear out in a sea
Where it is collected
An insignificant drops in an eternity
Then You became the suffering mouth
The cursed calls, the cautious cry
And a relief for all them
Who has fall silent in their anguish

I see but; does not understand
I consult but; does not understand
I feel but; does not understandâ¦ Why?

A faithful witness about all the need
And broken pieces that can nest in a heart
An unerring, numbering man, as Venture Himself
To complain in the souls bitterness
Then You became the suffering mouth
The cursed calls, the cautious cry

Hated, dejected, attacked with defame
All I ask about is a while

A short second that few to exist
Then you became the suffering mouth
The cursed calls, the cautious cryâ¦

The frosts verdure sealed around the skin
Mortify the soul
Less than the wounds before the stage out
The frosts verdure sealed around the skin
Cools the thought
More than foolishness before the stage out

What is that call that rises
Out of whipping iron frosted sea
And draws to those who nothing has?
There waits under grey clouds
Undeceived brothers and sisters
