Through the mist into the inner chambers of self,
Caught up by fear, desolated from malevolent absolution.
Cut off from the tree of life, haunted by the golden swords.
Polluted hands, clear of mind.
Gnostic abomination, spiritual decapitation.
Behold their faces as Janus, ravishing in the form of diabolic positivism.

Walking the path of fragmentation, rebirth of ancient heresies.
The Face of Janus a new paradigm of valentinic dichotomy.
In the shape of angels rejecting the dogma of Chalcedon,
Condemning the consecration of worlds.

One with sin, one with death. - Incarnational recapitulation
One with sin, one with death - Devouring fire defleshed
One with sin, one with death. - Archetype of rebellion
One with sin, one with death. Slaying death from Hades, holding the keys of hell.

Unveiling the faces of Janus.
From the womb of Theotokos ratifying the consecration of worlds
Walking the path of fragmentation, no more.
Incarnational recapitulation
Reawakening of exegetical truths
Dualistic realm forever in ashes

One with sin, one with death. - Incarnational recapitulation
One with sin, one with death. - Unveiling the faces of Janus.
