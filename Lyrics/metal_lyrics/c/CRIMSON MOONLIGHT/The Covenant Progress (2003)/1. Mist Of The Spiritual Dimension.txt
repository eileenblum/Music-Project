Cleanse thine eyes, let truth appear
The world is deceived, judgment is near
Mankind is fallen, believed the lies
Confused and have not seen the evil in his eyes
Ravished they are by the beauty of this form
Enslaved and can not see the chaos of the storm
Root of all evil has grabbed the human race
Saying: "I don't care for others, I am God myself"
Millions in suffering, billions of tears
This world is secured for how many years?

Mist of the Spiritual Dimension
Satan has cursed thy mind
Awake, abandon mortal sin
Truth thou shall find

Dwell in the light of the Saviour
Bathe in the Blood of the Lamb

Sword of Thy mouth shall beat the evil flesh
Evil destroyed by Thy return in brightness
Total annihilation, damnation fell to dust
War of Armageddon, obliteration is a must
King of kings, the earth tremble for Thy might
Thy coming seen by every eye our most awaited sight
No one shall stand at that day, we will be on our knees
Eternal kingdom comes without hatred or decease
The dawning of forever, darkness is no more
By the holy blood of Jesus, we won the final war!
