Long time ago, but still in this age
There was a man, seeking the answers
For the questions of life
An angel, so beautiful arrived
By his side and let his voice be heard:
"I'll give you what you seek for
But you will have to give your soul."
Remember you have nothing to lose
Look forward to what you will be given
The angel seemed so good and honest
The man decided to pay the price
As his soul lay in the angel's hand
The angel gave him the keys
To the treasure halls and said:
"Always remember,
The truth is everywhere in these halls.
Enter without fear..."

The man opened the first gate
And it was closed behind him
Everywhere were things, that were
Showing him the answers
Just like he been told
Spiritual jewels were
Laying on the ground
Waiting to be taken by his hands

This search went on for many years
Until he was satisfied
With the answers he had been given
Suddenly he noticed something so strange
He had been walking inside
These halls for many years
But not found a way out

Finally he met the angel
Walking in one of the halls
The man ran and asked him for help
But the angel showed him the soul
And told the man:
"Remember what you gave me?
I have given you what you asked for
But there are no way out
From these treasure halls
You will end your days here
In my kingdom"

Things were no longer crystal clear
And suddenly the eyes of beauty turned evil
The betrayer had seemed so white and clean
But the black soul he wore within
Had hidden been until now...

The man was betrayed
Now nothing but pain remained
He could feel his body and spirit break down
The angel enjoyed what was seen before his eyes
Because the promise he once gave
Was nothing but lies
Playing with fire had its price to pay
The man had payed with his soul
To this ancient lair
What good had he been given instead?
If he now died he would never
Be able to see daylight again
The picture of life in divine magnificence
Would forever be gone

The man fell down
On his knees and cried
The angel showed no mercy
And told him there was nothing to do
His life could now never be changed
He had received the lie as a truth
And that trust could never be recalled

Suddenly he felt a voice internally saying:
"This is not the end, follow me, I show the way."
A dove came flying inside the treasure halls
Followed by a lamb that once been slaughtered
The angel's face turned pale as he saw them
He left the halls at once, frightened to death
The lamb took the blackened soul
Washed it white and gave it back to the man
