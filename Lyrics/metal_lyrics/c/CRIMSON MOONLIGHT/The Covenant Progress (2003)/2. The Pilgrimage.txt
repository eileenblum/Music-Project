As dawn melted my heart
I opened up my eyes
Red roses from above
Were planted inside of me
And when the never fading love
Was established in my heart
My traveling days began

I walked beside the constantly flowing
Spring of clear water
Always ready to slaked my thirst
And give me peace and strength
I ran towards the fields
Inviting me to let my tiered soul rest
How sweet they were
Those pastures of green

A smell of life filled the air
And the sun gave constant energy
To my once dead spirit
The magnificence of this paradise
Told a wonderful tale about a creation
Taking place since times immemorial
I could hear the tranquil whisper:
"Come closer to me, beloved one"
The Spirit's voiced touched
My ears with love and care

I continued the path
And stepped inside the forest
Still hearing the whisper:
"Come closer to me..."
But suddenly the beautiful trees
And days light turned
Into a landscape of thorn and fog

Soon I was lost in an unknown wilderness
And there was no end to my fright
Tears ran down my mourned face
And the pain showed no mercy
There I was, a helpless and frightened child
At last I fell down on my knees in prayer
While feeling the despair
Coming closer and closer
"Father, help me out of here", I screamed
But no answer was heard
"See my pain..." no one there
I became a lonely prisoner
Bound by chains of doubt
Nowhere could I find the meaning
Of things happening to me
At day I stood screaming, crying and praying
And at night I lay shaking in terrible helplessness

Finally, all my power was gone
And I nearly gave up it all
With my last strength I lifted
My face towards heaven and cried it out:
"Father, Thy will be done, and not mine"
Then I felt in a total less of power
Awaiting the arrival of another frozen night
