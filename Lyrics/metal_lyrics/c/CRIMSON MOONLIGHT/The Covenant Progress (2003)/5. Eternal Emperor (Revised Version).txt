Lord,
eternal emperor of all
In the nocturnal woods of moonlight
your name I call

Through thy word we get wise
and in thy power we shall rise

In this time of sorrow and despair
mercy Lord thy name we trust
Sin and evil will follow everywhere
but in the name of Jesus:
Satan you have lost!

Master Christ Jesus
Ruler of day and night
Within thy force we fight
I thank you Lord Jesus
for your blood and grace
Through that I can meet you God
face to face

Eternal emperor
Eternal emperor
