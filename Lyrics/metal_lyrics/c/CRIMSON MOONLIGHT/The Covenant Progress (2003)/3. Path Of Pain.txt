But suddenly I felt
His arms around me
At last He had come
The Son of Man spoke to me:
"You..." the voice came, "beloved one"
He raised me up
And walked before me
And I followed his footsteps
With a sound of deliverance
A small and hidden gate
Was opened for me

"Follow me", he said
And invited me
Into the landscape
From where I first came
We sat down by a fire
And while his eyes penetrated me
He started to show me
The purpose of all my pain

"You see", He declared
"I myself once did this for you"
"For me", I replied. "Why?"

He continued:
"I once walked this path of pain
But I went much deeper
Than you ever may do
My love for you knew no end
And therefore I did
I had to sacrifice my life that time
And I did it
Because of the never fading love I have for you
But, though your pain was terrible
And I saw no end to your sufferings
I have walked the whole path with you
You have not taken one single step
Without me seeing it
And I have heard every one of your words
I heard when you cried for help
When you asked the Father to see your pain
Behold the path now lying behind you"

I turned and watch
The steps on the road
Each one of them was covered with blood
As steps before also were
His smile told of his great love to me
And as I started to cry tears of relief
He made a statement

Beloved one, I may not tell you why
I let you face situations like these
But I give you a promise...
I will never do these things
To hurt you in any way
But to strengthen you for future walk
And remember
Beloved one you will never be able to walk
Deeper into the unknown parts of the forest
Than I have done
I have walked the whole way
And therefore I know how to give you guidance
When you feel trapped on unknown ways...

He suddenly stood up and pointed
In another direction, and said:
Now walk this way and you will soon be
Out on the main path again

He disappeared from my sight
But my spirit could feel his presence of His
I trusted His words, and soon I walked
Beside the clear spring again
My whole being was strengthened
And I was armoured with the trust in Him
I needed for future tests to come
And I continued to walk the path ahead
