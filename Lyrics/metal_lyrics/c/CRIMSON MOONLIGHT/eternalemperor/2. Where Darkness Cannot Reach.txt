Master, we extol you, your name we're lifting high
In your hands you've got everything
When the final battle's won everyone shall see
That our almighty Lord JESUS CHRIST is king

Darkness tries to make me fall because of my sinful flesh
Lord, come with your power, come in holiness
You who made demons flee when they saw your might
You who left your glory in the palaces of light

Where darkness cannot reach there will my soul be free
Where only light remains is the final place for me
Thy holy angels are serving you, GOD, and so will I

Lord of Lords, you let your blood run for all our sins
Then you rose and triumphed over death
When you conquered darkness and set the captives free
Master, I worship you, I fall down on my knees
