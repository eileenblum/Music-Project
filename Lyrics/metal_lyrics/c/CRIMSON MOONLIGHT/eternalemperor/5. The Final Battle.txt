And I saw an angel coming out of heaven.
Holding the key to the abyss, 
And in his hand the key to the abyss.
He seized the dragon that ancient serpent
And bound him for a thousand years.

He threw him into the abyss
And sealed it and locked it over him.
To keep him from decieving the nations
Any more until the years were ended.

After that he must be set free for a short time.

When the thousand years are over
satan will be released from his prison.
He will go out to decieve the nations
In the corners of the earth, Gog and Magog.
To gather them for battle
In number they are like the sand.

They marched across the breadth of the earth.
And surrounded the camp of God's people.
The city he loves.

But!
Fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
And the devil who decieved them
Was thrown into the lake of burning sulphur
Where the beast and the false prophet has been thrown.
And they will be tormented.
Day and night forever.
Forever and ever!
