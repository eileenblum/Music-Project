Dreading the day that I know will soon come
The only way I can face it is to
Make myself numb
Make myself numb
Approaching the gate that leads me here
Rational thoughts overcome by fear
Overcome by fear
Overcome by fear

Stepping through the threshold a frightened soul
Touching the beast as it swallows me whole
My destiny I can't control

No turning back now all I can do is wait
The skill of one soul now is deciding my fate

Clenching my fist the beast begins to shake
A force of nature how much more can I take
Can I take
Into ominous clouds of black I fly
Falling and turning while young souls cry
Young souls cry

No longer I an in control
I am in control
Closing my eyes not looking below
Not looking below
Hours of emptiness now lie ahead
No turning back
Facing that which I dread

Fear in the Sky
How many times have I tried
To understand
Fate taken from my hands

Why am I here
Why do I fear
It's out of my control
And I feel so alone

I think of those below
As spirits warm my soul
Is it all in my head
This agony I dread

I stand in cold despair
While silent strangers stare
Now hoping for an end
Waiting for my descent

No turning back now all I can do is wait
The skill of one soul deciding my fate

Sinister skies now becoming clear
Ominous thoughts start to disappear
Disappear
Now drawing closer to what makes me whole
I'm once again the one who's in control
In Control
