Struggling in a world so cruel
Trying hard not to fail
Sometimes making it through the day
Is like walking on nails

Traveling down uncertain highways
Making my way through the haze
Leaving all I've known behind me
Never knowing what I might find

Sitting in a scorching room
Sweating out my pain
The price to pay for devotion
Fire flowing through my veins

Traveling down uncertain highways
Making my way through the haze
Leaving all I've known behind me
Never knowing what I might find

Dreams becoming clearer now
Light shining through the rain
Determination leading me
To the voices singing in my brain

Opportunities I've not missed
Doing what I hope is right
To chase what seemed impossible
But is now within my sight

Traveling down uncertain highways
Making my way through the haze
Leaving all I've known behind me
Never knowing what I might find

Every day leaving scars
Realities they seem so harsh
Lessons learned from my mistakes
My soul it will not break
