One decade born into this world
When you become a part of me
Through my ears and into my soul
The thundering rhythm of a life now free

Venting out my frustrations
You're the one, my therapy

Not giving up even when the blood flows
Tearing my skin while the passion grows
Splinters of dedication lay at my feet
Hours of execution I must repeat

Learning from those who inspire me
The masters of their craft
Watching and learning through persistence
My insecurities cut in half

You gave me strength. You gave me focus
You'll always be a part of me

Not giving up even when the blood flows
Tearing my skin while the passion grows
Splinters of dedication lay at my feet
Hours of execution I must repeat

When others abandoned
You were always there
Faithful and unmoving
This life we share

Never judging or crossing
Always waiting for me
You've given me inner peace
I will always believe

Building the courage to sit with you
In front of strangers' watching eyes
Becoming one with you as I grow
My second nature until I die

Surrounding me you stand proudly
Taking over my body

Not giving up even when the blood flows
Tearing my skin while the passion grows
Splinters of dedication lay at my feet
Hours of execution I must repeat

Not giving up even when the blood flows
Tearing my skin while the passion grows
Splinters of dedication lay at my feet
Hours of execution I must repeat
