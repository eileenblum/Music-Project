You are the one who will never leave me
You are the one who will not deceive me
Guiding me through those years of hate and doubt
When betrayed you held me up throughout

Every word that flows from thought to pen
Carries my pride and pain within
Every note that flows from soul to song
A piece of me is placed where it belongs

Every time I feel my life is lost
Rivers of anguish that you helped me cross
Every memory swimming in my mind
Of an unforsaken place and time

My life once so full of wrath
Walking a dead end path
Holding onto words of hope
You came to save my soul

Every day filled with darkness and rain
You were there to ease my endless pain
Every non- believer laughing in my face
Negative thoughts that you've helped me replace

My soul you've renewed
As I've learned to create you

From the abyss in which I was damned
You rescued me with your healing hands
Each moment in time captured by rhyme
Pieces of life woven in my mind

Every mask I wear when I'm alone
Hides a fear that only few have known
Every pleasure that you bless me with
Writes a story I cannot forget

Every moment now till my last breath
I'll look up to you with no regrets
Inspiration you have given me
Together as one we will always be

My life once so full of wrath
Walking a dead end path
Holding onto words of hope
You came to save my soul

My soul you've renewed
As I've learned to create you

From the abyss in which I was damned
You rescued me with your healing hands
Each moment in time captured by rhyme
Pieces of life woven in my mind

From the abyss in which I was damned
You rescued me with your healing hands
Each moment in time captured by rhyme
Pieces of life woven in my mind
