[Japanese Bonus Track]
[Powermad Cover]

I close my eyes and drift away
The passing of another day
I leave the day's despair behind
In my bed I finally climb

I never know when they will come
And hope tomorrow ain't as long
But I'm running on ice, as you can see
Oh, they want me

They take me to another place
I'm out of hope and time and space
They chase my mind like animals
Chew my flesh like cannibals

Why they take me, I can't see
Oh spare me from this misery
Like a child I fear the night
Save me from these dreams tonight
Nice Dreams.

I close my eyes and drift away
The passing of another day
I leave the day's despair behind
And in my bed I finally climb
Surrealistic nighttime fun

But this is not for everyone
Some they like it, some they don't
Some survive it, some they won't

Why they take me, I can't see
Oh spare me from this misery
Like a child I fear the night
Save me from these dreams tonight
Nice Dreams.
