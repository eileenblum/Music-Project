A twisted vision blending into creation
The dark gift weaving an untold rhyme
A fascination with the human complex
Twisting the frames of our delicate minds

Holding our hope and our sanity hostage
A world so alien yet so real
Not straying from their passionate vision
Blending thoughts and fears for others to feel

Look at the darkest eyes
What do you see
Death, Life, Pain and Horror
On our fears they feed

The darkest eyes
Staring back at me
Beyond they rise
Taking my mind willingly

The darkest eyes
They're creating brilliantly
My thoughts baptized
What I've read and what I've seen

Surrounded by the unseen
Infecting our reality
Evil words and deeds
Fulfilling our primal needs

Unspeakable things rising from their pages
Blackening our hearts and disturbing our souls
Descriptions of a future vile and hopeless
Disturbing thoughts now taking hold

Look at the darkest eyes
What do you see
Death, Life, Pain and Horror
On our fears they feed

The darkest eyes
Staring back at me
Beyond they rise
Taking my mind willingly

The darkest eyes
They're creating brilliantly
My thoughts baptized
What I've read and what I've seen
