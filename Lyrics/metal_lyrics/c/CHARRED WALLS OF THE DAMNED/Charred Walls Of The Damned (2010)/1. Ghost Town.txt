A desolate silence, deaths in the air
Surrounded by pain, a terrified stare
From the dark eyes of hell, a sky black and gray

No hope for life
No hope for today
This ghost town stands
Overwhelmed by decay

Suffering on poisoned ground
Suffering in this ghost town

Dark clouds from above, bring darkness and doom
Effortlessly shattering, what lies in its course
A deafening roar, it feels no remorse

No hope for life
No hope for today
This ghost town stands
Overwhelmed by decay

Suffering on poisoned ground
Suffering in this ghost town

Mother Earth has bestowed their fate
Mercilessly punishing those who desecrate

A lifetime of memories swept away in the dust
Dreams of the innocent lay in ruin and rust
An invisible hunter infecting the unknowing
Man planting seeds that the reaper is sowing

Sad eyes lock upon this town
As they dwell on unclean ground
Mountains of sorrow rising forth
Blood red tears pouring from its source
A shadow of its former self
Sitting at the mouth of hell

Empty roads leading to empty souls
The dark underground swallowing whole
Lives once so fertile now all but lost

No hope for life
No hope for today
This ghost town stands
Overwhelmed by decay

Suffering on poisoned ground
Suffering in this ghost town
