Within the safety of Four Walls
The Truth now can be told
No secrets need be kept
No longer I withhold

Voices within the walls
Troubles now seem so small
Together we'll not fall
Voices within the walls

Building Our Trust
Building Our Strength
Believing In Ourselves
While others close their eyes we'll see
The path where silence dwells

Closing the door on negativity
The world starts coming down
Shutting off that which harms us
We're silencing the sounds

Voices within the walls
Troubles now seem so small
Together we'll not fall
Voices within the walls

Voices within the walls
Troubles now seem so small
Together we'll not fall
Voices within the walls

Building Our Trust
Building Our Strength
Believing In Ourselves
While others close their eyes we'll see
The path where silence dwells

Making it right when all seems wrong
Uniting now will make us strong
Make us strong
Make us strong
