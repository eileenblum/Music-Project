Eyes closed memories rushing in
Longing for freedom and the way things were then
No concern for what tomorrow would bring
Working to create our machine

Life is short and time is ever moving
Living for the moment

Fate in our hands
Time's shifting sands
Places we have been
We'll do it all again
Fate in our hands

Times come to leave this place
Venturing into night's cold embrace
Unaware of what lies ahead
Refusing to dwell on that which we dread

Life is short and time is ever moving
Living for the moment

Fate in our hands
Time's shifting sands
Places we have been
We'll do it all again
Fate in our hands
