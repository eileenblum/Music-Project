Taking hold not so long ago
This heartless beast possessing me

Unaware of what is inside me
Please set me free from this pain i see

Feeding and flowing through rivers of red
Clouding my vision and the thoughts in my head

Seeds of this misery, planted inside of me

Under the surface they now patiently wait
Clouding my judgement as my mind they sedate

Seeds of this misery, planted inside of me

My Demons arer guiding me
From below they are spawning
They're tearing and clawing
Waiting to be set free
From below they are spawning
They're tearing and clawing at me

Keeping me awake at night
Piercing brain and robbing my sight

Please set me free, from this pain i see

Destroying my body and leaving me torn, not willing to
Die, every day i'm reborn

Seeds of this misery, Planted inside of me

My Demons are guiding me
From below they are spawning
They're tearing and clawing
Waiting to be set free
From belowe they are spawning
They're tearing and clawing at me
My Demons are guiding me waiting to be set free
