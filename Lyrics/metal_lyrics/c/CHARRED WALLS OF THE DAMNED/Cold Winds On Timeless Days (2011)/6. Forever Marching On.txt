Marching on forward, together we are one
In the desolate streets our notes they blend
Beating down on us the autumn sun

Far from streets familiar
Counting on the one to guide the way
A massive weight now rests upon my shoulders
No matter the pain, I cannot break

The Rhythm of our pounding feet
The music filling empty streets
In unity and pride we'll take
These memories into our graves

Yet still i feel the strength to keep marching on
Far from streets familiar
Counting on the one to guide the way
A massive weight now rests upon my shoulders

The Rhythm of our pounding feet
The music filling empty streets
In unity and pride we'll take
These memories into our graves

One day i'll look back and realize
The importance of this, our time
Together we created our moment in the sun
When we all became one

Far from streets familiar
Counting on the one to guide the way
A massive weight now rests upon my shoulders

The Rhythm of our pounding feet
The music filling empty streets
In unity and pride we'll take
These memories into our graves

Forever, Marching On Under Clear Skies
Forever, Marching On And On Through Life
Forever, Marching We Are Now As One
Forever, Marching Under Eternity's Fading Sun
Forever, Marching On And On And On
