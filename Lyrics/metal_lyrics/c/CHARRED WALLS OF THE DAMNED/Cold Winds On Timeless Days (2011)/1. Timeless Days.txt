My hands are grasping my confidence tearing,
As those around me soon stop caring
My dreams are ending so sudden each day,
With nothing finding me, making me stay

Buying time
My life unwinds
My grasp on reality
It bleeds from cuts with thorns of tragedy

Soon To Be
Floating helplessly in the sea
Not knowing where fate takes me
Just an empty human being

Sinking down into darkness,falling 
Into the deep abyss i'm crawling
Pull me up to the light of day, won't you
Into the safety of your arms, holding

My sensory, overloaded with memories,
Rational though is now serving me

Buying time
My life unwinds

Soon To Be
Floating helplessly in the sea
Not knowing where fate takes me
Just an empty human being

Sinking down into darkness,falling
Into the deep abyss i'm crawling
Pull me up trough the unknown

Sinking in sands of inharmony
Eyes filled with future's wrath
Stepping out from my distant past
Into the now when life burns fast

Soon To Be
Floating helplessly in the sea
Not knowing where fate takes me
Just a empty human being
