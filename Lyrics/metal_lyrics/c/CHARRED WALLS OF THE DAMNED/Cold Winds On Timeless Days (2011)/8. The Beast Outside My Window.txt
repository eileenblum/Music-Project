I am greeted by you in the morning light
Staring through my window for a lifetime
Rising up from the river's depths
It's your presence I've learned to accept

Never thought that you would be
Something that each day I'd see
My dreams become reality
Every time you carry me

Over the storm
Over the pain
Into the rain
At the end of the day

Over the waves
Over the depths
Into my home
Trust that I've kept

Running trough your shadows into
Seeds of life that never grew
Walking past the winter's grasp
Onto trails that renew our past

Haunted By The Beast Outside My Window
Towering, Watching Over All That I Know
Haunted By The Beast Outside My Window
Rising, Reaching From The Dark Cold Depths Below

You've been hammered and tread upon countless times
Standing tall and unhurt, made of scars you rise

Nothing that could ever break
The bond between us, eternally linked

Over the waves
Over the depths
Into my home
Trust that i've kept

Running trough your shadows into
Seeds of life that never grew
Walking past the winter's grasp
Onto trails that renew our past

Haunted By The Beast Outside My Window
Towering, Watching Over All That I Know
Haunted By The Beast Outside My Window
Rising, Reaching From The Dark Cold Depths Below
