Worshipping those without a soul
Living life with no control
Wasting time as the earth moves past,
Noting this empty will last
Entering a world shallow, sinking ever again so low

So Admire The Heroes, the endangered ones
Follow the inspired, under the rising sun
Take care of the wounded, battles they have won
Brave ones saving lives honor, deeds they've done

Admire the Heroes, Shut out the dark souls
Admire the Heroes, Shut out the dark souls
Admire The Heroes, Shut out the dark souls
So know you know, Admire the Heroes

Empty minds feeding those who hate,
Fighting over a worthless face
Soon forgotten, A fleeting glance,
Eating the conscience of those who chance

So Admire The Heroes, the endangered ones
Follow the inspired, under the rising sun
Take care of the wounded, battles they have won
Brave ones saving lives honor, deeds they've done

Admire the Heroes, Shut out the dark souls
Admire the Heroes, Shut out the dark souls
Admire The Heroes, Shut out the dark souls
So know you know, Admire the Heroes
