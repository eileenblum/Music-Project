Trapped in this technical world so fake
How can i release me
I've caused my reality to break
Unplug that which binds me

Chained in this web i can't think anymore
No time for ideas it's real life i ignore
Concerned with the soulless, a social cocoon
No oxygen for my mind to bloom

Trapped in this technical world so fake
How can i release me
I've caused my reality to break
Unplug that which binds me

Reaching into my own self
Pulling out pieces of me
Scraping bits of my damaged mind
Healing thoughts, who i should be

I've crashed my brain with technology
Losing my thoughts
I've entered virtual reality
Human i'm not
I've cut off tries to humanity
Myself i fought

No desire for interaction, i am lost
Inside this web, I am caught
Aware of this distractions, I am not
Closing my eyes, to original thought
I can't control my ideas, it owns me now
Absorbed into the world of inside out

I look down and all i see
Is a new world in front of me
I come crashing back to earth
Realizing my rebirth

Reaching into my own self
Pulling out pieces of me
Scraping bits of my damaged mind
Healing thoughts, who i should me

I've crashed my brain with technology
Losing my thoughts
I've entered virtual reality
Human i'm not
I've cut of tries to humanity
Myself i fought
