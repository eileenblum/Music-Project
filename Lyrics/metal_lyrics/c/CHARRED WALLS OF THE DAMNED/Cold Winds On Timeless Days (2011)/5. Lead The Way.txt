Ritual beliefs, uniting those who dare
Some destined to kill, others unaware

Skeletons stand, in the shadow of man
A bond formed with their bleeding hands

Under cold gray skies, we are left behind
Joined life, memories they now will rise

Coming together with a solemn face
Free of expression, thoughts, and hate

When others fail us, unclean fears of new
Draining souls of all tales untrue
A shroud of pain yet flesh remains
There is no hope, no shelter in the rain

Lead The Way From This Dark Reprise
Set Me Free
Lead The Way so that i can find
Make Me Believe

Lead The Way To The Tranquil Seas
Up trough the deep
Lead The Way Into Soul Reprieve
Hope Is All We Need

Sinking teeth trough skin, in the sky so grim
Falling to the death, yet living again
Waking self torment, in the light that you've sent

Divinity trough suffering eternally
Only light from above will end this grief
Creating shadows in an empty space
Blessing our souls with an unknowning grace

Feeding from blood cursed through sins of mankind
Devouring innocents who waste their lives
Burning ships sail through the safety of night
Immortal cursed now hiding from the daylight

When others fail us, unclean fears of new
Draining souls of all tales untrue
A shroud of pain yet flesh remains
There is no hope, no shelter in the rain

Lead The Way From This Dark Reprise
Set Me Free
Lead The Way so that i can find
Make Me Believe

Lead The Way To The Tranquil Seas
Up trough the deep
Lead The Way Into Soul Reprieve
Hope Is All We Need

Sinking teeth trough skin, in the sky so grim
Falling to the death, yet living again
Waking self torment, in the light that you've sent
