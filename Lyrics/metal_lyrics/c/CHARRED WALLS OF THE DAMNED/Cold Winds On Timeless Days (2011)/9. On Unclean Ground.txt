I see the world of pain
Some say they are insane
Only the rage remains
Can this all be explained

They're crawling out of the woods
They are all misunderstood
You know that they've lost their way

But who are we to say
This is their sacred place
It's here they have to stay
On unclean ground they pray

Through the window a silver of light
Nightmare reflected in their eyes
All around lives covering the ground
When will their way be found?

They're crawling out of the woods
They are all misunderstood
You know that they've lost their way

The pain's too much to take
Thrown aside by twist of fate

Healing hands come much too late
Mental storms that isolate
Fires burning their time to dust
Soulless cages now surrounded by rust

They're crawling out of the woods
They are all misunderstood
You know that they've lost their way
