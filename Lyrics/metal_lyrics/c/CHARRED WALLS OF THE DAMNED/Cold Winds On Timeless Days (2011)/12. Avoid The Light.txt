I'm shielding myself from the unseen above
Attacking my skin I cannot run
I am useless it seems to have won
This agonizing fight with the sun
Every day spent forevermore
Dreading every scar and every sore
Can't face the day in this helpless state
Eating away at me as I mutate

Covering myself
Disfiguring myself
Hiding somewhere else
Fighting against myself

I'll Avoid the Light, as it chases me
I'll Avoid the Light, as it wastes me
I'll Avoid the Light, burning deep in me
I'll Avoid the Light, cutting meat from me

Icy razors shooting into my skin
Cuts so deep exposing the blood within

Healing now the signs show in my face
Hiding in shadows, darkness encased

Eating through my flesh
Fighting to stop its spread

I'll Avoid the Light, as it chases me
I'll Avoid the Light, as it wastes me
I'll Avoid the Light, burning deep in me
I'll Avoid the Light, cutting meat from me

From now on i will stay in the dark
Keep the sun from making its black mark
Always watching for its faceless wrath
Keeping distance from its deadly grasp

I'll Avoid the Light, as it chases me
I'll Avoid the Light, as it wastes me
I'll Avoid the Light, burning deep in me
I'll Avoid the Light, cutting meat from me
