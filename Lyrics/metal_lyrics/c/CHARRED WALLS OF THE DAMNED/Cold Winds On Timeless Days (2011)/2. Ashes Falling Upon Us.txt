Traces of Death coming from the skies
They're destroying so Why Can't I?

I see the ashes of life float away
In my home i can no longer stay

Quickening their own mortality through foolish addictive needs

I Want no part of this sickened wish,
From all around floats death's gray mist

Ashes Falling Upon Us, my body scarring me from inside
Ashes Falling Upon Us, i will not let this die

How many times have i tried to end
This attack on my within
Every moment trying to avoid
The air around me that ut destroys

Running through a gauntlet of haze and mist
Inside of me it now lives
Twisting my lungs, threatening my life
Slicing through me with invicible knives

Ashes Falling Upon Us, my body scarring me from inside
Ashes Falling Upon Us, i will not let this die

Set me free from this grey misery
I'm a slave to this death surrounding me
