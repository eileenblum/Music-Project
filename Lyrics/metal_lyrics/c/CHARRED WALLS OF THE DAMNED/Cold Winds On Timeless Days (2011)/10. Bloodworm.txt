As I watch you lying twisted, blue green and red
Agony and thoughts of years past run trough my head
I curse the ones who put you in pain
Are Hope and time the only cure that remains

Watching you hurt pierces my heart with a knife
How can something so pure be taken away from my life
I always knew that this day would come
But now it's here, it's left my body numb

So scared to walk trough that door
Afraid you won't be there any more
I'd give my own life to save yours
Your suffering has my heart torn

Please don't give up I'm right here with you
I'm trying so hard to help you live
Only another day and you'll be fine
I'm giving all that I can give

Reality it starts to set in
I think of all the times I don't win
But this fight won't stop, no I won't lose my control
Until I no longer breathe, you'll own a piece of my soul
Watching you hurt pierces my heart with a knife
How can something so pure be taken away from my life
I always knew that this day would come
But now it's here, It's left my body numb

So scared to walk trough that door
Afraid you won't be there any more
I'd give my own life to save yours
Your suffering has my heart torn
