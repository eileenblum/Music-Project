I will carve this message in my chest
To leave those who choose to not forget

I feel, and i see, and i need, this frozen hand i front of me

I will not harm those who disturb my rest,
Those whom the all knowing ones detest

I feel, and i see, and i need, this frozen hand i front of me

Can't you See, the cold and rage inside of me
Can't you Believe, that i'm the obe that you've set free

I'm Freezing, Release Me
I'm Freezing

Cold Winds Searching
Cold Winds Learning

How to wear me down
When to hit the ground

Cold Winds Searching
Cold Winds Learning

How to wear me down
When to hit the ground

Winter stirs inside of me, chilling now the air i breathe
When am i finally set free

A new season please let it be
A new season for me
Cold Winds Searching
Cold Winds Learning

How to wear me down
When to hit the ground
Cold Winds Searching
Cold Winds Learning

How to wear me down
When to hit the ground
Cold Winds Now
