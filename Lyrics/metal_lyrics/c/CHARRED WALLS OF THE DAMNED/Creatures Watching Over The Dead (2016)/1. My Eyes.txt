I close my eyes soon asleep I will find myself
At the door where dreams are waiting for me
To realize a wish, a compromise my mind has in store
A friend I had before I was here

A whisper close behind
Familiar voice reminds
With every moving thought
A chance that we have sought

You're in my dreams at night
Turn into the light
From my past you see me
In a singular reality

Focusing my eyes into you, into you
Only now, only here
Only thoughts remain true

Face the past the ghost in the glass
Standing at my door patiently waiting for
That second chance, one more passing glance
In time the mind is near and the thoughts disappear

With every moving thought
A chance that we have sought

You're in my dreams at night
Turn into the light
From my past you see me
In a singular reality

Focusing my eyes into you, into you
Only now, only here
Only thoughts remain true
