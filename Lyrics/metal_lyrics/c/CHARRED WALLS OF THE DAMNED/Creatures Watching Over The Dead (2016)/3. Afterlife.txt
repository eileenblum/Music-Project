In one hundred years, I'll be gone
What now remains is this song
Will anyone know of my name
The life, the years and all the pain

If nothing else awaits us there
All that we have is forever here
In words or rhyme images of time
What the future holds for all mankind

This is my afterlife
I hope understand
My soul, this song is in your hands
Long after we are dust, surviving though decay

What happens now it matters not
The pain endured, victories sought
The story told, the life remains
Deciding our eternal fate

This is my afterlife
I hope understand
My soul, this song is in your hands
Long after we are dust, surviving though decay
