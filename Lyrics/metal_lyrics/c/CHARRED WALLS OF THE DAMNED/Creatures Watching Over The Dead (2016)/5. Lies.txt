So close one day yet unknown the next
A bond so strong never believed they could test
Brought together by a sound of beasts inside our minds
I thought would remain for all time

Ungrateful they're become right before my eyes
The fire put out by a chemical disguise
Keeping me away and shaping my past
Never will I fall for the dead in the grass

Fading far away
Sounds disappear in the gray

Lies on their tongues I can see
Stealing their will to be free
Twisting their minds desperately
Fighting their control over me

Following the massese into seas of blue and red
Leaving pain where you tread
Filling my ears with the sounds that I dread
Not forgetting the ones who alwats led

Fading far away
Sounds disappear in the gray

Lies on their tongues I can see
Stealing their will to be free
Twisting their minds desperately
Fighting their control over me
