A rip in my flesh when the teeth sink in
It's far too late, I don't see you, my friend
Not a matter of if, just a matter of when
You're pulling me down just to feed me again
As the pain of my hunger calls from within
An insane bloodlust, a feast born of mortal sin

Oh, won't you tear me down now?
Oh, can't you break the sound now?

Know it's over and the time is short
No control, this is my last resort
Cutting into myself just to satisfy
Crawling into the dirt, feeding myself to the fire
