I see you trapping into this electric world
As your brain melts into glass
Thoughts focusing upon a dark screen of deceit
A life that's paid in full and wallowing in grief

Stepping through the mindless threshold
Now amongst the soulless

When there's no will to control your life anymore
You're just a puppet on a string
For you the willing one, now you have come undone
Wrapped up inside this world and staring at the sun

Stepping through the mindless threshold
Now amongst the soulless

Where are your thoughts your inspiration
Living like a machine no determination
Pre-programmed this life, this is no longer yours
Your mind begs for mercy as your soul ignores

Stepping through the mindless threshold
Now amongst the soulless
