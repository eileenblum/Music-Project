I lie with my eyes closed tight
My dreams are nightmares tonight
Beaching into my reality
Squeezing my chest so I can't breathe

Not knowing you can't be real
Feeling what I always feel
Pain comes into me dramatically
Until I wake that's when I see

Rising from the pain
Disappearing from my self again
Wake me when I take
My last breath away

Pain, waking me from my dreams
Pain, nothing is as it seems
Pain, causing me fear at night
An inner war I cannot fight

Hand wrapping around my throat
You're quickly taking control
I'm so helpless you've taken me
Into a world where I can't breathe

Rising from the pain
Disappearing from my self again
Wake me when I take
My last breath away

Pain, waking me from my dreams
Pain, nothing is as it seems
Pain, causing me fear at night
An inner war I cannot fight

As I catch my breath, I awaken to a day unknown
As I catch my breath, I step out from the shadows
As I catch my breath, I am leaving my dreams filled with ghosts
As I catch my breath, my body becomes their host

Rising from the pain
Disappearing from my self again
Wake me when I take
My last breath away

Pain, waking me from my dreams
Pain, nothing is as it seems
Pain, causing me fear at night
An inner war I cannot fight
