Darkness we have left behind
This journey shared so many times
Beneath the waters black and grey
The cold welcomes us here to stay

The smell of emptiness surrounds
The putrid stench of underground
The dead still seek the ones they meet
And keep them in this world so deep

Reach into the light
Open your mind to sight
Reach into the light

Creatures roaming tracks we take
Sacrifice the deal we make
Without you I wll not move
Throughout this abysmal womb

The energy surrounding me
Pieces of my history
Inside of the air we breathe
The sweet release can you believe

Reach into the light
Open your mind to sight
Reach into the light
The darkness that we left behind
