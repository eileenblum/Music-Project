Turning back follow a different path
Treading water flowing black
You call to me from a distant shore
But now I'm sinking, I'm no more

Living in the shadow of yesterday, sinking in the deep
Living in the shadow of yesterday, is how you saved me

I chose this life that I now feel
Did it end is all this real
A decision made that day
I couldn't make it all the way

Living in the shadow of yesterday, sinking in the deep
Living in the shadow of yesterday, is how you saved me

Is this me?
The life I lead?
Is this our reality?

Living in the shadow of yesterday, sinking in the deep
Living in the shadow of yesterday, is how you saved me

Save me
