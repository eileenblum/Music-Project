Scanning the wasteland for signs of life
 Feeling you're constantly left behind
You wonder if you should just leave or stay
Why should you care about them anyway?

Time has passed beyond you now

An empty soul
With no vision or goal
Feeding on time
Feeds on your mind

Burning your eyes
The tears that you cry
One day you'll know
The damage you've done to your soul
