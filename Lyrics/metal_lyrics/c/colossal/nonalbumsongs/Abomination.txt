Look down on me for who i am, i guess ive already been judged, i am not just a fucking man,
but more a fucking monster. look at me disgust fills your eyes, till i look back at you
my eyes are filled with endless hate youre right to look away(keeps you out of harms way
am i just another outcast thrown out with no fucking respect) [x2]
banished by my fucking kind to live forever marked with shame
i am just another fucking abomination
i am just a fucking abomination
