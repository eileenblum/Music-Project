How many times do I have to prove myself to you these fucking tests  
are never ending for some reason you think that I am the one to blame  
open your fucking eyes before this is done you will realize that time  
and time again I prove myself Ive passed every test you've thrown at  
me I bealive that I have earned my place who are you to dispute me  
what can I do to get you off my back I'll do whatever it takes how can  
you not trust me by now I've done everything you've asked Tell me why  
we keep running in these circles tell me why we had to go this far  
tell me why these are fucking endless trials tell me why you set me up  
for failure time and time again I prove myself Ive passed every test you've thrown at  
me I bealive that I have earned my place who are you to dispute me  
what can I do to get you off my back I'll do whatever it takes how can  
you not trust me by now I've done everything you've asked
How many times do I have to prove myself to you these fucking tests are
never ending for some reason you think that I am the one to blame  
open your fucking eyes before this is done you will realize that
