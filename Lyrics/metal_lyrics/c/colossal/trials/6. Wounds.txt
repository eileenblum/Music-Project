you left me all alone with nothing to call my own but i should have guessed
because your the best at that turned your back and never looked back
how could you fucking live with that i guess ill never know why you left
stomp it out ill never know the reason you left but you dont deservre a second chance
my pain will never heal the wounds are to deep but i have learned to harness the pain and turn it into, into rage
you are the center of my hate i will never, never forgive you for what you did to me the day that you fucking left
you dont deserve respect you fucking piece of shit [x2]
