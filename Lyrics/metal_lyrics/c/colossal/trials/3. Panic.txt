What did I do to deserve all of this I've done nothing wrong you cause  
all the trouble and all the bullshit I am tired of you and tired of  
hearing it just this once can you keep your mouth shut [x2] get ahold of  
yourself it's all in your fucking head you are the one that is turning  
the world against you this is out of everyones hands I can't help you
So stop depending on me (the decisions that you make don't just affect  
you consequnces  that are yours to take are passed to me) [x2] can I ask  
you did you get what you wanted you pushed me away now iam gone and  
won't be back. now i am gone and wont be back Your nothing  
your less than shit I don't need you I'll get over it [x2]
