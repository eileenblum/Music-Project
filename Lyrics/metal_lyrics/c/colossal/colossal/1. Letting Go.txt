Letting go is harder than you might fuckin' think
These images and memories still fuckin haunt me 
Like a virus they keep coming back to me
But this shit has to end eventually 
What's wrong with me why can't I just
Move on and set my mind free
And move on to better things it's in the past
Don't let it tear you down 
I have to move on to forget what has happened
In my life and 
No more imagining what used to be it can ruin your life easily [x2]
Wash them away, cleanse them from my mind,
These images will no longer haunt me
No longer will they torment me
