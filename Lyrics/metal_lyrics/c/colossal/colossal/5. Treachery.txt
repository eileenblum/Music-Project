How could I call you my fucking friend, after what you did to me
Standing there with a knife (gonna stab me in the fucking back) [x2]
I am tired of all the lies you deny you've cried wolf so many times
(I would have given my life to protect what we had 
swore an oath to you it meant nothing) [x2]
(The promises you've made have been tossed away
I don't need this shit from anyone) [x2]
(You've profected the act of betraying your friends) [x2]
