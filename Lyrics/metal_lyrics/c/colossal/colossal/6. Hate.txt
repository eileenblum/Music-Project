I didn't realize that this kind of hate was even possible 
You don't know who I am or what's coming to you
If you want to settle this like a man than name the time and place
I will never back down to you you dont scare me
You're fucking dead, beaten down, your blood stains the ground
I see right through your fucking lies and so does everyone else 
Maybe now you realize that no one wants you around
I see right through your lies and so does everyone else
Maybe now you realize that no one wants you around
(You can't ever fix this so dont even try) [x3]
I can fucking see it, deep in your eyes you are afraid, I know the truth
About you who you are a fucking coward and a failure
I never wanted shit to be like this all fucked up 
You brought this onto yourself
