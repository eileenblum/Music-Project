Come to your senses, or face the consequences
Here lies a lesson to be fucking learned 
Never talk shit if you can't back it up
Now we're standing face to face it's your fucking move 
But I'll make you an offer you cannot refuse
An offer you cannot refuse
Step the fuck down kid or make your fucking move
I am not gonna waste my time on you 
Just wake up and get a fucking clue 
It's over I am done end of you
I cannot believe that you thought you could stand up
In the first place
If it's true your not afraid then say it to my fucking face [x2]
The choice is yours take a stand and fucking fall [x2]
