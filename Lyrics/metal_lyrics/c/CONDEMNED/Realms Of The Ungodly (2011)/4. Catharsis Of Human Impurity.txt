Torn between realities
Denounced from the heavens 
cast down unto the minions
Amongst entities of pendulous condition
Virulently inspecting
assimilating the body through abstract refinements
unwillingly subjected, vivisected
afflicted beyond the boundaries of suffering
grotesque manipulation of physical form
stochastically modifying
carnally absolved of humanity, a spiritual cleansing
this vessels design is restructured
continually deformed
contorted to anomalous states
bodily manifestation of sin
rid of the imperfections of earthly flesh
torment hath not a flaw
Catharsis of human impurity
afflicted beyond the boundaries of suffering
manipulation of physical form stochastically modifying
carnally absolved of humanity, a spiritual cleansing
Such is the will of the ungodly
amongst the monastery exists no salvation
no faith preserved nor absolute atonement
forevermore shall these souls reside
for here remain those exiled from gods divine grace
