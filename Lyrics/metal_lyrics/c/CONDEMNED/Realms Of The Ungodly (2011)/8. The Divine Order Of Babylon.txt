A new era dawns in the hour of ruin
the collapse of empires
The eclipse of civilization
A bitter wind sweeps the spectral remains of 
a barren world
from the ashen debris emerges a shapeless entity
the anointed one
cloaked in garments unearthly, a nebulous aura
the symbolic figure
amorphous in semblance, demigod in flesh
an arrogant being of magnificent countenance
temples of false council erected in praise
seeding the contrivance of this upheaval
the esoteric conception of 
the divine order of Babylon
serving the monarchy through magistrates
pawns of the priestcraft
appointed as conduits to the almighty
implementing admonitory rituals
viciously inculcating the apocryphal parable
suffusing the paradigm
manipulating belief through fear
the shepherd and flock are one
