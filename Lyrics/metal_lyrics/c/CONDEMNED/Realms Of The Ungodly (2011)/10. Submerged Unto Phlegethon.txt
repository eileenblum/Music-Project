Walk forth into the rivers of red 
through blood that boils the soul 
he who hath sinned shall lay in the bed
of this scorching sanguineous stream
set into a blaze of burning misery
submerged in the searing blood they cause to flow
for they themselves were once enforcers of human cruelty
the sacrifice of mortal life remains unforgiven enkindled fingers, frail and blackened
reach forth beseechingly 
black plumes rise, smoke envelopes for the merciless wraith to endure
screams erupt like choirs in an off key hymn
a deafening cacophony of sonorous din
Perceived in the distance, carried in the wind
frenzied, embittered hands smother these
desperately grasping the threshold to the shores 
Hysteria takes hold
nameless crowds become enmeshed
wallowing in the crimson swamp
the waters pulsate violently
churning and frothing fiery liquid
savage beasts await pesertion
circling along the banks 
ferociously piercing all who should seek
release from their perennial agony 
once more, plunged beneath the boiling surface
into the chaos below
burn, fallen images of tyranny, scourges of god
kings of bloodshed and despoilment
