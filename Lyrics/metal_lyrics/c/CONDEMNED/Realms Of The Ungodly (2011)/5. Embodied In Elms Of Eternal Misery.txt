Unto the depths of the seventh circle
lie pathless woods of dismal beings
of blackened leaves and misshapen trees
diseased in poisonous thorns
infested with creatures that feed on the innards
morbidly bleeding, profusely excreting
lamenting in pain and suffering intensely
behold the trees bear the faces of tortured souls
imprisoned for eternity
embodied in elms of eternal misery
denied bodily form and sentenced to captivity
embodied in elms of eternal misery
atrocious self sacrifice occludes the pristine light of paradise
deprived of bodies
souls ripped from them and thrown below to the underworld
to claim their forsaken embodiment of wood and gore
branching arms reach forth, broken and torn
spewing blood from various open sores
ravaged by beasts
feeding on their anatomy
punishing self ridden greed
embodied in elms of eternal misery
denied bodily form and sentenced to captivity
embodied in elms of eternal misery
