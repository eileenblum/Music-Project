My will cast into the swine innumerable denizens
That exist solely to proliferate entropy
A sempiternal pursuit for triumphal darkness
To ensure it's ascension
To subrogate eternal darkness for light
To subjugate opposition and dissent

My will become the will of the many
Of hive mind singular
In purpose a beckoning
Ethereal in the distance
Omnipresent strengthening
Exponentially fulfilling
Nihilistic yearning for mutual destruction
Apocalyptic twilight
The end of days
My debt paid in blood

Awaiting my command
Those who live and die for me
To ensure the fulfillment of this legacy of ruination
Antithesis of a utopian dream
The absolute eradication of all life

Prebiotic in conception
Self-organizing
Brought into existence
With singular malignant purpose

The will of the weak nourishes, grants me life
Viral the spread of my dominion
Manipulating vector
Body to body
Mind to mind
My will become the will of the many

Mercilessly striking forth with absolute impunity
Weakling hordes cowering in fear
Crushed under my absolute despotic reign
A chain reaction
Usurping frailest minds
Expanding outward exponentially

Supplanting this idyllic world
In deference to what i shall create
They forfeit all they are
In the presence of a god
Their new god
