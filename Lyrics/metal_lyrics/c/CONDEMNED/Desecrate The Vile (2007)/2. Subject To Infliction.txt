Death to corrupt beings
No pity for the inexorable
Behavior dictates you fate
An act teaming with hypocrisy
Yet it must be done
You will be subject to infliction
Absolute fucking torture
Desecration at its most relevant
Existence eradicated
No epitaph to be found
Only remains of the dead
Ridding society of these malignant bastards
Wretched miscreants, you shall perish
