[Angel]
Kneeling at the shrine of the blessed
Praising the alter, sacrificial invocation

[Townsley]
Divine blood beckons forth an ineffable being
Omnipotent and infinite
A vile apparition
Manipulating the congregation
Bestowing disease upon the holy mortally

[Whitaker]
Infected instruments of debauchery
Worshiping this horrid miscreation
Impelled by the will of the malevolent one
Unholy malign it within the sect
Once preachers of divinity,
Now practitioners of perversity
Iniquitous slaughter of purity

[All]
Chapter of defilement

[Fuselier]
Deforming bodies, consuming souls
Indiscriminate violation.
Mutilating corpses of the consecrated
Feeding on souls of the devout
In hordes they suffocate the godly
Obscuring holiness in a shroud of abomination
The faithful have become forced offerings

[Townsley]
Immortally resurrected as accursed minions

[Whitaker]
Spirits of the forsaken shall endure

[Angel]
Unending torment
Unfathomable suffering
