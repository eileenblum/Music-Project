Your wild at heart

I'll give you roses and red wine we'll drink
Candles burn in the dead of night.
And every breath or every step you'll ever take
Be ruled by devil. That's something will remain

And you... Want know what is my love
To you... My love is lust
And... You want it more
Until those roses are turned into dust

So, don't be afraid, don't hide your beauty, show it to me
To come and give me a passionate kiss,
Let the lust control you like it's controlling me

Kneel... in front of me... and the gates of heaven you will see
Let loose the devil in you
Bend over for me... and the flames of hell you will feel
Let loose the devil in you

Every whisper, every word you ever say
Ah... flame of lust lights my way

And youâ¦ want to know what is my lust
To you... My lust is pain
And... You want it more
'Cause poisoned blood pulsing into your veins

So, don't be ashamed, don't hide your feelings share those with me
To come and enjoy this moment with me,
Let the lust control you like it's controlling me

Kneel... in front of me... and the gates of heaven you will see
Let loose the devil in you
Bend over for me... and the flames of hell you will feel
Let loose the devil in you

Kneel... in front of me... and the gates of heaven you will see
Let loose the devil in you
Bend over for me... and the flames of hell you will feel
Feel me... In you...
