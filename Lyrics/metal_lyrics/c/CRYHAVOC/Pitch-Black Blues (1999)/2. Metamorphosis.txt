When dusk lays hands on the town of misery
The light attracts all you children of light
Every night pilgrimage is part of your mystery
Towards the light... towards the last flight...

Fly... towards the light like all the moths in the night
Fly like it would be your last flight
I rise... on my jet-black wings and fly through the smoke
I see you as my queen when the chrysalis has broken

Again the shadows grow and lights begin to glow
It's time for new moon, that's why the army grows
Now this, (then that) the light is everywhere
Which one you choose... I donât care

Fly... towards the light like all the moths in the night
Fly like it would be your last flight
I rise... on my jet-black wings and fly through the smoke
I see you as my queen
When the chrysalis has broken

Time for the last flight and the metamorphosis is near
Before the dawn magic wouldnât disappear

After the metamorphosis you'll be all mine
You in my arms... I drink your love like wine...

Fly... towards the light like all the moths in the night
Fly like it would be your last flight
I rise... on my jet-black wings and fly through the smoke
I see you as my queen
When the chrysalis has broken
