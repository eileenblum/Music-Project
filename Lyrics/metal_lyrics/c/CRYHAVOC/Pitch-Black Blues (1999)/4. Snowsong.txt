Through thick snow, through the freezing blow.
Through darkness I roam
Alone in night, no one on sight.
But still I know

âCause I know where I can find your love, your thoughts
Your embrace so warm
And I know I can get that all

Because your embrace is like a rope
Around my neck gives me no hope
I rather roam, than die inside

[Chorus:]
Hey, thereâre so many paths to go,
Mine is veiled with the snow
Hey, I find mine I won't take yours!
My path is maybe hard to roam,
Yours is easier to follow.

Through bitter blow, under northern stars' glow
Your traces on the snow
So easy to see, I won't follow

âCause I know where I can find my answers, to my thoughts
To my reality
And I know there's my tranquility

'Cause your embrace is like dope
Running in my veins gives me no hope
I rather roam, than die inside

[Chorus:]
Hey, thereâre so many paths to go
Mine is veiled with the snow
Hey, I find mine I won't take yours!
My path is maybe hard to roam,
Yours is easier to follow.
Yeah, I'll find mine I won't take yours

I...
I rather roam, than die inside

[Chorus:]
Hey, there're so many paths to go,
Mine is veiled with the snow
Hey, I find mine I won't take yours!
My path is maybe hard to roam,
Yours is easier to follow.
Yeah, I'll find mine I won't take your God
I won't take your God
