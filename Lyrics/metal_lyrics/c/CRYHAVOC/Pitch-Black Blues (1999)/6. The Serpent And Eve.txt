Gloomy shade of green
Again I'm having this same dream
I'm in a garden
And you are here with me

Your pale figure
Unclothed you are wandering
In shades I lie in wait
Celestial beauty I see

You walk across the garden
Across the meadow to the grove
To the dream grove I follow

You dance under the trees
Under the dim light of stars
In shades I lie in wait
Admire the beauty I see

Follow me and I will give you
A dream made of you and me

Follow me and I will show you my dream
Where I am the serpent and you are Eve
Follow me and I will show you my deepest
Desires in garden of dream

I sneak behind you and kiss your neck
You turn around, more you get

We watch the stars
Naked on a meadow we lay
We drink from fountain
And listen it's melody

Follow me and I will give you
A dream made of you and me

Follow me and I will show you my dream
Where I am the serpent and you are Eve
Follow me and I will show you my deepest
Desires in garden of dream

Every night I close my eyes to youâ¦
Every time I close my eyes you appear to my dream
The serpent and Eve
I'm in our realm

Serpent and the Eveâ¦
Every night you pray

Follow me and I will show you my dream
Where I am the serpent and you are Eve
Follow me and I will show you my deepest
Desires in garden of dream
