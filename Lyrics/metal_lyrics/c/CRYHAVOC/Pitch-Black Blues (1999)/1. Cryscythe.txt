All your tearsâ¦

Cryscythe... time is right
Autumn is near, moon shines bright
It's time to find a new nest
For my nocturnal fest.
So many years, you have known
If thereâs a seed you gotta let grow
Once a seed, then a tree
That's how the story goes you see

You're like a leaf, dried out and falls from the tree
Another reason,another season
It's time to let your tree grow free

[Chorus:]
I will leave you like light leaves us in fall
Cryscythe... will harvest all your tears... through the years

Cryscythe... time is right autumn is here,
And moon shines bright
Harvest fest in new nest
And you know the rest
Your tears... fall like rain,
Drop by drop like blood from vein,
The scythe has cut you it has made you bleed,
Those sweet tears â is what I need.

[Chorus:]
I will leave you like light leaves us in fall
Cryscythe... will harvest all your tears
And I will leave you like light leaves us in fall
Cry... Cry... Cryscythe... harvest fest through the years
...with all your tears...

Can't you see,
How leaves have fallen from the tree,
Another reason,another season
It's time to let you tree grow free...

[Chorus:]
I will leave you like light leaves us in fall
Cryscythe... will harvest all your tears
And I will leave you like light leave us in fall
Cry... Cry... Cryscythe...harvest fest through the years
...with all your tears...
