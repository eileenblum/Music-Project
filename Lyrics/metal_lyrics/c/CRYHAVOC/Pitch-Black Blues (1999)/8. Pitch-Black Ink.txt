I can tell you this story is true

At the very first time I look at you I saw something in your eyes
I was dressed in black, and you in so pure white
That first time we met
I still remember what you said
And that first morning I rose from your bed
There's still so many questions where the answers I got to find
With the sorrow's pitch-black ink your picture is tattooed in my mind

(Pitch-black blues baby) [6x]

Another morning after without you
From the floor I wake, roof is falling down on me
How on earth I was so blind that your grief I couldn't see

Ah, can you still remember it
And those carnal things we did
I'm standing on a cliff, so near fall into pit
Every night I hear your voice and it keeps me like a whip
And under nightly sky Iâm asking myself why

(Pitch-black blues baby) [6x]

Another morning after without you
From the floor I wake, roof is falling down on me
How on earth I was so blind that your grief I couldn't see

Alone in rain I stand and wonder why I was so fool
Every night intoxicated I'm singing this pitch-black blues

(Pitch-black blues baby) [6x]

Another morning after with out you
From the floor I wake, roof is falling down on me
How on earth I was so blind that your grief I couldn't see

Alone in rain I stand and wonder why I was so fool
Every night intoxicated I'm singing this pitch-black blues
I'm singing it for you 'cause every tear I see reminds me of you
