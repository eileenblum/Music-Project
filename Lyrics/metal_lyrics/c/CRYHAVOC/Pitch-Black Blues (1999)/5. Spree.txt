You start to whispering when I wake
Quit speaking when seal breaks
I taste a sweet and bitter taste

The more I drink the more I see
How clearly world opens to me
I can continue this everlasting spree

And I don't need you to tell me how to drink
In the ocean of lies my boat will sink

You speak again when night falls
Scream and shout when I crawl
Whatever, I will loose this all

It doesn't matter is it night or day
From cradle to grave goes this high way
But God knows I won't pray

I break the seal and I say...

You are gone and bottle is still my hand
Alone 'cause no one understands
Alone in the ocean can not see the land
You are gone and bottle is still my hand
Alone in full crowd I stand
And no one here can tell me where's the land...

Drifting and drowning
seeking and finding the way to the land
Or do I really want

I break the seal and I say...

You are gone and bottle is still my hand
Alone 'cause no one understands
Alone in the ocean can not see the land
You are gone and bottle is still my hand
Alone in full crowd I stand
And no one here can tell me where's the land

Iâll find my own way
I break the seal
And I hate this hate
From cradle to grave goes this high way
And God knows I won't pray

I don't need you to tell me how to drink
In the ocean of lies my boat will sink

You are gone and bottle is still my hand
Alone 'cause no one understands
Alone in the ocean can not see the land
You are gone and bottle is still my hand
Alone in full crowd I stand
And no one here can tell meâ¦ where's the land
