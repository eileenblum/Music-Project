October morning
We lay side by side
I take the last look at you
Then I ride...

Night of magic, the night of desire,
passion from delight disappeared in dark.
And only moon could see how I leave

So leave your window open
I'll come with the first cold breeze
First sign of winter,
I'll be gone again with the winter windâ¦

Let the wind blow through your hairâ¦

[Chorus:]
You can't bound the wind,
Forever it has blown, and always will
You can't control me
'Cause my mind is flying free

Curtains are dancing
I appear to you,
Again begin the lustful night
With me and you...

I left your window open
So close it or let it be...
First sign of winter
I'll be gone again with that winter wind

[Chorus:]
You can't bound the wind,
Forever it has blown, and always it will
With the wings of winter I ride
Between those legs spread so wide
You can't bound the wind,
Forever it has blown, and always will
You can't control me
'Cause my mind is flying free... to leave

My mind is flying free... to leave
You can't bound me, like you can't bound the wind
My darling, my body stays but mind is flying freeâ¦

Let the wind blow through your hair
Let it touch you everywhere
Let the wind blow through your hairâ¦

[Chorus:]
You can't bound the wind (you can't)
Forever it has blown, and always it will
With the wings of winter I ride
Between those legs spread so wide
You can't bound the wind (you can't)
Forever it has blown, and always will
You can't control me
'Cause my mind is flying free... to leaveâ¦
