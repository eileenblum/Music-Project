I've seen you in a darkness
your face in a dusk
your silhouette in a shades
eyes gleaming full of lust

You try to dazzle me
with your beauty
You try to bewitch me.

When cold north wind blows
I can smell your perfume
when frost bites
I feel your lips on my neck

I donÂ´t want to share my life
oh no with you
I want your sweets
and things we used to do

No... You can't reach my love
so go or be mistress of my dreams
No... In my life there's no room for you
As you know, your flesh is what I want

I hear your lullaby. Ah, that sweet melody
and I can remember those words
which (you) whispered in my ear

You try to dazzle me with your beauty
You try to bewitch me
I feel your loving embrace
in my dream I see your face
your soft skin under my fingertips
And a taste of your lips

But I don't want to share my life
oh no with you
I want your sweets
and things we used to do

The time you spent with me
Was nothing but the dream
And that's the thing can you see

You were the chosen one
we made love under never-setting sun
And that's the everything
I could do with you...

No... You can't reach my love
so go or be mistress of my dreams
No... In my life there's no room for you
As you know, your flesh is what I want

Dark desire dressed in black
you try to turn me your back
but you desire me
like a darkness desires you
you try to forget
those times we spend together
but your desire is
what bothers you the most

No... You can't reach my love
so go or be mistress of my dreams
No... In my life there's no room for you
As you know, your flesh is what I want

Do it, do it end your life
but don't tease me anymore
with your cries repent... repent... repent whore
