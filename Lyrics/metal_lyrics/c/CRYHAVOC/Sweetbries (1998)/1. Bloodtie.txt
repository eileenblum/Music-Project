Our love, was bounded by oath,
everlasting oath sworn with blood,
but I was left alone with these scars
and in my dreams you still got that same grimace

[Chorus:]
My destiny is written in stars
oh so high
I know that the time will heal these wounds
And I'll be ready to goâ¦
by thy side

Now you try to fool me again
now you try to get me back again
but the oath is gone
I have crossed the line
'Cause my blood is black
and yours as red as wine

[Chorus:]
My destiny is written in stars
oh so high
And now when the time has healed these wounds
and I'm ready to go...
I'm ready to go.

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Yeah, my destiny is written in stars
oh so high
And now when the time has healed these wounds
and I'm ready to go.
