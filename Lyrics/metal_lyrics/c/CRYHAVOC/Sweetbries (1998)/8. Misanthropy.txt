They try to see through my empty shell
they try to see through my living hell
They try to realize what I'm inside
that thing they never gonna find

So go leave me here
I want you to disappear
Like a raven into black winter night

So go leave me here
I want you to disappear
So go leave alone in the night

Now you try to tell me what to do
Hey, I do what ever I want to do
So you try to tell me that's not right
you try to pull me into light

So go leave me here
I want you to disappear
Like a raven into black winter night

So go leave me here
I want you to disappear
So go leave alone in the night

Sorrow is my guide
my heart is open wide to your lies
all your goddamn lies

So what are you still staring at...
So go leave me here
I want you to disappear
So go leave alone in the night

Sorrow is my guide
my heart is open wide to your lies
all your goddamn lies
