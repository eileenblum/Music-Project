I am standing in the wilderness of wood
Listening the chant of my Gods
I feel the northern blow and
I hear it, how it sings

When I'm in my the wooden sanctuary
I feel my mortality

I realize how weak I am
When I'm in my sanctuary
When lightning strikes
I feel my mortality

When I'm in my the wooden sanctuary
I feel my mortality

A blaze of fire, rise so high
while I raise my hands towards the sky
You pray your gods to save me
but can't you fucking see

I deny all your "gods"
I don't worship those
I respect only laws of nature

You tell me how necessary
Itâs to believe
and I tell you it's not

So you tell me how necessary
it is to believe
I think that necessary
is something that
you can't live without

I open my eyes and I see the truth
your "God" won't help
while mine takes you too

a blaze of fire, rise so high
while I raise my hands towards the sky
I'm a pagan
I'm a godless heathen
I don't need your illusion

a blaze of fire, rise so high
while I raise my hands towards the sky
in my heart there's no "God" within
Because my heart is filled with sin
