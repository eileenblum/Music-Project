Night is still we wait the moment
to start this ceremony
âcause this is the point
we always wanted to reach
to hear a hollow voice
of your previous preach..., yeah

We howl you we observe the rite
We howl you from your precious cradle
Wolfdance, wolfdance... lead us to theâ¦
We howl you we observe the rite
We howl you from your precious cradle
Wolfdance, wolfdance... lead us to the trance

Night is still, it starts soon
the circle is full
to you mother moon
we've gathered here
to see your face
We have burnt the fire
in this holy place

We are ready to see your whores
We are ready to feel your presence
'cause this is the point
We always wanted to reachâ¦
to hear a hollow voice
of your precious preachâ¦ Satana!

We howl you we observe the rite
We howl you from your precious cradle
Wolfdance, wolfdance... lead us to theâ¦
We howl you we observe the rite
We howl you from your precious cradle
Wolfdance, wolfdance... lead us to the trance
Lead us to the trance
