You came to talk to me
we talk for a while
nothing really to say
so we drink a bottle of wine
dusk turns to night
While we leave together
You still think - I'm the one
who loves you forever

I taste your precious fruit of passion
and you think that I'm the one
but I just want your feminine charm
and I take something you got only one...

Our love withers as those flowers in a fall
I'm not gonna stay and watch you how you crawl
before new day will dawn I'll be gone
I will fade away before aurora turns a day...

You came to talk with me
when we saw again
you wanted to feel my love again
dusk turns to night
While we leave together
You still think - I'm the one
who loves you forever

We made love by the fire âtil the wee hours
rosy fingered dawn is near
you fall a sleep while I'm a wake
The lands of night calling me âcause

Our love withers as those flowers in a fall
I'm not gonna stay and watch you how you crawl
before new day will dawn I'll be gone
I will fade away before aurora turns a day...

I will fade away!

âCause our love withers as those flowers in a fall
I'm not gonna stay and watch you how you crawl
Before new day will dawn I'll be gone
I will fade away before aurora turns a day...

I will fade away!
