Plunge the crushing depths with screams
Wretched ablution ritual constrains
Rusted chapters

Aeons in festering quagmire
Scour the unwilling mind

Execration. Confusion. Abject repulsion.

Lingering breath sinks away
Aspersion condemns to an eternity of moil
Hateful catechism drowns you
Within the hexed font of octagonal moons

Internicion finalized at the tip of spears
Fate shuns to weave a more lamentable chord
The abyssic cruelty thoust command on whim
Lechery salivates infernally, callously

Silver of steel flashes in the torches gleam
The hangman's garb of murky pitch
Veiled crypts cloister arcane secrets
The heart of the world weeps athirst
Guardian's dagger, the third extinguishes
