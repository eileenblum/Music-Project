Achieving a frail, ephemeral balance between
Obliviating the mortal vessel
And retaining a whole mental state
Pure lucidity of thought for infinity

Degeneration of bodies,
Theirs is a a limited life;
In the perfection of coma,
The exaltation of blessed dream
Exploring minds of others from without, within

Stars beyond planets beyond time beyond death
Thoughts stretch to aeons within seconds
The mind, unconscious, racing faster
Than its flawed organic wiring
A twisted, rotting immortality
That stands timeless

They lie supine as gods, motionless
Content to sacrifice their withered bodies
For their own eternity
