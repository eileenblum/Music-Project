Wandering with a crown of scythes
Swollen disease of netherarchy
Advance and be known, rent knees process in the wake
Souls from Thalatte, seven gods who decree
Writhe! The Shar is upon all Kishar

Lust inglouriously reigns
Tomes and relics of vast decay
Violent storms, exhalted serpant
Jackals rip the carrion shroud

Wandering with a crown of scythes
Swollen disease of netherarchy
Advance and be known, rent knees process in the wake
Souls from Thalatte, seven gods who decree
Writhe! The Shar is upon all Kishar

Compendium of ancient knowledge
Conductus viscera organum
Hideous cacophony in perfection of the fifth ars veterum
Wickedness of the teachings shall be obliterated
Lies scraped from parchment, psao,
Scraped of flesh
Malicious rival
Black beast with figure in maw
Initiation of incantation to let flow the wrath of Asag
In his eclipse rivers boil
Achieve corrupt henosis, emanations from oneness
Wretch to the aether: to Hen, Nous, Psyche...Physis
Theurgy through contemplations
Leather cord pulled taut reveals
Shekinah dethroned
