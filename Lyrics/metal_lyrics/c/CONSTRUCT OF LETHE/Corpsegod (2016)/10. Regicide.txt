Come! Come and watch them regale their prophets again
Seeping sores adorn chapel floors
As blisters grind between flesh, marble and iron
Nails...bring forth more nails to fix this falsifier
Affix him to his throne of thorns!
Thorns!
Affixed to his rightful throne!

Gather up more thorns to coronate a hypocrite
Coronated and eviscerated in his rightful realm
And so cry forth to the wheeling heavens

"I am a brother to dragons
My skin hangs obsidian
Upon me as a lecherous mantle
And mine bones are scorched with heat
See that my harp has turned to mourning
And my voice like a chorus of those who weep"

Bones...seek out more bones to lay before the liar
Along a putrid pilgrimage
Souls...devour more souls to cast into the deathvoid
So they might rend sackcloth and anoint themselves with dust
