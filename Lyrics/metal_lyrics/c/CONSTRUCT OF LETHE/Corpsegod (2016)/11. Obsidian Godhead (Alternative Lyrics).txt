A possessing malignancy, contemptuous hymn
Diseased winds churn with hooves of the pale horse
Cryptic cacophony shatters silenced thirsting jaws
Flagellators bear their backs to the scourge
Solvet saeclum in favilla

Bleed the faithful, bleed for coming rapture
In sackcloth lay the mass grave of man
Holy hope, so passes worldly glory into the mouth of maggots
Distended gullets shiver in slow decay

Solvet saeclum in favilla

Dust and chine slip through the glass of time
Life's flask, shattered, leaks her essence to the soil

Such bitter prose from Patmos
Hell mouth's miasma exhaled, casts off untimely figs
Intoxicating stench of human necrosis
Solvet saeclum in favilla
