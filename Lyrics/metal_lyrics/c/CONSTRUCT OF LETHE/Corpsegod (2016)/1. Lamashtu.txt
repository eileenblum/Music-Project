Vaticinium ex eventu, the scholium of Siculus tells of
An idol of arsenic's diluted gift to those cast in flesh and soil
And the dust of starlight
He is seated with palms offered to the mottled roil above
Where they, short of life, are turned short of breath
Strangle the breath amidst the wails of seven
Only ashes remain to float to the brazier
Sardonic laughter, she grins in succulent suffocation
Contracted limbs and mouth agape, slip away
Come not near divine death, lest he make you like a lamb betwixt his jaws
And you become carried away as the wind in the breach of his throat
Come forth Mot, and submit at Hadad's feast
For his hunger is like that of wolves in the wilderness
Seek out the ravine where blind men lie headless, prostrated and castrated
Siket Sayidna Musa shalt thou follow, the steps of penitence
Drown in a final dawn, so there plunge from their Jabal
And shatter with your ruin those fevered scratchings on stone
