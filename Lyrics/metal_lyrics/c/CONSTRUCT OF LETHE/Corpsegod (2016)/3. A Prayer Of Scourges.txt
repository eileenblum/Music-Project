Ecce Homo! Behold ye vexated ones, the scourged, bound and crowned man
What passion is wrought here by wrought iron barbed
Each lashing a new implication and judgment
He of Bisenti and the mocking throng flank as rouge flecked wings
Now alone...Violaceous tattered garb draped 'round low shoulders
That have born the burden of those who shout Non Serviam
Blissful blood is the wine, and the cup runneth over
And extinguish the flame of that which burns not
A nail for each apportionment of the Trinity
A spear for lustful blasphemy â Arma Christi
He is despised and rejected of men, misericordia
Acquainted he is with grief. We lay our iniquity upon him
