Rhetor utters falseness high upon onyx cathedra
Shade raised of sacrificial lamb buried beneath the altar
Moil of souls to the charnel field's north wall
Rosch Hassatan
Ra's Alghul
Tseih She

Demon head mausoleum
Corpses piled and devoid
Inverted goat crucifixion perversion

My vitriol is as magma to your words of wax
Melt before my path, flee from the vortex I alone decree
All machinations of heresy I design
Sacred whore, vexation's font
Abhorrent terror vacuum

When the twelve are none, the circle is six
Daggers of light plummet beneath
Unharrowed hell, fire-tranced thralldom
Come forth unto the rack
