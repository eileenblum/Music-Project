Raping auspices, surrounded by the plight
As Aegypius take flight the elder senses six
While the other sees twelve
Attacked by ancient plague

Tiresias' clairvoyance conveys from transformations
Burnt offering smoke
Eighteen illusions
Copulation with snakes, curse of impiety
While the parchment smolders
Plunge within augury

The past and present flow from shadows
Coalesce into the nethervoid wept of bereft eye sockets
Hung and dressed for the flay
Drunk on the veins of ritual sacrifice

The tympanic bequeaths vision to malleus
So the speech of vultures can be discerned
The elegiac hymns from the fore reverse their workings
Rot of augury

How the embrace of Tilphussa soothes
As the bolt nests in your heart

Exuded delusions, an entry to not
Witness before time as flesh lies tattered
Revolt in the pit
Attacked by ancient plague
