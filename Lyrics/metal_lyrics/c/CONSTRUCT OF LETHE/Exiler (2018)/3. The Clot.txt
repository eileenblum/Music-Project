Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent
Consecrated schema scorns naive novitiate

Conscientiousness undone
Penned within Euchologion bound in flesh
Each sticheron leads to megalynarion,
The laughter comprehends
Recite backwards Slotho d-Yeshu
Though you do not speak
Eastern formulae sleepless ones celebrate in perpetua

A corpse mound pulpit from which Axeinos spurts, oozing wretch
Rise 'alaq and fill the void created for thee

His wings are numbered hexakosioi hexekonta hex

Thrice the stigma is as a ligature, tightened 'bout the throat
I undertake katabasis to descend to the Hetoimasia
Affliction amongst dieties
Crawl from the desert with phulakterion bound to the limb
Regurgitate the schema: listen, hear, do unholiness
Sanctify to me!

Retsu'ot coils tightly on the throat
None there amidst the black but my god
Rose the gallows for crows
"How manifold are they works?"
Who coverest himself with plague as a mantle of gold?
