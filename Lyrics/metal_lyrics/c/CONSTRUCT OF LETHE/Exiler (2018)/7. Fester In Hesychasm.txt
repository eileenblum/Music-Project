Fester in Hesychasm upon a tower of silence
The immolation reeks from phylacteries
Nasu bow to me
Nusessalars! Pallbears of the crypt

In speech, in tongue like Stentor the depths are called
Carving waste paths to the cloister
Holy whore
She beckons with eyes bleeding black

I see in statuesque ruin she holds his punctured corpse
Weeping, internally bleeding

Sacrifice initiates silence
Lies built upon a carrion shroud
Defiled Eucharist fixed to five points

From him flows utter eternal decay

Utter blasphemies, inverted script
Whisper the urging of sins, beckoned by the liar

Constriction to suffocate
Insidious flesh abounds
Disbeliever upon the brow etched
What his breath touches all dissolves

She envenoms and ensnares the light
In a goat mask she's veiled
Inhale the abyss
Lungs of flesh and time fill with the abortion of humanity
