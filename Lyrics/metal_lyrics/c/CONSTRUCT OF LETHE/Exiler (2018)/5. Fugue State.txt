Awake inside a rock cut tomb, perhaps a surgical theater
The light is so faint that I can't really tell for sure
What I am totally aware of however,
Is the small, disproportionately miniature head in my right hand
It is wrapped in layer upon layer of gauze
As I begin unraveling the first few
I come to the realization that I have in my hand
The head of Jesus fucking Christ

Though I do not see it, I know this is fact
One of those revelations one gets only in a dream
To know without knowing
Clear fluid begins seeping out from the Veronica, and I am terrified
I am drenched in what I assume is sweat,
Though it may also be pericardial fluid
And my heart is racing, going into hypovolemic shock
The head of Christ is mocking me
I struggle against the crossbeam
How did it come to this?
Now that asphyxiation sets in

I was always the crucified

Faces drain to alabaster sensing the wheeling of radius
Forcing hands to supine
Crawling to the standing, onward to the kneeling
Precious sepsis come quickly upon infelix lignum
Arbori suspendere
Supplicium more maiorum

A filled Ob around her neck, stretching taught, uttering lament
She revealed these things unto me, and I was unafraid
Inscriptions of Elohim and the watcher over the feasts of depravity
Are rooted in ancient tongues - pluralis excellentiae
Lead weights and leather cord lead to the coldness
Cracked lips
Servitude
Grief
Faith's decapitant
Rise draconian law, come and smash the earth
Cleanse the weak by the means of storms
A disease, that will distort and shift the body
Augment the flesh by flames to travel asunder
Among bloody marble halls
Censer bearers moan in rags, the fume fails to cleanse the air
Another's savior they cry "come and see, he is beside thee"
I spat
My own requiem to a rotting coffin
I fester, seethe, and boil
