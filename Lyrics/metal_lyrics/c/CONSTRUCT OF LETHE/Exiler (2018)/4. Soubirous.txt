Recumbent, lie as hewn gisant
Effigy in eternal repose, hands clasped in prayer
Hands with skin sloughing off
Await resurrection, await nothing
In the partial light, the transi seems to swarm

Vile supper for the crawling and gnawing
As I was above, as I am below
Shrouded, borne by pleurants eight
Insatiable, I delve into the thorax

Remove Soubirous' heart, her falseness intoxicates
Defile the incorrupt, wax face is mine to covet

Ribs snap in the course of inquiry
Ligaments I find still supple after all these years
Putrid odor of unsanctity condemns her glorification
Aquero spoke at the seventeenth vision
What whispered the wretch?
"Consecrate a chapel for my vanity"
Raped immaculately
