De profundis clamavi ad te Domine
Domine, exaudi vocem meam

Stare into the empty eyes of her
Hodegetria begins hematemsis
It flows over the pale skin of the acheiropoieta
Forged by no hands

Bury me in lapidation and shelter me from the light of the lamb
I see no more as Rajm casts dust upon the fire

Servants walk the threshing floor wreathed in pitted marble
Decay has set in, the stench of millennia
Thy gaze is fractured as a fissure splits the sclera
Pupil of black enters chamber
She whispers a faint apolytikion to the cradled maggot

Mary, art thou not a liar: why then dost thou not to the catacombs
And lay beneath a retamaine, praying for death
And dream of being held in the streams of Al-Maghtas
lungs heave, your son holds you under, he is no more nimbated
