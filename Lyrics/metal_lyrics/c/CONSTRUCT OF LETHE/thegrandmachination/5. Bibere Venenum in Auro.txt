Aghast, I depart the pestilence of creation, breathless dream void
Leave them to teach the gospel of soul suicide and the anathema of Zos

âBreed consciousness in the charnel house of putrefactionâ
Conjure the seven wicked storm demons who darken the moon
Do not suffer to endure the light, yet cause the shroud of night to be as cannibal

Sister consumes the flesh of brother
Hideous concubation
Inverted holy self-nullification, Be'er Shachat
Rise up Bar Kokhba replace the gouged city with Aelia Capitolina
For thine is truly the falseness, and the anti-kleos, forever

Philosophallacy
Terror mechanism
Souls caught as grist in the mill of salvation
