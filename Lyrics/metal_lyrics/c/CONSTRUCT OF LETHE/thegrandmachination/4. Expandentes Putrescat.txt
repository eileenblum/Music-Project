A vain clergy profoundly indignant of their inherit falsehood
Vomit atrocities from the great defiler

A most lamentable configuration, lusting fingers trace spheres to open the All Gifted's box

A realm of shades is the abattoir beneath your narthex

Transubstantiate this ossuary â give rise to pale mysteries, those that lurk within the candelabrum
Skeletal chandeliers suspended from his lofty grace where the wick lies snuffed
Malicious triptych conceals decapitations in the transept, transcend your decrepitude
Frocked in vestments of apocalypse
