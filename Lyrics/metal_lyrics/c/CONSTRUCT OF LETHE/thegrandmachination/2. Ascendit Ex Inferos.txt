My scars are symbols, lashes formed sigils, I have become
The dread abomination that spawned four lecherous cruelties within a whirlwind
Hear uttered a child's creation upon festering incantations carried with miasmic breath
Logic castration, a eunuch of natural order

Blistered flesh as a scroll unwound before me, I saw and read the names Qemetial, Belial, Othiel
Draconian aeon writhes formless, birth pains pierce nebulous womb
Amniotic bile flows as mercury, transcribe the riddle of constellations
A vintage of frothed rouge disease drips from a gorgon's maw

Impaled are those who come against, and they shall break and fall to the soil

Plucked as the eyes of Gestas, flung unward into moil
Behold the world lies prostrate, genuflect
As it prepares to coronate death to reign from the throne of wounds
Let me be the catafalque of Christ, another skull upon the goat throne
