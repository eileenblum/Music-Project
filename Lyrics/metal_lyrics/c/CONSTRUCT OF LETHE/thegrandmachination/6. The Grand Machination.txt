Return once more to a void resplendent
Silent choirs emanate through fissures in shattered time

Such a vast deception I shall never witness again
Sequenti die aurora apparente,
Altis Vocibus Baphometh Invocaverunt

As the next day dawned, they called loudly upon Baphometh

Trisagion invocate barabaric infliction
Seraph connotate serpent or Akero
Apotheosis transfixion, repulsive hekhal resounding
Self immolation decreed for those so far from Atziluth
I dissolve and fall away like rain against the chapel glass
