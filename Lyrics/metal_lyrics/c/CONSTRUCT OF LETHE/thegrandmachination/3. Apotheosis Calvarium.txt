Jackals teeth jut from a child's jaw, rending the suckling teeth
From the manger he treads the Via Dolorosa unknowingly, each step closer to Golgotha

Seek out a name which is not found in all the letters, signs or sigils
An unspeakable sound which plagues the mind and besieges the soul

In him lies the redundancy of hell, pale horse incarnate, in him is the vast funeral of man

I went about seeking and beheld the Mashiac...
Thy speech is as a swarm of flies that presbyters to a world that is hell enough
Blessed oscularum infame dethrones the man of sorrows
His flock, lo, would unfetter a murderer in the stead of a scourged bastard
Lashed then lashed to the stauros, fixed by the nails through capitate and lunate
Use of hypopodium...Aufbinden...Shackled and suspended

E'li, E'li, la'ma Sabachthani?

Ridicule within the Aedicule, iconostasis separates
Tears of the mother - Lo Spasimo
Woman, behold your son

Cracked lips so parched from delusions...I thirst
As titans swallow the Omphalos
It is finished
