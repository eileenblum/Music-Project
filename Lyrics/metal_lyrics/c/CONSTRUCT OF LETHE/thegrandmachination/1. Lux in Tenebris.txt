Embrace me Thanatos that I might fall
Seduce me Hypnos that I might lap the silver waters and forget
But lo, at his heel bone I stood shackled and forced to witness
My glass eyes were held open by another's will

Had I the faculty to shatter my vision!

And I behold a pale man, and the name by which he called himself was Father...Hell followed with him

And he gave power unto himself over the expanse of nothingness before a crystal throne casting forth the hand emblazoned 'Solve' spewed all manners of tribulations whereas from the hand emblazoned 'Coagula' flowed ecclesiastical vexations

Streams of spheres ablaze rent the formless firmament, for his vainful pleasure
I dared loose my tongue against such lurid extravagances, and I would not serve
I fell and I rose like a star, like a sun
I slipped into a shade-less plane of nonexistence
Bright arms radiating about my core, collapsing and yet bursting forth
Depthless chasms of lucid dreams
Stalactites of scabs are the clotted veins, like slowly curing wax

Let flood waters of Acheron bury the flesh on Ararat
As feathers fell away the vestments of ivory warped into obsidian
As the halo of gold melted away, the hood removed revealed horns of ibex
Cast aside to form Saturn's rings
