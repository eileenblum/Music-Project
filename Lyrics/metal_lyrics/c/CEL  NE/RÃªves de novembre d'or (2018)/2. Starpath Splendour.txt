In night's splendour
Stellar sparkles flickering
Nocturnal glimpsing eyes
In starlights' heaven
I whisper
My longing faulty words

As the moon can't stand without light from the sun
The jewel of love, invaluable, adorns my dreams
...the hope to hold your hand...
...on the moonlight-shaped silver path...

Clear and bright
Like celestial light
That's grown dim and pale

Cold and tight
When within there's a fight
Leading in frail

Pale moonlight illuminates the night
En-chanting airs
And silvering waters

By starlight, this ethereal sight
Silent tears
And unanswered prayers

"Deluded sinful life
Is it a tainted obsession
Have I really bound my being
With your golden sobriquet?"

In the night, this ethereal moonlight
Enchanting airs
And silvering waters

By starlight, this silver painted sight
Silent tears
And unanswered prayers

Clear and bright
Like celestial light
For you to adore

Cold and tight
When within there's a fight
That shall be no more

In night's splendour
Stellar sparkles flickering
Nocturnal glimpsing eyes
In starlights's heaven
I whisper
My truthful words

As the sun needs to offer his light to the moon
The jewel of love, I offer to you
To hold your hand
On this moonlight shaped silver path...
