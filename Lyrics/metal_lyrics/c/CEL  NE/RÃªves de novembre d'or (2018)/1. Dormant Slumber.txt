(This fading somber light
Restoring memories

This soft coffin of soul
Vessel to the land of dreams
Render this radiance
A blessing of the conscious

To the night's hallows
A lucid charm)

Tempting hands of Morpheus entangle
To submerge in sleep
Vestments of endless night
Confine pensiveness
The fading eyes
In corridors of psyche
Imprisoned in
A carnal sanctum
A blooming lily resides inside
Against the cursive flow of time
Dwindling in vital signs (Inside)
Sauntering in dreamful paths (Floating above)
In distraught figures
Deformed reality
Needful silence weighs
Precious sunrise fades far
Where life seems another dream
Distressed shadows on walls
Extending desperate hands
Pale figures beckoning from away
Fragments of life in persistent hue

Pulsating chords adjusting time
A presence dominant and still

Crowned in disharmony of paths (substantial)
Retrieving misdeeds

Afflicted shades of the damned
Extending hands to touch
Thousands branched roots of an eternal trunk
Fragments of life in forthcoming death
Laying, to rest at last
Persistent, inside
Safe now, from deadly touch
Floating in time

A promise blooms on lips
A silent oath (Oh, precious melody)
Irrefutably spoken
Of return (of chaos, guide this soul)
