I walk alone, on murky paths, away from light
Mysteries haunt my entity, this whole silent world
An eerie essence, above all existence, is present within
Befriend the night, when the pale moonlight
Will lead you over the silver painted waters
The snowy mountains beyond, the shady valleys ahead
The sounds of nature, my company - my burden unknown
A tranquil glade, a sparkling fountain
Crystal clear consciousness - necessity of rest

Meadows, shadowy and untrodden
Prairies, spreading ahead
Far beyond, sighted away
A senile plane tree
Rain now may fall from the ruthful skies
Invigorating the land
A shelter - the mighty branches
A safe lee to rest

Grizzly - horizon
The lighting - of mild storm
Dazzles the sight
The rain
Drips cognition
Inside

Destined
To reach insight
To solve the riddle
Follow the stars
To hear
The voices' calling
To unfold your
(Trail)

Serenity of calmness, scent of vivificated land
Is my company - my burden unknown
