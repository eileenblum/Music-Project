Silver moonlight
Shapes in the dark
A path that I will walk alone

Those yours two words
That gave and took me everything
My dreams in silence drowned

The facts and secrets that I chose to keep in me
And this cold solitude I cannot stand within

Lay to sleep and let your music flow
As time stands still, slowly passing
I'll sail away from you

Sere November leaves
Scattered around
In this lone life field of sorrow

And this cold wind
Serenely blows
Leading me to my cold tomorrow

As night falls I still need your arms around me tight
But I can't stand like then you telling me goodnight

Lay to sleep and let your music flow
As time stands still, slowly passing
I'll sail away from you

Now fade away
But I'll be always there around
To watch and observe upon you

I know I 'll never have you
I know I'm on my own
But my wings will always
Cover you....
