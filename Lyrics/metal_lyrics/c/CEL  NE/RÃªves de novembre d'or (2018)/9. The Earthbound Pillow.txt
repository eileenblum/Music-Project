All it had to be discordant
Lifelike dreams redound in abhorrence
Impetuous immersion
In cold waves of your distancing
I don't need another body
To reside upon - deficiency
Reluctant to compromise
I've ended up in here

Ambiguous adversity
Abide gradually

Unaltered morals
In valediction
Mortification
Estrangement season

Disclose these last essential words
This broken paradise's epitaph
In this collapsing counterfeit world
A bleeding last goodbye

In dreams I wandered all around
(In dreams of distant touch)
In futile paths I walked
(In shadows you reside)
By time's relentless rationale
(By timeless dimensions)
Proceeding in disquiet

Discarding a whole world
Built alongside in throe
Persistent obsession
Causation to move on
A solemn promise had been done
Imposing declaration

For all that is significant
A moral preservation

Be done the will of destiny
(Illisible scripts of faith)
Be done the will of me
(With perseverance)
With thoroughgoing conscience
(Acquired in strain)
Will conclude (the)/my quest

The spiral wheel of time
Will move forever on
Harmonics of past
Will resonate and sing

On shore sand, closed eyes
Laid on sea bed, pale and wearied

In deep waters submerged
By lack of light, disappearing
