It's been countless fearful years
I've been festering in your bleak walls
The rain of chaos - decay
With moldering dreams I endure

Dim rays of sun
Light through the barriers of isolation
Abhorrence of sanity
Futile meanings of life

Nothing can be hurt down here

Sheltered beyond this sequestered lone path
Discreet silence emanating from within
Delegate to relief
And slink beyond the drape

Infused and diversified through restless time
Versed and graced by the everlasting pain
Delegate to relief
And slink beyond the drape

Undenied, emerging below
Memories attempt to shine
Rifting through the barriers of cruelty
There, in lucid light

Dimensional impenetrable grey cage
Guarded by deadly cravings
Escape had always been an untouched fear
Futile meanings of life

The barriers fall
This sole perception so enhanced

The drapery lifts
Fearful desire of lifeline touch

Sheltered beyond this sequestered lone path
Discreet silence emanating from within
Delegate to relief
And slink beyond the drape

Infused and diversified through restless time
Versed and graced by the everlasting pain
Delegate to relief
And slink beyond the drape
