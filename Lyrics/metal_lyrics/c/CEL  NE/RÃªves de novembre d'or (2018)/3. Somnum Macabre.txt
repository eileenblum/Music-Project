Endorsed by deprival life code
Consciousness faltering and naive
In formidable nights, lurking beyond reality
But truthful aside

In grim insight of allegories
Enshrouded suffocating
What's left of the precise emotions
Before the rageful storm

Horrid candlelight
Upon a demented sleep
Imprisoned within
A heavy breath

"The light was shaded from the locust
In shape of un-utilized time"

Framed willingly and absurdly,
The essence grew inside
By time passing by, combined
And enflamed the heart

Sanity and derangement
Flickering inside
Indifference and delusions
Crave a benighted path

Indignities in sore eyes
Degrading reasoning
In saturated sheerness
This crucial frailty

Inscribed on heart
And former benevolent mind
A burden that cumbers the soul
Shining on nights of un-fulfilled dreams
Demention threatens ahead

Reunified to present
Accept the gift of awareness
Out of oblivious chambers
In distant spectral worlds

Derelict in promised lands
Of fantasies un-achieved
Desolate wandered
In| pallid, sallow dreams - of

Remission - equity
Revoked - sleep
Senses - discreet

The sickening sopor is pushing aside
Deviant to the timeless state

[Piano and violin verse]

In flagrant shadows
This ebony cold bed
The languishing bouquet
Craving for salvation
