We'll wander on the sea, of our lives
Fighting waves, tearing us apart

We'll roam upon the time
While desires will be sought by our hearts

Thirteen years I still await
Keeping your memory inside
In an endless game of values
To face you equally
Delicately closed eyebrows
In exchange for meeting here
Just to feel this presence now defy
These barriers of sanity
Far, in sparkling blue horizon
Flickering stars mark a lost path
Leading out of dreams in pious wishes
Fragile fulfillment
Wandering on time, dimensions bizarre
Roaming on seas, twisted and bleak

For your star, I travelled far
In unfamiliar lands
Rupture dividend, in memorable sites
I held your delicate hand
Fading lights in horror's sight
Stay here, safe to rest
In your eyes I see demise
Let me take it away
I did never say it's over
Long now waiting for your signs
In your prospect's flying colors never
Ceased to believe
May the dreams be purified
And the wistfulness asleep
From illusions of the past and cravings
Stay always safely away

Time flew, I needed you
I was always here
Absurd hate, chaotic fate
You see...
I consent
I told you never to leave my own life
It's true
All these reminiscence will fade and wither

You're still a precious, unique and timeless part of me
Then why do you secede?
All this ethereal feeling cannot be true after all
Wouldn't you live here with me?

The light that used to bathe you, has grown dim and cold
The forfeit for this loss, this glorious place will perish
A monument in time, we'll always have the city of roads

Doubtful and unresolved
This valediction - farewell
We'll always have the city of roads
