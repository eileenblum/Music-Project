"Through this cold crystal I gaze
The glowing starful light maze"

Past the harvest month and empty dull days
Haze obfuscates the glass
Lone, pure reasoning
As the fall's fading far

"The stars... shimmering on sky's chasm
Eternal candles we'll never touch"
Day grows shorter
Last rays of sunlight fade away
Into this sorrowful dimension laid to rest
As ruminations shimmering inside
Silence, like maledict, collapsing under strife
Cold getting under skin, exhausts
And may the desired, forgetful sleep
In peaceful dreams, comes upon

Forsake the pale reflection away in pain
Shed rivers will keep flowing to the ocean

The sowing's grace, in hazy glory
A timeless story of rebirth, through redemption of death

The autumn wind blows straight and cold
Sounding like it grieves
As slowly pass before my eyes
Sear November leaves
