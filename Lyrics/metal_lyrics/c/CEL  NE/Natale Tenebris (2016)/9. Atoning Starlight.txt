Footsteps on snow
Long way to roam
Heavy the armature on hands

Festive bells sound
Soothe and profound
By sanative time's sands

Into the falling snow, standing with reverence
With sparks of warmth inside, and eyes open wide
Into their hearts they know the truth undefiled
Unlimited of love made malice resign

Lights in clear night sky are now shown far away
Dark clouds no more shade the land
Shady trees around no more seem to scare
Life is flowing again

Just as before the nightmare began
Stars are shining on clear skies
Storms and winds ceased to behold the moment
Of the atonement

Sleeping in the shades and hidden from corrosion
Pure still persists, immaculate remains
When in paths of life a disarray is at hand
Saintly will emerge to relieve the pain

And if your skies are gray and inner storms do fluster
And you're walking on your darkest night alone
Swiftly â if you just truly believe for a moment
Fondness comes along and troubles are long gone

When your winter's cold, and when your heart feels empty
When the weight of world seems heavier than you bear
Strongly keep your faith, don't let your fears take over
And the gift of love will shine everywhere!
