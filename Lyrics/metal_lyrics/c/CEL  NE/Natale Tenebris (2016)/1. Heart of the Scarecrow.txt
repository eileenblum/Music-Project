Of straw and fear is my existence, destination hollow
Never thought that in my lifeless life I'd change the path I followed
Out on the corn fields in the midnight, that lustful witch came
Her bloody kisses gave me heart and life, but now the world I blame

Men carve their hatred in stony faces, and glancing cold eyes
Gaze fulfilled with abhorrence and hearts enclosed by ice
Wandering in this bareless prison I had to comprehend
My entity's abomination should meet its lucid end

In the ruthless fate of world
Through the horizons of hope
Your given heart was destined to be loved

From the ashes of tomorrow
To the river of your sorrow
The occult scripts of unknown fate

Out of the shadows I locate the light but now it's lost again
My drift all in a quest for feelings, now all I feel is pain
Everything is so sick and twisted I must be purged by fire
To the gift of life I'm irrelevant, I'll now feed her desire
