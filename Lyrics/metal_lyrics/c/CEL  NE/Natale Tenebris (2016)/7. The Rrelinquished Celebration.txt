Rise above, you humane selfish love
Recruiting renaissance, so bold and so intense, in grief
Rise and shine, your bleak light so divine
Pitiful masquerade, shady words harshly made, in doom

Infused absurdity in gestures of grin
Disguised in liberal colours of sin
Emerging from black seas of sick fantasies
Tarnished, discordant, expanding disease

"Hassle the wounds of thorns and merely heavy breath"

Under opaque apses, perpetual relapses, how many more tears to spill
Misled and so denied, the view of rightful-eyed, no more perception of real

Discord and perfidy, horrid malingering, forthcoming viciousness in dusk's supremacy

Red upon the eye, horror in the sight
Movements convulsive and aggressive tense
Torches in the night, fading far from sight
As dark's getting even viscous and immense

Evensong's sound, far somewhere out
Dismal ravines and imposing hills
Anxious strife, no signs of life,
But one stone chapel imbued with thrills

Dreams mere fallen apart, this barely beating heart, mariband won't see another dawn
These walls of fondness and love, will soon in wrongness, unjust and ruthlessly torn down

Agony keeps awake
Behold, they overtake

There goes by and above the perception of the shady rules of being
Which slips away in stifling moments in this dark nocturnal sea
Then departed we will be but this judgmental plea
The torture of this martyrdom over their heads shall be

House of faith, worship shrine, place of purity from goods derive
Now enclosed by voracious flames, bloodstained altar bier of insolent shame

"And they rushed in the twilight, set the fire to the walls,
And the night enlightened in a hellish glow
The moon reddened and spilled its grief on the winter sky"
