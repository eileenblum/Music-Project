Toot you horned ones
Begone the will of the son of man
Under the shadows of the primordial ones
Under the aegis of inner chaos

Mortals, undress of this woeful sarkis for the skin of hate
Forearm with arrogance, alter the fundamentals
Shapeless, willless beings with imprisoned souls
Which are struggling to the supernal

Descending disorder!

Insidious devises and envious words
Engrave a path of dinginess in blight
The legacy of serpent passes through generations
Sapping mankind

Crawling in the vapid existence
How formidable
Doomed to insignificance
Wondering of an awakening

(Agonizing life, striving spirit)

Beneath the surface, seethes
Timeless being breathes

Spite's disease
Kingdoms of malice and ill will

Smoldering ashes' heat
Underlying wit

Violet chrysanthemums turned gray
Timeless skies haze in fear and dismay

The blood of swans â salvation
Ransom is the martyrdom
Of those who chose sacrifice for the sublime
