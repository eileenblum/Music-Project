Rimes of dust and whirling wind
Of snowy mountains and fiery lust
Of singing birds and starful nights
Of dead flowers fallen on soil

Distance is decay
Lust enflamed
Hope not dead
Desolate pain

There, to cross the gates
Unworthy and disdained
Malevolent contempt
With a sense of gray

Leading in the shadows
Like a night shade
Disobedient
To follow the stars

Touched a fire red rose with quivering hands
Thorns penetrate this grayish skin
To hold the truth once, I long
In vanity extinguished the worst fears
