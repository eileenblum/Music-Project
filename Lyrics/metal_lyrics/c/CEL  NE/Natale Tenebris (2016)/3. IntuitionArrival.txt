Into the rain I sang
The tranquil ode of a summoning
A lighting torn the sky
Whose tears kept on falling

The shadows rose
An intuition upon the drenched land
Raindrops on my face and hands
I feel your presence around

Throw away
(I feel the power fading inside me)
Those cold days
(The stories of the past still haunt me)
Purge your pain
(My wounds, ill shades in moments of gray)
Live again
(To face the truth the price I must pay)

Into the rain I chanted
Into the storm I danced ritually
The blackened clouds above
Dropping life mercifully

Bells sound far
The strength of whispers in blowing wind
Misty mountain peaks fade dimmed
To your advent they lead

Throw away
(I feel the power fading inside me)
Those cold days
(The stories of the past still haunt me)
Purge your pain
(My wounds, ill shades in moments of gray)
Live again
(To face the truth the price I must pay)

Strange prowler
Travelling far
From your lands
What is it you seek
To hold
On your cold hands

Tremble and fear drove me off from my quest for life
Snugness of your words extorted my fate
From the winter's cold scythe

Sing along with me
This tranquil melody
Under the starful sky

Now alone no more
Engulfed in heat
Embraced now lift us to fly
