My words like carrier doves arise
To speak the words of troth
The elder shades above these lands
I feel stifling to throttle

The felony of our forbears
Their irreverence to life

Sin and corruption sovereignty
My consciousness remains shady
In dark veils of reflections

Like fertile rain on dried lands
Your virtuous words do sound
In ghastly dreams and hollow fields
My shady life goes round

Disharmony of our precursors' storyline

Behind the mask of the untruth
Lurks a sacrilegious old oath
On the soothe wings of time

Head to the pine trees
Follow my runaway
This path of snow will
Lead us too faraway
A frozen landscape
Sounds of a distant bell
And soughing leaves
Bidding us farewell

The longing shadows indicate sunlight can't hold
Before I step onto these lands again the mystery will unfold

The dusk is near
Embrace my fear

On this dim and murky grove
Now disoriented we rove
Closer come and hold me tight
Shivering to falling night

Fading rays of distant sun
Make this pale land look more wan
Keep your step, we're not alone
Heading into the unknown

On the wings of weaving time
In the misty freezing rime
Where unspoken dangers lurk
Silhouettes fading in the dark
