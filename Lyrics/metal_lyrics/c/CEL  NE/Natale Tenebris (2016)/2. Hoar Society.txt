Into the dark of the night
The raging storm
Drifting alone

Into the winter's cold heart
And freezing snow
Drifting alone

The blowing wind on tree tops howls
The ancient ode of north
Mist covered hostile land
Under a glacial sky

Eyesight is slightly getting dim
Fatigue is getting over

Lights far away are now shown
A distant town
Sighted ahead

Dwellers sly peasants they are
Slinky to their
Stories of hollow

Their gaze is cold and their touch wicked
To shadows they kowtow
Insisting to their gray fate
Ignoring the legends of past

To life the once shew no respect
By acts of ruthlessness and vice
This old odious secret abomination
Causing nocturnal screams and cries

There, nearby the ruins
Voices of the past still sing
As the wind still blows along with
This mournful song

(In debris and remains
Stories buried by the time
Embers deep in the woods
And untold truths)

Haunting presence
Auras enchanted
Nostalgic presage
Of bereavement

Blackened is their conscience from ghosts of old
Defiling the sanctuary with fire
Enraged still burning the last
To bury forever the past
