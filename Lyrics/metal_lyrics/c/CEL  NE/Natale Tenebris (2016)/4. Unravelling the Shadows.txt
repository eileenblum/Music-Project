In this realm of blind destruction
Through the endless edge of life
Lonesome wandering I ask for meaning
Yearning to look around

Sunset painting a rose sky
Cogitating my denies
On an attic shelf that dusty vellum
Waiting long just to be found

All this forgotten knowledge this generations' sin
That stealthy and unfairly had always been concealed
In filthy paths and lone hours all I had waited for
Was turned to ashes owing to hatred of human soul

Your own woe, for me to know, this grief, your lost dream
Wrecked in sinisterness of wicked irrevelants

The haunting presence of these lands the shades of discomfort
The wrongfulness of judging an existing life form
The spitting venom out of tongues, the fiery stony gaze
Exiled me into unlife this ghastly spectral maze

Forced decrees and blindfold words declined so obscene
Descend to tarnished acts, plainly I perceive

In withering fields, lucid dimensions nondescript
A never ending path, a malediction
A marred reality, upon descendants of the iniquitous ones
A gift to sign my doom

Dare you dismantle the past
Though you have earned my trust
For blind revenge this lust
What I ever had abruptly taken from me

Though this unusual rite
I faced your snuffing light
Now I conform what's right
Now you can see

Let the night's starlight lead you far from this disgrace
Keep your spirit safe away from this unholy place
Follow closely the pale signs try to deter the bane
By your descent innocence relieve my eternal pain!
