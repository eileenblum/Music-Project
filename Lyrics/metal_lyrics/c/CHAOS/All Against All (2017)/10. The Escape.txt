The flame that keeps you driven
The fuel you think is god given
To keep it burning, you pray
But does that keep me away?

The beginning you say is god sent
The shadow that's omnipresent
The unsettling truth that you dread
Is the same path that we tread

Heedless to the direction
I am your destination
Closer with every breath
The undeniable death

Your body withers away
Not to see another day
Remnants devoured upon
By vermin you're rambled on

Invisible trail of who you've been
Only to be felt and not seen
By those who once shared stage
Whose memories, forever I'll change

6 feet of dirt on the funeral pyre
All your sins consumed by fire
Hide your wrongs to praise a few
Deeds that's what left of you

Heedless to the direction
I am your destination
Closer with every breath
The undeniable death

Your body withers away
Not to see another day
Remnants devoured upon
By vermin you're rambled on
