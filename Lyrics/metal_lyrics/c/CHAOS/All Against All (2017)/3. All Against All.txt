The grand design has failed
Humanity derailed
Embrace the tragic fate
This legacy of hate

This war that you're in
For your land of origin
And the color of your skin
Is that what you're within?

Discrimination and segregation
A separation within the nation
Between us all, this hateful wall
Together we fall when it's all against all

The poison you spew
In the name of a few
Will kill the earnest part
Of what's close to your heart

Discrimination and segregation
A separation within the nation
Between us all, this hateful wall
Together we fall when it's all against all

All against
All against
All against
All against
All against
All against
All

Discrimination and segregation
A separation within the nation
Between us all, this hateful wall
Together we fall when it's all against all
