A thunderous hymn wakes the serene night
Sacrilegious demon take that spiteful flight
Confined to the shelter so dark and deep
Reverberates the lullaby for their final sleep

Suffocated souls await deliverance in peace
A false sense of surety puts their minds at ease
With scarred souls and wounded pride
They await a better day
Knowing not their last breaths's a few moments away

Propaganda masking reality
Aiding crimes against humanity
Remorseless acts of brutality
A dark stairway to immortality

The price that they pay for liquid gold
The feud that's a few decadent decades old
Scavengers of sorrow assemble for the feast
Countless lives sacrificed to feed the hungry beast

Pile of human body parts, a flaming testimony
To the trail of savagery, the tale of gluttony
A star spangled gift that's a grave beneath the stones
Epitaph for the worthless engraved in flesh and bones

Propaganda masking reality
Aiding crimes against humanity
Remorseless acts of brutality
A dark stairway to immortality

[Solo]

Propaganda masking reality
Aiding crimes against humanity
Remorseless acts of brutality
A dark stairway to immortality
