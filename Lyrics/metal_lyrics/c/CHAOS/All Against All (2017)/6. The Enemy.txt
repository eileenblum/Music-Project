The poison's injected
From birth as a virtue
All reasons rejected
To manipulate you

The straw-men who reign,
Their lifetime of toil
To keep your numb brain
Entangled in this coil

A fear driven corporation
The binding delusion
With guilt as its foundation
Repentance as solution

Your god is the enemy
The non existent entity
That breeds unseen ignorance

Your god is the enemy
Your faith is your weakness [4x]

[Solo]

Misguided youth, the answers are fake
The forbidden fruit, the apple, the snake
Contorted views comply to their plot
For that they'll confuse and crush all of your thoughts

Your god is the enemy
Your faith your weakness [4x]
