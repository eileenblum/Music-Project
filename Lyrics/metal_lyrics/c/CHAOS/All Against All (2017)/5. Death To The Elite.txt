It's time to burn the altar down
And kill the priests of ignorance
It's time to break the royal crown
In this last wave of defiance

It's time we paint the world red
With the blood of the shepherds of hate
March until the last is dead
And rewrite the race's fate

Merciless butchery
Blood splattered streets
Reward for the treachery
Death to the elite [2x]

Let the blood from their veins
Fuel this ruthless revolution
Let t cleanse all the stains
Of gluttony and corruption

Merciless butchery
Blood splattered streets
Reward for the treachery
Death to the elite [2x]

[Solo]

Merciless butchery
Blood splattered streets
Reward for the treachery
Death to the elite [2x]
