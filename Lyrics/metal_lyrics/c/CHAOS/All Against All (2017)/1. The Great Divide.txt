You've been told what to do
And you never ask them why
Fear is what's stopping you
From questioning the lie

Bound by fictitious rules
With a shaky root that rots
Driven blinded fools
And manipulated thoughts

Poisoned perception
Seeing things that are not there
The force that drives your every action
Is it the same everywhere?

Your fabricated reality
Your view of what's divine
Your standards of morality
They're not inline with mine

Blatant misinterpretation
Guiding you and the things you do
Scriptures of mass misdirection
The great divide that unites you

Guiding you and the things you do
