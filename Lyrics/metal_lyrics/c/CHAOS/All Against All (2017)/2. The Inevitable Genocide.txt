Right in front of your eyes
It's spreading like cancer
And herien the one question lies
To which I know the answer

The bloodshed is justified
That's a lesson we must learn
Inevitable genocide
Eurabia must burn

Contorted bloodied bodies, their last ballet
To the deafening gunshot as they fade away
Son of desperation entwined in their last breath
The beauty, the truth, the clarity that's death

Add fuel to the fire
That's what the media has done
They admire the daring liar
And detest the honest one

Initiate invasion
To keep your lies alive
This glorified domination
Your race will not survive

Contorted bloodied bodies, their last ballet
To the deafening gunshot as they fade away
Son of desperation entwined in their last breath
The beauty, the truth, the clarity that's death

[Solo]

Contorted bloodied bodies, their last ballet
To the deafening gunshot as they fade away
Son of desperation entwined in their last breath
The beauty, the truth, the clarity that's death
