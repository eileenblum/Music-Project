Awakened from a hollow slumber
Aimless thoughts amidst the pain
Turned into a random number
Haze of elixir drives me insane

I treat the unknown aisles of fear
Uncertain steps towards the light
Obscure silhouettes far and near
Of guinea pigs who's lost the fight

The ways of the wicked are seldom right
Possessed by it all, we forget our might
Chained to the roots we await our fate
Damned till death in this asylum of hate [2x]

Tormented by the sense of loss
Pursued by the hands of depravity
Far and wide are the rivers to cross
To embrace the realms of reality

Involuntarily summoned the unnamed
She planted the seeds of hope in me
Found the light, deliverance beckoned
I did find a way to set myself free

The ways of the wicked are seldom right
Possessed by it all, we forget our might
Chained to the roots we await our fate
Damned till death in this asylum of hate [2x]

Set my foot out to a new day
Amongst wealth driven machinery
Stuck in a rut, rusting away
In this dreaded unnerving scenery

[Solo]

From this slumber awakened again
Light's to bright for me to see
Hope of deliverance forever slain
Pursuing claws did catch up to me

The ways of the wicked are seldom right
Possessed by it all, we forget our might
Chained to the roots we await our fate
Damned till death in this asylum of hate [2x]
