Struggle to fit in
What's fictional? What's factual?
The question is a sin

The free mind is chained
To the rotten and old
Young hearts are trained
And cast into a mould

A crippling delusion
A forced disability
A lifelong illusion
Injected insanity [2x]

Carved out to follow the pack
From the cradle to the grave
Obsessing on what you lack
Unclear of what you crave

Formulated reasons for pain
Live in fear and die in vain
Teach the young to do the same

A crippling delusion
A forced disability
A lifelong illusion
Injected insanity [2x]

Put a leash on your thoughts
See the child in you die
They'll connect these dots
And feed you another lie

[Solo]

A crippling delusion
A forced disability
A lifelong illusion
Injected insanity [2x]
