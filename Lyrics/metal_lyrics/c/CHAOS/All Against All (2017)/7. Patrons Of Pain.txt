In their golden cage

Feed their vicarious greed

Hungry eyes that never close
Trading grief for fake applause
Yet another celebration
Corruption, murder, molestation

Watch these eyes recreate
Scenes of these less fortunate
The loss of who still remain
Being sucked down to the depths of pain

Visuals of sorrow
Dramatic narration
There's music to follow
The instant elation

Tears are true
And so are their loss
Forget not the few
Lines you shouldn't cross

Feed their vicarious greed

Hungry eyes that never close
Trading grief for fake applause
Yet another celebration
Corruption, murder, molestation

Watch these eyes recreate
Scenes of these less fortunate
The loss of who still remain
Being sucked down to the depths of pain

Hungry eyes that never close
Trading grief for fake applause
Yet another celebration
Corruption, murder, molestation

Watch these eyes recreate
Scenes of these less fortunate
The loss of who still remain
Being sucked down to the depths of pain
