Cornered in a god forsaken room
I stare at these walls in vain
Awaiting my imminent doom
Amidst this flood tide of pain

Iâll be forced to witness
You behead another one of us
Hear me scream, you wont see me cry
As you drive that rod into my eyes

Prisoners of War
From near and far
Waiting for the end
Waiting for the end

Expend your bloody hate
Behind these closed doors
I am for my state
What you are for yours

Crescendo of the echoes
Transform to a silhouette of fear
The right of life denied
I feel the end is near

Prisoners of War
From Near and Far
Waiting for the end
Waiting for the end
