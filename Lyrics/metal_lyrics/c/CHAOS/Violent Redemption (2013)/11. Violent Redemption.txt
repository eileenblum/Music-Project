The wall of will casts a shadow on you
Your pride gives way for pain
Your anguished scream slices through
Iâm proud of being insane

Your blood on my fist, Makes it fade away
Memories evolve,
Feasting upon your swollen dismay
The raging storm dissolves

From your misery Iâm saving you
Forever to be forgotten
Rid your mind of those tales untrue
And all thatâs dead and rotten

The moment is gone, the feeling lives on
Replaying itself again
For years to come and those remain
The scars of the deed remain
