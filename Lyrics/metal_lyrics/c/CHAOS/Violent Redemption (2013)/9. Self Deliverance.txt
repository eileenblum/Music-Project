Donât turn your head, the other way
Open your eyes and Iâm sure youâll see
Your suffering, it ends today
Forget the pain, Iâll set you free

As tears of joy, rolls down your face
I hear a cry outside
Final moment, of your disgrace
In a needle to the other side

Theyâll never forget it
Theyâll never deny it
Theyâll never regret it
Prescription for your exit

They pretend to mourn your death
With their fake unconvincing tears
I'll guide you to, your last breath
This is the end of all your fears

Theyâll never forget it
Theyâll never deny it
Theyâll never regret it
Prescription for your exit
