Iâll die not for your sins but mine
Shadow your judgment with holy wine
Find Solace and salvation in pain
Give me the chance Iâll do it again

I am they lord
Iâll lay my vengeance upon thee [4x]

Now for your sins, thou shall bleed
From these bloodied shackles youâll all be freed
With all your lives, youâll pay the price
For this is the last time the son will rise

I am thy lord
Iâll lay my vengeance upon thee [4x]
