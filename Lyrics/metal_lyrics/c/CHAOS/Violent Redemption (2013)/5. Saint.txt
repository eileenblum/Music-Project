Blessings from a blood stained hand
Cry of the dead in the prayers he chant
Stench of sorrow fills the sacred place
Fake divinity masks the devilâs face

Widowâs curse her childrenâs screams
Another one for his selfish deeds
Cause of countless broken dreams
In their grief this demon feeds

LUST
GREED
WRATH
Does it make you bigger than god??

Stroll down wretched path
Unleashing endless wicked wrath
drowning in a sea of sin
Setting free, the demon within

LUST
GREED
WRATH
Does it make you bigger than God!

Pure evil signs of decadence
Unholy wrath of arrogance
Unspoken pain and misery
His ecstasy
