Graveyard for your bleeding mind
The place where dreams are left behind
The land where sanityâs for sale
And here the filthy rich they never fail

Pampered pests crawl on the throne
Days of courage so long gone
Power hungry, sells their pride
And the rightful, are denied

Game for the few, Where the game plays you

Slaves for the dirty deed
Pillage while your people bleed
Powered by unending greed
Marches on this wretched breed

Game for the few, Where the game plays you
