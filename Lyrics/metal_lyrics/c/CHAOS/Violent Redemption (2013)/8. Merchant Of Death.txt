Rivers of Blood, Divides the land
Into shades of green and saffron
Genocide under the headâs command
Sow blood seeds of religion

Either youâre dead or youâre one of us
Thatâs what the lawmaker said
Climb upon the hill of corpses
With the unborn on your spearhead

Three days of slaughter
Three days of slaughter
Three days of slaughter
Endowed by the merchant of death

Stench of Burning Flesh seeps through
Fueling their urge to kill
Stringed puppets dancing
To their masterâs deadly will

Kill

Three days of Slaughter
Three days of slaughter
Three days of slaughter
Endowed by the merchant of death
