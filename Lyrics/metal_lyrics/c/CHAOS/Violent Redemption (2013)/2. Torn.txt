Scarred by the lines drawn
Their fateâs been sealed
Intruders, long gone
Wounds are still unhealed

Pollute their tradition
Infect their each thought
Now hand them the ammunition
To carry out your plot

Racial Mutilation
Territorial Annihilation
Communal Extermination
Hostility swallows the nation 

Death Trains bearing corpses
Speed on bloodied Rails
Misery surrounds us
And Disarray prevails

Pollute their tradition
Infect their each thought
Now hand them ammunition
And carry out your plot

Racial Mutilation
Territorial Annihilation
Communal Extermination
Hostility swallows the nation
