Wakes up to the smell of blood
The mother, widow proud to be one
Answering the call of dead
To celebrate the death of her son

Gunshot ridden lullabies
For a better afterlife
Itâs the infantâs destiny
In a country torn by strife

Innocence slayed on the streets
Pay homage to your own beliefs
Born and raised amidst deceits
Blinded from the sea of grief

Delusive sight of dignity
Slaughtered in the name of god
Praising damned insanity
Blame it on your mighty lord

I dream of Godâs kingdom
As I take my last breath
Predatory martyrdom
As I heed to the gods of death
