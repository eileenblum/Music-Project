Revelations engulfed my soul and mesmerized my empty flesh
Euphoria washed out over me and I knew that is was no hallucination
It became clear, the way He revealed before my eyes
That life was but a moment to choose
The Truth of empty lies
But I knew
A thousand deaths I would suffer to serve no longer as a slave
A thousand deaths I would drudge with thunder and vice
Through this void revelation
Let my eyes bleed out all sight
I denounce all that I have ever know
I denounce the "truths" that have only been phantoms
Be it above, so be it below
Let this flesh become ash
My soul seeps to the netherworld, through grounds of rotting strife
I sacrifice my every drop of blood to Him who has no past
I sacrifice my every vein to Him, the One without death and the one Without life
Satan, Salvation to those who have followed Your words
Let me rid of this empty life, and be rid of this putrid delight
Satan, Light for those who seek the Truth
May there be no more upheaval through the womb of life
Let my eyes bleed out all sight
I denounce all that I have ever know
I denounce the "truths" that have only been phantoms
Be it above, so be it below
Revelations engulfed my soul and mesmerized my empty flesh
Euphoria washed out over me and I knew that is was no hallucination
It became clear, the way He revealed before my eyes
That life was but a moment to choose
