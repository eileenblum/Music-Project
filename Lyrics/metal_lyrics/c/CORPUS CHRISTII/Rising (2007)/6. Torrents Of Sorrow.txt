Relentless sorrow - slowly eaten alive
Thoroughly it gnaws at me every night
Pushed bit by bit closer to the edge
Revealing new ways to rise
As my stagnant frozen heart
In the pale firmament above
Torments and breaks me leisurely... precisely
Exhuberant void - humanity's gift
Empty feelings drive to futile deeds
Replaced with abhorrence - bleak despair given
Driven towards staggering deeds and vices against humanity
Relief found in sadistic exultation
Debaucheries and atrocities complete
Effortlessly flowing red rivers
States a feeling of comfort and release
Relentless sorrow masticates me nightly
Voids and lecheries gnaw at me every day
Momentous cries in addition
As I die to rise
As my stagnant frozen heart
In the pale firmament above
Torments and breaks me leisurely... precisely
