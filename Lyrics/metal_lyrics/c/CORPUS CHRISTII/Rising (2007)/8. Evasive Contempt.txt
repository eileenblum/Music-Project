Desert dry sympathy
Black eyes lacking empathy
As life flooded out through the thin threads
The self talking through the surface reflection of the damned
Hard captured death
Forcing the blood from shattered veins
The multi faceted choices of torture
Regret has no home here
Scorn, turned away looks and betrayal
Escaping what was once here
Yet power held over her blood
Solely pleasure shed on flesh
Shaded thoughts
But sharp shadows revealing their true nature
Kneeling face down for fleshy deliverance
Asking to leave... breath dagged out Stepped on to my own display
Evasive Contempt
Desert dry sympathy
Black eyes lacking empathy
As life flooded out through the thin threads
Hard captured death
Forcing the blood from shattered veins
The multi faceted choices of torture
Regret has no home here
