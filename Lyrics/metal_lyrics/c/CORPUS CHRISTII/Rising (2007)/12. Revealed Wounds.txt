Unveiled, the horrors within taking over
A new part of me revealed
Conquering virtue, painting over plainless with perversion
Killing me slowly... rebirth in it's bittersweet taste
Some things best left secret... some things better be chained
But I can no longer veil these inner demons...
I can no longer hide truth in chains of despair
Tonight I go on the prowl...
They see a shy soul
But they do not know what rips me apart
They cannot see the pain unveiled
Truth yet to unfold
Aching to unleash... longing to split open wide
I cannot fake another day
To feel alive, to feel the twinge of agony
To see Satan in the mirror of time...
