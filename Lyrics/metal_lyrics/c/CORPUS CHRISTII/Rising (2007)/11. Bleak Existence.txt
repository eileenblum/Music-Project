Corroded blades draw the fire of night
For a perished existence to a vortex of magnificence
No pleasure greater, no circumstance more dire
For now He lives through me
Underneath this flesh lies a broken man
Splitting the will of secret angels
Building bridges to other paradoxes
Swallowing Thy serpent semen
Corrupting for the God above, God below
With a heart who will see no hope nor love
Chains keeping talisman restrained
Making the dusk as eternal this man's fate
This bleak existence
The path, clearly revealed His essence of revelations unfold
From glorious white lines
To the unbearable shame of Man
SATAN SATAN SATAN
