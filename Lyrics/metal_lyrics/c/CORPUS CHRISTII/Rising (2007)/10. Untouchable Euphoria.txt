Sympathy is wrought only by pain
Sweet agonies manifest in sultry screams
Blood like poison runs, flooding pale skin
Gleaming in the moonlight, glowing in seclusion
Bestial lust shaped from wounds
Cheap thrills as sharp as the razor
Shrieks as endless as the crimson drawn
She bleeds for me... she bleeds for my heart
Picking her skin, peeling her apart
I strive for the excellence of torture
I strive for that perfect scream
Untouchable euphoria
That will heal my heart... that will dissolve my suffering!
Bestial lust shaped from wounds
Cheap thrills as sharp as the razor
Shrieks as endless as the crimson drawn
She bleeds for me... she bleeds for my heart
Picking her skin, peeling her apart
