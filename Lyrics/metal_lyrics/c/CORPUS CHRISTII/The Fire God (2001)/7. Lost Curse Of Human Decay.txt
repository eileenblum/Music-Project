When Tthe humans were created
The almighty God failed
When God tought he controlled things
Master Satan was pulling the strings
We were created to build perfection
To build earthly paradise
But we have minds, we do what we want
No God's will control our thoughts
Satan's children will dismember
Will torture the human kind
Doomed by the night
Earth is destined to die by human hands
By the serpent's smile
Most seeming virtue
By delight of others pain
We will fall in Hell
It does not matter how small are your sins
You will be away from the light
Forever lost paradise
Our kingdom shall be disease
