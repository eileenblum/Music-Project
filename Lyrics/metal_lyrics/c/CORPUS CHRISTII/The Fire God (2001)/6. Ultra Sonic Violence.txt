Among the shadows of domain
I fell the powers flowing in my veins
Your blood falling in the ground
The axe is opening your brain
Cutting you all in pieces
I drift through the dreams
A savage animal has awaken
To glorify the day of blackness
I've found th stairways to Hell
A dark unknown dimension
To be the one to control the departures
I've discovered the words of night
Humans nature decay
Into damnation all we fall
Destruction's our second name
Violence is our way
You are falling into black silent slumber
But you still fell your wounds
Through coldness the soul fly
Your brain is open
But I know you're still seeing me
