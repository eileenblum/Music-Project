By the light of the fullmoon
We embrace the shadows
By the fire of Hatred
We torture the Light/We conquer the world
the calling of redemption
The future of worms
By night we conquer
The Heaven's our playground
Master Fire
The Fire God
People Dying
You play with their souls
Humans lay down and fall asleep
Forever you will obey
You will serve the Fire God
Ruller of Life and Death
The rise of the flaming impiety
The grotesque life of us all
