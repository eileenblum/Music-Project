Conspiracy! Reflex of within
I see the future in icy abyss
Monstrosity! Reflex of within
Dark winds fade the silent obey
I here by sentence you all to die
Regarding your thoughts
No more freezing lies
No more damnations
I am tired of all little humans
Trying to be known
And being regarded
By their impious Acts
Die die decayed people
You are nothing but shades of Hope
In clouds above I see you all waiting
To be seen by the eye of all light
