Iâm a slave of my pain
Iâm the abomination
Iâm the wanderer
Iâm the reaper

I have risen from the dead
Thousands of years I have fought
Enslaved in darkness I lie
Blood of Christ on my hands

Torches light the realm
Of pain and pride
Horror to the mortals
Creatures of destruction

Long ago I have dreamt
Of a new dark age
Now itâs happen
This is the time

Forces of darkness they rise
From the abyssic hell
Now itâs happen

The dark clouds have come
The angels are being raped
Soon day will be night
Children of darkness kill
