I watch the lakes of beautiful melancholy
Glorious is the day of their birth
Ancient trees of noble strength
Honoured by thy force
Old caves of sacrifice
Forever theyâll be worshipped

Castle of torture be our reign
For your walls have our blood

Your strength made followers
That will kill in your name

Triumphant is your heart
Once more standing proud
Your dark is the essence of my soul

A lot didnât resist you
Of your pagan existence
You made us proud
And forever we will kill for you
