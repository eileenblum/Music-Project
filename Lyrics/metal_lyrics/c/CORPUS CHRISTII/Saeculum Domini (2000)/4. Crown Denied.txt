Cut off your head with an axe
A long time I wanted this to happen
All I wanted was for you to die
This is the best moment of my life

Your life had no meaning
You were so miserable
Together we defeated you
You and your pathetic lambs
They believed in your lies
That made them meaningless

Now that you are gone
It made us free
Free from your lies
And your stupidity
