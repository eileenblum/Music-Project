Black candles burn
In the halls of blood
You are doom of returning to hell

The inverted cross
Of the unholy king
Is starting to rise burning

The flames of hell
Burn the angels
They fall down
At his feet

The pentagram
Light us the way
To blasphemy

The whitest snow
Full of blood
Is at my feet

The virginâs blood
So pure
