Forever âhisâ name is truth
Rising to the stars he prevails
Crushing their minds with fear
âHisâ honour is sin

I am one of âhisâ sons,
Satan lord take my soul
I give you this sacrifice,
Satan lord take my soul
In my heart the flame burns,
Satan lord take my soul
Ave Domini Satanas

Bring us pain great spirit
Strangely we await
Going towards eternity
He dwells within the flame

To the stars we rise
To face the lie
I will be with him
Right at âhisâ side

I have given my soul
To Satan lord
I will suffer the pain
For this is the game
