Listen to me you stupid freak
You must die for your sins
Ages ago you came here
And for what? To be loved

So much time we endured
We must be fuckinâ saints
So much time we endured

We must be just
Some freaking whores
We must be just a piece of shit

Come on you bastard
Get on your knees
Look at the pentagram
Shinning so bright
Forever enslaved forever might
Put your tongue out
And lick the goat horn
