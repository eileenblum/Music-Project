Broken bones protrude through my flesh, as blood soaks my skin
With every breath I die a little more
As life drips from my wounds death consumes me in all its glory,
And coldly invites me in
I cannot see any longer, I cannot taste, I know I shall be ash soon
Torturing myself in my private hell, I fear pain no more
Cutting myself to the bone,
I feel pleasure through my affliction I desire to hurt others,
So I won't have to feel anymore
I long to make others feel the pain that is my addiction
Melting flesh rotting from my bones, I can rest at last
I have hundreds of corpses rotting around me
My throat is closing up and my life should now be past
Forsaken, I will not rest alone in misery
