The blood that runs through my veins is rotten and hollow
My suffering is the only thing that drives my lifeless body
I witness my old life fading away, decaying in the dust of time
No one will come to save me, no mercy will I ever know
My eyes bleed sorrow, my heart seeps blackened decay
I am dying more every day, every painful second of this cursed life
I wait for the darkness to consume me in it's essence
My only hope for salvation -
I cannot bare another moment of this pain
Writhing in the sickness of the world, the vermin and ailments that bleed forth
I do not wish for a better tomorrow - I wish for the death of me
