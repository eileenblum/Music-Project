My burden is more than I can bare
This suffering has stripped me to the bone
Shacking in utter pain, at death I have stared
My aching soul can't ache anymore
The countless years I have lived have brought me nothing
The only gift I have ever received is a lifetime of suffering
I cannot let another day pass to torture me further
I slit my throat with broken fervor
The weight of my pain could collapse me
This deadening depression eats me whole
Pulsating agony has forever trapped me
My soul just can't take it anymore
The driving minutes pass so slowly with dread
The only comfort of mine is the surrounding death
I just can't bare my burden any longer
I just can't conjure the will to be stronger
My burden is more than I can bare
This suffering has stripped me to the bone
Shaking in utter pain, at death I have stared
My aching soul just can't ache anymore...
