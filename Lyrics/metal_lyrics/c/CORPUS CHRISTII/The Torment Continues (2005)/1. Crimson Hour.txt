I lied in pain, in a dying state and unrest My life trying to escape me,
My body begging... for death
I took that long blade and took a deep breath
I then sliced myself from my hip to my chest
This is the very end of my cries None shall mourn for my demise This is the end and I shall not rise My death is approaching with surmise
I will die with a smile upon my face Awaiting the glory of death's embrace This life is nothing more than a mistake This life I regret with a most raging blaze
I closed my eyes and let it take me away
I'm dislocated from my horrors and pain
I felt death come and give me an embrace
And then I accepted my death and accepted my fate
I lied there dying and bleeding in my bed
My life escaping me and so close to death
I licked the blood from the blade that stole my last breath
And I died with no pain... ...and no regret
