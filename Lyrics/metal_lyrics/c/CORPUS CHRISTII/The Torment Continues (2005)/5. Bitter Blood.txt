I raped the souls of the pure &amp; holy
I embrace their cries so melancholy
I stand before a dying civilization
As I gazed upon pure desolation
Standing upon crumbled dreams, I thought
Wondering if only sooner I could have made this world rot
Kneeling down to the distorted faces of beasts so vile
I licked the blood from the cunt of humanity defiled!
A sense of euphoria enshrouded me I embraced my tears of strife so melancholy
I stood to my feet &amp; let a river of blood take me away
Leaving the endless bodies in slaughtered disarray
I kneel before my master, I have served him well indeed
I took a last breath and my mortality withers into nothing
Endless drops of blood anoint me I embraced the ecstasy so melancholy
