I have no restraint, not a shred of sympathy
This blood that runs through my veins is cold with hatred Sorrow is long behind me,
I feel nothing
Drunken on pure disgust for humanity and all of its flaws
Not a worthy face in the streets of slums
Not a worthy name to roam this century
I vow to kill them all in utter disregard
Blanketing them with my corruption
I have no hope for this scum we call ~ humanity
I have no sense of love or empathy Petty feelings are long behind me in a pile of dust
The blood that covers the land around me, the bodies I have killed out of lust
The empire has long fallen, dead with its ancient ways
I have nothing good left inside of me
I want to see them all slaughtered like the cheap meat they are
I want to see them all tortured for centuries
