Silence
You requested silence to proceed your quest
But here only gluttons feed off your limbs

A golden mind has sent you,
Watching the bewitched creature
Representing the One
Who abandoned pity and demise

We walk beside your tracks, all stealth
Withdrawn from the focus of Man
Saying they know your name
But hardly know your true image

Seeing your footsteps wash away in the sand
Where you wrote the permanent path
On existence

For the sake of freedom, we crawl
To be given oblivion
Slowly drawn
From your constricted light

Representing the One who abandoned
Pity and demise

Deliverer of light
Lucifer's despite
Deliverer of light
Lucifer!
