Praised be Thy realm
Bringer of Inversion
Consumed by your everlasting journey
With no reason to look back

Be dark Thy light

Mercury of the wise
Extract the spiritual seeds
White turned to gold,
And blackest of all the leaves
Through which you speak to us

Illusions through these tools
True change through our own minds
Enlightenment misinterpreted
Black flames of vision

The wide-open mouth of the One
With silver teeth
And the One breathing scents of death
Wearing tainted golden scales
Be dark thy light, or none at all
Be glorious consummation

Illusions through these tools
True change through our own minds
Enlightenment misinterpreted
Black flames of vision

Flickering behind in the mirror
When we focus on the surface reflection
Sucked into a vortex of absence
When we bring forth our own personal Hell
