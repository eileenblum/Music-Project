Pressed against the glass
Breathing fog on thin ice
Trying to look out
And see what dwells beyond

Faint shadows of what you try to be
But still many thousands of times
More than you can perceive

Holographic image spews out
Its fire vibrations
Breathing dust and glowing ashes,
From what once, was you

Crystal glaze foundation

Deathlike wish for knowledge
Hybris crushed, destroyed
Control to what stands, above
No longer able to shatter each other
We drain ourselves

Terror-balance to manage survival
Eyes open the wrong way
When the tidal-wave builds up it's essence
We stare blindly in the other direction
