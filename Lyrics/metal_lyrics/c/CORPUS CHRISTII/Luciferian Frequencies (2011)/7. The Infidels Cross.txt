Reclaiming homes lost
For thousands of years
Written into history,
Events forever left to the old,
Since the bringer of it was
To the sacrificed

Story recorded by the conquerors,
But you worked this out behind the scenes

Hiding behind masks
The new reign is spreading

Martyr-like features,
Crucifying themselves,
Through simple open play
But the general audience
Swallows and swallows
Again, and over again

Threads through their limbs,
Saints and angels guide them
No more freely than is captured in oil
The painter re-draws the self-portrait

Story recorded by the conquerors,
But you worked this out behind the scenes

The infidel laugh back at them
Now he shows His true self
