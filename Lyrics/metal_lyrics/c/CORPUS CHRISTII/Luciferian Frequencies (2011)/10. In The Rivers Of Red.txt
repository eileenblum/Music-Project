Vermin
Spreading like a plague
Not so brilliant procreating
Mere drought and deprivation

Covered with masks
Protecting from your filthy fluids
That seep through dried out fields
Bleeding landscape through the chemicals

Nothing shall prosper here
Nothing shall grow again

Demolished solutions
Keeping feuds alive
For the sake of man
Breathing and drinking from the rest

Spiritual cleansing of the surface
Returning to the source
And leaving nothing behind
Vermin, vermin, vermin

Covered with masks
Protecting from your filthy fluids
That seep through dried out fields
Bleeding landscape through the chemicals

Food for the mind
Only offered to the chosen
Cold they draw what they can from you
You have been excluded...
