Fumbling around in darkness
Unable to separate
The walls breathe
Walls smell of all of you

Smell of what you transformed into
But you live in my mind
Turned by the alchemist lies
Producer of false legends

Where I built the walls out of body parts
The same as many years past
Falling back into psychosis
Since that's all I know
Dismembered

It's all that's real
It pulls away
And I fall awaiting for the bottom

Breathing walls keep me warm
And condemn me for what I have done
As I fade away...

Blood vessels open
A chalice filled with vinegar

And the oil slowly turning matte
Purifying the skin
With rotting perfumes
And the offerings, those are left behind
