Expressionless and killing your fate
Endless strive in water
The vessel of the souls
Preserves the stories of old

Carrying back and forth
With no question of time or destination
The innocent bleed from their eyes
And nothing has meaning anymore

They grieve over knowledge lost to this world
See their work fall into the possessed
Symbols once obvious
Now looked upon with scorn
In search for enlightenment too worldly

Cycles stretched out of blind lines
Torture no longer disconnects you from flesh
And they give of what they once owned
Still no longer they can grasp
For these soulless beings

Expressionless and killing your fate
Endless strive in water
The vessel of the souls
Preserves the stories of old

Carrying back and forth
With no question of time or destination
The innocent bleed from their eyes
And nothing has meaning anymore

The Styx reflection

They grieve over knowledge lost to this world
See their work fall into the possessed
Symbols once obvious
Now looked upon with scorn
In search for enlightenment too worldly

No longer they perceive
This making here
