I awoke from a disturbed sleep, dead whores dancing in the walls
I looked into a blackened mirror and it was not me I saw
My destiny was sorrow, my plan was to kill
And hatred it came from nowhere with a need to fulfilled

Among the streets I roamed, with a burning pang
My blood boiled with a mast provoking flame
I found myself in her coppery blood, and I almost felt alright
Bu then it came back, my bloodlust, my loathsome appetite

Under the blackened sky I awoke from a sleep
And what I saw in the mirror it was no longer me
My destiny was sorrow, my fate was to kill
And hatred slipped in with a need to be fulfilled

I should've been dead, I was but still alive
Walking among these endless streets to make others die
From my death I arose anew to bring a message of sorrow
A force to room in agony, to live again tomorrow
