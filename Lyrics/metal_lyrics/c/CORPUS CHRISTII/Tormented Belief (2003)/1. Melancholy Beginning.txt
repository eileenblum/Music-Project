My suffering is my only possession
Pain, my lover, cruelty, my master
Your flesh, my loyal obsession
Your pain, my salvation I'm after

The evening moon witnesses all
From my gutted stomach to my bashed head
Pleasure shall be my downfall
And agony, my glorious death

My suffering is all I have left over
Pain, my only friend
Your flesh, my rotten lover
Your pain, my final end

The morning sun sees all
From the shredded skin to my broken bones
Pleasure shall be my downfall
And agony, my comforting home
