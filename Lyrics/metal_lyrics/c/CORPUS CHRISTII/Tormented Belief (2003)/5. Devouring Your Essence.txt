Your blood brought comfort, and a grin came over me
It has been so long since I have been truly free
But your demise brought with it a new life
Devouring your essence, I shall die another night

So close to my death, I must keep slaying
For who knows how long, death it would not take me
I grin at the thought of final peace and death
Devouring your essence so I can finally rest

You may be the last, there seems to be no conclusion
And you meant nothing to me, you are nothing but an illusion

I have blood in my eyes, and a wound that won't heal
I have a knife in my hand and nothing could make me feel

Freedom must be near, for I have waited a long time
Centuries have passed, and I want what is mine
I must kill again

Devouring your essence I must meet my death
The misery of life haunts me, and I have nothing left
I must kill again!
