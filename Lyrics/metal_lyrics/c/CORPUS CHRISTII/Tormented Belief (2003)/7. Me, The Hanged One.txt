[Vinyl Bonus Track]My sickly soul has retrieved its rest
On this scaffold of bonded death
Me, the hanged one put out of my own anguish
By a cheated death and superstitious men
My corrupted life has found its end
With a noose around my neck
My ailing mind has waned
Thoughts now faded splitting shards of pain
My soul cast away, my body hangs
It is I who lies hated, I who lies slain
Death found me on this glorious day
But peace did not find me or my hate
My feverish body has ceased
No feelings left inside of me
My thoughts burnt aside with a wicked laugh
A struggle with death and ferocious gash
Me, the hanged one upon this platform
Eyes burnt from the sun, everything inside me torn
I in the end who is hung and forlorn
Death did not take me away, but left me alone
Me, the hanged one not yet dead, not yet born
