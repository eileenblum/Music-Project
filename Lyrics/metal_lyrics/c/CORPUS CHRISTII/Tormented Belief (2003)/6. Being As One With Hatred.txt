I have found true happiness in malice and scorn
I think I can live like this, murdering and so forlorn
My joy it comes from others suffering and blight
Perpetual blood on my hands and in my eyes, eternal night
Prophecy or not, this is my chosen existence
I shall kill tomorrow, no regret or resistance
I have found my peace in this life of ruin
And I am ready to kill again soon

My hate feeds and drives my damned soul
My hate is my bridge and I have paid my toll
At last I have found peace and tranquility
Through this hatred that shows no civility
My anger and rage have guided me to bliss
With a dead whore's dance and a serpent's kiss

I am one now with my own hate
I am one with this chosen fate
I walk with joy, these eternal nights
Stalking my prey with a insatiable appetite
Blood stained upon my skin and the moon in my eyes
So close to life and so far from my demise
