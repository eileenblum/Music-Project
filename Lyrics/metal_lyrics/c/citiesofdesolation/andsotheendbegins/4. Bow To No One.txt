[Chorus:]
How the fuck do you survive
Kiss the ground of where he strides
You believe in false prophets
Do you think he'll pay your debts
Praise the god that let you die
He who left you paralyzed
Don't spend your life on your knees
Stand the fuck up and be free

Living like lambs to the slaughter
Day by day in your mundane life
Walking blindly under control
Puppet masters pulling your strings
Feel them choke the life out of you
An eternal suffocation
Feel them choke the life out of you
An eternal suffocation

[Chorus]

STAND AND BE FREE

Stand and get the fuck up and reclaim the life you've lost
And you'll see you don't live on your knees bowing to a false god
Now open your eyes and see that your life's not wasted
Now follow me and see, understand, I will bow to no one
Don't be blind, hear the lies and break these chains that bind you
How can you believe in this blind faith for a god you've not seen.
