This infernal plague of mankind now has taken its final steps
So long have we walked on this path sealing our fate for destruction
This infernal plague of mankind now has taken its final steps
So long have we walked on this path sealing our fate for destruction

What have we done to ourselves
There's no way to undo this
So long have we killed ourselves
Forever's not long enough
To help clear all of our faults
And as we take our last steps
We regret all our choices
Rot(ing) in hell eternally

Fucking filth walks this earth claiming lives, thinking they're in control
Controlling a wasteland is nothing that you should be proud of
Stench of death, rotted flesh, and disease now covers our homeland
Lives are torn, family's dead, all is lost, this is everyone's fault

How the hell were we so blind
We didn't open our eyes
We believed in all the lies
And now its time we face our judgement
And as we cruised on that fine line
And living for the last time
We sparked the end of mankind
The ending of a human fucking plague
What have we done to ourselves
There's no way to undo this
So long have we killed ourselves
And now its time we paid for our mistakes
