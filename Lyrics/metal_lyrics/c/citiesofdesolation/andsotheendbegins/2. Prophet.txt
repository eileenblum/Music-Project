Bow before you god
Forever, not even long enough, to cover your rap sheet, for all your fucking crimes against man
They believed, all that you had to say, and all you claim to know, worshiping a false god, lead astray

[Chorus:]
Hell has come for us, because of our faith, we believed in you, our holy prophet
Lying day by day, persuading your way, thanks to you our fate, eternal suffering

Serpents tongue, its spitting blasphemy, to your believers ears, your speeches shrouded in, deadly sins
We followed, all that you had to say, without a second thought, or even question of, and now this

[Chorus]

Lead us to hell

We will burn eternally
For our faith trusted in you
You promised all we wanted
Knowing you won't deliver
Now we cross the river Styx
Now we're trapped ever burning
In this hell we created
Believing a false prophet
