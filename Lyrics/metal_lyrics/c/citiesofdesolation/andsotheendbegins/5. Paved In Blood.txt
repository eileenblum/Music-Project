Sacrifice all you have, you give us our freedom
What have we given back to say thanks for your gift

Gave up all when you enlisted, thought it was for the best
Serve your country next to the best, hold your ground like the rest
This is what you're signed up for, don't give up no regrets
Persevere and you will conquer, don't cave to anything.

[Chorus:]
Paved in blood, genocide, holocaust, sacrifice
Paved in blood, genocide, holocaust, sacrifice

You're willing to give up your life for people you never know
All those fuckers take for granted watching the best TV shows
And in the end no one will know those who died in this struggle
But some of us actually know what you gave to us back home

[Chorus]

Pray for genocide
Feed the holocaust
Pray for genocide
Feed the holocaust

Sacrificed all you had for freedom
Paved in blood, genocide, holocaust
