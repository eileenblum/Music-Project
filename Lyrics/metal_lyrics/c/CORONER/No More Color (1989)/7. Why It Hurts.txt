Lonely it spreads its wings
Eager to wake my fire
Slowly circling over me
Burning with deep desire

I don't know why it hurts
What the hell is it all about

When I lie awake at night
I feel it all 'round me
Winding like the snake of old
It's foul breath all about me

I don't know why it hurts
What the hell is it all about

It fills my head with words
But when I want to speak
I don't know what to say

I feel like shattered glass
Is cutting at my very heart
I long for it with every nerve
It's tearing me apart

I don't know why it is
What the hell is it all about
