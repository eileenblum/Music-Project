Glowing heat, horizon swims
Wall-less labyrinth
Grace and ugliness, combined like never before
It's hell on earth, desert law

Where water means gold

Burning breath, deadly games
Two colored world of disgrace

Where water means gold

Mistress of deception
Daughter of death
Realm of the sun
Merciless, invincible

Glowing heat, horizon swims
Wall-less labyrinth
Storm, culmination of her wildness
Swallows every trace for eternity
