Darkness covers the place we live,
And children ask for reasons why.
When acid rainburns your skin to shreds,
And children die with open eyes.

Disfigured faces, bleeding disease.
Mutilated bodies - sill alive or almost dead.

Time to realize what they've done to us.
It makes no sense to protect yourself.

Disfigured faces, bleeding disease.
Mutilated bodies - sill alive or almost dead.

Chemical holocaust, invisible death.
Destruction as far as you can see.
** ** ** ** die right off.
Breathing deep, killing death winds.

Nuclear fall-out, comes down like snow.
And the radiation begins to kill.
When the whole history of this planet,
Seems to be forgotten.
