The time will come
When they'll be back
To hunt for your life
An aggressive attack
Almost down on you
Unknown death
Waiting for your
Destruction and death

They've been waiting for years
Years bound with hate
They've been waiting to see again
They kill with power and force

Watch marching clowns
They'll press you down
Now leaves you there crying for help
Almost endangered you are selected
All you feel is the wings of death

They've been waiting for years
Years bound with hate
They've been waiting to see again
They kill with power and force

Reborn through hate!
We'll slash your necks until you die
Reborn through hate!
Commands that the death shall rot your life
[2x]

[Solo]

Reborn through hate!
We'll slash your necks until you die
Reborn through hate!
Commands that the death shall rot your life
[2x]

So drag them down
Down in their graves
Cover you with wet mulched dirt
Now you lay there dead and done
Forever done with time to sleep

The time will come
When they'll be back
To hunt for your life
An aggressive attack
Almost down on you
Unknown death
Waiting for your
Destruction and death

They've been waiting for years
Years aligned with hate
They've been waiting to see again
They kill with power and force

Watch marching clowns
They'll press you down
Now leaves you there crying for help
Almost endangered you are selected
All you will feel is the wings of death

They've been waiting for years
Years of venomous hate
They've been waiting to see again
They kill with power and force

Reborn through hate!
We'll slash your necks until you die
Reborn through hate!
Commands that the death shall rot your life
[2x]
