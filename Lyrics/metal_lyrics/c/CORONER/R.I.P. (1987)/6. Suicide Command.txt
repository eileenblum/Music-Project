Now I'm up,ready to die
** ** ** ** ** **
Gun in my heart, death in my brain
My home is death, is now.

Killing and dying ** ** is **
The old death's gone, die.
My stake is high, the price to die
The one way ticket to Hell.

Hunting, seeking, finding, destroying - die.
Praying, pleading, cannot wait - for death. [2X]

[solo]

Again [2X]

[solo]

There's no return,
"he snakes inside"
I'm racing as fast as I can.
The sun's on my back,
And death's in front.
Sweat on my forehead's - burnin'

The moment is right, to go down and die,
And make a request for my heart.
Waiting for it, deliverance is here.
See you in Hell my friend.

Hunting, seeking, finding, destroying, die.
Praying, pleading, cannot wait for death. [2X]
