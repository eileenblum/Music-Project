Falling down, entering no-where,
Between our world and the realm of death.
I'm a drifter through unknown lands.
Search for an exit out of this place.

The gift of life, so fragile it was.
Squeezed between ** ** and machines.
** ** ** ** and plastic tubes.
Want to talk but I can't.
Want to move but I'm nailed to the ground.
** ** ** ** **

Child of the moon, coma of light.
See myself from above, await for a final decision. [X2]

Falling down, entering no-where,
Between our world and the realm of death.
I'm a drifter through unknown lands.
Search for an exit out of this place.

So I lay here, going insane.
What was in the past?
No one knows how to get me out. 
They just stand around my bed.
Fill me up with all kinds of drugs
But I know there is a way.
Switch off the machine to let me go.
Let me sleep this time for real.

Child of the moon, coma of light.
See myself from above, await for a final decision.
