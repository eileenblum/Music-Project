So you've had enough of all that waste around you
Now you want to travel along another path
If you wish to see a totally different view
Come into my deadly arms feel the green mist cover you

We'll drift thru the universe no more responsibility
High above the clouds far from reality

Skeleton on your shoulder
I'm here to please
Skeleton on your shoulder
I'll bring you to your knees

Skeleton on your shoulder
I'll show you your greed
Skeleton on your shoulder
I'll bring you to your knees

I taste as sweet as honey but I'm dangerous like a snake
You will spend all you have to stay with Her Majesty
Remember when it's late much too late to care
When the curtain falls my dark side's waiting there

Skeleton on your shoulder
I'll bring you to your knees
Skeleton on your shoulder
I will make you bleed
