Wake up step out of your dream come out of the mire
Realize what they do think about what you do
Is this what I live for or a dream I die for
Where is the sense what's the price you pay

Did you see their faces beaten to obey
Did you see the colours sulphur yellow, concrete gray
Did you see the eyes listless and indifferent
Oppression no resistance bodies without a spine

Sudden fall

Sometimes they talk behind your back
Is he your friend who do you trust
How far can we go who sets all the limits
Who gives us rights we've never wanted?

Sudden fall

Day by day your hands are used
To build a world called decadence
So shut your eyes close your ears
Close your mind and perish with the multitude
