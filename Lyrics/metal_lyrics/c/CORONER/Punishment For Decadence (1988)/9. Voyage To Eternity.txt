Been a long time since I heard a human voice
Sitting at my controls watching those flashing lights

Few breaths left in my oxygen supply
Communication dead earth now just a spot

Now I know...I'm on my way
Now I know...Eternity calls me

Red light alarm the air is going bad
I lie back untie my belts everything is blurred

No air left in my oxygen supply
Soon I'll sleep away earth is just a memory

In many years from now
Someone will find my ship
Someone will see my body in it
And see the smile on my face
