I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's happend to you
Yesterday we were one
Now, I don't even know your name

Standing in front of a wall
Hitting it with my fists
But you can't hear
'Cos we're so far apart

I'd like to understand
What's going on deep in your mind
Why you've destroyed the spell
And how you can be so cool 'bout that

I see you smile it's like a punch in my face
Can't you feel my bleeding heart
Is that you who's standing next to me
Or just a shadow, of a dream I lost
