They never see nothing but debris
They never hear news without a fear
They never understand the game, the sense, the plan
They never feel injuries that heal

Proud to die for faith
Fanatic, Agitators, Deceive

New breed of man
Grew up in war
New breen of man
Like never before

They never see religions agree
They never understand count the days on one hand
