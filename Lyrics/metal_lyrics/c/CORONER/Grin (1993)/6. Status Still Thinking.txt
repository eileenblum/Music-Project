Don't wanna know your brother's name
Don't wanna know your sister's face
Don't wanna know your mother's age
Don't wanna know your father's wage

Don't wanna know your former friends
Don't wanna know your secret thoughts
Don't wanna know the drug you're on
Just wanna know why

Don't wanna know the master plan
Don't wanna know the hours spent
Don't wanna know who wins the war
Don't wanna know whatever no more

Don't wanna see the sun today
Don't wanna see the masses pray
Don't wanna see the children play
Just wanna see

Why do I hate you?

Hate!

Don't wanna hear no tragedy
Don't wanna hear the things you see
Don't wanna hear no wedding bells
Don't wanna hear no dying dance

Don't wanna feel a warming breeze
Don't wanna feel you touching me
Don't wanna feel like I'm on trial
I wanna feel I know
