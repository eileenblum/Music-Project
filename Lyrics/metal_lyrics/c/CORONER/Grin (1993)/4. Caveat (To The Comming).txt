Children, fragile minds beware
This world is about to cut your hair
This world is about to bleach your skin
This world is about to lock you in

Gentle, fragile minds beware
This world will appear, cold and bare
This world wants to eat all of your dreams
But there is more than what it seems

But
you don't
You won't...change what

You could
Change what
You should

Children, fragile minds beware
Sun is about to disappear
Concrete is danger over here
Now leave that place, mayhem and fear
