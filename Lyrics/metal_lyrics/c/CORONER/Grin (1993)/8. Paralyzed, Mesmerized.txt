I will smile, while you still cry
I'll be in the light, while you still hide
I'll be far away, while you still sleep
And I'll always remember this believe

The end of the road
The end of a love
The end of the game
The end of the fame
The end of summer
The end of freedom
Leaving you behind like

Paralyzed, mesmerized

I will understand, while you still ignore
I'll use wings, while you still walk
I'll tell the truth, while you still have to lie
And I wonder, why you stand behind just like
