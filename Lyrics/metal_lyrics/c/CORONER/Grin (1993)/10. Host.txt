Again and again
It winds slick/lix-like to have a fire site
Perilous thorn in my brain

Parasite nimble with convulsed streams of plasma
Nestles, sure of entry, in my brain

It breeds
It sweats
It burns
It lives

Piece by piece, it knows me, and I know it
Just when it comes and when it goes
It stays by me, in secret, all alone

Whenever I do what it drives me to
It takes a little piece of me and burns it
As a tribute to its god

As its temple and its victim
My blood runs on marble floors
Just like some insane circulation
Back into my corroded heart

By then I realize
There's just one door
One door, unlocked
I open the door, and

All songs by Coroner.
