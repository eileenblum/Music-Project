Oppression, weighs a ton
Depression, stains in black
Regression, the way things run
Aggression, my last resort

Love never crossed my way
Care, not even for myself
Peace means to reload a gun
Rest, I won't before I die

Nails in my brain, all that's left...just

Grin!
Grin 'til I lose
Until I lose...myself

Adrenalin, a legal drug
Anger corrodes my heart
Boredom, nitroglycerine
Violence, primal fear

Nails in my brain, nails hurt

Religion, violent innocence, guilt, panic
Exposed to all - A false reality
Look all through society...
More locks than keys
