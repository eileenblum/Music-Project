A thousand souls are waiting, for a day that never comes
A thousand eyes still closed, cause they're afraid to see the world
Two thousand hands are bound, with golden chains they bought themselves
Two thousand legs can't walk, cause they never learned to move

Got it!

A thousand hearts are bleeding, despite the nails of unknown pain
A thousand heads are bowed, pray for mercy, pray for gold
Two thousand feet are stumbling, on the roads that lead nowhere
Two thousand ears are deaf, from the noise of luxury

Don't you know you keep the nature
Chained in dungeons black as coal
Don't you know you adore
An eagle with broken wings

Roses that never bloom
Wheels that never spin
Bells that never ring
Hands too far to reach
