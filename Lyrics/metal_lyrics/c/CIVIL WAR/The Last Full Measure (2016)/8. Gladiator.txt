Acid dreams infernal thoughts
Future is for real
Monsters creatures of mankind
Stronger than the steel
We are frightened we are enlightened
Is this the ending of the earth
Forever and ever this war will go on
I know we're children of rebirth

Sacred hearts of outer space
Is there signs of life
We need a place our time is running out

Gladiator of the earth
We are the human race lost in the final phase now
Forever seeking
Gladiator of this time
Lost in the future fight heading into the light now
Gladiator

Who can live forevermore
None that's what I've heard
Ghosts or angels I don't care
I'm a watcher of the world
Sole survivor unholy driver
Time now to open up the gates
The masses just want to come in from the cold
I know it's a legacy of hate

Hear our song infinity
We are here and now
Liar and betrayer you must die

Gladiator of the earth
We are the human race lost in the final phase now
Forever seeking
Gladiator of this time
Lost in the future fight heading into the light now
Gladiator

Gladiator of the earth
We are the human race lost in the final phase now
Forever seeking
Gladiator of this time
Lost in the future fight heading into the light now
Gladiator

Gladiator of the earth
