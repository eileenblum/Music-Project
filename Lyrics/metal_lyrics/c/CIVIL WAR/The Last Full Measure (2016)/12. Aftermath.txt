As I look at the ruins of my so called life
In the dust on the killing ground it cuts me like a knife
Just like lambs to slaughter they were sure to die
We had our orders no remorse no matter how they cry
And it went on and on and on

So leave a light on for me
If I'll return in the middle of the night
I'm a wounded man but now I'm coming home
I may stumble and bleed
But I'll never ever lose this fight
This is a road from hell and I'll walk 'til my final breath

Aftermath
Aftermath
Now nothing will be the same

Now in the wheel of confusion it is hard to tell
Was it worth all this blood and pain
Imprisoned in my cell
I'm tired of being tied by my nightmares and fears
Now let it be like it was before this endless misery

Now it rages on and on and on

Leave a light on for me
If I'll return in the middle of the night
I'm a wounded man but now I'm coming home
I may stumble and bleed
But I'll never ever quit this fight
This is a road from hell and I'll walk 'til my final breath

And it went on and on and on

So leave a light on for me
If I'll return in the middle of the night
I'm a wounded man but now I'm coming home
So leave a light on for me
If I'll return in the middle of the night
I'm a wounded man but now I'm coming home
I may stumble and bleed
But I'll never ever quit this fight
This is a road from hell and I'll walk 'til my final breath

Aftermath
Now Aftermath
'Til my final breath
It is what it is but now I'm home
