I wake up at night again and again
But there ain't no turning back I must carry on
Pray for me mother pray for me dad
It's a slaughter in the sun
And we try to get some justice with a gun

Some people say there's no golden bridge to heaven
And some people say
That they know it all too well it's a road straight to hell

It's the last full measure
Fight for the flag and for peace
It's the last full measure
One more battle to win
So men there is no giving in

The chaos is here the show has begun
Armageddon finally came and the blood will flow
So bury me father fix me a grave
And I will never ever run
And my only friend is the trigger of my gun

Some people say that the war will soon be over
But in my head the war still rages on I'm the prodigal son

It's the last full measure
Now fight for the flag and for peace
It's the last full measure
One more battle to win
And no giving in

It's the last full measure
Fight for the flag and for peace
It's the last full measure
One more battle to win
So men there is no giving in

It's the last full measure
Fight for the flag and for peace
It's the last full measure
One more battle to win
So men there is no giving in

This civil war has divided the people
The land of the free speak of history no more
What have we learned from all these wasted lives
The future is dark it's no rime or reason
It's over and out only shame and treason
No room for heroes it's a sign of our time

It's the last full measure
Fight for the flag and for peace
It's the last full measure
One more battle to win
There's no giving in

This will end the civil war
