Now heroes die young?
Save your tears and wait for the new horizon
We are an army without uniforms

Now we're bonded by blood
Signed and sealed a pact that will live forever
The final ordeal has arrived
It is coming down
Heaven can wait, but we have so many battles to win

Ride into the sun
Surf on the clouds
There's no meaning to stay here lonely
Days all come
They will go
Save the show
Enlighten us

Heaven can wait
'cause we are not ready to lay down and die

Now as we can see the new world
There ain't no turning back
Rise, rise, children of Utopia

We are walking on the glory road to victory
And there's no paradise with peace and joy
The struggle goes on without misery
The future looks brighter than ever
On the road to victory

The serpents and fools are for real
They live on the edge of danger
And some people say they all are make believer

Fight
Time's running out
There is no doubt
That we stand for the greatest challenge
Now there is no way,
No chance to escape
We conquer all

Heaven can wait
'cause we have so many more battles to win

Dogs of war
No one can tame us
There is no second chance
Rise, rise
This will be euphoria

We are walking on the glory road to victory
And there's no paradise with peace and joy
The struggle goes on without misery
The future looks brighter than ever
On the road to victory

Dogs of war
No one can tame us
There is no second chance
Rise, rise, children of Utopia

We are walking on the glory road to victory
And there's no paradise with peace and joy
The struggle goes on without misery
The future looks brighter than ever
On the road to heaven

Walking on the glory road to victory
And there's no paradise with peace and joy
The struggle goes on without misery
The future looks brighter than ever
On the road to victory
