Doc Holiday had a very lousy day
Coughed real bad said someone has to pay
Big nosed Kate prayed for Doc Holiday

O.K. Corral they were there to give them hell
The three brothers Earp this could never end up well
Legends foretell 'bout O.K. Corral

A showdown in flames there in Tombstone again
There were rifles and guns they were cowboys for fun
A showdown in flames here in Tombstone my friend
These were tough boys to break three more coffins to make
No one cared no one cared
Who will die who will live who will piss on your grave
No one cared no one cared
There's no law there's no order this is Mans Land

Ride sheriff ride many outlaws have to die
Seek and destroy let the lonely widows cry
It's vendetta time so ride sheriff ride

Doc Holiday had a very lousy day
He followed his friends it's the brotherhood of men
Big nosed Kate cried for Doc Holiday

A showdown in flames there in Tombstone again
There were rifles and guns they were cowboys for fun
A showdown in flames here in Tombstone my friend
These were tough boys to break three more coffins to make
No one cared no one cared
Who will die who will live who will piss on your grave
No one cared no one cared
There's no law there's no order this is Mans Land
Die die say goodbye

I'm gonna leave you for a while now honey
I'm gonna spend some time
Where bullets fly where doctors die

Doc Holiday had a very lousy day
He followed his friends it's the brotherhood of men
Big nosed Kate cried for Doc Holiday

A showdown in flames there in Tombstone again
There were rifles and guns they were cowboys for fun
A showdown in flames here in Tombstone my friend
These were tough boys to break three more coffins to make

Who will die who will live who will piss on your grave
No one cared no one cared
There's no law there's no order this is Mans Land

Die die say goodbye
