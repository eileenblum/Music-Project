Now is time for a revolution
It is time for our retribution
This is the beginning of eternity

The riot and the rage wake up and turn the page
It's a play of no remorse and of violence of course
Had no choice we had to fight for the pride and Irish might
We were not afraid we'd break them alright

Gangs of New York
Now the cold wind is blowing in your face
Dead rabbits fight 'gainst the Bowery boys now

Out in the street there's a bare knuckle fighting feast
A war in the heart of New York
Blood all around on the square of the battle ground
Raging with knives bats and guns
So come on

We are the boys from Five Points
United we are too strong
Had no choice this is our place bring us to the amazing grace
No one will back down this is our town

Cradle of dust in this chaos all insects must be crushed
Gangs of New York now the mob rules are written

Out in the street there's a bare knuckle fighting feast
A war in the heart of New York
Blood all around on the square of the battle ground
Raging with knives bats and guns
Out in the street there's a bare knuckle fighting feast
A war in the heart of New York
Blood all around on the square of the battle ground
Fighting with knives bats and guns

Gangs of New York
Now the cold wind is blowing in your face
Dead rabbits fight 'gainst the Bowery boys now

Out in the street there's a bare knuckle fighting feast
A war in the heart of New York
Blood all around on the square of the battle ground
We are forever
Out in the street there's a bare knuckle fighting feast
A war in the heart of New York
Blood all around on the square of the battle ground
Raging with knives bats and guns
Oh no

Gangs of New now the mob rules are written
Gangs of New York
