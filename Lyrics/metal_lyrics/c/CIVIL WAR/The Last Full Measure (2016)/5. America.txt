Here we are on a quest for another world
For a place far away many thousands of miles
'Cause this land is united with misery
With my hands I shall build a new life to live

Raging seas and stormy skies
Many starved and many died
But hear I don't have any fear

Sail away set sail for the heavenly bay
Never again will you cry
Sail away the future looks brighter today
Save all your prayers for America
For America

Life was tough with no pride or no dignity
People fled to this land of glory and gold
And they built and they formed the land of the free
Guess you all know the rest of the story

Father father come and see
The new horizon finally
We're here the salvation is near

Sail away set sail for the heavenly bay
Never again will you cry
Sail away the future looks brighter today
Save all your prayers for America
For America
For America

In my dreams I think of you again
The place were I learned how to climb
You will always be my heart and my soul
It's the only prayer I know
But now this is my home
My home

Now sail away set sail for the heavenly bay
Never again will you cry
Sail away the future looks brighter today
Save all your prayers for America

Sail away set sail for the heavenly bay
Never again will you cry
Sail away the future looks brighter today
Save all your prayers for America
For America
For America
