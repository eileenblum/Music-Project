I am a story of the grand illusion
I walk among the living dead
This world is built on hate and mass confusion
Endless pain and torture fill my days

Thousand years of lunacy
Thousand years of lies
Lonely is the hunter who's running in the dark
Ancient words insanity
Stupidity will rise
'Cause now I see it so clear

This is a tale that never should be told
Thought it's been here forever
Hiding in the corner of your eyes
This is a story from the days of old
Many still do believe it
It's time to realize and clear your minds
While I still have time

Blind lead the blind in the realms of heathens
Great politicians made a plan
Wise men came to write a book
Who could understand
These holy scripts by corrupted hands

We know how to tame a land this is what to do
Kill everyone who's asking break down the free and brave
Take the flock to wasted lands whip them with our rules
They'll soon be under our command

This is a tale that never should be told
Thought it's been here forever
Hiding in the corner of your eyes
This is a story from the days of old
Many still do believe it
It's time to realize and clear your minds
While I still have time
While I still have time

Desert of tears ocean of death
Father and son eternal slaves
Conquer their souls buyer of sins
Enemies fall curse their lives

Heaven is a fictive place and Hell is just the same
This sacred fraud has been going on since always
Break the chains of ignorance speak up don't play the game
Man kind's on its knee but we're not dying
No more tears

This is a tale that never should be told
Thought it's been here forever
Hiding in the corner of your eyes
This is a story from the days of old
Many still do believe it
It's time to realize and clear your minds

This is a tale that never should be told
Thought it's been here forever
Hiding in the corner of your eyes
This is a story from the days of old
Many still do believe it
It's time to realize and clear your minds
While I still have time
