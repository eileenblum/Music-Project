Wake us save us we stand on the edge of the world
I know that we're too young to die
There's so much evil evil embracing our dear Mother Earth
I see a crack up in the sky
Salvation is near

I'm praying for deliverance
Deliverance from slavery
It is time to break the chains now
No more masters no more slaves
Deliverance
Deliverance eternally
We shall walk away as free men
On this hot and bloody ground
And forever be remembered
In the books to be found

Deliverance is here
Deliverance

Torture anger my life has been built up on hate
But now it's time for them to burn
Freedom freedom this war has been raging so long
But what is right and what is wrong
Progression is here

We're praying for deliverance
Deliverance from slavery
It is time to break the chains now
No more masters no more slaves
Deliverance
Deliverance eternally
Shall we walk away as free men
On this hot and bloody road
And forever be remembered
By the sweet and loving lord

Life is a riddle I'm caught in the middle
Is this just a sign of a crime
Who is the liar who's playing with fire
Ignorance burn in the night
They say people learn from their own mistakes
Time to open your eyes and realize
Salvation is near

I'm praying for

Deliverance
Deliverance from slavery
It is time to break the chains now
No more masters no more slaves
Deliverance
Deliverance eternally
We shall walk away as free men
On this hot and bloody ground
And forever be remembered
In the books to be found

Deliverance
