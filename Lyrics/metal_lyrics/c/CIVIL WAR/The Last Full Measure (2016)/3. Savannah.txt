Come along now boys we've got so many miles to go
It has been so many fights and now it's time to show
What a boy is really made of
What a man's prepared to die for
Be a killer angel in the army under God

Mississippi soldiers Army of the Tennessee
If you talk you'd better walk the walk with me
It is time to play with fire being judge without a trail
Army of Georgia set the devil in you free

We're rolling like thunder we burn and we plunder
The Principle of the scorched earth
Civilians are dying the children are crying
But this is the way of the world

Savannah here we come this is the final march
The star spangled banner waving over us tonight
Savannah soon it's done you must surrender
There is no glory in defeat but Hell is far away

When I read the story of this long and bloody war
I realized what they were really fighting for
Memories will live forever be the stupid or the clever
Or this wicked war will rage on and on and on

The Atlantic ocean came closer everyday
And Sherman made a vow now it's time to pay
It was just around the corner and before it's getting colder
This war shall end I guarantee you President

The tactic was brutal but God Hallelujah
In gun smoke the justice was made
Bloodshed and chaos the northern invaders
Completing the inglorious raid

Savannah here we come this is the final march
The star spangled banner waving over us tonight
Savannah soon it's done you must surrender
There is no glory in defeat but Hell is far away

Savannah here we come this is the final march
The star spangled banner waving over us tonight
Savannah soon it's done you must surrender
There is no glory in defeat but Hell is far away
There is no glory in defeat but Hell is far away
