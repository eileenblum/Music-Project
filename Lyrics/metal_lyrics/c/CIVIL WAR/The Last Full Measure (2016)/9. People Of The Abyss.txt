The devil is me but I don't understand the evil is rising
The devil is you it's a part of the plan dehumanizing
Why can't we treat each and everyone with respect and love
Dying and living it's all just the same
In this ongoing merry go round
There are many lies a weapon to control
Words are lethal in this game
Corruption and treason the ultimate show

The cradle is rocked by the Babylon whore
This world will explode and I know it's for sure
A sightseeing in Hell death and chaos
Now time's running out but they don't understand
This war is a crime it's not man against man
It's a big crucial miss and a venomous kiss
They are the people of the abyss

The Devil within is better without fear and confusion
We all have to sin to live it all out there's no final solution
So many theories but I know for a fact
There's no second chance
Violence and force is a part of their game
How I wish that we all could be friends

Walls they built may tumble down
The Earth would be as new
We are in this all together
Surrender to love let the good feelings flow

The cradle is rocked by the Babylon whore
This world will explode and I know it's for sure
A sightseeing in Hell death and chaos
Now time's running out but they don't understand
This war is a crime it's not man against man
It's a big crucial miss and a venomous kiss
They are the people of the abyss

The cradle is rocked by the Babylon whore
This world will explode and I know it's for sure
A sightseeing in Hell death and chaos
Now time's running out but they don't understand
This war is a crime it's not man against man
It's a big crucial miss and a venomous kiss
They are the people of the abyss
