Attack attack the sky is on fire
Tonight we strike as hard as we can
Get back get back stay down in your cellars
We are the British Bomber command

It's time to pay for what you've done
You can not hide you can not run
This time is it for real
A massacre with raining bombs many thousand tons
Women and children so it must be

Now I want something to burn
And tables to turn
British steel time to spread the word

Strike hard strike sure my lads
Be proud no turning back
This is what we do for the queen and the empire
Strike hard strike sure now boys
No fear will come to us
Now we are about to save the world

We fly you die the winged assassins
For peace we kill as much as we can
But what is right and what is wrong
What the hell is going on
Obeying orders that's what we do

In war there ain't no giving in
The trick is to win
The allied force and army without sin

Strike hard strike sure my lads
Be proud no turning back
This is what we do for the queen and the empire
Strike hard strike sure now boys
No fear will come to us
Now we are about to save the world

Now I want something to burn
And tables to turn
British steel time to spread the word

Strike hard strike sure
Strike hard strike sure

Strike hard strike sure my lads
Be proud no turning back
This is what we do for the queen and the empire
Strike hard strike sure now boys
No fear will come to us
Now we are about to save the world
