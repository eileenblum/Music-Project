Escape from the slavery
From the villain he ran for his life
Left the island far behind
To study the heavenly might

Many lessons yet to be learned
But he would return

Rise up to meet his fate
To cast the druids away
Sent from the God above
A weapon to teach heathens pray

Many worship his name
Got his portrait in frame
Now listen to me, it is more than a tale

In times of rage and fury
You are the pride and glory
The world is mad it has gone insane
When stormy night keeps roaring
I hear the spirits calling
We'll meet again along the way
Saint Patrick's Day

Life is a clever path
A riddle of Good versus Bad
Friends turn to enemies
This breakdown makes me so sad
All these wars and we never learned
Shall he return?

Guess it's built on a lie
Not a heavenly sign
What can I do?
I just cry out your name

Many worship his name
Got his portrait in frame
Now listen to me, it is more than a tale

[Chorus]
