I search of the grail
I long for immortality
All things must come to an end
Who wants to live forever
So many stories to be told
Oh, how I sold my soul
Fire, ice, wind or rain:
Nothing can stop this game

So many miles away
So many nights are days
But a believer must believe
before he pays

Dream away
Go to the fairytale of lies
I know we have to stay
At Lucifer's Court
Dream away
Go to the fairytale of lies
I know we have to stay
At Lucifer's Court

Exploring the world
In search for eternal life
Now I can see it so clear
I am the link to heaven
So many mountains to be climb
No sacrifice
Right or wrong weak or strong
I am the only one

No need to analyze
It is the cup of Christ
Yet, still I know that
I'm a slave under the Reich
