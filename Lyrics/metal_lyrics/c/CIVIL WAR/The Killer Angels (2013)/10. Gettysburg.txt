Leaving all behind,
the award is to be found
Like a scene from a dream
and a vision of heavenly might
In the cradle of this war, I know,
and that's for sure
When the battle's done:
there can be only one
I am marching against evil
May the Lord be on our side

Ready to fight; fire at will
We shall die in Gettysburg
Ready to fight; fire at will
People will cry over Gettysburg

This inferno turned me blind
there was fire and smoke all around
Dead bodies and blood everywhere
in this unholy ground
Now the future is no more,
we're all lost to this vicious whore
When the victory's won,
I'm a fatherless son
We went out to fight for glory
Only one of us came home

I sit here on my porch
as an old and lonely man
Sometimes I recall
when terror struck the land
Was it right to go to arms
to defend the freedom rights
I am sure or else I've lived upon a lie
