I will rule the universe

1804 as emperor sworn
soldier at heart a child of war
Napoleon Bonaparte
A master of the game and equal to God
Invading the lands of greed and fraud
Turned warfare to an art

He was known as the chosen one
Born 1769 in Corsica
His family's joy and pride
It is just like a fairy tale
This boy was not for sale
And he never lied, but how he cried:

I will rule the universe
I'm the glory, I'm the brave
Going down in history forever
I will rule the universe
I shall crush their sorrows veil
And soon I will be marching into heaven
I'm greater than God

Who could believe this boy would achieve
All of his dreams and what he believed
It went down in history
But luck has an end you know it too well
Heaven is bound to turn into Hell
His time was running out

At the battle of Waterloo
No chance; the enemy was far to strong
And here's another song
It was the end of the fairy tale
Everyone is bound to fail
It must be right; but damn he tried

I will rule the universe
I'm the glory, I'm the brave
Going down in history forever
I will rule the universe
I shall crush their sorrows veil
And soon I will be marching into heaven
I'm greater than God

There are many types of heroes, 
and this is one of a kind
In these days so full of zeros, 
I keep gazing at the sky
