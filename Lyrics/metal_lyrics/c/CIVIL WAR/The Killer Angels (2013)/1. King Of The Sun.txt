He rocked, he rolled, he was the idol
To be true, the deal was kinda shirty
But he became a guiding light
Shot down in flames
By Spanish soldiers
But we will never, never ever
Forget his wicked paradise
Some people live forever
Some people always seem to lose
No man is bullet proof

He's the king of the sun,
the Devil in disguise
Who could have seen
that his kingdom soon would fall
A funeral pyre of dark desire
He was the king of the sun

Explore the world, life is a gold mine
And we will never, never ever
Forget the legendary ones

Inside the golden city
Behold the unholy rite
A human sacrifice

Heaven is for heroes and hell is full of fools
Searching for a brighter world
where life is pure and true
Marching to oblivion or to eternal fame
Ride into infinity and testify in pain

He's the king of the sun;
he's the king of the stars
He's the king of the sun
and the moon and the stars
