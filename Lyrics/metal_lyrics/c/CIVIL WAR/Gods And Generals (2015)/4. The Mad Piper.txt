When you walk through the fire if you're lost in the dark
I will tell you son
There are legends of heroes not many are true
But here is one

Let me tell you some more 'bout Normandy
And a name that will shine eternally
A lad who was sent to a place you know well
To play for his comrades on the road to Hell

Walked into the fire without fear in his heart
Only armed with his bagpipe he was destined to march
And the madness could start

Play for me brother like never before
Scottish Piper Bill
Play "Hielan laddie" and "The Road to the Isles"
On your pipe of peace

It was pride it was real and no tale from the past
They were there to be legends to set marks that would last
Soldiers may stand and soldiers may fall
And this is about one who did stand tall

A Scotsman was fighting in world war number one
In the same kilt as our piper like father like son

Play for me brother like never before
Scottish Piper Bill
Play "Hielan laddie" and "The Road to the Isles"
On your pipe of peace
On your pipe of peace

Bring 'em down to their knees

Play for me brother like never before
Scottish Piper Bill
And play "Hielan laddie" and "The Road to the Isles"
On your pipe of peace

Play for me brother like never before
Scottish Piper Bill
Play "Hielan laddie" and "The Road to the Isles"
On your pipe of peace
On your pipe of peace

Scottish Piper Bill playing for peace
