[Bonus Track]Warriors
Fight
Forever [2x]

We are the sons of the power brigade
Walking the endless mile
Riding the storm and we'll never back down
Legends never die
So kneel before the colours on my shield

For a thousand years and more you will stand with guts and pride
The mother of many legends all prepared to stand and fight
So hear me soldiers: let it out

We are the sons of the power brigade
Walking the endless mile
Riding the storm and we'll never back down
Legends never die
So kneel before the colours on my shield

For the thousand fallen brothers I raise my cup and sing
And to all of you that doubt it is time for us to win
When I say fire we begin

We are the sons of the power brigade
Walking the endless mile
Riding the storm and we'll never back down
Legends never die
So kneel before the colours on my shield

Life is full of danger death is not a stranger
Darkness turn into light
Burning with desire heathens on fire
Warriors hear my cry

Now life is full of danger death is not a stranger
Darkness turn into light
Burning with desire heathens on fire
Warriors hear my cry

We are the sons of the power brigade
Walking the endless mile
Riding the storm and we'll never back down
Legends never die
So kneel before the colours on my shield

We are the sons of the power brigade
Walking the endless mile
Riding the storm and we'll never back down
Legends never die
So kneel before the colours on my shield
I said kneel before the colours on my heart and on my shield
