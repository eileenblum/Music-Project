Now as the longboat disappears behind the morning mist so clear
The were seeking land could they understand that they never would return

They're out on the last crusade in quest after better days
To conquer it all
Viking funeral live forevermore
Fought on the barricades
Tales from the battle days
It's kill or be killed
Pagan minds to find the tears from the north

On the rivers in the east
Rurik came to unleash the beast
People tried to fight against the Swedish might
But they did not stand a chance

Out on the last crusade in quest after better days to conquer it all
Viking funeral live forevermore
Fought on the barricades
Tales from the battle days
It's kill or be killed

Pagan minds the heathens from the north
Out on the last crusade in quest after better days to conquer it all
Lay down your shield and sword
To dry the tears from the north

Mother Russia today would not be the same
If the Vikings had not been
Rimes from the past destined to last
For long

Mr. Eriksson came to America my friend many years before the rest
Men from the north had an urge to explore it all
So I sing you my song

Out on the last crusade in quest after better days to conquer it all
Viking funeral live forevermore
Fought on the barricades
Tales from the battle days
It's kill or be killed
Pagan minds the heathens from the north

Out on the last crusade in quest after better days to conquer it all
Viking funeral live forevermore
Fought on the barricades
Tales from the battle days
It's kill or be killed
I tell you pagan minds to dry the tears from the north

Now as the longboat disappear
Behind the morning mist so clear
They were seeking land could they understand
That they never would return again
