A second of light it came like a flash from heaven
The moment of truth a minute of doubt but then my friend
It came from the sky they came from the sea
We all knew that we would die

The secret of war is that the strongest will stand
Don't ever believe there is some glory
And I can recall when enemies came to invade
So many years ago

Going back to the island again
I'll return to the fire and hell
I wake up every night and I scream after light
As I feel Iwo Jima again
Back to Iwo Jima again

All of us knew
It's over and out but samurais keep fighting
We stand for the flag and aim for the win though we have lost
Recalling the days the warriors way
I can see it though I'm blind

So what do you say if they call you a liar and a thief
And how do you plead are you the guilty
The worst of it all was that I could not go home
To the place where I belong

Going back to the island again
I'll return to the fire and hell
I wake up every night and I scream after light
As I feel Iwo Jima again
Back to Iwo Jima my friend

Going back to the island again
I'll return to the fire and hell
I wake up every night and I scream after light
In the Land of the Rising Sun

I will return to the island again
I'll return to the fire and hell
I wake up every night and I scream after light
I'll go back to the island again
I'll go back to the island again

Back to Iwo Jima again
