We are talking 'bout the past
And a freedom fighter that will last
He's known as the guardian of Scotland

William Wallace was his name
Fighting to protect the land
A nightmare to the king of England

Rime of the warrior
Fighting the freedom war
Wielding the axe
You know that
Hearts did burn
Time to learn
Blessed be thy brave
Rime of the warrior
Fighting the freedom war
Die by the sword
Rise rise a true sacrifice
The hammer must be stopped

He did not fight to gain the throne
Just to protect the Scottish soil
But one day he had to surrender

Treason brought him to his grave
Captured and tortured like a slave
Taken to London for execution

Rime of the warrior
Fighting the freedom war
Wielding the axe
You know that
Hearts did burn
Time to learn
Blessed be thy brave
Rime of the warrior
Fighting the freedom war
Die by the sword
Rise rise a true sacrifice
The hammer must be stopped

He was a man with a brave heart
The Braveheart [2x]

He was a man with a brave heart
The Braveheart [2x]

This is the rime

Rime of the warrior
Fighting the freedom war
Wielding the axe
You know that
Hearts did burn
Time to learn
Blessed be thy brave
Rime of the warrior
Fighting the freedom war
Die by the sword
Rise rise a true sacrifice
The hammer must be stopped

They called him The Braveheart
The Braveheart [2x]

He was a man with a brave heart
The Braveheart [2x]

True heroes never die
