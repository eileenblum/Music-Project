It's ship against ship and man against man
The Trafalgar showdown is here
A crucial ordeal, steel against steel: hold on get ready to fire

Victory turned towards the enemy fleet
An alliance between France and Spain
This war on the waves would decide Europe's fate
We don't run: we're here to attack

Blood, smoke and water, body parts everywhere
Cannonballs flying, bullets in the air
Nelson was standing in the middle of it all
No one thought he would fall

He's the admiral over the oceans
The admiral over the sea
He's the admiral over the oceans
If you don't understand, read the history book again!

I do believe they have done it at last
but the battle has been won
I have a short time to live, this time I give in
My duty has been done

Wars can't be won by the hand of just one man
That may be true but listen clear my friend
He sailed the seas with a cause to serve his land
Under Gods command

He's the admiral over the oceans
The admiral over the sea
He's the admiral over the oceans
If you don't understand, read the history book
He's the admiral over the oceans
The emperor over the waves
He's the admiral over the oceans
If you don't understand, read the history book again

Blood, smoke and water, body parts everywhere
Cannonballs flying, bullets in the air
Nelson was standing in the middle of it all
No one thought he would fall

He's the admiral over the oceans
The admiral over the sea
He's the admiral over the oceans
If you don't understand, read the history book
He's the admiral over the oceans
The emperor over the waves
He's the admiral over the oceans

If you don't understand,
take a look at Trafalgar Square.
