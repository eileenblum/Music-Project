They're out for blood tonight they're the widowmakers
Killer elite Cuba invaders
A motley crew in the line of fire

A raging horde of criminal pilgrims
Murder patrol of heavy drug addicts
Burning wheel on the road to ruin

This is the dark chapter of freedom
But no one cares where is the reader now
The words are gone somehow but I just can't take it so

Break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolutions bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs

The Bay of Pigs [2x]

So have you seen the news have you felt desire
The lust to kill to turn on the pyre
Tell me son: Do you even bother

Sometimes it drives me mad that I don't know
The secret script to the questions of our lives
Please don't say that I am a liar

You know
Back in the days they remembered the world war
It was for real and just like a time bomb
Why can't we find another way these boys were on top so

Break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolutions bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs

What a slaughter

This is the dark side of the story
Hookers of greed power horny
Ooohh
Let's find another war

You better break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolutions bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs

The Bay of Pigs
Pigs [2x]
