Is it the end my friend is this the time to wave
I've been away from home for so long
I look at the fading night
I fear the morning light
Visions of glory days are gone

Now tell me where you are
Then tell me please is it far

To Schindler's Ark
I don't know they're sent there to fade away
I don't know which day I will die
Tell me why the strong doesn't have to pay
Here I am no more will I cry [2x]

Is this the Nazi way
Is this the way they pay
Memories came back to me
Should I stay or should I go
Don't talk to a loaded gun
Father what have I done
Mr. Schindler an angel sent from God

You saved so many lives
Thanks to you I did survive

To Schindler's Ark
I don't know they're sent there to fade away
I don't know which day I will die
Tell me why the strong doesn't have to pay
Here I am no more will I cry [2x]

Schindler's Ark is here

Now tell me where you are
Then tell me please is it far to Schindler's Ark

I don't know they're sent there to fade away
I don't know which day I will die
Tell me why the strong doesn't have to pay
I'm so tired of running

To Schindler's Ark
I don't know they're sent there to fade away
I don't know which day I will die
Tell me why the strong doesn't have to pay
Here I am no more will I cry [2x]

Please Schindler take me home
On Schindler's Ark
