[Bonus Track]I'll sing you a song and I know that it's right
The words that I give will spread some light
A different breed soldiers from the valley

On occupied land always under attack
Starving and dying all was black
They went to war ready to devour

If I live I'll tell you how they faced the gates of hell
Stand up sons hold your ground until the end

Give us rain bring us fire
We are here forevermore
Desperate hearts Knights of Dalecarlia
Through the snow ice and hailstorms
Defenders of the right to be
Burning souls destined to be free
Knights of Dalecarlia

One man stood up 'gainst the tyrants and tried
To gather an army to fight them down
No one dared but the soldiers from the valley

The Danes had to flee from the rage of the north
Abandoned the land with the freedom call
It's history now and we must all remember

People starved and they died so thank God for those who tried
Flesh and blood sweat and tears for you we cry

Give us rain bring us fire
We are here forevermore
Desperate hearts Knights of Dalecarlia
Through the snow ice and hailstorms
Defenders of the right to be
Burning souls destined to be free
Knights of Dalecarlia
Dalecarlia

Give us rain bring us fire
We are here forevermore
Desperate hearts Knights of Dalecarlia
Through the snow ice and hailstorms
Defenders of the right to be
Burning souls Knights of Dalecarlia
Dalecarlia

In my heart forever [2x]
