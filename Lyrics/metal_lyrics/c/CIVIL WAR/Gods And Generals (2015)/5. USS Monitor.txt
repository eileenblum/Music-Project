I know that the sun goes down
As sure as the world still spins around
This is the new and modern way
Speak of the devil here I am

Came from the Viking land
Caught in the cold couldn't understand
Stuck in the woods of wilderness
Blessed with the fury

Off we go to conquer other shores
I do really want it all
Please open the door

Hold your fire save your life
Armored in the steel the USS Monitor
This is judgment day
The rise of the ironclad

In England but things turned bad
Inventions of mine just could not stand
The west was at war and needed help
Inferno on the river

Armed with iron like a wall
So treat me better than before
And the hammer will fall

Hold your fire save your life
Armored in the steel the USS Monitor
This is judgment day
The rise of the ironclad

Hold your fire save your life
Armed in the steel the USS Monitor
This is judgment day
The rise of the ironclad

It's judgment day

Ironclad [8x]

Hold your fire save your life
Armored in the steel the USS Monitor
This is judgment day
The rise of the ironclad [2x]
