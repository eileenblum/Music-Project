I face another hopeless evening
Travellin' through the shadows of my mind
Remote control, the television's screamin'
Listen to the voices from behind

Try to understand their hidden meaning
I keep my visions to myself

We warned you of destruction
Our world is going down
And nothing's left
And no one's here but me

My mind is tortured by illusions
Pictures rise and fall before my eyes

Try to understand their hidden meaning
I keep my visions to myself

We warned you of destruction
Our world is going down
We warned you of destruction
Our world is going down
And nothing's left
And no one's here but me
There's no one here but me

This could be a day for revolution
See things from a different point of view
(You might) lose control
But you won't lose your personality
Nothing is as steady as the change
Prepare yourself

Can't stand another restless evening with myself
Runnin' from the spectores of the past
Drizzling rain the neon lights are screamin'
Memories will capture me at last
