Far away so many years ago
We spent our time to stay together
One for all and all for one we took our ride
On a journey to the heart of

Fire
Desire

A chain reaction of bad attitudes
See the wall of disappointment
So deep inside you felt left in the lurch
There's no way for you to turn back

From hidin'
From cryin'

And we sail on the seven seas
On the quest of our life
Our deeds of insanity
Are concealed from the seven seas

Illumination after thunderstorms
My hope of change a deep desire
Broken childhood but always blood on blood
Send me a light away from sorrow

Heal me

Gimme shelter gimme rain
Feel the ground it's dry again
Wash the tears, wash the pain
Could it ever be the same
Gimme shelter from the rain
Let the flowers grow again

It could have been a matter of time
Finding a way from the tears
Back to the dreams we had in our minds
Standin' in the rain
We only had to follow the line
So far away from the tears
Back to the start before we're drifting apart
Standin' in the rain
