Seen you out there on my way
Coming home from a hard working day
It's just your face I felt so close to I know, I know
I tried to get through to you

Should be with you every night and day
Illusions calling, time's ticking away

Tradition's calling our names
The world's changing, it will never be the same
What they call difference, I can't get through
What can be different in what love can do

Two worlds collide
Like you and me
Without a sight of tragedy
Finding good ways without tears
Will take some days and some more years
Two worlds collide
Like you and me
Without a sound of elegy
Finding good ways without tears
Will take some days and some more seven years
World keeps turning black and white
Can't you feel the heat, the night was always blind

See you flying on the wings of time
Every single minute will change one's mind
The storm is rising if we hold on to
Keepin' on flying will bring me back to you
