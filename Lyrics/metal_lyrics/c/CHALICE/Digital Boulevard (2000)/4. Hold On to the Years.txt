Hand in hand we walked the line
Hand in hand we kept our smile
Friends should always act like friends
Walkin' together hand in hand

Storyteller's got it right
Read the reasons between the lines

Hold on to the years
Don't think about time
(Let's take our time)
It could be my last goodbye
(There will be no reason why)
Hold on to the years
You will stay in my mind
(You're here in my mind)
Don't say your last goodbye

Soul to soul we lived our life
Soul to soul we always tried
Tryin' to pretend a heart of stone
Only reminds me of soul to soul

My mind runs dry
It only matters how to survive
