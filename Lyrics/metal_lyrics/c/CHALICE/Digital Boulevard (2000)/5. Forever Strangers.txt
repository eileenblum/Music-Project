I've seen your picture
It's in the news today
They had just told you
Your love had passed away

Peggy's cove is a quiet and romantic place
60 people usually live there
The scenery now has changed in a tragical way
Hollywood reporters live on air

A thousand questions still remain
The voice-recorder can't explain

Why him? Why did he have to take part in this flight?
Why her? Did she ever cause trouble?
Peggy's cove - the most frightful place tonight
When you're alone and the ones you loved are gone

I read the news and I saw your eyes
Your look has touched me deep inside
I wish you strength tonight

Strangers - We must be forever strangers
Don't look inside
Passengers on earth - We try to change it
From heaven into hell
We live our lives - In pride and danger
You're on my mind, but
Strangers - We will be forever strangers
Don't try to break the spell

I've read your story
It's in the news today

Looking back - what kind of life did you have
Looking back - was it all worth it?
From 24 to a far too early death
Suffering from pain and from distress

Living in another world
Break the limits, stop the hurt
Life can be absurd
(And I wish I'd known you)

I know you well or at least
I thought I did I am familiar with fame and failure
And I was there when you cried just a little bit
You loved the wrong one and I could have saved you

But then you're miles and miles away
You are tomorrow and I am today
I'm here today

I have a picture of you inside my head
I'd rather paint somebody else instead
