I see your eyes
A little candle makes 'em burn
My secret lies
Put out the fire deep inside
I fear the shadows of the night
I see those tears
The sea you've cried was filled with sand
All through the years
Again, again

We always relied on you
Like a trainer of a tiger should never do

I see your face
What can be wrong
Don't you know our love was strong
Should we ever together take a walk away
(Should we save it by taking another day)
I see your face
The tears have gone
Did we go on together too far

You hear my lies
That whispering voice within your head
Open your eyes
You'll see that sound that makes us cry
I fear the silence of the night
Can't find no ways
The sand was washed out by the sea
All through the days
Again, again

Spread your wings and fly
You're livin' on the edge
Fly into the sky
But hold on to the edge
