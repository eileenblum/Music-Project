Ridin' on the highway
On my route 64
Every single minute
I can't take no hurt anymore

I gotta stand right here in the fire
Cold as ice with that gun in my hands
Far away from the enemy's water
Just as hard as a man only understands

Always and forever on the run
I see that sign on the wall
Just got to walk through that door
With a bullet and a gun
Always and forever on the run
I see that sign on the wall
Just got to walk through that door
Reaching for a higher level again

Ridin' on the highway
Back in real life again
Nobody here to remind me
Of the needs, I always pretend

But I can't see myself in the mirror
I'm afraid of these hurts they can do
I fear that street life, that punch, can't get it out of my head
I see my life passing by as only waterloos

I'm just a media cowboy
Nothing's too strong to make me stay
My challenge of tomorrow
Is twice as much as I'll reach today
