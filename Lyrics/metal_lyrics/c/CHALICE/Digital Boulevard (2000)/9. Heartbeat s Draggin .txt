Do you think that you have found the right way
In working 9 to 5 everyday

Have you ever seen the end of the light
Never ever dreamin'

Just before the night is calling
Freedom comes back into life, just right now

I stop waiting
My heartbeat's dragging in time
New life should be more than a lie
I can't wait no more while
The time has come to say our goodbye

Do you know what the Monday-parties can do
What does living without Fridays mean to you
Remember old school days, enjoy the same way
Whole day dreamin'

From the time the day is dawning
Freedom comes back into life, it's over

Feel the life
Wake up
Come on, get up
It's not too late
Take the chance
