I see you in the morning
I keep on tryin' just to make up my mind
I hear you grumblin' while I'm facing the day
Our mental spasm in the morning light

Now you see me, now you don't
It feels like slippin' away
Let's keep on tryin' day by day
To find a way for crawling away from here

Today, tonight and forever
We play that dangerous game
We take the chance now or never
(We take our last chance together)
But we know we're far away from pain
(But I know we're always far from pain)

I see you in the evening
I keep on tryin' just to find the right words
Telling you the reason why you'll be alone
Some seven evenings while I'm free as a bird

We're movin' in circles
From the very first ray of light
To the stars that light up heaven
In a world that's full of lies

Moving in circles
Far away from the fantasy land
We gave our promise to stay
Together hand in hand
Never coming to an end To an end
