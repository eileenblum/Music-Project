You see city lights
That light up the horizon
Deep colours fill your mind
You run through the streets
Your sea with no islands
A virtual defeat

In a world full of hast
Without recreation
Your "Eden" comes alive
Beautiful and clean Big infatuation
No longer just a dream

You fight the fight again
No real frames to follow
Virtuality that wins
Reality's falling

You are lost again on digital boulevard
You'll pay the price, my friend, for digital boulevard
You're lost again on digital boulevard
Forever you'll be free on digital boulevard
So welcome to the show

You're caught in a game
Of modern temptations
Captured by your mind
A life in a world
Where reality's fadin'
Waiting for a sign
