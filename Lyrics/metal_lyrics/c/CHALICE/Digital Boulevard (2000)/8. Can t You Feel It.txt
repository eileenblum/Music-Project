I say there's no tomorrow
There will be danger everyday
Money increases sorrow
Sold out hearts to buy a little light - on my way

You cannot live without my grace
You won't dare to claim with your heart

Can't you feel it
Do you know what's on my mind - A devil inside
Can't you see me
I am always at your side - Watch out for the light

Can't you hear me
Solitary voices from behind - Deep inside
Can't you feel me
I 'm already in your mind

You see me on your TV
My voice is always in your head
You'll never really see me
My lies are drivin' you insane, oh yeah

Shadows fallin' down on you
I see you there, no claim anywhere

I'm your Jesus lovin' intermedial saviour
