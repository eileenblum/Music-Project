Twilight is crawling into the streets
The sky is getting bright
Spots of fallen rain playing looking glass
The fragile witnesses of rainy nights

When city-lights are fading out
A new morning is fading in
Just another day to fight the fight
Means another chance to win

The rain is gone
The rain is gone

They leave their houses as work's to be finished
Some go to bed as the daily nightshift is done
Some girls stand up interrupting their job
Bad and sad hide behind golden rays of the sun

Poor prospects are suddenly promising
Missing links are gonna be found
Sunlight enables people to see
And shades tormenting thoughts
