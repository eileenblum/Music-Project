[originally by Spazz]Suppress, censor, criticize, constant inconsistency
Suppress, censor, criticize, rampant stupidity
Suppress, censor, criticize, endless hypocrite
Suppress, censor, criticize

Ever changing guidelines, flexible values
An army of "yes men" under your thumb
A clique a lackeys molded into
Impressionable clones with minds gone numb
No need to sweat when the old days come back
PCC backlash, tuneless recycled trash
Bible elitism, playing favorites at a whim
Intolerant tolerance

Don't play their game, only play by mine
Musical storm troopers marching double-time
But the captain always goes down with the ship
