Leaders force them to fight their wars
Never knowing what it was for

Forced to their wars
Casualty high score

Forced to their wars
Casualty high score
Forced to their wars
Human greed is a bore

Call to the irons
Tank war stallions
Call to the irons
Thousand bombs explode
Call to the irons
Never knowing why
Call to the irons
Profit is made!
