Demand a change
But not moving at all

Self chosen poverty â story remains the same
Criticism Capital â but living of its wasts

More patches than a hobo could buy
Can't get off your ass but call yourself DIY
More patches than a hobo could buy
Pretend to live ethics but only in it for the fashion
More patches than a hobo could buy
Wearing more patches than a hobo could buy
