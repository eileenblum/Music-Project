I walk the world by myself.
I got this soul that I can't sell

Casting stones again like you want.
Like the empty heart left in my chest.
I'll leave you here.
I'm too far gone.
This is moving on.

I don't wanna be
(I don't wanna be).
I don't wanna be the reason you can't feel anymore.

I can't see you.
I can't breathe.
In the back of your car, you made me believe.
I'm the failure.
And the disease.

I'm the con to your score.
Just a pawn on your board.

I walk the world by myself.
Striking matches just to watch them burn.
I've got a soul that I can't sell in Hell I'm running out.

I can't see you.
I can't breathe.
In the back of your car, you made me believe.
I'm the failure.
And the disease.

I'm the con to your score.
Just a pawn on your board.
(Oh oh oh whoa, Oh oh oh whoa).
I'm the con to your score.
Just a pawn on your board.
(Oh oh oh whoa, Oh oh oh whoa).
Just a pawn on your board.

I don't wanna be
(You don't have to be).
I don't wanna be this man anymore.

I can't see you.
I can't breathe.
In the back of your car, you made me believe.
I'm the failure.
And the disease.

I'm the con to your score.
Just a pawn on your board.
(Oh oh oh whoa, Oh oh oh whoa).
I'm the con to your score.
Just a pawn on your board.
(Oh oh oh whoa, Oh oh oh whoa).
Just a pawn on your board.

I walk the world by myself.
I got this soul that I can't sell.
