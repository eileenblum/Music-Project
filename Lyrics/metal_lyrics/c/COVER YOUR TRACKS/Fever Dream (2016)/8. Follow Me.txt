Why would I want to wake up again?
Close my eyes and fall in the abyss.
What happens next the moment after now?
Will you stand up again or quietly bow out?

Follow me as we fall into the fray.
Follow me I've got one foot in the grave.
Let it go, just give in.
We are helpless in the end.
Follow me as we fall into the fray.

Clinging to the ties of a boring life.
Go back to your job of wasting all your time.

Follow me as we fall into the fray.
Follow me I've got one foot in the grave.
Let it go, just give in.
We are helpless in the end.
Follow me as we fall into the fray.

Fight for what's always fleeting.
To live a life with some meaning.
Let it go.
You'll never win.
Watch your grave start filling in.
What's the point in believing?

Follow me as we fall into the fray.
Follow me as we fall into the fray.

Follow me as we fall into the fray.
Follow me I've got one foot in the grave.
Let it go, just give in.
We are helpless in the end.
Follow me as we fall into the fray.

Why would I want to wake up again.
Close my eyes and fall in the abyss?
