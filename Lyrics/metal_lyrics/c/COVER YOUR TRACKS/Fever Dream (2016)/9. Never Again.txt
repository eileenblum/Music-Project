I drank the blood, it never went to waste.
Exaggerated but I love the taste.
Now it's gone, now it's gone but here I am.
Bleeding out, bleeding out until you're fed.

Never again, your time has passed.
You left me for dead, no turning back.
Now I see nothing around me.
You're disappearing.
Never again.

Stuck in the desert with a snake in my hand I realize that it's my only friend.
Sink it in.
Take it in but I'm not dead.
Bleeding out, bleeding out.

Never again, your time has passed.
You left me for dead, no turning back.
Now I see nothing around me.
You're disappearing.
Never again.

And if the sun doesn't rise.
How will you get through the night?
Another victim in view, wolves surrounding you.
If the sun doesn't rise.
How will you get through the night?
Another victim in view, wolves surrounding you.

One part venom.
Two parts favor.
One more victim in their view.
These wolves are surrounding you.

Never again, your time has passed.
You left me for dead, no turning back.
Now I see nothing around me.
You're disappearing.
Never again.
Never again.

I drank the blood, it never went to waste.
Exaggerated but I love the taste.
