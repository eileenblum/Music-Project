There's a voice in my head and he's already dead.
There's a voice in my head.
I feel it in my skin.

Soon as I'm looking out I know it's staring in.
Though I see nothing there I feel it breaking in.
I can feel it in my skin.

Set your demons free.
Let them dance and sing.
Let them bellow straight from the bottom.
Set you demons free.
Let them pour their drinks.
Let them drown inside the bottle.

Are you ready to lie.
Are you ready to bleed.
Are you ready to sacrifice for me.

I'm gonna make you steal.
Gonna make you cheat.
Gonna drive you to hell and back with me.

There's no deal with the Devil, only fire.
There's no deal with the Devil, only fire.

Set your demons free.
Let them dance and sing.
Let them bellow straight from the bottom.
Set you demons free.
Let them pour their drinks.
Let them drown inside the bottle.

Fire.
Light it up.
Strike a match with me.
Play with fire.
Light it up.
Strike a match with me.

There's no deal with the Devil, only fire.

Set your demons free.
Let them dance and sing.
Let them bellow straight from the bottom.
Set you demons free.
Let them pour their drinks.
Let them drown inside the bottle.

None of this even counts.
Cause we're finally free now

Set you demons free.
Let them dance and sing.
Let them bellow straight from the bottle.
Inside the bottle.
