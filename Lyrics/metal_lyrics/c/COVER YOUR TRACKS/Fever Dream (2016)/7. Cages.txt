These cages keep us separated.
They turn us into something we're not.

The light reflecting what we see.
Is shaping all that we believe.
What happens now when it burns out?
Were too far gone can't be saved.
Dismantle the machine to which we've all become the slave.

These cages keep us separated.
They shape us into something we're not.
These cages that we have created.
They keep us hiding in the dark.

All these lights and sounds are why we're broken.
Escaping what they say was golden.
Forget their voice.
Regret the words.
The ones we never spoke or heard.
We watch the future, voiceless to the world.

Because these cages keep us separated.
They shape us into something we're not.
These cages that we have created.
They keep us hiding in the dark.

Cause now we're too far gone.
Cause now we're too far gone.

These cages keep us separated.
They shape us into something we're not.
These cages keep us separated.
They shape us into something we're not.
These cages that we have created.
They keep us hiding in the dark.
