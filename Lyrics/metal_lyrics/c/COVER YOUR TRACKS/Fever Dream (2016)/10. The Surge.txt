He looked up to the sky and he screamed.
Where's my fucking miracle if you're really a king?
He takes a breathe at the edge of the sea.
Pleading for his life to matter more.
Waiting for an answer or a cure.
Begging for the surge to wash him from the shore.

Don't wake me.
Break me out of this grave that I dug.
I'm waiting.
Praying.
But when will enough be enough.

Will I ever find peace in this place?
The house of the damned is my only escape.
What's this grace and why can't I believe?
There's purpose in this process that only you can see.
Only you can see.
(Only you can see).

Don't wake me.
Break me out of this grave that I dug.
I'm waiting.
Praying.
But when will enough be enough.
