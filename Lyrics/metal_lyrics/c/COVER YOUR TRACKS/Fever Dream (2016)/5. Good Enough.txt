You're sleeping on the ground.
You make yourself the enemy, a syndrome in the sound.
Oh I can't believe.
You found yourself a life.
You built yourself a family, fostered by the lie.
Don't stop or they'll see.

You're trapped, trapped in your lies.
You're king, king of you're not good enough.
But are you good enough.
You're trapped, trapped in your lies.
You're king, king of you're not strong enough.
But are you strong enough to see you're alive.

You've broken your way in.
They love the new celebrity, just hiding in your skin.
Oh, I can't believe.
The mirrors that you find are worthless without reverie.
A face that looks like mine.
Don't stop or they see.

You're trapped, trapped in your lies.
You're king, king of you're not good enough.
But are you good enough.
You're trapped, trapped in your lies.
You're king, king of you're not strong enough.
But are you strong enough to see you're alive.
(Strong enough to see you're alive).

I'm living on the outside but faking every word.

You're trapped, trapped in your lies.
You're king, king of you're not good enough.
But are you good enough.
You're trapped, trapped in your lies.
You're king, king of you're not good enough.
But are you good enough.
You're trapped, trapped in your lies.
You're king, king of you're not strong enough.
But are you strong enough to see your alive.
