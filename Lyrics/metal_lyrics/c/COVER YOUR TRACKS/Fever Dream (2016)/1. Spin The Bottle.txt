I feel it peering out my eyes like there's another man inside.
Oh god I hope this isn't the demon living in me.
But every day it gets so hard that I can't hear.

I tried to let you know instead I let you go.
A broken bottle spinning round and round and round and round again.
I made you take the blame but we both know it's me.
A broken bottle spinning round and round and round and round again.

No, I think I'm losing all control, cause now I know I'm not alone.
Oh god what is this in me, a curse or just me.

I tried to let you know instead I let you go.
A boken bottle spinning round and round and round and round again.
I made you take the blame but we both know it's me.
A boken bottle spinning round and round and round and round again.

I will not sink into your hands.
I will not let you win.
I am the failure but you let me win.

I tried to let you know instead I let you go.
A broken bottle spinning round and round and round and round again.
I made you take the blame but we both know it's me.
A broken bottle spinning round and round and round and round again.
I made you take the blame but we both know it's me.
