All around the walls tempered eyes and ordinary picture perfect words.
Are we innocent, tell me are we innocent?

I can't shake thesd ghosts from my past.
It's not fair for me to ask.
I'm past the point of turning back.
Are we innocent, tell me are we innocent?

Oh you bleed the life from me.
I'll break your heart I guarantee.
So dig your knife inside of me.
Are we innocent, tell me are we innocent?

I'm keeping your secrets out of my reasons.
To build a new start.
We all fall apart.
I'm twisting the pieces, twisting the meaning.
Til' death do us part.
Let's take it back.
Burn it all down.

With my head against the wall I'll stay.
Stay inside and waste away.
How many times can you say, we're not innocent, none of us are innocent.

Throw it all away again.
Pray to god to play pretend.
How many nights can we depend on.
Being innocent, none of us are innocent.

I'm keeping your secrets out of my reasons.
To build a new start.
We all fall apart.
I'm twisting the pieces, twisting the meaning.
Til' death do us part.
Let's take it back.
Burn it all down.

Just a liar, just a liar.
In the fire, in the fire.
Let's take it back.
Burn it all down.

All around the walls.
Are we, are we innocent, tell me are we innocent?

I'm keeping your secrets out of my reasons.
To build a new start.
We all fall apart.
I'm twisting the pieces, twisting the meaning.
Til' death do us part.
Let's take it back.
Burn it all down.
