Get up, get up.
We got lives at stake.
You won't regret it.
Every minutes got a lot to take.
Another moments about to pass.
Get up and find yourself awake.

I shouldn't have to ask.
For rhyme or reason.
You're married to the past.
You cheat the meaning.

Lights out.
Why don't you close the coffin?
Lights out.
Why don't you lie inside.
Paralized by your own reflection.
Lights out.
Already dead inside.

Get up, get up.
We got lives at stake.
You won't regret it.
Every minutes got a lot to take.

Wasted youth, wasted time.
Floating through a shallow dose of wasted life.

Don't waste my time.
No more calling home.
Yeah you can beg but you're on your own.
No more calling home.
Yeah you can beg but you're on your own.

Lights out.
Why don't you close the coffin?
Lights out.
Why don't you lie inside.
Paralized by your own reflection.
Lights out.
(Lights out).

Find your grave so you can lie inside.
Lie inside.
(Lights out).
Find your grave so you can die inside.
Die inside.
Find your grave so you can lie inside.
Lie inside.

Lights out.
Why don't you close the coffin?
Lights out?
Why don't you lie inside?
Paralized by your own reflection.
Lights out.
Already dead inside.

Lights out.
Why don't you close the coffin?
Lights out.
Why don't you lie inside?
Paralized by your own reflection.
Lights out.
Already dead inside.
