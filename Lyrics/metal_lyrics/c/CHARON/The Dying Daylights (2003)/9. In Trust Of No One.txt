[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Your lover is dead in your game.
Rush to nowhere in a land of crippled lies.
Call me jesus and they'll crucify.
Blood is blood when a word can tear you down.
Burn you to ashes with the look.
Love to make you the queen of godless, queen of godless

Pain is pain when a world will bring you down.
Turn to tame my will as you crave.
Scent of a game in a world beyond my touch.
Called you angel and they crucified.

In trust of no one the treason is wearing your name.
Your life is a desperate game.
This I believe in,
The stronger my faith fades away,
(Your lover is dead in yourâ¦)

This I believe in,
The stronger my faith fades away,
Your lover isâ¦ dead

In trust of no one the treason is wearing your name.
(Your life is a desperate game)
This I believe in,
The stronger my faith fades away
(Your lover is dead in your game)

Your lover is dead in your game
Your lover is dead in your game
Your lover is dead in your game
