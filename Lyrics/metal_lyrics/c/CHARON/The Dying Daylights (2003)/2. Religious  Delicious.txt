[Music: LeppÃ¤luoto/SipilÃ¤, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Can't turn away,
The only way is a river,
And you know that it drowns,
A wolf in disguise,
I see you trough but you're running.
Angel in disgrace,
You won't give your soul to the devil but you know that you can.

Cold where I roam,
Tie these broken bones,
Your every finger burns like salt in the wounds.

Religious child,
Delicious in black when you're falling yet you know that it's true.
A wolf in your eyes,
Shade of moon lighten in you.
Desire.
You can't give your soul to the devil but you know that you will.

Cold where I roam,
Tie these broken bones,
Your every finger burns like salt in the wounds.
Breath from your veins,
Let me bathe from you,
Your every word cuts deeper inside my skin.

The cruelty is ice and the pain starts from fire,
This I swear (this I swear)
This I swear (this I swear)
Love is the guest in the house of a death,
This I swear (this I swear)
This I swear (this I swear)

Cold where I roam,
Tie these broken bones,
Your every finger burns like salt in the wounds.
Breath from your veins,
Let me bathe from you,
Your every word cuts deeper inside my skin.
