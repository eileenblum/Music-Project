[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

These hollow,
These hollow grounds,
Breathing every step inside that sorrow.
And I lied, and I lied that you would survive.
These weeping, these weeping times lasts for years yet you're the one to
face it and I lied,
And I lied that we would be fine.

Rush that I've already killed,
Lust that I've already spilled on you,
Your eyes made me crave for this.

Strange shivers in strange ways tonight,
Something passed the joy that I've collected and I felt,
And I felt all beauty's dead.
This weeping, this weeping nights lasts forever yet I'm the one to face it
and I felt,
And I felt all cruelty's done.

She dances the dark side of the moon,
She's overdose,
The beauty in cold.

Cold,
Just to feel that I'm alive,
Just to feel the guilt on skin.
Your blood,
Your flesh makes me crave for this.
This rush that I've already killed, the lust that I've already spilled on
you.
Your eyes made me crave for this.

Cold,
Just to feel that Iâm alive,
Just to feel the guilt on skin.
Your blood,
Your flesh makes me crave forâ¦

Cold,
Just to feel that Iâm alive,
Just to feel the guilt on skin.
Your blood,
Your flesh makes me crave for this.

This rush that Iâve already killed,
The lust that Iâve already spilled on you
Your eyes made me crave for this.
