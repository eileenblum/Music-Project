[Bonus Track]I'm slowly catching a piece of my life
Intention brakes the plan to rebirth
Craving the unknown itself drives me off the line I've been in
For more that I crave

It's just an illusion made by myself
It's hunger it's desperation itself
Love was the answer and i seek no more
And pain the illusion i built for my ghosts

I'm slowly awakening back to this hour
Rush the king has come to his end
Playing with the pieces of faith
Deceives the hunger for more that I crave, for more that I crave

It's just an illusion made by myself
It's hunger it's desperation itself
It's hunger, illusion, it's desperation to seek myself
It's hunger, illusion, it's desperation to seek myself

[Solo]

It's just an illusion made by myself
It's hunger it's desperation itself
It's hunger, illusion, it's desperation to seek myself
It's desperation to seek myself
