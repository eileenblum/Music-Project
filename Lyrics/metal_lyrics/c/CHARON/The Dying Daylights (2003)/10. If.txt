[music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

How frail you are?
Dreams are hollow if you fall,
Can you take this from yourself,
Love the race you faced,
Yet it's done and you're not here and end of the line stands:

'If I die alone',
Won't you bring me to the one who said;
'It's done',
when I loved no one.
And if you try the same,
Let me guide you to the place I drowned my past and I'll show you why.

Rain like a sigh,
Falling needles on my path.
Can you swear these words unspelled,
Love the race you made
yet itâs done and youâre not here and end of the line stands...

âIf I die aloneâ,
Wonât you bring me to the one who said;
âItâs doneâ,
When I loved no one.
And if you try the same,
Let me guide you to the place I drowned my past and Iâll show you why.

[Solo]

âIf I die aloneâ,
Wonât you bring me to the one who said;
âItâs doneâ,
When I loved no one.
And if you try the same,
Let me guide you to the place I drowned my past and Iâll show you why.
