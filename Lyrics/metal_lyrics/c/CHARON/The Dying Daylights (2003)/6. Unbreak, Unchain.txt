[music: SipilÃ¤, Hast &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Burning makes it heal,
Covers me not to feel you,
Innocence of frail.
Turn to face again the tamer's eye that haunts you.
Turn to disappear.

Unbreak,
Unchain.
Leave no remorse to call your name,
Crush on your slave.
Unbreak,
Unchain.
You are the saint to seal my grave,
Crush on your slave.

Chased by shadows tail,
Grip like led it follows,
Innocence can't fail.
Night has struggled in,
Lovers separated.
They are you and I.

Unbreak, unchain.
You are the saint to seal my grave,
Crush on your slave.

Could this be what it seems?
Painted in your dream.

[Solo]

Unbreak, unchain.
Leave no remorse to call your name,
Crush on your slave.
Unbreak, unchain.
You are the saint to seal my grave,
Crush on your slave.
