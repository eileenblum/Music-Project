[Music: LeppÃ¤luoto/Sipilä, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Bloodshot eyes nearly open I reach the skies,
You dance like a feather (you're in my dream).
Gravity can kill but falling is cure,
Feels like heaven has turned to hell.

No bless for thousand miles,
No fragile wings to speed us,
Know how frail my world can turn into lovers leap.
You're still my dream and fear,
You made me light my fire,
Know how lust can lead from here to the lovers kill.

Cold before your voice took the piece of the night,
Pierced by an arrow (I'm in your dream).
Hesitation kills and the speed is cure,
Feels like the moon is full and now we're chasing more.

No bless for thousand miles,
No fragile wings to speed us,
Know how frail my world can turn into lovers leap.

Youâre in the spin and it feeds you,
Youâll find,
Death can dance.
Youâre in the spin and it feeds you,
Youâll find,
Death can dance.

No bless for thousand miles,
No fragile wings to speed us,
Know how frail my world can turn into lovers leap.
Youâre still my dream and fear,
You made me light my fire,
Know how lust can lead from here to the lovers kill.
