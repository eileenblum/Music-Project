[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

There's left no love inside,
There's left no righteous life but the hate is strong and stains the path I
roam.
There's right and there is wrong, yet I chose the one I'm on.
To the hell and back where life is gone.

And it's all to make you worth of dying,
Worth of something like you!
We keep falling down like summer rain
We keep falling down like summer rainâ¦

These wounds are deep enough to make me feel alive.
Youâre no saint I saw it from your eyes.
Can I taste this bitter fame?
Can I bless this bitter race?
To the hell and back where we belong.

And itâs all to make you worth of dying,
Worth of something like you!
We keep falling down like summer rain
We keep falling down like summer rainâ¦

[Solo]

And itâs all to make you worth of dying,
Worth of something like you!
We keep falling down like summer rain
We keep falling down like summer rainâ¦

Down,
Down,
Down like the summer rain,
Away from winterâs bane.

Down,
Down,
Down like the summer rain,
Away from winterâs bane.

Down,
Down,
Down like the summer rain,
Away from winterâs bane.

Down,
Down,
Down like the summer rain,
Away from winterâs bane.
