[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto / HautamÃ¤ki]

Race,
The evil haunts you,
The night is through and tomorrow loves to watch you die.
The sin of godless,
Trails to the scent of us and you are drowned in the lust.

The unknown,
Grim and bleak and this blight of life becomes a crimson strife.
The sin of loveless caused by a need to escape,
Escape to'

Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever faced will take you down.
Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever embraced will haunt you,
Haunt you like it's part of you.

(Rain)

Raise your head for the last time,
This life is through no tomorrow to greet my wretched smile.
The scorn of the godless,
Born of a virgin whore escapes to'

Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever faced will take you down.
Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever embraced will haunt you,
Haunt you like itâs part of you.

Canât bring desire,
But youâll feel the night,
Canât feed the fire that you are,

The sweet delusion,
Still you feel the night.

Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever faced will take you down.
Every little pain that rains to black our skies,
Every little pain you have ever embraced will haunt you,
Haunt you like itâs part of you.
