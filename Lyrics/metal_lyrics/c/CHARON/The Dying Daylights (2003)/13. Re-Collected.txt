[Bonus Track]These are the words that thrilled you
Got you to the place we drowned
The faith won't last for long
These are the words that killed you
Got you off your dreams
The same old pain suites on

And the temptress in you gave breath to me

Re-collected the ashes of trust
All those dreams forgotten and lost

The sign of the dog that feeds you
With the poison of grace
Nothing left to face
These are the lies that killed you,
Got you off your dreams
The same old pain suites on.

Re-collected the ashes of trust
All those dreams filled with pain and disgust
My soul bled with every single breath that I collected.
The ashes of trust

Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah

Re-collected the ashes of trust
All those dreams filled with pain and disgust
My soul bled with every single breath that I collected.
The ashes, the ashes of trust.
