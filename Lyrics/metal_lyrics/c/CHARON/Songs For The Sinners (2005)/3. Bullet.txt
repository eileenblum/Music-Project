[Music: Charon, lyrics: J-P LeppÃ¤luoto]

She can not be tamed, my illusion I can dream again
Shattered down below, she can take it yet remains the sane
Come again sweet delight, roam again weep within
Sorrow left me cold, you bring me away from the shame

Saw a flash before the bullet
Meet the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted someone else

Saw a flash before the bullet
Meet the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted someone else

Return my inner fire, rewoken warmth of undivine
So these separated times gave me embrace 'till we died
Without my tense desire I could not even try
Have I been deranged, it never felt this real

Saw a flash before the bullet
Meet the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted someone else

Saw a flash before the bullet
Meet the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted someone else

I will not give in to someone inside me

Saw a flash before the bullet
Meet the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted someone else

Saw a flash before the bullet
Meet the shadow which I thought could be my own
Once again I trusted someone else

Trusted someone else
Trusted someone else
Trusted someone else
