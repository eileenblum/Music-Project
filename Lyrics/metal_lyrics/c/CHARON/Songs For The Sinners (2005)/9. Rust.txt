[Music: Charon, lyrics: J-P LeppÃ¤luoto]

Lost inside yet I found what brought me here
Deep where despair has its home
Breathless child with the scars prevent to grow

Sweet denial I caress

Dislike myself, so now I know why this broken thorn
You bring me rain, the rust in veins
Dislike myself, so now I know why this broken thorn
You bring me hate, the state I'm in

Built these walls to gain secrecy from inside
The bliss engraved to my eyes
Bearded this load to find pieces of my soul
Yet sweet denial I caress
And all the mercy drains away tonight
All the mercy drains while I sigh...

[Solo]

Dislike myself, so now I know why this broken thorn
You bring me rain, the rust in veins
Dislike myself, so now I know why this broken thorn
You bring me hate, the state I'm in

Dislike myself, so now I know
You bring me hate, the state I'm in
