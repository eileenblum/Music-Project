[Music: Charon, lyrics: J-P LeppÃ¤luoto]

Peace behind your eyes is nothing I admire
Revealed, devoted to something you can't hide
In to the darkest hour she cast upon her roam
Haven't you learned how this went too far
Has it been a sin, the wait on me and more than I could reap

Slow where it sleeps forevermore, buried in frail dreams
Buried in deep water, built in me

A song for lost desire to make it all come alive
Revealed, devoted to something you can't hide
Slowly breathing in what they have praised to still
Haven't they learned how this went too far
The wait on me, the more than I could reap

Slow where it sleeps forevermore, buried in frail dreams
Buried in deep water, built in me

Where it sleeps forevermore, buried in frail dreams
She's on for the everlast scum-desire and the lust will burn her eyes
Free round in heaven and back to hell, where the courage blows the horns

Slow where it sleeps forevermore, buried in frail dreams
Buried in deep water, built in me
Where it sleeps forevermore, buried in frail dreams
