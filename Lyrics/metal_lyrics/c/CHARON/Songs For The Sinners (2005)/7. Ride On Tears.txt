[Music: Charon, lyrics: J-P LeppÃ¤luoto]

I can be the one who will lead you through the godless run
I give you all I am, take the sinner down to feed desire

Forever and forever I shall crawl

So it's insecure that light will shine on you
At least I'll give you dark delight

Ride on tears ride on hollow fears against the endless carnival of lust
(Forever and forever I shall crawl)
Ride on tears ride on boulevard that leads you to mourn

Buried in your pride silence reflects all that you disguised
Carrying bliss inside forevermore it haunts the restless ones

Forever and forever I shall crawl

So it's insecure that light will shine on you
At least I'll give you dark delight

Ride on tears ride on hollow fears against the endless carnival of lust
(Forever and forever I shall crawl)
Ride on tears ride on boulevard that leads you to mourn

[Solo]

Ride on tears ride on boulevard that leads you to mourn
Leads you to mourn!

Ride on tears ride on hollow fears against the endless carnival of lust
(Forever and forever I shall crawl)
Ride on tears ride on boulevard that leads you to mourn

Ride on tears ride on hollow fears against the endless carnival of lust
(Forever and forever I shall crawl)
Ride on tears ride on boulevard that leads you to mourn
Leads you to mourn!
