[Music: Charon, lyrics: J-P LeppÃ¤luoto]

Frail as ice I shall rise for the repent you've been haunting for
Devil's smile beneath the eyes I caress
Pierced to be nothing but me in the everlasting race of hate
We're blessed to breath yet I can't see why me

Wish I'd never be

Nothing more than breeze within your name
Never be the storm that built me flesh and take me away from oblivion
Nothing more than breeze within your name
Never be the storm that built me flesh and take me away from oblivion

Bring me love, bring me hate I can't use them anyway
Sterilized blood of Christ won't taste
Shoot me bury me hundred times, what difference does it make
We're blessed to breath, oh I can't see why me

Wish I'd never be

Nothing more than breeze within your name
Never be the storm that built me flesh and take me away from oblivion
Nothing more than breeze within your name
Never be the storm that built me flesh and take me away from oblivion

So cold when someone's near
So cold without our tears yet nothing more to seek

Shoot me bury me hundred times
Shoot me bury me hundred times
Shoot me and take me away from oblivion

Nothing more than breeze within your name
Never be the storm that built me flesh and take me away from oblivion
Nothing more than breeze within your name
Never be the storm that built me flesh and take me away from oblivion
