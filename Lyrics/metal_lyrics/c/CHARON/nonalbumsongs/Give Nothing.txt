As blood is red the life is short
Like the sharpened blade demise this chord
So every wound that I cause never scars
As blood is red the pain is yours.. the pain is yours

It burns so deep
While I crave for more this dream
Touch my filth inside it turns you cold
It burns so deep
While I crave for more this dream
Touch my filth inside it turns you cold

Trust, free, seventeen and lost given wings
All the pleasure and pain this blade will bring
Feel me suffering yet I crave every moment I have
As blood is black the world is yours

It burns so deep
While I crave for more this dream
Touch my filth inside it turns you cold
It burns so deep
While I crave for more this dream
Touch my filth inside it turns you cold

It burns so deep
While I crave for more this dream
Touch my filth inside it turns you cold
It burns so deep
While I crave for more this dream
Touch my filth inside it turns you cold
