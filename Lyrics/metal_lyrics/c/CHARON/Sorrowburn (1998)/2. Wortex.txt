[Music: Hast &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Lepp√§luoto]

In the heart of night 
we spend the rest of our life's 
No VOICES no cry 
wortex taking each by time 
Roams with a burning candles 
faces without traces 
Inside of you I feel comfort 
when I'm not born. 

Feel my heart is not beating 
I swallow pain 
and crave for darkness 

In this sweat DESIGN OF NATURE 
deviance only by good 
From the body of angels 
to the infinite recurrence 
Rain shall replace my birth 
that will DEVOUR the love 
Inside of you I feel comfort 
...when I'm not born 

[Chorus]
