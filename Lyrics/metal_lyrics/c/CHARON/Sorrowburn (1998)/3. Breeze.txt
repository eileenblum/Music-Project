[Music: Sipilä &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Leppäluoto]

Scream out the word you hurt yourself 
I stand behind your lies 
Free all the false disguise 
that opens path behind your back 

Crawl down religious mind 
crawl in my hate esteem 
Smile face to face with death 
cry your weakness out in scaffold 

White seeps are killing black 
it won't desetve his head to keep 
Night resolves, night resolves 
the light will shine so dark 

Finally you realise that WATER DROWNS you 
wood can burst you 
Bleed in my arms, bleed in my arms 
another night and I'm  coming after you 

[Chorus]

I'm rain that falls. 
I'm wind that breezes. 
I'm shadow in your night. 
I'm weak.
