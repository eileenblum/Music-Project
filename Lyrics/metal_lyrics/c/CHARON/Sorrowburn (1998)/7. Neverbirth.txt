[Music: Leppäluoto &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Leppäluoto]

She's like a star for me, 
burning leafs burning me 
She's just a drop in the sea, 
and her eyes what I can't believe 
I think she's watching me 
with her eyes of seventeen 
Back to the shape of my shadow 
I use my skill to live 

Darkness my only friend, 
she must be slippin' away 
Closing me like a beam 
Shadows begin to fade, 
they're like a night and day 
She watch me slowly by 
Her spirit stronger than mine 
oh lord, how bored I am... 

She sucked me end to the end 
and way she speak was so...was so grand 
For that I ever represent 
dies with shadow of the dead. 

Then killed her best I can 
for the Love I hate 
I rape my will to be 
no longer hate no grief. 

Back to the shape of my shadow 
I shall once return 
And everything of me 
was NEVER aim to be... 
and everything of me 
was NEVER aim to be... 

[Repeat Chorus]
