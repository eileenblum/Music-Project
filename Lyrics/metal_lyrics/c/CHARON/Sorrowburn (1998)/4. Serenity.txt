[Music: Leppäluoto &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Leppäluoto]

Two of a kind for seven Mary's 
awaking darkest joys of pain 
Breath by a cold reaching the ecstacy 

Drown me with a blackended lust 
reach for up to the 7th moon 
Blessed pleasure for several souls 
serenity roams... 

Dream for the lust 
serenity roams 
Breath by a cold 
reaching the ECSTASY. 

Grace open the secrects through visions 
pouring lastly her wasted time 
FILTH covered under a PURE white silk 
...throne bleeds her last piece of a grace... 

Drown me with a blackended lust 
reach for up to the 7th moon 
Blessed pleasure for several souls 
SERENITY roams... 

Gods trial begins for her gate... of a death 
Breath by a lust, by a lust 
Seeds opens (take me) full of the flesh 
Her body cold as she rests...
