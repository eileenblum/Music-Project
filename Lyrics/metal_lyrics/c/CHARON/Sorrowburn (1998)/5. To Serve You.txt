[Music: Hast &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Lepp√§luoto]

For the love of the dark 
her body will burn 
For the lust she obey 
A frost in the heart she'll serve 
Feel the cold atmosphere... 
she was taken away 
With no one to grief 
one rose in her cheek 
as crow had croak. 

Stream flows inside 
with full of gain 
Repeating grief 
ascending the throne... (to serve You)
