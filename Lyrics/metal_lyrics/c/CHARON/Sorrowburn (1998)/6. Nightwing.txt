[Music: Hast &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Hautam√§ki]

Silent setting the nebulousness 
Ebon allurement a hint for fulfillment to come 

Tempting seduction 
And the empress whispers 
"Rush o son of Drayen for our guest 
is infinite 
Fly the night has fallen, emerge in dark 
for our time is short (so short) 
Let the wind carry thee on thy wings 
to find the light (nondivine) 
Search the blackrose of truth 
flovers of knowledge for me to come 

I run, I crawl, I haste, I prowl 
Crawl in filth son of skies 
That night (oh) so dark, the glimmer 
that arches over my soul where it dies 

Pouring the blood of the winged of light 
Inside my heart rages a radiant fire 

So I dance in twilight 
In the dimlight of morningstar 
Her dark eyes that glares so bright 
The mistress of my midnight
