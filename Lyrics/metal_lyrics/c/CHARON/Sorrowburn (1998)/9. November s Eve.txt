[Music: Sipilä &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Leppäluoto]

White dreams of sour relish 
four candles in VIRGINS nest 
Sweet rhyme of brook flows in our minds... we fly. 
Words in a cold frost eve, 
taken by the form of breeze 
Falling down before they get to known... the sough 

Drunken by a fierce of night 
and some who RECLAIMED my mind 
The dark is longer than we thought, so cold. 
Black snow shall fade our shapes 
roots of the oak EMBRACE 
Sweet rhyme of brook flows through our times, alive. 

A quiet pray, another day 
for the words that never said. 
November's eve, four of a breeze 
for the words that never feels, 
Forever we die, forever disdain 
in WHITE dreams of sour relish. 
Forever white, forever night 
loose love cleaves to a DARK.
