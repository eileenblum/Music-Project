[Music: Sipilä &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Leppäluoto]

My love in you 
purified in holy flesh 
Our shape blurred 
by the frame of hate 
Fly out from the edge of time... 

White, white 
goddes I sleep in you 

Reach me 
to the WINTER's calm 

White, white 
goddes I sleep in you 

Thy darkest trip 
ends in the SEASONS change
