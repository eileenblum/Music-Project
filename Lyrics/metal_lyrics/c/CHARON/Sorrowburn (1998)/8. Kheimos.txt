[Music: Hast &amp; Sipilä &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Hautamäki]

Internal night - I see your stars 
A blackended light - eternal scars 
Extinguished sky - storm arise 

Aeon of Aiyn 

Swirling winds greeds my end 
Time no more, cyclic vortex 
Around us 

So it has always been 
The undone and deceased 
never was and never 
The WILL and the FAITH 

So I have seen the gate is closed 
The region of SOUL for no one to know 
Behead the minions let the liquid life flow 

For what is a salvation for the wicked 
Samhains dew the blood of a slain god 
SPRING from the fountain of knowledge 

Coronation when the moon is full with blood 
Ordainer from ebon crown 
Wields the sceptre of the proud
