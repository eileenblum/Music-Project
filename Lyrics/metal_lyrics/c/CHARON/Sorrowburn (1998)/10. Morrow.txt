[Music: Leppäluoto &amp; CHARON Lyrics: Leppäluoto]

Hear them calling again 
I'm shedding no fear 
A roll of the dice 
hear you calling just twice... 

In the surface of pond 
believes and thoughts, 
dreams in the circle of light 
the truth will defame. 

Pride can defame 
possession is name 
The name of your life 
the same as your child. 

Will we come again 
from the dust at last 
A roll of the dice 
hear you breathing just twice... 

...tomorrow we die... 

The poem so neat 
so pure and weak 
Beloved by a breeze, 
singed through a tree 

...shall I LOVE thee like 
death LOVED me? 
In greed we fall, 
amorous soul...
