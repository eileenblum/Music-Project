My deepest scar is where they all see my despair.
Everything I build for you collapses to soon.
And I saw who you are, 
why I'm falling, falling in grace.

Everything I had from life were scars made by myself.
Everything I made were lies 'cause I can't love myself.
Everything is haunting me,
everything is everything and
dying wish through razor's kiss
'cause I can't love myself.

Oh, this weights on me,
I'll leave you to find what I was before.
From bedroom floor I'll leave like this ride is the last that I get for.
And I saw how it came.
