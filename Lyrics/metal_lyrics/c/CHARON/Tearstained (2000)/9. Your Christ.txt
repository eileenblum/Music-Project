I'm the witness of my life,
I'm story I'm the lie.
Twisted vision for your eyes.
I'm the shiver deep inside,
craving heart of life's despises.
I'm the gate for your demise just for your Christ.

Drown me over you.
You're under me.
Your suicide only for your:
Drown me over you.
You're under me.
Your suicide only for your Christ.

I'm the caster of your night,
I'm the morning, the light.
Saviour and capturer of your dawn.
I', the colour in your eyes,
I'm the crimson in your sky.
I'm the gate for your demise just for your Christ
