I hear my voice again.
It's longing for you.
And heart that is twisted and stained,
is crying relief to be burnt.

I hear your god is dying over again.
She is burning.
Mary, your eyes are bleeding.
Once again you are holy.

Oh, holy death that I gave.
I gave it all for you.
So full with tears and hate.
I save it all for you.
Oh, holy death I obey,
I'll give it all for me.
And echo that traces my voice is fading away.

I hear your god is dying over again.
She is burning.
Mary, your eyes are bleeding.
Once again you are holy.
Holy for her.
