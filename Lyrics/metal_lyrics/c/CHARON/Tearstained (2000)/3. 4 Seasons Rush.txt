Four seasons rush and time passed us by.
Christian heart so weak you stumbled to the dawn.
Grace and grief won't walk right hand by hand.
Your day was to go.
Cold heart too weak for beatin'.

Love is dead, and I just dragged you down to deep.
Cold and dead, last winter ripped my heart away.

Two days and night a hallow growth inside.
My six was your seven and pain was on the way.
Yeah, all those prayers were all to the hollow god.
Your day was to go.
Cold heart too weak for beatin'.

Love is dead, and I just dragged you down to deep.
Cold and dead, last winter ripped my heart away.

Rose on your grave, the only one alive.
A frozen leeve will cry red tears for you.
