On the seventh day
he arrived to stay,
a sky so grey opened up for him.
Like a hallow man,
he kneels down to pray without a shame, calling her name.

Christina bleeds.
The rope's caress, it's oh, so tight.
A hanged man's love the last despise.
Christina bleeds.
Rope is tight, so fucking tight.
Her fragile touch the last thing he felt.
And Christina bleeds.

As the evening crawls
she feels the loss when the wind weeps through,
the promise carved in cross.
In the evil dusk she disappear for the lust,
lost love that sears.
Christina bleeds.
