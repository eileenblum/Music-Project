Oh, the sun won't let me rest it burns and dries me out.
Your eyes like pearls in blood so staring when I:
Oh, time won't pay,
I won't pay as she breaks these chains when I'm falling down. 
I'll always,
I'll always,
I'll always feel like dying for you.

Oh. Glass of red deep wine I'll pour it all for you my god.
I'll choose my road for you.
I'll always make bed for two.
Oh, time won't pay,
I won't pay as she breaks these chains when I'm falling down.
I'll always,
I'll always,
I'll always feel like dying for:

you are my sin, my soul, my heart, my death and love to bury.
I'll always feel like dying for you.
