Her black hair on her face.
Covered eyes cries her life.
Dark and dim,
Bright and proud stays the same in hollow pain.
I'm loosin' all I had.
She's craving for her death.
Sorrow brings your grace down, bury me inside of you.
Memory makes you bleed again.
Blackened tear drops down her chest.
Fell her skin, so warm and soft.
Salty drops on her cheek.
Blackened wings wet and burnt.
Buried cold inside her soul.
I'm loosin' all I had.
She's craving for her death.
Sorrow brings your grace down,
bury me inside of you.
Memory makes you bleed again.
Blackened tear drops down her chest.

Last candle burnt down long before,
shattered words in a shape of pray.
Memory makes you bleed again.
Sorrow burns her wings again.
No matter where I lay, my feet won't carry me.
I'm asleep but I can't rest, so let me go now.
I'm loosin' all I had. I'm craving for my death.
