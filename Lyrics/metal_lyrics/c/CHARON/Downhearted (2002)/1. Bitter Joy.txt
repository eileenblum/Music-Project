[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

The shadows grow taller
A poison running through their hearts
A night to remember
Has come a night to crave desire for bitter joy

Intoxication makes you warmer to debauch
A lust in your veins now
Has come a point to crave desire

[Pre-chorus:]
My heart is all for open - for you two

[Chorus:]
Our love in sin
Our bitter joy
Three of a hearts now tangled
For the flash of a lust
Oh these wounds are hard to close for bitter joy
For bitter joy

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2x]

For bitter joy
For bitter joy
