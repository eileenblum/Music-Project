[Music: SipilÃ¤, Karihtala &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Eyes I'm looking for has come to weep all the sorrow
(all the sorrow you made)
Tears I couldn't dry, they burnt her heart for the sorrow
(for the sorrow you made)

[Chorus:]
She's the one who closed her eyes for all we lost
At the end of our day
She's the one who wish to cry but hold inside
All the sorrow, at the end of our day

Now is it life that makes you sad?
How did it take us this much apart?

Cold is creeping, I haunt myself to become one
(the one I used to be)
Leading me to find, they burnt our hearts for the sorrow
For the sorrow we gained

How did it take us this much apart?

[Chorus]
