[Music: Hast, SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Don't say a word,
Don't stay awake
Rest for a while,
For a life

Sleep quiet my heart,
I donât need you now
And it makes me want
And it makes me want to fall

[Chorus:]
Darkness calling,
Come to reap me from my love
I desire you,
For all my heart I've come to this

Burn slow my heart,
I won't weep you now
And it makes me want
And it makes me want to die

[Chorus]

Say one more prayer to fall desire (one more prayer to fall)
Save one more heartbeat to cry

[Chorus]

Uh-uh-uh
