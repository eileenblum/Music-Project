[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Is it oh so lonely,
Is it all so dark
Do I feel your warmth if we lay down breathless

Does it feel the same like
Taking a breath before I rest
You made me feel like I'm losin' this all for nothing

This is why I want you,
It's the deepest touch
It's the deepest lust and I hope the same for you

Come tonight, my saviour,
Cry tonight, my angel child
Read the lines I bleed
When I leave my heart to you

[Chorus 2x:]
Be my heart and my flame
Become my water
Marry pain within

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]

Be my heart and my flame
Become my water
Marry painâ¦
