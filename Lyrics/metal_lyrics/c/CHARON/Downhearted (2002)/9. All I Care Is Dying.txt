[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

It's something I scared,
It's something I scared a lot these days
It's something I had and something I lost

Already it hurts,
Already it places me to wait
To wait the day I had to pay

So hard to say,
So hard to say that it's too late
It's something I had and something I lost

It started to rain,
It started to rain from my veins
And all I give is worth of giving

[Chorus:]
All I care is dying
All I care is dying slow
Oh, why this pain inside,
When you're the one who's heart is burning down

[Chorus 2x]

[2x]
The one you are
The one you'll drown
The one who's heart is burning down
