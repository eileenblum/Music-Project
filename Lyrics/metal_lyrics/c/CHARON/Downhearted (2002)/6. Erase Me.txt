[Music: Hast &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

They wept for her six hundred days
Sway, sway her garden remains
They begged to repeat
A thousand ways

Pray, pray you got to repay
And she knows the suffering it takes
She begged for relief
Yeah, she called for me

(call for the night)

[Chorus:]
Embrace me, darling
Our shivers made you bleed for love to lose
Embrace me
You're cold as ice
Our hearts aren't weepin' no more

Anyone who heard you cry
Felt your anger inside
And they let you burn,
Oh, let her burn

Pray, pray you got to repay
And she knows all the suffering it takes
Come break these chains
Come have some pain

[Chorus]

Sway like fire in hell
Bound in heaven's door
But you want to get out
Want to get higher
Higher, higher in dying

[Chorus]

Erase me [4x]

[Solo]

Erase me [3x]
