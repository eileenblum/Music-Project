[Music: Hast &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Little angel your world can be so cruel
I set your wings on fire every night
I see you cry

Pain, I take it all and have some more (tonight)
Fire, it licks your skin but heart is cold
A heart that never beats for herself

[Chorus:]
Little angel your world can be so cruel
I set your wings on fire every night
I die for you every time
I see you cry

Rain, I shower in her drops of tear tonight
Oh for our hate, she craved no more but have it all
She took some pain and started again
Started to loose her life before my eyes

A heart that never beats for no one else

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

I see you cry
I see you cry
