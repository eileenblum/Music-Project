[Music: SipilÃ¤ &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

Let my body burn,
Let my body swirl around you
All around you
Let me come inside,
Let me be a part of you tonight
Come to taste myâcome to taste...

All we cried comes crawling back before it burns my world
Tonight we'll sing our sorrow, sing our sorrow song

Take me tonight
Sing our sorrow song
Die, sister, die
For love

You don't need to cry
I can show what it's like for you to spare
You from these pain
You're forever here,
You're forever here in my heart
And I love to die for you

All we cried comes crawling back before it burns my world
Tonight we'll sing our sorrow, sing our sorrow song

Take me tonight
Sing our sorrow song
Die, sister, die
Sing our sorrow song

Take me tonight
Sing our sorrow song
Die, sister, die
For love

[Solo]

Take me tonight
Sing our sorrow song
Die, sister, die
Sing our sorrow song

Take me tonight
Sing our sorrow song
Die, sister, die
