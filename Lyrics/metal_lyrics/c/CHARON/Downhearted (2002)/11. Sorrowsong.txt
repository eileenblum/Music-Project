[Music: LeppÃ¤luoto &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

This all you kept inside
Once you gave it all
Sorrow and despair
Took me where I belong
She was all I create
She was all I craved
Sorrow and despair
Made me feel this way

This way I'll choose like you
This heart I'll cease like you

White sheets around
Rose in her hands
And face alike she never had to cry
This all I need to tell
This all I had to weep
Tomorrow comes with peace
And peace is what I need
Inside my heart it rains
I crave no more to say

This way I'll choose like you
This heart I'll cease like you

White sheets around
Rose in our hands
And faces like we never had to cry
Rain fades today
It rained all our lives
Inside our hearts we never had to die
