[Music: Hast &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

You are the saviour without a saviour's crown
Till night is falling, it brings you down to sigh
I adore your blessing, there is no much to say
I'll be come your reason to feed the flame inside our hearts

You're all desire, you're all desire I haunt
Beat my heart, beat my heart to dry

[Chorus:]
Craving, haunting the ceased devotion
She's the one for me,
The cross I beg to see the path
When I don't want to stay

You are the reason to wipe my past away
Till night is falling I need no longer to breathe

Youâre all desire, youâre all desire I haunt

[Chorus]

I don't need to
I don't feel like cared
I don't need to breathe 'cause I know what is best for me

Craving, haunting the ceased devotion...

[Chorus]

I donât need to
I donât feel like cared
I donât need to
I donât feel like cared
I donât need to breathe 'cause I know what is best for me
