[Music: Hast &amp; Charon, lyrics: LeppÃ¤luoto]

The fall has come to hurt
Beloved I was sometimes downhearted

The hate inside my head speaks
The false, untrue disguise betray
My life is open wide
Decision comes in time

Easy for you tonight to die
Take my heart
Easy for you tonight to cry
Take my life

The words I kept inside, all lies
Revealed to see daylight
These wounds I tried to hide
Inside where all else dies

Easy for you tonight to die
Take my heart
Easy for you tonight to cry
Take my heart

And the fall came beatin' man to ground
And the sorrow cheatin' her to bleed
Till lies are all you have

[Solo]

Easy for you tonight to die
Take my heart
Easy for you tonight to cry
Take my life
