Mai Tai say that I'm Old Fashioned
TrÃ¨s Vin ordinaire
That I want a fresh Manhattan
With white anglo-saxons everywhere?
A Black Russian's
No Pink lady
Give her the Singapore sling!
And Moscow mule is not your baby
So Highball the Vodka and name your sting!
Be a Big shot
With a Bull shot
Be a Schwein
Mit der Wein!
Have a short
Or a Port
Or a snort
Of any sort!
Asti spumante â
Uno Chianti
Are divine!

I got some economic
Hocks
A Gin and tonic
On the rocks!
Where angels fear to tread, I
Say: Choose
Your booze!
Let's hit the Red eye!
Think of young Deanna Durbin
And how she sung on Rum and Bourbon
Or enhance your lunch-
Eon hour with a Planter's Punch
And a Whiskey sour!
If you feel like a wreck
Try a Horse's Neck
Or a Sherry
With a cherry
In the new fun size!

If you don't name your poison
I'll have to get the boys in
The spirit of adventure opens one's eyes!
If you don't name your poison
I'll have to get the boys in
And you'll never see another Tequila Sunrise!

Live happily ever after
With a Chablis and some laughter
"Between the Sheets" is lovely
With a dizzy blonde and a bottle of bubbly!
There's nothing sicker in society
Than a lack of liquor and sobriety!
So, down the hatch
Here's mud in your eye
Take a bracer
With a chaser
Wash it down with Rye!
Bottoms up!
Stirrup cup!

It'll put you in the pink
And all you have to do is
Drink, drink, drink, drink, driii-ink!
Drink, drink, drink, drink, driii-ink!
Drink, drink, drink, drink, driii-ink!
Drink, drink, drink, drink, driii-ink!
Driiiink!
Driiiink!
