Hear me now 
Oh thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base and debauched as can be
And a knight with his banners all bravely unfurled 
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee!

I am I, Don Quixote
The Lord of La Mancha â
My destiny calls and I go!
And the wild winds of fortune 
Will carry me onward
Oh whithersoever they blow!
Whithersoever they blow â
Onward to glory I go! 

Hear me, heathens and wizards 
And serpents of sin â 
All your dastardly doings are past!
For a holy endeavor is now to begin 
And virtue shall triumph at last! 

I am I, Don Quixote
The Lord of la Mancha â
My destiny calls and I go!
And the wild winds of fortune 
Will carry me onwar
Oh whithersoever they blow! 
Whithersoever they blow â
Onward to glory I go!

Ho!
