I was born under a wanderin' star
I was born under a wanderin' star

Wheels are made for rollin'
Mules are made to pack
I never seen a sight that didn't look better looking back.

I was born under a wanderin' star

Mud can make you prisoner
And the plains can bake you dry
Snow can burn your eyes
But only people make you cry
Home is made for comin' from
For dreams of goin' to
Which with any luck will never come true

I was born under a wanderin' star
I was born under a wanderin' star

Do I know where hell is?
Hell is in Hello
Heaven is good-bye forever
It's time for me to go

I was born under a wanderin' star
A wanderin' wanderin' star

Mud can make you prisoner
And the plains can bake you dry
Snow can burn your eyes
But only people make you cry
Home is made for comin' from
For dreams of goin' to
Which with any luck will never come true

I was born under a wanderin' star
I was born under a wanderin' star

When I get to heaven
Tie me to a tree
Or I'll begin to roam
And soon you know where I will be

I was born under a wanderin' star
A wanderin' wanderin' star
