Why do you do these things? 

What things? 

These ridiculous... the things you do! 

I hope to add some measure of grace to the world. 

The world's a dung heap and we are maggots that crawl on it! 

My Lady knows better in her heart. 

What's in my heart will get me halfway to hell. 
And you, SeÃ±or Don Quixote 
You're going to take such a beating! 

Whether I win or lose does not matter. 

What does? 

Only that I follow the quest. 

That for your Quest! 
What does that mean... quest? 

It is the mission of each true knight... 
His duty... nay, his privilege! 
To dream the impossible dream, 
To fight the unbeatable foe, 
To bear with unbearable sorrow 
To run where the brave dare not go; 
To right the unrightable wrong. 

To love, pure and chaste, from afar, 
To try, when your arms are too weary, 
To reach the unreachable star! 

This is my quest to follow that star, 
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far, 
To fight for the right 
Without question or pause, 
To be willing to march into hell 
For a heavenly cause! 

And I know, if I'll only be true 
To this glorious quest, 
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm 
When I'm laid to my rest. 

And the world will be better for this, 
That one man, scorned and covered with scars, 
Still strove, with his last ounce of courage, 
To reach the unreachable stars!
