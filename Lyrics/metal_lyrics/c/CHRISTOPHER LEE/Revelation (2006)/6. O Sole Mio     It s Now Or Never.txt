Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole,
n'aria serena doppo na tempesta!
Pe' ll'aria fresca pare gia' na festa...
Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole.

It's now or never, Ma n'atu sole
come hold me tight, cchiu' bello, oi ne'
Kiss me my darling, o sole mio
be mine tonight, sta 'nfronte a te!
Tomorrow will be too late 
It's now or never, my love won't wait

When I first saw you, with your smile so tender
My heart was captured, my soul surrendered
I spent a lifetime, waiting for the right time
Now that your near, the time is here, at last

It's now or never, Ma n'atu sole
come hold me tight, cchiu' bello, oi ne
Kiss me my darling, o sole mio
be mine tonight, sta 'nfronte a te!
Tomorrow will be too late 
It's now or never, my love won't wait

Just like a willow, we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me, let your arms invite me
For who knows when we'll meet again this way

It's now or never, Ma n'atu sole
come hold me tight, cchiu' bello, oi ne
Kiss me my darling, o sole mio
be mine tonight, sta 'nfronte a te!
Tomorrow will be too late 
It's now or never, my love won't wait

It's now or never, my love won't wait
It's now or never, my love won't wait
It's now or never, my love won't wait
