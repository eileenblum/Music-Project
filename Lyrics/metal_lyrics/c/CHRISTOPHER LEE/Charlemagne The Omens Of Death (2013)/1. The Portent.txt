The signs were there, whereever I looked, only I could not see them...
Obscured by my zeal, by my beliefs, each and every one was a marker
Of my destiny as the chosen one - As defender of Faith and the leader of men.
But it all came at a great price, as all great kings, I became a great killer - Lombardi, Verden, Roncevaux Pass...
It all ended in death and destruction!
These were Omens

The Omens of Death!
