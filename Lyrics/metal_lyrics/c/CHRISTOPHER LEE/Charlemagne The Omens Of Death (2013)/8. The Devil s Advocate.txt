We'll die for our king
We'll die for our king
And our swords will be stained
By their blood, by their blood

Roland, bring their chief to me
Gather your men and we will see
Who is the leader that dares to fight?
To sleigh and maim against our might
Trust us lord that you will see
This traitor in hell for eternity
Trust us lord and time will tell
He'll burn again in hell

Go with god my valiant men
We'll seek the fox in the darkest den
Go with god
He will guide and lead the fight

Ha, the knights so brave are here
They think we're weak and shake with fear
You knights, you think your blood won't spill
We'll thrust and thrust our blades and kill

We're not here to fight, we come in peace
Our king Charlemagne does request
Your leader would wish to speak with him
To hear our lord's need to know why

Not here to fight, just wait
Right now you cowards
Our leader comes, we see him now
Approaching on his horse

Charlemagne...
You're king no more...
We'll crush your bones by rock and stones
We'll tear you limb from limb
We'll pluck your heart and break it apart
And fill our cups with your blood to the rim

I should have known, no other power
Would have betrayed our god
There could only be one
He is darkness...
He is death...
He is the devil...

Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa...
Charlemagne, you're not immortal like me
We'll whip you like a dog
Till your blood runs like rivers
In flood, flood, flood...

We fear you... never
We'll fight to the death for honour
And our swords will be stained
By your blood... forever
