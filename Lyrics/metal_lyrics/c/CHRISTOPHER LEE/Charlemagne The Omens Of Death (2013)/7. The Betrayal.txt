In the midst of the vigorous and uninterrupted struggles with the Saxons
Charlemagne built garrisons at strategic points to protect his territories from further attacks
He then mustered all available forces in order to thwart the greatest threat to Papal lands

Men! I have summoned you
Here to aid our brothers in
Their struggle against the Saracens!

We must, at any cost, liberate
These lands in order to protect
Our realm from the imminent
Threat of their insurgency!

The Frankish troops then
Marched over the Pyrenees
Into Iberia

Once in Iberia, Charlemagne
Calls upon the twelve peers
His bravest knights
He then instructs
Them to command all attacks
Against the enemy

At the raising of my sword
"Joyeuse", show the enemy
No mercy until they lay down
Their arms and surrender!

Gloria in Excelsis Deo!

Vivat Francia!

Vivat Rex Charlemagne!

All the towns and castles that
The mighty Frankish army
Attacked, surrendered

Charlemagne's forces
Suffered virtually no losses

But, on their long journey
Back through the Pyrenees...

It is the Gascons!

They are attacking our flanks!

They have betrayed us!!!
