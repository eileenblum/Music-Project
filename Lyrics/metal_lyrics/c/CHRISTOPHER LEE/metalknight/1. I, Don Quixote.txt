Hear me now
Oh thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base and debauched as can be
And a knight with his banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee!

Oh, I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
Destroyer of evil am I
I will march to the sound of the trumpets of glory
Forever to conquer or die

I'm Sancho! Yes, I'm Sancho!
I'll follow my master till the end
I'll tell all the world proudly
I'm his squire! I'm his friend!

Hear me, heathens and wizards
And serpents of sin â
All your dastardly doings are past!
For a holy endeavour is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last!

I am I, Don Quixote
The Lord of La Mancha â
My destiny calls and I go!
And the wild winds of fortune
Will carry me onward
Oh whither soever they blow!
Whither soever they blow â
Onward to glory I go!
