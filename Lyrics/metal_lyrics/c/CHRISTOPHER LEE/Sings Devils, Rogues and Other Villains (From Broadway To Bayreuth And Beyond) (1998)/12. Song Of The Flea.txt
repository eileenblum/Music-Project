Once there lived a king,
And a flea lived with him.
A Flea, a flea!
It was closer
than a brother to him
A Flea! â ha ha ha ha ha â a flea!
Ha ha ha ha ha â A Flea!

The king called for a tailor â
âListen, you blockhead,
For my dearest friend
Make a velvety caftan!â
âA caftan for the flea?!
For the flea! Caftan?!..â
Ha ha
âA caftan for the flea!â

In gold and velvet
This flea was dressed.
And full freedom
Was given to it at court.
To the Flea! Ha-ha!

The king granted a title of minister to it
And gave an medal along with it.
And all the others
had to submit to the flea.
Ha ha

And even her highness, the Queen
And all her ladies in waiting
Were fed up with the fleas
And lost their quiet living.
Ha-ha

And they were afraid to touch it,
Or even to beat it.
But if they start biting us â
Letâs smother them at once!
