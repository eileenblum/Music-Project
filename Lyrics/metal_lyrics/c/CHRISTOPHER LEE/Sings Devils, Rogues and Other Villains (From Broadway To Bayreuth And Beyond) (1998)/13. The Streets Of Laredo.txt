As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
All wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay

"I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy!"
These words he did say as I boldly stepped by
"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I am shot in the breast and I know I must die!

It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing
It was once in the saddle I used to make hay
First down to Rosie's and then to the card-house
Got shot in the breast and I am dying today!

Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Get six pretty maidens to bear up my pall!
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall!

Oh, beat the drum slowly and playe the fife lowly
And play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong!

Oh, beat the drum slowly and playe the fife lowly
And play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong!

Then swing your rope slowly and rattle your spurs lowly
And give a wild whoop as you carry me along
And in the grave throw me and roll the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong!"
