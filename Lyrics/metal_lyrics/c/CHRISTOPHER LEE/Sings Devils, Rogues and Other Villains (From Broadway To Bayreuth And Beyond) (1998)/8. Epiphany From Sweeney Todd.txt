I had him!
And then . . .

I had him!
His throat was bare beneath my hand â
No, I had him!
His throat was there and he'll never come again!

When? Why do I wait?
You told me to wait â
Now he'll never come again!
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And it's filled with people
Who are filled with shit
And the vermin of the world inhabit it â
But not for long . . .

They all deserve to die â
Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett, tell you why!
Because in all of the whole human race
Mrs. Lovett, there are two kinds of men and only two
There's the one staying put
In his proper place
And the one with his foot
In the other one's face â
Look at me, Mrs Lovett, look at you!

No, we all deserve to die â
Even you, Mrs. Lovett, even I!
Because the lives of the wicked should be made brief
For the rest of us death will be a relief â
We all deserve to die!
And I'll never see Johanna
No I'll never hug my girl to me â finished!

Alright! You Sir, how about a shave?
Come and visit your good friend Sweeney â
You Sir, too Sir! Welcome to the grave!
I will have vengeance â
I will have salvation â
Who Sir, you Sir?
No one's on the chair, come on! Come on!
Sweeney's waiting! I want you bleeders!
You Sir! Anybody!
Gentlemen now don't be shy!

Not one man, no, nor ten men
Nor a hundred can assuage me â
I will have you!

And I will get him back even as he gloats
In the meantime I'll practice on dishonorable throats
And my Lucy lies in ashes â
And I'll never see my girl again!
But the work waits!
I'm alive at last â
And I'm full of joy!
