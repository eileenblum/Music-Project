Here I am - Richard will reign over the enchanted lands
York is the symbol of true wisdom - eternal the lesson of my kingdom

I lived my whole existence with ambition for the future
And battle in this damned fields is an occasion for my power
And now the time has come to destroy my own frustrations
Submission of the throne will be my only satisfaction

A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse
We can defeat our enemies we can win this war

Why are Thomas and Henry abandoning me?
Death pain and rout is all I can see
Is this the end of my powerful greed? Fear is growing inside me

Why are Thomas and Henry abandoning me?
The ghost of Anne is all I can see
Buckingam's loyalty is abandoning me - fear is growing inside me

A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse
We can defeat our enemies we can win this war

A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse
It's time to hone our blades and it's time to raise our fists

You lived your whole existence with ambition for the future
The battle of Bosworth was the end of your power
It is time for you to perish for your great abominations
Submission of your soul will be our only satisfaction

Here I am Richard III
