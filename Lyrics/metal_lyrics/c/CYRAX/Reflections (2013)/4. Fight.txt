I can see - sky is darkening
There is fear - clouds are burning
I can't feel - sun is setting
There is nothing real in this world
The only solution is to destroy devils of existence
From your souls - is god laughing?
Build a wall - is god hiding?
To face soon - what are we waiting for?
The cruel truth of these words - I won't believe anymore

Fight, fight, fight! - fight until you die
Fight, fight, fight! - Honour makes me fly

In the night alone we cry
Standing strong
In the doubts we will die
Everything's wrong
None is safe, hope is lost

Democracy is a ghost

Fight, fight, fight! - Fight until you die
Fight, fight, fight! - Honour makes me fly
Scream it louder!
Fight! Fight!

Feel the power
