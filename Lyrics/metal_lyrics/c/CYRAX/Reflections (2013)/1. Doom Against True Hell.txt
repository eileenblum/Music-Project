We want to scream for anger, all you can hear are cries
Liberty safe and peace are only old lies
The enemies reign our land so we got to keep safe
The future of our kingdom with hammer, sword and strafes

We fight for the glory - we fight for the king

We fight for our lives and loudly we'll sing
It's our doom we fight for the glory we fight for the king
Against hell we fight for our lives and loudly we'll sing
Purity of true spirit we just want to preserve
And if we don't act soon we'll perpetually observe
A long time ago we built those sublime walls
And we won't accept they destroy our omnipotence

We fight for the glory - we fight for the king

We fight for religion that is by our side
And now holy virtue we'll help us to survive
Violence and madness are just bad memories
Only time will tell us the uncertainty of destiny
