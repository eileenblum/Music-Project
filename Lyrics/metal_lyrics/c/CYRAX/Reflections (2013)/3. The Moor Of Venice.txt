Are you sure of his mistake? - Yes, my lord
Is this just an Iago's fake? - No, he's just an humble slave
Cassius is nothing but honesty - He won't be saved
I can't believe this - Damned faith

No doubt - Cassius the liar
We fought - Like brother together
No way out - I'll hate you forever
No thoughts - My rage is your fear

Othello pay attention - Vengeance brings damnation

Desdemona couldn't lie - Where is the hanky?
Did Emilia make her blind? - God will not show us his mercy
In dreams I saw infinite cries - Jealousy helps fancy
I won't forgive 'em - Skies turns grey

No doubt - They are all sinners
I sought - Cassius the betrayer
I thought - I'd love her forever
No way out - Punishment's near

Othello pay attention - Vengeance brings damnation

Cassius prepare to die - He's completely mad
Desdemona is a pure sacrifice
The betrayers mustn't survive
I killed her she's only mine - Othello didn't hesitate

No doubt - Forever and ever
Truth came out - Iago the murderer
Throughout - I'm damned whenever
No way out - In heaven I'll feel better
