On Mississippi was born a great art
Where there's strength of a black heart
Blues you can call it, you'll sing it everyday
This music is all if you rock this way
Clapton and king and waters are masters, your heart is beating faster
The crowds is dancing, chords are like a poison,

Feel the essence of blues

All (that) we want
Is to play this song seizing it upon your head
All (that) we want
Is to conquer your heart, the groove will make you mad

Don't stop dancing don't stop singing

One day you'll understand
Now you're prepared to reach in every way

The power of blues

There was a time when Ray ruled the scene
He made revolutions
And there was a time when Chuck created themes
Taking new directions

We seek! - Music power
We obtain! - Music power
Your heartbeat reaches the moon
We play the tunes, we shake your bodies, invading your mind soon
