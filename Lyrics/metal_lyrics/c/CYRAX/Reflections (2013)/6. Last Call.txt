Out in the darkness we search through the night
Will sadness bring us all some sort of new light?
We spend our time waiting for a new dawn
Is our destiny to become useless bones?

Cause now we can't disguise
What's beyond the lies
And we must fall
Cause now we must conceal
A truth so real

This is our last call

Now with my eyes I can see my decline
Oh God can you please just give me a sign
Are suffering and pain the only reasons to live?
Are love and kindness the only things you misgive?
We saw a rotting Christ spreading his lies, imposing oppression
Our law was built through fights, destroying his lies, instilling devotion
Cause now my soul will fly
And I just try
To make me stronger

Cause now we must deal
With truths so real

This is our last call

Now it is time
To change your mind breaking the madness
Now your love will shine destroying the crimes of the world
