Another sleepless night,
Another girl can not hide
From their hate.
The dungeon awaits!

[Inquisitor:]
You are the Satan's host,
"A witch! Black devil's whore
Did you say, yes?"
Do you confess?
What is on her arm?
"A black mark! She will die!"

Poisoned and insane minds!
Flames are dancing,
and almost reach the sky!
Poisoned and insane minds!
Day by day she'd innocent's blood!

The great Chief Magistrate
Does not listen to her.
No one around
To save her life.
Dungeons are wet of blood,
She feels death all around.
No tears to drop,
No ray of hope.
He looked in her bright eyes:

[Inquisitor:]
You're guilty, you will die!"

Poisoned and insane minds!
Flames are dancing, and almost reach the sky!
Poisoned and insane minds!
Day by day she'd innocent's blood!

Look at here arm!
It's Satan's sign!
The devil's mark!
Look at her arm!
It's Satan's sign!
The witch's mark!"

Poisoned and insane minds!
Flames are dancing, and almost reach the sky!
Poisoned and insane minds!
Day by day she'd innocent's blood!

[Inquisitor:]
"You are sentenced to death
You will burn at the stake!"
From spark to flames...
From fear to death...
The judge felt burning pain,
Looked at his arm and fell...

[Inquisitor:]
"The same black sign
As on her arm!"

Poisoned and insane minds...
Poisoned, savage and blind...
You are under her dark spell!
This is your omen!
You can not get rid of that sign
The witch's mark!
