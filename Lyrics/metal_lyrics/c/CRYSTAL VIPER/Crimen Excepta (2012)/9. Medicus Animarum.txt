Bloody, bloody day, he is waiting for someone to break.
He's all wet of blood - Oh, so empty and insane are his eyes!
He's able to see if one suffers from mortal sin!
Bishop's favourite one - He's the most cruel torturer
In the town.

No, she will not see the light!
She's daughter of the night!
He and church are always right,
She'll loose her life tonight...

"A witch!", people said. Now she's naked,
And scared to death.
Someone saw her while she was casting a spell? What a lie!
Torturer awaits, the murderer, by church he is paid.
He won't set her free - It is her time to die in agony.

No, she will not see the light!
She's daughter of the night!
He and church are always right,
She'll loose her life tonight...

He will heal her soul - He knows how Satan takes control.
And hell' bring him out,
Even if she'll pay for it with her life.
When she's mad with pain - Is it better than burning at stake?

No, she will not see the light!
She's daughter of the night!
He and church are always right,
She'll loose her life tonight...

No, she will not see the light!
She's daughter of the night!
