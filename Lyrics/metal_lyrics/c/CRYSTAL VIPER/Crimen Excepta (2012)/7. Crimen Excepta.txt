[feat. David Bower]Again, and again he's judging the witches,
But every time his aim to free them.
Sorcerer? Judge?
Nobody knew he's an unholy child!
Again, and again he's practicing magic,
And his whole life is a mystery.
Sorcerer? Judge?
Nobody knew he's an unholy child of the damned!
Don't need to beg for your life!
Fire is still burning - but not for us.
Don't need to beg for your life!
Witchery will bring justice to us.
No! We won't die!
He is the one - lord of the werewolves
He wields your fears, master of the moon.
Powerful spells, forbidden practice!
He's mightier than hell!
He will hunt down all those whose blood is
Poisoned by greed - They'll meet the justice:

[William:]
"Cursed are their souls... Dirty from killing..."
He's unholy child of the damned!
Don't need to beg for your life!
Fire is still burning - But not for us.
Don't need to beg for your life!
Witchery will bring justice to us.
No! We won't die!

[William:]
"I feel fear of the innocent,
They will not die from my hands!
I am here to let them go,
...Let them go
Bishops, and mentally ill priests
Will meet the curse of the witch!"

[Sarah:]
"Child taken out from the flames
Will rule, will save us!"
