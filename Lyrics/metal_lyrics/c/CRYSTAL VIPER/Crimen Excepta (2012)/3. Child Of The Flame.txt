He knew that something was wrong,
And didn't expect that
Because of his last judgement
His family will die.

Magic spell all around...
Burning mark on his arm...

He lost his sense of power
When house began to burn.
Fire came without warning,
Took his servants and wife.

Magic spell around...
Killing them one by one...

Burn! Burn! Fire is all around!
Burn! Burn! What a cursed night!
Burn! Burn! No one will stay alive!
Black Mark - Prediction!
Burn! Burn! Fire is all around!
Burn! Burn! What a cursed night!
Burn! Burn! No one will stay alive!
Except unholy child.

Flames got higher and higher
Sarah saw burning house,
And jumped into the fire
When heard a crying child.

Magic spell around...
Only we will survive...

In the treacherous fire
She was on dangerous ground...
But got out from this death-trap
With a boy on her arms.

Magic spell around...
Little William survived...

Burn! Burn! Fire is all around!
Burn! Burn! What a cursed night!
Burn! Burn! No one will stay alive!
Black Mark - Prediction!
Burn! Burn! Fire is all around!
Burn! Burn! What a cursed night!
Burn! Burn! No one will stay alive!
Except unholy child...
