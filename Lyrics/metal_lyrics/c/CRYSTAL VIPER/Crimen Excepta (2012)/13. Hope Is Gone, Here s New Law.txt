Anger came like thunder - Their dissatisfaction
Makes them savage like hungry beasts.
Dissemblers and traitors, a renegade nation
Not a world that we want to see...
Right and justice, fairness, it is not for them
Rogues, with holy bible in hands!
They think they are the law, self-styled judges,
But they can't kill this winter day.
Look in their eyes...
They're merciless liars! Merciless liars
Started the chase on their own...

[William:]
"Now our hopes are gone
There's no place that we could go...
If there are no crimes,
They will tell new lies.
There is nobody to trust
Our hopes are gone...
Here comes the new law..."
People couldn't believe in the final verdict
How could the judge let her go alive?
But for greedy people it had no meaning:
"She was found guilty of a crime!"
Their new plan was
To start false investigation,
Doesn't matter
Where lies the truth:
"He aquitted his mother
It's betrayal,
So tonight he needs to die too!"
Look in their eyes...
They're merciless liars!
Merciless liars
Started the chase on their own...

[William:]
"Now our hopes are gone
They're came with new law.
There's no place that we could go...
If there are no crimes,
They will tell new lies.
There is nobody to trust
Our hopes are gone...
Here comes the new law..."
