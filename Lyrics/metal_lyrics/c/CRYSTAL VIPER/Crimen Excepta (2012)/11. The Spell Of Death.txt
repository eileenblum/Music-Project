They took her away and didn't say a word.
Unholy bastards! No changes for her!
But she knew what was goin' on...
Barefoot and scared, they throw her in the snow,
Her hands were shaking, she knew where she'll go...
Will the moon see her blood tonight?
Wind brought whispers of her destiny,
Hail was slashing her pale skin,
Around her all those who bring the death.
It seems to be the end..

[Sarah:]
"Souls of the night,
Mighty, and right,
I'm calling thee!
My end in the fire!
And when I'm gone,
Take my soul home,
Yes, this is my fate,
That's what I desire, now..."

[Sarah:]
"I felt that something would happen this night:
They try to force me to say awful lies.
Yes, I saw it many times in my dreams,
I've been accused, I know what it means,
I can read in their evil minds..."
Wind brought whispers of her destiny,
Hail was slashing her pale skin,
Around her all those who bring the death.
It seems to be the end...

[Sarah:]
"Souls of the night,
Mighty, and right,
I'm calling thee!
My end in the fire!
And when I'm gone,
Take my soul home,
Yes, this is my fate,
That's what I desire...

"Souls of the night,
Mighty, and right,
I'm calling thee!
My end in the fire!
And when I'm gone,
Take my soul home,
Yes, this is my fate,
That's what I desire, now..."

Next day they took her before the great court,
Against their God she committed a crime.
People were hungry for somebody's death!
Suddenly there came the judge - Her son...
