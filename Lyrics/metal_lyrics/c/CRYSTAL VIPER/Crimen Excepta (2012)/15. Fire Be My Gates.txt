[Ghost of Sarah:]
I've seen in my life so many dark nights.
Nights of rituals and rites.
Meetings at midnight with spirits and ghouls
To cross dimensions of life...
Secret... powers...
I crossed whole world and I've seen many times
Bloody wars, hate, genocide.
But I've never thought I would witness what
The inquisition had done.

Slaughter... murders...
Burn! Burn! Take us away!
Second world except us...
Death is waiting in the dead of night.
Burn! Burn! Take us away!
There is better place for us...
Death is waiting in the dead of night.
Fire, be my gates!

Fear is growing...
They're afraid of what they don't understand,
That's what human nature is.
Instead of open their minds and to learn,
They much prefer to kill!

Slaughter... murders...
Burn! Burn! Take us away!
Second world except us...
Death is waiting in the dead of night.
Burn! Burn! Take us away!
There is better place for us...
Death is waiting in the dead of night.
Fire, be my gates!

They came with torches,
Surrounded our home.
Ready to set fire, and to watch it burn.
William who saved his mother
From their hands
Will die in flames!
I am the keeper of the secret curse
If I die, you'll meet the deadly fate too!
Flames are getting stronger,
Can you feel it, fools!?
Look at your arms!
