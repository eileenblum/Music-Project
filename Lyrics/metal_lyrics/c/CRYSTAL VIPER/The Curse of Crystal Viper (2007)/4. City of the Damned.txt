[Death came from the sea. Khalandir was under siege. Dead bodies, rivers of blood, the cries of the dying ones... Night prowlers attacked from every possible side. Creates Hell bent on conquest, to turn the kingdom into the City of The damned. Their ruler, half-god half-beast, decided to not spare even one human being. Queen Alena who once defend Khalandir after the attack of Argis' soldiers could do nothing...]

[I.]
There is no time, and there is no future
People are dying on the streets
Killing and dying in the name of god
No honour, no hope and no rights
When are we going? What will it give us?
We don't need more bleeding violence!
Giant funeral, the end of the ends?
Desert of the graves and burning homes
...and what will you do?

[Ref.]
Dead eyes of hope...
City of the lost souls!
Dead eyes of pain...
City of the damned!

[II.]
There is no excuse, is this now too late?
World is turning his face from us
Raining tears of the earth so painful are
The world is dying, screaming wild
Dead bodies on the streets, anger!
River of blood in front of you
Giant funeral, the end of the ends
Desert of the graves and burning himes
...and what will you do?
