[CITY OF THE DAMNED - KHALANDIR UNDER SIEGE

The kingdom of Khalandir has had more than its share of hardships. It endured the Tyranny of King Argis until his defeat, and ultimately his death at the hands of Queen Alena eleven years ago. Later, the people endured the destruction of the Dereian Sun. And now they face possibly their biggest dilemma: The wrath of the Night Prowlers. These creatures of the night attack indiscriminately, feasting on the blood of the innocents. Predators with no apparent weaknesses. Can the kingdom survive their ensanguined onslaught?!]

[I.]
Old bell tolls the midnight
Vampire goes for a hunt
He'll get you in a backstreet
When you will go tonight
Dark mist around Your town
Smell of death in the air
You can feel his cold breath
Night stalker straight from hell!

Wild &amp; fast like a snake
He'll come from nowhere
You will feel his breath on your neck, yeah!
Your soul, under night's care...

[Ref.]
Night prowler - soul's hunter
Vampire nightmare from our dreams,
You will feel fangs on your neck
Night prowler - soul's hunter
Forgotten beast from our dreams,
Your soul is under night's care

[II.]
Fear will turn you in the stone
Your body will be paralyzed
There's no time to escape
He's gonna kill you tonight!
You will be dying in pain
Eyes of the beast see you now
Bleeding bodies around
The end is so close - run!

Wild &amp; fast like a snake
He'll come from nowhere
You will feel his breath on your neck, yeah!
Your soul, under night's care...
