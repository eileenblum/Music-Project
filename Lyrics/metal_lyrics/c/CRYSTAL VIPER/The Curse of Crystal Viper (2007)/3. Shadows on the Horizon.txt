[The real tragedy was that this did not need to be so. Had they been more vigilant and taken heed to the shadows, the nightmare could have been prevented. But they did not, and so the shadows turned into the blood feasting creatues of the night.]

[I.]
Creatures of the night
And ships made of bones
Death is coming from deep waters
Waterfalls of fear
Forgotten evil comes
We're under attack
Burning torch on the watchtower
Who will defend us?

[Ref.]
Shadows on the horizon
The bells are raging more and more
There is coming bloody war!

Shadows on the horizon
Fire is burning on the shore
There is coming bloody war!

[II.]
Walls of the castle
Will not defend us
Only wizard's spell will save us
Will he kill the death?
High in the mountain
In the deep forest
He will bring back the undead one
Oh, Eldinaar!
