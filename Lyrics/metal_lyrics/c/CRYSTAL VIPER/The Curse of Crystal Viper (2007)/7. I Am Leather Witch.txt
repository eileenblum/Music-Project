[Ancient demons, defenders of the old faith? These forgotten beings hated people more than any other lviing creatures. Who else could kill for gold or fame? No one. Only human... Alena was unsure what to do, as they knew very well that she had no chance to take the Astar by a force. Demons could kill her pirates in just one moment. So what to do? During the night, while still being on the ship, Alena had a dream: Her parents, Blue Dragon and Leather Witch told her about their love, and told her how to act with the Demons...]

[I.]
In the mountains I saw him
Under moonlight for a first time
Under twilight I meet him
He was talking with the lion
Burning dark eyes of my heart
I felt thunder, he is the one
From that moment I was sure:
he will be mine until world's end!

[Ref.]
Ohh, Blue Dragon
Take my heartbeat
Caves of fire are waiting there
I know, it's you ! Now I am sure!
I am Leather Witch!

[II.]
Eternal flame, desire
Will burn in us until the end
I look at you and I know
I was waiting, burning inside
I want to feel your warm breath
There, on my neck, you are so close
You can't defend, I can't fight
This is stronger, we are the one...!

[III.]
Now above the time and space
We fly into the burning dreams
The time seems to have no end
Your embrace as fire is hot
Burning flames of our hearts
Will melt the ice and shake the ground
I want nothing, except you!
I will be yours, until world's end!

[IV.]
Eternal flame, desire
Will burn in us until the end!
Burning flames of our hearts
Will melt the ice and shake the ground!
I want to feel your warm breath
There, on my neck, you are so close!
Now above the time and space
We fly into the burning dreams!
