[The old Wizard arrived to the castle, and together with Alena decided to try the last possible rescue... Eldinaar. Eldinaar was a legendary axeman, a warrior stronger and more powerful that most of us could even imagine. Many years ago he used to fight side by side with Alena's father, who was for him like a brother. Alena remembered that when she was a little girl, Eldinaar promised her he would return even from the grave, if she would need his help. Eldinaar was also the first one who started to call Alena "Crystal Viper"... Well, indeed, this time he would have to return from the grave, as he died several years ago by unknown circumstances... His body was found in the middle of the battlefield, but he had no wounds. Only his legendary axe and shield seemed to have wounds, that were bleeding like the human ones...]

[I.]
He was the chosen one,
code of honour
ruled in his life.
Shining axe was his sign
and sword -held high!
Gloves of metal!
Didn't die by the blade,
a treacheary
of mother earth,
took him away tonight.
Prince of darkness,
where is your blade?!

[Ref.]
Ride, into glory!
The last axeman, left his shield
Eternal!
Immortal!
The Axeman!

My fallen brother!
Now his soul will ride with me
The warrior!
Avenger!
The Axeman!

[II.]
Now, on the battlefield
we stand without
you battle cry.
Out fallen brother!
I took your axe,
and in your name
to the battle I ride!
I remember
you blood and sweat.
Your axe is now held high,
your flame will burn,
This is your blade!

[The Last Axeman is dedicated to J.D. Kimball]
