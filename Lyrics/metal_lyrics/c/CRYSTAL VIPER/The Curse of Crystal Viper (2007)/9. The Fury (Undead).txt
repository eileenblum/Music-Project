[It wasn't an easy task, but Alena finally did it! With Astar in her hand (and with happy pirates that loaded the ship with diamonds and gold!) they started on their journey hime. Directly from the Khalandirian shore, Alena headed to the northern mountain, where the Wizard had already begun the ancient ritual. The graves started to burn, and one by one - Eldinaar and his legions returned as half living and half dead beings. They were the undead ones! The battle has begun! Surprised creatures had no chance to escape.]

[I.]
From the grave he will come
Alive and still dead
He's still cursed one
But the wizard's spell
On the northern mountain
Brought him between us
He will bring victory
Ohhh, Eldinaar!

[Ref.]
Free!
Khalandir!
No more pain
No more fear
He brought the revenge
Dead defender

Save!
Khalandir!
Still alive
Undead one
Bringer of justice
Feel the fury!

[II.]
"Souleater" in his hand,
he will kill the death
Lust of war in his eyes
Prowler's time has come
Broken bones on the ground
War winds are so far
He will bring victory
Ohhh, Eldinaar!
