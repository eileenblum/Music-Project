[Yes! A long, long time ago, eons before the birth of the sun, demons were similar to human. They could love, could be joalous, could feel pain and hunger. Alena knew that she had to remind them, what it meant to love someone, and to worry about someone...]

[I.]
Sons of the devil will tonight stay on the ship
I have to go alone, to meet Astar's demons
This is last chance to save Khalandir
I hear voices... Will they listen to me?
Go!

[Ref.]
Demons' dagger!
Burning like the flames of hell
Will you give me
The power to kill the death?
Demons' dagger!
So cold, like the breath of the dead one
Will you bring us
A hope that was almost lost?

[II.]
The burning blade of ancient gods I hold in my hands
Is this the frozen blood-red fire of hellish lands?
Go back to the ship, it's time to go home!
Never retreat, and never surrender!
No!
