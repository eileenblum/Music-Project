[The battle fury of the undead ones brought back courage to the hearts of people of Khalandir. The revenge was outstanding: every single beast was crushed into dust. Eldinaar reminded the people of Khalandir that each weapon made by humans has its own soul. So both swords and the undead ones were now brothers in the battle of the Khalandirian people. Eldinaar and his legion returned to the kingdom of shadows, and the swords took their rest once again... The last of the Night Prowlers - half god and half beast were killed by Alena with Souleater - the legendary axe that Eldinaar gave her before going back to the other side... Khalandir was free!]

[I.]
Eldinaar returned
And our faith with him
Beasts of hell now die!
In bright flames of pain -
Glory of the axe!
Glory of the sword!
Evil dies
On our eyes!

[II.]
Cutting the beast's throat
Crushing his weak bones
The earth drunk the blood
The battle is won
So calm down my friend
It's time to go home
Sleeping swords
Battle lords

[Ref.]
Courage
Will stay with us now
Courage, no more fear
We killed the death!
Weapons
Will take some rest now
Sleep well, ohh my friend
Have a steel dreams

[III.]
We don't even dare
To forget your look
Your might saved our lives
Our holy brothers
Until the next time
When danger will come
You will bite
You will fight!
