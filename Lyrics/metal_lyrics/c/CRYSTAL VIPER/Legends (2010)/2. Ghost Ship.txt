A ship with three masts, proud between the waves
The land was far away in sight
No captain, no boatswain and his old mates
Knew what will happen this dark night

A ship full of goods, worth more than their lives
They only wanted to survive
People are waiting with greed in their eyes
Dead sailorsâ bodies will now dive

Greed knows no bounds
This is the end
We wonât let them forget!

They will not win against natureâs powers
Sailors fighting with shallow grave
When they will crush, their goods will be ours
We know what we say, thatâs the law!

Greed knows no bounds
This is the end
We wonât let them forget!

Hoist the flag and ring the bell
We are waiting deep in hell
Broken mast will not stop us
Wild sea, our home!

Some were found by death in the sleeping berth
Dying in the waves, one by one
Others in water trying to catch breath
It is too late, nowhere to run!

A burning fire on the shore is a trap
They donât care, how many will die
Only the goods, no one wanted to help
Time to look in the darknessâ eye

Greed knows no bounds
This is the end
We wonât let them forget!

The ghost ship will remind you of the sad past
No happy end and no glory
Dead sailors are waiting, taking the rest
You should remember this story!

Greed knows no bounds
This is the end
We wonât let them forget!
