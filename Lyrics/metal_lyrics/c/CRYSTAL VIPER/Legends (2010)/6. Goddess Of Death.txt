[Smiertnica]

She rules demons of the earth
She will drive you to despair
If you have ever seen the cold
Emptiness of her eyes

Have you seen the end of the ends?
Queen of death will take you there!
And as a guide in the four worlds
Takes your soul into new home

When your inner flame will disappear
Sheâll take you for eternal rest
Deadly omen, deadly spell
And there will be no pain

She keeps the golden scythe in hand
Queen of the darkness, of the dead
Turns your body into dust
If you looked in her cold eyes
You wonât survive!

She takes away all of your fears and pain
Brings the death, takes your soul to the nothingness
Queen of the night will bring eternal dark
Here she comes, a goddess of death

When thereâs a mist behind the graveyardâs gates
She waits for the one who will look in the eyes of death
Itâs a bad sign if you saw her just one time
It is your last night, you will die!
It is your time

She takes away all of your fears and pain
Brings the death, takes your soul to the nothingness
Queen of the night will bring eternal dark
Here she comes, a goddess of death
