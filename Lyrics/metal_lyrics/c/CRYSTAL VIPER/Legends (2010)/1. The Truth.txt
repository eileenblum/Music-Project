You, people, know the things like greed, and cruelty very well...
You can have the devil on your side, but he wonât help you
Sooner or later you will drown in the Black Water or you will turn to stone...
The Goddess of Death with the golden scythe is patient
You still have time and itâs up to you
If your blood will be the Blood of the Hero
Or if you will lose like the Son of the Wind...
I can tell you only one thing:
âThe evil always returns and greed is blind...!
