T.V. war is part of life 
Entertaining &amp; far,far away 
What a story &amp; how they fight 
Let's gamble &amp; guess who will win 

Danger is nowhere 
We still got the chance to switch off 
Remote control &amp; the guarantee 
It's somewhere else 

T.V. war - T.V. war 
Bloodless but deadly &amp; cruel 
T.V. war - T.V. war 

We are eating,while we're watching 
People die on the screen 
Toasted &amp; roasted &amp; scrambled &amp; fried 
We are greedy &amp; pay 

T.V. war - T.V. war 
Bloodless but deadly &amp; cruel 
T.V. war - T.V. war 

Information - in between 
Missiles are in the air 
You can hear them &amp; see 
They're already here 

T.V. war - T.V. war 
Bloodless but deadly &amp; cruel 
T.V. war - T.V. war 

Oh,yeah ! 

According to informed sources 
Of the defence ministry: 
There is now confirmation 
That enemy missiles have penetrated our airspace 
Impact is estimated in a matter of minutes 
Good evening ! 

T.V. war - T.V. war 
Bloodless but deadly &amp; cruel 
T.V. war - T.V. war 
Bloodless &amp; deadly but cruel 
T.V. war - T.V. war
