[The Devil]
Itâs so black
Hot like hell
Unholy water calls for you
Take a look just one time
And all of your dreams will come true
Look into black water!

Come closer! Dance with black waves!
You will live forever
Just one step into black lake
Youâll give me your soul
Come to me! Dance with waves!
We can rule together
One step into black lake
Now youâre mine and thereâs no way back!

[The Devil]
I can feel all of your fears
Donât be afraid, so close you are
Just one step into depth
You know, gates of hell are not far...

Now drown into black water!

[The Young Man]
Thereâs no way out from here
Thereâs nothing left for me
All the things that I loved are simply gone
Servant?! Donât want to be!
Iâll give you back my dreams
But you donât listen! Why?
What have I done?!

Come closer! Dance with black waves!
You will live forever
Just one step into black lake
Youâll give me your soul
Come to me! Dance with waves!
We can rule together
One step into black lake
Now youâre mine and thereâs no way back!
