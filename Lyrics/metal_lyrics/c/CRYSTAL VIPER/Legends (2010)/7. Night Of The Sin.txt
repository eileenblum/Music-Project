Sky was rd but stars were shining
She felt someoneâs breath behind her
There was something mysterious in the air

Specters, phantoms were around her
She saw it once in one of her dreams
She knew she was the one
They will take her there

There was no escape
Itâs her destiny
No, she wonât hide
Tonight, it is the night of the sin!

Black sabbat at midnight
Now sheâs one of them
Black sabbat at midnight
She rule the flames

Black sabbat at midnight
Was so real and wild
Black sabbat at midnight
She is the witch, sheâs the one

Phantoms were playing on the bones
Witches were dancing with grey ghosts
There were a hundreds of human skulls around

At sunrise it all will end, but
She will wait for the next midnight
When she will b called by the howl of hellâs hound!

There was no escape
Itâs her destiny
No, she wonât hide
Tonight, it is the night of the sin!

Black sabbat at midnight
Now sheâs one of them
Black sabbat at midnight
She rule the flames

Black sabbat at midnight
Was so real and wild
Black sabbat at midnight
She is the witch, sheâs the one
