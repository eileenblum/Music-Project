[Defenders Of The Castle Hill]

Once upon a time there was a man who made a pact
Met with evil spirits every night
He thought it will never stop and he will need to pay
Wizard at night, simple man at day
Devil gave him a book with secret knowledge of the dead
But didnât say there is no way back
Man followed his every word, time was passing by
But those devilâs great words were lies!

Donât believe in every word he says!

Run away
As fast as you can
Do not let evil to take control
Run away
As fast as you can
Run Away
You must save your soul

Once upon a dreary season when the midnight came
He decided to change his aim
He locked doors and called for devil as felt very strong
When he came the words stuck in his throat
Prince of darkness was so mighty, knew the man would lie
So he came with a new, dark, secret plan
Devil called for secret powers, the lightning and storm
Run away or youâll turn into stone

You believed in every word he said!

Run away
As fast as you can
Do not let evil to take control
Run away
As fast as you can
Run Away
You must save your soul
