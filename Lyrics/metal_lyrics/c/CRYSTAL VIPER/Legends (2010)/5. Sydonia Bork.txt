At one September day
The sword drunk a lot of blood
They passed a judgement on her
âCause they thought she cursed their lives

There were only few months left for her to pass away
She was old and tired, but nobody cared

At every moonlit night
Sydonia dresses in white
Walks on the courtyard
Did she forget?
She looks on the riverside
This sight gladdens her heart
Sometimes there is a smile on her face

They tortured her as long
As she admitted her guilt
But before she died
She said who would be next!

Those words brought out the mortal fear
But when Sydonia died, the prophecy turned out to be real!

At every moonlit night
Sydonia dresses in white
Walks on the courtyard
Did she forget?
She looks on the riverside
This sight gladdens her heart
Sometimes there is a smile on her face
