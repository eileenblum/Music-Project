[Defenders Of The Castle Hill]

Walls of the castle were no longer strong
But the enemies will not break âem down
He knew it would happen âcause the peace was too long
He was sure â the war will begin at night!

With wild hearts and with swords ready to kill
They werenât afraid â so brave were these knights
They promised to defend the hill and the castle:
âWeâre ready to fight! Weâre ready to die!â

Blood of the heroes!
We cannot forget
Blood of the heroes!
We will hail their names
Blood of the heroes!
Eternal and proud
Blood of the heroes!
Forever and ever unbound

The land was burning, people were dying
Wind brought there the smell of their burning homes
It was the last time to look at the sky
To find a better place for their souls

âEnemies are standing in our big gates!
I prefer to die than to be a slave!
Yes, we are too weak to fight, it is too late
Iâll follow my brothersâ¦even to hell!â

Blood of the heroes!
We cannot forget
Blood of the heroes!
We will hail their names
Blood of the heroes!
Eternal and proud
Blood of the heroes!
Forever and ever unbound

Now itâs time to look in the eyes of death
To fade away
They lost everything, their lives and homes
In one day...

Blood of the heroes!
We cannot forget
Blood of the heroes!
We will hail their names
Blood of the heroes!
Eternal and proud
Blood of the heroes!
Forever and ever unbound
