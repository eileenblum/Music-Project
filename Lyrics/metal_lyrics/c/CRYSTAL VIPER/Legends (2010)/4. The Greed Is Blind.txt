They lived in poverty
Fed by a vain hope, that it will change
Then there came a stranger
âI will grant all of your wishâ he said

Do not you ask?
You will regret it, youâll see
Do not you ask?
Even if you live unhappily

Your wish came true!
Itâs time to pay, you lost eyesight
What shall you do?
Nothing, because the greed is blind

They will sacrifice everything
To achieve fortune and fame
He knows where to go to
But they must be blind to find the right way

Do not you ask?
You will regret it, youâll see
Do not you ask?
Even if you live unhappily

Your wish came true!
Itâs time to pay, you lost eyesight
What shall you do?
Nothing, because the greed is blind

Your wish came true!
Itâs time to pay, you lost eyesight
What shall you do?
Nothing, because the greed is blind
