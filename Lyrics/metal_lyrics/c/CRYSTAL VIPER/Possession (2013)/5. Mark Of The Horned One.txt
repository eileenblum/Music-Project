[THE EXORCIST:]
Do you see?
Yes, the witch's mark
Right here on her arm!
Take a look
Symbol of the dark
Which heralds big harm

The devil
Marks his chosen ones
And they feel no fear
The symbol
That was seen not once
Her soul it will tear
The evil is near!

The mark of the witch,
The mark of the horned one
What are your sins,
Tell me what have you done?!
In my very old books...
Seen it before!
It's the sign of Sarah,
The devil's whore

Did you know
Sarah was a witch
Many years ago
At the stake
They burned the devil's bitch
No regrets, oh no!

You know that
Witches should be burned
In pain they should die
It's God's will!
Now it's our turn
Don't look in her eye
Or we all will die
