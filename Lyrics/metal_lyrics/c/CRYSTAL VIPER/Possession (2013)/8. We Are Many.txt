[THE CREATOR:]
You have no right to tell me what to do
I'm one of many, we created you!
You pray to us and you call us angels
We created you, before the ages!

We created the human race: it was a mistake
You're evil and greedy, and you love to kill

Always here, from above
We were watching you
We have seen what you've done
You're cruel and blind

Between stars we were born
And we are many
Better you listen to us
While you still have time

The earth does not belong to you, oh no
You are guests, our 'creation' - to say so
the plan was good, and we gave you free will
But it all went wrong, and you love to kill

We created the human race: it was a mistake
You are evil and greedy, and you love to kill
