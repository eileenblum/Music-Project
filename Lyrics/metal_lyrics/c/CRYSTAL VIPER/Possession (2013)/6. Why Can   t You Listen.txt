[JULIA:]
Please take him away from here
You need to believe me
I've got something to say
There's no evil in me

I'm not the evil one!

I'm alone and I'm afraid
I don't know where to hide
They don't want to listen, why?
There's no one on my side

Too late, what have you done?!
I'm not the evil one!

I know it's hard
To trust in me
Please just listen to what I must say
Hand on heart
Yes, you will see!
He is the liar, take him away!

[THE EXORCIST:]
They won't listen to your lies
Your soul will be set free
This is a holy sacrifice
God is speaking through me

You are the evil one!

Like so many before you
I'll send you back to hell
I know truth is on my side
Demonic tricks I know well

What is going on here?
What's that, what do I hear?

[THE CREATOR:]
So stupid you are
Proud human race
It went much too far
Way to much grace

It is boring, I'm tired
I just wanted to talk
The same story again
For so many years
The same mistakes you do
Thinking you should unlock
I have to tell you that
Future will bring tears!

Why don't you understand?
I won't let you kill her!
Beautiful words about setting her free are just your cheap lies
The truth is hidden out there
Now you shut up and listen to me!

Better understand my words
There's no evil in me
You bring only suffering
Please stop threatening me

You need to believe me!
