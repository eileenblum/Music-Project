[THE EXORCIST:]
So it shall be done
You will die you will burn
This is my sacred duty
Some way I will find

Exiled you will be
You will die you will burn
You are the fallen, I am not
I know what is in your mind
I know I am right!

You will be burnt
You won't hide
I'll crush you down
Truth is on my side!

I'll send you straight
Back to hell
I'll drive away this
Spiteful wicked spell

You shouldn't have come
I'll drive you out from here
I can promise you that
I will show no fear

Holy water's touch
It's too late, you can't run!
The ritual I begin
Holy Spirit, Father, Son
They are on my side!
