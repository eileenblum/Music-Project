We've gathered here tonight
We are bound by human sins
Finally, the last ray of light slowly disappears
We bleed for retribution, more than you can realize
I'll come for you, you'll pay us with your life

I will bring new law!
I will bring new law!
New tomorrow, burn in fire!
I will bring new law!
I will bring new law!
None of us will hide again

I hear them calling my name, ritual has begun
Prophecy! Fulfill tonight! Evil ones must die!
It's too late to try to wash out our blood from our hands
Black beast will possess your souls, hell awaits

Now I close my eyes,
Let myself go, to find the strength in my soul
Now you close your eyes
But you don't know if you'll ever open them again,
You're done, forever gone

This war lasted for way too long
Too much torture and minds in control
How could you place so many lies
In every drop of innocent blood
