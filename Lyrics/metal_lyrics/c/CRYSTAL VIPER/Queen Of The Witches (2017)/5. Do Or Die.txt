My will is free,
I have no god, no master
Truth is my name,
I hold no grudge, nor anger
I kneel to no one

I walk alone,
Although I'm still surrounded
By howls of winds,
By screams of shattered lighting
You can hear my name
Among the damned

Always out of line!
Always out of line!
Leave your fears and doubts behind,
Do or die!

Fight for your rights,
Do not approve submission
reach for the top!
You don't need their permission!
Never look behind

No time to waste,
Get rid of hesitations
Be strong and don't listen
to their suggestions
Now, make up your mind,
And get things done
