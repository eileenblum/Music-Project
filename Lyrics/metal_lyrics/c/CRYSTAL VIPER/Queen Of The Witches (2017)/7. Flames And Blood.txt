I'm not dreaming, and my eyes are wide open
What we do this night, will never be forgotten
Against shades of lies, I stand here, in my madness

End of evil!
End of lies!
End of evil!
Flames and blood!

Shadows from the mist looming up and surround me
Hear the howling! The sin eaters are hungry
They'll rip your hearts out, this is what we desire
I will heal our world with a ritual of fire

This is our night!
End of lies!
No more crimes!
