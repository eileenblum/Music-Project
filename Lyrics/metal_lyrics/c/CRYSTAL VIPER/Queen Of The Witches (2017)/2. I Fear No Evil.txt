Out of the darkness is coming my strength
There's always someone who's watching my back
Perceptible only with my senses

I fear no evil, nor the liars' reigns
My best companions are demons and friends
They're like a touch of hidden dimensions

Illuminated, they come out of flames,
and call my name...

Dreams of fire, night after night,
Flaming, bursting, my peace of mind
Voices calling inside my head
Am I insane or maybe damned?
Dreams of fire...

When I want something, I don't need to tell
I make a gesture - You'll get it for me.
You can't resist my powerful behests

There are no rivers that I couldn't cross,
Of highest mountains I reach every top.
Reality? Or I'm only dreaming?
I hear the howling, it happens again,
They call my name...
