The end is near, nothing can stop thisBodies crawling out from their gravesScreams of hunger crush the silenceEvery victim is a piece of flesh Is day of doom our destiny?Will we die in this lust of blood?Sun is covered by black moonSo run away, 'coz there's no place to hide "Where there is no room in burning hellevil arise and walk the earth"- it's attack of the living dead!When you find out, heart don't need to beat,there is no pain, you stop to feel -You're lost, you're creature, one of them - you are dead! Rotten corpses, wrinkled facesstill reminds me that I'm not safeMoans of zombies are so closeOhh, what to do? Now I'm scared to death! It's too queitly around meI feel that one of them has come!I'm not sure if it's zombie - I can't see him in the dark of the night...! "Where there is no room in burning hellevil arise and walk the earth"- it's attack of the living dead!When you find out, heart don't need to beat,there is no pain, you stop to feel - Now I'm dead! I'm howling, screaming - but nobody hear me!Where am I, and why I feel the zombie lust? What is happening with my mind?I don't feel any cold or fearEverywhere I see the bloodI'm lost 'coz I need no air to breathe! What shall I do, where to go now?I'm afraid that I'm one of themNow I'm dead, the living monster! I must join the army of the dead...! "Where there is no room in burning hellevil arise and walk the earth"- it's attack of the living dead!When you find out, heart don't need to beat,there is no pain, you stop to feel - Now I'm dead!
