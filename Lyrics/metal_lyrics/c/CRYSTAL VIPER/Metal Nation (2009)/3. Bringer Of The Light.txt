Angel once fallen, like a flame
Between dusts of the ages, he is still the same
Sparks of deadly pain, in your eyes
What to call the truth, and what are only the lies?
You will bring the light!

Bringer of the light
What is hidden in your mind?
You bring the light
You bring us the light

Bringer of the light
What is hidden in your mind?
You have to hide
The sun's coming up

On black wings you fly, with a torch
You are king of the mountains, comet you will forge
Like the thunder's clash, you will scream
You know his name
Should we really afraid of him?
You will bring the light!
