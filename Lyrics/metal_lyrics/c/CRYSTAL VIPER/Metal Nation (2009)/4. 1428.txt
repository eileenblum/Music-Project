Again, the monster of my mind try to hunt me downAnd only my defense is to stay awakeIs my desire to be killed by horrible nightmare from the dark? I always see these fingernails and madman's crazy eyesIf he he'll kill me in my dream I'm dead for real - don't let that happen! I'll face the terror in a life-death battleOnly wake up me when he'll come!I'm not afraid to fall asleep and kill him!You're not my nightmare anymore! I'm tired and I have enough - all these sleepless nightswhen he whispers "you are dead" or call my nameThis night I've got something for himI won't let him kill meNot this time! I always see these fingernails and madman's crazy eyesIf he he'll kill me in my dream I'm dead for real - don't let that happen!
