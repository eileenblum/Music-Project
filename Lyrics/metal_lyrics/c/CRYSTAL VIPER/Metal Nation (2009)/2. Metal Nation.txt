You can join us anytime, we're hereWe are proud, to no men we'll never kneelWe don't care what they say, and what they'll doAlways real and honest, we are the truth, we are the truth! Power! Burn inside!As one - together!Till' the end - fight! We are metal nationWe worship the truthMetal nation! Together we standMillions side by sideFor hell we bent We are metal nationBurning like fireMetal nation! We don't care who you are, which gods you prayNo lies between us, we do what we sayThe worshippers of death and souls of blackTrue maniacs of speed, won't see our backWon't see our back!
