Walls enclose my body
Take away my breath
Prison bars are chocking me
Rusty, cold and dense
Nobody to hear me
Yet I am not alone
Faces of dead children
Haunt me all night long

Time will never turn

A red glowing horizon
Brings the final dawn
A colorful world comes to life
Outside these prison walls
Many voices in the streets
Are shouting out my name
They all wanna see me hang
And die at noon today

They want me to confess
Before the eyes of God
Free myself from Satan's token
Send my soul to heaven
But I will die with pride
Face their torture all day long
Ultimately torn and broken
I will burn forever

A symphony of footsteps
Echoes in my cell
A playful show of dancing flames
Will free me from this hell
The weight of fear and anger
Deprives me of my will
It's time for me to leave this world
My mission's been fulfilled

I will always be your friend
I will never let you go
You will be my little angel
You can call me uncle Joe
I will never cause you pain
Well, maybe just a little
Step inside - don't be afraid
This old cage is now your cradle

I'm a nasty human being
Banished from society
I'm rejected by the angels
Even hell refuses me
I am merely a deliever
Healthy profit is my goal
I scar and mutilate your children
For a royal bag of gold

For as long as high society
Spends this much on luxuries
There'll be wolves around
Just like me...
