I'm a part of nature's design
I never chose to be this way
Every mouse should know when to hide
And every doggy has its day
You know well my social status
So respectfully decline
I provide a higher service
To the leaders of mankind

Now don't patronize me judge
As the hypocrite you are
I remember you as cruelest
Most disgusting one of all
When I'm dead there'll be another
And another one after that
For each rotting corpse
Brings out rats...
