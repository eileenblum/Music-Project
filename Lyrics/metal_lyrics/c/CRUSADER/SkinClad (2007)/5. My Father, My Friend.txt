Every poem fails to rhyme
Every song is out of key
Food is tasteless
At night I wake and cry
My life becomes unreal

You have fought, my friend
Celebrate the demon slain
Embrace your life ahead
For on that day
The gods rewrote your name

Every face looks like a grime
Every voice calls out to me
My hands are useless
All day it blocks my mind
My life is bound to thee

You have fought, my friend
Celebrate the demon slain
Embrace your life ahead
For on that day
The gods rewrote your name

You are free, my friend
The Reaper holds your broken chain
In awe he bows his head
And from his list
He kindly strikes your name

Every face now seems to smile
And every song's in key...
