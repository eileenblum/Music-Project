I could never leave you
Or ever see you go
My life depends upon you
My heart just couldn't stand the blow

I could never deceive you
Hurt you or cause you pain
My world evolves around you
Without you I'd go insane

All I wanna do
Is grow old with you

Roaring falls and rivers wild
Guide water to sea
From the day that we have first met
You've been guiding me
All our oceans couldn't survive
Without this royal feed
I'm endless like the sea
As long as you're with me

In my life I've been around
I've seen the come and go
Once I was a wild one
And I took my share of blows

But none of all those women
Could ever compare to you
You're the sun among stars
For you I'd die - that much is true
