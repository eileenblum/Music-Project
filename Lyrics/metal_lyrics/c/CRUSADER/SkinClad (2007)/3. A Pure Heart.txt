December night
Dark and cold
A newborn's on its way
All disputes on hold
To meet the future

A woman screams
A man cries out
A child has come our way
All fierce warriors fold
And greet the girl in turn

Now that you're among us
We'll never let you go

You can rule this world
Kings will kneel before you
And fight for you
As long as your heart is pure
Should all kingdoms burn
Make the world adore you
And they'll die for you
As long as you make sure
Your heart is pure

Snow is back
A year has passed
Many things have changed
Curiosity's made
Her eyes much brighter

One day soon
She'll be a queen
With pride we've passed our name
Her loveliness can slay
The bravest fighter
