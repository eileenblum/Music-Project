Have you ever heard
Of a leprechaun before
If not, it might be time for you
To learn a little more
Above all, I say this
They're not just a fairy tale
Last night one was in my house
He sure as hell was real

If you should ever catch one
On Saint Patrick's day
The merry fellow will submit
And give his gold away
He'll try to save his skin
And to you, so it is told
He will give without dispute
His precious pot of gold

Please leave them alone
And let their business be their own
They're only part of this world
Honour the leprechauns
They have done no wrong
So pack your stuff and run along
Don't make a foll of us all
They're only three feet tall

Don't you ever trade with them
Because before you know
They will surely pull a scam
Consider yourself warned
They always hold two coins
The first will turn to stone
The second one will once it's spent
Return to them, as known
