A quiet night
All stars are out
Disrupted by a roaring bike
He's all alone
He's going home
We've all been there before

Left nor right
No cars in sight
And slowing down's a waste of time
The blinding lights
The burning tyres
We've all heard'em before

Hey bartender, one more round
I need salvation
For me this year's been really hard
All I need's one more
Fill the glasses to the top
Don't be stingy
I need to drown my aching heart
Before I can go home

A violent crash
The street's a mess
He's got no choice but to confess
One last call
Pour drinks for all
We've all been there before
And now, out cold
With broken bones
Again he won't be coming home
A crying child
A distant sirene
We've all heard'em before
