[Lyrics by Filip Lasseel]

Staring in the darkness
Dreaming about lost victories
I hear the sound of distant pipes
Calling out to me

Father, I can hear you play
It brings back tears and memories
The lament of long lost regions
I will come to thee

Thousands of warriors getting near
All of them called back from the grave
The army you have sent for me
Mighty, fierce and brave

Take me to my father
Take me back to the past
I'll carry him inside me
Guide me to the stars

Xioban - my daughter - listen to me
Your tears are dry - the time has come
(To) defend the honour of our clan

Force the en'my from our house
The blood of our clan runs through your veins
Beware the blackness of their hearts

Lament of lost regions has been heard

Fought my way through the massacre
Everyone's hate was fixed on me
You, your mother and our clan
Gave me energy

I had to slay them one by one
Trying to reach the dark one's gate
I knew I had to stop him now
Before it was too late

One dark image blocks the sun
A giant warbird takes control
Its evil force shoots through my heart
Causing our clan to fall

Nothing more that I can do
My army slain - my power gone
I ride with Satan, side by side
He takes my soul
(Now) I'm strong
