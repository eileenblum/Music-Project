[Lyrics by Filip Lasseel]

To you I'm just a memory
An image of the one you loved
My eyes are cold and empty
When I'm looking down from above
To you I might be nothing
But I'm very much in pain
I realize I've lost you
And it's driving me insane

By the Lords that rule this world
I swear I will return
For my Kingdom and my Love
I'm shouting out

Iris tried to take my life
Deprived me of this coil
Here's my soul
And I know...

She only took my body
The mortal flesh
Here's my soul
And I know...

That even death can't keep us apart

Kneel beside my body
Never let it fall apart
From the smell of my withering flesh
To the stains on your sleepy heart
Reconquer my empty shell
Feel the armour on my back
Demons enter heaven
Only death can bring me back

By the Lords that rule this world
I swear I will return
For my Kingdom and my Love
I'm shouting out
