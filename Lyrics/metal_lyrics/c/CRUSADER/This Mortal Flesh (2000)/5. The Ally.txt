[Lyrics by Mark Theunssens]

For ten thousand years
I fought every war
All engaged my skills
It was what I was living for
Violence kept me alive
I lived hard and fast
Each battle I survived
Always thinking it would be my last

Son of a thousand fathers
Bearer of no name
Keeper of your nightmares
Incentive to your pain

I ride my fearsome horse
I swing my poisoned blade
He who calls upon me
Embraces death as fate

I never chose a war
It would always find me
Never could I turn my back
It was where I had to be

Summon me as your ally
If you know the spell
I will slay your enemies
And you will pay your debt to Hell

The image that reflects
Right before my eyes
Is made of pain and misery
Scarlet flashes are all I see

You cannot flee
For I have come for thee
I'll take you on a journey
You will go back to Hell... with me
