[Lyrics by DeathKnight]
[Adaptations by Filip Lasseel]

Slowly walk the western wave, 
Spirit of the night
Leave your eastern cave

Wander over land and sea, 
Chase away the light
In dreams of dark appear

Your mortal thoughts be heard in heaven
Driving everyone insane

Clothe yourself in capes of grey, 
Stud your crown with stars
Blind the eyes of Day

The sun is set, all are asleep, 
Only bats fly fast
And I in corners creep

Your mortal thoughts be heard in heaven
Driving everyone insane

I can't see clear through your mind
But I can feel the demons haunting you
I can't read it in your smile
Lady wouldst thou me

When I arose, the light was riding 
High into the sky
How I wished for you

The dew was gone, day turned to rest 
Like an unwanted guest
How I longed for you

Thy brother Death is also crying 
To sleep near your side
And I replied...

Now I've lost the art of sleeping 
And Death will come for me
Night, I love thee
