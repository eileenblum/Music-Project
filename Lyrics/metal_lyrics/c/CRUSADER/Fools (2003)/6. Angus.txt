[Lyrics by Filip Lasseel]

We demand some recognition
For it is our god given right
Shout it out
The world must listen
For finally the clans will unite

I've seen them march downhill
And I will lead them on the field

My name is Angus
I won't be falling
I want a country of my own
I've seen those liars
They'll soon come crawling
I want a true king on that throne

I command a glorious army
For freedom these patriots will fight 

We protect our lawful legacy
Assailing the English with all our might

We decline any servitude
No man abides by English law

See approach proud Edward's power 
We'll leave as free men or slain be all
