[Lyrics by Claudia Rasschaert]
[Adapted by Filip Lasseel]

Walking the forest roads
In search of the truth
Hundred years of agony

The voice of the Lord roared
"It's all up to you"
"You will set the people free..."

Archangels call upon me
To take command of the troops
Embark on the mission the Lord has given me

I left the strawberry fields
Of the river valley
My Lord and Master leading way

Hundreds of miles I covered
To finally claim
My inheritance, my God given name

Archangels call upon me
To take command of the troops
Embark on the mission the Lord has given me

I fear the pain
But with the Lord beside me
Everyone's heard of my name
Armoured and confident
I'll crown the King
France will be rightfully reclaimed

War against the English
Many young men died
A century of pain and fear

Many buried their children
All have known great loss
God forsake this hell we've seen

I, Maid of Orleans
Devout saint of God
Brought victory to the whole of France

I, Joan of Arc
Accused of heresy
Rewrote history, changed the past
