[Lyrics by Mark Theunssens]
[Adaptations by DeathKnight]

The church in need of resurrection
To restore the unstable faith
Challenged the unbelievers

The holy city would be saved
Lots of true believers
Were eager to participate

As many a king and knight
Were lured by the bait

We rode off to another battle
It would lead to another raid
Depredation our inclination

Doing God's work was well paid
Conveying extrication
Salvation given by the sword

Butchering all heathens
Who didn't submit to our Lord

We are Crusader
On a rise of revenge
Avenge the crucifixion of our Lord
We are Crusader
On our chest we wear God's mark
All of us were summoned to fight the dark

Words of chivalry were spoken
They were washed out by the wine
Promises of a truce were broken

Easy killing so divine
Devotion was our weakness
And the church our alibi

Raping pagan women
Only to purify

After a day of carnage
Everyone was caught
Seventy yards from paradise

The final battle would be fought
We found ourselves surrounded
By armies covered in gold

We had nothing to offer
Our souls had all been sold

Seven days the battle lasted
We were falling one by one
Even for knights there was no quarter

Left to die in a red hot sun
Captured cities retaken
Payback time had begun
Villagers were slain
God's army on the run
