[Lyrics by Filip Lasseel]
[Adaptations by DeathKnight]

Streets filled with joy
Children come out to play
Worries far gone
The world seems to have fun today
All colours bright and gay
Are whirling around
Cheerful music plays
Hypnotising sounds

Oh, on with the show
On your darkest day
Oh, these clowns you enjoy
Your children, I rape

We're harlequins of deceit
Hiding behind our paint 
Midgets and freaks 
Enticing your kids away
This glorious pageantry
Threatens your town
Chanting gallantly
We are tradesmen of the young

Hysterical countrymen
Protect their progeny
Fools drawing swords
Like flowers with useless thorns
Families torn apart
By our side-show of fear
Our very bitter carnival
Will challenge who's near
