[Lyrics by Mark Theunssens]
[Adaptations by Crusader]

In this time
When brother poisons brother
To secure his grip on the throne
Kings believe lies told by others
Since long their hearts have turned to stone

Do we look to anyone who bothers
Before this kingdom will be torn apart
Do we pray to the holy mother
To find us a king who is pure of heart

Stop the clansmen fighting
We are king of kings
A mighty warrior, pure of heart
King of kings
The legends write my name in blood
King of kings
The land will soon be free

Don't fall for monks
And their sermons
Empty words do not sooth the pain
Nor do they fill our hungry bellies
Or provide shelter from the rain

Now the king... is slowly dying
Greedy lords rape the land like a whore
Loyal servants are mourning, crying
While they drink the spit from the floor

People survive... on bread and water
In the court they're drunk from the feast
The king has died and his son succeeds him
The line of tyrants provides another beast
