[Lyrics by Filip Lasseel and DeathKnight]

Silent shadows
Disturb the snow
Vast remains of a world we used to know

Distant thunder
Is pounding low
The eve of death has never felt so cold

Dogs are howling
For they all know
The raging terror crawling from below

The evening sky
A million crows
Tortured souls

The twelve will soon be gone
As was foretold
Thousands of outcasts moving along
Seven years
Through the snow

Let them be lords for one day
Their quest for freedom is bound to fail
Go tell the sun we're on our way
Come with us
Prevail

From their high thrones
The stars look down
The face of night with light like hope does frown

A painful breeze
The breath of god
Chases twelve to the mountains where they fought

The mist that hung 
Upon the trees
Upon the mountains they fought the mystery

Of mysteries
That no one sees
They fought belief

The airs that brood over solitude
Palpitate in the hearts of their troops

The twelve have fought
What remains unseen
They fought belief
