It's time for dark
Now has come like fever
The shining of black mark
Shall provide the darkness forever
Bewithched worlds stay
The christianty pray
To their unexistent God
Praise hail the death of goat
Enlightened world
Now ask us for mercy
But life wilt not be
Wait and see
I see bloodred skies
And I shall see how last demon and angel shall die
The existence of life shall stop
We'll drink thy last blood's drop
Sacred blood....

These earths washed in clean angel's blood
The corpse of last arcangel lies here
Burned wings of demons blacken the soil
Life is dead , presence is unclear
