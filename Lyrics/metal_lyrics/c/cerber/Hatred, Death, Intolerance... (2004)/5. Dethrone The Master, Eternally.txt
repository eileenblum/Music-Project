Term is blood stained,
Thy hands are washed by lies
Diligence are bleeding,
Thy times dies
Your love is destroyed now,
By ignorance end of thine
Your fields are blood-soakedand soon death to your kind
The time like a sand falls
Unto the down of the clock
Thy lands are dying,
They are compressed by smoke
Your caress ness leads you
To bottomless abyss
And new preachers will be
From above on you piss
Deprivation of Laws and Death
Painful death with grand part torture
How nice to see thy last breathe
Deprivation of Laws and Death
Scornful defeat, you are dead
How nice to see your body shreds
Many deaths on your conscience,
Seems forgotten but not.

All what did in past,
Shall return, and rise by rock in throat
But what you don't remember
I'll remind you
I waited this day and time is over and blood is spilled to
You shall be exiled,
On the new emperor change
It's natural, my dear,
It's could not seems strange
Ash it's what is now,
From thy empire
Thou art death,
We had this desire
But we waited more 2000 years,
Now we here
You were not ready to this event,
But thy end was near

How you ask me:
- Why I am, What Am I?
I answer you:
- Thy death is came and you shall die

How dying culture is breathe
I cannot tolerate
To this thou criers,
Solved you pitiful fate

How you ask me:
-Who Am I, Why I Am?
I answer you:
-Your time is over, you are ended

[Astral cogitations by Neron]

Deprivation of Laws and Death
Painful death with grand part torture
How nice to see thy last breathe
Deprivation of Laws and Death
How nice to hear thy pitiful cry
Thou shalt DIE!!!
