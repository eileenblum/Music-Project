Obliteration
Death from above seek destinationon earth
From galaxy beyond
They ride on the black wings of hate
World is worthDeath and beyond
Cometh fly through the eternity to crush the world
Saws the fire
Fire is reign seventh dimension
After thy body shall gets cold
Black prophecy is done
The prophecy of death
There shall be armageddon
Terrible event
And world shall be crushed
And face of God shall be smashed
Earth shall be renewed
By armageddon we comprehend the truth
Risen from ashDeath's days crawls near and near
Nocturnal dust
And predicted horror dark fear
My eyes shines
In center of five galaxies and observe
How humanity dies
And death write my signy
A warriors of north
Black prophecy is done
The prophecy of death
There shall be armageddon
Terrible event
And world shall be crushed
And face of God shall be smashed
Earth shall be renewed
By armageddon we comprehend the truth

[solo by Neron]

Firebirds are flying
Invisible for eyes
And they burn the
Gods fields of
Eternal curiosity and angel's cries
Death to humanity
Death to christianity
And death shall come to you
Before you didn't receive life
When you are young
Carreless live you
In thy dreams you are falling unto theabyss of "dark lord"
Before thy flesh is virgin
And thy mind is didn't desecrate
I hear damnation calling and I Know
I know humanity's fate

[solo by D. Northdark]

I KNOW
