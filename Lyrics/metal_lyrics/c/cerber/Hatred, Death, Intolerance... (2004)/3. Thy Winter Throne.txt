Embraced in eternal frost
Mighty mountains of coldness
Calls thee to endless journey
Summoned by winter's breathe
These frosty fields of snow
And seas of frozen waters
Eternal life in the lifeless ice
Hidden the wisdom of greatest
Ice queen reigns this realm eternally
In lonely majesty she sits in castle
She sits on cold frozen throne
The throne what now has gone
Once exiled far away in the depths
Now she is the queen of nothing
She waits thee in misty halls of frost
Perpetual life eternal cold brings
She is mornfull beauty eternal freezings exists
She sits on frozen throne in gloomy mist
She is the mistress of eternal cold
She reigns this endless world

Giants guards the gate to inferior realm
Where nothing dies where life is frozen
Thousands of icicles hang on the ceiling
It's all awaits thee, long time you are chosen
This world where snow grows eternal
And time flows imperceptibly and fast
The blazing in the north sky like fire
Enchanting thee, exiting thy lust
Surrounding the embankments of snow
Winter demons drive a round dance
Join to them and let this will be eternally
Please the winter queen's glance
