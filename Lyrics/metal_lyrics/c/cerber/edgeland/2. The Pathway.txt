Again I though about existence
Sailing trough the endless night
But now I was embraced in darkness
I was lying in mortal fright+
Antichrist is thy name+
I hear the summoning voices
Calling of shadowed places
Where I saw his ghastly face
Thou art I
So let father's will be done
I stood behind the burning abyss
Connected in whole, we are the sons
But our essences are uniform
Not by mother I was spawned
From the lava river we were summoned
By stars promised the end of mankind
So be it
