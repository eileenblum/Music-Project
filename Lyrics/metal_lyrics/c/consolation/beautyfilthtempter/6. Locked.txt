If every person should act the same
Life would be a boring item
At first time it might be no problem
But life takes away all of my consciousness
You wish the best until things start to change
Just like they always will do
I've found a dor that's fucking locked
And I cannot find the key

It drives me mad, it's fucking insane

Pure hate from my mind to yours
Wouldn't it be better to die
And check out the afterlife
I'd like to beliefe in myself
Beacuse it lookds like there's nothing
What's my destiny
I'm questioning life
Why do we live?
