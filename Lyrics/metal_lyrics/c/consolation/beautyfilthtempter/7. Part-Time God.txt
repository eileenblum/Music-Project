The sword cuts a wound in the earth
Breeding confusion
Cuts progressive growth
There's a storm approaching
Destined to ruin
Certified to demolish

Masters magic our decline
To clearer the sign
Extending lives
Leads to extinction
Part-time god
Our crucifixion

I see them die
But what for they do not know
Give me some faith 'cause I'm all lust
Get me some help, Wrath God
