Everytime I wake up you're gone away
Evertime I wake up life's going away
What you first were you don't even are
You spit on all of us you'll fade away
Wou've seen the light which brought you life
I recall the day whne all were one

With this never end, will this evelast
Even in this circle war has won
Won't you even change your name

Everytime I wake up you're gone away
Evertime I wake up life's going away
I hope that one day when all think as me
We'll ignore you, you need us, then you'll die

Hey listen
For all of you

"Can you imagine enhoying yourself
Without the sphere, it's ridiculous"
Can you imagine playing your dream
But still clasping some "weak" dreams

Each side of laughter, there's still the pain
You critisize but we stay the same
Just show some respect and take your shit back
Just remember you ever were once just like us
