Promises based on lies
Leads me to doubt myself
Fucking bastards pardon me
But if I could I will
Destroy, molest you
Lead you to your downfall

Woman, slave of man, mankind
Man has the right
To teach upon his wife
Raped in marriage
Allowed, divine
It's all written
In there, their own bible

Rape in marriage
Allowed, divine
Virgin Maty, Jesus Christ?
Impostors?
Nothing but creation of the mind
Results of fear

What wrong interpretation?
Just like that one of yours
It's only a pretty alternative
Don't wanna be like you
A slave surrendered by
A one track mind
Look for once at yourself
Like sheep you're led
To the fucking end
