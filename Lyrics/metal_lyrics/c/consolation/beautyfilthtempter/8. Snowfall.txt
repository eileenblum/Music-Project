Massive attack of white flakes
Astonished by the time it takes
With fear I stare at teh scene
Traces where man has been

In every word in every tale
Can be made up taht it all ends up
In self-destruction

The thought of two never being one
Freezes your senses with fear
All of us and them do know
But all express differently

Man behave as the only beast
Amongst animal with hate kill
And selfish consumption

Proud of what?
