Right between your legs
I see the blood spilling
Rotting imaculate
Right into your eyes
I See your hatred
Running red to them

Fear is what shuts you up
Your carefree life is disturbed
By the explosion of a ripe fruit
Parental interference is the case
Of your ignorance
Whilst shame doesn't help you anymore

That you and more will be the lesson
For authorotive parent
To see their faults
And think more clear
Before breeding
Before they know it
Their will causes death

Immaculation
Beautyfilth

So your daddy forbid you
To ask about dirty things
Your advice from friends
To use a plug?
It got stuck and rotting
You're screaming helplessly
