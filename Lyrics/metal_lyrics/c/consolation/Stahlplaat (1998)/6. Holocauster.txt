Power, fuel mass decay
Doomsday a heartbeat away
Bleeding, heal what is scarred
Dying
Slowly we are
Cities were left burning they were made of straw
Show the world what power is, raped by your own laws
Oceans were left boiling under a bleeding sky
An evolution in reverse, an open wound to cauterize
Take what's rightfully mine
Mountains left to crumble, so they did before our feet
The gods of the apocalypse, accepted their defeat
Postcalyptic landscapes, where no man can survive
Waiting for the end of tim
The end of time
Bleeding, bleeding
Dying
