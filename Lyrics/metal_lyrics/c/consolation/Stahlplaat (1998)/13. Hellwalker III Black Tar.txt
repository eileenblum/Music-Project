Hellish fires, not far away the purpose of our journey
When flesh meets flames and flames make fortune our fortune fairy tales
There's a pot of gold but not at the end of the rainbow but still the end is near
Cause you may bow and he will reign and the beginning of reignbough he snears
Hellish fires no far away the purpose of our journey
When flesh meets flames and flames make fortune our fortune fairytales
Adorned in second world war uniforms they leave behind with long hair
Screaming through hellish fires they possess the so called ultimate position
Now killing forever to empower the hooligan
Wheels covered with flesh and blood of helpless profile tattooed hellwalkers
No proposals, premature settlement will overtromp hated life
High speed machines searching for a total isolation
Wheels covered with flesh and blood of helpless profile tattooed hellwalkers
No proposals, premature settlement will overtromp hated life
