What is this I've been through, started no so long ago
I was feeling empty until you came along
I'm better than empty
I'm better than empty
I'm better than empty
I'm better than empty
Now I've lost my mind and soul like I always do
Tempted once I was now cured because you came along

Hello holiness
Hello holiness

Wrath
You have sucked my veins but that's not all, cleared my mind and make me crawl
I bow for thy oh sergeant P. 666 and blasphemy
