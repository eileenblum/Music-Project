Peasants condemned for all eternity, blocking, disturbing a passage once so sacred
Through all the years times have changed
Entering a psychosoma tic lifeform revolting and killing it's the same
Because he now rules till the end of time
Psycho wheels made men all with hirsuted faces causing trouble at every place
The appropriate for their crusade of dead and perdition
