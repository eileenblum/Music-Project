Riders of evil stalking the streets with chainsaws and clutches the next victim bleeds
This road of horror is filled with terror
Hail to all powers who conduct their defeat
First gear she screams the second there is silence
Like lambs to the slaughter the result pure violence
Route 666
The root of all evil
Burn your crosses or we'll turn medieval high way to hell a bad place to be?
For me just infinity the answer the key
Third gear he's out the fourth there is silence
Like lambs to the slaughter the result pure violence
Arbeit macht frei aber meine gibst freude wir sind auf dem weg nach ungottliche hohe
Kickstart down the join excessive
Rebuilt the holocaust
Beware

Through valleys of darkness we ride the wind searching for flesh to forfill our needs
He prevails and we shall follow, like hounds do foxes like whores will swallow down
