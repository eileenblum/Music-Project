Sometimes I close my eyes
Sometimes I open my eyes
But the view remains the same
Surrounding me is prejudice
And Melvin... that's my name

Grave disorder
White mans greed
Oppressing millions
To plant the seeds
Seeds were planted
But in the wrong way
Melvin, that's my name
And I'am black is that OK?

Brave Melvin
From the Southern point

And now we're in the nineties
And do things have changed
Changes are so many
But prejudice stays the same
The seeds are planted
But in the wrong way
Melvin is my name
I'm black is that OK?

Brave Melvin
From the southern point

Heading for the future
The pace of life increased
For making lots of money
The business man agrees
Modern day enslavement
And we all sing along
Selling souls and culture
Again we are wrong
