Your eyes are not yours
They're robbed
From so called trash-people
Aren't you ashamed of their deaths
I'll confront you
With a horrible reality

Open your eyes
See their graves
Aren't you ashamed
Aren't you a-fucking-shamed

Doctor says that it will take two weeks
Unlimited supply

Your eyes are worthless
But what do you care?
You'll get some new ones
From some one who's useless anyway
It's no more distorted
The view on your life
But soon it will fail
And you will pay with your life
