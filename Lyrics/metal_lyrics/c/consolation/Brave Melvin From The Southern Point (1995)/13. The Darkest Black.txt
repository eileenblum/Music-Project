All hordes prepare for this final war
The everlasting infinity
It's in the black of our hearts

Unite all hordes
Prepare to hail
Praise all the callers of storms
And chant to the darkest black

The only sound
Tormenting here
Are the storms of black fucking metal
Master hymns

The fire is gaining power
Hail to the darkest black
