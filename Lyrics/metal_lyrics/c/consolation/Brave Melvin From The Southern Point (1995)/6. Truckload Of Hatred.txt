Organised religion is fake
The excuse of weak minds
Guilty of slaughtering
Millions and millions
On the innocent ones

It's fucking hypocrite

But still there's blood
On their name
They ain't got shame
They go on
With their sick
Religious rituals
Their only relief
Of all their fears

I respect all religions
Without blood on their hands
But if I look at the past
Burning heretics
In the name of god
Even now they kill for god
The non-believer is a traitor
So sick of the view all day
Hate growls my mind
Into my mind

All that hate
