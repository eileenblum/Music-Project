Lusts of the flesh
Pleasures of the flesh so divine
It creates pain
I become slave of the lusty greed
Tempt me with your treasures
Chastise me for my desires

Frost bound squeamishness
Restrain me from
Committing my venial sin

Strange mysterious
Hunger you must feed
Divine experience
Hunger you must feed

Useless trying to release
This urge all have inside
Take a look behind the door
The hidden sins now come to life
