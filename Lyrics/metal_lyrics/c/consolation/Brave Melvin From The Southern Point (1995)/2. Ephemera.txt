Born... out of the womb
I've been torn
Killed by my own breeder

But my spirit lives on
To see the horrors
They've planned with me

Ripping out of my little chest
Undeveloped slimy entrails
Making place for what seems to be
White snow that kills humanity

Ephemera

I'm both the body and the bag right now
I see us passing the border of betrayal

Used... all my life
Has been refused
What life?
