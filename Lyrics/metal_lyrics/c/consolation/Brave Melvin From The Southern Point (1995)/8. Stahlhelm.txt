You're still alive
You have no right
To judge upon them now

Your Nazi youth compost ideologies
Were used before
Resulting six million dead

You wanna die with
The gun on your head
Why don't you kill yourself
Before we face another world war
You don't even know what your hate
Exactly goes for

Feeble screams beware
Of something we all think of

The trick is to oppress that thought
Before we all go join them

Look around you
You'll see the same thing too
