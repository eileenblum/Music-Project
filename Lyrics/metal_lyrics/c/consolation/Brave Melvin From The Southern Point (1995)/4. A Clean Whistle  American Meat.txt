Why deny the future
Of mankind
Lays in our hands
You waste it

Playing the global hero
Only for your own
Self-interest welfare
None more you care

Why deny the future
Of mankind
Rest on your back
Your sole goal

Who'd think
To challenge now

Interfere only when your
Assets in danger
Acting as judge
Crush all our trust
Sword of Damocles
Above our heads

For all the wars
You must have fought
Taste defeat
American meat

Mighty trust crusher
