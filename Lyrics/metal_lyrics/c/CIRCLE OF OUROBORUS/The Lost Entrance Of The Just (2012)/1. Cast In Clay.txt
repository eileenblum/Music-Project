The womb of silent procreation
Is breathing in its own pace
Like an eye of the storm
Which sleeps but doesn't close

Instinctive movement
Eight stances of meditation
Without thought or meaning
The eternal circulation

The song without sound
And the unwritten notes
The invisible move
And the churning dance

The shoreless sea encircles
The birth and the dive
Breath water and energy
Drink air and grow, reach the shores

Instinctive movement
Eight stances of meditation
Without thought or meaning
The eternal circulation

The phantom and the ghost disappear
Materia flows to the mould
The hymn of the heart will
Never wither silent
