I draw my bow and let the arrow fly
My heart will follow it across the sky
Through the clouds and layers of air
Into the mighty shining lair

Ride the wolf
Across the vast fields
Cling to fur
Fur of diamond rays

Seven torches cast their light and shadow
On every mountain peak and meadow
In the heart of this glorious beast
Condense the powers of kings

Its howl will pierce every single ear
The radiance to wipe out every tear
The lids of our eyes and the lids of our graves
So many to crush and so few to save

I raise my sun-shaped goblet high
And the crescent dagger shines bright
I wait for the order from the lords of the flame
To slit and drink and fly away

"Sirius rises late in the dark liquid sky 
on summer nights, star of stars
Orion's dog they call it, brightest
of all, but an evil portent bringing heat
and fevers to suffering humanity"
[-Homer]
