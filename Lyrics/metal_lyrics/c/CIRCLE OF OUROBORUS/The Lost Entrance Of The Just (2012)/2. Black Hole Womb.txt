An embryo in the dark
In the perfect nothingness
A small figure in the corner
Of the church of a veiled god

Black hole womb
Circles and whirlpools
Black hole womb
Ready to break through

Through the black mirror
The light that devours all
Galaxies are crumbling to ruins
A foundation of my victory

A scaly umbilical chord
My rosary, their noose
I breathe and absorb
Every molecule is my slave

Black hole womb
Circles and whirlpools
Black hole womb
Ready to break through

And when all that you know and all that you dream
Has passed the line and turned upside down
You'll see how there is a spark in a  skull
A black light burns the starry ground
