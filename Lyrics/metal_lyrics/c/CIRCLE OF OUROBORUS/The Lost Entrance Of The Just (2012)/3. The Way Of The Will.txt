Those who reach to the stars don't live with them
And those who see themselves in the mirror
- They are frightening men
Those who touch the cold surface don't feel the heat
Those who wander in the dark side of the moon
Only have dust under their feet

I am not one of those who seek only life
Nor one of those obsessed with death
I balance on the knife
I'm ready to open my heart and let enter it all
The universe with its joyful demons
- And sleeping gods
Are you ready to heed the call?
