From the earth to the sky
What you see is what you own
Take a glance and stretch your view
Swallow this universe with your eyes

I am the comet flying backwards
A quill of fire taken from phoenix's tail
When the stars come home
I paint the tree on the sky

My feet have touched this soil for too long
Too many years in the sorcerer's lonely chamber
I have opened my mind so I open the door
To bring my thoughts to practice

I am the comet
A quill of fire
