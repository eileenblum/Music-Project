Roots as tunnels
- Tunnels of Set, tunnels below
Worms as doves
- Doves of peace, doves of war

From the hills through the night
Give a blessing to the thirteen moons
From the temples around the bends
Fall asleep when the nightingale croons

Dreams as guides
- Dreams of a sun, dreams so long
Starry schemes
- Schemes to untie the right from the wrong

Borders as shadows
- Shadows of fools, shadows of moons
Walls as mirrors
- Walls are built by our ignorance

Let the hammer of wisdom fall
Ignite the torches of our goddess
Let her walk with us
In the shadow of her horns

Like kings in a deck of cards
Two have become one
Connection made in a thousand ways
I split my soul to feel more
