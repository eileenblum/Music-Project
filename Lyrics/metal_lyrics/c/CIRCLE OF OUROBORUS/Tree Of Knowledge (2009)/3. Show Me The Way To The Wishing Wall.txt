I've been waiting and wailing / on the ground with rotten fruits failing / away from our shores sailing / fearing the serpent scaling / Then in the spring you come / and this heart burns with shame wintry shapes are undone you violate and I am to blame / This is when the truth reveals it surrounds the minds entwined once again my heart it steals / lulls to sleep with a restless lie / Then we are both lonely / and I am standing there / I could wish you to hold me / to turn down the warmth of your stare / But you know me all too well / to such foolish hope to agree / you just escape like the sound of a bell / even if I could never make you flee / So we pass in silence / and the passion freezes once more / you keep slipping through my fingers / for greater minds to adore
