Who has cast this shell? / who has cast this empty shell? / who has broken the surface / and let enter the hell? / Warmness before emptiness / before the tamed waves / I burn to the core a lifetime in a day / But now these scorched hands they touch my memories but now through my fingers run the wind and the freeze I have become so frail / I have become so fatally frail / I have burned all the leaves / and all the prayers / Hopelessness is my goal / my wide open door / a bitter life in pieces / I hunger for more
