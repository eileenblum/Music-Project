Eyes are the mirrors of your souls, they say / but I'm so blind, a castaway / I tried to get into my thoughts / I endeavoured to rise, not to fall / Dead eyes, dead eyes... dead soul / The mirror and the reflection / my life and its destruction / Is this rot in or out of me? / Are my eyes too dead to see? / While walking among these graves / of living, breathing names / they look at me with their stars / they are looking into my scars / Dead eyes, dead eyes... dead soul / Stitches in my dried flesh / two pits for you to bless / these prospects of sin are erased / two pearls gone, I'm saved / White and thin like paper / like a hollow egg shell / something so fragile / can't keep your soul / it has flown away / with the sin of this world / the new inhabitant is here / free, streaming wisdom
