A lonely melody / from the white skeleton keys / a distant sorrowful requiem / The suffocating soil / transforms into air to breathe / around my narrow realm / A maze of roots / under the woods / hear my call / answered by all / all these kingdoms / houses without windows / rulers and kings / eyeless they sing / A lonely melody / accompanied by the choir of ages it reaches the tops of trees / an under world cult / praising the shapeless one / icon like abstract form / These mouths suck / every drop / from our veins / from pleasures and pains / Inverse, rebellious bitter sweetness / sprinkling the herbs on this sadness
