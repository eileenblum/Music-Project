Rotten fruits / abhorrent harvest / we gather skulls / instead of fertile joy / The twisted fruit of doom / we enjoy your luxuriance / the twisted fruit of doom / the ending of our innocence / This cold August / delivers its offerings / we sink our teeth / into dead meat / The twisted fruit of doom / we enjoy your luxuriance / the twisted fruit of doom / the ending of our innocence / Morbid incense / of this bloody garden / we breathe dust / the pollen of future death / Soulcages in my basket / all are coming here / dismal celebration / drink and feast! / The twisted fruit of doom / we enjoy your luxuriance / the twisted fruit of doom / the ending of our innocence
