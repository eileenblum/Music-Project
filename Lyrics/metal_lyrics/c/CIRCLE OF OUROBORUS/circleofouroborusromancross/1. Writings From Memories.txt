Memory of the autumn sphere
Memory of the cheerful trips
Memory of the face of love
Of the warm fingertips

Memory of the darkened noon
Memory of the darkened woods
Memory of the words of love
Of the warnings, of the care

Memory of the gown of night
Memory of the solid dark
Memory of the fear of love
Of the rotten bark

Memory of the gap of death
Memory of the spiritual fall
Memory of the shape of love
Of the never ending fall
