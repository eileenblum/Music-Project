I wake up at the night by whispers
The blue winter is full of fear
But it calls me with its kisses
Its charm impervious

Moonlight is invisible
Only stars reflect light
But it's darkness that leads me
Through crippled trees

Darkness leads me to death
And I follow darkness

Over the frozen lake, the great mirror
Which spreads this light around
Across the wolves and their howl
Through the souls and their screams

Through the nail-filled air
Into dark caves
Over the dead mounds
To the realm of death

Darkness leads me to death
And I follow darkness
