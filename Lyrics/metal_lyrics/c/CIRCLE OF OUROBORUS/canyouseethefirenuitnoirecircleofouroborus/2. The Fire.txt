Weary lights in my soul, they vanish one by one
I wait for your flame, the final blaze
Summon the cradle for nightmares and worms
In the gleam of flames reveal yourself

The fire...

The brightest flame is not red, it glows in all white
Black shadows getting darker - The hidden procreation
In the boiling ocean without any drops
In the boat of iron, in the torturing casket

I travel down...down...down...
Against my fate
Against the last fire
Against the dance...
...of light and shadow...
...of life and death...
...of my Master...
...of my Master...
