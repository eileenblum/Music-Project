Weak believing is just hallucinating, faith is just a dying glow
Gods reveal to be plaster statues waiting for the crack, waiting for the blow
My inner sanctum stands untouched - My steel circle stands uncrushed

Impossible burden to bear or swallow, omnipotence is the great weakness
My pride lies hidden scars, black poisoned heart - is the secret

The lowest will not be crushed, the lowest will not yield
Those who drank the hollow illusion, they were blinded and they fell
They were stabbed and they fell, they were revealed and they fell...

Weak believing is just hallucinating, faith is just a dying glow
Gods reveal to be plaster statues waiting for the crack, waiting for the blow
My inner sanctum stands untouched - My steel circle stands uncrushed
