[performed by Circle of Ouroborus]The weight of the lead-grey lake on my shoulders
I travel through the forest painted by me
The others blaming without words
The leaves rustling in my chained feet
I feel the pain, the sorrow
And I know you would cry
But this is the joy, the sorrow
The only joy of my life
The memory of the sun fades from my mind
And the clouds drink the moist fumes
The depressed sorrow on my naked body
The draught of time freezing my skin
I feel the pain, the sorrow
And I know you would cry
But this is the joy, the sorrow
The only joy of my life
My journey forward the hope
Turns to the path of despair
Self-esteem leaves my soul
I feel the pain, the sorrow
And I know you would cry
But this is the joy, the sorrow
The only joy of my life
