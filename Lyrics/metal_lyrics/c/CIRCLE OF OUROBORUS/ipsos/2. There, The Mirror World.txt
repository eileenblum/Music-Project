Transparent ceiling, moss-clothed floor
Arm-wide, hell-wide walls, no key, no door

Just endless darkness embracing my skin
Just pale and cold and frozen feeling
Just one hope to touch the ceiling
Just one gaze for a tired, dead grin

Echoing ether, seaweed-waved chains
Loneliness everywhere, my half-life drains

I feel the locks humming around my heart
I feel when they rip my bones apart
I feel the urge to rise from the dark
I feel that someone carries my mark

There, the mirror world
Here, the reality
Here, the mirror world
There, the reality

Smiles, little feet, wandering men
Stones thrown and drowned, starting again

But now my soul shivers and it's not cold
But now I see the sun and it's gold
But now I rise so anxious and bold
There aren't chains that could me hold
