The peace, the bird, the lake
My moment of truth
My moment of facing my lies
My moment of unconscious understanding

Why am I here?
Who is with me?

The shores are empty
The islands are empty
No streams or waves
Just the open sea
Calm like me

Only the light
From the above

The light is glowing, glowing, reaching me
The rings are growling, growling, reaching me
The fear is coiling, coiling, reaching me
