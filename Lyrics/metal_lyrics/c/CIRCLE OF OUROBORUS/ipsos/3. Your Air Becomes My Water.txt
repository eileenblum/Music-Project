Your air becomes my water
Your water becomes my air
Your scream becomes your last one
Now listen to me and bare - yourself

This prison cell of loneliness
Is just a drop in my ocean of grief
The true vacuum is in me
In my half-heart and need - for you

My forehead against yours
The bridge between our thoughts
All entangled in you and me
Like triangles in harmony

Meditation for ages
Meditation through seasons
Learning, understanding
Until the ice breaks like thunder!

Mirrors are smashed into pieces
Reality seen through a kaleidoscope
We rise over this chaos as one
We pass the sentence and give the hope
