[originally by Joy Division]The confusion in her eyes it says it all
She's lost control
And she's clinging the nearest passerby
She's lost control again
And she gave away the secrets of the past and said
I've lost control again
And the voice who told her when and where and why she said
I've lost control again

And she turned around and took me by the hand and said
I've lost control again
An how I've never felt just why I don't understand she said
I've lost control again
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said
I've lost control again
And she's upon the floor; I thought she died she said
I've lost control again

She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control

And I had to phone her friend to state my case and say
She's lost control again
And she showed up all the errors of the states and said
I've lost control again
And she expressed herself in many different ways until
She lost control again
I walked upon the edge of no escape and laughed
I've lost control again

She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control
