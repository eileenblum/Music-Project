Blood and galaxies
Flesh and lucid dreaming fantasies
Tiny wounds and tenderness
Feverish life of nothingness

Like a gift of the blind god
You're thrown to the earth
Leaves as you're pillows
You slept through your birth

Come so close - That I can kiss
Your fiery skin - Of curse and bliss
Where is your father? Who is your mother?
I saw some shadows, your ancestors?

My morbid star
of inverted
ruined Bethlehem
Shine through me
Shrink these years
I can reach thee
I can see
I can see
