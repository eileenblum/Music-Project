Dissolved in the darkest groves
Where the birds get strangled,
not praised
The home of thousand spirals
Living, breathing, shedding its skin
Death can breed life
The tender kiss of grievous sting
Caress of the strangler
Cherish my lonely weeping spring
Thousand spirals, thousand castles
Thousand poisonous monasteries
Protect the well of infinity
Their white armour offspring
The ground covered old skin
The scale-dressed phoenix rises
Whiplashes of serpent tongues
Order them to advance
The groves are empty and
The nest dries and decays
Compliant body around
your heart
Fangs ready to strike
