Emanation
With insidious harmony raped
Here we come, beloved mother
Now we are the end

Incarnation
We are to die in sin
To die, die as the virtues
That no longer withstand

Incarnation
We are to fly within
To fly as the souls
Who no longer amend

Repetition
The great winter fires burn
Flames of might
Through gates of demonic light

Disintegration
We live as we die
And we're alive - we're so alive
In their broken arms
With our broken hearts
We really went there
Now we really are there
