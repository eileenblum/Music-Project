More we grieve, more we see
More we reach for self-deceit
More these wars, more these lies
God gets closer to suicide

This feeling fills me
This grieving fills me
Laughs and cries
Dances in my eyes

The celestial faith is just a breath
From the dry lips of the stave of death
So hear this prayer, you lord and guide
Every "amen" is a step close to suicide

At last, at last the hope is lost
It's time to gather for the last Pentecost

Now reveal your heart and take the golden knife
You're one slit away from your suicide
