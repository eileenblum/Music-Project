In the light
In the ceiling
The night bends
And shatters to dust

I'm awake
Feverish words
The dream is dead
My eyelids burn

The stars are dancing and taking a stand
I meditate and try to understand
A thousand Lines in thousand forms
Like weak leaves un autumn storms

In the room
In the walls
The cracks widen
And break the peace

My spine coils
Too many truths
The gold for lies
Betray my mind
