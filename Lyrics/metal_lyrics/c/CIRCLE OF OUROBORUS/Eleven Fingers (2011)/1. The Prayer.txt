My fingers are the artist's brushes
With cold bones and bloddy nails
Ten angels ok knowledge and art
Guides for malevolent trails

Crush my joints and cut my skin
Force my hands to pray
My life is a brick wall on the front of you
Full of heretic years and days

But now my pieces are joined as one
United with the whitest bride
I burn my selfish destinations
And never will this stream of rays run dry

The unification of ten elements
The alliance to gather the wild and the wise
Forget your days of joy and disgrace
Supress the laughter and their cries
