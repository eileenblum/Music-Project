I gather parts from the dark river
Like the old mother in the old story
The feet, the liver and even the smallest toes
I must gather them all
This is the secret task in the secret plan
I must darn the stitches right
The words are my needles
I enclose the horror and the fright
Dried are the veins and dried are the tears
The dark water has run back to its source
Spit and sand I use to make a whole
Now nothing fails and nothing falls
I inhale the sky and the virgin stars
Everything that is and could have been
All the paths and all the ends
Every leaf from these two trees
I give the soul to the body
The soul to the body and hear the gasp
I give the soul to the body
The soul to the body and feel the grasp
