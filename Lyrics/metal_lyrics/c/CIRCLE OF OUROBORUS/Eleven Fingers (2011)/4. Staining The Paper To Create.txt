Blue haze ghosts from the vlass bottles
Shapes to abstract nebulas
The space between my trembling hands
My fingers vleave the flocks of meteors

The brightest flame burns most rapidly
The artists skin is wrinkled in the morning
But the eyes pulsate as stars
The strength of my gaze shall carry far

A mortal creature breaking borders
The seed of infinity in the dead flesh
Thge claen paper is so young
You must stain your youth to create

Now when I sit on the steps of my tower
My fingertips turn to dust
But when I raise my gaze
It rides with comets forever
