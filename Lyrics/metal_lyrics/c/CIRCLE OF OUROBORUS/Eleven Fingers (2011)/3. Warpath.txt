My pulse is my mantra
The prayer oonly in my ears
The church bells of my body
Calling for swords and spears

Because this is the warpath
To the altar of sacrifice
Because this is the warpath
To crush these weak lies

Northern lights are blazing
Like the dragon under my skin
Downpour of heavy feathers
Can't hide the way of the kind

Winds of doubt and disbelief
Are washing my seekers eyes
But I travel through plasters casts
To destroy the inner idea of paradise

Because this is the warpath
To the altar of sacrifice
Because this is the warpath
To crush these weak lies
