The shadow in my glass of wine
The face on the lackluster surface
So is this the sign for the changes to come?
This hidden gate to the realm without law?

Unseen movements in reality
Two images in one form
Twins so different so alike
Jus flip the coin to choose your side

Angels aside, let me see the demon
The disguised beast behind the veil
Give me the order for these words
And thoughts that circle my mind

Now i drink the wine and swallow the shadow
Now i take my knife and slash this landscape apart
The source of impressions boils like blood from the wound
And strikes into my soul through my dead heart

The bridge is built and the streams flows
Abstract waves in this microcosm
My boat of nails and oars of ones
Shadows recurin the rivers grooves
