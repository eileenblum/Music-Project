i confess my sins to spruces 
this ravine is my church 
a cold colder than this cold 
world warms my bleeding heart 

the caress of branches 
the runes of roots 
secret message behind the leaves 
behnd this tihck wooden door 

i was born when wolves chanted their hymns 
i mourned with fall and rejoiced with spring 
now in this cavity 
i cloak myself with with nature's eternity 

i break the seal of bark the forest spread wisde 
fast faster than my ardent soul is the pace of death 
sympathy of the wolves 
the last last song 
my final unconscious meditation 
washes away every right and wrong 

i was born when wolves chanted their hymns 
i mourned with fall and rejoiced with spring
now in this cavity 
i cloak myself with nature's eternity 

one with this soil 
worms inside of me 
thousand pieces of my mind 
now shattered among sand stars
