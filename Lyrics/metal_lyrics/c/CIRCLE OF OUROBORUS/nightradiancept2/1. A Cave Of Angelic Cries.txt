descending from the silver throne 
crushing every vein and bone 
rebellion
in a downward way

holding a shield made of moon 
striking with the dagger of doom 
carnage 
with flames in your eyes 

drape this slaughter with virtues 
rape my mind with lies 
grave will unveil the corpse 
a cave of angelic cries 

breaking the chains of the beast 
laughing over the blood red feast 
thunder rips the heaven apart 
turning pale like a frosty ground 
facing my wrath unbound 
cranium as my cup of revenge 

fall into these golden spirals 
call for these golden demons
