shadows embrace me 
lights despise me 
and when i cry for my sanity 
cloisters still watch me 

now you enter me
now sacrifice for me
crawl to the altar and see
this all is me

mistrust, heresy, weak belief and infamy
mistrust, heresy, weak belief, now let it be

in the screeches of black ravens 
"fire beneath rain above" 
from the throat of the impaled priest 
"spill your blood, cleanse your soul" 

sinister aura around me 
awakening in me 
litanies of the future beast 
embody in me
