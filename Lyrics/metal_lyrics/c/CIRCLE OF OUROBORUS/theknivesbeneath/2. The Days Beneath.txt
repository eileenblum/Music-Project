Time bends
To circle
Nights slide away
From days
Landmarks are
Drafted away
The unknown
Is waiting for me... me...

My days are like
Morningstar's long ago
I excavate rock with my hands
Stone womb forms
As my sanctuary
Brimstone blesses me with warm
(Consolation)

Serpent verges
On my feet
It drags me through
The granite... the granite...

My days are like
Morningstar's long ago
I excavate rock with my hands
Stone womb forms
As my sanctuary
Brimstone blesses me with warm
(Salvation)

Here in my dark home
I don't feel any anguish
Death looses its absolute
Meaning
Life fills my every cell
Life like my streaming blood
Life... for me
Life... for all
It forces me
To swallow
The bitter sand
Of regret... regret...

My days are like
Morningstar's long ago
I excavate rock with my hands
Stone womb forms
As my sanctuary
Brimstone blesses me with warm
(Armageddon)

Life... for me
Life... for all
