Slow bending of this world
Seeing the face behind the mask
Total cleansing of blood
Falling of crowns
Beast claws deprive my role
In the grey I loose myself
I don't fear the vultures
They hunt for the carcass of lies

Different spaces
One object
Perception
From the skies
Presentation
Of reflection
Destruction
Of the holy

The books of false law burn
When predators start their chant
Fulfilment in chaos
Fulfilment in a black dream
Last one dying of this hall
Feeling the grief in his heart
I laugh when I rip my eyes
Blind lead the way to the source
Of wisdom... eternal...
Of wisdom... eternal...

Different spaces
One object
Perception
From the skies
Presentation
Of reflection
Destruction
Of the holy

Fiery wings
Rise the dust
Shattered vision
Tells the truth
It gives the weapon
Against the lies
Of the god
The absolute...

Twisting the knife of truth
Twisting the knife of truth
Twisting the knife...
Twisting the knife of truth

I leave my life behind
I don't gaze to the living
Gloomy funeral sceneries
Overwhelm in my eyes
