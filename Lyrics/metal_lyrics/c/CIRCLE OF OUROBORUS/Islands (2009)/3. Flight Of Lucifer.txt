Calm air dances on my golden skin
Black mountains smiling at me
Elitist solitude fills my lungs
As I dive into the valley
The faint sound of the crackling skulls
My road of disease and famine

This land, this sky, my creation

Wilted fruits and crippled souls
I leave them to fly again
I rise higher eclipsing the sun
And shining brighter than him

This land, this sky, my creation

You, my reflections in these islands
I glow through you in victory
Unholy winds of great torment
Around me, around me
I am the star which shines in the sky
Which burns its mark on you
