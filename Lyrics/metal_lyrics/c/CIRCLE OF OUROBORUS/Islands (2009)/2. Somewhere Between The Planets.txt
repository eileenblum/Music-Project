On the borders of the maps
Behind the degrees of latitude
Between mars and jupiter
I draw shimmering outlines

There where they sing
Those graceful songs
There where the stars are black
Where the sun devours its children
There where they sing
Those graceful songs
There where the stars are black

In the middle of sketches
In the failure of this mankind
I'm trapped in this fear
I see the human being

In the cauldrons of clay
Beneath the surface of bronze
Mixed with the molten core
There pounds the purest heart

On the dry lips of the dead
Here and somewhere else
In the snow of the universe
You see and hear my hearse

They sing, those songs
Stars are black, devour your children
