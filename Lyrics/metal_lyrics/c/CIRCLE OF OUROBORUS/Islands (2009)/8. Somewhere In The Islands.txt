Lucid dreams dies away
Eyes wide open gaze
Through the mist from the sea
Into the heart of maze

World devours my corpse
My blood is the waves
Transparent soul in fatigue
Feels the sands of grace

Last and total isolation
Bridges burnt away
Lines and veins cut
Grave left to lay

I see the shores of damnation
I feel the streams of death
I wash the last sins
Then take my first breath

This land of relieving loneliness
So greivous and serene
Like the crowns of sepulchre
So soft to feel

Then the mist rises again
And helps me to forget

I'm out of this useless world
I'm not alive or dead

I'm out of this useless world
I'm not alive or dead
