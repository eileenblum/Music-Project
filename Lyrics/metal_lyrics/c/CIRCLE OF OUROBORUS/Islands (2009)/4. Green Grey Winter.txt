Ash covered leaves, green grey winter

You can't wash these stains
This snow doesn't melt away
Black dirt always grins
Under the bleak coma white

Ash covered leaves, green grey winter

Still my hands grope for flames
They touch the soul of frost
Looking for the hidden seed
The hope is grotesque and vain

Sad still life weeps for spring
Ash covered leaves, green grey winter

The blue moment in the noon
Reveals to be the last of the lights
Caress the green joy from the tree of life
This cold season will wither us all
