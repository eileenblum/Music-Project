Day of loss, night to celebrate
Greet the shadows for their bliss
No joyful stars to salute
They hide themselves and miss
You...

When you fall to my feet
When you turn your other cheek
I touch the blood on your forehead
I see the fate of the meek
Day of loss, night to celebrate
Greet the shadows for their bliss
No joyful stars to salute
They hide themselves and miss
You...

No wings to fly
Just soil to kiss
No tears to cry
Just horns to meet
