[performed by Circle of Ouroborus]When I open the door in my chest and let enter the plague and death
My lungs inhale vast screams, every cell filled with downfall
I'm the gate for the lost travelers, the exit for hopeless men
Break your spears and leave your swords
Swallow the poison and walk through me
This is the eve of the battle that will change this world
Kingdoms will drown in blood and a new order will be born
I'm the gate for the lost travelers, the exit for hopeless men
Break your spears and leave your swords
Swallow the poison and walk through me
Blades grow from my fingers, my feet are the watchtowers
Use my eyes as beacons for the salvation painted red
Because this is the sacrament, the last landmark
Leave your body, carry your soul
Walk the path inside of me, soles cut by the sacred thorns
Smell the stench of victory in your burned and rotting flesh
This is the purest form of triumph
When you fall to your crushed knees
Nothing left to feast or share, just the barbed throne of pain
Leave your body, carry your soul
