[performed by Circle of Ouroborus]Collision
In the whirlwind's eye
Decision
To lose all faith
Rejoicing
Consecrate the doom
The brooding
Of the serpent seed
Cold moon, fiery sun
Behold the sky
The feast has begun
The morning
Birds with beaks of stone
The drowning
Into the dance of rays
Universe
Constellations collapse
The lost verse
Of the inverse genesis
Cold moon, fiery sun
Behold the sky
The feast has begun
Betrayal...
You must purge your soul
The trial
By fire and virgin snow
Collision
In the heart of the world
Decision
To destroy to rise again
