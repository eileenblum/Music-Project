Hinges slowly creaking
Staggering voices leaking
With a faint memory of hate
Resembling our divine fate
Woes of winter are behind
Springs of light trembling
Hand in hand we return
Finally to sing in unison
We give thanks for your breath, father
Unto your name we sing loud and wide
With silent tongues we speak
Plugging the srings of soul
Listening to the tunes of nature
Hear the unsettling melodies
It's the dawn of a new age
Pipers yielding at the gates
Mankind dressed to mourn
Ascension of Antichrist's reign
The master's returning to reap
Sorrowful, sorrowful, filled with joy
In glory and mercy the noble destroy
Dreams of men in rigid cloth
Struggling for nightsky to touch
An ending in the uttermost fail
With a breath divine the righteous bail
Elderly Saturnal men as moon's children
With a dying soul forsake the darkened coil
