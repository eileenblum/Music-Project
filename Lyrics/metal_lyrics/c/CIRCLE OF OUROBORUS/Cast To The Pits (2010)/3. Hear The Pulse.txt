In the heart of the rampant woods
In the virgin forest
You can hear the note, the pulse
Everlasting through the seasons

Fruit and seed and every leaf
All is humming to this song
Lions and mice and every bird
All is humming to this song

The spiral of thousand colors
Is spinning in the eye
Of this green vast field
In blind mindless ecstasy

Thunder and rain and every ray
All is humming to this song
Virtues and demons and every soul
All is humming to this song

All is screaming to this song
All is roaring to this song
All is chirping to this song
All is howling to this song
