In my mouth the winds were gone in a moment's time
Men never saw them or heard their sweet rhyme
Their sweet rhyme...

We felt their presence during daytime bliss
So we slept and dreamt of night in serpent's warming kiss
A soothing kiss...

What you cannot see
What you will not see
That all you shall dream
That is all you shall dream
