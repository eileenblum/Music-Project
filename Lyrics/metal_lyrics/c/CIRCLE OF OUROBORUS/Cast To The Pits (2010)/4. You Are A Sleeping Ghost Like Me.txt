You are a sleeping ghost like me
A hibernating soul in a dream
A touch in a mirror is all I receive
A crown in the dark, in a dream

Illusions of the end we live through
Twisting minds and cycles of moons
On a cliff we meet and embrace
Under us the dying human race

Is this for real and who will last?
The idea, the form or the cast?
We laugh and laugh and spread our wings
No need for answers, we just sing
