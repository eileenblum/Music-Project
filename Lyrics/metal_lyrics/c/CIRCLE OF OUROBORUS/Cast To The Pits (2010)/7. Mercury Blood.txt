A sketch of a man
In the corner of a page
A cell in amber
A shadow of a soul

From this step I rise
Transform and evolve
From nothingness
And its innocent purity

Transparent flesh
And mercury blood
Flowing and turning
Like a berserk storm

Feelings from the void
Immaculate thoughts
The first step forward
And the line on the ground

In this world I rule
Conquer and absorb
In this emptiness
And its expanding heart

Transparent flesh
And mercury blood
Flowing and turning
Like a berserk storm
Like a berserk storm
Like a berserk storm
