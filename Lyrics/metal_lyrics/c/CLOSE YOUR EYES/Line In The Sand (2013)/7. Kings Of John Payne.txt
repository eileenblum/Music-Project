First 5 minutes go too fast,
hold that moment and make
it last. 'Cos nothing can
buy back time and lately
I've been looking back
on my life. All my friends,
they always pulled through
for me, and I know that
they'd all say the same.
So if this world ever takes
your faith when you need it
most, know after all these
years, some things never
change. I can't remember
exactly when it made me
feel nostalgic, but the
songs on my car stereo
have started taking me
way back in time. When
my friends and I had 20
notes between us; no one
knew what the future held
or where our lives would
lead us. I never had a silver
spoon, I was careful not to
peak too soon. We've had a
lot of up's and down's. I'm
glad I stuck with you. 'Cos
all my friends, they always
pulled through for me and
I know that they'd all say
the same. So if this world
ever takes your faith when
you need it most, know
after all these years, some
things never change. I've
never had friends like the
ones I met when I was 12.
I mean, hey, has anyone?
I still remember all those
years and I go back to find
that familiar sensation with
nothing but the limits of my
own imagination. Let me
be a face in the crowd 'cos
I'm not ready for this to
be over. Take me the long
way around to the sound
of the summer with all my
friends. They always pulled
through for me and I know
that they'd all say the same.
So if this world ever takes
your faith when you need it
most, know after all these
years, some things never
change. It could be a while
before we see each other
again. It could be a while,
we'll see each other again.
And it'll be like it's always
been, 'cos time and dis-
tance don't mean anything.
We were the Kings of John
Payne, I'll never forget
it. And though we go our
separate ways, I still think
about those glory days. We
were the renegades in the
heat of the summer. Just
'cos I can't see it, doesn't
mean it's gone. Time can't
touch it, the feelings strong.
But if this world ever takes
your faith when you need it
most, know after all these
years some things never
change.
