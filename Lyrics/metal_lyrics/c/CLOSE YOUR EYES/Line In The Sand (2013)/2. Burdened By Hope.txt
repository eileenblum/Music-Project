If I wasn't born to lose then
why do I keep crumbling?
I can feel the place that
I call home. And every step
I take, I'm pulled three
back. I see the sea of faces
with their hearts on their
sleeve; they stare and do
nothing for all my screams.
You liar! You fake! You spit
poison in my face. You liar!
You fake! I'll never heed
the words you say. And
even when I'm at the end
of my rope, I'm broken and
hungry and burdened by
hope, I will push you away.
You liar! You fake! These
cries are growing louder
With each and every step.
How long til I'm done taking
whatever I can get? And I
regret the lies I tell myself.
These words are lacking
substance. I need to break
these wretched chains.
You liar! You fake! You spit
poison in my face. You liar!
You fake! I'll never heed
the words you say. And
even when I'm at the end
of my rope, I'm broken and
hungry and burdened by
hope, I will push you away.
You liar! You fake!
I will not sacrifice the way
I live, it's all for something
more. I don't believe you.
I don't believe a word that
you say because I know
there's something more.
I don't believe you. I'll never
fall for the games that you
play because I know there's
something more.
