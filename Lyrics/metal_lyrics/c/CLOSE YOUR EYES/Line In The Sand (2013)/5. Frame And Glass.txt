I've got a picture lying face down on the table top
that I haven't seen in years.
The frame and glass were once a part of me
that have slowly disappeared.

And I have been waiting for a long time, now don't keep me waiting.

I've got a rough idea what this whole things all about,
but I'm biting on my tongue
so I don't turn into a bitter old man
'cos of things I've never done!

'Cos I have been waiting for a long time, and don't keep me waiting.

Take me back to the days I didn't know,
I never ever agreed to let 'em go.
Over my head, in the thick of it,
smack bang in the middle of all of it.

Now I've got a picture lying face down on the table top
that I haven't seen in years!
The frame and glass were once a part of me,
but they slowly disappeared!

'Cos I have been waiting for a long time, and don't keep me waiting.

Take me back to the days I didn't know,
I never ever agreed to let 'em go.
Over my head, in the thick of it,
smack bang in the middle of all of it!

I tear myself away! (Away, Away)
Away, away, I tear myself away

Feels alright, haha!
In a teenage wasteland, never better!
There's no point sending a letter!

Take me back to the days I didn't know,
I never ever agreed to let 'em go.
Over my head, in the thick of it,
smack bang in the middle of all of it.

I have been waiting, and I have been waiting.
Don't keep me waiting, don't keep me waiting.

I had a picture lying face down on the table top
that I hadn't seen in years.
The frame and glass were once a part of me,
I won't let that disappear.
