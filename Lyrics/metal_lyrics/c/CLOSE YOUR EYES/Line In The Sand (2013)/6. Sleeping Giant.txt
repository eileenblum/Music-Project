[feat. Tommy Green Of Sleeping Giant]My right to live my life in
liberty, I feel has slowly
been restricted completely.
It ain't the right of just a
chosen few; this ignorance
has been repeatedly mis-
leading you. Rise up! Rise
up! Rise up like a sleeping
giant! You've awakened
a sleeping giant. I won't
give in to shock and awe.
You miss the reason and
the purpose we're fighting
for. This subdivision is
increasing now. My heart is
strong and it keeps beating
and beating you down.
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up
you sleeping giant! You've
awakened a sleeping giant.
Breed misdirection, birthing
deceit. You're on the wrong
side of my history. I know
my legacy, my father, my
name and I will crush fake
reality. Cowardly kingdom,
abusive fools. We'll expose
your fake legality. We'll
drag you kicking screaming
from the land and raise an
anthem to the heavenlies.
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up to
the sound of the revolution!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up to
the sound of the revolu-
tion! Wake up, you sleeping
giant. You've awakened a
sleeping giant. I am finally
awake. I know my legacy.
My father, my name. I'll
crush fake reality. I am your
kingdom. I am your name.
I am an anthem to the heav-
enlies. You can't take my
liberty, all the things I hold
dear or what's important
to me. You've awakened
a sleeping giant. You've
awakened a sleeping giant.
