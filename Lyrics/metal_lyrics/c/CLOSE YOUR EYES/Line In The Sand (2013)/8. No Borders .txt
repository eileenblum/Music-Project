No borders! No boundar-
ies! I need space between
my soul and the restrictions
around me. No borders
should enclose us. Why are
we caged by the lines on
a map? There's more that
defines us! Define freedom,
bring down the barricades
that rise between us! Ter-
raform and prepare for the
new wave. It feels like I'm
waking up for the first time,
the first time! Whoa, I'm
not getting through to you.
Whoa! You put your walls
up! You put your walls up!
Your borders just make
boundaries. Your borders
just make boundaries. Your
walls are building boundar-
ies that reinforce. Reinforce!
Free from search and
seizure, you've been busy
arid so have I. It seems your
loopholes weren't so water-
tight. Whoa, I'm not getting
through to you. Whoa, you
put your walls up, just put
your walls up! Your borders
just make boundaries. Your
borders just make boundar-
ies. Your walls are building
boundaries that reinforce.
Reinforce! They make you
wanna believe they have
control, they have control,
they have control of your
freedom and fortune. 'Cos I
just believe no man should
feel like a criminal when the
border line intimidate on
basic principle. 'Cos in the
end it comes down to how
long you're able to resist.
It's a shame so many can
relate to this. Your borders
just make boundaries. Your
borders just make boundar-
ies. Your walls are building
boundaries that reinforce.
Reinforce! That reinforce!
