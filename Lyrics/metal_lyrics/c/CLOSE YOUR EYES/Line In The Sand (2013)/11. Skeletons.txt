You've turned your back
on me! Yo, listen up. Take a
look around, take in all the
sights and sounds. Is this
how you thought it would
be? Experience is the most
brutal of teachers and we
are what we believe. But
you're not even a skeleton
of what you used to be. It's
over! I am not a saint, but
I am not my sins. I'm still
standing! It must be lonely
up that on the pedestal you
built on a shelf. Perhaps the
suspicion of fraud enhances
the flavor, but you just gave
up on yourself. It's only
the beginning. I am not a
saint, but I am not my sins.
I'm still standing! When I
see your face and see how
you've turned, it makes
me sick to think of all the
bridges you've burned. And
yeah, it hurts me to know
you have lost everything
that you loved. A ghost is
all that's left. You have lost
everything that you loved.
A ghost is all that's left.
You have lost everything
that you loved. A ghost is
all that's left. You have lost
everything.
