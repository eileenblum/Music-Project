This is my stomping
ground, these are the roads
I walk home. Out here,
where the streets unwind
keeping the city lights on.
Leaving's not the same as
being left behind. I found
my own path in life, passed
up the suit and tie. I found
a way of escaping the 9 to
5. But to judge you on your
own life, that's not for me
to say. I've seen this hap-
pen before but I won't let
it change me. Do whatever
works for you. There's no
substitute for staying true
to get you through the dark
timed. Trends and phases
come and go. Connect with
a world you barely know -
Lord knows it'll open your
eyes. This is my stomping
ground and one day I'll
settle down, but not for a
while. Out here, where the
streets unwind and lead
me to peace of mind, away
from the city lights. Leav-
ing's not the same as being
left behind, but we turn new
pages in our lives. Do what-
ever works for you. There's
no substitute for staying
true to get you through
the dark times. Trends and
phases come and go. Con-
nect with a world you barely
know - Lord knows it'll
open your eyes, your eyes.
City lights bring me home,
the streets upwind. I found
my own path to peace of
mind. It's not over yet, city
lights bring me home. The
streets unwind and leavings
not the same as being left
behind. These days these
days get tough, but don't
mistake love for spoon fed
lives, for spoon fed lives.
