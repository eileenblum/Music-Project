In a world full of hypocrites
that speak of tolerance
and love, it's hard to find
a single one that lives the
things they speak of. You
speak of love and respect,
but there is so much hate
in your words. As soon as
you disagree, the boundary
lines are all lost and blurred.
Turn in that crooked smile,
seething through gritted
teeth. You hide your true
intentions, but they're
crystal clear to me. Don't
we all know that crossing a
line In the sand will be what
unites us? History lies in
the palm of our hand. And
if death comes knocking,
you can tell him that I'm
still around. 'Cos I'm here
fighting til they break these
walls to the ground and tear
the flag down. Your words
have meant nothing, their
presence subliminal. You
monopolize acceptance
and your hatred is criminal.
Turn in that crooked smile
seething through gritted
teeth. You hide your true
intentions, but they're crys-
tal clear to me. Don't we all
know that crossing a line in
the sand will be what unites
us? History lies in the palm
of our hand. And if death
comes knocking, you can
tell him that I'm still around.
'Cos I'm here fighting til
they burn these walls to the
ground. And I'm here still
fighting, the guns and can-
nons will sound. If freedom
of choice is a God-given
right, then who are you to
take it away? You pompous
Pharisee, you have nothing
on me. This is my line in the
sand. Tell me, where do you
stand? Will you stand up for
what's right or back down
from the fight? Victory or
death! Victory or death! You
hide your true intentions but
they're clear to me. Don't
we all know that crossing
a line in the sand will be
what unites us? History lies
in the palm of our hand.
And if death comes knock-
ing, you can tell him that
I'm still around. 'Cos I'm
here fighting til they burn
these walls to the ground
and tear the flag down.
