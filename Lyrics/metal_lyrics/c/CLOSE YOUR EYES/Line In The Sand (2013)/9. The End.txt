[feat. Zoli Teglas Of Pennywise / Ignite]We are the voice of the end
We are the voice of the end

This is unity
And it won't be quite so easily taken from me
This ain't the change we need
We're not moving forward I've said,
I've said everything I can say
It seems you're just stuck in your way

This is the end
We're taking over with every word
We scream for the masses that you segregate
We scream, "Take it over, take it over!"

We are the voice of the youth battling
Those who choose to ignore what's happening
These kids are giving up hope each and every day

Their faith is resting on a bed of nails
This generation is riding off the rails
So what you waiting for?
Be the difference be more
Be the difference be more

Divide and conquer

No matter what
Pitting me against you made the cut
I don't need to talk about
How you're beating down
That our hearts are ri..ing out for your news next
Together our time has come
Skin color now we are one
We've had enough
Getting louder as we

Scream for the masses that you segregate
We scream, "Take it over, take it over!"

We are the voice of the youth battling
Those who choose to ignore what's happening
These kids are giving up hope each and every day

Their faith is resting on a bed of nails
This generation is riding off the rails
So what you waiting for?
Be the difference be more
Be the difference be more

[2x]
We are the voice of the end
We're here to rectify
All these faithless lies
That you told us
We're taking back our home

We are the voice of the end [4x]

[2x]
We are the voice of the end
We're here to rectify
All these faithless lies

We are the voice of the youth battling
Those who choose to ignore what's happening
These kids are giving up hope each and every day

Their faith is resting on a bed of nails
This generation is riding off the rails
So what you waiting for?
Be the difference be more
Be the difference be more
Be the difference be more
