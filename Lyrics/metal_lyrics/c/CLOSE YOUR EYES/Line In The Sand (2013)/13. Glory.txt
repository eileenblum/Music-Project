Hallelujah, glory to man.
How great and holy are
we. Hallelujah humanity,
who harnessed the sky and
harvest the sea. 'O how!
We hold our idols high and
raise our royal banners to
the sky. Our empires rise
and rule over mortal man.
The sun never sets on the
kingdoms land. Well I've
been thinking about our
time here. Hallelujah, glory
to man, how great and holy
are we. Hallelujah humanity
who harnessed the sky and
harvest the sea. They run
as the arrows blot the sun,
another feeble war on earth
is won. A mighty king meets
a bloody end, another fool-
ish empire rises again. Well
I've been thinking our time
here, hallelujah, glory to
man. How great and holy
are we. Hallelujah humanity,
who harnessed the sky and
harvest the sea. The chords
of death ring for every man,
no power or wealth can stay
it's hand. No tower built will
pierce the sky or idol forged
be made divine. Lift up a
living nation and grant a
single sword to thee. From
sleep and from damnation,
aflame with faith and free.
Look upon this kingdom
of men, how weak and
fickle are we. Look upon
this kingdom of men who
poison the sky and defile
the sea. Hallelujah, glory to
God, how great and holy
is He. Hallelujah, 'o Son Of
Man, who created the sky
and gave life to the sea.
