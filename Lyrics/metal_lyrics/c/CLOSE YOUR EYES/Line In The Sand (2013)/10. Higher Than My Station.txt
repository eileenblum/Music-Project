It might as well be down
to human condition. Your
hatred leaves no room for
distinction. These kids are
raised with misplaced rage.
It's no wonder they can't
tolerate, because you put
your fear in the minds of
the ones you hold dear.
I'm called to love, but my
heart gives in to hesitation.
Does this go higher than
my station? If I'm called
to love, why do I give in to
hesitation? Does this go
higher than my station?
Racial tension riles up the
masses. Frustrated friends
become overnight fascists.
Wake up! Can't you see this
is dividing you and me?
Why don't you turn on your
brain before you switch
on your TV? I'm called to
love, but my heart gives
in to hesitation. Does this
go higher than my station?
If I'm called to love, why
do I give in to hesitation?
Does this go higher than my
station? The kids are raised
with misplaced rage. Can
you not see, this is dividing
you from me? I'm called
to love, but my heart gives
in to hesitation. Does this
go higher than my station?
If I'm called to love, why
do I give in to hesitation?
Does this go higher than my
station? Does this go higher
than my station? Does this
go higher than my station?
Does this go higher than my
station? Does this go higher
than my station?
