The beauty of a living thing
is not the atoms that go
into it, but the mystery that
they were put together.
Teach him to hate. To hate
not for himself but for the
ones he sees around. For
the women and children,
the helpless, the broken,
and his country burning
down. The seas are rough,
his tension's high, so start
the storm and watch him
die. And let it ride, let it
ride til it all falls down and
there's nothing left. I know
my way back home resides
in you alone. And distant
lights make it clearer. I'm
searching for the morning
star. Teach him to fear. A
fear of the unknown, a fear
of going there alone until he
thinks he can't take it. He'll
bend and he'll break and
as a coward he will roam,
'cos I don't wanna fight but
sometimes I do. I'm practi-
cally dragging the elephant
into the room. Is this more
than you were prepared to
commit to? The seas are
rough, his tension's high, so
start the storm and watch
him die. And let it ride, let it
ride til it all falls down and
there's nothing left. I know
my way back home resides
in you alone. And distant
lights make it clearer. I'm
searching for the morning
star. The beauty of a living
thing is not the atoms that
go into it, but the mystery
that they were put together.
The battle's starting, the
fight begins; with bravery,
now he's running in. He
doesn't fight to kill, just
to defend. I know my way
back home resides in you
alone. And distant lights
make it clearer. I'm search-
ing for the morning star.
The war is over, the fighting
ends, his bravery did not
bend. I don't wanna fight,
but sometimes I do. I don't
wanna fight. Singing one
last hymn. Let's start again,
let's start again. Let's start
again, let's start again. Let's
start again, let's start again.
Let's start again, let's start
again.
