Where is the sun?
my darkest days have come.
The light is dimming, the warmth is receding
why do I only push it away?

I cant't escape this setting sun
I'm so afraid of the dark
With weary hands I try and bring it in
I pull and pull. Why does it feel so far away?

I knew this day would come but I never prepared for this
Still I struggle; still I struggle within myself
These questions try to break me in
Who am I? What have I become?
I'm just a broken mess of things left undone..
Still I feel the darkness closing in...

Now I know I can't let this go.
My depravity has taken hold of all I am.
I am losing all that I wanted
I trusted the one thing that should not be trusted
my humanity lies in wait like wolves at the door.

Give me your strength,
I need the embrace with the darkness closing in.
I long to feel the sun and it's rays on my face.
Now lift me up so far away from this place

I can't find my way out of this; where is the sun?
