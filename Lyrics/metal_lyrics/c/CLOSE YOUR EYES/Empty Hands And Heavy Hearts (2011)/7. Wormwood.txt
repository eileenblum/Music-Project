I never thought that I would see these days
There's no more sunlight and it's always raining on me
The struggles I face try to strip me of everything
I am barely standing, still there is no peace
You promised me that I wasn't alone
But everywhere I turn it seems like I stand on my own
It seems so pointless; is this existence meaningless?
Is there any hope left for me?

I am completely broken
I am your forgotten son.
You left me with nothing
My hands are so tired and so worn
I was always hoping that I could find some peace
But what I always find is that nothing's changing
God, nothing is changing

I am bearing witness to my multitude of sins
These days and nights seem like they will never end
There is no rest or hope in sight
There is nowhere that I can hide
The emptiness that haunts my days is there when I close my eyes

My depravity has taken hold of all I am
It has consumed me to the point I cannot stand
it brings me to my knees
Still I find nothing is changing
God nothing is changing

I am asking myself if there is a point to all this searching?
I feel like there is something I've been missing

I am bearing witness to my multitude of sins; is there and hope left for me?
