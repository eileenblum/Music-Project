Take a look around and tell me what it is you see?
Corruption and intolerance in a world that's fueled by greed
Hatred and selfishness drive neighbors to war
when was the last time we asked what it is we're fighting for?

How long have we been living without purpose?
While judgement is held over my head
Blindly we accept this without question
and slowly wait for our days to end.

Who will stand up and make a difference?
We only have ourselves to blame (the future is in our hands)
Surely this is not what we're made for.
When will we realize the world is ours to change?

Each and every day it's still the same
and I can't just look away.
We're standing on the brink.
and I for one will not stand by and watch as our hope slips away

Who will stand up and make a difference?
We only have ourselves to blame (the future is in our hands)
Surely this is not what we're made for.
When will we realize the world is ours to change?

You see all this corruption and senseless unjustice.
No matter where your eyes turn, you cannot ignore the truth.
And so I'm asking you to stand with me.

When will we stand and say enough is enough?
Open your eyes and take a stand instead of giving up.
When will we stand and say enough is enough?
Open your eyes and take a stand instead of giving up.

Who will stand up and make a difference? (The future is in our hands)
We only have ourselves to blame (The world is ours to change)
Who will stand up and make a difference? (The future is in our hands)
We only have ourselves to blame 

The world is ours to change
