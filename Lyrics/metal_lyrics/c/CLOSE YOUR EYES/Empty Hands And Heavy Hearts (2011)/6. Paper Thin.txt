Take these words and sing them for me
They fill up all these pages I have been writing in
But lately they are becoming
So paper thin So paper thin

These pages turn; They're full of empty words
I tear them out just to start it again
and still I lie awake at night
Unsure of what is to come
I am coming undone

give me the melody that my heart longs to sing
Now I am starting to see
That this fire you stir inside
Is greater than I know

All this time
I tried to sing a song
that my ears had never heard
with words I could not speak.

You are the one
That gives me words
That shine a light into darkness
and gives strength to the hopeless
My words mean nothing
unless they come from You
Who sang the stars into place
and whispered life into my soul.
