Iâve had enough of all these empty words!
This is not me giving up; this is me letting go
When hope is gone thereâs nowhere left to run
Iâm not running anymore; this is where I stand my ground!

For far too long complacency has been my only friend
And left me with sleepless nights that never seem to end
My God when did I become so heartless?
This canât be what Iâve been living for!

I swore this fire would never burn out
These days I see it lingering
Where are the hands that I have come to trust?

This means to much to me to let slip through my hands
And even when my strength fails me I will still stand
I will not be pushed aside
Hopelessness and emptiness have no place in me
This may be the death of me, so be it

For so long I wish that this cup could be passed from me
But now I am starting to see this has been what set me free
And even though I may not understand why I walk down this bitter path, full of my regret
I can trust that I am never alone
