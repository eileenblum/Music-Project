I lift my hands to the sky; Youâre my desire
My hopes and dreams they are of You
I lift my hands to the sky; for Your consuming fire
So bright it burns, whatâs left is Yours

Letâs go!

So many idle words have fallen from my lips
They pour just like the blood that fell from Your side
You gave up everything just to give me a second chance
I wonât take that for granted anymore

I found the plans that I have made were in vain, wonât make things better
I finally found my way, and I know that
All I needed was to find the truth and I found You
I will never look back

Iâm letting go of my regret
Iâm tearing down these walls I put up so long ago
You gave up everything just to give me a second chance
I wonât take that for granted anymore

With my eyes fixed on You I know I cannot be moved

And I must confess, I am nothing without you. 
I am on my knees screaming take me home
