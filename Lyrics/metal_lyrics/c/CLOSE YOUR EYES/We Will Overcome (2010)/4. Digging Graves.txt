Senseless injustice! Tread on heads like dust of the earth
Cut off the hands of the ones that are reaching out
Are we so calloused that these cries are going unheard?
This blood covers me just as much as you

They say this world is what I make of it
Am I the only one that wants a change?
Iâve turned my back on all my brothers dying in their broken homes
I dug the graves of the ones I am called to love

We are forsaken! Empty shells still fill our seats
How quick we choose to forget the desolation in the streets
I canât believe this; that we still wonât see the truth
I wonât quietly sit and choose not to be moved

Come stand with me; Iâll never walk alone
My words are not enough; I will love the unloved
Come stand with us; weâll never walk alone
Our words are not enough; weâll love the unloved
