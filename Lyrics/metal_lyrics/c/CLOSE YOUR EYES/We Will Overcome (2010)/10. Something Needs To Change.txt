Oh that these waves of uncertainty would drown me and take me to my grave
I am broken for this cause
Iâm tired of screaming words of hope and grace
Iâm unmoved, unstirred, unwavering
Break these chains and set this captive free

Does anyone have the heart to stand with me?
I could never do this on my own
I stand by and watch my family slowly fall apart
If faith can cause the blind to see why canât it pick up my brothers and sisters 
Who have fallen down to the ground?
If there is no love then hope can never be found

Is this worth fighting for?
I am on my knees; I accept defeat
Is there hope for us?

How much love will we know to show if we have no love for ourselves?
It makes me sick to think that you and I live this way
How much love will we know to show if we have no love for ourselves?
It makes me sick to think that you and I live in apathy

I know itâs worth fighting for
I am on my knees, I canât accept defeat
There is hope for us!
Even in our darkest days and when it seems that weâve lost our way and it seems
There is hope, there is hope!
There is a reason why we lift out hands and sing

Itâs wrong to say our hearts wonât change as long as You are here
Itâs wrong to say our hearts wonât change as long as You are

Who will be the hands and feet?
Who will go share this love with me?
Who will be the hands and feet of Jesus?
