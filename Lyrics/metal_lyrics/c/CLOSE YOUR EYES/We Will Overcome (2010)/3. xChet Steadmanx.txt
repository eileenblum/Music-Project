Just wake up!
Stop living like there is no hope
We know what youâre going through weâve been there before
I never thought that I would see you like this
All alone covering up yourself

You think that there is no one left who can get you out of your mess
But I will be right here until the bitter end

Step back! 
Take a look around
You are the only one that can change where youâre at
Just make the best of every moment
Or you will get left behind

You think that there is no one left who can get you out of your mess
But I will be right here until the bitter end
