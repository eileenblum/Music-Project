Iâve been shackled underneath all these lies for the last time
And Iâm throwing them aside
Thereâs too much apathy that clouds my mind
Words cannot express the sadness Iâm feeling

If this is all we are Iâm walking out the door
I want no part of it
There has to be something more
Speaking hope without action canât be the end
I can say, âI love you,â itâs never enough

Arenât we the ones who walk the narrow road?
Arenât we the voices that come from before the throne?
And when we stand for revolutionâs sake the world will know, 
theyâll know your name.

Itâs never been enough
This is the end of all You have become; 
open our hearts and let Yourself in

I wonât stand for this!
This canât be the body You spoke of!
Because I have forgotten how to love
