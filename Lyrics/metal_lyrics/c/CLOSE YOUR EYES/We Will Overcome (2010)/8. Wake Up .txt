It seems like these minutes are getting longer
Waiting for these lights to go down
So clench your fist and hold your head up high
We are not alone in this crowd

I pray that this wonât be the last time that our stories share the stage
This is the reason we have come, and why weâll never leave the same
Itâs your face that we want to see; youâre the notes in this melody
In this song of life that you sing with me

There were so many nights that I sang these words out into the open air
I never knew that you would be the one who sang back into my ears
Wake up wake up now! I never thought that I would see this day come to pass
Wake up wake up now! If this is who I am I know I canât be sleeping

It is not enough to be silent and never make a sound
So move your feet! Come on and be different; stand out

I need to hear your voice 
I canât sing this on my own
Weâre stronger when we stand as one

There were so many nights that we sang these words out into the open air
We never knew that You would be the one who sang back into our ears
Wake up wake up now! We never thought that we would see this day come to pass
Wake up wake up now! If this is who we are we know we canât be sleeping
