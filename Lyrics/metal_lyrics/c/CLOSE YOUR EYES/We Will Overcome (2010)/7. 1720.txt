Bring me back to the days when everything made sense to me
Together we could move the mountains and watch them fall into the sea
Times have changed now that I'm older; where did I go wrong?
Life was beautiful when we got along

But Iâm not giving up on this; weâve come too far
Just to throw all we have into the wind
So many times I have given up on You.  Will You take me back?
You can count on me

Iâll take this stand tonight; Iâll never leave Your side
You will have all of me

You have my word; I will never look away
So many times I have given up on You
You have never turned away.  I need You more than words can say!
One life one chance!
Donât take this for granted
We will move the mountains and watch them fall in the sea!

âHe said to them, "Because of your little faith. For truly, 
I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed,
you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,'
and it will move, and  nothing will be impossible for youâ Matthew 17:20
