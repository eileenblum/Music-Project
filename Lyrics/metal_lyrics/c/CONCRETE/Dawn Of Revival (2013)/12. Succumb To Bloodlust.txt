Butchered flesh, compelled to butcher bodies
Unsatiable, feast upon the gashes
Devour life, blood for the immortal
Prophecy, you will succumb to bloodlust

Witness scenes of carnage, streams of shedding blood
Evidence of horror in this crimson flood
Obliterating beauty with a butcher's knife
Body growing cold, somehow kept alive

Bleed

Urge controls my brain, bodies to destroy
Satisfy my lust, no one will escape
Bowing to my will, a journey for my soul
Fatal for your flesh I cannot control

Witness scenes of carnage, streams of shedding blood
Evidence of horror in this crimson flood
Obliterating beauty with a butcher's knife
Body growing cold, somehow kept alive

Bleed

Give into the lust, smear with others blood
Follow with the bliss, intoxicated state
Embracing the disgust, rites of the deranged
The body turning blue, obsessions dominate
