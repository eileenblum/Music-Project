The twitching shadows of the dark
Sustain the screams of the murdered
These calls are burning through the night
A strike of terror and disgust

Murderer awakes 
Back from the grave
To rend the living flesh
An ancient curse's slave
Voracious taste for gore
A vicious carnivore

Her eyes remain opened forever
Caught the smallest details of terror
Bone chilling vacancy
Another body, homicide

Countless butchered victims
Slaughtered with an axe
Ropes around the necks
Of those who were strangled
Bruises turning blue
Disfigured remains

Incite the homicidal
Caustic bites rip your skin
Incite the homicidal
Marked and random victims on the floor
