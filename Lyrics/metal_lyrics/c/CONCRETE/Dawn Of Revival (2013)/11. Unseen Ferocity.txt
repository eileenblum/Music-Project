Endure a transformation to a wolf-like creature
My human form lies dormant, deep within my body
This savage nature haunts me, howling in the dark
Searching for my prey beneath the full moon sky

Genetic bonds mutated, food chain reassembled
Tracking human scent, a target for my rage
Suffering my bites, soon to be reborn
Screaming in the night, violent attacks

Inflicting mortal wounds, impossible to heal
Frenzied human form, marking of the savage
Drawing victim blood, rejuvenating youth
Keeps my soul awake, impervious to injuries
Bitten and transformed, children of lycanthropy
Indulge a primal urge to feed and to attack
Human blood will spill, grant the immortality
Ridden with a curse - unseen ferocity

Endure a transformation to a wolf-like creature
My human form lies dormant, deep within my body
This savage nature haunts me, howling in the dark
Searching for my prey beneath the full moon sky

Victims of a beast, ripped from head to toe 
Rending flesh with claws, teeth are sinking in
Pulverising fury, snapping through the bones
Lycantrhopic blood flowing through my veins

Inflicting mortal wounds, impossible to heal
Frenzied human form, marking of the savage
Drawing victim blood, rejuvenating youth
Keeps my soul awake, impervious to injuries
Bitten and transformed, children of lycanthropy
Indulge a primal urge to feed and to attack
Human blood will spill, grant the immortality
Ridden with a curse - unseen ferocity

Strength that I have gained, superior than man
Stalking in the dark, waiting for my prey
Undergo mutation, eternal search for flesh
Immortal to my ways the hunt will never end.
