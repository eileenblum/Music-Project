The sour stench of rot Lingering from a tomb
Corpses come to life A feast for the exhumed
Pestilential enzymes Boil through the undead
Infecting mortal humans An army of the dead

Addiction to breathing flesh
Humans feed on humans
Grotesque devourment
Drinking from open sores

Stiff and moulded bodies Lacking warmth of blood
Blue and grey cadavers cryptic pigmentation
Carnivorous, barbaric flesh-devouring savage,
Blood sucking zombies Spreading their infection

Addiction to breathing flesh
Humans feed on humans
Grotesque devourment
Drinking from open sores
