Lost in the fields of dust
Stranded in the desert
Weak beneath the sun
Crawling in the torrid sand
Boundless plains of heat
With scarce vegetation
Environment of amber
Disoriented in this waste

Parched, you lie forgotten
Skin begins to shrivel
Excessive loss of fluids
Pending dehydration

Not a single shadow
Hides your sun-burnt body
Blisters on your flesh
Sand will irritate the wounds
Cracks on lips are bleeding
Thirst becoming stronger
Craving only water
Cease this dreadful suffering

Gaze at the horizon
Last hallucination
Body lying static
In the barren waste
