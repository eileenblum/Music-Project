The mortal flesh peels away
Humans fry in their own decay
Billions rot, obliteration
Scenes of death, annihilation

Bodies set on fire
Under the cold skies
Bones are burning to a crisp
Downfall of mankind

Your body hangs from a tree
Dangling dead on a rope
Broken neck, an empty gaze
Skin is pale, a constant phase

Corpses flood the land
Vultures carry dead meat
Mangled human beings
In the scorching heat
