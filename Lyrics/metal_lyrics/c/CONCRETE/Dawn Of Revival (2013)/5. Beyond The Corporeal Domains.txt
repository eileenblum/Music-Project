Injected with an agent of unstable nature
Liquid serum flowing through eroding arteries
Slow reanimation of corporeal substance
Gaining control over reviving tissue

Thoroughly I prepare to observe the specimen
Decaying flesh I will probe till I reach to the brain

Book of the dead and necronomic scripts
Exploring ways to command the souls of the deceased
Reaching beyond the corporeal domains
Victims of multiple murder soon will rise

Quivering, reanimating, shattered bones and cartilage
Rejuvenating, chemicals, in her neck I inject

Eluding laws of nature, the dead are now awake
Serum overflowing from their eyeless skulls
Revealing the untold secrets of anatomy
Barely looking human 

I'll hunt down the mortals, every single one
They'll become a product of my twisted mind
You'll be laid to rest just to live again
I will grant you life after you have died...

Injected with an agent of unstable nature
Liquid serum flowing through eroding arteries
Slow reanimation of corporeal substance
Gaining control over reviving tissue
