Between life and death your soul is trapped
Numb and cold, your life has snapped
Yet you perceive just like before
Insects devour, a shell with no core
No way to tell if it is day or night
Cast far away from any warmth and light
Surrounded by dark in the coldest place
Decay sets upon your mangled face

Obnoxious premonitions
Body is overwhelmed
After-death sensations
Breathless, half decayed
This horror cant be real
As bones are exposing
Bruises that wont heal
Your torso is decomposing

Screams go loud in your head
But lips wont move, considered dead
Imprisoned in flesh
Claustrophobic surges
Unable to make a word
Your screams remain unheard

Between life and death your soul is trapped
Numb and cold, your life has snapped
Yet you perceive just like before
Insects devour, a shell with no a core
No way to tell if it is day or night
Cast far away from any warmth and light
Surrounded by dark in the coldest place
Decay sets upon your mangled face

Obnoxious premonitions
Body is overwhelmed
After-death sensations
Breathless, half decayed
This horror cant be real
As bones are exposing
Bruises that wont heal
Your torso is decomposing

To escape this trap
Grown weaker fighting 
Covered with a moulded wrap
Uncontrolled gasping
Chills run down your spine
Pores are sweating cold
Memories realign
Awaiting a rebirth
