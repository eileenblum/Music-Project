Putrid zombies drawing nearer
Starving corpses rise to feast
Rotten beings hunt the living
Gathered by the scent of life

Bones collapsing, muscles ripping
Eyes are torn right from my skull
Blood is gorged on till repleting
Ripped to shreds but still alive

Devour my flesh
My figure is torn apart
Devour my flesh
My body is chewed to bits
Devour my flesh
My torment won't end
Devour my flesh
To reproduce

Devour my flesh
My figure is torn apart
Devour my flesh
My body is chewed to bits
Devour my flesh
My torment won't end
Devour my flesh
To reproduce

Bones collapsing, muscles ripping
Eyes are torn right from my skull
Blood is gorged on till repleting
Ripped to shreds but still alive

Putrid zombies drawing nearer
Starving corpses need to feed
Rotten beings hunt the living
Gathered by the scent of life
