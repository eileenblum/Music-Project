A pit of many deaths 
Crudely dug up in the ground
A place of shattered glass
Where the victims lie

Thrown in the debris 
Formless gashes, draining blood
Nerves are quivering
Entombed in broken glass

Lacerated skin
Shredded to the bone 
Thousand jagged segments 
Rip your tender flesh 

Cut and slash - a pool of glass
Suffering, excessive loss of blood

Tied and gagged her mouth
She wont scream or move
Another body buried
Where the others lie

Buried in shards
Buried in shards
Buried in shards
Bury them in shards
