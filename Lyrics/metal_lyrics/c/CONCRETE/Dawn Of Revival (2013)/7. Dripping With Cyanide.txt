Body stiff and cold bathing in its death
Submerged in toxic matter drenched in cyanide
Cells deoxidising skin is turning blue
Floating motionless an agonising end

Quivering you start to choke violently
Withering with no escape your fate is met
Poisoned blood intoxicating rapidly
Sinking in oblivion, suffering

Colourless solution engulfs your body fast
Impossible to breathe, struggling for breath
Limbs are going numb and you cannot escape
Immersed in cyanide drifting to your death

Liquefied poison biting in your pores
Feel the lethal fluid burning through the skin
Drowning in this pool the surface seems so high 
Venomous substance covering your face

Body stiff and cold bathing in its death
Submerged in toxic matter drenched in cyanide
Cells deoxidising skin is turning blue
Floating motionless an agonising end

Quivering you start to choke violently
Withering with no escape your fate is met
Poisoned blood intoxicating rapidly
Sinking in oblivion, suffering

Colourless solution engulfs your body fast
Impossible to breathe, struggling for breath
Limbs are going numb and you cannot escape
Immersed in cyanide drifting to your death
