A wretched pile of humans
Rotting in a shed
Rats feed on dead skin
Bodily demise
Stare into a pale face
And trip on a limb
This hunger that doesn't 
Come to an end

Feeling the delight
From the kill at first sight
I need to feed tonight
I can taste their fright
She'll end like the others
Body left unburied
Processing free
A relentless killing spree

Experimentation
Is the purpose of existence
Of the sick mind
I cannot leave behind
A stiff corpse 
Hangs from the ceiling
Tissue, dead, revive
Bring it back to life

Breathless bodies stacked
Together into grotesque
Monuments to mark
Horrors I have left behind
