Wide awake again, staring in the dark
Breathing in the mists of ethereal
I see myself asleep, I'm standing by my side
A spectral ambiance now embraces me

I can see and hear but no one seems to know
What if I am sealed behind this unseen wall
Crying out at faces that never answer back
I am like the breeze that chills them in the night

Now I recognise senses that were lost
Distant and unknown as I tap into my soul
I see myself asleep, I'm standing by my side
A spectral ambiance now embraces me

A state of dormancy although I feel alive
As my frozen eyes reflect my memories
Mortality describes the burden of my doom
Eternally I seek the key for a return

Walking the boundless halls of infinity
Another sleepless stroll through eternity
Insomnia is upon me; a fathomless grip
In silence I await the dawn of rebirth
