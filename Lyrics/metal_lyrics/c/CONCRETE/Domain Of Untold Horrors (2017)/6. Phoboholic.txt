Etched within your mind, I've been there since birth
My strings control your fate yet you know me not
Altered scrolls of life as we breed demise
My bidding is complete with the horror in your eyes

Shallow winds of misery slam against your door
Spirits chant your name at it, waken by my call
We command a thousand souls, perpetual ecstasy
You're my living effigy, my lifeline to this world

Call to me I'm always there
Phoboholic needs despair

You know you need me in your life
You're dependent on my taste
Essence greedily consumed
Blissful joy of being scared

Call to me I'm always there
Phoboholic needs despair
