Sharpened senses intensify, aimed at the unknown
Spiritual intelligence unveils immortal scenes
Dimensions of obscurity wake before my eyes
Walking in a ghostly pace I wear the moon's disguise

Unlock my perceptions, immerse into a trance
Free the weight of psyche and let my mind advance

I foresee the past in a dream-like state
I relive the future, it was worth the wait
Hanging in between and at the edge of time
Nostredame, Nosferatus

Unlock my perceptions, immerse into a trance
Free the weight of psyche and let my mind advance

When the night is still and the moon shines red
Listen to them calling, talking with the dead
Aeons burn in minutes in this bleak domain
Sixth sense catatonia, exploring the arcane
