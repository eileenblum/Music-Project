Endless plains of snow is everything I see
Trying to save myself
From this bleak and cold terrain
I cannot recall for
How long I've been here but
Desperately I crave for
Something to get me warm with

Skin and tissue covered with cracks
From the brutal arctic cold

When I start to rub my
Hands and try to get warm
The ferocious cold bonds them into a whole
As I try to part them
Lacerations form and streams of gushing blood freeze
To a crimson rime

Introduced to a crypt of winter
As the frost bites nip my flesh

I'm immobilized by the grip of the cold
Thin air is hard to breathe in this sub-arctic state
Fluids in my body almost frozen over
The lids of my eyes slowly cake with snow

Cold-burnt remains of my being
Ice-bound carcass, crystallized
