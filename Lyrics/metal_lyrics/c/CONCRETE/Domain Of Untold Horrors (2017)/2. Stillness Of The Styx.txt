Pulled down to the darkest bottoms
Sinking - to the coldest depths
Gasping for my final breath
I'm struggling in this liquid hell

Stillness of the Styx
Putrid water fills my lungs
Stillness of the Styx
Silent tides engulf my soul

Drowning in these corrosive waters
Swirling - endlessly beneath
Smashed against the reefs and debris
For my body is seized with cramps

Loosing strength; I can barely see the
Peaceful surface of the quiet Styx
Overwhelmed by tons of water
Crushed, I'm sinking further down

Stillness of the Styx
Putrid water fills my lungs
Stillness of the Styx
Silent tides engulf my soul

Slowly drifting, now the struggle is over
Face down I am set afloat
Motionless, I'll join the others
Bound forever to the Styx
