Keys to deeper wisdom grow behind enclosures
Nurtured in the wombs of mature consistence
Existential answers bloom and wait for ripeness
Few are those to reap them, less are those to know them

The beginning and the end share the same origins
Plant the seeds of providence as they're breeding the unborn

Turn your eyes and look inside you
See what really lies within
Building flesh upon a frame
Unregistered by perception

The beginning and the end share the same origins
Reap the seeds of providence as they're breeding the unborn
