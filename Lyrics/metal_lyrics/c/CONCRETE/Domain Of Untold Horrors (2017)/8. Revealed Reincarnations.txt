Recollections of thoughts unknown to my mind
Mirror my unfound existence
Peer beyond the veil, I'll venture in the deep
I'm where human souls never go to sleep

Terminated worth reveals a barren path
Carry my visage through time and space
See my future self, foretell my coming form
Laws of mortal life bound me no more

Enchanted citations attend my creation
Gathering the fragments of my future existence

Stripped of my corporal burden
I now behold memories that aren't mine
I'm bleeding back into myself
Emptiness devours me
I can see through flesh and bone
Elder gates of sanity slamming shut after me

Terminated worth reveals a vacant path
Carry my visage through time and space
See my future self, foretell my coming form
Laws of mortal life bound me no more

Embedded in carnivorous wombs
Reaching for a distant light
Effigies of the unknown
Reveal reincarnations
