Spreading lies every breath
Carefully designed to manipulate
It's nature, of higher intellect
Marching to the dance of death

Darker and darker
Your existence plagues this world
Furtive domination
Fed with a strain, now your mind is scarred

Blackborn

Suffering, nested in human form
Superimposing its morals
Steadily going, inflicting its pain
Loaded with viral hate

Soul and flesh mean nothing
For it's based on greed and fear
Orderly consume the light
Churn the stars and burn the skies

Darker and darker
Your existence plagues this world
Furtive domination
Fed with a strain, now your mind is scarred

Blackborn
