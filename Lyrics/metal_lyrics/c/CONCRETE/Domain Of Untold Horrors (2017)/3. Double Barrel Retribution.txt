Vindictive, butchery
Time to pay and revenge will be cold and vile
Rabid hate, furious
Loaded shotgun to your head, the trigger has your fate

Double barrel retribution

An instant flash of light upon the gun's discharge
Your face was blown apart then everything went black
The shotgun did its part to rob you of your life
Your skull was pulverized, brain pattern blast

Headshot, detonate
Everything ended fast, the damage is not enough
Killing spree is at hand
As I fire one more shell into your fucking chest

Double barrel retribution

My hatred burning stronger, unrivalled lunacy
A spray of shotshell pellets, bite deep into your flesh
This tool of retribution is like a chanting voice
To purge me from this torment, I remain insane

Double barrel retribution
