The blow of caustic breeze
Carries rancid stench
Bathe in the reddish light 
Of a Non-existent sun 

Upon the altars - sacrifice
Numb with horror, paralyzed

Daggers run through flesh
Shaping ancient runes
Countless restless souls
Circling in the air

Upon the altars - sacrifice
Numb with horror, paralyzed

Voices
Voices calling out
Inhumed
Buried while alive

Layed upon these ancient stones
In between the halls of time
Read from ageless manuscripts
As your soul is drained from you

Greet the end with open arms;
Once youve died you will live again
Altars made of human bone
Hungry for a sacrifice
