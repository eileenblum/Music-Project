A trail of butchered victims
Will revive the legend
The horrible creations
Of an evil mind

Serial disfigurement
Systematic decimation
Smash the ribcage open
More are meant to suffer

Try to pull away
And slowly stop the struggle
As my teeth sink deeper
In your pulsing neck

Rend the flesh to shreds
to expose the arteries
Tapping on the clotted scabs
as the blood coagulates

I'm the eldest one
I've been resurrected
To devour flesh
And spew forth infection

A trail of butchered victims
Has revived the legend
The horrible creations
Of an evil mind
