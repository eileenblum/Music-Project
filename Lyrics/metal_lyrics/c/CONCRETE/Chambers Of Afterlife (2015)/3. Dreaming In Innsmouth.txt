The tide engulfs my soul and sets my thoughts away
Drifting in the blue sailing in decay
Entering a world built on cosmic loss
Ancient-time aroma chills me to my bones

This must be a dream I know it cant be real
The plot that I behold unmeant for mortal eyes
I am shown the secrets of an ancient kind
Lost and long forgotten banished out of time

Creatures from the deep appearing in my sleep
Altering my dream, overall control
Liquid realms of death - messages unfold
Chanting of the drowned burning through my soul

Sinking in my dreams of innsmouth

Locked inside my mind I see the ages pass
At one with myself, trapped behind the glass
I cannot forget the horrors I have seen
Perpetually alive I remain within

Drowning in my dreams of innsmouth
