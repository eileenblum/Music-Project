Environmental temperature frozen cold by nitrogen
Critical necessity keeps the skin preserved and fresh 
I embrace the only way to evade advanced decay
My macabre experiments will survive another day

I control the past, the future and present are mine
I possess the skills of death and of rebirth
Everything thats known as mortal to your world
Will bestow to me when its path completes

Saturate the ancient flesh
as my serum seeps inside
Netherworld intelligence, 
guided by obscurity

Denial of mortality
I transcend its postulates
Peer into eternity
to escape deformity

I control the past, the future and present are mine
I possess the skills of death and of rebirth
Everything thats known as mortal to your world
Will bestow to me when its path completes

Dosage insufficient
Chemically unstable
Gulp down on the serum
To devour life
