Fresh adipocere forming on your corpse
Enzyme of the dead bonds with human cells
Chemical demise raging under skin
Cellular devourment on post-mortem level

Certain changes of the flesh start to take their place
When the body dies; only after death
Chemical reactions precede decomposition
As the toxins merge to begin secretion

Body dead, triggering molecules of instant zombiefication
Coming back from beyond, born again after death

Something lives in us even when we die
Somehow flesh awakes when there's nothing left
Silently it blooms - a spiritual enigma
When we reach the light sometimes we return

Body dead, triggering molecules of instant zombiefication
Coming back from beyond, born again after death

I celebrate rebirth, society of undead
Artificial life travels through the veins
Walk among the living, hidden from their eyes.
No one knows the truth, wolves among the sheep
