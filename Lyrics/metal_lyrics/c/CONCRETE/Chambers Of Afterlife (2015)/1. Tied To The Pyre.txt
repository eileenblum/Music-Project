Raging flames consuming; melting flesh from bone
Fire burning stronger, strapped to a pole in it's core
Screams of pain and torment rip the skies above me
Carbonised inferno tied to the pyre to die

Facial features boil blisters now secrete
Vital fluids spurt as the flesh ignites

Horribly disfigured flesh incineration
Body caught on fire sizzling in my own remains
Scorching bones to dust tissue dehydration
Flesh drips from my face mixing with the streams of blood

As the blazing fire turned my flesh to ashes
I could feel the throbbing of my 3rd degree burns
Glandular pulsation charred beyond recognition
I am now a fallen victim of immolation

I exist in flames I'll return to dust
Nothing will remain when the pyre's done

Horribly disfigured flesh incineration
Body caught on fire sizzling in my own remains
Scorching bones to dust tissue dehydration
Flesh drips from my face mixing with the streams of blood

Raging flames consuming; melting flesh from bone
Fire burning stronger, strapped to a pole in it's core
Screams of pain and torment rip the skies above me
Carbonised inferno tied to the pyre to die
