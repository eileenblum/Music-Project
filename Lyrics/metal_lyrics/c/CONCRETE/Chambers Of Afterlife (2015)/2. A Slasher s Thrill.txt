A slasher's thrill

Ominous detest for humans
Trophies made of dying flesh
A butcher's knife impedes their breathing
Stabbing frenzy caused their death

Come to me and leave in pieces
Ever growing gallery of death
Torn cadavers ripped to bits
By my blade stained with blood

Hatred driving my existence
Killing spree - I'm seeing red
Slash and carve the blood is running
Pulverising human flesh

Corpses lying in their blood
Laid to rest by my hand
I will join their timeless sleep 
Only to rise again
Again

Humans torn apart, missing arms and legs
Rearranging limbs, Sew them back together
Blood begins to clot, cranium exposed
Crushing through the bone with a single blow

Corpses lying in their blood
Laid to rest by my hand
I will join their timeless sleep 
Only to rise again
Again
