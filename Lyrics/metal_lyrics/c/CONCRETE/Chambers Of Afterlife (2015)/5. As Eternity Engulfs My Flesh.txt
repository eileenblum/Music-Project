How can we endure the false integrity
Of the brittle flesh that bleeds so easily?
An entity that dwells on human suffering
A portal to this world - inherit bodily

Appetite for blood is running through my veins
Immortality is entered after life
Shivers on my flesh as it flows through me
My curse and my craft to live eternally

Cryptic vampire I rise again
The warmth of life I slowly regain
Drinking the blood to nourish my soul
I feel the rush gaining control

Draining your life, trickling through me
I am at one with infinity
Souls I collect are bound to my will
Another one bleeding soothing my thrill

I'm the one that dwells deep within the dark
Soon your body will bear my acid mark
Putrefying flesh, drained of all the blood
Another one like me entering this world
