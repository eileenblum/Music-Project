Exit from this fragile life, about to face infinity
Staring at the living world, manifest mortality
Time to take the final step, standing on the edge
Voices beckon from beyond, afterlife awaits

Wounds do bleed they never stop, body is physically dead
Yet my soul is waiting dormant, sleeping but awake
Break the binding of the spirit and free it from my corpse
Enter spiritual dimension through infinity

Oblivion engulfs the flesh, vitality expires
Formulas will put the start of a new existence
Stepping in obscurity, my soul cant leave its vessel
Lit up by the cryptic lights - morbid decoration

Tearing at the walls, the walls of twisted flesh
Trapped inside a mortal shell and screaming for release
Moving on a timeless path to transcend beyond
Visions from the other side, suspended afterlife

Wounds do bleed they never stop, body is physically dead
Yet my soul is waiting dormant, sleeping but awake
Break the binding of the spirit and free it from my corpse
Enter spiritual dimension through infinity
