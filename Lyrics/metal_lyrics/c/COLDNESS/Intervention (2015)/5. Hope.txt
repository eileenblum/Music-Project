[Music: Gabriel Andrade, Lenine Matos / Lyrics: Lenine Matos, George Rolim]

Here comes the sun
Here comes the dawn
Somethings in universe
Create a god

Across the centuries
And don't perceive
We are all the same
We'll raise a strength
Here comes the sea
A Pure soul
Bringing peace
Before my eyes

Humanity
Doesn't realize
Such a system in borderline

We'll fall as slaves
We'll raise a strength

Instead of tolerating the victim change of life
We should look inside
How can I understand this foolish game
There will be no winners for those who want power

Cast by the skies
Into the unborn night
This life has more for us
to realize

Instead of tolerate the victim change of death
We didn't know
The great transition will destroy this circle
Creating order, restoring my peace
