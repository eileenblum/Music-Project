[Music: Gabriel Andrade / Lyrics: George Rolim]

Wide eyes, dived inside
I must compile whatâs different
Uncover the basis of my legacy
Define and play along

No claiming private, no keeping deep
Your lore of life that is still hidden in

The need to aid all the ones beside
Is building within human condition

I complete as a true untied mind
Reaching my site as a solid framed light
Just aiming for all that is here ready to turnaround
Felling enlighten

âIâm came here to find out, and I did,
Iâm done! I could..,I realizedâ¦
I canât just dismiss my trueself...
I need this closure!â

My climb is leading me as a guide
I begging now, just let me rise to find the surface line

âFinally complete! Felling fulfill...myself...indeed!â
