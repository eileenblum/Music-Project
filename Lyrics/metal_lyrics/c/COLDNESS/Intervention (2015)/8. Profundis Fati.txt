[Music: Gabriel Andrade, George Rolim / Lyrics: George Rolim]

Here I am
Once more now
Caught myself with my eyes on
Remembering a pass time

The innocence of an act
Seventy years have passed
Still trapped in regards like a movie scene
Around my destiny

Need your hand touch
Reaching my forgotten face
Words like a blow in the wind
Feeling from aâ¦

Lost state, refilling me
Maintain a stillness
Clear ground that lingers
This tied condition

I screamed in agony and realized!
I could never! You cannot control your mind!
Fell for those years, I mesmerized!
I could never! You cannot control your life!

Building up from your hands
A new thicker world
No longer our life
Should be trapped outside

Fill the spirit of the modern man
The anthem from the innerself
Haste! Being more, beat it all! seize what you want
And take what you need!
