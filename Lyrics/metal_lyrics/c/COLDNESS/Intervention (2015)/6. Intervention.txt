[Music: Gabriel Andrade / Lyrics: George Rolim]

We keep feeding the system that creates human profiles
Turning ourselves to puppets for a empty society
The once tough values, turning upside down
Digress and deceive leading the pace for...

From here arise the common sense that oversees us all
How and who defines all things as they are?
The slaves of money and technology shall fall
We need to sight a better reference

The foe of people are not the machines
The foe of people is not the universe
The human thinking drives all the actions around
The human thinking drives the hand that points aside

Intervention!
Humanity claims for help
Intervention!
A man cries quietly
Intervention!
Donât wanna free myself

...The hand that points aside

Intervention!
Is what we need for...
Intervention!
Thereâs no solution
Intervention!
Donât wanna free myself

âOur era is in the edge of collapse...
The Masses lives in chaos...
In cold blood we ignore our fears...
...Our dreams and realitiesâ
