[Music: Lenine Matos, Gabriel Andrade / Lyrics: Lenine Matos]

I understand what I feel in my mind
The world falls quickly on me
Between my hands I lose the done
Misunderstood, forgiveness

Common wisdom through the centuries
Failed in try to show
How men should live on Earth
Without love, Without hope

Desire, I feel her
Even without you understanding
Apathy, I feel her
Instincts rise up

Every day a new sun insists on birth
Bringing forth the responsibilities
Will I resist the pressure?
Find a reason to live

Insecurity, I feel her
How not to give it up?
Insanity, I turn away
I will endure this fight forever
