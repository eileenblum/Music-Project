[Music: Gabriel Andrade / Lyrics: George Rolim]

Is this what I really want?
Get this, what I exactly want
Treading life and death for a loan

Is this the reason I made the heal?
For this I didnât mind to kneel?

Strive up my son!

All live is build from the hope
You extracts from the scars
Is this the reason I made the heal?
For this I really didnât mind to kneel?

The distress frame by
The envy we deny that grows inside

Feel no pain, no beating inside
Casted a light by my mind
As my fellow dears are gone by
This white myst here helds on my site

I'm a victim of a circumstance
There's a reason wondered the "why"
The fear retained
We are not aloud to cry

Rebooting know the way
It should had been all this time
Just find the cause why
Itâs make a sense, I diving inside out
