[Music: Gabriel Andrade / Lyrics: Gabriel Andrade, George Rolim]

I am feeling tormented, I feelâ¦.
Something will happen
I'm in a haste,
Being trapped, can't break the air around

I only see unhuman forms
A blur, a shining screen that comes alive

At the moment I just realize
The sensation of mighty hands
I pike and tear it out from me

fraying the life for a new born man
As track back to myself

Realizing we still convicted
We are non constricted lives
Assuming that all around are mortify
What a cornered man...what I should do to...

Hear the whisper from the uprising ghosts
They are seeking for a guilted mind
The wicked one, destroyer of my judgment
Iâm living blinded into my torment
