[Music: Gabriel Andrade / Lyrics: George Rolim]

Falls uncertain
From a tall, unfinished fragile line
All my live I been searching for a way to connect
Become a great exalted one

You might think that success lies here right beside
You should has a sense your conscience as a guide
Maybe caught in a stream that passes by
Just realize the failure in your eyes

I can not take the despite disguised, the unnoticed
They should get me, adore my work
Where I'm heading? What the hell I'm doing wrong?

This need for an acceptance will
Drive you to despair and regret
Unchain yourself off this rain of false cheers
The true joy is build within your mind

Hunting for those kind eyes, real smiles, backing me!
Felling full diminished, unattended, broken down!
