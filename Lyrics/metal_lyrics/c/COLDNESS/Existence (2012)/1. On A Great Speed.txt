[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gabriel Andrade]

We got to rush in the morning
Time is a way around us
At night and weâre back
One day less, and I live

We did not realize what's around
The planet, climate, the ocean life

We could have a great speed
Live each day as if were only
Remember everything we do
Live for tomorrow

Time's speed is relentless
Our face changes day-by-day
We felt over the years
Because we are not eternal

We pretend to know everything
Living in function of routine

We could have a great speed
Live each day as if were only
Remember everything we do
Live for tomorrow
