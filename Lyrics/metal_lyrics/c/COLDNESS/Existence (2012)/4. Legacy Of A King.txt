[Music: Gabriel Andrade, Lyrics: Rafael Parente]

Born in the east of the Nile
Barely he knew about his destiny
He grew up with a father as Pharaoh

As young he fought
Side by side his powerful father
After the death he inherit
The throne of Egypt

His reign was full of battles
Battles drenched in bloodbath
A god warrior he was
On the battlefront of his army

The God Amon blessed him
And with Him at his side
He fought many battles and showed
The great worth for being a God on Earth

And an old desire of Ramses I
He decided to complete his reign  
And to Kadesh he marched
In opulence and sure win
Annihilated everyone with royal troops

His reign was full of battles
Battles drenched in bloodbath
A god warrior he was
On the battlefront of his army

The God Amon blessed him
And with Him at his side
He fought many battles and showed
The great worth for being a God on Earth

At this time the despair took control
Account the battlefield
Hititas, their enemies
Had the victory as right
Ramses without troops fell to the ground

I will fall on them as the
Claws of the hawk massacring them
And leaving them annihilated
Into the battlefied

And then Ramses won the battle,
The battle that he took the city,
And spreads his legacy
Across the ages
He rested his eternity

In the Valley of the Kings 
And he left for us all his glories
And a great threat

Meditate my works,
OH! Powerful and great
OH! Powerful...

King of the kings from the throne to the
Battlefied
In holy land of the kings he will rest in Peace
Waiting the moment to return and reign 
Again
He is the king of the kings

And he will rise again
He is the king of the kings
