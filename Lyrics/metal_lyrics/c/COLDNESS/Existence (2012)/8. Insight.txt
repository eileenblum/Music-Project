[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gabriel Andrade]


On the emptiness of this dream
I wanted just to fell
A whole life ahead
I just had to go...

Went sail on a sea of insanity
Searching for a meaning 
For our existence
On my madness thoughts

I saw, we can keep on going
We can touch the sky
And fly free in our dreams
Fell the smell of that air again

I always be here to live a new day
No more meaninglessness
Want just to be in my life

I saw, we can keep on going
We can touch the sky
And fly free in our dreams
Fell the smell of that air again

Dare my soul be clear
For all eternity
There no more lies
Among the gods
Holding the light
The endless way
