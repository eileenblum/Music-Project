[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gabriel Andrade]

Within the mistery of my dream
I open the door to the universe
The tear falls before the wilderness
On humanity sad eyes

Seeing everything we did
In freedom, won our "PRISON"
Trapped to time circle
Ahead that longgest path

I adjust with universe
The most blue sky there is
The most green sea there is
Aligned together with my being

Ashes throwed to the wind
Sailing on distant waters
On wind's blow, I go to the skies

My brigth soul in the nightfall
I hold the day in my hands
With the a colossal hope
Entire hazes flood humanity

How god justify his means?
I beg for his reasons

Cruelty applied to the innocents
Whole people destroyed
Conception of tears in thuths
