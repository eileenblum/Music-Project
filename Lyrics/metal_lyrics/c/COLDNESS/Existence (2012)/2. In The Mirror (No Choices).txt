[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gabriel Andrade]

Look in your eyes
Your life is marked by you
Maybe for the days or these years
Remaning in the world of lie

Here we are forced to live
We have days to go by
People born and die
We have days to go by
And weâre here living a destiny time

Doom or lifetime? Time or destiny?
Wake to the dream
Maybe we have an explanation
the illusion still in my mind

Here we are forced to live
We have days to go by
People born and die
We have days to go by
And weâre here living a destiny time

Live or death
Tears in your hearts
We have a single wish
Live forever free

Now face the life
Live your destiny
Dry all your tears
Let the love domain

Live or death
Tears in your hearts
We have a single wish
Live forever free
