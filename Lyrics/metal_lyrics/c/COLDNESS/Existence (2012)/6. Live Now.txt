[Music: Gabriel Andrade, Lyrics: Rafael Parente]

Sometimes I feel alone
Sometimes I feel afraid
Feelings without explanation
Maybe not crying in the wind
And have silence as a Response

Sometimes we foresee our future
Sometimes do not believe, 
Believe in the past
Feel the years go by fast
Yet I feel the inertia of the soul

Words can not explain certain things
And the songs raise the senses
No point in running, screaming, 
If not to fight
New chance, a different ending

Look at the sky, into stars and dreams
I try to believe in an ideal future
Dream the impossible and do 
Nothing to change it
Just wandering around at night 
Looking for my truth

We can try to reach the sky
Can touch the clouds
Forget the past, live now  

We will not cry again
Soul is strong now
So we can get to the top of the sky

We will not cry again
Soul is strong now
we have to move on and live now

We will not cry again
Soul is strong now
We have to move on and 
Live now
