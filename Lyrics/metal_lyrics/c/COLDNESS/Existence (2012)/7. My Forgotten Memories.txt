[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gabriel Andrade]

Every passing day makes my remember...
All we had was forgotten
Maybe left on my deep feeling

The pit of my fellings forgoten 
When the reality of my dreams
Unchain me from myself

Can ignite the dead flame?
The destiny of our lives will erase
Eternal sensations in my memories

The pit of my fellings forgoten 
When the reality of my dreams
Unchain me from myself

Now I can realize what time did
The winter of my soul will pass
Now I can fell the finity
I live my blind regards

I can realize
The winter of my soul will pass
