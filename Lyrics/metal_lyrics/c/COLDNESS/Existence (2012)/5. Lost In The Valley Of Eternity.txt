[Music: Gabriel Andrade, Lyrics: Rafael Parente]

Everyday we're looking for something
Explanations for life or for death
We don't accept to be 
The dust of the universe
We search a meaning
That surrround us

May the star in our deepest dreams
Thoughts lost in the valley of eternity
Made the arms in the universe
Should we live in an utopian dream?

Sometimes we have to deceive by eyes
We have to believe in your heart
try not to commit the same faults
face the life and always believe

Because the truth exists but I dream with it
The freedom belongs to us dream and believe
Because the truth exists We must dream of it
The freedom belongs to us

Lost in the valley of eternity
