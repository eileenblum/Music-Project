[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gabriel Andrade]

Releasing your anger to men
Releasing them in their greedy plains
Deliver to life
The end of universe

Elements spread in the air
Atmospheric dust in transparent spots
Chaotic systems of pollution
Throw to the winds our own destruction

The stellar nurseries
Lighting up the sky
Fragments of a new eraâ¦
Mother Nature

The sovereignty of men 
Will last for few times
Greed and corruption 
In the hands of few
The blast led to a new planet
In the most distant galaxies

Releasing your anger to men
Men!
Releasing them in their greedy plains
Life!
Deliver, to life
Death!
The clash of time
