(so far I don't know which way to go)
(feels like I need a miracle)

Feelings changing my surroundings left me wondering
And I think how it's kinda crazy you remember
The way you separate from the answers
Burning up in flames from a single ember
It's funny how a spark so small can inspire such great change

Let the fire burn on
Just don't get lost in all the flames, all the flames
You've got to see above and beyond
To take a step to a higher place
Where even you can change your fate

How could you expect to face 
A fear that's always faceless
How could you believe 
The ones that are to blame are really blameless
How could you shamelessly live your life so fucking shameless
It's time to speak up and start giving names to the nameless

Now what did you expect for me to say
With all these thoughts as you stray away from me?
Your bones unwinding at the seams
My dreams are the awakening
Wake up!
Open your eyes so you can see inside 
Try to recognize this fire inside
Everything you once knew dies tonight

With closed eyes (with closed eyes)
I'm feeling all the oxygen in my lungs burning

Let the fire burn on
Just don't get lost in all the flames, all the flames
You've got to see above and beyond
To take a step to a higher place
Where even you can change your fate

You think you're safe from life
When you know you are not
You know it's hard to breathe
When your lungs won't stop burning
Sometimes you just gotta take a chance and live

The way to survive is to light up the night
With the choice to not give in
We don't belong here, we won't be long here
(follow me if you even can)

We can't pretend we're the only ones who believe,
You have to find it inside your heart just to see,
And everything you've known, you've had to fight for it
You can't just burn the bridges
Just let your heart pressure you to stay

There must be something there
Something inside that makes you care
You'll feel the heat beware
But I promise with the fire in your heart
There's no need to be scared

I've got a fire in my heart.
