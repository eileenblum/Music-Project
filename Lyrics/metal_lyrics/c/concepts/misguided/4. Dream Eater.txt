Dream with your eyes open,
Dream withâ¦ dream withâ¦
Dream with your eyes open

Every little thing that you say to me
Is breaking me inside and I can't find the piece
Even though I've been picking up all the pieces 
(gotta put it together)
Walking around in the darkness
My love is gone, my dreams are haunted
By a ghost of what I really was

This tattered soul and 
Broken bones have been haunting me 
But I can't stand the sight of this man that I claim to be,
Why was I set free?
Fuck! what have I become, I'm not the enemy?
Walking around I lost a piece of myself
My true identity

I finally opened up to 
The sky that I've been staring at
Wondering what would've become of 
What we thought we had when we were young

I stand for myself, but I wasn't really ready 
To be rid of who I was
I stand for myself, I may not do everything right
But at least I know who I am

I gotta learn to fight my own fights
Gotta learn to grab the light to light my own life
(live it right)
Making decisions, making them tonight
What's the last thing that you would do 
Before you start your new life?

I don't know who I am anymore,
My mind is clouded, what have I become?
I pray to god for guidance on this journey
I've been given my sense of being punished and forgiven
Stay away from my path and 
Maybe I will come back to you 
When I have found myself

I've been searching for something
I lie awake; lie awake to find out where I've been
I won't let you remember me

My heart is torn, what can I say?
I stayed for myself and now
I'm ready to be rid of who I was
So let's make this our night
We only get one in our whole life
Don't let the world fall fast asleep
It's our chance, it's our chance

I'm lost in the words that I speak
Like whispers and lies I can't seem to
Keep hidden away from the world
And everyone that needs me to see them clearly
I'm better off waiting for long enough 
The gates around my mind have opened up
As I make my through
You will see something that you have never known

This is the rebirth of a new life
I'm only a dreamer, who sleeps with closed eyes.
