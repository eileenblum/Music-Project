Take another step into the pit
You're meeting death talking 
Game, set, match bitch 
Fingers on the casket
What?!

With the blade of woe the sensatiable 
Cuts down the traitor when he feels
The anger, blade sharp as razor
He'll remember all the sins
And the shit he's gotta pay for

Breathe out,
The disease inside eats away at the man you plan to be,
Not much has changed with the way you 
Play these games with those you love

I try to see things through your eyes 
So I can understand who you are and where I stand

For what it's worth
I want to know you better
You've got me feeling like
It wasn't worth the wait, I should've told you
For the sake of saving time

Crystalline eyes where the real truth hides
False figure for the blind with a bloody compromise
(deceit in that you speak)
(for all the people you meet)
With all the words that you have spoken 
Shot around like a broken lie
So sharp so dangerous
Lying to the world is just a game to us
I won't be fooled cause I've learned along the way

You gotta go in on your own
You gotta trust in what you know
You gotta somehow find somehow find some way to solo learn all the ropes
Will you decide what it is for me to stumble on
All that you hide
All of your senseless pride

I see blood in your eyes tonight

For what it's worth
I want to know you better
You've got me feeling like
It wasn't worth the wait, I should've told you
For the sake of saving time

Don't think you're dead when you're just hopeless
I see the pain in your eyes
And I know we've been addicted
My veins are raging 

We're not dead yet and we can be saved
But we're chased by the labels that we claim
Labeled deceiver

Deceiverâ¦ deceiverâ¦ deceiver!
The bones of those they betrayed
Have now paved the way

Brace yourself, I'm afraid we've been mislead, 
Misguided by idle hands,
Where are you now?
Cause I've finally figured out
That this road that you led me down
Goes to a place I knew I'd never get out
Aliveâ¦ aliveâ¦ I'm burning from the inside.
