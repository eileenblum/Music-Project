Are you okay?
Cause I need to know babe
Cause a lot of things changed
Why does this keep happening?
Are you okay? wait
I don't need to hear a damn thing
That's already been said before
I had your love once, I don't want it no more

With nowhere to run, and no way to hide
You'll fear what they see inside
Those who don't learn will burn out of spite
Rise up from the ashes of their lives

On and on, over and over again
But not this time, but not this time
I refuse to go through the motions

Every time I try to make it out alive
You just pull me in
Now I'm tired of all the lying and fighting,
Hoping and trying
I'm giving up to giving in

I live my life walking on the line
Feel like I'm running out of time
It's not like you seem to care
Stuck out in the middle of nowhere

With nowhere to run, and no way to hide
You'll fear what they see inside
Those who don't learn will burn out of spite
Rise up from the ashes of their lives

Locked away in our tortured minds
We come to find that we've become 
The ghost in the reflection
Am I alive or is this a lie?
So tell me, tell me, can you feel my heartbeat?

Do your worst
May your hypocritical lies
Fill with light and illuminate and burn
Lighting up the night for the sake of lessons
To be learned I'm pulling back now 
I want to know how you thought this would work out
Lives were affected, hearts infected
This my confession of our disconnection

I felt this way in life too many times in my mind 
I'm all out of love, I'm bottled up
Nobody's home, but I still keep the lights on
And I guess it's better to know just what you want to say
But all jokes aside just open up your eyes, come on
Just open up your eyes and see what's going on.

With nowhere to run, and no way to hide
You'll fear what they see inside
Those who don't learn will burn out of spite
Rise up from the ashes of their lives
