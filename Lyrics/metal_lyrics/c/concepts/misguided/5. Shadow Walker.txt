What's the point?
Are you even listening to my voice?
Or has it just faded away?
I wanna know, did you comprehend
Or was my breath wasted?
How could you be so hollow?

Don't waste my time 
With this petty shit that this world claims to see
You feed but you bite my hand
Despite the second chances, 
Burning away only feeds the flame
But I savored, only to suffer
You misconstrued all the flaws in miserable souls
And they call it murder
But I won't let it take the best of me

It follows me, eternally; I can't get it out of head

I'll take your breath, right out your chest
Oh I'm begging you, please give me a reason
I'm making mistakes I'd say,
Learning your lessons the hard way
(so give your best)
Your blood and sweat, oh I promise you 
You're alive for a reason
Please don't throw your life away
Only you can choose your destiny

Only you can choose the path that you see true
Is your desire worth what you have to lose?

Reach for light,
Cause you've gone and lost your sight
And yes I know I put the weight in your hands, 
And honestly, I won't take away
From the life that you have to lead
I'm just trying to make these changes and 
Right the wrongs that you feel inside 
(this sin we know)
With bridges burn 
There's no way to find your way to riches

I know you're all talk, and this is all wrong,
You live to die just to feel like you belong
I'm not wrong to assume that you're hopeless,
My heart's wasting away for the worthless

It follows me, eternally; I can't get it out of head

I'll take your breath, right out your chest
Oh I'm begging you, please give me a reason
I'm making mistakes I'd say,
Learning your lessons the hard way
(so give your best)
Your blood and sweat, oh I promise you 
You're alive for a reason
Please don't throw your life away
Only you can choose your destiny

So where will you run now?
(we see the truth in your eyes you know you can't disguise)
So where will you run now?
(you know you can't escape we all have our fate)
Because we see that the wolves are at the gates
Biting the legs of the ones who covet,
It was they who led me to your door.
