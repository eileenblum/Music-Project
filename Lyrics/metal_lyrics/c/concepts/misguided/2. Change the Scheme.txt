Yeah
The tyrant's words are ending lives
I'll take him by the throat
Cause I watched you abandon
Every fucking thing that you believe in
I'm not just a livid fool
But I'll shatter the idols that you breath for
This time I'll take what's mine
A breath for a breath, an eye for an eye
And we'll leave nothing left inside your mind
But a remnant of hope and your will to survive
Peel away the skin that you've been wearing
Wolf seen as a sheep led into slaughter

You're the reason that my blood runs cold
I'd give up everything just to have you know
What I'm feeling and thinking

You disappoint me with these lies that you wear so well
You're disguised, trying to hid, trying to be someone else
Don't forget it you'll soon regret it
You feel that you're running from 
Someone we who's trying to help

I swear it on my life, my body as my oath
I've been trying to find a way for you
To run away and make your way back home

I'll measure the wealth of 
The soles, of the soles of your shoes
Of the lives that you walk through
But by the time I'm through with you
You will face your judgment with no excuse

Purge. Purge.
Here comes the cleansing
Purge. Purge.
Take back your life

Open your eyes and let this shake you
Gotta learn to free your mind
Ignore all the glances from the wicked eyes
We've strayed so far from the grand design
And the end is coming soon we can see the signs

Lord know I'm a restless fool
Cause I only want what's best for you
I try to hide it in and let you know
Guess I never really learned to let it go
It's frozen in time, frozen still in my mind
So why do I keep wishing for this nearly shattered vision, oh
Push the limits of the world we live in
Take what it gives you then make it what you want 
All it takes is for you to believe it
Whether you're ready or not
Just tell me

You disappoint me with these lies that you wear so well
You're disguised, trying to hid, trying to be someone else
Don't forget it you'll soon regret it
You feel that you're running from 
Someone we who's trying to help

I swear it on my life, my body as my oath
I've been trying to find a way for you
To run away and make your way back home

When will you see this is not what you're meant to be?
When will you see you're fucking up your life?
You know your prize, now make your sacrifice
