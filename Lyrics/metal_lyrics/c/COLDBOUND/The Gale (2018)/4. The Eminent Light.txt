Through this endless void of time
As I dream this dream of mine
For the memories I've lost
Wide-awake I embrace
My solace and demise
Who shall witness my descent
Tears pour like endless rain

Once behold the void of time
For the dreams that hold you bound
Strained in elegance of life
Hearkened your fading mere soul
In this thick wall of dreams
Harrowing this shattered fears
Sullen heart in vain to try
To dwell away from this world

This cold world

This I've learnt from this time
Duality is all but lie
Vanishing my marred trails
Passing to the eminence of light

Hold my hand we'll dwell away
To starlit shores
Hold my hand we'll fly away
To starlit skies
Hold my hand we'll find a way
To dream again
Hold my hand we'll reach a way
Through the eminent light
