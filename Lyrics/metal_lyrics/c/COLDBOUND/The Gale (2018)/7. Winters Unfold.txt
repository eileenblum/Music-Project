From beyond as winters unfold
In this verge of mass damnation
Far beyond in the silent sea
Whilst blood has been spilled
On the name of (a) god

From beyond as memories revive
Beyond the darkest hours memories will fade
The time has come to break these chains away
Roam myself free from this burial instinct of death

Fly far beyond
Fly my son away
Away from this world
When illusions will conquer your mind
Then prevent yourself from the mass damnation

As winters unfold
Your will to live might strain you down
Take every day as your very last one

But remember in the end, we are leaving alone.
From the bottom of the earth
Screams of loneliness are calling your name
Become the one to fly away free
Before the autumn will be swiped by winters

Unchained
And cold
Darkness will embrace the misery of past
To become the one to fly away free
And break theses chains that hold your spirit down.
