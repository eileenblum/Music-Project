You will find meâ¨
Beneath the icy rocksâ¨
You will find meâ¨
Between the last glimpse of dayâ¨â¨
You will find meâ¨
While gasping for airâ¨
You will find meâ¨
As the clouds are swallowing the nightâ¨

There upon, in the shades of my dull perceptionâ¨
Evoking my ultimate right to live the joy of lifeâ¨
There upon, in the shades of this cold worldâ¨
As my time over here, runs backwards without the sense of the fearâ¨â¨
Without the joyâ¨
A bird denies to fly - awayâ¨
Without the sparklingâ¨
A heart becomes home for an empty hopeâ¨â¨
Without reasons givenâ¨
Easing the burden of timeâ¨
Without words been toldâ¨Just conclusion drawing a fine thin lineâ¨â¨

Ignorance my reflection â¨And reveal the shades of myself

â¨â¨Before the autumn comesâ¨
Abstract rain will cover the woundsâ¨
That the life has occurred on you â¨â¨Waiting is a virtueâ¨
This vigorous sense of timeâ¨
Always do remember âthatâ
â¨Living is an act of courageâ¨â¨

Living is a great act of courage

â¨Before the autumn comesâ¨
Abstract rain will cover your woundsâ¨
Always do rememberâ¨Living is an act of courage

You will find me â¨â¨Wandering through the shades of myself
