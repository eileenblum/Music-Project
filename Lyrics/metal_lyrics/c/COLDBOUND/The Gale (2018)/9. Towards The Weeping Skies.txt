Wanderer
Looking for a shelter
Carving for allegiance
But the time runs backwards
Broken promises
Shouting in a world so vile
To become again as one
From the ashes reborn

Wanderer
Your time here is over
Depart now for a journey unknown
By the night, you will find
The haven of the endless light
To enlighten again your path
To fade and erase your;

Shadows, now unfold
And reveal the spring of bliss (towards the weeping skies)
When the time, will reminds us all
To fade and erase our demise (from this world)

Shadows, feel my tears
Pouring down to the earth
As my time is coming closer to the end
Listen to this gasp of betrayal and sufferings untold
Where am I?
Why the skies do cry?
We dwell alone
Who am I?
As the dawn will collapse
We are bound

Where am I?
Why the blood does flows?
We are alone
Who am I?
As the dusk will rise
We are bound

Forevermore

We are bound
