[Lyrics taken from the poem of K. Karyotakis "Nostalgia"]

My solace will be seen - by scars upon my heart
My solace will be told - by letter of remorse
The bitter greet - a cold farewell
The olden sorrows - that ignite again

From the depth of good times - our love bitterly greets
How long has it been? That you caressed for one night
From the depth of hard times, our shadows are passing by
The old sorrows unfold and ignite again ...

You are not in love, you say don't remember
If your heart has filled; and you shed the tears (of mine)
That you couldn't shed; like you did at first time
You are not in love, neither you remember, even if you cry...

The eyes suspended, pale suns ahead
The light that thaws the frozen heart of mine
The dead loves, that begin to stir away
The olden sorrows that again ignite...

The solace of mine, the sorrows unfold and ignite...
The silent path I walked, towards my doom, towards my end.
The closing words of mine, the swan song, of our love
This bitter tear, will blossom on your eyelid, and will fall.
