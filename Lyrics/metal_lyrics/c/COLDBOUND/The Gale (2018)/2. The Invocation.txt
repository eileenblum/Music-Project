See them drown
Emerge the beauty of the earth
See them drown
Voices gasping so;

Dark is the night, and the veils are drawn of shadows
Dark is the day, while the sun is no longer awake
The sun is calling for your dawn
These words colour countless shades I shall revoke beyond these shores
And drink your fading crimson tear

You see them drown
Bodies abandoned by hopes
You hear them drown
Voices gasping so;

Black is the wind, and death lurks in shadows
Black is your heart, and it shutters every piece of joy

Since, the day that we came up here
When skies turned so dead-pale and grey
This absence, the voices that we can't hear
Every time the blood draws this earth
Every time you shed your crimson tears
This absence, the voices we used to hear
The voices that we used to hear
