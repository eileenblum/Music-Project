The slumber of the winter will return
Weeping sunsets will no longer rise
The pale ghost of a darkening soul
Descending through abstract memories
And lost beyond the time

The tears will endure

Nightingale, weeping and seeking
A fortress to an empty hope
Awaken by the breeze of the dawn
To cleanse when all hope is gone
From above the darkling skies
Will summon and evoke your fears
As moon is weeping and stars will mourn
Then fly away,
Into the vast unknown

From the lakes of the north
Hopeless emptiness now will revive
Broken dreams and stories untold
Ghastly silence will exist no more

From the rivers of the north
Hopeless birth of an unhallowed seed
Serene voices will haunt me down
Damnation will evoke the particles of sorrow

The sorrow will endure

Fly away into the deep unknown
Mere this misery that traces you down
Fly away into the vast unknown
When all the hope is lost, you will find the light
