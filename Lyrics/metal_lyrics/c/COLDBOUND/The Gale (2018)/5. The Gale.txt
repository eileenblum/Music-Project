Long are winter's nights; I am longing for it.
Shades of a crimson sky; yet unseen
Winds roar the earth with their insolent reign; upon us; we will crawl
Mist hearken;the heavy burden of my soul; the birth of gale
The birth of gale and the flood will start

The gale may cleanse these waters, that devours this unseen light
As a faceless void on the earth.
The gale may drawn us all, in the bottom of this tranquil sea.
Behold it's might and wrath, behold the gale.

My star is fading away; I can't see
Shape of a dying core; shape of a dying sun
Unsilent winds will show the way through darkness
Unleash the storms; the great endeavour of yours; the birth of gale

Underneath the blood red moon, the gale will strike

Underneath the blood red moon
Shadows covered by hallowed trees
In between of unsilent storms
Down beneath among the mist and wrath of gale

Long are the winter's night; I am longing for it
Shades of a blood red moon; yet unseen
Storms hail the barren soil of the earth
Into this empty shell, into this empty world;
