Define the boundaries of sky
And find the star
The brightest in the nightsky

Suddenly it turns all to grey
But bellow
All turns to ash-dead cold

Am I blind or weak?
Or just lost?
Define my shadow under moonlight

Yet again the fragment of time

The shades of the moonlight

Rite Under Moonlight

Madness and silence complete
As the evening falls
To hide the leavless trees

Trails absurd of despair
As the night grows
Nothing remains the same
