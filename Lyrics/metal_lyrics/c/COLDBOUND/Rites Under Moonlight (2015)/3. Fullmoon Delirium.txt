Beyond the mountains I see
A blaze that is brighter than the most intense light
Suddenly it turns to a fatal beam
Setting into sleep - the creatures of the night

It gathers and calls
Howling wolves and crows
Breaking silence awaits the everlasting frost
And thunders are approaching with furious winds
For the sake of the full moon - the 7th, can't resist

The shiver that I feel
Is vision I can't see
It crumbles the aether
And rumbles in the wind

It dominates the night
And guides the pack of wolves
Is shattering the hills
And shines amidst the woods

Creatures of the night
Gather up here
The surface is cold
It's the wind that you can't hear
The light you can't see
The sense you can't feel
The pack's approaching near
It causes a sense of fear

Forever,infernal yet thus eternal
It rules and growls
And dwelling in the woods
In skies of endless nights,
It's shining all alone
In haze of delight,
And gaze amidst the tombs.

The shiver that I feel
Is vision I can't see
It crumbles the aether
And rumbles in the wind

It dominates the night
And guides the pack of wolves
Is shattering the hills
And shines amidst the woods

Creatures of the night
Gather all here
The surface is cold
The wind that you can't hear
The light you can't see
The sense you can't feel
Forever
Infernal
At least yet not eternal

Full-moon delirium

Full-moon delirium, daylights yet to be unseen
Full-moon delirium, strokes, thunders and furious winds

Full-moon delirium, eerie cold and eternal nights
Full-moon delirium, nature captured beneath thousand tons of ice.
