The ice cold
On the earth

The freezing
Thoughts of ice
And despair

The nocturnal nights
Hunted by thoughts and dreams

I am the nightmare in your sleep

Ice cold

I am your darkness and the light
nocturne in your dreams
Path of sorrow , dressed in ice
Your harvest and your bleak

Ice cold - The path we roam
Ice cold - The fate we chose
Ice cold - The dreams we dreamed
Ice cold - The sorrow is in front
