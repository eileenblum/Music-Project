Ravens and crows above me
And storms,
Of blazing fire winds
Long lost
In light
And fear, that no one can resist

Wandering through icy paths
Searching for a shelter
Nothing to fear
AS I have nothing to conquer
Only frost
In my skin I can feel

Embrace the end
And accept this fate
All is done
Nothing remains the same
