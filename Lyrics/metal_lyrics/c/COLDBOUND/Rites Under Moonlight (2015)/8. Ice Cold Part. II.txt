Howling wolves
Slow demise
Lurking moon
Mounts of ice

Choosing your way, the way for you to die
Night-born creatures, calling your demise

Trapped under
Mounts of ice
Ice cold skin
Frozen eyes

Choosing your way, the way for you to die
Night-born creatures, calling for your demise

Ugh

Choosing your way, the way for you to die
Night-born creatures, calling for your demise

Monuments and ghouls

Crawling towards blood

Beneath world
Bloody misty mountains
Dawn will rise as red
Red as the blood stains on ice
Choosing your way the way for you to die
Night-born creatures, calling for your demise
