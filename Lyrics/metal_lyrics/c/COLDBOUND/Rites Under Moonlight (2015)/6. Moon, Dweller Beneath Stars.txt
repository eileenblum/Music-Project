For the night above me
For the moon - dwells beneath stars
Requesting a transmission for
For the outer space and world
To save me from
From the way of astral dust and flames
Inescapable dreams
Surrounding my thoughts
And hibernate....

disgusting - demanding - abortive - inhale....

Can you hear this ghastly silence?
Echoes so beautiful of pain
Is this light pops out of darkness?
Or is my last moment that I embrace?
Inhale...

In this night of dancing shadows
And the moon is lurking above the earth
Above the earth
