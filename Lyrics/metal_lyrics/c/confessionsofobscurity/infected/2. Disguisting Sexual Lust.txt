Innocent and gentle she lies in the crib
Probably her own little paradise after the womb

Then it happened... it hurts

Her legs spread wide open - her little bones now broken
Her virginity she lost - her entrails severly damaged
Her blood is flowing out - she cries, she screams

That's how he slays, that sick pig called father
With his dick in his own baby

Her just started life is flowing away

An extremely deformed little cadaver is all what remains.
