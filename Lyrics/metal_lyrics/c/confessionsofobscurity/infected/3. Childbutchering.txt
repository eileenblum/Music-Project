Highly pregnant she walks into the supermarket
In the toilet she delivers her baby
The new liveform - she puts in a bag
And smashes it against the wall

Bones are broken - bodyparts separated
Blood and slime flow together
The whole porridge she then throws in a dust-bin

A few times she did, she slayed a few of her children
A few times she slayed her own flesh and blood
Before she was caught by the authorities
