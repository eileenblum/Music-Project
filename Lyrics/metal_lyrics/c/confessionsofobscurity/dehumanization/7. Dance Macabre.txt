Eyes staring into the night
Decaying faces, rotting flesh
Putrified entrails, mutilated cadavers
Rotting organs, disgusting sickness

Around the altar, the macabre is dancing
Innocent victims will meet the face of death
They scream, they crawl but there's no way out
The macabre is dancing soon shall the feast begin

Butchering, screaming, the victims are yet deformed
Carved and snatched the bodies are yet dismembered
Blood drops of the altar, excrements smeared over the rests
The sacrifice is made, new cruelties are created

Around the altar, the macabre is dancing
Decaying faces, rotting organs
Putrified entrail, disgusting sickness
The macabre is dancing... the feast has began.
