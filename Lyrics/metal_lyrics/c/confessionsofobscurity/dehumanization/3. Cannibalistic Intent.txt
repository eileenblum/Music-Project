Mutilated... are the bones
Decaying... is the flesh
Horrible... is the view
Emotions... are bizarre

The stench is unbearable
But the hunger is stronger
Eating her skin, licking her cold pussy
Guts are now torn apart

Her entrails are swallowed
The tongue yet digested
Once she was pretty and filled with life
Now she's slayed and cooked

The cannibals are hungry
More butchering will follow
Maybe you'll be their next dinner
Or do you make those dinners?

Mutilated... are the bones
Decaying... is the flesh
Horrible... is the view
Emotions... are bizarre
