it burns my mind in inner never-ending fire
the smell of morbid air awakes my darkest desire
my body lacks of stable form, despair replaces sorrow
instincts of inhumanity control my thoughts to follow

darkness now has cover me and bloodlust fills my eyes
my filthy voice precedes my breath, crawling through the skies
my once pure heart has turn to black and tears of red i taste
your blood is sacred, mine is damned and there' s no drop to waste

i am the son of sinister, i have the beast inside
i rape your horny little daughters, make' em purified
screams of lust and agony are screams of love and hate
human flesh is now my feast, dead bodies seal my fate

brutal hatred' s all i feel, i crush your souls goodbye
the more you cry the more i laugh, i live therefore you die
charon walks among your skins, alone he waves the loom
you gave me pain, you gave me death, so death i give you too

i feel hatred beyond imagination
pain i seek for my salvation
