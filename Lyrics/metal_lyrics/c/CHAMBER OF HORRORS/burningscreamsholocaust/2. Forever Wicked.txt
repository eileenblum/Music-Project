faces of beauty, lifeless still
i want to rape, i want to kill
flowing darkness from within
i steal your breath and peel your skin

insane, insane, insane, insane

i have no rules, i have no name
i play with you this heinous game
warm throats are violins, blades are sticks
your vivid soul escapes your lips

insane, insane, insane, insane

dispel my thoughts, i grab the knife
i lose my mind, you lose your life
sweet corpses lying in front of me
forever wicked i shall be

sunk in a delirious state of mind, i evoke your name
dementia-eternal slave of yours myself i proudly take
the way your tongue caress my mind reminds me of my debt
merciless, relentless messenger of your will
the sweet stench of your breath surrounds me now
an artist iâ ll become of the macabre, a pioneer of gore
murder is my art, the way i glorify your name

twisted melodies invade my mind
sharpened blade i hold with hate inside
shining endlessly, will blind the blind
