Where is this forest i walk in my dreams
Painted in sunlight and shimmering colours
Yet now the cobwebs absorbing my screams
Cold stone surrounds me and decayed odours

Held by this witch for some virulent reason
Ages in darkness to bear my seclusion
Must find a way myself out of this prison
A passage to break through these walls of delusion

Aimlessly moving in dim halls forsaken
Stumbling in shadows, escaping my past
Reaching the gate, my senses awaken
Here lies the end of my journey at last

Thrashing and beating, a thousand sounds humming
Alas, my efforts have fallen in vain
Waving the whiplash, the mistress is coming
Rewarding my yearnings with fury and pain

Born a slave beneath this tower
Risen on a soil so old
Freedom smells like rotten flower
I'm a freak into this world

Sun won't see me
Wind won't hear me
Rain will take me
Earth will break me
