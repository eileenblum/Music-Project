Faces of beauty, lively still
The hunt begins, it's time to kill
Black breath preludes my screaming cries
Subtracts the sparkle from your eyes

Insane, insane, insane, insane

I have no rules, i have no name
I play with you this heinous game
Your throats for violins, blades for sticks
Your vivid soul escapes your lips

Insane, insane, insane, insane

Dispel my thoughts, i grab the knife
I lose my mind, you lose your life
Blood spilling holes, so warm so sweet
Smother your heart's last feeble beat

Twisted voices suffocate my mind
Sharpened blade i hold with rage inside
Shining endlessly, will cure the blind
