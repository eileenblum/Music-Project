My soul it burns in inner neverending fire
The moonlit wind abruptly wakes my deepest desire
My body lacks of stable form, despair replaces sorrow
Accursed of immortality, lost reason for tomorrow

Creatures foul on eerie fields beset my dreams of late
Morbid hunger moves my steps, dead bodies seal my fate
Unto this world of emptiness, i came to claim my prize
To scream a thousand steaming voices, reddening the skies

I am the son of Sinister, i have the beast inside
A monster's heart to call my own, a demon in my mind
My god is lust and he shall grant me human flesh to taste
And blood to satisfy my thirst for there's no drop to waste

Fiery scorn enlightens me, your end is drawing nigh
The more you cry the more i laugh, i live therefore you die
Your screams of pain and agony are music to my ears
I feast upon your weary breath and drink your shedding tears

Endless greed is my damnation
Man and beast abomination
