This idol of my creation
To this god that I worship

Captive souls
Bow your head to the law
Preacher come forth
Obey your master

Idolator

Self imposed self imprisoned
Devotion to an empty lie

Captive soul
Bow your head to the law
Preacher come forth
Obey your master

Idolator

Praise your god
From this ground
Graven glory
Your false saviour will be crowned
