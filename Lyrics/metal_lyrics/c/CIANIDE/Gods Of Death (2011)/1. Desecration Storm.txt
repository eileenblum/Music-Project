Belching fires blazing forth
The howl of evil minds
Foul churning seas of red
Unbridled furies humble

Desecration storm
Incinerate cinders of life
Plague of revelation
To ash all things remain

Sons of one thousand wars
Revel in infernal waste
Pathetic bounded dormant soul
No hope for human life

Desecration storm
Incinerate cinders of life
Plague of revelation
To ash all things remain
