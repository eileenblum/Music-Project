Unchained disease the lifeless damned
Power curse of ignorance
Obey the lawful impositions
Automatons not to reason

Only the dead shall learn
Sinking deep in this shit
Side by side
Line them up to die

Decline systematic
Enslaved life of fools
Fear lies deception
Contained and controlled

Followers your path is set
Suffer from your own resolve
End solution for your death
No one gets out alive

Blind empty stares
Like Chicago slaughterhouse pigs
Side by side
Line them up to die
