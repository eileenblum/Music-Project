Dark forces elite the summoning of shadows
Serpent races of old gather among the altar
Blind inhuman instinct vessels of ancient knowledge
Condemned desolation nocturnal execution

Ritual sacrifice suffer the children of hell
To feed upon the fear flesh blood and bone

This supreme offering
Ripped from the womb thus defiled
Drink from the infant heart blood
Witness the one true death

Dead lost unborn
Consume energy and pain
To absorb the essence
Of the innocent

Dead lost unborn
Nameless face of sin
Shameless ones depraved
Rages from the insane
