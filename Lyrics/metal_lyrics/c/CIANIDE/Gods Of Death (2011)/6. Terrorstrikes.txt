False prophet's rage
These eyes are flame
Distortion of truth
Which none shall escape
Morbid deception
The beast draws near
In their waking sleep
Never to see or hear

Terrorstrikes

Hordes of living filth
Doom closes in
Damned to endless darkness
End times arise
Torment appetite
Will be relieved
The enemy within
Vultures wait to feast

Terrorstrikes

Blood lust feeds
The war machines
Constant warfare
Instil the fear

Hatred towards all
The power of war
Death will be
Their final judgment
