The countless rotting dead
Decaying in this hell
Forever damned ageless dread
In this barren earth I dwell

Coffin nails forbade within
Tombstone vision this graveyard grim
Last rites unspoken unconsecrated ground
Befallen one no rest dead soul

No more life nothingness
Death is rising shadow realm
Eternal consciousness
This final day darkness engulfs

Born with nothing with nothing depart
Let the funeral procession end
Now awaiting my final rest
Let the funeral procession end

Seal the crypt praise of sin
Grace from pain in my demise
Blind grotesque broken flesh
Mortal remains of dried blood and dust
