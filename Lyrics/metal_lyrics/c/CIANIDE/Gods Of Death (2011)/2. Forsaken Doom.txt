End this pain mental torture inhumane
Dreaming awake endless nightmare
Eternal grey

Ancient shadows
From devil fires rise
Sacrifice
Reclaim their world

Deafening
Demon whispers
Tormented
Insanity

Nameless beyond fear
Dark horrors of the earth
This undying curse
Is my forsaken doom

Hideous
Madness takes hold
No escape
As I await my demise
