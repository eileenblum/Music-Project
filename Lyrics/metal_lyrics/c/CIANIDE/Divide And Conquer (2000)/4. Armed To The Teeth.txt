Death before dishonor
No guts no glory
Frenzied lust for battle
Onward to destiny

Standing your ground, you face the enemy
Succumb to selfish rage

With strength and fire
I challenge the world
Pear becomes courage
Death conquers all

Live for the kill
Armed to the teeth
Assault weaponry
Armed to the teeth
