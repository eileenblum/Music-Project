Live by the sword die by my hand
Justice is swift, conqueror of men
Feel my wrath all of your pain
Feast your eyes on the hell which I have made

I am the way, trail of blood
A wolf among sheep, slay those who are weak
Living this way, never shall fail
Dark legacy, suffer unto me

Sanctify my wrath
On a throne of blood I rule
Unchallenged, torn by hate
On a throne of blood I rule

Kingdom of doom - tyrant's reign
Obey my commands - intimidation
Kneel before me - my enemies
Surrender or die - eliminate all who oppose the law!
