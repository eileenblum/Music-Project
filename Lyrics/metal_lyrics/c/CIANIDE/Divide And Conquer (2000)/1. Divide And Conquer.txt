Hatred lusts through my eyes, vision world sacrifice
Thirst for glory genocide, global peace I despise
So much war endless pain, millions die by my hands
Confusion through treachery, eliminate the enemy

Systematic corruption, feeding off the mindless
Eternal power unopposed crushing the resistance
Kill the spirit, kill the flesh, immense display of carnage
Bloodshed and tyranny, I conquer - victory

Satan's final command:
Pillage rape and plunder
Oppression - divide and conquer
