Structure of defiance, symbolic rage
Humanities demise, destructive rampage

Death tolls riding beyond all control
The world is taken by force
Casting it's shadow of hate
Metallic king, death machine!

Indestructible force, the bringer of doom
Iron strikes the earth, cities are consumed

Mountainous colossal war machine
Living engine of destruction
Panic stricken victims flee
Retaliation unavailing

Black gas fills the air
Air raid sirens cry
Searing death ray vision
Fire rapes the sky
