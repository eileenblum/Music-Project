Drink from the blood of your father's sins
Wipe away shameful tears of lustful greed
Proclaim identity undenied

Corruptive ways
Foundation built on lies
Value debased
Belief is bastardized
Bastardized

Trapped by your doctrines of hate
The weak have no will to escape
Monetary gains fortified
The sheep is the wolf in disguise

Break away the chains of morality
Discover realms which hide stolen troths
Escape and emerge reborn
