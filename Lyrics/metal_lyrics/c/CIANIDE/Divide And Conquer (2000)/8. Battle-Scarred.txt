Blessed by my iron hand
Conquer son of war
Daylight rips my bloodstained flesh
Consuming the wrath of my foes

Battle is the curse of freedom
War is the gift of peace
Struggle is for existence
Strife is for the weak

Steel like nerves infernal slaughter
Embrace my blood fire fury
Death charge and battle scars
Masers of the enemy

The sun has begun to fall
On this day of victory
Brothers in arms sheer defiance
Soldiers of death boast their triumph
