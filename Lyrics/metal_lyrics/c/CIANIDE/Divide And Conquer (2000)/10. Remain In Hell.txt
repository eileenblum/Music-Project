The wage of sin
Burning through your existence
Never knowing the
Righteous path of light

Live for your sins, then die for the truth
Your soul remains in hell
Trials of the damned, perfect transgression
All souls remain in hell

Tortured by choice
Embracing your damnation
A sacred decision
On intense agony

Life lived in shame
Demoralized broken inside
Forever worthless faith
Inferior repentance
Spirit - slaves of sin
Eternal darkness beckons to all
Unforgiven rage
No rewards for glory live for your sins - then die for the truth
