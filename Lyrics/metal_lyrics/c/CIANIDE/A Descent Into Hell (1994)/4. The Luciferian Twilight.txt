Thy wrath is brought down - down to the grave
And the noise of thy viols....
How art thou - fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning
Let he who comes forth be damned eternally
Belied baptism
Hell's fires praise our names
We speak only evil - abusing the masses
What the devil would not speak, we speak it through him
All that is given to you, is given in sin
The Luciferian twilight - of infernal brightness
The Luciferian twilight - now cast into the darkest ruin
