The clouds of twilight, they blind my sight
As it reaches out for forgotton shadows
Crimes of pain released from life
Tired and worn - tortured souls
Burning fires tremble the walls
Breakdown of life
Balance is broken
All stand to watch their fall
Darkness shrouds the fallen kings, as they raise their commands
Knowledge of ignorance
Long-past portals, forgotten in time
Never to be remembered at the gates of slumber
