The forests claim their gifts, surrounded by oblivion
As the night spies on the ghost-lit torches
Words remain unspoken
Beneath the scarlet moon
Bearing the mark of dreams
To everlasting ends
Steps above the horizon lies the trail to false truths
Fires from a different world shout to the nearest distance
Embodied of flesh and bone, spirit of no limits
Transmigrate, infest the soul
No longer enslaved
Blinded by the will of god, so much for free will
Vulgar temptations scale this towering wall of hate
