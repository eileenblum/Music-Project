The fires from within
The outcome of destiny
All men are equal
Within the shroud of mortality
Look inside the door to find blank tranquility
Exposing the limits of imperishability
Lifeline of the gods
Trite magnificence - worship is unworthy to those who believe
Epulsion of faith - prophecies fake
Infinite limits bearing their names
Immortality's fading away
Invade boundaries clutching their graves
So let us pray, for this fucking false idol!
His very life, an exaggerated lie
No acts of contrition can blindly justify the sacrilege
May you rot for all eternity!
