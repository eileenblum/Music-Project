Rising from an ageless dream
Reborn through nuclear fires
An ominous, ancient beast, legends have told - never to be seen....
Inexorable - death shall walk
Return of what once ruled - eons past
Invincible - force unknown
Unnatural fires - burn, consume
Hear its roar - like mountains in thunder
Cities rise and fall oceans turn to flame
Eyes glaring hate
Destruction in its wake
This towering horror's shadow falls upon panic-stricken screams
This ain't no fucking dream!
