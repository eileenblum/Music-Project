Tyrant Hands Grip the World
In Hateful Unyielding Wrath
Conforming Hordes Bow in Splendor
Raise the Heads of the Thinking Dead

Life of the Enslaved
Trust No One
Decay of the Truth
Trust No One

Eternal Quest for Power
Turns Them Against Themselves
Showing a Hateful Spirit
Undenied in its Strength

Hypocrisy Reigns Supreme
Worship of Forbidden Greed
