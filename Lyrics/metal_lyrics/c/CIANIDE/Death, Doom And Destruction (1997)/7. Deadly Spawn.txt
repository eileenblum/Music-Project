Doomsday plague for a modern day Sodom
A deadly spawn of origin unknown
Like a flame burning deep inside
Infected blood of a dying world

All life dies
All life must bleed
Killer deadly spawn
World suffering

Doomsday plague for a modern day Sodom
A deadly spawn of origin unknown
Explosive strain spreads
through the population
Dawn of death, pain grips the world

Rotting contagious infection, no hope, no cure
Hunted by an unseen enemy
no chance to survive
Will this be the final judgment, the end, the last
Extinction for the human species
As foretold Armageddon
