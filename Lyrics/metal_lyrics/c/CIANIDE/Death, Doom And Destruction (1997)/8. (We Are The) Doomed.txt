I've seen the future, I've known the past
So come now and join us and death will last
March now my children, let's rule with pride
There is no future, nowhere to hide

We are the doomed
We are the doomed

Bound by your chains, you try to break free
Dreamworld deception - false liberty
Open your eyes, feed off the blind
Nothing remains but death inside

We are the doomed
We are the doomed

Hatred and fear, our lives are secondary
Rage and power, the roads to genocide
Deny, divide, sustain no life
Eat it, burn it, fuck it, you kill it all

We are the doomed
We are the doomed
