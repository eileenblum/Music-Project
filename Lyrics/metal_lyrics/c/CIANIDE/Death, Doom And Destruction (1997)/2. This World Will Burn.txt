Human tears fall to hell like rain
Feel the power of everlasting pain
Scenes of death ache your weary mind
No escape, struggle to survive

Hell spitfire
This world will fucking burn
None shall remain
This world will fucking burn

Death has come from beyond the skies
Sun collapse, star demise
Disintegrate radiation mass
Collision course annihilation

Molten melted twisted mass
One thousand times the sun
Destination target: Earth
Nowhere you can run
