Succumb to me, surrender my woeful one
Whose cries of grief echo everlasting

Worship me and the ground that I walk
Bound and chained, tools of pain
Hate is my king, blood is my queen

Envy hatred I will gain

A kiss of death, a vision of life
Laid to waste your body
Blood and your soul

For lust and pain, innocence lost
All we are is hate
Burning insane, final embrace
Flower of flesh and blood
