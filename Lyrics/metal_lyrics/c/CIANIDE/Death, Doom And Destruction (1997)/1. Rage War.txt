With burning eyes we shall defy
Draining your fucking lives
Crush those who stand in our way
You're dead now, too late to pray

Time is now to rage war

You think you're deadly
You say you're true
We just shit all over you
Time is now your eyes to see
The face of death - reality

Time is now to rage war

Time is now - take your stand
To rage war - across this land

Maim to please, we shall destroy
Taste the Cianide and fucking die
Final straw you shall be dealt
Piss on you, watch you melt

Time is now to rage war
