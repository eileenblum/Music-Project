As I fall away, immortal visions reign
Gateway to the unknown successor
to former lives
Bring to me the stench
of burning hate
Slaves of revelation call
final warning, final fate

As I fall away
Salvation
Rejects me

Blood stained salvation
handed down with faith
Eternal fear a just reward
something for revenge
I hear the voices cry
beckon to be told
An ancient truth unveiled
a fortress of deceit

Seasons of decay, harvest of souls
Faith condemned
Shamed once again
Emptiness fills my void
