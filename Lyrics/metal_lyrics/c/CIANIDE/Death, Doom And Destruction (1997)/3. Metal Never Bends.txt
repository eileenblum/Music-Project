Years have past
Metal will last
Forever growing strong
As we crush the cowards

Destroying the trends
Killing the false ones dead
Headbanging 'til the end

Metal never bends

Hail to our friends
Drinking until the end
Playing Metal from our hearts
Hitting the stage in a

Death Metal rage

Metal and leather bound together
The war has begun
Axe swung low, fists held high
The battle has been won
