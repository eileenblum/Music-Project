I have been awaiting - Since the dawn of man
To regain dominion - To seek my revenge

From the day which I fell
Darkness has been my slave
In the name of Hell
I remain the betrayed

Fallen angel of light, condemned to rule
Grant me the power to destroy

I shall send forth my legions
To plague across the earth
Death Doom and Destruction
For all souls to burn

I care not for your feeble mortal lives
A divinity of soul destruction
All of my hatred and desires
Live within the hearts of man

I am the god destroyer
Damned to be eternally
I am the lord of chaos
Creator of sin, praise my name
