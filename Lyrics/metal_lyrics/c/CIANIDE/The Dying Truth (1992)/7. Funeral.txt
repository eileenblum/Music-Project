Earth to earth ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
You hear these words from me.
Trapped down in fire, rest your soul in flames.
Eternal torment, rot for eternity.

Take your souls,
flames get higher,
Rebirth below,
Hand in hand we die.

See the earth burn on Judgment Day.
Death of sinners, flesh and mind decays.
Burning bones, stench of melting flesh,
Eternal torment, marching into hell.

Take your souls,
flames get higher,
Rebirth below,
Watching your own death.

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes dust to dust.
You hear these words from me.
