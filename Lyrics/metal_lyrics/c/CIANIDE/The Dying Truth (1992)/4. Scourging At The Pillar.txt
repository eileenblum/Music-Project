Procession for living souls,
Victim of the sins of man.
Resurrection fortold,
Denial of the lamb.

For every breath I try,
I know that I must die.

Scourging at the pillar

Procession for living souls,
Victim of the sins of man.
Resurrection fortold,
Denial of the lamb.

For every breath I try,
I know that I must die.

As I grip my cross,
this pain I feel.
The son of man,
Afterlife revealed.

As I grip my cross
shedding blood-tears.
Thoughts of the dying world,
Betrayal and fear.

Crowned king, then crucified,
my life is sacrificed.
Fate of mankind,
Realize, time to die
