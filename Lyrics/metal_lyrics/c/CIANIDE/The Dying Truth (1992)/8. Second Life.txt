Lifelessness, the path to death,
Time is impatient,
Distortion of birth,
Unjust favors, unheard screams.

[Chorus:]
Twisting in pain, misfortune falls upon you.
Unfortunate circumstance, No chance for second life.
Fantasies of death, withheld by ignorance.
Timeless unbirth.
No chance for second life.

Unlived experience, grief and sorrow, disrupted life-flows.
Baptism of blood, death by life, confound reality.

[Chorus]

A right to live,
Exposed to death,
Forgotten? Unanswered?
A question to life.

Lifelessness, the path to death,
Time is impatient,
Distortion of birth,
Death by life, confound realities.
