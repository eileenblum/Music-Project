Mind you see
through walls of being.
Built on terror
from life around.

See the world
from which you came.
You have no part
but to be enslaved.

[Chorus:]
Lurking into
the unknown fear.
Signs of life
which have past.
Excruciating,
Sickening pain.
Final breath
is your last.

[Chorus 2:]
Time to pray
Mindscrape
The choice is free
Time to pray
Mindscrape
Succumb to greed

Torturing your mind,
Caved-in surroundings.
Forcing outbreak,
Trapped by inner-self.

Ever-growing need
from what to expect.
Future holds nothing
Life is a wreck.

[Chorus]

Pay for remorse
of which to pay.
Life of suffering
Dying day.

[Chorus 2]

Masters of greed
from which you feed.
No escape
from this world of hate
