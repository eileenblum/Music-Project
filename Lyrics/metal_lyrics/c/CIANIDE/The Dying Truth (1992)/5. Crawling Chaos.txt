End my painful ways,
Insanity prevails over my darkened soul,
Pounding feverishly.

The pains of haunted dreams.
Crawling chaos.

Attempt to grip your fate,
Falling into delirium,
Timeless lords await
through the vast universe.

Rise, time spent disease.
Cries out for their souls.

Life that lies within the soul.
Return of the ones foretold.

End my painful ways,
Insanity prevails over my darkened soul,
Pounding feverishly.
The pains of haunted dreams.
