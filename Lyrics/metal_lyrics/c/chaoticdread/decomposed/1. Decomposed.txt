As she was escaping, then she was chased injured!
Stabbed with no mercy, raped like a whore
Helpless and naked and
She begged for resistance, but her throat were grabbed tortured!
Act of inhumanity trapped and assault
Slaughtered and carnage and
Bleeding and broken, pain with no cure wounded!
Dragged to decompose, she bleed more and more
Stripped and rotted and
Rotten and decayed killed with no guilt
Suffer!
Organs were swallowed its skin were torn
Strangle and buried and died

Homicide
Slaughtered butchered body
Tortured with torment
Suffocate mutilate impaled body
Agony they deserve
Left alone in waste bin I can feel her body were cold
Flesh and bones were separate I know now it's decomposed

Carcass
Flesh turn to ash
Carcass
Flesh turn to ash
Carcass
Flesh turn to ash

Homicide
Slaughtered butchered body
Tortured with torment
Suffocate mutilate impaled body
Agony they deserve
Left alone in waste bin I can feel her body were cold
Flesh and bones were separate I know now it's decomposed
