Please don't leave.
There's nothing in this world that could ever matter
more than you.
You're everything I ever needed, too.
So how can I explain myself for wanting you?
Every time I try I close my eyes and say I do

Your love, love is the only thing, thing that is holding me.
Love is the only thing, thing that is holding me in place

God I'm done, it runs through my mind.
All these empty spaces are just a waste. I'd give up my life.
Love is crap, it's worth my luck.
Every night alone, always on the run. I need something back home.
I need something back home
I need something back home
I need something back home
I need something back home

Your love, love is the only thing, thing that is holding me.
Love is the only thing, thing that is holding me in place

And when you want me to,
I will run away with you.
I don't care what you're father says,
cause I'll love you til the end.
Forever waiting in your room,
for me to come home and rescue you
It's not the way we thought it would be.
We'll be okay, just wait and see

Only your love, love is the only thing, thing that is holding me.
Love is the only thing, thing that is holding me in place.
