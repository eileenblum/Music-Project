Wake up, you can feel the pressure (pressure)
You breathe in but your lungs are weak (lungs are weak)
Begging you to feel the pain
Every day just feels the same

You wanted change, face another imagining
I'm going pro and now you're running on empty
What's the point of living life like a picture?
Every day wake up and see the same old bullshit

I tried to walk away cause I'm suffocating in this room
(This Is the oxygen!) That I need whoa

This is the promise that I made to myself
This is the time to realize, that your time has run out

I'm not a fucking machine, I am a human being
I'm not a fucking machine, I am a human being

I tried to walk away cause I'm suffocating in this room
(This Is the oxygen!) That I need whoa
I tried to walk away cause I'm so frustrated in this room
(This is the only way!) To be whoa

Push your eyes and take your love or your burn
So excited in the life to your eyes
That's right

We both know it's a shame, to waste your life away
I cannot breathe, I cannot sing out (sing out)
I'm paralyzed in black and white
So let these colors back into my life

I tried to walk away cause I'm suffocating in this room
(This Is the only oxygen!) That I need whoa (This is the only thing!)
I tried to walk away cause I'm so frustrated in this room
(This is the only way!) To be whoa

I locked myself up, I've built these walls all around
Just to keep myself safe, but the problem is I can't find one without
(Whoa) I can't find one without
I can't find one without
