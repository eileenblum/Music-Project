It's not in your head while sleeping
The sound of your parents screaming
I'll wait for you to turn out the lights

Sadness is all that is surrounding
You run and hide so frantically
From faces no one seems to see
They make you wish that you were dead
That's no way to live, that's no way to live

My hands are steady
My heart lacks a beat
My veins are cold as ice
My blood only knows
I know nothing but disease

I'm not the one giving up
How can I make it back to the basics?
Of growing up and moving on
Somewhere that I belong

To feel invincible
I have to pump my veins with this disease
It's the only way to hide the shaking of my knees
I'm afraid (I'm afraid)
I'm so scared (I'm so scared)
I cant bare to see the shadows down the stairs

Well I'll take a moment
To live this life from inside your body
I'll trade my soul with yours
Live your life with no closed doors
It's a shame that no one's done this before

I'm not the one giving up
How can I make it back to the basics?
Of growing up and moving on
Somewhere that I belong

I'm not the one giving up
(I'm not the one giving up)

I'm not the one giving up
(I'm not the one giving up)
Don't give up on me
(Don't give up on)

I've convinced myself
I won't go to hell
When I die because I'm living in it

I've convinced myself
I won't go to hell
When I die because I'm living in it

It's not in your head while sleeping
The sound of your parents screaming
I'll wait for you to turn out the lights
Turn out the lights (Don't Turn out the lights!)

I'm not the one giving up
How can I make it back to the basics?
Of growing up and moving on
Somewhere that I belong
