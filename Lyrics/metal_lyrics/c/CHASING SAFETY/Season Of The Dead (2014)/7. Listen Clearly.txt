[feat. Spencer Charnas]I'm so sick of everything you say
And I know it's not the first time those words came out your mouth
I'm not afraid to let you know how I feel
Because it's getting to the point where I can't stand it anymore

What's wrong with you? We don't think you're cool
What's wrong with you? We don't think you're cool

You fade away like the words you speak
You'll never understand the truth cause it's hurting you
How will you find your way when you know that it's over?
Know that it's over

This is not the time, and there is no place
All the oxygen you used is just a waste
What compels you to let us know about
The shit that you think gives you something to show?

Walking faster to escape from your side
Don't give a fuck about your stories
Or who you were with last night
I'm being honest so listen clearly
Cause you spent the one night in his bed
That doesn't make you friends with him

You fade away like the words you speak
You'll never understand the truth cause it's hurting you
How will you find your way when you know that it's over?
Know that it's over

This only last so long

I'm so sick of this. I'm so sick of you

Everyday is just the same damn thing
Completely different state and city
Yet they're still dropping names
Everyday the same damn thing
Everyday it's such a shame

You fade away like the words you speak
You'll never understand the truth cause it's hurting you
How will you find your way when you know that it's over?
Know that it's over

This only lasts so long
Only lasts so long
Only lasts so long
