You're far away

I'm breaking down I'm crumbling from the weight
That's been resting on top of me. Is it in my face?
Unanswered questions, regretful answers, about my choice of space
Why am I afraid to be who's inside of me?
I've been running towards the light for all eternity

I've been so lost and I just want to feel alive

You're far away when I'm on the edge of the world
Don't go, keep a place for me in your heart
Far away when I'm on the edge of the world
Don't go, keep a place for me in your heart

As I stand here on the edge of this fucking cliff
Should I just jump give up and put an end to this?
All I seem to want is to die. All I want is to die

I've been so lost and I just need to feel alive

You're far away when I'm on the edge of the world
Don't go, keep a place for me in your heart
Far away and I'll never make it back home
Back home, is there a place for me in your heart?

I was blinded now I see what's in front of me
All the things I thought I never loved have opened up my eyes, my eyes

I'm on the edge but I see my way back home to start something new

You're far away when I'm on the edge of the world
Don't go, keep a place for me in your heart
Far away but I'm on my way back home
Back home, cause there's a place for me in your heart

Cause there's a place for me in your heart far, far away
