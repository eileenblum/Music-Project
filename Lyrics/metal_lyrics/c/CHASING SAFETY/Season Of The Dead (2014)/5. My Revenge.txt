[feat. Kyle Bihrle]I feel betrayed, I feel so bitter
How could you do this to me?
I put my heart onto the table and you just had a feast
Time passes me by as I sit and wonder why

I've been left broken
How can I pick up the pieces?
Have I really been so blinded?
Now I see everything

Won't give up, I don't care who's by my side
I'm not lost, I'm not lost
Oh I'll never give up, I don't care who's by my side

I'm coming, I'm coming for you, then you'll see
You'll see, You'll see what you did to me
You tore me apart, limb by limb, limb by limb
You tore me apart, limb by limb

You head right for the kill, not a blink or hesitation
I'm sick of giving second chances, second chances tot those
Not worthy of my time, I don't need you anymore

Won't give up, I don't care who's by my side
I'm not lost, I'm not lost
Oh I'll never give up, I don't care who's by my side
Won't give up, I don't care who's by my side
I'm not lost, I'm not lost
Oh I'll never give up, I don't care who's by my side

I'll pull your heart right through your chest
And clench my fist I'll fucking finish this

I'm running circles around everyone who had me on my knees
Happy to say I've always been me
Days conclude and I'm set loose into temptation and dreams
My revenge is that I'll stay and you'll shortly leave

Well I'm on deck I'm swinging for the fence
And I won't leave till I get my revenge
I'm on deck swinging for the fence
And I won't leave till I get my revenge

Now I won't leave until I get my revenge
