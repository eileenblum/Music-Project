I'm sorry sir, but I've got my side to tell
About the time I walked in a room and fell for an angel
Dancing in the air, walked through the door
And pulled up a chair, looked her right in her eyes
I knew she took my life right there

Oh what I'd give to have her heart
I fell for her like in a god damn storybook
"Whoa, wait, relax" is what she said to me
But I know it's not how she meant to be
"Backup" is what they said to me
I know that this is how it's supposed to be

I would love you just the same if you had any other name
Cause I know we're meant to be
I would love you just the same if you had any other name
Cause I know we're meant to be
But no matter what I do, I'll never get enough of you
Cause you'll never be with me

"Stay away, stay away, stay away" that's all I ever hear
It's like a ringing, It's like a ringing in my ear
"Keep away" that's whats she said to me
I vow to never give up, that was the death of me

"Stay, stay away, stay, just stay away"

When I followed her home it was so that she'd know
That I'd always be there, I swear, I never meant for her to be so scared

I would love you just the same if you had any other name
Cause I know we're meant to be
But no matter what I do, I'll never get enough of you
Cause you'll never be with me

I saw her when I got out of my car, yeah I was parked on her street
But that's not the point of my story thus far
I walked up to her, told her I loved her, told her I needed her
She ran, so I ran, because I knew, she'd be mine

If you and I will never be I won't go on, they'll take my life from me
I tried so hard to give myself to her but there was never enough, fuck

I would love you just the same if you had any other name
Cause I know we're meant to be
But no matter what I do, I'll never get enough of you
Cause you'll never be with me

And that's the last you'll hear from me and this god damn tragedy
As they take my life away
