I walk these streets and look at people's faces
They behind these masks day after day
I am so sick of the place that I live
I find myself gaining my friends in the wind

I hate everyone from the bottom of my heart
It's about damn time to let you know that
I hate everyone and I'll never be a part
Of the lies, I despise, you've all been fake from the start

Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
I will never push over, never give in
Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
Your filthy face makes me see red

I'm sick and tired of all the fucking things
You try to force inside my head and convince me to think

There's no truth is selflessness
When you're living with demons you don't know exist
You're consumed by the demons you don't know exist
There's no truth in your selflessness
There's no truth in your selflessness

Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
I will never push over, never give in
Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
(Oh, oh ,oh)

Hey everybody, come crowd around
And watch the shit show that you've all allowed
They remove their masks, and you don't like what you see
They become an enemy of you and me

No I don't get it, I don't understand, no I don't understand
Why is everyone hiding from me? What's their master plan?

Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
I will never push over, never give in
Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
Your filthy face makes me see red

Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
I will never push over, never give in
Why should I have to lie, no it's not in my head
(Oh, oh ,oh)

I hate everyone from the bottom of my heart
It's about damn time to let you know that
I hate everyone and I'll never be a part
Of the lies, I despise, you've all been fake from the start
