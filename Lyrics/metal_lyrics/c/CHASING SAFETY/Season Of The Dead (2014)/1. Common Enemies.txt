Thoughts and memories, I can't believe that you could leave
This is my last chance to see if I can raise it from the deep
I'm not afraid to leave, not afraid to let you go
You gotta find a way to let me know
So I can finally see how it's supposed to be
I can't control what's inside of me

I am a man of sin, wretched thoughts running through my head
Every time I look in your eyes
You're disgusting, yet selfish and blind

I know (I know), you think we're holding onto something that's unreal (unreal)
And you'll never know, never know just how it feels
You'll never know just how it feels
Leaning back onto my heels
I'm not sturdy anymore, OH

You're on your own, you're such a waste of time
You're on your own, and you left me here to die
I hope it's not too late for me now
I hope it's not too late for me now

I am so fed up with the bullshit you fed me since day one
I might as well make an example of you
I'll put his head through a wall
To prove my point to you all
All my bones grow tired enduring the fall
And I stand before you to rectify the things that I've done
Promises I've broken, words I have spoken
I am here, soon to be gone

You're on your own, you're such a waste of time
You're on your own, and you left me here to die
I hope it's not too late for me now
I hope it's not too late for me now

I've given up (I've given up) let it be known I'm not afraid
I've given up (and I'm not afraid) to let it be, knowing I'm not ashamed
I'm all alone, I'm here to regain my identity

(Whao, whao oh oh oh oh) (Whao oh, whao oh oh oh)
OH YEAH! FUCK YOU!

You're on your own, you're such a waste of time
You're on your own, AND YOU LEFT ME HERE TO DIE

You're on your own, you're such a waste of time
You're on your own, and you left me here to die
I hope it's not too late for me now
I hope it's not too late for me now

(Whao, whao oh oh oh oh) (Whao oh, whao oh oh oh)
