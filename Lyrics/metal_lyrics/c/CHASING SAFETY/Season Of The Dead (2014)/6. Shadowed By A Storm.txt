I've been shadowed by a storm but now it's gone
So keep it away, keep me away tonight

I've longed for answers to all these questions
I've asked myself for the past two years
Fallen prey circled by the vultures
Waiting for a chance to feed, waiting for a chance to feed on me

I'm fighting, believing that I'll find a meaning
I can't live this way anymore, I'm tired of waiting
I feel like I'm fading away, I feel like I'm fading away

Have I been on a sinking ship?
Have I been drowning my life away?
Have I been on a sinking ship?
Have I been drowning my life away?

This could be the only way to find out if I'm meant to stay
Cause problems on the front wont put an end to this war anyway

I'm fighting, believing that I'll find a meaning
I can't live this way anymore, I'm tired of waiting
I feel like I'm fading away, I feel like I'm fading away

I'm so lost inside my own damn mind
I think about this all the fucking time
I'm so lost in this sick world of mine
My mind is hollow, have I lost all time?

Am I just drifting out to be a forgotten melody?
And all the things that we love, and all the things we do
Were never good enough
Is it too much to lose?

Have I been so blind while my life just passed away
To the depths to be swallowed?
Everyone I used to know
They fall away, they fade away

I'm fighting, believing that I'll find a meaning
I can't live this way anymore, I'm tired of waiting
I feel like I'm fading away, I feel like I'm fading away

I'm fighting, believing that I'll find a meaning
I can't live this way anymore, I'm tired of waiting
I feel like I'm fading away, I feel like I'm fading away

Have I been on a sinking ship?
Have I been drowning my life away?
