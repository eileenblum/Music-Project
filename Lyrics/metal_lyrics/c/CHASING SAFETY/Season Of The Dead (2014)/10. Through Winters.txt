[feat. Jason Lancaster]Three years ago when we first met you were so young and shy
But you grew into your wings to become a butterfly
Now your poison breaks through skin, feel it in my fingertips
But I won't mind, cause I wanna be right by your side

And I will go. Yeah I will cross the earth to find you a cure

In dreams to come we'll both wake up
And have a place called home
And we'll grow into our souls and admit we're getting old
But when time starts running out and my heart starts slowing down
Oh I won't mind cause I know you'll be right by my side

You're all I am, and I forget the rest
You're all I am, and I forget...

So close your eyes cause it's gonna be a long ride
I'll wake you when we're there. I'll take you everywhere

(My one)
Cause you are my everything, my one and only

Now your poison breaks through skin, feel it in my fingertips
But I won't mind, cause I wanna be right by your side
Now your poison breaks through skin, feel it in my fingertips
But I won't mind, cause I know you'll be right by my side
