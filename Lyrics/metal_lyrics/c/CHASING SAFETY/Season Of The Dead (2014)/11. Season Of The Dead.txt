[feat. Garrett Rapp]You are, you are what you become
So I'll give it all I got till I've had enough

You are what you become

You are, you are what you become
So I'll give it all I got till I've had enough
I'm so afraid of whats to come
Were they ever enough, the things we've done?

Living for me till the end of time
I'm afraid but feeling alive
Living for me till the end of time

I've been looking at the light but diving in
I'm afraid of life because of where I've been
I am simply man I'll never know
Where I'll be when I go

I don't think you should follow me
Cause I'm not sure yet of where I'm gonna be
We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden
So I won't run, won't run away from what this all could be
We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden

We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden

We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden

Every picture stayed in every frame
In the long run I guess I didn't really recognize anything anyways
Nothing gold ever seems to stay
But I can accept the fact that sometimes
You gotta leave things where they lie

I don't think you should follow me
Cause I'm not sure yet of where I'm gonna be
We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden
So I won't run, won't run away from what this all could be
We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden

We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden

We're all, we're all living for something
We know, we know nothing is golden

Terrified, terrified to see what the future holds for me
Terrified, terrified to see what the future holds for me
Will I end up a fucking lonely soul? Will I end up a lonely soul?
Am I destined to be on my own? Am I destined to be alone?

We know nothing is golden, but we face our fears and keep on going
We know nothing is golden, but we face our fears and keep on going

(We know nothing is golden, but we face our fears and keep on going)
You're on your own, won't give up I don't care who's by my side
When I'm on the edge of the world, To find you a cure
But it's tearing me apart, But I know that it's over, know that it's over
(We know nothing is golden, but we face our fears and keep on going)

We know nothing is golden, but we face our fears and keep on going
We know nothing is golden, but we face our fears and keep on going

Do we live our life to die?

We know nothing is golden, but we face our fears and keep on going.
