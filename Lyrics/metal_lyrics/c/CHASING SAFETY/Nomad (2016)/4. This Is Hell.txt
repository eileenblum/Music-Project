Itâs not my fault no
But itâs how it has to be
Fought through thick and thin
But my skins not as tough as it was back then

This is not the way I thought it be
Lost lives and broken memories
I laid my head down yours then lifted up
You floated through the door forgetting what you loved

Itâs how it has to be

This is hell I need more broken knees wont fix whatâs torn
With every word you say the further I fall away from you
It pains me more and more the further I fall away from you

I told you once or twice I told you what you meant to me 
I said Iâd stay right here but this is not my home

Tamed riot false silence angry at the world for one liar
Soft spoken weights loaded upon my back where it
Lied when you locked the door

Itâs how it has to be

This is hell I need more broken knees wont fix whatâs torn
With every word you say the further I fall away from you
It pains me more and more the further I fall away from you

Stay quiet
Iâve been here since you went down that road
Now the only thing that matters is saving my poor soul
I found out on my own stay in line you must abide the rules
Of life were shown wait for my only home to come back 
Itâs surely lost I canât be on my own wait for my only home to
Come back its surely lost I canât be all alone

Itâs how it has to be

This is hell I need more broken knees wont fix whatâs torn
With every word you say the further I fall away from you
It pains me more and more the further I fall away from you
