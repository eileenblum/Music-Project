This is a lonely road
Iâm not sure where it goes

This is a lonely road that more than I have know
Iâve reached a crossing the pavement splits in two
Do I follow blindly which ways the light that I once knew

This is my life and the choices given 
Every day is a brand new prison
I have had enough Iâm struggling one my own
Still standing, Iâm fighting. 
This is my life the hell I live in 
This is my brand new prison

I stand here at this crossing
No I donât mind tell me what to do
Have I gone insane
Thereâs no one here no one but you
Wait wait I rack my brain to find the light that I once knew
Wait wait it's like a traffic jam yet no other souls around

This is my life and the choices given 
Every day is a brand new prison
I have had enough Iâm struggling one my own
Still standing Iâm fighting this is my life
The hell I live in this is my brand new prison

And I am left no guide to fight I need a life to live
And I am left I need a life to live

This isnât right this isnât fair for all my life Iâve been going nowhere
As my coin sinks deep below I wish for answers someone to tell me Where to go

Just stop this way Iâm feeling Iâm all alone in life right now I won't be Here for much longer in this hell

Still standing Iâm fighting

This is my life and the choices given 
Every day is a brand new prison
I have had enough Iâm struggling one my own
Still standing Iâm fighting this is my life
The hell I live in this is my brand new prison
