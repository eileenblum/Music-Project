Footprint engraved, forged by their misleading hand
I am awake from this nightmare, forming me, shutting me down

All that could be, all that is not.
Spinning idea, of gained and lost

Turning my eight, gambling with faith
Goals build on wish to reach eternity
Walls covered red, that's what I'll left
For my purpose I will bleed

Don't give up or you'll never be free

Filth from inside
Eats you alive
Blueprints processed through every day
Until messiah comes
To take you away

Clones all around me
Marionettes, leave footprint engraved
For another to trace
Condemned to move in the rhythm of their drums
Living from spite
I will never stop fighting

Emptiness inside filled with dark
Casting greed to fill your need
Another numb soul
Killing us all
Turning my eight, gambling with faith
I'm reaching eternity, gambling with faith

Don't give up or you'll never be free
