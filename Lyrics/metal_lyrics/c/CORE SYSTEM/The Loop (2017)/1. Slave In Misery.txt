Slave in misery,
Waiting on command of those who speak
I've lived long enough to see it all come down to
Trap me, can't you see, they seek me,
Relying on my patience to be endlessly

Johnny, me, self redeemed
No use of this misery
Yeah,
Awaken inside,
I'll do what you want me to do
You will not break me

Johnny, me, self redeemed
Your enemies are closing in
No,
I will not collide
Screaming for his help in need
Go, don't push me!

Shaped down to your desire, forever to be served and fed
I walk among those who put knives in back, for fun, for free
Johnny laughs and Johnny bleeds,
But never sets back, or rides with the wind
Growl and I scream in this symphony

Live your life divided from those who make you bleed

Junkie, low life, sucking me
Constantly calling to assist
Jump, roll over, dance
I can't keep with endless race, ungrateful ways
Through whole my life

Overwhelm your desire to be free
Make the pain disappear
Your enemies are closing in
