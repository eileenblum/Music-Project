This is the empty space
The endless race for the cure
This is the deepest thought
This is the only shot

Summon the darkness and fight the beast
Raging in freezing fire that you've increased

Blank pages of your emotions
Keeping up with your devotions

Trying to fit all the pieces in darkness of your delight

Your mind ignores your soul,
Once it starts to take control
The empty space, the black hole
Closed cage, damage control

Summon the darkness and fight the beast
Raging in freezing fire that you've increased

Blank pages of your emotions
The shadow that's watching you is trying to speak your words

Getting to the end of this horrible dark
Waking up tired of it all
The voice inside is crystal clear
You have reached the end

Keeping up with your devotions
Trying to fit all the pieces in darkness of your delight
The empty space, the endless race
The shadow that's watching you is trying to speak your words
The deepest thought, the only shot
