No, it can't be true
It is a fuckin' lie
Rationalization in
Every aspect of life

I can't undo my fate
Erase the pain I get
But u can explain it all
Draw lines, fill every hole ã
So empty, feels so cold
People vanish when you need someone to lean on

The long regret, life in velvet
Common life to every man
To leave something for his human friend
Peaceful life to every man

No, it can't be true
It is a fuckin' lie
Rationalization in
Every aspect of life

Life of hollow goals
Reach them, but never fall
Like your life was one way road
With no rocks to stumble on

Divided by mind and soul
Connected as one
But truth is less explainable
Twisted as peoples kind

I want to get out
It's choking me
The loop of life I lead
Ease my pain
It's choking me
The loop of life I lead
