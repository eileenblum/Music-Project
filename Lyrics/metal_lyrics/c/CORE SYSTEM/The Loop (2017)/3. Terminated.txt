Afraid of changes
Afraid of failure
Afraid of rejection
Afraid of your own self

A man who quits working is dead
He has no influence
He wants to disturb me
A dead men can't disturb
They're dying everyday it's like a
Termination
I can't believe how they gave up
If it seems right it doesn't mean that it is right
I can't believe
Unable to breath, unable to live
They all just are
Terminated

You are
Terminated
Your life has faded out, you're
Terminated
You're fading!

When you have doubts, listen to yourself
If it feels right then it is right
So never give up!

Lame as fuck I cannot look at you
I need to go away, I see right trough you
The show is about to start, put that mask on your face,
It must be exhausting day after day

I need you to tell me that I'm not alright
I'm loosing my battle, and then again I start

Don't go trough that path!
