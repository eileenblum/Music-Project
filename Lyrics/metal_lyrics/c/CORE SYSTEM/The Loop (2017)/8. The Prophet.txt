Awake from dream
Or does it seem
Look around yourself
Journeys on this path
Watch their face
Emotions they hide
Signs of pain
Signs of all they
Left behind
Or run away
Then they let me
See it all through their eyes
Paths that they took me through
And pain they cause
Shiny outside, colourful charm
But as I come close I saw
Rotting from inside

Take my memory
I don't want to know origins of this creation

Come sunrise I won't hide
That evil burns deep inside

That's why you have to die!

Look how we're happy
Jumping and fooling around
Look how we love to
See better ones cry
If you can't enjoy
The life we have down here
Fuck of and find
Another place to live

Enter the Babylon
Unleash the devil in yourself
Embrace the evil within
Enter the Babylon

Between the good an bad lays human
One that can choose the path he takes
Change yourself to change the world
Screaming false truth, whores with no name,
Assholes need attention,
Different people that are same,
Mothers crying for honest men,
Finding them in garbage can
Grow up and find that
Animal is friendlier than man

White light from heaven and dark one from hell,
There's no difference if our point of view is bad
Stereotypes we hate, and idiots we date,
Locked in this hollow world
Where I'm becoming one of them

Broken harmony of love
Greed of one individual
Can destroy the warmth of the sun
I don't want to become one of them
Colors are turning gray,
Is there anything left to say?
