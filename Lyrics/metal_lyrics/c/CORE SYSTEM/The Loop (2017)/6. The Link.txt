I need you to tell me that it is alright
Lose battle and then again, start
Journey of pain starts with every new step
If we continue breaking different, world will stop
I am not flesh nor I am ghost
I live in you within everything you've lost
Love is right, but love as they see
If you don't obey, they'll take all you can be
Rise or fall, dictated by burden of one man
Limited and stupid in his way
Never listen to the truth we say

Hear me now, source of life is burning
Our world is turning
Bleed now, the tumor's open
Sick mind, wrong ink loaded
