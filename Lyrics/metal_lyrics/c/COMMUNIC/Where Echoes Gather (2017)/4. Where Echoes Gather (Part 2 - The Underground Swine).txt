As the media turns its crippled eye
Nobody cares for the underground swine

As the media eye remains corrupt
Shoot those who dare to blacken the giant's name

Where echoes gather
As the media turns its crippled eye
Where echoes gather
Nobody cares for the children gluing their minds
Where echoes gather
As the media eye twisting the truth
Where echoes gather
Shoot those who dare to blacken the giant's name

They are recycled
A product of a nation in free-fall demise

A warning!
Free-fall demise

Here they cope
Among drinkers and beggars
Lining up in the morning rush
Along with the urban sheep

Here they live
Through hate and despair
Like a drifter ignoring the pain
While the giant so peacefully sleeps

I lived their life
Felt the pain
Crawled with the worms
A "friendly" stab in the back
If you ever reveal your generous heart

Here where the old echoes roam
Under a giant so unconscious in sleep
What's hiding beneath the surface breathe

Here where nameless faces live
Wasted youths in hate and despair
They hammer the pipes for a warning to chime

Where echoes gather
As the media turns its crippled eye
Where echoes gather
Nobody cares for the underground swine
Where echoes gather
As the media eye twisting the truth
Where echoes gather
Shoot those who dare to blacken the giant's name

They are recycled
A product of a nation in free-fall demise
