Download your new soul
Useless fragments are stored
In this vault of blood money
Envy and greed

Drawn into the web
Woven by an electric demon
Disengage the connection
Utopian dream

Searching through time
Puzzles of mind
Fading light dims the sight from my eyes
Throwing the dice... disguise the divine
Masses decay, piles of waste left astray

Feel, the networked vibration
The pulse of the Earth
Each life holds a pattern
And these patterns are infinite
Frozen and stored in time
Cryonics fragments of life
Through ancient spectral eyes
The DNA puzzles our mind

The wave disperse and I was drawn
Into these flickering screens
That still feed my eyes with fear
And connect to my emotional codex
Hooked up to the core of the magnetic sphere

The wave disperse and I was drawn
At the center of the Earth
I was blinded by fear
Into these flickering screens
Drawn into these flickering screens
That still feed my eyes with fear
And connect to my emotional codex
Now I am at the core of the
Magnetic center of the Earth
Now I am at the core of the
Magnetic center of the Earth
