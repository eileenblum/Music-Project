It looks like every star
Has a friend close by it's side
But the reality distance between
Is unimaginable far away...

Shining on our heaven bow
Surrounded by friends
or maybe all alone
Alone precise like me
Precise like me, a fragile soul
With the attraction to the moon
hanging high above,
Far out of reach

From birth of time
Grand major design
That no one can explain
Nature's so divine
I am the one
My time has come

Moondance
A ghostly rhyme playing my mind
Moondance
Hypnotized by it's beauty in light

It reflects on my broken dream
Of being alongside with my star
And I'll play the rhyme
For all Earths folks to hear

Reach your hand out
Imagine you could almost touch
While our father the moon
Is on his monthly voyage

On his return
The heaven sparks dance
While I ... a tiny Earth soul
Gaze at their dance...
Casting their glance...
Down on me

Escape into my private space
Where I can sit and watch for days
Imaginating, calculating, reality or dream
It's unimaginable far away...

Shining on our heaven bow
Surrounded by friends
or maybe all alone
Alone precise like me
Precise like me, waiting to see
My lost star that once held in my hands
Endless sleep
Far out of reach

Never to return
These memories burned
A monument in time
Deliverance of the mind
Dissolve flesh, blood and bones
You are all and the above

Moondance
A ghostly rhyme playing my mind
Moondance
Hypnotized by it's beauty in light

It reflects on my broken dream
Of being alongside with my star
And I'll play the rhyme
For all Earths folks to hear

Moondance
A ghostly rhyme playing my mind
Moondance
Hypnotized by it's beauty in light
Moondance
A ghostly rhyme playing my mind
Moondance
Hypnotized by it's beauty in light

It reflects on my broken dream
Of being alongside with my star
And I'll play the rhyme
For all Earths folks to hear
