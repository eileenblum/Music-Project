A part of a game
From the day we were born
Brought into this world
Naked and forlorn

I will not break down
Confronting masses of joining
I clearly see a pattern
Is this infinite?

Searching through time
Puzzles of mind
Fading light dims the sight from my eyes
Throwing the dice... disguise the divine
Masses decay, piles of waste left astray

Feel, the networked vibration
The pulse of the Earth
Each life holds a pattern
And these patterns are infinite
Frozen and stored in time
Cryonics fragments of life
Through ancient spectral eyes
The DNA puzzles our mind

The wave disperse and I was drawn
Into these flickering screens
That still feed my eyes with fear
And connect to my emotional codex
Hooked up to the core of the magnetic sphere

The wave disperse and I was drawn
Into these flickering screens
That still feed my eyes with fear
And connect to my emotional codex
Hooked up to the core
Of the magnetic center of the Earth
