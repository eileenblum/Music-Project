Breed - a new way of life
Clones from a fading world
Engaged in war - for the soil we walk
No cure as we wipe all clues
From the spirit of all ancient gods
Still breaths but the string is weak
If it bleeds, it can be killed
Solve, this puzzle that once was complete...

Diving deep into my mindware
Tempting to see the reality in here
Mass brain control by an unknown force
Losing control
Into the hands of unknown

Everywhere I turn
I see their shadows
Everywhere I turn
I see shadows

Everywhere I turn - I see their shadows
Waving it high, their black flag of hate
Everywhere I turn - I see their shadows
Waving it high, their black flag of hate

Everywhere I turn
I see their shadows
Everywhere I turn
I see shadows

Tracking all movements
I know they are watching me
Spreading deceases
With their plague of religious hate
Schizophrenic they call me
But this is reality
Fake smile encounters acts like cheating hoax

Diving deep into my mindware
Tempting to see the reality in here
Mass brain control by an unknown force
Losing control
Into the hands of unknown

Breed - a new way of life
Clones from a fading world
Engaged in war - for the soil we walk
No cure as we wipe all clues
From the spirit of all ancient gods
Still breaths but the string is weak
If it bleeds, it can be killed
Solve, this puzzle that once was complete...

Everywhere I turn
I see their shadows
Everywhere I turn
I see shadows

Everywhere I turn - I see their shadows
Waving it high, their black flag of hate
Everywhere I turn - I see their shadows
Waving it high, their black flag of hate

Everywhere I turn - I see their shadows
Waving it high, their black flag of hate
Everywhere I turn - I see their shadows
Waving it high, their black flag of hate

The black
The black
The black
Flag of hate...
