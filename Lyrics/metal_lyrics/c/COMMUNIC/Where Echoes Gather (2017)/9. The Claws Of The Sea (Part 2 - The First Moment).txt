Deep in the eye of the storm
On the surface to the unknown
Holding on through the endless pain
On my journey into the source
I'm searching for the embrace
In the eye of the storm, the centre cone
Here I felt this uplifting stream
At my arrival - at the source

The first moment
They were all brave men
The first moment
Sleeps in the endless ocean...
The first moment
They were all brave men
The first moment
Sleeps in the endless ocean...

Deep in the eye of the storm
On the surface to the unknown
A grasp of air the horizon breach
I was spinning spinning through eternity...
Beyond the circle of Equator
I found the truth to the unknown
I found the life giving stream
I found - the source

The first moment
They were all brave men
The first moment
Now they sleep in the endless ocean...

As this man's journey into himself
There is no return
From the claws of the sea
So alluring...
So deep, plumbless
Deeper... than all life itself

In a pasture of circles
I feel it's warm ember colours
Then a bright light surrounds me
Like an aura of energy
Then the waves wash over me
As darkness falls
My body is numb
As my eyes have gone blind

Waves wash over me as darkness falls
My body is numb - eyes gone blind
Many lost in the darkest sea
The first moment...

Is this bringer of light here to set me free?
Am I in an angel's shielding embrace
Or in the deepest grip of the Devil's jaw
The first moment, is the beginning
