The siren veils and I'm driven
Through the fresh smells that linger
Beyond the event that is rising
Spinning through eternity...

Waves wash over me as darkness falls
My body is numb - eyes gone blind
Many lost in the darkest sea
The first moment...

Deep in the eye of the storm
On the surface to the unknown
Holding on through the endless pain
On my journey into the source

In a pasture of circles
I feel it's warm ember colours
Then a bright light surrounds me
Like an aura of energy
Then the waves wash over me
As darkness falls
My body is numb
As my eyes have gone blind

Into the wake of the storm
All I knew flowed into drowning
We all shared the hopes for the season
Sinking into damnation

Waves wash over me as darkness falls
My body is numb - eyes gone blind
Many lost in the darkest sea
The first moment...

Deep in the eye of the storm
On the surface to the unknown
Holding on through the endless pain
On my journey into the source

The eye...
In the pasture of circles so bold
I see it's breathtaking colours
The loss of air shuts down my brain

As the force of gravity cease to exist

As the circles approach from beneath
Deep in the abyss of fear
In a battle of unknowing
And a brawl of terror
Betrayed by these illusions of life

Behold as this entity touch your sleep
Don't regret, you are in for a treat
Listening to a quire of clown-looking thieves
Sleepwalkers in search of urgent belief

Beware it claims your sins
To lure you in
Here, take this apple so sour and sweet
If fell down, not far from the tree
As the temptress from the deep
Pulls your underneath

Surrounded by a quire of waves

In a hunt for the origin of the beast
I was dead, but called back to life
By the stalker of the shadow
That summons all terror

Betrayed by these illusions of life
