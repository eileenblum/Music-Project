Do you think they could have a secret agenda
An iron hand over the last remains of humanity
The final breath of life, allusions of the end
Are we all part of this scheme?
Another coin in payment for your soul
Another bone in the lifegiving soil

Reincarnated - as spawns of the darkness

All we crave to passes will leave a hole into deep
As payment to exist they lost their soul

Bones buried beneath
We are ... slaves of creation
Reincarnated, a revolution
We are ... merged into perfect form
Regeneration came with a steep price

Into a realm of wealth and comfort
How can we even resist this claim
A manifestation of a perfect empire (your kingdom come)
Where pain and disgrace are absent

Do you think they could have a secret agenda
Protect the nation, with hidden intentions, for reasons why?
One day when the devil calls your name
And when he does you will think of me
Another coin in payment for your soul
Another bone in the lifegiving soil

As modern Gods claim sacrifice
The flames will feed on the doomed
Vested interest controls the flow
Transaction on the wire

All we crave to passes will leave a hole into deep
As payment to exist they lost their soul

Bones buried beneath
We are ... merged into perfect form
Regeneration came with a steep price

Reincarnated - as spawns of the darkness
Reincarnated ...
... Regeneration [x2]
