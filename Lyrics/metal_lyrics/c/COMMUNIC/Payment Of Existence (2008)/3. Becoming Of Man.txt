In a capsule it came
Bellicose as it is
It infected the system
To build a new day

Silently it resists
Waiting as an embryo
The perfect moment to infect
To build it up more superior
A superior becoming

Inside this void it feeds
A conception of the ideal structure
Contained in the flesh
A fountainhead of the rise

Hear my becoming
For I will be...
Hear my becoming
For I will be...

A mutant of the new world [x4]

On this depraved orb I'm wandering
I see others like me
Have we all been transformed?
By this strange lunar halo

No! - The carrier now I am
No! - Of this unearthly syndrome

The carrier now I am
Of this unearthly syndrome
That tears my body down
To recreate the master plan

As I wander the fields of abode
A grey and old man I've become
The birds won't sing anymore
To fragments of dust I dissolve
Crumble to dust
Becoming of man

Hear my becoming
For I will be...
Hear my becoming
For I will be...

A mutant of the new world [x4]

On this depraved orb I'm wandering
I see others like me
Have we all been transformed?
By this strange lunar halo

On this hideous orb I'm wandering
I see others like me
Have we all been transformed?
By this strange lunar halo

No! - The carrier now I am
No! - Of this unearthly syndrome

Locked down as in the capsule it came
All traces of life has been erased
In frozen sleep I seek forgiveness
For my sins have not been paid

Will
I
Ever
Be
Reborn?
