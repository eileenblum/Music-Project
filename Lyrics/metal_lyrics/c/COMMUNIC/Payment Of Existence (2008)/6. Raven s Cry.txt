Last night I had a dream
About the existence to it all
Vague visions in the black of night
Made by shiver, made me reconsider

That night I had a dream
About a raven so black and glimmer
It came to me in the dead of night
The raven's cry, a cold, soulful need

In the black of the night
The raven of darkness
In the black of the night
Then it all faded away

I fear I woke, so many thoughts
What we inherit, when will we perish
Need to change for those who come
Our existence, the final extinction
The final extinction

Lost a loved one, we know time will come
Gave birth to my own special one
Pick a number, stay in line
I'll give you strength, for you to light the way

In the black of the night
The raven of darkness
In the black of the night
Unfledged but still divine

We all know there is a price to pay
Time will come where it all will fail
A shelter in Heaven for those who pray?
Birth, life, and then will come death!

Eyes of silver reflect the last breath
I see generations fall
Admire it now before the last remains fade
We will cause human's empire to fall
Empire to fall!

Born - sanctuary denied
Forlorn - mesmerized in fear

Behold the raven's cry
Black wings bringer of pain
Behold the raven's cry
Through its silver eyes I saw the fall

In the black of the night
The raven of darkness
In the black of the night
The raven of darkness
In the black of the night
Hear the raven's cry
