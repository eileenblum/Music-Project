Along the fragile edge of darkness
Down to chaos seething below
Rise in the grace of moonlight
The stranger came in the night

I've been waiting for so long now...

Hungry as the sea
Turbulent as the storm
Deepest eyes of mystery shine
A guiding light sent for me

I've been a trader of so much pain
Now a harvester of life

All are born as barren souls
To a life free of all sins
A place where evil awaits for those
The labyrinth of years must go

Time has come to cleanse the soul
Our home far behind the sun
A place to plant the eternal seed
As fragile as roses you'll grow

I've been lower than so called Hell
Been used, and I've been scorned
I used to count myself as one
Into million stars I've become

I've been a trader of so much pain
Now a harvester of life

Time has come to cleanse the soul
Our home far behind the sun
A place to plant the eternal seed
So fragile...

Time has come to cleanse the soul
Our home far behind the sun
A place to plant the eternal seed
As fragile as roses you'll grow

Your ship can never sail
Without a proper wind in its sails
This wind you now will feel
Coming strong
And it will never leave you
Abandoned ashore
As long as my name remains
There will always be a safe port of call [x2]

All are born as barren souls
To a life free of all sins
A place where evil awaits for those
The labyrinth of years must go

Time has come to cleanse the soul
Our home far behind the sun
A place to plant the eternal seed
So fragile...

Time has come to cleanse the soul
Our home far behind the sun
A place to plant the eternal seed
As fragile as roses you'll grow

You'll grow...

I've been a trader of so much pain
I've been waiting for so long now
I've been a trader of so much pain
Now a harvester of life
