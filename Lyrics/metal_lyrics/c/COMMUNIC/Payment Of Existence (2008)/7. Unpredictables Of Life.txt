Two leafs linked by blood
Drifting away from the tree
Will they ever be able to
Take control of their own existence

With different prosperity
They enter the world alone
Equal but so unlike
Leaving home in their own direction

Stripped down to the concrete
Wet, cold and alone
Neon lights, addicted
Definition of home... so material

Some are born into wealth and prosperity
All you need, for riding "the gravy train"
Struck by power
Pouring another liquid fire

As second fly a storm arise
In this unpredictable life
Set in control of your inner demons
In memories vague, loosing fate
In this unpredictable life
Set in control of your inner demons
Act of fate

Do you think I care?
It has always been Me, Myself and I
Even a stray dog will be my friend
Before I reach your level

Don't put me down, please leave me alone
We were both born with nothing
Why am I the family's black sheep

Stripped down to the concrete
Wet, cold and alone
Neon lights, addicted
We are all...

Material - Scorn
Material - Hate
Material - Waste
Material - World
Material - Terror
Material - Pain

How can it be, I want to conceive
Don't give my sympathy, ignore me
Worthless life, while someone sits up high
Don't moralize, ignore me rather

Stripped down to the concrete
Wet, cold and alone
Neon lights, addicted
Definition of home... so material

Some are brought into life as society's waste
A cess-pool of trash that we all tend to forget
Struck by the power
Pouring another liquid fire

As second fly a storm arise
In this unpredictable life
Set in control of your inner demons
In memories vague, loosing fate
In this unpredictable life
Set in control of your inner demons

As second fly a storm arise
In this unpredictable life
Set in control of your inner demons
In memories vague, loosing fate
In this unpredictable life
Set in control of your inner demons
Act of fate

Material - Scorn
Material - Hate
Material - Waste
Material - World
Material - Terror
Material - Pain
