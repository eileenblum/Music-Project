On this ground, where ancient spirits once were summoned
It's said to hold the way to salvation

Demanding chaos, for the unknown times ahead
Where the eldest gathered for sights of the future
Preparing the ritual

...sacrifice [x4]
How can they resist these gifts that we give
Our most valuable possesion
Behind masked eyes, material claims
Was not a price high enough for this ...sacrifice

In search for better times, adorn gifts from virgin hands
Should be the price to the angelic hoast

Around center stone, they all made the final choice
Prosperity in exchange for blood

On ancient ground - They paid the price [x2]

Sacrificial rites, blueprint for eternal life
As the phenom would gather the clouds

Pleasure the Gods, then harvest salvation
Awaiting the feast of the Hunter's Moon

On ancient ground - They paid the price
On ancient ground - Awaiting the harvest

As the eldest rise, they gathered by
Giving their pray to the ancient ground
A sacrifice, for better times
In order to please the ancient ground
Most precious gifts, they could ever give
To the feast of Gods on ancient ground
They gazed in awe, while soil sucked dry
As the impassive stonehead, demanded more!

Circle of stones, in perfect alignments with the stars
With a gift of life, a passage to the otherworld

Within the enclosure, shines the eye on the altar stone
An instrument to read the signs of the moon
Preparing ritual

...sacrifice [x4]
How can they resist these gifts that we give
Our most valuable possesion
Behind masked eyes, material claims
Was not a price high enough for this ...sacrifice

On ancient ground - They paid the price
On ancient ground - Awaiting the harvest

...as the impassive stonehead, demanded more!
...sacrifice [x4]
