In solitude, looking into the flame that burns
Alongside with your memory
Desolation, a picture of my fallen star
A broken branch in my family tree
In my family tree

I raise my head, now defying this obvious truth
That night came and our heaven turned to Hell
That night came and our heaven turned to Hell
Our heaven turned to Hell

Drowning hope, remembering all the pain
Fear of loosing memories in the daily haze
It was the time we should fill with laughter
Of our newly arriving joy

The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue, cutting through the view
A message of death, that no one could foresee
Inside this hall, waiting for the fall, waiting for the fall...

My fallen
May not live to roam this earth
My fallen
Changed my life forever
My fallen
Left a mark inside so sore
My fallen
Only solitude within my core

The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue, cutting through the view
A message of death, that no one could foresee
Inside this hall, waiting for the fall, waiting for the fall

How many dreams, I have chased on my road
I don't feel for anything anymore
All just fragments of disposable waste
A cesspool of terror, displaying hate

I have to face the day, still denying this obvious truth
That night came and our heaven turned to Hell
Our heaven turned to Hell...to Hell..

My fallen
May not live to roam this earth
My fallen
Changed my life forever
My fallen
Left a mark inside so sore
My fallen
Only solitude within my core

The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue, cutting through the view
A message of death, that no one could foresee
Inside this hall, waiting for the fall...the fall
