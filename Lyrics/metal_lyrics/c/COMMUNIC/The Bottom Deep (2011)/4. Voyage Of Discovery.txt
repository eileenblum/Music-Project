Do you know this pain?
From the first sting in your heart - Forlorn...
All the ideas in your head
All the ideas in my head

What can you do about it
Try to hide behind the grace - All this noise...
All these crazy images in your head
All these crazy images in my head
All the ideas in my head

In blur distance, no future ahead
My world crash into pieces
It seems like old memories
From one life to another
Lines spinning in my head
Feelings that I can't remember
What happened, where did they go
These feelings that I can't remember

Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up, give us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up, give us hope
It gives us hope

Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up, give us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up, give us hope

Here on my weekly down trip
On a voyage of discovery - On display, like a freak show
While these crazy people are watching me
While these crazy people are watching me

As a deeper state of coma
A prescription from an unknown hand
Drifting into the drug
Injected to secure my ideas
Injected to secure my memories
All these crazy images in my head

Bloodlines left behind
Bones buried, hidden by earth
Life takes mysterious ways
In a blink of an eye, all twisted around
Burn my skin, pull out my nails
It won't heal, invisible scars inside
Bad luck, get your act together
Leaving, destination unknown

Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up, give us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up, give us hope
It gives us hope
