I'm lost with fever
Drifting into this psycho-sphere
I wish the stars could tell me
Is this it, my last breath...all alone

I'm a master of denial
Don't even try to convince me
Am I conscious or lost
Could this be my final day...here on earth

I'm taking a leap of fate
Never to look back, or loose control
I'm beyond despair, in silence with my scars

I'm falling - loosing control
I'm falling - a desecrator

I'm lost with fever
This task called life I failed
I hear an echo from the unknown
I cannot exclude these cynical ideas

I'm taking a leap of fate
Never to look back, or loose control
I'm beyond despair, in silence with my scars

I'm falling - without control
I'm falling - a desecrator

I hear an echo from the past
I cannot exclude these cynical ideas
I'm heading into the unknown
All my fears are now at peace...all alone

I'm taking a leap of fate
Never to look back, or loose control
I'm beyond despair, in silence with my scars

I'm falling - loosing control
I'm falling - a desecrator

I'm leaving this planet earth
I'm leaving
