[Bonus Track][originally by Overkill]From the islands to the cities,
From the ports into the sea.
We are strong, we will always be...
Blazing through the wreckage, burning all we see...
The life we lead committed to be free...
Our union is a fortress!
Together we are bound.
A common bound in freedom and in sound!
So raise your voices high!
For miles around to hear.
Let them know we are drawing near...

[2x]
In union we stand as they blaze across the land!
In union we make a final stand.

A peaceful co-existence is dropping out of sight.
So band together, together we will fight.
Blasting the resistance, marching to the top.
They started this, we say when it stops.
Strike fear within their hearts!
Strike down those in your way.
Let them know that we live today!
They throw us into flames,
Did not hear our cries.
But now from the ashes we arise...

In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand

[Solo]

In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand

Our union is our fortress
Together we are bound
A common bound in freedom and in sound
So raise your voices high
For miles around to hear
Let them know we are drawing near

[2x]
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
