Our time was short
But unbreakable bonds in a flood of blood
This link to the past
Is forever a totem in my life

This place that we visit
Our secret that we groom and cherish
This pain I don't want to forget
Always a peace within me

Through sleepless nights
Cold-hearted facts of life
The meaning of it all so unfair
This ride I did not foresee

Flood River Blood
No time to waste
There was nobody there that could save you
Nobody there to help me

Flood River Blood
With power to breathe life
If there was a God he would have saved you
But now I have lost my belief

This token of love
All I have within my heart will be remembered
Your skin so cold
So cold, a touch so hard to explain

I have now found peace
A conclusion to where we inherit from
We can't rule over life
Down into the earth we will follow

Through sleepless nights
Cold-hearted facts of life
The meaning of it all so unfair
This ride I did not foresee

Flood River Blood
No time to waste
There was nobody there that could save you
Nobody there to help me

Flood River Blood
With power to breathe life
If there was a God he would have saved you
But now I have lost my belief

There is nothing here that can take me lower
Lower than this place I've already seen
"Take pride in what's in your heart, take advantage of this trial"

Through sleepless nights
Cold-hearted facts of life
The meaning of it all so unfair
This ride I did not foresee

Flood River Blood
No time to waste
There was nobody there that could save you
Nobody there to help me

Flood River Blood
With power to breathe life
If there was a God he would have saved you
But now I have lost my belief
