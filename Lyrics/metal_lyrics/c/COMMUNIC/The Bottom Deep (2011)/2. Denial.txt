A deathlike silence sweeping the land
Murderer, a feeling of blame, feeding this sinister kiss
A room filled with the smell of death and decay
Anger wash over me as memories stir my mind

My body is numb, agonized and blind
These strange calls, from those who walked before their time

Spinning through emotional fields
I turned the nails, that closed this crest of belief

Once I surely tasted paradise
But now I weep
Will I ever see this paradise unveil
I will be searching for all my years

Strangely waiting among the shadow of the stones
I now feel connected while in your garden
Is there a king of vengeance who roams to punish me
Inside it feels, like a battle between good and evil

An internal storm that hates me
And this storm always outlasts me

I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish I could believe...
I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish, we could meet again

Welcome to my world of denial
Welcome to the realm of the lost
Come, feel the stillness of my garden
Where my blood has soaked the ground

Once I surely tasted paradise
But now I weep
Will I ever see this paradise unveil
I will be searching for all my years

I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish I could believe...
I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish - we could meet again

I will be searching for all my years
