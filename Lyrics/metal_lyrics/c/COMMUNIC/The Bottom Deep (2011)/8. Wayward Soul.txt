The earth has swallowed my pride
There is no need to believe
This God has left me anyway
A wayward soul - At the edge of the world

With a one way ticket - To the bottom deep
With a one way ticket - To the bottom deep
The deep!..Come follow...into the deep...

The earth has swallowed my pride
There is no need to believe
This God has left me anyway
A wayward soul
At the edge of the world

With a one way ticket - To the bottom deep
With a one way ticket - To the bottom deep
A Wayward soul, a wayward soul...

This image of a vulture's head
Casting a shadow resembling death
Waiting, while he listens to your breath
Its beak ready to pick up your flesh

An image of a livid face
Exposed over a stormy sky
I try to reach, but it fades away
Drifting on while I still search

This trauma triggers my thoughts
You are the one that I owe
For the influence of my return
The vague shape of better things to come

At gunpoint I could shimmer
What if life that really matters
All these thoughts I put into form
Will there be light on the other side?

Time still tearing on me
A downward spiral that bleeds

Lost in the barren part of my mind
These tears still bleed within
In silence you speak to me
Please wait for me at the edge of the world

With a one way ticket - To the bottom deep
With a one way ticket - To the bottom deep

In silence you speak to me
You speak to me
Please, wait for me
Please, wait for me
At the edge of the world
