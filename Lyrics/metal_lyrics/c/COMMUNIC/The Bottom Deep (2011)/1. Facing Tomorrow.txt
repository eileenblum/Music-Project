Silent cries echo in this peaceful place
Eyes closed, nothing more to say
In the finest crest of ebony
A familiar name carved in ivory

I will forever owe my first one
For grabbing me, needing me, returning me
Facing tomorrow

We walked through halls of pain, holding close
Earth Mother and this father, earthbound together
We brought the memories home, holding close
Earth Mother and this father, earthbound forever

The earth now treasure my deprived
Once soft and pale, these memories stain
Underneath this stone a truth so cruel
All so divine the scavenger awaits its prey

This burden of grief pulling in me
So much colder and with no relief
Will your deeds make the scale sway the right way
The truth to it all revealed...

This hopeless life I led, my own blood I let shed
My body so weak and sore, waiting to be decomposed
Overwhelmed by this tragedy
Wrapped up in harmony
Close your eyes, no more will to be
As nature is delivering me

This burden of grief pulling in me
So much colder and with no relief
Will your deeds make the scale sway the right way
The truth to it all revealed...

Here in this garden of memories, I have searched for some clues to life
Feedback from those resting so wise, I wish they could tell me, it's all a lie

I believed in a life so delight, I'm so crestfallen, by the truth so cold
After the storm there will be light, but right now, I don't want to arise
I believed in a life so delight, I'm so crestfallen, by the truth so cold
After the storm there will be light, but right now, I don't want to arise

We walked through halls of pain, holding close
Earth Mother and this father, earthbound together
We brought the memories home, holding close
Earth Mother and this father, earthbound forever...
