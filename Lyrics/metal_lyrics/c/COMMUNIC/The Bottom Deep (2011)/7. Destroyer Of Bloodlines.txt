It feels like I'm locked up in this dark room behind bars
Where my mind is the cell, and this heart piece of me went missing
A shock that left me in the dark

Can I allow myself to have these feelings
Bringing me into temptation, pin down the reality
I need to toss this blame I have in my head

All my future years already planned
There was made no room for mistakes
Even if the Devil wants to lead me
Into a deeper state of doubt

Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
Am I the downfall of my heritage

This flesh I can't replace, but our soul may reunite
In a parallel world as travellers
Still I sense, this presence visiting me
A piece of me lost in a twirl of misery

While a serpent, still tries to tell me that I failed
Leaving me in a wasteland of desolation
How could I let this life slip through my hands?

All my future years already planned
There was made no room for mistakes
Even if the Devil wants to lead me
Into a deeper state of doubt

Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
I am - the downfall of my heritage

I am drifting
Into a deeper state of doubt

I am - The destroyer of my bloodline
