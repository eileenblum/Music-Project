This hovering shadow I see
It's touch of death surrounds me
No glimmer of hope in a distant sight
Memories of life
On this vision the feed
Leaving this world

The end is complete
Surely the bottom deep
Visions dark as never seen
Looking down on an empty shell
Bones left for the earth to dissolve
We have reached the end my friend

This is the end
Surely the last descend
Those who enter can never leave
As darkness swallows all light

The end is complete
Surely the bottom deep
Visions dark as never seen
Looking down on an empty shell
Bones left for the earth to dissolve
We have reached the end my friend

We have reached the end
We have reached the end
We have reached the end
This is the end
