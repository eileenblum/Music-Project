Never reveal the family secrets
Hide the rats in your basement
There's an old lady in her gray rags
Who always sleeps in the park

Nothing can ever change the past
Her eyes look like they were made of glass
But now there is no more pain to feel
This morning she was found stone cold in the park

Drawn into drugs to drain the pain
Cold with fever - deny, or face the fact

It's not that far away from here
Not that far away from where we live

A siren sounds and break the silence of the night
Minds getting black
No reconnection at all...
Destined to schedule a new meeting
Reach the human mind in the mirror
Nothing is left but the door to the soul
But you've been put on hold again...

Details revealed in the morning paper
Rumors spreading like fire in dry grass

Nothing can ever change the past
Her pale skin was torn by years in despairs
But now there is no more pain to feel
This morning she was found stone cold in the park
Destined to schedule a new meeting
Reach the human mind into the mirror - into the mirror...
Take a good look, into the eyes of the weak
Let's throw them all away, like rats in the streets

Paramedics are closing the black bag
Kids are playing, laughing in the park
No place to call home, no one even cares
There is always a dark family secret to hide

An old picture of the family queen
She didn't leave them anything
In the shadows the society feeds
Frozen asleep in the park

Drawn into drugs to drain the pain
Cold with fever - deny, or face the fact

It's not that far away from here
Not that far from where we live

The siren sounds for the 5th time this night
My mind is black
Just another night in the park
Destined to schedule a new meeting
Get another fill to keep the blanket warm
Nothing is left but the door to the soul
But you've been put on hold again..
