One morning in the silence of nature
Two shadows dance in the sunrise
Never knowing what's on the other side of the wall
What is it hiding this absence of secrets
Behind the gate to the unknown
Lying obscure behind these highest walls

What is hiding in the garden of secrets, behind the wall
Who is the creator of these illusions of lies
A brand new project Eden
Evil seeds just waiting to bloom
Someone is testing human fate

Living in this world of secrets
In an underground sphere of science
Searching for the place where all evil began
Born into this state of innocence
An Arcadia of coming future life
Reality strikes
When the two headed snake bites

Fooled by the serpent
Who took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
From the holy tree
Fooled by the serpent
Someone took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
In the garden

What is hiding in the gardens of secrets, behind the wall
Who is the creator of these illusions of lies
A brand new project Eden
Evil seeds just waiting to bloom
Someone is testing human fate

Occasional sinners
That breeds
And form new life

One day someone will go back
To the place where all evil began
Only those who pray every day will find the light
With guidance on their way
Heading back to the land behind the gate
Back to the land of all evil

I feel cold
When the night takes over
Will we ever find our peace again
We must search for another home far across the fields
Towards what tomorrow will bring
We will be strong
Together we will make it
And never be tempted by evil again
We must leave
To find our new home beyond the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk to find the light

Fooled by the serpent
Who took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
From the holy tree
Fooled by the serpent
Someone took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
In the garden

What is hiding in the gardens of secrets, behind the wall
Who is the creator of these illusions of lies
A brand new project Eden
Evil seeds just waiting to bloom
Someone is testing human fate
