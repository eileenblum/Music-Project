Face suicide at the gates
Keep your evil away
From the mother of civilization
Who have resolved to compel
Under a luminous sky...

Play the role of your holy God
To destroy for beliefs
While these subsequent uprising
Continuing until present day
Under a luminous sky...

They kill for the sake of killing
To reach a new and better reality
They kill for the sake of killing
To reach a new and better reality

A warning of the danger approaching
Those who act under illusions
Under a luminous sky...
Those who act under illusions

Those who were cuffed by beliefs
And react on destructive instincts
Worldwide parade protest blooms
Fierce fighting still rages

Those who identify themselves
In the locked dimension of the turmoil
Divisiveness so bitter sweet and so cold

Cycle of violence will never end
There is no way to verify
The door to a truce is open
But only when the last soldier leaves
But only when the last soldier leaves...

They kill for the sake of killing
To reach a new and better reality
They kill for the sake of killing
To reach a new and better reality

A warning of the danger approaching
Those who act under illusions
Under a luminous sky...
Those who act under illusions

Those who identify themselves
In the locked dimension of the turmoil
Divisiveness so bitter sweet and so cold... so cold
