Where am I now?
Have I turned blind?
Broken down
By the guilt of my killing hand

My bleeding victim
Folds her hands and prays
My bleeding victim
Folds her hands and prays

The morning rise, the sky burns red
Sheets are soaked by unknown blood and soil
Memories burn - I crawl in pain
The scene I see is becoming more surreal

Beyond the veil - stalking my prey
Beyond control - I'm on my way

Drawn into the center of the weak
Madness flares within my angry mind
Alone in this maze where voices speak
In twisted tongues that taunt for evil deeds

Beyond the veil - stalking my prey
Beyond control - unveil my pain

I feel the blood slowly flow
In a reflecting eye I see them die
Heartbeat that silently decays
Sinking deep into the Earth's hungry soil

I will return
Same face
With a new mask
Trying to hide
From the guilt
Of my killing hand

My bleeding victim
Folds her hands and prays
My bleeding victim
Folds her hands and...

....prays while the blood slowly flow
In a reflecting eye I see them die
A heartbeat that silently decays
Sinking deep into the Earth's hungry soil

Drawn into the center of the weak
Madness flares within my angry mind
Alone in this maze where voices speak
In twisted tongues that taunt for evil deeds

Beyond the veil - I'm on my way
Beyond the control - stalking my prey
Beyond the veil - I'm on my way
Beyond the control - unveil my pain
