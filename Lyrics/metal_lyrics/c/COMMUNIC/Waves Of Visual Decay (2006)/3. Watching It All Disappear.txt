I watch the tears fall down
All I see now is my pain
A pale face reflects in the mirror
Watching it all disappear
Time flows but no on calls
To see if I'm here, still waiting...

Watching it all disappear
Time has spoken
Skin fades to pale grey
Days, turn to years
Ticking... watching it all disappear

I close my eyes but I still see
The dark past that haunts my sleep
Why can't they leave me alone
I want it all to disappear - from memory...

Want it all to disappear
I still see their shapes
Shadows that can't be defined
Turning around in circles
Broken... watching it all disappear

Diving deep into forever
Trying to keep this evil away
To survive and carry on the next day
Destroy this destructive instinct

Why can't they leave me alone
Why - to live on in this empty void

WHY! WAIT! NO ONE! CARES!

Why can't they leave me alone
Why - to return for another day

Diving deep into forever
Trying to keep this evil away
To survive and carry on to the next day
Destroy this destructive instinct

Watching it all disappear
Time has spoken
Skin fades to pale grey
Days, turn to years - ticking...

....want it all to disappear
I still see their shapes
Shadows that can't be defined
Turning around in circles
Broken... watching it all disappear

Taste this fragile piece of mind
And watch it fade to grey
If I could trade this pain away
For only one day...
