The world at war, hate flows and now I'm questioning
We ask, is this the way? Do we believe?
No one's answering...

A few words may be heard
Temptation within my head
Collecting the treads of fate in a colour less 3D world
Now I'm filling up inside
A snake sleeps by my side
The news spitting words of lies transmitting waves of visual decay

Once it opened, I climbed in
Communication - wondering
Once it opened, I climbed in
Communication - wondering

Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime

Blood, flows, in the pulse
Like liquid hate we fall, as deep
In the network soil no one's wondering

Generations lost
Holy devastation to land
Crops need water to grow but eternal hatred we sow
Guns and bullets won't work
Vaporize their souls
Our land slowly rots and decay
No pride left

Once it opened, I climbed in
Communication - wondering
Once it opened, I climbed in
Communication - wondering

Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime

Deep in my inner believes I can't find any relief
Enemies in the mirror of life taking control of all resorts
Deep in my inner believes I can't find any relief
Enemies in the mirror of life taking control of all resorts

A few words may be heard
Temptation within my head
Collecting the treads of fate in a colour less 3D world
Now I'm filling up inside
A snake sleeps by my side
The news spitting words of lies transmitting waves of visual decay

Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
