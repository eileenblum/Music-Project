On the shadows line where whispers creep
From the world above to the world beneath
On waves of silver I dreamed of gold
And rang the mark where my shadow fall

Take away this illusion - hide all the lies
Show no more fear - rise with the tide

Dreamed I sailed to the mirrored edge that dragged me down to my ocean bed
And a silent shore waits with silver sand
Divide the sun - reveal my desire

Take away this illusion - hide all the lies
Show no more fear - rise with the tide

With beauty before me, beauty behind
The sun in the morning is the beauty I find
Where sky land and water reveals together
I lay my body down, in the ocean forever

The seaweeds in the ocean shall be my deathbed
Untie my hands and let my spirit free

Should I die to forgive
As colors fly
Try not to live
And paint my skin
Be with me here
To wake me up
At the ocean we are free
It stops the time

She cast her fair body, and long blond hair
And closed her hands around me
In our ocean bed
I'm caught up in this wet web she's spun
As eyes of the ocean watch our secret vow...

The seaweeds in the ocean shall be my deathbed
A silent ocean line
Awaits with silver sand
