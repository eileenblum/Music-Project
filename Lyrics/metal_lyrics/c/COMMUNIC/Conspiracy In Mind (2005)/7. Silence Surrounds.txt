To suffer when all hope is denied
Waged down by sorrow, marked by grief

To suffer when all hope is denied
Waged down by sorrow, marked by grief

A home in flames, fathomless night
Seek shelter from pain, I wish to forget...

At the edge of the world, last stand has been taken
Feeding on the enemy, with a clean shot
Deadly screams, don't reveal your presence
It's hard to ignore the blackened debris

Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice

Unthinkable days, man against man
Fighting on plains, streams of pitch and soil
The final conflict, between the remains of the world
Brother fights brother, over poisoned water

Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice

Silence surrounds, silence grows
A word so tall, brother we are close
A sleep so deep, stance wounded ear
Look at the shadows, brother we are so close to the goal

Unthinkable days, man against man
Fighting on plains, streams of pitch and soil
The final conflict, between the remains of the world
Brother fights brother, over poisoned water

At the edge of the world, man against man
Living on fear, deadly screams can be heard
A home in flames, a child left for it self's to care
Seeking shelter from pain, wishing to forget...
... to forget

Then, a strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's
Then, a strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's
A strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's
Then, a strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's

[Solo]

Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice

Watch over yourself, brother
Watch over yourself, brother
Watch over yourself, brother...
