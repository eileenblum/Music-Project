Two pieces of one kind we live our separated lives
One hundred miles are not so far away
In spite the map of our world
A planet with so many good intensions

The thunder disturbs the calm a tidal wave so strong
What can we do, when we ask our self why we try

The winter is closing in
Invisible frost tears on my skin
On the magic dreams we live, when the distance tear us apart

Like in a fairy tale we fly away into the night
And when the winter is done you'll be back in my arms

[Solo]

Like in a fairy tale we fly away into the night
And when the winter is done you'll be back in my arms
My arms... my arms...

Growing strong by being alone
Knowing that you'll soon me home
Then nothing on Earth can manage to tear us apart
And a garden in blossom will wipe the tears from our eyes
Like in a fairy tale we fly into the night

The thunder disturbs the calm a tidal wave so strong
What can we do, when we ask our self why we try

The winter is closing in
Invisible frost tears on my skin
On the magic dreams we live, when the distance tear us apart

The thunder disturbs the calm a tidal wave so strong
What can we do, when we ask our self why we try

The winter is closing in
Invisible frost tears on my skin
On the magic dreams we live, when the distance tear us apart

Like in a fairy tale we fly away into the night
