[Solo]

Always in a state of evolution
Some people try to differ from one another
To beat life's quiz is not an easy task

Hot pepper produce an unpleasant pain
Yet fools come back to feel the burn
Are we lost in the garden of hypocrisy?

Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point

All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct...
All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct...

Always in a state of evolution
Some people try to differ from one another
An unpleasant pain when we feel the burn

[Solo]

The future is set, the Earth is run by a nuclear sun
Leaders sit high, as we live like worms
The circle is closed history reversed

All we have done for you to be
The world has become what we didn't see
It's time to rise, there's no easy way out

Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point

All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct...
All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct...

Always in a state of evolution
Some people try to differ from one another
An unpleasant pain when we feel the burn

Are we lost in the garden of hypocrisy?
