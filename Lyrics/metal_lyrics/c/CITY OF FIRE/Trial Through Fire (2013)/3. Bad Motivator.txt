See the world around me
Coming to the end
Through a flash of lightning
Gods are thundering

A storm of fears is coming
City's in disarray
Everybody must run for cover
Hellfire is going to rain

There is no sun in the sky
Blinding my eyes
Warming the blood in my veins
There is no sun in the sky
Blinding my eyes
Warming my blood

Oh, stay with me
The world is coming down
The end is coming
Please, stay with me
The world is coming down
Why don't you stay with me?

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Rays of change are rolling
Too late for higher ground
Everybody must run for cover
Act of god is coming down

Why don't we reach for the sky? 
Just you and I
In the chaos surrounding us
Why don't we reach for the sky?
Just you and I
In the chaos surrounding us

Oh, stay with me
Please, stay with me
Oh, stay with me
The world is coming down
The end is coming
Please, stay with me
The world is coming down
Why don't you stay with me?

Oh-oh-oh-oh (Stay with me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, stay with me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
