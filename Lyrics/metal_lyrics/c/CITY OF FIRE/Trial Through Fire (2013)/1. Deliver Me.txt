I can't seem to get some rest
To struggle through life I guess
Deliver me (deliver me)
Deliver me (deliver me)

Life beats me with every breath
Unconscious and left for dead
Karma will not give me rest
Suffering is life's intent

Deliver me
Deliver me
Deliver me
Deliver me

I can see my end is near
Death becoming crystal clear
Sick and gone ever deeper
And in darkness my redeemer

Darkness deliver me
Darkness deliver me (I'm in misery)
Darkness deliver me
I'm in misery

I just want to be set free!

I can see the ghost of man
Stuck and young the ghost of me

I just want to be still set me free
Take me from this life full of misery

Darkness deliver me
Darkness deliver me (I'm in misery)
Darkness deliver me
I'm in misery

Deliver me
Deliver me
Deliver me
