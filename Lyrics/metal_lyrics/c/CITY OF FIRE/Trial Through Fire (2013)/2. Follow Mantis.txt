I looked into the eyes of the messenger
The prophet came to me as my heart injured
He said, "Let your spirit guide you,
Let your destiny entwine you."

The forest is from the infinite

The mantis
He showed me the way
The mantis
He showed me the way

I know, I can't feel the fables of the sky
An everlasting Universe will not tile
So, let spirit fly through
It's only me to guide you

Follow the mantis
He'll show you the way
My will is gushing
It took me away

Follow the mantis
He'll show you the way
I am insane

Follow mantis
Follow mantis 
Follow mantis 
Follow mantis

Inside his eyes I feel eternity
Inside his eyes

Ah!

The poisoned eternity
Prevails of destiny

Follow mantis, follow
In his eyes we'll find
Follow mantis, follow
In his eyes
The poisoned eternity
Prevails of destiny, destiny, destinyâ¦
