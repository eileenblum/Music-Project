I know what you're going through tonight
Your heart is hurting inside
The path you walk
Leading you here in life
It never ends,
But you will see it

In midnight skies
I see truth in the lie
I stargaze to see
I stargaze to be at peace

Anything can happen in life
Rejoicing time are wither in winter and die
It never ends,
But you will see

In midnight skies
I see truth in the lie
Stargaze with me
Stargaze to be at peace

With myself, in peace
I move on, at peace
The past is gone
You want peace

In midnight skies
I see truth in the lie
We stargaze to see
We stargaze to be

In midnight skies
I see truth in the lie
We stargaze to see
Yes, we stargaze
