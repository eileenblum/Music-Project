Your eyes are thunderclouds and rain
You wash it all away with the pain
When you're raining down
You bring me down
Please bring me down again
Please bring me down again

Your sorrow carries your dead weight
You lay it on me with your grace
When you lay it down
You bring me down
Please bring me down again
Please bring me down again

Oh-uh

(Breathingâ¦)
You're breathing the life out of me
(Breathingâ¦)
You're breathing the life out of me

Yeah!

Your heart eclipses like the sun
You cast a shadow on our love
When your heart sets down
You bring me down
Please bring me down again
Please bring me down again

Down again [14x]
