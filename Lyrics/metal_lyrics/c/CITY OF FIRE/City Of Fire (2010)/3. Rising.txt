Burning the bridges of tears
Between you and I
Standing in an endless fog
And fire burning the night

Rise, rise

Like the smoke rising from ashes
The ashes that scar our fate
Between us, between us, between us, between us

Like the smoke rising from ashes
The ashes that scar our fate
Standing on the bridge of tears
Burning...

Rise, rise

Like the smoke rising from ashes
The ashes that scar our fate
The fire is rising, the fire is rising, the fire is rising, the fire is rising
Between us, between us
