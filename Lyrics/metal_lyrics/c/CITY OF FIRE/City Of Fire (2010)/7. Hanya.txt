The mask you wear to lie to me [x4]
Oh, oh
The mask you wear to lie to me [x2]
Ha-uh

Why risk everything for one woman?
Why risk everything for one woman?
The same eyes
The same skin
The same touch you tempt me with
The same mouth
The same sin
The same curse you tempt me with, ah-uh

The world is only one, only one woman
The world is only one, only one woman
The same eyes
The same skin
The same touch you tempt me with
The same mouth
The same sin
The same curse you tempt me with
Woman...

Uh-uh, uh-uh

The mask you wear to lie to me
The mask of your deceit
Woman, woman, woman, woman

Oh!

Why risk everything for one woman?
The world is only one, only one woman
The same eyes
The same skin
The same touch you tempt me with
The same mouth
The same sin
The same curse you tempt me with
Woman, woman

Get away from me!
