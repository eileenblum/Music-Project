Hot sticky scenes, you know what I mean
Like a desert sun that burns my skin
Iâve been waiting for her for so long
Open the sky and let her come down

Here comes the rain
Here comes the rain
Here she comes again
Here comes the rain

Hot sticky scenes, you know what I mean
(Iâve been waiting for her for so long)
Like a desert sun that burns my skin (and let her come down)
Iâve been waiting for her for so long (here comes the rain)
Open the sky and let her come down

Here comes the rain
Oh, here comes the rain
Here she comes again
Oh, here comes the rain

Well, I love the rain
Well, I love the rain
Here she comes again
Here comes the rain

Oh, rain
Oh, rain
Oh, rain
Oh, here comes the rain

Well, I love the rain (I love the rain)
Well, I love the rain (I love the rain)
Here she comes again (I love the rain)
Well, I love the rain (I love the rain)

Oh, rain
Oh, rain
Oh, rain
Oh, rain
