[Spoken in reverse:]
Sigh sipping to the check off

When I'm down
It is the world that is weighing on me
When I'm down
I am in darkness without your love
My heart feels the weight
When you slip away
I surround myself with pictures of you
When I turned my head you were gone, you were gone
My setting sun
You are gone
When I feel sorrow
When I feel down
Falling through life without you...

My heart aches
You left and took the best part of me
My heart aches
It is my loneliness that I forsake
Tears fill up me eyes
My soul wants to die
Every dream I have I always see you
When I am awake you are gone, you are gone
My restless one
You are gone
When I feel sorrow
When I feel down
When I feel broken
I'm on the ground without you, without you, without you, without you

All I have is a picture of you
All I have is a memory
