Dark tides wash away
The silence of my days
Dark tides wash away
The sands of time spill away

Like the birds fly away
As the stars at night fade away, fade away, fade away

Dark tides wash away
Like falling dust in my grave
Dark tides wash away
The troubles of my day

Like the birds, they fly away
Like stars fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
