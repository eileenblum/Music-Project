[Bonus Track]I can hear you breathing
My name on your last breath

You take all that you desire from me
All that I am, my hopes and my dream
A single breath can revive a life
A single breath I have stolen from time

I know what youâre thinking right now
I know what youâre thinking right now!
I know
I know
I know
(I) 
(I) I wanna know what youâre thinking,
(Iâ¦)

In your darkest time
Love is on your mind
Your everlasting wish comes true, true
For you!

All your life you have dreamed of finding love
All your life you have dreamed of finding love right now!

I can hear you breathing (I know)
My name on your last breath (I know, I know)
I can hear you screaming (I know, I know)
My name on your last breath (I know, I know)

I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you, hear you
