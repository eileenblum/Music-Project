Quiet desperation drives me
The source of my dread and unease
Driving to see you
Ghost that haunts me now
Driving to see you
Love of dust and sand

Tasted my lover, wasted my day
Heartfelt in my loss and decay
Driving to see you
Ghost that haunts me now
Driving to see you
Love of dust and sand
Hold me closely
Hold me in your hand
Hold me closely
In these hollow land

Lost in her thoughts, I was in Hell
In my conflict I saw it so well
Driving to see you
Ghost that haunts me now
Driving to see you
Love of dust and sand
Hold me closely
Hold me in your hand
Hold me closely
In these hollow land

Touch meâ¦
