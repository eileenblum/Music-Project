[Bonus Track]Dark tides wash away
The silence of my days
Dark tides wash away
The sands of time spill away

Like the birds, they fly away
Stars at night fade away, fade away, fade away

Oh!

Dark tides wash away
Falling dust in my grave
Dark tides wash away
Troubles of my day

Like the birds, they fly away
Stars at night fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
