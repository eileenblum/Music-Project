[Bonus Track][originally by T-Rex]Yeah!

Well you can bump and grind
If it's good for your mind
Well you can scream and shout
Let it all hang out

No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't.

Well you can tear a plane
In the driving rain
I drive a Rolls Royce
'Cause it's good for my voice

No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't.

Ho!

Ho!

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na

No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't!

Thatâs right!
