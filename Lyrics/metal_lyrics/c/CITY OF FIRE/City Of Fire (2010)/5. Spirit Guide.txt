A spirit guide will lead to no where
Nothing but shadows in the freezing air
A spirit guide will lead to no one
Remember the heart that holds your love, yeah

Oh!

I see shadows of the morning sun
Like the crows that fly in murder
I see shadows of the lost souls
Like black birds that fly and murder now

God cursed me till i choked
Feeling so alone I could scream
God cursed me till I choked
Feeling so aloneâ¦

Walking beside me...
(No one wants to stay too long) [4x]
No one, no one, no one, no one who can

A fear of God will lead to no where
Lost in shadows of the rising sun
A fear of God will lead to no where
Lost in shadows, shadows, shadows
