Cast my name into your shadow
Carve your name in my heart
Cut it deep
Make it bleed

(Ah!)

(What is loveâ¦)
What is love without pain?
Empty heart
What is love without pain?
Torn apart

Carve your name
Cut it deep
Make it bleed

Cast my name into your shadow
Carve your name in my heart

No one ever will, no one ever will
No one ever will believe
No one ever will, no one ever will
No one ever will believe

What is love without pain? [4x]

Carve your name on me
Cut it to my skin
Make it always bleed
So, I won't forget

(Cut it deep!)

Carve your name on me
