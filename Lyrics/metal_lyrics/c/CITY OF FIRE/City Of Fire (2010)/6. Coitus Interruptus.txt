No!

No love for me
No love
I need a release from your love
For me, your love is bittersweet

Your blood for me
Your blood
You know that it's making me
No love for me
You know I need to release
I get no satisfaction
You always leave me high and dry
I get no satisfaction
Get on your knees, crawl to me, uh
Suck it!

All I want is your body
Your naked skin on mine
Just you and me
Together we'll be
In time our skin
Will connect in sin

Oh, all I want is your body
Your naked skin on mine, ah!

Oh

It's the way you fuck with me [x3]
It's the way you fuck with my mind

Can you down again
You just walk away from me
Can you down again
You just walk away from me

Can you
You just walk away from me
