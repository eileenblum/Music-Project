In the shadows I've been watching.
I feel so strange inside my heart.
I am hiding without a reason.
I can't find the words to say what I feel.cause
I am afraid to open my heart
I know who I love!

Can not stand the voice in my head.
It lies to me, it makes me weak.
So afraid to be let down.
I gotta change, face my fears,

I can see you!
I can feel you!
Calling your name in my dreams
I can't even try to tell you!

Afraid of my reflection. I feel ashamed.
Why can't I tell you?
Why can't you see me?
Am I a shadow before your eyes... invisible.
I can not go on 'hiding in shadows.
Ridiculous

Stop showing my weakness, fighting demons,
A wake up call, I feel so enchanted, I must let you know.
I can not go on in this silence.
Can you hear me?
Will you cherish me?

I can see you!
I can feel you!
Calling your name in my dreams
I wish i could free my mind.
I am blinded!
So enchanted!
Your eyes kills me, in this love.
How will you know?

I can see you!
I can feel you!
Calling your name in my dreams
I wish i could free my mind.
I am blinded!
So enchanted!
Your eyes kills me, in this love.
