A world f?ll of darkness.
There's so much despair.
Our faith grows stronger.
See the bright sides of life.
Live life together.
'Cause nothing will break us.
Standing united.
Two of the same kind.
Fight temptation never lose the hope.

We are the heroes.
Standing tall, caring.
Friends 'til eternity.
Makes us strong, no lies.

No good to be a liar.
Nothing's stronger than love.
Friends make you stronger.
Trust makes You believe.
Sharing the same faith.
Surpressing the darkness.
Bloodlines forever.
Bonds with no ending.
Fight temptation never lose the hope.

We are the heroes.
Standing tall, caring.
Friends 'til eternity.
Makes us strong, no lies.

We are the heroes.
Standing tall, caring.
Friends 'til eternity.
Makes us strong, no lies.

We are the heroes.
Standing tall, caring.
Friends 'til eternity.
Makes us strong, no lies.
