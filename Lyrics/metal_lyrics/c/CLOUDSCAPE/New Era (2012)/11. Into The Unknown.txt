As the sun is rising.
Standing on the shore
Awaiting the morning tide
Dragonships are ready to set sail
Over the seas into the unknown
Our journey is filled with danger
As northern men we're not afraid to fall
As we enter Odin's hall, as we enter Odin's hall,

This is gates of valhalla
They will open up for me
I'm leaving this mortal world
To live forevermore
Beyond the gates of valhalla
They will open up for me
I'm leaving this mortal world
To live forevermore

What our future will hold is written in the runes.
Our quest to find riches.
Enslaving the weak and conquering their soil
When we return we will reign in supremacy.
As northern men we're not afraid to fall.
As we enter Odin's hall, as we enter Odin's hall

This is gates of valhalla
They will open up for me
I'm leaving this mortal world
To live forevermore
Beyond the gates of valhalla
They will open up for me
I'm leaving this mortal world

As the Gods welcomes us all
Armageddon will unite us all
In front of the Gods we will stand tall

This is gates of valhalla
They will open up for me
I'm leaving this mortal world
To live forevermore
Beyond the gates of valhalla
They will open up for me
I'm leaving this mortal world
