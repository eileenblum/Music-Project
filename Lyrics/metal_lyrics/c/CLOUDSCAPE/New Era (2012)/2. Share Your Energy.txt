Waking up to another day
Feeling thrilled of what's to come
Everything's alright
A pleasant feel of inner peace, conciousness, correct behavior
Embrace the world, it's yours to love
No more crying, no denial
No more lying life's too precious
All you need is to keep on smiling

Share your energy

Rising. falling. makes you stronger
Don't ever give it up
Try to be king of your life
Share your energy
Never refuse your dreams

You see the sunlight cover the ground
A soft wind breeze makes you feel enlightened
You are a lover of life
Share your energy

Rising. falling. makes you stronger
Don't ever give it up
Try to be king of your life
Share your energy
Never refuse your dreams

Don't ever give it up
Try to be king of your life
Share your energy to the world

Rising. falling. makes you stronger
Don't ever give it up
Try to be king of your life
Share your energy
Never refuse your dreams
