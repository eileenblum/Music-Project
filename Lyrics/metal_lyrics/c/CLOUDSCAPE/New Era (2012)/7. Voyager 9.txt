We're at the edge of forever.
We will leave for space.
Will it give us the answers?
What lies beyond this world?
We will explore outer space.
New worlds to find.
Astral secrets deep beyond the sky.
Will we make it?
Searching for new worlds.
Alien lifeforms found beyond the sky.
They are no different than our own mankind.

Artificial life support.
On this interstellar flight.
We lie frozen deep through time.
As the countdown has begun.
Ooh, will we find it?

We can not comprehend the vastness of space.
Tomorrow's dream is upon us now.
Though lightyears of universe deep into space.
Secrets lie by mankind found.

Artificial life support.
On this interstellar flight.
We lie frozen deep through time.
As the countdown has begun.
Ooh, will we find it?

We're at the edge of forever.
We will leave for space.
Will it give us all the answers?
What lies beyond this world?
We will explore, new worlds to find...

Artificial life support.
On this interstellar flight.
We lie frozen deep through time.
As the countdown has begun.
Ooh, will we find it?
