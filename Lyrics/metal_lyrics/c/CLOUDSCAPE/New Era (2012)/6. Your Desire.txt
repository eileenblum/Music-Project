Fantasies you can see but not reach
So depressed, you are lost, you will fall you will fall
You will surrender to your fate
A misery that you've built
You have no passion to go on
Save your life from this pain

Rise Scream Pain Agony Fall Fear Weak Denial

It's your desire a twisted way to live your life
No ambitions to find a way
To smile again and live you were a dreamer
Now it's gone.
There s nothing left you have
To let it go find a way to live

Feel so low you can t see a Solution
Always find excuses not to be disturbed
You will surrender to your fate
A misery that you've built
You have no passion to go on
Save your life from this pain

Rise Scream Pain Agony Fall Fear Weak Denial

It's your desire a twisted way to live your life
No ambitions to find a way
To smile again and live you were a dreamer
Now it's gone.
There s nothing left you have
To let it go find a way to live

Always alone in silence
Can't see beyond depression
You hate all social networks
You lock yourself in misery
You never face the sunlight
You do whatever feels right
You don't believe in yourself
You don't believe in others

It's your desire a twisted way to live your life
No ambitions to find a way
To smile again and live you were a dreamer
Now it's gone.
There s nothing left you have
To let it go find a way to live
