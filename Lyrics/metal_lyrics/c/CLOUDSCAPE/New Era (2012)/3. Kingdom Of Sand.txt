I see a sign before me.
The stars they have aligned.
I'm the one, my time has come.
The blood of Ra runs through me.
Osiris be my guide.
A ruler of this...Kingdom of sand.

Call the world.
A temple of immortality.
See it rise.
A legacy of old.
A gateway to the gods.
A monument of greatness.
See it rise, kingdom of sand.

I am the son of Horns.
I'm a God in human flesh.
When I call for You.
You will kneel before me.

Call the world.
A temple of immortality.
See it rise.
A legacy of old.
A gateway to the gods.
A monument of greatness.
See it rise, kingdom of sand.

Call the world.
A temple of immortality.
See it rise.
A legacy of old.
A gateway to the gods.
A monument of greatness.
See it rise, kingdom of sand.

Call the world.
A temple of immortality.
See it rise.
A legacy of old.
A gateway to the gods.
A monument of greatness.
See it rise, kingdom of sand.
