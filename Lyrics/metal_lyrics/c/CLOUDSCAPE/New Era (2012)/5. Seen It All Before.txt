You prefer the silence, you're afraid
Try to face it all again
You need to say it, don't deny it
Don't try to hide in the dark
No way to ride it out
It will come back even stronger
You tried to find a reason
A way to make amends
Still you're left with wonders

You've seen it all
Better speaking out
Close your eyes and be wise
Try to remember
Do not hide no more bailing out
Don't be afraid to say your prayers

Lost communication fills your needs
Try to change your mind
You must face it, understand it
Don't build a distance without words
Find the love again
Do not lose it, try to save it
Rising up from nowhere
Finding strength within
Fight to save your love

You've seen it all
Better speaking out
Close your eyes and be wise
Try to remember
Do not hide no more bailing out
Don't be afraid to say your prayers

You tried to find a way to make amends.
You're calling out his name
He looks at you with darkened eyes.
You try to make amends.
You want to save the love you had
You tried to find your love
Talling, no more falling.
You tried to find a way to make amends.

You've seen it all
Better speaking out
Close your eyes and be wise
Try to remember
Do not hide no more bailing out
Don't be afraid to say your prayers
