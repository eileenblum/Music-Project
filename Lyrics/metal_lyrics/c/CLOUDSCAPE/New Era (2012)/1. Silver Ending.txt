Night falls blood boils the hunt begins again
The lunar calling grips my thoughts.
My curse, my life the violence feeds.
My inner seif consumes the soul

Turning my own kind
Leaving none behind

Directed by the moon, controls my every haunting move

Someone stop this
Give me redemption
Daytime grows
Short and scary

Awaken nightmare reaches.
You'll cry no more, give you peace
Thirst turns you to me

Let the holy silver end me
Many years gone by need so much to lay me down
Let the holy silver end me now all this time
Need so much to lay me down buttry let my fire fade

The darkness calls my name, tempted to resist
l'm bound to this fate, controls my every haunting move

Someone stop this.
Give me redemption
Daytime grows
Short and scary
Awaken nightmare reaches
You'll cry no more, give you peace
Thirst turns you to me

Let the holy silver end me
Many years gone by need so much to lay me down
Let the holy silver end me now all this time
Need so much to lay me down buttry let my fire fade

Clawing, tearing limb from limb so mean
The power building upinside
End itnoworhumanity will pay
Long for sunlight, never moonlight

Let the holy silver end me
Many years gone by need so much to lay me down
Let the holy silver end me now all this time
Need so much to lay me down buttry let my fire fade
