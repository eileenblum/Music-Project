I can not stand it anymore.
Just light a candle, take it easy and relax.
Can't find a reason for all their stress.
No point in understanding people on the run.

Trying hard to cry out loud.
Listen to the words i say.
Try to pull the brake.
Relax and take a deep breath.
Remembering those days of silence.
Nothing to feel bad about.
I hate that it's all gone.
People ain't aware that life pass by.
Doesn't care no more.

Imaginations taking over.
I dream of silence, peaceful sleeping.
Sometimes I feel like time is lethal.
Why don't we all just stop for a while.

Trying hard to cry out loud.
Listen to the words i say.
Try to pull the brake.
Relax and take a deep breath.
Remembering those days of silence.
Nothing to feel bad about.
I hate that it's all gone.
People ain't aware that life pass by.
Doesn't care no more.

In my dreams I can hear the wind blow.
It whispers to me, so gently.

Trying hard to cry out loud.
Listen to the words i say.
Try to pull the brake.
Relax and take a deep breath.
Remembering those days of silence.
Nothing to feel bad about.
I hate that it's all gone.
People ain't aware that life pass by.
Doesn't care no more.
