I dream of You
You took my heart in your hands to keep
You took my breath away
This violet eve makes me forget about my life before
I am yours to keep, I am yours to love
You look at me, I see your eyes
You make me shiver. I believe in You
You are the reason I believe in love

Reaching out
Take my hand
Exploring my world
Enjoy my land of dreams

I'm lost in love
Enchanted by your presence
I can hear my heartbeats, pounding for You
I realize that we will last until the end of days, until the end of days
You look at me, I see Your eyes
You make me shiver.
I believe in You
You are the reason I believe in love

Reaching out
Take my hand
Exploring my world
Enjoy my land of dreams

I can feel it, I can see it
A magic purple sunset
Gone through changes to the better ways to live
Not mistaking my senses
You've made me realize
Destiny's caliing
We are meant to be

Reaching out
Take my hand
Exploring my world
Enjoy my land of dreams

Reaching out
Take my hand
Exploring my world
Enjoy my land of dreams
