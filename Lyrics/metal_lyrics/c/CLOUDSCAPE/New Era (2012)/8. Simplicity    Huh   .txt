Awake at night my senses makes me feel so defenceless.
I can not stop believing we will ride out this storm.
You say my word's like poison.
All I do feels in vain.
No matter what I do you throw it back at me.
I wonder where it all began?

I remember when you cried.
I remember your sweet love.
Can not understand why it all went down the drain.
No surrender... simplicity needed.

A doubted vision spreading.
Accusing eyes are staring.
My mind's like shattered glass trying to pick up the pieces.
Every time I look in the mirror I see a vanishing soul.
Nothing is solid as a rock.
Do not forsake all you've got.
Life is complicated, a lesson to be learned.

I remember when you cried.
I remember your sweet love.
Can not understand why it all went down the drain.
No surrender... simplicity needed.

I remember when you cried.
I remember your sweet love.
Can not understand why it all went down the drain.
No surrender... simplicity needed.

I believe there's nothing left.
Maybe a better life awaits.
Life's too short to stay in bitterness...simplicity demand

I remember when you cried.
I remember your sweet love.
Can not understand why it all went down the drain.
No surrender... simplicity needed.
