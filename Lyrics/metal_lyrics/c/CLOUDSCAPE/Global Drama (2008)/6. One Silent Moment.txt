A misty evening, one silent moment
a candle burning, two innocent souls shared their love
suspicious feelings, a feel of wonders
the nightly wind breeze suddenly turned to fear and chaos

A call for mercy, no understanding
freedom's a memory, still jailed with no guilt
a woman's crying, when soldiers coming
her will to stop this, a hopeless feeling

She's left behind, the curtain fell down
she cried out his name
so many questions 'yet to be answered
empty surroundings

Crying, calling
faded lights and shadows
she was praying, begging
mercy will be shown

Remembering the days when love showed the way
through hard times and misery
suddenly alone... wondering why

Alive but in what shape
locked in a cold grey cell
her face was on his mind
tried so hard to convince he's innocent

She's left behind, the curtain fell down
she cried out his name
so many questions 'yet to be answered

Crying, calling
faded lights and shadows
she was praying, begging
mercy will be shown

Crying, calling
faded lights and shadows
praying, calling his name...
