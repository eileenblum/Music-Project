She'd set the world on fire
words turned into lies
she tried to hide her anger
doesn't care
she's alone in silence
no tears, neither smiling
she tried to close her eyes

No lies, she's being honest
everyone looked down at her
if she could cry she'd scream in anger
chances are made to take a risk for

She tried to carry on
rumours spread by liars
she used to be so loved
jealousy, surrounded
emotion's trembling

Sacrificed her freedom
many dreams came true
so lonely and abandoned
her smile left her face
kept the fire burning
determined to stand tall
tried to close her eyes

What's the prize, her sacrifice
refused to share her inner secrets

The eyes of jealousy
her inner secrets

Oooh, was there a way to let go
oooh, she needed encourage

No lies, she's being honest
everyone looked down at her
if she could cry she'd scream in anger
chances are made to take a risk for

Visions, guiding
shadows clouded her
smiling, mourning
shining, glowing
she's always followed her heart
jealousy tried to pull her down

Dreaming of kindness
emotions in motion

No lies, she's being honest
everyone looked down at her
if she could cry she'd scream in anger
chances are made to take a risk for
she tried to carry on...

Oooh, was there a way to let go
oooh, she needed encourage

No lies, she's being honest
everyone looked down at her
no lies, she's being honest
everyone looked down at her that night

Eyes of jealousy
