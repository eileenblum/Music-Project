I'll show you anger
a new world of madness
you can not hear the gods are calling
embrace your darkest side
embrace your father
you are the one we have been waiting for

Still here, still you're breathing
our sacrifice for the quest
the bringer of darkness
rising
from the past we know
the keeper of darkness.

Ooohh...what a sin...

Don't try to deny the bond
destined to be the one
you shall not fear the darkest legacy

A world consumed by violence
you can not understand
you are the one that we've been longing for

Still here, still you're breathing
our sacrifice for the quest
the bringer of darkness
rising
from the past we know
the keeper of darkness.

I need, I bleed, for you
your seed, will grow, to rule

Still here, still you're breathing
our sacrifice for the quest
the bringer of darkness
rising
from the past that we know
the keeper of darkness.

Still here, still you're breathing
our sacrifice for the quest
the bringer of darkness
rising
from the past we know
the keeper of darkness.
