Descending
a malicious airborn virus
the wind will change
whose bells it's really calling
we need some faith along the way

An utter feeling, reaches my mind
do i have the spine to stay
like the troups are sent away, with a flag and with a lie
we want to live another day in this world

Fragile, we are living
in this world

So scaring
the way we have to dress today.
an underground shelter
we are trapped in a room
we have to share the load

Awaiting clarence, awaiting broadcast
i want my troubles washed away
like the troups are sent away, with a flag and with a lie
we want to live another day in this world

Fragile, we are living
in this world

Awaiting clarence, am i dreaming
i want my troubles washed away
like the troups are sent away, with a flag and with a lie
we want to live another day in this world

Fragile, we are living
in this world
