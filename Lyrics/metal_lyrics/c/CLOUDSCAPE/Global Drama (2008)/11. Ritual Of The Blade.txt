In charge of the legions
warlord living to serve
living by the masters call
hesitation's just a word

Raised for a purpose
zero parental guidance
blood red rising sun
the symbol, the mark, the foretold path

Raised with the sword as a brother
respect the steel, living as one
a sharp love with uncutable bonds
ritual of the blade

Ritual
a katana blessing, disgrace
the sin above all
companion, seals the faith

Honour's the lifeforce
gives fuel to the fire
bleeding shows passion
bringing down souls write courage in blood

Superiority by greater strength in loyalty
decades without failure
pleasure in victory beats the fear

At last all the gods lift their hands
take away all their grace
alone with the blade to face the deeds
ritual of the blade

Ritual
a katana blessing, disgrace
the sin above all
companion, seals the faith

Oooh, disgrace
oooh, seals the faith

Ritual of the blade

Ritual
a katana blessing, disgrace
the sin above all
companion, seals the faith

Ritual...
