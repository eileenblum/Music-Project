Who can we trust, feels like no one
acting like you and me
hibernating in their cells
they are biding their time

Forever waiting for salvation
life has no sense of being kind and caring
creating death

Sacrifices paid in blood

Religious revolution

We are fighting holy wars
it's a suicide solution

No one can see it nor understand it
strapped to their bodies
the will to die, a sacrifice
in the name of the prophet

Senseless killing, heartless behavior
the innocent wounded
it's time to close the door for freedom
freedom exists no more

Sacrifices paid in blood

Religious revolution

We are fighting holy wars
it's a suicide solution

Following mindless leaders
speaking words of hatred
slaying the infidels
by dying themselves

Sacrifices paid in blood

Religious revolution

We are fighting holy wars
it's a suicide solution

Sacrifices paid in blood

We are fighting holy wars
it's a suicide solution
