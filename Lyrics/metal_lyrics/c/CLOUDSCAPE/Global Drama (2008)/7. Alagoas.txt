Inside a green little house
no sunshine reaches the floor
she came from africa
so tight her hands were tied
to a worn wooden chair
she arrived from africa

By boat she travelled far
in a cage like an animal
whips and chains... crying her eyes out
no sun below the deck
no chance of escaping
she lived in africa

Tonight she's left alone
healing her scars again
she closes her eyes (why)

Thinking about the children
my fate they're gonna share
work the days, abused at night
I wan't, I wan't my...

...Africa
i'm trapped in a house in a land without hope
there's no way out of here
endless crying and i raise my voice
save the young ones sorrow and pain

Let them out, let them play
Let them out, let them play

She wanted to believe in the rumours
that reached the door

A village was built
for some 20000 people
by slaves from Africa

If they only knew that her brother died
a day before the question
it wasn't meant to be

No freedom, no runaway
no slave that she could follow
to the border of alagoas

The smell of death is here
a squalid, dreadful time
she closes her eyes (oh why)

Self destructive thinking
her crave for lust is gone
work the days, abused at night
I wan't my...

...Africa
i'm trapped in a house in a land without hope
there's no way out of here
endless crying and i raise my voice
save the young ones sorrow

Border of alagoas
children without a childhood
no freedom, no games to play
children of innocence

Let them out, let them play

Tonight she's left alone
healing her scars again
she closes her eyes (oh why)

Self destructive thinking
her crave for lust is gone
work the days, abused at night

Africa
I'm trapped in a house in a land without hope
there's no way out of here
endless crying and i raise my voice
save the young ones sorrow

In a land without hope
there's no way out of here
endless crying and i raise my voice
save the young ones sorrow and pain
