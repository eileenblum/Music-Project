Man of a thousand faces
skin deep personalities
don't know which one to be
one step closer to insanity
solitude in a padded room
straightjacket memories
suffering a thorazine diet

Sedative eyes
silent screams
another sleepless night
praying for
the return of light

Look into the mirror
see the madness in your eyes
the mirror tells no lies
the silence within

Sanity now is beyond you

Voices echoing deep inside
haunted by dreams
within these walls it's safe to stay
locked in forevermore
bedstraps in a room so cold
drifting further away
into a never ending nightmare

Silent screams
another sleepless night
praying for
the return of light

Look into the mirror
see the madness in your eyes
the mirror tells no lies
the silence within

Silent screams
another sleepless night
praying for
the return of light

Look into the mirror
see the madness in your eyes
the mirror tells no lies
the silence within
look into the mirror
see the madness in your eyes
the mirror tells no lies
silence within
