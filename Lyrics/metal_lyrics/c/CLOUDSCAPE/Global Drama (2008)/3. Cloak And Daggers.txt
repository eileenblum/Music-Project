Lurking through the halls, a viscous entity
searching for the mark
task is bitter sweet, has no concern to him
reward me and i'm yours

The higher council rules me, security and fear
bleeding for them then ignore them, vacancy at hand
my loyalty's been paid for, now benefit all my skills
stealth and focus made my journey clean

Fall bring forth the new messiah

A new philosophy, scaring high and low
conservative behaviour
erase all signs of fate, let them dwell in silence
society will heal

The higher council rules me, security and fear
bleeding for them then ignore them, vacancy at hand
my loyalty's been paid for, now benefit all my skills
stealth and focus made my journey clean

Fall
bring forth the new messiah
crawl
no efforts, leave it be

Ruler of hellas, beware of the changes
your life's not precious our state will prevail
many before you tried to evolve, resistance is futile

The higher council rules me, security and fear
bleeding for them then ignore them, vacancy at hand
my loyalty's been paid for, now benefit all my skills
stealth and focus made my journey clean

Now fall
bring forth the new messiah
now crawl
no efforts, leave it be
