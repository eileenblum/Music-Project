Eyes open wide
no one sees the world like it is
so many lies, corrupted
everything's a matter of fact

We're ego-minded humans
we claim we strive for justice
the bottom line is different
it's all about winning in the end

There's no justice
no compassion
who care's if someone's falling
so much hatred
lying faces
in this game we play
no one caring
no one sharing
all true love's in the mirror
human's lying
and denying
that we're fooled by innocence

...Justice

Jealous minds
smile at others failures
grand success
increasing poisoned words
it's all in vain
begging for understanding
the game we play
a charade of our existence

There's no justice
no compassion
who care's if someone's falling
so much hatred
lying faces
in this game we play
no one caring
no one sharing
all true love's in the mirror
human's lying
and denying
that we're fooled by...?

There's no justice
no compassion
who care's if someone's falling
so much hatred
lying faces
in this game we play

No one caring
no one sharing
all true love's in the mirror
human's lying
and denying
that we're fooled by innocence
begging for understanding...
