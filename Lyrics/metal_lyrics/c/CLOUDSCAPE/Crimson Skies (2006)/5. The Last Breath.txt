Staring toward the distant light
Thoughts from a different time appear
Becoming heavier by each minute
Deeper into the darkness below
The ocean will give
The ocean will take
Water is forgiving
Without care for the dead
Nor the living
It's getting colder and colder
Now we're surrounded by black
Panic is growing
It's getting deeper and deeper
There is no turning back
Awareness is fading
A void is calling as life's no more
Infinity welcomes the flesh
Will chunks of flesh be beaten before
Pressure forces bones to break
The ocean will give
The ocean will take
Water is forgiving
Without care for the dead
Nor the living
It's getting colder and colder
Now we're surrounded by black
Panic is growing
It's getting deeper and deeper
There is no turning back
Awareness is fading
