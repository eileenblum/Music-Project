I remember you
You were lost in agony
Couldn't find a way
To move on smiling to the world
Everything is gone
All the lonely nights you've cried
Couldn't let it go
No one wants to survive their own children
You were filled with hope
Then the world fell down, everything was all gone
(You were crying, you're denying)
There were no answers...
Dreams fade away
Smiles were far away, memories haunting you
Forever lost
Try to move on, take a chance, you are not alone
Try to live again...hope
How can we help you
This can not go on anymore
It's so hard to understand
What you've been going through
You were filled with hope
Then the world fell down, everything was all gone
(You were crying, you're denying)
There were no answers...
Dreams fade away
Smiles were far away, memories haunting you
Forever lost
Try to move on, take a chance, you are not alone
Try to live again...hope
