Welcome, I bid you welcome
As you enter my world
My infernal paradise
Will become your demise
My mind is exploring
A thousand ways
To inflict you pain
Evil, guiding my hand
Deeper into shadowland
Touch of evil
Draining your life
Deeper into shadowland
Leave here, you will never leave here
As we become one
My brutality divine
Will make you forever mine
The horror you feel arouses me
Beyond human ecstasy
Evil, guiding my hand
Deeper into shadowland
Touch of evil
Draining your life
Deeper into shadowland
