Distant voices
Calling out your name
Slowly fading
Away in your mind
In the shadows you are walking into nowhere
All tide up inside your mind
It feels like you are lost in a mirror maze
Without a way to get out
Fury haunts you tries to change you
All you want is self-esteem
Living mortals, psychic behavior
Makes it harder to still your mind
Calling for understanding
Searching for your own presence
You are lost inside your mind
You can't break the chains that hold you
All you need is self awareness
You are reaching out for the world
So quiet that you can hear a teardrop fall
You are isolated in your mind
Watching traffic roaring
Loud but you can't hear it
Locked in a mental prison
Designed by your mind
You are trying to survive this
You should try to live instead
No one hears you, no one sees you
You are lost in a twilight zone
Calling for understanding
Searching for your own presence
You are lost inside your mind
You can't break the chains that hold you
All you need is self awareness
You are reaching out for the world
