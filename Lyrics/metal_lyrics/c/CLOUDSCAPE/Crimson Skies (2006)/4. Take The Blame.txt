I still do remember
When our love did shine
A time for us we should recall
We shouldn't give it up that easily
A flame was burning
Why did it have to end
Dreams
The only thing that still remains...of you
I can't take the blame
You were leaving me
I still want your love
You are in my dreams
I want you for real
We were meant to be
I can't loose the memory
You were something rare
Can not stand that you are gone
Why did we choose our own directions
Was our love in vain
I need you now, more than ever
Dreams
The only thing that still remains...of you
I can't take the blame
You were leaving me
I still want your love
You are in my dreams
I want you for real
We were meant to be
