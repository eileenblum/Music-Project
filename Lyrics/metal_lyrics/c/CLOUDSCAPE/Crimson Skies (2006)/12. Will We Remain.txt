The silence seems so strange
It feels like there is something coming
The day turns into night
Still we're not aware
We have to care
We'll keep our fires that light up the world
What is it we are waiting for
Will we remain
Shadows and darkness (rising)
We are together as one
Children are crying
We must give them tomorrow
Night falls, fires burning
So many lives
Are wasted for nothing
I have a dream
Lights and shadows, signs of the moon
Imagine a place
Where love grows deep
Without fear and hate
We have to care
We'll keep our fires that light up the world
What is it we are waiting for
Will we remain
Shadows and darkness (rising)
We are together as one
Children are crying
We must give them tomorrow
Night falls, fires burning
So many lives
Are wasted for nothing
We are together...
