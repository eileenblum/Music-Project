Way up there the world's got a cover
You've learned to translate them
Soft lined interpretations
Of what the future will bring
Leave me be
I don't want to know
Take my eyes
Don't want to care no more
The sky will show and tell
Will you believe
A breach in my sanity
Rolling over me I can't deny them
Wishing for rain
Nighttime provides peace of mind
Forming a cloudscape of signs
Visible to the chosen few
Every hour changing the message
Sometimes they're good, often they're not
Leave me be
I don't want to know
Take my eyes
Don't want to care no more
The sky will show and tell
Will you believe
A breach in my sanity
Rolling over me I can't deny them
Wishing for rain
Nighttime provides peace of mind
Frustration builds my world
