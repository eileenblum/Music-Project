The globe turned to ashes
A gift spoiled by greed
Irrevocable actions
No healing, no treatment, a wasteland
Find redemption in machines
Built to help, changed to kill
Controlled by evil hands
Forced to see through different eyes
Tentative efforts to leave this place
Dissident parties joined under one dream
Searching for the new homeworld
A 1000 brave souls
Set their eyes to the endless black
Reaching out for a dream
Hope never dies
But it is controlled by fear
Evolving industries pleased the crowd
Minds replaced by living steel
Technology grew past up
The spiral spun faster down
Parts made for destruction
Gives hope to a dying breed
A construction of salvation
Built to last, built to reach
Tentative efforts to leave this place
Dissident parties joined under one dream
Searching for the new homeworld
A 1000 brave souls
Set their eyes to the endless black
Reaching out for a dream
Hope never dies
But it is controlled by fear
Searching for the new homeworld
A thousand brave souls
Set their eyes to the endless black
Reaching out for a dream
Hope never dies
Controlled by fear
