Little by little the veil closes in
Suffocation is not instant we're stretching our time
Flowing below us fossilized treasures
Bleeding the earth turning resource into stock
Black is the winter grey is the fall
Deeper grey than ever before
Corporations will linger certain as nightfall
Increasing accounts decreasing survival
Two shades of green with different content
One feeds the belly one feeds the bank
Black is the winter grey is the fall
Deeper grey than ever before
Summer and spring...
...Ceases to be
Into the pit we fall
Snowflakes burning us all
And then the rain...
Give me a reason to care
Suffering will pass us
Reap the whirlwind someday
To be the better man doesn't pay
Falling tears and silent complaints
No matter at all riding a hopeless wave
Voices of protest screaming in vain
Echoing for no one gives no recall
Black is the winter grey is the fall
Deeper grey than ever before
Summer and spring...
...Ceases to be
Into the pit we fall
Snowflakes burning us all
And then the rain...
Into the pit we fall
Snowflakes burning us all
