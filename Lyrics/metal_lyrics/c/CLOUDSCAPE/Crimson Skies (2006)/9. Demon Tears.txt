Pretending like an actor, a mind, intentions so black
Solitude darkness will be set free
Evolution made mistakes, to improve failures occur
Walking beside us, who could know...
A frontpage, something behind
There are three sides to some stories
Bleeding from the eyes that haunt you
Leaving scars which will reveal them
Give that pleasure they've been longing for
Pray to keep the demon locked in
Buried in the mind forever
Roam the earth for all eternity
Sedated in rooms with soft walls
We try to be enlightened
We're grasping for the answers
Since beginning of time
A riddle that followed mankind, give us a cure
A frontpage, something behind
There are three sides to some stories
Bleeding from the eyes that haunt you
Leaving scars which will reveal them
Give that pleasure they've been longing for
Pray to keep the demon locked in
Buried in the mind forever
Roam the earth for all eternity
Pretending like an actor, a mind, intentions so black
Among innocent people solitude darkness will be set free
Bleeding from the eyes that haunt you
Leaving scars which will reveal them
Give that pleasure they've been longing for
Pray to keep the demon locked in
Buried in the mind forever
Roam the earth for all eternity
