Far away, invaders, watching us, from high above
Aim is set, us humanoids, scanning out, Mother earth
Invisible, among us, flesh and blood, terrestrials
Side by side, friend and foe, creeping up, creeping in
D.N.A patterns copied in millions
Replicants tied to their everlong mission
Dreaming of faces
Leaving traces
Know, know them so well...Shapeshifter
Far too late, the warning, overrun, mankind lost
Pray to die, we never will, cloning starts, the game is set
D.N.A patterns copied in millions
Replicants tied to their everlong mission
Dreaming of faces
Leaving traces
Know, know them so well
Shapeshifter
Dreaming of faces
Leaving traces
Know, know them so well
Shapeshifter
Everyday faces
Leaving traces
Dreaming of faces
Leaving traces
Know, know them so well
Shapeshifter
