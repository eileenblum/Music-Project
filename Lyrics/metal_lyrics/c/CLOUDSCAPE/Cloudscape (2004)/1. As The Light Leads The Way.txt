[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Andersson]

[Guitar solo: Patrik]

Someone close left you behind
you were filled with sorrow,
you were crying all the time.
You were lost in your own world.
You were dreaming in deep sadness,
couldn't break free.
Now you have to be strong.
Face the future, do not hide.
You don't have to be afraid.
Open your eyes for tomorrow.
You remember all the things you've done.
(remember all the things you've done)
All these memories kept you crying.
Let it go!
Go on, don't cry. You have tomorrow.
As the light leads the way, you will follow.
You're lost into a world of sorrow.
Don't close your eyes for another day.
You see the past as present time.
You have to find a way to let go, break your chains.
All this grief has gone too far.
try to get a grip on yourself, or you won't last.
You remember all the things you've done.
(remember all the things you've done)
All these memories kept you crying.
Let it go!
Go on, don't cry. You have tomorrow.
As the light leads the way, you will follow.
You're lost into a world of sorrow.
Don't close your eyes for another day, another day, another day.
