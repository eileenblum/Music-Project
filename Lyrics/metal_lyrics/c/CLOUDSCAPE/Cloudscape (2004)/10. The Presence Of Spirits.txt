[Music: B. Eliasson, Lyrics: M. Andersson]

I can't prevail spirits from their acts.
They appear to me as ghosts from strange dimensions.
My existence is surrounded by illusions.
I haven't chosen this life to live, 'cause I'm...
...able to see the presence of spirits.
Close your eyes and you'll see through...
Mine (mine) and (and) feel (feel) my (my) misery.
As a child I learned how to live with it.
Feels like I'm losing consciousness in the real world.
Every time I go to sleep I hear whispers in the walls.
I'm really anxious to be free and left alone
from this spirit world. (spirit world)
Those christian ghosts can't find their peace.
That is why they're wandering like restless souls.
I can see dominions of spirits.
Close your eyes and you'll see through...
Mine (mine) and (and) feel (feel) my (my) misery.
As a child I learned how to live with it.
Feels like I'm losing consciousness.
As a child I learned how to live with it.
Feels like I'm losing consciousness in the real world.

[Guitar solo: BrÃ¶rn]

I can see dominions of spirits.
Close your eyes and you'll see through mine.
Misery.
As a child I learned how to live with it.
Feels like I'm losing consciousness.
As a child I learned how to live with it.
Feels like I'm losing consciousness in the real world
