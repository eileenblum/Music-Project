[Music: B. Eliasson, Lyrics: P. SvÃ¤rd / R. Landin]

I can see a crimson moonlight
in the distance, far away.
The legend tells us the time has come.
The stars are shining in the sky.
This quiet night is about to turn.
Evil doings will try to take, take away the light.
I see a strange formation of clouds,
a majestic sight made by strange illusions.
A presence glows in the dark,
suddenly it turns around.
It spread it's wings, straight towards the sky.
I see a fire coming from within,
speaking words unknown to me.
Oh no! Flames are getting wilder.
The time has come for me to run.
Am I the only one aware of the outcome?
It came out of the shadows.
A thing of illusions that should not be here.
I don't know if the world knows,
a thing from beyond will take our souls away.
A blinding light shooting from its eyes.
The aim is set, turning brick into dust.
Infernal chaos spreading wildfire,
the earth is crumbling and ceases to be.
It's all fading away.
Everything is calm again.
It was just a dream, now it's over.
It came out of the shadows.
A thing of illusions that should not be here.
I don't know if the world knows,
a thing from beyond will take our souls away.

[Guitar Melody: BrÃ¶rn]

Everything is calm again,
can't believe that it is over, yeah!
It came out of the shadows.
A thing of illusions that should not be here.
I don't know if the world knows,
a thing from beyond will take our souls away
