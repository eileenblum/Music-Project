[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Andersson]

You live your life on your own,
that's what you've been longing for,
no one to depend on.
A room with naked walls invites you to your future.
The silence calms you down.
A candle lights up the room.
This darkened world of loneliness makes
you feel so pleased.
No obligations to fulfill, to serve another.
You are on your own.
You have lived your life devoted to love.
The memories of your past are fading.
You're not afraid of being lonely.
You feel obliged to this life, no regrets.
Everyday is up to you.
Imagination fills your mind.
Blue skies and a sunshine world entering
your dreams.
Newly found lust for life growing inside of you.
Now you're making memories.
Don't try to remember what you've had,
you've found a life more convenient for you.
It wasn't meant for you to share your life.
You feel obliged to this life, no regrets.
Every day is up to you.
How you want to spend your time.
You've found more pleasure on your own.

[Guitar solo: Patrik]

Everyday is up to you.
How you want to spend your time.
You've found more pleasure on your own.
You've wanted this for so long.
Everyday is up to you.
Everyday is up to you.
Everyday is up to you.
Everyday is up to you...
