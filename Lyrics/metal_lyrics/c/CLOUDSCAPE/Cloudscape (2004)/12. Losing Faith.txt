[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Andersson]

I cannot take any of your lies.
You pushed me away too many times.
Losing my senses, 'turn to insanity.
I don't know if I am able to trust you.
Refuse to go on anymore.
My love for you feels like a dream.
Sometimes you say you love me.
Why can't you do that forever?
No!
Don't cry no tears, I won't be chained to your heart.
Your changing moods make me so angry.
I want you close to me.
You are the only one that I want.
Why are you so mean to me?
I just want you closer.
I can't blame you for the things I've done.
I don't wanna lose you again.
My life has fallen into pieces.
I'm crying for you.
My dreams, my life is about loving you.
Don't want to cry.
I just want your love.
Don't disappoint me again.

[Guitar solo: Patrik]

Refuse to go on anymore.
My love for you feels like a dream.
Sometimes you say you love me.
Why can't you do that forever?
I can't blame you for the things I've done.
I don't wanna lose you again.
My life has fallen into pieces.
I'm crying for you.
My dreams, my life is about loving you.
Don't want to cry.
I just want your love.
Don't disappoint me again, no
