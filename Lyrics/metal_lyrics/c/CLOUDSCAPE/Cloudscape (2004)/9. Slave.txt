[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Andersson]

She was caged in a room without any way to get out.
She was lost in a darkness which she could not figure out.
Couldn't stay there anymore.
She was trapped and couldn't get out of there.
No nightmare is comparable.
She's been abused as a slave and she's suffering.
She felt the pain, (She felt the pain)
dreaming of freedom, dreaming of light. (Dreaming of light)
She'd find a way, (She'd find a way)
running for freedom, running for light. (Running for light)
She saw a chance to escape, she'd run through broken glass.
Wouldn't feel anymore pain in that prison of slavery.
Now she's running for her life.
She was used to be chained, but now she's out of there.
No nightmare is comparable.
Now she's free like she is supposed to be.
She felt the pain, (She felt the pain)
dreaming of freedom, dreaming of light. (Dreaming of light)
She'd find a way, (She'd find a way)
running for freedom, running for light. (Running for light)

[Guitar solo: Patrik]

She was freed from the chains that kept her enslaved.
Now she's running for her life.
She was used to be chained, but now she's out of there. (Out of there)
No nightmare is comparable.
Now she's free like she is supposed to be.
She felt the pain,
dreaming of freedom, dreaming of light.
She'd find a way,
running for freedom, running for light.
She felt the pain,
dreaming of freedom, dreaming of light.
She'd find a way,
running for freedom, running for light
