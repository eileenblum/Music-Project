[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Andersson]

Just another bloody day.
You wonder what there is to do.
Your scream is echoing.
Your nerves begin to crawl.
You're tired of those days in silence.
You have no fantasies.
(Scream, scream)
Screaming in the night to hold on.
(Scream, scream)
Screaming to let go of your anger.
You are feeling like a wreck, trying to get by.
Well, you feel your heartbeat,
screaming out in anger.
You're tired of those days in silence.
You have no fantasies.
(Scream, scream)
Screaming in the night to hold on.
(Scream, scream)
Screaming to let go of your anger.

[Guitar solo: Patrik]

You wonder how to spend your days.
You can't go on like this.
(Scream, scream)
Screaming in the night to hold on.
(Scream, scream)
Screaming to let go of your anger.
