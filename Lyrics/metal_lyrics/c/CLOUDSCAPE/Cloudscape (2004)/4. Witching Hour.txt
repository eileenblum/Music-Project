[Music: B. Eliasson, Lyrics: R. Landin]

I am the myth, enlightened and above you all.
I inherit the haven which nature provides,
a threshold to aquatic landscapes.
Above the surface the gateway rises.
Enter the island, see what's beneath.
Only an entrance, never an exit.
Limited access ends life as you know it.
The ocean gave and I give it back.
Gods of the deep see my creations.
To see their excellence throw away your prejudice.
Crash into the waves, feeling the cold down below.
Make your final dive into the sea.
Welcome to this world.
My fortress below will gather their forces, hunt down the weakness in mankind.
The tide will wash all sins away.
Tsunamis will rule a flowing judge and jury.
Limited access ends life as you know it.
The ocean gave and I give it back.
Gods of the deep see my creations.
To see their excellence throw away your prejudice.
Crash into the waves, feeling the cold down below.
Make your final dive into the sea.
Welcome to this world.

[Guitar solo: BrÃ¶rn]

Crash into the waves, feeling the cold down below
Make your final dive into the sea.
Welcome to this world.
Crash into the waves, feeling the cold down below
Make your final dive into the sea.
Welcome to this world
