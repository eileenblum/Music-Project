[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Andersson]

I am laying down, staring at the ceiling.
I feel a tension creeping up my spine, tortures me.
The more I think about it, the more I feel the pain.
Better try to fall asleep but damn I have to scream.
In my dreams everything's alright.
I'm so far away from the misery.
The world's in pain and in agony.
I am not justified to complain.
When the world is crying why can't we try to understand?
The world is under fire, still we complain 'bout the small things in life.
I hear a clock ticking.
The sound is killing me.
'Thinking 'bout the children that are starving around the world.
Peace, love and understanding was meant as a guiding light.
But I don't know anyone who follows that great vision.
Our world is a falling star.
We have to realize it's time to save the world.
In my dreams everything's allright.
We have to understand we're close to damnation.
When the world is crying why can't we try to understand?
The world is under fire, still we complain 'bout the small things in life.
Under fire...

[Guitar solo: Patrik]

When the world is crying why can't we try to understand?
The world is under fire, still we complain 'bout the small things in life.
Under fire!
I am lying down, and I'm staring at the ceiling.
I'm feeling tension creeping up my spine,
Under fire!
Under fire!
