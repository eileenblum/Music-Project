I am the myth, enlightened and above you all
I inherit the haven which nature provides
A threshold to aquatic landscapes
Above the surface the gateway rises
Enter the island see whats beneath
Only and entrance never an exit
Limited access ends life as you know it
The ocean gave and I gave it back
Gods of the deep see my creations
To see their excellence throw away your prejudice
Crash into the waves
Feeling the cold
Down below
Make your final dive into the sea
Welcome to this world
My Fortress below will gather their forces
Hunt down the weakness in mankind
The tide will wash all sins away
Tsunamis will rule a flowing judge and jury
Limited access ends life as you know it
The ocean gave and I gave it back
Gods of the deep see my creations
To see their excellence throw away your prejudice
Crash into the waves
Feeling the cold
Down below
Make your final dive into the sea
Welcome to this world
Crash into the waves
Feeling the cold
Down below
Make your final dive into the sea
Welcome to this world
Crash into the waves
Feeling the cold
Down below
Make your final dive into the sea
Welcome to this world
