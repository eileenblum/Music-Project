I don't know why anyone would step back into the light.
They won't follow me here.
I left the empty sky behind.
Scared and rotting black.
It ain't the truth anyway.
I know my limits now.
My children, my loves, you've taken everything.
None of you will love me in the end.
I don't know why anyone would pretend to care about me when I take that lightless walk.
None of you will notice.
Never buried &amp; unmourned.
None of you will love me in the end.
