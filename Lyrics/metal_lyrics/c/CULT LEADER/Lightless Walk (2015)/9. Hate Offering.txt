Holy blood flows from consecrated mouths.
Consume the savior.
Belly full of god.
Only the faithful get to bask in all that love.
Fake love to spread hate.
Only they can stand free from sin and shame.
Washed in blood.
Purity is poison.
Rotting from the inside,
Kneel before the plague.
It's spread by rats with faith.
Paradise won't be waiting for you at the end of your wasted life.
Fake love to spread hate.
We stand on the outside and watch you gut yourselves for a prize.
Trapping the young and weak.
Fake love to spread hate.
