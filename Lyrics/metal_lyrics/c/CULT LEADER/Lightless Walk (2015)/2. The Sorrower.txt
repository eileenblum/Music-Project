Someday you will be at peace.
Someday everything will be alright.
Someday your heart will be full to bursting.
Someday, but not now.

You narcissistic fuck.

What makes you think it will?
You don't know a fucking thing and nothing you can say will change that.
Someday that heavy heart will have it's burden lifted.
This is a lie.

Nothing will get better.
