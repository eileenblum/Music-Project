A childhood buried under maple leaves.
Why didn't they stop the monster?
I remember the summer sun.
The sweating hands.
The stinking breath.
And the whispers.
I didn't know I needed saving until I saw all that worry in their eyes.
They turned their heads.
Forgot it happened.
I'm covered in ten thousand scars.
I didn't even know I had them and I can't see how deep it runs.
