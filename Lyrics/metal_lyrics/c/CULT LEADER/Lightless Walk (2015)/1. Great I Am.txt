Hell is empty,
Hell is here.
Hell is home,
I am free.
Let them wander under black skies.
Drink the cursed blood of the father.
Eat each other.
Separate myself from mankind.
I am safe here.
Hide my weakness behind violence.
I am not your shepherd.
Hell is kindness.
Hell is love.
Hell is peace.
I am free.
I stand tall behind my wall.
Hidden here.
Great I am.
