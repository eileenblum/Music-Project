A monolithic silver tongue.
A fucking politician standing tall against the sky.
Weak roots reveal harsh truths.
Skin will crawl.

Stomachs will turn inside and out.
Sift through the poison.
It leaks from the mouth.
Eat the foundation.
Soak up the praise.
Fuck all the others.
Stand on their bones.
Build a bright future.
Cover it in gas.
Wait for another to strike the match.

You're no martyr.
You earned every whisper.
You earned every sideways glance.
All that strength is fake.
Strike a cowards pose.
Who would have thought a snake could walk.
It's so much worse than you think.
