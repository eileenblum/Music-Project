Get on your knees,
I want you to beg for it with your last breath.
Tears and tongues hang in the air.
Breathe gold.
Bleed gold.

I will watch you suffer,
Like a lonely mother on a filthy deathbed.
Nothing will be there to offer you peace as you weep.
You will not find peace.

You breathed gold.
Beautiful lies.
You breathed gold.
Blinding us.

Do all of your lies still taste like heaven?
Or does it just taste like gold and bile now?
