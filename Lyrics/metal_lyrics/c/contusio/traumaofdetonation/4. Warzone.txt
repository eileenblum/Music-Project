War zone illuminated by explosions of plane granades.
Leting her voice in flames and leading her victims into the air.

Tormented bodies are losing their souls.
The strenght not controled.
Reliance has no influence.
Armageddon rules all over the world.

Every corner of teritory is broken by armageddon.
Hate rises in every chest.
Suffering waste emotions.
Gore lights turn on.
The sound of shooting doesn't stop.
Morbid visions in the head.

There is no escape, from death she says.
The final word is given to the homeland.
Survivors will fight till dawn,untill they win.

Tormented bodies are losing their souls.
The strenght not controled.
Reliance has no influence.
Armageddon rules all over the world.

Every corner of teritory is broken by armageddon.
Hate rises in every chest.
Suffering waste emotions.
Gore lights turn on.
The sound of shooting doesn't stop.
Morbid visions in the head.

Bullets on graves are fealing like rain.
Children have no fear, with fathers they hunt.

Whole weight of finger on the trigger of hate.
Battle never ends.
Everything is given FOR VICTORY!
