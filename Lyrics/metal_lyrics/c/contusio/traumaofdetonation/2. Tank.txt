The enemy is strong,too strong.
You can't smell the fear in the air.
Soldiers where dying ,blood was everywhere.
Then he come to save the day.

Tank start firing he broke their lines.
Masive destruction was upon their lives.
So we start firing there is no coming back.
We have the power, we have the tank.

Burning body where, laying everywhere.
Burning flesh, blood, cover the ground.
So we march night cover the light.
We going the home, leaving are dead behind.

Tank start firing he broke their lines.
Masive destruction was upon their lives.
So we start firing there is no coming back.
We have the power, we have the tank.
