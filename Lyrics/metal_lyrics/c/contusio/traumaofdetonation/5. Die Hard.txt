Die Hard
Suspended,ruthles,balanced of his own life.
In veins located traces,sparks of alcohol and nicotine.

Die hard!
Die hard!
Die hard,die hard.

I am conflict in the mafia world ,them dirty faces alternate each day.
My trusted pistol waiting me.
New exercise is set.

Die hard!
Die hard!
Die hard, die hard.

Violated hostages where captured between four wall.
Silence and justice extinct, born cruel rawness.
My skin is covered with blood and powder.
Bullets fly everywhere while last enemy i am punishing.

Die hard!
Die hard!
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.
