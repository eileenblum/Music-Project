Abandoned among flames, fear in his heart
the emperor sees his kingdom burn
he sees his life again, battles and triumphs
and suffering he takes his sword

The end is near, tragic and mean
Not even he managed to stop them
But this is war, sad and unfair
Will his fighting spirit find peace

A short time is left, death waits for him
As a hero he reaches his throne
One last prayer alone, some magic takes place
His soul gives life to Cydonia

There is no revenge in his heart, and right now
He'll be awake in the silence
He powerful will see the Gods in Heaven
A Divinity with an eternal soul.

Finally I can fly free in the sky, flying like a rainbow
Touching the stars and reigning in eternity
Cydonia Land of Life

When one day the entire planet will die
My Land will be free
Time will not be enough to eradicate this
The great fighting soul
And I want to see forever, to give out
Energy from my heart and my face to be
Silence in time, of a God, always inflamed

There is no revenge in his heart, and right now
He'll be awake in the silence
He powerful will see the Gods in Heaven
A Divinity with an eternal soul

Finally I can fly free in the sky, flying like a rainbow
Touching the stars and reigning in eternity
Cydonia Land of Life

But where is a planet without life in space
Where the spirit of a great King is still reigning
But where is a planet without life in space
Where the spirit of a great King is still reigning

Touching the start and reigning in eternity
Cydonia Land of Life
