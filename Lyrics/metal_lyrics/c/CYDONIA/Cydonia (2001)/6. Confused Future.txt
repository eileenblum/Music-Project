Wars and Murders fears injustice
These are little problems
Black and white men, poor and rich than
Am I going crazy?

I care for none  I think for myself
This my only religion
I'm bad for defense I'm a fool and a liar
Stay away from me if you can

Sex and strong drugs work &amp; music
Don't need anything else
Peace &amp; fortune, love &amp; hate
Now I know what they mean

I'm going away from this world
Maybe in the future we'll live in the space
Maybe in a galaxy we'll find a planet
With no politicians

Don't be afraid in their war
They will disappear the whole universe
Will be the only world

Don't be afraid in their war
They will disappear the whole universe
Will have an only Lord
