Shadows of evil in the night
They are hitting the ground
Peace is about to be cancelled
They are sure to take this world
Shades comes among the flames
The story will be changed
Blood is staining peace
They're sure to have this world

No one can stop, such dreams
In a fairy tale
The legend will fly...fly again in time
The anger of light Of the only God
Suddenly attacking The world remains free

The plan was well thought out
Their history: wars No mercy in their hearts
They're sure of their strength

Overwhelmed by their own hate
Shadows won't be saved
Drift out the lonely space
To find death here

No one can stop, such dreams
In a fairy tale
The legend will fly...fly again in time
The anger of light
Of the only God
Suddenly attacking
The world remains free
