They got here in the middle of the night
The light was really shining on the mounts
Petrified faces followed that moment
That's the very day that's signed by fate.

Wisdom &amp; love as the prophets had said
Will be alright just give it time
God knows what from abuse
Of wisdom may come
You will create your fate through our matrix

The universe is so full of real life
Adoring and preying it's own Gods
They're near to the doors of eternity
The eternal Masters of Stars
The Gods of Time

And the moment they had to leave
There emerged a great number of religions
Time passed by and with it all beliefs
Prayers got confused with fairy tales

Wisdom &amp; love as the prophets had said
Will be alright just give it time
God knows what from abuse
Of wisdom may come
You will create your fate through our matrix

The universe is so full of real life
Adoring and preying it's own Gods
They're near to the doors of eternity
The eternal Masters of Stars
The Gods of Time

[Narration]
"In all worlds there is both life and death
It's impossible to erase all memories"

But traces will always be hidden
Until the day..."when they will return..."

The universe is so full of real life
Adoring and preying it's own Gods
They're near to the doors of eternity
The eternal Masters of Stars
