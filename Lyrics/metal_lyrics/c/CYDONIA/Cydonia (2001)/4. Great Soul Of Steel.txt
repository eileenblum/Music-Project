It's burnt, the kingdom now is all in flames
Flames have consumed everything
Now the enemy is treading on (Your sacred religions)
Your face, your big and immortal portrait
Witness of catastrophe Will reflect the history
Of wisdom in the universe....
....Full of life and love

Shines like the sun everywhere and his
Power will never be stopped 
Empire of Cydonia
Great soul of Steel, destined to be
A proud warrior without fear &amp; revenge.

Dark are the battles that you fought
But you've never learnt to feel the hate
You have finalized your task
(In the name of the King of) Kings...
On the throne until your death
Your soul does not belong to it
'Cause your place is still here
The sign of life is inside the time....
....Full of tears and war

Shines like the sun everywhere and his
Power will never be stopped
Empire of Cydonia
Great soul of Steel, destined to be
A proud warrior without fear &amp; revenge.
Don't cry if your life will end, but smile....

[Narration] "And dreams took the colour of hope
When a soul came down from Heaven"

Shines like the sun everywhere and his
Power will never be stopped
Empire of Cydonia
Great soul of Steel, destined to be
A proud warrior without fear &amp; revenge.
