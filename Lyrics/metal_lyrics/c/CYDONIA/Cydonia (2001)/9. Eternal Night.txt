I'm just leaving my home
with my eyes full of tears
and I still think of my father
with his full of life

And my dreams linked to the past
will fill my heart with joy
But my memories won't die away
like the destiny of my world

And forever I'll dream of my land
Population did so much to survive
And now the flame is dying
No way to keep it burning
I will not forget

When the sun was still shining on Mars
And the stars illuminated the nights
Everything looked like a Paradise
The whole life was like inside a dream
When the ocean was as blue as the sky
And the snow brought colour to the mounts
When the forests were emerald green
And the light returned after a long night
Now reigns the eternal night

Damned night of evil
Your shadow steals my colours
You've stolen my precious life
And you're making-my world die
A trip without return
Death or a new world
I will challenge the laws of time
I'll see the shining sun

And forever I'll dream of my land
Population did so much to survive
And now the flame is dying
No way to keep it burning
I will not forget

The tears are falling on the past...
...I won't forget my land...
