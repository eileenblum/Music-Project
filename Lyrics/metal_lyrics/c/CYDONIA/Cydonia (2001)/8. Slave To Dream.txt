I am flying in a galaxy
Certain of seeing your eyes shining
I can hear your voice, I would like
To see your pretty smile
I know that you're there
I'm searching for the warmth of your arms
Inside my dream I'm spreading a
New flight with you

I look at the blue
Baby, I still can't see you
I can smell your scent
You'll always be in my heart

I'm ready to die, I don't wanna
Stop looking for you
Inside eternity,
Lost in the stars I'll find you
I know that you're there
I'm searching for the warmth of your arms
Inside my dream I'm spreading a
New flight with you

I look at the blue
Baby, I still can't see you
I can smell your scent
You'll always be in my heart

The fantasies of this game
Will increase my pains
And desire is making my
Heart explode
I'm a slave of this dream
I know I will wake up
And from Heaven, I'll fall
