Mistake! I'm running into my self
and I'm ready to uncover all the secrets of my identity
Disguised in an imperfect human convinced to be strong
and now I walk in the fire with the evil in my soul
As I'm guilty to a sin... 

You can't stop, you can't stop the pain in me
I refuse the tools and just want to break the rules
... trying to explain... in a damn blind world this is all a mistake! 

I lose my fantasy in my mind, my hand's taking a gun... 
front the mirror One Last Crime, and my life is fading
A shadow is coming in my sun, and while I look my eyes... 
crash the mirror I killed my curse, and my life is fading 

Image! Virtual reality!
I can't live linked to a wire as a puppet smiling front the show
I can't play to be happy for the answers that they've offered to me
and now I walk in the fire with the evil in my soul
As I'm guilty for my sin... 

You can't stop, you can't stop the pain in me
I refuse the tools and just want to break the rules
... trying to explain... in a damn blind world this is all a mistake! 

I lose my fantasy in my mind, my hand's taking a gun... 
front the mirror One Last Crime, and my life is fading
A shadow is coming in my sun, and while I look my eyes... 
crash the mirror I killed my curse, and my life is fading 

Cold inside, lost in my cell I'm unveiling my mask
Around me and in my mind I can feel you... oh... my my
... searching for the warmth of her arms and I need her poetries of dreams
... with no a reason to smile 

I lose my fantasy in my mind, my hand's taking a gun... 
front the mirror One Last Crime, and my life is fading
A shadow is coming in my sun, and while I look my eyes... 
crash the mirror I killed my curse, and my life is fading 

and my life is fading
