Welcome to the game, wake up from your destiny
catch this reality hidden in your soul
A presence in my brain dragging me in the hollow
I fight against my shade I'm losing my control 

Deceive your time and stay in the air to see
You lose your mind now you can't find peace 

Master Shadow of Universe controls my destination
my senses dying in his system ain't find real dimension
... slave to a crazy game... 

Welcome to your life, wake up front this tragedy
it's time to learn the truth disguised in a smiling world
All around my space I can feel the Master Shadow
I seek a logic mean... I fall in an endless hole 

Deceive your time and stay in the air to see
You lose your mind now you can't find peace 

Master Shadow of Universe controls my destination
my senses dying in his system ain't find real dimension
an unbreaking power will kill this flower giving symphonies of war 
It's a pure genetic failure, a deceit locked in my soul
... slave to a crazy game... 

wake up from your destiny... catch this reality... 
I'm losing my control! I'm losing my control! 

Master Shadow of Universe controls my destination
my senses dying in his system ain't find real dimension
an unbreaking power will kill this flower giving symphonies of war 
It's a pure genetic failure, a deceit locked in my soul
