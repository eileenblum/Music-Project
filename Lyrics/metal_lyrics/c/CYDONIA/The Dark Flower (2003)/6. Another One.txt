Watchers look around the world behind your thought
feeling every reaction of mind,across the imagination
Lighting soldiers over the rules, they're waiting for one last time
feeling every step on the ground to erase the feared invaders 

The Sun is crying in front of the fading world
Lies disguised in truth 

Was a magic dream in endless land... 
Now it's just a cemetery lost in a darkened fairy tale
Another Age will die in front the Sun
Will rise a shining Flower, a new game with new rules 

Watchers are fighting the evil to bring back a reason
now the faith is burned from the betrayal of the killers of religion
Fiercy humans against the rules, they're waiting for one last time
to fight the soldiers of light and sow their cruelty in time 

The Sun is crying in front of the fading world
Lies disguised in truth 

Was a magic dream in endless land... 
Now it's just a cemetery lost in a darkened fairy tale
Another Age will die in front the Sun
Will rise a shining Flower, a new game with new rules

The silent watchers look the shame of world
Another Age in time is dying in dreams 

The Sun is crying in front of the fading world
Lies disguiesd in truth 

Was a magic dream in endless land... 
Now it's just a cemetery lost in a darkened fairy tale
Another Age will die in front the Sun
Will rise a shining Flower, a new game with new rules
