Knocking at big door of time... victim of fate, shade in the night
Searching the meaning of life... watcher of sky, spirit of dark
and while I'm walking in your dream
I touch your hair and you whisper my name again
forgive my sin, I'll never leave you alone
follow me in the night, and I'll still give you my love 

Far from your life the darkness can see your dream from beyond mirror
Someone is waiting an answer tonight, the illusions are crossing your fear
...feeling the Midnight Man
Nightmare, around me
I'm ghost of the night slave in dark of the pain
Closed in my self... I'm in chains!
...ticking the midnight... I'll wait you on edge of Door 

Walking in the age with no life... slave in a sin stained from crime
I feel the sound of your tears... you can't find the peace thinking in time
and while I'm walking in your room
I hear your voice, you're calling me... you call my name again
don't cry tonight 'cause I'm still loving you
follow me in the night, a ghost will make you smile 

Far from your life the darkness can see your dream from beyond mirror
Someone is waiting an answer tonight, the illusions are crossing your fear
...feeling the Midnight Man

Nightmare, around me
I'm ghost of the night slave in dark of the pain
Closed in my self... I'm in chains!
... ticking the midnight... I'll wait you on edge of Door
An answer:... soldiers of light... 

Prisoner of midnight he knows the way
to the endless nightmare, his reign of time 

Far from your life, the darkness can see your dream from beyond mirror
Someone is waiting an answer tonight... welcome to your... 
Nightmare, around me
I'm ghost of the night slave in dark of the pain
Closed in my self... I'm in chains!
... ticking the midnight... I'll wait you on edge of nightmare!
