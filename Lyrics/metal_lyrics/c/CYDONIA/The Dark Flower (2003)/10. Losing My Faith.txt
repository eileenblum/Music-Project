A scream invades your dream, another crack in the world
the rain will bring the dark erasing the smile of life
Have you seen the fear in their eyes? A vision of strife!
No one's coming I'm going away, I'm poisoning my faith

Confused among the nightmares you'll try to fight your... 

Pray! Without finding the answers, without seeing your angels
Pray! For your damned injustice, for your bloody anger
...Must surrender!... Must surrender! 

Staying in chains and praying your Faith... Losing the reason... 
It's too late to close the way... too late to start a new day 

Wake up from boring peace, the sun shines on your way
you cannot reach the joy of a future with no pain
... many words are flying in the wind, can't stop your mind
Night is coming light's fading away, I'm poisoning my faith 

Confused among the nightmares you'll try to fight your pain 

Staying in chains and praying your Faith... 
... Losing the reason It's too late to close the way
Change your fate and your time... Losing the reason... 
It's too late to close the way... too late to start a new day 

Pray! Without finding the answers. Pray! Without seeing your angels
Pray! For your damned injustice. Pray! For your bloody anger
Must surrender! Must surrender! 

Staying in chains and praying your Faith... 
... Losing the reason It's too late to close the way
Change your fate and your time... Losing the reason... 
It's too late to close the way... too late to start a new day
