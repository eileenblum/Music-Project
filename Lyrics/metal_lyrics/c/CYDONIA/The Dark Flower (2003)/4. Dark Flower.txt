Blooding greed've stained your religions
leaving only hate inside your soul
Hey human can't you hear?
The flame of a deeping scream
I'm seeing the hell through the window 

This game is so hard to fight in a world with a no pride
This game is so bribe to the heart to save a flower from your crimes! 

Cold blade of silence dark image of reality
fading Dark Flower... leaving another memory in... 

Burning in a system of illusions
where you can only see your world dying
Bad murders in your sins
but you find nerve to pray
pretending pain in front the mirror 

This game is so hard to fight in a world with a no pride
This game is so bribe to the heart to save a flower from your crimes! 

Cold blade of silence dark image of reality
fading Dark Flower... leaving another memory in... 

Hey human can't you hear?
The flame of a deeping scream
I'm seeing the hell through the window 

This game is so hard to fight in a world with a no pride
This game is so bribe to the heart to save a flower from your crimes! 

Cold blade of silence dark image of reality
fading Dark Flower... leaving another memory in... 

a memory in time...
