I wait for the night and I'm ready to cross
the walls in the castle of nightmare
Over a cloud I can escape 

I wait for the night, I'm running in the hollow
I'm falling in an illusion of my thought 

Shine on the ocean
Flames of silk are burning on the world
Shine on the ocean
The walls in the kingdom of the king 

Beyond Time in a land of hope
one more chance to unfold the sacred laws
Hold your breath on a roaring fate
leave your soul and find the road of life 

And when you see the magic crown
and then you now uncover the ancient laws 

...the alien truth behind false realitiy

Beyond Time in a land of hope
one more chance to unfold the sacred laws
Hold your breath on a roaring fate
leave your soul and find the road of life
