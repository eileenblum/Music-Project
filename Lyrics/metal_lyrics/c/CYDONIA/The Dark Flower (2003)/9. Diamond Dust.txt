Fly and shine over the sacred laws
erase all memories of a life with no justice
Where you have rode alone, leaving tears in our hearts
Tell me friend have you find your smile?
Your fatal enemy can't reach you again his anger... is lost in the past!
Tell me what do you see beyond the other side? 

... so in the night you've been dragged out from the world
leaving the hollow in our soul
and while I look the mirror in time... 

Take my hand, break the time, return to dream back one more night
Diamond Dust is fading in darkened stars
Take my hand, back in time, rise to dream back one more night
Diamond Dust's flying in the wind 

Short's your way inside a virtual cell
snatch from your dream, snatch to shade of injustice
So you have found the end... a memory still live in our mind
Tell me friend which is the answer?
Maybe is just imagination to find... a sign of hope
hidden behind a silent Lord 

... so in the night you've been dragged out from the world
leaving the hollow in our soul
and while I look the mirror in time... 

Take my hand, break the time, return to dream back one more night
Diamond Dust is fading in darkened stars
Take my hand, back in time, rise to dream back one more night
Diamond Dust's flying in the wind 

A cruel trap for all but we'll believe... in a magic way to heaven
The world is blind to see the shadow... who's waiting for the end 

and here is the end, a silent dark, it's only another lie 
... a memory of a Diamond flies in the wind... his magic Dust... 

Take my hand, break the time, return to dream back one more night
Diamond Dust is fading in darkened stars
Take my hand, back in time, rise to dream back one more night
Diamond Dust's flying in the wind
