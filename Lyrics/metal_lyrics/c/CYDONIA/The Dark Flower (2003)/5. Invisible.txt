If you dig in a dream, if you look for a way to escape from the darkened hole
Maybe you'll feel and in a corner you'll meet the answer that you wait 

Feeling the shade of an angel of hell
his face in the dark looks in silence at my end
I'm back to the past to find a memory in time
Invisible I'm flying high... I'm flying high! 

Flying spirit let me fall inside a magic dream
Invisible in time... 
far away from the nightmare of my hate
and invisible I'll fly far away from my hate 

If you dig in your fate, if you wait for a sign to seal the darkened hole
Maybe you'll find in corner of a dream the answer that you want 

Feeling the shade of an angel of hell
his face in the dark looks in silence at my end
I'm back to the past to find a memory in time
Invisible I'm flying high... I'm flying high! 

Flying spirit let me fall inside a magic dream
Invisible in time... 
far away from the nightmare of my hate
and invisible I'll fly far away from my hate 

Feeling the shade of an angel of hell
his face in the dark looks in silence at my end 

Flying spirit let me fall inside a magic dream
Invisible in time... 
far away from the nightmare... 
Flying spirit let me fall inside a magic dream
Invisible in time... 

far away from the nightmare of my hate!
