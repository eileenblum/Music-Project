[Russ Ballard]

If you could see my mind
if you really look deep then maybe you'll find
That somewhere there will be a place
hidden behind my comedian face 

You will find somewhere there's a house
and inside that house there's a room
Locked in the room in the corner you see
a voice is waiting for me, to set it free
I got the key, I got the key 

Voices, I hear voices 

In my head the voice is waiting... 
waiting for me, to set it free
I locked it inside my imagination
but I'm the one who's got the combination
Some people didn't like what the voice did say
so I took the voice and I locked it away
I got the key, I got the key 

Voices, I hear voices, voices, I hear voices 

Don't look back, look straight ahead
Don't turn away, then the voice it said
Don't look back, yesterday's gone
Don't turn away, you can take it on 

Voices, I hear voices, voices, I hear voices
