Crooked crosses, twisted minds
Dangerous attraction
Stir up hatred, bait dissent
Open persecution
Never learn from past mistakes
Cling on to denial
Immune to reason, immune to truth
Small dog bark loud

Hatemonger's tirades
For cowards and fools
Join the dastard parade
Mobrule

Only numbers make you strong
On your own you're nothing
Spreading terror among the weak
Makes you fell superior
Willing puppet of higher powers
Ignore what you fight for
In the reich you so yearn for
You'd be the first to go

Hatemonger's tirades
For cowards and fools
Join the dastard parade
Mobrule
