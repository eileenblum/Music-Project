Strange ways lead us into
An early demise
Insane creed of destruction
Denail of life
Spiritual self-mutilation
Worshipping death
Drown in a sea of frustration
Cult of Baphomet

Life's mysterious ways
Fathomless realms
The Answers that we chase
Lie down in the depths

New life screaming for freedom
Chained to the past
Cast into pits of damnation
Driven by hate
False truths written in blood
Of and orphaned child
Sucked inte and abyss of failure
Purgatory inside

Life's mysterious ways
Fathomless realms
The Answers that we chase
Lie down in the depths

We are the children of pain
We walk throught hell
We are the children of pain
We are insane

Strange ways lead us into
An early demise
Insane creed of destruction
Denial of life
Drinking the snake's poison
Elixir of youth
We choose the path we walk on
Free will suicide
