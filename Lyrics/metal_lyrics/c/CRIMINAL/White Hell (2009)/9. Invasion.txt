Invaders from a land afar
Raping our land, our lives and our pride
Bringing disease to our bodies and minds

Live by the cross
Or die by the sword
Never surrender
To your empty god

Desecration of the soil we call home
Predators of insatiable wants
Criminals drench our country with blood

Live by the cross
Or die by the sword
Never surrender
To your empty god

Our souls were clean as your waters and lands
Envy and greed have infected our lives
Call it progress, soulness infamy

Live by the cross
Or die by the sword
Never surrender
To your empty god
