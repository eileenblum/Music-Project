Pray for rain to fall endlessly
Wipe the dirt, cleanse and purify
Purge our sins, set the earth free
Cover our shame, spawn a new time

Open the gates
Bring on the tides
Drown this deranged life
Open the gates
Bring on the tides
Unleash the deluge

Pray for rain to wash all pain away
Flood the stage of human misery
Buried dreams of divinity
Life erased, vain and futile

Open the gates
Bring on the tides
Drown this deranged life
Open the gates
Bring on the tides
Unleash the deluge

Desolated, depopulated
Apocalypse done
Decimated biblical plague
No kingdom come
Sun shall rise, a new day arrives
In silent splendor
Divine emptiness, godless paradise
A barren wasteland

Open the gates
Bring on the tides
Drown this deranged life
Open the gates
Bring on the tides
Unleash the deluge
