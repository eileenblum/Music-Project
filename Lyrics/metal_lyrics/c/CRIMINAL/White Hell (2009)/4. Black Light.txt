Black light shines on me
Life's blood poisoned stream
Stigma - A wound so deep
Lost soul fornever free

Wasted lives
Chasing the shadows of giants
Who tear our our eyes as we die
Escape from the land of the blind

We're the damned, the dwelling souls
Lost centuries ago
No redemption, the tortured ones
Mass grave, forgotten sons

Wasted lives
Chasing the shadows of giants
Who tear our our eyes as we die
Escape from the land of the blind

Black light!

Undead we walk
Towards no end
Undead we walk
We are the damned

Black light shines on me
Life's blood poisoned stream
Stigma - A wound so deep
Lost soul fornever free

Wasted lives
Chasing the shadows of giants
Who tear our our eyes as we die
Escape from the land of the blind

Black light!
