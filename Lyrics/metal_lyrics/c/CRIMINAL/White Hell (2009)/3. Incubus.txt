I want to possess you
Infest you
Crush your soul
I want to control your life
And set you free

I want to violate you
Corrode you
Inhabit your flesh
I want to submerge you in pain
And let you be

Possession
Submission
Repression

Possession
Submissioni
Release

Hate me
Detest me
Scream for more
I want to live your life
In misery

I want to enslave you
Chain you
At my feet
I want to worship
Every inch of me

Suffer
Weep
Surrender
Be free

Possession
Submission
Repression

Possession
Submission
Release
