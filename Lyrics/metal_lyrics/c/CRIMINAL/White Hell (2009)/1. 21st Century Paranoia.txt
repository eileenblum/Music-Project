Walls close in on me
Paralyzed by fear
Claustrophobic reality
Breed the menace
Create the enemy

Every face on every street
Threatening our very being
Lurking ready to attack
Waiting for that final blast - Jihad!

Paranoia
Phobia

Walls close in on me
Paralyzed by fear
Claustrophobic reality
Crave the menace
Embrace the enemy

Is this your new world order?
Paradigm shift
is this your new world order?
Paradigm shit

Weapons of mass deception
Shadows of a global threat
Cannot fodder for religion
Pouring fuel into the flames

Paranoia 
Phobia
