Five minutes of fame
A lifetime of shame
You sold your soul
To rot... And roll

Plastic provocation
Prepackaged rebellion
For the ever-hungry herd
Ruminant mass of nerds

Your image of lies
Is large than life
Your verbal ammunition
Cliches and repetition
Cheap, worn-out symbolism
Ease target, a dead religion
Early on your substance lost
All is said and done and sold

Another gear in the machine
Fast food for blank souls
More product for the industry
Leave your ideals at the door

Ephemeral shine
Certain decline
You'll go far
Shine on bastard star

Bastard star
