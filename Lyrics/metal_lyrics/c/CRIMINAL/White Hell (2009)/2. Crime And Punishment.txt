In cold blood the deed is done
Sparked by fear and desperation
Np remorse, the soulless one
Living life in disarray

Sink into reckless abandon
Mind blacked out, spiritual void
No remorse, no emotions
Blood is frozen in  your veins
Coming back to haunt
The ghost of the undead
Never laid to rest
Forever Punishment

Punishment - For all your sins
Punishment - The martyr weeps
Punishment - Purgatory begins
Punishment - Crime and punishment

Mental scars, time won't heal
Guilt corrodes you conscience
Cleanse the blood from you hands
Cleanse your soul to expiate
