Cross, crescent, David's star
Symbols of eternal war
Fighting, killing, dying for
A non existent god

Every race the chosen one
To sacrifice their sons
In the name of ancient lies
The size of a cathedral

I stand defiant
Bow to no god
Unmask the liars
The merchants of blood

Die for religion
Into the void

Back into obscurity
Truth a rare commodity
Freedom the first casualty
Of your genocidal quest

Where is love that you preach?
Forgotten, our of reach
Contradicting gospel
To disguise your prejudice

I stand defiant
Bow to no god
Unmask the liars
Religious scum

Die for religion
Into the void

I am infidel

Spare me your everlasting hell
Spare me your fucking fairytale

I am infidel

Cross, crescent, David's star
Symbols of eternal war
Fighting, killing, dying for
A non existent god

Every race the chosen one
To sacrifice their sons
In the name of ancient lies
The size of a cathedral

I stand defiant
Bow to no god
Unmask the liars
The merchants of blood

Die for religion
Into the void

I am infidel
