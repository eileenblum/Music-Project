Perpetual, it's brother against brother
Terminal, endemic social disease
Fatal spiral of violence
Programmed to prey upon the weak

The writing's on the wall
The sin is in us all

Sow the hate
Reap the pain
On and on
We are sons of Cain
Sow the hate
Reap the pain
On and on
We are sons of Cain

Primal, instinctive drive to kill
Criminal, denied morality
Animal, only the strong survive
Perpetual, as old as time itself

The writing's on the wall
The sin is in us all

Sow the hate
Reap the pain
On and on
We are sons of Cain
Sow the hate
Reap the pain
On and on
We are sons of Cain

Through the ages the seed was sown
Our contempt for peace has grown
Dead-end road of annihilation
Only one way to go which is down

As it's written so shall it be done
Fratricide, genocide, total war
Ashen remains of civilization
Only one way to go which is down

Perpetual, it's brother against brother
Terminal, endemic social disease
Fatal spiral of violence
Programmed to prey upon the weak

Sow the hate
Reap the pain
On and on
We are sons of Cain
Sow the hate
Reap the pain
On and on
We are sons of Cain
