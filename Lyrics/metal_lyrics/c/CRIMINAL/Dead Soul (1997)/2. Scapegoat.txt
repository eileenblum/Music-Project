[Music &amp; Lyrics: Reisenegger]

Mocked Insane Marginal man 
Mirror of your lowest drive 
Antichrist
I carry the weight I am denial of your life

Scapegoat 
Scapegoat

Segregate show me your hate
It's never too much to bear
You can't face taking my place 
I crossed the limits of fear 

Scapegoat
Scapegoat
I suffer for you
I suffer for you

Mocked Insane Marginal Man
Target of power and control 
Antichrist
Been crucified raped my mind and my soul

Scapegoat
Scapegoat
I suffer for you
I suffer for you
