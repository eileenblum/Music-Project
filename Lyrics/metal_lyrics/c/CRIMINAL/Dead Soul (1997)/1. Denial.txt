[Music: Reisenegger, Contreras  Lyrics: Reisenegger]

I Deny the system of hypocrisy and greed
Diarrhea of empty words from faces on a screen
Forcing people to support a fake democracy
Filling their pockets feeding off 
Our people's misery

I Deny

Organized Religion Opium of the mass
Promising Eternal Life Reality is death
Ruled by a morality made up to keep us blind
Centuries of fear to keep the power of their kind

I Deny

I Deny authorit of a uniform
No rights, no freedom, brute force the only law
Obeying the dictations of an invisible state
Persecution Violence sowing seeds of brother?s hate

I Deny
