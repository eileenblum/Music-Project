[Music: Contreras, Lyrics: Reisenegger]

Blindfolded isolated from reality
Force fed lies truth too black to see

Victimized
Victimized

Paranoid alone among enemies
Tension builds menace and hostility

Victimized
Victimized

Uncertainty no end for this suffering
Tormented truth too black to see

Victimized
Victimized
