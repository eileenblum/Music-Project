[Music: Contreras, Lyrics: Reisenegger]

Rejection, deception
World of distrust 
Division, confusion
Blinded and lost

The blame of ignorance
The weight of misery
The threat of violence
The guilt of life

Aggression, Submission
Crawl through the dirt
Violation, alienation
World of hurt

The blame of ignorance
The weight of misery
The threat of violence
The guilt of life
