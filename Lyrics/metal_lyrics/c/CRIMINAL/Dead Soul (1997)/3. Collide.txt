[Music: Contreras, Reisenegger, Lyrics: Cueto, Reisenegger]

Bloodshed starts twisting and raging
Driven by dirt hidden inside 
Fear turns to hatred the core depraved 
Desperate people ready to join the lines

Oppose
Divide
Confront 
Collide

Far from regret intolerant, enraged 
self justified
Their bloody slogans fuel the hate
And all that's left is dead bodies for the flies

Diseased machinery, blinded masses
Still upholding the cruel and insane 
A vicious circle clouds their minds 
And no one will ever stop their violent reign

Oppose
Divide
Confront
Collide
