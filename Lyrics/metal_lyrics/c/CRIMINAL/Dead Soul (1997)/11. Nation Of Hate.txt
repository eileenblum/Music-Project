[Music: Contreras, Lyrics: Reisenegger]

Years of hatred poisoned lives
Deafend, blinded desensitized

[Pre chorus]
Open wounds Never Heal
Cancer grows within 

[Chorus]
Dying nation in confrontation
Reckless nation, nation of hate

Breathe aggression infest the air
Violent regression to primal fear 

[Pre chorus...]
[Chorus...]

Lies collapsing
Rage sets in chain reaction 
Indistinct

[Pre chorus]

[Chorus]
