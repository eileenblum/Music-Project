[Music: Reisenegger, Ponce, Lyrics: Reisenegger]

Black life fades to back
Nothing to bring it back
What you covet what you suffered for 
You will lose it all

[Chorus:]
Why
The mind's erase
The flesh decayed
The void awaits 
Why
The mind's erase
The flesh decayed
The void awaits

Life is agony a path to nowhere
Time is a spiral of fear no real freedom
The body a cage 
Consumed and rotting with age

[chorus]

Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Illusion of life lost

Devoured by oblivion
all you were is gone, nothing remains
In the end but a dead soul left behind

[chorus]
