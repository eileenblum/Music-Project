[Music: Reisenegger, Contreras, Lyrics: Reisenegger]

Urge takes over will consciousness entombed 
What makes you strong becomes your greatness weakness

Slave Master
Slave Master

Pleasure in oblivion life slowly erased
No past no future a second somewhere else

Slave Master
Slave Master

Fragile lives destroyed seeking isolation
No love to save your ways of domination

Slave Master
Slave Master
