[Music: Vallejo,Reisenegger,Contreras, Lyrics: Reisenegger]

Hatred rising hatred of your kind
Reasons denied and your soul 
Lies dead inside

No salvation
Dig your own grave
No salvation

Faith collapsing blind eyes for suffering 
Like a cancer greatest plague ever seen

No salvation
Dig your own grave
No salvation
Enslaved
[repeat]

Freedom falling enslaved by helplessness
Fear destroying all hope for redemption left
