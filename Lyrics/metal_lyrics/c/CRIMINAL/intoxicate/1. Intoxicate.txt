[Music &amp; lyrics: Anton Reisenegger]

Human wreckage, shattered soul
Living in denial
Looking for euphoria
A taste of the divine
At full speed going down
The road of excess
On the run, must escape
The claws of emptiness

[Chorus:]
Demonic maze
Ethylic haze
The warm embrace
Of oblivion
Intoxicate
Disintegrate
You chose your fate
Path of no return

Precarious balancing act
Living on the edge
Playing with insanity
Like Russian roulette
One more shot, one more hour
Enemy of the light
Demon spirit, renegade
Chase the eternal night

Demonic maze
Ethylic haze
Intoxicate
Disintegrate

[Chorus]
