Maddened eyes 
Of souls that bleed
A frozen view
Of the decaying breed

Life has become
A sad joke
A game of fools
A drowning stone

[Chorus]
Downwards
On it goes
A mindless race
To nowhere
On it goes

The ground is burning
Heaven is red
The blood is flowing
The seas are dead

Bizarre landscape
By a maniac God
Chaos reigning
As time runs out

[chorus]

Self proclamed deity
Drowning in insanity
Descending spiral agony 
Endless hole of misery

Dreams of immortality
Shattered by reality
Silence gonna fill the air
Louder than life itself

Sinking into
A certain doom
The cradle of life becomes 
A bloody tomb

[chorus]
