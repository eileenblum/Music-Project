Tied and nailed piece of flesh
Tormented new object 
Incision, merciless
Scientific bloodshed

Christ pose looks grotesque
Martyrized, innocent
Novelty, dismemberment
Insensible and decadent

[Chorus]
Crucified - pay for our vanity
Crucified - urge our insanity

Crucified - die for humanity

Crucified

Deep cut into life
Scalpel, murder knife
Consciously reviled
Instrument of spite

No release, end delayed
Sadism the human way
Constant slow decay
Running red life slips away

[chorus]

Scapegoat bleeding thing
Provoked suffering
Senseless inhumane
Another life is spent in vain

Tied and nailed and ripped apart
Work is done, morbid art
Painful death, so absurd
Cries of pain were never heard

[chorus]
