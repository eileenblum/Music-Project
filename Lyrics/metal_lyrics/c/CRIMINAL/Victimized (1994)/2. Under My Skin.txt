Stigmatized, unlike anyone of you
I'm a stranger, anyplace I go

Scarred for life, down to the core
Never regret, never repent 
Hate makes me stronger
In my personal war
Poisoning my blood 
Raging within
This fire is burning
Under my skin

If I bleed, my blood is for my own
No futile creed, shall pollute my soul

Flesh of the weak
Feeds that machine
Never accept, never submit
Hate makes me stronger...

Show no remorse, But If I ever do
I'll hate myself, more than I hate you

Scarred for life, an open sore
Never regret, never repent 
Hate makes me stronger...
