Primitive nature of man
Violent
Hatred building within
Opressed
Powerless slaves of the state
Controlled
Sudden explosion of hate
Revolt 

Release from authority
Into savagery

[Chorus]
Rage - Fear - hate
No world order
Rage - Fear - hate
New disorder

Years of repressed grief
Diseased
Wars for race and belief
Unleashed
Blind leading the blind
Anarchy
Suffocating the land
Misery

Release from authority
Into savagery

[chorus]
