Different, Indifferent
No will to change
Destructive, negative
Life runs insane
Pessimist, nihilist
Live against life
Senseless, useless
Comedy of strife

[Chorus]

Low life still alive
And low life still a life
But even worse

Heresy, blasphemy
Do I need god?
Misery, disease

He needs me not
Breathing, feeling
Chaos above
Morbid, sordid
Manic void

[chorus]

Torture, torment  
Tearing me apart
Hatred, Rage
A rotten heart
Repressive, aggressive
Walls of human flesh
Terminal criminal
Artist of death

[chorus]
