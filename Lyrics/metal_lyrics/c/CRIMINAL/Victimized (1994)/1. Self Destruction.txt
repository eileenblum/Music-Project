State of dependence, Chemical Womb
Artificial euphoria, is life in a tomb

[chorus]
Self destruction
Insane
Life collapsing
In Pain

Deterioration, flesh weakening
A vicious circle, sucking you in

[chorus]

I am your body hungry for more
I am your mind's dead interior
I am your blessing and your condemnation
I am your god, like a shot from a gun

[chorus]
