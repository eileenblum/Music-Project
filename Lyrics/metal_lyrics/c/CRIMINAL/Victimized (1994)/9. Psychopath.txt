No time for innocence
A child raised in hate
Scarred by violence
A youth betrayed

Mind raped and twisted
Ghosts will never fade

Traumatic awakening
Growth is decay

[chorus]
Psycho 
Son of hate

Life is worth nothing
In tortured eyes
Empty surroundings
A word of lies

Wasted existence
Of one victimized

Life despised, Life denied
Live through homicide

[chorus]

Triggered aggression
Destroy to purify
Violent catharsis
Apocalypse inside

Driven by the vision
Of those who die

Life despised, life denied
Live through homicide

[chorus]
