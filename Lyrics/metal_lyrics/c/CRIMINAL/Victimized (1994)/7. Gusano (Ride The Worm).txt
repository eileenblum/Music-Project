Crawling through depression
A shape without a form
A life locked senselessly
A brain that's dead and gone

Waiting on the bottom
The key to your release
The dose fits your dependency
Sliming through your teeth

Incoming
It's up to you
He's talking
And tells you what to do

Ride the worm
Ride the worm

Double blurred vision
Distorted point of view
Shedding inhibitions
Tomorrow's back and blue

Driven by aggression
When the worms is by your side
Leading you to outlive
The things that you'll deny

Infectious
Cause of your kind
Obnoxious
The mirror of your mind

Incoming
It's up to you
He's laughing
and leaves you when you're through

Ride the worm
Ride the worm
