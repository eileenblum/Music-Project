Rising up 
Tearing down
What you are

Threatening
Never seen
All around

Every face
Every eye
Watching you

Weakening
Grip of pain
Won't let go

All that you see
All that you hear
All that you feel
All that you fear

Pressure [x6]

Paranoid
Self destroyed
Sickened mind

Burning up
Torn to shreds
From inside

Desperate
Cannot stand
The distress

Helpless
Hopeless
Lifeless

All that you see
All that you hear
All that you feel
All that you fear

Pressure [x6]
