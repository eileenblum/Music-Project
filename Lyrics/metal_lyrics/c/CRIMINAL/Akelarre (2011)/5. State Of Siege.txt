Times of unrest
A war of nerves
The smell of danger in the air
Tension builds
On violent streets
Detonation by a spark

Provocation
Retaliation
Unerground resistance breeds
Misinformation
Vilification
Invoke perpetual state of siege

The end of faith
The death of trust
Oppressors besieged by the opressed
By the opressed

What is the price of peace?
Unconditional surrender?
What is the prince of piece?
Thw wolf herding the sheep?

A voice on air
Another atrocity
Toture tactics
Politics of deceit
Times of unrest
A war of nerves
Invoke perpetual state of siege

The end of faith
The death of trust
Oppressors besieged by the opressed
By the opressed
