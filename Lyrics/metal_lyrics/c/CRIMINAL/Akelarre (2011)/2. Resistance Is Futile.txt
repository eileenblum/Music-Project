Voracious behemoths
Ravage the land
Consuming all in their reach
Oblivious to suffering
They plow on ahead
Through the soil, the air and the sea
Widespread misery
Down the path of no return
They've only one goal
The profits of doom
But those who laugh last, laugh alone

Driven by greed
Trampling the weak
No mercy, no remorse
Poisoned seeds
Mutated breeds
Progress at any cost
Resistance is futile

Embedded agents
Silence the cries
Of those who dare raise their voice
Irrational mission To crush is not an option
Where will they feast
On their magnificent wealth
When the whole world burns
Life on earth
A thing of the past
And those who laugh fast, laugh alone

Driven by greed
Trampling the weak
No mercy, no remorse
Poisoned seeds
Mutated breeds
Progress at any cost
Resistance is futile

You have the right to remain silent
You have the right to remain dead

New rulers of the world
Watch upon us
Soldiers of the new regime
Walk among us

Voracious behemoths
Ravage the land
Consuming all in their reach
Oblivious to suffering
They plow on ahead
Through the soil, the air and the sea
Widespread misery
Down the path of no return
They've only one goal
The profits of doom
But those who laugh last, laugh alone

Driven by greed
Trampling the weak
No mercy, no remorse
Poisoned seeds
Mutated breeds
Progress at any cost
Resistance is futile
