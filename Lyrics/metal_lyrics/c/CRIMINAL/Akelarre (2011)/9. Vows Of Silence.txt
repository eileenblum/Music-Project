Hidding in the dark
Of consecrated halls
Lurks the abomination
The foul touch of god
Innocence betrayed
The sacred bond of trust
Desecrated
The feed the urge repressed

Condemmed to shame
Guilt and salf-hate
Ridiculed and vilified
Discredited and blamed
Forgive me father
For you have sinned
Understand the flesh is weak
And the devil lives in it

Vows of silence
veil of lies
Vows of silence
Gag their cries

Slaves of celibacy
Reveling in sodomy
They live in denial
At the rituals of abuse
Unholy covenant
To protect their filthy kind
Vows of silence
Their cries will not be heard

Vows of silence
veil of lies
Vows of silence
Gag their cries
Vows of silence
veil of lies
Vows of silence
Gag their cries

Holy hand
Corrupted flesh
Defiled lamb
Forever scarred

Vows of silence
veil of lies
Vows of silence
Gag their cries
