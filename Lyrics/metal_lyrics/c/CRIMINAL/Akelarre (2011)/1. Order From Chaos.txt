Their whole world collapsing
Disappearing around them
In front of their eyes
Their lives washed away
Unspeakable menace
Tempting chaos and panic
Toxic clouds of fear
The future obscured

Cathartic devastation
Cataclysmic purification

Order from chaos
Arising
Order from chaos
Growing on barren earth
Orden from chaos
Emerging
Order from chaos
Spawing new life from death

No ruling hand
No divine command
Just inner strenght
In the face of death
Like and insect swarm
Programmed to survive
No life matters more
No life worth less

Cathartic devastation
Cataclysmic purification

Order from chaos
Arising
Order from chaos
Growing on barren earth
Orden from chaos
Emerging
Order from chaos
Spawing new life from death

A chain as strong
As it's weakest link
Lives interwined
Pushed to the brink
When the smoke has cleared
And the waters retreat
A burning sun rising
Resurrection complete

Peace from war
Strength from defeat
Wisdom from pain
Order from chaos
Light from dark
Hope from fear
Lifre from death
Order from chaos

Order from chaos
Arising
Order from chaos
Growing on barren earth
Orden from chaos
Emerging
Order from chaos
Spawing new life from death
