Beheading the beast
The souls of the dead shall rise
Craving their vengeance
The final confrontation
A nation in chaos
A casualty of history
Hostage to the course of time
Ideologies obsolete

A thousand heads
Growing on the wounded hydra
A thousand heirs
Claim the empty throne
All-out war
To perpetuate their reign
Drowning in violence
They reap what they have sown

Gates of chaos open wide
Justice done for those who died
Atonement for genocide
Tyrannicide

A new reign of terror
Casts it's shadow
The pendulum swings
Equilibrium shattered

Open the floodgates of rage
Unleash a tide of blood
Behold their furious vengeance
Judgement day has come

Gates of chaos open wide
Justice done for those who died
Atonement for genocide
Tyrannicide
