A war lost from the start
For no one escapes the bite
Police and government
All under the infleunce

Endless supply of fresh meat
For the killing machine
Fenerations gone to waste
Procreation of the damned

The power of the dog
The power of the dog

Third-world commodity
Grown on blood and misery
Always ready to provide
For the first world's appetite

The power of the dog
Trascends all frontiers
The power of the dog
Permeates every wall
The power of the dog
Every man's fot a price
The power of the dog
Corrupting all

The power of the dog
Selling pleasure to the world
The power of the dog
Dead bodies pave it's way
The power of the dog
A fight you cannot win
The power of the dog
Won't go away
