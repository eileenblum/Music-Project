Some pray to a deity
The great lie in the sky
Some live for god money
The worst of our kind
Some seek only pleasure
Entertained 'til they die
Some fall into insanity
Trapped inside their minds

Feel the void
Face the darkness
No sense of purpose
No meaning to life
Feel the void
Face the darkness
Don't look for truth
In a world of lies

Some follow the rules
Never questioning why
Some believe they can change the world
The will die as they try
Some fear the shadow of death
Some hope for an afterlife
Some know there's no answer
Some embrace suicide

Feel the void
Face the darkness
No sense of purpose
No meaning to life
Feel the void
Face the darkness
Don't look for truth
In a world of lies

Feel the hole in your soul

Feel the void

Feel the void
Face the darkness
No sense of purpose
No meaning to life
Feel the void
Face the darkness
Don't look for truth
In a world of lies
