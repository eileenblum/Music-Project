Modern-day alchemy
Miracle technology
Mankind's vanity
To control the elements
Catastrophic sinergy
Circumstances collide
Fate rears it's ugly head
The infallible fails

Play with fire
You'll get burnt
One step from the nuclear abyss
Play with fire
You'll get scorched
Hell awaits at the flick of a switch

A silent killer
Is riding the wind
Penetrating cells
The structures of life
Invisible collapse
Irreversible decay
Everything it'll touch
Shall return to dust

Play with fire
You'll get burnt
One step from the nuclear abyss
Play with fire
You'll get scorched
Hell awaits at the flick of a switch

At the threshold of doom
A recipe for disaster
The ghost we summoned
Can't be driven away
At the threshold of doom
One-way street to extinction
The ghost we summoned
Is here to stay

The ghost we summoned
Can't be driven away
The ghost we summoned
Is here ro stay

Living under an imminent threat
On the verge of disaster
Seconds away from annihilation
Through our own device
Holding on the foolish belief
Of our relative safety
Forced to face the unspeakable
Armageddon unleash

At the threshold of doom
A recipe for disaster
The ghost we summoned
Can't be driven away
At the threshold of doom
One-way street to extinction
The ghost we summoned
Is here to stay

The ghost we summoned
Is here to stay
