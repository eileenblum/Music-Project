Stabbed in the back
Betrayed a thousand times
Never surrendered
I've risen above the dirt

[Chorus:]
Alone
Insane
Alive

Rising
Above
Beyond

Spat at and mocked
Hatred my driving force
Fly while they crawl
They can't touch me now

[Chorus...]

Restless life
I created and destroyed
Can't stop at all
Until the final hour
