Welcome to
The edge of the world
Where life is cheap
And hope is lost
Welcome to
The land god forgot
Where time stands still
As darkness falls

We're falling away

Welcome to
A soil soaked in blood
Laughing, mourning
Killing time
Welcome to
A land with no soul
The past denied
The future black

We're falling away

An accident of creation
North of hell
Lies the land god forgot

Welcome to
A country bled dry
Vultures circle
In the sky
Welcome to
The desert of life
Decay rules
The land of lies

We're falling away
We're falling away
Over the edge of reality

An accident of creation
North of hell
Lies the land god forgot
