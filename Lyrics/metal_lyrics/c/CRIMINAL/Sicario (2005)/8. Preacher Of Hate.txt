Point the finger
Quick to judge
You don't know
Where I come from

Prejudiced from the start
Bastardised morale
Drenched in sanctimony
Two-faced preacher of hate

Arrogance
Blinds your eyes
Blood and guilt
Stain your hands

Ignorant from the start
Bastardised morale
Self righteous cunt
Two-faced preacher of hate
