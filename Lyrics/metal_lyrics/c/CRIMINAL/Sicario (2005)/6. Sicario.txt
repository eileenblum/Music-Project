Twelve years and nothing to lose
Violence a way of life
Don't care for the future
Cut reality with a knife
Life is worth nothing
Desensitized from pain
No right or wrong for me
Live to kill day after day

[Pre-chorus]
No turning back
When you cross that lione

Say a prayer for my soul
For mary knows what I do
"virgin of assassins
Help me make it through"
Always wear the scapulars
On my wrist for aim
On my heart to save my life
On my ankle to escape

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Feel the knife
In your heart
It makes me god
Sicario

Rite of initiation
First cold blooded kill
Fell a rush of blood
A macabre thrill
Rise up to super human

Cross to the other side
The trail of blood I'll follow
I'm leaving life behind

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus x2]

Twelve years and nothing to lose
Violence a way of life
Don't care for the future
Cut reality with a knife
Rise up to super human
Cross to the other side
The trail of blood I'll follow
I'm leaving life behind

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus x2]
