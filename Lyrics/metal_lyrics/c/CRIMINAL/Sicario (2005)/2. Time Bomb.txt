Cornered
Like an animal
No escape
Backs against the wall
Survival
Instinct suffocated
Face the threat
Time ticking away

[Pre-chorus:]
Extreme conditions
Extreme response

About to snap
Patience burning low
No life to spare
When it's theirs or your own
Dead end
Only one way left
Pent-up rage
Exploding in your face

[Pre-chorus:]

[Chorus]:
Time bomb
Time bomb
Time bomb
Time bomb

Cornered
Like an animal
No escape
Backs against the wall
Reflex
Action and reaction
Outa my way
Or I'll take you all down

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
