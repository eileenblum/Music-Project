Ancient gos demonized
Hope replaced by fear
Craving for power unfulfilled
The world on bended knees
Blood-stained stone church of hate
Knowledge oblitterated
Burnt flesh, peeled off skin
Hell on earth you bring

[Chorus]
The curse on your hands
The faith to kill
Because all you touch
Turns into filth

Centuries in the dark
The scars you left won't heal
A rotten soul infects your breath
Your holy rubbish stinks
Buried deep lies the truth
Hidden, unrevealed
From holy smoke a cloud of white sinister puppet rise

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus x2]
