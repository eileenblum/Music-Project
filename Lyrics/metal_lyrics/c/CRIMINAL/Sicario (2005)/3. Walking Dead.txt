Roamind the streets
The city of dead souls
Lambs to the slaughter
Procession
21st century fratricide
Concrete inferno
Spiritual void

[Chorus]
In necropolis
YouÂ´re walking dead-dead-dead
Wake up and rise
From the dead-dead-dead

Programmed to produce
Slave to survive
Machines of flesh and blood
Follow illusions
Of paradise lost
Faith only keeps you alive

[Chorus x2]
