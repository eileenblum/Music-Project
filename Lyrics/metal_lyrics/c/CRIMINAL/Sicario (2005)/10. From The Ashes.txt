Passion and suffering
A thousand deaths
I've diead before
Leper, pariah
Fallen from grace
Carry the cross

New life arise from pain

[Chorus]
Reborn, I rise
From the ashes of time

Beaten and scared
I walked through hell
And I saw god
Rotten black heart
Spit it out, tear it apart

New life arise from pain

[Chorus]

As I walk through the shadow
Of the valley of death, I see no light
But the flames of hate
Like phoenix from the ashes
I return to this world, wounds healed
But the scars are not gone
