I see black of the future of mankind
No redemption in sight
One step closer to the abyss
Never looking back
Down the path of self immolation
Suicidal breed
History repeats itself
Circle of insanity

[Chorus]
The root of all evil
Original sin
The root of all evil
Unrelenting enemy within
The root of all evil
A primitive drive
The root of all evil
Unrepenting demon inside

Jesus christ had a moment of doubt
For the flesh is weak
We would trade a minute of pleasure
For life in eternity
Deliver us into temptation
It's our cross to bear
Absolution just an illusion
We're forever enslaved

[Chorus]
