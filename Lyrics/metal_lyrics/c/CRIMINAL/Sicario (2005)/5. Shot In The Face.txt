Through valleys
And mountains
Decisive campaign
Forces moving
Towards their aim
Target weak spots
Resistance breaks
Bio-weapon stockpiles
Spitting their hate

Invade penetrate
Move in fast
Intrude infiltrate
Defenses collapse
Blood filled trenches
Troops endeterred
Toxic fumes fill the air
The stench of death

[Bridge]
One on one fighting
Battle is racing
Both sides are mourning
The end is coming

[Chorus]
The end of the game
You're shot in the face

[Chorus]

Ambushed from behind
Dying in the mud
Heads split open
Gushing with blood
Comrades brothers
Die in your hands
Last man standing
Clean up the mess

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
