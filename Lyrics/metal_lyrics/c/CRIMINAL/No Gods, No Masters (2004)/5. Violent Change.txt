New life
New blood
The urge rages
Deep inside

Nothing's true
All is lies
Got to server
Mental ties

[Chorus:]
Forget what you believe
Break those chains
Destruction of the past
Violent change

No gods
No masters
The pain within
Feeds your strength

Love to hate
Destroy to create
Build on ruins
Of old faith

[Chorus]
