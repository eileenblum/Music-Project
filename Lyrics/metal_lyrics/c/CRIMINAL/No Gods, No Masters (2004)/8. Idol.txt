Fallen Idol
Old man. Scorned
Distrust. Blackmail
Painful Growth

[Chorus:]
I belong to you
I was torn from
Your flesh
I become you
Now I see through
Your eyes

Rebel angel
Serves no master
Looks back guilty
Fought and lost

[Chorus]

Fear not
Let go
Free your soul

Just like you
You'll live on
In the life of the son
Of my son
