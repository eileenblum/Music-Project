Ask yourself
Ever put your faith
In a machine
Ever prayed to silicon
Or a static screen
Science as a guiding light
Will not shine eternally
Down with technology
And what little
Future I see

[Chorus:]
We have failed
Addicted
Dependent
Enslaved

Ask yourself
Ever regressed
To a remote past
At rudimentary altars
Adoring primitive gods
Where is your strength now
Your instinct to survive
Is there hope for us
With machines ruling
Our lives

[Chorus x4]
