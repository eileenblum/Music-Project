I'm just a child
In an aging world
Ready to explode
To fuck you all

Exiled
Alien
Outcast

I'm the enemy
Every mothers fear
Too young to die
Too old to care

Exiled
Alien
Outcast

[Chorus (x2):]
Look at me
What I've become
Hersey
I'll bow to none

Lighting up the sky
In a burning rage
Being crushed alive
By the wheels of fate
Sniffing through the dirt
Seeking inspiration
Saying my last prayer
To a loaded gun

Have I gone insane
What am I saying

Chasing my own tail
Like a dog on cocaine
Vomiting words
To relive the pain
Shooting my shadow
Before it gets real
Laughing in your face
Then I disappear

Have I gone insane
What am I saying

[Chorus x2]
