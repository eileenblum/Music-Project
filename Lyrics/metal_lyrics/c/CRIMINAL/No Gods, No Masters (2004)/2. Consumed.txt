We are what we own
A faceless crowd
Our collective soul
Sold cheap

Believing what we see
Hero Mentality
Generation Of human sheep

Slaves of the machine
Material beings
These prefab identities

Subconscious tyranny
Domination
Money idolatry

[Chorus:]
Rotten to the core
Drowning in our wealth
We still want more

Consumed or de consumed

Exploitation
Conscience erased
Progress at any cost

Worthless lives
Sacrificed
For the chosen few

Life is greed
Greed breeds guilt
Guilt is bought and sold

Disintegrating minds
Dead inside
Still we think we're alive

[Chorus]

Consume or consumed
Possess or be possessed
