Everything's falling
This is the end
Structures collapsing
Your little life is erased

Everyone's dying
You thought you were safe
How could it happen
Your dream of life was
Betrayed

Decay
Corrosion
Downfall
Oblivion

Time to wake up
There's no way back
It's you and it's me
And it's us
None to blame
Makes no sense
Downward we go now
We burn

Burn
Burn
Burn
