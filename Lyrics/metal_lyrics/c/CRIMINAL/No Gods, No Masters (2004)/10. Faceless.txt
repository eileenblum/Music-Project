Cold white room
Stench of death
Why are we here
Nobody knows

Faceless
Uniformed
Dehumanized

[Chorus:]
Why am I here
In this nightmare within
Why am I here
In this life in this skin

Senseless ritual
Meaningless moves
Empty faces
Hollow eyes

Faceless
Uniformed
Dehumanized

[Chorus]

Set me free
Let me be
Set me free
Let me be

[Chorus x2]

Set me free
Let me be
Set me free
Let me be
