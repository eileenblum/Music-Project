Dark time
Black out
Fighting the urge to sleep
Chemically deep

[Chorus:]
Tear apart
Show you all
The other side
The dark half

New image
For mankind
Playing god
replacing god

[Chorus]

Now you will see
What I've become
Twisted circuitry
Mockery of god
Skin and bone
Mind of stone
Artificially born

You broke my wings
Before I could fly
D.N.A fails
With this fading life
Given it all
Now I've nothing left
See you in hell

Recreation
of your vision
Living flesh
Manipulation

[Chorus]

Now you will see
