Self inflicted pain
A wasted life
A restless soul insane
No return
Gone too far
No one else left to blame

[Chorus:]
Fade away
Die away
From this life of misery
Fade away
Die away
Only death will make you free

Once I was free
Savage and ready to kill
In my blood
All the tides
Of all times gone by

[Chorus]

Distorted shadows
Memories haunt me
Tormented faces
Demons surround me

Life still alive
New days are bleeding
The skies
No return
No regrets
Until the end of my times

[Chorus]
