She screamed you're a monster, but she was the one who lied.
I spit in her face, she wasted her life anyways.
Are you fucking blind? Look into my eyes and see what you really fucking are.

No one makes it out alive.

I see this world for what it really is. A waste. It's concentrated hate.
I see right through your fucking act, this is life not a play.
Grow the fuck up and get fucking out.
Truth was never in your vocabulary.
You are scum just some shit at the bottom of the gutter.

I will watch you break down to your fucking knees and beg me for mercy.
