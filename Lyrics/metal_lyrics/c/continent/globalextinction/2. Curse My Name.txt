Your living a nightmare of horrors beyond anything imaginable.
Crawl out of your slumbers. Because this is deja vu.
I will destroy everything around you.
Any questions asked and I'll slit your fucking throat, do you think this is a joke?
I'm a force to be reckoned with but you don't know my name.

You don't know my fucking name.

You'll scream loud enough to wake the dead, but you'll be joining them soon.
So how's that burning love between your legs? You filthy whore, no one is saving you now.
Pray to your God and tell him I don't give a fuck about what I do to his children.
So curse my fucking name you never knew me.
This world is desperate and falling.

You will lie in the gutter and pray to a God you've never seen before.
This world has never been what you've wanted.
Life isn't a mystery.

Curse my name.
