Under a Godless sky I will prevail. Your Lord is not mine.

I believe in life, not a God of lies.
Your like rests in a story about Jesus I-don't-give-a-fuck.
So when you ask me where is your faith?
I'll reply in the gutter with your life.

Pray to your God and receive nothing, pray to your God and get nothing at all.

So take all your golden crosses. How much has been shed in your Lords name?
Under a Godless sky, your Lord is not mine.

You can bury yourself.

I believe in life, not some God of lies.
I believe in life not your fucking story book.
