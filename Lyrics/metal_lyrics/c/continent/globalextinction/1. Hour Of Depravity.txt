I'm left with blood and sand.
How cruel are the waves, crashing down on me? I'm left a castaway.
I see my reflection in the ocean and I'm left wasting away from everything you've given to me.
Watch me die.
How cruel is the ocean crashing down on me? I'm left a castaway.
You will watch me die, and I will watch your lungs fill with the ocean.
