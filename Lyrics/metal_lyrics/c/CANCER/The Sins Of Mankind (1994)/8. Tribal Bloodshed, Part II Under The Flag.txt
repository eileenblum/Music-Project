We canât hide from the fate that wails
Running blind, into a void of hate
Ride the wave, as the time is near
Follow the passions of your greatest fear

Shocked by the sights of the past defeats
Try to fight against these hypocrites

Under the flag
Divided the hate
Led by the lies
Of the ruling state

Decriminalize
Truth is hard to hide
Rise up, face reality
Dissension at their fallacy

Under the flag
Divided the hate
Led by the lies
Of the ruling state

Puzzled visions lead the masses on
Confused minds, now the truth is gone
Banner of tears, hanging from the sky
Nobody hears as the masses cry

Under the flag
Divided the hate
Led by the lies
Of the ruling state
