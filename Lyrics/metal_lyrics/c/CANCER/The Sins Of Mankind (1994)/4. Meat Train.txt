Mass of people underground
In their way
Swallowed by a tunnel of doom
And decay
Blood dripping all around
On a train
Murdered in a tasteless sense
Sordid domain

Subway of terror
Slaughter forever
Privileged with fear
Donât deny
Carriage of carnage
Life disinherit
Mind numbing damage
Elders cry

Plunging in a darkened tube of hate
Murder stalks our elderâs game
Human fate
Jubilant of what is dead
They rejoice
Train expires to a stop
And cover up

Subway of terror
Slaughter forever
Privileged with fear
Donât deny
Carriage of carnage
Life disinherit
Mind numbing damage
Elders cry

Try to hide â rails divide
Just a taste â cadavers waste

Subway of terror
Slaughter forever
Privileged with fear
Donât deny
Carriage of carnage
Life disinherit
Mind numbing damage
Elders cry
