Reaching for salvation
Prolonged life demarcate
Delude them of some pride
Hide away their dignity
Compassionate rules are called for
Stop the pain and cruelty
Let nature take itâs course
Release a life of misery

Playing god
The only way
Make the choice
Hard to say?

Locked in a sense of insanity
The only escape, the choice they make
Deathâs a blessing in disguise
Give me the right to their demise
Are red ridden lives worth living?
Or is it existing?
Suffering agony for years
Causing kin more pain and tears

Answer the facts
Laws should change
If the drugs donât work
Relinquish the pain

Playing god
The only way
Make the choice
Hard to say?
