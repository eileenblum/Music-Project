I wait for darkness to arrive, I dream of pain
I cherish thoughts, seduction that awaits

My name is God, immortal dog
My life is blood, death is love
Bring forth a plague, mace of sins
As I unleash the horrors within
My faith is pure, some think not
I have the taste, submit to you all
Resist me now, receive your fate
Your foolish mind has no escape

Embrace with me
Share a dream
Divine wisdom and life
Destroy the weak
Shatter the meek
Let your mind decide

Donât let your mind
Weaken like the rest
Reject their faith
Immortality is the only way

My name is God, immortal dog
My life is blood, death is love
Bring forth a plague, mace of sin
As I unleash the horrors within
My faith is pure, some think not
I have taste, submit to you all
Resist me now, receive your fate
Your foolish mind, has no escape

Embrace with me
Share a dream
Divine wisdom and life
Destroy the weak
Shatter the meek
Let your mind decide

Embrace with me
Share a dream
Divine wisdom and life
Destroy the weak
Shatter the meek
Let your mind decide
