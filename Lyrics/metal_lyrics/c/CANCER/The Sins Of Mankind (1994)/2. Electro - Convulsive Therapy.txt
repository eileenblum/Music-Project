Arguments, conflicting views inside his mind
Simplified, electro-convulsive therapy
Infertile, controlling drugs like Melleril
No trust, humanityâs been misunderstood

What it wrong? What is right?
War inside his mind
Losing sense of reality
Truth is hard to find
What it wrong? What is right?
War inside his mind
Losing sense of reality
Truth is hard to find

Justify visions of the past
No one understands
Schizophrenic minds

Electro-convulsive therapy

Fantasy, a word he canât define
Voices, difficult to tell apart
Electrodes, shocking, convulsive pain
Stelazine, itâs so strong, it slows you down

What it wrong? What is right?
War inside his mind
Losing sense of reality
Truth is hard to find
What it wrong? What is right?
War inside his mind
Losing sense of reality
Truth is hard to find

Justify visions of the past
No one understands
Schizophrenic minds
