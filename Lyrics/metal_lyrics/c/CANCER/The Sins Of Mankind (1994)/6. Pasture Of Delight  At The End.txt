Risen from below, your lifeâs last command
Struggling with my thoughts
Mourning slowly down
Destiny to find, pasture of delights
Navigated course
Body and mind divorce

Is this the end?
Eager to find
The secret of taste, eternal life
At deathâs door
Lifeâs dismay
Poisoned forever, decay

See the void of light, tempts me with desire
My soul reclines
Frantic and weak
Images of the past, elude my mind
Emotions now distort
Sins that I have shed

Is this the end?
Eager to find
The secret of taste, eternal life
At deathâs door
Lifeâs dismay
Poisoned forever, decay

Shattered in life
You canât see it anymore
Salvation is near
You walk right through the door

Is this the end?
Eager to find
The secret of taste, eternal life
At deathâs door
Lifeâs dismay
Poisoned forever, decay
