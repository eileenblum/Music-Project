All through life they try to hide
Abhorrent lies, misguided pride
Chastise deviant minds
Guided by misplaced hate

Superior thoughts to nations wide
Expurgate those wrong in their eyes
Without the knowledge how others survive
Corruptly enforced
Pathetic disguise

Suffer today, for our sins
Suffer the way that we live
Suffer today, for our sins
Suffer the way that we live

We pay the price for the narrow minded
Social unrest, boundaries divided
Lessons to learn from the past
Wars have shown, mankind wonât last

Suffer today, for our sins
Suffer the way that we live
Suffer today, for our sins
Suffer the way that we live

Suffer
