Let me out here, burning int his hell
My cascet breathes a stench of burning flesh
Incinerating pain, left to scorching domain
My body is too far gone, to the hell of where it belongs
My testimony ashes of my death
The terror that locks me in
My testimony to be burned alive
Condemned to this burning cascet

Forced into a grave
To die in a miserable cave
Slowly I now fry
I'm assured that I will die
Who is now to blame
As I burn in pain
I scream my last breath
Ashes are only left
