Mercenary men, knock you dead
Killing for a living, is what is said
Disposing of people, blood money pays
Gruesome executions, are used this waty
Gruesome tasks
Slaughters made
They create
Screams of pain

Limbs cut off, sliced to death
Stomach ripped open, no life left
Glistening drops, of butchery
Their salvation, misery

The blood of men is spilled to be
payed with cash
When they die the payment is made
Their salvation, misery

Shattered lives are lost
Crimes of death do cost
Death forgotten too fast
The pain of the past
