Screams of pain, haunt the night
Cadavers burning, oh so bright
left to die, horrible death
Now awaiting, hell's breath
Heaps of bodies
Pilled ten high
Sixteen more wait to die
Human flesh burning meat
Corpse fire, at our feet

Burning stench, of skin and bones
Fiery victims, punished souls
Intense heat, is what awaits
Burnt to death, is your fate

Naked flame, gasoline
No tomorrow, no more dreams
Charred bodies, Fried meat
To burn in hell, such a treat
