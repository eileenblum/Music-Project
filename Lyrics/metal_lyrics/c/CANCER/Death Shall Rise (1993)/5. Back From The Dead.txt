Slowly injecting the fluid of pain
Bringing the corpse back to life
Nerves now awake violently
The serum now has worked
Inject to the brain, going insane
Body pulsating, back from the dead
Death's awakening, stage by stage
Including the pain, back from the dead
Under the knife, bring back to life
Bad mistake, back from the dead
Seen now what's done, his death's begun
The dead have won, back from the dead

Reaching to kill, creator of life
Ejecting the unwanted reprise,br&gt; Going insane and out of control
Defy the fate of science

Because the fluid took effect
The corpse will rise
Trying to cheat on nature
He's going to die

Slowly injecting the fluid of pain
Bringing the corpse back to life
Try to create something to love
Perfectly formed in his eyes
