Old man, sick in the head
Daughter's children on his bed
Twisted ways, rules his life
Forging deceit, bred to lie
From the decades, he has lived
He's never stopped, where it begins
rapes his family, when they
Are young, hoping they would
Carry on
keeping in the family
Human disgrace
The younger ones first
He thinks nobody minds

Tasteless incest
Senseless lust
Satisfiction, sickening trust
Led to believe, that it's alright
Young boy cries, into the night
He will never, change his way
When he's dead, he may repay
Hate is burning, in young eyes
When they're older, evil will rise
