Acid spilling all around
Flesh decaying falling down
(Your) criminal friends have left you now
Death greets you with gory hands

Into the acid
Into the acid

Eyes gone yellow, facial burns
Limbs rotting, terrible pain
Vomiting guts, bones decay
Your intestines break and spray

Time to see what is done to me
Contamination of my body

Into the acid...
