Living on a knife's edge
(For) a thousand years we have known
Destruction in a nuclear sense
As now time will cease to flow
Warheads beckoning
Armageddon with behold
As the world dies
People regret their unholy faults

Population extermination, millions to die
As the dust settles over death
Legacy (of) humanity, extinct mankind
Terrible sight catastrophe

Imminent catastrophe...

Bodies lie entombed
In a radiation pit
Festering from open wounds
Blood pouring from your soul
Plunged into darkness
You can see there is no light
Satan you have just met
No eternal life

Population extermination, millions to die
As the dust settles over death
Legacy (of) humanity, extinct mankind
Terrible sight catastrophe

Imminent catastrophe...
