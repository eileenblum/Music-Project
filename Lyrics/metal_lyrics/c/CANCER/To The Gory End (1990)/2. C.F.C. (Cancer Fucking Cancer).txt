Gather round all to see, reborn misery
Doctors stand in my way, my path to death

Ready to die, take your last breath
Rotting corpse, cancer fucking cancer

Cancered guts spilled out (with) therapy
Chemical injections, lab poisons, infections

Ready to die, take your last breath
Rotting corpse, cancer fucking cancer

Praying for death as you can see your life fading
Lying there (in a) terrible state as (the) cancer's growing

Ready to die, take your last breath
Rotting corpse, cancer fucking cancer...
