Die Die

Running through the night, your screams are my delight
Torture is my game, fucking you insane
Warped is my brain, people I do maim
Breaking bones for fun, see the bleeding run

Stabbing, I mutilate, die die
Bodies filled with hate
Ripping out your soul, die die
Burning in hell's hole
Smashing through your skull, die die
Pulling entrails from
Bleeding carcass in hell, die die
(The) Devil I do tell

Killing and making pain, death is my game
Terror sure to find deep (with)in your mind

Stabbing, I mutilate, die die
Bodies filled with hate
Ripping out your soul, die die
Burning in hell's hole
Smashing through your skull, die die
Pulling entrails from
Bleeding carcass in hell, die die
Devil I do tell

Ripping flesh from bone, loosing all control
Slaughtering innocent victims, breaking holy rules
Bastard of the world, killing all the time
People are to rip, I never, never sleep

Die...

Stabbing, I mutilate, die die
Bodies filled with hate
Ripping out your soul, die die
Burning in hell's hole
Smashing through your skull, die die
Pulling entrails from
Bleeding carcass in hell, die die
Devil I do tell

Die !
