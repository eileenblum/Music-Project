He stalks the night for his prey
He'll maim and kill while you pray

Legacy of his tragedy
Born to kill for his mother's sins
Twisted mind living to kill
Now you'll die, blood will spill

Another victim hacked to death
No warning when he'll strike

Legacy of his tragedy
Born to kill for his mother's sins
Twisted mind living to kill
Now you'll die, blood will spill

The body count continues...

He terrorizes through innocence
As you see another death

Legacy of his tragedy
Born to kill for his mother's sins
Twisted mind living to kill
Now you'll die, blood will spill
