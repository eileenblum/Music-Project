Branded with a reward on his head
Ash flees through the night
Scattering words of unholy sin
Down trodden in mankind
Punished through humiliation
Against the religious type
Now it's time to pay the price
As you wait to die

See you run in fear
False names now appear
Protected by confessions
Hide from (the) Witch hunt

Though your life is ruined now
People won't forgive
Now you're in reality
Your pressures won't give
Fuck(ing) your mind with paranoid
But you'll never sleep
Waiting for a time to come
But you know you won't be free

See you run in fear
False names now appear
Protected by confessions
Hide from witch hunt
