Hooks cutting through your flesh
No comparison of pleasure and pain
Black box, it's (a) gory treat
Mutilation from hell

To the gory end, as they make you ride the blade
To the gory end, as your life will now fade

Crave for blood, unnatural greed
Stuck in hell forever more
Ultimate pain, blooded corpse
Living memory known deceased

To the gory end, as they make you ride the blade
To the gory end, as your life will now fade

See the masters of gore
Stricken with pain in Hell

Hooks cutting through your flesh
No comparison of pleasure and pain
Black box, (is a) gory treat
Mutilation from hell

To the gory end, as they make you ride the blade
To the gory end, as your life will now fade

Crave for blood, unnatural greed
Stuck in hell forever more
Ultimate pain, blooded corpse
Living memory known deceased
