I am waiting in this cell
Thinking of killings I was supposed to have done

See them build that wooden frame
As I wait to die
Morbid thoughts hang around my neck
Sentenced to the gallows

See them coming to take me
I climb the staircase into Hell

Visions of the past sweep my brain
(As) the lever is pulled, I love the pain

See them build that wooden frame
As I wait to die
Morbid thoughts hang around my neck
Sentenced to the gallows
