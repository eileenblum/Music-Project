Let's have a war!
Are you ready?

A bomb hits the city, all life instantly vaporized
But I'm not so fortunate burning right before my eyes
Stumbling I trip over pieces of descending flesh
Leaving a pile of a smoldering humanoid mess

Radiation coming in waves
Leading me to a nuclear grave

Are you ready?
Will you be?
Will you fight World War Three?
Are you ready?
Are you sure?
Will you fight World War Four?

Humanity somehow stood up on its mutated feet
Reeling with pride man just would not accept his defeat
Into the missiles deadly disease and poison gas
Launching them off terracidal journey kills the last

Vomiting blood, I choke on my tongue
The gas from above is filling my lungs

Are you ready?
Will you be?
Will you fight World War Three?
Are you ready?
Are you sure?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight World War Four?

We hate this planet.

Are you ready?

Silence and darkness, the species of man is extinct
The boiling oceans into which the continents sink
Gravity gone, the moon collides with a dead earth
Flaming world out of orbit flying into deep space

Prey for your death
'Cause if you survive
You'll die in pain
In World War Five

Are you ready?
Will you be?
Will you fight World War Three?
Are you ready?
Are you sure?
Will you fight World War Four?

Let's go!

Are you ready?
Will you be?
Will you fight World War Three?
Are you ready?
Are you sure?
Will you fight?
Will you fight?
Will you fight World War Four?
