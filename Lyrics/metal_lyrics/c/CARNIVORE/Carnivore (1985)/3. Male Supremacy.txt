I live to war it's in my blood if I want it I take
the men I've killed the children slaves
and all the woman I've raped
between my legs I've got what it takes to be called a man
fighting, feasting, fucking all I can
moonlight on horseback till death we will ride
northern winds pushing us towards suicide
Mars god of war masturbating in rage
wild libido I've freed from its cage

Male Supremacy

I eat the brains from my enemy's head
I proudly wear their scalps
I burn their towns to the ground to me the prisoners bow
muscle, sweat, long hair and dirt leather, fur and chains
my uniform torn and worn covered with blood stains
testosterone mates with adrenaline
bearing a son of insane aggression
woman will never know or understand
the power men feel to kill with their hands

After the war I come home weak and sore
I fall into your arms
we lie by the fire
you feed my desire with me safe and warm
outside the wind blows cold
inside the embers glow shelter from the storm

Years been away I fought night and day
for my land and my king
woman it's true
I do battle for you, you my everything
when on the fur I make love to her
how her body sings
