The atom germ wars gone precipitate genetic mutation
Social degeneration
Creatures born of malignant science, the children of technology
Plutonium anthropology

Who will cleanse the mess left by the past
Who will expurgate the scared cytoplasm
To rid the earth of abomination
I proclaim my nomination
As the thermonuclear warrior

Strands of malformed DNA strangulate our future
Chromosomal executioners
Recessive traits for lifetimes hidden emerge through evolution
Facilitate cellular revolution

Who will cleanse the mess left by the past
Who will expurgate the scared cytoplasm
To rid the earth of abomination
I proclaim my nomination
As the thermonuclear warrior

I seek the dying, sick and deformed
All who would taint the species
Stabbing and choking and burning
And drowning exterminate subhuman feces
Man has bred his ancestors,
A sort of human pollution
To every problem an answer must lie
To this I have a solution

Crush, kill, destroy
I will smash any resistance
Crush, kill, destroy
The reason for my divine existence

You may ask what's right have I to take human life this way
Well I'm in control I make the rules and I don't need your OK
Genocide is my way of life it's a fact I will not hide
The millions I've killed to sterilize euthanasia's not homicide

Crush, kill, destroy
I will not tolerate imperfection
Crush, kill, destroy
I will impede the spread of infection

Let's go
