God looked down from heaven shook his head and wept
His flock had gone astray wolves mingling with sheep
You tried to save man once by sending down a son
But the bastards nailed him up
And laughed at what they'd done

You gang raped mother nature I love a virgins cry
Blood poured from the earth she suffered and she died
Rusty scissors still in hand you castrated father time
Feed his balls to the hounds that drink his cum like wine

God Is Dead

You've taken all my precious gifts
I gave unto you life from my breath
You a product of my love
Your gratitude shown in my death

God is dead
God is dead

The devil has taken your spirit
Keeps it chained up in the night
Tells you that evil is good
But you will never see the light

Because god is dead
God is dead
God is dead

Eat his body, drink his blood
Then we'll sing our song of love

Now you come crawling on your hands and knees
You beg for forgiveness suck me till I bleed
And for your transgressions heretical blasphemy
The punishment is damnation you'll burn interminably

Look what you've done to nature
And what you 've done to time
There's no more room in hell
You're sinners, you steal what is mine

God is dead
God is dead

Now the dead walk the earth
There's nowhere to hide
The devil and his disciples
Rejoice my suicide

God is dead
God is dead

(god is dead
God is dead)
