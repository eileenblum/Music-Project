We rule the streets after dark fast silent like a shark
The twelve hundred I got between my knees
my hog helps me to spread the disease
People do not understand hair and leather 
But I am telling you I could not be living better
I do not fear nothing with my brothers on my side fuck with us and it is suicide

Live your life by your will learn to be an animal
by the light of the moon beware the legion of doom
Live your life by your will learn to be an animal
By the light of the moon beware the legion of doom

We only ask to be left alone having good times getting stoned
Pulling some broad and guzzling buds riding high into the sun
to serve in heaven might suit some wall
me and the boys would rather rule in hell
Looking for trouble I am warning you
You will be dealing with the casket crew

Busting heads breaking legs smashing faces spreading hate screaming out this cannot be real
Broken bottles chains and knifes bats and pipes to end your life crush you beneath my wheels
And of course no regret give me freedom or give me death you are flirting with disaster
Riding wild running free no one is going govern me I was born my own master
