They live beneath the ruined city, call the subways home
anxiously wait to see the sun and a land as of yet unknown
gone below to escape the death of the nuclear winter
ice and darkness due penance for the sinners

six generations 200 years later
their ancestors crawl from their holes
hungry and frightened and barely surviving
they're tired of living like moles
up on the surface a fate worse
than dying meeting the end of the food chain
teeth yielding pain

I sense that living human beings dwell below my feet
an important source of protein, you are what you eat
post Armageddon, neo-barbaric, the nuclear warriors do battle
to satiate our hunger we breed human beings as cattle

hunting in packs ready for the attack
we eat our prey raw-rabid animals
frothing and ripping the carcass
we're stripping our own yes we're cannibals
eat or eaten beat or beaten
I am on my life rest assure a predator

broken splintered bones, boiling blood
torn and bleeding skin
blackened burning flesh, melting fat
amputated limbs

eviscerated, lungs torn out
heart ripped from the chest
decapitated, a meal of
vagina and breasts

Eyes plucked from sockets, gaping holes
through which pick the brains
phlebophilia love of blood
life spills from the veins

I detect the scent of prey by
her menstruation
you have been chosen the main course
Congratulations!

Bon appetite
