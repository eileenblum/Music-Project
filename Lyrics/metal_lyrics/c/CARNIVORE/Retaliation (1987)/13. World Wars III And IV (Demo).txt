[Reissue Track]A bomb hits the city all life instantly vaporized 
But I'm not so fortunate burning right before my eyes 
Stumbling I trip over pieces of descending flesh 
Leaving a pile of smouldering humanoid mess 
Radiation coming in waves 
Leading me to a nuclear grave 

Are you ready will you be 
Will you fight World War three
Are you ready are you sure 
Will you fight World War four

Humanity somehow stood up on its mutated feet 
Reeling with pride man just would not accept his defeat 
Into the missiles deadly disease and poison gas 
Launching them off terracidal journey kills the last 
Vomiting blood I choke on my tongue 
The gas from above is filling my lungs 

Silence and darkness the species of man is extinct 
The boiling oceans into which the continents sink 
Gravity gone the moon collides with a dead earth 
Flaming world out of orbit flying into deep space 
Prey for your death if you survive 
you will die in pain in world war five
