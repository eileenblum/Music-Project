This is the United States of America
And you got a right to hate who you want
So let's start busting heads

Black against white
Yellow versus red
The fighting won't stop
Until we're dead
Until we're all dead

Burning, looting riots destroy the masses
Nightfall brings death, city reduced to ashes

Don't call me your brother
'Cause I ain't your fuckin' brother
We fell from different cunts
And your skin, your skin's an ugly color

Race war
We're going to a race war
Hate war
We're going to a hate war

Prejudicial homicide

Bloodshed, rampage, torture is not subsiding
Chaos, bedlam, violent ethnic uprising

Muslims against Christians
And the Arabs versus Jews
The Catholics and Protestants
No one wins, we all lose

Race war
We're going to a race war
Hate war
We're going to a hate war

Everybody's gonna die

Xenophobic tendencies
Instilled in us at birth
Our mislabelled racism
Hostilities getting worse
Accept the fact my distant cousin
We cannot live in peace
Isolated environments
May just be the key

Human beings suspicious
Soon fear grows to hate
We'll have each other by the throat
When forced to integrate
Mothers watch their children die
At each other's hand
Cain and Abel set the course
Ethnocentric command

Race war
Hate war
Race war

You can run but you can't hide
