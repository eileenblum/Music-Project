You don't like the clothes I wear
I'll shave my head or grow my hair
What makes you look over here
What are...?

You don't like the clothes I wear
I'll shave my head or grow my hair
What makes you look over here
What are you queer?

Suck my dick [3x]

You call my music sonic poison
Turn it down it's annoying
But it gives me pleasure to aggravate
The ones I hate

Suck my dick [3x]

Start sucking.
I don't let go.

Walking down the streets a bottle grazes off your head
From a window someone laughing spitting on your head
Find a weapon, bash their skulls, don't they make you sick?
Kill these fucking pricks now

Skins and bangers joining fight as one
Those who persecute battle 'til they've won
Tired of being pressured to join their plastic army
You conforming clones will be sorry

Suck
I won't change for anyone
My
Keep fighting 'til I'm done
Dick
I got a right to be myself
And you can go fuck yourself
