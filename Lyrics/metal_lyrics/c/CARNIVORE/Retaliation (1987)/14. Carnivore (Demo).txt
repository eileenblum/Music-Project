[Reissue Track]Drool dripping out my tongue hanging south saliva flowing free
My eyes full of lust my balls going to bust give yourself to me
Thirst I cannot quench come here you wench
There is something that I need

Carnivore I'm a meat eater
Carnivore I'd like to meet ya
Carnivore I know I'll reach ya

The hunger I feel makes you a meal
Girl you sure taste sweet by my hair
Pull me there guide me to your treat
Spread your legs I will seed your eggs feel me deep

Lick me she begged she pulled
Down my head I love to eat pussy
A taste so fine like sweet april wine
I would not trade for any money
Did you cum I eat and run I live for sodomy
