[originally by Jimi Hendrix]Â 
Manic depression is touching my soul
I know what I want but I just don't know
How to, go about gettin' it
Feeling sweet feeling,
Drips from my fingers, my fingers
Manic depression is catchin' my soul

Woman so hot, the sweet cause in vainÂ 
We make love, we break love
It's all the same
[When it's, when it's over, mama]
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

Well, I think I'll go kill myself
And go on down, down, down,
All the way down
There really ain't no use in me hanging around
I gotta get out

Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess
