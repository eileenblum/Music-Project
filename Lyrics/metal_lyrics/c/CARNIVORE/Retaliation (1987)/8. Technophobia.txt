You fear change and all that is new
Stand in the way of progress
Like primitive man afraid of fire
Until he explored its many uses

The power of the atom at our disposal
Yet it's called unsafe
Nuclear energy so clean and pure
Your ignorance is a disgrace

Do not resist
It is your destiny
Have we not all become
The children of technology?

Holding your fate in a magnetic grip
Of all your irrational fears
The shadow of machinery cast upon the flesh of man
Blood, sweat and gears

The robots of dawn offsprings of industry
Spot you in the cobalt blue light
One fell swoop and you've become a memory
Away with your intrusive life

Into the reactor!

You worship a dead man hung with nails
Only a fool would die for the sins of humanity
On your knees before electronics
Let's replace this religious insanity

Tear down the churches and spit on their grounds
Build there the holy reactors
Give us the children science and math
In place of bibles and pastors

You bleeding heart liberals who oppose the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]
Must be compelled to retire
You serve only as obstacles and should be used
To fuel the nuclear pyre

Do not resist
For it is your destiny
Have we all simply become the children...
The children of technology
