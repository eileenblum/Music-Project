Monkey wrench in my hand
In my groin a swollen gland
Tonight perform brain surgery
Or some gynecology
Clock work orange fast be coming
Rampant streets gangs overrunning
After darkness raging war
What do they keep living for?
Sex and violence

Sex and violence

I love to hear your scream in vain
Pattered blood and semen stains
Rape and murder lesson learned
Meaning of life? - Pain and sperm
Prey upon the old and the helpless
Reconditioning is useless
Ultra-violent off springs of gore
What do they keep living for
Sex and violence

If you can't eat it or fuck it then kill it!

Sexual deviation
Religious desecration
Civil mutilation
Violent procreation

Bleed for me

Sex and violence
Sex and violence

Take it easy.
