I'm suffering from depression
The anger turned within
What do I gain for all my pain
Perhaps a seat in heaven?

Check it out.

Don't do what you want
Do what you're taught is right
Your life is built on paranoia and guilt
Don't forget your Valium tonight

The agony I must endure
My mind is painful and swells
The punishment for what I've done
Is forever the pains of Hell

How come what is natural
Has to be a sin?
Why would God give me this urge
If I cannot give in?

They say don't give up
That Jesus loves me
But there's something he doesn't forgive
I know I have sinned
And am therefore worthless
And I don't deserve to live

I went down to my basement
Confused and depressed
Put Black Sabbath on
Razor blade in hand
A Wilkinson I think
Ten slashes on each arm

My only wrong doing
Was being born human
And following my instincts

I never was happy
I never was sane
So I shall be extinct

The growing pool of crimson at last
I am pure witness my sanguines penance

I don't need anyone
My soul's been set free
Death is total independence

Stand up straight
Stomach in
Shoulders back
Sound off
