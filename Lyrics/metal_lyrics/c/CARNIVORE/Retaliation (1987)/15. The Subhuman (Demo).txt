[Reissue Track]Born of snow and ice 
On a windswept cycloscape
As the son of modern science 
The Freon neonate
Cross the frozen tundra 
Each step a country mile
Frigid vapor, glacial breath 
A liquid oxygen smile

Take my hand and travel north 
The weather, there is cool
Heliocaustic rays of sunlight  
Blind the eyes of this fool
Jack Frost foaming from the mouth 
Attacking exposed flesh
Becomes my jelled partner 
At light where art thou best

Slick blue skin reflects the stars 
The temperature below zero
Macromesomorphatite 
Come to me an arctic hero!
Blizzards taking life give death 
Flaccid northern drift
Winter tempests, bring forth the cold 
Frigid apocalypse
Would you welcome the subhuman
A warm welcome for the subhuman

The ice man cometh 
She walks alone 
On a cold winter's night
As I come up from behind
My icicle phallus penetrates deeply 
So cold it will cauterize
Stalactited blood  
Drips from my pores
Her skin between my teeth 
Relieved of her life
A warm heart still beating 
Becomes a delicious treat

I possess the strength 
Of one hundred thousand glaciers
Triumphantly I stride far beyond 
The broken laws of nature
Every storm extends my life 
A century or longer
That which does not destroy me 
Only makes me stronger
Cryanthropic submarine  
Hydrophiliac
My sanguineous appetite 
Parthenophagiac
Would you welcome the subhuman
A warm welcome for the subhuman
