Listen to this all you douche bags
It's time that we laid down the law
We're tired of taking your shit
And we ain't gonna take it no more

[Chorus:]
Be prepared to fight and die
So that we may be free
U.S.A. for U.S.A., U.S.A!
And if you don't like it here
Then pack your shit and leave
U.S.A for U.S.A., U.S.A!
Our forefathers died in war
So that you could live better
U.S.A for U.S.A, U.S.A!
We at least owe it to them
To keep the stars and stripes forever
USA for USA, USA!

Planting bombs on planes
Blowing up our ships
Kill our kids and women
Find these dickless slobs
Hang them by the scrotum
Let's end the terrorism

You think yourself a God
Would follow to the death
A spineless yellow faggot
A bunch of stinking slobs
Hiding behind masks
Show yourself ya maggot

United we stand
Divided we fall
And that's the way it's gonna be
Don't ever forget
All the soldiers who died for liberty

All the bullshit countries
Who think they'll beat the giant
World peace in upheaval
We'll nuke 'em to the stone-age
Send the message clear
Ya don't fuck with the eagle

[Chorus]
