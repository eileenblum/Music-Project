until you know grief
you have not seen
the depths that we have been in
no comparison
to the depths that will reveal

you will hear nothing
that shouldn't be passed on
you will have a taste
of bitterness on your tongue
only to return to it
by the sweet odour

remorse and it is undone

I put myself on the stand
and have reached a verdict
