"Connection after a long period of silence, your cold eyes spoke to me without words.
Agony was present. I understood it all along."

I heard a silent whisper from the past - eight years of isolation.
In silence the demons besieged you.
Darkened eyes of retribution.

Stormriding through the bleakest on a black horse.
Zest for life has died in me.

My life, the monolith of loneliness.
Fallen am I Lord. Make me complete again.
