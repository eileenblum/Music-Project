Look back now, reflect the past
Blind conqueror practice
Years of mass fever
Still breathing denial
Weighing the words of lethal leaders
Can you walk by the bell tower
See black and pace back?

Shield your children in their time of need?
Washing their feet while calling halt to your breed
Pour down all your lack of mercy by giving them freedom in a cage
Hoist the flags of the past, stay in lead to face the gauntlet

Counting hours
Waiting for growing out
Now free to think
Far from false reason
Turning domes to serving blossom
Divine divide
Graceful and right
