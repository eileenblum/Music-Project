Meaning lost along the way yet wheels grind on
Headfirst towards an early grave - still going strong?
Got caught having an escapade with the horns

You depend on your wings like a bird
Refuse to come across with what's truly inner
Crippled, washed upon the shore
You flew far too high while reaching for the ultimate relief
That never came your way

Now grow apart from it
Release the weight
It's dead weight all the same

Did you ever come to think of it?
The time you've spent away from the nest?

The dilemma of harmony
Dare to create a path out of the shade

Descendants adapt
Preconceived foundations cast
Now waiting in line to adopt a lifetime in chains
