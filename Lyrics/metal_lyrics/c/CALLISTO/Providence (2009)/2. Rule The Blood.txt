Heaving like the waves
Between the two you praise
A haven found in "true receiving"

The worth of grace unknown
While roaming on ones own
False light is there to blind eyes weary

You hang your head in shame
Give all you have to give
And settle for another day

Come and see the truth
Through lies you've been fed
Weigh the worlds at hand
Now which direction will you take?

Measure the damage done
By flesh and blood and none other
Annihilated faith
Grim the road of healing

Fuel for the flames
A bonfire of prejudice will hardly turn to ashes

The vanity of man suits this wasteland kingdom
Leave the stones and turn your back

Graded below from the start
Years alone in darkness
Faith in man of the word
Lit glow into a dead heart

Rise, end your earthly strife
Call light back into your eyes
Your flaws your wrongs and your rights
Earn your place in the crowd
