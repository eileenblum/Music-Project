A whipping word has become the flesh
Waved around as if the world is tamed
In muted tongues where the wisdom begs
I'm done holding my breath

False faith disallows to create
I sense them wolves at my doorstep
Force fed and bound to resurrect
God knows my name but won't address

Been covered here for a while
Building up sorrows, sweeping under rugs
But the spires are heavenly guarded

Great is the light
That separates and carries out our commands
Left with blood on our hands

Pour your lies into one
Feed your bastard child
Crown your wives before sons
Sustain what they have begun
