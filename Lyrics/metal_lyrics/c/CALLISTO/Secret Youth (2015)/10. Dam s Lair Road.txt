Make no sound
Waste no time
Hide what lights your dark
As hours run through both hands
A way is found grim as grave

The city is sleeping
I am keeping guard
The scent in the evening air
Reminds me of life

Steer the vessel through the night
Glide past flickering lights
Steer the vessel through the night
May you never be found

Time has come to hide what lights your dark
