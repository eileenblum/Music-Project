Pale pretender
You're shaking while you go
Soulless vendor
You'll be reaping what you've sown
You've shown us your might
Now try to survive

Willows weeping tunes of nearing flood
Ancient winds won't carry them afar

Hunters of deep are howling

Fields are turning grey
As we're watching the cancer spread over the land the night awaits
Be aware of the infiltrators' conniving ways

The beast will lie well restrained 'til ready to unwind and feast on its maker

A fading choir lays its silhouette over the gasping land
Our drying mouths are getting drier
Come thirst overwhelming
A fading choir lays its silhouette above the sleeping land
Humming lost songs of the better days
Can you still hear them?
