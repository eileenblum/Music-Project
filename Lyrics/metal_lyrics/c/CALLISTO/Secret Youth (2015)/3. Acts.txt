Act of God
Serves the inner monologue
A lost prayer
With these eyes
A relic from another life
I'm no stranger
A beast like mine
Feeds upon the oldest scars
Another traitor in the making

Come and meet me in a state where I'm off guard
Between rest I'm assured
Moment of belief, my heart is released
Waving from the aisle just barely inside
Between rest I'm assured
Moment of belief, my heart's released like a drug

And yet they make their way back to where thoughts are stored
Left to ghostwrite the end
