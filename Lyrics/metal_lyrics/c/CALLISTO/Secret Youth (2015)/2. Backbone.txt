Dim lighting hides the scene so well
It's truly frightening
These walls grow taller by the day
No words make sense and
There's only one way to amend the backbone I've left laying around, gathering dust

New branch
Perspective
Warm touch of grace
Yet winds blow colder
Fierce thunder in its wake
While raging powers reign
There's no truth nor shame
You know it all makes sense
A mind depraved

Still reaching out to find a meaning
A revelation guiding home
Worn out to wear the armour of the vivid
While stumbling on the winding road

Striving
Struck to the ground
Gather pieces and rebuild
Feature
Persistent
Gather pieces and rebuild
