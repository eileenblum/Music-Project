Never came to be
Aware of true me
Thriving in the dismay
Where fear burns my eyes
Still I know the word
I've been blessed by grace
Yet I long for a mane to keep me warm

I rake the sand in me
A brighter tone of grey
Coming from the horizon
Of the fateful span
Gratitude and shame
Shake hands in me truly
And I wait for the grey to reel away

Deeper into the hay
The ray, it swarms tonight
Catching my skin in shade
I never thought it'd come
Just tonight, fill my sight
And melt the grey away

I rake the sand in me
A milestone in grey
Came in days too early
To face all that light
A permission to stay
In gratitude and joy
And I wait for the grey to reel away

To swirl in the span of
Depleting time
It swallows the time of
Our being in dismay
We're all in swirl of
Sunlight and dismay
The ray of grace it
Still prevails
