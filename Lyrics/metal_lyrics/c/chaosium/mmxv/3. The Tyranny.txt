Liars and rogues
Deceiving minds
Through smoke and through shadow
Controlling lives
False progress, disorder 
No hope resides

This is the tyranny
The rule of one

Elected punishment
Dictatorship by will
The box has spoken
To take our freedom away

Blind are the sheep
Cliffs up ahead 
The despot commands us 
To kneel and die 
No limits, our freedom 
Monopolized

This is the tyranny
The rule of one

Elected punishment
Dictatorship by will
The box has spoken
To take our freedom away
This is the tyranny
This is the tyranny
Dictatorship by will
To take our freedom away
Take away!
