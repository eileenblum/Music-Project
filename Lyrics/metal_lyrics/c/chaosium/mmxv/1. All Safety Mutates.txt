Wake up

When time, like a morbid stonemason 
Chisels your beauty away
And gangrenous hacksaw of old age
Severs your legs at the knee

When tremors inhabit your resolution
And doubts invade the truth
What shall you do?
What shall you do?

All safety mutates, all alliances break
And alone and crippled you wake up

When skies that were without limit
Smother your freedom within
Once defiant, arrogant and prince-like
Now pallid, deformed and grim

When all dissolves into nothingness
And stars are robbed of their radiance

Where will you be?

All safety mutates, all alliances break
And alone and crippled you wake up

Where will you be?
Where will you be?

All safety mutates, all alliances break
And alone and crippled you wake up

Wake up
