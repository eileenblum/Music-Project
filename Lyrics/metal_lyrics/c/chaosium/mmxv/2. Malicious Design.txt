A devious schematic
Has been etched on my mind
An architect infernal
A malicious design
The scaffolding of madness
Chaos sets the stage
The Tower bends and crumbles
Only dust now remains

Dust remains

Spine bends in pain
As the whip sets the pace
Toils of the flesh
And the anguish of the brain
Procession of the wretched
In this Calvary of hell 
Freedom being muffled
By the executionâs yell

Bow down!
Bow down!
Bow down to the architect of your fate
And gladlyâ¦
Bow down to the only god you obey
And gladly die

Tempus edax rerum
Pulvis et umbra sumus
All bow down

Bow down to the architect of your fate
And gladlyâ¦
Bow down to the only god you obey
And gladlyâ¦
Bow down to the architect of your fate
And gladlyâ¦
Bow down to the only god you obey
And gladly die
And gladly die
And gladly die

Die
