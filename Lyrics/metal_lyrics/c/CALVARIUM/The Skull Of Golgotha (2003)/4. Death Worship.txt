In a room, darkened
Full on my suicide notes
On the walls..
In the ceiling..
Covering the floor..
Every corner saying goodbye
cursing this world
hailing death

As I stagger
in this world
and the one beyond
The words of the notes
Form faces, grotesque
Demonfaces, horned and mocking
Staring at me
Laughing at me
Screaming in my mind

Elder scriptures
Tongue of demons
Written and carved
all over my skin
Written to summon
those creatures in blasphemy
Deny Heaven
and walk the way to blackness
In the last momets
"odo cicale Qaa; sodoreje
Iape sodirejo Noro Mada, hoathahe Saitan!"
and the demons
rip me apart...
