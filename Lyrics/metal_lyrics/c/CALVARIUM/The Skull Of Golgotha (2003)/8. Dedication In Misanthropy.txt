Human cruelty
Animosity towards each other by command or by will
Wars for religion and land
Executions, slaughtering, torture
For earthly fortunes and pleasure
So worthless is one life

Geniosity of most fierce
way to produce pain
Brilliantness to invent
thousand agonized deaths
From gas chambers to nuclear weaponry
Man truly is a misanthrope

Incarnation of the Antichrist
Leaders of murderous holocausts
I hail dictators!
I salute massmurderers!
The true artists of human suffering
Masters above the dying herd

To wear the skin of another
To carry the skull of one's enemy
To cremate a living person by force
To push the button inflicting poisoning
To dismember one limb by limb
To beat someone 'till last breath is taken
That is the true artwork in praise of Satan
