Bestial hatred upon mankind
Gazing down from the throne
gushing misanthropy
Disgust, dripping from the mouth
Expression, twisted insanity
Ritualistic art of dying
made by my horns of hate

Gone are my humane emotions
what is left is a faceless void
of downcasted evilness
Submit to the HORNS OF HATE
For you are just flares in the eternal night

Horns..

Mislead lambs
where is your shepard now?
Never see the Light...
Book of Revelations, prophesied wrong
Defeated armies of god
Glorious triumph of Satan
Cursed black magic from the Horns of Hate
