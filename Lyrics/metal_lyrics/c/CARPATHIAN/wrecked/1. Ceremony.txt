don't tell me It's over just yet because when you said you'd be here forever
I figured that bought us some time
but time past through us and left you wanting more but this is it kid,
our hearts beat for it, it doesn't get any better than this
so don't look back, don't look down
what could've been isn't even an option
I'm thinking clearly for the very first time
yeah I'm a fuck up, a highschool dropout but
I'm seeing this world for what it really is
bright skies and countrysides in a land that talks in tongues
where do we go from here?
is this all we have will we ever get out
heres to our fucking youth spend wasted out
I know I promised you more.
but fuck what you think
fuck everything
fuck regret
down for anything?
