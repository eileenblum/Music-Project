So messed up I want you here
In my room I want you hear
Black eyes
Black nails
Black heart
Black soul
I am so alive
I am so alone
Torn apart by love again
Stranger to my room, you know it all too well
Bones on bones and eyes black as hell
Weightless abandon your empty shell
Remains of ghosts are all I've felt
I am the last romantic
I haven't anything
