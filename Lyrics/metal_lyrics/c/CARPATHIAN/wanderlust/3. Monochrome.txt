Save my soul from the poisons of this world
Seeds of lust, desire and deceit
Bloom inside the darkest hearts
Spreading, growing towards the light
There is something about you
You said
You're different
Take me up into your arms
I swear we're infinite
No desire to be here
Just watch me disappear
So let the dark clouds roll in
Feel depression's teeth sinking in
We're fucking starving, we're fucking dying
Digging the holes they'll find us crawling in
When you feel next to nothing
You'll die in the clothes that you were born in
On our knees we're burning
While the world still turning
