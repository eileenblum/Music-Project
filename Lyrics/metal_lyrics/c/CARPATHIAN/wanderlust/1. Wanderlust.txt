Dear lover, where have you been?
Writing me of all the things you had seen in your dreams
and it seems you've forgotten the things
that you said when you left, all from under your breathe
Today I found myself in hell
soul sickness crept up inside me
Crushed to my knees
left thinking won't someone just adjust my dreams for me?

The world turns but we don't feel it
I don't fucking feel

Looks like we failed to make amends again

I'm a tourist in the city of love
and you're the only thing on my mind
Take your claws from off of me
Take your claws from out of my head
