"Write me" she said
A week that felt like years
Distance makes the heart grow fonder
And I can' see much clearer from here
A thousand eyes stare back at me
But none hold suck beauty and captivate like yours

I wish words could express this feeling
My chest palpatates and breaks in two

A change of heart, a second chance to start again
This time it's for real
This is forever

With broken hands, I burnt bridges to keep warm
I turned cold that day but you placed warmth back inside of me.
