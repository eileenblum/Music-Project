Lying here and all I want is to beat my face against this wall
Motionless you drift away, and I'm left wondering
"If it means so little to us why do they fall down you like rain?"
Your hand in mine
I felt explosions for the first time

I realized words are just words
Heartbeats singing us to sleep
Chasing a dream, but some things are never meant to be
The air is filled with a cold uncertainty

Your Beautiful but you don't mean a thing

Why do I even care?

As I take this first breath
Glittering blackness paints me a brand new colour
Forget 'us' this is mine, with eyes like diamonds shine
Swallow me whole sugar
Swallow me whole.
