Six months from now I'll regret those thing I never did
I never told you how much I cared
But you weren't the breath of fresh air that I had hope for
Now you mean nothing to me

What friendship means to you, I'll never fucking know

The distance between us grows we're oceans apart
Forget everything it meant nothing from the start
But I still keep my promises

This won't end with this I swear another passing day and I'm still here.
