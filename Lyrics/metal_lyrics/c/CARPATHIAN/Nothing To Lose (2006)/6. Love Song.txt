Wipe those tears from your fucking face
This isn't another song filled with lies told to my face
I wish I never loved you

What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger
And I will never die from a broken heart

When everything is all said and done
You'll be the one who comes back to me
Well fuck that, you turned your back on me
So fuck you, I'm moving on.
