This is the point where we ask ourselves
"Are these our lives or are we more?"
Fuck standing on a ship we're sinking
The tide beats incessantly dragging you down
Bust!

I only saw what I wanted to see
I only heard what I wanted to hear
This is the End of the World

With open arms embrace the cold
With open hearts embrace this cold
This is the End of the World

Submerge breathless and choke on blackened air
Piece me together with shards of heartless despair
Never forget the days that passed the time we shared
Meant everything although I wasn't fucking there

Deal with it
Rock 'n Roll
And I will never forget about you
Those who I love.
