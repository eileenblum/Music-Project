These are the days we won't forget
Everything that we've been through and yet to fall
Through it all
I'll fucking stand by you

Remembering how our sides ached, faces wet with tears
It felt so good let's do it all again
The weight of the world can't touch this shit
Can you feel it?
We're unstoppable

Nothing to lose.
