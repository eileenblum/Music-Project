How could something that means so much to me mean so little to you?
I can't believe you could walk away, leave this so easily
Blinded by the stars in your fucking eyes

I'll tear them out and replace them with something real
Teach you to feel how I fucking feel

So tell me how does it feel to fuck yourself up?

So follow, please follow me through this just take my hand
Set yourself free.
