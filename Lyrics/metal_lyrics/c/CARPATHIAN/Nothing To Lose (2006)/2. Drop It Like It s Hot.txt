I can't escape the tension in this place it's never changed
Where's the unity when new faces aren't welcome in this family
Putting down those who are full of heart
Because they weren't there at the start
Well now I'm calling you out you fucking fake because
There's more than holding heads up high at stake

So what the fuck have you got when
You're dropping my name like it's so damn hot?
Talk and talk and talk again about how much better it was back then
Well get out
Fighting is never worth it unless something worth's dying for
Now your asking me what I fucking stand for?

Take your folded arms and drive them through your jaded heart
You were nothing then and your nothing now

Come on kid this ain't 84, so what you playing for?
