So take a fucking step back and see what this has reduced to
Another bitter night spent bashing keys to tear each other down
What have we got when the blood that ties spills onto these floors?

The dawn of a new war
You've run your mouth too fucking long

I'd rather dies than listen to you
You've got no game your time is up
Your looking tired try something new
You've got no fucking game bitch
Try something new

So quit running your fucking mouth
Your killing no one but yourself
GO!
