There's nothing I would change, given a chance to
Rearrange I wouldn't part with a single day, not today
There's nothing you can change because hardcores
Always remains proud to be a fimaly to me, family
Believe me when I say this shit's real
Now's our chance to show who's down for hardcore
And now we're fighting for ourselves
Wearing our hearts on our sleeves
So who are you to judge
Based on our lives our beliefs
We've made mistakes, but fucking proud of who we are
We are today, so get down or get the fuck away
When everything has changed
Hardcore will always remain
There's nothing you can change
Because hardcore always remains
