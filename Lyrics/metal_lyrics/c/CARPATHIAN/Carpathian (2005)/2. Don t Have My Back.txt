I want to know who's for real
All this talk of having my back has been overdone
I have no compassion for this fucking trend
Fuck your 'family' fuck your 'friends' get down
Don't have my fucking back
Your days have finally come to an end
You pick up pieces of broken hearts
That your hands could never mend
You turned your back when things got rough
And the 'tough' you've been trying to push
Has lost it's touch
Now you've opened up and
Your true colours have shown
Don't have my back
