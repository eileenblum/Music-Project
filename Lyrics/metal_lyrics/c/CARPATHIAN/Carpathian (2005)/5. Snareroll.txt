My blood thickens at the thought of
Spending this moment with you
I've never felt cold like this
I've never felt comfort in your arms
Break away from you, I taste him on your lips
Wipe that smile, lying never felt so fucking good
I hope it kills you, smile and wave
Blood spattered fucking bride to be
You wont forget me
I've never felt cold like this
I've never felt comfort in your arms
Break away from you, I taste him on your fucking lips
Inseparable suddenly adopts a whole new tone
The feeling of shoving fingers to the back of my throat
You wont forget me
