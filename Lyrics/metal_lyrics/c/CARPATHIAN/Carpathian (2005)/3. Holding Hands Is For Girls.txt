I held your hand and felt the blood
Leave through the holes you placed in me
And it drills in my head why no one is ever there when
You need them most
I could walk away like you only taught me how
Turn my back and forget
What we stood for, friends to the end, never looking back
Don't kill this trend, lose faith in this
Lose faith in everything
Lose faith in everything
It's brought you to your knees
Lose faith in everything
It's brought you to your knees
Champagne to my real friends
And real pain for my sham friends.
Friends to the end, never looking back.
Friends to the end, never looking back.
Friends to the end, never going to forget
What we stood for
this is your last fucking chance.
This is your last fucking chance for I still believe
This is your last fucking chance for I still believe
This is your last fucking chance for I still believe
This is your last fucking chance for I still believe
