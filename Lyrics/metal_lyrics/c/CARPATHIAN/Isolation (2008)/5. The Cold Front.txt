I refuse to be part of a world, refusing learning, refusing thought,

Refusing feeling, refusing heart.
Open our eyes so we can see again, unclench our fists so we can feel again
We're forward thinking, but no one cares

Instead we open our hearts to greed, and its a fucking killer, its a fucking disease
Its the cancer in our bones that brought us to our knee's
Where do you turn when everyone is as guilty?

I refuse to be part of a world, encouraging the suffering. the decline of beauty.
The oppression. the depression. though no deliberation to this fucking tragedy?

Who will be the voice for those who haven't one?

Who will be the first to show humility?
Who will be the first to show morality?
Who will be the first to show empathy?
Who will be the first to show sincerity?
To teach me?
