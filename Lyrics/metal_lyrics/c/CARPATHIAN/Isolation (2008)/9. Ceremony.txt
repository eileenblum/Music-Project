Don't tell me its over just yet
Because when you said you would be here forever
I figured that bought us some time
But time past through us
And left you wanting more
But this is it kid
Our hearts beat for it
It doesn't get any better than this
So don't look back
Don't look down
What could have been isn't even an option
I'm thinking clearly for the very first time
I'm a fuck up
A highschool dropout but I see this world for what it really is
Bright skies and countrysides in a land that talks in tongues
Where do we go from here
Is this all we have
Will we ever get out
Here's to our fucking youth spent wasted out
I know I promised you more but
Fuck what you think
Fuck everything
Fuck regret
Down for anything
