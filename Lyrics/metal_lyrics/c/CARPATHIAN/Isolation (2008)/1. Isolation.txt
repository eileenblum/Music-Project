Overflowing with hatred, I cannot contain me, I erupt
I feel violent, volatile, on the verge of destruction
So lost inside myself, it resonates this beating against my head and heart
So lost inside myself, it isolates as routine bites hard

This downward spiral, this endless circle, this solitude
I am nothing, I am permanence.
