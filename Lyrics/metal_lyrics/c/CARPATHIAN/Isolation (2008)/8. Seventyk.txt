I wonder if this is what its like to be a seventies kid?
Standing at the edge of the world, screaming
"I just don't feel like growing up today"
This whole city in shades of panic and pantone
We're on the run again this feeling in our bones

We're so fucking high and tonight's the night.
We slept through nine to five, now we're doing it right
I've never felt so alive with my crew at my side

I'm a fucking criminal, and paintings my crime
I've fucked this whole city one wall at a time

On the fucking run again
This feeling in our bones
I wonder if this is what its like
To be a seventies kid?
