The signs that we see
We'll never be free
A killer wave
Dragging us to hell

Our age passes by. We wanna be alive
The demon calling

We hear voices in the dark
A creature calling
We hear echoes from the past
We are the lost souls

We're building the damage
Mother nature can't be blamed
Across the sea
A truth lies ahead

A page passes by. We're not gonna be alive
A new world calling

We hear voices in the dark
A creature calling
We hear echoes from the past
We are the lost souls
