A roaring voice
A friend or foe?
We've got no choice
We are standing in line

We're 'bout to reach
A black hole
Though deceased
Our spirit never dies

A garden of Eden is God's creation

Chained me all night
In the name of delight
They call it might
Seeing us in spite
We'll stand the pain in life of agony

Saviour described
What's good and bad
A digital world
Is end of the game!

A garden of Eden is God's creation

Chained me all night
In the name of delight
They call it might
Seeing us in spite
We'll stand the pain in life of agony
