Now we surrender
For the past we left behind
A kingdom they enter
At the end, all went blind

Life a fairytale
And the chapter ends

There are winners
Among sinners
They are making history

There are losers
And creators
Who are longing victory

You know my friend... I wish them well

We fought like thunder
Like a never ending wind
What a wonder
We believe in making
