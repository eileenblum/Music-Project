A flashing light I see
Is it a sign to be free?
To reach a destination
Something in mind

All what I see
A revolution rising we
A gone generation
Leaving behind

Voices in airwaves, commanding all the young
Chronicles of the nature, will never die

Carry on, till the end
Legends of the past
Made a name

Searching on, to be the same
Legends of the past
Name a name

Let's carry on!!!

I'll never forget
All those blessed memories
Turning on a receiver
Day and night

Now I don't regret
What I heard through the years
I'm a believer
And I'll fight
