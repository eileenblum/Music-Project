An awful dream appears in the day
Where man sees hope without reality

They block the way. Generals reign
Their hate on fire
Air display. Some take the pain
We can't get away

All we need
To save our deed
A hand to lead
To remain sacred

Now we bleed
Believing creed
Never ending greed
To remain sacred

A weaponed team, longing to play
Were we overjoyed with human process

All we need
To save our deed
A hand to lead
To remain sacred

Now we bleed
Believing creed
Never ending greed
To remain sacred
