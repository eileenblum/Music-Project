Long of tooth
Many rings now in tow
Return
Another cycle brought to its close
Grant the heavens thirty years
To make good on their word
Bow your head, now, in surrender
Saturn
Return

Devoured
Descendants
RIVERS FLOW
Currents damned will never veer
Devoured
Descendants
ELDERS GROW
Branches shorn shall never bear
The burden of the seer
For sight is both a blessing and a curse
To resurrect the Trickster's song
We declare the Arrowhead as Epilogue

Raven ARISE, from what was lost...

Explorations in decay:
Atthisaltitudeoftheunwellmoralcompassspinslikeaspiralstaircase

This union is forbidden, Love
Two-spirited embodiment of One

Open windows
Tangled antlers
Crossing over
Through the caverns
Seeking answers

On the record this is regret
Passages in-progress
Pass for memories

For the record this is contact
All my words fail
When we meet in dreams

Off the record you were laughing
In the crashing waves
Gone with the tides
Wading out to the sea

May those crooked spears of light guide you home
May you carry no more crushing weight
A soul displaced
From it's herd of white buffalo

Return...
Return to The Source.
Awaken...
Awake from this dream,
Wake from this dream.

Explorations in decay:
Inthisdatastreamdeliriumthemethodisthemaze
Its just the fingerprints on a photograph, a wrong turn off the branching path
Give me station,
Some awareness,
In this static aftermath.

Rising from the ashes
Out of the empty
Halls of vacuity
Caesura breaks, Dreamer...
AWAKE
(Adrift in revery)
AWAKE
(Sleepwalking effigies)
As it is in my blood, so it is in the Night Sea

Growing in the silence
Within the womb of a long expectant pause
Timely demise, new worlds...
ARISE
(Water gives way to Fire)
ARISE
(Nature's enduring choir)
We must turn the old leaf, that we may pen a new page
Burning offerings for a dying age
