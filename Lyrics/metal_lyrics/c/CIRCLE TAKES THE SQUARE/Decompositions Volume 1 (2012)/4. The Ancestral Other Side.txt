["He who dies before he dies, does not die when he dies" -Abraham of Santa Clara]

Take hold
If we fall before we fall, we do not fall when we fall through
Take hold
If we fall before we fall, we do not fall when we
Take hold
If we fall before we fall, we do not fall
Take hold
If we fall before we fall, we do

There are forces at work here beyond
This Realm of Self in which we reside
A call to consciousness with no response
Another view from that vanquished other side

May this healing crisis
Unmask the faceless
All those who occupied my peripheries

(Fever Builds)
Silent flakes of snow bite your tongue
Until their angles and hardlines grow soft
Atomic winter, a drifting dormant sun
Boundaries and bridges all a blur
Your life spans, my disconnected dots
(Fever Breaks)

May this healing crisis
Make known the nameless
Who colonized my soul
When the other side took hold

Hiding in a healer's
Sacred heart, the worst disease-
Caverns of atria,
Black holes of empathy.

Where pale and distant
Shapes made of shadow speak
Forms in a feedback loop
Of abandoned memory...

Allied in our open wounds,
We bleed venom and wild flowers bloom,
They give way
To the side-winding vine,
To the brambles of time.
Love's first creation was loss.

Red-shifted horizon looms,
Echo chamber of self-imposed solitude
Mass and weight fall away
My true nature escapes
What was boundless now stands consumed.

Refiner's Fire
Ancestral Flame
MAKER OF LIGHT
Radial Voices
Recursive Planes

Engaging only this moment,
While the patterns erase
Mandalic sand
BATHED IN BLOODLINES
A desperate plea to stay present,
In the ember's embrace

Non-attachment retreats
In a pillar of steam
Another mantra in splinters
At the Maker's feet
Precepts deconstructed,
Focus, going astray
I refuse to Burn
Falling Forward

Through fevered visions,
Silence devouring its own tail.
Unbroken circle,
Grant us the crisis needed to heal,
Through fevered visions,
Silence devouring its own tail.
Unbroken circle,
Grant us the crisis needed to heal
