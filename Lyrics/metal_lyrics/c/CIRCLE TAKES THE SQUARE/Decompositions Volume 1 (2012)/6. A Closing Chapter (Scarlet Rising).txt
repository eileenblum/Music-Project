(All awash in
Scarlet rising
Bloodbath birth marking
A passing age)

Adoration
For the elder gods
Was a closing chapter
Now the sky
Is a vacant throne

Apparitions
Patterns we projected
Shake me out of slumber
Â Pull me back
To the deep unknown

TO DECODE:

Inscriptions
On the inner circle
Interwoven spirals
Signaling
We're not alone

(All awash in
Scarlet rising
Bloodbath birth marking
We're not alone)

So, pin me down
To your vast embroidered web.
By witchery, self was conceived...

I made a bride of the moonlight
Endured refusal for a thousand lives
She guided me through the temporal streams
In turn, how I would disgrace thee

We made a shrine of this mountainside
Built our blood from its root and vine
A sylvan ashram to shelter me
In turn, how I would betray thee

I made communion with a hungry wind
It lapped the salt from my calloused skin
And I know, I was warned not to fall for the meek
In turn, it preys on me

Take cover
Never saw it coming
(Cover)
Touching down
Where pressure points meet
Timelines diverging
At the Trailhead of Eternity

Take shelter
Never saw it coming
(Shelter)
Breaking ground
Where four corners meet
Ley-lines converging
At the Gatepost of Infinity

...form was perceived...

No present tense
No middle mixture gradients
No tender hex

Through and Through
The Future Past
Through and Through

Just the gnashing of teeth
(Passing Through)
Just the wedding of two extremes
Just my own failing grip
(Passing Through)
Losing feeling in my fingertips

Overlooking a scene from the slaughterÂ 
Of Innocence
My alternate
Selves strain and fracture

Undertaking a rite on the altarÂ 
Of Experience
No deviant
Virtues recovered

Sculpting my death mask
From living rock / kcor gnivil morF
Shielding my true face
From the Other...

Letting go to grasp
The paradox / xodarap ehT
Contrary logic pervades...

Passing Through
The Looking Glass
Passing Through

Overlooking the slaughter
Suspended in time
Staring out from the amber
Overlooking a scene from the slaughter

RITUALIZE THE COLLAPSE

Through and Through
The Future Past
Through and Through

(...all awash in, scarlet rising...)
