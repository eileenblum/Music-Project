I'll depart, when the lights overhead have all but one burnt out,
In a slow procession dragging every shadow, every doubt.
What pioneers precede me? Cloven footprints left behind
On a land base cut so clear, white trails blazed across the skies.
Some spin wild in praise, most just need to save ourselves:
A people out of time, who have lost the will to HOWL...

From four legs
Fortnights
Withhold the rest begged of weary eyes.
What rot-refusing cemetery
Pines for all our kind?

Teach me to scream
In volatile whispers,
(SIGNALING FIRE
Teach me to wake inside your dream and stay forever.
(SIGNALING FLAME)
I could wage your wars,
I could cast your spells,
I could preach your meaning.
(SIGNALING FIRE)
Teach me the notes to sing
Your vengeance into being...

From two wings
On high
Patterned flight ignites an ink-blot sky.
What fearful blackened symmetry
Reflects our soul's design?

This is no place for the noble or young
Born with the taste of blood on our tongues
TO FORGET / TO FORGIVE
With a hatchet buried deep
(Under Lapsing Time)

Illumination lost its bearing.
Eliminated light:
Left her bereaved.
Kaleidoscopic grief
Tightening its noose.
Now decoherent speech
Is all that rings as true.
Force your words through the gale
Of circling fan blades,
Just to hear another voice...

Resonate
God awful proof
Crying out

Paralyzed
Poisoned heart still beating
Short of breath
Love lies bleeding

Purified
Cauldron over-boiling
Vine of souls
Serpent uncoiling

EVER UNFOLD

Trapped and tamed in this
Thinning wilderness,
Just skin and bone,
We dared
To let the demons in.

Motion sickness setting in,
Crystal waters darkening,
Hair raised on our necks...

We drew
Our breath
Out of the thick air

Deviate
Wandering kiss
Co-create
Seething abyss
(Re)integrate
Exiled arts
Bi-locate
Tear us apart

So long, eternal youth-
Bare feet and empty hands,
I'm off to find the Truth
In this pathless land.

To command
My nightmare
"Speak your name"

(in vain)

Regards, untimely death-
The urge to understand,
Merely a lapsing crest
Bound for the sand.

If I should stray
And disappear
I fear what quantum scaffolding would be revealed
And If only I knew
At creations end the fog would lift and clear
Unveiling:
Silent Sovereignty Surfacing

Pulverized
Wounded heart stops beating
Between lives
Patterns repeating

In verses
To sing
The Seeds Of Rebirth
TO BE SEWED:
In chorus
To sing
sing of hope

Upwind, a budding Spring

Parallel
Galaxies of light
Synchronize
Tattered edges overlap

Downstream, the Nettle's sting

Winding down
Vortices of time
Narrowing
Tired movements come to pass

In violent symphonies,
Let us sing it into being.

The ancient corridors
Are closing
Our hexagonal hives
Collapsing
The antique pathways
Corroding
Our holographic lives
Enfolding on themselves

Shudder in the quake
Of pending Eschatons
Hatchet buried deep
With a paradise we lost
FORGIVEN / FORGOTTEN
Drafting my swan song
