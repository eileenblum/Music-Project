Stalking the formless
Collapse,
She strings me along...
Vapor trails,
Disappearing tracks;
Entanglement unwinds
In threads of golden error.
What strange attractors ahead,
Lie awake in wait?

Crossing this fertile
Expanse,
To commune with the life-less...
Spirit narrative,
Rite of passage;
Progress is paralysis
When poison is my path.
I'm laid to rest,
Just to rise again.

Hell-bent circuits-
Shadows speak through the frequencies.
Heaven-sent asylum-
One psychotic break and the veil recedes.
Channeling devastating
Revelations of the method

From the other side of Somewhere.
From the endless halls of Elsewhere.

In some mythic story arc I wake;
Hand pick your pleasure, feast, then fall from grace.

Fabled
Decline;
Within
The text
Resides
My next
Shape Shift
Time Slip.

Listless,
When the hammer drops.
To be still,
When the narrative breaks down.
Holding centre
Under shelter
Of this altered state.
At rest,
In the restlessness
That was forged
In this state of changing phase.
All structure failing:
God's forsaken sanctuary.

In field of view
Her solid state
Our passing tryst
Just melts away
Sublimate
The Great Divide
The Grand Design
Defected
Solidify
The Great Divide
Our cells collide
The Grand Design

Deserted-
Demiurges running free.
Arcing archangels-
Only resonate out of sympathy.
Summoning shocking
Demonstrations of the method

From the chambered heart of Nowhere
(Where the feedback feeds on echoes).

Baiting the feral
Demise,
On the heels of Culture...
Another crippling analysis,
Unraveled
Dreams now interpret me,
At the trail's end of this
False Awakening.
