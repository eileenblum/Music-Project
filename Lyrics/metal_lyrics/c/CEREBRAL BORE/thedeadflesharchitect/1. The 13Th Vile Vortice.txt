There will be no salvation for the damned,
An eternity spent in torment,
Cross the threshold into realms of disease,
Air is poison, bodies line the streets to rot,
One existence torn to shreds in a breath,
Ends in nothing, a void of blackness to be,
Un-creation in a sense is the essence of all that has come to be,
Infinite nothingness,

One victim left to butcher, only one? thats no fun
Drilled in the brain then fucked her, 
Take in turns, mix and match, the rape and torture and slaughter,

One victim left to mutilate, barb wire bound, upside down,
My hacksaw made to amputate, 
Steal the limbs, peel the skin,
Burst organs, eat the flesh you leave.

There is a man walking, scraping his face off against the wall.

Butchery
Sodomy
Surgery
I perform all three simultaneously

Into the void of torment,
The watchful gaze of despair,
Controlling monstrosities,
Relinquish all life,
Into the void,
The darkness,
Forever,
So it shall be,

Into the void,
The darkness,
Forever, 
So it shall be, 
Into the void of torment
The watchful gaze of despair,
Controlling hateful nature,
Relinquish all life,

Into the void,
The darkness,
So it shall be, 
Forever,

Bygone is existence,
Forever; in an instant ceases to be.
The vortice bore what is vile.
Dead existence, the seed has been sown,

Follow the darkness into the universe,
A hollow incarnation of existence,
Burst vagina, smash the crown,
Hang the carcass upside down,
And the seed we have sown,
Will become the end of all things,

Bygone is existence
Forever in an instant ceases to be,
The vortice bore what is vile,

Monstrosities of disease carved from the flesh,
Of the holocaust of existence,
Misanthropy runs in the veins,
Into the void of torment,

Monstrosities of disease, 
Holocaust in effect,
Monstrosities of disease unleashed.

And there is a man walking, scraping his face off against the wall
Oblivion/Oblivious
