'Phil Anselmo: 'Cerebral Bore... Will fuck your fucking head up boy.'

These demons, are inside
Whittake's poltergeist is here
Hotmouthed them to the fucking floor
Victim smells, farewells
Raging...

Eternal, Nocturnal
Pizzle's fart was a piece of art
Snide hotel, Snout-Jumper
He'll punch your cunt right in!

The colonel is dead, What-A-Burger is best
Gripping your chest, right arm grabs left
Oh!

Welcome in, my eyes burn
Look away, as stomaches twist and churn
Wickedness, deliverance through a freak
Open minds, shut with acrimony
Stay in agony, with me

Pouring the vodka straight in
Skin peeled 'till it's waist, it burns
Fighting away your feces
Make them my solid underpanties

Yawdie ya - We're all one kind
Yawdie ya - A face just like me
Yawdie ya - 'Till death do us part
Yawdie ya - Mad wae it!

Infinity, wasted on this
Nevermore, a turning back on
Control - We're lost in chaos
They will never see me again!

Atrocious house of sodom, we'll never be the same
Laid my will far too rest...
Set me free!

Beast, memories
End it now...
