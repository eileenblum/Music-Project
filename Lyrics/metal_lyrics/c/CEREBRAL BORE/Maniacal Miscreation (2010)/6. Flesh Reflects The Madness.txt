Cutting pieces of her off, stick them in her gut, shove it up her cunt
Slicing through her face, I cum
Fuck her up the ass, fuck her up the ass
Break her!
[x2]

Until another foolish victim stumbles into my kill path
I will have to make do with what I've left of you
Rape the messy corpse in the basement, I create my own world
Where I become the god of the very existence

I am Human
I am God

I will not stop until I am destroyed
Consequence means nothing to me now
Where the dead ones lie I can be seen
Taking skin with me as a trophy now

I become the one existence, masquerading in dead flesh
I become the one existence, bow to the flesh devoured

Flesh peeled back into a star shaped vessel
Showering the ground with blood
Chaos depends on this
The flesh reflects the madness

I become the world
And the one existence
Masquerading in your dead flesh

The flesh will face the steel
Hacksaw is here to make corpses of people
The scourge of existence, craving the destruction of every man

The blades will tear the face
Horrific scarring will erase traces of former existence
Humanity shredded to pieces, prepared for the feast

I am human, I am demon, I am god, I am machine

Flesh peeled back into a star shaped vessel
Showering the ground with thick, black, dead blood

Create monstrous madness
Creation has been lost upon us
Create monstrous madness
Creation has been lost upon us

Create monstrous madness
Creation has been lost upon us
Create monstrous madness
Creation has been lost upon us

LIGHT!

Slicing off limbs with the sharpest incisor I can find

Gore and blood and viscera all around the room
The carcass lay upon a table, scalpels sticking out the eyes

Origin of true compulsion will stay unknown
I'll create art from the carcass and stay unknown

Souls, destroyed and tortured
Souls, destroyed, tormented, devoured
Souls, destroyed and tortured
Souls, destroyed, tormented, devoured
Souls, destroyed and tortured
Souls, destroyed, tormented, devoured
Souls, destroyed and tortured
Souls, destroyed, tormented, devoured
Souls
