Intro: "It's shite being scottish. We're the lowest of the low. The scum of the fucking earth." Carve a path unto obsidian - Insane creation of an abscessed mindCities crumble in your wake -Have a cookie geez a sookie you cunt! Decimation! Fuck the weak, kill the meak - Pustule broke on top of meEngorgement of worldsFlesh, muscle, sewn on bone - A full monstrosity..Created by a nut, stitching skin and surgical cuts - Abomination of manScream, yelp, you can't runDeath has come for you and me! Buildings are laid to waste, Now you are freeExistence is fucking screwed, Creation will cease to be! Combustion at your feet- They are all.. DEAD! You'll get fucking jabbed! Cryogenic, rotting chamber -Where you once laid like a stillborn weanCame to life, killed creator - Severed heads are filled with shame Pish! Smash the city - cut them down to the groundSuck the titty - crimp one off when you cough I'LL JAB YOUR DA!
