I awake beneath a mountain of cadavers
Buried beneath the bodies

Some bodies have been tortured
All I have been raped and slaughtered
Dismembered, broke and beating
All of the organs have been eating
Children nailed to the ceiling
Gives my cock a real good feeling
Maggots infesting the faces
Making flesh a bit more tasty

Flesh to eat just for me
Broken human bone collection
Heresy, blasphemy
Zombies begin resurrecting
Flesh to tear, skin to wear
Mr Gein your teachings are so
Dear to me, sickness sets free
A dead flesh architect!
[x2]

Dead people taste good
Just like chicken
Dead people rise up
To begin the feeding
Dead people taste good
Just like chicken
Dead people stand up
To infect us all!

I have become infected

Gruesome undead monsters crave my tasty human flesh
A horde of zombies craving for a taste of something fresh

Performing surgery with their teeth, swallow me
Tearing the skin away, crave the flesh, oh so sweet
Humanity away, leave me fucked on the floor
My zombie craving's coming, give me flesh, I need to devour

The flesh, lick up the guts
Suck blood out of the cuts
The flesh, lick up the guts
Suck the blood out from the cuts!

Ominous, we'll come out at dusk
Riotus, horrific bloodthirst

Out of the walls we will crawl with a thirst
To devour the flesh of the humans we lust
Chewing and swallowing, suck out the eyes
Out of the flesh of the humans we'll rise!

Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa, burst her cunt in!
Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa uhhh

Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa, burst her cunt in!
Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa

Underneath some wretched corpses
Burst open the cunt
In between some dormant thighs
Vagina ripped open

Ee pee oppa pee pee

Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa, burst her cunt in!
Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa uhhh

Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa, burst her cunt in!
Ee pee oppa pee pee
Ee pee oppa

Ee pee oppa peep!

I have become part of something monstrous in proportion
I await the day I'll get to feast on infant's flesh
