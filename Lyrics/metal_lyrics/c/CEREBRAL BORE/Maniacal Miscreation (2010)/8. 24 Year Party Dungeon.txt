Back in the mid 80's, Mr Fritzl had a planWith bricks and mortar, build a cell fit for his daughterNo room to stand, no need she'll be on her back mostlyPrepare for winky, it's coming for you and it bears a tash On holiday, he suns himself in Eastern-AsiaHe's calm as fuck, he knows the screams and pain will go unhear Chorus:She'll see, his evil pee-peeSee, his evil pee-pee In-my-basement-you-won't-find-her-she's- ..my-daughter-i-must-ride-her-leave-my -semen-deep-inside-her-i-can't-think-how..-i-could-be-kinder Wet against her will, TIGHT! Hello Lizzy lets get busy, want some jizzy?Spunk! Joseph! Joseph, Fritzl, Fritzl, He is nice, Joe, Fritzl24-years-of-fun She'll see, his evil pee-peeSee, his evil pee-pee 24 Year party dungeon, 24 house of funFind dead babies in the oven, mutant children starved of sun. AU-STRI-AFirst i plant my inbred seed, then i go to K-F-fucking C K-F-C!!! I eat chicken when i pump her fud, i love chicken, yum yum niceZinger tower gives me the power, to deflower my own kids
