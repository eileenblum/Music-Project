Held, against your will
With lights around you, so you shit your knickers
Bound, by gods design
Epileptic fucking strobe entrapment

Skinned

Severed bodies make me cum
Drooling over your cunt
Severed bodies make me cum

Epileptic strobe entrapment
You will die here x2

Pin your eyelids, watching the strobe
Feel the brown skids, suck on my boab
Feeling the pain, having a seizure
Destroy the brain, there's no amnesia

You sit in your cage of fear
Bound by rope, fully locked, naked corpses being cocked
Flame grilled flesh and ice cold beer
Semi rocked, you're unlocked, fully hard and fucked a lot

Killing....
Killing you in mind, you will now be mine
Spreading disease

Severed in time, with the sound of my cock
Snider condom, rapid slammed with a sock
Creampied in the asshole, now you are sore
Shit on my dick, good times, shit on my blade

Feces....

Hang your neck, let you go
Playing mind games with your soul
Retardation, suffocation

Pain...

Spinal form, reconfigured, constant pounding, mass infection

Atoms smashed in, no escaping, bones are steeped in...
Blood...

DEATH
