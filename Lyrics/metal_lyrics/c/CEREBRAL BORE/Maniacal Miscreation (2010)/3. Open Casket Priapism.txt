Cock, hard
As we start
The strangest sight to behold
Cadavers
Cold flesh and rock solid boab

A penis
You've only seen in nightmares
So solid,
Old folk and children it scares

Running around, from the cock of your dreams

Fleshy, veiny, scary

From the coffin into parishioners
Watch them run, fucking scared of the boab  
Every step they take, they will be consumed
You can't run, up the bum, check out the size of that chode

Pinstripe suit, with a rip in the gooch
He's come for you
He's gone commando, no more shame
Huge pants tent
Morticians fault, he is the one to blame
Open box, with a cock on the rocks
It's a phallic pipe
No more trousers, they are gone
Bifkin cone
Morticians fault, he is the one to blame

We, we shall not survive, we will die
We cannot have a future

Flame grilled, served up for your dinner
Cunt filled, fucked 'till dead, no more tread
Spunk filled, creamy jizz on your tits
You're now infested

Filth...

Feces, now you see, smothered on your face
Milky spunk in your ears, you can't hear a thing
Framing up the entry, it's your turn, feel the burn
You'll have to wait, there a queue to see the pussy too
Cunt

It had cum
Upon me
I have no fear
I will take it
You cunt

As we end
There's nothing left to unfold
Continue
The story must be retold

That penis
A legend in it's own right
No dreaming
Screaming it's name out at night

Open box with cock inside it
You have witnessed something frightening

Run straight from the chode
Get what you're owed
Spunk out my load
Release

It's the time for a reign in terror
All the juices are flowing
Just cause of the massacre
It's what I do and I do it well

Spinal fluid in a cup or two
Priapism for the fuck of you
Everytime I spunk my load
A piece of me goes into you

Fuck you
You have no soul
Cream pied!
Open casket priapism is a haunting sight
