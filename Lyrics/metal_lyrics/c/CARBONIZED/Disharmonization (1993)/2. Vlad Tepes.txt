Pull the pole out of my heart
And I will carry you high above black mountains
To the sphere of night where the shadow is dancing
To the choir of the forgotten

Within the darkness of your dream
I await to kiss you... with the serpent's kiss

Come with me, come and fly with me
Let us travel from eternity to eternity

With a soft caress like the winds of the night
I will carry your soul through the sleep

Come with me, come and fly with me
Let us travel from eternity to eternity
Riding through the winds of death
Within the darkness of your dreams I await to kiss you... with the serpent's kiss
And to wet my tongue with drops of your blood
Which is sparkling like rubins in the lustre of the gloaming light
