Dying another death
A morbid refreshment
Seeking the meaning
Of the spiritual walk

Who's behind me now?
What is my real face

Who's behind me now?
What is my real face
The puppet dance along
Fools preach and go among

Silent journey
Silent journey

The past is my life
Am I my own creator?
Beyond the knowledge
Exits you and I

The past is my life
Am I my own creator?
Beyond the knowledge
Exits you and I

The past is my life
Am I my own creator?
Beyond the knowledge
Exits you and I

Exits you and I
