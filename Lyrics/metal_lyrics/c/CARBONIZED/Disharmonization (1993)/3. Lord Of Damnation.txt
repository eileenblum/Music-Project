You're trappened in this darkened maze
Your life is forever left behind
I've covered your eyes
You'll never see the sun again
So now when you're blind
The process can begin

I can feel your heart
Deep inside your chest

You're scared to the bones
But there's no time to rest

'Cos now I have begun
You can't make me stop
I'm burning your soul
With the heat of my flames

You're frightened of my flames
You kneel before my might
The forces of my anger
Have made you fear the night
I am the Lord of Damnation
The master of your fright
The powers of my will
Is more than you can fight

Feel my rage
Tear on your soul
Your body has collapsed
I've taken your life

You're trappened in this darkened maze
Your life is forever left behind
I've covered your eyes
You'll never see the sun again
So now when you're blind
The process can begin
