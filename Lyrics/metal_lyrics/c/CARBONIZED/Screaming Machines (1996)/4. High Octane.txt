I'm two thousand pound butterfly
Even when I'm down I feel so high
High octane

Is there a universe hidden somewhere
For me
I don't need it don't want it
Fuck it fuck you

You're in my blood you're the shadow in my mind
You're in my blood You're in my blood

I don't know what I want but I do know how I feel
I feel like killingyou very slowly
Killing you
Kill
High octane
