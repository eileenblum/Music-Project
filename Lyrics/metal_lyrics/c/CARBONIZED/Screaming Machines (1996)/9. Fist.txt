Wearing my crown walking through the town
Don't you look at me don't you look at me
Wearing my crown walking through the town
Gonna make you see gonna make you see
You beware my pain get out of my way
Don't you talk to me don't you talk to me
Puzzling together pieces of my reality
Don't you ever try me don't you ever try me

Listen the fists are talking see the fists are walking
All over your face
Wrong place wrong time now I'm making you pay
Pay
