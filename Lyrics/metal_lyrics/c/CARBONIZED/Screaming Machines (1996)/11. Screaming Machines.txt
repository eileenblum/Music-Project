Scream out loud of metal pain
Stop the voices stop the noise
My mind is addicted
My soul is addicted
The mental pain
They scream in my head
Life is pain is life
Am I insane I am
Stop the voices stop the noise
Life is pain is life
I see no colours the world is grey
The screaming  machines, do they scream in you too?
Can you hear the voices echo through your brain?
Noise and voices metallic pain...
Screaming machines
