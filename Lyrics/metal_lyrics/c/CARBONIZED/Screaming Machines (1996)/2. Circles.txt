I've seen the circles that form around all things
I've seen the circles that form around all things
The infinite overlapping of time
All moments unfold in shadows
Continuance in motion
I've seen the circles that form around all things
I've seen the time control the universe

Crime of creation I stoke the universe
As the thief of eternity I've seen the circle
Floating away on the endless space
Across the cosmic sea over and over

I'm walking slowly onto path of time alone
I don't know what I'm searching
But I know it isn't gold
I've seen the time of creation slowly pass away
I'm going I'm going

Endless searching for the cosmic horizon
I don't know where I'm going into
Veil of time

Crime of creation I stoke the universe
As the thief of eternity I've seen the circle
Floating away on the endless space
Across the cosmic sea over and over
