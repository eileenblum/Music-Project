Your features pale and calm by the dim light of my lume;
Your eyelids behind whose shelter, eyes behold not earthly dooms.

You dream in a shroud of mistsâ¦

Fall in ageless slumber, fall in ageless spheres!

And as I sit here, near you, I wonder what dream-paths you trample;
What spectral realms you see, with eyes closed to this world and mee.
