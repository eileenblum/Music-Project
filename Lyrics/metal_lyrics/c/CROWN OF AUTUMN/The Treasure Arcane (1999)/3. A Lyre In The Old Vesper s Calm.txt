So dark are these paths no human eye should see
Guarded by statues in velvet moss clad
Grow savage blackthorns'ere yonder secret cave
For hid shalt remain the dun Elfin Grot
...Yet for mee to know...

Subterranean rains falling from rocky clouds
Far anvils echo in the snow-covered temple
Beyond the lake mist, on the opposite shore
Silhouettes are dancing an elemental dance
...The Nine Worthies stand there...

In the Bleeding One lurked the ruin of a royalty once forlorn
But in a future of centuries old They will leave the catacombs of earth
