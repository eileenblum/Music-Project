Thus redemption bloomed in a five petal rose,
When he arose
From a silent tomb, as our world fell asleep
In a dream deep.

Spill five crimson streams along the fields,
Until thou will break the last of thy seals.

Humanity kneels!

Thorns like laurel,
Blood as a sovereign's cloak
- untrembling oak.
Great and patient will be thine ire upon them!
Jerusalem...

Spill five crimson streams along the fields,
Until thou will break the last of thy seals.

King of the cosmos, our star of the north;
Lion eternal, thou art light coming forth!
Son of the Divine and Divine thyself,
One with the Spirit, witness heaven sent.

Spina, clavi, lancea, mite corpus perforarunt;
Unda manat et cruor; Terra,
Pontus, astra, mundus quo lavantur flumine.

Spill five crimson streams along the fields,
Until thou will break the last of thy seals.

Humanity kneels!

Thus redemption bloomed in a five petal rose,
When he arose
From a silent tomb, as our world fell asleep
In a dream deep.

In the garden of the wounded king.
