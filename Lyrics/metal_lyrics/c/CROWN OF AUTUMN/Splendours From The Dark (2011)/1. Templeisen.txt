Behold the crown triumphant,
A golden sphere held in hand;
His white steed will ride across the land
To carry the truth resplendent!
An opening wound through the clouds,
The holy sword of the sun
Perennial and invincible;
By the Word, death has been dethroned.
Non nobis, Domine, non nobis
Sed nomini tuo da gloriam.
Rise brotherhood,
Rise in battle cries!
