To incarnate God's solar dart,
To bring out splendours from the dark,
This is the quest that noble men
Shall never leave nor forget.

Hail transfiguration
And drink to its dawn!
Glide over the oceans
Until an isle is shown,
Antediluvian.

Aegis;
The transmutation is made of lead into gold.
Aegis;
All darkness has been enslaved
By a force untold.

Let the foes be turned to stone
Now, by the glance
- statues standing still, perennially.

Let the key be turned
By centurion's lance,
Bleeding crimson
Righteously.

May all the pain melt in the rain,
Leaving us transparent and sane.
Emancipate from fear and hate,
The sacred king dominates.

Conquer resurrection
And sit on its throne!
Soar over the mountains until
You'll find the stone,
Antediluvian.

Aegis;
The transmutation is made of lead into gold.
Aegis;
All darkness has been enslaved
By a force untold.

Let the foes be turned to stone
Now, by the glance
- statues standing still, perennially.

Let the key be turned
By centurion's lance,
Bleeding crimson...

Let the foes be turned to stone
Now, by the glance
- statues standing still, perennially.

Let the key be turned
By centurion's lance,
Bleeding crimson
Righteously.
