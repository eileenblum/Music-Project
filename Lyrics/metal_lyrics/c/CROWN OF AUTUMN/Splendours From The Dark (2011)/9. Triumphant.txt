Fountain of precious blood,
A heritage forlorn.
Aeons before the flood
Did an angel soar...
Be patient until dawn
Oh, splendid hyperborean swan!

He comes victorious to win again
- and I beheld a rider white -
Bringer of sacred order and reign;
Way of the north.

Cosmic integrity,
A lighthouse for sailors;
Mystical legacy's navigators.
Remind us our vows
Lest we forget thy knowledge and drowse.

He comes victorious to win again
- and I beheld a rider white -
Bringer of sacred order and reign;
Way of the north.

Still time and spaces vast,
The first art thou and so the last.

He comes victorious to win again
- and I beheld a rider white -
Bringer of sacred order and reign;
Way of the north,
Way of the northerns knight.
