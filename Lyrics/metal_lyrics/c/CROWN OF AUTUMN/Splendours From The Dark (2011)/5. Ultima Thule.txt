To thee shall serve
The regions beyond the north;
The globe entire
Enlightened by thy supreme fire!
An augury of triumph and harmony;
Our dignity
Springs out of this natural hierarchy.

Evanescent
The vision of crystal cliffs
And silver waters;
Our palace I saw in a dream.
Those waves are quenching,
The storms I have left behind
As I dock at the shores,
White shores and beyond them
A peaceful dawn...
