Thy glory awakens!
Imperatrix, clear star forsaken.
The Solstice we celebrate,
Thy bridegroom's rise we contemplate.
At the crystal stairs of winter
We await for happiness to come.

Hail justice, hail sacrifice,
Hail beauty as pure as ice!

...and the Lamb will welcome us back,
It will run towards us and dress us with love.
We are long lost prodigal sons;
The Father has sent into our cave his dove.

Thy glory awakens!
Imperatrix, clear star forsaken.
The Solstice we celebrate,
Let us be one with our own fate.
At the crystal stairs of winter
We await for happiness to come.
