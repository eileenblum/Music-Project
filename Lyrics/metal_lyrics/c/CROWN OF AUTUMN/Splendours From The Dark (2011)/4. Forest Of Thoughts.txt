You will find more knowledge
In rills and in mountains grand,
Rather than in your books.

Oh, sylvan ghost,
Whose whisper is heard
Beneath Autumn's crimson foliage:
Anoint my forehead with the gems of thy wisdom.
For thee our druids are calling,
To thee our bards are singing.

When every single thing vibrates,
One is the symphony;
Then every single moment fades
Into eternity.

Thunders, hammers of war,
Fury will come carried by mighty winds.
Trees kneel beneath the storm,
Our legions march onwards to victory!

You will find more knowledge
In rills and in mountains grand,
Rather than in your books.

The Dragon is everywhere,
Its glistening flakes are there;
Reflections on water rings,
A bloodline of chosen kings.
