[PART I - THE GREAT OLD ONES]

"The quest for thy kingdom of stone..."

[Kutulusumagal]
Oh, great monarch of all dreams and fantasies

[Ereshkigal]
My lunar queen, it's for you that I rise my sword

[Shub-Niggurath]
Thou rise against the sun to bring justice and might

[Naxir]
I kneel before the universe's entirety

[PART II - TOWERING OVER DARK HORIZONS]

The magnificent bells of twilight
toll with a deep and awesome sound
to announce the hour of glory
when the timeless portals open wide...

Autumnal flames enlighten the path beyond those gates
as old as the dawn before the past,
a path of leaves that leads to the castle of the one
whose noble tears I greet with silence
I, Caesar of dusk, meditate on the Cosmical Lost
emperor onn my marble throne
I cntemplate the immortal landscapes of my lands
for they contain the universe... of mine...
