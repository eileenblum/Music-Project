...and the dawn comes red...
My tears on the grave of the ages, once so glorious,
are old wings outspread in the past
to cross the walls of time
emerged from the ocean of history
they will deck the earth with chaos
in the shadow of the comet
...thus speak the elder stars...

They carved onto the stone
of thousands years before
to "Awetumn" I am sworn
"henceforth I'll be your sword!"

Enthroned in a dream of sorrow, dead forever,
I walk on the purple hills where rains of solitude
gather in my open hands
and down my armour slip
to reach the muddy ground
that once received my tears...
...and the dawn comes red...
