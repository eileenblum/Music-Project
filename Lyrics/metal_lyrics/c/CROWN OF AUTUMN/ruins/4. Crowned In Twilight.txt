glowing clouds are coming forth
in the golden sky
silver streams cross the fields
while the moonshyte rises
enchantress twilight's dew
gleams on gardens red
a triumphal overture
choirs of ancient chants

Brandishing my flaming sword
in the twilight sky I soar
through the land resounds the call
lord of astral empires...

Splendour of the childhood's dreams
incantation's king
reptured by the essence of entirety
I stand enthralled in the calm
of the mystic sunset's spell
warm wind blows through my hair
...and the twilight gates await...
