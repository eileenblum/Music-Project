She cries out to the dead
Singing praise as they fell
Resurrection from the grave
An angel's kiss is what I crave

(An) angel's kiss is what I seek
(To) feel her skin next to mine
Resurrect me from my grave
Take me back to see my crimes
Take me back to what I was
To undo all my crimes
Follow me through my life
Making good all my ways

Take me back to what I am
Witness to all my crimes
Follow her 'till the end
Crying as I die again
(An) angel's kiss is what I seek
(To) feel her mouth next to mine
Kiss me now before I die
Take my hand and lead the way

Let me live my life again
Living for eternity
Amending my fallen ways
Letting sorrow turn to joy

Been searching for an angel
But been looking for some sin
(Her) face is clear/pure as the purest/clearest water
(Her) eyes as deep as the ocean sea

Want to take her and to love her
Embrace her for eternity

Been searching for an angel
But been looking for some sin
(Her) face is clear/pure as the purest/clearest water
(Her) eyes as deep as the ocean sea

(An) angel's kiss proves so cold
(To) hear her laugh in my soul
(A) witness to more misery
(An) angel's path is all I seek

Do we want to live forever
Do we want to suffer more
Do you want to live forever
Do you want to suffer more
