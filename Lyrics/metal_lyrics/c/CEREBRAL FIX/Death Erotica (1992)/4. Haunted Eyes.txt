Sight is my crime
Pain is your life
Look in my eyes
See how I cry

Life of dreams, life of lies
Life of hatred, life diseased
Love is cold, is cold as ice
Shatters dreams, shatters lives
Put your life into their hands
And they'll make you understand
Put your life into their hands
And you'll suffer at their command

Haunted eyes, burn deep inside
Haunted eyes, never live

Dare I weep, dare I mourn
Dare I have remorse at all
I look at this life in which I breathe
What have I given, misery
Put your life into their hands
And they'll make you understand
Put your life into their hands
And you'll suffer at their command

Haunted eyes, burn deep inside
Haunted eyes, never live

Visions in the dark
Visions in my dreams
The tears are flowing red
My eyes tell a tale
Of hatred and disease
Where children are slaughtered
(And) the innocent plead

The child, now dead
Buried, now rest
My eyes tell a tale
Of misery, I won't rest

Haunted eyes, burn deep inside
Haunted eyes, never live
