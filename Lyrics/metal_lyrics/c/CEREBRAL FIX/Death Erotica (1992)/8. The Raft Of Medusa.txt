Think about me
As I slip away
I'm your brother
Don't let go of me

Moves so slowly
Across the open sea
Move a mountain
Medusa's got a hold on me

Waves above me
Like a child's mind
I'm now resting
Don't forget me

Moves so slowly
Across the open sea
Move a mountain
Medusa's got a hold on me

Heavy hearts, freele's in me
Medusa calls, she's pushing me
Tragic dignity awakens in me
Medusa calls, there's no humanity

Don't forget me
As you turn away
I'm now resting
Don't think ill of me

Dream about me
Of the way I died
I'm your brother
Don't you try to lie
