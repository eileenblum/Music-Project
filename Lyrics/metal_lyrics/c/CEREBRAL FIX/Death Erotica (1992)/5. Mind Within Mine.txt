My body and my soul
Rhythm in motion
I have full control

One life, think about it
Your life, don't you want it
One life, don't abuse it
Your life, think about it

In my mind, driving me wild
What thoughts lie
(And) what prevails

One life, think about it
Your life, don't you want it
One life, don't abuse it
Your life, think about it

Mind within mine
What path shall we find
Mind within mine
What fortunes twist our minds

What is me (and) what am I
Why do I feel so unreal
What speaks me (and) proves my while
Makes me fall (and) makes me kneel

Mind within mine
What path do we take
Mind within mine
What directs the uncertain mind
