Chains to my soul
(And) hatred pierces my heart as well
Reaching up towards the sky
Wishing that I could fly

Can you see the fire, splintered wings
Do you know the fear, splintered wings
Can you see the tears, splintered wings
Do you know the freedom of the splintered wings

Fear to be free
And your heart stops and tries to weep
Break the bonds, stretch out your arms
Fly to be free

Can you see the fire, splintered wings
Do you know the fear, splintered wings
Can you see the tears, splintered wings
Do you know the freedom of the splintered wings

Shackles bring me down
Down to the ground
Monolithic thunder
Crushes me down
Bonds pulling tighter
Ripping me in two
Voices cry out louder
Laughter snaps me in two

Bonds bring me down
As I try to hold my ground
I realize now I have to fly
Before I burn and die

Can you see the fire, splintered wings
Do you know the fear, splintered wings
Can you see the tears, splintered wings
Do you know the freedom of the splintered wings

Splintered wings

Can you see the fire
Do you know the fear
Can you see the tears inside

Can you see the fire
Do you know the fear
Can you see the freedom inside

Can you see the fire, splintered wings
Do you know the fear, splintered wings
Can you see the tears, splintered wings
Do you know the freedom of the splintered wings
