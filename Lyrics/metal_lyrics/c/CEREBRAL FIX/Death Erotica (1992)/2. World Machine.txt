Spindles turn in the rooms
Engines roar to the tune
Stoke the fire, overkill
Turning cycle, it's overdue

Time's running out
Running so fast
The pressure is on
We're on overdrive

Wheels seize to a halt
Labour silent to no groove
Suckon pulls in, override
Inside out, on overdrive

Time's running out
Running so fast
The pressure is on
We're on overdrive

World machine, engines burn
Fuel diseased, take me back
World machine, engines dead
Can't you see

Take me back, world machine
Engines burn, fuel diseased
Take me back, world machine
Engines dead, can't you see...

Silence falls in the womb
Mechanical soil starts to move
Quench the fire, overuse
There's no pity, there's no use

Time's running out
Running so fast
The pressure is on
We're on overdrive

Tears run to the soil
Blood entwines to be one
Stoke the fire, it's overdue
Bearing fruit as we smile

Time's running out
Running so fast
The pressure is on
We're on overdrive
