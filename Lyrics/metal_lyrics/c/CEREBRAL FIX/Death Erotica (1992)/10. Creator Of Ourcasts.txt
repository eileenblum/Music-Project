Pain,
Life causes pain
Dreams are my gain
Lost to the few
Scream out the shame
Lost out on life, I have no choice
Infected fate, lost to the grave

Life,
Life is a game
Dreams turn to shame
Lost out in time
Scream out the pain
Lost out on life, I have no rights
Pray to be free, lost to the grave

If god really loved me
Take me in his arms
Cradle me to heaven
(And) take away the pain
An outcast redeem me
Protect me from this sin
Cradle me in heaven
(And) take away the shame

Reasons flood in the rain
Whispers turn out again
Banished to be alone
I see the pain inside grow
Hatred is what they wage
Blood reaks of disease
Banished to be alone
I see the pain inside grow

If god really loved me
Take me in his arms
Cradle me to heaven
(And) take away the pain
An outcast redeem me
Protect me from this sin
Cradle me in heaven
(And) take away the shame

Reasons flood in the rain
Whispers turn out again
Banished to be alone
I see the pain inside grow
Hatred is what they wage
Blood reaks of disease
Banished to be alone
I see the pain inside grow

You made me pay
Watching my life slip away
My life now fades
My body wretched, wastes away

Innocent, I rot away
Wasted, you turn away
