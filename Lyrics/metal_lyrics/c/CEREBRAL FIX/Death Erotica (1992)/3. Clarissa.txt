Casualties of passion
That's what we've become
My love so dark incited
(And) yours will be won
(I) stole you for desire
(And) took you as my bride
When love became insane
Your purity was lost to be mine

Clarissa I love you
You stole my heart
I only live for you
Clarissa I love you
Shelter from the pain
I would die for you

Pursuit of beauty
My thoughts are so cold
The deceit and deception
When love blinded my soul

Clarissa I love you
You stole my heart
I only live for you
Clarissa I love you
Shelter from the pain
I would die for you

Passion for desire taking over me
Raped you of life, forgive me
God's your witness looking over me
I'll suffer deeply, forgive me...

Don't you die for my sins
I will follow to the end
Life was sweet for me then
Now I suffer for my sins
You're my way to the past
Death in life I won't rest
Love was mine lost again
Now I suffer for my sins

(I) made you suffer for my love
(I) took from you, made you mine
(I) made you cry for my pain
(I) took from God, defied his name

Tragedy of passion
What have I done
My love so enduring
And yours was never won

Clarissa I love you
You stole my heart
I only live for you
Clarissa I love you
Shelter from the pain
I would die for you
