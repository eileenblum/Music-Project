Living after midnight, rocking to the dawn
Loving 'till the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city about one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Living after midnight, rocking to the dawn
Loving 'till the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight, rocking to the dawn
Loving 'till the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long

The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

Living after midnight, rocking to the dawn
Loving 'till the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

[repeat and fade]
