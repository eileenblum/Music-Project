They walk this earth this wretched place
The dead remains of the human race
They hunt around for living flesh
Their own is rotting a bloody mess

You hide in fear in case they find you
They ate your parents your sister too
Your only protection is your father's gun
Look over there it's time for fun

Here comes a zombie
It's coming for you
It's getting closer
So what will you do
Here comes a zombie
Blood dripping wet
One way to stop it
Blow off its head

They walk this earth this wretched place
The dead remains of the human race
They hunt around for living flesh
Their own is rotting a bloody mess

They scream and groan an awful din
The pain of death that's deep within
Their puss filled bodies a rotting stinking mess
The one way to ease the pain is eating human flesh
