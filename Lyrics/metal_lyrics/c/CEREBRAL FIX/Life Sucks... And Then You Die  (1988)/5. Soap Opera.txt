Don't go away there's more to come
Just mindless dribble
One by one they'll twist your minds
You think it's true
Soap opera bullshit brought to you
By rich fat bastards
Not you or me
Who think it's how life might be
But to you and me
It just seems shit
They've got the money
So let them live it
