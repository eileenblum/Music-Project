Twisted minds of blood and slaughter
They'll only help if you sacrifice your daughter
Money's no object for those who believe
But government people will always deceive

Begging for mercy they bleed you dry
Confusion delusions you hear me cry
Don't fall at the altar
Don't let them win
Or you'll face a sentence of torture and sin
Behind the web of deception and hate
The wealthy grow fat in the world we create
They starve the needy
Don't give to the poor
They'll use you to wipe the floor
