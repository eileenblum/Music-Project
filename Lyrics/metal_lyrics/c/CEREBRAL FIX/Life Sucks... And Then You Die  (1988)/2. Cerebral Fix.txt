You're a cerebral fix
You're a cerebral fix

Your brains seized up
No function at all
The cerebrospinal has been
Sliced nerve to nerve

Your brains not working
As fast as it should
The cerebration does
Not register at all

Your brains burnt out
With electrodes and probes
There cerebrum has been
Cut from the skull

Your brain is dead
Yet you still exist
The cerebellum has been
Replaced with micros and chips
