Say goodbye to the world you know
For you'll die a thousand souls
Put the gun against your head
Pull the trigger now you're dead
You won't live for another day
For you'll die a thousand ways
Put the noose around your neck
Kick the stool now you're dead

Give me life
Give me life
Give me your fucking life
