In a wonderland of drugs
You fear me not
You feel my presence
Because you've taken the lot

Fear, fear, fear of death
Fear, fear, fear of death

In spins you around
Your head full of colours
Death looks certain
But you want to see tomorrow

Fear, fear, fear of death
Fear, fear, fear of death

You feel spasms
As they take your last breath
Your lungs cave in
When you see the sign of death

Fear, fear, fear of death
Fear, fear, fear of death

In a wonderland of drugs
You fear me not
You feel my presence
Because you've taken the lot
