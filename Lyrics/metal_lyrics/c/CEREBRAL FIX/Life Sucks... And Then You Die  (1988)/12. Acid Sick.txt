Only left with the memory
Fighting with my brain
Take the reigns and hold on
And you'll never be the same

Can't see the sky' cause
Acids in the way
You drown in your dreams and you
Don't want to stay
Acid sick
You hold on tight but it
Takes your mind
And when you come to your
Senses what do you find
Acid sick
