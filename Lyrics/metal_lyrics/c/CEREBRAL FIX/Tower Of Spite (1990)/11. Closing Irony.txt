On the brink of destruction the world trembles in fear
The madman is screaming, a crumpled corpse lying near
The people are fighting for what's left of the mess
Their minds blown to fragments now blend with the dust

The corpses are moving, hungry maggots give life
The brave men of the world have now fought their last fight
A mother's last scream as in death she brings life
An heir to the world that now whimpers and dies

The child is slaughtered as it leaves the womb
Fighting for air in this festering tomb
