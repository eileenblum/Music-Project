Feel the pinch, its deep inside
Traveling through at speed of light
Looking back through my brain
Memories pass relate to time

Seeing nothing and feeling pain
Pressure relates to my brain
Trying to think the passage of time
Saying nothing eternal pain

Time has come the sweetness dry
Told you nothing, it's all a lie
Its time to shake and realize
Nothings different its time to die

Holding out and taking back
Receiving in, nothing lasts
Feel the rush smile tonight
Turn my eyes, its time to die

Forced to be one
Accepted in the blood
Smile to receive
It won't happen to me

Forced to be one
Accepted in the blood
Smile to receive
Nothing better but to please
