Captured, taken, tortured in a cell
Beaten to death, no skin or bone
Rising an eyelid to the sight of death
Crushing blow of an angry first
Feel the snap of a fragile limb

Open the gates and lead them in
Starve their stomachs and see them die
Strip them down, till the bone is sought
Feeling of hatred is seen within
Give them shovels to dig their holes
Kneel in front and fill with bones
Feel the pressure, hit your head
Days of torture ending like this

Rising an eyelid to the sight of death
Crushing blow of an angry first
Crushing bone grinding death
Obeyer of sin has just begun
