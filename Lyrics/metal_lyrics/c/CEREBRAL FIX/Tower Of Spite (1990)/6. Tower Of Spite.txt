Pre-ordained judgements now abound
Half-truths and necrosis forever found
Jesters of friendship wound trust in flight
With spandu tongues from the Tower of Spite

Spitting venom to cover their tracks
Smiling sweetly behind their virtue mask
Do as we say, not as you do
So called unity crumbles, love falls through

Once they were friends, never
Love that never grew, denial...

Hand in hand, blindly dancing (the) piper's tune
No conscious your heart falls through
Negative thoughts spawned by your fucking fear
Mocking a destiny, (a) message so unclear

Outstretched arms withdrawn
A paranoia so uncaring
Dreams dashed on secure shores
Emotional retreat in defeat only sorrow

Hand in hand, blindly dancing (the) piper's tune
No conscious your heart falls through
Negative thoughts spawned by your fucking fear
Mocking a destiny, (a) message so unclear
