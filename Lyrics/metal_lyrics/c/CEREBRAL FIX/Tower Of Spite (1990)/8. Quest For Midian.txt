Ancient lost races
Enter into the core
(Their) lunacies and visions
Speak out to them all

Spirits now occupying
The inner dead core
Unholy lost tribes
Seeking out their (Holy) War

Reasons to fear the night
Those that watch now awake
Listening (to) destruction
Hoping to rise among the dead

Baphomet (the) god
The dead will bless
(Their) eyes drawn out
To those that look

Eternal dead pain
And life to the lost
Absolution
Nothing's ever lost

Come with me to Midian
Halfway to Hell, north of Heaven

Ancient races into the core
Lunacies and visions speaks for all
Revelations into dust
Deliverance, a must

Spirits occupying the inner core
Lost tribes seeking holy wars
City forgotten, only sought
Dreams and tales to them all

[Dedicated to Clive Barker]
