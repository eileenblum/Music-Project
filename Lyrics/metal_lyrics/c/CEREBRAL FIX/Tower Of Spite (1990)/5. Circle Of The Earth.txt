Great circle of earth
Pushing towards its birth
Planes perpendicular
New spheres are now turning

Blackened seas rising high
Swallowing whole and axis to pole
Changing climates, burning dry
Corroding whole, pole to pole, I say...

Circle of the earth...

When the sun meets the sea
The horizons will sink deep
Contours submerging
New borders are now forming

Then the levels will fall
Crumbling all the sea/city walls
Landscapes are changing
New borders are forming
