Discipline by your suffering
Mortify the flesh
Chasten of your fear
Sadistic feelings enter their heads

Chasten of fear
When everything is lost
Hidden in your terror
Mortify the lost
Chasten of fear
When everything is lost
Bound by your mortician
His forgiving love and lust

Discipline by your terror
Eroding their brains
Hatred born on fear
You become their pray
