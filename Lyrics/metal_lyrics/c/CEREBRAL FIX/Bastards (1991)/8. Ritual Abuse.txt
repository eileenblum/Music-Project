Look within your soul
And see what you feel
Words of their trinity
You become your own fear
Hatred breeds now

And hatred within
Enter beyond the void
And darkness will suck you in

Fear... their control
Hatred... burns your soul
Prophets... seek you out
Terror... their control

Satanic visions, the world is black
Desecration unfolds the past
Ritual abuse, child in pain
Ritual abuse, again and again
Lambs to the slaughter
Of your own blood
To sacrifice
The pleasure is lust
Ritual abuse, child in pain
Ritual abuse, again and again

Obey the pain, the abuse of the child again
Mother, father, hear me call out your names
