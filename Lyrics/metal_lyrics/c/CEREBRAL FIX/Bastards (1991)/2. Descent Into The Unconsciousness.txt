In my dreams I've travelled
I float along the wind
My mentality shattered
I know nothing only them

Method in my madness
Isolation breeds
Mentally immobilised
My living death I breathe

My nervous system frozen
An adolescence smile
Trance like stone features
I know not how to cry

Method in my madness
Isolation breeds
Mentally immobilised
My living death I breathe

Locked inside my inner self
Chronically ill-diseased
Trance life states of fortune
Resurrection free
