Genetic interference, middle third
Man-made species, extracted at birth
Bonded by your science
Created by man
New-born incision
The master plan
Taken from within, stored to improve
Destiny awaits, but we don't understand

Recreation
Cells form into one
Abomination
Man's created son
Experimental life
Science evolves man
Genetic interference
Many become one

Many become one
Never seen before
Science evolves faster
Generates superior form
Genetic infiltration, foetus stored
Divided and joined, middle third
Many become one
Existence so short
Science creates life
Generates tortured forms
Genetic infiltration, foetus stored
Divided and joined, middle third
