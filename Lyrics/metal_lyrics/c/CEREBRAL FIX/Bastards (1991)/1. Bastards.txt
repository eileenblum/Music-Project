This is our planet
The earth
Is diseased and corroded
By... bastards

Bastards that exploit the naive
Worship the materialistic gods
Bastards known as mammonites
Bastards that are multinational scum
Bastards that rape the ever decreasing rain forests
Bastards that maim the innocent
Bastards that abuse the silent
Bastards that pollute this earth
Bastards that extort from the poor
Bastards that murder and kill
Bastards that inflict all pain
Bastards that kill for god
Bastards that incite hatred
Bastards that torture for grace
Bastards that experiment with all life
Bastards that wipe out all life

This is our planet
Our home planet
Is corroded and diseased
By bastards
Known to us as ... man
