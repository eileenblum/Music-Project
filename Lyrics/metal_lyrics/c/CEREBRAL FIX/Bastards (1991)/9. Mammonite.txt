He calls out my name
When my life has no gain
Dragged from life to death
I breathe my last breath

Mammonites in control
Wealth becomes his soul
Lost in what he craves
His life opens our graves

The mammonite
Takes all I gain
Strips the world inside out
Until he achieves his gain
Illusions of lies
Controls everyday life
Strips the world inside out
Until he achieves his wealth

Death before life
Strive to survive
You have no life

Death before life
Striving to survive
Dominations of the mammonites
You have no life
