Return to my being
The sea calls out to me
Voyage is only beginning
But the earth pleads to me

Deeper down I go
Deeper within my soul
Cursed in our name
Extinction breeds in me
Follow the souls that lead
But what do I leave
Calls from beyond
Cry out in vain

Species now only recorded
Memories from in our minds
Our children begin to wonder
Why will they die?

Swallowed by the sea
The blackness evolves so deep
Clutching the life within
And corrupting the cycle that breathes
Chaos within chaos, the earth pleads to me
Death breeds so fast, I return to infinity

Twilight bound my life is put before me
Infinity welcomes me
Chaos will reign
Because of our stupidity
