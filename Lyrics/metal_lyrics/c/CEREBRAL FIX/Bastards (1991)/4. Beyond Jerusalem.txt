Wars have scarred and punished
This is our earth
God's creation divided
By our laws
Man will take
Does not give
Death upon the cross
Look what we have learnt

Beyond Jerusalem
Abode of heaven
Beyond Jerusalem
Sins to crucifixion

Death released us
From our sins
God's creation divided
By its sins
Man decides

Greed's his life
Bearing no cross
For our conscience pays

Beyond Jerusalem
Abode of heaven
Beyond Jerusalem
Cycle of the heavens
