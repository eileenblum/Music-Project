Release all your darken wishes
Love ain't what Christ Preaches
Fill your heart with world's sacred fear
Nothing Else could be as real

Come on be the martyr of my Pain
Live in Hope, Live in Vain
Climb up my rotten Spine
So Fatal, yet Divine

He said that grace comes from Above
So there's nothing to be the done
Blind faith is all he ever needed
Just to keep us Bleeding

Come on be the martyr of my Pain
Live in Hope, Live in Vain
Climb up my rotten Spine
So Fatal, yet Divine

Trying to Embellish all the Curses
You are building empty Churches
Taste my Truth, It's full of fire
It's the Place where romance died
