I'm setting myself free from you
Free from all the things you do
Letting love escape my soul,
Playing again this sad role

Let yourself free from your life
Free from all that breeds your lies
Come and share in my own Tears
Appreciate all my Twisted Fears

Our 666 burns in flames
Without you, without our blame
Pure nad Cruel it now rises
Beyond our Hate, beyond our Crimes
Our 666 burns in flames
Without you, without our blame
Pure nad Cruel it now rises
Beyond our Hate, beyond our Crimes

I'm setting myself free from you
Free from all the things you do
Letting love escape my soul,
Playing again this sad role

Let yourself free from your life
Free from all that breeds your lies
Come and share in my own Tears
Appreciate all my Twisted Fears
