Orator of the pure doctrine
Me inside the bloodshed
I know with arrogance
This old, crude principle

Give me the controversial falsehood
That I seek through the whispers
Find with maturity the aside
Of the pale ode for perdition

Constraint and conduct
From the servants of Liar
Within the soil debris
Now, we must divide wan from life

The dissipation begins inside us
Without defer for our mentality
It turns for new beliefs
About brute and cold blasphemy
