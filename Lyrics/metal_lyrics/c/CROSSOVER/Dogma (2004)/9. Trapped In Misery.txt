Look out, this pale sky
You'll just see this faint blue line
Difficult to sight the sun
Back from the irony and shame

Trapped for unknown reason
Without knowing, why
But on that dark evening
Your prints were on the knife

Trapped you will be forever?
Without the right of forgiveness
How will you end this misery?
Or the road to it?

A knife that you never touched
A knife that you never seen
But on that dark evening
Your prints were on the knife

Won't fell the Rays of the Sun
In a Cold Cell
Get used to it
Feel the Humiliation

Trapped you will be forever?
Without the right of forgiveness
How will you end this misery?
Or the road to it?
