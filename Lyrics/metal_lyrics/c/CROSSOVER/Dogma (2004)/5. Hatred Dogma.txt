When you want to show
That your life has passed away
When the death around you
Could reason be your voice?

Your feelings could change suddenly
Neither love, nor hate
Only the endless anticipation
For the alternation of His Dogma

Dogma, from the hate horde
Of merciless preachers of Jesus
Dogma, from all of them
Ulterior, servants of Him

And when we feel that season
Has passed away
We will dream of
The absolute freedom

Freedom to raise the voice
Pure outburst of rage
In this mysterious and not promised
Dogma of fear and hate

Dogma, from the hatred horde
Of merciless preachers of Jesus
Dogma, from all of them
Ulterior, servants of Him
