We're so Vain
Me and You both
Lost in the Dusty Rain
Of our Narcotic Love

Every night our bodies die
Our soul lies down drunk
And as the morning shines
Guilt and regret returns

Your Love got me confused
You Blackened river of Abuse
I don't have the strength to refuse
Your bleeding charms and snares

We're so Vain
Me and You both
Lost in the Dusty Rain
Of our Narcotic Love

Every night our bodies die
Our soul lies down drunk
And as the morning shines
Guilt and regret returns
