WE DIE!!!
We Die... In living Dreams
Clinging on to
Hopes... More Hopes of What
Only Sanity Left?

We sigh in our sleep - Pale faces
And down cast Eyes
Looking through our Lying Selves - Conscience
We cannot Claim

Since the day we killed...
Our own innocence
Miserably... Oblivious we Stay
Our True Call... (at last)

NO MORE THE WORLD
HEART BEATS IN UNISON.

ACHERON, AWAITS THE DEAD

ACHERON, AWAITS THE DEAD

We Die... In the Name of God!
