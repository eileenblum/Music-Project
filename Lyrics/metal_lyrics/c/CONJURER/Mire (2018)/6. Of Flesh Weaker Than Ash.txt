Breathe, warmth in your lungs, torn from the cord.
Eyes turn towards the skies, all is in sight.
Take a step out forwards,
Move through the haze, touch heaven.

Celestial being watches on.
All that is known, all that will be,
All that has come to pass, is written before me in flames.
Breathe, warmth graze the flesh, envelop the core.
Eyes, deaths marked your eyes,
Look not to the skies.

Born of a flesh weaker than ash,
We come to understand this life,
Stolen from God, was ours from the start.
And so it shall remain, no matter how meager,
This life stolen from God.

Our ever-ending eon dawns and fades,
So suddenly were left inside callous shadow.
