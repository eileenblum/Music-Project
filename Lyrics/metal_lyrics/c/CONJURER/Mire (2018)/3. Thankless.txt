I've had everything fall at my feet, yet I've nothing to offer.
A life filled with love that has none to repay.
There's only so much one can ponder their departure
'Fore it becomes an option they might take.

I am one who's given all but earns none of it,
Always a net to break my shortest of falls.
Should it be taken away, would I alter my ways?
Or let myself plummet into an early grave?

Is it a sin to curse the life I'm blessed with?
To let it all fade?
I know not the pains of this world, unlike so many others.

But I wonder what they would do had they the chance
To feel the bliss of ignorance once again.
The waning of life is a plight that burdens most.
How fleeting the woes when the end is what you covet.

Is it a sin to curse the life I'm blessed with?
To let it all fade? This slumber, so sweet,
For it is the closest thing to leaving.

Thankless squanderer.
Aimless wanderer.

Unworthy of your grief, yet grief throbs within.
Pain from lack of pain? Is it a sin to feel this way?
I've had it all fall at my feet yet wept when
All I had to do was kneel down and lift.

Thankless squanderer.
Aimless wanderer.
