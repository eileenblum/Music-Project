There is a world beneath us,
Endless and wall-less,
Yet we cannot enter.
Mere sunlight fails to penetrate
Through the vast plains of nothingness.

Unfit to venture its darkened fields.
This place cannot be claimed, inhabitants arcane,
Serf to the boundless murk.

This place cannot be claimed.
These creatures thrive in depths we cannot reach.
These beasts survive on prey they cannot see.
More is known of galaxies than this, the wretched deep.

There is a hell closer than Hell.
The pressure crushes down.
Where greatest mountains would drown.

Down.
This place cannot be claimed.
