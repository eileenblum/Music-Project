All day I think of nothing else than my friend
My hands are shaking, the sweat pours down my head
The pain - is all I feel
A tortured soul - But now it is the time to ...

Injecting in my veins
My sweet release
Lay back and rise above to watch the world below

Injecting in my veins
My enemy
Lay back and rise above to watch the world below

I lost my life!

How could this happen to me, I thought I could stop
I did not notice its grip stealthy increased
Now I am bonded to this endless craving
Hindsight is pointless, never leave my hell

I saw the needle disappear
But cannot enter my refuge
Quickly prepare another dose
Lay back and start my final trip
