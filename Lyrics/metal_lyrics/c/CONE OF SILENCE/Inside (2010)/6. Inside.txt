Yeah! Come closer, have a look and see what is behind
Rear the deep blackness you will find, that there is much more to descry

Scratch the surface
Pierce it through
Open up your mind

Don't dig to deep
And be aware or
Get mad for fear

It's inside all of us
It cannot be denied
To be shure - caged inside
Just push the hidden buttons or speak the magic words
And see what will be released
what should have stayed inside

Yeah! And once you know what sleeps inside your inner shell
Let loose control and watch yourself act with your demons by your side

Your mind is free
The sight is sharp
Everything is clear

Lean back yourself
And let it happen
Release your fears

It's inside all of us
It cannot be denied
To be shure - caged inside
Just push the hidden buttons or speak the magic words
And see what will be released

You lie to yourself
Suppress what is a part of you

Yeah, once released the secrets deep inside
Hard to take control again
In the neverending fight
