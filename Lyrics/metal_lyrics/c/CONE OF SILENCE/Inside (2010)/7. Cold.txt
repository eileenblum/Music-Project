Here I lie, bonded to machines, I cannot move myself
Sometimes awake, I hear you speak through a mist of pain - far away
Feel alone - Wait alone - For the end - I die
If I could - Only hold - Your face again - In my hands

Looking for - Cross the border - To get free from pain
My last trip - Out of life - Into the realms of death
I open up my tired eyes to see my loved, the last time
I try to whisper but I know, that I cannot be heard

Let loose
My life

I leave my body and see
The empty shell that once was me
I rise higher in the air
My loved still sit there and weep
Try to wave to you my dear
I know I cannot be seen
Turn around to the light
DonÂ´t know, why does it feel so ...

Cold, itÂ´s so cold
As I trespass
To the other side
Cold, itÂ´s so cold
As I trespass
To the other side

Irritated by the cold
It feels like being pierced by ice
This is not what I thought would come
I feel my soul will fade away into void

Let loose
My life

Life full of pain - death brought relief
All Pain and me annihilated
