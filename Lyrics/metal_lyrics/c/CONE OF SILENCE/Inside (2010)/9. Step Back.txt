Your rules are driving me dreadful insane
I could't care less of what you really want for me

I can decide just for my own
Don't need your self-serving advice
Your lies did never infect me
I raise my head and kill your last bit of influence on me

Yeah!

Coward
Step Back
Or I will beat you down

I stare
In your eyes
Until you bow your head

I won't give up or leave my path
So just get out of my way

Like an high-explosive bomb
I wipe you out of life
Now itÂ´s much too late for you
You should have gone away

Asshole
Go away
Why can't you leave it be

I won't
Be the fool
That will end up like you

I won't give up or leave my path
So just get out of my way

Step back and leap aside
Out of control
Step back or fear my fucking rage

Yeah!

Never believed
Your dreadful lies
