Hey, what's up with me
Why am I lying on the ground
On my back down, head into the sky

Why the hell am I here
My head seems empty and hollow
Very far away something calls

I watch the clouds go by
They move abnormal fast
I still cannot remember
Why I am lying here and cannot move

I Feel no pain or sorrow
Maybe it's just another dream
I try but cannot wakeup

When a gentle breeze
Starts to whisper of my past
Very long gone memories revive

I watch the clouds go by
They move abnormal fast
I still cannot remember
Why I am lying here and cannot move

No!

I see myself
Travel through my time
All memories appear and flush away my need to be

Like on TV
Everything I've done
All memories appear and flush away my need to be

My fucking deeds
All the good and the bad
See myself

Yeah!

I Feel no pain or sorrow
Maybe it's just another dream
I try but cannot wakeup

When a gentle breeze
Starts to whisper of my past
Very long gone memories revive

I watch the clouds go by
They move abnormal fast
Oh god, I now remember
Why I am lying here and cannot move

I see myself, lying down on the ground
I look into my pale grey eyes

All fears are gone, my body stays below
I rise into the nothingness

And now I know, that just one second has passed
Oh! Since the bullet struck my head!
