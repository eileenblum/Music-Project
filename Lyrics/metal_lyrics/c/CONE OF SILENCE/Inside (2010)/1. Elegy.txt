I have been chosen to suffer
Life of pain
Sacred victim, IÂ´m heavens breed?

Helpless part in the never-ending lie
Utilized
Betrayed by my own flesh and blood

To pay for others aims
It drives me mad
I feel alone

Now hear my elegy
Suffer eternally
Why donÂ´t you just save me - oh my lord
They torture me, please help me - oh my god

Father, they are raping my flesh
They slash me until I pass out
Feels like drowning in my holy blood
But you donÂ´t care of your breed

Hear my elegy
Suffer eternally
Why donÂ´t you just save me - oh my lord
They torture me, please help me - oh my god

Father, they are nailing my hands
To the cross to expose my harm
God, they fumble around in my wounds
But you donÂ´t care of your breed
