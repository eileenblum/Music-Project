I have been chosen
For mortal art
My hallow call
Of sculpturing with those who die

I look into your face
Ornated with your blood
Your eyes focus me
I am aroused by whatÂ´s to come my dear

Welcome to your death
IÂ´ll let you die in pain
There is no escape
IÂ´ll get my artwork done
Now you suffer from my hands that cut your skin
Begging for a rapid death in vain

My soul is frozen
So is my heart
Your passing, my kind of art

Ripping in your flesh
I like that tearing sound
Painting with your blood
Until iÂ´m satisfied
No, you canÂ´t expect me to have mercy
Cause youÂ´re serving for an upper purpose

My soul is frozen
So is my heart
Your passing, my kind of art

Bleed, weep, screach for me
As I pierce through your eyes
Blind, tied, on your back
I finalize my art

Bleed, weep, screach for me
As I remove your eyes
Blind, tied, on your back
My work is done

Yeah!

Welcome to your death
IÂ´ll let you die in pain
There is no escape
I will get my artwork done
Now you suffer from my hands that cut your skin
Begging for a rapid death in vain

My soul is frozen
So is my heart
Your passing, my kind of art
