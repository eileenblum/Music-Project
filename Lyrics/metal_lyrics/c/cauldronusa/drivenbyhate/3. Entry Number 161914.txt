In the twilight of morning, I rest my weary eyes
The benefits of the nightâs bounty are many, my soul has been redeemed
I miss my love tonight, hiding behind the figure I cannot bear to face
That of a dead prophet and his beast of burden
Skin soft and white eyes fire and ice just as I recall no longer than nine-score
Sheâs a feast from the gods fit for a prince
Her stature set in blackness behold my cold embrace those left alone will be alone
My mortal heart shall beat again like it did ten-thousand years ago
I will have her she is mine rise of the sun my test of time when shadows fall on unholy ground

Itâs time to sleep again itâs time to feast again
Forbidden blood can only taste this sweet not like the others raw meat
Symbolic arrow that pierces my heart takes the shape of a wooden stake
Now, I am the one crucified by desire
For her mortal soul, I would give my own entitlement for her sins alone
But that is not the nature of the beast I am denied
I will have her she is mine rise of the sun my test of time
When shadows fall on unholy ground I will make her mine in time now I must sleep
