These are the dark energies begun at the dawn of time
Not bred to life as usual born to shape mankind
Outliving those around you aeons judge your time
Three hundred years of tragedy, the manner of your life
Broken, burned and scarred forever doubtful that your youth will survive
In this timeless battle that you wish to lose you try to stop the process now decision not yours to choose

Fighting to live living to fight the only memories that exist in your mind
Why am I here, why must I go on behead me before eternal dawn this is the Quickening
Now is the time and itâs never too soon stop the aggressor still living in your room
Strife is the drainer force that is might pray for release by your sword tonight
Give me peace by your sword tonight this is the Quickening
