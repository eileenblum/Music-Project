Forced into this world, with no choice selfish assignment, forgetting the point
Peaceful existence, taken from you to suffer is everything, youâll ever do
Sickening canvas, displayed on the racks true inner-torture, so hollow the soul
Imparting on others, the pain that your feel
Dismissed as a madman, how could they know how would they learn?
How could they know how would they learn?

A product of you, with no remorse you gave them nothing, display of force
Victim aggression, this is their fate twisting their world, driven by hate
Taking of lives, means not to them your pain and your sorrow, means to the end
Death by ignorance, this is our belief humiliate society, dissolve the pain
Forbidden voice harvest by force this is my fate driven by hate
