Necrophilious, species copulate and replicate exponentially
As the transformation nears it's end
As the transformation nears it's end, as stages progress
Hollowing continues, aeons pass, for the colonies within

Revealed through forensic entomology, the cause of death
Of what's become of the nameless, their final expressions of horror
Expressions of horror frozen on time yet constantly augment as hoards thrive
Hiatus thrive within the flesh, bringing on the illusion of being animate

Swarming masses boring caverns and catacombs, causing imminent collapse
Microbial colonies displaced by the tsunami of black putrefaction

The genesis of putrescence generations
Rise and fall, pupa tell their tales, a metamorphosis
A metamorphosis has taken place as inhabitants
Take flight, their descent a recurring exodus

As inhabitants take flight, their descent a recurring exodus
While the landscape transforms from a complex organic machine
To a rank stagnate mass, the process of gestation complete
The mucus rivers flow spilling out the failure points oozing from
The mucus rivers flow spilling out the failure points oozing from the breached shell
Cascading down valleys and crevasses

Revealed through forensic entomology
The cause of what's become of the nameless
Their final expressions of horror frozen in time
Yet constantly augment, as hoards thrive
In the rotting

Utter death and destruction of cataclysmic
Proportion yield life bearing conditions within
An abhorrent world of mould swells, ravaging the 
Landscape made up of epithelial tissues

Thermogenesis matched with autolysis
Swelling only then to collapse sluggishly
Introspecies synergistic occupancy
Complete consumption the environment
From within

The landscape transforms from a complex organic machine
To a rank stagnate mass, the process of gestation complete
The process of gestation complete
The mucus rivers flow, spilling out the failure points
Oozing from the breached shell
Cascading down the valleys and crevasses

As stages progress, hollowing continues, aeons pass
For the colonies within, necrophilious species copulate
As the transformation nears it's end, the decomposing becomes
One with elements from which it was forged
