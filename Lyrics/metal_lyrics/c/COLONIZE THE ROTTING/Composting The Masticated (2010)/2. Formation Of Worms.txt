Beyond the horizon lies my collection of bodies heaped high
Relics of lives taken, piles of the savagely hacked and disfigured

Savagely hacked and disfigured
Entangled limbs hanging by threads
Screams echo in my mind

Flies and maggots ravaging the rotting, the sound deafening
A cacophony of swarming and slithering
Their tortured screams echo in my mind

They speak to me, calling for me to lie with them, I feel sick when I'm away
I visit the clusters often squirm my way in, guts and skin draped over me
Slime cascades down my face, I fuck the folds of flesh as bodies are continually
Etched away by vermin, the aroma so vile I vomit within the pile

Monstrous are the teaming masses of maggottus municipalities
Inhabiting the cluster, this formation of worms is my legacy
Nothing else matters but the continued acquisition of bodies
Twisted into forms that the voices deem worthy

I'm condemned to remain with the savagely hacked and disfigured
Bound by my sickness to satisfy my lust to kill
Trapped by my compulsion to writhe within the multitude
Truncated and molested victims continue to multiply

Inthralled in the rotting body, transports me to the first time we met several months ago
The sexual ecstasy far more intense this time, stricken with adoration at what I have created

Beyond the horizon lies my collection of bodies heaped high
Relics of lives taken, piles of the savagely hacked and disfigured
Nothing else matters but the continued acquisition of bodies
Twisted into forms that the voices deem worthy

I'm condemned to remain with the savagely hacked and disfigured
Bound by my sickness to satisfy my lust to kill
Trapped by my compulsion to writhe within the multitude
Truncated and molested victims continue to multiply
Bodies heaped high
Relics of lives taken, piles of the savagely hacked and disfigured
Nothing else matters but the continued acquisition of bodies

Envious of worms for their residence, gorging on my trophies
Pained to point of nausea without the urge to kill fulfilled
Obsessing the need for collection of decaying organic mannequins
Disdain for my life longing to instead remain within the clusters lifeless

Feeding upon my disease
Thriving on cadaveric butchery
Lascivious sexual grotesqueries
Consume my every thought
