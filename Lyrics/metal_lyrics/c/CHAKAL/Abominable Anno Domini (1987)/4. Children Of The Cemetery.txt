Children... behold macabre vision
Your white and cold skin
Looks like they're made of wax
There's no life anymore
They don't mind...

Dead children...
Eyes fix the unknown
Frozen tears...
Beyond life-beyond grave
They call me again
Children-before they get rotten
On their little coffins
They go slowly to their grave
They don't mind...

The acid rain corroding my flesh-dead
Children... they're all mine
Their evil eyes look my terror
Their little cold hands take mine

But they don't want me to feel scared
The cemetery has became a big playground
Mother death embrace her children

You can hear them playing on the garden
They're all dead

[Solo: pepeu]

I'm telling you the last story
Their dreams don't mind anymore
While I sleep-I feel their presence
At night they call me again

I see their eyes watching me through the window
Covered by their white shrouds
Smiling at me through their dead lips
