My phantoms are my hangmen
My soul is a lost city... foresaken
Some shit is on the way but it's time to go
Wild and unknown is the night
It makes my demons real

Hypocrites
Chained with their greed, ignore me
You-infectious cancer of the universe
Agonizing while I hit their faces against the wall
May not the mankind suffer
The betrayers are praying
Through the mist-I watch you decline

Black flags
Fighting against the strong wind
Black gods
Concrete images on the sky
(see it or die!!!)
May not the mankind suffer
The betrayers are praying
Through the mist-I watch you decline
Kneel down-show your pain-cry out you
Stupid agony
You're living through pieces
Destroyed is your castle of lies
Suicidal winds inside your mind
Your own nightmares-now they trap you
Your own demons-now they eat you slowly
Breath your guilty, mankind
Show me our bowels

[Solos: pepeu - mark]

And in the middle of nuclear hell
Fire and cancer hit your flesh
From my eyes the blood flows
My hands fucked by wounds
Rise towards the sky
I fall down among the desolation
Lifeless bodies on my feet
(they will never feel the pain again)
Behold!
The horizons in extermination
You'll never see it again
You'll never hear the bells toll again
How we were wrong...
