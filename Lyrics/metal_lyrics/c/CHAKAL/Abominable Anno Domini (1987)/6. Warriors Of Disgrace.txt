Panic!!!
Exploding in the crowd
Devastating nations
Fucking this world
Nations crushed without mercy
Troops marching out to the slaughter
Warriors!!!

Satan the monarch of evil and lust
Taking the world in his hands
Mankind pays his price with blood
He is in front of the troops

(the warriors are coming!)

Growlings-blasphemies-mankind suffer
Warriors of disgrace-we die!
Plagues and curses, on their swords
Shines the seed of hate

[solo: mark]

Tyrants will rise
Rotten corpses in front of the Satan throne

[solo: pepeu]

Growlings-blasphemies...
