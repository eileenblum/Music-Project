Looking for you and thinking
Trying to understand
Why do you keep on prayin'
If you don't know what it means

You go to the church
They absolve your sins
Then you repeat 'em like before
But you're feeling high and free

You fought but that's the wrong way
Can't you feel that it was all
In vain... for nothing

Following what you say
Woud be better than repeat again
So just don't pray in vain
And then you'll find the real way

You fought but that's the wrong way
Can't you feel that it was all
In vain... for nothing

Is that what you want to believe?
The passport to a better life?
Are you sure?
It's never too late
