All those moments will be lost in time
Like tears in rain... Time to die
Off world colonies... new lands to begin again
Eat raw fish, noodles... search skinjobs, raw and cold

Tortoise, same as turtle... IQ test, emotional
response
Three males, three females... just four left to retire

Artificial owl... Perfect skinjobs
Artificial Rachel... Past borrowed

Dying, hands are the first
Bleeding nose, mouth and ears
Painful to live... in fear

That's what it is to be a slave
End, love for any life
Quite an experience to live... in fear

Orange body, green legs
Eggs hatched, mother eaten

Not supposed to have feelings
XB-71, artificial snake

Too bad she won't live, perfection won't last
Loving her future, life without past

Age of techno God, creation of perfect beings
Automatic prayers for life.. Age of synthetic feelings
