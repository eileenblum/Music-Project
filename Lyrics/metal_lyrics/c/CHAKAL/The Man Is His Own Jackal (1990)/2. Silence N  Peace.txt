Lord of history, owner of yesterday and tomorrow
In your hands are the life and death keys
No questions, take us from here
And we close our eyes and say "OK!"

Now our home is rest, our clothes is light
Forever... silence 'n' peace
Taken to the country of life, to the country of death
Silence 'n' peace... Peace!

The combat is over and all the doubts
There won't be more pain
There won't be more tears

Without questions
Take us from here
And we close our eyes
And say... "Fuck off!"

Lord of history, owner of our destinies
To you we trust our lives and so our souls
