Analyzing my vision of reality
I send it away 'til I wanna return
It may seem that I'm the only one
But both of us know I'm not

But why do we destroy everything we touch?
Are we man's evil?
It seems obvious to me

I don't like what I see with my eyes
My escape? Another dimension
Watching time fade through my memories
'Til something makes me think

That we can live some other way
Just living our lives
But it's not that obvious to me

Feel no pain
Walking inside your minds
Leave your flesh and blood
And seek for what's behind
