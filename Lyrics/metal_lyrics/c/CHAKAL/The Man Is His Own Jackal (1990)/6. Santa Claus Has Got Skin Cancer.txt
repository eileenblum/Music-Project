Red cheeks exposed
Travelling over the poles
Under ozone holes
Acquired skin tumors

Santa Claus has got
Has got skin cancer
Old December flyer
Great capital amasser

Poor children are free
From anguishing ads they see
No delusion to believe
And await him on Christmas Eve

Old reindeer retired
Xmas commercial end
No exploit next years
No gifts, no socks, no fears

Church was your creator
Capitalism made you fat
You aren't tricking anybody else
You're lost... Motherfucker!
