Desperate and did I bin this all I give
As the addiction pulls me in
But I have nothing left to give
And when I called your name, you walked away from me
You left me beaten down, down on the ground
To save yourself
You left me beaten down
Torn my hart out to save yourself
Save yourself
Desolate alone in the dark, as the ground beneath me starts to give
Slipping through the cracks and I'm loosing everything I am
Feeling like a monster coming up from underneath
Escape
You love me beaten down
Down on the ground
To save yourself
You love me beaten down, thorn my heart out to save yourself
Save yourself
Just save yourself
I've tried so hard to leave this place
As all is given me is pain
This pain is killing me
Never would have thought that you could be so heartless
I would have given you everything, but you just let me drown
You let me drown
You let me drown
You let me drown
You let me drown
To save yourself
I have to pull you down to save myself
Save myself
Save myself
