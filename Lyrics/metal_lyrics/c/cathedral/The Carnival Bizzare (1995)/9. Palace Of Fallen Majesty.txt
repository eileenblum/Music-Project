We are guided by the moon 
Into our palace tomb 
Shrine of dead king Midas 
Whose gold turned into stone
Children of the grave 
Entombed in a faceless day 
Are we the ones insane
To carry a spirit flame 

Skeleton of centuries 
Oh solemn majesty 
You'll stand again 
Unveil the key 
Grant life to we
On this violet night 
We await your sight 

As the splendour falls 
Upon these naked walls 
In the haunted garden 
A velvet raven calls 
Temples born of ice 
Release a solemn chime 
Into twilight thunder 
Within the sands of time 

Skeleton of centuries 
Eternal mysteries 
Released from pain 
Again we die 
To breathe in vain 
Seared wealth of truth
By your touch restored

Summer seized in the grip of twilight fair 
As we conceive to retrieve our rightful fortune 
Mourn not we, in lost shapes of time reborn 
To bathe in seas of you - oh blackest dawn

We find salvation in a palace of dead kings 
Hold a knife to the dawn - climb into the dream
