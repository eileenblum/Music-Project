Inertia's cave surrounds my heart 
Stalactites crashing down 
In stinking shades delusion cascades 
Of torment, yes I crave 
Here with the snakes 
My venom dehydrates 
Into my stream I hear your scream 
Sucking at my veins 

My final plea, enveloped 
In rapture seething 
Inertia's cave dementia echoes 
From the ceiling 
Staring down, heavens eyes are bleeding from black stars 
In crimson rain, seasons blend in cold arms dying 
Where flowers die, my spirit thrives 
I glisten in your pain 

The burning eyes of truth devise 
The torture master plan 
Mythology 
Poisoned reality 
Rattling bones 
Festering insane 

My final plea, enveloped
In rapture seething
Inertia's cave dementia echoes 
From the ceiling 
Staring down, heavens eyes are bleeding from black stars 
In crimson rain, seasons blend in cold arms dying 

Light my way 
Through the weeping veil 
Violet seas 
Autumn bride we sail
Kiss the wind 
Rejoice on wave of grave 
Desolate face 
Torment now erased

Copper sunsets
Metal shore of hope alive
Under clouds of thorns 
Frozen moon 
Tranquil through the mist of pain 
To you we sail...

Frail is the mind 
Who lets me inside 
Now your blood runs cold 
A parasite at your feast prepared 
For wealth decay 
The withered wreath 
Your weakness made for you 
Before your time society 
Will take this from you too! 

My final plea, enveloped In rapture seething 
Inertia's cave - dementia echoes 
From the ceiling 
Staring down, heavens eyes are bleeding from black stars 
In crimson rain, seasons blend in cold arms dying 

Light my way
Through the weeping veil 
Violet seas 
Autumn bride we sail 
Kiss the wind 
Rejoice on wave of grave
Desolate face 
Torment now erased
... ...dancefloor dementia...
