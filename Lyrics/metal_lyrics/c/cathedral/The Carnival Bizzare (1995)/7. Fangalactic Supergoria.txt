With fangs of lust we hail the night 
From tombs arise in mortal fright
Feeding from skies of morphia 
Fangalactic Supergoria 

Slaves of virtue rotting in the sun 
Souls for mutilation is sacrificial mass 
Pleading for heavens on their bleeding knees 
We dream of nothing but this black euphoria 

As through skies icy veins we glide 
Blades of lightning cleave your mind 
Exploding stars, trembling earth 
Fangalactic Supergoria 

Sin - doctrination in the church of flies 
Mental extinction kingdom of demise 
Monarchy of corpses state of suicide 
Grants you nothing but this black euphoria! 

Energy forces from the grave 
Soul invaders of mystique 
As cadaver we roam the planes
Abandoning chains of flesh

Uncoil the serpent 
In duality you are one 
Between life and death 
Find the threshold you are born

Fall to black master 
Awake yourself from life 
Back through centuries you die
Ahead of time 

Slaves of virtue rotting in the sun 
Souls for mutilation in sacrificial mass 
Monarchy of corpses, state of suicide 
Grant you nothing but this black euphoria 

Energy forces from the grave 
Soul invaders of mystique
As cadavers we roam the planes 
Abandoning chains of flesh...
