Waning autumn, winter blue 
Tonight we dance in praise of you 
Oh reaper scream a silent serenade 
Of tunes above earths grave
Enigma bites our world in grey 
To kill the morning jester fade 
Our host of nocturn is the ghost of day 
The cosmos for you paved 

The milky way pours over me 
We own the stars and night 
Angel of death has set us free
Blue light of pure insight 

Planetary suicide 
From violence of red sun we hide
Long live disciples of eternal night 
In praise of moonlit sky

The milky way pours over me 
At one with stars and night 
Angel of death has set us free 
Blue light of pure insight 

Take his hand 
To the land of dreams 
Fear not his purple might 
Truths unfold
With the grace of death 
Iron lace ties our embrace
