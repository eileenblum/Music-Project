She rides to the sabbath 
Veiled under silver light
To make love to the devil 
Necromancer of nyte 
Within the mystic forest 
She sets your world alight 
Her coven conjure the demons 
Herald the sacrifice yeah 

Lucifera Vampirella 
She bares the mark of the devil 

Queen of the witches 
Her kingdom is your hell 
Black masses in the convent 
Priests under her spell 
The crops have withered 
The sky bends upside down 
Her name is Lucifera 
The mutant preachers yell yeah 

My name is Hopkins 
I'm the witchfinder general 
My impotence deceives me 
You beauty turns me pale 
Winds haunt the village 
Satan's ghost awakes 
The world falls into darkness 
As she melts at the stake yeah 

Matthew Hopkins witchfinder general
Your soul condemned to hell
