Myriad atomic spectres transcend 
From the goodness of earth ad amen 
Electric legion on a voyage way 
Beyond the end yes
The end
Invocation through a crystal coffin pipeline 

One second in eternity
A lifetime in this grave

Electric grave 
Soul and mind are saved 
Colossal incantation 
Human mushroom cloud 

Ambassador of this mortuary condemned 
Under a scythe the silence of a din
Howling vortex begging repent for their sins - 
Yes their sins
Celebration of life we have found without them 

Empire falling down 
Our beauty shall reign 

Electric grave
Soul and mind are saved 
Colossal incantation 
Human mushroom cloud 

Press the final button now!
See the melting man 
Radiation madness 
Earth snorted by satan yeah! 

From the electric grave 
True believers saved 
From the electric grave

From the electric grave 
Astral stairs are paved 
True believers saved 

Snowblind, we burn we meditate 
Final vision of people fading away 
Together our souls will join minus hands 
No promise but we shall find our land 

From the last nightmare...
