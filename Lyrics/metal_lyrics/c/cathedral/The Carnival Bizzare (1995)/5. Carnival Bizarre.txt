Ride with me on a shooting star 
Through galaxies of death we chase 
Skeletal king of paradise 
Cosmic crown is the jewel you wear 

Carnival bizarre 
Freaks and lepers step right up 
Circus of macabre 
All the devils are rockin' hard 

Silver mountain of razor blades 
The masses ascend to a golden lie 
Evil angels in bloody lakes 
Await to celebrate their fate 

Carnival bizarre 
Freaks and lepers step right up 
Circus of macabre 
All the devils are rocking hard 

Metamorphisised 
From the ghost machine we fly 
Through circles of gold 
To our celestial throne 
Galaxies have died 
Dragons breath has frozen 
Chaos in serpent forms 
Manifest the universe

Crystal phoenix of midnight sky 
Carry the burning souls away
Legions of frost we leave behind 
Celestial gardens of love we share

Carnival bizarre 
Freaks and lepers step right up 
Circus of macabre 
All the devils are rockin' hard 

II Freak out of the mellow man

Cosmic psychonaut 
Earth into skies last port 
Space turning over now 
We elevate our thoughts
Wilderness as we abort, oh yeah!!!
