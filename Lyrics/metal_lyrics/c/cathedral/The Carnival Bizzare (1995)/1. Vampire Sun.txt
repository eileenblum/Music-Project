Skull of god with the devils eyes 
Crowned in fire sodden sky 
Beaming rays of genocide 
Into virtues magic lie 

Illusive myth of light enslaves you 
Vampire sun it drains you

Beg the sword for liberty
Fall before the king of flies 
Delirium is flowing free 
In our obedience disease 

The gift of life is reaped of value 
Vampire sun it drains you 

Gaze into the face of fire 
Dreams descend into the pyre 

Monolithic angel 
Unveil your king to this planet disabled 
Mummify the cosmos 
With the vision of divinity yeah! 

Electric vulture flying high 
Through the universal eye 
To cleanse the heavens with earth soul 
The excretion of mankind 

Feeding from the fangs of virtue 
Vampire sun it drains you 

Gaze into the face of fire 
Dreams descent into the pyre
