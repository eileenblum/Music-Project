[Jennings/Jehan &amp; Dorrian]

Whhoooaaa!

Your face, the furnace of my soul
The endless lies that we told
Clear blue waters in which we bathed
The yesterdays we failed to save

Still I see how we cannot be

[Chorus:]
Ashes you leave as you ascend from me

The leaves that fell unto our graves
And with the love that we made
The tree that filled my eyes
Tomorrow's yesterdays in stone engraved

Still I see we cannot be

[Chorus:]
Ashes you leave as you ascend from me

Oh the black you gave me
The love you gave me
The anti-fears of pain (???)
Our love's my shelter
I try to fill up
Clouds of dust ???
It was a lie
Snow in those eyes
I tasted that wine too much
And now I sit
Beside our graves
And hold her hand ???

Weep for autumn skies shrouded in misty air
Weep for thy solemn dearth and for thy chill despair

[Chorus:]
Ashes you leave as you ascend from me

Demons ???

Ooh!

As shadows pass
In the misty night
Over though, on and moving fast
???
Ashes to life

Into darkness into night
???
