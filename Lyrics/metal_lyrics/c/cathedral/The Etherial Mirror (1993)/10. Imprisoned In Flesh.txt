[Jennings/Dorrian]

Wishing that the sun would shine,
flesh wasting dreams inside.
In this prison burning light,
which fades on the outside.

I only want to believe,
that there's a place better for me,
a union where lost souls meet,
where I can share this flame with thee,
hide and reach beyond entropy,
in all that you seek - burn with me.
