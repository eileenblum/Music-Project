[Jehan &amp; Dorrian]

Cold sin and fire, burning wrath and anger,
this crippled splendour of lust so dire yeah!
Insane visions of beauty, groanings so empty,
wriggling in agony, the frail corpse of love that's me.

Hair and eyes limbs and faces,
bending hard in fierce embraces.
Ooh this loveless rage, come give me pain -
arcane exotica, ooh grim luxuria.

[Chorus:]
Twisted lust on fire,
love the bastard liar.

Sick grins of pleasure, warped torsos in heaven,
bending tongues - saliva, licking lifeforms of grotesque.
On the floor bones cracking, like evil dogs mauling,
grunting in this ecstasy, - shaking, screaming, clawing me!

Pleading eyes mangled faces,
torn apart, in growling places.
Ooh this seething cage, white light in vain,
arcane exotica - grim luxuria.

Twisted lust on fire,
love - the bastard liar.
Oh sweet sanctity, -
hell is pouring over me.
