[Here are four different versions of the lyrics of 'Phantasmagoria' that were send by fellow Cathedral nuts.
Phantasmagoria means a 'constantly shifting complex succession of things seen or imagined', according to my Franklin dictionary.
The lyrics themselves seem to be about the nightmarish appearence of some jellied master as far as I can pick them out.
Having four different versions already indicates that it is everything but easy to make out what is being sung here.
In addition to this it seems to me that Lee is changing the consonants in the words every now and then (I wonder if this has anything to do with the consume of this funny tobacco stuff...).
Well, anyways, here it goes.
Questions, remarks, and additions are welcome.

Hear the calling,
Any other way.
A faint slithering....
A form blooming,
A vision or nightmare?
Shadows motioning.

Bled hollow/holler (?)
Agents so hateless (?)
Eyes all grown ordained (?)
Reflections frozen,
Smiles so darkless,
And for the days contained.

Oooh it's creeping closer,
Oh it's here again.
CHORUS
Break - your wealth - has fallen,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
???
Drenching down the halls.
Bleeding angels...?...of heaven,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Awake...in blood and see,
That sin has come to call!

???
???
And hunger for the blade.
A wriggle purple,
Anguish and mourning,
Squelching for the chain (?)

I sunkered, greend lips mulching,
Hunger trickling.
Into the gates - The Jelly Master
Wobbling, Jiggiling.

Smooth and soft,
I'm all sweet.
???...just too brave for meeah!
Shredding, rotting in the face of death (?)
???
A vacuum slide -- Awake Again!

And all my heart,
Absolved in filth.
A rested anguish - sorrow and woe
Into nothingness (?) - so low

Paint earth this groaning, oh! (?)
Mottled rapids ??? ...drowning snow (?)
All lonely on the word alone (?)
Towards DoomWards -
Here I go!
Oh so low

Roaming through,
This liquid maze.
Slithering path,
Ancient pay/pave (?)
To the stinging place,
The loving phaze. (?)
Jiggling master,
Take me on my way.
All but butterflies here,
This wriggling haze.
Beyond decay (?) ???

???
To nothingness and nether-peace...
??? - I scream and roar.
(goodnight master)

[Justin]

Daylight crawling
And, the other way-
A faint slithering...

A form looming,
A vision of nightmare,
Shadows motioning.

Led harder         (?)
Vengeance so ageless
A rising ??
[sounds like "scrotal king"]

Reflection frozen
In smiles so dauntless
Another dirge contained!

Oooh, it's creeping closer...
It's here again!

[Chorus:]
(Rip your will apart)
??  farther!....yeah yeah
(For this frown, this heart)
Traipsing down the halls
(Bleeding angel bleed)
??  heaven... oh yeah oh yeah!
(wake in blood and see)
? has come to crawl.

Rotting ??
[sounds like "showness"]
???
A hunger for the blade

A regal purple
Anguish and mourning
Waltzing in the jade

Eyes sunken
Green lips mulching
Hunger trickling...

Into the gates
the jelly master,
wobbling, jiggling!

[Chorus]

Ooh, smooth and soft
and almost sweet
?? just too grey for me
spreading rotten in the face of death
In ? of flesh, the end of rain (reign?)
???
Await again!

From the sky, when my stars have fell.
And of my heart, a tolling bell
? of anguish, sorrow and woe,
Into ? - so low!!

Faint mirth is growing, oh!
From the ?, droning so.
Alone beyond the word alone,
Waltz doomwards, here I go!!

-Oh, so low!-

Roaming through
this liquid maze
Slithering past
the ancient grey

To the stinging place
longing face
jiggling master
send me on my way
All but butterflies in
this wriggling haze
Beyond the gates every ?
[sounds like "tray"]
Knows only ? and these visions cease
[sounds like "buttons"]
Nothingness and never peace
The flags of death that scream of more!
[solo]

(oooh, jelly master)...

[James]

They are crawling under your doorway
A faint slithering

A form looming, a vision of nightmare
Shadows motioning

Red horror vengence so ageless
Arriving __ ordained

Reflection frozen in smiles of darkness
Above the dirt contained

Ohhh it's creeping closer
It's here again

[Chorus]

Write your will upon lost fathers(???)
Yeah yeah

All this rot that is trapsing down the halls

Bleeding angels flee from heaven
Oooh yeah yeah

Awake in blood and see that Santas(???) come to call!

Rotting shoulders, loathsome __
Hunger for the blade

A regal purple, anguish and mourning
Waltzing in the chain

Eyes sunken, green lips munching
Hunger trickleing

Into the gate, the jellied master
Wobbleing jiggleing!

[Chorus]

Smooth and soft and almost sweet
Target just to great for me

Shredded rotting in the face of day
In the bones and flesh and in the brain
Our shattered soul awaits the death

From the sky all my stars have fell
And on my heart and soul a knell
They rest in anguish, sorrow and woe
In gelati(??) so low

Baked mud is glowing on
Bottle top is drowning sound
Lonely on the word alone
Holds too much, here I go

Oh so low

Drowning through this linguid maze
Slivering path, ancient grail, to the stinging rays
Love it fades, jiggleing master, send me on my way
On with butterflys in this wriggleing haze
Beyond the dead __ tray

No __ __ this visions see

__ (couldn't get this bit!)

The blades of death that scream out raw

Jellied master
