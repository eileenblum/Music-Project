[Jennings / Dorrian]

As I walked through fields of innocence
My dreams were distorted with no defense
Earth's creatures beside me, what a joy to be
Bright flowers, gay sunshine, sweet destiny

Then one day scarecrow greeted me
My mind began to see truths unfolding
So I built - a house up in a tree
To view reality and began observing
From there I saw an abattoir for minds
A system of lies man is enslaved in
Murdered thoughts, human machinery
In life's factory keep the wheels turning

Now that the sun sets upon this magic land
My eyes are wide open to the ill fate of man

They put me in a place to educate
Instead my mind was raped, not yet turned eight
Stories of crucifixion and moral codes to live life by
Force-fed lies, defiled, brainwashed and blind

Then a priest with fire in his eyes
Warned me of my demise if I stopped believing
He said young man you'll burn in hell you see
Christ is your sanctuary, so just be subservant
Stand up and fight, defend your country
Kiss feet of the elite and you shall inherit
Your wealth up in the sky but first you have to die
And live in poverty - keep the wheels turning

Now that the sun sets upon this fated land
My eyes are wide open to the ill deeds of man

Where is this place, I once wondered free?
A funeral of dreams became reality

Grey concrete, human cage - society
Joys butchered, blind envy, bleak destiny
Killing yourself to get by in this murdered world
Words, music on black plastic; the truth!

Black towers over you and me authority
Destroy your will to be if you let them own you
Reclaim your mind, view life through your own eyes
You soon may realise your own true meaning
Fuck their wars, religious lies and laws
Guilt trips you're not the cause, don't just accept them
A life of misery they want for you and me
Just drink and be merry - stop the wheels turning

Now that the sun sets upon this magic land
My eyes are wide open to the ill fate of man
