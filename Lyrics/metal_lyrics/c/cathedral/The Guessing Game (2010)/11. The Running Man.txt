[Dorrian]

Black wings wrapped around the sun
Darkness guides your marathon
Icy people everywhere
Cold love and cold thoughts they share

Live your life in a coffin
How much death can you cram in
Greedy man is wealth hungry
Orgasms at other's misery

A brand new watch to tell the time
See the hours passing by
Your castle is your golden dream
Living a lie with your bought queen

Possessions own your shallow mind
Plastic goods you'll leave behind
Humoured by your garden gnomes
Soon you'll rest beneath their thrones
