[Jennings / Dorrian]

City streets are filled with crime, politician's laugh and dine
Pubic stare of murdered eyes, living statues, souls have died
Concrete cancer setting in, another war about to begin
In freedom's coffin life rotting, release me from this social din

Mythic places only I can see

Painting pictures in the dark of a place less stark

Spiral staircase in my mind after midnight sense climb
Building castles in the sky, gateways to another life
Stallions of destiny take me to celestial seas
Aphrodite waits for me, we swim into eternity

Epic places only I can see

Painting pictures in the dark of a place less stark

Wealth of minds in poverty, dying world, what's left for me?
Outcast of reality, close my eyes so I can be

In mythic places only I can see
No murdered faces of reality

Painting pictures in the dark of a place less stark
