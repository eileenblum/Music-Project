[Jennings / Dorrian]

My mind is a locked room and she has the key
Five dolls for an August moon, on this island I await my doom
Seeing through cat's eyes everything's black
Colours of darkness peer through the cracks
Escaping from death row, is easier I know

Edwige's eyes cast a spell on me
Edwige's eyes queen of Giallo movies

Black spider prophecy she cast her spell on me
Demons of the dead run riot in my head
Pleasure and torment all in one place
Desire covered in blood and black lace
Investigate this crime release me from death's chime

Edwige's eyes cast a spell on me
Edwige's eyes queen of Giallo movies

Escaping from death row, yes it's easier and I know
The demons of the dead run a riot, they're in my head
Seeing through cat's eyes everything's black
Colours of darkness peer through the cracks
Release me from death's chime, investigate this crime

Edwige's eyes cast a spell on me
Edwige's eyes queen of Giallo movies
