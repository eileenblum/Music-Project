[Jennings / Dorrian]

Stillness of the darkest night
Flickering candle burning bright
Smoking incense elevates
The senses from life's worldly weight
Aroma's drift from heaven's leaves
Guiding thoughts across astral seas
A purring cat sits next to me
To share this oh so wondrous eve

Flickering candles, midnight sky
Feline presence senses high

Deep red wine of natures vine
Stimulates thy tortured mind
Away from violence here I find
A sanctuary of peace sublime
A full moon glows above the sea
It's shimmering light of mystery
A cosmic wilderness to see
Beyond the stars I yearn to be

Midday Sun, violence breeds
Wealth competition, mankind's disease

I get up in the morning to face another day
A world obsessed with money, I gotta get away
So tired of people fighting everywhere I go
Too many faces frowning for no reason they know, no
As twilight comes the evening sets majestically
At one with the cosmos my thought wander free

Physical prison, chains of time,
In life's gallery of order signs
Restricted curfews of the mind,
Switch it off leave them all behind
