[Jennings / Dorrian]

Question marks of life, answers we must find
Where did we come from, where do we go

Rats are running faster racing against time
Desperate to get past his life and be with God divine

Take your time - oh yeah - take your time
Casket chasers

Told what to believe, eyes cannot see
Obsessed with afterlife, I'll live this one first Christ

Rats are running faster racing against time
Desperate to get past this life and be with God divine

Take your time - oh yeah - take your time
Casket chasers

Soon we'll face cold ground, no longer be around
Until worms must feast, just let me live in peace

Rats keep running faster racing against time
Desperate to get past this life and be with God divine

Take your time - oh yeah - take your time
Casket chasers
