Riding on the flames of death
Into this last night fear relents
As we race through skies upon Azrael's wings
He has com to set us free from this earthbound misery
Father of macabre you possess the key

To heavens black galactic morgue
Chosen few seek your reward
In solitude, perpetual silence
Cosmic womb, eternal solace

Embracing cosmic mysteries
To worlds below he's sent a wreath
Elated black angel; our requiem he sings
As tears of Nebula fill black holes
Drowning galaxies of lost souls
We continue our ascent to heavens low

No turning back from galactic morgue
Chosen few find your reward
In solitude, perpetual silence
Cosmic womb, eternal solace

Colossal grave of shadows, extinction of mankind
Eternal morgue or sorrows, no beauty left behind

Void of shadows, man's colossal grave
Ball of ash to zero fades
Nothing left to mourn, all has died, ever born
Barren voyage static drone
Stark oblivion reigns so cold
Dropped out of existence, we've found our home

In heaven's black galactic morgue
Chosen few have found our reward
In solitude, perpetual silence
Cosmic womb, eternal solace
