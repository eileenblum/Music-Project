Living dead of London town
Flesh vessels underground
Mourning suits, burial gowns
9-5's doleful sound
Pallid faces office bound
Mortuary all year round

Corpse Cycle is life's circle
Life's circle is corpse cycle

Life is passing away
Society eats your mind away

Walking corpses, vacant slaves
Banking rottenness, decay
Saving cash for early graves
Utopia is coffin shaped
Wealth hungry drugged rats chase
Empty dreams of a better place

Corpse Cycle is life's circle
Life's circle is corpse cycle

Life is passing away
Society eats your mind away

Truths fading farther day by day, to material enslave
Die with the world as you awake, in the rat race you rotate

Degenerations zombified
Oblivious in the tombstone line
Corpses fucking their way through time

Corpse Cycle is life's circle
Life's circle is corpse cycle

Life is passing away
Society eats your mind away
Life has passed you away, flesh turned to grey
Society ate your mind away
