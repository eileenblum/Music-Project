[Pt.1: Thorns Of Creation]

New light has formed, from the darkness torn
Of dust and sand, mankind is born
Our garden evergreen, it's flowers, so serene
We sing along with birds naked, free
Our curiosity led us to a tree
We ate from it the fruits of poisoned destiny

[Pt.2: Trouble In The Garden]

Horns of goat, tongue of serpent
Head of dog, body of man
He has chosen to pervert God's land
In his heaven
The Garden Of Unearthly Delights

Flowers of blood grow in love's garden
Upon the black grass of betrothal
We have chosen to pervert God's land
This our heaven
The Garden Of Unearthly Delights

[Pt.3 Into The Valley Of Violent Orchids]

[(I) Cadaverous Butterfly]
Stillborn beauty greets the air
Cadaverous Butterfly draws near
Skullish face, scarlet wings
Eerie grace of death she brings
Haggard marble crosses bare
Entrance to her pesty lair
Skullish face, Vampire wings
Demon's ace fluttering
Poisoned perfume leads you there
Carnivorous insect has you snared
Fallen prey, mesmerised
Skullish face eats your eyes

[(II) Blind Mans Gaze]
In steaming woodlands you awake,
Eyes dripping blood
Rats digging a grave at your feet as
Storm clouds gather above
In earths garden, nature sings mans requiem
Damp, numb, lost on the cold ground
Whilst spiders explore your flesh
Raise your head from mossy stone and
slimy dew on which you rest
In death's sanction - all life's beauty is its end

[Pt.4 Flight Of The Reaper]

[(I) Court Of The Cosmic Judge]
Witching moon burning - frozen sun ashamed to rise
Earth's vampires thirsting - for a final taste of life
Flight of the reaper, coming back to greet man's end
Cosmic Judge awakens, from his council we're expelled
White dove on fire - flies into Azrael's sky
Black-winged messiah - accepts man's sacrifice
Flight of the reaper - he arrives at his promised land
Our funeral curator - cups the earth with skeletal hands

[(II) Tunnel Of Death]

[Pt.5 Alarm Bells In Paradise]

[(I) Mourning Of A Paused Dawn]
Dawn creeps on, as night withdraws
Orchid sun - rises paused

[(II) Black Bulbophyllum Sunrise]
Buldophyllum, Barbigerum
Purpureoachis, Dyanum
Dendrochilum, Cobbianum
Orchis - Mascula

[Pt.6 Exit The Valley Of Violent Orchids]

[(I) Through The Concrete Meadows Of Life]
You pass the valley of death
Rejoin the ghoulish droll procession
You thought you had left
Orikifirus sends down hearses
From the kingdom of dead our sun
Whores to oblivion now are taken
To your promised land

[(II) Chains of Morality]
Burning in the flames of pious self-shame
A pure, divine existence can't be reborn again
For your virtue there is no reward
Grand illusions of a heaven flawed

Break the skeletal chain - to be reborn again
No lies, no shame, an existence profane
Celebrating our freedom
In this prison of God's kingdom

[Pt.7 {ie Pt.c (c)} Back To The Garden]

Fireless sun, Morgue like planet
Deceased minds now control it
We have chosen to accept God's land
This is our heaven
The Garden Of Unearthly Delights

[Pt.8 Pool Of Sleeping Minds]

[Pt.9 Endtyme]

Soldiers now walk through the streets so cold
Concrete walls, dark buildings fall
Our garden has turned grey, its beauty gone away
Earth became a grave for mature's way
Seeds of decay have grown into today
Endtyme has come, all light fades away
