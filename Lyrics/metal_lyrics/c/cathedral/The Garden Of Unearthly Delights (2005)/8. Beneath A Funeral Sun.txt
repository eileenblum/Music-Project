Ghost of war smiling - damnation is nigh
Humanly abandoned - atrocity is rife
Moral desolation - future in decline
Final devastation - We shall pay the price

Funeral sun devoid of fire
Hangs above our burning pyre

Earth is falling - mother please
Save our sinners - father please

Plastic churches melting - fanatics get high
On flames of Armageddon - God didn't lie

Fatal acts towards man's extinction
Form the scythe in his reflection

Earth is falling - mother please
Save our sinners - father please

Haunting silence desolate gloom
Spectral vision of planets doomed

Star shaped crucifixes, cosmic tomb
Tranquil void awaits us soon

Black drapes overhanging - a vulture's paradise
World leaders celebrating - wargasmic genocide
Undertakers laughing - at cost of sacrifice
Ghost of man is fading no signs of afterlife

Funeral sun devoid of fire
Hangs above our burning pyre

Earth has fallen, no more pleas
Mankind's burning - spectre flees
