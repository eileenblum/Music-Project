Under the war-torn sodden skies
Bleeding axes anguished lies
Fight upon an earth that died
Raped by corporate scythe
Streets are red, Sun turned to grey
Nature's beauty has decayed
Swans lay dead on empty lakes
Love oh man - Forsakes

Fear his wrath as mans blood flows
Innocence now no-one knows
Rites of virtue we've disposed
Heaven's doors solemnly closed
Cities crumbled to the ground
Deformed crosses mark the land
Carnage lingers all around
No refuge for the damned

[Chorus:]
Eyes of death, look upon this earth
Destroyed by mankind's curse
Retribution, mutilation, desecrate, avenge

Oppressive tyrants to him fall
One by one he reaps their soul
Tearing death from their control
Elated by the rising toll
Slaying masters and their laws
Who destroyed our world with force
Oro gives unto the poor swords
To join him in this war

[Chorus]

Battlefield of charnel air
Land, sea, earth now laid bare
Morgue of solitude we share
Shown no mercy for our prayers
Laying down his bloody sword
Oro leaves us our reward
Silent vacuum, endless floor
- Gone forever more

[Chorus]
