The evil priest is calling me again
I stare into these walls and he comes through 
Clergy of the damned 
Surrounds me, pointing hands 
On my knees, i fall to their command 

"You wanna burn in hell?
With us you'll dwell 
Didn't see the signs
That led you here...." 

Green icy fingers 
Sliding down your face 
Cross of remembrance 
Torn off by the dead

A crimson ghost is walking down the hall 
Animating armour with his call 
Steel knights with fangs 
Awake with hungry plans 
My empty corpse shall grace the castle lounge 

You're gonna burn in hell 
With us you'll dwell 
Didn't see the signs 
That led you here 

Nightmare castle 
Built within your mind
Psychotronic laughter 
Echoes through the walls 

Nightmare castle
Welcomes you inside 
Phantasm paranoia 
Your beliefs defiled 

The cryptic nun appears and i am blessed 
Her velvet eyes are blacker than my death 
Skeletal majesty Of decomposed beauty 
An invitation too severe to refuse
