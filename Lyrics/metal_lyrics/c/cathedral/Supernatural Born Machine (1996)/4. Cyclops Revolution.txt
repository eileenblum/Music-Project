Beware the one-eyed titan 
He's coming to take you away 
He lost his mind within your soul 
Yeah he's given his power to you
Deadly laser from the monster 
Turning politicians into stone

Cyclops revolution 
Earth children arise 
Transformation for final flight 
Justice in our hands

Clouds gather on damnation 
Evil ones pay the price 
Into the heart of vampire empire
Strike crystal lightning bolts 
Growing sun has fallen 
We no longer need to see 

Cyclops revolution
Earth children arise 
Transformation for final flight 
Justice in our hands 

"I am cyclops, I've got my eye on you 
I'm gonna eat you whole - just look me in the eye"

"I am cyclops - beware doomed nation 
I stare at you - prepare to die!!" 

Cyclops revolution 
Earth children arise 
Transformation for final flight 
Justice in our hands

Beware the one-eyed titan 
You've let him to take you away
Morality is eaten whole 
As the cannibal takes control 
Deadly laser from the master 
Thunders our triumphant roar
