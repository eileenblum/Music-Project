Stained glass horizon 
Trapped in tombs of day 
No energy to run - nowhere to escape 
Fortune left behind you 
Blank dice is your gain 
Opium moon is rising 
The summer it never came

Your spirit reigns 
In the church of hell's domain 
Love's stained glass world 
You can't see through

Black dove is a flying 
From the reaper's hand 
You'd chase the white if you weren't blind 
A banquet for the living 
Skeleton at their feast 
Sins a bad man's lover 
Whose soul's lost in a pentagram 

Your heart's in chains
Vulture of your own remains 
Love's stained glass world 
You can't see through 

If Jesus walked beside you 
You'd take lucifer's hand
Evil feels good when it's never found 
Hiding from the sunshine
Lost man in the shade 
Fight for the force that guides you
Pull yourself from netherland 

Your heart's in chains 
Vulture of your own remains 
Love's stained glass world 
You can't see through
