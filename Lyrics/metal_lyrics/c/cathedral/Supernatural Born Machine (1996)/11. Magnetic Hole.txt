In this magnetic hole, descension the only quest 
Our lips are green within the burial of life itself 
Oh glorious misery caress this emptiness 
Half truths as a whole in this vacuum a negative gift S

Souls scattered in ecstasy 
Isolation intrinsically 
No medication or shrink can cure 
This nothingness we adore 

Skull of humanity within the charcoaled house of wealth 
In divine emptiness we are the butchers of lost self 
Hammer nails into my flesh for the punishment of luxury 
Bleed me dry oh lord in return I'll kiss your feet 

Eyes hollow i cannot see 
Holy visions just heresy 
No god or shrink can cure 
This nothingness we adore 

Into this hole we sink. 
Devoid of self esteem 
Clawing at the purest darkness 
Too awake to sleep.
