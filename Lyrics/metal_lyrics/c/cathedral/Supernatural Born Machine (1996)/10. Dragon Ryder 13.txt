Flames are high - lightning fueling my veins 
Dragon appears, i saddle up again 
Purple rain - anguished odyssey 
Cosmic babylon, destiny - yeah 

Hold my fire tonight - it's killing me 
Burn dragonryder high - into the next world
Thirteen hours with thirteen minds 
Bells toll eternally - in this prison 

Spectral sky phantom galaxy 
King of fire - chasing after me 
Liquid planets meet into my eyes 
Vision is gone chaos ignites

Hold my fire tonight - it's killing me 
Burn dragonryder high - into the next world
Thirteen hours with thirteen minds 
Bells toll eternally - bleeding my vision 

Radiation, nuclear heaven
The sun turns inside out 
Warheads flying from the burning moon 
Invisible in magnitude 

Black corona supernova 
Orion dwarfed from sight 
Cosmic halo of the void ignites
We descent into a realm of ice 

See if you can take it higher 
Low as high as low can go 

Freeze my fire tonight 
Glass dragonryder die - unveil the next world 
Thirteen planets in thirteen dreams 
Transport by death machine - beast of wisdom 

Crystal world in coma fantasy
Pale horse brings a burning key 
Wings of hell to black rainbows die 
Awake again - only half alive
