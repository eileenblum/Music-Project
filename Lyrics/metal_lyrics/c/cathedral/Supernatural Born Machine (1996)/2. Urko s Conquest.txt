Urko rides his troops into the flames 
Sirens of doom - the earth it shakes 
Wars and plagues have fueled beast of rage 
Mutated humans pay the price 

Space - ship year warped 
Crash lands ahead of time 
Apes and gorillas
Now rule your earth that died 

Sacrifice - the astronauts must die 
Gorilla guns aim at your face 
Surgical apes have taken out your voice 
Witness your kingdom witness hell

Space - ship year warped 
Crash lands ahead of time 
Apes and gorillas 
Now rule your earth that died

Ape shall not kill ape 
Slay the wrath of man 
Rape human minds 
They shall become our slaves 

Dr Zaius is praying 
Human knowledge can never be found

Scientific destruction 
History buried underground 

Ape shall not kill ape 
Mans twisted plan 
Space, the universe
Has crumbled in his hands 

Taylor escapes this hell to meet his fate
Upon the shapes 
On your knees before the rotted face 
Of liberty dead in the sand 

Space - ship year warped 
Crash lands ahead of time 
Your world your nightmare 
Doors slam on mankind
