Evilution - Minds on the production line 
Imagination drenched - within conformist slime 
Plastic education - Microwavable brains 
Cooking on the stage of heaven's pantomime

Warmongers getting high 
On genocide cocaine 
Grossmetic beauty 
Silicone truth can't hide 
Radio-active ocean 
Celluloid map of skies 
The universal cyclist no longer rides 

It's a rat race - machine breeding 
No hesitation in joining

Dance into the circle 
Conveyer belt of the world
Birth machine 2000 
Mechanics fix you today

The rats are hungry 
Eating at the sands of time 
Hourglass explodes 
In front of marble eyes
Eternal countdown 
Circular in sound returnity has died - 
Infinity arrives 

.......birth machine 2000........ 

As centuries pass - back into the circular void -
regeneration masked, behind a dying question????! 

Grim reaper of life - save me from their machine 
Celebrating strife - programmed nation r-i-p....
