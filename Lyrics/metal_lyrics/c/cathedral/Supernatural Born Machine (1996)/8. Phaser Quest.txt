Starlight laser points at you 
Sing to the ghost of summers blue 
Lay back, transcend into the moon
Mother of wisdoms' holy tomb

Phaze your sight - let it take you away 
Into the ocean in your mind 
Back in time take it - phaser quest
Endless visions - million miles high

Robot systems in control 
Dissect your soul of golden rules
Nature groovin by your side 
She gave you wings now learn to fly 

(sin-termission, ilusive broadcast)

Sun shines eternally in you 
The darkest day is silver too 
Straight line into the galaxy 
Spirals &amp; circles - harmony
