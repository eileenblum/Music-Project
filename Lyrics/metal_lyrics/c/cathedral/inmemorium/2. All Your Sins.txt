[Pentagram cover]

The time has come you must repent
For all your sins have spent
The rule to broken now is here
The spark that loads your soul with fear yeah

Your life in chaos no control
The hand beneath it voids your goals
The kinding fire is now prepared
To Meet the one youdared, oh yeah

You can never win
Pay for all your sins
You can never win
Pay for all your sins like this

You're gonna burn now!

You can never win
Pay for all your sins
