I got those midnight circles
And I pray deceived
Ooh how I despise you (memories)

Tongue tasting moonlight
A tribute to my pain
We could last for never (another game?)

Here in autumn twilight
Morphia cursed delight

I got those midnight circles
I drawn the hanged man
Movin towards Winter (yes I am)

Eyes seek inner spaces
Guardians of spheres
A touch of dementia's (fears)

Here in autumn twilight
Morphia cursed delight

And the sun shall never rise again
No more visions to be gained
Stricken mother of failings
Led into a shallow grave

Here I am now
So far away - hey
Internal reflections
Another maze

Here I stay now
Caught between
Lives that you form
And the lives I've been
