You gave to me
Affection I couldn't see
It felt like a rope
Tightening on me

Frozen rapture
Your warmth I couldn't trace
Echoed laughter
Bring sadness to my face
Hereinafter
Plagued by my own embrace

In my frailty
Your splendour did penetrate
Onto the cold
Floors of responsiveness

Frozen rapture
Your warmth I couldn't trace
Echoed laughter
Bring sadness to my face
Plagued by my own embrace

Buried within walls
Of ex-communication
Torch light never shines
Upon my isolation
