Crystal towers
I've yearned to explore
Shatter as I enter their doors,
Splinters sink into tender parts of me
Devouring my inmost quality

Floating through a whimsical breeze
To the pitfalls of discoveries

Assassin of visual fallacy
Dispel aspiration, uncover travesty,
Fading convictions losing clarity
Descending to depths of insobriety

Golden blood flooding from me
Into eternal cynical streams

Dismayed by the curse of analogy
In theatrical and reality

Charcoaled spirit the stranger in me
Dissolved in timeless obstinacy

Spectacle of severity
Chasing myself away from me
Blemished wings of vibrancy
Elevate this bane from me.
