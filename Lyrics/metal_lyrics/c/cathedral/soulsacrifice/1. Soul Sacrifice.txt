Tortured self-worth,
Abstracts of wrath,
Released from attachment
A Human reaction

Muted, unable to realize
Images of your designs
Soul sacrifice a blessing to me
Carve me from your memory ooh!
Deep impressions my depths,
Worthless, As each breath,
Worlds within half truths,
My fears of losing you

I'll pour scorn from the lowest place,
Colour fades from your face,
Annihilation-acceptance,
Paradox of self existence

Soul sacrifice
Ooh the pain we've been through

Soul sacrifice
I've sacrificed my soul for you
