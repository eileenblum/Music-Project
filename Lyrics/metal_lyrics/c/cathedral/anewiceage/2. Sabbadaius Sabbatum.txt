Ancient leaves are falling - summer fades again
Lord of the oak is dying - lord of holly ushered in
From nature's pagan forest - our rite sees the sun turn dim
Goddes of earth; our mother - let winter begin.

Summer crawls back into deaths womb
Dark season shall befall us soon.

High priestess of the coven - drawing down black moon
Become mortal incarnation - chant your charge of doom.

Come our day of Sabbath come, sacrifice our burning sun
Sabbadius Sabbattum unholy frosts we shall welcome.

God's world of creation - has hored heavens elite
To hells erotic grotto - Lucifer lured man in
War has taking over - world possessed by sin
Rotting corpse of beauty - vanity is eating.

Gluttony feasting on eart's tomb
Pigs of death shall suffer soon.

A Green land they have taken - left us in this din
Harbingers of destruction - our curse on you begins.

Come our day of Sabbath come, Satan's children gather come
Sabbadaius sabbattum - infernal winter murder sun.

On this day of Sabbath come - endtyme master to us come
Sabbadaius Sabbattum cast your final shadow come.

Final invocation as wings of death fly in
Bell of eternal warning silenced by his grim
Enchanted desolation seasons trapped within
Frozen out of existence trembling land of sin.

From portals of skies cosmic skull
Poisoned darkness emits and falls.

Skeletal Christ awakens  - robed in blackest night
Castle of death is open - he makes his way inside.

Now this day our Sabbath's come unholy mother work is done
Sabbadaius Sabbattum infernal winter killed gods son.
