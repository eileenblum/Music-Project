Society is murder, your mid it is enslaved
Born as individuals, in the system we are raped
I am a non believer in Goverment, Church or State
So then persecute me Lord, send me to the stake.

Slaves, slaves - born in earth's grave
Slaves, slaves - society's slaves
Slaves, slaves - they've nullified your brain
Take it back again.

Flames are burning high there is no God in the sky
Dark forces of sorcery held back by religious lies
In natures retribution we watch our planet die
They've taken your integrity, what's left of you to buy?

Slaves, slaves - born in earth's grave
Slaves, slaves - society's slaves
Slaves, slaves - they've nullified your brain
Take it back again.

Join the production line of murdered minds
Death church, factory drugged and blind.

Take me to the stars, reality is not for me
Desolations of Mars... Oh inner eye, yeah set me free.

Open mind surgery, from the systems scalpel blade
Work until your back breaks, uphold their Vampire state.

Slaves, slaves - born in earth's grave
Slaves, slaves - society's slaves
Slaves, slaves - they've nullified your brain
Take it back again.
