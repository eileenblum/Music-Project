White rose perfume go with thee on thy way unto the thy shaded tomb low music doth fall lightly as
autumn leaves about they solemn pall. Faint incense rises. O'you, you fell away from me my love,
like all earthly things vanish into death's cold mysteries. Serpents marked with azure rings cathedrals
where rich shadows fall, things strange curios solemn saviour. You promised me laughter in autumn
days, now I can't awake from this lurid haze, I can't awake to laugh with you, I'm so weary. Claws
upon my flesh and statues of lost souls dominate this house. Angels have no pity, their wings have
turned to stone. Come travel naked lovers beyond all dimensions of heaven and lie enchanted
forever in the lucid garden of dreams. In all animate sources and creation of belief we travel seas of
illusions that begin at our dreams. Ethereal architects masters of all fate.
