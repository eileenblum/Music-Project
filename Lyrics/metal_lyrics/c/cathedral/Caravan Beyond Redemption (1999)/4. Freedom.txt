Listen while I tell ya - Each and Everyone
About the state our planet's in and what should be done
Wheels of Freedom turning backwards on themselves
Liberty is burning - in this Hell, this Cosmic Cell

Freedom for the people - Humanity and all Mankind
Liberate your Soul and Mind - It's waiting for you all to find

But getting it together is what I'm talking about
Ain't got time to argue - Just time to turn it out
Look into the future - Just tell me what you see
If we don't love each other - There'll be no harmony

Freedom for the people - Humanity and all Mankind
Liberate your Soul and Mind - It's waiting for you all to find

Free wheel keep turning - Open up your mind
Star-spangled stairway - That you're waiting to climb
It's just a bummer - they're fascist rules
Police and Politicians - Pushing on you

Father of Creation - Master of this Tomb
Universal Messiah - Motherfucking King of Doom
We don't ask forgiveness - For our sins against you Lord
We want retribution - For the Twisted ways you've taught
