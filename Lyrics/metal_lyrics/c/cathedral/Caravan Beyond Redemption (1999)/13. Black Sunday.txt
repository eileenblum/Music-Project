[Japanese Bonus Track]Witching eyes are burning, my soul is at the stake
Black Widow Woman, your web of intrigue I take
You never gave me warning, just put me under your spell
The mystic voice of beauty, became a tolling bell

You elevate me, you desecrate me too
Oh magic lady - Burn me up

Above the gargoyles frowning, staring down at me
Giving out empty feelings, oh so easily
A bullet train to heaven, drops me off in hell
Through your maze I'm crawling, you never looked so well

Don't leave me dying, come take this pain from me
Queen of illusion - Don't walk away

Black cats this morning, led me to the grave
Above a tomb she's standing, calling out my name
I watch the sun god dying, feel his darkness fall
On this bleakest Sunday, I'm lost in your cruel world

The hangman spares me, I'll die another day
In your illusion - On your grave

You elevate me, you desecrate me too
Black Magic Lady - I'm gone.
