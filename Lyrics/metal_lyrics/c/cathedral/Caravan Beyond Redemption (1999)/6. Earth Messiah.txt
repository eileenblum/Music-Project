Insane Asylum Planet Earth
The Universe has become a hearse
I drove your destiny to your maker
I was your futureworld creator

My wicked eye - watched planet burn
I am your master - I am the Earth Messiah

Television parasites
Tune into Brainstation Satellite
I'm sucking cash from your minds - so empty
Oh, how your weakness pleases me

Brainwashed children - From you I feed
I am your master - I am the Earth Messiah

My Black Cloak spreads across your world
The lights go out to a mushroom cloud
Atomic crypt becomes your Heaven
For all of this time you have prayed for me

My work is done - Now I've set you free
I am your master - I am The Earth Messiah
