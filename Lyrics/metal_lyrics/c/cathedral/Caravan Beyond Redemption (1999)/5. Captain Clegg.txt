A funeral moves. Under the cloak of night
Captain Clegg and his smuggling pirates ride
With contraband of the finest Brandy and Wine
Hidden inside a macabre coffin disguise

A tombstone reads "Captain Clegg, R.I.P."
Yet still he sails across the Phantom Seas
Such a holy man for all of you to see
The Village Vicar: - His secret Identity

Frightened people, fear the evil
in their leader - Captain Clegg

The Kings Revenue Men - learn of Clegg's illicit deeds
From a local trader - Now a corpse who no longer speaks
If you cross his path - He'll slice off both your ears
Have your tongue cut out, and reduce your life to tears

Perish all of you - Who betray me
Your ghostly leader - Captain Clegg

A few words from Collier....

He wore the mask of the skeletal creature of night
His oath was terror and "Blood!" his battle cry
He was a wanted man, who escaped the Hangman's noose
The Parish leader - His pirate clergy in the loose

He sailed the Phantom Seas, catered for community needs
The Village Master - Captain Clegg

He was a ghost rider - Phantom night creature
Evil leader: - Captain Clegg. R.I.P.
