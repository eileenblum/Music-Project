Crucified millions go to mass every day
To earn from God their moral wages
Their world is dying - for forgiveness they pray
Yet meanwhile the battle rages

Can't you see what you're doing?
Can't you see what I'm trying to say?
Fantasizing virtue, whilst inequity breeds. Yeah
Mechanical slaves to the Doomsday Machine

But you won't listen - You watch the planet turn
From Cathedral spires. The Unnatural World

Ultra bright red planet with inflammable sea
Vivid world of spectral colors
Genetic reproductions of a plastic forest
A nation of invisible figures

Well can't you see that we're trapped here?
Can't you see that you cannot escape?
This Earth is a ball that we're all chained to
Tortured humans in a scientist's zoo

But you won't listen - You watch the planet burn
From Cathedral spires. The Unnatural World

Atomic lords living in their Ivory Palace
The animals are locked in their cages
Dictator of Destruction has the world on its knees
In comfort while his battle rages

Can't you see what they're doing?
Can't you see what I'm trying to say?
Our planet is resting on a skeletal hand
As nature dies in this grief-stricken land
