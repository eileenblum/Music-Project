Since love has come to me 
Since then you've walked away 
Life is a mystery
The roses on my coffin 
Are the dreams you gave to me 
Love is blind 
And all the flowers died for you 
This land so black, so fair for you 

Here in this wonderland 
Purple the ecstasy 
Mist enticing, penetrating 
Lust I inhale 

Cold is the night today 
Darker than months of May 
Love is blind 
Your arms where a hearse for me 
Desire driving me 
Into this grave
And all the bells shall ring for you 
Transparent love we shall see through 

Sleep in this wonderland 
Of purple ecstasy 
Mist enticing, penetrating 
Lust I inhale

Fear not the wind 
It's telling a tale 
Into the whitest night 
We slip away... 

...Not dead enough to be alive
