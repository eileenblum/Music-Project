I said your messin' up my head
Inside your funky luv machine 
Those mutha's 
Are fleeing the nest
To join our Brother/sister soul machine
With hesitation I view the world 
But I know a good thing Is going down 
Media they talk of masturbation 
Skip their krap and get on down 

Woooaaahah do it yeah 
Brothers, sisters come to me 
Woooaaaheh all right now
Pinnacles of ecstasy 

God squad they wish
That we were dead 
'Cos we're always 
Tripping out of our head
This funky doom scene is insane
Police they have a different brain
Love is the sin we call salvation 
Heaven stationed in a lovers smile
Our law is the law of meditation 
Flip yo' head into the sky (Superfly)

Woooaaahah yeah 
Brother sisters can't you see 
Woooaaaheh yeah hit me
We're loaded - Get high! 

Ad lib impro shake out smoke on! 

Curse of the Blues Dog [Reprise]
