Liquid God takes my soul away
Flying high through a bloodshot sky 
I fall back down to my water grave 
Walking Dead when you leave me dry 
Sea serpents surround me 
Aqua demons - drowning me 
Save my soul from this grave
Liquid God-you have made
Inside your church I worship everyday
unholy water quenches the thirst 
There is no future I've drank it all away 
Before your altar I accept the curse 
Sea serpents surround me 
Aqua Demons - drowning me
I swim your seas, limbless, in vain
As senses sink into your domain 
Taste his golden blood again 
Raise the chalice to the Sea Gods name 
As life sips by faith in you numbs the pain 
You control this body and mind
Well I've drowned my soul in your poisoned reign
Liquid master - I'm forever your slave
Sea serpents surround me 
Aqua Demons - drowning me
Save My Soul
