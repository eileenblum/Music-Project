Blazing ball of fire - final bang ignites
Fleets of hungry angels feast on earth like flies
Burning soul of karma - furnace of mankind
Human skull and crossbones - treasures left behind
Holy father - reaps earth's seed
Sacred mother spreads his disease
Religious inferno - burial of mind
Mental crucifixion, love destroyed by lies
Decomposing morals - mummified in time
Lord of retribution, judge us for our crimes
Holy father - reaps earth's seed
Sacred mother spreads his disease
Master of ceremonies - awakens from eternal nyte
For our sins we pay the price - society it's time to die.
Melancholy emperor - king of our demise
Arises from deep shadows - bearing endtyme scythe
Skull of ancient wisdom, cloaked in funeral sky
Spreads his wings wide open, engulfs the cosmos wide
Holy father - reaps earth's seed
Sacred mother spreads his disease
Holy father - reaps earth's seed
Sacred mother spreads his disease
