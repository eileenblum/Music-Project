Our 13th Century ceremony - a vile &amp; wicked rite 
A virgin child we took that night, her blood for eternal life
Local peasants tortured us - another daughter sacrificed 
With flaming torches in our eyes - our bodies they burned alive 
500 years of darkness - entombed devoid of sight 
The crowds came out to mock us on this carnival night 
Clowns &amp; dolls of Templars ridicule our sacred cult
The Blind Dead have arisen - so now your blood be spilt
Rise! Rise! Blind Dead Arise! Rise! 
As fireworks light up your sky - your jolly music plays 
Beside our monastery ruins, we're rising from the grave
Decomposed monk warriors with swords enter your town 
Riding spectral horses - in Crimson seas you drown 
Rise! Rise! Templars Arise! Rise!
