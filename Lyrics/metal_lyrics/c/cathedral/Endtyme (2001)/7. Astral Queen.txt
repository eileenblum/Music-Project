She walks under the moon, into the valley of fire
Astral Queen is dynamite 
From this land of madness - she possesses the key 
A pyramid shape controls the ocean waves,
She sails the seas of celestial grace 
Where the blind man wanders, her darkness carries the light 
Soul and mind lost in her deep space,
Her magic power has a hold - oh so strange 
Blue Queen of cosmic beauty sanctions all the pain, 
Mans loveless world has frozen - trapped in her domain
