World is falling before our eyes
We've sold our souls for - empty lies
Indoctrinations circle writhes In persecuted brainwashed minds 
Master of this empty void controls your thoughts all - love destroyed 
Hell is worth it for heavens prize 
To war &amp; pain desensitized 
Whores to oblivion - rising faster
Death to Utopian - War is Master
Propaganda has bought your mind 
An afterlife you fantasize, 
The social ladder that you have climbed
Reality left long behind
Carry me away with the setting sun 
my dream of death has - just begun 
Pain of mind destruction calls 
This seething cage I must break from 
Whores to oblivion - rising faster 
Death to utopian - war is master 
Whores to oblivion breeding faster 
Death to Utopian -war is master 
Apocalypse is coming today........ 
Or was it supposed to be yesterday??? 
The world is falling into its grave 
Oh lord have mercy, can we be saved? 
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
Whores to oblivion - rising faster 
Death to utopian - war is master 
Whores to oblivion breeding faster 
Death to Utopian -war is master 
Whores to oblivion - rising faster 
Death to utopian - war is master 
Whores to oblivion breeding faster 
Death to Utopian -war is master 
Whores to oblivion.....................................
