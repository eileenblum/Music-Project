Alchemist of sorrow
I am Midas in reverse, my gold has turned to lead 
all lovers I've forsaken are dancing with the dead 
lust and desire burning in hellfire 
great god below me, my future you have read 
Euphoria found it's grave with the love you gave 
all magic died with my dreams of an Autumn bride 
now she's gone away, days are dark eternal 
golden shores become grey 'cos I'm always yours 
Alchemist of sorrow
Robed in black behind my back, deaths conscience in control 
slimy green fingers molest deep into my soul 
lost in satire possessed by nothing higher
from the tallest mountain, I gaze into depths so low 
Euphoria found it's grave with the love we made 
all magic died with my dreams of an autumn bride 
now she's gone away, days are dark eternal 
golden shores become grey 'cos I'm always yours 
Alchemist of sorrow
Back to the womb, my future doomed inside this tomb of pain 
before my eyes had opened, your world already insane 
magician of sadness, god of unholy madness 
left the doors wide open, to live this torture again 
Wanton grief, takes the place of eternal peace 
dark and cold, memories I forever hold 
summer moments saved under violet oceans
beneath life's floor, rest my dreams forever more
