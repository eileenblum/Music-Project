Lifeblood flows down the rivers of sorrow
Love a distant dream we've left behind
Utopic fortunes we see in tomorrow
Blind illusions as all hope fades and dies
Sleeping forest under shimmering moonlight
Enchantment reigns in your mystical haze
Ghosts of life awake unto twilight
As the living rest in cold empty graves
All that's weary beneath the sun
Fades to darkness now his death has come
Frozen ice cold in naked beauty
Oh warmth of nocturn come unto me
Shadows are the sails of night
That soon shall come to hide the light
In sorcery and divine flight
We flock to you to gain our might
I watch the sun fall for the last time
No more visions of it's pain to behold
All light has gone forever from my sight
On this heart and vision falleth the night
All that's weary beneath the sun
Fades to darkness now his death has come
Frozen ice cold in naked beauty
Oh warmth of nocturn come unto me
All that's weary beneath the sun
Fades to darkness now his death has come
Frozen ice cold in naked beauty
Oh warmth of nocturn come unto me
