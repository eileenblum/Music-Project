I exist in this coffin of life
Murdered trust and misfortune, has evolved into strife
Through these eyes I see nothing but death
I have tried forgiving and now I've nothing left

This body and blood, the cemetery of my soul
This body thy tomb encases me
Thy flesh a pall covering a long lost heart
This body thy tomb enslaves me

Seeds of decay were planted so long ago
In the garden of life where a future failed to grow
Golden crown and sceptre - I adorn
Amongst fellow corpses - in this loveless morgue

This body and blood, the cemetery of my soul
This body thy tomb encases me
Thy flesh a pall bearing covering a long lost heart
This body thy tomb enslaves me
