Face of death now fills the sky
It became the earth we left to die
Black curtains close in on life
Morgue of silence all tears run dry

War, famine, drought, disease

Pall Bearer

Universe falls to its knees
Mankind didn't hear the pleas
Carrying life upon his back
Into the void, no turning back

War, famine, drought, disease

Pall Bearer

Grave diggers of the world unite
To celebrate our earth's demise
Kings of death, cosmic parasites
On blackened wings take one final flight

Drought, famine, war and disease
Mother nature no longer grieves
Staggering mass of man bereaved
True consequence of wealth and greed

Pall Bearer
