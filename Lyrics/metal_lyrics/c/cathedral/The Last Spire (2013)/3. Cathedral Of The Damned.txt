Carry your cross, live to die - accepting shit, head in the sky
Christ your saviour, in this life of lies - blind existence beneath a scythe
Delusions of virtue guiding you - kaleidoscope of hatred you look through
Love is here but you can't see - they've taken it from you and me

In shadows, you are alone
No afterlife, this is your home

Living in the shadow of a damned cathedral

Underneath a funeral moon - soldiers of death march on earths tomb
Electric vulture flying high - above this land we left to die
Perishing from almighty sin - eternal frost is setting in
Freezing man down to the bone - repenting, cold and all alone

In shadows, you are alone
No afterlife, this is your home

Living in the shadow of a damned cathedral
