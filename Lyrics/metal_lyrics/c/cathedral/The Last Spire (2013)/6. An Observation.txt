I have seen through occult forces - another side of life
Hungry demons joined in darkness - to desecrate my soul

A funeral is all I see, a funeral is all I feel

I have viewed from acid towers - the other side of life
Bloody fields of iron flowers - in a world of plastic smiles

A funeral is all I feel, a funeral is all I've seen

Floating on a four leaf clover, everything's a dream
Reality becomes the joker, laughter turns to screams

Follow paths of institution blindly through this life
The butcher of your inner conscience stabs you with his knife
