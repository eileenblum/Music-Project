As twilight surrounds me, night becomes my home
Melancholic emotions possess this aching soul
A sea of stars above, oh how I year to roam
I've wandered around this wasteland - far too long

A tower of silence is waiting for me
Looming before an astral sea

Circle of time has stopped - everything's dying before me
Sun no longer shines - I'm alone in this cold world

I lurk in the shadows of society
Within this fucked up system, there's no place for me
Velvet chariot through this death I ride
Lampblack angel of sorrow my eternal guide

The tower of silence is waiting for me
Looming before an astral sea

Circle of time has stopped - everything's dying before me
Sun no longer shines - I'm forlorn in this dark world

I lurk within the shadows of society
Within your fucked up system, there is no place for me

A tower of silence is waiting for me
Looming before an astral sea

Circle of time has stopped
