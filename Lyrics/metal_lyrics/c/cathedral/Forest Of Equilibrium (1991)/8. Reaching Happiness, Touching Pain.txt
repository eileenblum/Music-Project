Dark oceans we cry, writhing in the misery, cast spit on the love that lay at our feet, the intrigue of
pain we crave it's mystery neglect to explore the depths to sanctity. We reach happiness, divine in
providence, our lamented desires. Lose scent of the essence, shunned is the prosperity, we feel the
anxiety, self inserting the knives in our heart. Luring to degrade with bribes of affection, can't abide
divinity over our imperfection. All love is broken, sombre in devotion, the hearse of selfishness has
drove it all away.
