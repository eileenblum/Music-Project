Together we have discovered the languid fatigue of love interrogated all our beauty we've turned
each other inside out. Drowning in Ebony Tears. The long face of cherrlessness the only bonding we
share enlightened by degredation the only pleasure is pain. Drowning in Ebony Tears. Embedded in
our resentment lay the keys to disengage but still we burn in persecution for the punishment of
possessiveness.
