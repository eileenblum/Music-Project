Guardians of darkness set my spirit free
From this land of madness,give me something to believe
Your system and religion control me like a disease
Strenght and determination
Almost let you bleed
They'll let you bleed

No god's,no masters,no authority
Only yourself
Divine disciples controll your destiny,
Believe in yourself

Baptism of fire into society
Crucified and brainwashed,told just what to believe
Drowned in holy water to cleanse in purity
Guilty for existing,your mind will never be free
You'll never be free

No god's,no masters,no authority
Only yourself
Divine disciples controll your destiny,
Believe in yourself

You're strong without god,everyone is a star
There is no authority,but yourself
No god's,no masters,there is no god but man
Man made gods and idols,you think can save man?
If you become suicidal,you're made to believe they can!
Sins for which i'm guilty,i am by my own hand
Forgiveness i'm not seeking,i'll live by my own command
Your own command

No god's,no masters,no authority
Only yourself
Divine disciples controll your destiny,
Believe in yourself
