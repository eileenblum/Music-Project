Born in the casket of society's decay
On your knees to be rewarded with strife
Grim opsesion in search of afterlife

Unification of the magical ones
Congregation in far off skies

Conformist slaves,trapped in earth's cage
Grave acceptance of plastic lies
In the church of your brains demise

Unification of the magical ones
Congregation in far off skies

Bone-made chariot,carry this lost soul
Past the stars beyond lampblack skies
To where the sorcerrers of life we'll find

Unification of the magical ones
Congregation in far off skies
