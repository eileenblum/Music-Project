Black robed avenger
Rides upon a white horse through my mind
In search of love he finds
A spectral planet lost in space and time
He dreams of paradise
Suspended animation greets his eyes
Across barren deserts,a universal wilderness he seeks
Palaces crumbled
Sceletons remain of fallen kings
Bleak storms and hurricanes
He braved ti discover loves atomic grave
He found salvation
Within a void of loneliness and pride
The land of selfish man
A frozen world in winter's hands
A weary traveller
Stares  into the heart of human kind
Souls of planet earth
Entombed inside a giant ball of ice
