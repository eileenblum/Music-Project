Living dead vampiress
Trying to taunt me back to the grave
My black and macabre past
Summoning  me forever a slave
Black sun arising
Howling moon it screams
As spider's web she's weaving again
Hallucinations sucking me in

Resisting the ghost
My former life host
Resisting the ghost
Echoed celebrations

Haunt loves hollow room
Motivation mortally trapped
In regrets obsessive tomb
A stake she's thrusting
Into my dying heart
Power igniting the past
Awakes me from this coffin at last

Resisting the ghost
Resisting the ghost
She was the one i love most
I've rejected the ghost
