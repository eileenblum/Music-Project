She plants a seed  in my head
Opium narcosis hypnotic dread
I feel her death growing in me
Like a cancer,yet i crave the disease
Mesmeried by her strange power
Beauty and death in union
She blossoms in the 13th hour
Skullflower

Hollow skull emotionless grin
Arcane tunnels sucking me in
Black vortex in her eyes
Reminds me of a love that died
Lady death evolves from a flower
Growing upon my own tomb
Into her groung i'm sinking lower
Skullflower
