Land of suffering beneath a rotting sky
Witches are burning,black flags fly
Smouldering pyre of evil empire
Infernal darkness,ghost of mankind
Enemies of god-skulls stacked high
Sinners,non-believers,liars must die
Crucifiction of satan's children
On the holy one's  day of retribution
Yeah,oh yeah,the end of the world draws near
Yeah,oh yeah,good and bad controlled by fear
They're clensing the world of sin
Ridding the world of evil
By sinister and evil means-black god of destruction is king
Halo of fire-burning funeral pyre
Behold the fiery earth appears broken
Locusts swarm out from the pit now open
Abadon awakens to eternal nothingness
Halo of fire crowning his darkness.
