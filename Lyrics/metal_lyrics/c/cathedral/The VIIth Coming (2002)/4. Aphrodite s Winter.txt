Frozen land mesmerised by her arcane mystery
Goddess of the underworld cold queen of lost beauty
Gazed upon earth's battleground
At mankind's misery
With her saddness came love's death
As violence slowly siezed

Her wheeping tears of darkness crytallised the earth
As warmth turned colder, her grief chilled away all mirth
Frosted armies paused in war now wearing beards of snow
Perishing forevermore, her bite numbs to the bone

Housed in icy caves, men of peace rest in these times of woe
Shaking in glass coffins, waiting for the sun to glow
She cast her spell on earth and all emotion died
Her languid heart dulled the skies with love's demise
She crystallised the earth with water from her eyes
A frozen sun now hangs above this land's demise.
