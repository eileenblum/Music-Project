[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]
Â 
You canât hurt me anymore
You wonât lie to me with your words
You canât break my heart again
Iâll forget your fucking face
Chain me to you
I was chained to hell
You canât beat me anymore
You canât play with my self-esteem
You canât steal my dreams again
All my friends are by my side
Wherever I go
You will not hurt me
I will live without you in misery
âCause I broke my promise to start again
I will live without you forever free
You will not take my dreams again
Â 
Time will take away my wounds
Hope is born to me again
Time will take my suffering
Time will make my dreams come true
I'll get my life
Away from you
Â 
FUCK!!!
Never again....NEVER!!!
Â 
I will live without you in misery
âCause I broke my promise to start again
I will live without you forever free
You will not take my dreams again
