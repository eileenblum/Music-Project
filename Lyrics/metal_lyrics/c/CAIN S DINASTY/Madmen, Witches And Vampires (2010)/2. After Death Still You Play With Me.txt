[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]
Â 
Digging a hole in the depth of my brain
Searching a place where Iâm not insane
Making a ditch on a quest for the bitch
To spit in her face and make her burn like a witch
Â 
Open my mind, open her grave
Welcome to hell, this is my past
Â 
I can't believe that after death still you play with me
I can't believe everything what I had to feel
He observes the world which caused him so much pain
A well of madness surrounded with loneliness
Â 
Then I had faith and then I believed and
Looking for a disguise to conceal my pain
Â 
Thereâs a void in my head, thereâs a sin in my soul
Thereâs a feeling inside me, thereâs a price to pay
Â 
Madness, desperation still grows in my brain
Now the hole is deep and bleeding memories
Burning the past and burning myself
They come for me, the beasts of pain are unleashed
Â 
Open my mind, open her grave
She excused my life, But broke all my hopes
Â 
I can't believe that after death still you play with me
I can't believe everything what I had to feel
He observes the world which caused him so much pain
A well of madness surrounded with loneliness
