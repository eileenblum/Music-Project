[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]
Â 
Sitting in a cold and lonely chair
Waiting for the change that makes me free
Â 
Searching for hope in the wind
Lost in a void of lonely pain
Â 
Thinking in the things that I once lost
Maybe you will return ohh ohh ohh
Â 
How hard is to start again
How hard is to smile today
How hard is to awake everyday
without you...
Â 
Walking alone through the time
Sailing under the sad light of the moon
Â 
Sometimes we live our golden dreams
But reality is not like fairy tale
Â 
Thinking in the things that I once lost
Maybe you will return ohh ohh ohh
Â 
How hard is to start again
How hard is to smile today
How hard is to awake everyday
without you...
Â
