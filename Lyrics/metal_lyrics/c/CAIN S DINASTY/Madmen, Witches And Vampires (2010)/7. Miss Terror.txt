[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo.]
Â 
Before the fire burns, all your blood will be for her
Â 
Open your eyes in a cold and rotting room
So weak like a flame under the rain of memories
The death is coming here with her embrace to meet you soon
She will take away your suffering and all your pain
Â 
Someone smiles before you
A lovely face, a body to commit sin
Â 
She is a witch
She brought me here
She is my bitch
She would make me sin [x2]
Â 
Sheâs exited showing her lustful skin, ready for you
Step by step she shows you more and more and more
Â 
No one can help you now
You are the lamb, your blood is now for her!!!
Â 
She is a witch
She brought me here
She is my bitch
She would make me sin [x2]
Â 
Her tongue burns your skin and your flesh
Your heart turns like a bomb in your chest
Â 
Your sorrow encourages her Lasciviousness
Â
