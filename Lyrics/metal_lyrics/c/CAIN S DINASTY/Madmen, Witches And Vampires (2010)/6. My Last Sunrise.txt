[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]
Â 
This is the story of a lonely soul
Lost in a world without a master to learn
Feared and hated hiding from the light oh oh oh oh
Heâs searching love and hope but is cursed like a ghost
Â 
I've been waiting far too much
for a sign or chance to change my life
Â 
Watching my last sunrise
His beauty seems to mesmerize
Watching my last sunrise
Maybe my last tears shed
*
Rising from the East bringing life to a new day (the last for me)
Feeling the heat of light with tears in my eyes
Â 
I keep all my life from yore
But I can't recall a twilight before
Â 
Watching my last sunrise
His beauty seems to mesmerize
Watching my last sunrise
Voices recalling from the past
Watching my last sunrise
My journey is about to culminate
Watching my last sunrise
Maybe my last tears shed
Â 
The morning wind strongly blows
while the sun burns my flesh and soul
