[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]
Â 
[Lord StrÃ¯goÃ¯:]
Suc eshar hen, Ã¡va mel i ruhta
Hul iya eane
Metya vanwa ar u nesian tenna man laita iya ak
Â 
I never thought that my destiny could be so sad
My pain is so strong and hopeless like my life
Iâ m triying to organize all my memories
Â 
Iâm on a quest for my memories
Iâm on a quest for my dreams
Â 
How longâs this lonely road?
How long this lonely night?
How long this lake of tears?
And while I spent the time
Like those waiting for death
Â 
Two months ago my trouble was born
Like a revelation in front of my unbelieving eyes
Some forces emerge in me someday I will return
Â 
Iâm on a quest for my myself
Iâm on a quest for my peace
Â 
I can't follow with my broken heart...
and my dead soul...
Â 
How longâs this lonely road?
How long this lonely night?
How long this lake of tears?
And while I spent the time
Like those waiting death
Â 
[Lord StrÃ¯goÃ¯:]
Metya vanwa ar u nesian tenna man laita iya ak
