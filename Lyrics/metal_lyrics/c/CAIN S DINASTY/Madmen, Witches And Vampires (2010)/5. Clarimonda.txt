[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]
Â 
The sun broke in the night
It had started to dawn
Watching her in her bed
Purified by the shadow of death
Â 
Clarimonda
Death makes her so beautiful
that she looks like an angel
And so we split forever
Â 
And then I saw her crossed hands
Her rest seems like a dream oh oh oh oh
And her body is a sin
Is the spring of desire for all men
Â 
Clarimonda
Death makes her so beautiful
that she looks like an angel
And so we split forever
Â 
After bearing the pain of burying her beauty
I saw her back to life turned into a vampire
And blinded by ambition of breaking her damnation
I returned to the graveyard to finish with her
Â 
I Scattered blessed water on her body
And all her beauty turned into ashes
She returned from nothing to break forever
The communication between our souls and bodies
Â 
Clarimonda
Death makes her so beautiful
that she looks like an angel
And so we split forever
