[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]
Â 
The blood of the temple tells a story.
Two men born of the same entrails.
NERGAL: Force and meanness.
VERGIL: Weakness and wisdom.
Â 
Crying for the wasted blood.
The weak man kills the strong one
Breaking the blood lines
Devil May Cry
Â 
NERGAL snatched VERGIL's art,
Stealing from him his unique force.
The jealousies that dye the soil with blood â¦
Blocked up with anger watching his stained hands
He will not palliate your weakness nevermore
Â 
Contemplating the last days of every human being...
Watching a night full of stars and a dead moon...
A rose without petals...
Â 
Crying for the wasted blood.
The weak man kills the strong one
Breaking the blood lines
Devil May Cry
Â 
Screaming under NERGALâs body,
he dragged an eternal ballast.
VERGILâs soul was condemned forever
After a hundred years he waits for a chance to change the past.
Â 
Crying for the wasted blood.
The weak man kills the strong one
Breaking the blood lines
Devil May Cry
Â 
One thousand years... alone...
He will walk across the earth...
With his painfull memories.
Â 
Trying to forgive himselfâ¦ day by day
