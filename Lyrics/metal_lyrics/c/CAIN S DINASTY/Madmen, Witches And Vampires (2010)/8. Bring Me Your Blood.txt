[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo.]
Â 
I was betrayed by the greed of my sons
They took away my last drop of blood
Â 
I felt as it death embraced me again
I was so weak that I could not feel the pain
Â 
When I find you Iâll fulfill my revenge
I gave you your life and you tried to kill mine
Â

Bring me your blood.
I need the ancient masters,
so bring me your blood.
Then Iâll be strong again,
so bring me your blood.
Â 
I looked throughout the world, as if looking for ghosts
I will show them how cold is revenge
I tried to chase but I feel like the pray
Hope is away from me, I feel so confused
Â 
There is a punishment for treason
For them itâs just a game without rules, without rules
Â

Bring me your blood.
I need the ancient masters,
so bring me your blood.
Then Iâll be strong again,
so bring me your blood.
Â 
There is a thorn in my heart
