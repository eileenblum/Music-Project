[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

A white novice is praying alone,
Captivated with the love of a young man.
A being tormented for revealing his truth.
She ignores that heÂ´s the fallen angel.
Â 
Iâm the one who has many names
But you can call me now as you want.
My kingdomâs fire and loneliness
Itâs the sentence of the damned ones
Â 
The sweet novice is God-fearing and
Lies on the floor without breath and life
She clutches a dagger with blood and gold
Her heart is searching for her infernal love
Â 
Trying to steal his belovedâs soul
He unleashed a war
Facing Heaven, Hell and Earth
Â 
With his flag he defends the passion
They are punished for love
Â 
Defeated he was sent down to hell
Waiting for the moment of revenge.
Agony and loneliness...
His sweet love still cries on heaven's doors
Â 
There are no more prays for god
Will you believe in love?
Â 
The sweet novice is God-fearing and
Lies on the floor without breath and life
She clutches a dagger with blood and gold
The one that crossed her own heart and hope
Her soul is searching for her infernal love
Â 
The white noviceâs condemned to forget
His dark angel still fights for her
Rain on earth are the tears for them
From now and on love become a sin
