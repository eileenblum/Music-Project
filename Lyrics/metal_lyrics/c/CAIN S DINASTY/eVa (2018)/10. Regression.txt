[Music and lyrics are by RubÃ©n Picazo]

I remember my childhood, my innocence.
Always laughing, discovering the world.
Maybe the happiest time of my life.
I remember my youth, changing everyday.
And so it begun, my journey through life...
What is the meaning of life?
Why are we here?
Maybe to make the world a better place.
Then life hit me for the first time,
I was in the cruelest war ever known.
I realized that I had a weapon in my hands,
And my best friend was among the enemy.
Where was my head.
Where was my heart.
Then I saw how my friend was sentenced to death.
He was blind, fooled and tied to a pole.
Then I could see how my gun took his life away.
When my fault was greater,
Than my desire to live.
I saw the moment of my own death,
With a rope around my neck.
And so my guilty soul,
Had lost the grace.
I need to find him again,
And leave the pain behind.

[Guitar solos: Alex RamÃ­rez, JoaquÃ­n Leal]

What is the meaning of life?
Why are we here?
Maybe to make the world a better place.
Lost in another time and place
I reached my friend's soul.
He's been waiting for so long,
To forgive my fault.
My soul is clean.
My mind is free.
My heart is opened.
