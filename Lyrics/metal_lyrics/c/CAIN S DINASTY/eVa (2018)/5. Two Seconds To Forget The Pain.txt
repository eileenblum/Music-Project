[Music and lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo. Collaborations: second voice: Arturo Megamuerte (Raven's Gate)]

To forget the pain, forget the past.
To forget the hate you have to love again.
To change your life you have to change your mind.
To change things you have to change yourself.
I will need two seconds to forget the pain.
All I want, is to hear your voice again.
All I need, is to see your face today.
It's hard to start when you're feeling sad.
It's hard to see when everything is black.
Forget the rage for the things you left.
Release your heart and free yourself.
I will need two seconds to forget the pain.
All I want, is to hear your voice again.
All I need, is to see your face today.
Don't waste your time in hurting things,
Time goes fast for every human being.
Don't waste your life feeding hate.
There's another way, it's never too late.

[Guitar solo: JoaquÃ­n Leal]

I will need two seconds to forget the pain
All I want, is to hear your voice again.
All I need, is to see your face today.
