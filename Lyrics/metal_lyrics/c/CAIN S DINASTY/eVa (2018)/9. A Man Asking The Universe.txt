Where's the answer for my dreams?
Where's the place I cannot reach?
Where's the peace in which I believe?
Is the answer inside me?
How many days and nights,
Does it take to feel alive again?
What do I have to change,
In my life to breathe again?
Where's the answer for my prayers?
I know. It is not in the past.
Now it's time to change my mind.
Now it's time to loose the innocence.
Now it's time to control the game.
Like a man asking the universe.
How many test and fails,
Does it take to feel alive again?
What I suppose to do,
In my life to breathe again?
Where's the answer for my prayers?
I know. It is not in the past.
Now it's time to change my mind.
Now it's time to loose the innocence.
Now it's time to control the game.
Like a man asking the universe.
Where's the answer for my dreams?
Where's the place I cannot reach?
Where' the peace in which I believe?
Is the answer inside me?

[Guitar solos: Alex RamÃ­rez, JoaquÃ­n Leal]

Now it's time to change my mind.
Now it's time to loose the innocence.
Now it's time to control the game.
Like a man asking the universe.
