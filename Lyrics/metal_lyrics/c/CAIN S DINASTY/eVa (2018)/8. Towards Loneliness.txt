[Marek:]
There's no love to dry my tears.
There's no Lord to keep me here.
I don't wanna be a servant, I am done.
I cannot bleed to please my love anymore...
Through a dark path of sadness,
I leave this farce behind.
I will fake no courtesy,
With those who were liars.
The place I used to call my home,
Has turned to be my cage.
I will break the bars and
I'll finally break free.
Now I hear love words,
Where before there was despise.
No one will find me.
No one will know where I hid my soul,
Or where I go.
I've become a wandering soul towards loneliness.
There's no love to dry my tears.
There's no Lord to keep me here.
I don't wanna be a servant, I am done.
I cannot bleed to please my love anymore...

[Guitar solo: JoaquÃ­n Leal]

You used to squeeze my flesh;
It felt like paradise.
Now I crawl with bleeding knees,
But I can say I'm proud.
I have recovered all my skin,
My mind, my sanity.
I'm walking on my feet again,
You won't bite me no more.

[Nezro:]
My son, you must remember who you are now.
You are by yourself, but I'll be never gone.

[Marek:]
Abandoned by my Lord, I'll be oblivion.
I'll be the nothingness, forsaken by God!

[Guitar solo: Alex RamÃ­rez]

I've become a wandering soul towards loneliness.
There's no love to dry my tears.
There's no Lord to keep me here.
I don't wanna be a servant, I am done.
I cannot bleed to please my love anymore...
You can't runaway from your destiny.
I'm running away from myself.
