She takes off her black dress,
looking to the victim.
The weak light of the candles,
shows you the dance of madness.
Spellbound by the witch.
The bitch still stole your blood.
You try to escape but you can't.
There's no way out of this hell.
The witch of blood and lust.
The lovely face of darkness.
The witch of blood and lust.
The wicked face of madness.
A cat playing with a hurting mouse,
down the walls of this wicked house.
So grotesque like Dante's Hell.
Your mind prays for salvation,
and leave behind this abomination.
There's no way out of this hell.
The witch of blood and lust.
The lovely face of darkness.
The witch of blood and lust.
The wicked face of madness.
Close to the wicked house,
justice comes with sacred signs.

[Inquisitor:]
Witch! You will confess!
Witch! You will be condemned!
Witch! Get down on your knees!
Witch! At the sign of the cross!
Hey witch! You will burn in flames!

[Marek:]
Eva I can help you.

[Eva:]
Why do you want to help me?

[Marek:]
Nezro sends me.

[Eva:]
Why?

[Marek:]
'Cause I will die for you.

[Eva:]
But I tried to kill you.

[Marek:]
You have the darkness gift.

[Eva:]
I'm just a witch.

[Marek:]
You are more than you know.

[Eva:]
I can corrupt the purest heart...
The witch of blood and lust.
The lovely face of darkness.
The witch of blood and lust.
The wicked face of madness.
The witch vampire escapes,
from the eternal flames.
The witch vampire escapes,
to play her wicked games.
The justice flames just failed.
The darkness wins again.
The great vampire awaits in a hidden place
The great vampire awaits to meet the witch again
The night in the forest claims
The moon begins to shine
And a witch begins to fly...
