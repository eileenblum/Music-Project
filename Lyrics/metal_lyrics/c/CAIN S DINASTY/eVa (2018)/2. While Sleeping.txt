[Music and lyrics: JoaquÃ­n Leal, collaborations: high screams: DÃ©bora Blanco]

Shallow life is breaking me.
I'm too weak to find myself.
My shelter is the night,
Is a night with you.
Hide, hide inside me.
Hold, hold my horns and die!
Now I think,
I need to fall in love,
But not in this world.
While sleeping,
Your cold breath is all I need.
So bad.
I will grant your wish, come with me.
Rotten blood smell, obscurity again.
She is my queen of the damned.
Feeling her kiss, growing the need,
For my soul... my soul
Here I am. I break into your dreams.
Here I am. Let me drain your soul.
Welcome to my kingdom.
Dance with demons, erase the pain.

[Guitar solos: Alex RamÃ­rez, JoaquÃ­n Leal]

While sleeping,
Your cold breath is all I need.
So bad.
I will grant your wish, follow me.
Rotten blood smell, obscurity again.
She's my queen of the damned...
Dragging me to my final home.

[Guitar solo: JoaquÃ­n Leal]

The gates of the unknown open for you...
