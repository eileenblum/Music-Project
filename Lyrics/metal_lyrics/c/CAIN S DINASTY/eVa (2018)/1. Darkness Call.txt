[Marek:]
Freed from my chains, but still losing grip.
I feel released, but something's missing.
My love and my lust, her hell's painful hurt.
My life makes no sense without her.

[Nezro:]
Miserable, out of luck.
Your mistress left you behind.
But I can help you take her back...

[Marek:]
I would die for her.

[Nezro:]
Join me in the shadows.

[Marek:]
I'm crawling in darkness,
While I decide...
Between hell and paradise.

[Guitar solos: JoaquÃ­n Leal, Alex RamÃ­rez]

[Marek:]
Now I know the only way,
Is to accept the darkness gift.
But still I am a servant of God!
I'll become the prey, I was hunting.
My life will not be the same as before.

[Nezro:]
Abandon your god
Forget the light forevermore
You will be a servant no longer

[Marek:]
I'll drink from your goblet...

[Nezro:]
Embrace eternity!

[Marek:]
I'm crawling in darkness,
While I decide...
Between hell and paradise.
I'm crawling in darkness.
Just one choice
Said and done, said and done...

[Marek Vampire:]
Losing my humanity, I've given it up.
I am charged with blood and wrath. I am full of power.

[Marek:] Where's my Eva?
[Nezro:] You must find her.
[Marek:] Where's my love?
[Nezro:] Bring her to me.

[Marek Vampire:]
My master's blood will be shed!

[Marek:]
I'm crawling in darkness,
While I decide...
Between hell and paradise.
I'm crawling in darkness.
Just one choice.
Said and done, said and done...

[Marek Vampire:]
Blood, blood, blood...
