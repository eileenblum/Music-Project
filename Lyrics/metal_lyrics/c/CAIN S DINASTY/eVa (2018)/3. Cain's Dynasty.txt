[Music and lyrics are by RubÃ©n Picazo]

I am the one who bears the guilt.
I am the hope for the damned ones.
I am the one who still carries on.
I am the one who still stands and fights.
Condemned to wander through eternity...
Sentenced for loving his god.
A wicked soul in search for peace.
My destiny stained by guilt.
My faith is stronger than my sin.
There was not second chance for me.
Cain's Dynasty - We are marked by his sin.
Cain's Dynasty - Vengeance is not for me.
I am the one who still carries on.
I am the hope for the damned ones.
Sentenced to wander through eternity...
Everything I touch wears my mark.
Everything I kiss, touched by my gift.
Everything I see it withers quickly.
Everything I love soon will die.
There was not second chance for me.
Cain's Dynasty - We are marked by his sin.
Cain's Dynasty - Vengeance is not for me.
Cain's Dynasty â On and on we'll carry on.
Cain's Dynasty â A legacy for you and me.

[Guitar solos: Joaquin Leal, Alex RamÃ­rez]

I am the one who still carries on.
I am the hope for the damned ones.
I am the one displaying the guilt.
I am the one who still stands and fights.
There was not second chance for me.
Cain's Dynasty - We are marked by his sin.
Cain's Dynasty - Vengeance is not for me.
Cain's Dynasty - On and on we'll carry on.
Cain's Dynasty - A legacy for you and me.
