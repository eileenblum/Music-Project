[Marek:]
I'm gonna tell you,
The things that changed my life.
Dark and cold was the night.
The hand of God is shelter for ones.
The hand of God is cruel for the wicked souls.

[Nezro:]
Justice flames are coming here.
Signs of good are really near.
There's no choice, there's no forgiveness.
There's no redemption for sinners.

[Inquisitor:]
I am the shining hand of God against darkness.
I will condemn and purify your madness.

[Marek:]
Forgive me my master,
I fell in love with darkness.
Forgive her my master,
And let us see your greatness.

[Marek:]
Where's God's love and piety?
Where is God's mercy?

[Crowd:] Apprehend her!
[Marek:] God's rage made man...
[Crowd:] Let's go burn her!
[Marek:] She'll be ashes...

[Marek:]
Forgive me my master,
I fell in love with darkness.
Forgive her my master,
And let us see your greatness.

[Guitar solo: JoaquÃ­n Leal]

Heat begins in this winter night;
A cold night to burn a witch...

[Inquisitor:]
You will bring the death to every one you love.
You are a sinner not a servant of God!
And you are a witch! You will corrupt even the purest heart
Prey! Repent! Prey!
Burn!

[Guitar solo: Alex RamÃ­rez]

[Marek:]
Forgive me my master,
I fell in love with darkness.
Forgive her my master,
And let us see your greatness.
