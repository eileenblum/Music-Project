[Nezro:]
Black clouds with sorrow,
Upon the tragedy.
My sons have been killed;
By fire and a stake.
I know who did this,
And he will pay for it.
In quest for vengeance,
I will need all my brothers.
Come and embrace the night.
Come together we will fight.
A black heart, a dark soul:
The shadow of the king.
From the ancient past days:
The shadow of the king.
A black cloak, a fierce face:
The shadow of the king.
A slayer awaiting:
The shadow of the king.

[Nezro:]
I found Assaru,
Was perishing at home.
Not by the hunter,
Rebellion by his sons.
We will look for them,
And they will pay for it.
An act of cowardice.
An act of treachery.
Come and embrace the night.
Come together we will fight.

[Assaru:]
Weakness, decadence.
Ashes and dust.
Betrayal and death.
Everything is ruined.

[Nezro:]
I bring you my blood...
I bring you revenge...
It's the shadow of the king.
Now Assaru joins the king.
It's the shadow of the king.
It's the shadow of the king...

[Guitar solo: Alex RamÃ­rez]

Blood and lust, feeds the witch.
Inquisitor's hands (hunter's hands).
Will condemn her...

[Guitar solo: JoaquÃ­n Leal]

[Nezro:]
What's going on here, the witch is not near.
I hear a weak heartbeat.
There's a brokenhearted and wretched soul.
He was abandoned.
He will die for her.
And he will save her.

[Assaru:]
Weakness, decadence.
Ashes and dust.
Betrayal and death.
Everything is ruined.
A black heart, a dark soul:
The shadow of the king.
From the ancient past days:
The shadow of the king.
A black cloak, a fierce face:
The shadow of the king.
A slayer awaiting:
The shadow of the king.
