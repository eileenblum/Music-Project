[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

I take a look at the past
In the quest of my life
I take a look at my sins
digging in my soul...

Which is the meaning
of this nightmare
Which is the reason
of this existence

But I only know
that I can't carry on...
I can't carry on
without your blood!

Where are my friends now?
Where are those things by which I was believed in the past?

I take a look at the ashes
of my life one more time
I spent the time with a hope,
to see the sun

Everything finishes
but I go on....
