[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

Hear this, all what I say
It's a woman story to tell
A hopeless life, just a way was left for her

This night again, it's time to pay for her flesh

So it's her soul the one's working under city lights
And it's her flesh which takes every hit of the life
And suffer will the authority lawless abuse
Tonight she'll dream that everything was part of the past

And the cruel destiny took her dignity
Her wish was to begin a new life full of hope and dreams

She's now condemned to slavery

So it's her soul the one's working under city lights
And it's her flesh which takes every hit of the life
And suffer will the authority lawless abuse
Tonight she'll dream that everything is part of the past

She's now so lonely, so black her fateâ¦
She is now so tired, there..s no way out life is a hell for her
