[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

Don't you watch me with eyes of sympathy
Don't you think I'm feeling bad
Now I see other exits, and sadness was not the only one
Don't you talk to me with charming words
And listen to me as if I was a victim
Hope is growing inside me as strong as the sea

I will need 2 seconds to forget your name
I will need 2 seconds to breath again
I will need 2 seconds to forget your name
I won't shed any tears for you

Now I walk away from you
And my heart pounds not for you
It should have never had happened
But now it's too late to change

I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't mean to make you suffer
But my eyes look into another place
My heart beats no more for you
