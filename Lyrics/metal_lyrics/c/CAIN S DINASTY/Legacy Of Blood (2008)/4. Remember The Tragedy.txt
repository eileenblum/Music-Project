[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

I remember your voice whispering
I'll never leave you alone
I remember you used to say
I'll always be with you

Then she left that tragic night
Then she left forevermore

Every night I see you in my dreams
I return to that tragic place
But I can't save you my love
I just promise to stay with you till I wake.

Now I see your face in my mind every day
I'll always remember your last words
Before you die

Each nightmare shows me the tragedy
But before I wake I see your eyes again
