[Music &amp; Lyrics: Rob G.]

There was a time empty of hope
And full of misery
Where nothing made sense
I've seen death running before my eyes
Slowly I fall in darkness
That's the last down I..ll see
My destiny is to die as a mortal being

And tonight I feel inside
All the power and the force
Of those who preceded to me
Ancient blood runs trough my veins
Fire burns inside my soul
Not a thing will be the same again

I've seen the world condemned
Since the beginning of our time
That..s the essence of my pain

in this coldest existence
I've seen the ancient nations fall
That's my LEGACY OF BLOOD

I am walking trough the dark
In this painful eternity
And a dream of a purple dawn
Repeating in my mind
Remaining in the shadows
I'm searching eternal rest
To drink the blood of my own brothers
Is my sentence
