[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

I will tell you a story, a dream that turns into nightmare
Vanilla flowers, flowers to a dead heart, a sweet voice whispering
An unfinished poem
The torment is over, the anguish has disappeared
Calm arrives in a moment of confusion
How can a person change so fast
And sweetness turns to sourness

Now after all this time
I will remember your tears of pain
Illusions are killed by time
And promises broken for walking in different ways

Blind was the feeling that united us, so strong, so weak
We've been close to insanity
We have our world of love
The flame is over but I can't forget you
