[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

Each time you walked further from me, you said it couldn't work
I'd like to forget the moment when everything finished
But you're in my mind I can't forget

And though it hurts I know you won't return
But today I beg you for the last time

Come to me and don't you ever leave me
This time yeahh
Come to me for my lips are thirsty for you
Come to me cause if you ain't coming
I won't go on

I can't bear getting away from you
I don't want us to split this way

Feelings can be pretended
Love is unleashed
