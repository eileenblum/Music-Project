[Music &amp; Lyrics: RubÃ©n Picazo]

A new journey has begun
In the search for a brave new world.
From the place where it started
There are only memories

Why did I have the chance
of being a chosen one?
There was only death for them
No time to look behind.

So far away from home
One time I will return

I won't forget your voice again
I only smell the scent of death
I won't forget your voice again
This is the time I walk away
But I'll be here again to fight

And so goes on this journey
All life is growing dark
It's time to face my foe
This time I'm in control

So far away from home
My vengeance is to come
