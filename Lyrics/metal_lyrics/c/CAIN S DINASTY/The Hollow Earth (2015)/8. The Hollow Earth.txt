In my dream I walked on Ice, I climbed to the highest peak
Beyond I found a glorious valley

It was narrow and deep, covered by dense canopy
Illuminated by a warm sun away in the distance

There was a real oasis of life
In the middle of a vast desert of ice
It was very cold when I descended to reach the great canopy
It extended towards a new horizon
It was new for me and I could not believe

The world had turned into a warm land were wealth flowed
The earth was hollow and was full of life
Oh mother earth let your essence surround me

"Descend into Sneffels Yocul crater
Caressed by Scartaris shadow before the calends of July
You bold traveler, and youâll reach the center of the earth
As I have done"
[Arne Saknussemm]

But now my dream could be true
Maybe this place could be real!

Why hiding the secrets of the world?
Why denying? Why not showing?
Why denying the evidence?
Why denying the truth essence?

Come to see, come to hear
Come to smell and touch, to understand

The hollow Earth is full of life and hope
The hollow Earth is full of life and love
Feel her strength!

Now I walk in this place, maybe someday you could be here!

Why hiding the secrets of the world?
Why denying? Why not showing?
Why denying the evidence?
Why denying the truth essence?

Come to see, come to hear
Come to smell and touch, to understand

The hollow Earth is full of life and hope
The hollow Earth is full of life and love
Look inside her

Donât be fooled, Donât let be ruled
Donât be like they want to be.

There are other worlds, but they are in this one.
