I still remember the first time I saw you
Oh! Then I felt that you were alone

I was trapped by your smile
I can not stop looking into your eyes

Now the loneliness is going away
Now we have each other in moments of weakness
Two fools against the world

Since that day you became my best friend
Oh my darling it will be until the end!

You brought light to my life
There's no star in the sky like you

Now the loneliness is going away
Now we have each other in moments of weakness
Two fools against the world

Now I think of you
In the distance when you're not here
You are a dream come true
You are the best of my life
Oh I feel you so close to me
Oh I love you with all my strength

We'll walk together until the end of time
Everything I feel for you becomes a rhyme

You brought sense to my life
There's no star in the sky like you

Now the loneliness is going away
Now we have each other in moments of weakness
Two fools against the world
