When I look at the sky at night
I see things hard to explain
Sometimes they look like lights
And objects that seem to fly
I have left all my fears behind
I am ready to reveal the mystery
Sometimes we must believe
To see what's never been seen

Grey!
I know who you are
You want to steal my emotions
Grey!
I know what you want
But you can't control me

They have been here since ancient times
Watching every move of human race
Abducting people around the world
To know who we are
They want to create an hybrid race
To carry on
But you'll never get me
'Cause I have a strong mind

Grey!
I know who you are
You want to steal my emotions
Grey!
I know what you want
But you can't control me

[Guitar solos: Joaquin Leal/Alex Ramirez]

People want to see the unseen
But no one wants to believe

Grey!
I know who you are
You want to steal my emotions
Grey!
I know what you want
But you can't control me
But you can't control me

No one can't control meâ¦
