Now I find the way to survive
Fighting through the years
Now I'm here to describe
And defeat all my fears

Day by day I walk in a lonely road
I never lose the hope
I've been never broken
You can feel this voice
You can feel its strength
Year by year I dream
With a future that now is here

I am a beast emerging from hell
I am a beast rising from the ruins of the past
I am a beast unleashed from the depths of hell
I am a beast now I can give you the best
I am the screaming lungs

Now no one can stop me
I'm far away from all the lairs
Now I know and control the game
Is the time for the victory

Day by day I walk in a lonely road
I never lose the hope
I've been never broken
You can feel this voice
You can feel its strength
Year by year I dream
With a future that now is here

I am a beast emerging from hell
I am a beast rising from the ruins of the past
I am a beast unleashed from the depths of hell
I am a beast now I can give you the best
I am the screaming lungs

I brought you a legacy of blood
And I fought against madmen, witches and vampires!

I am a beast emerging from hell
I am a beast rising from the ruins of the past
I am a beast unleashed from the depths of hell
I am a beast now I can give you the best
I am the screaming lungs

Yes I am the screaming lungs
