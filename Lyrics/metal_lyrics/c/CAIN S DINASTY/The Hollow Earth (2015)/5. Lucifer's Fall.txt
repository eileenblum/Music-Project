He opens his eyes
And wakes up in hell
Still bears the pain under his wings
Surrounded by those who supported him

He looks his paradise lost
With tears in his eyes
The light will not shine on his face again
But he will not regret

There's no place for hope
There's no place for love
There's no good way for him
Evil is their only single good

Oh
