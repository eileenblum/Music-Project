There is a world behind this world
There are more things out there
Than you can believe
Listen what I tell
I'll show you the truth

The Earth has two souls
A light side and a dark side
You may think
We are the result of an evolution

Some books relate that we were created
By a divine intervention
But the roots of mankind didn't grow
As you think

No one can stop my words
No one can silence my voice
Or keep me from looking into your eyes
I don't want to feel again
Your tears falling down your face
Changes are very close to mankind
Come to me I'll tell you more

We were combined, and modified
To be an enslaved race in this world
We were designed, and conceived
In Sumerian texts you'll find the truth

You may think it makes no sense
You won't even understand
What I'm talking about
But listen to me again
Everything you know is wrong

Now I want you to know the truth
Forget what you know to find the proof
They came from Nibiru...
They are the Annunaki
They created us

Some books relate that we were created
By a divine intervention
But the roots of mankind didn't grow
As you think

No one can stop my words
No one can silence my voice
Or keep me from looking into your eyes
I don't want to feel again
Your tears falling down your face
Changes are very close to mankind

When these changes come true
All mankind will be free

Have you seen what humanity can do?
What will you change?
