I saw the comet fall
And rivers turned to blood
Two hundred million troopers will fight today
For a new chance for mankind

Burning fire, bloody moon
Dying stars and blackened sun

Who will fight to live again in their promised land?
Who will live eternally in the new Jerusalem?
The promise land!

They will ride upon the Earth with the wrath of the Lamb to show the world the things that will befall
And thus, await the tribes, with fear in their minds, and tears of repentance

Burning fire, bloody moon
Dying stars and blackened sun

Wherever you go to, wherever you run
No matter how you can pray
The beasts are unleashed from the depths of the world
They will fight against the Lamb

And when I see the broken sky
And feel that nothing will be as before
Despite of all weÂ´ll be together
I'll take your hand and carry on

All your souls will be mine.

Who will fight to live again in their promised land?
Who will live eternally in the new Jerusalem?
