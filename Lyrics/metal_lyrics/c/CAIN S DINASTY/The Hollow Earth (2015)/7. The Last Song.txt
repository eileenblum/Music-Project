With tears in my eyes I still remember you
Sometimes life hits you and puts you to the test.

I can not stop looking at the past.
When sadness came into my soul.

We heard that song together
And we sang like rock stars
We heard that song together
The last time I saw your eyes

I would have given my life to save yours
I know you're guiding me through life

'Cause every day I think of you
Someday we'll meet again

We heard that song together
And we sang like rock stars
We heard that song together
The last time I saw your eyes
The last time I saw your eyes
