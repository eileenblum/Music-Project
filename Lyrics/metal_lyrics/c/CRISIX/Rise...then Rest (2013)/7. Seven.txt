Back in the first steps
of the whole of Christianity
They tried to teach us their beliefs
Satan is alive
through the seven deadly sins
The spirit could be willing but the flesh
is weak

[Pre-Chorus:]
Just another victim at the gates of hell
Deadly sins of pleasure, sons of the human
race

[Chorus:]
Seven ways! Seven feelings!
Seven... parts of human being!

Seven ways!
Chose your way to sin
Seven Feelings!
Feel it burnin' in
Seven!
Seven parts of human being

Useless empty words
from the lies of the church
Cruel abuse of power over faith
Practice what you preach
hypocritical piece of shit
You are the first one who sins

[Pre-Chorus:]
Just another victim at the gates of hell
Deadly sins of pleasure, sons of the human
race
Just another woman
Just another man
Just another sinner
that will burn in flames

[Chorus]

Greed, Wrath
Sloth, Lust
Gluttony, Envy
and Pride!

[Chorus]
