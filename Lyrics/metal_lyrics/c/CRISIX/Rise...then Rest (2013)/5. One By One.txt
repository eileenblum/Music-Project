Stand up! Fight for your rights
Don't fear men in uniforms
So brave under weapons
Destroyers of freedom!
No chance! Future past is come
Refuse their authority
If we succumb to its price
it will be the end of the words!

Goodbye to freedom of speech!
(Goodbye to freedom of speech! )
Goodbye to the rights of our beings!
Goodbye!

[Pre-Chorus!]
Sons of a bitch!
Please no more lies, no more crimes!
Sons of the law!
Don't terrorize!

[Chorus:]
One by One
Face my face
drop your gun
if you are brave
One by One
come to me
Let me see
your real name
Dumb bastard!

It's clear! No time to cry
Resist! Don't leave the front line
It's just what they want from you
Butchers of innocence!
Burn out their point of view
Teach 'em how to live free
If we reject those feelings
total blackout of the dream

Feelings that can not be killed!
(Feelings that can not be killed!)
Feelings that will grow in me!
Fight!

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
