In your fuckin' face!
Shut up!

[Chorus:]
IN YOUR world of lines your FUCKIN' FACE
will be smashed
IT'S YOUR time my friend YOUR FACE
pay the price

In your fuckin' face!

Before you speak just take a look at you
Find a better thing to do
Forever and ever our eyes hide the lie
of your prejudice

Wasting... your time!

Your words don't defeat me
I'm above your poisoned tongue

But tired... so tired!

[Pre-Chorus:]
So now! Prepare! Obey!
And then... listen! I'll kick you...

In your fuckin' face!

[Chorus:]
Your world of lies will be smashed
Your face pay this price

In your fuckin' face!

Open your eyes
just think and realize
You're talking without judgement
I'm more than you say
I'm more than you think
You should know me before spit

Wasting... your time!

Your words don't defeat me
I'm above your poisoned tongue

But tired... so tired!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Your world of lies will be smashed
Your face pay this price
IN YOUR world of lines your FUCKIN' FACE
will be smashed
IT'S YOUR time my friend, YOUR FACE pay
the price

In your fuckin' face!

You're trying to hurt me turning them
against me
Honor! Respect! Both feelings leave your
being
Pray in vain! No future for your words
It's too late my friend
Dig a hole with simple sentences
fall down and feed the worms!

You're nailed to the cross!
Too late, your blame is a truth!
Reap what you sow! Feed the worms!

After you speak just take a look at me
You have got nothing to do
Never, nevermore! Your eyes hide the lie
of your own prejudice

Still wasting... your time!

Your words don't defeat meÂ 
I'm above your poisoned tongue

But tired... yes, tired!

[Pre-Chorus:]
So now! Listen!
I'll kick you...

In your fuckin' face!

[Chorus:]
Your world of lies will be smashed
Your face will pay this price
