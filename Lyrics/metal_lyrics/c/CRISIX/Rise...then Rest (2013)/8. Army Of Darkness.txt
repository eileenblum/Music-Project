What's this, what's that strange sound?
Look at these evil lifeless eyes
The spirits of the forest have been taken...
...her body and her mind

I'll swallow your soul!

After fighting in the pit...
...a mighty book is the only thing I need
To take from the altar the book of dead...
...you must recite the following words:

[Chorus:]
Klaatu Barada Nikto!
This is my boomstick
Klaatu Barada $&amp;%!
Fear the dead
Hail the Army of Darkness!

Hail to the king baby!

A mistake has returned life
to the skeletons
They're rising from their graves
Hell has been unleashed,
it's a sea of bones
Damn it! I forgot the following words:

[Chorus]

Hive me back the Necronomicon [2x]

Give me back the Necronomicon!
Give me! The Necronomicon!
Necronomicon!
Face the face of the Army of Darkness!
I want back my Necronomicon!
I want back the book of dead!
I want it back!
Hail the Army of Darkness!
