Terror! Agony!
Your life's goin' to exile
Planets! Reduced to ashes!
Victims of an unfair fate
Dark times rule the universe
the decay of your hope
A race feared by everyone
Fear the demon of the cold

[Pre-Chorus:]
Frieza...
Frieza...

[Chorus:]
Frieza the Tyrant!
He will come to conquer your world
Frieza the Tyrant!
Your lives for him are nothing, Burn!
Frieza the Tyrant!
Surrender to his dark empire
Frieza the Tyrant!
Remember the name
Frieza x 3
Frieza the Tyrant!

Nightmare! Genocide!
Laughing on the throne
(But) Hanging by a thread!
The evil legacy will disappear
Deep inside his black heart
fear of a world of warriors
A legend feared by the lord
could be the end of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Burnin' in the fire!
Visions of the end!
The tyrant will die under the rage of the blue eyes
Legend is alive!
The hope of Saiyan's pride!
Frieza's time will come by the hands of Bardock's son

Frieza...
Frieza...
Kakarot...
Kakarot!

[Chorus]
