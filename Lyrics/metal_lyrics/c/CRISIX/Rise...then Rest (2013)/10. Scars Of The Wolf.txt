PlayingÂ 
with a mutant body
Playing to be God
They created a killing machine
Now it's out of control

It's time to hunt you!

Painful surgical procedure
Erased memories
Return to the wild side
of the beast called Wolverine
Perfect lethal fusion
between bones and adamantium
Scientists had dream
a project called Weapon-X

[Pre-Chorus:]
Unleashed
He attacks
Ripping your face
You can't hurt
Forever unscarred

[Chorus:]
Scars of the Wolf! [2x]
No marks!
Behold the truth!

Dialogue's not an option
Bloodbath is the only way
Longing for freedom
A good attack, the best defense
Like a savage dog
he defeats his enemies
Deadly claws inside
Strange blades of victory

[Pre-Chorus]

Scars of the Wolf! [2x]
His eyes reveal the truth!

Playing with a mutant body
Probably a mistake
They created a killing machine
Now it's time to pray

[Pre-Chorus]

Scars of the Wolf!
