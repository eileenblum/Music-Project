Save yourself from evil
minds that can hurt
Bite them all with power,
all for your throne
If you fall you're food for the crows
The never-ending battle can't be ignored!
Show your scars of war!
Night is darkest just before the dawn!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cross the wall!
Rise, don't rest till your last breath
Fight so proud (till your grave)
Scream so loud!

[Chorus:]
Rise... then Rest, your fate
I can see your fire
Beyond your scars, beneath your skin
Behind your eyes, I can see the fire

Rise... then rest!

Crawling down a black hole
you mustn't stand
You must feed the force needed to break
Raise your fist till the end of your days
Say goodbye to childhood,
you must learn to fight!
Keep your flame alive!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Break the wall!
Rise, then rest after your last breath
Fight so proud (till your grave)
Scream so loud!

[Chorus]

Rise... then rest!

Never surrender in the dark
Across the shadows you must walk
You've got to rise before you fall
Above the shadows you are the wolf

Spit it out!

Never surrender when it's dark
Across the shadows where you walk
It's time to rise, It's time to win
Above the shadows you are the wolf

[Chorus]

Rise!
Rise!
Rise!
... then rest!
