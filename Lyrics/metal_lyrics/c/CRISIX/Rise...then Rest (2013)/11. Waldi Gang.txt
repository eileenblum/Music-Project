Just another night at 10 o'clock
Mark is waiting so alone
Meanwhile Busi is working so hard
delivering pizza!
Requena is getting nervous at his home
with desire to rehearse and making joints
Javi and Juli are brewing nasty farts
eating fast food!

Now! It's time to play, It's time to work
It's time to talk about shit!
About tits! About us! We are...

Waldis! Waldi gang! Inawaldis! Waldi band!
We are misfits! Not the punk band!
We are true Ralph Wiggum fans!
We are Waldi gang!

Go banana!

You know, the next show is coming soon
We are planning to use maracas and ba-
llons
A fake electric chair and monkey masks
were lost in Wacken!
The Madness is goin' on in waldi land
The example are the lyrics we are writing
I don't know what to say, so
eh McArena! Aiii!!

Now! It's time to play, It's time to work
It's time to talk about James!
About Blitz! About thash! We are...

Waldis! Waldi gang! Inawaldis! Waldi band!
We are misfits! Not the punk band!
We are true Mr. Bean fans!
We are Waldi gang! Fuckin' Inawaldis!

Late at night before the march
we've got more to say
Here we stand like there's no tomorrow!
We love this shit, we love this way,
we love this fuckin' sound!
We don't give a fuck
if you don't understand!

We are...
Waldis! Waldi gang! Inawaldis! Waldi band!
There's no cure, too late
Waldi gang!
