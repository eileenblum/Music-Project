Really difficult to describe
It's the hardest kind of fight
The collapse of your brain
Seems like eternal day and night
Death has come for those friends
Death has come for that part of you
Now all my memories
live in a trail of tears

[Pre-Chorus:]
Silence, crying, my darkest time
Those demons torment me
Searching for an answer
The eternal question:
why you left my side?

[Chorus:]
No way out
No way to it
No way out
They can't hear your voice
No way out
No way to them
No way out but...
Those voices shall remain

Really difficult to survive
when hope is a broken glass
New reality before my eyes
New condition over my faith
A new lesson I have to learn
I must be stronger than this cruel fate
That voice in my head
will live forever

[Pre-Chorus:]
Crawling through my darkest time
Those demons follow me
There's no answer
They're gone
far away from my side

[Chorus]

Really difficult to keep strong
when the light never seems to come
Never-ending memories
keep my force alive

[Chorus]
