Beware they walk among us
Just feel it, Conspiranoia!

Who controls?
Who's got the answer behind that door?
Premeditated fate
written in the pages of a black book
Don't you see? They're playing
A game with brainless marionettes
Who pulls the strings?
Hidden truth by hidden men

Kill it!
Just open your mind
Feel it!
Conspiranoia

Who's involved?
Who's got the power in the shadows?
Who drives the flock?
Blindness imposed from dark roots
If you know the answer
Razor's edge on your neck
Who pulls the strings?
Curiosity can kill

More than words
More than meets the eye
Cross the line
Kill your ignorance
Kill it!
Just open your mind
Feel it!
Conspiranoia

THEY WALK AMONG US! [4x]
(Cons-pi-ra-noia)

Don't you see? They're lying
Don't believe the words they say
Who pulls the strings?
Masterminds with a Masterplan

More than words
More than meets the eye
Cross the line
Kill your ignorance
Kill it!
Just open your mind
Feel it!
Conspiranoia
