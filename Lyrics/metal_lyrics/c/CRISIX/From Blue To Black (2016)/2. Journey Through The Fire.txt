Touch the magic circle in a burnin' bed of nails
Possessed by desire, Devil by the tail 
(DEVIL BY THE TAIL)
Like an animal, like a beast
Inner dreams exploding in the feast
(IN THE FEAST)

I feel satisfaction by her spell
I see the hunger in these eyes
Dancing with a Demon 
that's why I must ride
Journey through the fire!

SHOUT! SHOUT! SHOUT!
Baby take me higher!
SHOUT! SHOUT! SHOUT!
JOURNEY THROUGH THE FIRE!

Temperature is rising, pleasure's growing up
making stronger the beast with two backs
(BEAST WITH TWO BACKS)
Like a mad dog, like a witch
Sweating, exhaling, flames are our switch
(OUR SWITCH)

I am trapped by her mighty spell
The hunger has no end
Dancing with the Devil
that's why I still ride
Journey through the fire!

SHOUT! SHOUT! SHOUT!
Baby take me higher!
SHOUT! SHOUT! SHOUT!
JOURNEY THROUGH THE FIRE!

COME ON AND PLAY! COME ON AND PLAY! 
CUM WITH ME AND PLAY!
COME ON AND PLAY!
Pussy pride
COME! COME! COME!
COME ON AND PLAY!
CUM! CUM! CUM!
COME ON, LET'S PLAY!
Lick it up!
I can get you
Sex â Tits â Fucktion

SHOUT! SHOUT! SHOUT!
Baby take me higher!
SHOUT! SHOUT! SHOUT!
JOURNEY THROUGH THE FIRE!
