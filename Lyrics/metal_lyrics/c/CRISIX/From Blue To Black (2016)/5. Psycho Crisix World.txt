Let me tell you a story
'bout a valley of shit
An endless tale of love and hate
Let me show you a place
where your eyes escape from your face
A lovely dump, a friendly stench

PSYCHO!
PSYCHO CRISIX WORLD!
PSYCHO!
CRISIX WORLD!

Let me feel sensations
'bout livin' among the stink
Just lovely words, rotten to the core
Let me teach you how
to survive where you're falling now
Corrupted air, Infected ground

PSYCHO!
PSYCHO CRISIX WORLD!
PSYCHO!
CRISIX WORLD!
Full of nasty people!
Full of nasty scum!
But we need to understand
We can't live OUTSIDE THESE WALLS

Spread the fire, ugly existence
on a dirty atmosphere
The thin line between love and hate,
an identity mark that defines my state

Full of nasty people
Full of nasty scum
What a fragrance
Home Sweet Home

IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT
DON'T YOU LIKE IT? WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT [2x]
DON'T YOU LIKE IT? WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT
Well...

SHIT! FUCK! SHIT! FUCK!

After the explanation
How about this crappy pie?
Don't you wanna take a little piece?
Let me share with you
We eat it every day and night
If you taste the cake it'll be like your wife

PSYCHO!
PSYCHO CRISIX WORLD!
PSYCHO!
CRISIX WORLD!
Full of nasty people!
Full of nasty scum!
But we need to understand
We can't leave the CRISIX WORLD
