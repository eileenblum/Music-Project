A strange commotion and a clear devotion to kill
A subconscious feeling against my own will
Where am I? When am I? Why am I playing with fire?
This must be a place for weird desires

In a trance that creates a strange world!

A figure in black before me
That's just the son of my tainted mind
Just another fear
Watching me with a thousand eyes

Distortion, lost in a dream
The end of sanity
Welcome to a...

Strange commotion and a clear devotion to kill
A subconscious feeling against my own will
Where am I? When am I? Now I'm playing with fire
This must be a place for weird desires
