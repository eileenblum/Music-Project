Futureâs all behind me
Past is gonna die with me

Time
Time keeps beating
Time keeps beating on my head
Inside my shelter I will never rest
Never fuckin' rest

Oh!

Time keeps beating on my head
Outside my shelter Blue is falling down
Black is calling now...

NOW! Final round
Twisted from the depths of my old mind
MINE! My old mind
Just tell me why?

Fade to black!
Written since our birth
Raping the blue!
The plague of Mother Earth

Futureâs all behind me
Past is gonna die with me
Futureâs all behind me
Dead with me!

Crawling from blue to black
No more warnings, Void is calling my name
Caused by the result of human condition,
the blade of perdition, so now...

BURNT! Our fault!
Drifter in a world that's fading out
NOW! Rotten ground
Just tell me how?

Fade to black!
The disease begins at birth
Raping the blue!
The plague of mother earth

Futureâs all behind me
Past is gonna die with me
Futureâs all behind me
Dead with me!

Scavengers came to rape the world
Scavengers come for you... all!
ALL!

What can I do? (Embrace expiration)
I'm losing my head, chaotic reaction!
The meaning of life (There's no explanation)
but clear is the direction.

The cancer of creation
needs isolation,
Hope is getting cold.
Avarice leads us all (straight to the end [3x])
To a dead end!

So now, NOW! lethal sound
rising from the depths of my old mind
MINE! Twisted mind
Just tell me why?
NOW! BURNT!
Drifter in a world from blue to black
BLACK!
The Plague of mother earth!

Futureâs all behind me
Past is gonna die with me
Futureâs all behind me
Dead with me!
