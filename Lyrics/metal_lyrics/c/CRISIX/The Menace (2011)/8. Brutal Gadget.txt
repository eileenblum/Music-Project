Under the sea rests a mystery
The mask of an ancient god of jokes
One day a man found it
And his life changed foreverâ¦

Mask!

I am ready for the party
The first step is âCoco Bongoâ
But I need a Lot of money
Letâs go and rob a bank

Letâs Rock!

[Chorus:]
Dressed to kill
Wearing the power of this strange Mask
An awesome thing, the Brutal Gadget!

Brutal Gadget!

All the cops behind my trace
Iâm not bad, look at my face
Dreaming of this pretty lady
Sheâs so hot, she drives me crazy

They call me âCuban Peteâ
Iâm the king of the rumba beat
When I play my maracas I go chimchikibum chimchikibum
Azucar!

Azucar!

[Chorus:]
Dressed to kill
Wearing the power of this strange Mask
An awesome thing, the Brutal Gadget!

[Solo: Requena]

[Solo: Busi]

I am only a simple man
With a simple dream
I must save the girl

[Chorus]

Brutal Gadget!
