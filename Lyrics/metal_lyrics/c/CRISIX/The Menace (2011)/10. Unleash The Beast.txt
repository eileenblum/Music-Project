If you want to destroy all bastards of the world,
I know a weapon to practice this sport,
If you want to spread their brains to the wall,
Use this weapon, kill âem all!

Unleash the Beast

[Chorus:]
This is a funny lesson in violence,
To feel pleasure to kill,
Fighting among the living,
You will fell the fire.

You can run, nevermind, hell awaits,
This is the curse of the legions of death,
Morbid visions will blind your eyes,
This is the art of shred

You can pray for survival, useless though,
Metal force of thrash smashes your face,
You will be crying for your life, I know,
We will have no mercy, it is like a demonâs breath

Unleash the Beast

[Chorus:]
This is a funny lesson in violence,
To feel pleasure to kill,
Fighting among the living,
You will fell the fire.
You can run, nevermind, hell awaits,
This is the curse of the legions of death,
Morbid visions will blind your eyes,
This is the art of shred

[Solo: Requena]

[Chorus]

Unleash the Beast!
