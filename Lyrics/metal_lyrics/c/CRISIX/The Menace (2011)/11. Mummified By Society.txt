Fear and hate in you pupils
You show me your prejudice
Refused, murder looks until you kill
My own being with an insane mind
Ashes, dust in population
Is the vision about the infection!

[Pre-Chorus:]
I am the black sheep
But I can resist
Destined to live
Mummified by society

[Chorus:]
Mummified by Society [x2]
Break the fucking chains of oppression of Society!

[Solo: Requena]

Remember your principles
Carry on with yourself
Donât be their disciple
Donât be another puppet! [Repeat]

Face the enemy in the streets of lies, blood and hate!
Fury in our eyes, we will resist in this crazy world!

Fuck! World of shit!
Rubbish in your face!
Rats! Wretched rats!
You will burn, see you in hell!

[Solo: Busi]
[Solo: Busi &amp; Requena]

[Chorus]
