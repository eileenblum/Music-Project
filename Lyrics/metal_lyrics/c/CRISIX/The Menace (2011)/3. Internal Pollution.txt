When the night comes I feel high
Demons in a liquid form arrive
Witches in black star to say
Welcome to the ministry of pain!

But I like this pain!
Iâm prepared to rise
With my Holy Grail
Do you wanna taste?

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah!
Fight! Till your last breath!
Go!
Burn! Burn inside you!

[Chorus:]
This is the army of barrel and viceâ¦
Alcoholic supporters from hell!
Sending the world to its demiseâ¦
Alcoholic supporters from hell!

Enjoy the miseryâ¦

The real meaning of the night
Starts with the violence in our minds
Walking, blinded, out of control
Internal pollution, new reborn!

Possessed by a trace of internal grace
Feeling without sense
Is this shit so real?

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Enjoy the miseryâ¦
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha

Join our army!
The beer army!
Feed our army!
Raining beer!

[Solo: Busi]

Internalâ¦
Pollution!
