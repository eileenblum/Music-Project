Lied to, he was returned to life, the human world now is a weird place.
Betrayed he was sent far beyond in hell,
But the love for his darling took him back to earth,
He never knew the conditions of that deal.

What can you see,
Only pain and misery.
Must obey your Master,
Burning flesh for meâ¦

[Chorus:]
He is a Hell-Spawn, Devil rejected, destined to command the troops in the Armageddon.
He is a Hell-Spawn, trying to escape, so far awayâ¦

Tortured where the souls lie in sorrow he gave in,
In order to carry out the evil purposes of a superior being,
Now against his will he is tied,
Chained to obey the evil wishes of those who cheated himâ¦

[Chorus:]
He is a Hell-Spawn, Devil rejected, destined to command the troops in the Armageddon.
He is a Hell-Spawn, trying to escape, so far away, from the evil hands of Malebolgia.

Once returned the ground the questions about his existence began,
The reason why he had been returned was still a mystery
What are these chains? Whatâs this power?
I know this world but I donât know my own being.

I want to get my love back.
I want to get rid of them.
I want to get my soul back.
I want to win my war.

I am Violator.
What the hell do you want of me?
You will be my bitch.
Try it fuckinâ clown.

[Solo: Requena]

Fuckinâ clown.

[Solo: Busi]

I want to get my love back.
I want to get rid of them.
I want to get my soul back.
I want to win my war.
