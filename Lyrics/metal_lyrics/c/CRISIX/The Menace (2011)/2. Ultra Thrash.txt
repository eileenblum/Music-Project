Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrgh!

[Chorus:]
Ultra Thrash [3x]
Ultra fuckinâ thrash!

Pread the secret of our madness, a good insanity
Scream! Blend your minds making you a fucking crawling chaos
A new experience of mental disorder while your head is smashed till it explodes
Real or unreal, itâs your choice, mad strange sound storming your senses, thenâ¦

Losing your control!
No reason to stop!
Look it up! Check it out! And then spit it out!!

[Chorus:]
Ultra thrash [3x]
Ultra fuckinâ thrash!

Attack! Surrounded by ultra maniacs, keep your ass alive
Oh, no! Walls of death are going to crush me and crush âem all
We know youâre here looking for your drug, standing till your last breath
But we have a simple question: are you ready for the CRYSYS attack?

We are the menace!!

[Chorus:]
Ultra thrash [3x]
Ultra fuckinâ thrash!

[Solo: Busi  / Solo: Requena]

[Repeat Chorus]
