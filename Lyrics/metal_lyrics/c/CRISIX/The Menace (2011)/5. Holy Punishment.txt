Welcome to a land of pain
In the name of godâ¦ Black rain!

From the church
Comes the storm
Under sacred
Command of god

Like a black pestilence
Invade the land
Spreading violence
Like animals

[Pre-Chorus:]
Itâs time to die
Must be sacrificed
Eternal disgrace
Under punishment

Holy Punishment!

Time of war
People in chains
Crucifixion!
Rivers of blood
Virgins in flames
Inquisition!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Itâs time to die
Must be sacrificed
Eternal disgrace
Under punishment

[Chorus:]
Holy punishment
Holyâ¦
Youâll never see the light

Under holy attack
Troops of lies will rise
Under punishment
Holy punishment!

[Solo: Busi]

Piles of corpses return to life
Screaming for vengeance
Through the evil gates of hell
To kill godâs disciples

This is the rebellion of dead
Murderers will be slaughtered
Thereâs no fuckinâ mercy
Welcome to our hell!

[Chorus:]
Holy punishment
Holyâ¦
Youâll never see the light
Under holy attack
Troops of lies will rise
Under punishment
Holy punishment!
