Before the gates of death, with enormous sorrow
The lies of men condemned me to this punishment
Driven by the lightning of doomâs hollow
The hammer of justice smashed my brain

Electric embodiment!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now youâll pay the price
I will take my vengeance
I was not guilty
Taste my hate, Iâm raging!

[Chorus:]
Electric Possession!
Iâm the stormâs reflection
Fatal fate, Electric Possession!
Rage invasion
You will pay!

I was condemned by humans
Now Iâll condemn you
Your sons will pay your mistakes
With my electric soul

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo: Busi]

Feel the power of lightning
Eternal storm
Running in your entrails
Like a crazy train!

Now youâll pay the price
I will take my vengeance

[Chorus:]
Iâm the stormâs reflection
Fatal fate, Electric Possession!
Rage invasion
You will pay!

Electric Possession!
