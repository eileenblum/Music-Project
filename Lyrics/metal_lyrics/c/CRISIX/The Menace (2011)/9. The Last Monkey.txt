[Solo: Requena]

Going back in evolution
Return to a primitive state
What is the meaning of life?
If I am alone in the world

I am the last monkey (Monkeyâ¦)
Hallowed be the monkey! (Monkeyâ¦)
I am the last monkey (Monkeyâ¦)
One against the worldâ¦

All life is going to be extinct
But one being resists
In a time of war
Deprivation of souls

Afraid, alone in the dark
I am going insane
No more food, no more light
Condemned to die!

[Pre-Chorus:]
A time of blindness!
A sign of evil!

[Chorus:]
Running for my life, an endless run, I hear the screams of pain
They kill without mercy, I canât understand!

Fight against the global madness
Lethal weapons crush the world
Families are crying in sadness
I canât believe, itâs another war

Army of a bastard nation
Follow the orders of a pig
Wretched human destination
Rivers of blood, canât you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Total destruction of the human race made by the hands of logical fate
Only I can see, only I can hear, no one will stay alive, No!
Iâm alone, Iâm afraid, Iâm the only one, insane!
Seas of blood, the world is over, endless suffering, mind disorder!

[Solo: Requena / Solo: Busi]

Going back in evolution
Return to a primitive state
What is the meaning of life?
If I am alone in the world

I am the last monkey (Monkeyâ¦)
Hallowed be the monkey! (Monkeyâ¦)
I am the last monkey (Monkeyâ¦)
One against the worldâ¦
