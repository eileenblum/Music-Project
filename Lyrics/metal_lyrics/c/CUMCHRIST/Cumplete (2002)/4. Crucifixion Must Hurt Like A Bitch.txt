Bleeding and suffering I laugh at you
Divine is what you are not
Torture and dying are well deserved
The greatest hoax of all time
Decadence follows a line of shit
Pushed by a race of all-scum
Blind by a veil of cowardice
Do unto you what I will
Kneeling and praying, you must be saved
Sheep-minded herds plod along
Truth abounds, but you choose not to see
Never to open your eyes
Crucifixion must hurt like a bitch
