We are the voice of buried knowledge, the eternal life among the trees
We sent the wise to teach you well, here is where the heroes rest in peace, guide your sword and bless your soul

Some brothers got away to be free, to keep our tales alive
Here we are again, marching northward, searching our site
Some others are still living in our sacred oak shrines
To save you, to embrace you, to make us reborn

Finally we reached the province, their paradise, the city of lies
And forced to mix with them again to serve Amyntas well
Close to being absorbed by Rome, we can't give up
We gotta defend our land with honor, blood and sacrifice.

We can't be killed by the passage of time
We made history, we've built our line
From words of the old ones to our childs
The mountains screamed our name, Galatians.

After all this time, the paths we've crossed from day to night
We saw the darkness, we met the evil
For our fallen cantons, tetrarchs and buried people
We will never surrender to the arms of the eagle.
