Under a tree the laves touch my skin
Together with the sun, we sing this song
Here comes Mabon.
I still hear the sound of swords and shields
The voices of the children running for their lives
Can you hear them crying?

Gold and flowers on their tombs, they rest closer to the shores
Brave warriors, druids and chiefs watch the fallen autumn leaves

So tell me why it had to happen?
Our homes are now in ruins
Raven take my noble spirit
Where the skies meet the seas
When Mabon releases its leaves
