It was on the third century, our brothers went west across Greece
Threatening Delphi's place, to burn Apollo's Sanctuary
We attacked the Romans before the Uprising but we failed
Apollo was by their side invoking thunderstorms at dawn.
Breno fell down, killed himself with wine and laid on the battleground
Our men were slain by the winter's frost
But we shall never surrender

The birth of Galatia, PÃ©rgamus will pay
We will be back!
And we will take revenge

After many battles we made our way to the North
Anatolia was our path and Kizil's river our home
But my brothers were too strong to give up and lose hope
We will fight in Ankara's name to take down The City of Rome
One night they came to kill us all and declared the Galatian War
Swords stained with our people's blood
Deiotarus, you won't get that far

The rage of Galatians, Caesar, come and fight!
Now we are back!
Together we stand
