He has mighty horns and he's wearing torcs, he is The Horned God
Fertility and renaissance surrounded by the wild
Lord of beasts, his orange seals are used for hunting needs
The Mater Dei caress his life and creates what he protects

He was born at the Pilier des Nautes,
embracing earth 'til he dies
With the autumn laves, he close his eyes
And then he awakes when Ymbolg ends

...And we shall protect and guard by the sign of The Horned God
This is our fight, together we stand
And don't forget, your place to live, our world to stay
The Oak woods screamed when he disappeared, the forest guard was gone
What will we do? We are still weak, exposed to human kind
The winter fell and devastated our homes and our lives
Frozen our breathe beneath his tears, we need our Hu Gadhan.

Living roots run through his soul and makes him become alive
He's back again but his sons are dead
Now it's too late, Cernunnos rage!
Cernunnos rage!
