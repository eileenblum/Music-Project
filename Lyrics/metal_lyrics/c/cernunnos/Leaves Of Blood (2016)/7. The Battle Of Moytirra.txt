Our king replaced by a tyrant man
Who was born with them and raised with us
A satire of doom has been recited
To curse the quisling for treating us like his god
A new fate is about to come...

Darkness fell down from sky (darkness)
Desiring to grab our lore (desiring)

The almighty rised and joined the court
Blessed by skills and brilliant soul
Mages and craftsmen, now prepared
To face those creatures and prevail

Balor, the one-eye king
Today ends your prophecy, Cath Maige Tuired.

Strength and bravery, ensure the victory

Banished for treason
Richness from now on
