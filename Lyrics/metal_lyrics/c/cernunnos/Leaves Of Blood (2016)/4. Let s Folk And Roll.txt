I walk alone this unlucky road
With my thirsty horse
Nowhere to sleep and nowhere to go
Just a bonfire in the unknown

A Smokestack from the distance caught my attention
I ride as fast as I can
The bandits attacked my trying to stop me
So I cut off their heads

When I reached that house
They were singing a song,
A song of folk 'n roll...
(Let's folk 'n roll!)
With mead in my hand and a sword on my back
(Let's folk 'n roll!)
Here is where I'll stay
(Let's folk 'n roll!)
Whistles and Violins sing with guitars
Let's folk and, folk and roll!

No one can be sad
With good melodies,
Tales of you and me
(Let's folk 'n roll!)
With mead in my hand and a sword on my back
(Let's folk 'n roll!)
Here is where I'll stay
(Let's folk 'n roll!)
Whistles and Violins sing with guitars
Let's folk and, folk and roll!
