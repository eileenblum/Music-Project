He is not someone common and,
Skin isn't red as in your dreams
He wants you to convey his greed
Exchange for your soul

He doesn't care about your destiny
Don't try to fool him, it's in vain

He needed to know, what happened to him
He felt strange, but now he returned
He was longing to be someone
But now he came back and you'll testify

He will turn into a friend
Thirsty for revenge
And grant you eternal life
To destroy you from inside

He's the god from the seas
Since was killed by Gofannon
Seas are calling through the waves
For the Dylan's lost Soul.

[Solo]

He was Dylan, a lucky man
And he thought he would live forever
He was wrong, he was searching for the eternal happiness
But not anymore...
Now, he wanders every night, every time
Searching the only to blame for this
And to stop being Dylan, the lost soul.

He will turn into a friend
Thirsty for revenge
And grant you eternal life
To destroy you from inside

He's the god from the seas
Since was killed by Gofannon
Seas are calling through the waves
For the Dylan's lost Soul.

He will turn into a friend
Thirsty for revenge
And grant you eternal life
To destroy you from inside

On winter, he will be
Your shelter, your home
Then in him you will trust
And your wit will betray
