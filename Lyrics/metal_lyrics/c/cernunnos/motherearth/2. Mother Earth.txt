Mother earth is crying again, she cannot carry on
She's abused every time, what are you waiting for?
The oceans are about to die, mountains and forests too
If we join our forces now, perhaps we could be part of the new world.

The sky spits venomous clouds, And this is just the beginning.

You are full of waste and also full of pain
The Human cannot see that, the Human doesn't care
When you cut down a tree, you're cutting down your legs
It would be better if we realize what matters and what does not.

You are full of waste and also full of pain
The Human cannot see that, the Human doesn't care
When she was young, she was beautiful, rich... Even now.
The difference is that their children are slowly consuming its purity.

The Horned God will spread his wrath, he'll come to take revenge
He'll take advantage of our need and also our dreams
Since the human has possessed all the natural wealth
This has became a complete fool, he doesn't know how much needs her to live.

The sea is hiding from us, please don't suffer anymore.

You are full of waste and also full of pain
The Human cannot see that, the Human doesn't care
When you look around, you find destruction
When you look at the mirror, you find the guilty.

Death, chaos, corruption and injustice
All united in one thing... The man.

When we look around, we try to realize
This cannot be real... When will the slaughter end?
Destiny is in our hands
We have to take care from the arms of death.
