I will tell you all the things that you don't want to hear
But they're bringing you down
Drug addiction, no restriction ever gets you past
The taste of dying

One man stands alone
Weak and frail
Gaze into his eyes
Never fail

Turn the never-ending wheel that surely seals your fate
Can't you feel it coming?
Downward spiral case of misconception aggravates
As you feel it endlessly

One man stands alone
Weak and frail
Gaze into his eyes
Never fail
