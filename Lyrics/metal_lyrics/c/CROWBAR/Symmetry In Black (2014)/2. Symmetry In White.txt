Unobscured
Symmetry in white
Offering mercy
Absolution for the damned

As she said in a vision of Hell
A conversion of life
Bringing sanctuary
Apparition of flames
The embracing of dusk
Incandescent embers

Amidst the pain
And infernal despair
Shadows of souls
Transparency glows
With remorseful darkness

As she said in a vision of Hell
Bringing sanctuary
Apparition of flames
The embracing of dusk
Incandescent embers

Spiritual holocaust
A prescription for war
With infinite lust
The injection of filth
Impervious dreams of symmetry in white

As she said in a vision of Hell
Bringing sanctuary
Apparition of flames
The embracing of dusk
Incandescent embers
