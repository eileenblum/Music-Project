Look up at me
You're crawling
On dirty ground you prowl
Lift up your head
And see me
Your antidote is now

Open up your mind
Time to realize

Now save your energy and use it well
It's not too hard to see
What's real

Look up at me
You're drowning
So far below
Beneath
The answer that eludes you is echoing so deep

Open up your mind
Time to realize

Now keep your energy and use it well
It's not too hard to see
That time will tell
I'm the creator of all your dreams
I am the shaman of belief
