Don't give me
Don't give me sympathy
I'm still alive
Alive and whole

Rise above, hear me breathe
Paramount, what I see

My vision, a vision truly bleak
Unholy world, a godless world

There's nothing I can do
That changes what is true

I'm looking straight into the future
Right into its eyes
And what I'm looking at is evil
Mournful souls and cries

Rise above, hear me breathe
Paramount, what I see

I'm looking straight into the future
Right into its eyes
And what I'm looking at is evil
Mournful souls and cries
