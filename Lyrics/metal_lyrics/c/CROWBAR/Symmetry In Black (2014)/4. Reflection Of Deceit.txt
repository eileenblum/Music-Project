The taste of immortality
Come and put your faith in me
The offering of destiny
The mirror of lies

The crowning of hypocrisy
A pawn in my masterpiece
Drowning in my entity
Immersed in disguise

Illusive giver, patron of reprise
Reject the thought of losing what is mine

Ascend above your own demise
Perception now accepted
Oblique deception always lies
Your penance is denied

Renouncing of the pageantry
Shatter the humility
Exposing of your destiny
The mirror of lies

Illusive giver, patron of reprise
Reject the thought of losing what is mine

Accept my spirit
Come and see
My eyes wide open
Endlessly

Ascend above your own demise
Perception now accepted
Oblique deception always lies
Your penance is denied
