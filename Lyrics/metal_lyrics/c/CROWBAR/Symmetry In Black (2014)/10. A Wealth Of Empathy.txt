I can't explain my suffering
But I have lived through misery

My faith will pull me through
And bring to me new life
No need for sympathy
I've overcome

My strife, no longer feeling cold
The mind grows wise as we grow old

My faith will pull me through
And bring to me new life
No need for sympathy
I've overcome my strife

The man I used to be
A shadow of me now
The wealth empathy will let me show you how

The passing on of those I've loved
Eternally I'm thinking of

My faith will pull me through
And bring to me new life
No need for sympathy
I've overcome
