Radiation and gravity
For centuries now they have been haunting me

And when they're near, I feel it
I'm lost in fear, I can't quit now

Symbolic suicide
I feel the need to tranquillize
I dream then watch you
Burn in agony

I'm praying for Heaven
While living through Hell
A story of pain
That only I can tell

And when they're near, I feel it
I'm lost in fear, I can't quit now
I won't quit now
I can't quit

Symbolic suicide
I feel the need to tranquillze
I dream then watch you burn
Symbolic suicide
I dream then watch you

Don't do as I, just hear my words
Don't live as I, my lesson's learned
