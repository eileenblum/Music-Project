Ancestral malignance
Repulsive revolt
Absorbing the life
To gain self-control
Saturating humanity
With deceptive design habitually

The procreation continues
With its veil of disguise
Sustaining the burden
Of those in its eyes

Blood in my eyes

Ancestral malignance
Repulsive revolt
Absorbing the life
To gain self-control

The procreation continues
With its veil of disguise
Sustaining the burden
Of those in its eyes

Resist its affliction
Let divinity descend
An epiphany of spirit prevails in the end

The ageless decay
The ageless decay

The procreation continues
With its veil of disguise
Sustaining the burden
Of those in its eyes

Resist its affliction
Let divinity descend
An epiphany of spirit prevails in the end
