So many years, so many words
Bringing honesty to you

Just follow me
You won't regret
It's what I do
I don't forget

I'll lead you to the truth

Know I'm not the enemy
I can teach the blind to see

Too many tears, too many wounds
Bringing healing to the ill

Just follow me
You won't regress
I'm giving life, I'm giving breath

At times it's hard, at times I'm blind
But I bring new life to you

And in the end
That's what is real
'Cause agony will make you feel

Into freedom I lead you

Know I'm not the enemy
I can teach the blind to see

Just believe and follow me
This becomes your legacy

Know I'm not the enemy
I can teach the blind to see
