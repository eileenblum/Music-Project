My will cannot be broken
'Cause when I rot I crawl back from the dead
I am the living proof
That you can right what is wrong in your head

The weak can always overcome
But only if they burn with desire
And all the tears a man can cry
They will not put out the fire

Walk with knowledge wisely
You don't have to die
Put an end to what poisons you

My heart might have been broken
That will only fuel what grows in my mind
I am the living proof
That a soul can burn a thousand times

Accept what God has given you
And you'll find the answer all around
Rise from the ashes
And be heard with a deafening sound

Walk with knowledge wisely
You don't have to die
Put an end to what poisons you

Walk with knowledge wisely and be free
