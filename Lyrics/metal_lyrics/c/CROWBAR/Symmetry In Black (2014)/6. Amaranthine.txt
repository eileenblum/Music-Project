Promise me you'll be there when I die
Give me peace before I close my eyes

Cleansing a forgotten soul
Comfort from the bitter cold

Just take my hand and guide me through the dark
Learn to trust when trust was never real
Far beyond the things I used to feel

Black mist turns into light
Never fading into night

Just take my hand

I'll never walk alone
I'll never walk alone
I'll never walk alone
