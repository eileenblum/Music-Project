Itâs beautiful - so far beyond real
Colliding worlds - regaining my feel
Beneath myself - the answers I hold
My inner strength begins to unfold

Holding something -
Never lose my grip

This war Iâve waged is so far from thru -
For decades now - Itâs all I can do
Iâve learned to live and how to survive
- undying will that keeps me alive
