Iâve felt lost before
I donât want you suffering anymore
But it canât feel right using day and night
And I hope that youâll soon find your way

The walls are closing in on you
Your world is coming down on you
Going down - the walls are closing in on you
Now watch your whole world pass by you

How much time is left before youâre not craving it anymore
Still the smell comes thru - itâs killing you
That disease youâve got wonât wash away

The walls are closing in on you
Your world is coming down on you
Going down - the walls are closing in on you
Now watch your whole world pass by you
Coming down
... told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
