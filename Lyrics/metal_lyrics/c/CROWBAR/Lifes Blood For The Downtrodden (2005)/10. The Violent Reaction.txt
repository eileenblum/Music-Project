The eyes of God are looking down
His tears - they flood the earth
Realityâs an awful truth - as mankind self destructs

The violent reaction - the ever growing fear

The gravity it pulls us down
An unrelenting force

A lesson learned in ignorance
A wasteland of broken bones

The violent reaction - a mess of human debris
The loss of direction
The evergrowing fear

The eyes of God are looking down
His tears - they flood the earth

The eyes of God
