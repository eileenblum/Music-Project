I still hear your voice calling my name
I still see you smile
Childhood memories never will fade
At last now youâre free

And youâve finally gone home
Youâre home

I hope you can see all of my pain
My tears burn my eyes
I pray that you feel all of my love
At last now youâre free

This loss leaves me cold - hollow inside
In time weâll embrace
At last now youâre home
