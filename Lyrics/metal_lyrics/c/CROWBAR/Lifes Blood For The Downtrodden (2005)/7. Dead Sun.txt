Releasing the hatred of enemies - lost friends
You give me a smile for some sympathy
I canât hide it now
A tribute to manâs doubt in loyalty - itâs long gone
You talk about honor then spit on me
I wonât hold it

Cold, dead, sun I feel
Love for you is gone

The deep ugly scars that youâve given me
- they wonât die -
The need to forgive is haunting me
I must give in
