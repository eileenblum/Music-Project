Fall back to zero - come back to life

You canât hold me down
You canât hold me down

That light ahead has always shown the way
That voice above is why Iâm here today

Take all my sorrow - leave all my love
You canât hold me down
You canât hold me down

That light ahead has always shown the way
That voice above is why Iâm here today

A better life has grown from all the pain
A stronger mind is what I long to gain
