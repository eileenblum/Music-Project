Iâm at the point where I can do what I feel
But I canât break away - these things are still real
I recreate as I hold on
Re-animate as I burn long

Into my eyes - come take a long hard look
Thereâs no disguising it - Iâve known what it took
I recreate as I hold on
Re-animate as I burn long

New dawn brings me all I need
New dawn gives me all
