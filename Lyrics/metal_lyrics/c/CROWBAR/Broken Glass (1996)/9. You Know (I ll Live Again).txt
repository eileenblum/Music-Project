I chose the long hard path
I'm wandering
In self-denial for so long I bled
To find the truth in all I say and do
My darkest hour
I'm upon the suicide wall

Still I condemn myself
Look for the answer now
All I've denied myself
Kill me
In the end you know I'll live again

Remember all those things that passed me by
In looking back thru hate I lost my way
I've fallen low before but now I'm there
Just give me strength to overcome my fear
