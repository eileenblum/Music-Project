Twisting All That I'm saying and doing 
Abandonment
Burning even in pleasure
I'm burning
Melting away
Impact
Taking the impact
Look back
Take time to look back
Die in my own way

Conquering
In time I'm conquering

Growing
The urging and needing are growing
Rotting in me
Over
It's happening over and over
Die in my own way
