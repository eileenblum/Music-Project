Eating away at my body and soul
So tired of all that you've taken
I've always known that I'd be on my own
Not knowing how hard I'd fallen

In your arms
(Destroying all I ever wanted)
Now it's gone
(Losing all I ever needed)
Been so long
(Destroying all I ever wanted)
It's all gone
(You've taken all I ever needed)

Believed in all I'd ever known
Left me to die here on my own
You took it all and left me
You took it all and left me (nothing)

If I survive long enough to come back
Won't you forgive me for falling?
