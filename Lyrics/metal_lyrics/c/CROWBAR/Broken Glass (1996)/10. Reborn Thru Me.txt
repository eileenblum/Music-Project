Sunken eyes
Look of death upon me
Feeling cold
Feeling tired and empty
Still I long
Can't find what I'm after
I can't sleep
Slowly die in my own world

Learn thru me
I've done it all before
Learn thru me
I've done it all

Feel the strain
Veins are lined with poison
Laid to waste
In my time of dying
