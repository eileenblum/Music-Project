Looking at me smothering you
Destroying all
Looking at me punishing you
Destroying it
Pushing you down
Pulling you down
I'm crushing all
Pushing you down
Pulling you down
I'm dragging you under

Your time is coming sooner than you will ever know
How does it feel to be so far below?

I know you never thought that I would rise again
Just know I'm stronger than you'll ever be
