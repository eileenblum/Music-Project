Suffer smothering engulfed uncovering
I've got to break away
Left me all alone pushed me until I explode
I've got to find a way
Thought I could count on you
My faith will pull me through again
Feel myself burning from the inside
Finally realized no more compromise
Now I can break away
Listen I'm telling you find out your inner truth
And you can break away
Suffer smothering no more uncovering
