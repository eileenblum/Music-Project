I saw your future
Die in your hands
Glass full of liquid pain
Understand
Don't you buy everything
They try to sell you?
I've gone there again and again.
Find yourself gazing into the sun
New age of quarrel becoming one
Just know the light you see
Leads to eternity
I've gone there
Again and again
Just know the light
You see leads to eternity
I'll be there again and again
