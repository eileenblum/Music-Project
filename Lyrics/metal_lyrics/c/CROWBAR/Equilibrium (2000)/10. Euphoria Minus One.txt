War it's been a long time coming from the underground
Blood I've got to fuel my fire
With the strength I've found stay strong
Take in all I tell you do the things that I do
And pray to god you'll make it
Cuz there is a hard world waiting for your crumbling
Blood you've got to sacrifice to end the suffering pray hard
Sacrifice Sacrifice Sacrifice Sacrifice!
