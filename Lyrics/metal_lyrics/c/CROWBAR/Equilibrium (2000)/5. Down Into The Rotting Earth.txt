Push me back down
Into the rotting earth
Too many years
To find what life is worth
Do it now pray
For me I taste the dirt
Pray for me do it now
Release my soul
Into the atmosphere
Come quench my thirst
Extinguish all my fears
Do it now
The truth burns I taste the dirt
Pray for me do it
Now deep down
Rain pour down.
