Again and again
You can try me I won't break
Again and again
You can try me, you can't take
You were fucking my mind
As you drove me down
Fucking my mind
As you drove me down
I said stay with me
I said stay with me
But those are things you can't understand
Setting me free
Was the best thing you gave me
Setting me free
Was the best thing you gave me
You were fucking my mind
As you drove me down
Fucking my mind
As you drove me down
