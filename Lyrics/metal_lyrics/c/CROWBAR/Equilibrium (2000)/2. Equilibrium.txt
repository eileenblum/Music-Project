I've been frozen
By all you said
Broken body and burning head
All I've known left me torn
Been reborn
You continue
To crush yourself
Weak and hungry you cry for help
Time is not healing your inner wounds
Growth by anger
Is not the rules.
All you've known gone away
Not reborn - never
Power leading me
