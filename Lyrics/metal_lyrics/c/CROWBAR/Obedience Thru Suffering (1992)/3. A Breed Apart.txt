These thoughts in my head
To you my thoughts mean nothing
Empty is your world
Existing is your crime
Your Ignorance alone is enough to make me hate you
Pathetic
Helpless fool
Your life ain't worth a dime

Take a good hard look
We're a breed apart

Your blinded from the truth
Your life is an illusion
You're hanging by a thread and threatening to fall
Just leave me alone
I'm better off without you
I laugh at you fool
You and your empty mind

I am straining
I am paining
Hit me
Hit me
I won't feel it
All is hollow
Growing sorrow
Stop my madness
We're a breed apart
