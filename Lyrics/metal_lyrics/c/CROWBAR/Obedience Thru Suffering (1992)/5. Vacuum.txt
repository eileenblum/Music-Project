Restrained by fear cannot face the world
No fall from grace
No smiling face only swollen fists
Focused on rage
These walls of pain closing in on me
Crushed by the weight
Love left behind I feel nothingness
Anger inflates

Indignation fills my every thought
Feel I can't cope
This house of glass I am trapped inside
Begging for stones
No black or whites I see only grey
This cycle turns
I see the end but cannot reach
My world it burns

Take me
Feel my pain
Feel me
Take my pain
