I'm trapped in darkness
Life is no more
Unending pain and agony
Waiting in Silence cold and alone
Must I live out death endlessly?

Take my sanity
Take it from me
Let me live to die again

I see myself through eyes of the past
They give me life eternally
Dreams of the living keep me alive
They are my blood
They set me free
