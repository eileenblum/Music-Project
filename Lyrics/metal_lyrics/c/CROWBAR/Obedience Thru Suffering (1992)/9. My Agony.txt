Look at me now
Stare into my eyes
Deep into my soul
The pain I feel
It's stronger than life
It's taken control
My mind is gone
I'm dying inside
I'm falling apart
In agony
I see no way out
The pain's in my heart

It's killing me
God take it away
I just can't go on
I'm suffering
I pray for the end
It's lasting too long
