Reaching for the surface
I cannot feel it
My lungs they feel like bursting
Stop the pain
Conscious thoughts are fading
Fading quickly
Feed my fear of drowning
Darkness comes
Walking in cold sweat
Pulse is racing
Staring at the ceiling
Breathing fast
This nightmare keeps repeating
Becoming clearer
I'm finally realizing my end is near
