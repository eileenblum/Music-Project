Following your head might be a long, long road to nowhere
Don't dwell on the past
You've got to find the strength to lead you

Hear my words now
Suffer with me
Drown in despair
Set yourself free

Underneath your skin is there enough to keep you breathing?
I drew my own blood another life through this transfusion

Born again in time you're not alone in what you're feeling
