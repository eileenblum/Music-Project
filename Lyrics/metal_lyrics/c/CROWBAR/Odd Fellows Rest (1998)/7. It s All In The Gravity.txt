Cradle your head to lessen the blow
On the horizon's where the answer lies
My soul is hungry to feel the energy
I get my power from the gravity

Lasting image is frozen in time
I see the sky and live another day
Unending journey fueled by the energy
I feel the pressure suffocating me

Find the answer

Just know the truth lies in the gravity
