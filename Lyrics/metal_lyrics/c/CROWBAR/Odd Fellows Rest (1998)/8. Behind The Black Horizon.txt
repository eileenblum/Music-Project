Believed, believed in all you told me
The need, the need to grow it holds me
Below, below my spirit's twisting
The truth, I found the truth was missing

Bring it down
Bring it down

Somehow, somehow I know I'll find it
To hide, I'd never hide behind it
My faith, sometimes I feel it sliding
The sun, behind the black horizon

Bring it down
Bring it down
