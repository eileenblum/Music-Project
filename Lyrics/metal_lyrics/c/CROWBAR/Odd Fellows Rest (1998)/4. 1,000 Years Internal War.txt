Reborn I drain from inside
Cleanse me now sever the ties
All gone dissolved from my life
Uprise pray for your demise
Your demise

Carry me home
To where I want to be
Please take me home

Before this internal war
I had no use to abhor
My hand will lead me from here
Burning for 1000 years

All these years

Internal war
Internal war
