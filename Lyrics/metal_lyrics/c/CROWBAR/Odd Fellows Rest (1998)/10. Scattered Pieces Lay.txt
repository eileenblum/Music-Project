Broken dreams scattered pieces lay
Pulling the plug wash the life away
Underneath far into my soul
Grinding teeth throw the dirt into the hole

I walk into the light now into it

Eulogy left me feeling cold
Burning me burning mind explodes

Torn apart life drawn from my soul
Bury me throw the dirt into the hole

Love all is gone away
