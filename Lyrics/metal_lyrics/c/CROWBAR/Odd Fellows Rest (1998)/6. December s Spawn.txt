You're december's spawn
Agony you hold within you
Since the dawn of time
You're compelled to do what you do
Broken skin so dry
Burning lungs, I breathe so slowly
I can't see the sun
I can't see it, feel it

Gone from heaven to hell
And it's oh so cold
Raining darkness and pain

Bastard child be gone
Bring me warmth and light one more time

I can't see the sun
I can't see it, feel it
