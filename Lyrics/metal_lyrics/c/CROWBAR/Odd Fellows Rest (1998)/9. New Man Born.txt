My way right way
Dark haze long daze

Feel it pulling me
Thru life thru pain
Condemned
I burn for this hell on earth

Saw it coming for a long time
Saw it coming for a long time
Now I've given you
Now I've given you all you could ever need

I've given you all you could ever need

Been crushed been fucked
Been used
New man born from all of this
Saw it coming for a long time
Saw it coming for a long time
