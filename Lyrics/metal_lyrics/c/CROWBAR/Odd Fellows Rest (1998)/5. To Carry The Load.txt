Under that smile, behind those eyes I see it all
Your words breed lies, you cry for sympathy
Sometimes the truth unleashes more than you can take
Lost world, lost hope, lost vision, killing you

Don't kill before it grows

Throughout this all, you've learned a lot from me still it grows
That weight you bear is destined to crush your everything
Through time through pain my yearning has never ever wanned
Be strong, believe, the beauty it lies within your dreams
