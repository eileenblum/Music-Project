New life brings me home, silence carries on, tasting a new dawn, old life now gone, burning my eyes, feeling cold, losing touch while growing old, weakness dulls the mind, focus draws the line, never lose control, blindness tears the soul, burning my eyes, feeling cold, losing touch while growing old, opening my heart I feel, breathing new life, as I heal, breathing new life into me, creating a new entity, prodigious are these happenings, your self control is everything, creating a new entity, a brand new entity.
