With a tear of misfortune, bleeding through my stare, gazing at people,&amp; nobody's there I feel the serenity, to stop the battle I'm in, I give you my last breath, to feel peace from within...lacerations cover you, plasmic and pure, transmigration, opens the door 
My emotions are flowing, and the truth will be mine, a soul that needs cleansing, leaves darkness behind, a new life is growing, it's stronger than you, your negative action, will bleed through and through... lacerations cover you, plasmic and pure,
Transmigration, opens the door, disembodied spirit, plasmic and pure, true immortality, plasmic and pure, lacerations cover you, plasmic and pure transmigration, it's plasmic and pure.
