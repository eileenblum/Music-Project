Reach deep into my soul, does the pain ever go away, does it really go away, it's a lesson we must learn, and desire will still burn, breathe, wisdom that you have earned, are you able to make it stay, evil that you see, will it let you breathe, it's a lesson we must learn,
And desire will still burn, breathe
