My darkest hours of time, I'm staring at lost souls, my heart is filled with sorrow, it's bleeding and so cold, dying while living, in a life of last rites,
Falling while rising, I've grown too tired to fight, so many lives, have turned to dust, embrace my death, my will I trust 
A path for the weary, I've traveled far too long, I'm begging for water, in a world I don't belong, most of my years, I've held on to my pain I've felt but been
Numb, I have no more to gain so many lives, have turned to dust, embrace my death, my will I trust I'm falling while rising
