The winds are blowing, the song of the dunes, gravity, the haunting sounds we hear, eternal, energy, sonically, the desert sands sing on, between the surface, a resonating hum, avalanche, the haunting song we hear, eternal, energy, sonically, the desert sand sings on, sings on, sing on, sing on, sing on.
