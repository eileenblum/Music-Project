I'm soul searching, and all alone, heart breaking, turning to stone, I can't see that ray of light, embracing eternal night, hearing your voice once more, that
Would be my dream.touching your hand again, just one more time, I'm left reaching, and now you're gone, hands shaking, I'll carry on, hearing your voice once more, that would be my dream, touching your hand again, just one more time, I will carry on, I will carry, seeing your face again, just once more.
