They're calling me, hoping to end my sorrow, eternal glow, crawling back once more, and the world you thought was yours, is another place, and
The man you thought you knew, has another face, the answer lies, so far away, just look behind, and all is clear, and the world you thought was yours, is another place, and the man you thought you knew, has another face, bow to the alter, on holy ground. bow to the alter.
