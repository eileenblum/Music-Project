I've seen what you've done, you're pulling yourself down, don't trust in the dark, sadness all around, believe in the light, it's the only way, so open your heart, let the answer
Stay, the serpent only lies, there's blackness in his eyes, unearthly temper falls, the second coming calls, it's day after day, the fight to rise and win, conquer it all, it's day after day, the fight to rise and win, conquer it all, don't let your soul descend, the strong
And the weak, know which path to take, no room for the meek, your demons you must break, the serpent only lies, there's blackness in his eyes, unearthly temper falls, the second coming calls.
