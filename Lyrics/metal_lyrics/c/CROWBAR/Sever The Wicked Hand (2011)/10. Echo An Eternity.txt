I pray for you when I lay down
Fought back my tears without a sound
I hope you know just what you mean to me
You bring me light just like the sun
You give this light to everyone
Just realize how much you strengthen me

Innocence
Beauty and innocence
Make me whole
The ray of light

Fuck this dying world!
Fuck this dying world!

In times of need you set me free
Though miles away you're there for me
So wonderful
So wise beyond your years

Innocence
Beauty and innocence
Make me whole
The ray of light

Fuck this dying world!

Please help save this dying world!
