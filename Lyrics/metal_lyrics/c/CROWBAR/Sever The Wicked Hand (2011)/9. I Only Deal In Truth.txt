So you've been judging me
You need to feel my pain first
You may not understand
Just what it means to feel cursed

I never lost my faith
Although at times my hurt showed
But now the past is done
And I'm about to explode

I need to bury this!
Leave it buried alive!
I need to bury this!

The time is growing near
For you to bow down to me
I only deal in truth
Because the blinded can't see

So who are you to judge?
You will remember my words
And when you're proven wrong
It will be my voice that's heard

I need to bury this!
Leave it buried alive!
I need to bury this!
Those who see me are blind!

I only deal in truth
I only deal in truth

Those who see me are blind!
