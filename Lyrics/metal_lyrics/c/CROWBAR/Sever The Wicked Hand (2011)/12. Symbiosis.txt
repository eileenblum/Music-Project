A distant lonely night
I lie awake
I don't know where I am
Just know I'm safe
All that I love at home
So far away
Tomorrow brings new light
Another day

You hold me up in times of weakness
And in return I set you free
My heart I give to all of you
Now part of you belongs to me

And after all these years
This dream is real
I never lost my will
It's strength I feel
Don't ever lose desire
Or you will fade
I stand behind myself
And all I've made

You hold me up in times of weakness
And in return I set you free
My heart I give to all of you
Now part of you belongs to me

Fly on!
Fly on!
Fly on!

Now part of you belongs to me!

And through your eyes I look at you
I'm feeling what's inside of you
And every night you give me strength
For that I give my heart to you
