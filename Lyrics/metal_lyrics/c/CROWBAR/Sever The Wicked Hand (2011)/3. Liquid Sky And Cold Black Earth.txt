Liquid sky and cold black earth
Thank you for this new rebirth
Things are not what they should be
Broken soul has been set free

Will to live was sinking slow
I had fallen far below
Burning song did not exist
Emptiness and swollen fists

Through you I've been reborn
My world no longer torn!

Now the tears have dried and gone
Living for the golden dawn
Time's no longer standing still
Lost the pain and gained the will

Through you I've been reborn
My world no longer torn!

This darkness fades away
The light begins to stay!
