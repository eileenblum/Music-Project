Three days of detox
I'm sweating and scared
My head's spinning out of control
It's draining my will
And it's leaving me weak
It's taking my body and soul

I'm all alone
Fighting to live
Taking my all
There's nothing to give

Please God take my hand
And lead me through the dark times
I'm weak I know
Lead me with a clear mind
Don't let me go!

I answer to my own lies
My weakness shows
Slowly my disease dies
Don't let me go!

I'm seeing the light
But it's distant and dim
At least it is bringing me hope
Created this world I am struggling in
At last I am learning to cope

I'm all alone
Dying to live
It's taking my all
There's nothing to give

Please God take my hand
And lead me through the dark times
I'm weak I know
Lead me with a clear mind
Don't let me go

I answer to my own lies
My weakness shows
Slowly my disease dies
Don't let me go!

I'm gonna pull through!

Cleanse me
Heal me

Cleanse me
Save me

Lead me through the dark times
I'm weak I know
Lead me with a clear mind

Cleanse me
Heal me

Cleanse me
Save me

Cleanse me
Set me free!
