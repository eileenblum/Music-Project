Crawl back from the dead
Set me free at last
Forevermore
Taste the freedom
Now I can be one
Spirit rising up
Into the clouds
Ride the winds of change (change, change, change)

Hands of death letting me go

I'm reinventing the man that you all thought was gone

Crawl back into life
Death grip on my soul forevermore
Taste the new life
Now I've become one
I am rising up into the sky
Ride the winds of change (change, change, change)
Hands of death letting me go

I'm reinventing the man that you all thought was gone

Ride the winds of change!

Hands of death letting me go!

I'm reinventing the man that you all thought was gone!
