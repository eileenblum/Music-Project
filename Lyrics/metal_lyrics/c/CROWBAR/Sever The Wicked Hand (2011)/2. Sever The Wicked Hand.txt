You feel the mountain shaking
Your broken body aching
The suffering I give you
Is going to help you pull through

You'll never feel this way again
Just let it go and it will end

The thunder shakes your backbone
While healing you're not alone
These things will make you stronger
Depressing you no longer!

You'll never feel this way again
Just let it go and it will end

Never let it bring you down
Stay strong til' the bitter end!
Take control and never drown
Now you can touch the light!
