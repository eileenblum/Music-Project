I'm not alone
In times of sorrow
Through grace from God
I'll see tomorrow
Still standing strong

I built this shrine
With bones of those lost
They had a dream
But life was their cost

Leave me alive
Walking this earth
It's hard to lose this anger
Their names I curse

Why'd they choose a dark path?

They chose a dark path
Which leads to nothing good
They helped to build this shrine
Where once an ancient stood
Nothing stands there now but bones!

They're not alive
Not on this earth
I cannot lose this anger
Their names I curse

They chose a dark path...

The path that leads to nothing good... No!

And as I mourn this shrine
It's just their bones that stand there

Let me mourn!
