I gave to you all that you could ever need
And in return you gave me disrespect and greed
Now I've had wounds before
Not as deep as these
So now you crawl away on your hands and knees

You're never coming back
Never coming back

I'm choosing isolation
And turned to desperation

You gave yourself to me
That was another lie
And with each lie another part of me would die
To trust in you has proved to me I was a fool
Through suffering you learn
And now I make the rules

You're never coming back
Never coming back

I'm choosing isolation
And turned to desperation

I live by my mistakes
And learned all the hurt it takes
To overcome and grow
These things you need to know
