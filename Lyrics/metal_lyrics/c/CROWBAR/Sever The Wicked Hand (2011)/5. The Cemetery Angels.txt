You gave me wings
And took the sky away
Clawing and fighting to live another day
You seduced me and took away my mind
But now I control you
I'm leaving scars behind

And through the darkness and knowledge I've gained
Will carry me
Building the mountain again and again

They watch over me...

I've heard the lie
And lived the misery
Now I'm accepting the man that I can be
It takes the magic
That only brings you down
Sooner or later we all give in and drown

And through all the darkness and knowledge I've gained
Will carry me
Building the mountain again and again

Alone in this fight I believe in myself
It carries me
Building the mountain again and again

They watch over me...
They watch over me...

Bring it down!
