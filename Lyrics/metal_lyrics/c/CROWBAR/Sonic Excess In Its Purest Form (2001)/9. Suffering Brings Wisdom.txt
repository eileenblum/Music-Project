All that I loved
Forever gone below the earth
Centuries can't heal all my wounds or kill that hurt

These things make you become a man

Frozen in time my body aches with all I do
Fracturing bones, lashing at skin until I'm through

These things make you become a man

Let go of the love you lost
Suffering won't set you free
Knowledge comes from what you see and do
Just take the pain and grow and grow

Holes in my skull from which I bleed, I bleed for you
Fracturing bones, lashing at skin until I'm through
