You took the hard road this time
Now keep it clean
Look what indulgence cost you
Look where you've been
Still caged in isolation
Still counting days
Your mind was gone for so long
That blackened haze

Just know the world is going to give you nothing

Those years of innocence lost
The time is gone
Beneath the yearning hunger
Lies a new dawn
