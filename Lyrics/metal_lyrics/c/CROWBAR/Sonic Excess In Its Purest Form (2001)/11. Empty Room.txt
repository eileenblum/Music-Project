I've tried to hide
Hide from so many things
At times I've lied to myself

I've built a room
I can't see anything
An empty room

I'm breaking out

There is no door
No sunlight coming in
Just concrete walls and loneliness

Footsteps of doom
I hear alone at night
This empty room

I'm breaking out

Now I'm on my way
