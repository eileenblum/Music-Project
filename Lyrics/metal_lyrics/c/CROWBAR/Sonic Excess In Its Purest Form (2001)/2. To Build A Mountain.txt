Don't be the slave
Don't let your weakness show
To build a mountain takes a long, long time
Use what you've learned like a catapult
And load the cannon when you need to fire

I know the way you feel
It's time to take the step

Don't walk away
Don't let your weakness show
It's such a journey to the promised land
When you arrive learn to take control
And do your living by your own command
