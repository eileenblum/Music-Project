Behind this fear new life awaits
In awe you stand to break the stone that's crushing you
You taste it now

I've seen you drown
Thru the ashes I've watched you burn

You hate that smell
You love the high that it brings to you
Now walk that line and learn the way to end it all

your backbone is shaking the pounding and aching are real
It drives you back down into the blackness
The cold ugly blackness you feel
it's all coming unglued
