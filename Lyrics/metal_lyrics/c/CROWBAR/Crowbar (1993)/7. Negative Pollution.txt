Burn by love I taste the memories
I lick my wounds with pride
Count my days and nights in misery
Fueled by this rage inside
I can't look back
Can't look back

Nothing you could ever say to me
Could drain this swollen mind
Driving nails into my hands and feet
You left me crucified
I can't look back
Can't look back
