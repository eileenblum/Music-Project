I'll never lose the scars you gave
No longer can I live in peace
I'll carry anguish to the grave
Frustration that I can't release

Self-Inflicted
Self-Inflicted

To see you smile it cuts me deep
Knowing that you're no longer here
I see you dying as I sleep
Wish I could leave it all:

Self-Inflicted
Self-Inflicted
All my pain is
All this pain is
Self-Inflicted
Self-Inflicted
