Rule me no more
I control my mind
I will not give myself to you again
Weakness is pain
Your strength is twisting me
I've never felt so helpless and alone

I have failed [x3]
I have fuckin' failed

Nowhere to turn
There's growth in pain I feel it
I pray to God it's not too late for me
Hard to believe one man could lose so much
All that I've lost can never be conceived

I have failed [x3]
I have mother fuckin' failed
