Reign over you another day
Take all I can
Slave to me there's no other way
Break all I can
Come and taste me
Stay and praise me
Take all I can while I burn you down
Weak man
Weak man

You know you never will be free
Come for you time after time and again

Crawl with me

Give me what I need from you
Don't question why
On your knees in front of me
Weak man
Weak man
