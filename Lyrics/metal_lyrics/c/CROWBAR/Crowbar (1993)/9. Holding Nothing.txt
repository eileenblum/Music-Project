Holding nothing
Scratch the walls just to survive
You can't fathom what that's like
You can listen to you lies
In the end you'll do your time

Holding nothing
Staring at myself again
What I see would swallow you
In your eyes I'll always be nothing

Never did you understand
Never did you give respect
Never did you ever love
Never
Never
