Gone six long years
It's been so hard without you
Deep in my head
I feel the way that you do

Never can I forget you're gone
Never can I forget you're gone

I've been so scared
But I have grown so far
You took your life
You made it all so hard

Never can I forget you're gone
Never can I forget you're gone
