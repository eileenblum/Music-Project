Confess, throwing the lies away
I come clean
Hate myself for another day
I come clean
Bound and tied got to break through
Still I slave
Feel all that you can do for me
Still I crave
Letting it go
Promised myself
This time I've got to hold my head up

Down, sick, worn on my knees again
I let go
Hold me up watch my every move
Let me grow
Bound and tied got to break through
Still I slave
Feel all that you can do for me
Still I crave
