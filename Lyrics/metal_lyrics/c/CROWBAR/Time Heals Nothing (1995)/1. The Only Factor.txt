I want my share
of all that I've given to you
Take it, take it
Walk all over me
I'm putting that to an end
Right now
Think how you want
but I know I'm living the truth
Break it, break it
Get myself clean
and lose all this negative shit
I said

Never again, never again
Too hard

Giving myself the power
to make it all end
Take it, take it
Be my own man
stand up and never look back
Never
Through my suffering
indulging in all that I could
No lie
Keep myself clean
a fight that I know I can't quit
I said

I know that time will be
The only factor
