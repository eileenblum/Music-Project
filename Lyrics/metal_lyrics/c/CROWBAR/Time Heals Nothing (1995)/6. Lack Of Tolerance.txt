Take more than you give me
I can
taking it, after all these years
Close my mind to suffering
I will
Open my mind to all that's right

Making me
Making me hurt
Making me hurt so bad I feel it

No tolerance
No tolerance

Overcome this hatred
I can
Doing it after all these years
I see myself growing
I will
Knowing the man that I can be
