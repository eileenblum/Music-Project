My time to think
All that I need
My time to think
Never again - found my calling
Never again

It will not pull me down

Flesh over bone
Cut and bleeding
My frozen will
Never again - purge on my blood
Never again

I feel it all
Nomb to nothing - feel it all
Stand in my own
Cut and bleeding
I feel it all
