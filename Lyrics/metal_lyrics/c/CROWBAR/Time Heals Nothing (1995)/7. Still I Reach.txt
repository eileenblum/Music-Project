Lie here in a tortured world
So much I see
All the pain of a broken man
Still I believe
The truth never gets away
And so I reach
Want the answer to make it right
And so I seek

Isolated inside these walls
I do my time
Solitude is my enemy
I stay confined
Had to learn how to live again
Now it's complete
Found the answer to make it right
All I need
