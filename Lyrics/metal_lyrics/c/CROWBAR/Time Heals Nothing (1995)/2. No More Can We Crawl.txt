You'll never know, you'll never know
Know what it all means
Still I believe, always believe
I know that I've done right
You make it so hard, you make it so hard
You make it all so hard
Look at yourself, stare at yourself
Now how can we not hate?
No more can we crawl

You weak men bleed ignorance
You weak men bleed

All of our lives we gave it all up
We gave it all up
Too many years, too many tears
And too many lies
Never look down, never look back
And through it all we stand
Seeing the truth, knowing the truth
I know that I've done right
No more can we crawl
