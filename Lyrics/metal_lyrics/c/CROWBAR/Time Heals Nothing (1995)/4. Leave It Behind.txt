Grown so tired of the burning inside
Rising above
Live confined time to leave it behind
Leave it behind
Brick by brick got to tear it all down
Bringing it down
Been so hard got to set myself free
Learn to be free

I'll be strong
Too far to turn back
I'll be strong

Day and night got to live with myself
Die with myself
Still I strive that is all I can do
All I can do
Brick by brick learn to tear it all down
Bringing it down
Live confined time to leave it behind
Leave it behind
