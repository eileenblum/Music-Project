You feed me all I think I need
You held my hand through all the pain
How come I can't let go of you
Nothing you do for me is real
Whenever I trust in you I lose

Ending it all right here
I can't take no more
Losing it all right here

Although I've tried since we last met
I wish that I had never seen
How good you make me feel I'm numb
Nothing you do for me is real
Whenever I trust in you I lose

Ending it all right here
I can't take no more
Losing it all right here
