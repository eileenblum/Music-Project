Long been down but never beend this low
Years of anguish finally start to show
I've seen so much in many years
With these broken hands
I've wiped the tears

God pray for me
Please take all that I'm offering
All that I have
I'm done

Through these eyes I saw a desperate man
Lost the grip I felt that I once had
I've seen so much in my many years
With these broken hands
I've wiped the tears

Learn from all this
Learn to be a man
Burn from all this
Burn my heart in my hand
