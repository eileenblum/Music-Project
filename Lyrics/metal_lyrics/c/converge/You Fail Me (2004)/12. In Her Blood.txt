you are nothing more than dying royalty
you are nothing more than a fading drama queen
your spelling errors in love letters just stole your crown
you are nothing more than late night fantasy
you are nothing more than a rehearsed tragedy
your spelling errors in love letters just killed your dream
just killed you
you are nothing more than a dim lit whore
you are nothing more than a crashing bore
in your blood paid
you chase a shadow that will fade out as pain
