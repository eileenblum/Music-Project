i keep paying
when you keep taking
please stop running
and just start living
me without you
i have learned to live without your light
that burned so bright
you are half the heart and half the will
hanging moon
haunting you
hanging moon
be my light in this world of darkness


Thanks to en_simon for sending track #10 lyrics.
