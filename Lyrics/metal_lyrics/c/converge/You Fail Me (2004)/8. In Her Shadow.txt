she is at the end chasing her own fading light
running from her shadow in the name of living
searched for worth in the lust of men
paid in blood in different beds
mistaking sex for true love
they never meant a thing
her addiction brought her a world
of coward boys and of cheater girls
looking for an easy way out of being ordinary
so she boarded their sinking ship
and crossed their red needle sea
drowning truth to live her lie
that she was ordinary
in her fading shadow
