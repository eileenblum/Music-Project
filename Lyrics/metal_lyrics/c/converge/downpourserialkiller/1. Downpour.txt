My faith runs thinner than water for every wish has a name and with every fear there is someone somewhere who loved before, who hoped before. Someone who cried ten thoasand oceans, and someone who bled out the evening in search of you, they carried hope thick in their visions, and they held you deep in their chest. You said this would be nimble and painless, I am sorry that's not what I have found. Devil stay away from me.
