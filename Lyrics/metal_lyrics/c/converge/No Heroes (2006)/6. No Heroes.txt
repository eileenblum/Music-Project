In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown
No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate
Hell hammer comes down
Onto their blade
Our world of widows
Needs to be saved
It's now or never
Victim or victory
Rebel or regret
Who you are and who you claim to be
No more heroes
No more
No more
In my world of enemies
I walk alone
