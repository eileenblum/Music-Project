From a victim to a friend
Don't ever let them in keep
Your scars on your sleeve and your heart in your hands
All the whores with their wars
Their gaping mouths want more
All of them choke on regret
We sit in silence
Dead or dedicated
Alive or medicated
A coward queen or harlot
Heart, it's up to you
This world owes you nothing
This world owes me nothing
This world owes us nothing but a hard road to walk
These mountains that we climb is everything they've lost
This world owes us nothing but a hard road to walk
These mountains that we move are everywhere we look
It's all up to me and you
