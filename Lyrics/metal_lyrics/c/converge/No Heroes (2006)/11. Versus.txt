It's us versus them
Jaws are biting at your heels
We hunt you in bad dreams
We know just what you are
The secrets that you keep
Cloven hoof is pounding faster than your heart
Strength in desperation and the sting of loss
Time to cut them down
It's us versus them
Time to take a stand
It's us versus them
