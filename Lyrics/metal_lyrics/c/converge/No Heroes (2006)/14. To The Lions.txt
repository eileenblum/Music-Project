To the lions
As she closes her doors to end this night
This raging sea won't have you
This weary grave won't keep you
These tired arms won't hold you
As she closes her doors to the lions
Inferno dreams won't leave you
This moonless night won't guide you
These brittle ghosts won't love you as she closes her doors
Queen of guilt
Queen of grief
Remember them (erase me)
