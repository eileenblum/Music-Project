When I see me in your eyes
I just want to go blind
When I build coffin worlds with words
I just want a place to hide
When old ghosts meet new regrets
My daylight fades to grey
When our days bring guilt and shame
My heart turns black
These are my tombs
Painted black and blue
These are my tombs
Painted just for you
Goodnight,
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye
Black rose,
Be my light in the darkest of days
Be my heart in the darkest of nights
Be my heart
