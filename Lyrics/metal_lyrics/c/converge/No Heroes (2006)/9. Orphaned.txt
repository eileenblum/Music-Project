Bright eyes
Fading young eyes
Beaten to black and blue
Sunrise has been sinking since I was two
One wounded and another dead
I've spent years building these walls
When all of this time my sky has been falling
Burden to bare this anger is empty but heavy
My heart carries the weight of your world
My wounds are open
I am out of blood
