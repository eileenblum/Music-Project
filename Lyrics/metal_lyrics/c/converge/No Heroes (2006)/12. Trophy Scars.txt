In pure ghost white I see what was mine
Drowned in jet black that haunts your shadows
Endless night begins
This forked road now bends
A forked tongue appears to lead us astray
All this that I have is all that you are
Cutting for love a new trophy scar
Just not worth the tears and penance not worth the blood that we both pour

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without your name
Without this pain
Born to burn with hell to pay
Born to burn with we will someday
