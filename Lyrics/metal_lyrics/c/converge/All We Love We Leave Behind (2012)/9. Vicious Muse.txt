what kind of vicious muse
broke the both of you?
why did your golden hearts
effortlessly bruise?
how did that waning spark
fade to black and blue?
(just) name the demons, overhead
the same names as old forgotten friends
to remind you that who you love
will cut your throats in the end
(just) name the demons, overhead
the same names as old forgotten friends
you see they will never leave
your blood soaked bed
how you will grieve will set you free
how you will grieve will set you free
what kind of vicious muse
broke the both of you?
why did your golden hearts
effortlessly bruise?
how did that waning spark
fade to black and blue?
a vicious muse
