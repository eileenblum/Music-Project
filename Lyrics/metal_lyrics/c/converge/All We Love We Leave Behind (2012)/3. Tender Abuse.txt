when you chose to hurt the honest ones
they scarred effortlessly
fading - felt but never seen
something lost and nothing gained
this damage still looks the same
darkness gets in the way
what i feel, i cannot say
when you chose to love all the wrong ones
i bruised beautifully
fading - felt but never seen
when you chose to hurt the honest ones
they scarred effortlessly
fading - felt but never seen
something lost and nothing gained
this damage still looks the same
darkness gets in the way
what i feel, i cannot say
it's my blood that's drowning me
my gift to you
sweet tender abuse
