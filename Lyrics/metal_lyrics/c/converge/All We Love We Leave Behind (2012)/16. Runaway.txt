stripped my heart of all it's parts
and gave away the scrap for free
sold your soul for some control
to gnaw at the hand that feeds
crying out to end the drought
yet it's not your blood that filled this sea
the mistakes left in your wake
they remind me of a younger me
parasites have come and gone
and this is your farewell song
parasites have come and gone
and this is your farewell song
run - run
stripped my heart of all it's parts
and gave away the scrap for free
sold your soul for some control
to gnaw at the hand that feeds
crying out to end the drought
yet it's not your blood that filled this sea
the mistakes left in your wake
they remind me of a younger me
parasites have come and gone
and this is your farewell song
parasites have come and gone
and this is your farewell song
run - run
run - run away
