i've found myself
running out of time
relating to those that
just stopped trying
clinging to those little things
and the light they bring
i bow down to you
extinguished youth
scavengers became
future romancers
and my angels carry
a predatory glow
i'm weaker by the way
no way to be saved
i bow down to you
extinguished youth
emptiness
drags me down
to the depths
with no sound
it's what i lack
that attracts (me)
to the jaws
of defeat
mend me
end me
mend me
end me
mend me
end me
mend me
end me
let the future know
i won't be there tomorrow
let the past know
i gave them my all
i'm aching for an end
grown thinner every day
i bow down to you
extinguished youth

THE END
