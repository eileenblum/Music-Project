swam out to sea
to try and be me
to drown those that
thought they could never sink
when in the deep
weakness is easy to read
coral blue grows in you
coral blue tells the truth
swam out to see
what karma would bring
it's jaws crashed down
on drowning bodies around me
when in the deep
weakness is easy to read
coral blue grows in you
coral blue tells the truth
when in the deep
weakness is easy to read
when in the deep
weakness is easy to read
when in the deep
weakness is easy to read
when in the deep
weakness is easy to read
when in the deep
weakness is easy to read
