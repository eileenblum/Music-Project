to live the life you want
you've abandoned those in need
a necessary casualty
or so you believe
your wake will always travel
and well up in the eyes
of those that you sacrificed
in order to survive
i'm that aimless arrow
lost from my very start
violence without purpose
born of broken hearts
no one will ever guide me
as i sail through the air
now i just bring sadness
in those who choose to care
i know the tears they're weeping
and the damage they will take
it's the curse of restlessness
and the weight of your mistakes
they are those that love you
and those that need you more
then the sense of gravity
banging down your door
i'm that aimless arrow
lost from my very start
violence without purpose
born of broken hearts
no one will ever guide me
as i sail through the air
now i just bring sadness
to those who choose to care
aimless arrow
aimless arrow
aimless arrow
lost from the start
