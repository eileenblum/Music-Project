sadness fills up our lungs
their flesh hangs on our broken horns
strays lay claim to shame in the way
a currency that once adorned
the blinding beauty of our world
strays lay claim to shame in the way
strays lay claim to shame in the way
alone we wander
our hunger guides us true
our footsteps shake your ground
so let blood flood this valley
carved from years of constant tears
it's the shadows that are leading me
from my youth to the tomb
it's the absence of a purpose
that turns me into you
head over heels with our wounds
yet we search for more to lose
shame in the way
strays lay claim to shame in the way
