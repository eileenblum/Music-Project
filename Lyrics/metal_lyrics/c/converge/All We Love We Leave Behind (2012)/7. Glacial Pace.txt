my love, wrap your hands around my heart
free me from the frost that enveloped my life
my love, reach out your arms and pull me close
let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
my love, wrap your hands around my heart
free me from the frost that enveloped my life
my love, reach out your arms and pull me close
let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
if being alive is just to survive
i'd choose to drown in the turbulent seas
if being alive is just to survive
a glacial pace comes to an end
it brings on the floods that are the truest of tests
a glacial pace comes to an end
let our love guide us through the torrents ahead
if being alive is just to survive
i'd sink within you for eternity
a glacial pace comes to an end
and it brings on the floods that are the truest of tests
a glacial pace comes to an end
let our love guide us through the torrents ahead
don't give up on me
my love, wrap your hands around my heart
free me from the frost that enveloped my life
my love, reach out your arms and pull me close
let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
a glacial pace
a glacial pace
a glacial pace
a glacial pace
