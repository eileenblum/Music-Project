see, i've grown to find the same old sun
erases shadows, devours light
we burn - we burn at both ends
fate has no compass fear has no driver
what a cruel world clarity brings
we burn - we burn at both ends
our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
some just gave up in the end
our faith was made for those who lost their own way
they just gave up in the end
nothing will bring peace
nothing will bring rest
and i've grown to find the same old sun
erases shadows, devours light
we burn - we burn at both ends
fate has no compass fear has no driver
what a cruel world clarity brings
we burn - we burn at both ends
our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
some just gave up in the end
our faith was made for those who lost their own way
they just gave up in the end
nothing will bring peace
nothing will bring rest
death and loss blossoms, within the wound
life and love writhing, writhing in you
a new day rise in me
burn at both ends
stayed up those nights to see
burn at both ends
what the future could mean
burn at both ends
stayed up those nights to see
burn at both ends
a new day rise in me
