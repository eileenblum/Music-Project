Down by your side I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arms across the bed
You make no move
You never do
Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage, own my scars
They paint a broken life's shattered art
And time won't turn my wretched world
(To stand in your shadow is to be home)


Thanks to poolews for correcting track #13 lyrics.
