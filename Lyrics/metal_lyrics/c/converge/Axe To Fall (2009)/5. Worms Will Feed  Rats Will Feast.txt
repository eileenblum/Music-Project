Saw you coming around my bend
Cutting teeth and breaking bread
Making moves and smearing friends
Your karma has been racking debts
Left your throne in foreclosed homes
Claimed that crown of decay
Built castle walls with blood and bone
To shield your soul from wither and decay
Worms will feed
Saw you slither around their necks
Sinking teeth into their flesh
Spitting venom seeing red
You will fall where you lay your head
Rats will feast
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
