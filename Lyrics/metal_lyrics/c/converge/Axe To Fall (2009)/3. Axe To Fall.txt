Waiting for the axe to fall
Sun is sinking clouds collecting
I'm in a race to stop the bleeding me
My will is leaving darkness falling
Need to finally cut me from you
I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this suicide machine
I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this destruction
I need to learn to love me
