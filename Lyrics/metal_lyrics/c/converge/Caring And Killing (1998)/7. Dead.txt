You never loved me. Now I cannot lie down in that bed, I cannot lie down in all of those old fears. I haven't slept, singe the colors from my glances. If I was bleeding would you tell me? If I was saying would you hear me? You asked for everything but never loved. If I was praying would you kill me? You never loved me. Dead.
