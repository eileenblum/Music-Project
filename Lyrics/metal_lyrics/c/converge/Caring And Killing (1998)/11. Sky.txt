The sky is falling around me. You choke in the saturated bliss. A sky so much bluer than mine. Strangulation of your warm soul. Your flesh weakens me. Joyless under the falling sky, your sky seems so much bluer. Buried in displeasure. I sink up through the sky rising into the grave in my mind. Fly your dove, kill your love. Bleed for me. A tear shed without sincerity. Open your heart and bleed for me I will never set your soul free. A fossil of you tempter, only flesh of what was. Ashes of your fallen dreams. I look into your eyes and I can't recognize you but your sky is so much bluer than mine.
