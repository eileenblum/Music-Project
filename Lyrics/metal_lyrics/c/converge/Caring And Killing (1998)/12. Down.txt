I could see the pain in your eyes. I wish I could prove this truth absolute. I want to heal you. It is me. I am sorry. Sister of mercy to free me, trace my past beyond what I see. Your God promised to save me. God forgot. Needle puncturing skin, tell the tales of where I have been. Please love, trace my soul never to let my memory go. Murder in every world, there has got to be someone who understands me. I was looking for myself. Asking everyone except myself the questions which I and only I could answer. Reflections in the skin, release the flowing stream. The agony we call living. The bloodletting I call me. I will never fall down
