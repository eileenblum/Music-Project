Can you help me? Take a picture before I paint over her. She is beautiful, she was everything. I miss her. Last night I dreamt of her tracing my scars. She said she'd never leave and that I'd always stay. That night you called I stood by that phone for hours, I felt everything thirty miles away. You said you loved me and I told you the same. We kissed there for the first time. I believed in you for the last time. I once was I, once was whole. Peacemaker, tell myself that this is time to say goodbye. Goodbye
