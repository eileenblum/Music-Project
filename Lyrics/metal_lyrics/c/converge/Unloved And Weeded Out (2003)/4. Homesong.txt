For words, two minutes, three years for my fingertips to grow numb
Could this be the moment when the "finally" becomes the "wish i could"?
Desperation and outstreched memories, now i see you onlin in the bad dreams
I never reset, i only see you in the bad dreams
Let me explain
Close enough to feel your words, far enough to read your flesh
