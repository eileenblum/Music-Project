My faith runs thinner than water
for every wish had a name and every heart had a fracture
With every fear there was someone, somwhere
who loved before, who hoped before
Someone who cried out ten thousand oceans 
and someone who bled out the evening in search of you
They carried hope thick in their visions
and they held you deep in their chests
You said this would be nimble and painless
I'm sorry, that's not what i have found
Devil stay away from me
