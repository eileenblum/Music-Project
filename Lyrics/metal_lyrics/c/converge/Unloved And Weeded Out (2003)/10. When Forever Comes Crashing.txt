For the swarms come and reap your day dreams of love and hope
For the frears and blood stains faith are woven in her yearn for war
And the sadder song of broken wings
hard through the battered pavement among this city
Deafending, it betrays me in the sweetest of dreams
These moments can't avoid you
Tonight the lonesome sky opens wide
Forgive me
2 AM - My city lights burn bright as day 
catching the flattering silhouettes of the tired and the damned
Here i am tapped clean out of respect 
and walking waist deep in ruin
If this is need then i never wanted you
Your love was paralysing
This is a momument to our everything
before our forever comes crashing
I loved you
