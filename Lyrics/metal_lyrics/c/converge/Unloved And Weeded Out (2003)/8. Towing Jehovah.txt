Well worn wings crumble
too tired to forgive and too battered to ever forget
I am the labour I am this
I hang as your beloved hex
I'll bring the nails and fevers of bad dreams
Nail him
Burden her
Kill you
Bury them
Its all the same
Great leveller, try to forget my nameon a day like this
Holding your rope, try to forget me now
