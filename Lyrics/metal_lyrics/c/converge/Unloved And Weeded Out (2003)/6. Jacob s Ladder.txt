To say that all of those words meant something
would be to say that your petty wars killed everything
And i wonder if we ever had one of those moments
because i cant count the times
I tried to cut away the dead, hoping to grow up again
How much i tried to kill the smiling boy
The burden of falling out of the womb
How much "not enough" i ever recieved
I will solve these dreams before i wake up this time
This loss wighs, it will always weigh
