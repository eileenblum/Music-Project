I was so naive and fearful of the substantive
Of the greying days, of carrying endless weight
And what it really meant to truly mean something
To really be someone who could be loved
So lost in darkness, in and out of selfishness
Hoarding all my dreams was just no way to be
Then you gifted me such a precious thing
A chance to be someone who deserved love
When I heard your cry ring out
It showed me what real strength could be
As a single teardrop fell
And was swallowed by the sea
You outshined the best there was
Rewrote who I could be
When I held you for the first time
I knew I had to survive
As a single teardrop fell
