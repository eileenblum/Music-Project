I'm losing sleep a thousand miles away from my you.
Unloved, in the dialtone, it's just not that simple when the perfect words don't ever seem to fit.
She just slipped under harmony and now I'm empty handed. I'm just half empty, a second best.
Somewhere it's too soon, it's just not enough. It's never enough.
