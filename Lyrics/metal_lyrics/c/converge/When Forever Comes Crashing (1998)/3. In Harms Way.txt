Goodnight dear angel, I won't be back here in burden.
I don't think we'll ever meet again.
She said that antiseptic words are just sorry answers, and I'd have to agree.
No, I don't think we'll ever meet again.
We give everything for nothing.
Make me an offer I can't refuse.
Give me a reason and I'll give you an excuse.
I get lost in eyes like that.
Thanks but no thanks. God never did me any favors.
