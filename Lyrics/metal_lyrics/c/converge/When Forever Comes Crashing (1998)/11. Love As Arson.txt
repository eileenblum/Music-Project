All these fairy tale forevers welcome everyone in,
and it's no wonder that she fell from his great blue sky.
I can still taste my defeat on these lips and you still have Hell welled up in your eyes.
I will burn that bridge when we get it it. Erase the sun.
These days we laugh a little slower,
and we push our fears a little lower than I ever thought we'd sink.
To those who've killed this hope, a presage, I will rise again. Phoenix in flight,
I'm here to break your wings. I welcome this.
Don't let this heart stop beating I won't let this heart stop beating
and I will rise again and again. I will rise again
