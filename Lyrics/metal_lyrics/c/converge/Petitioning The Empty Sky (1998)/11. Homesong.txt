For words, two minutes, three years 
for my fingertips to grow numb 
Could this be the moment 
when the "finally" becomes the "wish i could"? 
Desperation and outstretched memories 
now I see you only in bad dreams 
I never reset 
I only see you in bad dreams 
Let me explain 
Close enough to feel your words 
Far enough to read your flesh

Thanks to Slipknot287 for sending track #10 lyrics.
