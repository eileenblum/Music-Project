You never loved me. Now i cannot lie down in that bed. I cannot lie down in all of those old fears. I haven't slept, singe the colors from my glances. If i was bleeding, would you tell me? If i was saying, would you hear me? You asked for everything, but never loved. If i was praying, would you kill me? You never loved me. Dead.
