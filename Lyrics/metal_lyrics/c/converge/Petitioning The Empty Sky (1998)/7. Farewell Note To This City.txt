Disenchanting the romantic. This is the real, this is the shame. These limbs search feverishly for the gift of gravity. Coarse twine tears clean. And i have thought about this very instance for all time. Decades longer that you or I. Crimson comforting, scorching this flesh, giving its caring for me. And i have thought about these moments for all time. Dangling from a silver lining. These lungs welcome the crimson tides of misfortune. Hell to pay, this is my farewell to this city.
