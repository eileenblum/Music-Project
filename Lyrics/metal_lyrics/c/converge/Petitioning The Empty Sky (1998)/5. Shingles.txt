I float above and these wings catch, and your sky hold you so beautiful. And i understand if all this comes falling because my sky already has. And my head bows, all of this i know. All of your precious love, you can paint as light as you see. And you can make reasons for everything But as long as i dream some things will always be. Gun in my mouth, i pray for the sunshine. Gun in my mouth, i pray for the sunshine.
