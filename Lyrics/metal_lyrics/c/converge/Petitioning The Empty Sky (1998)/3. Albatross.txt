Five lives dead and gone. We breathe out of key and wonder. If you can hear the awkwardness in these tremors. Draining, cutting, this cancer out. Teeth gaping yet i make no sound. Six hammers and one sky, falling. Five lives dead and gone. Mediocrity in believing in everything, and this lack of will has buried them forever.
