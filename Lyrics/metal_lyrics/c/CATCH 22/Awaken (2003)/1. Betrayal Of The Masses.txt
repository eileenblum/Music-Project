Evilution devilution
Revolution screaming metals on its way
And theres hell to pay
[ verse 1 ]
I can hear the screams of hate
Echoes of retribution
I can see the country's fate
Legions of revolution
[ pre-chorus ]
We all have one voice
Scream out for change
For change
[ chorus ]
Betrayal
Betrayed our trust
Lies that shine in time turn to rust
Betrayal of the masses
[ verse 2 ]
I can see them standing there
Writing the constitution
All for one and none for all
Seems to be their solution
[ pre-ch ]
[ chorus ]
[ solo ]
[ repeat 1st verse ]
[ pre-ch ]
[ chorus ]
