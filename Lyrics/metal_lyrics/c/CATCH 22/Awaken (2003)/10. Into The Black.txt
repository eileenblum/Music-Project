[ verse 1 ]
This cant be real only imagination
Running wild in you
I can see the signs writings on the wall
It's coming home
This is my world dripping with pain
Bring it home for you
Once you have seen it
You wont be the same
Cause here comes the pain
[ chorus ]
Agony and ecstasy
Showing signs of lunacy
Once you're gone you cant come back
Journey to hell into the black
Trapped inside your twisted mind
Pain of the killing kind
Waiting for you they're waiting for you 
Into the black
[ verse 2 ]
This is your life tortured frustration
Running all through you
You cant find your way
You've been led astray
It's coming back
These are my sins
They're all that I have
Bring'em home for you
Nevermind my friend dont you feel bad
Cause your time is soon
[ chorus ]
[ bridge ]
Eyes are open wide
But what do you see?
is it real?Or is it fantasy?
Illusion of your mind
Apparition of some kind
Phantasmagoria
Into the black you wont be back
Images are bending
Transcending
[ verse 3 ]
Dripping illusions
Soaking your soul
Drowning the light
And takes all control
Burning your thoughts
Igniting your fear
Distorting the sound
Of all that you hear in your mind
[ outro ]
Agony ecstasy screaming insanity
Roaring inside your head
Trapped in a palace of pain
cannot be the same
Look where this path has led
Screaming but noone hears
Caged inside your fear
Leaving this world behind
Into the darkend mist
Does this really exist
Or is it just your mind?
Waiting for you Waiting for you Waiting for you
Into the black
