[ chorus ]
Awaken inside the crystal dream
Transcending across the velvet scream
[ verse 1 ]
I can sense a rebirth
New world awaits
Never ending nightmare
Is now wide awake
Darkness consumes the light
Sick sense of pain
I can see it coming
Let the madness reign
[ chorus ]
[ bridge ] 
Underneath the crimson sky
Burning
Watching closely at the tides
Turning
Underneath the crimson sky
One day soon we shall arise
[ chorus ]
[ verse 2 ]
I can see forever
So raise your voices high
The fire burns on and on
The dream never dies
Legions carry on the fight
The new world machine
All guns blazing at you
Madness reigns supreme
[ chorus ]
[ bridge ]
[ chorus ]
