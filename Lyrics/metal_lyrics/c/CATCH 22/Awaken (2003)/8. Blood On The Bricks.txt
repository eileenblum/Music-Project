What a sick twisted world we are livin' in
Kill / marry / fuck where do I begin
I gotta hear the sounds and I gotta hear it loud
To drown out the world that tries to keep me down
I'm gettin' higher
[ chorus ]
Power in the streets
Power in every eye they meet
Nothing but hypocrites
Before they take my music away
Blood on the
Blood on the bricks
[ verse 2 ]
Preacher dont like what I say
I told you once there's hell to pay
Let me hear heaven and nature sing
So far I dont hear anything
But I feel the fire
[ chorus ]
[ solo ]
[ chorus ]
