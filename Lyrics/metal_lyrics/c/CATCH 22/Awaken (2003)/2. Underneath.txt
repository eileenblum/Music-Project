When you build a world 
Made out of lies
The fortress of shame
Crumbles in time 
[ verse 1]
Turn my back and you're cutting on me
Face to face it's a different story
How ya doin' how have you been
I just laugh at your two faced grin
[ pre-chorus ]
These eyes are open wide
They've seen it all
I know how to play the game
It's all the same
It dont take long
To see through the slime
[ chorus ]
I - I can see
Through your lies
Underneath
Lies and deciet 
Betrayal and shame
Underneath
It seems you're all the same
[ verse 2 ]
No guts no goddamn glory
You stand and shake man I got no worries
Time after time you watch your bridges burn
I dont think you'll ever fucking learn
[ pre-chorus ]
[ chorus ]
When you base your life
On deciet and lies
The dust you kick
Will end up in your own eyes
[ solo ]
[ chorus ]
