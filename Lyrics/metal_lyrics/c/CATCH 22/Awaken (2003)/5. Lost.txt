You're lost again
[ verse 1 ]
Try to keep your head above the water 
Better take a deep breath cause it aint over yet
Your lies harder to swallow
Better take a good look at the fishermans hook
[ chorus ]
All this time you've been lost
All this time you've been lost
You're lost again You're lost again
You're lost again You're lost again
[ verse 2 ]
Try to work your way out of the darkness
Try to see the light burning in the night
Your eyes could see tomorrow
Open them up wide you dont even try
[ chorus ] [ bridge ]
[ verse 3 ]
Try to find your way out of the darkness
You stumbled then you fell
In a darkened world you dwell
Your life is in front of you
You just sit and stare and watch it vanish in thin air
[ chorus ]
