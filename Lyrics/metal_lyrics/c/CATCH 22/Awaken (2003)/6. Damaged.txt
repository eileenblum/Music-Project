[ verse 1 ]
Wounds that will not heal
Cover the scars of the tortured soul
Like broken machinery
Rusted and in the rain cannot be the same 
[ bridge ]
I am damaged inside
I am burning inside
The hands of time keep on turning
And it's burning my eyes
[ pre-chorus ]
Love has no meaning to those who have never loved
Dreaming decieving phantasmagoria
[ chorus ]
I am damaged I am damaged I am damaged
Just another slave to the system
In this dying world
[ verse 2 ]
All that time reveals
Stare at the scars till you're goin' blind
Like broken machinery
Rusted and sitting there far beyond repair
[ bridge ]
[ pre-ch ]
[ chorus ]
[ solo ]
[ pre-ch ]
[ chorus ]
