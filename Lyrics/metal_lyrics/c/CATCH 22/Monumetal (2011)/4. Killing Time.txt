Bouncing off the walls
in this rubber room
I know that nightfall
is coming soon
I know the darkness awaits me
Break neck speed
They tell their lies
No need to see
I can justify
I know the truth has abandoned me

[Chorus]
Killing time
One more time
Set me free from reality
Before I lose my mind
I'm Killing Time

Climbin' up the walls
in this fucking room
I know that nightfall
is coming soon
I know the darkness awaits me
Break neck speed
They tell their lies
No need to see
I can justify
I know the truth has abandoned me

[Chorus]

[Spoken part]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
