You can't comprehend this
and probably never will
Dreams inside
that you could never kill
Destiny before me
I shall not befall
Listen closely
and heed his every call

[Chorus]
The power and the glory
The pain and sacrifice
My fate that stands before me
Charging into the fight
Screaming into the night...
...And the Fire Still Burns

[Solo]

You know I can't deny it
My only true real love
It's racing through my veins
pulsing in my blood
You gotta belong to it
'cuz it's all been done before
Just keep the fire
burning forevermore

[Chorus]
