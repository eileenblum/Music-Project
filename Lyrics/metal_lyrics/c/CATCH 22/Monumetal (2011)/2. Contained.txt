Who I am
is only what I've done
This tormented normal person
is all I have become now
Am I Contained?

Sometimes I'm slow
and run in the back of the pack
When the pack's runnin' off the cliff
I'm in front, ready to attack

[Chorus]
It's all I've become now
Am I Contained?

It seems tomorrow has come... Never comes
I didn't expect it this quick
It seems tomorrow... Never comes
It almost makes me... sick

Fighting this war
on my thoughts it's been waged
I'm not too sure
that this anger is caged

[Chorus]

What will I do?
How will it be told?
Destiny minus fate
The story will unfold

[Chorus]
