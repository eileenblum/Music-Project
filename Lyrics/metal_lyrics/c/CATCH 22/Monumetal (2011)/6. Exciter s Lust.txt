Something wicked this way comes
You are now the chosen one
Into total disarray
Day to night, and nighttime has betrayed

[Chorus]
Exciter, inside of her [X2]
Exciter's Lust inside of all of us

Into darkest deep despair
One touch from her and it just disappears
Evil in carnal disguise
Don't believe in love
Don't believe in the lies

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
