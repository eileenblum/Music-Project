No stranger to the light
Or the fever pitch of night
Screaming - don't you dare
He wasn't even there

Rise - ride and take hold
The future unfolds - right before your eyes
Yesterday's died
It's died once again

[Pre-Chorus]
A metal heart can't be torn apart
The power and glory lives forevermore

[Chorus]
Damned if you don't
Damned if you do
The paradox of Catch 22
Enter the realm
Let true metal through
Enter the realm of Catch 22
Catch 22 lies in you

No stranger to the light
Or the fever pitch of night
Screaming - don't you dare
He wasn't even there

Rise - ride and take hold
The future unfolds - right before your eyes
Yesterday's died
It's died once again

[Pre-Chorus]
