We're fighting for the revolution
We must unite!
Kill 'em all
The only solution
to set things right

[Chorus]
Can't you see
that there's magic in the air
(Fight! Fight!)
that there's power everywhere
Power
Revolution
Mas

We're fighting for the electric church
You must obey!
Gotta hit the fuckers
where it hurts
And today is the day

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
