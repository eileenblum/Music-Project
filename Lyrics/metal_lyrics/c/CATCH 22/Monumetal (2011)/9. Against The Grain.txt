I walk alone
With a will of stone
Soon to break the mold
Into the black again
Darkness my only friend
This love I can not hold

[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen the castles
Burning down, down... down, down
I've seen the tables
Turning around

[Chorus]
We're goin' Against the Grain
Against the Grain
Against the Grain
Against the Grain

I scream aloud
With a will so proud
You'll never stop me now
Into the black again
Darkness my only friend
Find my way somehow

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
