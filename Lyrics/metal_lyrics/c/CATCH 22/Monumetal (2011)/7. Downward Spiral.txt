Darkness takes a hold of me
and it won't let go
Sliding down into the abyss
I'm loosing my soul
Help me, I need a helping hand,
but no one's there
Out in the cold you left me all alone,
but no one cares
Memories keep on haunting me
Flashing through my mind
I try to run but I can't break free
They're all that I find

Downward Spiral... Downward Spiral...
