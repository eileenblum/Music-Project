Break the silence
Cut to the chase
Not need to waste timeIt's gonna kick you
straight in the face
Just like the last time

[Chorus]
A thousand burning suns
and getting brighter
Igniter
Time to set this ablaze
I'm the Igniter
Igniter

Laced with violence
and dripping with sin
It's time to begin
Feel the fire
and burn out your fate
It's never too late

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
