[ T.J. BERRY ]

I KNOW I KNOW WHAT I FEEL
I SEE I SEE WHAT IS REAL
CANT PULL THE WOOL OVER MY EYES
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH ALL THEIR FUCKIN LIES- LIES - LIES
[ CHORUS ]
SYSTEMS CORRODING
FROM THE INSIDE
CHEMICALS ARE FLOATING
UP TO THE SKY
SKIES OF BLACK
I HEAR I HEAR WHAT THEY SAY
I KNOW IT DOESNT GO AWAY
CANT PAY FOR WHAT THEY VE ALREADY DONE
ONE DAY YOULL DIE JUST FROM THE SUN
DIE / SUN
[ CHORUS ]
I GET THE MESSAGE-I SEE THE SIGNS
I KNOW ITS COMING ITS JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BLACK CLOUDS THAT ROLL ON BY
SPELL OUT JUDGEMENT DAY
NOONE CAN SAVE US NOW
ITS FAR TOO LATE
NO WAY

I KNOW I KNOW WHAT I FEEL
I SEE I SEE WHAT IS REAL
CANT PAY FOR WHAT THEY VE ALREADY DONE
POLLUTED MINDS THE DEATH OF EVERYONE
DIE - UNDER ONE GOD
