[ T.J. BERRY ]

TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA SAY-THINK
TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA FEEL-FOR
TELL YA WHAT IS REAL-YOURSELF
TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA SEE-THINK
TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA BE-FOR
YOU RE NOTHIN-YOURSELF

STAND UP STRAIGHT BOY AND ACT LIKE A MAN
YOU AINT BUT I AM
THINGS THAT I START I ALWAYS SEE THROUGH
YOU DONT BUT I DO

RUNNIN ROUND IN CIRCLES LIKE A DOG CHASIN HIS TAIL
I SWEAR TO GOD MAN IT FUCKIN NEVER FAILS
WHEN IT RAINS YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS POURS
THE HUNGRY WOLVES ARE HOWLIN AT YOUR DOOR

TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA SAY-THINK
TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA DO-FOR
TELL YA WHO IS WHO-YOURSELF
TELL YA THAT YOU RE GOIN BLIND-THINK
TELLYA WHAT YOU RE GONNA FIND-FOR
YEAH NOTHIN-YOURSELF

SEARCHIN FOR LIGHT WHEN YOU RE LOST IN THE DARK
MAN YOU RE WAY OFF THE MARK
LOOKIN FOR LOVE WHEN YOU HATE YOURSELF
JUST STAND UP AND YELL

FREEDOMS NEVER FREE ITS THE AMERICAN WAY
STEP BACK AND SEE AT THE END OF THE DAY
DOUBLE TAXED YEAH WERE DOUBLE FUCKED
IS THERE SUCH THING AS AN HONEST BUCK---DIRTY FUCKIN MONEY------
[ CHORUS ]
THINK FOR YOURSELF
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
THINK FOR YOURSELF
YOU KNOW THAT ITS SO TRUE

DONT LET EM PERSUADE YOU TO DO
ANYTHING YOU DONT WANNA DO
YOU CAN BE YOUR OWN PERSON TOO
JUST BE SURE NOT TO CONFUSE
CONFIDENCE FOR ARROGANCE
CAUSE IN THE END IT ALL MAKES SENSE
YOU GOTTA GOTTA THINK FOR YOURSELF

TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA SEE-THINK
TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA SAY-FOR
TELL YA TO GO AWAY-YOURSELF
TELL YA WHAT YOU RE GONNA KNOW-THINK
TELL YA WHERE YOU RE GONNA GO-FOR 
NOWHERE-YORSELF

STAND UP STRAIGHT BOY AND ACT LIKE A MAN
STOP PISSIN IN THE FAN
HOLD YOUR HEAD UP AND LOOK EM IN THE EYE
SAY I'LL DO IT TILL I DIE

RUNNIN ROUND IN CIRCLES LIKE A DOG CHASIN HIS TAIL
VARIETYS THE SPICE OF LIFE DONT LET IT GO STALE
DONT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH MAN CUT TO THE CORE
GOD GAVE YOU A BRAIN BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT ITS FOR?
---------------THINK FOR YOURSELF---------------
