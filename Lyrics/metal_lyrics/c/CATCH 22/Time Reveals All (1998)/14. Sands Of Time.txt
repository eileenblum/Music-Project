[ T.J. BERRY ]

WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD
LIFE AINT FAIR
ONE MOMENT YOU HAVE YOUR DREAMS
THEN THEY DISAPPEAR
SLIPPED THROUGH YOUR FINGERS
INTO THE SANDS OF TIME
NEXT THING YOU KNOW
YOU TURN THE PAGE
ITS THE FINAL LINE

RAISE YOUR WEARY HEAD AND CARRY ON
FOR A BRAND NEW DAY HAS JUST BEGUN
DONT JUST WATCH YOUR DREAMS AS THEY DRIFT ( AWAY )
TELL ME WHAT DO YOU SEE AS YOU SIFT
THROUGH THE SANDS OF TIME

WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD
LIFE CAN BE HARD
YOU GOTTA SEARCH FROM WITHIN
TO FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE
TRY TO FIND THE COURAGE 
TO FACE THE DAY
NEXT THING YOU KNOW
THERE YOU ARE
YOU RE ON YOUR WAY

WIPE THE SLEEP MY SON OUT FROM YOUR EYES
AND TAKE A LOOK INTO THE MORNING SKY
A BRAVE NEW WORLD AWAITS YOU THERE
BUT DONT YOU WAIT TO LONG CAUSE IT DISAPPEARS------INTO THE SANDS OF TIME
