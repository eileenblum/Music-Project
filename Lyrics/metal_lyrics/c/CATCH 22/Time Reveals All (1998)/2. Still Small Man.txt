[ T.J. BERRY ]

ALL YOU WANT TO BE
IS WHAT YOU ARE SO YOU CANT SEE
NOTHING VENTURED NOTHING GAINED
A STILL SMALL MAN IS ALL THAT REMAINS OF YOU
ALL YOU WANT TO SEE
IS WHAT YOU SEE SO YOU CANT BE
SOMETHING STRONGER SOMETHING YOU CANT

ALL THAT REMAINS IS A STILL SMALL MAN
I SET MY SIGHTS ON THE BIGGER PICTURE
NOTHINGS GAINED IF NOTHINGS VENTURED
