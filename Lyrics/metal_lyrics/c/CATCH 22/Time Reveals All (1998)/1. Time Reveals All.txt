[ T.J. BERRY ]

I SEE THE WORLD IN COLOR
I SEE IN BLACK AND WHITE
BLOOD RED IS SPILLING OVER
I SEE IT DAY AND NIGHT 
[ PRE-CHORUS ]
YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU SEE
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU'LL BE
[ CHORUS ]
IF YOU FOLLOW INTO TOMORROW
TIME REVEALS ALL
I SEE THIS WICKED WORLD
I SEE JUST WHAT WILL BE
ULTRA-PERVERSION OF REALITY
[PRE-CHORUS ] [ CHORUS ]
HELLO IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE ? PLEASE TELL ME WHY
THE GOOD DIE BEFORE THEIR TIME
BUT EVIL NEVER DIES
WHY?
