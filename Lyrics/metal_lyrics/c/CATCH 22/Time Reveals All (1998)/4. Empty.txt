[ T.J. BERRY ]

WHISPERING SWEET NOTHINGS
INTO THE VIRGIN EAR
WADING THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER
CANT SEE MYSELF SO CLEAR
[ PRE-CHORUS ]
A THOUSAND PROMISES AND LIES
A THOUSAND BROKEN LAST GOODBYES
[ CHORUS ]
IM EMPTY
IM EMPTY INSIDE
IM EMPTY
IM EMPTY INSIDE I CRY
CHALK OUTLINES THE DREAMS THAT DIED
MISSING AT THE SCENE
ITS BEEN SUCH A LONG LONG TIME
SINCE I FELT LIKE A HUMAN BEING
