[ T.J. BERRY ]

1 A.M. AND ALL AIN'T WELL
JUST GOES TO SHOW LORD YOU JUST CANT TELL
I NEED SOMEONE TO EASE MY PAIN
SOOTHE MY SOUL AND ERASE YOUR NAME
I SEE YOUR FACE LOOKIN BACK AT ME
I GUESS I'LL SEE IT ENDLESSLY
[ CHORUS ]
IF I CRY WOULD YOU WIPE AWAY MY TEARS?
IF I STUMBLE WOULD YOU BREAK MY FALL?
IF I"M SCARED WOULD YOU TAKE AWAY MY FEARS?
IF I SCREAM WOULD YOU HEAR ME CALL?
3 A.M. AND ALL AINT WELL 
JUST GOES TO SHOW LORD YOU JUST CANT TELL
I"M SITTING HERE IN A SILENT STARE
AND REACHING OUT TO EMPTY AIR
I SEE THE WAY ITS GONNA BE
ETCHED INSIDE A SORROWFUL SCREAM
[ CHORUS ]
ITS ME AGAIN AND I STILL AINT WELL
JUST GOES TO SHOW LORD YOU JUST CANT TELL
I"M SITTING HERE IN THIS ANGRY CHAIR
STILL REACHING OUT TO EMPTY AIR
I SEE THE WAY ITS GONNA BE
ETCHED INSIDE A SORROWFUL SCREAM
