[ T.J. BERRY ]

WITH A PROMISE AND A PRAYER
AND A SPARKLE IN HIS EYE
HE GOES TO WORK EVERYDAY
BUT HES BARELY GETTING BY
AND AT THE END OF THE WEEK
WITHOUT A DOLLAR TO HIS NAME
HE GETS READY FOR THE NEXT
TO GET UP AND DO THE SAME
[ CHORUS ]
DAY IN DAY OUT
SAME OLD SONG AND DANCE
SAME SHIT DIFFERENT DAY
AND HIS WIFE WEARS THE PANTS
DISGRUNTLED
WITH A PICTURE OF HIS KIDS
AND A GUN HELD TO HIS HEAD
HE THANKS GOD FOR A LIFE
THAT IS SOON TO BECOME DEAD
AND AT THE END OF THE NOTE
IT SAYS YOU KNOW MY TIME HAS COME
I DONT WANT THIS ANYMORE
AND I FEEL MY LIFE IS DONE
LIFE IS DONE

WITH A PROMISE AND A PRAYER
AND SPARKLE IN HER EYE
SHE GOES TO WORK EVERYDAY
BUT SHES BARELY GETTING BY
AND AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
WITHOUT A DOLLAR TO HER NAME
SHE GETS READY FOR THE NEXT
TO GET UP AND DO THE SAME
DO THE SAME
DISGRUNTLED
