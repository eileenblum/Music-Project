[ T.J. BERRY ]

SITTIN ON THE GUILT STEP
LOVE AND HATE -REGRET
HATE AND SPITE -MINDSET
SHOULD VE SEEN IT COMIN BEFORE
THINKIN BOUT THE LAST TIME
NEVER BE A NEXT TIME
NEVER THOUGHT YOUD CROSS THE LINE
[ CHORUS ]
I HAVE SEEN THE WRITINGS N THE WALL
I WILL WATCH AS YOUR CASTLES FALL
DOWN----------------DOWN
FUCKIN WITH MYSELF
DREAMIN BOU MONEY WEALTH
LIVIN IN THE POOR HOUSE
SHOULD VE SEEN IT COMIN BEFORE
THINKIN BOUT THE LAST TIME
NEVER BE A NEXT TIME
NEVER THOUGHT YOUD CROSS THE LINE
SHOULD VE SEEN IT COMIN
