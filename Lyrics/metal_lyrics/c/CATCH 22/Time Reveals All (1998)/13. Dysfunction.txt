[ T.J. BERRY ]

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THE KIDS THESE DAYS
DRUNK AT 13 BY 11 THEY RE LAID
THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH SOCIETY
SHAPING THEIR OPINION OF WHAT THEIR MORALS SHOULD BE
[ CHORUS ]
NO HOPE-NO TRUST NO GUIDANCE AT ALL
YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT HER KIDS JUST SAW
NO HOPE-NO TRUST NO GUIDANCE FROM THEM
MOMMYS IN BED WITH DADDYS BEST FRIEND------ITS DYSFUNCTIONAL

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THE VILENCE YOU SAY
LOCK EM UP QUICK AND SEND EM AWAY
BUT IT NEVER SEEMS TO WORK OUT LIKE THAT YOU SEE
SMACK EM ON THE WRIST AND SET EM FREE
[ CHORUS ]
NO HOPE-NO TRUST NO GUIDANCE AT ALL
SANDPAPER JUSTICE RUBS ME RAW
NO HOPE-NO TRUST NO GUIDANCE FROM THEM
SAY THE RIGHT THINGS AND THE LAWS GET BENT------ITS DYSFUNCTIONAL

CANT YOU SEE THE STATE WERE IN TODAY
LIVING LIFE IN TOTAL DISARRAY
NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR
LOVE THAT GETS TREATED LIKE A WHORE
---ONE SHOT AT GLORY---MOTHER FUCKER

THE JUDGE SITS THERE AND HE WONDERS WHY
THE CRIME RATES UP AND THE INNOCENT DIE
WHO IN THE FUCK IS THE SYSTEM FOR?
IF LADY JUSTICE WAS REAL
SHE D BE A FUCKIN WHORE
