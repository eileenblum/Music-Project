[ T.J. BERRY ]

I SEE A LIGHT THAT S SHININ'
THROUGH THE DARKNESS FAR AWAY
[ PRE-CHORUS ]
ITS IN THE CORNER OF MY MIND
ITS FOR THE SAKE OF ALL MANKIND
[ CHORUS ]
LIKE THE EAGLE FLIES AWAY
TO RETURN AGAIN SOMEDAY
NEVER LOSE HOPE IN YOUR DREAMS
STAND UP AND TELL' EM WHAT YOU MEAN

I HEAR THE VOICES CALLIN'
YOU MUST FIND A BETTER WAY
[ PRE-CHORUS ]
[ CHORUS ]
NEVER LOSE HOPE IN YOUR DREAMS
REMEMBER THINGS AIN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM
LIKE THE EAGLE FLIES AWAY
THESE ARE THE DARKEST OF MY DAYS
