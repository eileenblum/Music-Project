[ T.J. BERRY ]

WHEN GOD LOOKS DOWN UPON THIS WORLD
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SEES?
IS IT TOO LATE TO SAVE MANKIND
IS THE END COMPLETE?
NOONE BELIEVES BUT I CAN SEE
THE COMING OF THE STORM
BLOW AWAY THE PRESENT DAY
THEN A BRAVE NEW WORLD IS BORN
[ CHORUS ]
BURN
BURN THIS WORLD
JESUS LOOKS AWAY FROM US
TO HIDE HIS HEAD IN SHAME
ONCE THE BLOOD IS TAINTED
I CAN NEVER BE THE SAME
DIED ON A CROSS DIED FOR OUR SINS
WELL HE BETTER DIE AGAIN
WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH
CAUSE OUR SINS ARE ADDING UP
[ CHORUS ]
PROPHETS SIGHT CANT SEE HIS OWN GRAVE-A FALLEN ANGEL COULD NOT SAVE-TOO
FAR GONE TO SAVE THIS WORLD-WELCOME TO
HELL ON EARTH
SO BURN
