[ T.J. BERRY ]

NEVER ENDING NOONES BENDING
SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE
ONE LAST CHANCE TO BREED YOUR DEATH
FOR ONE LAST CHANCE TO LIVE 
YOUR FILTHY NEED TO FEED THE GREED
DONE REARED ITS UGLY HEAD
THE PATH YOUVE TAKEN HAS BEEN FORSAKEN-SO DONT YOU DARE TO TREAD
[ CHORUS ]
LOST ALL HOPE
SUCH A SHAME
ALL THIS SHIT
WENT DOWN THE DRAIN
IRRITATED FUCKING FRUSTRATED
ITS BUILDING UP INSIDE
YOU DONT HAVE TO SAY IVE BEEN BETRAYED-I SEE IT IN YOUR EYES
THE WRECKING BALL IS GONNA FALL
THE HATRED BELL SHALL RING
DONT FACE YOUR FEAR
YOU BETTER STAND CLEAR
WHEN THE SLEDGEHAMMER SWINGS
[ CHORUS ]
