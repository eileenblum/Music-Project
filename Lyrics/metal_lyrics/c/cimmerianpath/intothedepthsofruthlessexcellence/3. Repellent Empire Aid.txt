Ominous night is a' fall
Black skies enfold the empire
Begetting fear into the souls of men
Whilst morbid apparitions summon
The advent of deathlike horror
That will unleash agonizing pain

Ill-omened mist thoroughly blinding covers the land
As monstrous daemon-like shadows invade the sky

Amidst piercing cries of death, streaming blood, and falling heads
Disfigured lifeless bodies impaled high

"I, emperor of lands ill-fated renounce my soul
That cryptic stillness veil my realm for eternity"

Enwrapped with death
He falls with mystical grace,
Onto silence that deafens the lifeless planes

Beneath the distressed moonlight
Howling hordes stricken by plaguing despair
Bewailing the sepulcher
Where his corpse solitude will bear

Air is putrid, earth is stale, curse infected shall prevail

Sullen ships the embark whilst in misery they chant
Glorious grief-stricken hymns bidding farewell to their land
Besieged by gloomy torrid waves, leaden skies, and vicious rains
Away they sail in mournful tears never to return again
