Behold the black rose in splendor of night
Untainted face to a cryptic insight
Efflorescence in roseate skin
Unrelenting enrapture in moonlight black eyes

Verdant meadows where the spirits dwell
Winds of eternity cast her name in a spell
Beside the moon-shades of asphodel
The mourning stars light my forsaken path

Descending from the skies on a black-winged chariot
Heretic princess displays the night as her dress

Her utterance echoes in the air
Inflicting sensations of passionate desires
Drink from the lake where the lonely Diana
Moistens the earth with her mourning tears

Waters of pernicious tears
Drown my soul in vicious fears
Seeking to fathom fortune in torture
As my stoning corps to be, it sears

She stood before me in disdain
Inflicting mighty woeful pain
For in blood I wept my last grasp of breath
Robbed of life and endowed with death

Tempestuous winds unfold the earth
Immersed in blood of lamenting tears
Where damned souls engender the befall of darkness
Through hymns of pain and adamant fears

Shedding eerie red that spreads onto a gale ablaze
The ruptured sky unfolds a doorway ethereal
A pier grandiose conducts a dexterous clinch
Hoisting the grinning corpse towards the tyrant's maze

Embrace my soul empress of the night
Grasp me to your within
To you I surrender my hearing my sight
Dripping blood through veins and shedding skin
Indulge me in suffering enshroud me with fright
Deprive me from life yet hold me so tight
In despair I yearn for death in your arms
Nevermore shall I feel the love of the night
