Tonight I try to change my way of melody
To please your lusts and make myself a company..
The pain I cause ain't worth the time you laid on me
Cause tonight I think its up to me to make it real..

Thou I fought before
Now I wanna struggle more
You're the one I'm living for..

Oh your love is a serious burning
And my eyes are the mirror of pain
In the depths of my heart I am learning
To make you smile again..

Tonight I celebrate the love we share
Oh can you feel the love I'm giving you I'm always there..
The loneliness been knocking on your door for far to long
And I hope to see the faze of warmth that has been gone..

The sun is rising
Over lost horizons
I pick a star and give to you..

No more tears no more scars no psychotic fathers
Lonely nights in our cells without love from eachother
I am yours you are mine and we living forever..
