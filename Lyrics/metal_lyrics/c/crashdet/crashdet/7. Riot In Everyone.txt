They think they can hold us down forever
But no one can beat us out of phase
We live hard, creatin' all the terror
The government is shaded by our craze

We take shit from no one
Breakin' free, never stop
Livin' rabid in the everland

Oh we're the kids of the underground
Oh there's a riot in everyone
We're the kids of the underground
And we're loud as we tear 'em down
Oh we're the kids of the underground
Oh there's a feelin' you can't deny
There's a feeling you can't deny
Cause there's a riot in everyone

They say you should live as you are told to
I say you gotta be strong and make up your own mind
Be yourself not a puppet in their freak show
Cause that's the way you'll end up when they beat you blind

Won't take shit from anyone (NO ONE)
Never played by the rules
Cause we're the kids of the underground

Our time, our ways, we're the wasted generation
Our life, we pay, with our nasty reputation
We will always be living free
Always on top of our misery
To live hard is a luxury
And to die of our prophecy
