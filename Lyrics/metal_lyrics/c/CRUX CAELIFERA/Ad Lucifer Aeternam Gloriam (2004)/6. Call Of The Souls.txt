I heard the call of souls, I felt the flavor of the pardon
I touched the element substance sacred moment of reflection
The angel cries on the inside floods the compassion chest
Bleeding the truth bleeding in the deep of the heart
The eyes only contemplate tears of solitude
In the mouth I repudiate moan in the solemn soul desolation
Eight Christ in the land, the only one man consecrated
The Christ of the most sincere lie, that in the alone cross finished
In the womb profaned for words, the cold, seed germinates
The angels load the remaining portion, the in the sacred stream bed finishes
Nephiun was born the bastard, that de clutter initiates
Nephiun was born the bastard, that the discord propagated
The eyes only contemplate tears of solitude
In the mouth I repudiate moan in the solemn soul desolation
Eight Christ of the most sincere lie, that in the alone cross finished

Call of souls...

I felt the presence of the void, I felt the flavor of the darkness
I moved myself as an angel flying, falls as a worm in the soil
Magic asleep for fairies, I woke up prisoner in the rottenness
An angel who falls down of the sky, a man raise conspiracy
Master of the cold suffering, lord of the arden heart
He hears my moan now, to the little one time a time
He transforms the force of the darkness in most brilliant of the lights
For the cursed divine consecration
Oh! Sad angel of broken wing
He flies on the forest of the desperation in search of lost wisdom

This is the call of the souls...
Call of the souls...

I heard the call of souls, I felt the flavor of the pardon
I touched the element substance sacred moment of reflection
The angel cries on the inside floods the compassion chest
Bleeding the truth bleeding in the deep of the heart
In the womb profaned for words, the cold seed germinates
The angels load the remaining portion that in the sacred stream bed finishes
Nephiun was born the bastard, that de clutter initiates
Nephiun was born the bastard, that the discord propagated
