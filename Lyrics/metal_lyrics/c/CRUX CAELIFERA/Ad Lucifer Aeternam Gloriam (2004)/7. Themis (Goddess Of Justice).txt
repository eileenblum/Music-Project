Winds, that moved above the earth
Listen the most insane of desire
Ardents winds of the intense fire
Mold the symbol of all justice and power

Themis, revenge for justice
Themis your fury and conquest

Winds, that blow my face
Bring the smell of the blood and death

(winds, diffuse the universal secret of the angels
Feel rancor and fury
Themis, revenge for the fallen angels
Themis, power for infernal fury)

Demons that control the winds
Listen the voice of the sad more night
Demons that control the winds
Sustain mother justice mantle
Broken the silence the night
Feel my hater, feel the night
Feel my pain, feel the darkness
The power that control the universe
It conquers the force of the justice
It doesn't omit the consequences
Making the truth for justice

Omnipotent acquired present image
Torrents of trust the inspire
The winds that blowing in the cardinals
That take and they make it to worship
Disappointed questions still impased
Save the power of the justice
Save the forgotten truth
Save the fallen angels to the prescribed justice

Themis, revenge for justice
Themis your fury and conquest
Winds, that blow my face
Bring the smell of the blood and death
