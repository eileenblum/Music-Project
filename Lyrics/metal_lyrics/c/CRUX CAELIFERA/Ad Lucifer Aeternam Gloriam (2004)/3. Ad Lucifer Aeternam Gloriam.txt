Ad Lucifer Aeternam Gloriam

Under it's eyes, I assure my devotion
I believe the laws, that shine the strong light
That it ahead observes, of all the thoughts
Conscientious of the power, of your name my father

Untied me in the most impure desires
Creative you of the hells!
That they reflect in my memories

Under it's eyes, I assure my devotion
I believe the laws, that shine the strong light
That it ahead observes, of all the thoughts
Conscientious of the power, of your name my father

Ad Lucifer Aeternam Gloriam

So precrible and deserving the perpetual soul
Difficult times that deserve outcry
One more time shinning and clamour for Lucifer
It's worthy followers of your respect -
Clamour for it's name and fears
The power of it's malignant essence
You true king of hells

So precrible and deserving the perpetual soul
Difficult times that deserve outcry
One more time shinning and clamour for Lucifer
It's worthy followers of your respect -
Ad Lucifer Aeternam Gloriam

Acclaimed angel fallen of long ago
Of this parchment that you will count your history
That your followers honor it's glory
The written dogmas break all
Your children are your image
What waits the hour of your war

Lucifer...

For Lucifer perpetual glory
Ad Lucifer Aeternam Gloruam
Gloriam

Under it's eyes, I assure my devotion
I believe the laws, that shine the strong light
That it ahead observes, of all the thoughts
Conscientious of the power, of your name my father

Hell... For Lucifer Perpetual... The Glory...
