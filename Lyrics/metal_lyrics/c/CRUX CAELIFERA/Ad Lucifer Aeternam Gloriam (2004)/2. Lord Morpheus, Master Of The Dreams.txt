Master of the dreams...
Of the present insanity in the body
He feels sorry in the mind of all
Your anger to search and to dream
Which almost absent content cunning
In the same night present sleep
Long ago to small warrior
Now the god in it's dream
Here it's the lord...
King of the abyss of your nightmare
Lord Morpheus...

Here is Morpheus of the perpetual ones
In come to execute the laws of dreaming
The reason makes it too free
And time seems not to pass
Uneasy soul I take where to desire
It command the steps of it's souls
Of the more insane dreams... Morpheus...
Lord Morpheus...

What exhibits they of a sleep
And the abysses contained in the unconscious one
Of all minds gifts...
It offers the pleasure to it
Even through condemns to suffer it
It commands the sleep of it soul
Of the most insane dreams... Morpheus

What exhibits the key of a sleep
And the secret of all the dreams
Of the abysses contained in the unconscious one
Of all the minds gifts...
King of the abysses of your nightmares
Here it's the dreams
Condemned to play...
Lord Morpheus...

Master of the dreams...
Of the present insanity in the body
He feels sorry in the mind of all
Your anger to search and to dream
Which almost absent content cunning
In the same night present sleep
Long ago to small warrior
Now the god in it's dream
Here it's the lord...
King of the abyss of your nightmare
Lord Morpheus...

Here is Morpheus of the perpetual ones
In come to execute the laws of dreaming
The reason makes it too free
And time seems not to pass
Uneasy soul I take where to desire
But time arrived to condemn
Here is Morpheus
Of the perpetual ones
It comes to execute the laws of dreaming
Master of the dreams...
