Chosen to seat to the side
Of the magnific lord of the throne
He rest smiling mister of the abandonment
Master of the storm and tempest
Polishing steel of one future reality -
The night fall as serene mantle
Suffocating the infidels as poison

Death for death
Life for life
Eye for Eye

Chosen to seat to the side
Of the magnific lord of the throne
He rest smiling mister of the abandonment
Master of the storm and tempest
Polishing steel of one future reality -
The night fall as serene mantle
Suffocating the infidels as poison

Death for death
Life for life
Eye for Eye

With it's silver plated axe the night walks
Searching mad souls for the whip
Leaving body extended to the ground
(cutting with a scythe all the contained lie)
(unmasking the only forbidden truth)

The same angels who loved Jesus
They had left it to rot in the symbol of the cross
Private lie of the consecration
For the fallen angel the beautiful hell
For the protected angel perpetual torment...

Chosen to seat to the side
Of the magnific lord of the throne
He rest smiling mister of the abandonment
Master of the storm and tempest
Polishing steel of one future reality -
The night fall as serene mantle
Suffocating the infidels as poison

(I invoke you oh to be able of the darkness)

Under your command, to gather up a battalion
For you transformed you truth distorted
In a Perpetual and understood world
A understood world
