Made from the flesh dust and the souls delight
He was idealized for the necessary evil
Inspired in conscious desire conspirator
Blood fall from the class world sing's to hears creator
As explosion of a hundred suns
It's written in dead book
Into the heart of olders
Dispute the pretty and freak
How truosome and odd is true
The key of your dreams
Unveiling the worry
Causing fear and perplaxit
All this I remembered into my dark dreams
Written read and conturbed
I wrote my story but in invisible world
I carry my hands to the high
My eyes will change in
Seven worlds of glory
Lauder angels sing never end
High souls and their ways
The malefic and the hell
There will be a great
Battle on the sky
And a fear never fell
River will become into blood sea
I'm a Fire and I keep souls here
I saw the end of humanity
