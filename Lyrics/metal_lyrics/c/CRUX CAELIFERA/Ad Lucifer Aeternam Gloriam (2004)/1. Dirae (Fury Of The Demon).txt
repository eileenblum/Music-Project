Diving in my dreams
The sphere of my mind
I believe the balance
I praise darkness and light
I'm the symbol of comparison
I'm messiah and following
Hatred in my voice in the attack of humanity
Blood in my hands executed of my mission

Dirae Fury of the demon
Dirae Fury of the mother land

My obsession is my power
My desire and my glories
In the portal
I'm the key

Diving in my dreams
The sphere of my mind
I believe the balance
I praise darkness and light
I'm the symbol of comparison
I'm messiah and following
Hatred in my voice in the attack of humanity
Blood in my hands executed of my mission

Dirae Fury of the demon
Dirae Fury of the mother land

My desire and my glories
In the portal
I'm the key

Dirae Fury of the demon
Dirae Fury of the mother land

I executed the laws of the order
I executed the laws of chaos
My glory for it's name
My devotion for it's revenge
In my armor the symbol of my faith
In my hands the sword that process me for my war
Blood for land, blood for the sins of humanity
Blood in my sword, blood in my hands
This is the great blood... blood dirae

One by one my enemies falls in the arms of death
Day after day I follow in my mission

Diving in my dreams
The sphere of my mind
I believe the balance
I praise darkness and light
I'm the symbol of comparison
I'm messiah and following
Hatred in my voice in the attack of humanity
Blood in my hands executed of my mission

Dirae Fury of the demon
Dirae Fury of the mother land

My obsession is my power
My desire and my glories
In the portal
I'm the key
Dirae...
