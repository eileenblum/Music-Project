I feel alive!
I remember, the first time I saw your face
I remember, those first steps that you made
Lack of breath, those first words that you said
I'll remember these until my final days

Now hold my hand
I'll help you the best I can (watch you grow up)
I've seen the world for what it is
Live out your dreams, I'll be there right by your side
Until the fucking end

A bond of love... bound by blood

Now take my hand (now take my hand)
And hold it into forever
Know I will never break, the bond of you and me
Now take my hand (now take my hand)
And hold it into forever
Know I will never break, the bond of you and me (now take my hand)

I'll help you the best I can (watch you grow up)
I've seen the world for what it is
Live out your dreams, I'll be there right by your side

A bond of love... bound by blood

Now take my hand (now take my hand)
And hold it into forever
Know I will never break, the bond of you and me
Now take my hand (now take my hand)
And hold it into forever

Know I will never break, the bond of you and me
This is what it feels like, to be alive
This is what it feels like, to be alive
This is what it feels like, to be alive
This is what it feels like, to be alive (to be alive)

I remember, the first time I saw your face
I remember, those first steps that you made
Lack of breath, those first words that you said
I'll remember these until my final days
Now hold my hand
