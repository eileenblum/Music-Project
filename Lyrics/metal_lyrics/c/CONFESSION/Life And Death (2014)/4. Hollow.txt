I see scared faces
Walking down these hollow hallways
Searching for answers
That may never come
Questions of why? How?
And what is to come
Ancestors surround
These tears will come
Like a waterfall, like a waterfall

Searching for hope
Watching you with that fight tonight
Searching for strength
But these days never seem to end
Searching for hope
Watching you with that fight tonight
Searching for strength
But these days never seem to end

I hope this is it, will it ever end?
I'll sit and hold your hand
And hope that this is not the end

I see scared faces
Walking down these hollow hallways
Questions of why? How
And what is to come?

Searching for hope
Watching you with that fight tonight
Searching for strength
But these days never seem to end
Searching for hope
Watching you with that fight tonight
Searching for strength
But these days never seem to end

I hope this is it, will it ever end?
I'll sit and hold your hand
And hope that this is not the end

I see scared faces, all will come and go
These wards are forced of people gone
Tears roll down the walls, all will come and go
We will remember people gone
