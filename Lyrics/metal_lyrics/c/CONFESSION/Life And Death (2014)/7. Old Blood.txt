Waking up in the middle of night
Is this a bad dream or is this my life?
Waking up and checking my vital signs
Live with no regrets

Sometimes we have to fight
Even when weâre suffering to survive
Against all odds, backed against the wall
We have to fight for our lives

Youâve gotta get what you give in order to live
Youâve gotta get what you give in order to live
The weight of the world is in your hands
All hope is dead
The weight of the world is in your hands
All hope is dead

Waking up in the middle of night
Is this a bad dream or is this my life?
Waking up and checking my vital signs
Live with no regrets

Sometimes we have to fight
Even when weâre suffering to survive
Against all odds, backed against the wall
We have to fight for our lives

There is no standing up, only giving in
There is no standing up, only giving in
Your time is up
Your time is up
When your time is up
When thereâs nothing left
All hope is dead
The weight of the world is in your hands
All hope is deadï»¿
