Fighting to survive
Darkness surrounding me
Even when it's shining above
No turning back the clock
Back to a better time

I see my family falling apart, I can't control it
I don't know where to start
I see my family falling apart, I can't control it
I don't know where to start

Stand back and watch my world as it is caving in
My heart is breaking at the reality we face
Cancer has no feeling, it doesn't care who it takes away
Fuck cancer for taking down the ones that I love

Fuck cancer, I will scream these words loud
For the ones we've lost, for the people taken down
Fuck cancer, I will scream these words loud
For the ones we've lost, for the people taken down

No more strength to fight
When there is no strength left inside
When there is no strength left to fight
When there is no strength left inside
When there is no strength left to fight

I see my family falling apart, I can't control it
I don't know where to start
I see my family falling apart, I can't control it
I don't know where to start

Fuck cancer, I will scream these words loud [fade]
