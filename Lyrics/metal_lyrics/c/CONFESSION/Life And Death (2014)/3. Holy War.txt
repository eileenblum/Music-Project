We walk the earth in search of something more. Our place of religion holds the world on its knees.

You have the world down on its knees.
You have the world down on its knees, cause you prayed upon the weak.

Fuck everything that you stand for
Fuck everything that you believe in

Fuck religion
Fuck everything that stand for
Fuck everything that believe in

Spare me your bull shit take your life and go and get fucked [2x]
