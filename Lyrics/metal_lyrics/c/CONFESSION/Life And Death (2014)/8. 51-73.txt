The place that I still call home
Will never take the throne
And we both have to wait
But the feeling about this place
Will always, will always stay the same
I love you til ..
But you can't .. to there
There will be a place for this
I will never forget the friends I need

This is a story in itself
Sometimes I see myself at home
Something about this place
Will always be the same

.. the ocean.. the place
Living what.. my heart is a fucking mess

This is a story in itself
Sometimes I see myself at home
Something about this place
Will always be the same [3x]
