Another year has gone so fast. With this story told.
Another chapter of life dies, and we're dreaming as we rest.
I'll never let this world, see my fucking face again.
fuck the preaching, kill the choir
stop trying to impress.
And we'll never let this world see our faces.
Tonight we all have to sleep alone.

blocked out the words that you waste.
In the end we die with nothing but memories.

Although time is fading all so fast
Have you seen the world for what its worth
No more sinking feelings, No more wasted times
We'll fall asleep tonight with something you can only wish for

[Mosh]
Isolated... &amp; so dependent.
trapped inside of world solitude.

Another Year Has Gone By

this fucking world failed us
with the nite fading life is the hardest fight.
Walking away from the shadows..
You heard the last from me.... Fuck you and good nite

Although time is fading all so fast
Have you seen the world for what its worth
No more sinking feelings, No more wasted times
We'll fall asleep tonight with something you can only wish for

we're dreaming as we rest...
