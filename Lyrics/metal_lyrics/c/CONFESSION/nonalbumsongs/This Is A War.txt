I felt my world collapse.
Searching for strength, walls fall beside me. This is a war.
Without warning life can change.
These years of memories will never fade away.
If only I could take away your pain.

Sleep well tonight, rest your weary head, for tomorrow the sun will rise.
When weâre faced with darkness, donât be afraid.
Take my hand. I will be there right beside you.
United we stand.

Friends will come &amp; go, family is forever.
I hope, I dream for better days.
Darkness has fallen upon my world.
This callous beast has shown me it's venomous teeth.

Cold hearted killer.

Sleep well tonight, rest your weary head, for tomorrow the sun will rise.
When weâre faced with darkness, donât be afraid.
Take my hand. I will be there right beside you.
United we stand.

Life without you will never be the same.
It will never be the same.
I will fight, I will fight for you.

Disease is taking you under, but it's not over.
Together through and through.
Hope for the hopeless.
Heart for the heartless.
I will fight for you.
