Do you feel the world you have left is crumbling awake 'til the sun comes up, asleep 'til the sun goes down?
Your skin will turn to a pale shade of grey
Shadows of doubt consume, forever seems so fake

Don't try and believe you'll live forever
I try to scream at you
Get ready for a ride with no fucking turning back
Look at yourself in the mirror tonight
Pail face black eyes
Your lips are turning blue
Your pulse is now lost forever

Things can never be the same again
Do you feel your life is crashing down
Bet you never been so cold
It doesn't get any lower than this
Can't live, can't breath

Defeated, and broken
Your future is fucking lost

You're running scared
You're falling down with a sickness
You can't just burn away at your mistakes
Your skin will turn to a pale shade of grey
Shadows of doubt consume, forever seems so fake
Your place here is dead
And your future is plagued by a barren past

Now fall asleep tonight, feeling cold, no place to go
Now go down with your sinking ship, no ocean left
