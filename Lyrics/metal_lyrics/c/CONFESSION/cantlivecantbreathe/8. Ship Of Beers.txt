[originally by Frenzal Rhomb]I've never been the type
To travel on the sea
Without at least a pint
To keep me company
Never in my dreams
Did I imagine
That a vessel of this nature
Existed for our pleasure,
It's so hard to believe
That we will embark
And to sail the open seas
All the while
We will be accompanied
By a sense of well-being and a million lagers

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away on this ship of beers

The sea is getting rough,
But we're oblivious
To the danger of
The savage force
Of this tremendous raging beast,
We're lying down below
And dreaming of the land
Where the trees are shaped like cans
We're wholly confident
Of this craft and our inevitable descent
Along with the crew and captain I suspect
Are sinking down
Into a drunken stupor.

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away on this ship of beers

Something must be wrong
The sea is very angry
Now it won't be long
'til Davy Jones can claim me
Hopefully he'll fell
Like a cleansing ale
After all he's only human.

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away on this ship, on this ship of beers
