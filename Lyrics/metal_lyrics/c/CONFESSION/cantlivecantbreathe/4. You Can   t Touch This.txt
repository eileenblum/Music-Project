Bow down
Hang your head in shame
Hide your face
Where you can't be found
A quick rise, a quick rise to fame
For every bridge burnt, for every bitter taste

Fade away
10 years from now, I'll still remember your face
10 years from now, I'll visit your town
You cannot hide forever.

How could this be; touch as nails behind a screen?
I smile, watch you fail
How could this be; tough as nails?
Fade away
With an ocean between us
I leave reprisal to a later day
You faded away

I'm the reason why you're never coming back
