Glacklungs no longer breathe the same
Now you're choking, drowning in a sea of sudden death
Would you have it any other way?
Look outside, days polluted
Now it's time to face the end

With one quick breath
It'll spread like a plague
It'll take your breath away

Hands over eyes
You're blind to the world
And it's all gone to hell
You can't play dead forever
Look outside days polluted
Now it's time to face the end
With one quick breath
It'll spread like a plague

So how does it feel?
You did this all on your own

So how does it feel?
You did this alone
All on your own
You this on your own

Some things are unforgettable
Some things are unforgivable

This plague now takes our breath away
Unforgivable!
Unforgettable!
