The ride rose so fast you didn't have time to think
Wave crashing storms above collide
The problem is, hope won't clear this devastation
Shadows below circle, you struggle
Your lungs fill with guilt

Now you've had some time to think
While you're sinking
The oceans strength will drag you beneath
The fact now so clear, the truth is hard to hear
Even in water your sweat protrudes

How does it feel
To tread so far
Lost sight of the shore
Lost sight of everything
How did you let this ocean defeat you?
How did it come to this?

You're always giving up
You've got nothing to show for this
Always swimming for your life
You're lost in the ocean depths
But never finding the shore

The ride rose so fast I didn't have time to think
Wave crashing storms above collide

In every sea treachery
There's a killer beneath
In every sea treachery
Is closer than you think

Your life is a shipwreck
You're lost in the depths
And there's a killer beneath you
