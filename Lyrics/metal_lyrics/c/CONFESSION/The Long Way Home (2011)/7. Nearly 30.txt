Everything is different to the way things used to be
Home always stays the same, but the people around you change
This just comes to show the age of you and me
The question is are you happy with the path you made

Seasons have changed
I will not give up on you
Don't give up on me

Everything is different to the way things used to be
Home always stays the same, but the people around you change
This just comes to show the age of you and me
The question is are you happy

Home will always stay the same

I won't give up on you, don't give up on me
