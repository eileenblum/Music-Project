Ive seen you at the point of no return
Alone in a different world
We survived a cowards life
There is no turning back

There was no turning back
Backing out was never an option
Guns were drawn
That night a cowards life exposed for what it's worth

Growing up way to fast

You believe in nothing, you never stood for something
Your whole life suffering to survive
You never stood for anything

I will never forget
'cause I am heartless
Motherfucking heartless

Fuck the life that you live,
Fuck everything you stand for

So alone
