I came back from the dead
I have so many scars in bedded in my skin
Remind me of days gone by
Remind me of the years that have passed
I stood my ground to come out better off
I take in every breath I take, It could be the fucking last

I came from a town that will always be home, so many memories that will die with me
I came from a town that will always be home, so many memories that will fucking die with me

Try and cut me down to my knees, I will stand back up and fight
Nine lives I just won't die
No mercy, no remorse

I seen death before I know ill see it again, I have so many scars in bedded in my skin
Reminds me of days gone by, reminds me of the years that have passed
Ive seen death before it still hurts to breathe
Ive seen death before me

Barely breathing
It hurts to breathe, left for dead

Left me for dead
Barely breathing
