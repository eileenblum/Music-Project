Am I still afraid
Frustrating those around me
This mind is a constant race
This mind is a constant fucking mess
Never slowing down, never fucking calm
A race that never ends

And I am sorry, but I will never slow things down.
It's just the way that I know how to keep me one step ahead of the crowd
And I am sorry, that I left you behind
But I can't slow down

The years have passed so fast, I'm still never slowing down
Never take anything you have for granted

Frustrating those around me
Never slowing down, never fucking calm

Sometimes I feel like giving up

Ive been a danger to myself,
I'm not afraid anymore
