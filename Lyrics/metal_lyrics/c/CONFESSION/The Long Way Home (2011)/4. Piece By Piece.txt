Piece by piece you're pulling me down
You're on your knees waiting for the lights to go out
Your hopes and dreams have a been cast away
Addictions lead so any friends astray

Give me some breathing space
Just a second to catch my breathe
Relax and check reality out for itself
Release your hands from around my neck
Release me from the shackles keeping me at bay

Release yourself because it seems like you have given up
