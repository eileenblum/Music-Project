Future is grim
I can see into the future
Things do not look calm
All these past mistakes
Fake friends I've made
Caused issues I can't bare
As I see into the future
Things do not look safe
As they walk past all I see is hate
Eternal rage

I hope you hate me
Because my feelings are the same
You are nothing more than a fucking waste of time

I live the life you wanna live, I live the life you'd die to live
I live a life that you'd die for, I live the life that you'd die to live

I live the life you wanna live
Step the fuck up
