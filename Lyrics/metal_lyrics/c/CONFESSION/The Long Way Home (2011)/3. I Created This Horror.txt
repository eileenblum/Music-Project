Raise hell
Upon this beautiful dream, I'll 'cause your nightmares
I'll kill you in your sleep, believe these fucking words
I am coming for vengeance there will be nothing left
We don't want your deceased
We don't want your sick and weak
We don't want your deceased
We don't want your sick and fucking weak
Hey, hey
Are you ready to rise, rise from hell
Is this a horrible nightmare, or is it a beautiful dream
I created this horror 'cause I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
