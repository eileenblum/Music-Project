Tonight I saw anger in motion
I feel my blood boiling

Tonight is the night I hate everyone around me
Everyone that continues to judge me
I can see through you, 'cause you are a silhouette
Always stepping on the people you love, you're a body without a soul
The true shine through at the dead of night

The true shine through, only the strong survive

Tomorrows a new day
I've cast this pain aside
Tomorrow's a new day and only the strong survive

The true shine through, only the strong survive
