Don't try and be a hero
A soldier without a gun
A knight without a sword
A model without face
Once human but now a machine
Brutality, will reign supreme
Greed will only cripple the week
Brutality
Continue to run
Run Away
Always failing
Making the same mistakes
Failed in life
I see your greedy eyes
Taking for granted what you have
You've talked so tough, so good luck to you
Please stay safe at home tonight
This is love and hate
I'll burn your house to the fucking ground
The fire will light up the skies
Your neighbours will sit back and watch
Happy cause your wife's a whore
Iâll show you all that I'm callous and selfish
Here's a warning
Your day has come to an end.
