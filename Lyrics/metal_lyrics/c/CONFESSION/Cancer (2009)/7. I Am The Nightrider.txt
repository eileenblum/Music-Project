Fuck
Holy fucking shit
You are nothing more than a ghost
Scratching at your skin
Youâre hearing the voices dragging you closer into hell
People like you're replaced, replaced so easily
Ah fuck
You are the shell of the human that you were before
Canât you see what you've done to yourself you've become everything you hate
The heat from within in burning at your feet
Your pail face and swollen eyes, I see cracks in your skin
I see a pail face, I see the shell that once was.
You are the shell of the human that you were before 
Can't you see what you've done to yourself you've become everything you hate
Hope and suicide go hand in hand
Fuck
I hear the voices
I see your pail face
Dragging you to closer into hell
You've become everything that you hate
