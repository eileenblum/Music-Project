Merciless
Yet still hopeless
Brain dead and a victim of your own mess
Try to pull down bridges that you've burned
Emotionless, Heartless
Realise that you cannot turn back time
To replace the mistakes that you've made.
Emotionless, Heartless
No different from the rest
No high five, no kiss goodnight
No chance to redeem yourself
Do you feel it now?
The stabbing in your back
It's called revenge, Revenge has come to kill you off
This is where tragedy begins
All your fucking hopes and dreams are dead
