Abandoned and left for dead
Another face in an overcrowded room
Sometimes I feel I've fucking lost, I've said goodbye to the ones I love
I ran a mile to find the place; the place that I used to called my home
This integrity is still deep, the future set is unknown
So at my signal
Unleash hell
So at my signal on this world
Unleash Hell
Take it for all its fucking worth
All the places that we got to see
Have made you and me
They've made you and me
The highs and lows sometimes is lost and missing home
We made it here; we fucking made it on our own
We had too much hope in a small town that we called home, 
We will never forget our past or where we started out,
All our friends who made us who we are, who we are today
This integrity is still deep, the future set is unknown
We started out with nothing and made it on our own
