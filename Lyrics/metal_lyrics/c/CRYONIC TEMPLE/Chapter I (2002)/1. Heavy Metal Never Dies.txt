[M: Cryonic Temple L: Johansson / Ahonen]

Metal brothers raise your hands
Together we are strong
Spread the Metal through the World
We will carry on

Never do what they say
Walk against the wind
Always proud of what you do
Never need to lie

Always keep fighting, Heavy Metal never dies
Show them no mercy, play it very loud

Fight... fight... fight for your right
Fight... fight... fight for your right
To play Metal

Welcome my friends into the pit
Raise your fists and scream
Men and women, black or white
Together we will rock

We are unique one of a kind
Hammering our heads in the air
Stronger than steel, hotter than fire
Metal hearts desire?

Show them no mercy, play it very loud
Always keep fighting, Heavy Metal never dies

[Repeat chorus]
