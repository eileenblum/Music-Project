[M: Cryonic Temple L: Johansson / Ahonen]

They came to us and stole our gold
They told us to fight for the mighty lord
We raised our hands and we said no
Co's we are free we will not go

We are the ones, brothers of steel
And we are proud we will not kneel
We walk against you with the fists of steel
Co's we are strong we make you kneel

Live to Die

Metal Brothers, we fight together
Metal Brothers, we fight forever

Brake the chains stand up and fight
Tell them all that the Temple knight
will ride the earth and free us all
The metal sound a holy call

We will unite

[Repeat chorus]

[Lead - Ahonen / Collin]

[Repeat chorus twice]
