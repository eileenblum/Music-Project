[M: Cryonic Temple L: Ahonen]

Once more I look to the hourglass
Realizing there is an ocean between us
An ocean filled with promises
Of subtle words with no substance

Well sometimes promises are hard to keep
It's easier to die than to live full filled
My final mission has finally ended
Enough sorrow, its time to go home again

This promise I give
I shall return

Over and over and far beyond the sea
Those voices calling me
Over and over and far beyond the sea
Those voices calling me

[Repeat verse, bridge and chorus]

I will survive, I shall return [x3]

[Lead - Ahonen / Both]

[Repeat chorus]
