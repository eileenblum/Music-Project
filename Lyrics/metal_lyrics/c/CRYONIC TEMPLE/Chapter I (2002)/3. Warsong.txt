[M: Cryonic Temple L: Johansson]

The soldiers are blue and the indians are red
We're fighting so hard just to keep up our heads
Shooting and killing is all that we know
We are all unknown!!

Running trough smoke with the fear in my eyes
See all the soldiers they stare at the skies
They are all dead but I'm still here alive
I will never die

Slow... here I go...
I stand so tall....

I stand so tall, I will not grow old
I hear the song, the warsong
I face the truth, with the blind and the fool
We hear the song, the warsong

Blinded by glory I'll keep up the fight
Trough darkness I go and I've got you in sight
Pulling the trigger you are out of the game
I don't feel ashamed

Trough darkness and wind, fire and rain
I am going without feeling the pain
I am the last and I can't see the light
Killing is my right
