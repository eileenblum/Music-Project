[M: Cryonic Temple L: Johansson]

The night begins with an awful sound
the screams of pain in the night
You are the one the only one
to make up this fight

Standing there in the rain
Fighting, you are alone

You try to grab your sword and your shield
but there's nothing there
And as he stabs you in your heart
You cry out in despair

Dying there in the rain
Crying you are alone

When the hammer beats the heart you'll know
The swords of metal that fights so strong
It's gonna be steel against steel
When the hammer beats the heart you'll know

[Lead - Ahonen / Both / Ahonen / Both / Collin / Both]

Fading there in the rain
Crying you are alone

[Repeat chorus]

[Outro lead - Ahonen]
