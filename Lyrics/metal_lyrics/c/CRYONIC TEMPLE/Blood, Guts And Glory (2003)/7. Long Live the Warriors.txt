See the fields of fire
Our swords we're holding high
Waiting for the moment
Hear our battle cry

Riding like the thunder
Hear the brother's scream
The swords of destuction
Striking trough the air

In our eyes the fires burning
And our hearts is pounding hard
Hear the sounds of hammers
That crushing skin and bone

We meet the eyes of danger
And we fight for our lives
Feel the rush inside us
Victory is near

Long live the warriors
Fighting by our side
Determined by steel they want to die
Hail to the brothers
That perish on the fields
Hail hail to them all

See the fields of fire
Hear the winds of death
The battle is now over
Our enemies are dead

Gathering our brothers
We place them on a ship
The fire of reliance
Will take them to the gods

Long live the warriors
Fighting by our side
Determined by steel they want to die
Hail to the brothers
That perish on the fields
Hail hail to them all
