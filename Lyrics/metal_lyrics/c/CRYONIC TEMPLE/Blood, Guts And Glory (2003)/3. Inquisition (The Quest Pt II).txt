They are coming after me
I hear them shouting angrily
Killing in the name of truth
"He has fallen from grace"

Can you hear the voices
Fear is in your blood
Remember accusations
Remember executions

The flames of the innocent reach the sky
As long as I'm free the truth is safe with me

Inquisition&amp;killing the innocent
Inquisition&amp;denying holy truth
Inquisition&amp;living eternal life
Inquisition&amp;obeying the serpent

So seductive, beautiful
Her name was poison Ivy
She whispers in my ear
"You are safe with me"

then she mesmerized me
with a deadly judas kiss
betrayed me to be purified
but she burned as a witch

The flames of the innocent reach the sky
As long as I'm free the truth is safe with me

Inquisition&amp;killing the innocent
Inquisition&amp;denying holy truth
Inquisition&amp;living eternal life
Inquisition&amp;obeying the serpent

Who's the saint
Who's the sinner
Choose your masks for this game
