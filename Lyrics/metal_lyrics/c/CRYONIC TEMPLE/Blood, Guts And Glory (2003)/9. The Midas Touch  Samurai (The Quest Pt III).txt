Welcome to the brave new world with apex civilisation
Reality has no world order make-believe has the truth
Silent shadows corrupts life destined for deliverance
Is this the world you want live in fear led by hate

They don't care who you are or why you die (X2)

Samurai samurai
Warriors of the sun
Samurai samurai
Where are you now
Samurai samurai
Warriors of the sun
Samurai samurai
Help us now

Listen carefully to the words, warnings from history
Blinded by unholy light, marching reign in blood
Dressed in white, black and red mesmerized by 88
Is this the world you want live in fear led by hate

They don't care who you are or why you die (X2)

Samurai samurai
Warriors of the sun
Samurai samurai
Where are you now
Samurai samurai
Warriors of the sun
Samurai samurai
Help us now

[Speech:]
Followers of corrupt legends deprived of the truth
The greed of salvation still lives today
Promises of wicked prophets, the fallen one laughs
Remember King Midas greed leads to death
