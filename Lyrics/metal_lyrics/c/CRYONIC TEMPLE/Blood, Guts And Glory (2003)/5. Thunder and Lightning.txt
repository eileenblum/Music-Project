Falling to pieces then rise up again
I am so strong rising again
Feeling destruction the plan is my own
Never to give up again

Keeping the distance and then walk away
Secrets of life secrets of pain
Feel the destruction that I'm gonna give
I am the one who re-pays

I'm thunder
I'm lightning
In the black night I will strike
I'm thunder
I'm lightning
I'm flying free yeahh

Endless nightmares my life is in pain
Never to wake never to sleep
I am tormenting myself to the point
Endless fire I feel

Life keeps on going and I don't know
What is the score what is the goal
To really get even with all of my pains
Keep your distance from me

I'm thunder
I'm lightning
In the black night I will strike
I'm thunder
I'm lightning
I'm flying free yeah
