Here I stand yeah I 'm alone
But I know that I 'm free
Used to go where no one went
I am strong can't you see
And I believe that all things I do
Is the way of my quest
To find glory, treasures and see
What it's all meant to be

Hear me calling from my dreams
I am free
And I believe in my fantasy
I believe!!

Swords and diamonds
Can you see and believe your eyes
As I fall please remember my name
Swords and diamonds
As I go ,and I feel oh so strong
And I know my own way to be king

When I was young I had a call
To be king of my dreams
To keep on going I must be strong
I will search for the light
To find answers to my dreams
I will let myself go
Holy darkness be my guide
In the land of the lost

Hear me calling from my dreams
I am free
And I believe in my fantasy
I believe!!

Swords and diamonds
Can you see and believe your eyes
As I fall please remember my name
Swords and diamonds
As I go ,and I feel oh so strong
And I know my own way to be king
