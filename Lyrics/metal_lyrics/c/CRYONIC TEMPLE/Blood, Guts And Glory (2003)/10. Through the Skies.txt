In the morning my engines are hot
I am ready to fly
Scan horizon, I see a black spot
And the hunt has begun

Throttle up I 'm clear for a fight
Hear my engines they roar
Closing up my guns are prepared
They are the bringer of death

Never gonna give up
Always clear for attack
Save your prayers in the sky
In the sky you will die

Through the skies
I will fly on my wings made of steel
Through the skies
I will go behind enemy lines
Through the skies
I'm fast I 'm mean I am steel
Through the skies
To the end of the line I will fly

Tails in sight you always can try
To hide in the clouds
There's no use it's only one way
To the ground you will go

I am pulling the trigger of death
The time is now short
Feel the flames that burns in your back
This was your last attack

Never gonna give up
Always clear for attack
Save your prayers in the sky
In the sky you will die

Through the skies
I will fly on my wings made of steel
Through the skies
I will go behind enemy lines
Through the skies
I'm fast I 'm mean I am steel
Through the skies
To the end of the line I will fly
