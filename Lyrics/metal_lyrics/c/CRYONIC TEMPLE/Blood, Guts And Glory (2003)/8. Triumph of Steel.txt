Up in the north I found my home
I find my peace and I can be just myself

But now it's threatened soon it'gone
I have to guard it with my life and my sword

The riders came, they were too strong
I was so young I had to flee for my life

They burned it down and killed them all
There's nothing left but my will for revenge

I am the one I am the rider made of steel
I take no charge in taking blood
Into the night I will ride upon my horse
Into the night I will strike

The triumph Of Steel
I'm fighting and using my steel
The triumph of steel
The sword that makes me believe

The ride was long the ride was hard
found a way but I'll never be alone

they came from north they came from south
to seek revenge and they joined me on my ride

The devil's run has just begun
Their cries of fear are carried in the wind

We are the ones we are the warriors of steel
We take no charge in taking blood
Into the night we will ride upon our horses
Into the night we will strike

The triumph of steel
We're fighting, using our steel
The triumph of steel
The sword that makes us believe
