Four soldiers are riding together as one
Striking the enemies soon they are gone

Live by the sword

Never surrender they will carry on
Soldiers of war they are never alone

Flash of the blade

Riding through the fields
Carry on with steel

We're the ones that will carry on
we will make you see

We're the ones made of steel
We will make you bleed

The sword will tell the story
The sword will tell the tale
The sword will tell the story
The swords of the black knights

Plundering the village then burning it down
The terror of death will it ever be gone

Scream all in vain

One year has now passed and the soldiers are three
But still they are riding and using their steel

Die by the blade

Riding through the fields
Carry on the steel

We're the ones that will carry on
we will make you see

We the ones made off steel
We will make you bleed

The sword will tell the story
The sword will tell the tale
The sword will tell the story
The swords of the black knights
