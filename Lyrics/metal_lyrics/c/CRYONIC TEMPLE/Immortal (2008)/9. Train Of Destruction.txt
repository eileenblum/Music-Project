I'm running through time like nobody else, I cannot control my own dysfunctional race
Living in silences is not for my personality, beating death is a part of my identity
Climbing the mountains reach for the stars, face the fears inside of my heart.
No panic just let go, trying to find out which way to go...
Between 4 walls, agony and pain, I don't know why, or how this will it end.

Get on board
Never look back
Hold on
No turning back
Feel the rush inside if the stakes ain't to high
On the train...of destruction...
The train of destruction.

Moving fast escaping sentimental hate...
The blood on my hands I could not care less.
Crawling in darkness one wagon then the next.
The stakes might be high but still my spirit will be alive.

Get on board
Never look back!
Hold on
No turning back
Feel the rush inside if the stakes aint to high
On the train...of destruction...
The train of destruction.

Between 4 walls, agony and pain,
I don't know why, or how this will it end.

Get on board
Never look back
Hold on
No turning back
Feel the rush inside if the stakes ain't to high
On the train...of destruction...
The train of destruction.
