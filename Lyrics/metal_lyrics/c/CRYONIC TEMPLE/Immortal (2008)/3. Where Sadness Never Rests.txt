Take to wake and time to rise my friends
The morning of the longest day has just begun

Hear the war trumpets 
Hear the battle cries
This final war is here
Prepare to fight, or to die

I fight along with the best of the best
In the struggle to survive, some of them fall
We were sent there by corrupted leaders
Most good men die young, but I will survive!

I feel the rage run 
Through my veins
Reach out your hand
I will not let you fall

Welcome to the place 
Where sadness never rests
Back in to the deep black hole
Inside my chest

Welcome to the place
Where sadness never rests
Climb back in to the deep black hole
Inside my chest

Darkness comes closer and embraces me
In to escape the nightmares and pain
But I know as long as my faith will live
Then I will only perish in the flesh

I feel the rage run 
Through my veins
Reach out your hand
I will not let you fall

Welcome to the place 
Where sadness never rests
Back in to the deep black hole
Inside my chest

Welcome to the place
Where sadness never rests
Climb back in to the deep black hole
Inside my chest

Time to sleep and time to rest my friends
The morning of the longest day has just passed

No more war trumpets 
No more battle cries
This final war is over
Now prepare to--

Welcome to the place 
Where sadness never rests
Back in to the deep black hole
Inside my chest

Welcome to the place
Where sadness never rests
Climb back in to the deep black hole
Inside my chest

Yeeaaahhh!
