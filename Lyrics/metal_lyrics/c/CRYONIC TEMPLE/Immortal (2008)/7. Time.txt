Please take a look inside what's the point of it all!
Ask your self what the hell your struggling for.
Life's too short to so don't throw it away.
You better hold on right to your dreams
Can you see me as I'm holding on..
You better make it on your own.

[Chorus]
Time
Time to get things right
Dreams
Start to live your dream
Times
Time is on our side
Dreams
What's worth living for
Tick tack life is moving on, don't wait until another time.
Don't let anything push you down...
Can you see me as I'm holding on...
You better make it on your own.

[Chorus]
Time
Time to get things right
Dreams
Start to live your dream
Times
Time Is on our side
Dreams
What's worth living for

[Chorus]
Time
Time to get things right
Dreams
Start to live your dream.
Times
Time Is on our side
Dreams
What's worth living for
