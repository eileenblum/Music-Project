Long distance far away, You're leaving me
Why couldn't you stay
I run hear you calling my name
And I'd be there...
Then you're not around!
You gave everything, then you took it
All away from we

[Chorus]
As I sleep
I'm watching you inside my dreams.
You're everything
You're everything to me
As I sleep
I'm watching you inside my dreams.
You're everything
You're everything to me

Do you remember the times we had..
Those times maybe gone
But the memorise left
We had it all but I gave it away.
The times has changed and never coming back
You gave everything, then you took it
All away from me

[Chorus]
As I sleep
I'm watching you inside my dreams.
You're everything
You're everything to me.,
As I sleep
I'm watching you inside my dreams.
You're everything
You're everything to me.
