Flying on the wings of glory, on a journey nowhere fast.
Searching for an endless story, hear my call.
I still believe in dreams and reality, no limitation just feel free.
I'm trying to be, whatever feels right for me.

[Chorus]
Freedom calling out my name, no excuses no more pain.
Heading for a new tomorrow a brand new day!

The future is calling me,
Eager to live my fantasies.
The past has gone away
And never coming back again
The present is my time

I'm as free as I can bee
And the dreams may become reality.
I am trying to be, whatever feels right for me.

[Chorus]
Freedom calling out my name, no excuses no more pain.
Heading for a new tomorrow a brand new day!

Left the past behind live my life all the thoughts I had are now gone.
I am trying to be, whatever feels right for me.

[Chorus]
Freedom calling out my name, no excuses no more pain.
Heading for a new tomorrow a brand new day!
