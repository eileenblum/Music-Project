Lost and trapped in a maze
Behind the enemy lines
I'm alone but I will still fight

Fell the enemy's rage
No time for disgrace
'Cause I want to and I need to stay alive!

My head's about to corrode
But I need to keep in control
One man falls but I fight 'til I die

Get them all in my sight
They are falling one by one
I'm alone here but I will stand tall!

Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burning
Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burn

Try to stay awake
I haven't slept for days
I just need to make me free

One more battle to take
I hope it's not too late
I'm not alone, but we'll fight 'til we die!

Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burning
Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burn

No looking back
Look straight ahead
Stick to the plan
We'll rise again

No more tomorrow
No more today
The battle is here
Don't you stand in my way

No more sorrow
No more pain
If I'm here tomorrow
I'll kill again

Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burning
Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burn

Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burning
Standing tall, fight for all
See the enemies burning
