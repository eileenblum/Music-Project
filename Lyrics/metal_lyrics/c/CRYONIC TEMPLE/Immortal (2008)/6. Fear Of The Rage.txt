I cringe my teeth in wrath of the rage
Mass psychosis this land corrupts
Desolation dividing mankind
Wars and rumours of endless wars
Feel me, fear me, see me, hear me,

[Chorus]
I am the only one, the one that survived, the first to revenge
I walk my own way, In fear of the rage they whisper my name
In fear of the rage, scream out my name

Haunting shadows from a wicked past
Death crawls closer, you're feel so lost
Sinister hate behaviour won't last
Let me help you before it's too late
Feel me, fear me, see me, hear me,

[Chorus]
I am the only one, the one that survived, the first to revenge
I walk my own way, In fear of the rage they whisper my name
In fear of the rage, scream my name

[Chorus]
I am the only one, the one that survived, the first to revenge
I walk my own way, In fear of the rage they whisper my name
