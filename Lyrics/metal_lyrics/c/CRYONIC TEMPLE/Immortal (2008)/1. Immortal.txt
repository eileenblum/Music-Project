Welcome to my underworld
Of dragons and demons
Into this pleasure dome
Of nothing and evil

Take a look into my eyes
Can you handle what you see
Evil is unleashed
Into the new reality

I can show you who you really are
Come with me step into eternity

Immortal I am
Lord of the dark
Hunting you down
Without fear in my heart

Immortal I am
Lord of the dark
Hunting you down
Without fear in my heart

On the prowl for human flesh
In search for their blood
Eager to please my lust
I'm hunting you down

Hear me sneaking up on you
There's nothing you can do
Forever you belong to me
For all eternity

I can show you who you really are
Come with me step into eternity

Immortal I am
Lord of the dark
Hunting you down
Without fear in my heart

Immortal I am
Lord of the dark
Hunting you down
Without fear in my heart

Eternal life
Never die
Always forever
My blood-bound faith

Immortal I am
Lord of the dark
Hunting you down
Without fear in my heart

Immortal I am
Lord of the dark
Hunting you down
Without fear in my heart

Immortal!
Immortal!
