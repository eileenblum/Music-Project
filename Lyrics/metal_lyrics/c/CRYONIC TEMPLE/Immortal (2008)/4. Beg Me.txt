Reflections in my mind, am I insane or just alive
Struggling to make the path correcting my own mistakes..
Here I stand once again, making my own into the pleasure land
Watching me beg watching me bleed, watching me feel
Searching my way through the dark, here I am now is this all I can take?
My sweet goddess of pain makes me tremble again.

[Chorus]
Come beg me, come make me please, come save me and I'll be yours
Believe in the words that I say here l am yes here I stand don't you play me
Just come and save me...
Watching me beg watching me bleed, watching me feel
Trouble may come but lies will not win, just let the madness begin
Let your self go leave it out of control.

[Chorus]
Come beg me, come make me please, come save me and I'll be yours..

Watching me beg watching me bleed, watching me feel

[Chorus]
Come beg me, come make me please, come save me and I'll be yours
Yours to hate, I'm yours to blame, yours to hate, yours to blame
