Searching through my darkest memories.
Can not keep them away from me.
Ending before my eyes.
The past hurts so much,
How can it be
Hear my own soul

[Chorus]
Fight to survive the fear in my mind,
Darkness closing in
Fight to survive the dark in my mind
Shadows hunting me ...
Lost my self along the
Long dark path
Agonized by my past ...
Yet back on track ...
Ending before my eyes.
I hear my heartbeat ...
I hear my breath ...
Hear my own soul

[Chorus]
Fight to survive the fear in my mind,
Darkness closing in
Fight to survive the dark in my mind
Shadows hunting me....
Hear my own soul

[Chorus]
Fight to survive the fear in my mind,
Darkness closing in
Fight to survive the dark in my mind
Shadows hunting me....
FIGHT!!
