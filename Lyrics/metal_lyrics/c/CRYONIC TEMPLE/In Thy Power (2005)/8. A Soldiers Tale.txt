[E. Ahonen]

Tell me the promise of Fortune and Fame
Tell me how come it ends all the same
Tell me the story of young and the old
While we bleed, to death, this morning so cold

Cowards that hide in the Shadows of Greed
Attack in the night our brethren in need
We will strike back in the final frontier
The taste of Revenge is so sweet and so clear

If battle is for Glory
Tell me how, tell me when will this pain ever end?
If battle is for Glory
Tell me how, tell me when will this pain ever end?

We fight together, in this battlefield of Hell
We live forever, we are the Brothers in arms
We fight together, and to bitter end we will fight
We will never, surrender to unholy light

Tell me the reasons why you can't stop lying
Tell me how come that we all ha'e just die
Tell me the truth or has it been sold
While we bleed, to death, in this morning so cold

Vultures will feast on all those who will die
Pile of corpses beneath the red Sky
In rage we attack 'cause glory is near
The taste of Revenge is so sweet and so clear

If battle is for Glory
Tell me how, tell me when will this pain ever end?
If battle is for Glory
Tell me how, tell me when will this pain ever end?

We fight together, in this battlefield of Hell
We live forever, we are the Brothers in arms
We fight together, and to bitter end we will fight
We will never, surrender to unholy light

[All Leads &amp; Lead harmonies - Ahonen]

We fight together, in this battlefield of Hell
We live forever, we are the Brothers in arms
We fight together, to bitter end we will fight
We will never, surrender to unholy light

[Outro melody - Ahonen]
