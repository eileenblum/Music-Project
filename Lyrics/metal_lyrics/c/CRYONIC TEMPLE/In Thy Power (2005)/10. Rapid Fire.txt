[J. Johansson]

[Intro lead - Ahonen]

In the deepest woods I run, I am frightened and alone
(I am so frightened and alone)
I am here defending my land, a million miles from home
(I am a million miles from home)
How can it be, it must be wrong, that the enemies of mine
(How can it be it must be wrong)
Is a threat to us and the world,
When they can't feed their children (or are the enemies of me?)

Lies
We are betrayed
Can this be wrong?
Is this the End?

Rapid Fire - waking you up in the night
Rapid Fire - terror of death rules the fight
Rapid Fire - it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid Fire - I hear the screams of those who die

Politicians make their way for the money and the fame
(Their way of greed makes us die)
Sending people to their graves for a reason that's unknown
(They're sending people to the grave)
All day long I think of this and it makes me wanna scream
(No, it makes me wanna scream)
And to leave it all behind, for them to fight their war
(For them to fight their wars)

Lies
We are betrayed
Can this be wrong?
It must the End?

Rapid fire - waking up in the night
Rapid fire - terror of death rules the fight
Rapid fire - it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid fire - I hear the screams of those who die
Rapid fire, fire, Fiiire, Rapid Fire

[Leads - Ahonen / Collin / Ahonen / Collin / Both]

Rapid fire - waking up in the night
Rapid fire - terror of death rules the fight
Rapid fire - it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid fire - I hear the screams of those who die
Rapid fire - waking up in the night
Rapid fire - terror of death rules the fight
Rapid fire - it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid fire - I hear the screams of those who die
