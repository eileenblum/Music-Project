[E. Ahonen &amp; J. Johansson]

In a world of confusion and pain
We will need a leader again
He will come and bring us home
And will see that all evil is gone

Even though our kingdom can die
We must try to hold our heads high
Now the time will come for us
Make a stand and fight for our king

There will be another time for us
Our kingdom will grow strong

In the power of our king (power of our king)
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of our ring (keeper of our ring)
For us he is divine
In the power of our king (power of our king)
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of the ring
For us he is divine

In these times when tyranny rules
Killing heroes, saints and fools
They are slain by the reign of blood
Sacrifice for the unholy god

From the masses a man will rise
He will point his sword at the skies
All the evil will tremble with fear
Because they know that the end is near

There will be another time for us
Our kingdom will grow strong

In the power of our king (power of our king)
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of our ring (keeper of our ring)
For us he is divine
In the power of our king (power of our king)
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of the ring
For us he is divine

[All Leads &amp; Harmonies - Ahonen]

In the power of our king (power of our king)
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of our ring (keeper of our ring)
For us he is divine
In the power of our king (power of our king)
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of the ring
For us he is divine
