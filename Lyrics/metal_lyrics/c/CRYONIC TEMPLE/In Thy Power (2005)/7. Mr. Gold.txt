[J. Johansson]

All your life you've been walking the road
The road of the poor
You will do whatever it takes
To make it all shine
Wanna be rich and famous?
Wanna be Mr Gold?
Doesn't matter what it costs
Your life is on loan

Searching, searching you are never pleased
Going, going and you're never going back

Gone for gold - search across the land
Gone for gold - treasure's in your hand
Mr Gold - future lay ahead
Mr Gold - so you find it or be dead

Yes it seems that you can do
Whatever it takes
To make your own world good
Never ashamed
But when you reach your final goal
And all is fine
You will stand there all alone
Alone in the world

Searching, searching, you are never pleased
Going, going and you're never going back

Gone for gold - search across the land
Gone for gold - treasure's in your hand
Mr Gold - future lay ahead
Mr Gold - so you find it or be dead
I am Mr. Gold

[Leads - Collin / Ahonen / Both / Ahonen / Collin]

Searching, searching you are never pleased
Going, going and you're never going back

Gone for gold - search across the land
Gone for gold - treasure's in your hand
Mr Gold - future lay ahead
Mr Gold - so you find it or be dead
