[E. Ahonen]

Media provokate: Atheist! Nihilist! Anarchist!
Extremist! Turning to madman scientist!
The Perceiver: Marching along at the Road of
Destruction? Are we going insane?
Media provokate: Pro drugs! Pro war! Pro pain, all insane!
Losing all vision, extremist!
The Perceiver: These shallow promises, mesmerized by media whores

If this is what is left
Then walk away

The King has returned, Never lose your faith
Break the chains, rise above the lies
The King has returned, Never lose your faith
We have to break the chains, Fight for freedom
They only change
When Hell Freezes Over

Media provokate: Racist! Zionist! Fascist! Pacifist!
Corrupted post-modern idiotism!
The Perceiver: Blinded by the common fear of knowledge?
(Truth is) based on faith or science!
Media provokate: Communist! Islamist! Born again!
Terrorist! Lost in a Mystic evangelism!
The Perceiver: How come you (journalists) fear your mind?
Why don't you (the media) just choose your destiny?

If this is what is left
Then walk away

The King has returned, never lose your faith
Break the chains, rise above the lies
The King has returned, never lose your faith
We have to break the chains, fight for freedom
They only change
When Hell Freezes Over

[All Leads &amp; Harmonies - Ahonen]

If this is what is left
Then walk away

The King has returned, never lose your faith
Break the chains, rise above the lies
The King has returned, never lose your faith
We have to break the chains, When Hell Freezes Over
When Hell Freezes Over
