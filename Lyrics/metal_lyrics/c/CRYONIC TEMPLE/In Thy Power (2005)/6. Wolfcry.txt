[E. Ahonen]

He's vigil in the wonderland of broken holy mirrors
Never ending nightmares, Echoes of the past
He escapes his reality, with Prozac n' novocaine
And refuses to remember his search for peace

Fading pictures on his bedroom wall
Memories from the hidden past
Remaining dreams in an endless Fall
He will never ever rise&amp;

Wolfcry, now he's coming after you
Wolfcry, I am fearing the night
Wolfcry, and there is nothing I can do
Wolfcry, I am fearing the night

He used to live alone, hiding in the ruins
In wars without a cause, deadly sniping enemies
Hailed as a Warrior but then the war was over
Haunted by the hollow eyes of those that he killed

Fading pictures on his bedroom wall
Memories from the hidden past
Remaining dreams in an endless Fall
He will never ever rise&amp;

Wolfcry, now he's coming after you
Wolfcry, I am fearing the night
Wolfcry, and there is nothing I can do
Wolfcry, I am fearing the night

[All Leads &amp; All harmonies - Ahonen]

Fading pictures on his bedroom wall
Memories from the hidden past
Remaining dreams in an endless Fall
He will never ever rise&amp;

Wolfcry, now he's coming after you
Wolfcry, I am fearing the night
Wolfcry, and there is nothing I can do
Wolfcry, I am fearing the night
