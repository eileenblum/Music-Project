[E. Ahonen]

Screams in the night, the beast has risen again
Screams of fear, the beast has no mercy to men
Live or just Die, by the Code of Conduct
Divine Justice, is my Holy Revenge, Beware!

I do not fear, the Beast's bloodstained path
He knows I'm near, in wrath he attacks from the dark

All my guns are blazing in the dark night
Another beast has been condemned to Hell

I'm alone in this dark world.
Its me, my guns and my trusted wolf
I am the Slayer,
The Chaser of unholy prey
I'm alone in this dark world.
It's me, my guns and my trusted wolf
I can not die yet
Until my quest is fulfilled
Beast slayer
Beast slayer

The blood red moon, witness my holy search
And then I stand, Eye to Eye with the Beast

The Fight was Brutal, but I burned him alive
All their victims can now rest in peace

All my guns are blazing in the dark night
Another beast has been condemned to Hell

I'm alone in this dark world.
It's me, my guns and my trusted wolf
I am the Slayer,
The Chaser of unholy prey
I'm alone in this dark world.
It's me, my guns and my trusted wolf
I can not die yet
Until my quest is fulfilled
Beast slayer
Beast slayer

[All Leads &amp; Lead harmonies - Ahonen]

All my guns are blazing in the dark night
Another beast has been condemned to Hell
Hell, Hell, Hell

I'm alone in this dark world.
It's me, my guns and my trusted wolf
I am the Slayer,
The Chaser of unholy prey
I'm alone in this dark world.
It's me, my guns and my trusted wolf
I can not die yet
Until my quest is fulfilled
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
