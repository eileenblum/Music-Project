[E. Ahonen]

We all started one morning
Scientists with a mission
A journey to the unknown
Looked so good, felt so right

I remember it so clearly
Technology will save us
But the machines started shaking
Began to dissolve, We fall apart

It's all in the Eye of the Beholder
As we dissolve in dimensions of life

We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empires Rise
Visions of Fate and Future ahead

Remember all the Promises
The Power and the Glory
Of our Quest of humanity
Looked so good, felt so right

I remember it so clearly
We were the best of the best
But we could not prevent it
Living as ghosts not really dead

It's all in the Eye of the Beholder
As we dissolve in dimensions of life

We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empires Rise
New visions of Fate and Future ahead
We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empire Fall
Vanishing fragments in Sea of Lies

Am I a man or am I a Machine?
Am I the Redeemer or was I the Saviour?
I am the new Alpha &amp; Omega
But who Created Me?

Lord help me now
Lord hear me scream
Fading apart
I'm losing my mind

[All harmonies - Ahonen]

We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empires Rise
New visions of Fate and Future ahead
We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empire Fall
Vanishing fragments in Sea of Lies
