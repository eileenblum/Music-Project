[E. Ahonen + J. Johansson + Jan Soderlund]

Never afraid, alone we stand strong
Our Brothers in Arms make us go on
Keepers of Faith will never let go
Stronger and stronger we grow, we will explode

We follow the road in an unbroken line
We go where nobody dares
A legacy strong was born to this world
By us the Brothers of Steel

We make our own way, they can't put us down (oh no)
'Cause we are aligned all over the world
The fire within will always burn bright
We will never give up, let's carry on

We follow the road in an unbroken line
We go where nobody dares
A legacy strong was born to this world
By us, the Brothers of Steel

The eternal flames of metal
Living in our hearts
It never dies
The flames will live forever

The eternal flames of metal
Burning in our hearts
It never dies
The flames will live forever

Together we march, to live or to die
A Legacy strong we can't leave behind
We will never surrender! They don't understand
That we are unique we're one of a kind

We follow the road in an unbroken line
We go where nobody dares
A legacy strong was born to this world
By us, the Brothers of Steel

The eternal flames of metal
Living in our hearts
It never dies
The flames will live forever

The eternal flames of metal
Burning in our hearts
It never dies
The flames will live forever

[Leads Ahonen / Both / Collin]

[Chorus]
