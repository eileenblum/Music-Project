[J. Johansson]

[Intro lead - Ahonen]

Out in the night the wind blows so cold
The moon lights my way I wanna go home
I scan the horizon the Shore is so far
The body is weakening I stare at the stars

There is lightning and there's pain
You feel fire in your brain
There is nothing you can do
For the beast will come for you

Shark attack - swimming alone in the waters of Hell
Shark attack - the blood on my hands is the proof of the tale

[Lead - Ahonen]

Something is moving beneath my cold feet
I'm trying to move but I'm all too scared
A terrible burst of pain in my leg
The beast took a bite soon I am dead

There is lightning and there's pain
You feel fire in your brain
There is nothing you can do
For the beast will come for you

Shark attack - swimming alone in the waters of Hell
Shark attack - the blood on my hands is the proof of the tale
