Looking back these past few years, I must admit that I am not myself.
I will keep from sinking.
When did I become a stranger to everyone?
Where do I belong?
I lost what I believe, lost in complacency, without even putting up a fight.

Lost in a world that only cares for itself,
held captive by the weight of worldly possessions.
With a faith that is ever-fading, where did we go wrong?

I will not conform.
I am not a pattern of this world.
I will never belong.

The weight of the world will not hold me down.
I will keep from sinking.
I found my way out.
Take my hand.
I will lead you to what you've been searching for.
Take the world, but give me Jesus.
I have found my way out.
I will keep from sinking.
