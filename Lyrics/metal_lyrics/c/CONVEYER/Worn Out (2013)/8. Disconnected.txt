I've been chasing an image that I have had
as far back as my mind will let me go.
The older I get, the less I seem to care.
Maybe I was wrong.

Am I looking at life through closed eyes,
or am I starting to understand
I was called for more than living this life without taking chances?

Father, give me direction.
I am so lost.
Lost in my own skin.
I can't go on pretending,
but it feels so good to finally admit that
these dreams we set were never enough.
We were meant for more.
Selfish men die with empty hands.

Judge me on what I do with the time that I am here.
You know my heart.
You know my every desire.
You know my heart.

Help me see this life through your eyes,
because all I see is a world so hopeless,
we are so helpless without You.

Make us new.
Give us the heart to chase after You.
Make me new.
Give me the heart to chase after You.
Change my heart. Make me new.
Change my heart. Make me new.
Change my heart. Make me new.
Change my heart. Make me new.
