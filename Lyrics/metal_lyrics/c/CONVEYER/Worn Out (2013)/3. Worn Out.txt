Locked inside this unstable mind.
A daily struggle to get out from behind
these cold, dark walls that are caging me in.
I will hold my own in a world that means nothing to me.

There is so much more
than the chains that are holding you back.
What are you still searching for
if the answers are there in your hands?

Give it up; give up the life you planned.
The things you gain will leave you in the end.
Hold to the promise of a life made new.
If you can give up your ways that life will come to you.

Give it up. Is that what you want?
Give it up.
Possessions will weigh you down.
But when there's nothing to save you, is it too late to turn around?
You can fall down as far as you let yourself.

Blinded by the world that surrounds you.
Cast aside the fears of uncertainty.
Look past the lies that you've been told for all your life.
Because there's only one truth left to live for.
There is only one truth.

I've changed my ways and cleared my mind, gaining some distance on what I've left behind.
I know my place, and I won't be deceived.
I will take back the time that was stolen from me.
I refuse to belong to a world that believes there is nothing more than this.
This is not who I am.
This is not for me.
