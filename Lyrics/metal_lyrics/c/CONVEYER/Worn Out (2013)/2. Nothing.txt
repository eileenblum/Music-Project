I'll never be good enough.
I'll just hang my head as smiles grace your faces like you understand.
But you don't know all the struggles that I face;
all the burdens on my plate; all the joy that's been erased.

I've never felt so separated, disconnected, and so hated.
I feel nothing from the things that surround me,
so what does it matter if I give nothing back?

I don't feel anything.
Help me feel anything; anything at all.
What do You see in me?
I don't see anything.
What do You see in me?
Was I worth the cost?

I know how it goes, "Your debt's paid in full".
But how can I hold on when I sink down this low?
I can't bear the weight of all my mistakes.
Can You take them from me or am I too late?

God, I need some sympathy.
I need some direction in front of me.
A guiding light; a flicker of hope to take me back to the life I know.
(I know)
God, I need You now.
