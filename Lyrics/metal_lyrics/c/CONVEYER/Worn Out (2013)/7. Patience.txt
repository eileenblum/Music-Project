There's so many things that I try to control,
with nothing to lose on by letting them go.
Afraid of the outcome, I state my case,
but when will my plans be replaced by my faith?
I have no time to wait on myself.
I stand behind You,
I'll wait for Your call.

Everything that You are is everything that I strive to be.
Everything that I am I owe to You.
Everything that You are is everything that I strive to be.
Everything that I am I owe to You.

Patience is the enemy of everything inside of me.
A patient mind and patient words are worth more than this selfish world.
I will trust in You.
I put my faith in You.
Take me away.

Take me away, away from myself.
I cannot be trusted with anything else.
I've gone too long holding onto my life.
It's time to stop running.
Give me patience.

Everything that You are is everything that I strive to be.
Everything that I am I owe to You.
Everything that You are is everything that I strive to be.
Everything that I am I owe to You.
