You don't care about me or what I say.
Cast me out so I stay away.
Nothing special; wasted space.
In the way and out of place.
I live my life so I'm not alive.
Fade away until I die.
Nothing to give and not a thing to take.
I want to try, but I'm too late.

I'm selfish,
ungrateful,
a coward
incapable of showing the love I didn't know I had.

My bitterness is taking over,
blinded by what I can't see.
But I know that I hate the world that's always hated me.

Why is it so hard to see what's so hard for me to separate these things?
Right or wrong, truth or not.
I won't let this world take my life from me.

I've had enough. I had a thought placed inside my head.
I've had enough of this world that speaks for death.
I had a thought. It was placed in my head.
But I won't give up I'll beat out death instead.

I won't give up.
Don't give up on me.
I can't stand aside and let the world decide what's right for me.
I won't surrender.
I'll lift my eyes, and not a flag.
I won't surrender.
I'll live to see another day.
I won't surrender.
I'll lift my eyes. I'm not afraid.
