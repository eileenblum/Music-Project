"Meaningless. It's meaningless."

A lie you've been told all your life.
It's hard to see what constitutes for truth.
Look at me, see nothing.
Not because there's nothing there.
I don't want to see you.

There's nothing for me
Outside of mercy.

So who are you?
I don't know you.
Who am I?
You'll never know.

I chose a long time ago,
That I would never let myself
Fall victim to the mindset
Reserved for the hating,
The lustful, the greedy,
The selfish, the negative.

Still you continue to haunt, in spite of me.
But I won't suffer the thought;
The thought that you
Have a hold on me.

It's time for you to let me be,
And take a second to let me breathe.

When are you gonna learn
I'm not going alive?
When are you gonna learn?
I'm not going at all.
I'm not going.
I'm not going at all.
I'm not going.
I'm not going...
At all.

Holding to my foundation
To keep my head above the rushing water.
Free from you; from this world.
Safe from getting dragged under.
A life of lies
Can't hide me from the truth.

Do you see me now?
Can you hear me now?
I'm not laying down.
I'm standing up
To the demons inside me.
