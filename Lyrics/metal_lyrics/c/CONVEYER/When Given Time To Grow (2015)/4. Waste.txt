We canât change the outcome, the eventual end to everything we know.
Powerless to stop the ebb and flow of the hardened rains we gathered.
Humankind will reap what we have sewn.
The depressing waltz we all live by, our pallid history.
Will result in what weâve paid for; The wages of humanity.
At the end of the line, bodies give up souls.
Running out of time. This is coming to a close.
Curtains close at the end of the road.
Sins unatoned by the Love we didnât know.

Give me the world for what it is.
Or nothing at all.
Unsheltered from the awful truth.
We donât know what we think we do.

The minds of foolish men closed up behind our narrow heads.
Assuming we know everything there is.
Never questioning the reason we exist.
Weâll never give up our swinging at the wind.
Building up our altar to tear it down again.
Open your eyes and disconnect your mind.
From the powers who profit from feeding you these lies.

Give me the world for what it is.
Or nothing at all.
Unsheltered from the awful truth.
We donât know what we think we do.

This world is wasting away.
And it could happen today.

This world is wasting away.
And it will happen.
