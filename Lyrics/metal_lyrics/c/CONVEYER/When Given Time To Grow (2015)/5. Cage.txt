I just want you to know.
That being your son has been a blessing at most.
That youâre made to carry His love.
How proud I am of you for not giving up.
I pray every day (I pray every day) that God heals your pain.
And you know He doesnât want you to fade away in that cage.

I remember the times you told me about Christ.
How He painted the skies, how He gave us new life.
And I hope every night, when you close your eyes;
You remember that He stays the same, that your only hope is in His face.
That Dad loved a woman with grace.
That I take you with me to the grave.
Youâll be home with us soon.
Youâve just got to believe.
That youâve got what it takes.
Heâs the proof that you need.
