This is my aberration from the world I've come to know
Opposed to all that hinders the freedom of my soul
Faithless in a future disregarding my conviction
Remove me from the mindset of man

I hope I'm not just counting down the days
Until I relapse and forget to relate
There's got to be more than what we're all conditioned to expect
From this self-centered world of hate and regret, pain and neglect
I'm trying my best

I've had a change of heart
You have captivated this dead man
I will sing praises to show them
A chorus carried up on high

Ignoring importance, ignoring the critical
Existential urgency
Ignoring our purpose, ignoring the vital
Bled dry by apathy

Avoiding moral imperative
Death without life, an end with no means
A population of selfish men who have no one to blame but themselves
The world is plain and simple; depravity of the heart
Living in a constant spiral of moral disregard
You will be my Haven for the rest of my days
Refine me from my self-centered ways

I've had a change of heart
You have captivated this dead man
I will sing praises to show them
A chorus carried up on high
