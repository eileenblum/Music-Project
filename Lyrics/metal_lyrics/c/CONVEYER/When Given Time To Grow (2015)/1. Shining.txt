Iâve grown far too acquainted to being disappointed.
And Iâm still not sure how I feel anymore.
So void of emotion, Iâm not sure on where I stand.
Helpless and thirsty for peace.
Never wanting what I need.
It has taken me this long.
To admit that I am wrong.

You make me feel like myself.
When everything fades to black.
You pull me out of this hell.
You bring the color back.

The worst kind of self-deprecation.
Almost at my end, internalized contempt.
Let my sighs give way to this song of Your strength.
Repeating to myself that You have a plan for me.
Broken world.
The life weâre willing to face.
Open heart.
A risk weâre willing to take.

You make me feel like myself.
When everything fades to black.
You pull me out of this hell.
You bring the color back.
