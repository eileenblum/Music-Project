Lust is a liar, leaving a taste so bitter in my mouth.
That just wonât wash away.
I pray for the day the thought of us decays.
And dissolves beneath my dreams.

Iâve been culprit; everything I touch turns to disarray.
Ashamed of the pulpit I stand on today.
The love we made has lead us both astray.
I canât help but keep losing sleep.

Iâm moving on, people will change.
This always I can count on.
Doomed to repetition of inconsistency.
Chained to obligations staring back at me.
Cowering under the weight of consequences.

I shouldnât be here, I need a second chance.
I need forgiveness, I need a second chance.
I need a way out of this mess Iâve made myself.

Weâve sinned in the dark, and now I canât forget.
Two souls tied together, drowning in regret.
Lust left us with a hole in our hearts.
Our best intentions tore us apart.
God, I hope Youâll forgive me for treating her like this.
