[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gimpl]

I never knew that I could see the pain and the sorrows
That you hide in your mind and deep in your soul
So now forgive me that I hold the key to your heart
And the yearning that took me so far, far away

And as I feel inside the force to carry on
That s when I realize our time has just begun

Sometimes when darkness falls I lie awake with my eyes open
wide. You cannot stop my thirst for revenge
I set my spirit free, the dawn it holds me in its deep embrace
From the twilight my soul will arise.

Inside myself there is a dream that never dies
This burning fever takes me to the open skies

Now we fly away to find Eternia
Farewell to pain and death, farewell to evil s breath
And as we fly away we'll find Eternia
On through the pouring rain and through the raging flame
We fly towards the sky

On through the raging fire, towards the battlefield
I know who you are are I will show you my power
Across the barren wasteland, thunder and lightning
On my feet as I ride through the skies I devour

Flying on wings of fury, only the strong survive
The weak will be wiped out by steelgrown desire
Deep in my heart is rising a blackened sun
That shines forever and ever, brings torment and fire

Inside myself there is a dream that never dies
This burning fever takes me to the open skies

Now we fly away to find Eternia
Farewell to pain and death, farewell to evil s breath
And as we fly away we'll find Eternia
On through the pouring rain and through the raging flame
We fly towards the sky

Raven wings carry me through pain
Carry me through the wind and rain
When the fever takes control
In my heart and in my soul

Our time has begun and I won't be alone
