[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gimpl]

Welcome my brothers, my comrades of hell
From fire we rose into battle we fell
Out of the nowhere, awakened from sleep
They're sowing their wind but our storm they will reap

Into the neverland, take my hand
We will fight and we will see
The dawn of a new destiny

We're the guardians of the sunrise, we march forevermore
With the providence of victory we're stronger than before
We're the guardians of the sunrise, the keepers of the gate
And we believe in prophecy of fate

Free like an eagle we ride through the sky
From dark clouded valleys to mountains up high
Live by the truth and the power of steel
The night's full of splendour, our swords they will feel

Into the neverland, take my hand
We will fight and we will see
The dawn of a new destiny

We're the guardians of the sunrise, we march forevermore
With the providence of victory we're stronger than before
We're the guardians of the sunrise, the keepers of the gate
And we believe in prophecy of fate

We're the guardians of the sunrise, forever side by side
Even through the flame and thunderstorm and through the deepest night
We're the guardians of the sunrise, on burning wings we fly
'cause Heavy Metal's never gonna die
