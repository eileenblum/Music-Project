[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gimpl]

[Michael:] In the deep of the shadows, when the night begins to fall
[Luzifer:] In the darkness of this world I grow stronger than you all
[Michael:] It's the dawn of a new age, We're the guardians of the light
[Luzifer:] By the wheel of destiny who is wrong and who is right, who will be right

[Michael:]
Evil or divine I feel the force
Fate lies in our hands when we are

[Both:] Going down
[Luzifer:] I'm the one that needs your heart
[Michael:] Here I am, the fallen one into the fire
[Both:] Burn with me
[Michael:] Lost forever s what you are
[Luzifer:] I can see a veil of malice and pride in us all

[Michael:]
There is pain in my heart
It's the final revelation that will tear the world apart
And the day soon will come
When the fate of us all will reveal what we've done

[Luzifer:]
Take these chains off, I never believe
Roam the nightly spheres just like a thief, just like a thief

[Luzifer:]
Do you know why I hate you, why I hate you and your lies
Redemption  is the word you spoke, there is freedom in your eyes
[Michael:]
At the end you will follow, there s a better way to go
If you choose the path of steel It's damnation for your soul

[Michael:]
There is pain in my heart
It's the final revelation that will tear the world apart
And the day soon will come
When the fate of us all will reveal what we've done
[Luzifer:]
Take these chains off, I never believe
Roam the nightly spheres just like a thief, just like a thief

[Luzifer:]
I see the sky is falling
Demons, wolves and shadows crawling
The age of innocence is lost beneath my wings
[Michael:]
Still crying tears of sorrow
Deep inside there s now tomorrow
I fear the future and the sadness that it brings

[Michael:]
There is pain in my heart
It's the final revelation that will tear the world apart
And the day soon will come
When the fate of us all will reveal what we've done
[Luzifer:]
Take these chains off, I never believe
Roam the nightly spheres just like a thief, just like a thief

[Luzifer:]
Rising up from the ground
I will spit upon your cross and I will turn it upside down
Now the whole world is mine
Feed my hunger on the sins and on the hatred of this time
[Michael:]
Every minute a child in disguise
Turns away from the fire in your eyes, the fire in your eyes

Ride with the wind, hymns of freedom we sing
And the dawn has revealed a new day
Now we belong, like a phoenix so strong
To the fire that burns us away
Here for all time, I will stand on the line
I have sworn words of power and steel
Born in the flame, blood of vengeance my name
By the trial of truth you will kneel
