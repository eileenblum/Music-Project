[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gimpl]

Shadows falling down on me to cover land and sky
The eerie wind is howling at the place my brothers lie
Long ago we fought together on the fields of no return
On this soil once flowers grew now flames of hatred burn

Riding on the wings of glory, fight to stay alive
Surrender to the dreams inside your head
Leave behind your sorrows and illuminate your life
Until the steel inside your hand shines red

No more tears in the rain
No more fears, no more pain
When my home and my whole world is burning
No more hope for the lost
No more silence, no cost
Still unbroken for freedom I'm yearning

Onward now my warriors, we fight with no remorse
Sail away, the stars will guide us far to distant shores
Thunder shakes the battlefield the dark defeats the light
'til the last there's no retreat for we stand as one tonight
Riding on the wings of glory, fight to stay alive
Surrender to the dreams inside your head
Leave behind your sorrows and illuminate your life
Until the steel inside your hand shines red

No more tears in the rain
No more fears, no more pain
When my home and my whole world is burning
No more hope for the lost
No more silence, no cost
Still unbroken for freedom I'm yearning
