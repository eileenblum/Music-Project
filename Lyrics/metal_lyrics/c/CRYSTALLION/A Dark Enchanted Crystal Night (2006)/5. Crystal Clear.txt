[Music: Gimpl, Strbler, Herzinger, Juhasz, Schallinger, Stief / Lyrics: Strbler]

Say goodbye, welcome the new
You are the last, you know it's true
Like a gust of wind, so strong
And you know you don't belong

Break the chains and just let go
Shackles of the past no more
Follow me, swim with the tide
Climbing to the stars tonight

Waiting for a miracle (waiting for the fall)
No I'm standing tall
I believe in what I do (you are just a fool)
I won't heed your call

I'm still here, there's no fear
I will never disappear, I am here, crystal clear
Carry on, on my way
There is no more left to say, I am here, crystal clear

See we're marching once again
All following the masterplan
Conformity brings no surprise
can't you see your flame, it dies

Washed away like sand and stone
No way out you are alone
One last chance to see the light
I ll watch you going down tonight

You forget that I am strong (all alone there is no way)
Hear me what I say
So much power left to fight (we all know our way is right)
I don't fear the night

I'm still here, there's no fear
I will never disappear, I am here, crystal clear
Carry on, on my way
There is no more left to say, I am here, crystal clear

I decide what is best for me
I will be forever free
No more lies, I won't hear your cries
It would be the end for me
I decide what is best for me
I will be forever free
No more lies, I won't hear your cries
And there s just one thing left for me and you ll see

I'm still here, there's no fear
I will never disappear, I am here, crystal clear
Carry on, on my way
There is no more left to say, I am here, crystal clear
