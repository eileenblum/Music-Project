[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gimpl]

I know what I believe in
I hope you know it too
Just listen to the call
And you know now what to do
I see my brothers standing
I see them everywhere
The time is right for us
Raise your hands into the air

Living  in a world of danger
With a heart that s full of fire
Just another way to carry on
Gaze into the dragon's eye
It's blinded by desire
Take your chance now children of the sun

We are back, back on the street again
Hold on to your dreams my friend
The burning of bridges it has just begun
Just open your eyes and see
A world far from misery
Our army is rising whatever will come

Drifting through empty spaces
Through clouds and stars
Above the wintersun
Where the mighty dragon flies
The wind blows in our faces
Our hearts are filled with pride
A new age will appear
And the truth is on our side

Living in a world of danger
With a heart that s full of fire
Just another way to carry on
Gaze into the dragon s eye
It's blinded by desire
Take your chance now children of the sun

We are back, back on the street again
Hold on to your dreams my friend
The burning of bridges it has just begun
Just open your eyes and see
A world far from misery
Our army is rising whatever will come

Together, forever, I want it now or never
Tonight the time is right for fighting
The fire, desire, this flight will take you higher
Don't be afraid It's tantalizing
