[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gimpl]

In a dream I saw the burning sky
Like thunder they rode on the wings of despair
On the fields of honour they will die
The kingdom of heaven lies broken and bare

They're calling out my name, with voices full of pain
The magic's gone, it dies in the flame
The bringer of the night, once was the lord of light
He summons up the dark hordes to fight
Fight against the heavens to take their lives

Beware the signs of these visions
Burning deep in my soul in my mind
I see you follow these visions
Great heroes will guide me on my way down
To the fire I'm bound, I'm burning forever
His kingdom will fall to the ground

Dark shadows haunt me in my dreams
A warrior eternal, a master of fate
My sacrifice left unrevealed
The free thoughts of glory are trapped in a maze

Your heart lies in my hand, this kingdom we'll defend
Our battlecry heard throughout the land
The bringer of the night, no longer lord of light
On wings of steel we're ready to fight
Fight against the demons to take their lives

Beware the signs of these visions
Burning deep in my soul in my mind
I see you follow these visions
Great heroes will guide me on my way down
To the fire I'm bound, I'm burning forever
His kingdom will fall to the ground

Oh, hear my calling
Black rain s dropping down from above
The final warning
The essence of life s not enough
I won't surrender
Grant me your bright wings to fly
I'm not a pretender
The signs of freedom on high
High, high in the sky

Oh, can't you see, they're turning on me
On the sins of the mortal they feed
Words full of lies, hear their screams and their cries
By the fear and the pain in their eyes

[Bridge 1]

Beware the signs of these visions
Burning deep in my soul in my mind
I see you follow these visions
Great heroes will guide me on my way down
To the fire I'm bound, I'm burning forever
His kingdom will fall to the ground

And the dragon will return from the sky
To burn down all evil and raise up the forces of light
