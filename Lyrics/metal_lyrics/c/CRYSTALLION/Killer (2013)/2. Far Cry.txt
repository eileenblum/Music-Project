Hey guardian angels
Get you on the track
My body's mangled on a rack
We live on the fast lane
Ready or not
I always take my best shot

I hear you calling my name
As I touch the flames

It's getting rough, it's a far cry
From love
You better stay tough
It's a far cry from love

Listen well now
I've got something to say
Ain't got no need to waste my day
You're here for justice
Won't hear no lies
That's what I see in your eyes

I hear you calling my name
As I touch the flames

It's getting rough, it's a far cry
From love
You better stay tough
It's a far cry from love

Helter skelter as we ride on the tracks
I'm coming  on like a rumbling T.Rex

It's getting rough, it's a far cry
From love
You better stay tough
It's a far cry from love
