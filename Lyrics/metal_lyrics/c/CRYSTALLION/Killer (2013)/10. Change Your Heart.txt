I can hear the rain begins to fall
Lonely on the run I feel so small
When I dream, it's only you I see
Still we're so close, but yet so far
Seems we're so close, but yet so far
Seems we're a hundred miles apart
Can't stop the fire deep in me

Tell me can't you feel
The trembling of the thrill
As time stands still

And I will show you everything
Yes I will change your heart
And I can't deny the words
That hurt so easily
I will change your heart

You say, I tell you nothing else but lies
Can't you see the truth in my eyes
Never hurt you, no I won't, I swear
This feels so good, this can't be wrong
Listen to the magic of this song
Anytime and anywhere

Tell me can't you feel
The trembling of the thrill
As time stands still

And I will show you everything
Yes I will change your heart
And I can't deny the words
That hurt so easily
I will change your heart

Lonely days, they hit me hard
They are terrifying me
Same old ways, right from the start
Won't you please rescue me

Tell me can't you feel
The trembling of the thrill
As time stands still

And I will show you everything
Yes I will change your heart
And I can't deny the words
That hurt so easily
I will change your heart
