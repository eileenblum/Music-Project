Now listen, time is right
I got news for you
The whole world is in move
It seems like there's
A revolutions groove
Hungry, the beast we've made
Nothing you can do
Stronger then before
We're out to beat
This big, fat, rotten whore

We set this town alight
Determined to do right

Ready to strike we are

Action, turn it loose
On your marks, set, go
You're haunted by the beat
Taste the love so hot and bittersweet

The gods of rock 'n' roll will rule
To convert the weak-hearted fool
Taste this love, this infernal sound
Makes you drunk with power

Ready to strike we are

Ready to strike we are
