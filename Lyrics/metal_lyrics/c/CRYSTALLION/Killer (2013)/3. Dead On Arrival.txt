Destination far unknown
We travel through the starlit sky
The air we breathe is clear
While solar beans light up the night

Dimensions pass by as we glide down
Secret spheres
The law of armageddon's here

Dead on arrival

Time has no meaning here
We are caught between two rival worlds
Transition is approaching now
Incantations bring the holy words

Dimensions pass by as we glide down
Secret spheres
The law of armageddon's here

From far away we shall return
The entire world stands at the turn

Dead on arrival
