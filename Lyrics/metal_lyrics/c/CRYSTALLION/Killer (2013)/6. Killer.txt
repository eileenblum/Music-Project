I see her eyes, some kind of blue disguise
I see those eyes watching me
She waits each day for
The night to come her way
'Cause in the night she wants to be

I'm going crazy
I need to scream and yell
She drives me crazy
'Cause I'm under her spell

So come on, she's a killer
So come on, she's a killer
Madness going on, she's a killer
So come on, stone cold killer

Don't give too much
She's got that evil touch
That kind of touch that steals your soul
Tonight, I know
We start the midnight show
For a little shot of rock 'n' roll

I'm going crazy
I need to scream and yell
She drives me crazy
'Cause I'm under her spell

So come on, she's a killer
So come on, she's a killer
Madness going on, she's a killer
So come on, stone cold killer

She's a living keg of dynamite
And her fuse is lightened up tonight

She's a killer
When she's gonna lose control
She's a killer
Madness going on, she's a killer
No, I can't wait too long
She's a killer
