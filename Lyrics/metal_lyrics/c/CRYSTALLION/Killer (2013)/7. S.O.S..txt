I can hear lots of "wise men" talking:
"We all live in a peaceful land!"
Certainly I know that they are wrong
It's the same old jazz, the same old song
I cry:

"S.O.S, save our souls!
Don't you believe, we're in danger!"

In our schools there is hate and violence
Panic sneaks through our darkened streets
We must wake up now to see the truth
What is wrong with this hateful youth
I cry:

"S.O.S, save our souls!
Don't you believe, we're in danger!"

Who's calling the shots
Who knows now what to do
We're reaching the point of no return
We're close to the end
Our kids cry out for help
When push comes to shove, they will burn

S.O.S, I'm calling out

Who's calling the shots
Who knows now what to do
We're reaching the point of no return
We're close to the end
Our kids cry out for help
When push comes to shove, they will burn
