Watch us, we come from secret nooks
We're envoys from ancient times
Listen, a strange tongue speaks to you
It whispers in magic rhymes

Don't ignore the warning
Calling out for you
Realize now what we've got to do

I know that we are the unwanted
I know, believe in the unwanted

Fate lies in the palm of my hand
The weak will be blown away
We've come to clean and to mend
Before you've been led astray

The origin of fire burning in our eyes
Hells inferno's coming from the skies

I know that we are the unwanted
I know, believe in the unwanted
