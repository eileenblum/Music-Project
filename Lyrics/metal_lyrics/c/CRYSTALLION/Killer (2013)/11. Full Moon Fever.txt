Dark eyes on mainstreet watch you and me
Fatal attraction, insanity
No need for hiding from those city lights
The prowler's waiting, he sniffs and he bites

I've got your full moon fever
So hot, so real
I've got your full moon fever
I like what I feel
I've got your full moon fever
A dangerous deal
I've got your full moon fever

In unknown places, far from nosy eyes
A new breed's rising, losing disguise
If you're out alone now
Down in the woods
Make sure your bag is filled
With some silver goods

I've got your full moon fever
So hot, so real
I've got your full moon fever
I like what I feel
I've got your full moon fever
A dangerous deal
I've got your full moon fever

Don't run for cover
Don't you try no more
Marsha is still around
She's knocking at your door

I've got your full moon fever
So hot, so real
I've got your full moon fever
I like what I feel
I've got your full moon fever
A dangerous deal
I've got your full moon fever
