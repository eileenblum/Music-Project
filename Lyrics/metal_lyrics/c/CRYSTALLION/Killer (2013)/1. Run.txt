Can you see the crack in the sky
Can you hear the thunder inside
It's calling you
Evil lurks in every corner
A red alert will sound to warn ya:
"Emergency!"

Better run and hide
We're like dynamite

Run to the light
You've got to run all the time
Better run from the night
We've got to run 'til you're mine

Don't believe a word that they say
They will try to take you away
On wings of steel
On the prowl I'm waiting for you
Noone ever knows what we do
It's ecstasy

Better run and hide
We're like dynamite

Run to the light
You've got to run all the time
Better run from the night
We've got to run 'til you're mine

Hold on, time's right
Run for your life child
Stay strong, stay wild
Run for your life child
Run for your life

Run to the light
You've got to run all the time
Better run from the night
We've got to run 'til you're mine
