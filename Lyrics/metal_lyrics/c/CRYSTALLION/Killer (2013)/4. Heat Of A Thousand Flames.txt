Awakened in a dream I saw the dark
Found myself while strolling
Through the park
From afar I see her lovely eyes
Oh no, she's the devil in disguise

Woke up in a sea of lies
Destiny took me by surprise
I'm caught in your web of reins
It hurts me like
The heat of a thousand flames

Dressed in blackened lace
She smiles at me
I'm just that kind of man
She wants for free
Is there any way to break this spell
Or do I add myself this living Hell

Woke up in a sea of lies
Destiny took me by surprise
I'm caught in your web of reins
It hurts me like
The heat of a thousand flames

I don't know her name
Ain't this a fool's game
We're both together
Now and forever

Woke up in a sea of lies
Destiny took me by surprise
I'm caught in your web of reins
It hurts me like
The heat of a thousand flames
