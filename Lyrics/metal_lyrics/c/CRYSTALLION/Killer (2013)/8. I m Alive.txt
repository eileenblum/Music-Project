When I face my own inner stranger
And I know I can't fight the danger
Until the weight ain't getting any lighter
It's for sure, I'll better be a fighter

Can't believe it, I will feel it
The heat of this time
Now I need it, what a feeling
No words can describe

Everything I've done seems overrated
In a world, so perfectly created
Yes I know, it's my life that I'm living
What I take, is always what I'm giving

Can't believe it, I will feel it
The heat of this time
Now I need it, what a feeling
No words can describe

I'm alive, still alive

Running down this endless road to freedom
I won't stop for nothing and for no one
Time to break the chains of indecision
But it ain't no more than just a vision

Can't believe it, I will feel it
The heat of this time
Now I need it, what a feeling
No words can describe

I'm alive, still alive
