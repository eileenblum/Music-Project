Hear the one with a bad reputation
A revolution's call
They are caught in a strange situation
But now their leaders fall
Religious zeal has brought oppression
To purify the land
What's the price to control the masses
With an iron hand

And we're down and out
Who wants to scream and shout again
Play it loud, won't you play it to the end
I'm ready, I'm ready for the...

Woh-oh, hear the call from
The cities to the grove
Woh-oh, the world is crying:
"Push comes to shove!"

Push! Push! Tear up the chains of war
Push! Push! As you have done before
I'm ready, I'm ready for the...

Woh-oh, hear the call from
The cities to the grove
Woh-oh, the world is crying:
"Push comes to shove!"

Woh-oh, your death is certain
Coming form high above
Woh-oh, to every nation:
"Push comes to shove!"
