I am the brave, the rider in the storm
I am the rear of the elite
Under the sign of freedom I was born
Faith is my armour, pride my shield

But I had a dream, our nation's free
The veils of death, embracing me
Inside this dream, our nation's free
Follow the call of victory

I have fought a hundred wars
I fought for France and never against
The soldiers fire, my last command
They call me brave, I will be to the grave

I saw the sunrise, I saw the rainbow in the sky
There is nothing left for me to believe
Goodbye my brothers, goodbye my friends who shared this life
All has changed now, this world I must leave

But I had a dream, our nation's free
The veils of death, embracing me
Inside this dream, our nation's free
Follow the call of victory

I have fought a hundred wars (I'm going nowhere)
I fought for France and never against (I wanna be there)
The soldiers fire, my last command (The soldiers fire)
They call me brave, I will be to the grave

Long ago our nation calls, set sails to foreign shores
With the glory of Napoleon we're bound for holy wars
Now I take my final journey to the land up in the sky
The time has come for me to say goodbye

I have fought a hundred wars (I'm going nowhere)
I fought for France and never against (I wanna be there)
The soldiers fire, my last command (The soldiers fire)
They call me brave, I will be to the grave

I have fought a hundred wars (I'm burning, I'm dying, I'm going nowhere)
I fought for France and never against (I'm yearning, I'm flying, I wanna be there)
The soldiers fire, my last command (The soldiers fire)
They call me brave, I will be to the grave
