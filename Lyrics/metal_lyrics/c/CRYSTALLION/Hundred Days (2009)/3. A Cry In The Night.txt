Headless, a dark fate lies ahead
Compounding the unknown
No doubt, the madman must be dead
Wherever he may roam

Watch out, what evil do you hide
Behind your masquerade
Welcome, the ball opens tonight
And still it's not too late

Join the armies of Arthur
We will answer the call
Soldiers stand for departure
Bring the Frenchmen to fall

A cry in the night, comes straight from the heart
So far from the light that scares off the dark
A cry in the night, a voice in the black
There's nowhere to hide, we're under attack
A cry in the night

Madness, Napoleon's back again
He tries to rule the world
Face them, at Ligny it will end
Our voices can be heard
Join the armies of Arthur
We will answer the call
Soldiers stand for departure
Bring the Frenchmen to fall

A cry in the night, comes straight from the heart
So far from the light that scares off the dark
A cry in the night, a voice in the black
There's nowhere to hide, we're under attack
A cry in the night
