The sound of guns
Shall draw you near
No way, my orders have been clear

Wait for them to come, they will be crushed
No mercy from our side
Withdrawing to the sunken lane for now
Cuirassiers are caught it seems the enemy is gaining ground
Can't give in to Somerset's brigade

Under heavy fire, our prospects dire
Answer charge by a counter-attack
All my infantry, proudly fight for me
Must be quick or our foes will prevail

See their retreat
Our steel they'll meet
Right now our cavalry we need

Squares to be protected
Our artillery will do the rest
Trampling hooves won't do us any harm
The French they are not close enough
The Dutch are fighting on our side
At Mont St Jean ridge they're bound to fall

Under heavy fire, our prospects dire
Answer charge by a counter-attack
All my infantry, proudly fight for me
Must be quick or our foes will prevail
