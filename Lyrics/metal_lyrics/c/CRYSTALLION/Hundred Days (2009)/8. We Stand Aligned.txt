Ride all your horses till we see the night
On this battlefield we will be shining bright
Crush these damn squares, fight with all of our might
On this day let me say, there's just black and white

Now also Prussians have finally arrived
Joining forces they are, now it's getting tight
Young Guard won't last till the darkness of night
My Old Guard now shall be the last shining light

All of these men bravest of all the brave
Could it be over today

Stand aligned - as one man we fight the French
Stand aligned - we're not falling here today
Stand aligned - over dusty roads we ride
Stand aligned - seeds of peace we now sow

See their confusion they finally retreat
They are fleeing but it's just death they'll meet
Now we are here on their road of retreat
The last hope that they had, now enemy bleed

Now last resort his Imperial Guard
Far outnumbered they are, now they've gone too far
All of our troops start the general advance
We're victorious, now let your horses prance

Exiled and beaten, a danger no more
Rejoice at what we have done

Stand aligned - as one man we fight the French
Stand aligned - we're not falling here today
Stand aligned - over dusty roads we ride
Stand aligned - seeds of peace we now sow

Joining forces for our goal
Victory on our mind
With English troops we stand aligned
The Old Guard will not bring us down
Always one step behind
While on our side we stand aligned
