And another battle won, decision is now overdue
The Prussians cowardly retreat will not save their souls, they're bound to fall
Grouchy will chase them all the way to seal their destiny, they won't prevail
Our nation, I know, glorious will be, Napoleon standing tall for all to see, tall for all to see

Fight! Our army's weak
Now! Bravest soldiers though
Right! The Prussians on our side
Run! We will strike a blow
For them! Beginning of the end
Down! The French don't know our plans
Rule! At the elm tree I'll command
All! Fight with dignity

Fight with dignity for all of us!

He will go down into the fire
What keeps us strong is our desire
To be free, we will aspire
He's flying high, we're flying higher

Nations falling
Nations falling
Death is calling
At Waterloo they're falling

Shine! Today the sun will rise
Mine! For those who shall succeed
Here! A field of consequence
Now! For those who face defeat
Rise! The coalition troops
Attack! Must not falter, no
Stand! Keep on fighting now
Prevail! Our freedom to defend

Our freedom we all will defend!

Waterloo seems to be the place
Where we will win this epic battle
Waterloo, sight of giant's race
The Frenchman finally will be falling

Nations falling
Nations falling
Death is calling
At Waterloo they're falling
