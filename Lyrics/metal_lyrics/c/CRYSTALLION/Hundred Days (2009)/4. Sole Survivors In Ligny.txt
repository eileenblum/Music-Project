Now he is leaving and we're on our own
Soldiers of Prussia will conquer the throne
From the windmill of Brye I will see how they die
And when Europe is freed yeah the Frenchmen will bleed

Ney cannot help him he's too far away
Is this the reason for Napoleon's delay
Now they move to attack, no mistake we must make
For our freedom we fight, strike with all of our might

I - hear the canons from afar
Mine - is Ligny and Quatre Bras

The Prussian troops are giving way - no retreat
They must face their defeat
Before the night falls we will be - we will be
Sole survivors in Ligny

His own intervention will not save their lives
Ligny's on fire, more artillery arrives
One last counter-attack we have now driven back
It's Gerard and the Guard who are hitting them hard

Die - for a realm that's doomed to fail
I - am the one that they will hail

The Prussian troops are giving way - no retreat
They must face their defeat
Before the night falls we will be - we will be
Sole survivors in Ligny

A shot at his horse sent him down to the ground
Buried by his own beast in the mud
Injured and reeling he's borne from the field
Their offensive now under control
