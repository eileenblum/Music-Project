The first of March, I'm back again, it's 1815
Louis tries to claim my rights, just a fact I have foreseen
One by one my army grows as we march towards Paris
The king has fled, we're gathered here, our victory it is

Now I'm back on the throne of France
The royalists are on defence
Fight, brothers we fight
Raise my flag on sacred ground
Take the crown and sing out loud
You my children, my country, my pride

Now the time has come to make the world all your own
You're never alone
See, see what they've done, in this one moment of hope
Still we stand here unbent and defiant
He's awakened: the sleeping giant

The Allies wanna end my reign with fire, sword and shield
150.000 men they put into the field
But still I'm yearning
The world is burning down
Our fate is turning
They've declared me an outlaw again

Now the time has come to make the world all your own
You're never alone
See, see what they've done, in this one moment of hope
Still we stand here unbent and defiant
He's awakened: the sleeping giant

Join our forces, be our men
Fight the good fight, stand aligned till the end
For our land
Lead and powder, keep it dry
March to Belgium, through the night we will fly
They will die

Now the time has come to make the world all your own
You're never alone
See, see what they've done, in this one moment of hope
Still we stand here unbent and defiant
He's awakened: the sleeping giant
