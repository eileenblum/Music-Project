I can't see what is going n
On these fields here where I belong
Riders tell me what's going on
Will we soon hear our victory song

Rumour has it they're coming soon
My own brother has told me so
Oh Jerome onward you will go
While Grouchy drives the Prussians away

The splendour of France

I don't fear Wellington
This battle will be won
We'll prevail and his bad English troops we'll defeat - today!

First attack shall be Hougoumont
Their reserves will be overrun
Later on we will separate
English troops from the Prussian ones

Now the house stands in flames
My battalions will tear down the walls
Seems like Wellington's strong, won't give in - we shall see

I don't fear Wellington
This battle will be won
We'll prevail and his bad English troops we'll defeat - today!
