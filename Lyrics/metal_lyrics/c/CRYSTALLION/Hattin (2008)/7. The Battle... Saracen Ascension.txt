[The Christian knights surrounded by the Saracen enemy]
Turan is lost, no retreat
The heathens we'll meet
Not one drop to drink
The spring without reach

Now surrounded by foes
On this damn plateau
This camp is no longer safe

Running out of supplies
Arrows go down
Blinded by smoke we march
Still we go on

[Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem]
Losing faith, our knights defecting - it's our kings disgrace

[The knights]
This battle is over - we're beaten and lost
There is nowhere to go
Crusaders defeated - the Holy Land's lost
Christians down on the ground

[Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem]
Raymond's charges in vain
There's nothing to gain
Cut off from the rest
Men and horses were slain

Defections in droves
The only ones brave
The knights of the orders alone

[The fleeing knights]
Not more than 3000 men we are
Who are fleeing the fields of death
Escape from the heathen's grasp
Led by count Raymond and Balian
Attacked by the blazing sun
We are on our way home

[Raymond II of Tripoli]
Charging on Saladin
Again and again
But it's all over now
When the tent falls

[The knights]
This battle is over - we're beaten and lost
There is no way to go
Crusaders defeated - the Holy Land's lost
Christians down on the ground

Saracen Ascension - our kingdom is gone
We are down on our knees
We will rise again - we will return
Beat them once and for all

"Only a small number of Crusaders survived the battle at the Horns of Hattin.
Those who didn't die or flee from the battlefield were captured, among them former King Guy of Lusignan, Gerard of Ridefort, Raynald of Chatillon and many others.
In the meantime, Richard I Lionheart, King of England, supported by the pope, was already preparing another crusade, swearing to regain the Holy Land for the sake of Christianity."
