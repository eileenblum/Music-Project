[Sultan Saladin]
Christian greed brings them death
My caravan's lost, I see
A rush of blood to my head - it's deafening me
Can't let them go, it's my duty, they died for me
It's Raynald's will, I don't know is this meant to be
There is no way out for me - it's killing me
My army shall rise, Christian downfall we'll see

They have reigned the Holy Land
Jerusalem in Christian hand
Shameful fields of Montgisard
Will the Sultan rise again
There's no doubt we will regain
Our old glory, we shall rise

After all - hear me scream, hear me scream
Battles taking their toll, open the gates

[Sultan Saladin's forces]
Now the war is at hand, we will regain our land
Our people and our Muslim faith we'll defend - To battle we ride
It's their final crusade
Our feud will be brought to an end here and now

[Sultan Saladin]
20000 Eastern men
Will bring back Jerusalem
No Knights Templar will remain
Under Saladin the Great
Muslim states retaliate
Guy of Lusignan will fall

One more time - hear me scream, hear me scream
Battles taking their toll, open the gates

[Sultan Saladin's forces]
Now the war is at hand, we will regain our land
Our people and our Muslim faith we'll defend - To battle we ride
It's their final crusade
Our feud will be brought to an end here and now

It's our destiny to fight
Christian hordes won't see the night
In the end, will we be right?
It's not us who want this war
One more battle, then no more
We will rule just like before

After all - hear me scream, hear me scream
Battles taking their toll, open the gates

[Sultan Saladin's forces]
Now the war is at hand, we will regain our land
Our people and our Muslim faith we'll defend - To battle we ride
It's their final crusade
Our feud will be brought to an end here and now

"To lure King Guy into moving his army out of the town of Sephoria, an oasis with indispensable water supplies, Saladin besieged Count Raymond's fortress of Tiberias on July 2nd.
The town was plundered and burned, while Raymond's wife remained besieged in the citadel. "
