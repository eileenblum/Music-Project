[Sultan Saladin]
Onward the Christians go
It's hard to believe that they did what I hoped for
They can't win this fight
It's Saracen sunrise, the Crusaders' sundown
They won't stand a chance
Attacked by brave men

Now their fate it is sealed
We will crush them they're damned for all time
At home they will tell them 'bout Saladin, all his glory and pride

[The Muslim army]
Hattin brings down the Crusaders
Muslims triumphant we will vanquish our foe
Charge after charge we will counter
Saladin's army in new glory shall rise
Forever we'll be - higher than the sky

[Sultan Saladin]
Cut off from water and blinded by fire
These noble knights, they defect out of fear
Telling their secrets, their dire situation
Facing his downfall, their king's gonna crawl

[The Muslim army]
Now we are the ones who will rule again
Saladin stands above all
We cannot forgive the Christian invaders
Who struggle to take our land

[The Muslim army]
Hattin brings down the crusaders
Muslims triumphant we will vanquish our foe
Charge after charge we will counter
Saladin's army in new glory shall rise
Forever we'll be

[The Muslim army]
Now we are the ones who will rule again
Saladin stands above all
We cannot forgive the Christian invaders
Who struggle to take our land

[The Muslim army]
Hattin brings down the Crusaders
Muslims triumphant we will vanquish our foe
Charge after charge we will counter
Saladin's army in new glory shall rise
Forever we'll be

[Sultan Saladin]
Rightful rulers of these lands
We've spilled too much blood
Our reign will be one based on faith in our God
Christian forces surrender, their final retreat
Is just hours ahead, they must face their defeat
Most of them slain, reinforcements they need
So their king must be wise and give in

"Guy's decision to take Saladin's bait and start heading for Tiberias proved to be a fatal mistake.
Saladin, who had expected that move, sent troops around the Crusader army, blocking their line of retreat and separating them from their water supplies.
Despite their fierce resistance the Crusaders finally had to face defeat.
While most of the Christian army met with death on July 4th on the fields of Hattin, some were captured and some could even flee to herald the news of the Saracen rising... "
