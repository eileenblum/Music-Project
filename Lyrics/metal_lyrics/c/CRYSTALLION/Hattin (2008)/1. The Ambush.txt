Syria, Palestine: In the year of our Lord 1187. The territories occupied by the Latins under Guy of Lusignan,
King of Jerusalem and the united realms of the Ayyubids under Sultan Saladin were keeping an unstable truce.
Knowing that this truce could be broken by the pettiest trespass Lord Raynald of Chatillon, a confident of the King,
regularly attacked and plundered Muslim caravans.
These misdeeds driven by pride, hatred and greed provoked the single greatest catastrophe in the history of the crusades and sealed the beginning of the end of Christian reign in Outremer.
A reign based on faith, courage, honour and glory, carried throughout the land on blazing wings of thunder.

"In the year 1177 the Crusaders had defeated Saladin's forces at the Battle of Montgisard.
What ensued was a truce which was repeatedly broken by the Christian king's ally Raynald of Chatillon who attacked peaceful Muslim caravans without any obvious reason.
Longing for war he couldn't foresee that his actions would trigger the beginning of the end of the Christian dominance over the Holy Land. "
