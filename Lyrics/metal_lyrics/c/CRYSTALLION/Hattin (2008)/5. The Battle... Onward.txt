[Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem]
Out of Sephoria
On July 3rd we are
The vanguard glorious
Our rearguard pray for us
We will reach Tiberias
Nine more painful miles, alas!

[The Christian army]
We will prevail (onward we go!!!)
Our glorious king we hail
Onward! The battlefield
Shall be our grave

[Count Raymond III. of Tripoli]
Our kingdom soon will fade
They say no man ever made
Such a distance in one day
Saladin is drawing near
Muslim warcries we can hear
Christian knights must show no fear

[Gerard of Ridefort, Grandmaster of the Knights Templar]
Till our last breath we march
The slaughter can begin
For our kingdom and for our king
Into battle our old hymns we sing
By the hawks, our infantry's pride
All for one and one for all!

[Count Raymond III. of Tripoli]
Our kingdom soon will fade
They say no man ever made
Such a distance in one day
Saladin is drawing near
Muslim warcries we can hear
Christian knights must show no fear

[Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem]
The time is near, it's crystal clear
No-one give in, no man we fear
Its time to fight, before the night
Will lay its coat upon this field

[Count Raymond III. of Tripoli]
Marching - Marching till the end of time
Can it be God's will?
Will we be burning for a senseless crime
Some wounds time won't heal

[Chorus]

"Saladin was watching every move the Crusaders made and realized that their decision to start heading for Tiberias after an already exhausting march over several miles could give his army the crucial edge which could determine the outcome of the battle.
Vested with their firm belief the Muslim forces tightend the noose around the Christians' necks."
