Weâre all at war with an enemy
Itâs human nature to be scared in this fight
Deep down inside, Iâll bring out the best in you
Iâll tell you every little thing
That you donât want to hear
And Iâll drag you out to the depths
To remove that fear

Time after time you realize
That every second counts
And every moment

Past, present, and future
Iâll be the demon that will show you everything in life

Itâs time to recognize every little thing that youâve done
You gotta roll the dice
And take that gamble on life (gamble on life)

We are the ones that lost our way
Bound by these choices that tell these tales
We are the ones that lost our way
Bound by these choices

We get scared and jump ship
Weâre living each moment as a lie
We get scared and jump ship
Weâre living each moment as a lie
As a lie

Things are getting harder
Things are getting a little bit faster
Things are getting harder
Things are getting that little bit faster
Itâs time to rise above

The nightmare wonât end until you wake up
So fucking wake up
