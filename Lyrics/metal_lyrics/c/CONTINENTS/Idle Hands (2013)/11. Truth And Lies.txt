Donât let go of these thoughts
Now someone please help me bury them alive

(I'll leave) Now Iâll leave these ashes behind me (behind me)

Weâll leave these ashes
Weâll burn everything in sight

Iâll be here beside you
With every waking site
So tread carefully
Take a breath of this fresh air, and understand my mind
âCause I never said
I never said it was right
To be a fucking fool like me
I canât seem to understand this fucking head
All these dreams and all these thoughts
Are fucking tearing me apart

I canât seem to understand this fucking head
All these dreams and all these thoughts
Are fucking tearing me apart
Are fucking tearing me apart

I chose the path I walk
And I have no regrets
I chose the path I walk
And I have no regrets

Weâll leave these ashes
Weâll burn everything in sight

Iâll be here beside you
With every waking site
So tread carefully
Take a breath of this fresh air, and understand my mind
âCause I never said
I never said it was right

Now this is a turning point for me in my life
Through every broken glass I survived
Now I will never wear my heart on my chest
Until I confess

I never said it was...
