Weâre all held down by anchors
Our bodies ache from the poison
They fed us, they fed us
The further you dig the more youâll find out
Now open your eyes to open your mind
To what is around us now

Time is fading
Questions are being asked
What is on their minds?

Theyâre out of sight but control whatâs around us
Theyâve taken deathâs job into their hands
A corrupted life
Thatâs all weâve seen
Full of lies and tragedy

(And if they have their way)
And if they have their way
Weâre all gonna die

Weâre all gonna die if they have their way
And we donât stick together
Weâre all gonna die if they have their way
And we donât stick together

We lay as broken souls
Waiting for your lies to break through
We lay as broken souls
Waiting for your lies

This is not the end
Itâs not order out of chaos
Thereâs no peace in the world
No hope for the people
âCause we live in fear
For those who are watching us make a stand

If we make a stand we can be as one
If we make a stand we can be as one
If we make a stand we can be as one
If we make a stand we can be as one
If we make a stand we can be as one
If we make a stand we can be as one
