If youâre not dreaming
Then youâre just sleeping
If youâre not dreaming
Then youâre just sleeping

Iâll climb the highest mountain
Iâll swim across the seas
For this dream I always thought was out of reach

From the bottom of my heart
Fuck you
Youâll never know what this means to me

We were cast aside
Thrown to the waves
To fend for ourselves
To live another day

You are the force that drives me on
I built all this all upon your foundation
And thatâs something Iâll never forget
I will never forget that
You are the force that drives me on
I built all this upon your foundation
And thatâs something Iâll never forget
I will never forget

Cast aside
Thrown to the waves
To fend for ourselves
To live another day
We will stand strong
Never divided
This victory
Will be one for the books

Oh God, will you fix these broken wings
So I can hold my head up high
Oh God, will you fix these broken wings
So I can hold my head up high
