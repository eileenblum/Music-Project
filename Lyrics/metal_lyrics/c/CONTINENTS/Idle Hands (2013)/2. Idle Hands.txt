[feat. Ben Morgan]I, I've become everything you despise (you despise)
I, I will stand against the odds
We will stand against the odds

There will always be heartache that no one can heal
This kingdom's coming
Our time is slipping away
You stand up and preach to me
What the fuck do I believe?

Fuck
Do you not hear my words?
Give me an answer
I have nothing to believe
These years seem wasted

Get up on your feet
For I won't stand alone
We will prevail
Stand up and speak aloud
We will not fail
It's our time to rise
It's our time to rise

We will not fail
It's our time to rise

God can you help us?
God can you help us?
Why don't you listen?
Why don't you listen?
Or do you even exist?

Show us everything
Tell us everything
It's about time you made us believe
Show us everything
Tell us everything
It's about time you made us believe
You made us believe

The scars we carry all tell a story
Is there anything past this grave that we dig?

These visions are burning my eyes
There's blood on my hands
This whole life's a lie
Please save me now

Burn this empire down
But where do I begin?
Burn this empire down
But where do I begin?
