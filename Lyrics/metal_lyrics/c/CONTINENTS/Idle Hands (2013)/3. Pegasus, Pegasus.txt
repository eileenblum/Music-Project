[feat. Paul Williams Of Desolated]Weâve suffered these consequences, lived our lives
Weâve witnessed regret for the very first time
Weâve lived our lives and weâve witnessed regret

Love her
You know itâs right, but maybe itâll be just fine
You want her
You think itâs tough, carrying all of these scars inside
âCause you love her
You know itâs right, but maybe itâll be just fine
You want her
You think itâs tough, carrying all of these scars inside
Itâll be alright
At the end of the night

Donât believe the suffering
Donât believe the hype
Just acknowledge its presence
And its existence

You stood so strong, always by my side
Once upon a time
You canât bring me down (bring me down)

Love her
You know itâs right, but maybe itâll be just fine
You want her
You think itâs tough, carrying all of these scars inside
âCause you love her
You know itâs right, but maybe itâll be just fine
You want her
You think itâs tough, carrying all of these scars inside

Fuck

I hate the way you chat so much shit
I hate the way you stick around
Look at me, youâre a waste of time
Let me say you fucked, fucked this life
Fucked this life

Weâve suffered these consequences, lived our lives
Weâve witnessed regret, for the very first time
Weâve both made mistakes and every fucking time
You keep passing the blame
But Iâve accepted mine
