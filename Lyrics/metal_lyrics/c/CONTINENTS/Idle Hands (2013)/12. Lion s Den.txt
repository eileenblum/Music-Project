Iâm in the lionâs den again
I find myself searching for a cave
Where I can lay my head
And rest these thoughts
To release this rage

I promised myself
I would never go back to my ways
This is the reaperâs way
My darkest days
My darkest days

Iâve got a lot on my mind
That I canât seem to hide
This body aches and this mind is broken
Iâve got a lot on my mind
That I canât seem to hide
I need to find a new direction now

I canât seem to breathe anymore
I can't seem to breathe anymore

Push your face into mine
Tell me it'll be fine
Push your face into mine
Tell me it'll be fine

Iâm in the lionâs den again
I find myself searching for a cave
Where I can lay my head
And rest these thoughts
To release this rage, release this rage
Release this rage
Release this rage
Release this rage

I canât seem to breathe

Analyze this face
Analyze these expectations
Realize that I donât give a fuck
Youâre fucking disgrace
