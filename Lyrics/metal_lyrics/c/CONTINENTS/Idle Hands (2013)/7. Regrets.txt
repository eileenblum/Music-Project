[feat. Ben Morgan]Youâre forever leaving me in the dark
Iâm forever feeling that youâre tearing me apart

Can you not see what youâre doing to me?
âCause Iâm not feeling myself anymore

These things you do and say
Are making me lose this faith
Can you not see
That Iâm walking on broken fucking glass?

These words I speak are tame for what I see
You brought out the demon inside of me
Now welcome to hell
Welcome to hell

Iâm not feeling myself anymore
These things you do and say
Are making me (making me) lose this faith

I walk these backstreets
I am never afraid
You took everything I had
Now I suggest you change your ways
Change
Change your ways
Look at me now
Change your ways

A life without control is not what I wanted
I regret not saying what I needed
I promised myself I would see this through
I promised myself I would see this through
I regret not saying what I needed
A life without control is not what I wanted

I regret not saying what I needed
I regret, regret
