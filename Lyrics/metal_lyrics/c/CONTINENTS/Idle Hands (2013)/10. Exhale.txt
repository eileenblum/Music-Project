Memories in the making
Everything is set on course
Our hopes and dreams are laying the way
We jumped ship and set our path
We cannot be grounded
We cannot be held
We cannot be held

People change, people hate
But they need to understand
That we will be the same
And that weâll never change
We are who we are
And we will stay the same
And we will never change
Never change
We will never change

Bring it
This is the undertow
Weâre gonna fight our way back through it all
This is the undertow
Weâre gonna fight our way back through it all

Itâs us against the odds
These chains canât hold us down
Canât hold us down

We chose to cut ourselves free (down)
From the expectations of those (hold us down)
Who refuse to believe in us

Youâre gonna be my history
Youâre gonna be my memories
My history
My fucking memories
My fucking history
Motherfucker
