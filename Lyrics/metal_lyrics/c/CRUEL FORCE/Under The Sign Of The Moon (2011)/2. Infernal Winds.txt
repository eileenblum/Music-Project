Occult disaster Hell Unleashed
Sabbatic circle feast the beast
Eternal burning child of sin
Horrific vengeance dwells within

Exploding mayhem all around
Battered angels hit the ground
Horns of chaos firelord
Resounding terror demon roar

Possessed by infernal winds
Raging inferno begins
Striking down with fire and flame
Ending in dust soon unveiled

Born of fire winds of lust
Infernal slaughter destroying gust
Flames of hell adorn the land
Obeying to the master's hand

Mountains burst they split the crust
Unholy storm the raging thrust
Fist of torture upon the world
Until the final torch is burned

Earth scorched final plea
Only darkness and hate to be
Troops of Hades sstorm the walls
Massacre inside the halls
Cult of madness reign the night
As the pyres burn so bright
World in ash the flames have won
Bringing down the crown of thorn
