Smoldered ruins where life has ceased
Bear the marks of the deceased
Painful silence no song is sung
Howling spirits their bodies hung

Yet on the gallows the raven cries
The wind it rattles the bones tonight
Of broken bodies in open tombs
As the skulls are lit up by full moon

Lo and behold
Lifeless souls Lying cold
The gallows prayer

Vomitor â Bass
GG Alex â Drums
Teutonic Slaughter â Guitars
Carnivore â Vocals
