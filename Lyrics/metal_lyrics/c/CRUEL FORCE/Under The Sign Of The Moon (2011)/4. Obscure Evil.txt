At the gates of hell
With the black magic rites
Where the throne of darkness
Destroys every light
Total desecration
Satan spreads his wings
Black death reigning
Final slaughter

Obscure demons raging from hell
Forcing the land with spell
Pandemoniums sacrifice
Iron Fist will rule the night

Obscure Evil

Burn the last candle
Of madness and reprise
For the lord of evil
With strange aeons eyes
Cruelty
Oh so nice
Burning angels
Fallen wings

Obscure demons raging from hell
Forcing the land with spell
Pandemoniums sacrifice
Iron Fist will rule the night

Obscure Evil

Burning angels
Falling down on earth
While the throne of might
Reigns the land
Black death
Spreads everywhere

Obscure demons raging from hell
Forcing the land with spell
Pandemoniums sacrifice
Iron Fist will rule the night

Obscure Evil
