The full moon is Rising
and closed is the black oath
with chants of revelation
The horsemen are on their way
Through the Fields and forest
Death is what they prey
Feel the winds of Mayhem
Which guide you to the gate

The rites of Darkness
the candles the cross
the sorcery of evil
which leads you to your death

The lust of Black Possession
The wings of Funeral
The throne of Dark Desires
Under the Sign of the moon

Obsessed by occult psalms
Ancient knowledge of morbid lust
Raping the lords virgins
and drinking the wine of sin
Tyranny over the land
Where the emperors once stand
Dark Triumph is near

Oh dark lord we summon you
Guide us with your satanic majesty
We set heaven afire and raped the holy land
We worship you and bring you the final sacrifice
Please let our choirs heard forevermore
