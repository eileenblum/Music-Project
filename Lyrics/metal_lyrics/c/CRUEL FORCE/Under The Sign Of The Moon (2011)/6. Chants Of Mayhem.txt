In a trance of vitriol
Spewing out the words of scorn
Crush the dogma embrace the night
Enjoying lust's ferocious bite

Tantalizing sacrifize
Ritualistic suicide
Sordid madness doomed to die
Lifeless figures petrified

Dance of swords
Winds of plague
The spell of the damned
The necromancer's 
Chants of mayhem

Sadistic slaughter from fangs of black
Feel enthralling throes of death
Forgotten wisdom of ghostly foes
Sacramental thunderstorm

Venomous infectious
Drinkning wine of poisoned lust
The ritual knife adorned with blood
Of the one the whore begot

Sorcery of the mound
Witchery unbound
Incantations transcend
Chants of mayhem
Invoking death
