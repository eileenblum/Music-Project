In the valley of Hades
Where the mist darknes the day
You can hear the call of the wild
Where the witching hour never ends

The fiery pits awaits
What once was forgotten
The return of Lord Satan's 
Hellish reign

Darkness and evil awaits equinox
Black witch of beauty soon will die

Torches burned the stake
Smoke fille dthe air
Screams from the vault
Demons rape

Black witch of beauty
Enchanted our land
Bent before the altar 
Of lust

Darkness and evil awaits equinox
Black witch of beauty soon will die

Oh beauty of doom
Tonight we're obsessed with you
Silently our hearts cry
Before we're killing you
