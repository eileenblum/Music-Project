Our steel is blessed
With the spell of the dead
Seeking for the victory
Of hells revenge

Guardians of the night
Light the sky
And drink the blood
Raise the sword
And march with the horde

Black oath of death

Fire and smoke
The smell of death
Rotten souls
All the enemies of the oath
Must die

Kill the women
Rape their bodies
Fight with pride
Let the sound of steel
Rule the night

Forging the steel in lord Satan's name
While drinking the blood of the sacrificed ones
Lighting the crucifix with blasphemic lust
Kneel in front of the dark throne of rust
