Violent forces shake the ground
Earth explodes - a rumbling sound
Up from hell I rise tonight
To bring fear and show my might
I'm the Exucutioner
Axe will smash your head

Bloody steel shines in the night
Endless vengeance on my mind
Holy men will feel my wrath
Let them taste my fiery breath
I cast up unholy fire
Burn you to the last

Satan - be my guide
War - on mankind
Crush - no remorse
I am - the cruel force

Tyrant's force will never die
Burn the crosses they held high
Smash their dreams and crush their hope
Hang them high upon a rope
See them tremble, see them fall
Watch them cry in fear

Hellish torment rules your town
Grab the monks right by their gown
Throw them on the burning pile
Virgin nuns are next in line
Sacrifice them to the lord
Down on Hades steps

Satan - be my guide
War - on mankind
Crush - no remorse
I am - the cruel force

City's ruined, burned to dust
I've fulfilled the devil's lust
But the world is yet to fall
So my brothers head the call
No remorse for christian pigs
Burn their churches down

Satan - be my guide
War - on mankind
Crush - no remorse
I am - the cruel force

Satan - be my guide
War - on mankind
Crush - no remorse
I am - the cruel force
