Ugly bitch, see my foot - kicking in your teeth
Demons break, homicide - catch you in your sleep
Studded gloves, smash your face - blood spurts everywhere
Giants force, pulled you down - you just got your share

Brutal Massacre
Execute them all
Deathstrike

Firestorms burn above - hail of fucking flames
Blind your eyes, scythe rotates - crashing all your names
Killing chains, rip your skin - cutting hard and deep
Maimed and slashed, glooming red - see the blood now seep

Brutal Massacre
Execute them all
Deathstrike

Grind you down, apocalypse - the riders take your life
Blackened souls, tear your flesh - slaughtered by the knife
Fallen saint, pulls you down - down into the pit
There you'll burn and you'll die - bleed you fucked up shit

Brutal Massacre
Execute them all
Deathstrike
