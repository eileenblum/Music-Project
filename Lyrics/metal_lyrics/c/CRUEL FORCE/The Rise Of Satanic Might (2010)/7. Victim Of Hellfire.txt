Satanic night, we will fight
Satan is our master, hail the goat
Burn the church, the devil's urge
We are possessed by nocturnal hell

Heavy Metal Death
Victim of Hellfire
Metal fills the air
Victim of Hellfire

Endless torment, ripping flesh
Angels dying, fear the mass
Kill the virgin, drink her blood
The gates of hell are open now

Heavy Metal Death
Victim of Hellfire
Metal fills the air
Victim of Hellfire

Heavy Metal Death
Victim of Hellfire
Metal fills the air
Victim of Hellfire

Violent rite, we kill tonight
Cease their life by the fucking knife
We shove our metal down your throat
Till you choke on the taste of fire

Heavy Metal Death
Victim of Hellfire
Metal fills the air
Victim of Hellfire
