Light the flame of Satan
Burn the son of God
Reign tonight our master

Ancient rites of evil
Praise unholy might
Fear nocturnal reaper
Crush the holy light

Blood of god in your sacristy
Wine of lies and the impurity
Drink the gore of lord Jesus Christ
And you'll see the fire in demon eyes

Satan's soldiers are gathering under the pentagram
Hellish army is marching forward for the pentagram

Lift your sword and rip the angels wings
Damned to die in flames the jewish king
Wear with pride the crown and burning rings
Hell will rise to reign in blasphemy

Satan's soldiers are gathering under the pentagram
Hellish army is marching forward for the pentagram
Satan's soldiers are gathering under the pentagram
Hellish army is marching forward for the pentagram

See your saviour dying
Bow down unto me
Hail our father Satan
In eternity

See your saviour dying
Bow down unto me
Hail our father Satan
In eternity
