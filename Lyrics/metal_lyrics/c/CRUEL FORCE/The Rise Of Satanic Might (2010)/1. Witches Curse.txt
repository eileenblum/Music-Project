Dark... Black... Sky... Blood is falling
Pile... burns... bright... Witch is burning
Curs... ing... life... All the humans
Flames... lick... high

Raped - Scorned - By priests
Slapped - Trapped - Beneath
Blood - burns - in her veins
"Curse their kind"
Wishes - death - to all
Let them feel...

...Wrathful vengeance

Death will conquer...
Witches curse strikes DOWN

Black - Mass - Ritual
Demons - Head - The Call
Revenge for her death
Take - their - breaths
Hack, maim, slash and kill
Let them feel...

...Wrathful vengeance

Death will conquer...
Witches curse strikes DOWN

Pounded - into dust
All - hope - is lost
Hellish - tyrants reign
Conquerors
All - laughter has died
Oh, they felt

...Wrathful vengeance

Death will conquer...
Witches curse strikes DOWN
