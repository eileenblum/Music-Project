Whipped and beaten
Move on you little horny bitch
Can you feel my passion?
Magic is in the air
Leather and Metal
Leather and Metal

My leather queen
Of hell delight
She is obscene all the time
Fulfill my dream
Bow down - start to suck
Leather and Metal
Leather and Metal

Then you died
Death by lust is the only way
No need to cry
The boys are coming to gain
Alright!

Leather and Metal
Leather and Metal
