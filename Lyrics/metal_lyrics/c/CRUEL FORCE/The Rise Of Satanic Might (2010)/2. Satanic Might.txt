Pentagram is held up high
Raise the swords into the sky
Fight the fight for right
Or feel the wrath of satanic might

Fill the chalice with with angels blood
Blasphemate and curse the gods
Rejoice in sin and walk at night
Or feel the wrath of satanic might

Drunk on blood - Ride the beast
Deadly plot - Evil's feast
Spells of death - Rotten soul
Spells of flesh - Lose control

Satanic might
Join the fight
Satanic might
Blaspheme the light

Deny their god and spit at Christ
Denounce their faith in the king of lies
Hail the new dawn with thousand cries
Or feel the wrath of satanic might

Drunk on blood - Ride the beast
Deadly plot - Evil's feast
Spells of death - Rotten soul
Spells of flesh - Lose control

Satanic might
Join the fight
Satanic might
Blaspheme the light
