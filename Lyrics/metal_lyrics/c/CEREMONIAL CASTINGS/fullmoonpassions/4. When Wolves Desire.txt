She a shadow brought to me,
A graveyard gift in secrecy
As she weeps, flesh embraced by teeth

Her blood-filthy breasts,
Evokes my dreams to flesh
In night's passionate flame,
I am the pleasure that brings her pain

I see her eyes glow with fear, under the night sky
I see a grin blessed with tears, embraced by lust's surprise

Angels weep for they are deceived, forever cursed immortality
Tonight we breath a desiring feast, to shed her of her curiosity
To walk forever in secrecy, flesh-driven pleasures in beastiality
And as her heart opens to me, I welcome her to the land of lycanthropy

I see her eyes glow with fear, under the night sky
I see a grin blessed with tears, embraced by lust's surprise

She walks with me...in darkness...
She took my hand...for her last caress
