Lurking the night, in the shadows to attack
&amp; when you wonder where your children went
Murder! torture! dismemberment!

He is the beast that walks the night
Feasting on children, taking pleasure in their cries
The hand of black will strike once again
Wolfen hunger that ravels in it's pain

Beast in black - your soul is damned forever

In the night you can hear the screams
A tortered child, awoke from his dreams
All is helpless before the sun
When night falls - death will come!

Beast in black - your soul is damned forever
