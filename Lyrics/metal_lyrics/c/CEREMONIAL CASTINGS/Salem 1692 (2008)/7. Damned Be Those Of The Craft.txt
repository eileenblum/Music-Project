Damned be those of the craft
Ye who wield such horrid spells
Soon to see their nights last pass
Into cauldron cold, black feathers fell

Flesh succumbs to dagger's stab
Blood boils deep with tallow first
Second comes the scales of snake
With spit and semen to complete their curse

Our souls are not for the taking...
Not in vein we shall die with pride

Our names are bound into the black unholy book
We have sold our souls... to Lucifer!

We know not of heaven except for mortal lies
We are not damned yet hunters,
Crowned under this dreadful night

Damned be those of the craft
