Fair witch of the southern path
Led the young into conjuration
Bringing forth thou of which we do not speak
Now here the devil in Salem

Unclean witch whipped be once a slave
Led the young into temptation
Condemned to chains
So halt thee silver tongue
Still now here the devil in Salem

Fear the shadows that dance before your eyes
They will set foot upon
All rooftops tonight

Fear what the night
Soon to you will bring
Listen for the tune of which
The devil's whores will sing

Hide and wilt behind
Your book of lies
There are no saints
To bring armor now

Scamper swift
Before your fear stones
There are no prayers
To bring salvation now

Fear the shadows that dance before your eyes
They will set foot
Upon all rooftops tonight

The devil is here in Salem
