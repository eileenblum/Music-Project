Return from the witches tomb
Unclean spirits of deceased
To spread revenge in deepest gloom
Salem shall never rest in peace

Hear the voice of the dead;
Long lost voice of the damned

From wood and sky they come
To haunt and awake from dream
Swollen voices to harrow by night
Swift infliction to covert thy screams

Hear the voice of the dead;
Long lost voice of the damned

And forth be set upon
Salem this curse
An evil on all
That can not be taught
Until revenge
19 witches will thirst
And upon Salem this day...
The devil still walks
