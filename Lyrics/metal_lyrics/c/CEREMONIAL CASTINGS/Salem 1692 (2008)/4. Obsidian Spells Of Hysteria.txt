I command thee spirit,
Fly out from me
Strike forth upon Salem
From this town may god flee

I have seen the night
I have seen the shadows
In the wood where they dance
With the devil
I have seen the crow
I have seen the blood
Bleeding into a book of black
I have seen the witch
I have seen her naked
Conjuring her spells in the dark of night
I have seen the moon
I have seen the sun
As they combine into one another

Fly my spirit
Cast shadow into dreams
Curse the names of the holy
Let hell ride they wings

I have seen the night
I have seen the shadows
In the wood where they dance
With the devil
I have seen the crow
I have seen the blood
Bleeding into a book of black
I have seen the witch
I have seen her naked
Conjuring her spells in the dark of night
I have seen the moon
I have seen the sun
As they combine into one another

Sickened be those of the light
Tainted excuse of human life
Set fire unto the flock this night
Blessed be horns that rise
