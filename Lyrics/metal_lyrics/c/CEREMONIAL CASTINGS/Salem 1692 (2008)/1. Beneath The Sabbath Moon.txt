...Awaken...

The swift of night
And the marvel lays out their guide
They come by shadow
And unseen before god's eyes

Sauntering through the wooded thick
In secret where they gather
Yet watching here
Is the father of another

Amidst the cauldron's wake
Dismantling of all mesh
Sworn arms reach higher skies
Without any stitch upon their flesh

The dance begins
Before the devil and the unseen priest
Blood spatters for a sacrifice
And a drink to bring them to their knees

Here and now is where they pledge
Here and now in secret
Here and now is where they pledge
An offering to accept

A heart and soul now combine
With blackness ye shall be of one
Hearing only his voice in mind
Into all a new lord has come

Script be within the blackest book
And magic reign upon this land
Rise up ye whores of Salem
As you and Lucifer walk hand in hand

Here and now is where they pledge
Here and now in secret
Here and now is where they pledge
And offering to accept

The swift of night
And the marvel lays out their guide
They come by shadow
And unseen before god's eyes

Sauntering through the wooded thick
In secret where they gather
Yet watching here
Is the father of another
