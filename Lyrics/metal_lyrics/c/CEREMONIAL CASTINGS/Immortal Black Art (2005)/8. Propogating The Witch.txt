Propogating The Witch

I Indulge The Wretched Whore
Forbidden Lust This Witchcunt Brings
Unto The Burning Of My Thrust She Cums
Spread Wide Open, Screaming To Recieve
The Marks Of Pain She Slowly Engraves
The Flesh Runs Red From The Jagged Nails
Licking The Wounds That She Creates
Taunting My Ears, She Harshly Wails

Her Teeth Clamp Down Where My Neck Begins
My State Of Mind Reminds Me Of Death
Burning With The Scent Of Intercourse Sweat
She Chills Me Down With Her Blowing Breath
Entranced By Sins That Waltz Upon Her Skin
Which Seems To Leak; Upon Me She Bleeds
Her Mouth Of Filth Ends Our Spawning Dance
Another Young Grow From My Seed
