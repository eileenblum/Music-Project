My Life, My Flesh, My Soul
My Blood From The Blade So Cold
My Heart, My Spirit, My Mind
To You I Shall Be My Sacrifice

Embrace Us With Your Darkest Arms
Take Heed? We Shall Not Scorn You
Let Us Become!

Look Deep Into The Powers You Bestow
Grant Us Of What We Are Worthy
We Bow Before You In The Darkness Far Below
We Are Your Servants!

My Life, My Flesh, My Soul
My Blood From The Blade So Cold
My Heart, My Spirit, My Mind
To You I Shall Be My Sacrifice

Walk Us Through The Obsidian Gates,
The Gates Of Immortality
Teach Us The Secrets Of The Pasts

Immortal... Black... Art
