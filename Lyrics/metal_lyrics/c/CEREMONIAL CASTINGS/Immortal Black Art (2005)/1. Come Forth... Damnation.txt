Come Forth... Damnation, The Eternal Bringer Of Grief
Bring Forth Thy Darkness After All These Centuries
A Rite, A Prophecy, A Seductive, Destructive Light
Of Flame &amp; Burden; This Is Armageddon's Night

A Melody Of Symphony Forever Bleeds
For We Are Angels Lost; To Forever Be
Forlorn Blasphemies Which Ride Upon Our Wings
Such Songs Of Damnation We Forever Sing

Come Forth... Damnation
Hail! Hail! Hail! Damnation
