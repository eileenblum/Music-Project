Summon Me Through The Fires Dance
See Me Rise &amp; Walk With Flame
For These Hands Hold The Fire Blue
See Me Burn But Without Pain

I Am Of Fire, Unleashing Burning Fury
Flames Flow Within My Blood, Behold The Might Of One

I Am Of Flame, Sinner Of Ancient Times
The Bringer Of The End, Behold The Might Of One

I Am Reborn Unto The Mortal Lands
Blood-Boiling Veins &amp; Fire Breathing Flesh
Disciple Of The Coming Apocalypse
Carrying Left Hand Trinity's Carress
... I Am Reborn...

I Am Encrypted With Poisonous Fires
I Am Baptized In The Deepest Of Flame
I Am Alive Inside A World Of Burning
I Am Reborn Through The Bestial Flame

I Am Fire, I Am The Flame
I Am Desire &amp; I Am The Chains
I Am Pleasure Inside The Pain
I Am Fire!
