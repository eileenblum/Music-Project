"In Nomine Patri, In Nomine Redemptor, In Nomine Satani
Ego Renuo Thee, Ridimio Ego Revera
In Nomine Rex Regis, Ego Apello Bellum
In Nomine Patri, Ave Exordium, Ave Mortis"

I Am The Devil &amp; The Devil Is Me
For The Only Devil In Existence Is Man
We Are What We Are If We Are Free
Otherwise Slaves To The Holy Hand
I Am The Savior &amp; The Savior Is Me
If You Believe There Is A Savior At All
I'll Sell My Soul Because Nothing Is Free
To See The Celebration Of Salvation's Fall

I Am The Prophet &amp; The Prophet Is Me
Listen To The Words That I Speak
Our Lives Consist Only Of Hypocrisy
Because The Minds Of Mass Are So Narrow &amp; Weak
I Am The Father &amp; The Father Is Me
Inside Us Lies The Choices That We Make
Close Your Eyes, Only The Blind Can See
The True Filth Spawned By Our Race
