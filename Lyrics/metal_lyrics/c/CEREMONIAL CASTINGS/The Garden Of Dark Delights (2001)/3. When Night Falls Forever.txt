When Night Falls Forever Inside My Heart
I Will Live No Longer, Until The Night Has Come

This Night Has Come Fore Me
Forgotten Legacy

The Light No Longer Shines
No Burden To My Eyes

My Soul Wil Become Aflame
A VictemTo Desire's Game
&amp; When You Open Your Eyes
You Will Witness The Light's Demise
Come Now, Take My Hand In Vein
Without Light There Is No Shame
These Skies Will Take Their Flight
Embraced By Mother Night
