Within The Kingdoms Of Dark Obscurity

This Night Has Called For Me
The Moon Is Mine
Nocturnal Fascinations
A Blackened Vine

My Soul Forever At Ease
Welcoming Nightfall
To Lay Forever In Dusk
I Can Hear The Call

Let The Dark Come To Me
As This Light Decays
Through My Immortal Dreams
Dusk Calls My Name
Let The Dark Come To Me
As This Light Decays
Through My Immortal Dreams
Dusk Calls My Name
