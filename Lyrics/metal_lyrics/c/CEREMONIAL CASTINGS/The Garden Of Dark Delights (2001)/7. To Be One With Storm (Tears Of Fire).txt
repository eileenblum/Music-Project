All Is Calm Before The Storm
Nigh Has Fallen &amp; I am Born
This Night Brings Blood Written In The Sky
The Storm Is Thy Redemption of Faith
Now &amp; Again I will Fall From Grace
&amp; The Sky Rains Tears Of Fire

Darkness Coming, Children Running
I am Falling, Take Away My Soul

Angels Are Falling From The Sky
Blood Covers Ground Where They Lie
This Night Brings Repent Written In The Sky
The Storm Is Thy Redemption Of Faith
Now &amp; Again I Will Fall From Grace
&amp; The Sky Rains Tears Of Fire

Darkness Coming, Children Running
I Am Falling. To Be One With Storm
