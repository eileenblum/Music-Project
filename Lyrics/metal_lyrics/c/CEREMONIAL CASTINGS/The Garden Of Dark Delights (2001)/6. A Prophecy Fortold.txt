This The Last Dawn
The Epitaph Of The Sun
Shining Now Is The Moon
To Grace My Solitude

A Prophecy Fortold... Dusk Forever More
A Prophecy Fortold... The Shades Of Night Fall

The Night Has Summoned Me
The Dawn Brought To It's Knees
The Light Forever Damned
Night Caressed In Silence

Visions Of Enslavement &amp; Damnation
We Slaughter The Light Child,
A Prophecy Fortold

This Eternal Glory Of The Nightfall
Thy Screams Are Summoned,
A Prophecy Fortold
