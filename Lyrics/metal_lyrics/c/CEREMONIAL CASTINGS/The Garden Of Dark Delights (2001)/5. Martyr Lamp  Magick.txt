Her World Is Soaked In Visions,
Visions Of The Past Burning
Upon The Stake Which Suites Her End
Like A Long Life Virgin Yearning
Dressed Deep Inside Black Sorcery
She Has Since Projected Her Sins
With Black Magick's Beauty
Set Deep Within Her Skin

She Watches The World
Through Darkest Crystal
That Guides Her Eyes By Night
Nocturnaly Dressed At The Hour Of Sunset
Awaiting Dusk, To Take Her Flight

She Will Come To You In Darkest Gloom
&amp; Enter Your Mind In Spell
A Forbidden Fantasy Along With Death
Her Body She Does Sell...
