The First Fall Will Bless The Snake
Awaiting A Life Of Pain
So Frail It Sits Upon The Leaves
Awaiting Winter's Beginning

Another Rose Another Kiss
Touching Toungues With A Serpent
Night Falls Quick Upon The Day
Scales Of Green Turn To Grey

Life Is Damned In The Dark Of Night
A Body So Cold Holds The Burning Eyes
Embracing A Serpent's Kiss

Witches Burn Upon The Stake
Under Devil's Night &amp; The World Of Cain
This Pain I Did Not Wish

A Serpent's Kiss
