By the words of the Mad Arab Alhazred
From the nameless city &amp; keeper of the keys
Behold my findings from behind 9 doors
Rushing devils now invoke my dreams
Dark univers I hear ye yawning
Black as the Witches' Cauldrons are
Old Minds more intelligent than Miskatonics
Here I seek you and dare to travel far

Gathered now the black brotherhood be
Under stars aligned in Trapezohedron form
Bas-relief readings from the idol stone
conducting rituals; Cthulhu be reborn!
Before hell-wind &amp; titan-blue
Aeon-shadowed Walpurgisnacht
Rise from Yith-infested Seas
Psychic-tentacle mind rot

Cthulhu, Azathoth
Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath
Father Dragon, Dagon
Mother Hydra, Yog-Sothoth

Borne on the wings of night
Are those out beyond space
From dim eras &amp; dark stars
Entering here through the spirit gate
Black-winged ones travel through sky
Cephalopods of cryptic lore
Stretching beyond Arkham minds
Cthonian prophecy shadows forth

Electricity from below
smoke-wreathed world of dream
Violet lamp-starred twilight
Nothing here is what it seems
I see the tower in the dark
A shadow that is out of time
Lightning strike from cloudless skies
In their name dark star Yuggoth shine
