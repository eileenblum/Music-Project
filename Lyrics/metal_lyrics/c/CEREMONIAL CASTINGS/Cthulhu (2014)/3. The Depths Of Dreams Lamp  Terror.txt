The horrors I've seen
within my sleep &amp; dreams
awakens my mind
to the absolute strangest things
From deep inside
it's astronomical mind,
starring from below
watching with gazing eyes

Reverse anthropod abortion,
convulsive subconscious contortions
A new unrestricted reality
trapped in prismatic distortion
Dark universe coursing through my veins, 
black planets begin to roll without aim
Beyond the realms of my mind, 
lays a city I cannot yet name

Unknown superior; he who will drown the sun
Laying below a chasm of stone,
shielding him since the sun was young
Blasphemies from elder stars
which dream beneath the sea
The old ones were, the old ones now
&amp; again the old ones be
