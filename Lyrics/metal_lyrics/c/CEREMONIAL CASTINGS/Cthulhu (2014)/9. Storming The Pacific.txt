Formless presence smoke rising 
Black Aether erasing our horizon
Seven seas freshly flood
Seven continents concealed in blood

Ceaselessly Crawling Chaos,
Planetary-wreckage holocaust-seance
Ithaqua flares riding winds
Abysmal stares burst unhinged

"Praise him;
he with tentacles like serpents,
Praise with the black goat of the woods 
with a thousand young,
Praise the blind demon
who dwells within the pit of chaos,
Praise the destroying eye,
the cold flame &amp; the burning ones"

IA!
IA!
IA!
IA CTHULHU!
