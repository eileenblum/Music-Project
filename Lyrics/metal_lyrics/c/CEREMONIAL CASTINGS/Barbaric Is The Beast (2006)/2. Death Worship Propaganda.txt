I See Not Why We Follow Lies And Try With Great Persistence
When The Fruits Of Life Will Be Denied At The End Of Our Existence

(Ave Mortis, Ave Timor Mortis)
Depart, Surrender: No Lord Shall Save Thee
Resign, Bow Out: No Lord Shall Save Thee
Vacate, Withdraw: No Lord Shall Save Thee
Decease, Desist: No Lord Shall Save Thee

I See Not Why We Cradle Life And Long To Be Complete
When All Is Temporarily Satisfied And Again The Strong Become The Weak

We All Succumb To The Bearer Of The Black
Our Toll Is The Giving Of Our Lives
No One Shall Escape Realization;
Eradication, Extermination, Obliteration
