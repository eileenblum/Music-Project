The Dawn Rises Forever No More
Darkness Eternal, Darkness Adore
The Gates Are Opened Damnation Has Come
Blood Flows Like Wine, Dusk Is Dawn

The Coming Of Dawn We Fear

The Light Is Gone, The Sun Has Set
Dusk Has Come, Misery Prevails
Everlasting Lakes Of Angel's Blood
A Nocturnal Treat A Nocturnal Drug

I Can Take You Through The Endless Skies
I Could Be Your Love, You Would Never Die
I Could Be Your Heart, You Would Be Adored
Because The Dawn Rises No More

I Could Be Your Heart, I Could Be Your Soul
Without This Dawn
I Could Take Your Heart, I Could Take Your Soul
Without The Dawn
Take Away This Dawn
I Will Be Your Heart, I Will Be Your Soul
I Will Be Your Dawn
