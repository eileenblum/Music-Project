She... The Serpentine, Of My Dreams
She Is Sin...
A Slithering Witch, A Serpent Queen
Her Venom Is Seduction

Before Her I Bow, Submitted To Charm
Accepting A Kiss, From Her Poisoned Toungue
Let Us Walk Together, In Your Valley Forever
Entwined As One!

In The Valley Of Snakes - She Is Lord

So Let The Children Come To Me
To Feed Upon The Veins Of Blasphemy
In Her World Of God-like Eyes
She Becomes My Bride Entwined

Now Let The Poison Enter My Veins
&amp; Leave My Lips Blood-staind
Surrender Your Body To Me
Let Me Join In This Flesh Feast

Praise Be The Blood Of The Serpent!

So Let The Children Come To Me
To Feed Upon The Veins Of Blasphemy
In Her World Of God-like Eyes
She Becomes My Bride Entwined

In The Valley Of Snakes - She Is Lord
