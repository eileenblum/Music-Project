Erase The Mind Of Time &amp; Being
For Existence Disintegration

Erase The Soul, Cleanse The Mind
Hope: Abandoned
Self: Abandoned

The World Marches For A New Beginning
The World Marches For The End
The World Marches For Extermination
Our World Dies Again

Looking In The Face Of Death, Take The Hand That Steals The Flesh
Acknowledge The World's Cries
Look Back Once Again To See What All Must End
Celebrate World Demise

Our World Dies Again
