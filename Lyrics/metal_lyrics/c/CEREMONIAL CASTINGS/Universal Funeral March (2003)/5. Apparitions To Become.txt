Live To Die &amp; Die To Live
Life Starts After Death
We Are But Nothing To A World Of Change
Riddance To Sanity

A Distant Voice In The Air
Listen To What We Become
Reality Of A Mortal's Curse
Puragtory: Thy Kingdom Come

Apparitions To Become

Destiny Lies Within The Air
A World Hidden Beyond Our Care
Salvation Lies Before Our Eyes
Which Rids Death Of It's Dispair
