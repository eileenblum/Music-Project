He Is The Beast In Black
Lurking The Night, In The Shadows To Attack
&amp; When You Wonder Where Your Children Went
Murder! Torture! Dismemberment!

He Is The Beast That Walks The Night
Feasting On Children, Taking Pleasure In Their Cries
The Hand Of Black Will Strike Once Again
Wolfen Hunger That Ravels In It's Pain

Beast In Black - Your Soul Is Damned Forever
