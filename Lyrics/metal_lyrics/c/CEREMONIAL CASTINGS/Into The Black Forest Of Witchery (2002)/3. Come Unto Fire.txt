I Am The Flame Of Lord Corruption
Desire Burns Within The Flesh
Place Your Body Amoungst The Candle
Upon Inferno's Carress

Burn For Me Eternaly
I Am Hellfire Behind Your Eyes
Wear The Mask With Painful Tasks
I Am Brimstone Between Your Thighs

Sip The Oceans Of Your Darkest Desire
Come Onto Me, Come Unto Fire
Reach For Me In This Forbidden Empire
Come Onto Flame, Come Unto Fire

Come To Me Let The Pain Navigate You
Come Undone Upon This Heat
Thy Wretched Lord Engulfed In The Masses
I Am He Who Thou Doth Seek

Sip The Oceans Of Your Darkest Desire
Come Onto Me, Come Unto Fire
Reach For Me In This Forbidden Empire
Come Onto Flame, Come Unto Fire
