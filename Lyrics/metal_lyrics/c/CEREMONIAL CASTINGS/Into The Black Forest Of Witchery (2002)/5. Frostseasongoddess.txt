The Dark Enchants Me
The Forest I Forsee
My Homecoming Ground
Where I Hide From Thee
The Trees Are Covered
In A Lightly Grazed Frost
&amp; In My Sleep
Silence Is Forever Lost

The Trees: My God Under Twilight
The Frost: A Goddess Of The Freezing Night
The Snow: Decieves The Warmth Of All Life
The Night: Feeds Me With Endless Time

Adoring Silence...
I Am Welcomed To This Land
Shiva: My Lust &amp; Flame
Forever Take My Hand
&amp; In This Night
We Are Calm Before The Storm
&amp; Through Her Coldest Touch
I Am Reborn!

The Trees: My God Under Twilight
The Frost: A Goddess Of The Freezing Night
The Snow: Decieves The Warmth Of All Life
The Night: Feeds Me With Endless Time

I Bow Before This Moon Tonight
&amp; Pray To Shiva; The Goddess Of Ice
This Land Is Frozen In A Realm Of Frost
My Heart In Her; I am Forever Lost

Teach Me The Ways Of The Wicked Tonight
Let My Heart Be Pure With Ice
I Want To Walk Forever In This Land
Let Our Blood Run Cold - Hand In Hand
