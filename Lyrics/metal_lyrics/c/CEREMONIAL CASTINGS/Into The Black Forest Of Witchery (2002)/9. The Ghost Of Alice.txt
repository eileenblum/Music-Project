Come Alice The Night Awaits!

My Sweet Alice, The Age Of Seven
Taken From Her Life, Now Would Be Eleven
Upon Her Stone She Waits For Me
To Be Her Eyes, To Do Her Deeds

Tonight I Kill For Alice
The Path Of Death I Pave
Tonight I Kill For Alice
So She May Bring Flowers Upon Their Graves

The Prayers Of Alice Are Answered Once Again
Another Victem For The Grave To Be-friend
&amp; In Her Silence Comes The Essence Of A Grin
My Dear Sweet Alice How We Laugh In The Face Of Sin!

Tonight I Kill For Alice
The Path Of Death I Pave
Tonight I Kill For Alice
So She May Bring Flowers Upon Their Graves
