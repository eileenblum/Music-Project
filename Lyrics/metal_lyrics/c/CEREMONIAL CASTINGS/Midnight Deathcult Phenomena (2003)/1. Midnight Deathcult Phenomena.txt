"Arise My Faithful, Let Us Walk The Path Of Blood
No Longer Shall We Be Mortal In Life
But Immortal Through Death
We Are The Makers Of Our Own
And The Destroyers Of All...
May We Openly Greet The Other Side"

Arise &amp; Die, One By One Embrace The Fire
Tonight Let Life... Shun You Away
We Are Free; The Sacred Birth To A New Beginning
Our Flesh And Death, Greet Upon This Day

And We Shall Bow To No One
Midnight... Deathcult Phenomena
And We Shall Rise For Nothing
Midnight... Deathcult Phenomena

The Thrill To Kill, Take My Hand Let Me Guide
You To The Flame
Our Fires Burn Higher... Enter The Only Way
Arise &amp; Die, One By One Embrace The Fire
Tonight Let Life Shun You Away
Enter The Fire! Burn!

Midnight Phenomena! Deathcult Supremacy!

As I Become Fire, As I Become Moonlight
As I Become Fire, I Become Midnight
