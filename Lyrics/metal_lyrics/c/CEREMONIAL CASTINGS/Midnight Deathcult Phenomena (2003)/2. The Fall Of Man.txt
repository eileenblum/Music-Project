On Our Darkest Hour, We Shall Fall
... From Greed
As Our Time Fades, We Will Disperse
... From Selfishness

On The Night Of The Darkest Of Eves
When Man Forever Falls
The Human Race Will Escape
From The World We Call Our Own
And Through Our Greed;
Our Own Decieved
The Pain Of All Shall End
Life To Halt, For Our Own Faults
Into Our Curse We Decend

Upon Temptation Of The Worlds Termination
The Domination Of All Revelations
The Levitation Of One's Desolation
Will Lead The Nation... Into Devastation
