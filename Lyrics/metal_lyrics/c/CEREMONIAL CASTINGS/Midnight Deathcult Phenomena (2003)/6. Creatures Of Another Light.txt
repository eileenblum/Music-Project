What Awakens On This Night?
In These Trees; What Lurks To My Surprise?

Of Moon And Shadow's Light
Disovers Flesh To Their Delight

I Can See The Light
Of Their Eyes...
I Can See The Light
Watching In The Night

... When Darkness Falls...
The Unchained Beasts: For Flesh Will Crawl
... When Darkness Falls...
Listen Deep For The Creatures Call
