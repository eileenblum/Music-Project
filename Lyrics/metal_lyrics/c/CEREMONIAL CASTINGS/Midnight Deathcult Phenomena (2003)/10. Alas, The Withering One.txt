All Take Faith In The Being Of Love
Yet Deny The Truth In The Devil Above

Play The Game Of Seductive Arts
Then Speak As If Thou Broken Hearted

Alas, The Withering One

She Seeks Divinity And No One Follows
She Proceeds In Misery And Her Heart Is Hollow
She Wants Supremacy But Her Mind Can't Follow
She Proceeds In Misery And In Death She Swallows

Alas, The Withering One
