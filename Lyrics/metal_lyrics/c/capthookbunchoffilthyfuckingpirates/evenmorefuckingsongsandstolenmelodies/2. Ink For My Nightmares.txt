Welcome to my world of nightmares
It's made of shattered dreams and plastic humanoids
Fate fades away hope is hiding when it is most needed

Come closer my child all has been forgiven
Embrace your destiny here with me forever
Be the ink for my nightmares and I'll be your sadistic saviour
Fill me with sorrow erase all that has been you
My blood looks so good on you eat my heart it yours anyway
Forgiveness turns to hatred love died when you closed your eyes
