Your words of wisdom, brainwashed opinions
This is what you are, human point two
Can you see them twisting, twisting our world?
Can you see them twisting, twisting our minds?

Save your words save your promises
Save your breath false prophets
Run and hide in disguise the day will come when you rot in the sun
