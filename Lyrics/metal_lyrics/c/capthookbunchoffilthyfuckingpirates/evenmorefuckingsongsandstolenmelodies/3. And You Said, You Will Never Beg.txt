Hit him again, he still didn't hear you
Shit for a brain, or is he insane
Have you forgotten, don't try to bargain
Remember you said, you will never beg

Everyone pays no one knows the price close your eyes roll of the dice
Luck runs out shut your mouth end of the line your life is mine
I will whisper in your ear, I have come for you
I will whisper in your ear, it's over, it's over now
