Summer fades.
Winter's cold hands embrace me.
When will this world need me? I've forgotten everything, everything, that's important to me.
Right now I'm just holding pictures.
Painting a memory of a love I used to believe, used to believe.
Sitting watching it all pass in silence; this can't be what I need.
This is a winter I'll never last.
This is isolation I can't stand.
Beyond my thoughts there is a hope that lies within, a hope that lies within.
Enthroned in isolation.
