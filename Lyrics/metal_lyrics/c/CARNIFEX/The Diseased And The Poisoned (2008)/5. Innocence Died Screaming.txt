This is a curse, a plague upon ourselves.
Embracing only ruin.
Forgetting everything else.
What a tortuous inversion of life.
So empty and torn at the seams.
Pulling back the curtain of night, downing in fear and grief, downing in fear and grief.
The broken crown of an angel, her innocence dies screaming.
A beauty so rare and hollow, her eyes now pools of ebony.
The broken crown of an angel, her innocence dies screaming.
