In complete darkness and total fright, feeling cold hands scratch at me.
Deaths romance wonders like lost love upon this blackened dreamscape.
Clinging to past memories like the fading thoughts of a dream, there but just for a moment.
A glimpse then gone into dark eternity, entwined with the night beneath a crimson sky.
To my dead and dark dreams: A toast for thee.
Push past these castle gates.
My darling, death here awaits.
To my dead and dark dreams: A toast for thee.
