Hours before the dawn when cold winds offered comfort, a darkness hangs in the air a seething for the night.
The screams of fallen angels.
I've learned to love it here.
This is where the dark and hate await.
My name written among the grim shadows.
A poisoned heart now in attack.
Tear past the flesh of life.
A life buried in black.
This castle courtyard, a theater for misery.
A thrown to unseat the living.
The lust of death burns in me.
Welcome the night.
Arise, the dead are upon us.
And with them, my name written among grim shadows.
Welcome the night.
