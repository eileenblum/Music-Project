Breathe out this failure pain.
Breathe in the sorrow of past regret.
Unbearable, this is all I know.
Breathing never hurt so bad.
Tonight, I gave you everything I had, everything that I had to you.
I gave everything to you.
Now you see why there's hatred in me.
Now you see why there's death in these eyes.
This was made to be broken.
Just one more, just one more endless night built on sin, built on lies.
This is what sickness feeds on.
Just one more endless night.
