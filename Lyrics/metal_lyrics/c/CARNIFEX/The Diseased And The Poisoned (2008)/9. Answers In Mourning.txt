I can't see it but I feel it everyday.
I'm watching the fain fall through this broken glass and I'm washing the blood from my hands, washing the blood from my hands.
I shouldn't even try, she's right.
This time it's gonna take everything that I have, everything that I have.
These are letters I'll never send, words that will go unsaid.
I want you dead.
And bury you in the darkest part of my heart.
Your arms were my open grave begging me back.
Like a walk through a dead winter park, it was over before the start.
These are letters that I'll never send.
I want you dead.
