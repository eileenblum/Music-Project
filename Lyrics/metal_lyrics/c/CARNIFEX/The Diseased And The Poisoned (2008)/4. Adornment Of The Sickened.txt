The precious passing of a beautiful face.
An inhuman perversion from on mistake.
Degeneration.
Complete removal of the heart.
Adornment of the sickened.
This is the crowning of the undead.
Now I watched in embittered sorrow.
And dream of her in death, dream of her in death.
On my own back, turned from the light.
