This is hate and all the passion that goes with it.
This is love and all the sickness that I feel because of you, because of you.
I crowned you during death; adornment of my dying bride.
In coalesce with filth and faith, your salvation deaths embrace.
Black like deicide.
Cracked mirrors look back and laugh.
Thoughts crush my mind.
Secrets of my heart pour black like deicide.
One of these nights I promise, I'll watch you die.
When the tables were turned, I'll watch you die.
Lifeless and empty, your absence is killing me.
Let the past die.
You were always dead in my eyes.
Because of you, this is hate, this is hate.
Because of you, this is hate.
