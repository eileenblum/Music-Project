The dead have risen and they're here for your
A grave of angels with rotten souls
So sick they'll only ever love you [2x]

I'd always dreamed I'd die out at sea
Out there I'll drown alone, right where you left me

Everything I do is to forget you
This is a new kind of low
Nights I can barely get through

I'm too far gone to ever come back
Forget my faults and broken wings
These are words I thought I never to say
And the ghosts that I know
If we ever meet again
I'll have nothing left to say

Every thought from my mind is filth
I'm counting the days till you hang yourself
Every word from my mouth is hate
I'm praying this is the last fucking breath you take

The dead have risen and they're here for you
A grave of angels with rotten souls
So sick they'll only ever love you

Now you'll see that nothing lasts forever
End this with my own hands
And burn in hell together

End this with my own hands
And burn in hell together

Everything I do is to forget you
This is a new kind of low
Nights I can barely get through

I'm too far gone to ever come back
Forget my faults and broken wings
These are words I thought I never to say
And the ghosts that I know
If we ever meet again
I'll have nothing left to say

Every thought from my mind is filth
I'm counting the days till you hang yourself
Every word from my mouth is hate
I'm praying this is the last fucking breath you take

Every thought from my mind is filth
Every word from my mouth is hate

The day after never is the day I forgive you
The day you remember is the day I say fuck you [2x]

The day you remember is the day I say
The day you remember is the day I say fuck you
