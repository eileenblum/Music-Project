Salvation is dead. 

This is what I see when I close my eyes. 
This is what the end of the world feels like. 
Slow motion murder killing everything inside. 
This is what the end of the world feels like. 
Am I the only one who wants to die young?
In my next life I'll be everything I never was. 
I'll take pictures so you'll see me dying. 
And say these are just words, you know I'm lying. 
Maybe I'm sick or maybe I'm sad. 
I promised not to do it, but the razor's in my hand. 

Depression without control. 
Pain, I can't feel it anymore. 
If these words can't be read, know that this is the end. 

This is the end. 

This is death by a thousand cuts. 
This isn't love, this is getting fucked. 

Depression without control. 
Pain, I can't feel it anymore.

One last thought before my heart stops beating. 
This is when you pray, but your god's not listening.
One last thought then I stop breathing.
Salvation is dead, I wrote my own fucking ending. 

Salvation is dead. 

Dead are the days when I dreamed of Hope. 
Waiting by your grave, all I loved, I loved alone. 

One last thought before my heart stops beating. 
This is when you pray, but your god's not listening.
One last thought then I stop breathing.
Salvation is dead, I wrote my own fucking ending.

Dead are the days when I dreamed of Hope. 
Waiting by your grave, all I loved, I loved alone.
