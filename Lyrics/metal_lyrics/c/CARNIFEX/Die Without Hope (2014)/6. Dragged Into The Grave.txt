These are your inner demons

This is death's cold embrace
This is everyone you've ever loved
Spitting in your fucking face

It's time to reap what you have sown
Your lies
Your lies are all that I've ever known
This is everything that should never be read
Written alone in the arms of the dead

This is a world where I am loved only by death
Dragged into the grave
An ocean of my own regret

There is no peace
Only this grave
Rotting wounds
Burn my fucking remains

This is regret for every mistake you've ever made
This is every lie you've ever told
Putting you in an early grave

This is death's cold embrace
This is everyone you've ever loved
Spitting in your fucking face

I don't give a fuck if you live or die
One thousand needles buried in your eyes
I wish I had the strength to slit my own throat
Remember when I said I want to watch myself choke

This is a nightmare that I've embraced
Because I like the way blood tastes

It's time to reap what you have sown
Your lies
Your lies are all that I've ever known
This is everything that should never be read
Written alone in the arms of the dead

This is a world where I am loved only by death
Dragged into the grave
An ocean of my own regret

[2x]
One thousand voices screaming
If hell exists this is it

This is it
