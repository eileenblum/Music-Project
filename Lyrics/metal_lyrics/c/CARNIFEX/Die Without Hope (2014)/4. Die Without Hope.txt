I have never felt so fucking numb. 
In front of the mirror with a loaded gun. 
Every word you read is stained in blood. 
This gets sick cause I'm mind-fucked. 

I've died and my body turned to rust. 
An empty carcass left to rot back to dust. 
Like a casket in a shallow grave
Out of sight, but I promise it will never go away. 

These words may sound all the same. 
I have bled to death on every page. 
Watch as my heart turns to stone. 
Watch me die without hope. 

I don't want to break your heart with mine. 
Everything I know about life is a lie. 
This is what I feared the most. 
Wanting love but chasing ghosts. 

And it won't matter when I forget your name. 
You know exactly what I am, and you know I love the pain. 
Remember my words but forget my face. 
Every fucking scar screams your name. 

Remember my words but forget my face. 
Every fucking scar screams your name. 
[2x]

And it won't matter when I forget your name. 
You know exactly what I am, and you know I love the pain. 
Remember my words but forget my face. 
Every fucking scar screams your name. 

I have never felt so fucking numb. 
In front of the mirror with a loaded gun. 
Every word you read is stained in blood. 
This gets sick cause I'm mind-fucked

These words may sound all the same, 
I have bled to death on every page. 
Watch as my heart turns to stone. 
Watch me die without Hope. 

Watch as my heart turns to stone. 
Watch me die without Hope. 

And it won't matter when I forget your name. 
You know exactly what I am, and you know I love the pain. 
Remember my words but forget my face. 
Every fucking scar screams your name.
