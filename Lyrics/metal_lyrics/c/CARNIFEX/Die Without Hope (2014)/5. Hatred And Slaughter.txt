This is my reality, so fuck what you've heard. 
This blood is on your hands, now choke on your fucking words.  

Live through my losses. 
Bury your sins and carry your crosses. 
Everything you read is written with a poison pen. 
Every thought in my head is me dreaming of the end. 

This is my reality so fuck what you've heard. 
This blood is on your hands, now choke on your fucking words. 

It's as if death rained from the sky. 
Too many suicidal nights. 
Too many fucking lies. 
And I'll slip away and I'll never say goodbye. 
The night that love died. 
The night that life left my eyes. 

My thoughts are only hatred and slaughter. 
I'm mind-fucked, and it's only getting darker. 
I will crush you with my words. 
I'll make you feel the depth of this hurt. 

All those things I've longed to undo.
Why can't I find one second of peace?
Close my eyes and die in my sleep. 
And I'll count to ten before you turn your back on me again. 
I'll close my eyes and we'll both pretend. 
I'll step off this ledge and let you bury what's left of me. 
Let me count to ten before I leave this world a memory. 

This is my reality, so fuck what you've heard.  
This blood is on your hands, now choke on your fucking words. 
Now choke on your fucking words. 

It's as if death rained from the sky. 
Too many suicidal nights. 
Too many fucking lies. 
And I'll slip away and I'll never say goodbye. 
The night that love died. 
The night that life left my eyes. 

And I'll slip away and I'll never say goodbye. 
The night that love died. 
The night life left my eyes.

My thoughts are only hatred and slaughter. 
I'm mind fucked, and it's only getting darker.
