My grave has never looked as sweet as tonight,
Blood, death, depression
This is goodbye.

No one needs to know,
Iâm letting this world go
It hurts to think what could be,
No one needs to know but me

Truth be told, Iâm better off letting go
The world is a gun that is held to my head
Every dream I have, I wake up dead

We all have dark days, for me the darkness stays
I have one wish, let me forget the hell Iâm in. [2x]

I am alive in my grave [2x]
A lost soul, no god can save

We all have dark days, for me the darkness stays
I have one wish, let me forget the hell Iâm in. [2x]
Truth be told, Iâm better off letting go
