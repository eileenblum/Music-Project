I wander between worlds
And the dead speak to me
I don't know myself anymore
I don't know who to believe
They're with me now singing me to sleep
These are my last words, then I can dream

These voices are the silent killers
Is death all that's left for me
These thoughts have become cages
And my demons got the best of me

Is this too dark for you yet
Knowing I've pictured the way
I'll take my last breath

In my heart there are places no one has seen
Down there it's only darkness
And if you saw it, you'd swear it wasn't me

These are my last words
Death is singing me to sleep [2x]

These voices are the silent killers
Is death all that's left for me
These thoughts have become cages
And my demons got the best of me

I wander between worlds
And the dead speak to me
I don't know myself anymore
I don't know who to believe
They're with me now singing me to sleep
These are my last words, then I can dream

Is this too dark for you yet
Knowing I've pictured the way
I'll take my last breath

In my heart there are places no one has seen
Down there it's only darkness
And if you saw it, you'd swear it wasn't me

These are my last words
Death is singing me to sleep
