This is a hell that I've embraced
I don't mourn for the dead
I envy their fate

You die, you turn to dust
The light grows dark
No spark from your heart
This is the end
I can count on my hands
The dream you've killed

I will crush you with words
I'll make you feel the depth of my hurt
Trapped alone in the past (left to die)
In peace at last

Look me in the face
Lies with every breath you take
Look me in the eyes
This is me screaming goodbye

If you're hearing these words and I am no longer here
Just know that death was never one of my fears
If these are my last words and they're bringing you to tears
My destination is unknown
Anywhere is better than here

I am too much hate for one heart (destroyer of worlds)
I sold my soul and died in the dark (condemned to decay)
I am too much hate for one heart
Condemned to decay
