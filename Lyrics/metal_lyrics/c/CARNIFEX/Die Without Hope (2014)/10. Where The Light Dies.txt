All you are to me is a faded memory
Trust me when I say
Iâm alone in these dreams

Keep your eyes on my hands
And watch in the mirror
And barely understand

I donât want to know when you let your innocence go
When those nightmares took hold
I donât want to know when you let your innocence go
Choke the life from me until my body goes cold

I used to write down every lie you spoke to me
Now I know that pained my memory [2x]

Find me lying on the floor
With no life left in my eyes

Find me dreaming of the end
With no one by my side

Find me screaming goodbye (goodbye)
Find me where the light dies

There is no air to breathe
Only blood in my lungs
This time we all die alone

Say your prayers and say goodnight
One last breath before we all die

See the world through my eyes
Everything you love fucking dies

[guitar solo]

Itâs raining acid, Iâm waiting to die
Youâre just a memory buried alive

Put the gun to my head
I wonât feel the pain, Iâm already dead

All you are to me is a faded memory
Trust me when I say
Iâm alone in these dreams

Keep your eyes on my hands
And watch in the mirror
And barely understand

Find me lying on the floor
With no life left in my eyes

Find me dreaming of the end
With no one by my side

Find me screaming goodbye (goodbye)
Find me where the light dies

Dies!

See the world through my eyes
Everything you love fucking dies
See the world through my eyes
True love is a fucking lie
