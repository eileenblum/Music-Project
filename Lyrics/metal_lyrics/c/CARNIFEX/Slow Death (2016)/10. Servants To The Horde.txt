Rise up from the grave of this empty earth 
Usurpers to the throne of despair 
There is no life for us here

Find truth in death
Absolute silence
Absence of eternal rest
Find truth in death
Absolute despair 
There is no life here 

Rise up from the grave of this empty earth 
Usurpers to the throne of despair 
There is no life for us here

Servants to the horde
Dead children from a dead fucking world
Servants to the horde
Lost souls, we are hell born

We are hell born
Dead children from a dead fucking world
We are hell born

Drift into the black sky 
The comfort of eternal night
I feel your dead hand in mine

Love songs or last rites
A voice in the void
We are not meant for the light

Rise up from the grave of this empty earth 
Usurpers to the throne of despair 
There is no life for us here

Servants to the horde
Dead children from a dead fucking world
Servants to the horde
Lost souls, we are hell born

We are hell born

Hell born

Dead children from a dead fucking world
We are hell born
