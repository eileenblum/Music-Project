Out of hell but they'll always drag me back
Close my eyes, I don't want to take a breath
We are the dead generation
This hypocrisy
Death's words inside of me
Screams of agony
Witness the pain of true suffering

My heart bleeds emotional genocide
My inner demons scream
End it with suicide
Hold me down
With hands around my neck
It's hard to breath at first
Buy now I'm used to it

Lifeless eyes
Watching my world turn to lies
Lifeless eyes
A place for me for me to die
Walk off the edge of the earth
Slow death without a single sound
Ashes in the wind
I hope my body's never found

Never fucking found

Songs for the hopeless
We are death's forgotten children
I wish I never had to write these words

Depression kills us slow
But it's not our time to go
I know you want to die but just hang on

Bury me alive
This is our sickness inside
Walk off the edge of the earth
Slow death without a single sound
Ashes in the wind
I hope my body's never found

Never fucking found

Lifeless eyes
Watching my world turn to lies
Lifeless eyes
A place for me to die

Lifeless eyes
