Countess of the crescent moon
Heartstrings undone in deaths interlude
Grasping so tight to life's fading light
Undone in the arms of sadistic delight

A planet without a sun
A world without light
Breath in the ashes of a world once past
Lost to the stars and the gathering dust

Torn from the heavens
To death she ascended 
We are the souls of the unforgiven
War of attrition
Unearthly possession
Love is the song of a dead religion

Death makes angels of us all
Less breathing, more letting go
I'll leave you where I met you
Death's cold kiss but I can't forgive you

Dusk turns to dawn
The next time you see me
I'll be dead and gone

Bleed me dry
I'll meet you on the other side
Tell me it's alright
Close my eyes for the last time

Bleed me dry

Fuck all the rest
Kiss me to death
Breath my last breath
Nightmare possessed

Kiss me to death
Fuck all the rest

Death makes angels of us all
Less breathing, more letting go
I'll leave you where I met you
Close my eyes but I can't forget you

Dusk turns to dawn
The next time you see me
I'll be dead and gone
