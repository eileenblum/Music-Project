Sever the nerve
Visions of hell become my only words

We're all in the same grave
Rotting until that dark fateful day
The world of the living so far away
Words of those who can't be saved

A corpse left to bleed
Lost in this void
Don't end up like me
Erased from the earth
And dead in a dream
Forever left in this purgatory 

Pray to the god of death
Necro toxic
Eternal unrest
Lie in your grave like the rest
Hold my breath
Suffocate to death

Embrace your inner demons
Close your eyes and you'll see them

Lost in a world
With the living and the dead
I don't know if it's real
Or if it's all in my head
Find my bones among the dead
Never see the light again

Pray to the god of death
Necro toxic
Eternal unrest
Lie in your grave like the rest
Hold my breath
Suffocate to death

Pray to the god of death
