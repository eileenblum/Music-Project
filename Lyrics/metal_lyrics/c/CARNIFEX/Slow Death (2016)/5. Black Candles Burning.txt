Promise me you'll leave me to die
Scream
Let the suffering begin
These are the voices of all the undead
Cries
I swear it'll never end

Bury me
Forget I was ever alive

Black candles burning
And it's hell inside my head
Let me die and be forgotten
This is the anthem of the undead

This is the anthem of the undead

My soul and death forever entwined 
Like a noose around my neck

Until the sun fails to set
There is no escape
Death obsessed 

Promise me you'll leave me to die
Leave the knife in 
Watch the life drain my eyes

Promise me you'll leave me to die
It's too late 
This is my last goodbye

Bury me
Forget I was ever alive

Black candles burning
And it's hell inside my head
Let me die and be forgotten
This is the anthem of the undead

Until the sun fails to set
There is no escape
Death obsessed 

There is no escape
Death obsessed
