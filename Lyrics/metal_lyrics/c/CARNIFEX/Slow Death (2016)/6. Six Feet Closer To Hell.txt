If the world's going to end then let it end
On my knees I'm sick to death
Put that bullet in the barrel
And we know what happens next

This is the end
I feel it in my chest
Laid in rest

If the world's gonna end then let it fucking end
I'll be right here as the flames burns bright
We're all dying in slow motion
Nameless, faceless and hopeless

Die without hope
Got stuck inside my head
Every word I wrote gets me closer to the end
Dreams of death just for pretend
A final breath, laid to rest

Six feet closer to hell
I feel
Six feet closer to hell
Six feet closer to hell

A final breath, laid to rest
A final breath, laid to rest

These are words for the hopeless
Only they would understand
Cut us open, torn and broken
I ... just like death

Just let me slip away
I have myself to blame
Let the blood fill my lungs
I hear the dead scream my name

If the world's gonna end then let it fucking end
I'll be right here as the flames burns bright
We're all dying in slow motion
Nameless, faceless and hopeless
Hopeless, hopeless

Six feet closer to hell
Six feet closer to hell

If the world's gonna end then let it end
On my knees I'm sick to death
Put that bullet in the barrel
And we know what happens next

This is the end
I feel it in my chest
Laid to rest

Die without hope
Got stuck inside my head
Every word I wrote gets me closer to the end
Dreams of death just for pretend
A final breath, laid to rest

Six feet closer to hell
I feel
Six feet closer to hell
Six feet closer to hell

[2x]
A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell
