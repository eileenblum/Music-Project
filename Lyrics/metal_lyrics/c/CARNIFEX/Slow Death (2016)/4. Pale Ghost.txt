I'm just a ghost on this earth
Sharpen your words
I want it to hurt

I'm secrets you'll never keep
When you bury me
Bury me deep

I'm just a ghost on this earth
Sharpen your words
I want it to hurt

Goodbye for the last time
When I close my eyes
It's hell inside

This is me drifting away
So write sorry on my grave
I'm dead inside
And I live for the pain
It's not what I wanted
But what I became

You are the blood in my lungs
Everything I hate
But can't help but love

Death bed confession
My true love
Is my depression

You are the blood in my lungs
Everything I hate
But can't help but love

A pale ghost that dies
A world without light
With nothing left inside

This is me drifting away
So write sorry on my grave
I'm dead inside
And I live for the pain
It's not what I wanted
But what I became

This is the end, it's to dark to see
Only death could love me for me

Black out
Let go
Give up
I've heard those words so fucking much

This is me drifting away
So write sorry on my grave
I'm dead inside
And I live for the pain
It's not what I wanted
But what I became

I'm dead inside and I live for the pain
