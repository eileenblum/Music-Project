Leave this world to die on it's knees
On it's knees
Rest in pain
Every song is a room where I watch myself bleed
Ghosts of lost love
Dreams of death just because 
Leaving this world to die on it's knees

On it's knees

Are these the voices of my dead friends
They put these words in my mouth
And this gun to my head

You and me bleed deaths melody
Dark Heart Ceremony
Hold your breath and lets fade away
As sick as our secrets and we're both the same

Rest in pain

Embraced by the darkness of night
These words are my prison
Lifeless inside
A pool of blood 
A life that once was
Somethings were never meant to be

Are these the voices of my dead friends
They put these words in my mouth 
And this gun to my head

You and me bleed deaths melody
Dark Heart Ceremony
Hold your breath and lets fade away
As sick as our secrets and we're both the same

We're both the same

Rest in pain
Leave the world to die on it's knees
Rest in pain
Now hold your breath and lets fade away
Rest in pain

You and me bleed deaths melody
Dark Heart Ceremony
Hold your breath and lets fade away
As sick as our secrets and we're both the same

Rest in pain
Leave the world to die on it's knees
Rest in pain
Now hold your breath and lets fade away
Rest in pain
