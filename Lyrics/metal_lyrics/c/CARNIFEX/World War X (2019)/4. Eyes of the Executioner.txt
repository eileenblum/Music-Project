This is the blade as it breaks your skin
Everything you fucking love dying in the end
I can feel the dead as they dance upon my grave
Voices in the void and I dare not speak their name
This is the face of death
The face that takes your life
That voice inside a suicidal mind
It speaks at night and says it's fine
Truth or fiction, let's find the line
Oh death, save me
Death save me

Eyes sewn shut
Let me die while I dream
Of suicide and other comforts
Things I never should have seen
I was born with blades in my blood
Eyes of the executioner

I am the world broken in two
I am your Christ stillborn in the womb
Spill your guts
No one gives a fuck

One more voice that echoes inside my head
Silent at first but now I know it won't stop until I'm dead
These are words I never should have wrote
Now you know my secret, my sick second self
Death save me

Eyes sewn shut
Let me die while I dream
Of suicide and other comforts
Things I never should have seen
I was born with blades in my blood
Eyes of the executioner

One more voice that echoes inside my head
And it won't stop until I'm dead

I am the world broken in two
I am your Christ stillborn in the womb
Spill your guts
No one gives a fuck
