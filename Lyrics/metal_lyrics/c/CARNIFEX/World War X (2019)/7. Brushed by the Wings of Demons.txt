Feed my body to the furnace
Write my name in the ash and then burn it
Follow me down into obscenities
They took the words from my mouth
And they never let me breathe

Brushed by the wings of demons
Crushed by the hand of God

Cry out to no one
My ghosts are all gone
Now it ends in blood

My demons, they sleep side by side
Coming alive in the dead of night
Secrets so cold as death and suicide
Eternally dreaming of their past lives

Brushed by the wings of demons
Crushed by the hand of God
The forest echoes only death
My final words on crimson breath
The fields painted red with blood
Red with blood

My demons, they sleep side by side
Coming alive in the dead of night
Secrets so cold as death and suicide
Eternally dreaming of their past lives

[Guitar solo]

My demons, they sleep side by side
Coming alive in the dead of night
Secrets so cold as death and suicide
Eternally dreaming of their past lives

Brushed by the wings of demons
Crushed by the hand of God
The forest echoes only death
My final words on crimson breath
The fields painted red with blood
Brushed by the wings of demons
Crushed by the hand of God
The forest echoes only death
My final words on crimson breath
The fields painted red with blood
