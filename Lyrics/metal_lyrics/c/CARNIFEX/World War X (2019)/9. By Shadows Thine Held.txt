All their souls, they speak to me
Confessing every sin I never wanted to see
All their souls, they speak to me

Like razor blades, they cut away
At the strings that hold my heart
One more cut and it falls apart
One more cut and it falls apart
A hole in my chest where there should be a heart

I'd sell my soul just so death can take me back
By shadows I am held
Buried with the bodies of the past
All those words, I just can't take them back
By shadows I am held
Buried with the bodies of the past

All their souls, they speak to me
Confessing every sin I never wanted to see
All their souls, they speak to me

There is a ghost just behind my eyes
No hands to move, no tongue to lie
Just a thought, meant just for me
No lungs to breathe, no eyes to see
It's not my head and it's not my heart
It has no face, just a voice in the dark

They cast their shadow but can never be seen
I hear their words but never see them speak
They cast their shadows but can never be seen
Never be seen

I'd sell my soul just so death can take me back
By shadows I am held
Buried with the bodies of the past
All those words, I just can't take them back
By shadows I am held
Buried with the bodies of the past

Let this world fade to black

I dream in silence and sorrow
Untold nightmares of horrors unseen
I dream in silence and sorrow
Untold nightmares of horrors unseen
I swear I won't see tomorrow
Let go and take these ghosts from me
Let go, take from these ghosts from me
