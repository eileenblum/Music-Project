Servants of death that feast on the marrow of the silent undead
Find solace in the grave from the voices in my head
And you will face death on your knees, on your knees

One more nightmare that I'd kill to forget
One more nightmare that I'd kill to forget
I can't remember the last time I felt as numb as this
I am a ghost behind these eyes

All roads lead to hell
It'll get worse before it gets better
Every word's a lie but I won't remember
All roads lead to hell
I can see heaven just out of reach
Only God forgives but not me

Bow down and weep for them
Crucify the soul of man
Drag that blade and say hello to forever
One last goodbye you'll always remember

Screams in the void, a silent prison cell
Echoes of death and visions of hell
Held in the arms of death eternal
Born into flames of the infernal

One more nightmare that I'll kill to forget
I can't remember the last time I felt as numb as this
I am a ghost behind these eyes

All roads lead to hell
It'll get worse before it gets better
Every word's a lie but I won't remember
All roads lead to hell
I can see heaven just out of reach
Only God forgives but not me

One more nightmare that I'll kill to forget

Bow down and weep for them
Crucify the soul of man
Drag that blade and say hello to forever
One last goodbye you'll always remember
