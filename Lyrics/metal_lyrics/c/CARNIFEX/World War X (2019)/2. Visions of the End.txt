You won't see it when it happens
The night that it all crashes
Welcome to infernal suffering
The embers in the wind, evolution eclipsed
Is this what you wanted to see?
Drowned out, then erased from history
The premeditated murder of millions
Now we burn

Behead the king
Pierce their flesh
Crush their soul
Bleed them all

The sun goes black and the sky bleeds red
As you kneel before the lords of death
Behead the king
Pierce their flesh
Crush their soul
Bleed them all
Bleed them all

No return
The scars of man map the valley of death
No return
Visions of the end drag heaven to the depths
No return
The scars of man map the valley of death
No return
Visions of the end drag heaven to the depths

Black ash that rains from the sky
A torrent of flames that leaves none alive
Drown us in fire and burn out our eyes
Drown us in fire and burn out our eyes
Scream 'til you bleed, the gods won't hear you
Die on your knees, the world won't miss you

The sun goes black and the sky bleeds red
As you kneel before the lords of death
Behead the king
Pierce their flesh
Crush their soul
Bleed them all
Bleed them all

No return
The scars of man map the valley of death
No return
Visions of the end drag heaven to the depths
No return
The scars of man map the valley of death
No return
Visions of the end drag heaven to the depths

Visions of end and the destruction
Of the life of every human
Premeditated murder of millions
This world was meant to burn
Visions of end and the destruction
Of the life of every human
Premeditated murder of millions
This world was meant to burn
This world was meant to burn
