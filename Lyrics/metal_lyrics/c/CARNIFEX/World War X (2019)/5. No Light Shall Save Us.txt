[feat. Alissa White Gluz][Alissa White-Gluz:]
No light shall save us
No light shall save us
No light shall save us
No light shall save us

[Scott Ian Lewis:]
Dark are the souls buried in the depths
Drawn forth to serve then die again
Palms carved on the altars of death
With one command, to hell descend

[Scott Ian Lewis, Scott Ian Lewis &amp; Alissa White-Gluz:]
Blessed are the damned
As they're screaming for answers
Humanity's mass grave, buried in disasters
This is the echo of their last words
This hell is home
Scorched earth seduction
Now you die alone
This hell is home
From above and below
Death enthroned

[Scott Ian Lewis &amp; Alissa White-Gluz, Alissa White-Gluz:]
We stole the stars from the sky
From the hand of God to death divine
We stole the light from their eyes
Condemning the world to eternal night

[Scott Ian Lewis, Alissa White-Gluz, Both:]
Above the Earth we command the flames
In the dead of night on ravens' wings
Only to return when the Earth is dust
No light shall save us
No light

[Scott Ian Lewis &amp; Alissa White-Gluz:]
Dark are the souls buried in the depths
Drawn forth to serve then die again
Palms carved on the altars of death
With one command, to hell descend

[Scott Ian Lewis]
Swept away in apocalyptic rapture
Death of the Earth and everything after
Until the oceans turn black
We might find the light
But we'll never find our way back

[Guitar solo: Jordan Lockrey]

[Alissa White-Gluz, Scott Ian Lewis, Both:]
We stole the stars from the sky
From the hand of God to death divine
We stole the light from their eyes
Condemning the world to eternal night
We stole the stars from the sky
We stole the light from their eyes
Night (Night)

[Scott Ian Lewis, Alissa White-Gluz, Both:]
Above the Earth we command the flames
In the dead of night on ravens' wings
Only to return when the Earth is dust
No light shall save us
No light shall save us
No light
