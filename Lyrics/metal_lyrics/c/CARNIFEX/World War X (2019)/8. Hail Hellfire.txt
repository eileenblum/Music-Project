Witness the invocation of absolute death
I am the pale rider, I am apocalypse
Command, conquer, rule with hellish intent
Your eyes go black, paint it all red, a bullet in the fucking head
Burned, buried
The slaughter of every soul
Burned, buried
Death to all
Death to all

This grotesque embodiment of man before me
Pure fucking poison but now it's all I see
Bodies find their way into shallow crimson graves
All heaven lies in ruin, all angels slayed
No more songs or prayers, only screams
No more fields, just death and disease

All hail hellfire
This is true fear
All hail hellfire
The end is here
All hail hellfire

Endless soulless dead march on the backs of friends
A knife in the neck, praise death, humanity is dead

This grotesque embodiment of man before me
Pure fucking poison but now it's all I see
It's all I see
No prayers, only screams
No saviors, only disease

No prayers, only screams
No saviors, only disease

Bodies find their way into shallow crimson graves
All heaven lies in ruin, all angels slayed
No more songs or prayers, only screams
No more fields, just death and disease

All hail hellfire
This is true fear
All hail hellfire
The end is here
All hail hellfire
