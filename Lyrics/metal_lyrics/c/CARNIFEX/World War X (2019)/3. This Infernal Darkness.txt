Give into death
Give into death
Just when you thought you knew who I was
I'll leave you choking on your own blood
Now bleed

Down on your hands and knees
Bleed yourself for me
You built this coffin, now lie in it
You dug this grave, now die in it

Cast from heaven and into the deepest seas
This infernal darkness has always been a part of me
Am I even flesh or am I just bones?
Maybe I'm a ghost that wanders hell alone
Only speak my name when you read it from my grave
Death's forgotten children, and we can't be saved
These are thoughts I never should have spoke
Words became blades as they slip through the flesh of my throat

Give into death
Just when you thought you knew who I was
I'll leave you choking on your own blood
Now bleed
Bleed yourself for me
Down on your hands and knees
Bleed yourself for me

Cast from heaven and into the deepest seas
This infernal darkness has always been a part of me
Am I even flesh or am I just bones?
Maybe I'm a ghost that wanders hell alone
Only speak my name when you read it from my grave
Death's forgotten children, and we can't be saved
These are thoughts I never should have spoke
Words became blades as they slip through the flesh of my throat

Lay me in death's bed as I dream of eternal sleep
I can feel their breath like they're right next to me
Horrors in the dark that only I can see
Death is all I need

Give into death
Give into death

Cast from heaven and into the deepest seas
This infernal darkness has always been a part of me
Am I even flesh or am I just bones?
Maybe I'm a ghost that wanders hell alone
Cast from heaven and into the deepest seas
This infernal darkness has always been a part of me
Am I even flesh or am I just bones?
Maybe I'm a ghost that wanders hell alone
