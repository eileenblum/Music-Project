Death to all humanity

Hail the night, hail despair
Drink in the sickness of death in the air

Suffer in sulfur, absolute fear
Hell is here
The soul of man, lost to the void
Humanity destroyed

Now the dead dance
Set free at last
To spread hate and fear
Slip through the earth
And into the flames
Everything dies today

Death worship
Death worship

War in the wind and hell in my lungs
No spoken words, only napalm and guns
Bury the earth in the flames of the sun
World War X
War in the wind and hell in my lungs
No spoken words, only napalm and guns (World War X)
Bury the earth in the flames of the sun
World War X
World War X
World War X
World War

Bow before the new necropolis
Bow before the altars of death
Bow before the new necropolis, oh

Scorn from the sky
Scorn from the earth as it's burning alive
Burning in space, universal demise
Heaven and earth beyond the reach of the light

Suffer in sulfur, absolute fear
Hell is here
The soul of man, lost to the void
Humanity destroyed

Death worship
Death worship

War in the wind and hell in my lungs
No spoken words, only napalm and guns
Bury the earth in the flames of the sun
World War X
War in the wind and hell in my lungs
No spoken words, only napalm and guns
Bury the earth in the flames of the sun
World War X

Burn the flags and bow to the gun
Born to kill 'cause that's how wars are won
Burn the flags and bow to the gun
Born to kill 'cause that's how wars are won
