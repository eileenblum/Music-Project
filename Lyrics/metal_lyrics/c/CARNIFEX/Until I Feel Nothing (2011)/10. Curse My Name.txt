Pour your hate inside me.

Iâve traded my enemies for friends,
Another day thatâs a means to an end.
I am the reason youâre screaming to survive,
Hold you in my arms and let you bleed from the inside.

My words will poison the world.

Left to eat the ashes of love, hate and greed;
Metaphors for this cancer that is killing me.

I am the reason youâre screaming to survive,
Hold you in my arms and let you bleed from the inside.

Pour your hatred inside me.

Bury your secrets so deep they die.
After all these years,
It only seems right.

Left to eat the ashes of love, hate and greed;
Metaphors for this cancer that is killing me.

Iâve traded my enemies for friends,
Another day thatâs a means to an end.
