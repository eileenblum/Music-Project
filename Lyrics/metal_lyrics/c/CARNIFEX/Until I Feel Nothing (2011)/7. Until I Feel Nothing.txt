Words like nails and now youâll feel the scratch.
A voice in my head says,
âNever look back.â

Watch me dig my own grave,
My own grave.

Thereâs nothing left to love.
Thereâs a lot left to hate.
Everything inside seems dead,
Let me live this lie instead.
Iâve got blood on my hands,
One thing God wonât understand.
Never to escape this grave of place,
The day that God gave upon grace.

Rip my lungs from my chest.
Tear me apart until thereâs nothing left.
I donât feel anything,
Until thereâs nothing left of me.
Until I feel nothing.
Until thereâs nothing left of me.
Until I feel nothing.

Till the sun burns out or until I put my fucking eyes out.
Whatâs worse?
This world or my only way out?

This world or my only way out?

So I was there the whole time.
Forgotten when the world went blind.
Lower me down,
Six faces watch me,
Lay me in the ground.

Words like nails and now youâll feel the scratch.
A voice in my head says,
âNever look back.â

Thereâs nothing left to love.
Thereâs a lot left to hate.
Everything inside seems dead,
Let me live this lie instead.
Iâve got blood on my hands,
One thing God wonât understand.
Never to escape this grave of place,
The day that God gave upon grace.

Rip my lungs from my chest.
Tear me apart until thereâs nothing left.
I donât feel anything,
Until thereâs nothing left of me.
Until I feel nothing.
Until thereâs nothing left of me.

Until I feel nothing.
