Letâs end it like this.
You wonât be fucking missed.
Iâm rotten to the core,
And you keep coming back for more.

I remember dreaming you died.

Letâs end it like this.
You wonât be fucking missed.
Iâm rotten to the core,
And you keep coming back for more.

I remember dreaming you died,
Dreaming you took a bath in cyanide.

Burn you half to death while you breathe formaldehyde.

I never noticed until you were gone.
Forever and always,
I guess we were both wrong.
I never thought that God was listening,
Never thought you would notice me missing,
A case of too little too late.
Swallow enough stones and pray I sink.

Infect me with your poison,
Fill my veins with hate,
Tell me itâs for my own good.

No one gets out alive,
Iâve heard this a thousand times.
Leave the razor in the cut;
To me sheâs just another fuck.

This hurts more than you thought,
You made me promise not to stop.
Iâll leave the razor in the cut.

Iâll leave the razor in the cut;
To me sheâs just another fuck.

Letâs end it like this.
You wonât be fucking missed.
Iâm rotten to the core,
And you keep coming back for more.

I remember dreaming you died,
Dreaming you took a bath in cyanide.
