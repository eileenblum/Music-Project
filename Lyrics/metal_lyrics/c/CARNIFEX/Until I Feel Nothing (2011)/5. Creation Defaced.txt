I dream of the end of the world,
As it dreams of the end of me.
Abandon all hope of leaving,
This world has no meaning.
Iâll drink your blood and never look back.
Iâll let you rot in hell and rip your heart in half.

This is why you and I will never see eye to eye.
This is why Iâll never dream with closed eyes.
Who needs love when pain feels alright?
Who needs truth when all I want is lies?

Iâll drink your blood and never look back.
Iâll let you rot in hell and rip your heart in half.

When will this feeling stop?
Will I die afraid?
Will I ever change?
Iâm just one wish away from hell or heartbreak,
The grave and Godâs face.

When will this feeling stop?
Will I die afraid?
Will I ever change?
Iâm just one wish away from hell or heartbreak,
The grave and Godâs face.

I dream of the end of this world,
As it dreams of the end of me.

I dream of the end of the world.

Iâll burn this world down,
Iâll burn this world down.

This is why you and I will never see eye to eye.
This is why Iâll never dream with closed eyes.
Who needs love when pain feels alright?
Who needs truth when all I want is lies?

Iâll burn this world down,
To the fucking ground.
Iâll burn this world down,
To the fucking ground.
