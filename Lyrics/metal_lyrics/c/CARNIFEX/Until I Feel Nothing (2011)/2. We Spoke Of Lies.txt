The worst is yet to come; thatâs what they said.
A noise, a whisper, just voices inside my head.
We spoke of lies that could raise the dead.
A noise, a whisper, just voices inside my head.

Phantom limbs and buried sins,
Iâm giving âundeadâ a whole ne meaning.
Buried at sea or buried with me,
This is my faith crashing.
Remove the heart from this machine,
Because all I want is an ending.

I can see the veins under my skin.
Deathâs hand is knocking,
Itâs time to let him in.
He can see my hollow heart and itâs too late to start again.
Bitter sweet is death to me,
Too fucked to start again.

Bitter sweet is death to me,
Too fucked to start again.

A dying breath while I eat the dead because nothing lasts forever.
Reconstruct this life for me,
I need lies to breathe.
Say a prayer to God for me,
Because only my sins are remembered.

We spoke of lies that could raise the dead.
These were eyes that could never see an angelâs wings in atrophy.
Am I alive or just breathing?
This world is dead to me.
A grave without a name is where youâll find me.

Just voices inside my head,
I can see the veins under my skin.
Deathâs hand is knocking,
Itâs time to let him in.
He can see my hollow heart and itâs too late to start again.
Bitter sweet is death to me,
Too fucked to start again.
