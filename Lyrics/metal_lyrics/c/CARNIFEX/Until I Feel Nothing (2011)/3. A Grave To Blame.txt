It starts with a letter to this cruel world,
Saying goodbye without saying a word.
These are songs you should have never heard.
Verses and curses of hate for this world.

Sixteen cuts and I didnât feel a single one.
A grave to blame, just one more and itâs done.
A letter to this cruel world,
Saying goodbye without saying a word.

This is why I hate the world,
Saying goodbye without saying a word.

Iâll watch you tell your last lie and count your breaths until you die.
When your faith comes undone,
Iâll drink from a river of blood.

Donât bother calling my name,
Iâll be watching the world decay.

It starts with a letter to this cruel world,
Saying goodbye without saying a word.
These are songs you should have never heard.
Verses and curses of hate for this world.

Sixteen cuts and I didnât feel a single one.
A grave to blame, just one more and itâs done.
A letter to this cruel world,
Saying goodbye without saying a word.

Am I the only one without a soul?
Am I the only one without something to sell?
Burn my flesh until your hearts desire,
The meek shall inherit the Earth.
Not if the walking dead do it first.

The meek shall inherit the Earth,
Not if the walking dead do it first.
Not if the walking dead do it first.
