I wished her life but death adored her.
They raped her corpse and all I did was mourn her.

Ate at her flesh until there was no more.
Iâll hang myself so she feels closer.

Catch her in her dreams,
Sheâs wishing she felt anything.
Catch me in my dreams,
This world gives me nothing.

Kill me in my dreams,
This world gives me nothing.
Kill me in my dreams;
This world is dead to me.

What if I just let you burn?
Donât say a fucking word.

Iâm here to bury me and Iâm here to bury you.

Come a little closer and tell me all your sins.
Thoughts of stolen innocence since you canât remember when.
Come a little closer and tell me all your lies.
I told you everything,
But there are some things you need to hide.

On your hands and knees,
Iâm only human and we all have needs.

Catch her in her dreams,
Sheâs wishing she felt anything.
Catch me in my dreams,
This world gives me nothing.

Kill me in my dreams,
This world gives me nothing.
Kill me in my dreams;
This world is dead to me.

Come a little closer and tell me all your sins.
Thoughts of stolen innocence since you canât remember when.
Come a little closer and tell me all your lies.
I told you everything,
But there are some things you need to hide.

On your hands and knees.
