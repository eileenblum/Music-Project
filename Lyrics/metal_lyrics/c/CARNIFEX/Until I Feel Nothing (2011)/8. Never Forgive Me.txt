Let me crawl into your casket and dream about the end.
Lock me inside so the devil canât get in.
How many times until you see,
Never forgive me.

Let me crawl into your casket and dream about the end.
Lock me inside so the devil canât get in.

This is when you watch your world crumble,
(This is when your world crumbles)
This is when you watch your world end,
(This is when the world ends.)

How many times will you look to me?
Thereâs nothing left to see.
This was never meant to be heartâs undone in tragedy.
How many times until you see?

Winters sorrow and no tomorrow,
Iâm here because I like it.
A dying breath while I eat the dead,
Because nothing tastes quite like it.
How many times until you see,
Never forgive me.

Fuck your hate, now feel mine.
How many times will you look to me?
Thereâs nothing left to see.
This was never meant to be heartâs undone in tragedy.
How many times until you see?

Let me crawl into your casket and dream about the end.
Lock me inside so the devil canât get in.
How many times until you see,
Never forgive me.

Never forgive me.
