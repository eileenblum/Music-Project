[Talking:] You know I may not have had sex but I can fuck you up. Yeah.

I'll make you suffer alone. And make you think it was meant to be.
I'll rip apart your soul. And make you think it was meant to be.

Close, close your eyes. And breath my, breath my lies. Breath my lies.

Collaborating like killers. Collaborating like killers.

All the beauty you'll never see. The things you'll never be. Never be.

Collaborating like killers. Collaborating like killers.
Collaborating like killers. Collaborating like killers.
