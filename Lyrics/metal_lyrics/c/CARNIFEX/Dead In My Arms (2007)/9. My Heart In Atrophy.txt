If only my words could capture my feelings
So thoughtless and empty, so void of any real meaning

It feels like I'm looking at life from the past
Half alive or half dead, I don't think I can last

Your thought freeze the blood to my heart
Kill the thoughts to my mind

When I walk by you'll never see me
When I crack a smile you'll never see me

I'm giving up I'm letting you drown

YOU CANT STOP ME NOW!
