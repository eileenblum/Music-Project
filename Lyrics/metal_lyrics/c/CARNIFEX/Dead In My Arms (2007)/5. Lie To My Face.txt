The scars on my arms remind me how i got this way
I can taste the stain of your sickness on my lips

Of all the stupid things in my life I fell for this
I fell for this

Ill ask again like you never knew
Just lie to me
Just lie to me..."Were gonna make it through"
I'm well past wanting the truth

Just lie to me...
"I'll always love you"

LIE TO MY FACE

The scars on my arms remind me how i got this way
Ill ask again like you never knew
Just lie to me
"I'll always love you"
