I never thought I'd see an angel without wings
I never thought that angel would bury me alive, bury me alive

Forgetting your name
Forgetting your face
Why did you have to mean so much to me?
So much to me?
I wish I knew then what I know now
Getting caught in the rain means so much to me Know I never thought I'd see an
angel without wings
I never thought that angel would bury me alive
