Behind my back I see you stare and you can not destroy me with your mindset of death.
This is a cry for hope, this is a prayer for love.
I'm bleeding, I'm begging.

I have a love. I have a life. I have a love.

C'mon
This is all I ask of you I'm begging you to take it away.
Away!!!

I'm begging you to take it away.
This is a cry for love, this is a prayer for hope. I'm bleeding, I'm begging.
[repeat]

For your love...For your love!

C'mon

This is all I ask of you. I'm begging you to take it away.
This is a cry for love. This is a prayer of hope. I'm bleeding. I'm begging.
I have a love, I have a life. I HAVE A LOVE.

C'mon
I have a love
C'mon
This is all I ask of you I'm begging you to take it away
