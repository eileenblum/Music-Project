I'll burn my whole life down just to get away from you.
I'll burn my whole life down just to never hear me and you.
I'll set it all on fire and you can listen to me drown just so you know were through.
Now lie awake at night and remember all those things you thought you'd never fell.
And when we leave this all behind us this failed fate will never find us.
This failed fate. This failed fate.
My failed fate.

I can feel her hand in the clockwork of my design.
Waiting for the hourglass to empty and choke on the sands of time.
I watched hope slip through my fingers knowing it would never be mine.

Tonight's the night all hope turns to dust.
Tonight's the night love fails to lust.
Another cycle, there's no mending my shattered heart.
Another cycle, you're just there to play the fucking part.

Heartless, you're just second rate and this is a half hearted suicide.
It hurts me know but in time I'll learn to forget everything about you.
I want to drag your face through pins and needles just to see if you lie as sweet when you're black and blue.

Now lie awake at night and remember all those things you thought you'd never feel.
And when we leave this all behind us this failed fate will never find us.

This is where it starts and this is where it will end.
with her open mouth and blood-stained cheeks and death starring in.

They all fuck the same, I can't say it enough. [2x]
