You don't think I know how this ends?
I've heard these words before and there more meaningless now then they were then.
It feels like I'm drowning and you're oceans away.
It feels like I'm drowning and you dragged me out to sea.
I've got nothing but hate in my heart now watch me tear you apart.
I've got nothing but hate in my heart.

Burn me to ashes , then burn the ashes.
I'll carry this hate till I'm in my grave.
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
Sorrowspell, my world will never be the same. [2x]

I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
I'll see you in hell.

My head was a house and all you brought in was lies.
My heart was our home and everything that lived there died.
Now my world shrinks and these four walls become a cell.
You told me the only way to heaven was to go through hell.

Burn me to ashes, then burn the ashes.
I'll carry this hate till I'm in my grave.
I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name.
Sorrowspell, my world will never be the same. [2x]

I'll see you in hell where the devil knows my name. [2x]

Won't you close my eyes and let me sleep through this sorrowspell.
I've giving so much and I've fallen so hard, I've got nothing left to tell.
Won't you close my eyes and let me sleep through this sorrowspell.
Won't you close my eyes.
