Wretched hands and tired eyes.
Born in death and reborn in lies.
Too long have I watched in silence too long have you haunted my steps.

I am bred to be broken, crush your bones and leave you choking.
I rose from the dead to make sure angels never sing again.
I wont stop till these mountains move.
I may not kill you but you'll die from the wounds.
Forty days and unholy nights my reign of terror only matches my might.

Eat the young and choke the screaming.
Feed on my flesh and bury the living.

Just one more fix then crawl back on your cross again.
Just one more fix before I crawl out of my skin and wish that I was dead again.
Just one more fix before you crawl on your cross again.
Just one more fix before I crawl out of my skin and wish that I was dead again.

Death take my hand and carry me to the light.
you'll find me hung beneath heaven letting go without a fight.

Wretched hands and tired eyes, born in death and reborn in lies.
Too long gave I watched  in silence. Too long have you haunted my steps.
I am bred to be broken, crush your bones and leave you choking.

I rose from the dead to make sure angels never sing again.
I wont stop till these mountains move.
I may not kill you but you'll die from the wounds.

Embraced by death this evil can't be stopped [2x]

Forty days and unholy nights my reign of terror only matches my might.
The grip of hell she holds so tight. Drowning in sin, just end this life. [2x]

Eat the young and choke the screaming.
Feed on my flesh and bury the living.
