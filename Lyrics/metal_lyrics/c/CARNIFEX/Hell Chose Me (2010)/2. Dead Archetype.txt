I am the soul of a nameless machine.
I can only breath, I can only breed, I can only bleed.
Bleed out over her wishing it was me.

It's a joke played by god ob you and me
A cruel act of divinity.
Only dreams of winters dead leaves.
Falling from tress
Falling on me.
Hanging three feet from the earth that I cant seem to leave.
This hurts, this hurts, this hurts.
All I can do is bleed with her.
This hurts

First I'll slit your throat and let you bleed out.
Then I'll use a knife to carve your eyes out. [2x]

Everyone missing our last laugh, just broken hearts and shattered glass.
just two ghosts from the past screaming love song.
Hung by your words, the wore me down.
I'm swimming out to sea and I don't want to be found.

Which one of you?
Tried to save me.
Which one of you?
Tried to stop me.
Which one of you?
Which one of you?

I am the soul of a nameless machine.
I can only breath, I can only breed, I can only bleed.
Bleed out over her wishing it was me.

It's a joke played by god ob you and me
A cruel act of divinity.
Only dreams of winters dead leaves.
Falling from tress.
Falling on me.
Hanging three feet from the earth that I cant seem to leave.
This hurts, this hurts. all I can do is dream of her.
