So typical, so ritual.
My sweetest memories lost in time.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
So typical, so ritual.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.
The past is the present and the future's just more absence.

I'm body without blood.
I'm digging a grave just for one.
This is a heart without a pulse and my inner demons won.
Somehow I knew I'd never see that second life.
Somehow I knew I'd die empty inside.
I should have been a liar because I've got a lot to hide.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.

I should have been a liar because I've got a lot to hide.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.

The next time we meet you'll have to tell my heart to beat.
The next time we meet you'll have to tell me to breath.
Sewing your mouth shut, I promise this is better for both of us.
No more tasting the past in the back of my throat, just a coffin full of lies and a preacher spewing one sick joke.
So typical, so ritual.
Twisted and forgotten I'm searching for what everyone seems to find.

I should have ate your heart because I can't feel mine.
I should have ate your heart.
