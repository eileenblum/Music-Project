This is the chorus of the lost undead, an anthem to welcome the hated i have bred.

Eternal damnation, I feel the worst is yet to come.
Breathe new life into this hollow cage.
A heart that's left undone.
The grief of a fallen legion,
A winterscape painted red with blood.
Watch as it spills from my lips to this page.
The lines of truth blurred into shades of gray.

Her lips so soft, oh mistress of hell she comforts me.
You hear me scream these words but do you know what they really mean?
You see the pain inside me but do you know what I've really seen?

As slowly rot and my flesh becomes ashes,
like the flames from a burning body, or the waves of an endless sea.
I'm gasping for breath all i really want is death.

Turn your back on the world and say goodbye to all of this.
Turn your back on the world and no one will ever notice.
These are just scattered ashes, this is my name spoken in past tense.
Turn your back on the world and no one will ever notice.

I can hear twilight's swan song play, I can feel sorrow's arms holding me in my grave.
I can hear twilight's swan song play, I can feel sorrow's arms holding me in my grave.
These songs belongs to the hearts of the dead, her words left to rot inside my head.

Here I stand at the edge of winter where frozen still life begins to thaw.
Death extols my emptiness behind my thoughts.

Buried alive for all too see.
A grave without a name is where you'll find me.
My fall from heaven.
The scope of obsession.
