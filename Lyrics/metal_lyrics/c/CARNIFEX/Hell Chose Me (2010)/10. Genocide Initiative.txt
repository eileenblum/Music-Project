This will make corpses of us all.
Old world burns and drives the machine of war.

Now close your eyes and picture your last sunset.
Sun has failed and moon is dead.
With hearts entwined laid to rest.
With slit throats now you see the joke of ever believing in me.
I'll be the shoulders to die on when truth doesn't set you free.
Crucify me one more time just so I can watch myself bleed.

There was a time when I thought my soul was saved but it was a little too slow and a little too late.
At the time I thought it meant everything, turns out it didn't mean anything.
It didn't mean anything.

I pray to god this kills you.
I pray this kills us both. [2x]

I'm begging for youth suicide and third term abortion.
I'm here to see purity's crucifixion and witness a genocide initiative.
Genocide initiative.

You'll have to cut away the smiles on my face after I get a taste.
Now close your eyes and picture your last sunset.
Sun has failed and moon is dead.
With hearts entwined laid to rest.
With slit throats now you see the joke of ever believing in me.
I'll be the shoulder to die on when truth doesn't set you free.
Crucify me one more time just so I can watch myself bleed.

There was a time when I thought my soul was saved but it was a little too slow and a little too late.
At the time I thought it meant everything, turns out it didn't mean anything.
