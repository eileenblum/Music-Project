These eyes I see don't even remind me of me.
I want to put the knife in and make you dirty on the inside.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
Beg for me.

My fate rests in the arms of hell.
I bought the dead and now they've come to collect.
By darkness enslaved with the heart strings of sorrow.
I sold my soul and solemn darkness fills the hole.
Part of me sleeps and part of me dreams.
A mouth full of rumors hands full of daggers in a room full of mirrors no god, no savior.

My own indifference is what separates me from the pain.
Razor blade victims breaking the skin just to pour the hate back in.
Just to pour the hate back in.

I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees, beg for me.
Beg for me.

These eyes I see don't even remind me of me.
I want to put the knife in and make you dirty on the inside.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
Beg for me.

Pushing the needle through the stitching has began to wear.
Only I can tell you when this sickness will end.

My fate rests in the arms of hell.
I bought the dead and now they've come to collect.
By darkness enslaved with the heart strings of sorrow.
I sold my soul and solemn darkness fills the hole.
Part of me sleeps and part of me dreams.
A mouth full of rumors hands full of daggers in a room full of mirrors no god, no savior.

I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees.
I want to see you crawl on your hands and knees, beg for me.
