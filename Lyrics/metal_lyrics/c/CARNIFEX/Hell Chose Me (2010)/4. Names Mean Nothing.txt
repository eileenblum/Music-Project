It's time you see the world for what it truly is.
A dead whore who's last words were fuck me again.
It's time you see me for who I really am.
I'm the walking wounded bleeding
clever lies from within.
These hands have held the bloody corpse of my dead lover.

And with your skin stretched tight I'll beat you till you're blind.
I'll do it to you before you can do it to me because we share the same sickness inside.
And with our hands clasped tight you'll beg me not to try but I'll do it to you
before you can do it too me because we share the same sickness inside.

I want to forget your face.
I want to forget the way you fucking taste. [2x]

Names mean nothing now.
My eyes only see the blackest of the black.
Waiting for the kiss from god's fallen children and there's no turning back.
There's no turning back.

It's time you see the world for what it truly is.

before you can do it too me because we share the same sickness inside.

Your not so perfect.
Just fucking plastic.
Just fucking plastic.

Names mean nothing now.
My eyes only see the blackest of the black.
Waiting for the kiss from god's fallen children and there's no turning back.
[2x]
