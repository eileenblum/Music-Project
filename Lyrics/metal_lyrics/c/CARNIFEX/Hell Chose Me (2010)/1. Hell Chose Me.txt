With weapons of war in my hands I will become what begs to be forgotten.
With weapons of war in my hands burning to purge this faithless nation.
These are the eyes, I am the mastermind sent to open gods gates and tear down heaven.
Tear down heaven.

You are the programed dead set to look me straight in the face and I'll tell you what separates this truth from faith.
These lies I preach ever extending my reach inside your head. [2x]

And with my scriptures I will summon the serpents tongue,
these words will become walls keeping angels from the light of the son.
This congregation rains like cinders from the sky.
The product of childhood nightmares.
Empty hopes behind empty eyes.
Open your ears, hear my sweet tragedy, open your mouth and drink my sick blasphemy.

Empty hopes behind empty eyes.

I'm crushing the hope of the saved.
Haunted, dark and driven insane.
This is my unholy rapture.
Oh lord is this not your desire?

With weapons of war in my hands I will become what begs to be forgotten
With weapons of war in my hands burning to purge this faithless nation.
These are the eyes, I am the mastermind sent to open gods gates and tear down heaven.
Tear down heaven.

You are the programed dead set to look me straight in the face.
I'll tell you what separates this truth from faith.
These lies I preach ever extending my reach inside your head.

God damn this world
God damn my life
I didn't choose hell
Hell choose me

Hell choose me [4x]
