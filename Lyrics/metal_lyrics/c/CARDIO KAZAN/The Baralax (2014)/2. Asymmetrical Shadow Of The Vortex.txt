[feat. Matt Anderson of Adestria]Oh! Andromeda
My dear Andromeda
Do you believe in me as I believe in you?
As I can see my corpse traumatize from above
Donât send me back to that black hearse
Iâm alive!

Afflictions as nebulas!
That pull me in and explain that there is no scape
Confiding my desires
Iâm interred alive

Suffocation!
Defiance between whatâs fiction and whatâs tangible
(Tangible)
Enter my conscience and make this eternal
Divided fractions of an echo
The fragments of my desperation
A claustrophobic resignation
My spirit is attracted to earth as the carrionâ¦ in dead silence moves
A chronicle catalepsy I was looking to conserve!
Nebulas open the vortex between the living and the dead
My extremities are awaken down earth
My phobias are farm an end

No amity growsâ¦no! [2x]
(From scion to earth)
Orion has stopped to shine
Confiding myâ¦ desires
Iâm still alive!
No amity growsâ¦no! [2x]
Orion has stopped to shine
Iâm still alive!

Nebulas open the vortex between the living and the dead sending the spirits back. And they whisperâ¦ move!
