I want to get to that star,
I need to escape from myself,
So far, so close, completely lost,
[2x]

Without a guidance,
All that I was looking for has vanished with my hope,
Oh, tonight, my guts are burning,
Tonight âbecause Iâm sure, I canât hold on like this,
So far, so close to reach that star and finally,
Start again,
This will live in my mind, the stars Iâll reach tonight,
I know, infinity is not that far,
As long as I breathe tonight.

I want to get to that star,
I need to escape from myself,
So far, so close, completely lost,

And tonight,
Tonight,
Tonight,
All lights will shine above,

Tonight,
Tonight,
All lights will shine above,

Donât try to stop me,
This for myself,
For the sake of everyone around me!

(Around me)
This for myself,
For the sake of everyone around me!

No matter the distance now!
[3x]

This will live in my mind,
The stars Iâll reach tonight,
I know, infinity is not that far,
As long as I breathe tonight,
This will live in my mind,
The stars Iâll reach tonight,
(Infinity is not that far)

Infinity is not that far,
Infinity is not that far,
This will live in my mind,
As long as I breathe tonight,
This will live in my mind
