[feat. Ronnie Winter of The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]Whatâs wrong?
I barely feel my lungs,
Thereâs metal covering all!
Everythingâs dark, am I still asleep?

Are this magnetic hands
Meant to decipher what Iâve done?
Or these machines were placed to push me and pull the plug?

Iâm holding my breath,
(Iâm holding against this face, am I losing control?)

All these feelings are remaining closer inside,
All these feelings that beneath me burn slow inside

Blocked!
By the coma, like an ordeal of mind
Induced with fragments from another life.

Am I enduring a loss?
A loss of someone I donât know?
(I stretched to the mirror)
(Iâm an aversion!)

My hands have been changed for ones of steel,
An abomination standing still.
Who I was has gone away,
[2x]

All these feelings are remaining closer inside,
All these feelings that beneath me burn slow inside

Who I was has goneâ¦ gone away
My hands have been changed for ones of steel
An abomination standing steel
Who I was has gone awayâ¦

Away!!!
Has gone away!
Gone away!
Has gone away!

Iâm an aversion!

There is no morphing to keep me healed, my clots turn gray as this serum who I was has gone away, all these feelings are remaining closer inside, all these feelings that beneath me burn slow inside.
