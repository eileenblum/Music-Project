The pendulum stops!
A fire storm,
A demon seems to crawl,
Across the floor and Iâm alone,
As it gets closer,
The chandeliers turn off,
It drags me closer to a gate,
As I try to escape,

I have seen this in my dream since I recall,
But bruises appeared today,
My fingernails peeled,
I hear voices in my head,

Thereâre no words or images
(Giving sense of security)
But Iâll hold on to my faith,
As I figure what this means,
This means to me,

Tremble!

My senses are starting to tremble!
Reveal to me!!
(To me)
(Reveal to me)

You despicable being!
(Being)

The parallels for this madness completely outreached,
Is there a reason for this?
Calamities unfold from within,
(From within)

Reaper!

My soul separates from my anatomy,
Am I the reaper?
Calamities unfold from within,

Thereâre no words or images
(Giving sense of security)
But Iâll hold on to my faith
As I figure what this means,
This means to me,
To me,

I will face my fears again,
As I dream for the last time,
As I dream for the last time,
Now I stand before his eyes,
There is a reason for this,
As our eyes meet melodies in unison say,
You belong here.
