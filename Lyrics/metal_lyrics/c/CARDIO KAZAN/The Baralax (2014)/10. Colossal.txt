Memories gone as a myth
But you are not quite sure anymore,
Your symmetry hasnât drawn the plan of god,

Anymore,
Catastrophic symphonies unclear in your head,
Cataclysms in a diurnal phase and grade,
Invigorate your misery, sour moments,

Bittersweet events, but when those tears come out at night, you are not alone

Experiences will die,
The how will you learn?
Let orbits align
Avoiding scenes,
You should know,
Penumbras reach for the past,
On your silhouette lies, your chance to survive

Sour moments, bittersweet events,
On your silhouette lies, your chance to survive

Cease, follow my words,
Follow my voice,
Let me go to the core
Devouring your thoughts,
Collecting your ashes as the eclipse is on,

Let me go!!

Sour moments, bittersweet events,
On your silhouette lies, your chance to survive

Experiences will die,
The how will you learn?
Let orbits align
Avoiding scenes,
You should know,
Penumbras reach for the past,
On your silhouette lies, your chance to survive
Avoiding scenes,
Avoiding scenes,
From the past,
From the past
Then how will you learn?

(How will you learn?)
