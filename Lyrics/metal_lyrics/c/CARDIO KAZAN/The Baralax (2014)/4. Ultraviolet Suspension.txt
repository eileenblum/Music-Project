Suspend in time
Go breathe new life
Don't collide
Between dreams and lights

It seems to me the time has come to pray together
'Cause there's no angels gathered and you are not alone
It seems to me the time has come to pray together

Seems the room is falling from side to side
The walls are crashing down and you seem just fine
Your body glows in colors, your eyes go blind
But there's no angels

It feels you are breaking away
(Breaking away)
And leaving us behind
There's light that comes from your veins
(Breaking away)
It's time to say goodbye

It seems to me the time has come to pray together
'Cause there's no angels gathered and you are not alone

Are you still with me?
Are you still here with us?
Even that my grief kills me I know it was too damn much
It hurts the most
That I can't let you go
It's true that you have suffer more than you should
Oh dear god

(Suspend in time, go breathe new life)
There's no halo, no angels, rounding your soul

It feels you are breaking away
(Breaking away)
And leaving us behind
There's light that comes from your veins
(Breaking away)
It's time to say goodbye

(Say goodbye)

It seems to me the time has come to pray together
'Cause there's no angels gathered and you are not alone

It seems to me the time has come to pray together
Are you still with me? Are you still here with us?

It seems to me the time has come to pray together
'Cause there's no angels gathered and you are not alone
