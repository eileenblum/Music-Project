Why, tears start dropping out?
And breathing feels just wrong?
The pills are not working
I'm feeling weaker now,
Again Iâm standing on
The same place of yesterdayâ¦

Words fade away
Serenity will make its way
Whatâs happening?
'Cause it feels familiar everything
Everything!

I must move on
It's what I need
But somehow I can't say you're gone

The exit door
It's right next to me
I wanna know whoâs whispering run

No!
This is unreal!
I scream, you're not real!
(You are not real!!)

Suddenly, my hands in blood are filled
I feel guilty in every dropping tear.
Do you remember? The voice again
Appears.
Everything's unreal,

Everything's unreal.

I must move on
It's what I need
But somehow I can't say you're gone

The exit door
It's right next to me
But somehow I can't say you're gone

You're gone!!!

Oh, you're gone!!
