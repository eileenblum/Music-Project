One step close,
As vertigo grows,
The wind makes its roar,
Iâm close to the edge of the world,
Morbidity breaks them apart.

Could I?
Horizons show reflections on
A painting like a dying art,
Could I?
Iâve only recognized my sons
Vanishing as entities through the dusk,

One last time,
As a shattered sign,
I held my arms up high,
But there isnât any response,
Iâm chasing the skyline.

Iâm chasing the skyline.

But there is a circus going on 100 stories down,
With my hands held high take me instead of my sons!

No one will touch you,
No one will touch you,
No one will touch you.
I swore so many times,
[2x]

Take me instead of my sons!
This is a diversion,
Iâm in the verge of exploding,
As the cliff where Iâm hanging,
Seems to get shorter,
I donât want to know I was meant to survive,
I donât want to know this was part of your design,

No one will touch you,
No one will touch you,
No one will touch you.
I swore so many times,
[2x]

There is a riot waiting for the moment I fall.
One last time, as a shattered sign I held my arms up high,
But there isnât any response,
Iâm chasing the skyline.
