[feat. Don Vedda of Jamieâs Elsewhere]Itâs almost dawn again on earth,
Iâm in the need to see if everything has changed,
One hundred suns have passed the area,
Iâve counted many constellations to keep me sane,
Integrity disrupted,
(Integrity disrupted)
No shooting stars to plead for new beginnings,
But, do I deserve one?
(But, do I deserve one?)
Iâve devastated everything created,
As the stars fail to answer why,
I ask myself for the ones I love,

The sky falls,
Disarming the pieces Iâve wrote,
The sky falls,
Exposing this place is now home,

For years Iâve sat and watched
The window searching for a new beginning,
One hundred miles from us,
One hundred lives between you and me,
As the stars fail to answer why,
The brightness starts to fade from the sun I have followed,

The sky falls
Disarming the pieces Iâve wrote,
The sky falls exposing this place is now home,

Bear with me,
Bear with me
As I turn my eyes to the sun
The pieces Iâve wrote,

Bear with me
Bear with me
As I turn my eyes to the sun
This place is now home

As the stars fail to answer why,
I ask myself for the ones I love,
[2x]

The sky falls
Disarming the pieces Iâve wrote,
The sky falls exposing
This place is now home!
