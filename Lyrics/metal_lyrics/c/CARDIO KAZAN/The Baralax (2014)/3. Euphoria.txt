Speak to me
Should I feel guilty at all?
Preach to me!
While Iâm tempting all of the world diluted in
As seconds become centuries Iâmâ¦ now agonizing
The clincher is still unknown

Enigmas flow,
Bear with me now
The aura collapses breaking apart
The shield Iâve created
As shades from a kaleidoscope
A luminous ray confirms the possession has ended
Donât you dare to turn your back on us now!
I am a cannibal!
I have lost guilt to erase all the weak ones

It seems alive.
It seems alive.
This undesired rage
[2x]

âCause Iâm limitless
Afraid to unleash this force
Destroying it all

Scriptures.
Absolutely wrong,
History will change when I open the threshold.
I am the apsis,
I am evolution,
Would you canonize me like any other saint?

No ears to hear,
No eyes to blame on.
Where have you been? Because Iâve been here on my own.

It seems alive,
It seems alive,
This undesired rage.
[2x]

âCause Iâm limitless afraid to unleash this forceâ¦ destroying it all.

Limitless!
Afraid to unleash this force,
Destroying it all.

I am a cannibal!
Resembling the arsonist I was meant to be,
Power to inflict sorrow on me.
Power to redeem,
Revenge that I seek.
Donât you close your eyes?
Donât you close your eyes!
I have lost guilt to erase all the weak ones

Destroy them all.
