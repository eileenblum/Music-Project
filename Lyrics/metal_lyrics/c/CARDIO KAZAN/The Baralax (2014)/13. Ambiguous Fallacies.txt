Below the waves,
Below the waves there is a whole new world under the sea,

I can patiently wait,
I can assure you this fallacy is true,
A heaven below resides under the sea,
You canât levitate,
Iâm walking on the water but the inertia pulls me through,
At midnight weâre free to dive under the sea,
Thereâs a whole new world
Underneath the sea,

âCause you canât levitate,
The breaking point to choose has come a stage,
The flood is reaching your lungs,
And your blood is still crimson red,

Do you still feel sadness?
Below the waves
Below the waves
They swim with no remorse at all,

Itâs all you can see?
An excuse to leave everyone behind,
Thereâs more than meets the eye,
There will be no glory after you die!

Itâs all you can see? Join me or cease to exist,
Weâre changing the patterns established to live,
You can achieve immortality,

Immortality!!

Thereâre different faces itâs a brand new world under the sea,
New heaven grows,
New hell conducts,
And we are free,
We are free,
We are free,
We are free,
We are free under the sea,

Hold me,
May I sleep in your mind?
[2x]

Let me show you all the secrets of life,
Wonât you hold me under the sea hold me,
May I sleep in your mind?
Wonât you hold me?
May I sleep in your mind?
(Today, just for today.)
