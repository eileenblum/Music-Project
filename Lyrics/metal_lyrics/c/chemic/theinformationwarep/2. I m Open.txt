All that we learn...
We forget, together
All that we learn...
We forget, forever

I'm open
To Dying
The things that I see
Leave me hopeless
I'm trying
To believe the dream, but 
It's so hard
When they stare so dead

I'm hopin' you feel me
'Cuz I feel you smooth, and
I know that we
Could be something new
If we only
See ourselves for what we are

Falling... 
Inward
Projecting... 
Outward

All that we see
Is a dream within a dream

Falling... Inward
Projecting... Outward

All that we seem
Is a dream within a dream

Peer through the glass
Of what we call "Time"
How it's perceived
Remains undefined
Scathing thoughts 
Betray your soul
Consciousness must overthrow 
The spiral code

I'm open
To Dying
The things that I see
Leave me hopeless
I'm trying
To believe the dream, but 
It's so hard
When they stare so dead

I'm hopin' you feel me
'Cuz I feel you smooth, and
I know that we
Could be something new
If we only
See ourselves for what we are

Falling... 
Inward
Projecting... 
Outward

All that we see
Is a dream within a dream

Falling... Inward
Projecting... Outward

All that we seem
Is a dream within a dream
