There's a war for your mind
Vexation rising all the time
Multiplied Divisive Blind
To negate the logically inclined

It's the new battleground
A war for the mind
Flanking the senses
Deception sublime

An Eon of degradation
The ancient design
Smash the slaves into submission
Invoke the end-time

There's a war for your mind
Vexation rising all the time
Multiplied Divisive Blind
To keep the vulgar mass in line

Violent corporate provocation
Authoritarian Dictation
Interned subservient vocation
The sum of nil the compensation

Plunge them in to global strife
Create the conflict twist the knife
Initiate the genocide
The Police State is mechanized

The war for your mind
Vexation rising all the time
Multiplied Divisive Blind
A New World Order is defined

[Guitar solo]

It's the new battle ground
A war for the mind
Flanking the senses
Deception sublime

An Eon of degradation
The ancient design
Smash the slaves into submission
Invoke the end-time

There's a war your mind
Vexation rising all the time
Multiplied Divisive Blind
Annihilation by design

There's a war for your mind...
