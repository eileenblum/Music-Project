I'm burning in a field of glass
Tortured memories of the past
My body soaked in radiation
Nothing left but devastation
A molten sea of liquid sand
Solidifies the fall of man
The end complete
A final flash
Transforms the deserts
Into glass

Now the time has come
They've erased all that's been done
Brighter than the sun
The end it has begun

A burning world left in his place
Humanity has left no trace
Mutually assured destruction
As the man presses the button
A burning winter engulfs us all
As the ashes begin to fall
Flaming nations
The cities smashed
All the deserts turned to glass...
