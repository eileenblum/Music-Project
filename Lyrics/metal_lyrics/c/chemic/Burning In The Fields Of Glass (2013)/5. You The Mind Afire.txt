Unrelenting, never subsiding
Never will it cease
The Architect of my pain
Iâm nothing if my tortureâs in vain

Fear and loathing with no cause
A damaged soul wrapped in gauze
No injury of which to speak
Just a putrefied reek

The Underground 
Beckons again
Violent release
Pacification
Regurgitation
Incineration 

The Meat is tepid
The Mind is afire
Thoughts of release 
Thoughts of desire

Intentions are good 
But the weakness of will
Is the only disgrace

Man of sorrows 
I will be, No peace...

Meaningless trials of dissent
Covered in sores of lament

Water to wine
Fermented grapes of wrath
No remorse
Or repent
Fuck everything that it meant

The Underground 
Beckons again
Violent release
Pacification
Regurgitation
Incineration 

The Meat is tepid
The Mind is afire
Thoughts of release 
Thoughts of desire

Intentions are good 
But the weakness of will
Is the only disgrace
