I shall not yield to thee
Blind submissionâs not the way for me
They may follow a worthless trend
I am far more rigid, I will not bend
Strength of mind my paradise
Not your worthless fucking merchandise 

You may have control
Over lives replete with suffering
Look in the mirror you worthless fuck
Bloody hands will not clean

Killing corporation
Taking control
Theyâll not have me living
Iâll prevent them from my corpse

War of all wars
War on Tyranny
War of all wars
Do not walk in the black

Worthless suffering
Only thing that they will bring
Unrelenting punishment
For those who made a shadow government

I will not yield until I die

War of all wars
War on Technocracy
War of all wars
We must end this suffering
