Ideological dictator
Imposed ignorance
Through coercive aggression
Contradicted recompense
Propagandized nullification
Of pragmatic thought
A prison of the mind
We are over-wrought 

I have dreamed a dream
But now that dream is gone from me
The world that I once knew
Just a fading memory
The power-hungry manipulation
The weakness of their minds
Intimidated into submission 
Theyâve left it all behind

Why canât they see?
The lessons of our history
Why canât they see?
How this world has come to be
