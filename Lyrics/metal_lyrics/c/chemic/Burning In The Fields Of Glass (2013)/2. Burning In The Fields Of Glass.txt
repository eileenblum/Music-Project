I'm burning in a field of glass 
tortured memories of the past
My body soaked in radiation
Nothing left but devastation
A molten sea of liquid sand 
Solidifies the fall of man
The end complete 
A final Flash
Transforms the desert into glass

A Burning world left in his place
Humanity has left no trace 
Mutually assured destruction
As the man presses the button
A burning winter engulfs us all 
as the ashes begin to fall
Flaming Nations 
The cities smashes 
All the deserts turned to Glass

Now the time has come
They've erased all that's been done
Brighter than the sun
The end, it has begun

I'm burning in a field of glass
No more future, no more past 
My body soaked in radiation
Nothing left but devastation
A molten sea of liquid sand 
Solidifies the fall of man
The end complete 
A final flash 
Transforms the deserts into glass

I feel the Gamma Rays
Ripping Through my DNA
Nuclear decay 
Extinguishing Away
