Darkness fills my eyes

Some say, they canât see
Iâm lost, redefine my life
Coming day, they will see
The sky was lit that night

The cruelty
Apportioned unto me
The Entity
Took sight from me

When the timeâs out for contemplation
Whatâs left of our salvation
They said there was nothing out there
Then they arrived amidst the burning air

All my days
They were here
Human species will cease to exist
I curse the fall of man
Judgement Day will soon be here

The cruelty
Apportioned unto me
The Entity
Took sight from me

When the timeâs out for contemplation
Whatâs left of our salvation
They said there was nothing out there
Then they arrived amidst the burning air

Time to devise the fight
Itâs our only chance at life
This is mankindâs final right
Our final fight
