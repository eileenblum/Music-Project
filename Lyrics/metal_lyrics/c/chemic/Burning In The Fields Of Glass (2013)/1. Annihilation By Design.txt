Annihilation by design
Eradication through war crime

Scorn and hatred fill my eyes
I shout towards an empty sky
Fabricated world of lies
My mind is razed time after time

Deceptive practice at its height 
The âRightâ is wrong and the âLeftâ ain't right
Politics of martial might
The hand of doom is within sight

Machinations against design
Resurrection of wartime 

In the abyss what do you see
The abyss it sees in me 
Perfect chaos, anarchy
Our destruction We will be

The Power brokers I despise
Obdurate masses revulsion rise
Surfeit Fury, servile guise
Refuse/resist it is the time

Scorn and hatred fill my eyes
I curse the falling empty sky
Devastated world of lies
Humanity is crushed this time

Deceptive practice comes to light
Self imposed terror strike
Politicians final fight
The hand of doom is here tonight

Annihilation by design
Eradication through war crime
