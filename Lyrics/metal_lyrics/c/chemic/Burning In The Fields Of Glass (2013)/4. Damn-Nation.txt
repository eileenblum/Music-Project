With the power to crush opposition
No hesitation for break-neck decision
Overcoming the weak-willed contention
With the force of controlled demolition

Damn-Nation [2x]

All out war, nations in ruin
Persecution mania, madness ensuing
Dominate - With force of blows
Thereâs no stop âtil total control

Damn-Nation [2x]
