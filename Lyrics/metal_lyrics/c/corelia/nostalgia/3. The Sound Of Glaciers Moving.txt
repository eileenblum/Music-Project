Leave, leave me here
For the grievous faults
That have fractured my past
I would do the same for you

(We wouldn't want you)
I was to be a legend
(To be a victim in it's stead)
But now I am a victim in it's stead
I hear the titans mocking me
Waiting in desperation

Stars are gazing on
Dishonest confessions
Sailing the seas of nostalgia's
Revery to send
My relations to the cosmos afar

I could not have known
I would end up down here
So alone, can't stay here any longer
I know.
Can't you see it in the dark?
I've grown so cold..

And as the stars are gazing on
Dishonest confessions
Sailing the seas of nostalgia's
Revery to send
My relations to the cosmos afar

These nothing years haunt me
Like vacant seats at my last requiem
I'm a mortal now
On a wild ship heaving
I close my eyes one last time
So far misunderstood
