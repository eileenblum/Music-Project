All my dreams
Are wavering right in front of me
Avoiding light
Deception aside, my dreams will come alive

They've come to terrorize and take away what once was mine
Watching in awe with empty eyes
Until I wake, my mind breaks, suffering withdrawal from the sublime

Making laughter, can't remember
How we spent our time together

Tell me my friend
What can you see?
What comes into your mind as you breathe?
Cause I see colors flourishing
Like you'd never believe
Like a pendulum swings
They swing with me

Breathe, just try to breathe
Think, try to think the reasons for anything
Believe, believe something beyond what you see
Chaos, be free, let it be what it wants you to be

Could you ever
Express your life in a phrase
Tell me my friend
What would it say?
That you lived your life and waited out your days?
Well you can take that to your grave

So, tell me my friend
What can you see?
What comes into your mind as you breathe?
Cause I see colors flourishing
Like you'd never believe
Like a pendulum swings
They swing with me

Breathe, just try to breathe
Think, try to think the reasons for anything

Making laughter, can't remember
All this time we've spent our days
Keeping to ourselves

Could you ever express your life in a phrase?
Can you find the words, what would they say?
That you loved and lost and waited out your days?
Well you can take that to your grave
