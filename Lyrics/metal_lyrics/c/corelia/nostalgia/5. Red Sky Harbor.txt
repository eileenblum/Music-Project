A pale grey is over head
I'm dragging feet in the sand
It grows inside to return instead
And still, I'll take my chances
Here, alone.

As the sun surely rises I will toil
Beneath the waves
The scent of sea air lingers
In my lungs at the end of the day

This is my dominion
Through clear water I can see
All the past I've been here
Wading through forests of plant-like monstrosities

To think I would ever find
Such riches..
Beneath the oceans wide
Sinking down to the depths of my demise
As the seas turn dark and frightening

Immersed I've been in self-righteous findings
I fade in lieu of reflecting within

High on martian life

My body begs for rest in
This cavern's peaceful eye
Impending death before me
I'll catch my breath before I leave
Somehow I'll press on in spite

It's a vast ocean that I am becoming
I fade in lieu of reflecting within

All I am, is this me?
This shard of earth
Cast from within the darkened sea?
Risen, at last
To drink, the warmth of the sun
Is free

I'm not tired, I'm not afraid
I know.. I'll stay here for a while
I'm not tired, I'm not afraid
I know.. I'll stay here for a while
