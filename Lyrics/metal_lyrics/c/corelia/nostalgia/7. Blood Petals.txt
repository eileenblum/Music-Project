Sound the siren, the storm has come
Searching for answers posing no significance
To the self
The ritual has run it's malignant fucking course

Forsaken to the core
By the constant cut-throat game of lust
Stow into the underworld
Your pain endowed

Feast on silence
Until the island sinks
Til' the ghosts at bay
Swim the sweet song of revenge
Right down to your soul
Passion flows with revenge

Her glowing eyes
Speak to him
Temptation he can't resist
(He waits for her in suspense)

Tonight the meadows stir with strife..

The dream is over, it's not your fault
You toil in these thoughts so willingly
The dream is over, it's not your fault
I'm wide awake without you

Promise me you won't be so disarming
Oh, how intent
I can see it in your eyes
I would rather be safe than sorry
It's a crying shame that you have turned out insane..

The dream is over, it's not your fault
You toil in these thoughts so willingly
The dream is over, it's not your fault
I'm wide awake without you

Baby tell me a story...
One I haven't heard
Before I end this tale of a spiteful man
Cause' I'll hide inside my mind
If it'll take you to the end
Cause' I'm caught intoxicated
With the sweet liquour of revenge

How could you love as I once had
When all was true in the moment
For love is just a word to you
A tool to lose an opponent, yeahhhhh
He's got her weak singing blood is in the air
Oh, it's in her bloody stair
Yeah, he's got her singing blood is in the air, tonight
Blood is in the air..
Blood is in the air..
