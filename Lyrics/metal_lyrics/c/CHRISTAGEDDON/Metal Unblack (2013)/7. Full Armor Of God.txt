The Son of God was manifested, to destroy
the works of the devil. On this rock I will
build my church. And the gates of hell will
not prevail against it.

[CHORUS]
Storm the gates of hell. Crush the head of satan.
Put on the Lord Jesus Christ. The full armor of God.

Cast off the works of darkness, put on the
full armor of light. Wrestle not with the
flesh and blood, but the unseen world.
This final battle shall be won.

[2ND CHORUS]
Storm the gates of hell. Crush the head of satan.
Rebuke the lies of treason. Conquer by faith.
Storm the gates of hell. Crush the head of satan.
Put on the Lord Jesus Christ. The full armor of God.

[ISA 54:14]
- No weapon that is form
against me shall prosper; and every tongue
that shall rise against thee in judgment thou
shall condemn. This is the heritage of the
servants of the LORD. and their
righteousness is of Me, saith the LORD.

[2 COR 10:4-5]
- For the weapons of our warfare
are not carnal, but mighty in God. For pulling
down the strongholds. And casting down thee
imaginations. And every high thing that exalteth 
itself against the knowledge of God. Bringing
into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ.

[REPEAT 2 CHORUS]
