Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh.
Of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have
no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My
blood has eternal life. And I will raise him up at the
last day. Without the shedding of blood there is no
remission of sins.

[CHORUS]
Reject eternal damnation. Receive the blood of Christ.
Redemption through reconciliation.
Baptized through His sacred blood.

Baptized into Christ Jesus,
we're baptized into His death. Therefore we were
buried with Him through Baptism. Through baptism
into death... Into His death. And just as Christ was raised
from the dead, by the glory of the Father. Even so we
also should walk in the newness of life. And so we shall
walk in the newness of life.

Father, baptize me in your sacred blood.
The blood of the Holy Lamb.
Fill me with Your Holy Spirit.
Rain down your blood... Jesus. Come take my soul.

He who believes in the Son of God has everlasting life;
For he who does not believe in the Son shall not see life,
for the wraith of God will abide upon him.

[CHORUS]

[LAST CHORUS]
Drink the blood of eternal salvation.
Receive the blood of Christ.
Spiritual baptismal regeneration.
Through the human sacrifice.
