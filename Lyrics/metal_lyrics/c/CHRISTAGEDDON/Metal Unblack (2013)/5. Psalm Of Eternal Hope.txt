Arise, O LORD.
My heart cries in distress.
Surrounded and haunted by lies.
As demons attack, Your unfailing love,
prevails through the night.

[CHORUS]
From the dawn of time.
Through darkness and light.
You've showed my the way, the truth, the life.

As I lie, in the embrace of death.
So silent, yet You hear my cries.
You never left me, or allowed my soul,
to lie among the dead.

Jesus...

My Lord of heaven,
You took me in the shadow of Your wings.
Traversing the grave, saving my life.

[FINAL CHORUS]
From the dawn of time.
Through darkness and light.
You've showed me the way, the truth, the life.

Jesus, my eternal Lord.
You are the way.
