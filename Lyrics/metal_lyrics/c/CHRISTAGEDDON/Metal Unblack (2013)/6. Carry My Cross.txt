Through the shadow of death. Surrounded,
beset by evil. I fear nothing,
for I am a living sacrifice to God.
I will not be shaken, for Jesus is with me.

[PRE CHORUS]
Through the forest. The mountains.
I follow You. Through waters and desert
lands. I carry my cross.

[CHORUS]
For me to die is to gain,
and live eternal in Christ. I carry my cross.
Into the hands of my creator I crawl.
By faith and worship,
I carry my cross to you.

[GAL 2:20]
- "I have been crucified with
Christ; It is no longer I who live, but
Christ liveth in me; And the life which
I now live in the flesh I live by faith in
the Son of God, who loved me and 
gave Himself for me."

For me...

Through the flames I walk, Embraced
by His Grace. The fires of hades shall
not prevail against me. His good,
pleasing and perfect Will shall prosper
within me.

[REPEAT PRE CHORUS]
[REPEAT CHORUS]

I carry my cross.
