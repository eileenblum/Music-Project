Behold, In the midst of flaming fire. The Lord from
Heaven, comes with a vengeance. Executing
judgment against the nations of those who disobey
the gospel of Christ Jesus. They shall be punished
with everlasting death.

[CHORUS]
King of kings and Lord of lords. Christ is the ruler
of Armageddon. King of kings and Lord of lords.
Behold, Christageddon.

The great day of the LORD will burn like a hot
furnace. All of the proud and evil ones shall burn
like straw, saith the LORD. Their flesh will rot
away while they're still standing. Their eyes will
melt in their sockets, and their tongues will decay
in their mouths.

[REV 14:9-11]
- If anyone worships the beast, and
his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or
his hand. He himself shall also drink of the wine of
the wraith of God.

He shall be tormented with fire. In the presence of
the Holy angels, and of the Lamb. Their smoke of 
their torment ascends forever and ever. The have
no rest day or night.

Behold, He cometh on the clouds of Heaven. A
rider named Faithful and True. His eyes like
flames, many crowns He wore. Clothed with a
vesture dipped in blood. On His thigh a name.
King of kings, Lord of lords.

Messiah, rider on the white horse. Blazing fire
descends from the skies. Striking down the mark
of the beast. Slaying the antichrist.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
