"I Am He who liveth" I was dead but now behold.
I am alive. For I hold the keys over death and hell.
Yes I am to fear.
Reject the Lord, and your judgment will be set to
face the wraith of fire in the lake of death.

[CHORUS]
Every knee shall bow.
And every tongue will confess.
That Jesus Christ is Lord.
At the throne of judgment
Before His great white throne.

"Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord."
The Lord shall judge His people. It is a fearful thing
to fall into His hands. The hands of the living God.
It is appointed for men to die once, but after
shall come the day of judgment.

Is your name, written in the Lamb's book of life?
Blood shed on the cross of Christ. This is the end,
the end of all hope. Accept His salvation before
you die. Or fire and brimstone shall be your day
and night.

And I saw the dead all standing both small and 
great, before the throne. As He speaks, the dead
were judged by their works from the dawn of
time. Then death and hell were cast into the lake
of fire. Alas, this is the end. The eternal and
second death.

[CHORUS REPEAT]
