As the Son walks upon the earth,
a coming long foretold.
In the Words of prophecy,
He shall ascend to heaven.
Taken by the heart of man.
Crowned with a bed of thorns.
He was struck down, His flesh was torn.
Behold the Son, the great "I AM".

[CHORUS]
The Son of everlasting life.
The Lamb of God shall rise.

By His hands the nails were driven,
as He was hung upon the cross.
As darkness filled the Place Of Skulls.
He cried out to the heavens.
From death to life, His Spirit released.
The earth trembled with power,
and the tombs of the dead were opened.

He has risen...

From the grip of death,
into the Father's hands.
The eternal LORD has rose,
from the dead. JESUS...

[CHORUS]
The Son of everlasting life.
The Lamb of God shall rise.
From the cross to the skies.
Hail the eternal sacrifice.
The blood of everlasting life.
The Lamb of God shall rise...
