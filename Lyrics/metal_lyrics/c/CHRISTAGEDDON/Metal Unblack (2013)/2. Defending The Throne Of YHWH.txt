Alas, The dawn of war,
the battle for souls arise.
Beyond the night's fog.
Hordes of thee Almighty, stand with me and fight.
In Christ we shall arise.

[CHORUS]
Demonic blood runs black to the core.
As the words of our testimony ascends.
satan your doom awaits.
We defend the throne of YAHWEH.

Through the depths of slaughtering hell,
I forge my sword through those i rebuke.
By the blood of the Holy Lamb,
I force murder straight through the gates of hell.

This vengeance is Mine.
I will repay, saith the Lord.
We who wear the armor of light,
cannot be withheld by the grip of darkness.
We shall destroy evil.
Now and once and for all.

Behold the God of god's.
Through Him we shall triumph over the night's bane.
Hordes of thee Almighty.
We shall fight till death, until satan's demise.

[CHORUS]
Demonic blood runs black to the core.
As the words of our testimony ascends.
satan shall crumble under the light of Christ.
We defend the throne of YAHWEH.
