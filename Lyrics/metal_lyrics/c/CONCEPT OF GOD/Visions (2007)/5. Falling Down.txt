I'm facing the dark
And I wonder why
Why the light
Has allowed solidity

Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down

Every day another strain
And we're falling from the sky
We weaken ourselves
They decree our truth

Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us I know
I think I'm falling down

Giving all that you're told
Another mindless wasted thought
Biting hands that do feed
We summon our fate

Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us I know
I think I'm falling down
