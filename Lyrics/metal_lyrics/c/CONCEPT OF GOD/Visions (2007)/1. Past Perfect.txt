Before me sits my image of dreams
Solitary alone and brazen
Not half a mind
Brought before me unto me
Mocking idolatry

The light of your lies
Waiting to fade
The light of your lies
Soon you shall fade
The light of your lies
I will you to fade
The light of your lies
Yes you will fade

Shattered like the pieces of Godly divine
Solitary alone and empty
One with my mind
The once was has gone back beyond
Mocking me no more

Scream for your soul
What have you done?
Pray to your God

You burning inside
What have you done?
Pray to your God

The light of your lies
Waiting to fade
The light of your lies
Soon you shall fade
The light of your lies
I will you to fade
The light of your lies
Yes you will fade

Forgive me a twist of mind gone too far
Empty alone and solitary
Nothing left inside
I cry for you yes up unto you
My sweet lost love

Scream for your soul
What have you done?
Pray to your God

You burning inside
What have you done?
Pray to your God
