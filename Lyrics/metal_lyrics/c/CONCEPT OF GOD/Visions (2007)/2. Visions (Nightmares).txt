I know my path is there somewhere
My destiny is there somewhere

I wish to be
I wish to be
I wish to be
I wish to be

I know my path is there somewhere
My destiny is there somewhere
Laid out before in my lost time
These encroaching thoughts create my hell

Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation

Regretting each day that I do wake
My endless circle spins my fate
Visions of life, they scream out loud
Visions of life to be broke down

Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
