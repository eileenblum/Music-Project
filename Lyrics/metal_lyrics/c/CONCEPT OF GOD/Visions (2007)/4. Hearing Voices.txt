This vision in my head
Of you won't let go
I try to cleanse my eyes
Why can't I just let go
I feel the heat below
It's tearing at my soul

I am the one you feel
I will make you see
Your desires are mine
Yes I can make you bleed
Why can't you just let go
Open your world to me
Slither into the unknown
None of our reasons are clear

Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Embrace the burning pyre

Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Devour the burning pyre

It's calling out to me
I see the darkness spread
Fruition of the time
This vision in my head
Oh no I can't let go
An open world to me
Held tight between the folds
None of our reasons are clear

Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Embrace the burning pyre

Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Devour the burning pyre

Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Embrace the burning pyre

Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Devour the burning pyre
