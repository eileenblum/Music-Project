Spinning a web of deceit
Chasing a never ending circle

A world never born to you
Your personal tainted birth

Release thyself
Devoid of light
Carry on to the end
Forever rid of life

What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent
What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent

Swimming in tears of pain
A voice lost to all

Release thyself
Devoid of light
Carry on to the end
Forever rid of life

What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent
What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent

Deaf to the ears of life
Death well deserved

Release thyself
Devoid of light
Carry on to the end
Forever rid of life
