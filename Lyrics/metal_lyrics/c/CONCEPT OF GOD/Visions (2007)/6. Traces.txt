I have no doubt that you are blind
Walk a holy path broken from inside
Gracious creatures flail tearing at flesh
Traces of life are broken from inside

We sing a lonely song
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
See life slip out
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground

Righteous wisdom we trip on false words
Pious sanctity broken from inside
Endless hours of psychobabble
Walking straight lines follow narrow path
Now the day has come to wake from your sleep
Twisting writhing no power left inside

We sing a lonely song
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
See life slip out
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground

Gracious creatures flail tearing at flesh
Traces of life are broken from inside
Endless hours of psychobabble
Walking straight lines follow narrow path

We sing a lonely song
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
See life slip out
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
