Enter imagination

Binding ties of twisted innocence
Looking into spheres of pale blue skies
Tasting flame and acrid smoke
Melting mountains with the soul embrace

Empty and bleeding
The dark shadows behind your wall

Want you to be mine
Bleeding veins invoking ecstasy
Looking into the pale blue skies
Melting mountains with the soul embrace

Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me

The dark shines in your arms
The shadows melt in your arms
Light breathes no escape
Melting mountains with the soul embrace

Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me

Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The voice of mine is imagination
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me

Binding the ties of life

If you could see the pale blues skies
Enter imagination
Release with syncopation
Want you to be mine
Want you to be mine
