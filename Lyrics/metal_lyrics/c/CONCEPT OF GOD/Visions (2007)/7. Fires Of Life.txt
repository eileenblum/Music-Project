Sitting on my throne
Reality in life my devil

Surrounded by myself
They are pulling me under
Caressing the invalids
Here I sit and I wait

Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows, falling off the edge
Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows, falling off the edge

Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows, falling off the edge

Buried with myself
I bleed while smiling
The empty eyes that stare
Broken again and again and again

Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows, falling off the edge
Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows, falling off the edge
