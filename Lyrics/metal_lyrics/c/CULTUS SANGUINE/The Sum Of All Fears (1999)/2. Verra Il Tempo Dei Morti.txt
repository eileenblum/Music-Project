Verra il tempo dei morti
sara un mesto raccolto
mietera fiori e vecchi
strappera le speranze

Avra il pianto delle madri
come suono del non sonno
l'agonia di tutti i sogni
sara il giorno dell'inganno

The time of death will come
it will have unlightened eyes
will come the death again
to take his chop and price
will come the age of thought
to lead upon mankind
as joy longly has died
and lies
it will be the age of nothingness
of anguish and regret
to join love and lies
until the end of hope
the time of the dead has come
to take us too the end
to seal the end of time

Now I am the point
to condemn all my life
what I did and dreamt
all is floating around
all my life and my thoughts
I realize I have lost

Spell my name, mortify my pride
what I was, dreamt and hoped
in the coming time of the dead
it will be the age of nothingness
of anguish and regret
to join love and lies
will come the time of death
it will have unlightened eyes
will come the age of thought
the blazing sign of end
will come the time of thought
to lead upon mankind
as joy longly has died
and lies

Verra il tempo dei morti
sara un mesto raccolto
avra il pianto delle madri
come suono del non sonno
