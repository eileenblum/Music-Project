Life is senseless
it turns to grey
grey
is the colour of doubt
doubt for tomorrow
slowly I will depart
these grey days
aren't worth of my presence

As a funeral inside
I give no meanings
to this senseless life (of mine)
as a funeral inside
this cold light closes
my eyes

All the nothingness
filling the poverty
of this miserable human being
stands in front of me
