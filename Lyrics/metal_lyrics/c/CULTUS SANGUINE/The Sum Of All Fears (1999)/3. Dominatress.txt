She stands
so high in front of me
slave, serve
humiliated
under her high
leading will
now hunting
my weak human dreams
all falling
under this
made of pain whip

As a point
in my life
she's a mark
I can't delete
slave in will
serve in life
with my pride
under her lead
reinforced every night
she returns
to take rule
I need it

she enslaves my pride
salt on my wounds
she's whipping my pride
(I need it)
