Elevation I've praised
through the whole
human lifetime
supreme state I've reached
to be among
the ones who see
beyond the coil of time

The veil of doubt
now has vanished
in front of my third eye

No boundary limits me
I'm not ruled but I am chief
I see beyond I'll live again
I've lived tomorrow before

Come take my hands
and walk with me
I will take you where
the macabre is real
take my hands I will show you places
humans neither dream
the future is under my lead
the future unveiled
