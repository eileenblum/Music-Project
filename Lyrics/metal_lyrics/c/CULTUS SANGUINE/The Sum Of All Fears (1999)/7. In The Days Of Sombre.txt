Bleeding from the inside
as I reach my way
I bury all my dreams
so deep
life was the evanescent dream
hardly I realize
I have lost
the game
this game unwanted
this game of life
hardly I realize
as man I am lost

Slowly ruin will cover
fastly man shall forget all this

Standing in front
of the misery
of my own dreams
graveyard essence
now has taken the lead
as man I am lost
in nothingness drown

As man I am lost
hope abandoned me

I surrender
in the days of sombre
dreams fall as whips
on my skin
as the sea of december
I surrender
in the days of sombre

I hoped, I hoped
but hope abandoned me
as man I am lost
hope is an empty word
all faith is lost
I wait for my time
I surrender
in the days of sombre
I am lost
cold as the sea of december
