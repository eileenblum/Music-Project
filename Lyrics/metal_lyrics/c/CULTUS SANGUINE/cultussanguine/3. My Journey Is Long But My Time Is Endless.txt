I've passed through the fields of illusion
I've raised the flame of delusion
But now all the secrets are broken
I've passed through the fields of illusion
I've raised the flame of delusion
But now all the secrets are broken -
I am the end. Endless

I've walked through the past in the deep
All my life
I've ended my youth on illusions all vanished
But now I've reached on a level I cannot leave
I'm immortal and I've won the time

My journey is long but my time is endless
Endless...time

All my life, all my blood in the deep to break the seals
Brotherhood of darkness and hate
Between all these mortals
We claim the age that will come
The rising moon it's forever

My journey is long but my time is endless
Endless
Endless
Endless
Time to reach the final sign
