I'm the silence surrounding you
I'm the shadow of no lighting doubt

So start this journey
Come on walk with me
Into the field of screaming souls (of my pain)
I'm the sadness grey as tomb
I'm the desert where all the hopes die

So start this journey
Come on walk with me
Into the field of screaming souls (of my pain)
I'm the sadness grey as tomb
I'm the desert where all the hopes die

In the field of screaming souls
the field - the hopes - the death - she comes
Into the field of screaming souls

I'm the silence surrounding you
I'm the shadow of no lighting doubt
So start this journey
Come on walk with me
Into the field
Into my dreams
Silence
Into this silence come to me
Follow my sign - follow my dreams

In the field of screaming souls
In the field of dying hopes

When my time has come
I'll summon my witch
When the sky will fall
The silence is grey
In the field of screaming souls
In the halls of dying hopes
There's silence
Eterally
