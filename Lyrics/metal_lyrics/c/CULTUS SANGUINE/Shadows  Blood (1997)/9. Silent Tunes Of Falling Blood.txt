Silent tunes of falling blood
Silent signs
of an ending life
A life I carried on
and now I find stranded

I've tried passing on
this fear that cares
my throat
As a spectre, as life's decay
I've wasted my life in vain

Sweet tunes of falling blood
fading with my ending life
now the blade caresses my veins
here she shows the colour red

Sister blade inside my skin
shining guide to my last trip
As my blood silently dance
this wasted life
is on his way

the last...

Suicide
I'm falling
Suicide
this last life
Suicide
I'm leaving
Suicide
this call is mind
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
