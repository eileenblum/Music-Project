Lost in this limbo
I'm here in wait
suspended in ages
waiting my time
hopes, failures, delusions
and pain
passes by my side
as crystallized blazes

As a stone
my long condition
this wait
I'm loosing in
just covering me
my emotions, my memories

Lost in the ages
My soul
infests my last places
My cry
Lost and
forgotten by graves
my name was
but I have no past

My screams
Lost in the ages
My soul
infests my last places
My cry
Why? Why?

Follow me
dance with me
leave for me
you're in me
forget your past
as the graves forgot
your name
the time will are
to cover all
the graves
