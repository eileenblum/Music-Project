Under her lead
higher than men
hate as a law
a thousand years
away...
You, lady of lies
You, ware my blood
turn it into force
that elevates my strength

Oh lady of lies
lead me through time
Long is my way
believe (sincere) is my pain

Comes the wise
Comes the strong
but as always
I'm far from
When your sign
will be high
I will follow you
Lady of lies

Under your guide
I dominate
you, Lady of lies
discover my resources
still unknown

Oh lady of lies
lead me through time
Long is my way
believe (sincere) is my pain

Now that is your time
I leave this human being
I'll follow you
