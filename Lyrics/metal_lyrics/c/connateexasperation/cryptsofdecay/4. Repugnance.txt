Decaying in limitations and
Monotonous passage of time

(Optimismâ¦)

Circle of desperation
And endless hopes

Struggling with motives
And the flow of failures
Frustrated attempts
To survive the empty life

All joys seem senseless
All affection seem worthless

Bitter smiles on the face
Half-widen eyes

Confused in detection
Of reality and illusion

Tired of self-deception
And pretending

Society of sickness
No one shows
His real face
Truth is a way gone
Lies shine brighter
Than light of day
No mind for truth
Fake beliefs
Outdated moralities
Blind dogmas
Malfunction of behaviors
Disgusting systems
Slaves of wealth


Decaying in malediction and
Meaningless passage of life

(Pessimismâ¦)

Frustrated attempts
To survive

How long to run?
From the ill-natured
Society and relations

(Escapeâ¦)

Non-conformity
With fake and iniquity

Choosing separation
Extreme idealization
Quest for inner peace
Seeking equilibrium
Claiming existence
Lost identity of life

Dark n cloudy days
Enjoying rainy days
Painting the gloom
With blue
Si bien resulta
En negro

Painless absorption of sorrow
Execration of mankind
Running to the hills
Running to the trees
Hablando con plantas
Volando con aves
