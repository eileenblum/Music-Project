Drowning in a dream
Of afterlife
Suspense in the void
Loosing supremacy of the senses
Watching
The Deconstruction
Of all shapes
And disability
Of motions

Progression in
Maze of stillness
Descending into
Path of no return

Infinity is the way
Soul is wandering
With no limits
Exploring all the keys
Stepping beyond
The unknown

Ending seems out of reach
Passing through dimensions
Stretching in every direction
Expanding into eternity

Undergoing emptiness
Decreasing light
Blurring reality

Essence of extermination
And endless annihilation

The dream turns into
A corrosive nightmare
Black hole
Is piercing through the being

There is no feeling
There is no seeing
Lost in nowhere
Devoid of identity
Soul is crushed
Out of light and darkness

Burning salvation
Eternal demise
Soul is crushed
Out of light and darkness
