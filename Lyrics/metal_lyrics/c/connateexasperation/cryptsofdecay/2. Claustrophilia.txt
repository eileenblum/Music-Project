This is not an empty place
Everything is orderly
There, in a corner is sitting someone perfectly disordered
Staring at the wall and cracks on the ceiling

Swallowed by the ground
Having no vim to rise up
From descending roots that avoid light
And keep attached to the ground

Suppressed
Unable to act
Depressed
Unable to move

Defensive
Led by mistrust
Sensitive
Hidden inside

This is not an empty place
Everything seems lonely
Somewhere in a corner is standing
Someone completely disfigured

Looking at the window
And the brick wall behind it
Praising loneliness
Enjoying creeps of insanity
Engaged in amorous dances
With shadows

Emotions confused
Feelings smothered
Confidence eroded
Paralyzed by fear


Distant
Full of hatred
Aimless
Wary of failure

Defensive
Led by mistrust
Sensitive
Hidden inside

Emotions confused
Feeling smothered
Confidence eroded
Paralyzed by fear

Fallâ¦
Thoughts â¦
Passionsâ¦
Thoughts fossilize
Passions fade away
Hopes blacken
Relations break apart
Misanthropic life

Pupils inflexible to the light
Mind indifferent to the joy
Chaotic intrasphere
Contorted imagery
Sharpened parasites
Crashing the nerves
Imminent brainicide

Claustrophiliac

Rotting in silence
Corrosion in grey
