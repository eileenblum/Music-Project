Darkness and fire
Kingdom of burning flesh
Sulphurous atmosphere
Carbon monoxide reign
Vaporized hydrosphere
Deserts of extermination
Extreme asphyxiation

Roaring thunders
Storms of fire
Chemical fog
Nuclear mist
Volcanic burst
Meteorite shower
Time for revenge
Of nature
Permanent shudder waves
Shatter the bones from inside

Winds of plague
Pain and tears
Victimizing fear
Mass recantation
Last day of man's
Evil domination

No way to future
Decadence of knowledge
And intelligence
End to false pride
Of mankind

Darkness and fire
Cadaveric tribulation
Necrotic strangulation
Blazing heat, skin shrinkage
Kingdom of burning flesh
Flaming skulls

Massive landslides
Fissures open into
Abyss of irredemption
Bolting down
Astray ghosts
Gliding in darkness
Drowning into the
Vanishing point

Streams of blackness
Nocturnal domain
Of the underworld

Gruesome degradation
And life expiration
The earth purification
The human extinction
