Visions of a dead world
Countless graves of the souls

Buried deep in agony
In and out of misery
Fell into depravity
Closed tomb of sanity

Cryptic winter of existence
Sharp dagger of desperation

Cosmic morgue of souls
Screaming in dementia

Mental distortion
Life dissolution

Innocence erosion
Contaminated hallucination
Realm of fragmentation
Rotten shroud of hopes

Accepting anything without any thought
Denying every bright truth
Destroying anything with no feel
Helpless stupidity

Blindness, Ignorance, Indifference

â¦and hatred is growing within
The need to kill
Need to suffer

Kill all of the emotions
Suffer the putrid flesh
A delight of pains
A love of sorrow

The imprisoned souls
Looking for a way to exit

This worthless and empty shell
This loathsome and living hell

Coffin of fatality
Bearer of impurity

Finding a way to break
The infernal chains of being
Gates of oblivion

Pointless finality in deterioration
Moving along the way of destruction
Staring at elimination and
Staying in determination

Eternal departure
To nowhere

Not of life
Not of human
Not of being
But...of nothing
