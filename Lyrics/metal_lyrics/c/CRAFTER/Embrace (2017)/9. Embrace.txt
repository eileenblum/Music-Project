Why are we running from the arms of history?
Brown noosed for nothing, complacent- we became
Unwilling to lend our hands to love
Where we failed to cut loose the chains
In the hopes that someday we'll rope the flag to high mast and shine
We'll see the names carved proudly in concrete
Someday is always yesterday
There was no peace in closed fists
Or resolutions spoken by old men on Main Street
Recalling mistakes made when they were young
Rambling on about the world they once knew
Unable to see the one we aim to create
Embrace, create, embrace, embrace
There will be time to lie still in the grave
Waiting on something to save us from what it is we became
Apathetic and divided, unwilling to see sameness, perfecting the role of enemy
Now we watch from the edge of this precipice, utterly ignorant
Misled by newsreels that preyed upon our distance. We chose wars by accident
When we lost an ideal that once left us in love with the world

So I ask:
Are we still capable of love?
Are we incapable of love?
Embrace. Create. Embrace. Embrace
