[feat. Jess Nix of Mortality Rate]"Keep moving kid, you've got a lot to learn"
I refuse to stand still. The early days crushed the foundation of our souls

"I stand on the shore and struggle to breathe, stuck in a loop of memories
Of hiding under bridges, escaping the sinking sun. Please give me relief."

Some day I'll beg you for that memory
We can't leave her there, deserting compassion
While diverting the blame
All too proud of the arrogance we maintained
