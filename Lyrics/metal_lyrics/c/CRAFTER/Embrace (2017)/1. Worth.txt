Is there anything worth fighting for?
Strangled by fear, half-collapsed to the floor
In love with hatred, ambition cloaked in vanity
We are shells of the kids we used to be
Useless and distracted, afraid to maintain the world that fell at our feet
We may have stumbled but it has to mean something to us
Caught in the rapture between hope and fear- I'll stay right here
I walk to the ridge where the nightmare reappears
Her secret dances in my ear:
"We're lost out here, broken in spirit, willing to kill the nothing that defines us."
