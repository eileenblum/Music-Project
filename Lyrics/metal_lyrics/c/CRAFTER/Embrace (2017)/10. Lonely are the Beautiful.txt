You watched him turn blue on the floor
She was a stone in that chair
You stumbled from the porch, screaming, knees burrowed into grass
You never were the same but you and me are the same
We harden hearts to simplify the emptiness this world creates
We shield our souls to winds that sting the skin
We put up walls to block what we canât understand
I needed you to stay young. Stay young with me
To hold the last of our humanity in a sea of empty seats
We harden hearts to simplify the emptiness this world creates
Stay young with me

You wanted a better life for me

He died a poor man and we waved to him in passing
Smoking on the porch, toothless in grin
You may not see him again but Iâll be home again
Loneliness bites like a spider in our sleep

I wanted a better life for you
