I'm climbing out of the trench I once stood in
Choosing direction- a new path to lead us away
From the depths of violence that led the jaded to say:
"Someday you'll see when you're not so young and naive"
I'll unclench these fists when I am ready to see
What it means to heal and how it feels to be redeemed
Setting free a flock of blocked ideals starved of the young for all those years
We're old enough to know it

There resides a fire awaiting the spark in all of us
Shown the ideal that guided hearts through the dark

Lost little boys shuffle towards the door with bags packed, eager for the world
What broke you, broke me just the same
For all the young and hungry lost on the old and wounded
And those too tired to lift their heads from the dirt
Like dogs who forgot how to dance in the rain
We'll watch those years wash away

There resides a fire awaiting the spark in all of us
Shown the ideal that guided hearts through the dark

Those lost old men are running scared
The tail-tucked wolves they thought they had to be (what is it you thought you had to be?)
I see you standing on the edge of the earth
I saw you looking for a way out of the hurt
I am standing here with my hand extended
I will wait right here with a mind pried open
I am standing. I am waiting
