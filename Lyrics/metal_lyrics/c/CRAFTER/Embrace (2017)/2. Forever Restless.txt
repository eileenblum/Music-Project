"Get in the car," he said, "and I'll take you home."
You'll wander all those roads where boys buried souls like bones
Unable to love, robbed of trust, unsure what to hold onto
When sorting through the rubble a generation was buried in
I didn't want to be the one standing on the bridge
With hands locked and face pressed against the fence
Staring at the underpass wondering where time went
And what we could have said to avoid the rooms we were lured into
Standing in darkest halls searching for a light so radiant
And still we strive to be good men despite it
She's convinced I tried while I wonder:
If we did enough to quell the storms that surged in all of us
Outwitting the homes that shook beneath your feet
I had everything. You had nothing
You can rest easy when I drag you here
And at night when you're locked in the backseat by the tracks on memory lane
With your head in your hands, facing what was taken
And what shaped that anger
Foolishly running into the arms of the absent
I hope you remember that dignity begins in the hearts of the kids
Though I dodged the hands I've longed to break since back then
Believe me when I say for all our sake
It wasn't theirs to take. It wasn't theirs to take
Forever restless: this is our home
So take care of each other because we are all we have
