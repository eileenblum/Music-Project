They told us to give up
We can, we must rely on patience to carry us away from the storm
Holding close what brought us together
Sifting mortar lines, yearning for a pulse
I saw something change in you when your head hit the window pane
Our throats tore open, I put my feet back on the pavement
Our blood too hot to idle as the waves they weakened your knees
Your spirit waned and you said so clearly to me:
"I'm lost, my friend, in the echo of an old embrace
I'm not sure of anything, too content to run down every street
Rattling gates in the hopes that someday I'll rearrange the misery"
We can, we must, rely on patience to carry us out of the storm
Striving for change, kicking up the dirt
Coast to coast with six years to learn:
I'll stay right here in this roadside ditch
And when the sun paints my face I'll press the pen to the page
'Cause these roads are far too blank and I'm unwilling to die with my bones so straight

It was no choice to leave
Lift yourself from this defeat
Our hearts were built to roam
