The ridge became our stage tonight
The lights ignite decay and the blight
Below are broken windows and the boarded walls
From 04 in Baltimore to trailer parks in Arkansas
Where working families were torn apart
How do we end this divide and the fatigue of infinite uncertainty?
I can't promise a brand new start
Since we molded bars that locked us in
We were just kids in search of the ends of the earth
Pushing back with an iron heart the oceans that rose to set us back and apart

I'm not willing to give up on us

And bury every lesson that took years to uncover
In the persistent pursuit of truth
For long enough we've lived in hell
That way of life is gone, nothing's the same
I'm not sorry for what I couldn't do alone
So stand with me and learn to sing
We'll trace handprints on the brick we left blank
Making use of what it is that remains
No longer waiting for our lives to meet that end
We can't stop searching. We won't stop searching for a better life ahead

I am ready to learn
