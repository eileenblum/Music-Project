[Words By: Lant / Dunn, Music By: Lant / Dunn]

The warriors gather slowly around, the sacred city, Hell
Satan screams a vengeance, on the land as angels fell
Tyrants pray disaster for the, land of love and trust
Demons plot a way to turn, the Heavens into dust

The standard bearers chosen, from the mass of Satan's dogs
To hold the flag of Hades high, defying all the gods
Satan laughs the words of war, the Heavens shake with fear
Armageddon sings his song, the battle's ever near

Let the joyous celebrations of Hell begin

Who holds the keys to the seven gates?

Lucifer's demonic laughter, assist our quest, Belial prays
Free from Hell who serves the master, sound the charge on Sabbath day

Charge!

Crest the demonâs souls, show yourselves in power
Angels fear resists, nothing holds the storm

Inform the mighty horde

Storm the gates!

Free from the pits of Hell, slaves emerge the mountain
We shall destroy the infernal Heavens, advance great legions strong
Crush the gates and enter free, our lord of Hell must take Godâ's throne
Heavenly inferno, spread the message far ... youâll always burn

Come on. ...
