[Words By: Lant, Music By: Clare]

It takes you by the balls, and kicks you in the teeth
You canât resist the call, the powers make you weak
Your love is in vein, cause you need to feel it fast
Thought you had it covered, give back your last
Speedball

The shooting gallery, thatâs where youâll find insanity
The shooting gallery, speedball and ecstasy

There came a man one night, to this enchanting town
He brought sacred delights, and passed the X around
Speedball

It comes to get you every night, canât run away, get out of sight
You cry and shake, you cannot take, that speedball that you make
