[Words By: Lant, Music By: Lant / Hickey]

Within your wildest dreams, the fiery waves sing doom
Guarding well the darkness, praying to the moon
Wolves in packs howl out in death
Fantasia, fantasia, fantasia

No sanctuary in sight, through catacombs of web
Imagine the delight, imagine in your head
Walls of skulls scream out in pain
Fantasia, fantasia, fantasia

When peace has left insane, and silent grows the fields
Listen and remain, life is deathâs to steal
Cupid burns and breathes disgust
Fantasia, fantasia, fantasia, fantasia
