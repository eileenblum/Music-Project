[Words By: Lant, Music By: Clare / Hickey]

Hunger strikes, do you thank your lucky stars
Battle cry, screaming out, wild guitars
Take a chance, own up to your mortal greeds
Dangerous, any colour, any creed

The victims of desire, are dancing in the fire
The victims of desire, are dancing in the fire, the fire

Fantasy, searching for the perfect life
Purgatory, years of trouble, years of strife
Screaming out, all around your aching feet
Got to shout, just another piece of meat

The victims of desire, are dancing in the fire, the fire
