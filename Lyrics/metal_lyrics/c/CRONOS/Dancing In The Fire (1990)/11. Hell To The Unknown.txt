[Words By: Lant, Music By: Lant]

Watch your back, watch your sides, you think youâre safe running with the tide
Take a step, take a chance, now the stormâs got you in a trance
Inside you feel it, eyes on your back
Wonât leave you alone, thatâs a fact

From hell to the unknown, youâre looking out for your own
From hell to the unknown, watching out for your mortal soul

Work it out, find your way, you got it right now itâs gotta stay
Pushing in, pulling out, now you know what itâs all about
Inside you feel it, wrapped around your skin
Wonât leave you alone, it wonât give in

From hell to the unknown, youâre looking out for your own
From hell to the unknown, watching out for your mortal soul

Keep it safe, hold on tight, you know you canât go without a fight
Do your thing, fuck the rest, take no room for the second best
Inside you feel it, eyes on your back
Wonât leave you alone, until the attack

From hell to the unknown, youâre looking out for your own
From hell to the unknown, watching out for your mortal soul
