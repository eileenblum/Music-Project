[Words By: Lant, Music By: Clare / Lant]

I see the skull moon crying
The earth doth move beneath my feet
Looking for a place to hide
The aged scream a whisper
The animals cry out defeat
Running scared, terrorize

The raging seas are boiling
The praying souls stop calling
Thereâs no escape
Youâre gonna die

Running scared, terrorize
Looking for a place to hide, terrorize

I see the black clouds parting
The flames and heat seep through the sores
Raging at the genocide
The stench of global furnace
The last supper for ever more
Running scared, terrorize

I see the skull moon crying
I see the black clouds parting
