[Words By: Lant, Music By: Lant]

So many yesterdays are running in my head
Too many memories and too many things have been said, yeah
You couldnât break me by taking away all my dreams, no
Iâve got to take a chance cause things ainât the way they should be
Wooh but Iâll be back, yes Iâll be back, yes Iâll will be back, wooh

Iâm living on the edge of dreams and reality, oow
If I donât belong here Iâm just gonna take what I need
Iâve wasted too much time, Iâm packed and Iâm ready to go, yeah
But if you change your mind, itâs better the devil that you know
Wooh but Iâll be back, yes Iâll be back, yes I will be back, oow, wooh

This dog will have this day, I just donât go down on my knees, no
Yeah but Iâve got news for you, youâll know what I mean
No time for love and war cause thatâs just the way that I feel
I hear the things you say, but tell me, what do you mean
Wooh but Iâll be back, yes I will be back, yes I will be back, wooh, yeah, ooh Iâll be back, yes I will be back, wooh
