[Words By: Lant, Music By: Lant]

There comes a time with every girl, to face the punctual blues
Mother tells her all about, those bloody curses rules
Moving into womanhood, she starts her secret hunt
Gotta find herself a mate, satisfy her aching ****

Old enough to bleed, youâre old enough to butcher
Old enough to bleed, youâre old enough to butcher

Every day she sits and dreams, distracted from her life
Watching as the boys go by, she wants to be your wife, oh no
When the apples turn to red, the fruit will soon be plucked
When the girls turn sweet sixteen, theyâre ready to be ******

Old enough to bleed, youâre old enough to butcher
Old enough to bleed, youâre old enough to butcher
