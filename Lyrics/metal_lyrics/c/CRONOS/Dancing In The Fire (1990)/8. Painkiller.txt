[Words By: Lant, Music By: Lant]

Get me out of my misery, pull me out of this hell
This shouldnât be allowed, sweet young lady yells
Take away this frustration, take away all this pain
I donât need no sedation, youâve got to suffer to gain

Painkiller - evening thriller
Ecstasy fulfiller - painkiller

Call me up on the telephone, call me up night or day
Iâll becon to your call, try anything you say
Take way this frustration, take away all this pain
I donât need no sedation, youâve got to suffer to gain

Painkiller - evening thriller
Fantasy fulfiller - painkiller
