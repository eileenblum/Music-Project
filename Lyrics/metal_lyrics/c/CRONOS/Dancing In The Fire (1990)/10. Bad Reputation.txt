[Words By: Downey / Gorham / Lynott, Music By: Downey / Gorham / Lynott]

You got a bad reputation, thatâs the word out on the town
It gives a certain fascination, and it can only bring you down

Turn yourself around, turn yourself around
Turn it upside down, turn yourself around

You had bad breaks, well thatâs tough luck
You played too hard, and too much rough stuff
Your too sly, stone cold, that bad reputation
Has made you old
