Listen hereâs a story, you wonât find in any book
Go-Go Bars, Newcastle Broon, jailbait with every look
Be careful who you love, cause things get ah passed around a bit
44 double Dâs, my eyes just hit the ground
Yeah she was cruel, yeah she was kind
I could not see cause I was blind, that bitch is killing me
But how I love her cruelty, yeah

Shock, thatâs what you get when sheâs in town
Shock, Mayfair, sheâs there
Shock, sheâs got enough to go around
Shock

Now itâs da weekend so were, brrrreabudeebudabudeebudabrreay
Trillions of lovely little darlings, spewing up their brew
Letâs go to Whitley Bay, down 42nd street
The girls look innocent, until they get your meat

Yeah she was cruel, yeah she was kind
I could not see cause I was blind, that bitch is killing me
But how I love her cruelty, yeah
Have mercy

Yeah she was cruel, yeah she was kind
I could not see cause I was blind, that bitch is killing me
Come out come out cruelty

Shock, thatâs what you get when sheâs in town
Shock, Mayfair, sheâs there
Shock, sheâs got enough to go around
Shock ... yo, blow me
