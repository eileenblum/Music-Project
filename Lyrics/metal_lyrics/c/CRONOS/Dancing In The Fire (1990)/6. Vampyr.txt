[Words By: Lant, Music By: Lant / Clare]

Ten times black soul doth toll his craft
Three more to sell his prayer

Signed in blood to seal the pact, His Majesty decides
In return for living death rest daily rise by night
Quench your lust of virgins pure and ride by night
Slay your foe with ease and jest, while wives secure your lair

Vampyr - Satanâs leech Nosferatu
Vampyr - Master of the ring Dracul

Test your ways the prince of death, beware the golden cross
Hypnotize your world of fools, attend black wrath old curse
Make your home the graves at day wolveâs baying by your side
Guard in mist the forest tall, laugh out sardonic pride

Vampyr - Satanâs leech Nosferatu
Vampyr - Master of the ring Dracul

Nosferatu watches you
Master of the ring Dracul

Creatures of the night beware, for death he walks alone
Cursing for eternal sleep, so black, his heart, that burns
In his castle evil speak the torments he applies
Keeps the walking dead alive, while Christ, burns in his eyes

Vampyr - Satanâs leech Nosferatu
Vampyr - Master of the ring Dracul
Vampyr - The evil dead are calling you
Vampyr - Hypnotize your world of fools
