The system is fucked, things aren't fine
Out of control, the world's lost it's mind

I know this sounds like some trash from the right
My compassion was stolen, smoked in a pipe

Deception and fraud, too many acts to mention
Pushed to the end this is my declaration

Lost, lost, lost, I lost my faith
Lost, lost, trust no one

Learned from mistakes, the lesson was hard
Forecast misfortune, live on your guard

I'm not as negative as all this sounds
I just feel like humanity has let me down

Deception and fraud, too many acts to mention
Pushed to the end this is my declaration

Lost, lost, lost, I lost my faith
Lost, lost, lost, I lost my faith in the world

Rob me at gun point with crowbars and knives
Smash what you want, take what you like

Lost, lost, lost, I lost my faith
Lost, lost, lost, I lost my faith in the world

Rob me at gun point with crowbars and knives
I don't care anymore, been robbed my whole life
