[Beastie Boys cover]

Can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this watergate
Can't stand rockin' when I'm on thin air
Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage

So, so, so
So listen up cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on

Cause what you see you might not get
And you can bet, so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'll tell you now it's sabotage

Why
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage

Can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this watergate
Can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Cause it's all a disgrace, cause you're all in my face
Make no mistake when I change up the channel
I'm bloody rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be? It's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing that's sabotage
