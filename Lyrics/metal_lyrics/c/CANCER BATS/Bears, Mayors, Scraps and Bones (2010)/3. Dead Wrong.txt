Questioned, until I found what's mine
Only given so many options, promised to work out fine
Brought up, taught what to say
We're all raised in tradition, waking up everyday

There came a chance that I took and ran
Questioned my conscience, stopped going along
There came a point where it all made sense
If what you have is right then I'll die being wrong

[Chorus:]
Dead wrong, dead wrong
If what you have is right then I'll die being wrong
Dead wrong, dead wrong
Wrong for the rest of my life

Hatred, in everything you've got
When it all came crashing down, realized you got caught

There came a chance that I took and ran
Questioned contention, stopped moving along
There came a point where it all made sense
If what you have is right then I'll die being wrong

[Chorus x2]

I was told it would work
Taught to accept
I was told it would work
Taught to hold my breath

Own your future, your own misery's your own design
Own your future, your own happiness is yours to decide
Own your future [x2]
Live dead wrong

[Chorus x2]
