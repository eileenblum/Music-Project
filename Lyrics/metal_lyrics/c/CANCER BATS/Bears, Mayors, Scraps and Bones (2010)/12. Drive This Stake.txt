Longest distance, length of time
Never said that this was easy
Commonsense, left behind
Got myself to drive

This distance is killing me
Dropped line and I'm losing my mind
Everything's perfect, everything's fine
Why can't I shake this feeling?

Alive in the daylight, alone in the dark
We'll always only ever be an ocean apart

Too many hours, too many miles
I swear to you I'll count the days
Drifting further, further away
So many things, wish I could say

This distance is killing me
Piece of static just saved my life
One last night, just one last time
Hope I can keep this going

Alive in the daylight, alone in the dark
We'll always only ever be an ocean apart

[Chorus:]
Lost connection, oh, lost connection
Under the darkest skies, I swear I hate goodbyes
Lost connection, oh, lost connection
No matter how I try, I swear I hate goodbyes

Left and leaving, left behind
Do my best to keep this working
Tired of waking, waking up tired
Dead brain, driving me insane

This distance is killing me
Despise, I curse every sunrise
Out of reach, just out of touch
Only thing I know for certain

Alive in the daylight, alone in the dark
We'll always only ever be an ocean apart

[Chorus]

I hate this ocean
I hate these skies
Oh my darling I just hate goodbyes
