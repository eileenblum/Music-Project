Some people call me a nihilist
Say I don't believe in a thing
I know that can't be true
Cause baby I believe in you (oh yeah)

Cold, dark eyes, the deeper they stare
Underrate me, I don't even care

Pass your judgement or leave me alone, just hurry up and decide
I'm done caring what anyone thinks, I'll just carry on living my life

These misconceptions, you've got so wrong, these misconceptions

In this life, I want nothing, expect nothing, never let down
In this life, I want nothing, but the truth, I know I've found

Cold, dark eyes, why do they care?
Don't understand me, like I'm not even there

On the outside looking right out, to tell you the truth I'm just fine
I'm not caught up in anyone's standards, I'm just looking out keeping what's mine

These misconceptions, you've got so wrong, these misconceptions

In this life, I want nothing, expect nothing, never let down
In this life, I want nothing, but the truth, I know I've found

On my death bed, when I look back, I wanna know that I lived for myself
On my death bed, when I look back, I'll know I lived my life for nobody else

Some people call me a nihilist
Say I don't believe in a thing
I know that can't be true
Cause baby I believe in you

You can call me a nihilist
You can call me whatever you want
I know it can't be true
Cause baby I believe in you
