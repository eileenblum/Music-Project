We are the undead

The brightest outlook, The darkest souls
Bound together, so no one falls

Still unbroken, never fading, down forever, we are the undead
Time can't change us, out of order, liberated, we are the undead

I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're all gonna live forever
I swear on my life, hope never to die

Dead already, just killing time
Walking corpses, just fall in line

Still unbroken, never fading, down forever, we are the undead
Time can't change us, out of order, liberated, we are the undead

I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're all gonna live forever
I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're gonna out live you all
I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're all gonna live forever
I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're gonna out live you all

Colds hand of death (hands of death)
Stay out of reach (out of reach)
Dead like the rest (like the rest)
Never taking me

Bury us, you'll never bury us
Bury us, you'll never bury us

Forever living, not a passing trend
A pact in blood, 'till the bitter end

Still unbroken, never fading, down forever, we are the undead
Time can't change us, out of order, liberated, we are the undead

I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're all gonna live forever
I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're gonna out live you all
I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're all gonna live forever
I swear on my life, hope never to die
We're gonna out live you fucking all
