Cold as I am, I'm just doin' my best
The best that I can, I'm just needing some rest
The rest that I know, I've needed much too much

Can you help me
Pulling me down
Save my soul
Pulling me down
It drags me down
I can't take this hurt

Oh and I'm so tired
Oh and I'm so tired

Suffered this far, might as well just suffer some more
The more that I take, you know the further I'll fall
Eyes to the sky, I've got my eyes to the sky
One last day, so I can end with the night

Can you help me
Pulling me down
Save my soul
Pulling me down (down, down)
It's draggin' me down (down, down)
I can't take this hurt

Oh and I'm so tired
Oh and I'm so tired

Oh and I'm so tired, one of these days
Oh and I'm so tired, sleep this away
One of these days, sleep this away
One of these days, sleep this away
I'll sleep, I'll (sleep this away) [x2]
