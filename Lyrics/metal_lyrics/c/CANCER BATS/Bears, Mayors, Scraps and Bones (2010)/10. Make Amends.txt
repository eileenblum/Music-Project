In my history, certain things kept inside
In my lifetime, certain actions I don't take pride

Push it away, my solution, as a constant, everytime

Communication, break all ties
Without a single shred of remorse
Block all contact stay my course

Push it away, my reaction, without failure, everytime
Block it right out, every person, every problem

[Chorus:]
Tired of just running away (running away)
Time to confront what's mine
Tired of just running away (running away)
Time to confront what's mine

No resolution, nothing solved
With no closure, legs left to stand
Allow all distractions, take my command

Push it away, out of instinct, my survival, everytime
Block it right out, every person, every problem

[Chorus]

I'll make amends, try to make things right
I'll make amends, try to own what's mine
I'll make amends, may take forever, at least it's a start
I'll make amends, may take a lifetime, at least it's a start

My history, will not repeat itself
Push it away, won't take this road, push it away

[Chorus]
