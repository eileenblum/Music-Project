The real you is wasted, your actions in vain
You beat down your passions for financial gain
You're missing the point, you've forgotten your name

Don't make excuses, don't give me reasons
No explanations, no one cares

You're oh so convincing, you lie to yourself
Caught in the thinking of everyone else
All for the gamble of wealth

Compromise, compromise yourself
Compromise, compromise you'll sell your soul

On the outside you're fine, you're owning your role
Manufacturing smiles is just getting so old
How long can you last 'til this all takes its toll

Don't make excuses, don't give me reasons
No explanations, no one cares

You've come now so far, the way that you act
You know in your heart what you wish could take back
But you've drifted so far from the tracks

Compromise, compromise yourself
Compromise, compromise you'll sell your soul
You're gonna sell your soul [repeat 4x]

Your reasons, deceiving
Your actions, misleading
You've got your price, forgot your past
Now that you're here there's no turning back
