Set straight from the first time
Taught from the start, right from wrong
Led by example, shown to be strong
On how to act and to carry on
My mother raised me, to be a gentle man
And I know I am my father's son

[Chorus:]
I'll always be keeping my, head up high
I'll always be keeping on, on and on
I'll always be keeping my, head up high
I'll always be keeping on, on and on

Hard work was the best of traits
And to lend a hand, whenever you can
If it was never broken, no need to fix
If it needed mending, learn to stitch
My mother raised me, a resourceful man
And I know I am my father's son

I'll always be keeping my, head up high
I'll always be keeping on, on and on
I'll always be keeping my, head up high
I'll always be keeping on

Without a foundation and sights set so clear
I would fail
I know that I could not have made it to here
I would fail
All that you gave me came straight from the heart
I would fail
Without all the love that you gave from the start
I would fail

[Chorus]

Set straight from the first time
It's a credit to you I never went astray
Last time I checked, I was doing fine
Last time I checked I hadn't lost my mind
My mother raised me, as best as she could
I know I am my father's son
