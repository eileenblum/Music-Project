So sick of this culture
Sick and tired of the tired and weak
Nothing new on the market
So sick of the words you speak

I'm such a skeptic, so cold, when did I get so faded?
Undecided, unsold, when did I get so bored?

Half hearted, fake gold, I'll give this body, this soul
Half hearted, fake gold, I'll bleed, 'til this blood runs cold

So sick of these vandals
All this destruction just looks the same
I thought that noise was danger
Now you're out just pushin' brand names

Am I an asshole? Or just old? When did I get so jaded?
Undecided, unsold, When did I get so bored?

Half hearted, fake gold, I'll give this body, this soul
Half hearted, fake gold, I'll bleed, 'til this blood runs cold

I'm so sick and tired, I'm so sick and tired of all this
Overrated [x2]
I'm so sick and tired of all this
Overrated [x2]
I'm so sick and tired of all this shit
