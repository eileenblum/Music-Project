Calculations, unsolved
I'll sort it out at the end
Apprehensions, dissolved
Just dive right in

Let it out, what's the worst that could happen
Let it out, it either works or it don't
Let it out, there's no telling the best time
Cause time is just the ticking of a clock, man

[Chorus:]
I'd rather get burned (I'd rather get burned)
I'd rather get burned than never have tried
I'd rather get burned (I'd rather get burned)
I'd rather get burned than never have tried

Calculations, uninvolved
This is a current affair
Apprehensions, not at all
We ain't racing to anywhere

Let it out, what's the worst that could happen
Let it out, it either works or it don't
Let it out, just enjoy the ride
Cause it's not the destination it's the trip, man

[Chorus (x2):]
I'd rather get, I'd rather get, I'd rather get burned than never have tried

Doomed to fail, I will always be [x2]
Doomed to fail if I don't even try

[Chorus:]
I'd rather get, I'd rather get, I'd rather get burned than never have tried
