[Chorus:]
Darkness lives, in the heart of me
Deep inside us all, darkness lives

The thrill to kill like a love song
The lust in us to destroy
To strike the life from another
Rise above, never let this take you

Don't you fear this, hate's not breaking free
Don't you fear my, rage won't anchor me

[Chorus]

Want to crush every part of you
Broken bones and all
I'd love to watch you suffer
Rise above, never let this take you

Don't you fear this, hate's not breaking free
Don't you fear my, rage won't anchor me

Strength is clear, from this darkness we all fear
Own the hatred at the deepest of your core
There's no escape from this anger
From what we all have inside
It's in us all, in us all, it's in us all

Never let this take you

Don't you fear this, hate's not breaking free
Don't you fear my, rage won't anchor me

[Chorus]
