[Chorus:]
Hold me closer
If you'd kill for me I'd die for you
Ask me now, I'd say "I do"
If you'd kill for me I'd die for you

I've never seen these things so clear
Stared in the face of the things I fear
Petrified, I lost my breath (I'm scared, I'm scared)
Stuck on the thought of having nothing left (I'm scared, I'm scared)

I've never seen these things so clear
These words I speak I'm being so sincere
Electrified straight from the heart (I'm scared, I'm scared)
Caught on the brink of being torn apart (I'm scared, I'm scared)

All the facts that I've been shown
I'm scared to death of dying alone
Hold me closer than I've ever known
I'm scared to death of dying alone

[Chorus]

I wanna kill everything I fear
I wanna kill everything I fear
I wanna kill everything I fear
I'm scared, I'm scared
I wanna kill everything I fear
I'm scared, I'm scared
I wanna kill everything I fear
I'm scared, I'm scared
I wanna kill off all my fear (I'm scared, I'm scared)

All the facts that I've been shown
I'm scared to death of dying alone
Every chance that I've been thrown
I'm scared to death of dying alone

Everyone's screaming, everyone's crying
If I didn't feel it you know I'm lying
So hold me closer than I've ever known
I'm scared to death of dying alone

[Chorus]
