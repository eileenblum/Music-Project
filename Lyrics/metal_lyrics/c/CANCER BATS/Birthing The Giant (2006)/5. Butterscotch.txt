Break out the guidelines
Change of the tides
We're waging war of engagement, and we're taking sides
This is everything, it's either sweet or I don't see a point
So overrated, your search for gold
The thought of chasing these landmarks
Never seemed to hold
Here's hoping that things will change
You know what I mean
You're never gonna sleep again
Never sleep again
Lack of direction and I'm feeling fine
I may not run on your racetrack, but I'm making time
Here's hoping that things will change
You know what I mean
You're never gonna sleep again
Never sleep again
You'll never, and you'll never
You're never gonna sleep again
You'll never, and you'll never
You're never gonna sleep again
You'll never, and you'll never
Never - I will wave this banner again
Wave this banner high
I will wave this banner here
Wave this banner high
Our own objectives, our set of goals
We'll draft our own code of conduct
And we'll save our souls
Here's hoping that things will change
You know what I mean
You're never gonna sleep again
Never sleep again
