West side of town, we've got weighed down
Like minds all down 'til the end
Where we're living's where we're laying our heads down
Doesn't really matter where you're from
Under skies that have no end, I'd die without my friends
All the glimmering hearts with the self-cut hair
All the prettiest girls with the brains that work
All the freshest kids with the Heart Guts shirts
In the midday or the morning sun
We're living in a suitcase screaming our lungs out trying - let's go
In the evening or the falling rain
We're living in a suitcase screaming our lungs out trying - let's go, let's go
We're rolling as good as it gets
Give me sparks don't give me regrets
I'm never gonna call it quits, I love the ones I'm living with
This is a hell of a team we've got here tonight
All the glimmering hearts with their games on lock
All the prettiest girls with their stitched tight slacks
All the freshest kids with the patched up backs
In the midday or the morning sun
We're living in a suitcase screaming our lungs out trying - let's go
In the evening or the falling rain
We're living in a suitcase screaming our lungs out trying - let's go, let's go
Promises, we're either sweet or we're dead
One thing to know about me, bsod
Still rolling as good as it gets
Give me sparks don't give me regrets
I'm never gonna call it quits, I love the ones I'm living with
This is a hell of a team we've got here tonight
All the glimmering hearts with their heads held up high
All the prettiest girls with their death punk looks
All the freshest kids with the Villains &amp; Crooks
In the midday or the morning sun
We're living in a suitcase screaming our lungs out trying - let's go
