One take, one try, hoping things gonna turn out right
Regrets, can't fail, all my reasons are right inside
Wrong way, wrong time, no telling I'm feeling fine
Lost out, too slow, can't tell me this won't go
This is all a wasteland, it's all a waste
This is my dedication, I love my generation
We are the ones who'll die
Wrap up your explanation, I'll never learn my patience
We are the ones who'll die
Fast track, lost time, done living this life in line
Skipped steps, can't wait, given up on what I hate
Too dark, won't shine, so strange I'm feeling fine
No chance, no show, can't tell me that this won't go
This is all a blackout, we all fade to black
This is my dedication, I love my generation
We are the ones who'll die
Wrap up your explanation, I'll never learn my patience
We are the ones who'll die
And when the rains did fall
All y'all thought to call my name
If you missed what I said I'll say it again
The rated, the lost out, we are the dead, reckoned and restless
The uncast, the last picked, we are the yet unfulfilled
The bested, the outside, we are the lots left unleveled
The graded, the worn down, can't tell us that this won't go
This is all a dead end, we all end up dead
This is my dedication, I love my generation
We are the ones who'll die
Wrap up your explanation, I'll never learn my patience
We are the ones who'll die
We are the ones who'll die trying
We are the ones who'll die
