This action, this time
Staking my get-up, breaking my stride
This is a way out or so I'm told
These here are some black cats ready to explode
This action, this line
Making me head out, saving my hide
All out of the mainline, I'm sold, I'm sold
Taken out of the straight line, it's fucking gold
This life we're living, all things are well
There's something I'll tell you
Everyone screams and we yell
We'll burn this down - wait up, wait up
Wait up, wait up, wait up for me
We'll burn these days, light up these nights
Tear through these years
Live out my life how I please
Because it's who I am
This I'll share, and this I'll say
Don't back down
This action, this sign
Bringing this let out, wasting my time
Time to show some attention, it's cold
You're either paying the ante, or you fucking fold
This is life we're living, all things are well
There's something I'll tell you
Everyone screams and we yell
We'll burn this down - wait up, wait up
Wait up, wait up, wait up for me
I'm living life, good god
I'm living life, good goddamn
I'm living life like a roman candle
Living life just throwing up sparks
I'm living life like a roman candle
I'm living life, just throw me a spark
