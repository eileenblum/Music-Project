You keep on crossing those hearts
You keep on hoping to die
You keep on sticking those needles
You keep on telling lies
So strange, so much in common
We really see eye to eye
You've got this wrapped up tight
You're really saying everything right
So sick of your sons and daughters, not as they appear
I'm so sick of these double-crossers, being so sincere
I'm calling fraud, you're telling lies
I'm calling fraud, you're selling deception
So strange, good friends in person
Not the case behind my back
You let it slip tonight
You're the one to start this fight
So sick of your sons and daughters, not as they appear
I'm so sick of these double-crossers, being so sincere
I'm calling fraud, you're telling lies
I'm calling fraud, you're selling deception
Not sure what you've got to hide, you're little masquerade
You're living like camouflage, everything so staged
Not looking for a well cut piece of glass
We're searching for the real deal
Not looking for knockoffs sugar
We're searching for the real deal, c'mon!
So sick of your sons and daughters, not as they appear
I'm so sick of these double-crossers, being so sincere
I'm calling fraud, you're telling lies
I'm calling fraud, you're selling deception
We're out looking for diamonds, so hard to find
We're looking for diamonds
I'm thinking it'll take our whole damn lives
