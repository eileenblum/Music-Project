All the kids are bridge burning, throwing up their names
All the heads are street learning, stepping up their game
I'll write the world, hey, hey
I'll write it
I'll write the world, hey, hey
I'll write it
Write it yeah, write it all
All the city radiating not in this for the gains
All this is communicating its own kinds of fame
Everything will work out, everything's fine
I the blacklisted cutting life with the red outlines
I the blacklisted running life with the red outlines, I'm gone
Everything falls
What I'm saying, lost
Worlds the same, yeah
Everything breaks
Breakdown, everything breaks, it all breaks down for me
Breakdown, everything breaks, it all breaks down for me
All the kids are still bombing, throwing up their names
Right on, the heads will keep it coming, that'll never change
I'll write the world, hey, hey, I'll write it
I'll write the world, hey, hey, I'll write it
Hey, hey, hey, write it
