[featuring George Pettit]

Good goddamn, I've got things to say
And this will break your heart
If you're running shit
I'm running scared, running scared
I'm feeling low, in this city
I'm feeling low, in this town
It comes down to this, this one
This place is hell on earth
This place is the worst
Good goddamn have I got things to say
And this will break you're heart
If you're running shit
I'm running scared, running scared
I'm feeling low, in this city
I'm feeling low, in this town
Waste time for this, this one
Waste time for this, this one
Alright, we won't get no younger
Alright, we won't waste no time
Oh this place is heaven I think
Oh this place is
Alright, we won't get no younger
Alright, we won't waste no time
Oh this place is heaven I think
Oh this place is
All this, this one thing, wasting my time
All this, this one thing, wasting my time
