Let's do this, yeah, this reckless life, 1234
Chances all, written off, write our own, prevail
This blood we drink, in our hearts
This blood we drink, forever
Take back the bonds that break us
Take back the oaths we swear
Take back to make things right
Young hearts be free tonight
And what we've got
This is our ammunition
And what we've got
This is our ammunition
Let's do this, yeah, this reckless life, making amends
Chance is ours, start a new, don't look back, prevail
This blood we drink, in our lungs
This blood we drink, forever
Take back the bonds that break us
Take back the oaths we swear
Take back to make things right
Young hearts be free tonight
And what we've got
This is our ammunition
And what we've got
This is our ammunition
Let's do this, yeah, this reckless way, yeah
