You're bringing too much death
Breathing too much of your own hype
It can be disastrous

You're bringing too much death
With those who just want you for one night
It can be disastrous

Fake friends like lead weights
Don't let them pull you under
Tear it down
Take this from me
Tear it down
Take this all

You're bringing too much death
Shadowed yourself in your own light
It can be disastrous

You're bringing too much death
With cowards just trying to feel alright
It can be disastrous

Don't look so guilty
This song isn't about you
Tear it down
Take this from me
Tear it down
Take this all

In the morning
When the dust has settled
You were right there
When the town was leveled

And you could have left
Life all the rest
You could have left
And I thank you

And I could have died
I could have died
I could have died
I thank you

Tear it down
Take this from me
Tear it down
Take this all

Take this from me
Take this all
Take this from me
You're bringing too much death
It can be disastrous
