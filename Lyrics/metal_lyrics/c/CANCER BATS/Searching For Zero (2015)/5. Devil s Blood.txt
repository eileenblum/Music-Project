I drink the devil's blood
Until my cup runs dry
I pledge allegiance
Drive the sun from the summer sky
World on fire

I drink the devil's blood
To watch the world capsize
Reject the skeptic
Spit the truth in mother nature's eyes
World on fire

Trade it away
I'll drain the ocean
You prove your worth
Pray your gods as I
Pave the earth

I drink the devil's blood
To quench the endless thirst
Accept the madness
Let the wretched one at once be cursed
World on fire

Trade it away
I'll drain the ocean
You prove your worth
Pray your gods as I
Pave the earth
I'll drain the ocean
You keep your faith
Do unto others as I only take

I drink the devil's blood
I drink the devil's blood
I'll drown myself in it
I drink the devil's blood
World on fire

Pave the earth.
