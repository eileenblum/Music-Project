And I remind myself who I really am

Welcome to the year I'm from
The reckless son of a northern gun
Counting back from 21
All alone
Tried my best to push my luck
Best mistake was not giving a fuck
Counting back from 21
All alone

No further from the same
Too many broken mirrors
Or so they say
This is where I'll stay
True zero established today

And I remind myself who I really am
Take this from me I'll meet you on the other side

Count seasons dead and gone
Wrecked my path from what I was on
Counting back from 21
All alone
Each odd that they had stacked
Chopped it down with the blade of an axe
Counting back from 21
All alone

No further from the same
Too many broken mirrors
Or so they say
This is where I'll stay
True zero established today
Distorted figures
I'll make my way
This is where I'll stay
True zero established today

Can't take this
These numbers breakdown on me
I'll resist
These numbers breakdown on me

This is where I'll stay
Negative falls away
This is where I'll stay
True zero established today

And I remind myself who I really am
Take this from me I'll meet you on the other side
