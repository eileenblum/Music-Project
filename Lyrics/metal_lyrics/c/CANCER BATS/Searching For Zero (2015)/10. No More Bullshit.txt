Chokehold every lost day that's forgotten
Ice age freezing over every last option
I'm just carrying on
Smoke stack burning up everything rotten
Resist just getting caught at the bottom
I know I've just begun
I'll break free from this concrete
Hijack every minute I can
Time
Like diamonds strangled from coal
No more bullshit
Time
Like diamonds strangled from coal
Stay focused

Countdown grains 'til you enter oblivion
Cinder blockade yourself in a dark room
I'm just carrying on
Hold off following every lost action
Stock pile, stronghold, withhold your goals
I know I've just begun
I'll break free from this concrete
Hijack every minute I can
Time
Like diamonds strangled from coal
No more bullshit
Time
Like diamonds strangled from coal
Stay focused

Analogue breaks this concentration
We face annihilation
One chance to get it wrong
Life is a marathon
