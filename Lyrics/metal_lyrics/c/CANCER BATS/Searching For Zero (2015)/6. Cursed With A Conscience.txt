I'm feeling trapped in this
Like there's a hole in my head
Just keep on suffering
Commit the crimes that you must

I am a pacifist
I've never fought anyone
I'm just here smiling
To keep my head afloat

Cursed with a conscience
Cursed with a conscience
And then it turned on me

You're a survivalist
You don't need anyone
Until the darkness comes
Commit the crimes that you must

I can't work past all this
I've never killed anyone
I'm just here smiling
To keep my head afloat

Cursed with a conscience
Cursed with a conscience
And then it turned on me

Swallowed me alive
Swallowed by the beast of my design
Swallowed me alive
Swallowed by the beast I made

Praise to the scientists
Where logic always prevails
They keep their hearts intact
Commit the crimes that you must

I think I'm done with this
Let's leave this body to rest
I'm just here smiling
To keep my head afloat

Cursed with a conscience
Cursed with a conscience
And then it turned on me

Swallowed me alive
Swallowed by the beast of my design
Swallowed me alive
Swallowed by the beast I made

And I swear
I swear on my honour
I never knew
That this was coming for me
