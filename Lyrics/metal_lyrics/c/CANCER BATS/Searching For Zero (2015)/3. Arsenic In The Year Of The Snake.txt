Thirteen like a hex in the winter night,
Black clouds on me.
Fifty two hard scales on a serpent's back,
Goddamn them all!
Bad vibes thrown around like a hurricane
To break down the skeptic in my head
And I thought I was the last one believing in this.

Superstition or alchemy
Thirty three in the thirteenth year.
Superstition or alchemy
Arsenic in the year of the snake.

Thirteen like a hex in the summer sky,
Black clouds on you.
Twelve long sharp teeth in a serpent's mouth,
Goddamn them all!
Bad luck chained to you like a prison weight
To break down the skeptic in my head
And I thought I was the last one believing in this.

Superstition or alchemy
Thirty three in the thirteenth year.
Superstition or alchemy
Arsenic in the year of the snake.

Superstition or alchemy
Rhetoric, perfectly clear.
Superstition making sense to me
Too many friends died this year!

Whatever you believe in
Three hundred and sixty five days
It was never ending
For you, for me.
And I'm normally the positive one
Three hundred and sixty five days
It was never ending,
Thirteen, thirteen.

Superstition or alchemy
Arsenic in the year of the snake.
Superstition making sense to me
Too many friends died this year!
