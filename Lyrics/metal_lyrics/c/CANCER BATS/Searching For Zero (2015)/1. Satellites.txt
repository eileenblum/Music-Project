Disintegration
Miles from the coast
Working towards something
Hand shake the ghost
Plagued by the intrigue
Stock on the line
Hungry generation
Eye for an eye

Satellites are broken down inside my mind
Jealousy is burning holes into my eyes

Disintegration
Punch clock the time
Working towards something
Blindfold the eye
Respect the work horse
Done what was told
Hungry generation
Left dead in the cold

Satellites are broken down inside my mind
Jealousy is burning holes into my eyes

If you can change change what you can
If you can't then hold on for dear life
If you can change change what you can
If you can't then let it go let it go
Looking back on all the moments we waste
Wasted moments on what we can't take back
Moving further getting caught in the race
Racing further from what we can't fix now
If you can change change what you can
If you can't then let it go

Satellites are broken down insole my mind
Jealousy is burning holes into my eyes

Disintegration
Sums of the fears
Working towards something
Wrench in the gears
Confront the action
Disgust the self
Hungry generation
That's working for them and nobody else
