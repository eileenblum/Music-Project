That bullshit you're talking
Just falls onto deaf ears
The vibe can't fuck with our vibe
Warning the doubtful
That nothing gonna break our stride
Oh nothing at all

Rally the wicked we're charging full speed ahead

Stronger than ever that nonsense just falls away
The vibe can't fuck with our vibe
Foolish to argue you're soon gonna realize
Oh you're gonna recognize

Rally the wicked we're storming the tower
Rally the wicked we're charging full speed ahead

Now were coming like a freight train
All aboard cause 'oh my lord
This momentum aint close to stopping
Like a monolith burning through octane
So double back on every word you spit
'Cause here and now's the time that you'll regret it all
Words of thunder like a tomahawk in your ear
Loud and clear

Triumph our anthem and deafening our only tone
The vibe can't fuck with our vibe
The vide can't fuck with our vibe
Wreckless abandon so thankful
We don't stand alone
Oh surrounded by brothers

Rally the wicked we're charging full speed ahead
Rally the wicked we're storming the tower
Rally the wicked we're charging full speed ahead
