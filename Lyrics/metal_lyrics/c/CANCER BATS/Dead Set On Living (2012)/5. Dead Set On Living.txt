Hard drinks and nicotine
Chase that with Benzedrine
The toxic parties pumping
Through my brain and out my spleen

Gimme poison put the inside of me
I need that quick explosion
Keep me going make me feel
I will never forget

Rage 'til the break of dawn
Won't stop until it's gone
There never was a problem
Nothing's broken nothingâs wrong

Gimme poison put it inside me
There's nothing like forgetting
Can't contain me set me free
I will never forget

The day the doctor told me son, you're gonna die
If you continue to live like this
You've got another year at best

15 years is a hard habit to quit

Cocaine and cigarettes
Stacked up with all the stress
Now mix with tons of boozing
In excess oh what a mess

Gimme poison that shit was killing me
All this for cheap excitement
Float my coffin out to sea

The day the doctor told me son you're gonna die
I decided then and there to get
Dead set on living
