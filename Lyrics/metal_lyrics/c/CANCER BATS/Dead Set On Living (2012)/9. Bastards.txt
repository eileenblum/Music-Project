Cursed, we all bear the mark
Headstrong, 'till the bitter end
The deadly course, bound to this track
We've all had our doubts, every doubt alive
Strayed from the light
Strayed from the light to the dark
Strayed from the light to the darkness
If it's gonna burn then we all turn to dust

Bastards! Headstrong and cursed
Bastards! The unwanted will unite

Convictions, but never alone
Taking chances, carried flesh and bone
Not a day goes by, with every doubt alive
Strayed from the light
Strayed from the light to the dark
Strayed from the light to the darkness
If it's gonna burn then we all turn to dust

Bastards! Headstrong and cursed
Bastards! The unwanted will unite

For every hawk there is a dagger
For every choice that's been made
Repercussions that never mattered
Felt scorn, debts been paid
Never learn, never will too far gone
Never learn, never thought we'd get this far gone

This will of mine
Set like an iron, like an iron spike
This will of mine, will be the death of me

Bastards! Headstrong and cursed
Bastards! The unwanted will unite
