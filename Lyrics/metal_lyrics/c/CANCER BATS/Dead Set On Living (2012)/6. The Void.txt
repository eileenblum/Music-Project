Question upon me
Sixty days away
Miles from perfect
Sixty days away
I don't know why
Must be broken

As we enter the void
Absolution waits for me
Cold hands of time
Closing round my neck
I need a new perspective
What we never had, what will never be
Flashing in my head
When I sleep at night, as I try my best
You ask me what I think
I think about survival

On the ocean floor
Dark as night. So alone
Forgot I was drowning

We've become obsolete
The great shift waits for me
Rough sands of time
Swallow me up whole
I need a new perspective
What we never had, what will never be
What does that even mean?
I can't sleep at night, I'm not at my best
You ask me what I think
I think about survival

On the ocean floor
Dark as night. So alone
Forgot I was drowning
