Rats! Turncoats and dead end friends
Self-centres and traitors
That will just try to break you and leave you
Rats! Cold fakes black hearts
Shit talkers that have no end
Low-lifer and haters
On a cycle to nowhere who don't care

There's a special place in hell for people like you
There's a special place in hell for the shit you've done

Rats! I'm sick and tired of getting fucked with
Nobodies lacing examples
So never think it's just you
Because it's us too

Rats! Never quit never change
World over they're all the same
We're unified in our hatred
That is the reason I wrote this

There's a special place in hell for people like you
There's a special place in hell for the shit you've done
There's a special place in hell for people like you
There's a special place in hell for every filthy rat

I'm counting down the days
I'm counting down the days 'til every rat has burned
I'm counting down the days
I'm counting down 'til every rat has burned in hell

There's a special place in hell for motherfuckers like you
There's a special place in hell for every filthy rat
