I've seen the eyes of the haunted
I've seen them run in the night
I've seen them cast in the shadows
I've seen it cut like a knife
All the mind see's corrupted by greed
As the world burns
Yeah with the stakes high
You get your cut of it
Ashes to ashes, ending all truth
No one survives

I've seen the hands of the hunter
I've seen them march to the right
Polluted with pride, changing of tides
As the world burns
Yeah with the stakes high
You get your cut of it
Highest of places, lowest of lows
No one survives

The fear, the light, the death
I am the son of the atom
The war, the sun, the hate
I am the nuclear winter
The fear, the light, the death
I am the son of the atom
The war, the sun, the hate
I'm breathing Armageddon

I tried to break from the cycle
I tried my best to decide
Ask the right questions see through the lies
As the world burns

Everything we know. Always been a lie

Yeah with the stakes high you get your cut of it
Cold hard facts absolute truths no one survives
Yeah let the fake shine there's no surviving it
Nothing to believe, nothing to perceive
As the world burns
