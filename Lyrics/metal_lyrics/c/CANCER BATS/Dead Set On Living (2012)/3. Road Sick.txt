Gave birth on the day of the beast
Got swept away by the days and the weeks
Rode hard 'til my hands hurt
The things that we do just make it work
Been saved by the kind souls
Richer than diamonds and gold

Don't lose hope, I'll be back home before you even know it
Don't lose hope, I've said it before but I'm always gonna mean it

This wasn't the life that I planned
I'm road sick, sick so road sick
But I'm trying the best that I can
I'm road sick, sick

Didn't land in this by mistake
Got lucky off the risks we'd take
Times had when I look back
The madness of minds on a single track
Still busting our hands and coughing blood
Couldn't stop if we could

Don't lose hope, I'll be back home before you even know it
Don't lose hope, I've said it before but I'm always gonna mean it

This wasn't the life that I planned
I'm road sick, sick so road sick
But I'm trying the best that I can
I'm road sick, sick

Oh and I know, what I've put you through
The stress that you've had
Patience is a virtue

Don't lose hope, I'll be back home before you even know it
Heard it said 1000 times before
Sure you're gonna hear it 1000 times more
And I don't know when this shits gonna end
But I know there's a light at the end of this tunnel
So don't lose hope and don't quit on me
'Cause you're the bright light and all that I need

This wasn't the life that I planned
I'm road sick, sick so road sick
But I'm trying the best that I can
I'm road sick, sick [x2]
