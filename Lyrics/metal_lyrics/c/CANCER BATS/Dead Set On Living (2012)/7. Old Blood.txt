Smoke cleared I never feared
Just rolling low decisions
Don't let your focus waiver
Just be a dedicator
Make you mind like a dagger to slit the throats of haters

That's why I gotta keep on climbing

Take time, get out of line
Don't get so complicated
Don't fall on superstition
Or blame that malnutrition
Just make your heart like a hatchet to crack the competition

This life is mine for the taking
And I'ma ride it until the day I die
This life is mine for the taking
And I'ma ride it, ride it, ride it

That's why I gotta keep on climbing x2
Cause life is just what you make it
So keep on riding and riding until you make it there
Cause life is just what you make it
So keep on riding and riding until you make it there

Never faded, I got this old blood
Pumping through my veins
Never faded, I got this old blood

This life is mine for the taking
And I'ma ride it hard 'til the day I die
(one, two, three, four)
This life is mine for the taking
And I'ma ride it, until the day I die
This life is mine for the taking
And I'ma ride it, ride it, ride it

That's why I gotta keep climbing x2
'Cause life is just what you make it
So keep on riding and riding until you make it there
Cause life is just what you make it
So keep on riding and riding until you make it there
Cause life is just what you make it
So keep on riding and riding until you make it there
Cause life is just what you make it
So keep on riding and riding until you make it yours
