Bang your head this is the new alliance
Our own laws is what we're living by
Distort all lines, live by your own desire
Our own guide for our own morals

Hopeless now ends, new world alliance

Bang your head this is the great upheaval
Time has come for us to make a change
Instill new ties, we'll forge a separate way
Our own guide for our own morals

Hopeless now ends new world alliance
Open your eyes, invert your mind
Reject the cast we are our own masters
Reject it all we are our own masters

Hopeless now ends, new world alliance
Open your eyes, invert your mind
Reject the cast we are our own masters
Reject it all we are our own masters

I don't believe from this day forward
I don't believe
Reject it all we are our own masters
