Pain is like my driver, driving me insane
I'm screaming out
Help me carry this burden
Pressure all around that tries to drag us to the deep
Grief like a halo around my neck

My salvation, bricks and mortar

Nailing shut my coffin, coughing in the rain
I'm screaming out
Help me shoulder this tombstone
Searching to defeat the many things that keep us weak
Greif like a halo around my neck

My salvation, bricks and mortar
Help save me from the cold

You can tear away my flesh
You can crush all my bones
But you will never take my soul

Broken like an arrow, arrow in my leg
I'm screaming for someone to shoulder this burden
Strengthen up our grip against the changing of the tide
Grief like a halo around my neck

My salvation, bricks and mortar
Help save me from the cold
Take this halo

I dream of bricks and mortar
Salvation for my soul
I dream of bricks and mortar
Help save me from the cold
