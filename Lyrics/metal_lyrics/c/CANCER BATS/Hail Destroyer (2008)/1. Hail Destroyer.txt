Tear us down
Welcome destruction with open arms
It's all to static.
bring it on, bring it on
Routine's so boring it makes me scream.
tear us down.
just tear us down
When fate just pushes us along
Children of nothing, this is our song.
Hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
we're rising up from ashes
Erase the comfort, erase the crutch
When given nothing we appreciate so much
A wake up call.
you just want to scream.
tear us down.
just tear us down
On our own terms of right and wrong
Children of nothing, this is our song
Hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
we're rising up from ashes
Hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
our lives begin when we fall down
Keep me incomplete
Keep it corroded the rust, the dust
Keep me incomplete
All sense of order can self destruct
Keep me incomplete
Reduced to rubble and time to shine.
Keep me incomplete
Tear us down and carry on
Children of nothing, this is our song
Hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
we're rising up from ashes
Hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
hail destroyer.
our lives begin when we fall down
