Outreaching the coldest left side
The city sleeps beneath me
Unrested, the longest night drives
The city sleeps tonight
Help, help me out some
Help, help me get this going
A thousand miles by night, straight as the crow flies
Could be a losing fight but never realized
Chasing right and wrong, countless miles from home
Without an end in sight, this is a battle song
Outreaching the coldest left side
The city sleeps beneath me
Unrested, the longest night drives
The city sleeps tonight
Help, help me out some
Help, help me get this going
Drive until the morning light, straight as the crow flies
A thousand pints of tar, left tired burnt eyes
The distance always long, keep rolling on
The highway's our own war, this is a battle song
A simple choice in life
Choose the left or the right
A simple choice in life
Choose the left or the right
Just keep it brutal
Outreaching the coldest left side
The city sleeps beneath me
Unrested, the longest night drives
The city sleeps tonight
Steady living the left hand
Steady living the left hand
Steady living the left hand
Steady living, the best that I can
