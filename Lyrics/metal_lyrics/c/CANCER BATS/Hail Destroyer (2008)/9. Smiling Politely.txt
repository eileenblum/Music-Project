It's all brand new
A precious start with the newest beginning, oh
So fresh and true
You'll just be fine if you let it to set in
(Yeah) This plague will thrive on the weary and beat down
(Yeah) This plague will thrive in the heart of us all
Give me shelter
This place is killing me
Give me shelter
This place is killing me
Your weakness is fear, we're preying on it
Your weakness is fear
You're such a brave start and now we're preying on it
You're such a brave start and now we're preying on it
Just passing through
So out of place and feeling so uninvited, oh
Sad but true
Histories wiped out, we'll shrug it off like the next man
(Yeah) This plague will thrive on the weary and beat down
(Yeah) This plague will thrive in the heart of us all
Give me shelter
This place is killing me
Give me shelter
This place is killing me
Your weakness is fear, we're preying on it
Your weakness is fear
You're such a brave start and now we're preying on it
You're such a brave start and now we're preying on it
You're such a brave start and now we're preying on it
You're such a brave start..
It's all brand new
A precious start with the newest beginning, oh
Cold and blue
Look on your face when all the eagles descend
Full of doubt, self conscious rides
Even at its best, this is a suicide
(Yeah) This plague will thrive on the weary and beat down
(Yeah) This plague will thrive in the heart of us all
Your price is set
You're bought and sold
Trapped in debt
This is a choke hold
Your price is set
You're bought and sold
Trapped in debt
This is a choke hold
Your price is set
You're bought and sold
Trapped in debt
This is a choke hold
