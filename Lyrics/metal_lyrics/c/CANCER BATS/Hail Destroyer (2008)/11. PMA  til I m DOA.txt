I might get dragged
There's times when life will mess me around
I'll tell you this here
Nothing's gonna bring me down
You're either living or dying
You're either living or dying
And as long as I'm breathing
I'll sing these words at the top of my lungs
Hey, hey, hey
Everyday I'm alive
Hey, hey, hey
Is the best day of my life
On the eve of destruction
Firmly gripped upper hand
Done our best to shake off the sickness
I might get dragged
There's times when patience's hard to be found
I'll say this here
Nothing's going to bring me down
There's no need to complain
Save your horseshoes and wishes
We'll make our own luck
We'll shape our future
Hey, hey, hey
Everyday I'm alive
Hey, hey, hey
Is the best day of my life
Annihilation faced without fear
Because I've lived to the fullest
Without remorse or an ounce of regret
I could die tomorrow
I might get dragged
There's times when I'll get knocked to the ground
I'll scream this here
Nothing's gonna bring me down
We're all given choices
Shake it up or just exist until you're gone
Get busy or get dead
That's my word, I'll stand by what I said
You're either living or dying
You're either living or dying
And as long as I'm breathing I'll live these words 'til the day that die
Everyday I'm alive's the best day of my life
