Honestly, I hope we all survive
I hope we all make it alive and I swear that I'm never coming back here
And I know that one day will be brighter
And I know that one day will be fine
Promise me, that you will try to survive
That you will make it alive
When I leave I know I'm never coming back here
And I know that one day will be brighter
The clouds will part and one day will be fine
And I know one day I'll see sunshine
Better off dead
She told me I'd be better off dead
She swore that I'd be better off dead
She screamed that I'd be better off, dead and buried
Held breath but it never got better
Hoped best, but I never did try
Pray for me, pray that I'll make it alive
Pray that I'll even survive
Ask your god what's the chance of getting out of here
And I know that one day will be brighter
And I know that one day will be fine
Constantly, I can't believe I'm alive
I can't believe I survived
I left running and I'm never coming back here
And I know that one day will be brighter
The clouds will part and one day will be fine
And I know that one day I'll see sunshine
Better off dead
She told me I'd be better off dead
She swore that I'd be better off dead
She screamed that I'd be better off, dead and buried
Held breath but it never got better
Just left at the very first sign
Held breath but it never got better
Never spoke just kept it inside
Held breath but it never got better
Hoped best but I never did try
Honestly, I hope we all survive
I hope we all make it alive
And I know that one day will be brighter
And I know that one day will be fine
And I know that one day will be brighter
And I know that one day will be fine
