Huh!
Here comes the rain
Pourin' down on you, pourin' down on me
Darkened skies
Block out the light, yeah
Let the rain pour down
This water, this pressure still risin'
This water, this pressure still risin'
Here comes the storm
Crushin' down on you, crushin' down on me
And these clouds
Dedicate tonight, yeah
Let the rain pour down
This water, this pressure still risin'
This water, this pressure still risin'
And there will be no sunshine
For a hundred days
We're all here drownin'
There will be no sunshine
Every day's the same
We're all here drownin'
There will be no sunshine
Every day just rain
We're all here drownin'
This day will be the death OF ME
This (?) will be the death OF ME
