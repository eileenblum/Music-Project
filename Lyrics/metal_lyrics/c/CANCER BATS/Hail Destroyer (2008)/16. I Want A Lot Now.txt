[Re-issue bonus track]
[Murder City Devils cover]

Livin's no good across the lake from the city
Don't want to live there anymore
Take the car and go to thecity
Just like last week and the week before

Gettin sick of school, you know it sure is shitty
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Turn up this slade
On the stereo
I know it's late
I don't want to go home

Livin's no good across the lake from the city
Don't want to live there anymore
Take your dads car and we'll go to the city
Just like last week and the week before

I'm feelin' couped up, you know it sure is shitty
I don't want to live here anymore
I know it's late
I said I know it's late
I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go home

Livin's no good across the lake from the city
Don't want to live there anymore
Take your dads car and we'll go to the city
Just like last week and the week before

Kids are sure lookin' good in the city
I'm gonna go to a rock n' roll show
I know it's late
I don't wanna go home
There's no reason
No reason to go home

Livin's no good across the lake from the city
Don't want to live there anymore
We'll take your car and we'll go to the city
Just like last week and the week before

Livin's no good this side of the city
Don't want to live there anymore
We'll take a bridge and we'll go to the city
Won't come back here any more
