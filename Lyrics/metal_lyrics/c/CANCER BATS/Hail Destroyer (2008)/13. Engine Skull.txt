[Re-issue bonus track]

I can't get rid of my pain
I plan to get ahead of my turf
I just wanna do everything
Never ever wanna let me say
Better ask your conscious back
Can't take this once I conquer
Ambitions don't have anything to say
I can't get any play

I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
From a one-track mind

Warning.. stand back
Suffer, the same way
Just like you
Warning.. stand clear
Suffer, the same way
Just like you

On this stage, we run away
Well when we look on this and say, we've won
We we gotta have something changed
Can't stop this like we keep it
Can't afford it any other way
There's something still gonna creep in

I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
From a one-track mind

Warning.. stand back
Suffer, the same way
Just like you
Warning.. stand clear
Suffer, the same way
Just like you

On this stage, we run away
Well when we look on this and say, we've won

Burn me alive
Searching for something
Burn me alive
Set me free
Burn me alive
Grasping at nightmares
Burn me alive
Let me sleep

I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
From a one-track mind

I can't run away
I can't run away
I can't run away
From a one-track mind
