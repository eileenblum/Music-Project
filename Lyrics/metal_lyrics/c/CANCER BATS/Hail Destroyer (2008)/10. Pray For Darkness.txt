Out in the sunshine, I can't hack it
Give me the night with a black jean jacket
Yeah
Yeah
Out in the day light, over rated
Block out the sun because I fucking hate it
Pray for darkness
Out in the sunshine, I can't hack it
Hide me away in a darkened casket
Give me pale skin
Give me dark eyes
Let the moon rise
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Sleep all day
Party every night
Never grow old
Never die
Out in the sunshine, I can't hack it
Midnight forever in a black jean jacket
When the night time is the best time
Pray for darkness
