I swear to god, I never meant to break your heart dear
If I had to say, couldn't tell you what I was doing
I left one day, for open waters on a course to ruin
No land in sight, I just drifted where the tides would pull me
No compass or light, life on a boat will make you miss the country
Anchors aweigh!
Anchors aweigh!
I'm here to stay, my days at sea are done
I've sailed an ocean of mistakes
Been given so many chances
Never again will I set sail towards regret
If I could take it all back - oh no
Unlive your past will only rob your future
If I could take it all back - oh no
Unlive the past would never get us to now
I swear to god, I never meant to mess you around girl
Never was my plan, been floating two years or so
Glad I made it to land, despite the rocks and the undertow
No maps or chart, sometimes a journey just takes that long
Call this a fresh start, show that I'm right, prove all those wrong
Anchors aweigh!
Anchors aweigh!
I'm here to stay, my days at sea are done
I've sailed an ocean of mistakes
Been given so many chances
Never again will I set sail towards regret
If I could take it all back - oh no
Unlive your past will only rob your future
If I could take it all back - oh no
Unlive the past would never get us to now
