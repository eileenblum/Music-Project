Starving - like a pack of wolves in the city
We'll chase our future down the barrel of a gun
To what end?
Haunted - by the siren song of the concrete
Never ending travel
One mile at a time is our lives
No more dead time
Look outside, look outside, dream me away
No more dead time
Cast aside, cast aside, throw me away
Slaughtered - countless hours in a lifetime
We'll mourn these minutes left in unmarked graves, respect paid
Charging - through the forest of steel trees and asphalt
No rest for the wicked, no breaks in the chain
Let's ride
No more dead time
Look outside, look outside, dream me away
No more dead time
Cast aside, cast aside, throw me away
The greatest thing you've ever done, is made yourself truly happy
Not doing it for anyone
It's your life to live as you choose
The greatest thing you've ever done
And the greatest thing you've ever done
Lived your life and never felt regret
Lived your life, not quitting yet
Without a set of goals, where no agenda lies
Just a followed heart and don't apologize
It's the greatest thing when you realize
Haunted - at the thought of another day wasted
When love is never lost, no matter at what cost
Get free
Starving - like a pack of wolves
We'll live our lives screaming
No more dead time
