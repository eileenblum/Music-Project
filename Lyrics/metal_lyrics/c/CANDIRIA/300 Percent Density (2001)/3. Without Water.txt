[CHAPTER ONE]

Check the vertical damages
We'll wrap you up in bandages, for real
My heart is made of flesh
My tongue of steel
irradicating the nervous system
spinal cord retraction
head lock
we flowin' rugged and nappy like jamaican dreadlocks
eclectic episodes
these cat's is maulin' on blocks
and i'll have you spinnin' like a dozen of beers crawlin' on rocks
and ya state of self corrodes, it's like i told you before

You can't walk through the profits without livin' the raw
knockin' on doors
sometimes i had to sleep on the floor
with nothin but steady oxygen and spit flows for dinner
we'd be burnin in the summer
freezin in the winter
we'd be rockin' the latest flip flops to avoid the wooden splinters
From the depths of the grimy earth until i reach the heavenly borders
From the depths of the grimy earth like four dogs without water
And yo i peeped it from the get
I saw them coming through peripheral lenses
military action for my defenses
Take ya chances with these dogs and this fortified gate
and if you think ya rhymes are phat you better gain some weight.

[CHAPTER TWO]

Sleep in my wounds
crawl through
attend to the hives
the dragons shall elude
Slave
speak your foundations
Words that guide
dwell within
without water
left of kin
dry

[CHAPTER THREE]

Inflammatory languages serpents from inside
setting
Blind with no advantages
the roots evolve into the
wasted
idle talk supposing dead
selfish
Cursed is the womb that lies infested
Cracked bones inflicted
secreting all the parts of thine
Search for purpose weighs
aim the arrows at this heart of mine
Dehydrated
left to die
Man of earth scheduled to expire
smothered by desires

[CHAPTER FOUR]

Where's my bretheren
I hold
you close to my heart
more precious than gold
friend
I will build you up
drink this breath of mine
Jars of clay
without water
quench the blaze
drench

[CHAPTER FIVE (A)]

Coma's comin through with service and a smile reaction
I told you on beyond reasonable
The first song was faction
at the time the death was comfortable
left to die in a ditch
At the time my breath was combustible
so my scars would stitch
Slow bleed, reflections of black gloves on a fist
Unleash the hounds if they try to resist

[CHAPTER FIVE (B)]

The heart reveals
the man to himself
The sharks shall conceal
the vibrant man from himself
Still tempted by the palaces of the earth
symptoms of a devil
Stones that cast a shadow
spitting flesh with words
Black hole yearning
the flesh still
now burning
Appetite of the vermin shall persuade
