[CHAPTER ONE]

slip and fall through the cracks
conceptual decay
the shades of thought seems to systematically
fall away
rip through the herds
lost flock
pieces of substance
the keys that will unlock
pauper
lacking evidence
no focus
no feeling
blind to emptiness
all dark
inanimate heart
the temperatures expanding
a distant landscape
caution while handling
wildfires that devastate

[CHAPTER TWO]

shred
the binds that grasp and choke
they'll cut you down to size
instinct will derail the razor throat
to reveal those that despise
break through
break loose from the adversary
combatant apathies
downface

[CHAPTER THREE]

accumulated storms of concern
conceal
like pollutants that invoke cancer burns
scars revealed
scabbed cysts
dungeons that fade
arsenic
an example of many things to come
pessimist
introducing destructive heresies
flee from that state of mind
seducing the unstable

[CHAPTER FOUR]

motivate the engines to inflate
the true outcome

condensation
entrapped by the snares of speech
reveling in the fantasies
pig return to the mud
swine
derelict unrefined
morphine state
recline

[CHAPTER FIVE]

lusting after parasites
gut filled
criminals in disguise
carousing of the entities
skull tumor
sealed with the lack of properties
consumer
i stand resisting
claws on my back
writing from the inside
i remain intact
i
follow
things that cannot be seen by the open eyes
bathing in your vomit whilw penalized

[CHAPTER SIX]

climates in vertical
amputate the beast
amputate your faults
these produce fleas
soul torn flesh produced these
gravitate pitiful
ravaged by the things that feed and cannot
be denied
burn
dead
lost
wretch
