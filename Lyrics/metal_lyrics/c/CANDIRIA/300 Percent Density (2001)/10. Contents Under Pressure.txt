where do you see yourself?
answer this question
are you residing amongst the introverts?
do your bowels swell?
behind enemy lines? covert
all this has been felt
continued to complain
outlining the frames
converted into saturated spores
this truth deranged
is your faith restored?
inaccurate
more so than before

fertilize the ground
that cultivates your assets
symbols of excellence
i will secure thyself against the caskets
rest not
the dwell within must grow
persecution
resolution
disperse the clots
withstand the blows
endure the terrors
it is a strength that can't be tamed
the strength of things contained
scold the vast offenses
critical conditions
defenseless
the stomach growls
discipline
chosen food for my survival
setting the first example
ample
overcome with the challenges
of a contaminated vision

never the less
always the more
layers beneath
swallow
digest
sprouting the roots that produce
milk from the breast
flow through the veins
proteins
vessel unseen
thoughts becoming
whether foul or clean
a product of these
perfect animations
interactive
residuals
server the ties
associates of the spiritually diseased
whirlwinds of disaster

qualities divine
run from the walls
that
rip you down
thieves
that will
lie and astound
expressing obscurities profound
respectable?
violent policies
divide the animals

anticipation of the effects engrained
widespread
bleeding through the orifices
epidemic concentrates
rupture
blister
the plastering of the subordinates
the mastering of the inordinates
alternatives

the body can lead you astray
from those you love
passions
smack them down
structures that disrupt
this half cannot be replaced
these wide open
embrace
sweat in the eyes
shut
tight
vandalized
majesties that decline
