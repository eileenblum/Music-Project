through suffering
my existence is made whole
upward pure
the strength of character is raised
thorns that lead to a rose
eradicate the fences
improving from failures that weaken my defenses
wake up
and overcome
inhale the life
this blood of one
dust of the earth
can a man walk through the furnace
without garments being burned?

deviate the senses spawned
i see the calm rivers and i'm searching for dawn
my perception overwhelming the herds
spit them out
drowning tides that perverse
opposite from my reaction, the disasters absurd
and the things of no form despise
and the things of no form deprive
early morning darkness
splitting veins from the wrist
who will be the farthest?
separate the districts
what?
what's your state of mind?
what's your state of life?
what's your take on death?
do you speak words of the masses?
if so, your throat is bottomless

observe the turning points that threaten to respond
defend
seeds that struggle tom come into fruition
unripened
this inner being
a consuming fire
that spills from the mouth
a foundation desired
at one with the elements

stable
ground with no illusions
streamline
speech with no pollution
appealing to the gestures
altering the momentum with natural selection

feasting on the blemishes congested
kerosene
acidic smile perfected
pours
phlegm induced pours
down flow infected

running against the tides
swell
swallowed whole
spewing the venom of snakes from their nostrils
arms that fold
detestable
secret practices
false
doctrines that mold
