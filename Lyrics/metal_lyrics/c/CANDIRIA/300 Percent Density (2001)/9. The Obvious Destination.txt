downcast of shadows
the self denied
the self denied of hidden places
lost passages
pure volatile
dripping from the cracks that keep you
lost in parables
convulsions of the epileptic kingdoms that bestow
clean
thorough
antiseptic
scrubbing deep into the bone
condensing the marrow
taste perfected
the cattle won't disown
the human man must be inspected
if i were to touch you
would you wither in my arms?
and if i were to love you
would you motion to disarm?
sense of warning

rigid from the petrified essence
estimated measures
celestial
in my presence
a stew of precious treasurers
reaction from the casualties
that surround me slithering
a transparent excess suppressing
pull the lever

fall - infected - down

miracles designed for success
all of \us
are you harvesting with the maggots?
falling hard with dung on your breath
infesting what is pure and damaged
like swarms of locust feeding
born first
still in needing

alert the dogs
flee
an expert on penalty
without vision the birds of the air will
pick at your skull
calloused
clothed in darkness
tragedies
turn
providing alternatives
development
additives
sediments
firm
evolving
supporting the process
dedicated
moments of silence

quest of the new
increasing the magnification of your velocity
would this be considered growth
through hypocrisy
advancement
merging with the contents of the universe
the focus of enhancement
evacuate the premises that continue to revolve
cluttering of arrangements that continue to dissolve
you
accelerate
beyond the surrounding borders
maintain the order
irradiation
the newest method of preservation
radioactive
spastic and down for the cause
spoiled by mold
nuclear turbines
fuel injected outlawed
newton's third law of motion
