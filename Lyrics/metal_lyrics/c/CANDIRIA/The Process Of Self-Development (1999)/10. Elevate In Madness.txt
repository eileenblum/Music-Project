deep
deeper than the stain of twisted guilt that
hungers for the laceration of the negligence
taste the fruit
and all of its wickedest perfection
the sorrows that linger in the temple of thyself
madness
clutching to the wall of thoughts
consuming all the superstitious ignorance
that has been taught
elevate
to the highest level of the mental filthiness
that drifts along the tides of burdened grief

reality decays
all of humanity now crumbling in its way
seasons of depression
bringing forth the heathens of the life
now the sickness is revealed to the yes
hatred flowing through the arteries
of educated man
fermenting in its grace
everlasting pure
rancid properties
now left disconsolate by iniquities
dwell in the conviction
now the growing breathes

pure
filthiness
at one with the ailments
coma sick
lost
for all this time
passageway to disease
infects love
eat
knowledge feeds
reproducing in swarms
hunger of the bees
life
potent sting
poison of the tongues persisting

human
stink
suffering
subconscious
now betrays
deep in
profanities
famine
sweeps
the heart
and love
now exists
heartless
less of heart
trembleth at thy
thoughts
insanity
in the abundance
they cry hungry

time weeps
bringing the twist of
desires to horror
the worlds bleed
plagued by the arrogance
of the forefathers
breathe
inhale the fumes
of perpetual loathing
pain
divine
mental divinity of those
who are suffering
violent skies
deep in torment
mother cannabis
take me to total redemption

want
bleed
justice
close-minded fools
still fetus
power rage deep
deep within the illness
stay creep
seek and you
shall find madness
open your skull
mysteries of the darkness
eyes red with mother
the truly burned
pass her to thy brother
want
bleed
justice...death

traveling through the soul
centuries pondering
seeping through
the cracks
drip, drip, drip
conforming
breed in possession
condemned child
multiply
fertilize in mass
healthy death
opened eye
