my love despises hate
and hate despises love
catastrophic tone
transforming the structures
in which we live
activate the severed episodes
different pose
same physique
which one in life does wisdom seek?
the ultimate utility
disturbing the behaviors
in such ways that can't be reached
unless the mold
was cracked a thousand times
enhancing the developments

awaken
infinite third eye expansion
this thing of ours
holds
stands
firm
steel foundation
deep rooted
fractured skulls are opened

the temperatures are rising
motivate the self to form
up from the down
exhaust
recycled norm
unaware of the excrements
slapping you down
arrows spewing breathing evolution
cycles astound
plentiful
the years shall go on 365 days
plant the seed
planting the seeds
tap in to the master kingdom
comfort the seas
essence of all the dynasties
arms embracing
the rivers overflow
weaving frames stronger
than mountains
iron whole

sluggard
lost all the glimmer in the eyes
lacking luster
gloating with intent
parasite
brittle
vanished
they the vicious
an aftermath of visual sensations
favoring the intelligence
wandering in search of understanding

columns of three
parade
increasing with the presence of degrees
designate
constant elevating
mental state
competing with the cattle
sponge, soak, consume
an assortment of the
many flavors that pursue
the suggested connection
bursting into an emotional collapse
this thirst has reflection
multiplied by all these things
all these keys
and all they bring
unlock the doors to your excellence

i will inhale this green redemption
fulfilling the true essence
fall
face first
in opposition
the stepping stone to progression
radiate in this splendor
ambition
calculate the strategies
disrupting the existence
keeping the balances
can you see my vision?

take this stone
pile of brick
my backbone unbreakable
legions of demons in heat
my war is spiritual
chasing on the heels of my
charred feet
seducing
burning me with breath
the vinegar posture pours
it infests

suffering
within yourself
while the truth has you dying alone
hate behind these eyes holds a destiny
i use the pain to fuel the fire inside
your choices have you trapped
where every step leads to a path
that has you back at the start
you might escape defeat
in a world out to get you
but the finger on the trigger is yours

if i come of one
will you understand the depths of me?
perceivable
i can only belong to the man in me
they no longer believe in a cause
they amputate
persuasive speech to entice
the human flaws
I move to associate
we believe in the vision
we believe in the goals
we believe in the universe
and the hands that touch the soul
persecuted for my gaping jaws
bleeding the gums
walking with the dogs
the ultimate reality sense of all strength
heals the sores

injustice prevents me
from the goals I set for me
overwhelmed by boundaries
power trips
adversity
these demons fuck my mind
and have tried to suck my pride
robbed me of my success
driven me into unrest
but I shall not lie for them
show them that I do intend
to exceed beyond the trends
break the limits I've been sent
