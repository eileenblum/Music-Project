victim of atrocities
my razor blade
the oceans shall rise sky deep reach inevitable
chaotic pace
smoke stack pollutes digestion
is the end of man upon us friend?
if it is so
wrath of mother earth upon us friend?
thy soul shall crumble
the cleansing process
suffocate the infectants

organica
i'll send my swollen dreams
sunami thereafter
i'll clean the still and fragile plate clean
better fools than me
i'll cut it off
run it off
set it off
anticipating thieves

dire wraths haunt this garden of never-smile
volcanic magma spiteful lava
spitting venom and bile

my veins pump masochistic visions
in some morse-code rescue transmissions
confusion cutting circles
in the crops and high plains
raising cain, the king of pain
as catastrophic reigns
i drown the desert
shout down the sky
command the forces of nature
to bow down before me and die
