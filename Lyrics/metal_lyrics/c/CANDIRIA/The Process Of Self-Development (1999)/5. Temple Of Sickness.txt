welcome to the temple
it devastates
devastates inside
obscured to be simple
tolerance
eager to confide
elevate in madness
abstract darkness
the temple shall posses
stubborn and left thirsty
fear embraced
death seems endless

blind
absurdities
escalate
in vehemence
downpour of
abominations
aching needs
paradise within

soul
less
empty all the voices linger deep
rise
weep in everlasting consumption
feed
all the temples of society
sick
sicker than the locusts of the earth
burn
burn within the temple of the blind
scream
scream within the temple of the
deaf blackness

down
smashing
crush thy skull
bring it forth
bleeding
wake up
vermin
you disgrace
miserable
silent

spiral illness
chained to the skies
chambers in black
conceal the outside
find the menace
in thine own eye
the criminal
saturates

exquisite torture
crawl within the shadows
temple of sickness
eve of hate has cometh
the voices persuade
persuading the webs of mental
confinement

unclean
linger with thee
find the darkness
impurity breeds
vilest
of the vilest
suffocating
all the weakness
ache
thoughts are aching
passion burns deep
inviceration
fertile
seeds are fertile
mental penis
penetrates all
through the kingdoms
of subconscious

pain
disgusting
fall into the arms
redeeming
teased
unseen
in all of its
vulgarities
pride
boiling
purest of the ways
are spoiling
soul
vacant
forsaken temple
lies sacred
