Kill
This death is comfortable
Beggar's life intolerable
Running with the madmen
Lowest of fears can't fathom
Measure your breath in fractions
Fists clenched
Touch my heart it mends
Sour taste can't pretend
Visions of hope burn deep inside
Shine through the hidden eye
The burden of fixation preys
Won't lift and dissipate
Muzzle
The barking tongues
Sweetened breath invade my lungs
Now i can see the truth in full
A matter of fact impressionable
The love in me is sensual
Soul of mine disperse
Veins are boiling
Remedy deserts
Constant hurting
Back
Give me back
All of my respect for self
Shameless
And full of shit
Absence of the inner wealth
Run
Time is racing
Slave puppet
Vexed
Cut your life
From the point of view
That keeps you on your backside
Trust in my clique
Odds are
One to six
Revolution of the sick
Give it up Give it up
Give it up for the mastermind
rotherhood like family
Spiritual design
The verbal menace
Welcome to my madness
Elimate
The cause
Factions ise up then deply
Non attractive
The language of the masses
Am I of the ashes?
My friend
Blood runs thick until the end
Upright position
Move in the forward fashion
Opposition
Cambodia ascends
The striking similarity reeks
Bastardized to walk with
Weak of weak
Which do you seek?
The victory or defeat
Peace beautifies all,
A kingpin standing tall
Never fall
Who will be the first to crawl?
I respect.
If you need a hand I'll lend
If you respect me over backwards I will bend
Deny the disguise in disgust
Are you sleeping with the demons
To evolve into your lust?
