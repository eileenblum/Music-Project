We stand divided
The cypher of the sick
If you look you'll find it
Amplification of the voice may segregate
Trivia's spray
Emphasize the rules and meditate
Look away
A barrage of multi-compressed hate
Observe the most incompetent breed deceived
pollinate the anger more than once
You must conceive
Frantic aggravation
The hidden instinct must be retrieved
Third eye retaliation
Suffocate the leaders of the nations
Disgraced
The lips are laced
Execute my limbs just to kick me in the face
The mutant elements
Area of descent
Multiplied by mass of ten
Smack the simpleton
The jaw
Will it descend
Beware of snakes that you befriend
Fend off the signs of adversity
The urgent abnormal desire is
Forever chasing me
Bring the cloud of
Greenpeace fantasies
Mother of mine
We rape your lungs
Constantly
Separate in views we can't combine
The theory of our selfish philosophies
Spreads
Mother leave us for dead
Procrastinate
The blood of life instead
Harness our wrists
The tales of we, once pacifist
Plead soldiers in devour
Lopsided with belief
Temples deprived
Like withered flowers
Stems of hypocrisy
Disperse
Redundant with the process
Reverse up and down
Backwards in excess
Infinite struggle
Of territory
Liar...Liar...Liar
Participate in penalties
Pollutants in feast they now defend
Tarnished with the most
Criminal tendencies
