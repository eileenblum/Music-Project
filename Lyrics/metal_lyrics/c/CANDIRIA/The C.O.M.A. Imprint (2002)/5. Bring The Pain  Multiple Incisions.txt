Speak in flames
Infliction the devices
Resting on the shadows false promises
Still
Arousing still
Separating all of that you feel which still
Continues to condemn you for your ways
A thought that wreaks of pain
An act of true emotion
Burn the styrofoam remains
Multiple incisions
A puncturing of the many senses
A lack of truth evolved
Raw defenses
And a portrait of you depth declined
Swine Apprentice
For one example
The flock was raised in the cold
Points of afterbirth, Suffocate from the cold
And I'm pouring out my chest, leaking in the
Freezing cold
Heed the chosen words, produce manifold
I paid my dues
My hands calloused and ashed
Reveal infected wounds and my scabbing scars
Caress my broken back
