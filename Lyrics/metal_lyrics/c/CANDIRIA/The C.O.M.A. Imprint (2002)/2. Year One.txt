The year is one
Dominance
Immune to the obstruction
The dawn of awkward legacies
Proliferate
Concocted in degrees of mental state
Nature unifies - pure and innocent
Syndicate the fall of the continents
Vehicles of insult
Discharged, Catapult
Discipline
Motives of intoxication emerge
In next of kin
Durable but still fatigued
Fungus on the mind
Impulse Temple of apathies
Numbsight represent
The absolute magnificent
We fascinate the infantile
A sinister, in profile
The germ influence Family in bond
The pride is strong
The loose mouth antiseptic prolongs
Lead in stride
Culture of fury
Festivals of thought
Parsuading, Mass is strong
As strong as the man in me
Thug in keep of what he sees
Greed flavored
The rapic hands don't sleep
Oral message not convincing
Not taking to your liking
Slit their throats and leave them begging
Drenched with passion
Heart is burning
I'll crack the skulls continuous
Infect the ears now left sensuous
The tactics of a mind ajar
Leaving wounds
Leaving mental scars
Year one
The gathering of the underground
Millions of unheard voices
Ready to claim their answer now
You set you trap - But we counterattack
Escape like a phat rat
Music of war surrounds
It's the beginning... Of the final round
