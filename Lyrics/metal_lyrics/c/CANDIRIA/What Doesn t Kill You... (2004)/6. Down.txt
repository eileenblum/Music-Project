I cannot sit back, shed my broken skin.
Curse my pride, I react. Played yourself again.
Up down, and down again.
You live in a computer. You're an instant man.
Judged and told I can't. Cut your shallow hands.

How can I please all of your needs?
What do you see, when you see me?

I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view
Stand up, lay down for no one.
Take a piece of me with you.
Step back, now that I know you.
I know you're down for no one.

I bow down to no one. You lack the faith.
Stand behind me, find your way.
You know you will decide
To move on with me, or step aside.
I could have lost my life
And I'm ready to risk it one more time.

How can I please all of your needs?
What do you see, when you see me?

I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view
Stand up, lay down for no one.
Take a piece of me with you.
Step back, now that I know you.
I know you're down for no one.

I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view.
Stand up, lay down for no one
Take a piece of me with you.
Step back, now that I know you.
I know you're down for no one.
I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view.
Stand up, lay down for no one.

Take a piece of me
Take a piece of me
Take a piece of me with you.
