[CHAPTER 1]
I'll break it down right in front of you.
I will tell you my story.
From birth, a bastard's point of view.
Occultic bloodline flowing through my family.
Was I rejected sperm [and] my mother your flesh cup in the line of fire?
The product of you drunken pig lust, you're the burden that you eat.
I'll push you off the highest mountain to penetrate your palace of hypocrisy.
The master of the breeding field has spilled his shame on me.
Hopeless; The vacant son. What was two, is down to one.
Turned your front and back to remove the spine.

[CHAPTER 2]
Molded bread filled with poison
Callused hands - tempers boiling. How dare you?

[CHAPTER 3]
Lie down. Unfaithful. Intrude.
Where did this come from? Your grip will devour.
You wolves. Your sacred lamb. Hypocrite. Worm

[CHAPTER 4]
I will rise strong. Your lies inconsistent.
I will rise strong. Inconsistent.
Heathen! Drunkard! Half of man!
Lost dog! You killed me! You killed us!
Broken! Broken!

[CHAPTER 5]
Tears for nothing. Tears for you.
This made me strong. Where were you?
All is forgiven by me stranger.
When you died, did you eat your cancer?
You left so soon. Give me closure
