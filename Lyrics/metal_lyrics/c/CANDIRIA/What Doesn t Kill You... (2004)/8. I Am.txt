I am man. I am dog. I am weak.
Cries for sympathy.
I am rock. I am strong. I am you.
You are the worst of me.
Saving me. Saving you.
Killing me. Killing you. Saving me

Is this all that you wanted?
My scars for your veins.

Reshape me, I break the mold.
You made me. I made you whole.

I am dirt. I am filth. I am shit,
Cursing behind your back.
I am light. I am hope. I am the spine.
That's in your back.
Saving me. Saving you.
Killing me. Killing you. Killing me.

Reshape me, I break the mold.
You made me. I made you whole.

My eyes will see in, out.
Dimensions of the spirit, while you're dripping from the mouth.
In tongues, you lye. You fall. Get up!
Let me caress your inner thoughts
Before you heart is swallowed up.
I said get up. I am you in me.
Dirt for water. Blood on my teeth.
Lick my wounds not clean.

Reshape me, I break the mold
You made me. I made you whole
Reshape me, I break the mold
You made me. I made you whole
