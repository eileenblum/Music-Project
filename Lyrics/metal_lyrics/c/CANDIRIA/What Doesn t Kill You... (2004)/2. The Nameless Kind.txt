Your life means nothing until you grasp the challenge of struggles.
Dwelling inside, pressure is a rising flood, stress.
I the nameless king. I am he who speaks in flames.
The form of who I was embracing me.

I'm sizing you up. I'm breaking you down.
You think I'm suffocating but I'm watching your drown.
I'm sizing you up. I'm breaking you down.
You think I'm suffocating but I'm taking you down.
Taking you down. Watching you drown

I've walked the endless mile. Can you feel the pressure?
My heart splits in two and it leaks forever. I can't wait. I suffocates.
It rises up constantly, choking inside of me, forever.

I am a fountain of pain.
I will expose myself to feed you all; A bleeding hole that drips in me.
Without you I will fall.
I will break myself in pieces so you can pick me up.
Believe it! Believe it! Believe it! It will mend my stitches shut.

I'm sizing you up. I'm breaking you down.
You think I'm suffocating but I'm watching your drown.
I'm sizing you up. I'm breaking you down.
You think I'm suffocating but I'm taking you down.

I've walked the endless mile. Can you feel the pressure?
My heart splits in two and it leaks forever. I can't wait. I suffocates.
It rises up constantly, choking inside of me, forever.

Rise up or take a bow.
Stand up. If not, then laydown.
Lay flat on your back - you will regret your past.
Break it up. Look around.
My face will be the last... Be the last.

I've walked the endless mile. Can you feel the pressure?
My heart splits in two and it leaks forever. I can't wait. I suffocates.
It rises up constantly, choking inside of me, forever.
