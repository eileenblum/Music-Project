Men of the Earth
You have soiled you're so foul
With lips of infected sullen
You will indulge yourself

So digest your consequences
The Serpent's venom runs inside of you
Your lust, desire will blind your senses
Whirlwinds of disaster for you
(for you)

Remove yourself
And take your breath away
Rebuild yourself
Before you fall away

And i will lift you from the bottom
And my hope will fade away
I must pick you up
So you can survive the day

Touch what you can't have
While i have what you can't touch for now
My friend, all of this will turn to ash

Who is your God?
Or is it a Devil?
Igniting your catastrophe
Your spine will bend
Spiritual anatomy

Remove yourself
And take your breath away
Rebuild yourself
Before you fall away

And i will lift you from the bottom
And my hope will fade away
I must pick you up
So you can survive the day

Rebuild who you are
And stay away
Remove all your scars
Stay away

Will you stay away

But you won't remove yourself

Remove yourself
And take your breath away
Rebuild yourself
Before you fall away

And i will lift you from the bottom
And my hope will fade away
I must pick you up
So you can survive the day

Remove yourself
