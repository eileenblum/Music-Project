[CHAPTER 1]
Burn your fears away. Burn your bridges.
Rise up against the chains that bind you.
Remove your harness. Up,Down,Left,Right.
I am man that makes me strong. Faction.
Cut your life. Sing with me. Blood is power.
Stand with me. Die for honor with nail in hand,
I bleed for you... Bleed for you.

[CHAPTER 2]
I'll watch the palaces fall under my feet.
We'll devastate the walls. Pure hysteria!
Hairs will stand up on your neck-fecal matter
On their breath. So spit them out. They have come
To infiltrate with demons in their mouth.
Run, Hide. Hunted is the prey. Like lost sheep
We have gone astray.

[CHAPTER 3]
Run

[CHAPTER 4]
I will speak of the wars that lye ahead.
Your slavery is subliminal; The message forced.
Digging its teeth into your head. Bombarded with
Scenarios. This is the morning of the end.
This is the morning of the chaos that begins.
A scream forever leaking from your burning kin.
Illuminate the king. Forms of worship

[CHAPTER 5]
Open your heart. Let me enter your kingdom.
You're running with arms apart. They lied to you.
They lied to you. Disguising what is real.
The gun is in your mouth. Stand strong and pull it out.
They will burn, BURN!!!
They will burn, burn, BURN!!!
