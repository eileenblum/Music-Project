Have you ever felt as if every piece of your life is scattered all over the place?
As if your personal puzzle is broken and some pieces have been misplaced?
Some can't find the strength to mend their puzzle.
Some need help to get back on track.
Help to make those realize, they have what it takes.
Within everyone, we were all born with a purpose.
We are equal.
Some just don't know it yet.

If you look at anyone in life, and start with the basics,
you'll realize that everyone is the same.
We all serve the same purpose; success.
We all strive to be successful in our craft.

The problem is that there are people who will deliberately
go out of their way to stop your dreams.
There are people that will limit your abilities to fulfill theirs.

This is what makes our world unjust.
Nobody can work together.
Nobody can help others achieve their dreams.

Sometimes, it makes me question
whether or not this life is even worth it.
Sometime, I feel as if there is no winning.
(there is no winning)

All you can do in this life,
is be the best person you could possibly be.
Help one another. Focus on doing good each day.
If a day goes by that you didn't help someone,
you have wasted away that day.
