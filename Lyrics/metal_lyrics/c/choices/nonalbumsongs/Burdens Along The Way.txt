Along the way it has been a long and hard battle.
Sometimes life makes experience such things
to see the world through different eyes.
Without experiencing all emotions,
there is no room for empathy.
How can you relate to something you've never felt before?

I've been so broken, so badly bruised and beaten,
that I never though my heart would recover.
But the power of faith can bring you a long way.

There is no greater feeling than overcoming your inner demons,
There is no greater feeling than seeing light in your darkness.

These burdens along the way, will never be forgotten.
But they will surely be corrected.
There is no hope in erasing experienced memories,
that's just unrealistic.
All you can do is live and learn.
Don't make the same mistake twice.

There is no greater feeling than overcoming your inner demons,
There is no greater feeling than seeing light in your darkness.
