Have you ever been discouraged?
Have you ever felt that you weren't good enough?
Have you ever been told you weren't good enough?
Have you ever been convinced you're worthless?

The truth is, those things may be true. If you let them be.
If you'll sit and let people treat you that way,
that's who you'll become.
In this life, it's all about strength.
How much can you take
When the world is weighing down on you,
will you have the strength to fight back?
Don't be the slave,
Be the warrior.
Be the spartan.
Be the soldier.
Be the fighter.

It's your choices whether you're walked on or not.
It's your choices whether or not you let life bring you down.
It's in your power to overcome your problems.
It's all within you.

Without doubt, you can go a long way.
Doubt is an illness that people program in your mind.
It's nonexistent. It's imaginary.
You can have faith in anything you put your heart,
mind and soul into. You just have to believe.
