The world has tried to bring me down, but I'm still standing.
We're forced fed lies. Our lives are predetermined.
We're in a cycle created by those in higher power.
I will not obey. I will not convey.

How long will it take before the world clues in?
How many lives will be taken?

Is everyone so brainwashed that they have lost sight of reality?
Life is supposed to be about freedom. But we are far from free.
We're run by a created plan by those who want to be dominant.
Forced to believe they are there to help, but that's far from accurate.

To me it seems evident. We're just a mouse inside of a cage.
When will the oblivious open up their eyes?

A world without government, wouldn't that define equality?
The world is setup for us to fight against each other, it's always been that way.

I am no better than her, nor is she better than he, but that rule has been buried in this world of lies.

How long will it take before the world clues in?
How many lives will be taken?

Pollution, power and money is more important than safety, health and freedom.
Sounds bazar but that's the world we live in.
It comes across a lot more powerfully, when you read the words yourself.
We are so far gone that there is no chance of recovery.
Unless everyone works together.
