Trying to avoid an inevitable fate, I am getting caught in the moment.
I've put so much time into my dreams. There is no giving up.

There are many things that I could be doing, that are much worse than this.
I know I won't be a future millionaire.
But I do know I'll never be a quitter.

Every emotion I've ever felt has now been set in stone.
The stone of music. The sounds will speak my tears.
The sound will speak my smiles, my anger and my fears.
I've hit rock bottom and I've felt on top of the world,
I am the man I am today because of that.

Because the ignorance in this world is abounding,
I strive to become aware.
I try to stand out.
I try to be different.

Trying to be a the best me that I possibly can,
I always am trying to better myself.

Focus on what means most.
There is no point in having a plan b because it distracts from plan a.

Because the ignorance in this world is abounding,
I strive to become aware.
I try to stand out.
I try to be different.

I've hit rock bottom and I've felt on top of the world,
But, I've overcome my inner demons and that's all that "Matt"ers
