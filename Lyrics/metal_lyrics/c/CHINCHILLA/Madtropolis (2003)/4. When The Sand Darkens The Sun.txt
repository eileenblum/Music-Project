Did you see the firmament
The heaven is on fire
The devil laughs, knowing it's achieved
All the good is gone

In the garment of his mind
He takes them from the world
Now the Evil will arise
And grasps all power on earth

Defenceless angels are falling
From the dark sky in flames
God's tears, they ooze away
Like holy blood in the desert sand

WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE LAST HOUR STRIKES FOR THEM ALL
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE POWER OF THEIR GOLD WILL DIE

Eternal darkness seized the spirit
The hatred banished their thoughts
So blind fury rages all over
The yell raised the holy force

An eye for an eye, ashes to ashes
The evil sermon guards all over
So he sows hatred and force
And father death is set to work

Crosses stand towards heaven
And the sea is crimson red
The last flood rinses the human kind
And their golden palaces away

WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE LAST HOUR STRIKES FOR THEM ALL
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE POWER OF THEIR GOLD WILL DIE
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
BLOOD WILL FLOW AND WE WILL DIE
WHEN THE SAND DARKENS THE SUN
THE LAST HOUR STRIKES FOR THEM ALL
