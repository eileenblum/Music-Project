High up in the mountains
An old man used to live
He prophesied the future
Long before it had occurred

He told them their end
And he told them their future
But nobody gave a damn
They just called him a fool

Under the sign of the cross
He fulfilled their eager wishes
Greedy like hungry wolves
They never saw the end

STEP IN TO
THE WORLD OF DANGER
BESIDE THE GOOD
WE ALL NOW
TURN AROUND
THE MAGIC TABLE
NOTHING WILL BE
AS IT WAS BEFORE

The humans being blinded
By his own damned desires
Being better than the others
Not second best

As he then was gone
They had all lost their minds
They fought each other, brother killing brother
His laughter sounded through the land

STEP IN TO
THE WORLD OF DANGER
BESIDE THE GOOD
WE ALL NOW
TURN AROUND
THE MAGIC TABLE
AND NOTHING WILL BE
AS IT WAS BEFORE
