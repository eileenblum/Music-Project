Oh, the sun will never shine again
Since the days of the last war
The survivors searching for the light
To create the mankind anew

Do you see the light of the dark side
So cry out to the evil legions one
So they kneel and behold their new king

They believe he's their prophesied Saviour
They believe

HE'S THE MASTER, HE'S THE KING, THE NEW WORLD HAS JUST BEGUN
BETTER FOLLOW HIS RULES OF THE DARK SIDE
HE'S THE MASTER, HE'S THE KING, THE NEW WORLD HAS JUST BEGUN
WITH HIS GOLD HE BLINDS THEIR STUPID MINDS

Now he keeps them safe and warm
There's a mysterious hidden danger to tell
He brings them misery and pain

'Cause they`re all blinded by their dreams

Now his evil work is done
'Cause his reign has just begun
He's the one and only maker

He's their prophesied Saviour
They believe

HE'S THE MASTER, HE'S THE KING, THE NEW WORLD HAS JUST BEGUN
BETTER FOLLOW HIS RULES OF THE DARK SIDE
HE'S THE MASTER, HE'S THE KING, THE NEW WORLD HAS JUST BEGUN
WITH HIS GOLD HE BLINDS THEIR STUPID MINDS
HE'S THE MASTER, HE'S THE KING, THE NEW WORLD HAS JUST BEGUN
BETTER FOLLOW HIS RULES OF THE DARK SIDE
HE'S THE MASTER, HE'S THE KING, THE NEW WORLD HAS JUST BEGUN
AND THERE'S NEITHER HOPE NOR FAITH FOR NO-ONE THERE
