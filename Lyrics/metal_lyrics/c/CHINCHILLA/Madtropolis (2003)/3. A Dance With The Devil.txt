Every now and then he comes down to the earth
To blind and twist the people's stupid brains
Pouring the foolish people sand into their eyes
Grabbing the clever ones by their sharp mind

Oh well, playing games, is his real true pleasure
So the stakes are very high, his loss never is
Craving for the power, like the devil for a soul
They're chasing after luck, no matter what will be
Oh God, what has been done?

A DANCE WITH THE DEVIL
THE QUICK SUCCESS NEARLY IN SIGHT
BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
NO-ONE WILL EVER SURVIVE
A DANCE WITH THE DEVIL
CONSTANT CRAVING OF THE HUMAN KIND
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
YOU CAN'T WIN THE FIGHT

No need to convince, decision's up to them
Peace of mind is the price they have to pay
Ending up at hell's gate, now it's up to us to see
Looking for a way out, we're the ones to blame
Oh, God please set us free

A DANCE WITH THE DEVIL
THE QUICK SUCCESS NEARLY IN SIGHT
BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
NO-ONE WILL EVER SURVIVE
A DANCE WITH THE DEVIL
CONSTANT CRAVING OF THE HUMAN KIND
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
YOU CAN'T WIN THE FIGHT
