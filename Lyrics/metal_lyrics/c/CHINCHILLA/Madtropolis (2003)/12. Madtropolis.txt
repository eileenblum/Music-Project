There was once a city that one called the future here on earth
The elite human beings, assembled and played god in their town
Weaknesses and virtues got connected, for their stupid aim
Only their holy victory and the elite was on their glorious minds

In this world of technology, machines dictate the flow of time
There is no personality, human values waiting in line
There is no communication, 'cause there's a gap between them all
Lost in a state of destruction, no matter where they go

THERE IS MADTROPOLIS
THEY'RE GOING ALL INSANE
TO LIVE IN THIS BLOODY HELL
THAT'S NOT THEIR GLORIOUS AIM
THERE IS MADTROPOLIS
THE EVIL GHOST IS ON THE TOP
THE FIRE OF ILLUMINATION
FALLING FROM THE BURNING SKY

Staring like headless zombies, without any emotion for their lives
They are all recruited, unable to think in different lines
So their leaders have failed, but they are blind and they will follow them
To spill their blood and their sick thoughts over the whole world

THERE IS MADTROPOLIS
THEY'RE GOING ALL INSANE
TO LIVE IN THIS BLOODY HELL
THAT'S NOT THEIR GLORIOUS AIM
THERE IS MADTROPOLIS
THE EVIL GHOST IS ON THE TOP
THE FIRE OF ILLUMINATION
FALLING FROM THE BURNING SKY
