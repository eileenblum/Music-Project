After all these years I was ready to open my heart
I thought we were so close, but now we are miles apart
I know, nothing is for granted with the things called love
Sometimes it hurts so much, is it really a gift from above?

I'm not so sure, sometimes it's hard to understand
It only seems obscure

And now you don't pay any attention to any word I say
And all the colours around me are fading into grey
Maybe I was too sure, but it's still hard to understand
It seems so obscure

Sometimes I feel like a satellite - alone on my way
Sometimes I feel like a satellite - in outer space with an aching heart
Sometimes I feel like a satellite - I've got nothing more to say
Sometimes I feel like a satellite - somewhere out in the dark

You wrote me letters in which you've tried to explain
But I'm sorry the feeling that remains is still only the pain
You want me to be your friend, but I don't know if I'm able to
For the moment it seems too hard, because I still feel too much for you

I don't know, maybe there will come a time, But for now

Is there anybody out there - maybe just another satellite
Is there anybody out there - who leads me through the darkest night
Is there anybody out there - who deserves to heal my broken heart
Is there anybody out there - I can put my trust in right from the start
