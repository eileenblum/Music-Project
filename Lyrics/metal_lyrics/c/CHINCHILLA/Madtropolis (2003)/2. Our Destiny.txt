We all stand together, we fight
Is that all sense of our lives
The rich are sitting, quite far above
And we are left to blood

Even the poorest of the poorest I know
They strip them down to the last shirt
Only dollars in front of their eyes
Till everything breaks down

Oh God, that's our future
Oh God, there's no way out

FIGHTING, DESPAIRING, WE NEVER RESIGN FROM OUR DESTINY
FIGHTING, DESPAIRING, WE FIGHT TILL THE TIME WE ARE FREE

Any music that they get into
We have to face again
We are the victim of their greed
While they waste everything

Oh God, there's a way out
Oh God, that's our future

FIGHTING, DESPAIRING, WE NEVER RESIGN FROM OUR DESTINY
FIGHTING, DESPAIRING, WE FIGHT TILL THE TIME WE ARE FREE
FIGHTING, DESPAIRING, WE NEVER RESIGN FROM OUR DESTINY
FIGHTING, DESPAIRING, SO OUR HOPE AND OUR HONOUR WILL NEVER DIE
