I don`t know where I run to
I only know that you run from me
I don`t know where to turn to
I always thought that you belonged to me
I saw your face in every marvelous cloud
I hear your voice in every lovely sound
I feel your touch it`s so heavenly
My heart starts beating for my lonely
Destiny, destiny
You broke my heart into pieces
Since the time you`ve walked away
I hope I`ll never get these feelings
For you and me Oh, itÂ´s only a dream
It seems to be the end of it all
The lovely dreams for you and me are cold
No place for hearted heat, thereÂ´s a wall
My perfekt world destroyed,
Oh god I`m falling, Oh god I`m falling
