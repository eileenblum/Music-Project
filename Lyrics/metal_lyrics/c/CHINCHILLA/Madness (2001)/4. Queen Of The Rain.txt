Love was a shame
It was a very bad time
Feel the darkness
Treating my heart and my mind
Damned and lonely
Rest in peace
Lost myself
For her chicane
She's the mistress of my heart
Pain and fire
Queen of the rain, time is by my side
Queen of the rain, no more tears for her lies
Gambling and pleading
For her stupid laws
There is no future
For her and me with love
Break the chains
I'm free
The bad ghost is leaving
I can see
No more terror
No more pain
Leave this place
