In the land with no hope and no future
Lived a girl without hair
She's the child of the nuclear blackout
After war she was born
No chance, no hope, no livin'
In this desperate world
Just pain and tears and fire
For the girl without hair
Tears, theyÂ´re only tears
There' s nothing to live
And nothing to love
It's death
For the girl without hope and future
There is no other way
She lost, she's alone on this planet,
Â´til the darkness embraces her
