They broke your bones
They stole your love
They treat you like a dog
Your hopes are gone
The english army won the
War cause Scotland were betrayed
Your souls are damned,
Your lifeÂ´s at an end
The priest has evil horns
Pain and burning fire
Dreams that never end
Fight for your rights
You will never die
Freedom was there aim they lost
Scotland will defend
Rights and laws are out of order
The killing never ends
Their work is done
Your lifes are gone
The land will suck your holy blood
The warriors arenÂ´t forgotten
Thoughts of freedom paid
With sorrows Â´cos Scotland will exist
The spirits for their glory aims
Are defended with their fists
