Black eyes
BIue eyes
Morning face the truth
Don't turn
Out the light
I have lost my mind
I give
You take
This life I have begun
Sweet kiss
Hot kiss
You're the girl I used to love
Love keeps coming, like warriors will die
Playing with our years, one minute Disappears
Waiting for you... waiting for you...
Waiting for your last call
Ride between dark and light
Ride between dark and light
Decry me
Deny me
Running to you tonight
Bad lies
Heart cries
Let me see inside
No time
No crime
These things pull me down
Sweet kiss
Hot kiss
You're the girl I used to love
