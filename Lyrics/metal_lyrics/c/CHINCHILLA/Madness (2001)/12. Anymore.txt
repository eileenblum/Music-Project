With only one word
They told me you were gone
See the blood on my skin see
The hole in my heart
I have tried to reach out
For a helping hand
Hear the warning these nights
One time again she`s gone
Can these feelings
Be so wrong or right
The end of love is far away
When I wake up
In the morning Iight
I donÂ´t cry out your name anymore
I spit on the mirror
This ugly face I see
Down in black abyss
A morbid jealousy
Perhaps in the future
Begins a human race
Without nuclear power
For men to replace
