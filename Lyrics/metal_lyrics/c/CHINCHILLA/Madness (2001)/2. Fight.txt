Is this the end of our hopes and our dreams
Be paid by the richman`s world for modern slavery
The order they pray is to Ioose all human ethnic kinds
The devil Iaughs about these fools and their foolish mind
Deep in my heart there is a burning desire
For liberty and peace for all human kind
Give freedom a place in this
World without silly treason
Fight for our rights and we are forever free
Without their order and their money policy
The human natures stand together hand in hand
What a dream, for liberty and peace in our lands
The people listen to wrong preachers and their prophecies
They blind your eyes and steal your dreams for their stupid
Policy lt`s not important if you`re really black or white
Because the human nature isnÂ´t based on coloured kind
Deep in my heart there is a burning desire
For liberty and peace for all human kind
Give freedom a place in this
World without silly treason
Fight for our rights and we are forever free
Without their order and their money policy
The human natures stand together hand in hand
What a dream, for liberty and peace in our lands
