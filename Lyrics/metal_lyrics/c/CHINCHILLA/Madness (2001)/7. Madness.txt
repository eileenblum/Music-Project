Oh, look at our history
It always stays the same
The people called their leaders
To follow stupid games
Wrong heroes standing on the top
To blind your eyes with war
Manipulation since all times
Is washing out your brain
Fight for yourself and you're
Free
Madness is their god
Of the future and their war
Blood and death are religions
Oh god, forgive these crazy leaders
Madness is their god
Of the future and their war
Blood and death are religions
You're now only a number
Recruited in their lines
Without any feelings
You will lose, in time
You hope god will forgive you
Your wrong way of live
The love and hope you leave behind
Â´cos of this hate, blood and crime
Fight for yourself and you're Free
