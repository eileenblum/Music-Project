I'm not a dreamer
the time of trust is over
I'm not a dreamer
the smell of feeling blows away
I'm not a fighter
you make the rules I played the part
I'm not a fighter
your evil work destroyed my heart
go away all your toys surround you
it's so absurd
I can't stop to rock
I could not stop
running away
from your side
your the evil
of my mind
king for a day
king for a day
I'm on my knees
like a dog on a chain
stand up for myself
or I'll never be a man
smoke blows away and I wake up
it's so absurd
I can't stop to rock
I could not stop
running away
from your side
you're the evil
of my mind
king for a day
king for a day
