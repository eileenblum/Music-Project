born to spell
the words of our love
seekers of reasons, reaper of time
take me away, take me away
I wanna know what's
wrong or right
to claim a mountain
which is higher than you thought
it's worth a try
you will never ever forget
how the feeling is
of a dream you dreamed at night
lay your hand on me and pray that it's allright
we want to dance like a child
we should remember how it
was to dance like the children dance
when I awoke
lying on the beach
tears are falling down like ice in the heat
never forever remember the pain
remember how it started and how we'll find an end
we want to dance like a child
we should remember how it
was to dance like the children dance
