in a land, where the love has died
a girl is waiting for a better time
she's innocent, oh just still a child
corpses paved her way
in search of herself can not describe her pain
she has no hope, she wants to be in another world
the scorching wind blows over the land
where the soul of the brave may rest in peace
before her eyes
before her eyes
lost and lonely no power to survive
blood wet swords before her eyes
cursed and damned scream the power
of what happened, in this final hour
the scorching wind blows over the land
where the soul of the brave may rest in peace
help, somebody help me
somebody help me
somebody help me
help, somebody help me
somebody help me
somebody help me
now in the land of the Sabbath stone
like a curse on her soul
throw it to heaven, hard like iron
she can't stop crying
the scorching wind blows over the land
where the soul of the brave may rest in peace
see the god, god is falling
nowhere she can hide
help, somebody help me
