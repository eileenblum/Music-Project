what do you think we should believe
when preachers tell lies
in my hour of need
ha you are not there
daydreamer, I wish that you wouldn't have to tell me lies
we are the one and only, we're the truth
we are the holy angels of war
set the world on fire if we don't know
the easiest way to grab your soul
daydreamer, I wish that you wouldn't have to tell me lies
we are the reborn of god
we are the holiest in place
we are the reborn of god
prepare to follow me
in times before times
they never would have died
a passion of pain
fill poison in vain
daydreamer, I wish that you wouldn't have to tell me lies
we are the one and only, we're the truth
we are the holy angels and knew
if I could feed you with lies
speak the words of love in your sleep
daydreamer, I wish that you wouldn't have to tell me lies
we are the reborn of god
we are the holiest in place
we are the reborn of god
prepare to follow me
