any time you're searching for a friend
there is no-one there
take a look behind your back
and realize that its just a dream
the darkness came closer to you when you
promised me lies
we're walking under the same sun
when moonlight shows the time
looking for memories shows the time
far beyond your wildest crime
walking down the streets in the rain
there are no lights to show you the way
and the houses began to stare
they seemed to be alive
the soul of water is back
there is not the slightest chance to escape
we're walking under the same sun
when moonlight shows the time
looking for memories I believe
far beyond your wildest crime
with broken wings
we keep searching for what we love
changing friends
kick my ass, and you can't come back
with broken wings
sudden sorrow
changing friends
will break by the lies of tomorrow
