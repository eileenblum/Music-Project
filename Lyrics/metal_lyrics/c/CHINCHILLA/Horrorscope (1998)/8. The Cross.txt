red river flows down the skin of his face
step by step he's walking through the mist life ordains
died by the hand of men who preach in the name of god
silver moonlight shines on the eyes of emptiness
see the signs written on the wall
see the signs
standing on the hill of blame, warm summer rain falls down
he always knew that he would die at the hand of fools
the grief in his soul hurts hard more than his wounded flesh
see the cross burn with the light of hell that
shines on the land of hate
see the signs written on the wall
see the signs
see the cross white crosses
there follow days without a light
see the cross
they burn them down tonight
see the cross white crosses
if you believe, it's not a lie
see the cross
until they stabbed him to death
