in the name of the man
the glory, the saint
the truth of war metal, blood and pain
passion and warfare
battle of lies
the best man kills children and wives
the hail in our eyes
the hail in our soul
we will fight back one time again
I wanna be a member of the who is who
tell me, will there ever be the truth
I wanna be a member of the who is who
searching for the meaning of my life
I see the blood on his mind
see the blood on his hand
in the hall of fame he survives
the smell in my mouth
of blood and sand
physical fire, burning in my brain
the hail in our eyes
the hail in our soul
my love is when the enemy dies
I wanna be a member of the who is who
tell me, will there ever be the truth
I wanna be a member of the who is who
searching for the meaning of my life
