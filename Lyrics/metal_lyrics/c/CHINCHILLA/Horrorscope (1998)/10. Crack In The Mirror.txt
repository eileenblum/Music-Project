when the last work is spoken
when the last dream is gone
when the last soul flies away
holding candles to the sun
she said no, with a laugh in her eyes
scoff for your love and we all know why
you've got a drawn for her coquetry
smoother memory's
illusion of passion
this dangerous game you play
prophecy, destiny
lost in a mass of violence
crack in the mirror
how can we help you
crack in the mirror
and let the bad come true
crack in the mirror
how can we help you
just a black mark in your book of life
make your things, you are losing your mind
you've got the right place
you've got the will
this is the right time
to give her the thrill
crack in the mirror
how can we help you
crack in the mirror
and let the bad come true
crack in the mirror
how can we help you
