eyes of pain
each other's out again
we will show
you will cross the pain
and I know
I don't have to search for more
eyes of pain
and again
I've been knocking on your bedroom door
trying to grab out your soul
I've been trying to hold you close
and I'm screaming out for more
here we are in heaven or hell
let us go, to come home
here we are in heaven or hell
dream in the evil arms
like the fear
the dark behind your mind
in your eyes
gathering thoughts of a part
eyes of pain
and again
I've been knocking on your bedroom door
trying to grab out your soul
I've been trying to hold you close
and I've screaming out for more
here we are in heaven or hell
let us go, to come home
here we are in heaven or hell
dream in the evil arms
