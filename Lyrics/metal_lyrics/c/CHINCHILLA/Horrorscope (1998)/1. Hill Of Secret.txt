I see demons with red glowing eyes
doors I've never seen before
their coming up the stairs out of hell
beyond the iron wall
sell me your soul and be my slave
whispers in my ears
in the moonlight shadow dance
black birds spread their wings
now here I am
coming to you and
offer my soul
standing on the hill of secrets
listening to the voice in me
calling evil is so easy
now the master speaks to me
welcome my son I'm watching you
trembling and hoping for my favor
it's a one way ticket to hell
trapped in fire and pain
now here I am
coming to you and
offer my soul
standing on the hill of secrets
listen to the voice in me
calling evil is so easy
now the master speaks to me
