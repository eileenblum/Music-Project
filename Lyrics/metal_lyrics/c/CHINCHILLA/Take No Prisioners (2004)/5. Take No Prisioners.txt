Tales our parents told, We place in our hearts
Over our history 'n our bloody sacrifice past
Cause we never forget your terror n'crimes
Now this is the place, it's your payback time

Every new day our faith is growing up
The evil raging force will take now control
The calm is gone the tempest has begun
Chaos all aroud, the almighty destruction will come

Take no prisioners
Stand all together then we never die
Take no prisioners
In the name of God and against their crimes
Take no prisioners
So we all must kill this fucking bunch of hounds
Take no prisioners, Take no prisioners

The blind stupid belief, makes our minds mad
The angel of death took us to the slaughter
My brothers are killed, they will never come back
And again in wrong believe, we march for the battle

Take no prisioners
Stand all together if we want to survive
Take no prisioners
In the name of God and our always coming hate
Take no prisioners
So it starts all again, kill this fucking bunch of hounds
Take no prisioners, Take no prisioners
