Pounding voices in my head
I think I'm going mad
Now my evil dreams have come true
I don't know what is bad
Oh those voices they talk to me
But the words are very strange
I now think there's no way out
It starts to drive me insane

I'm the perverse end birth of all dreams and fantasies
The sick part that nobody loves is the biggest part of me
I walk hand in hand with death
With an abused confused mind
Because I am the chosen one to finish his work with pain

I'm the ripper, the angel of death
The brutalenforcer of all divine laws
With a mystic voice in my head
I'm the ripper, the bringer of death
So you better never meet me
Because then you'll take your final breath

Flesh and blood all over my hands
This satisfies my soul
Surrender to my dark desire pretending I am free
I walk hand in hand with God
Whose protection makes me strong
Because I am the chosen one and I'll never fail

I'm the ripper, the angel of death
The brutalenforcer of all divine laws
With a mystic voice in my head
I'm the ripper, the bringer of death
So you better never meet me
Because then you'll take your final breath

His work with pain
His work with pain

I'm the ripper, the angel of death
The brutalenforcer of all divine laws
With a mystic voice in my head
I'm the ripper, the bringer of death
So you better never meet me
Because then you'll take your final breath
