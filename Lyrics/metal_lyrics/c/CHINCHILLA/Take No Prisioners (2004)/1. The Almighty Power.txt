We are the remnants from a gold distorted society
The ones who feed of the scraps from the greedy
They crushed and brought us the shadow of our past lives
So now our shabby beings barely manage to exist

Like the cog wheels of the eternal damned watch,
We turn and see their power growing more and more
We all lived on our knees only to then stand up and die in our boots
Their standars are the evil laws imposed on the working class!

We are the almighty power
Which creates the miracle
Stand together and we fight
We are the almighty power
Let us fight for good and the rights of human kind
We are the almighty power
Like Judas, they betray us for a fisstfull of silver
We are the almighty power
This is the new world order of their impossed slavery

We the enslaved are defenceless waiting for our time to revolt
Cause we are the victims of their slaughter
Their economic war is now global and has us on the run
The destruction of all other cultures is what they're looking for!

We are the almighty power
Which creates the miracle
Stand together and we fight
We are the almighty power
Let us fight for good and the rights of human kind
We are the almighty power
Like Judas, they betray us for a fisstfull of silver
We are the almighty power
This is the new world order of their impossed slavery
