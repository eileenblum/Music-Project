Eye for an eye, that's the way my dad told me
To fight, to live, or to die
After many wars, our hatred
Our suffering and our pain remain with us forever
Now is the time for me to accept
That my rules are no longer correct anymore

Death has no face, has no name and no plan
It's timeless like travelling through time
Mountains of cash, winning seconds for more life
But still he will come and reap
Who is the bad man, the one with the gun?
Or is it the one who always look away?

Silent are the moments I need
Why were we forced to bleed?
Past memories cause all my pain
Silent are the moments I need
To process so many years
To dry these heavy tears

In times of ups and downs I have searched
High and low in this world for some help
Try'n to understand, why a friend can have many sights
Is willed to kill, willed to love, willed to die
Love is the word bringing power and fear
For my kids to survive and to grow without tears

Silent are the moments I need
Why were we forced to bleed?
Past memories cause all my pain
Silent are the moments I need
To process so many years
To dry these heavy tears

Silent are the moments I need
Now feeling the peace insight
To see light through darkened eyes
Silent are the moments I need
To resolve the unanswered lies
To end up with a clear mind
