We are all living on with a ticking timebomb
Only the poor aren't blinded by greed
All your enemies pretend to be your best friend
Invading foreign territories, destroying their soul

Oh, brother killing brother suits their evil plans
To bring the entire world under their control
They will do anything for their shiney green money
They don't care that the innocent mothers have been killed

Blinded and enchanted, they're loosing all control
Greedy lik hungry wolves
They're killing in good with faith
Blinded and enchanted, they're loosing all control
They are destroying the whole world
With corruption and crimes

The nations of the world are seeking their freedom
Because we are supposed to live without hate and crime
But our leaders are dazzled by these liars
Bringing death to the world for a dollar and a dime

Living united with all different cultures
Is the foundation that we bild our future on
We don't care for their money, thinking they are funny
God never voted for a president and that is fucking fine

Blinded and enchanted, they're loosing all control
Greedy lik hungry wolves
They're killing in good with faith
Blinded and enchanted, they're loosing all control
They are destroying the whole world
With corruption and crimes
