I'm sitting in my room, I am alone
It's so dark and cold
I think that I've lost my mind
Depression is creeping over my soul
All that I had; I have lost; All my own fault

Every new day, I hope that I will survive
To stand up and to fight for a new'n better life
Don't want to live in my own damn past
Because it's a new day 'n' game
It's a new fucking start

Now a spark of hope lights up my injured mind
The hope that I need for my stillborn soul
Now I only need a piece of good fortune
Positive and fine with a happy smile on my face

But when I'm standing, I'm feel fine
I get the next heavy push
Cause everything will break my mind
I think I'm a loser, that's right
Drunken n'rotten, to die somewhere in a dark backwater

Every new day I hope to survive
To find a better way, to be a man in life
My luck is waiting round the next corner
Just need to find myself and my new mind

Now a spark of hope lights up my injured mind
The hope that I need for my stillborn soul
Now I only need a piece of good fortune
Positive and fine with a happy smile on my face
