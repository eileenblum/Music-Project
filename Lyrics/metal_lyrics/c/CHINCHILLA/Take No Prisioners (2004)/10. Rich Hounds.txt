Living a life by the rules of the society
Being blinded all these years by their damn lies
Everyone of us has lost our fucking minds
For their silver 'n gold we learnt to stand in line

But now it's the time to take it from the rich
And give it back to the people
Because they worked hard for it
They do everything because that's their only chance to live
But the rich see them as slaves for their stupid headless greed

The best thing in life is to steal it from rich
And give it back to the poor
Because their life it's a bitch
A heart that is in the right place should not be blind
Because rich hounds have a place in hell
Reserved for their damned mind

But now I think there is no shame in doing right
Because everyone of us has got the right to fight
We've never stolen but only taken back from the rich
Because they are working to make us society's bitch

The best thing in life is to steal it from rich
And give it back to the poor
Because their life it's a bitch
A heart that is in the right place should not be blind
Because rich hounds have a place in hell
Reserved for their damned mind
