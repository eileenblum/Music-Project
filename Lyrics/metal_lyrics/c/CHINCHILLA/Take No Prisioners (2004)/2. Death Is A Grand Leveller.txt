It's a dark and ghostly night
I feel there isn't something right
And death is cruising through the streets to fight
War and plague are on his side
His friends do their jobs like every time
Because they made rich booty
Like they've often done before

They are greedy bastards
The human race is on the run
Nobody will escape
They kill for fun
They are brillant murderers
They're killing under human licence
They're the kiss of death
And they will take our soul

So death is the grand leveller
And nobody can escape
Because we believe in fairytales
But now it's too late
So death is the grand leveller
And nobody can escape
We don't need to save our money
Because we are gambling with our souls

We don't need blind beliefs
Don't need any super stars
Everything seems pointless
When you take your final breath
There are no differencies
Between rich, poor, black or white
Because we're all the same on judgement's day

We are blind believers
Holy money rules our world
We can't take our gold to the grave with us
We are false believers
Following like stupid sheep
Because the real wealth lives in our pounding souls

So death is the grand leveller
And nobody can escape
Because we believe in fairytales
But now it's too late
So death is the grand leveller
And nobody can escape
We don't need to save our money
Because we are gambling with our souls
