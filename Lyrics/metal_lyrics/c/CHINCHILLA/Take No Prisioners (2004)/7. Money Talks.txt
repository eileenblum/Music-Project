The game I play now, is the only way out
For your small, pompous, silly, stupid brain
The values you learned from your parents are wrong
Live's mazes are created for you - my friend

Take my hand, I'll show you the right way out
There is only onelight, through this deep white fog
Feel the truth in these words
It's the way money talks

Of all the ideas you have learned so far
Forget those lies bringing us to war
Elections are nice while the puppets keep smiling
Like monkeys look happy when feeding has started

Take my hand, I'll show you the right way out
There is only onelight, through this deep white fog
Feel the truth in these words
It's the way money talks

Now you have too many decisions to make
How will you decide what to do?
You walk in a circle with no destination
Insanity begins to take over your soul

Take my hand, I'll show you the right way out
There is only onelight, through this silent sound
Feel the truth in these words
It's the way money talks

Be one of thousands or be one of us
Who controls these souls
The only bible and the only belief,
Is money talks... bullshit walks!
