Nightwing has stored
Dark silence yields to the night
The hordes of evil are killing side by side
Evil is their nature
But their actions are controlled
At night their shinning eyes
Shows their brutal crimes

The prophecy of the future will be fullfilled
When death calls your name
You will never survive
Satan laughts
He will take your burning soul
Can you feel the the heart of the flames getting higher?

No place to hide
They kill for their king
The fear of evil returning at night again
The slaughter continues
They kill to harvest human souls
Evil is the master of this battle and our downfall

The prophecy of the future will be fullfilled
When death calls your name
You will never survive
Satan laughts
He will take your burning soul
Can you feel the the heart of the flames getting higher and higher
