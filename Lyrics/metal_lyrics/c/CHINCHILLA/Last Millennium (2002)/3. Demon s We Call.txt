An old man has told us he will see our future
WeÂ´ve lost our time for stupid policy

The nature is the rule, not money is the future
The mas leaders lying the fools telling the truth

Oh no, the nations of this planet are leaded by a secret society
And working in the name of the madmanÂ´s sign
Oh no, the gun on our head

The demons we call
They never leave the hall
With thirteen holy wise men
They never lost a war
The demons we call
They never leave the hall
The thirteen glorious judges
Are the leaders of the world

Behind higher walls there are sitting thirteen liars
TheyÂ´re blinding  mind and steal us the truth

To fight against those spirit they tell us "YouÂ´re a liar"
No one had seen them or listened to those ghosts

Oh no, the nations of this planet are leaded by a secret society
And working in the name of the madmanÂ´s sign
Oh no, No place and no time to run

The demons we call
They never leave the hall
With thirteen holy wise men
They never lost a war
The demons we call
They never leave the hall
The thirteen glorious judges
Are the leaders of the world
