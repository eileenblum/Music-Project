When the night raises the power all over the earth
The coldest atmosphere, the whole world invaded
This would be the last time and the last place
Where (the) human kind lost their big holy war

The acid rain is falling from the darkened and hidden sky
The second ice age was declared after their war
There are only a hand full of humans surviving
The last creatures which never rule on these earth

After the War
After the War, there would be no chance
After the War
After the War, the call of nature returns
After the War
After the War, the time stands still forever
After the War
After the War, the call of nature returns

But all was a vain, they disregarded all the warnings
Eager (as) they glorify their silver and gold
Long before their time has come, prophets foretold them
Their fate of what theyÂ´ve read in the book of prophecies

Blinded by greed they polluted their living space
And one day they let call their nuclear force
In a few seconds they destroyed all what the nature has made
Returning to the point where they started before

After the War
After the War, there would be no chance
After the War
After the War, the call of nature returns
After the War
After the War, the time stands still forever
After the War
After the War, the call of nature returns
