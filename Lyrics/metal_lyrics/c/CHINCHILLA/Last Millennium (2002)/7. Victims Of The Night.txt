In the deepest darkest and loneliest night the death looked into my eyes
He told me that my time has come to say goodbye, my life is gone

I asked him for a new chance to play with my cards
To make all well in my life what IÂ´ve never done

The death he has laughed and took his precious time
To play a match for my own head what a exciting affair

So I prayed inside of me heart to the devil and promised him my soul
For a little bit more and better lifetime and the devil began to sign

Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your chance
The winner takes your life tonight
Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your time
To start again with lucky hands
Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your chance
But youÂ´ll pay with your soul tonight
Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your time
To the evil journey of no return

I picked up my evil and bewitched card and shuffled for my life so far
I took a look inside my hand, I couldnÂ´t believe, a Royal Flash

The death closed angry his rage glowing eyes
He had lost against this stupid and dull dude

Angry and wounded he left immediately the hall
To kill some helpless flies, they are his victims at that night

I lived my life now all so well (I) didnÂ´t heard warnings and callings
The devil proposed me to play for my life and he began to sing

Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your chance
The winner takes your life tonight
Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your time
To start again with lucky hands
Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your chance
But youÂ´ll pay with your soul tonight
Lay down your cards, ItÂ´ll be your time
To the evil journey of no return
