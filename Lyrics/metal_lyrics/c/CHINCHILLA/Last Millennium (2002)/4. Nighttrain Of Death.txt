Warmaniacs are on the run
Destroying countries with their guns
ChildrenÂ´s eyes fulfilled with fear
Cause war sirens howlinÂ´ for death
TheyÂ´re murdering women
Innocent children raped by them
Lifeless bodies are on the ground
And heÂ´s wet with their blood

ItÂ´s a shame
To be a part of that human game

Heaven
Show me the way to heaven
Where peace exists
Heaven
Cause the night train of Death
I rolling on earth

ItÂ´s time to stop on this planet
The worlds arms race
There is no enemy
And no new force to fight against
As long as thousands of people
Are killed every year
There will be no place for hope
All over the world

ItÂ´s a shame
To be a part of that human game

Heaven
Show me the way to heaven
Where peace exists
Heaven
Cause the night train of Death
I rolling on earth
