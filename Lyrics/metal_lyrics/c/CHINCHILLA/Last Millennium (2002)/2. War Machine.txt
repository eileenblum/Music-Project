IÂ´m listening to the latest news, I canÂ´t believe itÂ´s true
The spokesman told and it will be, they fight for holy war

15 minutes time to go or for their last show
This would be the end of all. The devilÂ´s leave the hall

The stars will fall from the sky. The sun will never rise
The deepest night will reach the throne after rockets proclaim the war

The preachers told it years before, the generals blinding the masses
Their hail their bombs and their saints, the nuclear power thatÂ´s their force

Holy evil fighting force

The war machine is coming
For their power and glory
This should be the right time
And the place, where it will be
The war machine is coming
For their money and blood
Cause peace is now falling
And death ruled on earth like God

I saw them clean this planet now with fire and their force
To create their holy human kind only under their control

I woke up in a panic dread thank god, it was a dream
Cold sweat is running down my neck. The TV spokesman tells about

The first nuclear attack

The war machine is coming
For their power and glory
This should be the right time
And the place, where it will be
The war machine is coming
For their money and blood
Cause peace is now falling
And death ruled on earth like God
