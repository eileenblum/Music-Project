DonÂ´t make no more an effigy of me (and) finally abolish this golden temples
DonÂ´t let you blinding from that splendor and understanding me more or less wrong

Split a piece of wood and I will be there
Or pick up a stone and you will find me
All whatÂ´s around you that is me
Not imprisoned by wealth and splendor

CanÂ´t you see the blind manÂ´s painting
CanÂ´t you hear the deaf manÂ´s singing

They are liars
You pay for your trust, for this wrong game in that world
They are liars
Himself the devil laughs, they did create his falseness
They are liars
Trapped by their gold and their splendor, so they pass me blind
They are liars
For the wealth and their force, they turned my GodÂ´s world around

So I can only be in you kind heart
CanÂ´t exist if you donÂ´t believe in me
Only that faith comes all from you (and) didnÂ´t need the glory and church power

WhatÂ´s all these suffer and that splendor
They need just to resist about all these seductions
(The) wrong faithÂ´s twisting your deranged brain
And now youÂ´re passing me yet blind

CanÂ´t you see the blind manÂ´s painting
CanÂ´t you hear the deaf manÂ´s singing

They are liars
You pay for your trust, for this wrong game in that world
They are liars
Himself the devil laughs, they did create his falseness
They are liars
Trapped by their gold and their splendor, so they pass me blind
They are liars
For the wealth and their force, they turned my GodÂ´s world around
