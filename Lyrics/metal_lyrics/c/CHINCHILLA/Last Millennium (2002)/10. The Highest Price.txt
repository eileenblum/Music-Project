Feeling the darkness inside of my heart
Seeing his red eyes are glowing so cold
He would give me the world
If I always adore him and pay it with my soul

Betting and sucking he killed me at all
Feeling the fire to burn out my heart
He gave me the promise to life ever long
And becoming stronger every day

Since the day it began
I never saw the sun, oh what have I done
I must hunting for blood
IÂ´m just a slave for the judge of dark

IÂ´d paid for all the highest price
For now IÂ´m standing in the fire
My soul is damned, my life never ends
Therefore I have this desire

Grambling and bleeding for a new, better life
Seeing the future with blood on my hands
I hope I will die and never get old for all these lies

Used and consumed IÂ´m standing in fire
Changing the pact, itÂ´s getting higher and higher
But no one will help me for breaking these chains of my lonely destiny

Since the day it began
I never saw the sun, oh what have I done
I must hunting for blood
IÂ´m just a slave for the judge of dark

IÂ´d paid for all the highest price
For now IÂ´m standing in the fire
My soul is damned, my life never ends
Therefore I have this desire
