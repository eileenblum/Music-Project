For all my sins and for all of my lies
I have to pay for my life the highest price
The chief of the dark side is always waiting still
ItÂ´s payback time for me, Oh what a sin

To sell all my friends for my absurd money dreams
To sell the best things I had for my stupid holy deals
To undersign a contract with my own evil
Blood for gold and for silver, not for God

Father forgive me for the stupid things IÂ´ve done
IÂ´m on my way to see the light, IÂ´m always on the run
Father forgive me for the stupid things IÂ´ve done
IÂ´m on my way to see the light, IÂ´m always on the run

I was once recruited to stand in their lines
To kill and steal for them for their mighty greedy lies
Now it is too late for me, my time has yet come
Now I have to pay for the things that IÂ´ve done

For all my sins and for all of my lies
I have to pay for my life the highest price
The chief of the dark side is always waiting still
ItÂ´s payback time for me, Oh what a sin

Father forgive me for the stupid things IÂ´ve done
IÂ´m on my way to see the light, IÂ´m always on the run
Father forgive me for the stupid things IÂ´ve done
IÂ´m on my way to see the light, IÂ´m always on the run

So now IÂ´m standing here, itÂ´s my judgment day
So believe itÂ´s not my fault, They ruled an I recalled
So IÂ´m awake all day, under the dark side of sun
Cause now my soul is burning in the purgatory

Father forgive me for the stupid things IÂ´ve done
IÂ´m on my way to see the light, IÂ´m always on the run
Father forgive me for the stupid things IÂ´ve done
IÂ´m on my way to see the light, IÂ´m always on the run
