[Music: Tore Ostby]
[Lyrics: Dag Ostby]

Time has com, turn around
See another day
You have to find your way
Look behind, see the past
Enormous decay
A gloomy sight in grey

All the years past away
In such misery
Now it's time to be free
People cried, people died
For the anarchy
Their closed eyes could not see

No more oppression
You will fight to be free
Stop the fraud, erode strangers
You live to survive

No regrets are to come
Future is to be
A short straw ends in hell
Utilize what you know
Like a hallowed spell
Decide whare you will dwell

Remember the hard times
No ingratitude
To recede is to lose
No time for probation
No time retreat
Go for the final beat

No more oppression...

End all the fear
Won't face a new disaster
End all the fear
Obtain a place to grow old

[solo]

End all the fear
A winner and creator
End all the fear
You will live to see the light

No more oppression...
