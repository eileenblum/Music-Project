[Music: Tore Ostby]
[Lyrics: Tore Ostby]

Deep in the woods you can hear her
Singing songs so enticing
The prettiest tunes that you've ever heard
Taken you'll follow the way
Where the voices are guiding
Far from the path she's waiting for you

Alone by the mere she is dancing
In the wind her long hair's flicking
She's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen
Obsessed by desire you're blinded
When you're standing right before her
She's looking deep into your eyes as she says

Fall in my arms, let me be yours
I'll give you everything you're dreaming of
Come dance with me, say you'll be mine
We'll be in heaven till the end of time

Seduced you will fall in her arms
Tight you hold her next to you
There's nothing in this world that can stop you now
But suddenly you see reflections
Of her body in the water
Rotten and old with a cow's tail, she has fooled you

Realize she is an evil,
Wicked fairy who has trapped you
Caught in her net so helpless and lost
She's casting a spell on you
And you'll be among her big castle
You are turned into a cow, 'cause you did what she said

Fall in my arms...

[solo]

Still we can hear her
Calling for us
Still she is singing
Her seducing tunes

Fall in my arms...
