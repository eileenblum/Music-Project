[Music: Tore Ostby]
[Lyrics: Tore Ostby/Ingar Amlien]

Through the history we've had
Countless fights and wars
Cultures have passed for no reason why

Among the animals we see
A fight for life and death
Only the strongest will survive

I won't take this for a law of mother nature
I don't belive in a world of violence

We're building a force
Making a false feel of safety
We're building a force
Threatening our basis to be

We're using our technology
To make the greatest bomb
Believe there will still be a future

To the extreme, at the worst
It will lead to ruin
Our civilization will end for good     

I won't take this for a way of living in peace
I don't believe that the weapons secure

We're building a force...

The sun goes down
Darkness falls
Will we ever
See a new day

[solo]

We're building the force... [X2]
