[Music: Tore Ostby]
[Lyrics: Dag Ostby]

Out from the dark
To the freedom
No more retreat
Cancellation

Marching towards
Fiery Landscape
Leaving behind
Smoky waste land

Killing for your rights
Regaining the sanity
Blinded existens
Stigmatizing your own faith
War of hate

See the evil
Reach up for you
Endless seaching
For a new way

Watch them dying
Slowly men fal
Hear the crying
A helpless call

Killing for your rights...

[solo]

I'm gazing at the sky
It's time to wonder why
Our olbiteration
An existed cry
So when I'm thinking back
Before the last attack
Why did we end it all
In a fatal fall

[solo]

Killing for your rights...
