Afraid to stop and catch your breath?
You know I'm right behind you
I guess; some time
You'll have to rest and I'll be there
To push you through
I'm the burden you bear
On your shoulder
The voice in your head;
It's time to surrender

Comprehend; I see your eyes
While you're changing, rearranging
Make believe, islands apart
I'm still there for you
I swear it.

I seek the wounded prey in you
Ways to convey your anger
While you are still in mother's womb I am sublime
In what we share
I'm a wave in the sand
Tracing borders, I'm god in your hands
Each time you remember

Comprehend; I am the sky
Wipe away the silver lining
Make believe
Down never comes
I'm still there for you

I know the will it takes
To cross the bridge from here to never
I've seen a thousand pictures of a dream
I hardly could find
Forever I will keep the memories
For only you to open
Before you lose your mind
Before you lose
Before you lose your mind
It's easy to get lost
In this mad, mad world

[2x]
If I'm hard to find
Stop the world before you're falling of
Try a second time
All I ever knew
I'd tell to you

Comprehend!
Stop the world before you're falling of
Make believe,
All I ever knew, I'd tell to you!

Comprehend! I am the sky
Wipe away the silver lining
Make believe down never comes
I'm still there for you
