[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Here I stand and watch the day
Being born once again
And the skies are deep as sea
Touch me again and I am free

Little child, now take my hand
Little child, make me understand

Let me join the ring of all
Be one with what you are
Let the sun graze a desert I want what is mine
Let me join the ring of fire
Be filled with your desire
To a sunshine that finds our ignorance a bliss, [?]
Only then can I be found

Here I stand and watch the day
Closing in once again
And the shades it hung over me
speak to my heart, call other world

Mother sun is silver shade
and I pray I am not to blame

Let me join the ring of all
Be one with what you are
Let the sun graze a desert I want what is mine
Let me join the ring of fire
Be filled with your desire
To a sunshine that finds our ignorance a bliss, [?]
Only then can I be found

And silence hears sound
Uncover his edge
We dance in the sun
âtil noon dies in ray

Let me join the ring of all
Be one with what you are
Let the sun graze a desert I seek what is mine
Let me join the ring of fire
Be filled with your desire
To a sunshine that finds our ignorance a bliss, [?]

Let me join the ring of all
Be one with what you are
Let the sun graze a desert I want what is mine
Let me join the ring of fire
Be filled with your desire
âtil the salvationâs ray of the morning horizon delete the night
