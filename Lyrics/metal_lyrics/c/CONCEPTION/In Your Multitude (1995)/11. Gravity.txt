[Japanese Bonus Track]When my father said he loved me I believed
When my mother asked âdo you belong?â I said âI doâ
And their kingdom kept me sane
But passion grows where the weak succumb
It's too late when the contradictions nail you down

When the altered mission fails
In your altered mind
When it's all apparent
Masterless you search the files

Got to find the one with my number
Got to strike before the captive falls
Got to find the one with my number
Got to strike, gravity calls

Now my thoughts obey the hatred that I grow
And forevermore the evil seed I want to sow
What could make a man condemn
The crime he was born to defend?
What could make him believe?
The truth made him repent

When the altered mission fails
In your altered mind
When it's all apparent
Masterless you seek your kind

Got to find the one with my number
Got to strike before the captive falls
Got to find the one with my number
Got to strike, gravity calls
