Fame, you'd give an eye for life in sin,
Pain, like a dawn
There's no disguise where light is born
To show the way,

Nothing could make me grand again
I am second for all eternity,
Make me wise and brave
To spend them well, my hours late.

Shame, repellant dark and primal need,
Want some pain
These bloody wounds that never bleed,

Shame, I never meant to disappoint you,
I never meant to fall so deep
But light alone from morning star
Will hush your soul to sleep

Nothing could make me grand again
Under whatever name I am,
Make me long for faith
For love like yours in hours late

Talk, release the strain,
Talk, let's talk about you for a change
I'm getting so sleepy speaking my own mind

Sane, you know is all or nothing now, sane
And nothing could make me grand again
Not in whatever way may you
Make me strong enough
In love and faith the hours late.ï»¿
