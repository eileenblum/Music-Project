May the mark you make
Be somewhere above you
And gain
In wonderful ways
Plain and clean
Clean as nothing you have made
As the starlight starts to fade
Be someone

Fight
Sympethizing mother love
Be strewn with hope
Your way
And whatever may
The story ain't over
Whatever they say
Be set for disclosure
A nouveaux design
Another today
For everyone

What's a ceremony
Loud and firm 'I may'
To change in our own hearts
Want to flow
Remain
Silent feather moves
This crazy world of ours
Is after all of us
Frail the Road we make

Not for heaven's sake
but something above you
No vain unprosperous ways
Sail on by
If dependent it on your will
Rest assured you're pending it still
You believe you're getting on
Just too weak admit you're wrong
In the season of the self
You're a product on a shelf
You're no-one

Hope for harmony
In this fickle maze
For change in our own hearts
Holy water rain
Make those feather moves
This burden is too much
For either one of us
Frail the road we make

Whats a ceremony
Loud and firm 'I may'
To change in our own hearts
Want to flow
Remain
Silent feather moves
This crazy world of ours
Is after all of us
Strive for harmony
In this fickle maze
For change in our hearts

Holy water rain
Make those feather moves
But there is too much
For either one of us
Frail the road we make
Who are youï»¿
