[Japanese Bonus Track]Be patient folks
Empty phrases cast to calm
Fat, well behaved, suburban princes
Head for the hills where night is still

Another king's blood
Floats in the streets
Claiming the riots to rise

(Revolution)
Delayed action-bomb
(Years of compulsion)
Set on fire
(Revolution)
Raging through the night
(Years of compulsion)
Black on Black

You're free to go
Evidence is hard to find
So says the law
I say they've corrupted
Clear is the sign, now is the time

Another king's quest
Faints it the mist
Left is the call of the wild

(Revolution)
Delayed action-bomb
(Years of compulsion)
Set on fire
(Revolution)
Raging through the night
(Years of compulsion)
Black on Black


Spare us for your visions
Need no eyes to see them through
Poor is your divinity
Iâve lost my faith long ago
Listen, the bells
For you they call

Another king's cry
Faints it the mist
Left is the call of the wild

(Revolution)
Delayed action-bomb
(Years of compulsion)
Set on fire
(Revolution)
Raging through the night
(Years of compulsion)
Black on Black
