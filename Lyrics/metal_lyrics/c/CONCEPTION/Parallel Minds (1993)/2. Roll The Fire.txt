[Ostby, Khan]

Eyes cold as ice
staring into vacancy
chasing shadow
from within
chase the cool winds
Harassed with remorse
now that all is said
and done
I know that I can't face
the old routine
longing back
to your whelming dark

In spite of my fear
I call your name
once again
blind by the light
of day
save me from solitude

Thoughts come
to mind
as the years pass
in review
as the sooting
rain divides
my emotions
I tremble with awe
the power to destruct
racing the convinction
that love survives
Through the dark
through the years

In spite of my fear
I call your name
once again
blind by the light
of day
save me from solitude

Roll the fire I read you
now
Roll the fire I feel you
now
Roll the fire I know you
now
Roll the fire don't leave
me now

In spite of my fear
I call your name
once again
blind by the light
of day
