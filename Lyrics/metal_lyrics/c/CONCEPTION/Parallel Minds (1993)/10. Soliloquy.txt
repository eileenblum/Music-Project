[Ostby, Khan]

[PART 1]
[Sweet Lavender]

Sense the purity of
your own mind child
such an innocence
not yet caught by
judging eyes
don't touch me
little seed
'cause I'll betray you
if you follow me
you'll never see

Trough a crack
in the wall
you watch the world nearly paralized
by this glimpse of
tomorrow
and a glimpse is all
you'll get
wherever you fly
cause you'll go blind
the moment you
reach down

On your way you'll
start wonder
where the ocean
meets the sand
on your way you'll feel
that heaven's
slipping slow through
your hand

Sweet lavender
can't remember
what it felt like
running trough
the rye

[PART 2]
[Non-Electric Redemption]

In the heat of 
her breath
my life seems
worthwhile 
when she swallows
my soul
I can hear the
conch'hymn
and I can watch myself
moaning, sweating,
climbing,
penetrating my prime
with a smile

Fill my needs
give me eternal
redemption
call my name
with a sense of pride
when I break through

She's the medium
I need to find
my way home
she's my intermediary
to everlasting youth
but I can't find
myself in the depths
of her bliss
is it me
is it her
or the world
we're living in

Heal my wounds
bring me eternal
salvation
call my name
with a sense of pride
don't make me now

All I gained
non-electric
redemption
she is not what she
used to be
before I fell
tell me why
why she's crying
beseeching
call her name
with a sense of pride
as you go down

[PART 3]
[In These Rooms]

There's no purity left
to save my soul
from his cavalcade
and no strength to
carry on
don't touch me
little seed
'cause I'll betray you
if you follow me you'll
never see
there's a heaven in
your hand child
there's a place I'm
dying to hide you

Poor lavender
cold but tender
life could only
teach you
how to cry

In these rooms
a plaintive whisper
fills the air
on these walls
I crucify my self
to hail you
right now
the time is ripe
for change
the time is ripe
for change
pierce my body
drink my tears
and my blood
come, be one with
me
through it's
getting dark
I can see the light
through I'm getting
weaker
I still feel I'm alive

Show me the way
follow me in
to heaven or hell
truth our faint illusion
I need you
I need your eyes
