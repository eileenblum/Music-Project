[Ostby, Khan]

I tried to fall asleep
but the beat of
your breath
resounds in my head
the grainy light
of dawn
provides my disgrace
can you tell me
why am I here
what force do you
possess

Pull me tighter,
my dear
be my shelter tonight
forever your men

The depth of
your mind
a mission designed
and I will obay
a devious plain
I'll do what I can
to prove your
intentions right
I had a dream
last night
in which the world
was one
and you were gone
I woke up sweating
humbly staring
into those
unfathomable eyes
it was your eyes
no alibies
no ransom in the night
I bite the bullet
Once again
and close you eyes
My life in your hand

The depth of
your mind
a mission designed
and I will obay
a devious plain
I'll do what I can
to prove your
intentions right

Face to face, keep 
the faith
love and hate,
there's no return
the one, I'm the one
who'll be there
I'll walk the thin line
for you
cry for you, kill for you 
I am a dying man,
can't you see
won't you be my
guiding light

The depth of
your mind
a mission designed
and I will obay
a devious plain
I'll do what I can
to prove your
intentions right
