[Ostby, Khan]

I came with the
moonlight
I spread with the winds
I'm future and
faint past
I'm ashes and dust

Hush, don't you cry
moonchild free
your soul
I'll tell you how
as soon as you're safe
in my embrace

Obedience-the key
to ecstasy
obedience-your way
to Calvary
do you belong

My might is eternal
I drift with the tide
Iâm yesterdayâs nightfall
Iâm vision of hope

Hush, ease your mind
moonchild seize the cross
Iâm right behind
There to put sense to your dreams

Obedience-the key to ecstasy
obedience-your way to Calvary
do you belong?

Flee with me
into the fields of glory
see the shine
Luna, the
promised land

Obedience-the key to ecstasy
obedience-your way to Calvary
Obedience-the key to ecstasy
obedience-your way to Calvary
do you belong?
