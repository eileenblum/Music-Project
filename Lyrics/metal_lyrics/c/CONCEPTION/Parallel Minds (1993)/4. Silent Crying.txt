[Ostby, Khan]

She lays her head on
her pillow
says her prayers
with no sound
there's a shadow
by her window
telling her
there'll be no one else
to know
Silent crying
for a childhood
gone by
she's slowly dying
with the secret
she hides
close to her heart

Another night left
to eternity
another memory
to deny
she counts her dolls
tries to forget about
what no one else
will ever know

Silent crying
for a childhood
gone by
she's slowly dying
with the secret
she hides

What no one else
will ever know

Silent crying
for a childhood
gone by
she's slowly dying
with the secret
she hides
Silent crying
if she dared
she would find
the word she
dreams of
but the word
passes by.
