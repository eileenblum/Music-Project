[Ostby, Khan]

I've always done
what's right for me
I never asked for sympathy, compassion
I've always offered
what it takes
to fit the frame my
mirror makes

I always thought
I had the key
to be the man
I wanna be
but now I know
I'll never find
the man who lived
inside my mind

Falling, I'm falling
I'm one step behind

My dream was
my way,
so precious, so plain
a lifetime in vain
the tide is on time
and water confines
the dream of my life

May be my versatility
absorbed all common
sense in me
I thought the word
was mine to keep
by dint of my authority
I swear I'd perish
at the stake
to pay the price
for my mistakes
but now my time is
running low
I've lived on a visions
far too long

Falling, I'm falling
I'm one step behind

My dream was
my way,
so precious, so plain
a lifetime in vain
the tide is on time
and water confines
the dream of my life

Hope my misery
doesn't show
shady memories
won't let go
sometimes, when
the crazy thunder
roams my head
I can only prey
that somehow
my dream's to blame
My dream was
my way,
so precious, so plain
a lifetime in vain
the tide is on time
and water confines
the dream of my life
