Though I know you're here,
Right by my side
I feel so insecure
Intuition calls to mind
The memory of a cold December night
It was only you and I a true belief in never-ending stories

But maybe I am blind
Maybe I want too much

Hand on heart
I wouldn't let you go
Hand on heart
That's all you have to know
So don't turn away

Could it be that
I am lost in you about to lose my mind
When you're gone I find it hard to breathe
So help me through and take your time
Together we could try to find the key

But maybe there's no way
Maybe I want too much

Hand on heart
I wouldn't let you go
Hand on heart
That's all you have to know
So don't turn away

Can you hear, you hear me calling out for you
I want you near Need you here,
We've still got so much left to do
Hand on heart for you
