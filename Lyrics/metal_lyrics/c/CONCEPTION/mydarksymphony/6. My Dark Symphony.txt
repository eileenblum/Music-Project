Rain keep pouring down
I feel my withered skin
On the naked window pane
I shut the door no need to run
A chain of broken dreams
Took my soul whatever god may be
I can't believe you're gone
For all eternity

Even fire and ice
Leave a hope to unite
But this moment in time feels long
Lies come alive
From the walk down the aisle
Like you're here
Like it was before
Like it used to be

With all this foul attention
I'm holding the beat and the note
You're coming closer
I am falling in too deep
Feel you over all you're still shinging
Warm and bright
Say hello and leave again with a smile
Over me over me
Silently you're waving goodbye
Goodbye for good

Through fire and ice
There's a hope to unite
Though this moment in time feels long
See these lies come alive
from the walk down the aisle
Like you're here
Like it was before

Walk with me
Now
Won't you talk to me
What you see
Is what you get
War within
Want to hear caress this love of mine
My dark symphony

Even fire and ice
Leave a hope to unite
But this moment in time feels long
Lies come alive
From the walk down the aisle
Like you're here
Like it was before
Like it used to be
