Easy
Coming closer
Every day
Easy
You are mine
Easy
Coming close to
What you wanna be
Sieze it
Like a new day
You were born to make resistance
You were born into the wild
You were flying through the fire of night
You know it's true in so may ways
You know it's never too late
Easy
Coming closer you and me
Easy
Don't hide
Meet me
In the shallows of a quiet bay
Kiss me without warning
You were born to make resistance
You were born into the wild
You were flying through the fire of night
You know the stakes
You know what it takes
You know it's never too late
For the light I see in you
You were born to make resistance
You were born into the wild
You were flying through the fire of night
You know it's true
You know what it takes
Into the wild you once were born
Into the wild
Into the wild you walk with hope
Into the wild
