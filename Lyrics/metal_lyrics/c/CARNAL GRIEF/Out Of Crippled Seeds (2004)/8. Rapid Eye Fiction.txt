A dreadful thought fills my head
Twisted minds escaped reality
Welcome back, lost again
With this virtual personality

Let's dream away, a fiction play

I hate the thought the dream must end
Twisted minds come back from rest
The night is here, I'll sleep to dawn
in this golden fabric nest.

Let's dream away, a fiction play

As we enter...
We obey
We command
We betray
