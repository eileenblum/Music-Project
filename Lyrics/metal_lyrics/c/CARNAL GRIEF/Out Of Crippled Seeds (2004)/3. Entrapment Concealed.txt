Welcome, please step inside.
Step into the lobotomizer, the eraser of all thought and sense.
Welcome, please step into the guilded halls of eternal enslavement.
Please crawl into the shepherds lap..

Lies, lies, lies - is what awaits inside
Lies, lies, lies - you're caught in the shepherds lies.
We're naught but mindless flies, caught in the shepherds lies
Lies, lies, lies - is what awaits inside

Please take a seat, hark to the glory of our saviour.
The one of selfsalvation. Listen, pray don't think, speak or act.
Let your mind slip away.
And become one of his docile sheeps..

Lies, lies, lies - is what awaits inside
Lies, lies, lies - you're caught in the shepherds lies.
We're naught but mindless flies, caught in the shepherds web
Lies, lies, lies - is what awaits inside
