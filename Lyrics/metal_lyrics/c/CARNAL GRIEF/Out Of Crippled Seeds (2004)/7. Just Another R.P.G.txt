I have the royalties,
of you multiple personalities
I am the source for all your cast
A result of the morbid childhood in your past

You breath the breath of the breed behind the beast
Your body and mind your carnal self bears the image
of the total devastation of your own selfimage.

Your characters varies from young to old
From happy to sad from shy to bold
Crazy of sane, it's all in your brain
But the question still remains

What do you look underneath the mask
I hope you don't mind if I ask
But the scars of mistreatment is spawned the same
It's just a fucking role-playing game!!!!
