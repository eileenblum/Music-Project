The land that have never slept
The land that have ever wept..

Streets never walked upon, screaming in silence.
Mourning souls inhabits this land..

[Ref:]
Welcome to the land of the dead
The land not known to man

Grey, cold and empty are the streets.
Void of life, death forever invoked

The source of living is dried out.
Empty souls inhabits this land.

[Ref:]
Welcome to the land of the dead
The land forsaken by life.

Mournful souls suffer indefinitely
Immortal in this infinite purgatory
Imprisoned souls inhabits this land

[Ref:]
Welcome to the land of the dead
The land of soul demise.
