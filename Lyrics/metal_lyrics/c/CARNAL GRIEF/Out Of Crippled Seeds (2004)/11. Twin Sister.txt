I wanna see beyond this illusion this hunger which you feel
Burning through your mind in a memory that became real
She walked into the darkness tempted by the creatures of the night
Sleeping in the fatal dawn, my sister fears the light

[Ref.]
Dark faith, twin sister
Cried out your thirst
Destined child
My embrace will be your first

A desperate attempt to live forever within her poisoned kind
Drains the blood of innocent, moves away with her blind
The wind blows gently whispering
In a silence that carries her name

[Ref.]

Dark faith, twin sister
Cried out your thirst
Destined child
My embrace will be your first
With your poison-like hunger, twin sister
Your will intoxicate me!
