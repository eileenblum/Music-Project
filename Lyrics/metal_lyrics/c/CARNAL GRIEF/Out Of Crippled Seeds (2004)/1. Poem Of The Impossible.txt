What is life without lies, gently creamed in your face?
Holding the tears in place, a fucking plague to the human race.

What is day without dawn? Dusk calls for dakening
The sphere's own shadowing, an end without beginning.

Stop praying for you illusions to take place in this tragic world of sufferance
We're better off without your solutions. In this global net of ignorance.

What is rape without pain ? Hope I make myself clear.
Would you still be sane if there wasn't anything to fear?

Stop praying for you illusions to take place in this tragic world of sufferance
We're better off without your solutions. In this global net of ignorance.
