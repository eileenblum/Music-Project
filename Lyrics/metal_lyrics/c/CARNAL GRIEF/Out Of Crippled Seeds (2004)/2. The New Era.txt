I crack my temple open - bare my inner self
The sacred side of me - Mine and no one else's.

The thoughts I kept within - And you fucking muse upon it.
With your relentless grin - Trapped in this bonfire-pit.

Grasp my heart, feel the beat
When the fear is lost, tear it apart.

Grasp my heart, feel the beat.
Confront the lust to tear it apart.
Slice it open

It's hard to understand - why you don't even care.
At least it seemed that way - but nothing lasts forever.

Grasp my heart, feel the beat
When the fear is lost, tear it apart.

Grasp my heart, no more deceit.
Confront the lust to tear it apart.
Slice it open - tear it apart!

I'm the disgrace - spit in my face
Roll me over - and let me die.

Grasp my heart, feel the beat
When the fear is lost, tear it apart.

Grasp my heart, feel the beat.
Confront the lust to tear it apart.
Slice it open, crush, shred and tear it apart.
