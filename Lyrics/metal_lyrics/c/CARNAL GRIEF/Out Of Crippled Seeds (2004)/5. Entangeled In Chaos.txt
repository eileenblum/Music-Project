Redrain my soul
Deny my acts
Erase my past
Let my soul be forever harvested

Entangeled in chaos - trapped in eternity
Drained out soul - stuck in purgatory
Contempt to life - suicide solution
I'm a mire shade - the result of time

[Ref.]
Reject my soul
Deny my acts
Erase my past
Let my soul be forever harvested

My body infested my vermin
My soul devoured by time
My pain respite eternal
My mind a chaos orb

[Ref.]

My mind will for ever and ever suffer into eternity

Meek is my resistance
My soul is set on fire
My body is burning away
Ashes is what remains

[Ref.]
