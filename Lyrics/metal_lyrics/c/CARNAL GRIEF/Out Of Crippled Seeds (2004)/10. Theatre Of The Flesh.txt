Mentally misshapen and outrageous characters
A theatre of individuality and a tragic view of live

[Ref.]
Theatre of the morbid - theatre of the tragic
Remember the flesh, we are alike!!!

Flesh our only indisputable commonality
No matter what race, politics or religion
Morbid or not, we are alike

[Ref.]

Remember the flesh, your origin, remember the flash, an undisputable fact.

Tormented flesh, tormenting mankind
Deeds of evil, remember your origin... the flesh!

[Ref.]
