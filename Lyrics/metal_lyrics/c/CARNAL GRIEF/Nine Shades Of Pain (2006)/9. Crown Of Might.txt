On a pedestal built on the backs of others
A marionette rules, irreproachable and inviolable
The base of power inherited unequal and unjust.
Remnants from a bygone past, still supported by the backs of others

[Chorus:]
Nepotism in absurdum - living on merits long gone
Might and influence - from a feudal society bygone
Nepotism in absurdum - living on merits long gone
Might and influence - gone since long.

An undeserved respect and obedience from their subjects
Originating from oppression and cohesion.
Realize that they're obsolete figures, they're hindering our progress
Let's evolve from these remnants and move on.

[Chorus:]
Nepotism in absurdum - living on merits long gone
Might and influence - from a feudal society bygone
Nepotism in absurdum - living on merits long gone
Might and influence - gone since long.
