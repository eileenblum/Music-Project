A wave of blight consume the mind
A muck attempt to escape the blind
Screams of despair rend the frightened skies
Menacing frontier we praise the apprise

Numbening place
Frightening space
Escape gone
Imprisoned one

The will is shackling
Willingness numbening
An empty warble - a futile cry

Catatonic
Catastrophic
Claustrophobic
The walls are closing in, they're coming down
The walls are closing in, they're coming down

The walls are closing in
The abscond a concept precluding
Will crumbling, paralyzing frontier
No screams shall meet the posterior heir

Inhibition in my mind
World reluctant, the body vile

Only the carrion will prevail
The end is here
The mind will fail

Catatonic
Catastrophic
Claustrophobic
The walls are closing in, they're coming down
The walls are closing in, they're coming down

Catatonic
Catastrophic
Claustrophobic
The walls are closing in, they're coming down
The walls are closing in, they're coming down
