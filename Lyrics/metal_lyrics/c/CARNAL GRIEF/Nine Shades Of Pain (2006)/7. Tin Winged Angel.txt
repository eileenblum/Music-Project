I see a presence of meekness in the horizon.
Coming closer I feel the eyes on.
Me are grim and possessive torches
Lightening and encircling forces

Remorseful, filled with anxiety
Unwilling to see the inevitably
Omissioned mind oh so blind
With fear of separation you bind

[Chorus:]
Oh, my tin-winged angel how you heed.
With gluttonous envy you feed.
Upon your liars chair you bleed.
Envy your malicious dreed.

Frail and hollow you crumble at my feet.
Attributing the frailty to your meet.
Unable and unwilling to make commence.
Forcing your frailty on everyone else.

Repent or be forever in debt
Unworthy tears you have wept
Hark to the chant of the contempt
Embodied in flesh this is the end

[Chorus:]
Oh, my tin-winged angel how you heed.
With gluttonous envy you feed.
Upon your liars chair you bleed.
Envy your malicious dreed.
