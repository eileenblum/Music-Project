Want to tell you I hate you
But I'm not sure if I care
Just want to turn away
And never look back

Worn out - close to insanity
So your leisure is killing you?
Well keep on ignoring reality
And life will pass you by

Draining my soul, it fades away
Turning me into something else
Starving us both, there is no end
Draining my soul, it fades away

Just wanna say I told you so
But it really doesn't say enough
Just keep on screening reality
With your malignant blind spots

Draining my soul, it fades away
Turning me into something else
Starving us both, there is no end
Draining my soul, it fades away

Drain my soul, it's very faint
Turned me into the fountain of hate
Killing us both, there is my end
Drain my soul, it's very faint
