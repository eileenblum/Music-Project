I've seen your hearts - I've seen your mind
Within your presence I go blind
I've seen your souls - I've seen your cries
Eye for an eye and I hope to die
I've seen your emblems - I've seen your signs
I've seen your passions, cross over lines
I've seen your fears - I've seen your hate
In blissful ignorance you seal your fate.

[Chorus:]
What's your excuse, are you confused?
On what grounds, oh, I just don't get it
Can you explain why you're causing pain, is this what's sane?
How do you rationalize your wicked manners?

I've seen your anger â I've seen your lust
I've seen blood and guts â I'm so disgusted
I've seen your hopes â I've seen your dreams
Refined malice, they're worse than greed.
I've seen your heroes â I've seen your foes.
You're all insane, so.
I've seen your present repeat your past
I see no future, nothing learned, nothing lasts!

[Chorus:]
What's your excuse, are you confused?
On what grounds, don't know why, but I just don't get it
Can you explain why you're causing pain?
How do you rationalize your wicked manners?
I'll make you bleed.

Oh, what's in your mind?
How can you smile?
Is it your lack of remorse?
Or your will to perish?
