Flashing images of violence and murder
All in the name of commercialism
Reporting about violence,leisure and weather
Without changing the tone of their voice
They've constructed an information feed
A feed unable to avoid, it's everywhere
The news value is measured on a sensational scale
To accommodate their economic prosperity

I wipe away my eyes, not willing to see
Not wanting to understand
At least to stop is entering my mind
Entering my mind

In times of information draught
Fabricated of exaggerated stories
And lied fills your translucent pages
A struggle for further economic prosperity
Yet the blame is ours
You're an unavoidable instance of our society
You're just a consequence of our curiosity
Profiting on an information-feed gone berserk

I wipe away my eyes, not willing to see
Unable to escape the sights
Casting horrid shadows in my mind
Shadows in my mind
