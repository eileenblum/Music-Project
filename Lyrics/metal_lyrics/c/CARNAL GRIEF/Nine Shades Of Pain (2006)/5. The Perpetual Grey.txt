The seasons ling for each other
In order that they may
Be cured of the excesses
And the continuum will proceed

Winter longs for the promise of change
Spring hungers for fulfilling it's promise
Summer sweat for fall to quench it's heat
Fall exhausts toward the descant into winter

Fall - the everlasting grey
Fall - escape we never may
A one perpetual season we shall see
When fall has arrived and never us will leave

But when the hunger dissipates
The sweat dries out
The promise of spring remains unfulfilled
Then the fall is everlasting

No promise of spring shall ever come
The eternal fall from where
We shall never escape has arrived
Perpetual and everlasting grey

Fall - the everlasting grey
Fall - escape we never may
A one perpetual season we shall see
When fall has arrived and never us will leave

The seasons ling for each other
In order that they may
Be cured of the excesses
And the continuum will proceed

Winter longs for the promise of change
Spring hungers for fulfilling it's promise
Summer sweat for fall to quench it's heat
Fall exhausts toward the descant into winter

Fall - the everlasting grey
Fall - escape we never may
A one perpetual season we shall see
When fall has arrived and never us will leave
