[Verse 1:]
In the dawn of oblivion
Reign of ruthless dominion
Enslaving souls of humanity
Spreading lies and depravity
Our race became obsolete
Part of feeding technology
Few remained just to serve its will
Seeking others they have to kill

[Pre-chorus 1:]
There is no light
Behind these walls
Only the crimson sunrise

[Chorus 1:]
Welcome to the new age of slaughter
Welcome to a new kind of hell
All our dreams will soon turn to ashes
Freedom lies forever in chains

[Verse 2:]
It begun as an accident
Cover up by the government
Countless victims in single day
By our own kind we've been betrayed
All a part of the masterplan
Ancient game to enslave all men
We are here only to obey
So the hunter became a prey

[Pre-chorus 2:]
There is no hope
Behind these walls
Only the night eternal

[Chorus 1:]
Welcome to the new age of slaughter
Welcome to a new kind of hell
All our dreams will soon turn to ashes
Freedom lies forever in chains

[Bridge:]
Find the dark place of His birth
The only way to save us all
Hardest task is still ahead
Redemption of our souls

[Chorus 2:]
Welcome to the new age of slaughter
Welcome to a new kind of hell
All the dreams of better tomorrow
Will come true as we break our chains
