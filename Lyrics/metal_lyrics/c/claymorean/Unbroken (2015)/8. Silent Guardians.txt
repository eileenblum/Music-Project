Winged beasts of his majesty, honored through time 
Protectors of realm, four dragons that stood tall 
Omniscient, silent and true 
Bringers of justice, givers of hope 
Pillars of freedom, allegiance never swayed 
But soon things would change 

They did oversee a wizard one day 
Who came to their king with grin upon his face 
That sinister face 
Dragons then knew something was wrong 
They were enraged to see the kingdom betrayed 
Theyâll betray their king on this day 

The king of the realm traded his honor for a tyrantâs life 
In league with the wizard who promised him all he could want 
Four dragons then came prepared to attack 
Before they could act, the wizard assured they would stay 
With his magic he put them away 

Turned into stone for what they had known 
They were the guardians of paradise 
Once dragons of fame, the statues remain 
Standing alone in the wind and the rain 

The wizard ended the dragonsâ great rule 
Turned them to stone and placed each one alone 
on castle's four tops of the world 
Instead of the power the king met his end 
Death dealer the wizard, his task is now complete 
Throne is now a vacant seat 

The dragonsâ spirits looked down from above 
Knowing all well there is nothing they could do 
The wizard knew this too 
Evil minions were summoned, the kingdom now claimed 
No use to wizard the people dragons once saved 
All were slain!!! 

The king of the realm traded his honor for a tyrantâs life 
The wizard betrayed him and took all he could want 
The dragons stood still on the castle top 
They could not act, they watched as the madness took place 
Forever in silence they wait 

Turned into stone for what they had known 
They were the guardians of paradise 
Once dragons of fame, the statues remain 
Standing alone in the wind and the rain 

Decades go by and still dragons stay 
Bodies of stone with spirits dismayed 
No savior in sight no chance to be freed 
The kingdom crumbled under kingâs greed 
Decades go by and still dragons stay 
Bodies of stone with spirits dismayed 
No savior in sight no chance to be freed 
All betrayed!!! 

Turned into stone for what they had known 
They were the guardians of paradise 
Once dragons of fame, the statues remain 
Standing alone in the wind and the rain 
Turned into stone for what they had known 
They were the guardians of paradise 
These dragons of fame, forever in shame 
Only the wizard to know of their fate
