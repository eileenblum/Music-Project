Sa istoka vojska silna 
krenu protiv Bajazita 
Horde moÄnog Tamerlana 
mongolskoga straÅ¡nog kana 

Far beyond the rising sun 
from eastern lands they rode 
led by fearsome Timur Lang 
the mighty Sword of God 

On the trail to Angora 
near crossroad of the world 
to wage a war with Ottomans 
the Turkish overlord 

Time flies for sultan's army 
Calls his vassal reinforcements 
and at the dawn of battle 
bravest of them all will 

Fight!!! 
Two-headed eagle in white 
Knight of the dragon attacks 
Armor as black as the night 
In battle supreme 
like lions they fight 

Drhti carstvo otomansko 
Sultan stoji bespomoÄan 
jedina mu nada osta 
slava srpskih vitezova 

Sunlight rose on hallowed soil 
the crows have filled the sky 
No warning given from each side 
the carnage has begun 

Thousands fell in single blow 
outnumbered in their ranks 
scattered Turkish soldiers roar 
the sultan's overthrown 

Deep into heart of battle 
from the flanks on screaming stallions 
three times they cut through Mongols 
pathway to the glory
