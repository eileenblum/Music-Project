He was the faithful servant of God and Emperor 
Devout to Sigmarâs temple, zealous and honorable 
The mark of the witchunter he bears and he is sworn 
to fight the Hordes of Chaos, for such deeds he was born 

Deep into the dungeons he found 
scrolls of arkane wisdom lost 

Chaos will rise 
Eternal champion in favor of gods 
Death in his eyes 
Archaon the lord of the End times 

Temple and all its splendor in service of false god 
Dark prophecyâs awakened, He is the chosen One 
Burned all the ancient scriptures, killed all his nearest kin 
traveled to northern wastelands, offered his sacrifice 

Summoning the ancient daemons 
The six treasures he must find
