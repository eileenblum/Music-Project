From the fires of betrayal unto the blood of revenge 
Bounded with chains to conformity sworn 

Once youâre theirs there's no way out 
They wash your brain, put the words in your mouth 

Never forget that you are walls of steel and iron 
You are the sole walls of Imperia 

Once youâre theirs there's no way out 
but you're not alone in these endless lairs 

We keep the name of the fallen soldiers 
We sing the songs through the bloody corridors 
And through the aeons of revelations 
There will be no more desperation 

Those which slumber eternally will rise again 
And you shall pay them a debt from the death that you sow in His name 

Never forget that you are walls of steel and iron 
You are the sole walls of Imperia 

March into the fires of battle 
Unto the anvil of war 

We keep the name of the fallen soldiers 
We sing the songs through the bloody corridors 
And through the aeons of revelations 
There will be no more desperation
