We came from dimension beyond space and time 
to conquer your world for we are Divine 
Blessed be the ones who are touched by the hand 
of infernal darkness that spreads through this land 

Blood, murder, war! 
Skulls for the Throne of Khorne! 
Kill, maim and burn! 
The favor of Blood God youâll earn 
Death, disease, decay! 
To Lord of the Plagues you will pray 
Suffering, sickness and pain 
dawn of destruction will reign 

Gods of Chaos 
Ruinous powers unleashed 

Hearken you men, brave sons of the north 
bow to your knees and pledge on your swords 
be loyal receive the greatest reward 
forever in service of the Chaos Lords 

Sorcery, shadow and change 
your minds I corrupt and derange 
Limitless thirst for power 
my name makes all men cower 
Pleasure, passion, desire 
Iâll wake your internal fire 
Decadence, lust and pride 
to Dark Prince eternally tied
