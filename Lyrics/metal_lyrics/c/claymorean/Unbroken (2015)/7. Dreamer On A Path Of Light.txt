Journey into the wildest of dreams 
In a land of the eternal spring 
Bards are playing the songs of the old 
long forsaken a story untold 

Come with me on the meadow of gold 
lies the world which no mortals have seen 
time ago was committed a sin 
newborn blood of the ancients within 

Once he came to a magical wall 
mirror showed him the way to the past 
only one who can open the gate 
to divine where he will meet his fate 

Then in silence he opened the door 
stream of infinite light on his face 
as he walked through the portal alone 
wind carried him to vastness of space 

High above the mountains 
my spirit's flying free 
Life is neverending 
so don't cry for me
