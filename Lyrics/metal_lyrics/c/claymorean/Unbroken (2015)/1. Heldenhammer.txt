River runs to the north 
watched by eyes of the eagle 
Battle songs from the old 
spread through mountains and forests 

Myrmidia, beautiful goddess of war 

Noble and brave, let thy wisdom prevail 
Free our realm from the grasp of the shadow 

Comet's piercing the sky 
blazed with light and a twin-tail 
Gods have send us a sign 
child was born, it's an omen 

His time will come, Sigmar the glorious one 

Hammer of war, he shall rise to the sky 
God Emperor, in his honor weâll die 

Sanctus Dominus 
Gloria Ave 

Hail to the Lord Emperor 
In his holy wisdom he'll be our guide 
Let the freedom shine with hammer high 

Sanctus Dominus 
Gloria Ave 

Hammer of war will ascend to the sky 
God Emperor, in his honor weâll die 
Raise the banners high and ride into glory 
brothers side by side for honor and pride
