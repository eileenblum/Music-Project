I was blessed by the unholy light, I have lived since the existence of time 
Fear my name as I walk through the void of the infinite armies of Chaos 
He was born with the soul of a king, preordained to end all suffering 
Heavens cry when his hammer awakes, all shall cower in the final battle 

Born for war, bear the mark, storm is near, wild and dark 

Bravely rides the avatar of god, the exalted one 
hurling Chaos warlord to the ground for the final strike 
Bravely rides the avatar of god, the exalted one 
hurling Chaos warlord to the ground for the final strike 
He will end this fight 

Suddenly Prince of Demons attacks, sinks his sword through the Emperor's chest 
Mountains crack from the blood in his voice for the end of his valiant splendor 

Bravely falls the avatar of god, the exalted one 
on his knees impaled he screams in vain for the final strike 
Bravely falls the avatar of god, the exalted one 
on his knees impaled he screams in vain for the final strike 
Fearless battle cry 

Born for war, pay the price, storm has come, wild and dark 

Standing alone watching it all 
Quiet as a snake I sharpen my blade 
Long was my wait, deep was the shame 
The hour has come to honor my name 

The Ironhide, bearing his axe 
Immortal son of the Orcs 

Let it be written, this day is mine 
my blood is boiling, now is the time 
Dark One is broken down on his knees 
I give no quarter, vengeance complete 

Twice he struck the Dark Lord, two deadly blows 
Archaon slumped to the ground, itâs the end of the storm 

Born for war, armed with hate, wields his axe, fills his fate 

Lifeless body of the Chaos Lord lying on the ground 
One name echoes through the mountain range, mighty Ironhide 
Lifeless body of the Chaos Lord lying on the ground 
One name echoes through the mountain range, mighty Ironhide 
Bringer of the light
