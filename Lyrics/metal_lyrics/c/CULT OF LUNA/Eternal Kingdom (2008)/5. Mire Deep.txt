A wolf pack gathering around the holy fire.
To serve shadow master centre bound.
Mighty eagles sore one last time.
Over minions that found their demise.

Storm filled skies, feel death come crawling.
Land of ice, black chief comes marching.

The vibration of mammoth striding.
Ground is cracking, trees are trembling.
The sight of fearless creatures devastates.
Empowered to the teeth.

Almighty emperor.
Guide me through mire deep.
Almighty emperor.
Show me their true belief.

He, ursmens overlord.
