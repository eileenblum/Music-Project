Fear roams throughout this land.

Where no man dare tread.
Dark shapes protect the one, not bound by laws or flesh.

Days of isolation.
Regret dominates.
Unwilling to face what awaits outside.
When lights are gone, woodland comes alive.
Fire is born into their eyes.

Ghost of this age.
What the creek take.
From a wretched state rose the willing.
