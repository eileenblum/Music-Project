Rise from your grave
Bow to her name
Every single word she speaks is golden
One drop of all nights I have wandered
Could fill your empty void

Close that shallow gap
The pain is a rebirth
Leave your empty skin to rot
Long have you waited
The steps behind you decay into nothing

At the edge of your memory
A being that ceased to be
Rise from your grave
Bow to her name

At the edge of your memory
A being that ceased to be
Rise from your grave
Bow to her name

In the fall came the rain
Flooded the fields
Cleansed what remained
With new eyes she appears
But I am no longer here
