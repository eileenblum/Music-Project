Black roots run through me like veins
Igniting fires
Delivering life
The night brings time to an end
Silence changes form
I return

At last words will be spoken with heart
In air they form the thoughts that they carry

Eyes of the forest
Stakes driven through frost
Stones are laid out
A circle for those who lost

My children will work this land
With devout hands
With harvest on mind

Stones are laid out
Stones are laid out

Here comes the rain
The falling sky
The hidden road
The direction home
