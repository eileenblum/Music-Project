Break, breakâ break
We break the silence with our heartbeats
With our heartbeats

Sleepâ sleepâ sleep
Our eyes are shut, my hands are shaking
Bodies aching

We are
We are trying
We are
We are trying

Wake, wakeâ wake
As waves of fear come crashing down
All around us

Breathe, breathe, breathe
We feel the end is getting near
We are still here

We are
We are trying
We are
We are trying
