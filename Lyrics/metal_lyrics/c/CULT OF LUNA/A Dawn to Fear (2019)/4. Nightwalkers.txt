There is a fire in your voice
There is a fire
There is a fire in your voice
There is a fire

The river of light is running dry
Eyes are burning
Deceiving the heart
I hear howls from the northern dogs
There is a fire in their voices

Crowned in colours of fall
And the setting sun in her hand
I see children run towards dying light
There is a fire in her voice

Dusk sets a tone
Reminds us of what is to come
This night is a window
We offer our admission and return home

Dusk sets a tone
Reminds us of what is to come
This night is a window
We offer our admission and return home

There is a fire in my voice
There is a fire
There is a fire in my voice
There is a fire
