When, when sleep is your only refuge
When shed tears are gone
Lay your head to rest
Lay your head to rest beside me

When, when you are falling, falling
When ghosts chant your name
Lay your head to rest
Lay your head to rest and follow

Let's set out for the horizon
Let's chase the sunrise
We are the stars that light up the sky

And as I burn out, you will carry me as I carried you
And as I burn out, you will carry me as I carried you
When I lay my head to rest
When I lay my head to rest
