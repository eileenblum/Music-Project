Silence came crawling
There is a man at the door
In the absence of light
We merge with our shadows

Rise and ride my friend
Together we'll bring on the end

The water seems darker
A scent of fear is in the air
Eyes in every corner
Movements everywhere

Heavy is the burden
Clouds roll in to rectify
Step by step we falter
And all good things must die

The door can't withstand his voice
With heavy strides he enter
Deliverance at last
He speaks words from the dead

Rise and ride my friend
Together we'll bring on the end

Rise and ride my friend
Together we'll bring on the end
We'll bring on the end

"In dreams I see what's coming
Wolves in man's clothing
There is no escape for the meek
The ground beneath them is eroding."
