This land owns him
It speaks through his bones
Deeper cuts than any man could endure

Time is not his ally
Like water hollows out stone
Anger sparks the will to see the world burn

A pariah with a heavy heart
His vision is long gone
An outcast doomed to wander alone
Under a pine his rage dances on

From afar, just a light on the hill
Until his hate rains down on them
An answer summoned from all his might
Balls of fire and lightning that strikes
Death cannot break their bond
