A dawn to fear
Feet so cold and heavy
The rift divides
Separates light from dark

A dawn to fear
Fists raised in defiance
The morning breaks
Callous like a wave

A dawn to fear
Clouds dissolve
To spite the end
To give praise
We are all her kin

The skyline marks a border
To what never will return
Rage keeps the fire burning
The blood seals our bound

A dawn to fear
Cling on to the night
A dawn to fear

A dawn to fear
Cling on to the night
A dawn to fear

A dawn to fear
A dawn to fear
