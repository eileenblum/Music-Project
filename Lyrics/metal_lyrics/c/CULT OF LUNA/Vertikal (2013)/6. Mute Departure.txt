My waves are resonating towards the unknown,
Trapped underneath;
Soon I'll break through,

I turn to vapour and dissolve,
But not in this world, for I am gone.

I'll be silent when I leave;
When I Leave I'll go out flying.

I see them move, far beneath, heading towards the back streets.
