This is the final moments of our last days.
Release and cease, beating yourself into submission.

With poisoned blood, the demon speaks;
See how the wolves devour the weak.

They will not inherit.
Eyes closed but forced open. Bodies shaken awake.
Inhale and cease, beating yourself into submission.

No one holds us accounted.
