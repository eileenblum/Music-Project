What I have seen behind the frontline
Is what keeps me existing
I can feel it moving through me
Pure electricity

Shabra and shatila rises and retaliates
An invitation that raises the dead
I have seen their fate

The sun sets over holy land
And our last day advances
I can feel it piercing through me
The nails from god
