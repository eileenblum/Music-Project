Below the surface I swim
Holding my breath as I sink deeper
Watching the colors and the shapes
Searching for another way out
Clinging on to every last word
A shred of hope long since forgotten
All that is left is hate and regret
This world got the best of me

Further on. Closing in
Falling down. Giving in...

...To the beyond
