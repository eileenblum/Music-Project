Don't you shut me out. Swimming in black waters
Don't you sink me in. You will pay in fire
When will I get some rest? Can I sleep again?
To find peace inside: Sleep until it's gone.

I'll try to separate what's inside
Creatures I'll be dragging out
The unknown light is creeping in
Sending out all demons to war
