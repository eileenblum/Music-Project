The reflections held another vision
Loss of faith to the cross
Again you're lost into the void
Soon comes wisdom

Time suspended in constant denial
Once it seemed so clear
Unfold the burning inside and see
Are the patterns the same as before?

Embrace thoughts of eternal desire
Let all senses slip away
Rebuild your faith, let go of sorrow
Soon comes darkness
