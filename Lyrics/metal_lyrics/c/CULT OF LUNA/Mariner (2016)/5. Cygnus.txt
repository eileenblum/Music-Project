Can you see what's following you
It has a mind of its own
Steps so quiet you can't hear it
A parasite without a home

It's got a smile but you don't trust it
Concrete reasons unknown
Put it behind you in the space of your day
A parasite without a home

Can you see what's following you
It has a mind of its own
Steps so quiet you can't hear it
A parasite without a home

Leave her to sing her withered songs
In tunnels painted like the dawn
Bring me the echo 'til it's gone

Nothing escapes this hold
Desperate against the cold
Its flesh made out of stardust
Iron oxide into rust

To write a letter to the night
This songless, sightless, silent giant
This feeble plea
A speck of dust
A drop of sea
It's locked in you and me
Rip it out and feel its heat
Forget the way things seem to be
Meaningless to the one and only

Leave her to sing her withered songs
In tunnels painted like the dawn
Bring me the echo 'til it's gone

Nothing escapes this hold
Desperate against the cold
Its flesh made out of stardust
Iron oxide into rust

It's got a smile but you don't trust it
Concrete reasons unknown
Put it behind you in the space of your day
A parasite without a home

And she'll be standing strong
Her hair is lost in storm
Open your mouth, let air rush in
To get a sense of her form

And she'll be standing strong
Her hair is lost in storm
Open your mouth, let air rush in
To get a sense of her form

She'll be standing while you suffer
Her hair is lost in the storm
Open your mouth, let air rush in
To get a sense of her form

But if the audience is imminent
And if your parasites come home
Remember the old adage
Deep roots are not reached by frost

Leave her to her withered song
Tunnels painted like the dawn
Write your letter to the night
Sightless, songless, silent giant
