We leave
We are not conquerors
Upward
We are not conquerors
Toward new dreams
We are not conquerors
A new hope
We float with the tide
An odyssey

We are not conquerors
Underneath
We are not conquerors
The world left behind
We are not conquerors
As we
We float with the tide
As we escape gravity

Closing my eyes
And I
Embrace darkness
The stars will not
Guide us
But their light will
Show us the way

We are not conquerors
The stars will not guide us, close your eyes embrace the darkness
We float with the tide
The stars will not guide us, close your eyes embrace the darkness
We are not conquerors
The stars will not guide us, close your eyes embrace the darkness
We float with the tide
The stars will not guide us, close your eyes embrace the darkness

No room for fear
A greater call
A sacrifice
For the benefit of all

With the sun at our backs
We heed and
We bleed

This is
We are not conquerors
The first step
We are not conquerors
The reach the infinite
We are not conquerors
What lies ahead
We float with the tide
Is unknown

We are not conquerors
It's a quest
We are not conquerors
For survival
We are not conquerors
Past all
We float with the tide
Known frontiers
