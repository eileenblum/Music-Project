The members of his squad grow thick
A testament to "get rich quick"
No sign of mismatched features
Secondary organs from within

So on command they open
Winding clockwork sirens as they come
Scramble the rock face through the glare of morning sun â to run

Your time is costlier than fine
The wreck of S.S. Needle
Simpletons that want all in and
And render horror feeble

Splinters always hide under the skin
From glitter of the pin
To brave a friend in battle comes
The thimble with his sign:
"You've got to spit to see the shine
Let me see you run this gamut blind"

Your voice, it shakes, you smile so dryly
Let us see and touch you lightly
The moon is so unseemly bright
Cut your hair off, watch all night
Like splinters always hide under the skin

Like battles of the thimble and the pin
Put me down where I can see you run

Like battles of the thimble and the pin
Put me down where I can see you run

Your time is costlier than fine
The wreck of S.S. Needle
Simpletons that want all in and
And render horror feeble

Knees go down and up in time
To sleep in foreign seas well
Silence while we cross this spine
Ring out the warning bell

You've got to spit to see the shine
Let me tell you â run and try to hide

Put me down where I can see you run
Put me down where I can see you run
Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run

Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run

Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run

Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run

Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run

Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run

Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run

Put me down where I can see you run
Put me down where I can see you run
Put me down where I can see you run
You run, you run, you run
Put me down where I can see you run
