Reason has left with someone else.
Listen close then shift it to the shelf.
It smells like rain is coming soon.
A muffled sound of thunder startles you, too.

Batten down.
The wandering winter snow that falls
Like lonely little diamonds heading home
To find instead of something nothing.
Not a single soul.
And swaybacks make their way around the room.

When all your dreams are falling through,
She'll say, "I told you so."

Light, bright.
Shut down night.
The beast has come to gloat.
Smug and listless, is what this is, lie down 'til it's done.
Your hackles are raised, its stories held back late,
And speaks to all the wrong that's come and gone, said and done.

It's so lovely the way your skin has raised to seed and back again.

Swaybacks make their way around the room,
While you talk too high the list goes on and on and on
With no click three times to send you spinning home
And swaybacks make their way around the room.

The beast has come to gloat.
I told you so, it said
The beast has come to gloat.
I told you so, it said

Light, bright.
Shut down night.
The beast has come to gloat.
Smug and listless, is what this is, lie down 'til it's done.
Your hackles are raised, its stories held back late,
And speaks to all the wrong that's come and gone, said and done.

The beast has come to gloat.
I told you so, it said
The beast has come to gloat.
I told you so, it said

And now you see not blue, but red
A toothless shift to dark again
"I told you so," she said.

A perfect thing, that change of guard
A turnaround that speaks in scars
"I told you so," it said, she said, it said

A perfect thing, that change of guard
A turnaround that speaks in scars
"I told you so," it said, she said, it said
