Natt varje natt
Skiftar fÃ¤rg
Ãppnar sig
Flyter bort
Bort frÃ¥n allt
Ekar tomt Ã¶verallt
Natt varje natt
LÃ¤ngre bort
LÃ¤ngre ut
Ãppet hav
Utan ljud
Tiden gÃ¥r
Tidens Slut

Lights, lights go out
Sky grows dark
Endless nights
Looking up
Reaching out
Passing through
Moving on
Close getting close
Hard to breath
Getting cold
I canât speak
Out of time
Close my eyes
One last beat.
I run. Momentum gained.
Slowly the dawn is raised.
Light transforms into a solid red.
Red as the blood. Red as the lie.
I crack the surface and continue on.
Waves form in every direction, to find their home.
