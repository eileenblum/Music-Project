Leave me behind the black wall of decadence.
Burn it all. Dance with the flames that he dictates.
Breathe in the smoke and get high on misery.
Drifting deeper. The current drags you down.
Rest your eyes. Live amongst the shadows.

Fall into sleep. 
Walk through the light.
At last you're on your own. 
This time you stand alone.
