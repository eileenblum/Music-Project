My heads a mess, my mind's on the blink
Too much to do ain't got time to think
I got nothing better than to run wild
'Cause I'm a born again problem child

I'm too old to be going through a stage
When I'm dead I'll act my age
I'm only happy when I'm running wild
'Cause I'm a born again problem child

You're never too old to cuss and spit
You're never too old to throw a fit
Even when I'm fat, bald, wrinkled and grey
A problem child I'm gonna stay

I got a disease that no therapist can cure
I'm allergic to acting mature
My only medicine is to run wild
'Cause I'm a born again problem child

Born again, born again problem child
Born again, born again problem child

I really like it to lose my mind
I highly recommend you try it sometime
Even when I sleep I dream of running wild
'Cause I'm a born again problem child

I'm too old to be going through a stage
When I'm dead I'll act my age
I'm only happy when I'm running wild
'Cause I'm a born again problem child

I'm a born again problem child

You better hope I'm just going through a stage
You better hope I learn to act my age
Or it's a fad that will go out of style
Fuck that, I'm a born again problem child

I'm a born again problem child
