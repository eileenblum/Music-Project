If you wanna find me, just look for trouble
When you found trouble just look around
If you wanna find me, just look for trouble
When you found trouble that's where I'll be found
If you really need me, just look for trouble
When you found trouble just look around
If you really want me just look for trouble
When you found trouble that's where I'll be found

If it's a perfect world you see
Then you're nowhere close to me
'Cause I'm not meant to be
Where things are pretty

If you wanna find me, just look for trouble
When you found trouble just look around
If you wanna find me, just look for trouble
Where you found trouble that's where I'll be found

If it's an ugly world you see
Then you're getting close to me
'Cause I'm meant to be where things are ugly
Pretty ugly, pretty ugly, pretty oh so pretty ugly

If you really need me, just look for trouble
When you found trouble just look around
If you really want me just look for trouble
When you found trouble that's where I'll be found
That's where I'll be found

If you really want me, just look for trouble
When you found trouble just look around
That's where I'll be found
That's where I'll be found
That's where I'll be found
If you want me
