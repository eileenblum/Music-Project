I hate pop songs
They think they're clever, I think they're wrong
I hate bubble gum punk
They got they look but the music is junk

I hate anyone that savours
The foul stench of this months flavour
And hell's a place that you can go
If you like disco or techno

Pop songs, pop songs
Pop songs, pop songs

Hi boys and girls, come on and get happy

I hate Puff Daddy
And his friend the dead fatty
I hate the Grateful Dead
But I'll be grateful when the rest of them are dead
I feel like I'm on pins and needles
How many bands ca rip off The Beatles?
And everyday there is another
Band that got big by playing a cover

I hate pop songs, I hate pop songs
I hate pop songs, I hate pop songs

I hate Celine Dion
Titanic song makes me wanna moan
And if I here another love ballad
I thin I'm gonna have to toss my salad
And I hate teen idols
They got signed by old farts with fancy titles
There's nothing worse at least to me
Than stupid lyrics with a lame ass melody

I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs
Pop songs, I hate pop songs
Pop songs, I hate pop songs
Pop songs, I hate pop songs
Pop songs, I hate pop songs
