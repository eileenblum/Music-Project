This time I went a little to far

I'm right here I'm on to something
I know you're in there I can sense your fear
There's no point trying to deny it
I can feel it 'cause I'm oh so near

Knock knock I'm coming for you
I'll huff and puff and blow your mind out
Knock knock I come from hiding
I don't know if I'll be coming back
I don't know when I'll be coming back
I don't know when I'll be coming back
I don't know if I'll be coming back

Oh yea, went way to far this time
Long past that point you're not supposed to go
Ya rode through the sign that said the road ends here
Went way to far for the safety
But not enough for the necessity

There's no hiding I got you covered
There's no safety or place to run
Right now things are really moving
I think we're really gonna have some fun

Knock knock I know you're in there
Knock knock I'm trying to get out
Knock knock I know you're hiding
I don't know if I'll be coming back
I don't know when I'll be coming back
I don't know if I'll be coming back

I think I really did it to much this time
I don't know if your coast is clear
I take a walk through the other dimension
I think I love it 'cause I sense the fear

Knock knock I'm coming in now
I'll huff and puff and blow your mind out
Knock knock I locked myself in
I don't know if I'll be coming back
I don't know when I'll be coming back
I don't know when I'll be coming back
I don't know if I'll be coming back

I don't know if I'm coming back
I don't know if I'm coming back
I don't know if I'm coming back
I don't know if I'm coming back

I don't know if I'm coming back, I'm coming for you
I don't know if I'm coming back, I know you're hiding
I don't know if I'm coming back, I know you're in there
I don't know if I'm coming back, I blow your mind out

I don't know if I'm coming back, I'm coming for you
I don't know if I'm coming back, I sense your fear
I don't know if I'm coming back, I let myself in
I don't know if I'm coming back, I blow you mind out

I don't know if I'm coming back, I blow you mind out
I don't know if I'm coming back, I blow you mind out
I don't know if I'm coming back, I blow you mind out
And I blow your mind out, I blow your mind out
I blow your mind out, I blow your mind out
I blow your mind out
