The worst pain is when a tear leaves my eye I try to fight it cause a grown man shouldn't cry
But when they start it seems I can't make it end and when I do they just start up again
I try to fight it I get in the stance it takes my strength leaves me deep in a trance
It suffocates me till I wither and wilt it's the strongest feeling I've ever felt
Feel like a block that is being whittled away but I'm still holding out for a peaceful day
Sometimes crushing sometimes subtly it weighs me down and leaves me empty
Save a peace for me
Fall to my knees past time to pray my lips are sealed shut got noting to say
I spend my time trying to forget all of the times that I felt like shit
Too many things that I did for fun now I know I should have never done
I look around there's nothing to see I look inside I'm all empty
Running on empty, so damn empty, hungry and empty, please save a peace for me
So many times I've wondered why so many times I didn't care if I'd die
I learned the things that a sane man don't know I've lived in places where the law's scared to go
I've seen lives prematurely be spent I've bent my finger with full intent
I've had more than one intended for me but I guess it wasn't meant to be
Save a peace for me save a peace for me
I look around there's nothing to see I look inside I don't like me
I spend my time trying to forget all of the times that I felt like shit
I may be proud but I need a lift I'm holding out for a fulfilling gift
When I'm warmed by an inner smile and that my soul is shining all the while
Save a peace for me, save a peace for me, save a peace for me, save a peace for me
Please save a peace for me!
