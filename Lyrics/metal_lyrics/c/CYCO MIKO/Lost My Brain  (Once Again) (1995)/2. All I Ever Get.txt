All I ever hear is nothing all I ever feel is nothing
All you ever say is nothing all I ever get is nothing
No sense to me it's just another rhyme
I try so hard but I just waste my time
All I want to get is something better
All I ever get is to wonder why
I'm on the path the cradle to the tomb
And all the way that's where my anger looms
All I want to get is something better
All I even get is a lie
All I want to get is something better
All I ever get
all I ever get is nothing all you ever say is nothing, all you ever do is nothing, all I ever get is nothing
Walk over me like I'm a silhouette
What you don't want is all that's left
All I want to get is something better, all I ever get is to wonder why
You say my best is never good enough
Put up a fight you say that I'm too tough
All I want to get is something better, all I ever get is another lie
All I want to get is something better, all I ever get
All you do for me is nothing, all I get from you is nothing, all you ever say is nothing, all I ever get is nothing
All I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I ever get is nothing. All I ever feel is nothing
All you ever say is nothing all I ever get is nothing
All I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get, all I get
All you ever say is nothing all you ever do is nothing
All you ever think is nothing, all you ever give is nothing
All you ever do is nothing, all you ever say is nothing
All you ever think is nothing, all you ever give is nothing
