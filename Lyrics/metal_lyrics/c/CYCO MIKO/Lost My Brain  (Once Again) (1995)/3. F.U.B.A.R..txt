Fubar, who are you? I used to know someone who looked like you
Fubar, what's wrong with you? You cause so many people to suffer for you
F.u.b.a.r. fubar
Fubar you're doing time the way you treat yourself is such a crime
Fubar you're outta luck what were you thinking about, you stupid fuck?
F.u.b.a.r. fubar
Fubar now there's no doubt you turned into what you were warned about
Fubar you could have been something real special will it ever end?
Fubar now it's too late you cursed yourself to a dreadful fate
Fubar rest in peace I wonder which one of us died the least
F.u.b.a.r. fubar
Fubar
