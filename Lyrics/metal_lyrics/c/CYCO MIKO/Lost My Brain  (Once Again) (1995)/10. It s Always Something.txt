It's always something
It's always something that does me wrong I try to ditch it, it tags along
It's always something of that I'm sure, but I don't know why or what they were
Facing choices I can't make living up to another mistake it's always something
Problems building up in my face the answers leave without a trace it's always something
It's always, always, always something! it's always something!
It's always something that's what I've found when I start sailing it brings me down
It's always something happens to me can't find the honey stung by the bee
It's always something that chases me I run my fastest it catches me
It's always something but never good if I could kill it you know I would
Facing choices I can't make living up to another mistake it's always something
Playing games I don't wanna play it's not worth it anyway it's always something
It's always, always, always, always, always something! it's always something
It's always something that comes my way I try to ditch it wants to play
It's always something at least I know I feel it coming I gotta go
Facing choices I can't make living up to another mistake it's always something
Problems building up in my face the answers leave without a trace it's always something
Facing choices I can't make living: up to another mistake it's always something
Playing games I don't wanna play it's not worth winning anyway it's always something
It's always (7k) something it's always something
It's always something, it's always something, it's always something and it's happening again
It's always something at least I know I feel it coming I got to go
