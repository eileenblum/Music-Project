I stood at attention didn't bother to mention the hopes in suspension it's gonna be
The key is the waiting although it gets grating without hesitating say it's gonna be alright
Drenched in hypocrisy all hardened by the lunacy but it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
The truth is not pretty and the lies they come so easily it's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Always a part of me that screams to just let it be gonna be alright, gonna be alright
When things don't go your way these three things you gotta say it's gonna be alright, alright
Three things you gotta say when things don't seem to go your way
Grasp on to sacrifice if you fear it than you better think twice it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Shame on the weaker ones when all is said and all is done it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Stand up to the enemy I heard a voice it said to me it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
I know it's been said before but when you don't think you can take no more
It's gonna be alright, alright
Three things you gotta say it's gonna be OK
Forsake the condition a mental partition stay strong to the vision it's gonna be
When life seems so weary and the future looks dreary if you listen you'll hear me say it's gonna be alright
Three things you gotta say when things don't seem to go your way
When your patience is spent just sit back and be content it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Cause when the rain goes away it's gonna be a sunny day it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Ain't got no quitter here, I'll shout it out loud and clear it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
When things don't go your way these three things I gotta say it's gonna be alright, alright
Three things I gotta say when things don't seem to go your way
When life seems so weary and the future looks dreary if you listen you'll hear me say it's gonna be alright
