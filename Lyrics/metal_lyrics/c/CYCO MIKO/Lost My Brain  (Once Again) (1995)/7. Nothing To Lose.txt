You said you knew the but way
I followed you but I don't like where it got me
So trust me when I say it yes I mean it
This is the truth there's no fine line in between it
Trust me I got nothing to lose! Trust me I got nothing to lose!

Let go let go
Let's go let's go
Let go let's go
I got nothing to lose

It's easy to choose when you've got nothing to lose!
Sometimes it seems so different
But for no reason my thoughts become indifferent
Now for too long I've lost my bearing
I pull inside but can't stop the rip and tearing
Trust me I've got nothing to lose! Trust me I've got nothing to lose!

So hard to live, so hard to breathe, so hard to smile, nothing to lose!
I hate the world, I hate my life:, I hate myself, nothing to lose!
Why can't I laugh, why can't I love, why can't I feel, nothing to lose!
This ain't no threat, this ain't a ploy, it's just a fact, nothing to lose!
It's easy to choose cause I've got nothing to lose! Nothing to lose

I got nothing to lose! ain't got nothing to lose!
It's easy to choose when you've got nothing to lose!
Hard life no I don't think so
A different time and it's just the way that things go
Maybe I got it all wrong
I shouldn't care about their problems I'll just stay strong
It's easy to choose cause I've got nothing to lose!
