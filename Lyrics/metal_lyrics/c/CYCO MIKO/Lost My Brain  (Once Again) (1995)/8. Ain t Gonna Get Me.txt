The days get long start dragging on they're out to get me
I contemplate the path of fate can't let them get me
I lost the feel it turns surreal don't let'em get me
The consequence remains in suspense ain't gonna get me!
Trey call it living I call it lies   ain't gonna get me
They call it reason I call it lies   ain't gonna get me!
Society is against me they're out to get me
To serve and protect? Yea. What the neck? Can't let them get me
They persecute but I dispute their right to get me
Not innocent but in my defense ain't gonna get me!
They call it reason I call it lies ain't gonna get me!
They call it living I call it lies ain't gonna get me!
Ain't gonna get me!
They call it reason I call it lies won't let'em get me
Pure hypocrites all full of shit   can't let'em get me!
Ain't gonna quit so deal with it won't let them get me!
Now fully grown my anger's blowing ain't gonna get me
They call it reason I call it lies   ain't gonna get me
They call it living I call it lies ain't gonna get me!
Ain't gonna get me!
Society is against me
Ain't gonna get me
