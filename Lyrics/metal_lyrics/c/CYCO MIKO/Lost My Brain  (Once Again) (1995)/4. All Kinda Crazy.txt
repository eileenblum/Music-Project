All kinda crazy, All kinda crazy
I, 2, I, I, screw you
Sitting around, thinking about getting crazy
My right and wrong start duken' it out they knock me hazy
I might not be the smartest one, but I got what it takes to get things done
Sitting around, thinking all kinda crazy
Do you really know what it's like? Yea! I know what it's like!
Sitting around fighting off thoughts of going crazy
The hate I feel makes my conscience get lazy
The urges that I feel are not new to me, been there, done it, do it easily
Sitting around, thinking all kinda crazy
Yea you say you know what it's like, I don't think you know what it's like
Do you really know what it's like? You don't wanna know what it's like
Do you really know what it's like? Now you're gonna know what it's like
All kinda crazy all kinda crazy all kinda crazy
I fuck 'n knew it my mind says just screw it
You make me the maddest I fuck 'n had it
Do you know what it's like? You don't know what it's like
Wanna know what it's like? I'll show you what it's like!
I won't sit and take it now I'm gonna break it!
Why? I have to do it there ain't nothing to it!
1, 2, 1, 2, screw you sitting around, thinking about getting crazy
The who, what, where, when, why, what? Doesn't even faze me
So you think you know what it's like? I don't think you know what it's like
All kinda crazy, all kinda crazy, all kinda crazy, all kinda
All kinda crazy
Do you know what it's like? I don't think you know what it's like
Wanna know what it's like? I'm gonna show you what its like
I'm gonna show you what it's like
All kinda crazy
