You can have the so called gifted whose test scores are the best
You can take the rich and spoiled but I want all the rest
Give me all the hungry give me all the meek
Give me all the tired give me all the weak
Cyco Miko wants you, Cyco Miko wants you
I don't set no standards but common sense is a plus
Stubbornness a bonus a little crazy is a must
What you gonna do? Cyco Miko wants you
Cyco Miko wants you
Now this one's for the ladies and let me make this clear
If you don't like how you're treated I got room for you here
If you've ever felt lonely need something to share
If you need a little comfort I know someone who'll care
Cyco Miko wants you, Cyco Miko wants you
If you've got a good heart and always back up what you say
If you can set your own agenda then come over my way
Cyco Miko wants you, Cyco Miko wants you
What you gonna do? Cyco Miko wants your
I don't give no orders I don't make no rules
I don't control nobody but I don't take no fools
Now you've heard my offer what you gonna do?
Now you've got an option Cyco Miko wants you
