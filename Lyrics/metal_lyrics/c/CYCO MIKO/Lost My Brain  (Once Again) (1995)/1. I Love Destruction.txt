Violence isn't my only option it's just what he does best!
Destruction I love destruction, destruction
Worked its way from the back of my mind
Imagination that is so unkind
I started young with the neighbor's cat
Introduced it to my baseball bat
Blow out the candles and you make a wish
I blew it up and took your happiness
It don't take much to make the assumption I love I love destruction
I love I love destruction all I need, all I need is destruction
Destruction I love destruction, destruction
Look there ain't that something looky now I blew it to nothing
Pretty people living pretty lives don't expect me to apologize
I love I love destruction all I need, all I need is destruction
And when I bleed, I bleed destruction cause I love, I love destruction
Destruction I love destruction, destruction add a little self destruction
I like to pick a special something I flick a switch and I blow it to nothing
I got a feeling that I can't resist feels so good to clench my fist
Doesn't really matter if I'm wrong or right just give me an excuse for a fight
A violent rage comes over me now I'm headed to ecstasy cause
I love destruction I love destruction all I need, all I need is destruction
And when I bleed I bleed destruction cause I love I love destruction
Destruction I love destruction, destruction I love destruction
Destruction, destruction I love destruction, destruction, destruction, I love destruction
