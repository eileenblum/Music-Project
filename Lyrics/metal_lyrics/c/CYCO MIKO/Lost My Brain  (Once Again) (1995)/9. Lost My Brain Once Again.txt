Lost my brain once again well I lost my brain once again
Yeah I lost my brain once again
Don't even know where did it go? and I don't really care
A phony smile just takes a while, and then I'm out of there
Well I'm a certified nut and my thoughts are in a rut, but I gave it all then gave it again
No cure immature no excuse blame her, why play the game if you cannot win?
Yeah I lost my brain once again yea I lost my brain once again
Spinning around, lost what I found always a part of me
Ran out of luck runaway truck it's all the same to me
I guess my brain's been jacked but I don't really want it back, if you find it just throw it away
No time reward, I got all mine, if I change my mind I'll pick up a stray
Once again I lost my brain, once again I lost my brain, once again I lost my brain
I lost my brain
Well I lost my brain once again
An empty space basket case born again lunatic
A screw is loose ripe for abuse an extra dosage of sick
I'm battered, hurt and pissed, take my pain with a twist, and I chill it with a scream on the rocks
Half full cerebral get set havoc rules, I'll drop the first person that talks
Once again, I lost my brain, once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain I lost my brain lost my brain!
Well I lost my brain once again yeah I lost my brain once again
Hole in my head that's what I said and I don't carry no spare
Don't even know where did it go? But I don't really care
I'm a purebred mutt and I know you're thinking what but I gave it all and gave it again
Insane no brain cannot contain I haven't got the time for your pain
Once again I lost my brain, once again I lost my brain, once again I lost my brain I lost my brain
I lost my brain once again
I ain't got no reason to use it no how
