Second nature instilled with pride. Honor, glory, unbroken stride.
Absence of dependence of dependence of absence. Square peg fills the void of a square hole.
Conviction and splendor, honesty unfolds.
Desperation unforgotten, far behind yet resides in the eyes of the cold.
Warm, warm contrast assaulting to the senses. Realization embrace.
Realization distaste. As if black on black, overlooked radiance, piercingly pure, frighteningly painful.
Bright ray of hope looked upon as dull.
Stricken with awe and disbelief.
Tears flow with joy, compassion, and grief.
