Come with me, take my hand and I will lift you up.
Take your pain, negate despair, bear your burdens for the rest of time.
All of this has been done already, all that's left is for you to accept it.
Put aside your selfish pride and realize what love is.
No act too wrong, no pain to great, all your sin I'll wash away.
My love was blood shed to overcome the horrors of this life.
There is emptiness in your soul.
Take my hand; trust in me, I'll fill the hole.
Take my hand; trust in me, I'll make you whole.
Take my hand; trust in me, I'll free your soul.
Take my hand; trust in me, I'll fill the hole.
