Gazing into the eyes of a new creation, the intrinsic nature of design cannot be denied.
Stonehearted, stubborn mindset locked into a foolish confidence.
Skeptical of miracles yet miracles form the foundation of the rational alternative.
"Everything arose from nothing. Limitless complexity self-induced from chaos."
Religious perspective = emotional deception, jaded belief in a creative hand.
Secular gospels inherently absurd, scientific assumptions force-fed as fact.
Scientific open mind unwilling to observe the obvious, that everything arose from nothing.
Miracles designed by the divine, implemented with authority which mankind now denies.
