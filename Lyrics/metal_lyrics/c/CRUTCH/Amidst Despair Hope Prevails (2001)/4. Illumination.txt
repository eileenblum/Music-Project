Wasting away, you fall, you fail, and I know you can't understand it.
Falling down you stay on the ground. You can't pull yourself up anymore.
Lost in the dark of duplicity, your loss only brings hate and despair.
Latent bitterness burns in your soul. Smoldering, burning from inside to out.
From experience I can tell you, when you hate you're just wasting your time.
Give your foe too much of yourself, he and destruction, you walk on the line.
Love your brother but hate the things he does to himself.
Serve one another the way you would have done to yourself.
What doesn't kill me just makes me weaker.
Logic defines your insistence to me that my faith conflicts with your reason.
My faith can illumine what you cannot see.
Watch your world crumble and fall around your ears. Denying the spirit your body will fail.
Yet the infinite reach of evil tinged logic envelops life with indelible strength.
