[Music: Tieaho | Lyrics: Moberg]

Wave the flag, of victory
Instant access, into vanity
Around your empire, a shroud of emptiness
A bridge to darkness, gloomy nothingness

Cold world of reality

Face it or break the wall of sanity
Climb over feel the bricks eating your skin
Bounce off from its hard surface
It leaves you alone in this rotten place
Dead end this madness you behold

The dark eye
In the pitch black night
Seeing all, cursing daylight
Narrow ideas, built on false perspective
Lead to dreams, illusions so addictive

No applause, everyone is gone, the scene is empty, only the clown remains

[Solo: Tieaho]

Face it or break the wall of sanity
Climb over feel the bricks eating your skin
Bounce off from its hard surface
It leaves you alone in this rotten place
Dead end this madness you behold
