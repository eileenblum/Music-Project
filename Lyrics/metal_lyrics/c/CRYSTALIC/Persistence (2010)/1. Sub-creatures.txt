[Music: Tieaho | Lyrics: Auerkallio]

You mindless fools with your thoughtless dreams
Living in sandcastle-worlds

A single wave of simple reason can wash it all away

With brains too small to construct a thought
of causal connection

Or a mind so insensitive, too cold to care

Digging a grave under our own feet
Impossible dreams, built-in destructivity
How much I'll enjoy to watch it all crumble down

A serpent-race swallowing their tails
The fangs piercing their own flesh

A symbol for the eternal circle of stupidity

Perspective corrupt by a massive lack
of comprehension

A failure to see one-self in proportion with the universe

Digging a grave under our own feet
Impossible dreams, built-in destructivity
How much I'll enjoy to watch it all crumble down

[Solo: Tieaho]

Digging a grave under our own feet
Impossible dreams, built-in destructivity
How much I'll enjoy to watch it all crumble down

Sub-Creatures!
