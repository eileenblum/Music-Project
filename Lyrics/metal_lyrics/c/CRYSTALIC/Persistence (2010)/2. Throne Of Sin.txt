[Music: Mattila, Tieaho, Tissari | Lyrics: Auerkallio]

An embodiment of purity. Soon to be defiled
Her god cannot protect her from me
Pray now every prayer you know
Soon you won't remember a single one

An angel depraved

For hours and hours without end
The whiteness of snow replaced by pure filth
Her torn body abandoned
For lesser vultures to feast on over and over again...

An angel depraved

Her bare skin, tempting me
Sit beside me, on my throne of sin

No room for redemption
Among the wicked
To pity those below you
Is to lower yourself

You let down your guard
For a blink of an eye
And you'll surely find me
Tainting your flock

[Solos: Tieaho - Mattila]

An angel depraved

Her bare skin, tempting me
Sit beside me, on my throne of sin

On my throne of sin...
