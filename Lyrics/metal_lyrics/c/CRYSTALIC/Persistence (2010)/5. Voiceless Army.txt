[Music: Tieaho | Lyrics: Moberg]

If we play this game, if we roll the dice once more
Malignant cycle of despair becomes closer every day
Stabbing constant stress, annihilating the rest
Until only power exists, showing the ugly face of this world

Raise the torch of (the) revealing light
Illuminate this horrible sight
Architects of chaos created hell
What a story to tell

Greedy scavengers on the prey
Nameless men behind the veil
Possess the knowledge that once created hell
What a story to tell

Tongues lick the poison from the same bottomless pit
Defining the future for their substantial profit
It's a cure of another kind, they have to pull the trigger
When they can't repress, all the voices that detest them

Raise the torch of (the) revealing light
Illuminate this horrible sight
Architects of chaos created hell
What a story to tell

Greedy scavengers on the prey
Nameless men behind the veil
Possess the knowledge that once created hell
What a story to tell

Inhuman behavior, an atrocity accepted on all terms

Sole witnesses lie silent on the ground
The voiceless army is lying all around

[Solos: Tieaho - Mattila - Auerkallio - Mattila]
