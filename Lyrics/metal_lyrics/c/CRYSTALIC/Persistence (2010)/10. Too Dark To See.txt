[Music: Tieaho | Lyrics: Heinonen]

I cannot dream with me, I cannot laugh with me no more
and my face in the mirror is too dark to see
I can't breath with me, I can't see myself anymore
because my face in the mirror is too dark to see

Those scars remind me how I made you cry
Your pain remains even if I die

I can't feel myself no more, is there someone behind my back
who can see this curse on me, or is it just too dark to see!
I can't take myself anymore, everything I touch falls apart
can you see this curse on me, or is it just too dark to see!

Those scars remind me how I made you cry
Your pain remains even if I die

All these questions, I'm screaming out loud
There is no one to tell me the way

[Solo: Tieaho]

I can't breath with me, I can't see myself anymore
because my face in the mirror is too dark to see
I can't feel myself no more, is there someone behind my back
who can see this curse on me, or is it just too dark to see!

Too dark to see!

Those scars remind me how I made you cry
Your pain remains even if I die

This is not the truth, this is not for real
I don't believe you 'cos you tell me lies
Everyone suffers and I am the cause
Those closest to me are fading away

Have I ever been alive?!?
