[Music: Tieaho, Tissari | Lyrics: Heinonen]

I'm losing memories, all is vanishing away.
Don't remember what it means, if you're coward or brave

My mind is crystal clear, there is nothing to fear
I am screaming through the air, no one can hear

I'm drifting on a field, between stones I parade
I see that lonely flame, The candle on my grave... NO!!!!!!!

My mind is crystal clear, there is nothing to fear
I am screaming through the air, no one can hear

I was a soldier but now I'm fallen
remember that shot to the head
I see there's an angel who's calling
And I walk away...

Life is vanishing away...

My mind is crystal clear, there is nothing to fear
I am screaming through the air, no one can hear
