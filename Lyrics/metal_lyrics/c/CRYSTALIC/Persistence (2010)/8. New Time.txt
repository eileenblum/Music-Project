[Music: Tieaho, Tissari | Lyrics: Heinonen]

The abusing traitors are falling
You're climbing the stairs to the throne
Leave that old useless life. Burn the bridges behind
Create your new life, write the new one.
The story of new time

If you break the mirror of your soul
and those memories from your past
see the future when it comes
but don't look back

Raise your head and make them pay
turn the page from your book of life
Create the future with your own way
forget the past, and walk the new line, the new line

[Solo: Tieaho]

The abusing traitors have fallen
You've ascended and taken the throne
You left that old useless life. Bridges are burning behind
created a new life, wrote the new one. The story of new time

If you hide in the shadows of your life
You will go down with them
And all the traitors, they'll stand up and shine
If you'll let them

When you feel like there's nothing left for you
turn the page from your book of life
There is always more things to do
forget the past, and walk the new line, the new line
