[Music: Tieaho | Lyrics: Heinonen]

Light, is fading from my eyes
Sorrow, is blinding my own mind
Those secrets I couldn't keep inside
Something's made me open my mind for the lie!
I can't rewind...

Wait! There's something you should know
Hate! is one that makes me grow
The fear is driving you insane
You lose your mind and it will make you cry,
again you lie...

Let me feel your knife again
Before you send me to death
Are you ready to detonate
This Blastbeat of my heart

You'll see the power in me!
see the fire in my eyes!
see your self burning!
Your not hurting me!
My heart is beating...
Faster and faster again...

[Solos: Mattila - Tieaho]

You'll see the power in me!
see the fire in my eyes!
see your self burning!
Your not hurting me!
My heart is beating...
Faster and faster again...

Let me feel your knife again
Before you send me to death
Are you ready to detonate
This Blastbeat of my heart
