[lyrics: Moberg, music: Tieaho]

Patience has to end
When you live your life hands tied
Suffering from oppression, inside lies
Maddening - feeling grows
Plunging into the depths of rage
Marching towards freedom through hate

Persistence of memory
Not fading away
Defiance of supremacy
Darkening thoughts remain

Spawn of evil inside of us all
Waiting just to hear a death call
A simple will to push minds up to the limit
When everything is lost, what is left to give in?

Fiery character
Revolting against the wind
Evoking images of an inferior tomorrow:
"The land of hope will not come,
Our freedom cannot be won"
Misery pulled the anger out
Hate replaced fear and doubt
