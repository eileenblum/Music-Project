[lyrics: Moberg, music: Tieaho]

Unseen depravity
Born within a twisted mind
A full scale of madness
The pursuit of perfection
A gene that will cease evolution for one race

World ablaze again
Will history repeat itself in the end?
Will one man terminate life with virology
Bleak times come to amplify the growing misery

"This is a favour to mankind
To abolish poisonous minds,
A virus that will replicate and mutate
In their system for days."
Choke, bleed, spasm until your life is erased

Sensitive touch of evil
Science and art blended in
A new discovery to kill a man
A profound idea, a complicated plan based on a simple thought

So easy to manipulate (the masses)
The most damaging weapon is the media
Words leading everyone astray
Into comfort in the midst of horror
