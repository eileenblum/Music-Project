[lyrics: Moberg, music: Tieaho]

Dream a world, that couldn't exist
Where night is a day and silence is bliss
Where the thin veil of lies is drawn away
Where promises are meant to stay
Affection the only need
Given away, without greed
Shared moments of joy amongst them all
Laughter and laughter on and on

So bless the child cause he did not know
This breed is no different from it's foes
You can see the glow in his eyes
Determined will to solve mysteries of life
What is beyond all good when it dies?

If dream continues you will see
Little cracks on this unreality
Vibes that never been felt before
Thoughts that cloud the minds of hordes
Affection turns to lust
Taken by force at any cost
Individual needs take control
Laughter and laughter on and on

So bless the child cause he did not know
This breed is no different from it's foes
You can see the glow in his eyes
Determined will to solve mysteries of life
What is beyond all good when it dies?

The elders stand and watch the spree
Younger ones shatter their dreams
Endless desire, everflowing rage
Carnival of flesh, consuming pain
Now all we see are desolate plains
Once so fertile, rich and tame
Now there is something wicked that exists
Evil circle, closed fists

Worlds collide, a new faith is a tool of doom
It is a rage of the blind men whose shattered unique bloom
