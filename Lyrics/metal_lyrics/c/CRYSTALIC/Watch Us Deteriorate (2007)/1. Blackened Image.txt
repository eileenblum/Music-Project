[lyrics: Moberg, music: Tieaho]

The fury lives in every soul, it's hard to let it go
We are chained to a norm, a vortex of life
There is a beginning, there is an end
To every story we cannot mend
Relentlessly we hold on to our faith
But easily like ashes it's blown away

I know it's not easy to go on
Without courage
Without knowledge
Tread on the unknown a risk too high to take
When you're a pawn, predator and prey

Sell your mind, sell your thoughts
Ways to go, ways to choose
How come you know you're not abused?
When it all seems so clear and smooth
Time is short, short is the fuse
Disposable human, there are no rules
Mind killing routine wears you out
You will see it
When all that's left is
A Blackened Image

Gather up your ideas of philosophy
Seize that golden opportunity
