[lyrics: Moberg, music: Tieaho]

A prison without walls
Is your home
Virtual penitentiary
No padded cells, no bars to hold you in
No chance to taste or breathe
Everything taken away, even the chance to dream

Severe punishment to keep wretched lives locked in
Severe punishment, a modern technology to ban your sins
Severe punishment more evil than evil itself

Trapped in for no reason
One flaw, never corrected
Convicted, files erased
Abandoned forever
