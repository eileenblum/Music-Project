[lyrics: Moberg, music: Tieaho]

Dare not falter
On the edge of lucidity
Let an emotion lead you
Away from sanity
Into the garden of fulfillment
A wanted moment
Seems to last forever
Bursting joy, constant fever
Brightest light of all, the most seducing fall

If deepest emotions are born
In every twist of life
Then I find myself searching for
Those dramatic turns

Who will predict?
Who will know?
Where will I go?
The passage I roam
Random events lead our way
Uncontrollable faith will decide our days

Do not compromise
Or clean your wounds
Live for the moment
In the middle of the bloom
In the garden of fulfillment
A wanted moment
Soon to be vanished
Dead cold emotion, nothing to cherish
The Blackest of black I behold, in the mirror of soul
