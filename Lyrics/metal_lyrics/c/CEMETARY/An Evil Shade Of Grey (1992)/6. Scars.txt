Once upon a time
a time far past
you broke my heart
and broken it would last...

You left your scars
and your scars run deep
I think of you as I weep

But soon the sorrow evolves
into the purest love
a love to see you dying
my angel from above

Days filled with confusion
nights of endless search
in horror you will be weltering as I emerge

What you did to me
now comes to you
in an act of love
I will run you through

I leave my scars
and my scars run deep
with a grin I turn around
and I leave you bleeding on the ground
