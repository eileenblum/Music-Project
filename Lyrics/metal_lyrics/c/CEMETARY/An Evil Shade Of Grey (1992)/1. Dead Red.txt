Thru the maze
I run in hope to die
but of death there is no trace
until the dead red catches my eyes
a hide and seek until eternity
this game I will never complete
until I am free from the grip of time
I am trapped in the losers seat

My growing fear is uncontrolled
as I tremble in perspiration
but I know in the end the dead red will unfold
and that is my only consolation

Colour of head
my ever sworn enemy
blind I search the red
which I am unable to find
but as the voices said
in the hours of my life
to eternity you shall be led
with pain in your eyes

The game shall continue
eternity won't be long
and on the edge we will know who won
or shall it be none
I found it at the end of time

It did not glow is did not shine
its time had come and so had mine
it turned around and stared at me
with eyes of black this could not be
in that moment of truth the lie did die
the stars went black
and then went I

"Revel within your time
but make it last an eternity
because life is not all
that is going to be"
