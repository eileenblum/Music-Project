A journey thru the cold breath of time
searching the insanity of mine
mourning as I dwell among no laughter
hoping my existance ends hereafter

Astray the bridge I burned
to where sorrows fade
this torment now I earned

Emptiness is character of my destiny
my soul is drained and nowhere is
where I will be

Shadows... Of starlike blackened fire
taking... This soul to its loathsome trial

Thru astral layers the voyage goes on
perished among the stars
forever to be gone
to where nothing is and nothing was
...and their whispers greet my loss

In the watery mirror of destiny
I can not see my own reflection
thru the dead halls of infinity
I hear them sing for me
