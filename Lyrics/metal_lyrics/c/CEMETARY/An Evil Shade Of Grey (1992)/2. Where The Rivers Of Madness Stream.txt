Take me to the other side
beyond this world I know
thru madness eternal falls
my sanity will flow

Here I will be
where the rivers of madness stream
down the gules to a pit of dream

My sanity defiled
now I leave behind
to plaines immortal
I unleash my mind

Here I am not lost
these sights are not strange to me
and I shall not dwell alone
within my insanity

"Though dead I seem
I will live forever within my dream
for beyond the lakes of sanity
our dreams become reality"
