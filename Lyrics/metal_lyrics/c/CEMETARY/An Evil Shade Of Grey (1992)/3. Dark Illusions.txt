Memories of loss
memories of fear
are the ones you shall wake
up to my darkest dear

Down into the depths
of your minds wonderland
breathing the air, tasting the fruits
you are feeding from my hand

I guide you beyond yourself
your eyes are blinded by desire
come into my world...
welcome to fire

You are screaming in pain
as I am laughing in ecstasy
forever branded you will be
