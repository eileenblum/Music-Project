Within the cave of sleep
lies the horrid ones in the deep
in a city just to be found
within the dreams of unholy ground

So sleep between these sheets of chill
and sleep forever is what you will
like a silent voice from a memory
these waves of slumber are drowning thee

Hear the lake
it is calling thee
to be part of the dreaming city

So do not fear these waves of horrid sleep
as you disappear into the deep
Hear the lake it is calling thee
so follow the cantor to the dreaming city

Now you are sinking glow
to the city that awaits below
because your sanity can not forsake
the horrors within the lake
