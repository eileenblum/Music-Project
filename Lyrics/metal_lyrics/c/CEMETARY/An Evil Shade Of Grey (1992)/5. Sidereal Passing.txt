Into the dome of stars
my astral entity finds its way
a cosmic cede to the worlds of paths astray

Behind stellar veils I search
but what I search I do not know
let me see the light of guidance
onto where I me seeds shall sow

Falling stars gently touch my mind
as they leave fragments of light
which a lit the worlds to find

But this light is soon to fade
extinguished by a loathsome breeze
though in me there is a light
that shall never cease

On my sideral path
past horrors are emerging
I fear but still I laugh
the laughter of a king...
