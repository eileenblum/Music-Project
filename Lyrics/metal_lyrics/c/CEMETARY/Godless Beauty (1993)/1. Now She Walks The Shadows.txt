[Music - Lodmalm/Sievers]
[Lyrics - Lodmalm]

All but gone
Her laughter still burns
Burden black,rosen red
The setting sun becomes her

Now she walks the shadows
Now she haunts the night

Nocturnal Queen
Forbidden fruit
Curse the light,bring forth the dark
True beauty erased by sunlight

Now she walks the shadows
Now she haunts the night

Ill the flesh
Longing night
May the last dawn now enter
...And the sun to drown in sin

Now she walks the shadows
Now she haunts the night
