[Music/Lyrics - Lodmalm]

Darker shade, darker breed
Darker thought, darker need
Pure in heart, clean in soul
Dead in life, empty hole

Black is the veil that hides our tears
Black is our life thru all its years
Black is our soul as it leaves the earth
Black is the child that awaits its birth

Angelworld, dying sky
Beautiful one in dirt to die
Scarecrow child alone to sing
That R &amp; B, the hangman's swing

Black is the veil that hides our tears
Black is our life thru all its years
Black is our soul as it leaves the earth
Black is the child that awaits its birth

Darker shade, darker breed
Darker thought, darker need
Scarecrow child alone to sing
That R &amp; B, the hangman's swing

Black is the veil that hides our tears
Black is our life thru all its years
Black is our soul as it leaves the earth
Black is the child that awaits its birth
