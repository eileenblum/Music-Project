[Music/Lyrics - Lodmalm]

Adrift and forlorn
Disguised and unborn
The night is crawling inside
The little left of joy and pride

Thorns...
Carve the wounds
Thorns...
Art in my flesh

Twilight red
My veins are screaming
Laughter dead
The thorns are gleaming
Scarlet sea
Godless temper
Never again shall I be me

Burning skin
A fruit so sour
The illness within
To my soul devours

Thorns...
Carve the wounds
Thorns...
Art in my flesh

Twilight red
My veins are screaming
Laughter dead
The thorns are gleaming
Scarlet sea
Godless temper
Never again shall I be me

The night has crawled inside
Nothing left of joy and pride
Scarlet for me
Scarlet for you

Thorns...
Carve the wounds
Thorns...
Art in my flesh

Twilight red
My veins are screaming
Laughter dead
The thorns are gleaming
Scarlet sea
Godless temper
Never again shall I be me
