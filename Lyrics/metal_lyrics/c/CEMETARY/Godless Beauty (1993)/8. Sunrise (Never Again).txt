[Music - Lodmalm/Hedberg]
[Lyrics - Lodmalm]

Creature
Sinner
Evil
Lullaby from hell
Wishing well

I am the night, the dreams of blood
The claws that shred the sun
...the night, the weeping moon
Enemy...,Father

Feeble whore
Dying sun
Farewell
The sky turns red
The sun is dead
Victory

I am the night, the dreams of blood
The claws that shred the sun
...the night, the weeping moon
Enemy...,Father
"As the last drop of blood
Falls down from the sky
The children greet the darkness
With open arms
Their father has returned"

Sunrise never again
Creature
Warlord
Father

I am the night, the dreams of blood
The claws that shred the sun
...the night, the weeping moon
Enemy...,Father
