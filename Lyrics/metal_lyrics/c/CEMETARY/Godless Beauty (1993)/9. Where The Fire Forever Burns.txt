[Music/Lyrics - Lodmalm]

My sweet caress of fire
Burns gently thru your hair
You and I forever
In a burning lair
And the fire shall dance just for us
So come with me, we shall never return
Let me show you my Eden
Where the fire forever burns

Don't be afraid
These flames won't harm you now
But if you want a way
Or deny my love
Those flames shall burn your wings
Sweet little dove

Don't ever leave
There is no need to fly away
I'm all you want and could ever need
All I want is you to stay

And forever pleasing me with love
Telling me I'm the only one
And the fire is your home
But if not so you will burn
Trust me you will burn
And in my arms once again
You shall never be

You began to play with fire
To see if it burned
And so it did time after time
You longed for someone else

Don't ever leave
There is no need to fly away
I'm all you want and could ever need
All I want is you to stay

Flying so high, oh so high on virgin wings
As the fire below climbs higher and begins to sing
It sings of a dove so eager for love
But who still wants to fly to another one
(Fly away)...In my flames you shall perish

"Burning love, burning dead
A light you'll never forget"

And you had to leave
Why I do not know
But deep inside (deep inside)
I know you're sorry

"My sweet caress of fire
Burns gently thru your hair
You and I forever
In a burning lair
And the fire shall dance just for us
So come with me, we shall never return
Let me show you my Eden
Where the fire forever burns"
