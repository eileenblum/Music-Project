[Music/Lyrics - Lodmalm]

The way I see may make you blind
The way I think may scar your mind
And evil are the words I speak
I am sin and sin you seek

Begging...
Thirsting...
Feeding...
...My hunger never at ease

Seduce/deceive
Go hand in hand
In my eyes they're the same
And you always knew
And you still beg
For the serpent's kiss

Do you dare to taste my soul
Do you dare among the serpent's roll
And to wed their eyes and lick their tongues
I am them and your flesh is young

Crawling close
I'm the one you fear
But when I'm gone
You wish me near

Seduce/deceive
Go hand in hand
In my eyes they're the same
And you always knew
And you still beg
For the serpent's kiss

You tasted me
I tasted you
Your naked flesh
Your life undo

Seduce/deceive
Go hand in hand
In my eyes they're the same
And you always knew
And you still beg
For the serpent's kiss
