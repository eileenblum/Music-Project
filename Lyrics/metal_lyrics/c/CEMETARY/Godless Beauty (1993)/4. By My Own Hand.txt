[Music/Lyrics - Lodmalm]

Who was I or was I really there
You didn't seem to know you didn't seem to
Grew tired of being the nameless one
So I did what had to be done
Washed away the filth
From your sins I am clean
The sins never forgiven
Not even in hell you'll walk unseen

I couldn't put faith in me
I couldn't put faith in God
The only faith I found
Was in the knife that spilled my blood

In tears I laughed
As the blade slowly tore my veins
At last I was free
Free from all my pains
Now it's too late
For you to touch my lips with yours
And say you're sorry
'Cause my heart don't beat no more
And all that's left is what you'll bury

Worms now crawl in me
Crawling in my bones
They're the best friends
And they enjoy my company
Six feet under there's a paradise
Within wooden walls my Eden lies

I couldn't put faith in me
I couldn't put faith in God
The only faith I found
Was in the knife that spilled my blood

In tears I laughed
As the blade slowly tore my veins
At last I was free
Free from all my pains
Now it's too late
For you to touch my lips with yours
And say you're sorry
'Cause my heart don't beat no more
And all that's left is what you'll bury

Close those empty eyes
Forgive yourself but never life
Wash away the filth
Here comes the knife

In tears you laugh
As the blade slowly tears your veins
Read the blood
Read the truth within the stains
The shame you feel is turning into grace
And you're greeting death with a smile on your face
