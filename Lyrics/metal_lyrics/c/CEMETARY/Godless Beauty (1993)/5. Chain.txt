[Music/Lyrics - Lodmalm]

Days of torment
Days of truth
Living hell
Buried youth

Life is here
Life is dead
Hollowed eyes
Zombie head
Born in dirt
Sin and pain
Always to wear
A fucking chain

Tear my face
Who am I
Behind the mask
Smiles the lie

Life is here
Life is dead
Hollowed eyes
Zombie head
Born in dirt
Sin and pain
Always to wear
A fucking chain

"Bleeding in my hands
Bitter and sour
Lies the holy life
Long passed the hour
Awakening,ascending
Naked on the floor

In a cracked mirror I face the truth
The fact That I am nothing"

Orphan...crawl to your cross
Orphan...receive your chain

Days of torment
Days of truth
Living hell
Buried youth

Life is here
Life is dead
Hollowed eyes
Zombie head
Born in dirt
Sin and pain
Always to wear
A fucking chain
