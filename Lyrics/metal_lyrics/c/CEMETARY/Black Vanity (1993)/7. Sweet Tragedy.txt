Faceless I am dying
Upon a withered Earth
Pain gave me silence
And pain gave mi birth
Lifeless I am falling
Into a room of ice
At ease inside my prison
Saved from bitter lies

The dust I leave behind...
A shadow you must wear
Feel the darkness in your mind
And the cold despair...

Flashing through my memory
The emptiness I hide
Losing all desire
Losing all but pride
The bridges all are burning
Nothing left to see
The world now stands in ruin
Come sweet tragedy
