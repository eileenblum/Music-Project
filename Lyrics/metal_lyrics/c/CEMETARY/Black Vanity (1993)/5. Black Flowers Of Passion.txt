Kneeling before the carnal demon machine
On hands and knees she shallows divinity
Begging for forgiveness, the blessing of a kiss
The essence of denial, the pleasure of her sin

Father please embrace me
My lusts I lay unto thee
Free me from temptation
May you scourge this skin with the seeds of salvation

She's crying beneath an image
An image of a hundred thorns
Rivers that calm, rivers that lie
Thorns like nails driven into her flesh
Ecstacy nailed to the cross

Holy water pouring on my breasts
On hands and knees I shallow divinity
A picture that calms, a picture that lies
I'm drowning in the face of Jesus Christ
