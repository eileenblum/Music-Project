Drowning in the sunset's lullaby
Sleeping in the womb of the firefly
Floating in a sequence frozen still
The liquid reaper mover in for the kill

Standing by the shore
Last departure cannot wait no more
(soon to close its doors)
A farewell in grey
See all the lost ones now march away
(serpentine parade)

The end of forever
The last wave of the cosmic sea
Manifestation of the never
A last sting of the honey bee

Floating in a sequence frozen still
The liquid reaper mover in for the kill
Fail to breath inside my hollow shell
Felt no sorrow as the curtain fell
