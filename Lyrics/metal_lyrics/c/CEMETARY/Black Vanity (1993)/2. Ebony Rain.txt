The sinners masquerade
An asylum for the weak
A feast for the wolf
Our faces lost in the deep
Empty space our souls to keep

The hour of twilight
As silent as sin
Drifting beyond dreaming
Erasing all therein
Into black nightmare
Cry in vain
The eyes set sail
Towards ebony rain

The mirror cease to live
Images all gone
Cutting through our hearts
A slice of ended life
Will our memories stain the knife
