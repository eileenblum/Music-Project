Judgement ground
Overdrive of sympathy
Withdraw the rats from the beast
...Onto therapy

Obsession leaves you weak
Still you're the beauty we all seek
Rainy days will pass on by
Rosemary taste the sky
A widow of belief
Still your morning sense no grief
Rainy days will pass on by
Rosemary taste the sky

Mirror of a twisted fate
Slide into...
A whisper from an opium dream
Just for you
