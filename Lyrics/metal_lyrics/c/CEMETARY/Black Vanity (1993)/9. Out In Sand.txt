Incomplete... (a state I knew)
Dry as dust... (the thirst of few)
Once a chill but now it's fear
Fell the numb drawing near

Out of reach from human touch
What walks the earth now ain't much
Left alone to claim the guilt
Out in sand my life's been split

In my lungs grows the pain
Violet days won't come again
The waiting act's gone too far
The screen is blank where we are

Dry as dust... (the thirst of few)
The days so numb that I once knew
