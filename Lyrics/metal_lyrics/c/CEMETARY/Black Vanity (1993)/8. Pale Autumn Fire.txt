"The autumn came and the leaves fell
Like raindrops from heaven
Like sinners to hell
For every drop a sin was earned.
For every leaf a sinner burned."

Bodies form the pattern of everlasting sin
Embrace the flesh and tame the blood
That pounds the veins therein

In the ashes that they crawl
All dreams are shattered
The flames will never be the same
In the ashes that they crawl
So does desire
Before the pale autumn fire

The needle's creeping downwards
And the scars bleed in my soul
Upon the weakened limbs I spit
And now I've crushed you every goal

In the ashes that they crawl
All dreams are shattered
The flames will never be the same
In the ashes that they crawl
You found desire
Dead in the pale autumn fire
