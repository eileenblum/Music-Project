Would not call it lonely
Like the circles interact
Wish her world is lonely
They kept that cancer off my back

Drowning in the sewer
Drowning slowly with out a face
How I wish I knew her
Before she lost the golden race

Here in my eyes
Lives her remain
Your ashy smiles are growing all alone

Doctors, doctors, ??
Last the fire lost control
Did it really matter?
To whom and why you sold your soul
Could not hold the power
The thrashing, retching, all within
Last the ?? shot her
So sad you sorrow baby friend

Here in my eyes
Lives her remain
Your ashy smiles are growing all alone
