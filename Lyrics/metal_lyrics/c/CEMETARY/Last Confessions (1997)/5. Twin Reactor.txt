As lightning strikes
And shadows burn
They come in the night
Now for darkness they yearn
The fear of the demon
Is coming to please
The thing got me begging
Got me down on my knees

I don't know
And you don't know
The way it's gotta be
You say that the times are gone
It won't be long
They take it all from me
I'll be waiting on down

It's foul and it's twisted
It's not from above
It claws and it slithers
It can't feel no love
It's crime is it's passion
It's hungry for more
It rips and it tears
Now it's reaching the core

I don't know
And you don't know
The way it's gotta be
You say that the times are gone
It won't be long
They take it all from me
I'll be waiting on down
