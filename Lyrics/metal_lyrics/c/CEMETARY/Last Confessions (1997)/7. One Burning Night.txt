Some might call me a sinner
Some might call me a saint
The beast may hound
The beast may roam
Now you know what lurks inside
When you please me

One burning night
One death inside
One dream to live
One life to give
In the shodows I hide
Wanna slip inside
You know my name
You will know my name

Some might call me a sinner
Some might call me a saint
The beast may hound
The beast may roam
Now you know what lurks inside
When you please me

One burning night
One death inside
One dream to live
One life to give
In the shodows I hide
Wanna slip inside
You know my name
You will know my name

Gone the wall is black
Reach the end no turnin back
Much closer to the truth
Suspended in the corpse of youth

One burning night
One death inside
One dream to live
One life to give
In the shodows I hide
Wanna slip inside
You know my name
You will know my name
