Colder now then ever
The rebel walks without you here
Take my share of bleeding
Means nothing to me
Don't care about your saddness
Don't want to make your life my own
Heart of stone within me
The first to pull you down

Don't you come come come caress me now
Your feeble body fuels the flames of lonliness somehow
The closer that you crawl
Just the further I will fall
Can't keep me from dying
Can't save me at all

Body down at zero
Carying around a loaded gun
Can't go on the way it's heading now
Looks rather thin
How I wish I had not opened
The door so you could step right in
And crush whatever's left of me
The blood looks rather thin
