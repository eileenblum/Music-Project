It's all lost It's all gone
Once so proud once so strong
Watch the ashes roll away
The pain that I portray

The emotions rage
All black within
Crawling on ice so thin
Can you know who sees
Within the carbon heart

Done with fear Done with guilt
The dreams so sweet in this cage i've built
The final layer has been peeled
Nothing left to feel

The emotions rage
All black within
Crawling on ice so thin
The burning rose won't let it go
Lost all sense of pride swallow the cianide
Can you know who sees
Within the carbon heart [2 times]
