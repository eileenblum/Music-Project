The beast is bound to end us all
Burning red the dragon souls
Oh wow this maddness lacks in skill
Aim to please Baby shoot to kill
Straight the sky just turns like ash
Burning fever G-nome splash
oh oh oh wo wo hey hey hey
Close it down take it away

Gone Forever, Gone Forever
Gone Forever, Gone Forever now [2 Times]

Sweet salvation pentagram
Make you suffer make you mine
Oh wow this pounding in my brain
Overdriven can't explain
Supernova afterglow
Chase the dragon fear the soul
Pilot down slowly burn
Cosmic trigger one last turn

Gone Forever, Gone Forever
Gone Forever, Gone Forever now [2 Times]

Sweet salvation afterglow
pentagram fear the soul
oh wow this maddness lacks in skill
got a cosmic trigger and I shoot to kill
Supernova just like ash
Strange to stand this violent flash
oh oh oh wo wo hey hey hey
Close it down take it away

Gone Forever, Gone Forever
Gone Forever, Gone Forever now [2 Times]

This is as close as humanly possible (Jason).
