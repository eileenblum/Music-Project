Im the living nightmare
Im the sickness in your heart
Unholy ally
The saddness that won't part
The crossbone Dagger
A curse upon your soul
Crawling nightchild
Let the sad times roll

A violent fever
A silence robbing me
A night stalker
Beside the grain I reap
The other bleeding
Hiding in your mind
A local Stranger
Burning rain that leaves you blind

[This Next part is buried in the mix]
