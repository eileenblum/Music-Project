I remember walking into that room
That very time, that very moment
Seeing you there, just felt like dying
Trying hard not to break apart
All for something, all for nothing
Is this the thanks I get ?
Once for all, thought you saw it all
But you've seen nothing yet


And in that very moment

You went way down cold in my eyes
