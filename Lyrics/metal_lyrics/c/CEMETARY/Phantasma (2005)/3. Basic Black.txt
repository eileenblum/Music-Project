Did you lose you way or did you lose your mind
A blacklight rush, blacklight fever, keep it on the hush
There's no ignition
Just constant repetition

Basic black and darker gray
Hold that thought then come what may
It's so unreal, what your heart can't feel
Basic black and darker red
All God's children wind up dead
It's so damn real, what your veins reveal

Sample your final breath, the end
This is a game of death my friend
So pyrotechnic, still a sceptic ?
This is the end
In here we're all insane
In here we all discovered pain
