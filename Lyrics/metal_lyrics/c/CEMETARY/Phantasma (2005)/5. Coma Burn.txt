So you say it hurts now
Hurts like hell
So you're giving birth now
Life in hell
Give it all you've got now
Twist and turn
Missed your every shot
'Cause baby you're born to burn

Coma
Life in coma
So sad I know ya
Coma
Life in coma
You've got that dead aroma

Home is where the horror is
Blow you all away
There're ain't no touching this
Get it pound for pound
Take you round for round
There's gonna be a blood shower
As your body hits the ground
Catch a wave of bullets along the watchtower
Ride that dose of venom
This is the witching hour
