I come alone
Watch you come alone
Much better on our own
Right here sucking on our bones
You faked your time
But baby I did mine
So you stayed behind and watched me cross the line

Corrupt your body baby
The dead body of Christ
You're 2nd last to nowhere
But I guess that's alright

You track the days that tracked your veins
In u-turn - Your tires burn
Of many shapes, in many places
It's leaving marks, it's leaving traces
