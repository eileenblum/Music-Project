It's quite alright down here
It's quite a feel down here
See I ain't going nowhere
Well I'm so sincere
It's such a fight down here
And it's all tight down here
You'll feel the might down here
Finally I see clear

Lost all the same so I'm going with what I know
I'm losing myself in that wavecell down below
Lost all the same so I'm going with what I know
I'm drowning myself in that wavecell down below

It's kinda cold down here
But they leave me alone down here
Flickering lights down here
Far from god, far from everywhere
It's such a ride down here
No need to stand aside down here
You'll watch me feed down here
Well I ain't going nowhere

Lost all the same so I'm going with what I know
I'm losing myself in that wavecell down below
Lost all the same so I'm going with what I know
I'm killing myself in that wavecell down below
