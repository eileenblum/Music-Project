and now it has been done
your nightmare had me fooled
tragedy all gone and overruled
your world is dry of pleasure
your world is full of pain
and when the curtain falls
will you do it all again?

fevered eclipse
silence released
call of the wild
cyclone revolution
hours of despair
cease to exist
call of the wild

I found revelation
the moment that you failed
the moment of truth
a time to betray
these chains have long been broken
weakness left the bone
static recreation cut in stone

fools are left to wonder
the blind are left to seek
silent soul - silent speak
counting all the pieces
blood and broken glass
this time it won't come to pass
