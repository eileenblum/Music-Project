there's a new dawn coming
coming down in flames
there's a new thought burning
and it's fire can't be tamed
an illusion shattered
cuts its way inside
reduced to nothing
you're doomed within your lie

come on in
this nightmare's just for you so feel no shame
it's all yours for you to breath - for you to live
there is no present but the past
your creation - watch it burn

there's a new seed growing
growing in their minds
there's new hate breeding
a dagger from behind
now the new word echoes
a word set in stone
did anyone cry when sympathy died alone?

second coming
yet its all the same
the lies are ruling
masters of the game
forever fallen
puppet on a string
born the loser
soon the bells of death will ring
