slither inside
can't go where I hide
so delicate and weak
you dare not collide
the truth in me
too dark to see
so bitter the taste
now the poison runs free

on the dream that you once rode
now your visions all corrode
you're the one that sent me
would I betray?
when all hope is gone and the damage done
I'm still alive
the addiction's strong
you can't erase me
won't go away

of hatred and scorn
of the heart that's been torn
from a darkened womb
in your dreams I was born
the first and the last
out of the past
one final solution
now its coming down fast
