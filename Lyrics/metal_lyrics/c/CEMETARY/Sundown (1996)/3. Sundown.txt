our final stand
the last command
our journals final entry
you did so well
none left to tell
about the damnation you brought on

bring down the damned
the blood is on your hands
as the sun sets forever

no saving grace
all out of place
went down in a sea of neon
the desperate lust
in what we trust
now rests in the arms of failure
