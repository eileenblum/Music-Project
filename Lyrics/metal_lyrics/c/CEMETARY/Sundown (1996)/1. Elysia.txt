visionaire - silverscreen
distant mirrors all I see
shadows dancing closer
dripping from the orb

master of misery
well, it's all said and done
hallucinations scream
yes, I will swallow the sun

no warmth within my heart
the blood upon my door
the demon's free at last
please let me drown the past

thunderbolt - scorpio
13 nails into the soul
bleeding - kneeling down now
clutcing at the straws

can't keep the mind from slipping
further into the dark
hold back the breathing
lead in my lungs
