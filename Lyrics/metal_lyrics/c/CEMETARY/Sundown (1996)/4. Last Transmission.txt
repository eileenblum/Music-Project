cannot ease the fever flaming in your eyfs
can't close out the frequence lusting for the lie
when your depression slowly leaves
the world around you starts to burn
won't feel it coming
won't feel anything at all

last transmission

way down in seclusion - the icon of your fear
let your eyes believe you see it all so clear
desperation is the only thing you couldn't live without
can you hear them screaming?
no, can't hear anything at all
