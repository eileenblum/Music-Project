deeper down - suck the sorrow dry
wading thru the sewage that you left behind
the torture is slow
I could not pull the weight of the ache that I've been delt
this bullet is for you

beneath the dirt lives a different kind
crackhead queens - deception kings
the unborn child nobody wants
rub the salt into my wounds with passion and a smile
enter my domain - closer to the pain
