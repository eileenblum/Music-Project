domination, destruction, extermination
the evil power
invades with fury
the human heart

the darkness is coming
the legion of hate
domains who doesn't know the truth

black winds of death
devastate your minds
black winds of death
devastate your soul

bloody storm fire
the fire is over
that fight against
the divine truth

are your yes hurt
by the fire of hell
blood, pain, against
torments of soul
the suffering is in
the reign of shadows
