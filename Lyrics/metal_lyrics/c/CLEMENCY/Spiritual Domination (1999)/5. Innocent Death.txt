anguish, despair
the death of the innocent
without a choice life
hastation of the misfortune

one more violent act against
who can do nothing
do defends himself

a safe place becomes
the most dangerous
drained blood of cruel act

pulled up of the world
tortured until the death
to hurt or to cure
to kill or to let live

give valve the life
you don't excuse them
to eliminate it
