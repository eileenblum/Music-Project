spreading love and peace
bringing hate and destruction
with falses promises
hiden behinds lies

the wait comming to the end
dreams drestroyed
from a goal not reached
the darkness

pain, aguish, destruction
the darkness will come
and the light won't exist anymore
and everybody claim for salvation

the vermim will cover you
in the deepest precipice
the promise is broken
you failed he's coming
