and you now?
and now the light is off?
and you are still
alone in the dark

screams of anguish are heard
in all instants feeling cry

where are you?
do something he hears your screaming
so why don't you respond
do you think he with all this?

you try to ignore
but there's no way to scape

don't denied the truth
there's light
the end of the tunnel
jesus christ
and darkeness around you
a narrow path to follow
and you naw?
