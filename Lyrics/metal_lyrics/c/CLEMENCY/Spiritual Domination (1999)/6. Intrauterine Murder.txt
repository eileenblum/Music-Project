it's frightening the rate of victins
of a pre-natal murderer
clandestine clinics and phisicians
decide the begining and the end of a life

abortion a world characterized by the imortality
of people without any responsability
the consequence of an irrational deed

abortion a cheathing deed that promise
relief and soluction of a shameful act
but the truth is that it leaves sequels
and a silent cry-self-acusation

abortion causes aplinters that enters
the conscience threatening to do
away with reason an the whorth of life
conscience, let's abort abortion
