Narrative of the climax
brother of performed acts
illness afflicts Lazarus
remaining place of rest

Lazarus lies

Sickness of the undeath
glorified through wrath
awaken the received
performance to believe
master and disciples
past mortal arrival
placed into the Earth
promise of rebirth

Lazarus dies

Lack of presence questioned
disturbed in reaction
weeping instruction
removal tomb obstruction

Crying voice commands
from the grave ascend
bounding burial garments
return to life present

Lazarus rise

Theme of life dominates
Resurrection integrates
exchanging the deceased
life gained through belief
