You say you come to me
because of the blood I shed
but deep down inside it was
of circumstances instead

Because of this bleeding you let
this hopeless cadaver of flesh
you would not forget
redeemed, purified while justified

Blood is the only covering to atone
your life link found in His blood
not from circumstances along
from death freedom gained eternally

there is no answer to this cancer
and smell of rotting flesh
only pure blood will heal the wounds
and embalms Christ within

The Prince of Peace given in carnage butchery
bloodstained and broken for you
let Him spill that precious flow
all over to make us whole
