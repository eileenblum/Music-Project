Lord forgive me for my sins
cleanse me of my unrighteousness
I worship and praise your holy name

I ask for strength to resist temptation
I ask for wisdom in all things
cover me with your blood, and fill me with your spirit
make me your disciple
I thank you for your love, your grace, and forgiveness
for who you are and what you've done
Jesus Christ
who loved us so much, you took the penalty for our sins

Lord help me to deny my flesh and keep my mind on you
take up my cross and follow behind you
I will be hated for your name's sake
but you will never leave me or forsake me
give me courage to face the things before me
and let my ears hear your voice
help me to understand your word
and read and pray daily

Crush the head of Satan
Glory be to Jesus Christ
