You must understand this
in the last days distressing times will come
men shall be lovers of their own selves
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers
disobedient to parents
unthankful, unholy
Inhuman, false accusers, fierce, haters of good
traitors, heady, high-minded
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God
having the outward form of Godliness
but denying the power thereof
Turn away from them for this sort
are they which creep into houses
and lead captive gullible women laden with sins
led away with diverse lusts
ever learning, and never able
to come to the knowledge of truth.
these also resist the truth
men of corrupt mind
reprobate concerning the faith
but they shall proceed no further
for their folly shall be manifest unto all men
and all that live in Christ Jesus
will suffer persecution
but evil men will go from
bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived
All scripture is given by inspiration of God
and is useful for teaching
For correction and for training in righteousness
so that everyone who belongs to God
may be proficient , equipped for every good work
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
I will suffer persecution rather than deny
