Condemnation seeping, loathing this Perilous way
sewers of compromise, I now open my eyes to the truth

You rotten filthy stinking piece of dung
I can't wait to see you die
into the eternal flames you will walk
I love to hate the father of lies

Oblivious subversion poisoning
numb to the silent repercussions
realizing the control of blinding darkness
exacerbated ways seal your destruction

Time draws near for your demise
My hate for you so intense
no one will mourn when all life is taken
from you scum, the father of lies

An end to your sovereignty
severed from all existence
extraction of authority
fallen again to final defeat
