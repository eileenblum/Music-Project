I will praise you o Lord with all my heart
I will tell of all your wonders
I will be glad and rejoice in you
I will sing praise to your name O Most High

I will give thanks to the Lord
because of His righteousness
And will sing praises to the name
of the Lord Most High

The Lord reigns forever
He has established His throne for judgment
He will judge the world in righteousness
He will govern the peoples with justice

The Lord is my rock, my fortress
and my deliverer. My God is my rock
in whom shall I take refuge.  He is my shield
and the Horn of my salvation
My stronghold.
