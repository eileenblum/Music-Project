That which is born of flesh is flesh
that which is born of spirit is spirit
A man cannot see the kingdom of God
unless he is born of the spirit
that's why the followers of Christ
are called born again

Grow in grace and in the knowledge
of our Lord and Savior (Jesus Christ)
to Him be glory both now and forever
talk to Him daily and study His word
so that your spirit may grow

I will rejoice in the Lord
My soul shall be joyful in my God
for He has clothed me
with the garments of salvation
and has covered me with the robe of righteousness

For true Christians are the light of the world
Blessed are they who are persecuted for it
because theirs is the kingdom of Heaven
let your light so shine that men
may see what you have done
and glorify your Father which is in Heaven

Whoever hears the sayings of Jesus and does them
will be likened to a wise man who built his
house upon a rock.  And the rain descended
and the floods came and the wind blew
and beat upon the house and it fell not.
Because it was founded upon a rock.

And whoever hears the sayings of Christ
and does not do them shall be likened
unto a man who built his house upon the sand
and the storms descended upon the house
and it fell and great was it's fall

Open your eyes to a relationship with Christ
continually seek His word
become a true disciple
a child of God
then you shall know the truth
the truth shall set you free

Don't put your trust in the riches of this world
trust in the Living God who gives
us all things to enjoy
that you'll be rich in good works, spiritual treasure
Benevolence, generosity

By the mercies of God
present your bodies
a living sacrifice
Holy, acceptable unto God
though Christ is absent in the flesh
He is with us in the spirit
receive Him in your heart
and walk in faith

So let us fight the good fight
and run the race before us
lay aside every weight and sin
that so easily stops us

whoever is born in God
will have the victory
to know the one true God, Jesus Christ
this is eternal life
