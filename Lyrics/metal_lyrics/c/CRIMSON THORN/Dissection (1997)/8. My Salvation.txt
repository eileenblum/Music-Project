The Lord is my strength and my song
He has become my salvation
He is my God and I will praise Him
My father's God and I will exalt him

May the words of my mouth
and the meditation of my heart
be pleasing in your sight o Lord
My rock and my redeemer

The Lord is my light and my salvation
whom shall I fear
the Lord is the stronghold of my life
of whom shall I be afraid
into your hands I commit my spirit
redeem me o Lord God of truth
the Lord redeems His servants
No one will be condemned who takes refuge in Him

My soul finds rest in God alone
My salvation comes from Him
God wants for all to be saved
Today is the day of salvation
