Satan knows your weaknesses, HE knows just how to tempt you,
You'll get hit at your weakest moment, Fall into sin again and again,
Then depression sets in, you feel so bad that you've fallen again,
You feel too ashamed to turn back to God, then you begin to turn away.

Resistance against Satan is not futile, the  bible says
resist him and he'll flee from you.

Humble yourself before God and He'll life you up, Draw near
to Him and He'll draw near to you.  Don't  turn away from Jesus, He wants to heal your heart and make you whole.   Confess your sins and repent, All Christians stumble
and make mistakes, Who can save us from our bodies of death, JESUS!

Never rationalize your sin, Never tell yourself it's not that bad,
Never justify your sin, finding reasons to say it's not your fault or that it's not wrong,
Mourn and wail against your sin, Bring it to God and He'll forgive you,  Our spirits seek righteousness and God, our flesh is weak, they're in constant war.

Submission to God is the only way to defeat evil, Our Lord and Savior Jesus is the way.

There were some people who were confident of their own righteousness.
They looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable.
Two men went up to the temple to pray.
One a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself â "God I thank you that I am not like other men.
Robbers, evildoers, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get."
But the tax collector stood at a distance.
He would not even look up to Heaven, but beat his chest and said "God have mercy on me, a sinner."
I tell you the tax collector rather than the Pharisee went home justified before God...
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
