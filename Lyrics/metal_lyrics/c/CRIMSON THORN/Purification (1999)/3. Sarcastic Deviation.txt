Creeping into the chapter of you
The sin you welcome
Multiply strife
Increased death life extinction

Existence that endures
One must see it's scheme
All wrapped up in it's allure
Demise of yourself is foreseen

Desire that is unquenchable
Fulfillment sought from the natural
Settle for a cheap imitation
The heart cold and hardened

The continuation of a struggle
Freedom seems but a dream
Holding fast to the giver of life
Persistence because of His grace

Sarcastic deviation
wanting to call you it's own
Despising it's deception
Truth found in Him, the Cornerstone
