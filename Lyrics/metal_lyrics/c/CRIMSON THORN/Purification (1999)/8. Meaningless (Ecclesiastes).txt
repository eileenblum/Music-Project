What is the life worth living?
Living life in the fear of God

Seeing wealth as the road to satisfaction
Our hopes are always disappointed
Living life in measureless frustration
Or living life in the fear of God

We must live life as humble true worshippers
If we are ever to enjoy living
As God intended us to live

Contentment is God's mandate for our lives
True contentment is an act of faith
