The wrath of God is being revealed
From Heaven against all the Godlessness and wickedness of men
Darkened hearts worship the creation
Exchanging the truth for a lie

Suppressors of truth
are without excuse
Eviscerate, transgressive state

Modern man has both feet firmly planted in midair
He who is not with Christ is against Him
He who does not gather with Him scatters

WE have Christ, and anchor  for the soul
Firm and secure
Come near to God, He will come near to you.
