Endless deception claims death as obsession
Ill spoken lie justifies the oppression

Tempting corruption the minds that receive them
Resulting realms of chaos and mayhem

Constant decay destroys life that is living
Twisted remains breeding the lies you're giving

Truth leads to terror in mere minds deceived
Lies precede death for those who believe

Misery
Blasphemy
Summoning Defeat
Infamy
Hypocrisy
Masquerade Deceit

Outraged emotions wasting unjust repression
Freedoms abased in this worthless statement

Deceitful release south in morbid desire
Escaping of life to existence of fire

Absence of power corruption in violence
Commonplace evil ends hope of benevolence

Crossover minds to existence worth while
Preventing disgrace drains desire for the trial
