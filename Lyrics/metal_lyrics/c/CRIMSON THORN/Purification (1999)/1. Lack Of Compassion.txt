Jesus said they'll know Christians by our love
Do not judge or you will be judged
Holier than though, have you never sinned?
The Bible says all men have sinned and fallen short of
the glory of God.

Jesus came for the sinners, not the righteous
All men are sinners
He ate with sinners and had compassion for them
God poured our his love and the sinners turned and
followed Him

Holier than thou
Turning people off to God because of despisement
in your voice
Holier than thou
Pharisees and Sadducees
Holier than thou
show compassion for those who do not yet know Christ
Holier than thou
Love the sinner, hate the sin

If they were only shown the love of Jesus
and not your despisement and condemnation

For God so loved the world
That he gave his one  and only Son
That whoever believes in Him
Shall not perish but have everlasting life
For God did not send his son into the world to condemn
the world
but to save the word through Him

Satan loves it when you make a mockery of God's love
Claiming to be a Christian but spitting venom and hate
The Bible says the world will hate Christians, because it
rejects Christ
Not because we acted like a bunch of jerks
Turn your self-righteousness into humility
Accept others with their faults as God accepted you
Who made you a judge, holier than thou
It makes me want to cry to see the harm you do

The sinner you see may have never before been shown love
Pain may be all they know, but Christ can heal their wounds
As ambassadors for Christ it's our job to lead them to Him

They should know we are Christians by our love
The Bible says they'll know we are Christians by our love!
