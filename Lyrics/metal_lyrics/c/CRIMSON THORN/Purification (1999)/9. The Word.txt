Words of wisdom, words of life
God gave us His word to teach us his ways
Reading, and studying
A great passion of mine

The words are alive, they strengthen my spirit
They give me direction, they teach me God's will
Ancient scrolls
Just as relevant now to our modern life

Book of rules, regulations
Those who've rejected Christ think it's meant to oppress
But the freedom to my spirit
The words bring tears to my eyes

False doctrine creeps in at every chance
People misquote and take things out of context
You need to study for yourself what's written in the word
Study what's taught to you, and find out for yourself if it's true

Know the scriptures, know the word
Sermons are great, but they shouldn't be your only choice
And like I said, test the sermons
Find out for yourself if they're scripturally sound

But all the Bible study in the world
Is no good if it's not put into practice
Knowing to love others, but showing them hate
Makes your studying null and void

His Spirit residing within you
is what makes the word come alive in your life
He'll fill you with his fire and cover you with his blood
Ask Jesus to enter your heart, He'll give you all you need
His love is like no other, His forgiveness has no end

The choice is yours, He's given you free will
We have the ability to choose evil or good
It's a free gift He's offering you, please take it and become His child
His arms are open waiting for you

His living words contained in the Bible pertain to every
part of your life.  It's not some outdated literature,
it's not behind the times
It's what's relevant then, it's relevant now
It's relevant to the future of humankind
Don't deprive yourself of the most important thing in life
