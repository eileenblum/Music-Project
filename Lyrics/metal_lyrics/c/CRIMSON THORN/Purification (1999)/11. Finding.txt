Merely living, not walking
True passion is what you long for
Higher focus on your problems
Deepened awareness to seek your face

Arranging life according to your taste
Preoccupation, selfish nature
Indulgence, conformist
Your demands, one in the same

Entertaining thoughts that lead to sin
Excesses claiming the mind
Turning to God to improve your life
All knowing ignorance buries you alive

Finding God in the midst of Hell
Growing in Christ, Spiritual
Peace sought in restoration
Resting in God is the solution
