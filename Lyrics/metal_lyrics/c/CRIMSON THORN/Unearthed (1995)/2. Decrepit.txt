Fated to ceaseless misery
Lair thief destroyer
You poison life with pain
Leading sheep to the slaughter
Weariness for the souls you have taken
You now face eternal torment
Your corpse will rot
Your weakness makes me laugh
Wages of your lost war
CHRIST has conquered you satan
Your evil power is useless
Against JESUS my SAVIOR
Maggots will feed upon your skull
When CHRIST destroys your rotting soul
