Hearts of black mixed with dust
Burial becomes a required must
Mankind lowered into tombs of waste
Human presence taken and erased
Spirit released (from the) bondage of earth
Exit the grave
Awake ... unearthed
Believing TRUTH thought once absurd
Gripping death certainly deterred
Demolished strongholds lay in waste
Your weakening body submits to CHRIST
Unearthed ... from the grave
Unearthed ... with acceptance of CHRIST
