In these days of increased learning
Liberal scholars lead the pack
Converting and diluting
Is their cancerous attack
Malignant... malignant
Holding positions of power
Infesting colleges and schools
Self appointed wise men who are truly only fools
With diplomas and degrees
And higher learning as their mask
Divine truths are slowly smothered
They've accomplished their vile task
But there still exists a remnant
Who are faithful to their call
A shining light in the darkness
Refusing those who will fall
They perpetrate the myth of spiritual neutrality
Denial of our fallen nature
Only feeds man's carnality
The simplicity that is in CHRIST
Cuts through their futile lies
By exposing them for what they are
We will welcome their demise
Malignant... malignant
