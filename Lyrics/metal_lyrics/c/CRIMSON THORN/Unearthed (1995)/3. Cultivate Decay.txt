When a prophet says something
in the name of the LORD
And that thing does not come to pass
That thing has been spoken presumptuously
And is not of the LORD - do not be afraid
You ask what shall I believe
Nothing seems real to me
Too many promoting a way
Finding no truth in what they say
Mindless babble mixed with lies
Passed on to generations
Brainwashed into compromise
Blatant ignorance elusive decay
Addition or subtraction
Formulation of a tainted belief
No leading of the SPIRIT
Only your impending individuality
Blind leading the blind
Power of deception leading your mind
Compensation of words
What you think and say is absurd
Pulling away from evil ties
The LORD of LORDS has made his sacrifice
Manifesting through HIS death on a tree
TRUTH found in HIS reality
