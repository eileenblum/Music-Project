Hanging on the CROSS the price was paid
Blood shed for remission of sins
You don't care well that's too bad
There will be a price to pay
HE'S the living GOD
Raised from the dead
Crucify your life
Through CHRIST be BORN AGAIN
Satan is defeated
CHRIST in victory rose from the dead
Satan puffs himself up to appear mighty
He knows his future is in the flames
Your whole life was just day one of eternity
JESUS wants to greet you in his loving embrace
There are no exceptions
If you haven't chosen CHRIST you chose satan
There is no middle ground
Your eternity depends on your choice
HE'S the living GOD
Raised from the dead
Crucify your life
Through CHRIST be BORN AGAIN
HE'S ALIVE
