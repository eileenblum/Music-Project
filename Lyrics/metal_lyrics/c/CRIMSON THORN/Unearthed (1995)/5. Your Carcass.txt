Watch and PRAY
Enter not
Into temptation
Spirits willing
Flesh is weak
Bury your carcass
Be renewed in CHRIST
To be carnally minded is death
To be spiritually minded is life and peace
Then sin that dwells
Inside of me
Makes me do
What I hate
A constant war
Inside of me
Between the flesh
And the SPIRIT
O wretched man that I am
Who shall deliver me from this carcass
of death - JESUS
For the law of the SPIRIT of the life in CHRIST
JESUS
Has made me FREE from the law of sin and death
CHRIST did conquer
Sin on the cross
That you might know HIM
And bury your carcass
For GOD so loved you
That he gave his only son
That whosoever believes
In me would not perish
But have everlasting life
