Crawling like a rat, scraping eyes out along the way.
Trying to be the first one to the end of the maze. You'll
always be a beggar, a waste. so fucking worthless, go
crawl away. you're just a rat in a maze. Masters and
slaves, pawns in a game, Marching in a funeral parade
of the Master's design, Obey. Rats in a Maze, Pawn and 
Queen deadlocked in place, entwined, dumb and blind,
Obey. So multiply. One lives another dies. We're all the
same in our lives, chains on our legs, wounds in our
Minds; Led by pied pipers. Obey- Devolving in Place,
Obey- finessed by deceit, Obey- with blind open eyes.
Obey. Crawl into a deeper hole, Drown in the hopelessness
of it all. Following the path never knowing where 
it goes and die. Masters and Slaves, Pawns in a game,
Marching in a funeral parade of the Masters design,
Obey. Rats in a Maze, Pawn and Queen deadlocked in
place, entwined, dumb and blind, Obey. You'll never get
to the end of the maze. Can't even see that you're part
of a big parade of blind-open eyed rats, squawking
and dazed, All pawns in the Masters game. Obey- 
Devolving in place, Obey- finessed by deceit, Obey- with
blind open eyes, Obey...Disease is in you, breeding
through you. So multiply and alone die. Swollen and
silent as a grave. Scuttle, scurry for the maze, lost in the
labyrinth of the mind. We kill we hate we all die alone
We steal we rape we all die alone compassionless deserts
We all die alone We seal our fate We all die alone
