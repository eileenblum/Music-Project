I'm on the move again through fire and ash. I'll burn 
myself down, then be born again. I remember the 
coldness of being alive. I want you to feel my burning 
death. it's COLD raw head and bloody bones COLD 
when the chaos comes COLD being lost in this skin. 
Feels like i'm coming home to death. Feels like i'm in 
a fleshy coffin. Feels like i'm coming home to death. 
Stuck in this skin I am trapped in a prison... this is 
the pulse of a body rejecting itself. Revolutionized, 
Overthrown from the inside out. There's a burning 
heat traveling thru me. Shivers up my spine like a 
fevered serpentine. I'm high... I'm high... Feels like 
i'm coming home to death. Feels like i'm in a fleshy 
coffin. Feels like i'm coming home to death. Stuck in 
this skin I am trapped in a prison. Force to shed my 
skin, i'll peel away till there's blood and vein and 
ruptured skin. So low beneath the sky, Buried within 
myself, Underneath A silent disease that kills the life 
in me. Alive, it buries me. Again and again, I pick 
up my pieces into one. I wash my wounds clean with 
my own blood. Feels like i'm coming home to death.
 Feels like i'm in a fleshy coffin. Feels like i'm coming 
home to death. Stuck in this skin, I'm becoming.
