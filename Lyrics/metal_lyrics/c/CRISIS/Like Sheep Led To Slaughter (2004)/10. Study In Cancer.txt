We're bred to follow and be devoured, to feed the machine. it's like
suicide of the self, the mind. Killing the free will, the transcending.
Twisting our minds, loosening spines. Ringleaders are breeding us their
minions. Sucking in prey to soft dark folds of Manipulation, Transformation.
It's calculated controled. it's infestation of the soul. Reshaping innocence
in rage, bodies devoured by hate. Cruel world order. In malignant image we grow, 
Distrusting our minds with blind open eyes. Despots thinking themselves artists, 
but truly are deconstructionist architects. it*s calculated controled. 
it's infestation of the soul. Reshaping innocence in rage, bodies devoured by hate. 
Cruel world order. Hard heavy handed, Applied force of pressure. I feel it I feel it. 
Bold dividing lines, Protect the chosen within. I hate it I hate it. Devour the people 
who have no power. As long as someone leads you follow, like a herd of sheep being led 
to the slaughter cold blooded eyes, A habit of lying. I get it i get it. Words Of Damnations, 
Deciding my future. I fuck it I fuck it. Devour the people who have no power. As long as 
someone leads you follow, Like a herd of sheep being led to the slaughter.
