...(you're so pale).
the lines of your eyes are weathered.
your broken arms can hold me no longer.
(you're so pale) now I'm falling down faster.
can't see the ground yet, buy I know it's cold and wet.
I see you in every cracked line.
you haunt me while I chase your ghost I can't seem to catch you.
(I just can't face your grave) you're lost in the darkness, you cannot hear me.
I'm lost against the background, wherever I look you can't be found.
the shadows fall around me and I can't see where I want to go
because because because (YOU'RE SO PALE AND DEAD)
(I just can't face your grave) release me let me go...
