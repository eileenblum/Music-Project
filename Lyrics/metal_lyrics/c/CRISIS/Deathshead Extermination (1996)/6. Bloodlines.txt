I want to hate you.
I want to knife you.
I want to kill you.
you made me this.
you ended me this way.
I live in this house in the name of suffering.
I am the darkness.
I live in the river, but I can't get myself clean
I'm as tainted as a bloody fucking broken bottle.
you made me this. you ended me this way.
I am dead. I am numb.
and I walk in this world of the living.
I am weary of this world. in my life.
I fuck the hours of death.
and I blindfold you. with the blackness of my breath.
I want to hate you.
I want to knife you.
I want to keep you away from me.
this is me.
what you did to me.
this is my life, this is what I do to you.
this is you.
I piss all over you.
this is me, you cannot break me.
I've already broken myself,
I've already buried myself.
I will destroy you.
I'll kill the beast in you.
I am going to hate you.
I am going to knife you.
I am going to kill you.
I hate you.
now I am this. now you've ended me this way.
now I am this. now you've ended me this way.
