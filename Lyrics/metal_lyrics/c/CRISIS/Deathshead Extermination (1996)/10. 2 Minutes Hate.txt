now just where the fuck have I gone.
the days feel so old and cracked and your eyelids close-you shut me out.
got run over by your words today, and everyone's a hazy shade of gray.
and I don't know who I am anymore, don't know where I'm coming from,
don't know where I'm going to but I kinda want to hate you.
I'm screaming till my bones break, but you swear you didn't even hear a whisper.
I'm always left to pick up your pieces.
a room of gold and you see red.
what is there left that I can believe in...
this so useless so dead and so ugly your eyes so disgusting so hating degrading...
a room of gold and you see red. what is there left that I can believe in...
now just where the fuck have I gone.
the days feel so old and cracked and your eyelids close-you shut me out.
and just where did I get lost. where did you go and where have I gone.
it's back to me again.
hair as fire. eyes as sharp as switchblades breathing death into my arms.
fingers dripping scarlet... what is there left that I can beleieve in...
I am so numb. I can't feel anything anymore.
I am trapped in a shell and I can't feel anything anymore.
I am so numb. ican't feel anything anymore.
I can't feel me. I can't see me. I can't feel me...
