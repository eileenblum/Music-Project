RIP THIS WORLD APART.
What does it mean?
Each of us does his best,
just to rot in his fucking grave.
Only good things to make you feel safe,
short before the big fall.

AND WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RISE AGAIN, YOU'RE GETTING JUST A KICK IN THE ASS.
AND WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RISE AGAIN, YOU'RE FALLING MORE THAN EVER.

Music is my hold, my energy.
It helps me to lie to myself.
The only thing which keeps me alive.
We are all just walking corpses.

SO RIP THIS WORLD APART.

AND WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RISE AGAIN, YOU'RE GETTING JUST A KICK IN THE ASS.
AND WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RISE AGAIN, YOU'RE FALLING MORE THAN EVER.
