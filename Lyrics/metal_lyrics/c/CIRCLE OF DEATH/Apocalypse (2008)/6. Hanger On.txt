[feat. Matthi of Nasty]Caught in a life,
just death as last resort.
No obsession, just oppression.

The brain oncquert by machine-like thoughts.
Can't you think yourself?

Just blind.
You're walking around.
Too blind to see,
SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.

[Matthi]

Too many ideas about crap,
too manipulated to think for yourself.
Too much changes in a bad way,
hanger-on, get your own life.

Too many ideas about crap,
too manipulated to think for yourself.
Too much changes in a bad way,
hanger-on, GET YOUR OWN LIFE.

GET YOUR OWN LIFE.
DON'T LIVE MINE OR OTHERS.
GET YOUR OWN LIFE.
OR PERISH TERRIBLY.
