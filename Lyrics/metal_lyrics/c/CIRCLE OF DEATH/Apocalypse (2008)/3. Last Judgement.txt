When the sky's turning to black,
and you feel judgement time has come.
Prepare to die, motherfuckers.
Angels decide about life and death.

This is Armageddon.
Run for your fucking life.

All the scum gets exterminated.
You didn't prove that you're worth it.
With the sickle through your neck.
Watch out, motherfuckers.

THIS IS APOCALYPSE.

With the sickle through your neck.
You didn't prove that you're worth it.
All the scum gets exterminated.
You didn't prove that you're worth it.

With the sickle through your neck.
You didn't prove that you're worth it.
All the scum gets exterminated.
You didn't prove that you're worth it.

This is apocalypse,
you can't hide.
All you fuckers get your heads smashed,
you can't hide

This is apocalypse,
you can't escape.
All you fuckers get your heads smashed,
you can't run away.

This is Armageddon,
run for your life.

THIS IS ARMAGEDDON,
RUN FOR YOUR FUCKING LIFE.

YOUR JUDGEMENT'S COME.

When the sky's turning to black,
and you feel judgement time has come.
Prepare to die, motherfuckers.
Angels decide about life and death.

This is Armageddon.
Pay for your fucking sins.
