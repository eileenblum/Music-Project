I CAN COUNT ON MY FRIENDS TILL I DIE
THEY ARE MY FAMILY
I CAN COUNT ON MY FRIENDS TILL I DIE
TOGETHER WE STAND STRONG
THIS IS A FAMILY
NOTHING CAN BRING US DOWN
STILL C-O-FUCKING-D
UNTIL DEATH DIVIDES
WE GONNA' STAY
SO YOU BETTER STEP UP OR WALK OUR WAY
TO BREAK THIS TIME HAS TO CATCH US UP
OTHERWISE WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE
NOT RELATED BY BLOOD
IT'S BLOOD-BROTHERHOOD
BUT IT FEELS LIKE FLESH AND BLOOD

THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CANNOT BREAK
UNTIL DEATH DIVIDES
