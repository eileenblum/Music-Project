This song is not nameless,
It is about what you are.
Just a talker trying to get a name.

I can tell you, you are nameless.
I can tell you twice, YOU'RE FUCKING NAMELESS.

That you are the limit I hear just from you.
AND JUST FROM YOU.
Like the others didn't get it.
NOTHING WENT WRONG.

Open your mind.
OPEN YOUR EYES.

Maybe you will recognise that you're still nameless.
You're still fucking nameless.

In your fancy reputation you are almost godlike.
In my clarification, you are what you are.
In your ridiculous mind, you rule everything.
In my explanation, you don't even rule your flat called bin.

You are what you are and not what you pretend to be.
Still a loser.
Still a tattler.
STILL NAMELESS.
