Like the death through the valley reaping,
THERE IS NO ESCAPE.

Bring the pain,
dying time has come.
For the unforgiven,
stop to breathe in.
The world in flames,
smell the ashes.
Soon it's too late.

THERE IS NO ESCAPE.
For the unforgiven.

There is no escape:
For the scum,
the shit,
the pigs,
for the fucks,
for the motherfuckers.

Bring the pain,
dying time has come.
For the unforgiven,
stop to breathe in.

BRING THE PAIN.

Like the death through the valley starts.
Reaping.

EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END.
