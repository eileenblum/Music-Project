When I look into these faces,
I know that it waste is.
Not worth it being that race,
everywhere is just human waste.

I see into these eyes, filled with puerility.
Everything is full of stupidity, insanity.

I can't stand those motherfuckers any more.
I HATE PEOPLE,
just because of you.
This is just the end of the queue.

I hate people, I hate you.
I wish motherfuckers doom.

I see into these eyes, filled with puerility.
Everything is full of stupidity, insanity.

When I look into these faces,
I know that it waste is.
Not worth it being that race,
everywhere is just human waste.

Just waste.

I hope you die.
