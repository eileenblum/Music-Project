Driven by pain,
hunting for salvation.
Deformed by mutagenic mass,
parts drilling the body.
But the power tastes so good,
pushes the pain aside.
Sneaking chasing for the kill.

Decapitation.
I will crunch the torso.
Rip the head, drink the blood, feel the power.

The mutation keeps drilling,
I keep killing.
The blood still spilling.
The bloodthirst grows, abandon.

Decapitation.
I will crunch the torso.
Rip the head, drink the blood, feel the power.

The mutation keeps drilling,
I keep killing.
The blood still spilling.

Take a look around,
I turn your head 360.
The bloodthirst grows.
Abandon.

I turn your fucking head 360.

Decapitation.
I will crunch the torso.
Rip the head, drink the blood, feel the power.
