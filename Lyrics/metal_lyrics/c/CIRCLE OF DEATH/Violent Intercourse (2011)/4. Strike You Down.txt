Look what we've been through.
See what I've done for you.
You don't appreciate anything.

Fuck the good times, they are gone.
Fuck the bad times twice.
Now the tables turned, I'm on the trigger.
Before you step my back, I'd rather break your neck.

You think it is a joke and see me as a clown.
I will strike you down.
STRIKE YOU DOWN.

Realise this ain't a joke, I'm not a fucking clown.
I will strike you down.
STRIKE YOU DOWN.

We were one whole part.
Shattered past, I will never fall so deep and hard again.

We were one whole part.
Shattered past, I will never fall so deep and hard again.
