Say what you want.
I will never change,
to fit to your life.
Change your view beyond your own nose.

IMMUTABLE.
I will never change.

To fit to your life,
accept it.
Don't you get it?
I want through all of this,
keeping it real to myself.
I will never change,
to fit to your life.

IMMUTABLE.

Say what you want, I will never change.

Say what you want,
I WILL NEVER CHANGE.

SAY WHAT YOU WANT,
I WILL NEVER CHANGE.
