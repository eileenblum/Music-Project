Flashing lights increase the pain.
It is morning again.
Too much booze last night.
Who's that bitch on my right side?

I don't care, let's take a ride.
Issues of a Saturday night.

I'm not kidding, I don't know.
What did happen yesterday?
But this pain in my head,
tells must have been OK.

Girls want to stay and do like my bad sway.

It's getting ugly when I'm around.

WEEKEND WARRIOR - FIGHTING FOR MORE.
