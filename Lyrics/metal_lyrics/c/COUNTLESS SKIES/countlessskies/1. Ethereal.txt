Waves crash against the strand
Her faint voice calls
From beneath the depths below

Far in to the distance
Lights beam out across
The vast abyss

Lost
I fear that I will never find the strength again
I feel that I have suffered far too long, Iâve given all I can

I was told that there was something more
But now I'm filled with doubt, drifting from the shore

Cold and still I gaze
Up far above
Where all I know is gone

Senses fade as time stops
I give up I
canât hold on forever

Lost
I fear that I will never find the strength again
I feel that I have suffered far too long, Iâve given all I can

Spiralling, dragging deeper down
In to the undertow
Crushed by its cold embrace
In numbing silence, I drift away

Tenacious and Majestic
Infinite and Absolute
Enduring and Composing
Constant and Unrelenting
Stubborn and Obstinate
Beckoning and Beguiling

[Heavy]

As the storm subsides
I feel the sun
it seems so far away

I strain to stay awake
as consciousness
fades I know my time has come

Lost
I fear that I will never find the strength again
I feel that I have suffered far too long, Iâve given all I can

Spiralling, dragging deeper down
In to the undertow
Crushed by its cold embrace
In numbing silence, I drift away
