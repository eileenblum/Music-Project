[Music and lyrics by Countless Skies]

Waves crash against the strand
Her faint voice calls
From beneath the depths below
Far in to the distance
Lights beam out across the vast abyss

Lost...
I fear that I will never find the strength again
I feel that I have suffered far too long, I've given all I can

I was told that there was something more
But now I'm filled with doubt, drifting from the shore

Cold and still I gaze
Up far above
Where all I know is gone

Senses fade as time stops
I give up
I can't hold on forever

Lost...
I fear that I will never find the strength again
I feel that I have suffered far too long, I've given all I can

Spiraling, dragging deeper down
Into the undertow
Crushed by its cold embrace
In numbing silence, I drift away

Tenacious and majestic
Infinite and absolute
Enduring and composing
Constant and unrelenting
Stubborn and obstinate
Beckoning and beguiling

As the storm subsides
I feel the sun
It seems so far away

I strain to stay awake
As consciousness fades
I know my time has come

Lost...
I fear that I will never find the strength again
I feel that I have suffered far too long, I've given all I can

Spiraling, dragging deeper down
Into the undertow
Crushed by its cold embrace
In numbing silence, I drift away
