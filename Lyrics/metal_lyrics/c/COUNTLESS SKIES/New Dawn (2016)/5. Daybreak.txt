[Music and lyrics by Countless Skies]

Racing the sun
Forever just beyond your grasp
Outrun the dark
Consuming all within its path

Though the weary sun
Returns to greet the morn
The night is always darkest
Before the break of dawn

Follow the trail
That reaches far from all you've known
As the fading light
Illuminates the way back home

Though the weary sun
Returns to greet the morn
The night is always darkest
Before the break of dawn

Hold on
The night is always darkest before
The break of dawn
