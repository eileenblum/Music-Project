[Music and lyrics by Countless Skies]

Still is the day that marries the shade
As eternal night descends

Long is the eve that holds no reprieve
From a torment without end

Beneath a starlit sky, a faint and doleful sigh
No wind to carry it beyond this empty realm
The light was all but gone when sang this mournful song
But not a soul in sight could hear this verse of overwhelming grief

Still is the night that holds no respite
As the hours turn to years

Long is the day undying and grey
Where the sun has disappeared

Beneath a starlit sky, a faint and doleful sigh
No wind to carry it beyond this empty realm
The light was all but gone when sang this mournful song
But not a soul in sight could hear this verse of overwhelming grief

"In each of these eyes
Lay the answer
But time left them blind
So now I wander"

In the absence of light
Where time has lost its place
A labyrinth of broken dreams
A token of her grace

In the absence of light
Where time has lost its place
A labyrinth of broken dreams
A token of her grace

As the fallen leaves
Return to paint the path
Her final resting place
Will shimmer with the stars
