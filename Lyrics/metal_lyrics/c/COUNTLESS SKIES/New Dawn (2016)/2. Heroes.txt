[Music and lyrics by Countless Skies]

"There were no more wise men; there were no more heroes..."
F. Scott Fitzgerald

A world familiar in stranger light
A rift in sterile order and chaos of the night
There are no heroes, there are no wise men

We live alone, beware the heinous
Afeard, tyrannized
Speak not in chorus
But tonight we lead the race

Come the reason
On blinded eyes
Call on thunder
Release the rain

If we should fall
We fall for a higher 'cause
One life means nothing
In the chaos of the storm from which we're born

The sky will fall for all
The rain came crashing down on us
No pain, no fear â behold the martyr
And between heroes we die alone

We live in rage, believe the fearless
A veil of false command
Propelled by memory
We join to fill the night

For all of us
Our wake will see
The shores of Eden
In its time

The sky will fall for all
The rain came crashing down on us
No pain, no fear â behold the martyr
And between heroes we die alone

Some will fall, some will die
So more the calling to fight
We feed the fire, we light the flame
And between heroes we die as one
