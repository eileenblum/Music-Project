[Music and lyrics by Countless Skies]

The bonds of loss and suffering
A burden for the weaker mind

Come walk with me on the greater road
Through golden paths, to nowhere
Leave all of yourself and the world behind
I am the wanderer, and I live forever

The mind can see what the eyes cannot
Our senses have endlessly been fooled
We cannot move mountains with a wish
But give all we have and ascend the peak

Come walk with me on the greater road
Through golden paths, to nowhere
Leave all of yourself and the world behind
I am the wanderer, and I live forever

Break free
You owe no debt today
Break free
To live the mindful way

Come walk with me on the greater road
Through golden paths, to nowhere
Leave all of yourself and the world behind
I am the wanderer, and I live forever
