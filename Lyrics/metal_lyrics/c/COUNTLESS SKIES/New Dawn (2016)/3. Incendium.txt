[Music and lyrics by Countless Skies]

To breathe in flames
To feed the only fire that I cannot explain
In time, enrage
Defeat the mountain that has held me back today

Release the fire
Begin the flames
Become the fury
The wrath untamed

Carry the fear
Above the mind
Clearing the path
That lay entwined

Be the change
That gifts us freedom
Be the reason
We savor life

Feed the fire
Become the rage
Burn the ego
And live today

Behold the light
That fills our emptiness
Face the dark
And burn eternally

Between the light and glowing embers
Burns the heart of creation
A flaming elegance
In which I know myself

Be the change
That gifts us freedom
Be the reason
We savor life

Feed the fire
Become the rage
Burn the ego
And live today

Behold the light
That fills our emptiness
Face the dark
And burn eternally

Behold the light
That fills our emptiness
Face the dark
And burn eternally
