[Music and lyrics by Countless Skies]

[Part I]

Like the river to the sea
Like the sunrise to the dawn
Everything that's meant to be returns
Like the calling of the wind
Like the faces of the moon
Its familiar light will guide you home

Take my hand
Don't look back
Take my hand
Don't look back
Don't look back

The journeys taken
The changes made
Will only lead you here to yourself
Don't stay in shadow
Never stand in awe
Look ahead and be free

[Part II]

[Instrumental]

[Part III]

Days flow free
And pass the shore
No words for me

The pain of growing older
Enlightenment in time
The mortal trail
Each dawn a little colder
Long shadowed ways behind
The mortal trail

Hope goes by
The mask of you
Confined to yourself
Moments cross
And sail beyond you
Too afraid to take

The pain of growing older
Enlightenment in time
The mortal trail
Each dawn a little colder
Long shadowed ways behind
The mortal trail

[Part IV]

Like the father to the son
Like the tiller to the field
Every day begins a further trial
Like the poem to the man
Like the measure to the song
Be the start of something greater here

Take my hand
Don't look back
Take my hand
Don't look back
Don't look back
