Four walls around melt in silence
Feeling nothing still enjoying violence
Red shines though dents posting figures on the face
Living no life being wiped out without a trace

Decayed agility fleshy mortality
Fatal defiency somewhat lost dignity
Sadistic cruelty fading vexatiously
Spoiling humanity with lack of..

I'm the las to be here and stay
On the wrong side of the traffic line
Bored and cold birds will
Flip over wings
and exchange belongings
So for the time remain
In force to play again

stardom wisdom seldom boredom

Bruises and cuts worn off tissues
Wind up the storm aware of all the issues
Help out turn off mental frenzy to flash out
What life could be I hope this fate is not for me

Decayed agility fleshy mortality
Fatal defiency somewhat lost dignity
Sadistic cruelty fading vexatiously
Spoiling humanity with lack of..

I'm the las to be here and stay
On the wrong side of the traffic line
Bored and cold birds will
Flip over their wings
and exchange belongings
So for the time remain
Enforced to play again

stardom wisdom seldom boredom
