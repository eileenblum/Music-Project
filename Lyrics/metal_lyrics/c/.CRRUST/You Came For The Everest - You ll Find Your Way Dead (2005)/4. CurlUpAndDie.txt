Head light is
Head light at the end of the tunnel
A beam of something inevitable
I tried to run but soon stopped
And curled up on the splitter
There's no point in dodging that stare
Head light is the way
Head light is your way up..
A thousand contractions within a blink of an eye
It's like a tidal wave of past, present, future
and all the feelings piled up into one big moment of truth
I shut my eyes tight and ask myself
Why am I so..
