This was a test drive heading the lane up
The sound of the tollbooth pride tore it all down
In this we all are flapping our bodyâs fame
Shaking off the remains of the vigorous blame

I pollute everything I see
I pollute everything visible
I see everything
So therefor...
Fly away, bolt off to the air
Thereâs nothing to it
Fly away, bolt off to the air
Thereâs nothing to it

Like the crowd out front the mausoleum
Never different never alike
You remain a quiz for yourself and the others
Just like me but sadly though I havenât found you yet

Fly away, bolt off to the air
Thereâs nothing to it
Fly away, bolt off to the air
Thereâs nothing to it

Push me away
