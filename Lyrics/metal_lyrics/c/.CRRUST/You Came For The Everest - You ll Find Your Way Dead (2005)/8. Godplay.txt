Play god on me
Teach me things I hate
Process me through black
Shout your teeth out

I'm playing god on you
But you won't trust in me
I won't disturb the calm
The tag is stitched to my skin

so here here I stand
devastated
I hit the floor
Then it faded
I suffocate
in my own matter
I'm way too far
way too far beyond the path of the psycho

I try to rip it off
But it just hurts more
I won't ignore the pain
it just makes me try harder

so here here I stand
devastated
I hit the floor
Then it faded
I suffocate
in my own matter
I'm way too far
way too far beyond the path of the psycho

if it's my path I'll walk it
if it's what I want I'll go forward
if it's my pain I'll ignore it
If it's my faith I'll accept it

I'll walk my path
I'll go forward
I'll ignore the pain
I'll accept my faith
