So tense
So dull
Is life given to
The two steps
Behind
Crossing the line

Watch me fade
Fade away
Fall apart
Right by your side
You're loosing me
I will not
Hold on one
Second more
I'll turn to rust
so sand me off

Intrude
Erupt
That is your tool

Watch me fade
Fade away
Fall apart
Right by your side
You're loosing me
I won't keep
Holding on
With no faith
I'll turn to sand
and call for wind

Precautions blacklisted
By something inside
Salvation stores freedom
So why would I hide
You needed this so I'm out of here
'cause I don't want you to lie no more
I'm through with your file you're using it
just for the hell of it but it does hurt
You lied again
You're doing it too often
