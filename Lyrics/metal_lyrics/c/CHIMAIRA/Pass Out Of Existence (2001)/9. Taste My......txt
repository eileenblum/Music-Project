Fall into my hole
I keep seeking
Is there anything left to consume now?
I wish I were happy living in
Living in your perfect world
You were never understanding enough
You were never supportive of me
Now I run away from you
Now I hide all this pain
Can you taste my tears on you?
Now where do I see myself?
Stagnation from my own selfish thoughts
Should I work to achieve my goals or should I work to leave you be or
should I work to keep you home?
You were never understanding enough
You were never supportive of me
Now I run away from you
Now I hide all this pain
Can you taste my tears on you?
May guns rise to kill me
Vice Grip
