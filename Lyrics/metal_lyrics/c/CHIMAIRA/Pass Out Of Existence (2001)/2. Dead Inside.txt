I felt so alone
You left feeling so empty and needing
Can't see the glitter in you
You called me all the time
Hiding behind your lies materialistic
Go away
You don't know what it's like to be dead inside
You called him a friend to help you get through it
I see your true face now
Well my tears are gone, I am happy now
Thanks for making it clear
Go away
You don't know what it's like to be dead inside
I am dead to you
You take my heart and used it as a tool
I wish that this would just go away
You can't find love you can't cry tears
And you won't be crying alone
Who are you today...another face erased
