I feel as if I have been dreaming
I am confused as to how I got here
One minute
I am heading down a path of destruction with no hopes but for death
Then there was you
You opened me to a different light
The path you lead me down was priceless
With one quick glance it was stripped from me
I was so ashamed I never let you be you
I have been puking with regret
I found myself again
And although we were apart
I managed to move on
Something was still missing
I made me sick
Far to familiar
I needed you once again, maybe now I can change
Maybe now I can secure my lumps
