A slave to my thoughts daily
I finally lost my craving
Need this to end real soon
You come then you go away
No way I can make it through this
Can you feel my heart fade away?
Do you remember what it was like when you told me no?
Feeling I can't figure me out
I'd try but I'm not allowed
Where do I go from here now?
My friends can't explain this to me
When I see you I don't see me
I feel I'll never gain
Your affection is a must to me
But reflections of past life won't let me be
Right now all hope is lost
Do you remember what it was like when you told me no?
Feeling I can't figure me out
I'd try but I'm not allowed
Where do I go from here now?
Save some for me
There's still blood for nine
