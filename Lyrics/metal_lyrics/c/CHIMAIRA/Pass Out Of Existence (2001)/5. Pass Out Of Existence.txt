Oh I'm that sick I see it that way
I'd rather be dead then have you stay
You pretend that it's OK
Right now it's my time to take
Feeding off my hate today
Feeding off the lives I waste
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name
Can't see my face
You can't see my face now
Pass out of existence
Gone
Disgusted by your presence now
I wonder what it would be like if you were down
Could you cope? Could you really cope?
Could you hope? Or would you sit and wait for me?
Seeking for my placement now
Seeking for my placement now
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name
Can't see my face
You can't see my face now
Pass out of existence
When I close my eyes
I see myself dead
I know you want it this way don't you?
When I close my eyes
I see myself
Dead...gone now
