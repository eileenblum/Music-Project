Late night comes are you home?
No you're not
You're out with urge to satisfy yourself
it's your vicious plot
Looking back I realize that it's my fault
I'm not around so your love comes to a halt
You have no remorse in you
It's the only thing you know
You destroy me every time you little cunt
I never wanted this
Gave myself to you to get paid back with lies
Every time I trust you I lose in the end
I feel disgust in myself
I love how you can call me and pretend you're innocent
While I'm out here trying to better myself
You're a pig when it comes to my emotions
You drown me in your wake because you have no devotion
You have no remorse in you
It's the only thing you know
You destroy me every time you little cunt
I never wanted this
Gave myself to you to get paid back with lies
Every time I trust you I lose in the end
