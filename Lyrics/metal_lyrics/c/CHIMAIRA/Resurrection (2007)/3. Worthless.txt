[Arnold, Devries]

Did you ever realize
that your way of life
is affecting all around you,
bottom feeding ignorance
you make me fucking sick.
Did you ever realize
that everyone you know
can't fucking stand you,
acting like you know everything
when you don't even have a clue.

You're worthless

I can't fucking believe
you never realized
that your way of life
revolves around theft and greed.
Every week a new identity
yet still an asshole to me.
Did you ever realize
no matter how hard you try
you'll never make a difference,
just keep on fucking pretending
that you're a saint.

You're worthless

Nobody cares if you die

Worthless

You are fucking worthless
