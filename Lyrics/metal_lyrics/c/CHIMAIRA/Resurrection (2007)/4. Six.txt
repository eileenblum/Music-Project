She has done so many things it's so surreal
She has seen so many things it's so unreal
She has been almost everywhere and tasted everything
She has been a dream since birth who could conquer everything

Night after night after every single night
she never gave up!
Fight after fight after motherfucking fight
She came out on top!

One rule, one way of life
Only, the strong survive

Never back down never back down
destroying everything

Blood all the blood every single drop of blood
She sucks it up!
Breath every breath every single damn breath
She screams with love!

One rule, one way of life
Only, the strong survive

Never back down never back down
Destroying everything
Nobody in this world will ever stop her
Nobody in this world will ever touch her
Everybody in this world will want to be her
Everybody in this world just needs to see her

She's everything
And she'll destroy the world
Never back down never back down
Destroying Everything!
