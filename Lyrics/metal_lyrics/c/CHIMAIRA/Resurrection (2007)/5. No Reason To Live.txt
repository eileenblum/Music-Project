Brown yellow and white diseases
Plague the streets with a vile stench
The smell of shit and piss fill the air
So fucking disgusting

Day and night feed off humanity
Scraping by on the remnants of life
No cure no hope no way to change
Paper bags filled with liquid love

No, no reason to live!

Steel benches and cardboard beds
Sheets made of black and white
To hide the sun
Live off garbage like a fucking pig
No way to survive

Day and night feed off humanity
Scraping by on the remnants of life
No cure no hope no way to change
Paper bags filled with liquid love

No, no reason to live

So fucking disgusting!

No reason to live!
