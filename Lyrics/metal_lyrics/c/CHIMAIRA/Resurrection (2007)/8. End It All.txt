Another day another town another city
It's all the same
And I used to find comfort in all of this
It's an excuse to deviate from the norm
Pathetic isn't it
After all these years, still not content

Happiness has been long lost
Suffering a drug with no cost
How great it would be to end it all

Another show another state another country
It's always been the same to me
Commanding troops just like a general
Leading the warriors into a battle
Pathetic isn't it
After all these years, still not content

Happiness has been long lost
Suffering a drug with no cost
How great it would be to end it all

Why bother it won't satisfy
Nothing ever does
The pills, the love, the recognition and support
I live to die, rot and decay

Happiness has been long lost
Suffering a drug with no cost
How great it would be to end it all
How great it would be to run away!
