Do you believe in me
Enough to sacrifice
Do you believe in me
Enough to end your life

Do you believe in me
Enough to kill for me
Do you believe in me
Enough to die for me
Come on and join me
Grab my hand
Together we will feast
On the blood of the weak

Empire
Destroying dignity
Empire
Destroying humanity
When you walk the path
You will discover a world undreamed of
Your suffering will be legendary
Do you believe in suffering

Do you believe in me
Enough to slay your brother
Do you believe in me
Enough to betray your family
Come on and join me
Grab my hand
Together we will feast
On the blood of the weak

Empire
Destroying dignity
Empire
Destroying humanity

When you walk the path
Your feelings won't betray you
When you walk the path
Your agony will elate you

Empire
Destroying dignity
Empire
Destroying humanity
