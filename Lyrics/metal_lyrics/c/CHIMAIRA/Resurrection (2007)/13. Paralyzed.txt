What's that behind her back (her back)
Suffocated with a plastic bag
she grasps for air
next struggle her feet are nailed to the floor

Whoa

Carving again and again
Slicing away the flesh
(Don't choke to death)
Begging again and again
Praying for it all to end
The knife severs her spine

Paralyzed
Paralyzed
Hole in her spine
She is paralyzed

Oh

Bleeding from the back of her neck
Gagging from all the blood that's in her mouth
Breathing her last breath
Fighting to stay alive

Paralyzed
Paralyzed
Hole in her spine
She is paralyzed

[Solo]

Paralyzed
Paralyzed
Hole in her spine
She is paralyzed

Paralyzed
Paralyzed
Hole in her spine
She is paralyzed

Oh...God...Look at that.
