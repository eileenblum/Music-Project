Free at last
finally tasting happiness
5 years of hell for nothing
trapped inside the minds of failures
A wise man once said
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
But we were dead
So are we now invincible?

Determination, perseverance, resolution... Resurrection

Final straw underlying ignorance
Consumed by greed and hate (and hate)
Kept under the feet of tyrants
Reality kicked in
Raced against time just to start all over
Treated like shit
Pushed aside and expendable

Determination, Perseverance, Resolution... Resurrection

We have become, So god damn powerful [x6]
All the beatings you gave us
We will use them against you

Determination, Perseverance, Resolution... Resurrection
Free At last
Finally tasting happiness
Resurrection
