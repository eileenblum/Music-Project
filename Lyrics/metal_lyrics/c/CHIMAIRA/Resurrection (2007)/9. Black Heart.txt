Black heart dead soul
Apathy and misery
Loss of control
Any of the above would describe me
I hate being inhuman
All I do is fuck everything up
Someone please just put a gun to my head

I just don't care anymore
I'm broken, tired and sore
I just don't care anymore
From my black heart

Faceless humans
Just want to get inside of me
Shut down long ago
Not even the closest know me
Like a leper everything I touch
Rots, dies then turns to dust
Everyone should just stay away from me

I just don't care anymore
I'm broken, tired and sore
I just don't care anymore
From my black heart
