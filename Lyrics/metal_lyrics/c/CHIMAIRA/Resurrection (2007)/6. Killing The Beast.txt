You're a man who lives in solitude
Never knowing what life could bring you
You have to raise your fists just to break through
All the voices inside your head that make you

You're a man who's filled with attitude
Don't you know that everyone hates you
It would be so simple for me to kill you
Mark my words my man I will stop you

Killing the beast killing the beast kill

You'll always see me
You'll always need me
You'll never last one minute without me

You can't take away all the lies that you told me
But I can take away all the feelings that I had for you

You'll always see me
You'll always need me
You'll never last one minute without me
I'm killing the beast
Killing the beast
Tear his heart out
