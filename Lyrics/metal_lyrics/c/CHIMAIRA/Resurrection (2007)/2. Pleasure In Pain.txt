Too tired to figure it out my head is spinning
My heart is so drained right now I think I'm slipping

On, my last nerve
I'll get what I deserve

I need this, I want this
I'm so obsessed
Pleasure In Pain
I feel whole again

I break the seal with my hand my blood starts pumping
Screams ring out so loud right now so deafening

On, my last nerve
I'll get what I deserve

I need this, I want this
I'm so obsessed
Pleasure In Pain
I feel whole again

You'll never forget my face!
