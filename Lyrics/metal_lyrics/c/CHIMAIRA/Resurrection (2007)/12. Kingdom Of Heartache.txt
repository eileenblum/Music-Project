Years ago they came to me, claiming they would protect me
Their fingers felt like silk, and lips tasted like candy
They were my everything, something left from a dream
This was the first time I felt so close to God
And all the angels lead me to his kingdom

There is no escaping
Judgement arise
Trapped in the kingdom of heartache

There's no way to understand, what the hell has happened
One minute on top of the world, the next minute I'm drowning
They took away everything, shattered all my dreams
This was the last time I felt so close to God
And all the angels lead me to his kingdom

There is no escaping
Judgement Arise
Trapped in the kingdom of heartache

i love to quiver shaking
Sacrifice, keep on bleeding
Mutilate all my feelings
Together in hell becoming a demon

Kingdom of heartache
Judgement Arise [x3]
In the kingdom of heartache
