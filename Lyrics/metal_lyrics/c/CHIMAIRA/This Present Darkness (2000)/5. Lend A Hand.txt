You are God's most beautiful creation
From the moment I set my eyes upon you
I knew I wanted to be near
To feel your arms wrap around me
And to share myself with you
Would be nothing but ecstasy
Knowing you will make me whole again
Then she said No
I cried out to help you
My friend who does nothing
I watched you high I watched you low
Never falling to far
I am glad to have been here
To help you get through her I know I didn't fulfill,
but I helped somehow
I'll take your pain
Create with me
Chim was a way for you to breathe
I hope it was enough
To help you through this war called love
Take our hand
Before you leave
One more time, reaching our dreams
We feel incomplete
I know one day
You'll solve that mystery
And make them feel
The way you did me
Lend a hand, AE
To you my friend
