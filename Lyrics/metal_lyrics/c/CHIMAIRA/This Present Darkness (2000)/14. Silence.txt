I am the one breaks all
This misery you call your life
I am the one who will carry you
To an altar of joy
Follow me
Flee from this
Except nothing but the best
I will hide all your pain
Resort to the unknown with
Silence
The way I will keep
Silence From letting you flee
You are the one who changed me
To a quivering mess
You are the one who stopped me
From doing all I can
Now's your time
Let me in Let me in your functioning mind
I will hide all your pain
Resort to the unknown with
Silence
The way I will keep
Silence From letting you flee
I feel your stench
So warm I'm home
Let me stay
And feel you more
I come
All over now
Where do I go from here
Leave me behind
Never again bitch don't even try
Silence your mouths you whore
