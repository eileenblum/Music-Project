In this present darkness
I fall upon broken knees
Crawl through weight depression haunted by and unborn ghost
I'll never know your fears
Never see me in your eyes
Curse the one that stole your name from
Me this is the monster that they create from second of your conception
Minutes leading to death sentence will shackle me and turn eyes red
I will constantly endure the pain of your creation
How can I lie awake grace
How can I lie awake my love
Will stay dead in this present darkness
I fall
