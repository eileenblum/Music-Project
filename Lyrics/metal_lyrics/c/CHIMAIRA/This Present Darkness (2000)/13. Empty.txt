I thought I knew you
My dream had come true
Look back, don't crack
Your stares are empty now
I am still here I won't crack
It's all coming back
My thoughts of the fading you
Reach through, make you
Mold myself for two
I cry for the bleeding...whore
Loss of feeling now I take the pain
So it's all right now I'm still a justified hole in your eyes
A pupil never a master
A crumble of dirt to the land
Take the blood right out of my hands as you
Realize it's your blood
Blood
My eyes see no one's empty face
I see a second coming of the land I was born with the fear of love
You made that fear a dream
Godless
I see me reaching for the sun
Try forever to
Reach the sky
I'm empty
Can't find you I am still here
It's all coming back
My thoughts of the fading you
Reach through, make you
Mold myself for two I cry for the bleeding...whore
Failure
