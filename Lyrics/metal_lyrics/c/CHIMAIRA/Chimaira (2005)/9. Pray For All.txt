Everything was perfect before I found my dream
You were the world to me
When I used to hate myself for trying
Now relying on you for direction seems so trite
Your attitude was quick to change when you thought
One minute might go by without being sought
Who do you think you are, manipulator
How did it get this far

I will make you pay for all the lives you've ruined
Pray you're able to breath while I strangle you

I'll stop at nothing, don't doubt me
You've reined enough
The lies you've been telling me you've been caught
Your enemy is reality
Your fatal flaw, meeting me

I will make you pay for all the lives you've ruined
Pray you're able to breath while I strangle you
Pray for all the lives you've ruined

Everyone you have betrayed will watch you burn
Everyone you have deceived will watch you burn
Everyone will watch you burn

I will make you pay for all the lives you've ruined
Pray you're able to breath while I strangle you
