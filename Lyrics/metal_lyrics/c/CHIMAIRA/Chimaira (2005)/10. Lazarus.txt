Eleven five, ninety-four, six thirty, morning
Woke up panicked, sweating, with a mouth full of vomit
No idea what could be wrong
Blew it off as this illness was common
Went back to sleep, then the phone rings
Fell to the ground
As the news was haunting... haunting

Lazarus endend his life, ungodly sacrifice, no reason why

Eleven eight, ninety-four, six thirty evening
The first time we're seeing Lazarus unconscious
Dressed in the clothes he loved
Laid out with all of his favorites
The tears of so many friends
Looked around and this view was haunting... haunting

Lazarus endend his life, ungodly sacrifice, no reason why

Never had an explanation
Never had a chance to watch Lazarus rise
Never had a chance to thank him
Never had an explanation
Never had a chance to say goodbye

Lazarus endend his life, ungodly sacrifice, no reason why
Never had a chance to say goodbye
