I am theconstant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the God you loved
I am the addiction
I am inside
I am the constant chill

That moves up and down your spine
I am the versatile one
That moves in and out your mind
I am the dark abyss
That haunts before your prayers
And I am the Nemesis
That haunts in your nightmares

You can feel when I inside you
And you know that
I controle you
I enslave you
I destroy you and I leave you comatose

I am the God you love
That moves in and out your veins
I am the addiction
That buries you in shame

You can feel when I inside you
And you know that
I controle you
I enslave you
I destroy you and I leave you comatose

I've wrapped these chains so tight
You can't break through
The smell of fear is so enticing
It's so inviting
There is nothing more that I love
Than to tear your apart

I am inside and you know that
I controle you
I enslave you
I destroy you and I leave you comatose

I've wrapped these chains so tight
You can't break through

I am theconstant chill
I am the versatile one
I am the God you loved
I am the addiction
I leave you comatose
