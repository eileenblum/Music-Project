Greed has caused you to become a monster
Greed has caused you to become so cold
You said you loved him, then you put him away
"'Til death do us part" means nothing to you
Greed has caused you to betray your family
Greed has caused you to become so jaded
We've got some news for you, every dollar you save
Will cushion your pillows in hell
You act like we're we're blind, deaf and dumb
Betrayal has now left us numb
We're sorry we can't escape from
This choice now we all must succumb
He's been thrown away, left for dead

How could you choose money instead

Greed has caused you to become a monster
Greed has caused you to become so cold
You said you loved him, then you put him away
"'Til death do us part" means nothing to you
Greed has caused you to become so jaded
We've got some news for you, every dollar you save
Will cushion your pillows in hell
You act like we're we're blind, deaf and dumb
Betrayal has now left us numb
We're sorry we can't escape from
This choice now we all must succumb
He's been thrown away, left for dead

This is only father we're dead
Thrown away, left for dead
How could you choose money instead

We will never forget that you're the reason
This sadness has overwhelmed us
This grief is too much to bear
How can we look you in the eyes
How could you ruin his life
After all the years of joy he brought us
There's no "we" anymore
There's no "us" anymore

You will have to live your last days infamy
How could you do this
How could you choose to have him
Thrown away, left for dead
This is only father we've had
Thrown away, left for dead
How could you choose money instead
