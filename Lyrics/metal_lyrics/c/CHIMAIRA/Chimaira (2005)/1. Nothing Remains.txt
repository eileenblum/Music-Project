I shout these words to those who never listened
I pen this letter with the utmost conviction
It's been dark in here, cold and relentless
It's been too long: I can no longer fight this

Too late to change my mind
Nothing remains
I've silenced the pain

All these years passed. No one heard my true feelings
You continued to act like you knew me
Did you ever stop to think that I'd be able
To look in your eyes and say that I'm stable

Too late to change my mind
Nothing remains
I've silenced the pain

Don't tell me, that I am taking the easy way out [2x]

No underlying message to figure out
What you got from me is what I put out [2x]

No one knew a thing about me
Just longing to be accepted
Wait 'til you see what I've become

My lifelessness [2x]

Too late to change my mind
Nothing remains
I've Silenced the pain
