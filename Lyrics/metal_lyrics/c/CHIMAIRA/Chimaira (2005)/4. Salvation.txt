Endless nights filled with misery
Sick of familiar patterns
Bruise after cut
Can't wash away my scars

This is a night of... salvation (salvation)
One the night of salvation (salvation)

This life always pained me
Tired of the same routine
All lies I've told
Can't hide the little things

This is a night of... salvation(salvation)
One the night of salvation(salvation)
Life has been left behind me
I will not cower away (cower away)

[x2]
Adrenaline stronger than ever
Feel it all come together

On the night of... salvation (salvation)
On the night of... salvation (salvation)
Life has been left behind me
I will not cower away (cower away)

(salvation)
(salvation)
(salvation)
(salvation)
