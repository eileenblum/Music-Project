Can't sleep with all this frustation, intoxication
I no longer have regret
So what if I cause hysteria, it's not my dilemma
I'm only here to inflict pain

I will never forgive the ones who pushed me away
Like a tumor, rage grows inside me
Reminding me every day, I will retaliate

A thorn in my side for eight years
The man who sheds no tears
I am here to expose you
All of the poison that you take
All people you violate
Your faith can't save you now

I will never forgive the ones who pushed me away
Like a tumor, rage grows inside me
Reminding me every day, I will retaliate

I am your family with the power
To end everything
Everything you love

You should be paranoid
I guess I no longer share this vision
I guess I have a new agenda
While you sink down into your hole
I am proud watching you lose control

[x2]
I will never forgive the ones who pushed me away
Like a tumor, rage grows inside me
Reminding me every day

I am your family with the power
To end everything

Everything you want
Everything you feel
Everything you need
Everything you love

You love! [x3]
