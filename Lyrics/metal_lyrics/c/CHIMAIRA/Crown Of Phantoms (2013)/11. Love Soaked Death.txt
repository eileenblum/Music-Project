Love soaked death two suns on one tongue
A kiss from across the universe
The black bottomless pit of hell
Kaleidoscope altered imagery
I was so terrified to see is this all that I've become
A hopeless tragedy acceleration toward infinity
The walls are closing new reality
Opened eye is this death?
Love soaked death two suns on one tongue
A kiss from across the universe
Enter my brain sweet poison
