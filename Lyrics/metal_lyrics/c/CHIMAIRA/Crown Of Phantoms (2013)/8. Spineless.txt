These words will cut you like a knife
And I'm killing this idea that you're perfect
Blinded by your own your own revolution
Misguided following insane delusions all illusions 
Weak minded backstabber and if I told you once I told you a thousand times
When will you realize you're spineless?
Just another useless wasted life so spineless
How does it feel motherfucker to know I'm right?

Running away you're just a coward feel my strength
Fall victim to the power get on your knees and pray for death
How does it taste your final breath such a disgrace 
To the human race a total fraud, one side, two faced
You are the master of manipulation
Bow to me, embrace the decimation.
