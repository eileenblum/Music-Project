Wide awake bleeding on the inside doubt 
The consequences feelings internal holocaust, blast 
Reach for the gun and put it to their heads
The uncontrollable appetite to kill the pain
Where is your god now? Where is your faith?
Reach for the gun and put it to their heads
Force them out the voice is pulling me away

No more lies no more goddamn Hollywood vampires
Suck it dry no mercy for the heartless
It is a beautiful day to die kill the pain rip their hearts out
