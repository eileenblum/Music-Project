Hello again my friend it's time to start there is no end
Choking on diamond fantasy enter the madness
Beautiful sadness you won't escape this stranglehold and it feels so cold
And I can't stop won't stop all the highs and lows
Overwhelming paranoia to ease the blows

It's a holiday, another holiday
It's just a holiday in this plastic wonderland
Unleashing the excess illuminate darkness
You will embrace this troubled soul
Can you take me higher just to make me low
