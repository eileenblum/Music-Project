Survival of the fittest denial of existence
Missing a piece inside of me I must awaken
Revival of everything I'd live and die for
Too late to go back now the walls are crashing down
Walk with me through misery wear the crown of phantoms
Devour the weak empower the meek finding the beast inside of me

And I will grow stronger for everything I'd live and die for
Erase the ghosts from the past
Awake, release the anger at last
Come walk with me through misery
