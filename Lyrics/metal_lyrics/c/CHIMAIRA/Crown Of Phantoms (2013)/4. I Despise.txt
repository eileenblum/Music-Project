Fake, judgemental hypocrite self-righteous piece of shit you think you know it all
Don't know a fucking thing about me do you? no, you're everything I despise
And nothing will save you now celebrate the demise of broken dreams
And empty promises you are the disease
Pathetic waste of life get down on your knees
Beg to stay alive, The truth is I can't fight the urge to smash your fucking head in
To break your fucking face crazed, Sharpening the blade all that's left in me is rage
It would be worth it all to put you in your fucking grave
