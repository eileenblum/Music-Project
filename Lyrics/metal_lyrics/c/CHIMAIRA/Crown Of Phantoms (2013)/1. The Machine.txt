It is alive beyond the dark side passing through the light
Blast off, catalyst paradigm shift of consciousness
Transcend the end we manifest what we think
We create all the love and the hate through the battles we go
We have died a million times before

Every struggle opens a door forget this mortal coil and rise up
The time has come to reboot the machine
Watch it thrive, Living the high life dreaming of paradise
Cast off, mask off alien green crystalline do you feel alive?
