Fuck what they say a dying age
A boiling rage will forever define us
And now your back's against the wall
The burning flame will forever divide us
Welcome to the separation say goodbye to your generation
New era of domination life is chaos wrapped in violence

Fuck yesterday we're here to slay
A cloudy haze will forever define us
And now your back's against the wall
You're hollow fear will forever divide us
Fuck what you think no, fuck everything
A middle finger will forever define us
And now your back's against the wall
