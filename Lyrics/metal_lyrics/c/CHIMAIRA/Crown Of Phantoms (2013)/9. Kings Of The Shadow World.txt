Horror, inconceivable to believe torture, penetrate the heart of humanity
To satisfy is to sacrifice we rely on death to give meaning to life
Cult healing incomprehensible twenty first century massacre
We are what you fear the most in this drugged up dystopia
Catatonic butchers rule the mind we are what you fear the most
Orchestrating execution kings of the shadow world

Panic, everlasting cause for alarm terror, trepidation dropping the bomb
To satisfy is to sacrifice leave them, incapacitated twenty first century massacre
We are what you fear the most in this drugged up dystopia
Catatonic butchers rule your mind we are what you fear the most
Orchestrating execution kings of the shadow world
Behind the curtain evil darkness behind the shadows build inside us
