Suspicion growing
A feeling I cannot control
Communication
Communication low
The invasion is necessary
The dangers are secondary

This was never meant to be
A lifetime of instability
I guess I was weak
Someone please rescue me

Frozen in time
Can't control what's inside of me
Frozen in time
I left my soul behind
I'm at the end of the line
Trapped in my mind
Empty and blind

I see myself dying
All these paranoid delusions frighten me
Manipulating vitality
An unspeakable evil latches on to agony

Attacking my body impurity spreading through me
Like a parasite
Desensitized to the world while the plagues controlling
Like a fucking parasite

The same demons keep haunting
Sending their warning
It's unrelenting

This was never meant to be
A lifetime of instability
I guess I was weak
October the leaves buried me

Frozen in time
Can't control what's inside of me
Frozen in time
I left my soul behind
I'm at the end of the line
Trapped in my mind
Empty and blind
