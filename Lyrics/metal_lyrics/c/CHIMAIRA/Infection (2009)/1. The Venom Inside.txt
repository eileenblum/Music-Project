The venom inside.
Turned me into the enemy
Turned into what I hate
My apathy got the best of me
Blood boiled and lost my way

I never thought I'd be the one to blame
Have to live with constant shame
Everything that I put inside
Just to feel numb

I tried to escape
push it away
tried to hide
The venom inside

I tried to escape
push it away
tried to hide
The venom inside

This was nothing but moral abuse
Guess I just needed something new
What could I gain from solitude?
Or acting like a fool?

I tried to escape
push it away
tried to hide
The venom inside

I tried to escape
push it away
tried to hide
The venom inside

Disconnected, Apathetic
It's so pathetic to be this frantic
I needed help! I needed help!
Like methadone for an addict

I tried to escape
push it away
tried to hide
The venom inside
