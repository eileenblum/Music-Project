It's just another sleepless night
The hunt is on
Looking for anything
To fill the void
Make me feel alive
Take me back to paradise

Cause I'm walking on broken glass
I should know good things never fucking last
The reflections of a shattered past
They keep me walking on broken glass

A thousand eyes focus
Here is your god
Which one will sacrifice
Their innocence tonight?
Don't think twice
Take me back to paradise

Cause I'm walking on broken glass
I should know good things never fucking last
The reflections of a shattered past
They keep me walking on broken glass

The nameless walking with their guide
For a chance to meet their god
And it just won't stop

Can't describe this satisfaction
Can't control the chain reaction
I employ you to fulfill this creed
Insensitive
On flesh I feed
Welcome to my hell

Make me feel alive
Take me back to paradise
Cause I'm walking on broken glass
I should know good things never fucking last
The reflections of a shattered past
They keep me walking on broken glass
