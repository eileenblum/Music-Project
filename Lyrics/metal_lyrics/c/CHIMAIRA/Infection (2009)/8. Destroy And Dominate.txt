I am the bastard son
The expendable one
War is in my blood
Rage is in my heart
The lone wolf inside me
No home, no family
Just wanted serenity
But you pushed
You pushed me
You pushed me
The lone wolf inside me
Needs to be set free

One by one I'll crush you all
Day by day destroy and dominate
Blood
Blood for blood
Destroy, destroy and dominate

Rejected by society
The same one that created me
And I don't care what you say anymore
I am no longer your slave
The lone wolf inside me
Has finally been set free

One by one I'll crush you all
Day by day destroy and dominate
Blood
Blood for blood
Destroy, destroy and dominate

Dominate.

One by one I'll crush you all
Day by day destroy and dominate
Blood
Blood for blood
Destroy, destroy and dominate
