This might be the last time you see me
But you can trust I did my best
As complex as all this seems
It's much more than a test

The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears

As my world is dying
So far from home
Been stranded in this empty abyss
Darkness surrounds me
Lifeless

The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears

Existence
Search for a new beginning
Persistent
Something always chasing me
This demon's covered in scars
Menacing
Burnt by the sun his flesh charred
Challenging, terrorizing, manipulating every single thought
As he closes in
My will must be strong
Or he'll stab you in the fucking back
I won't turn to dust

The sky is falling
The end is here
The final warning
The sun disappears
