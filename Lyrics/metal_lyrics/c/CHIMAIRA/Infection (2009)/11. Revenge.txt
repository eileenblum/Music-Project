[Bonus track]

I'll bring the terror
Leave you trembling
You might as well give up
Like the chosen one
All my prophecies
Will come true
I am the face of fear
You can't stop this rampage

Revenge so sweet
Satisfaction watching the defeated
Something tells me
You're never going to live through this
So I'll keep haunting you until I get my revenge

You use to be brilliant
Now you're the victim
You're just a broken soul
You
Are jaded and condescending
You're wretched and diseased
And I saw it from the start

Slowly I'm waiting
Attacking and erasing you from me

Can't pull me under
I'll do what it takes to endure this
You're ignorant and overconfident
If you think I'll come back to you
