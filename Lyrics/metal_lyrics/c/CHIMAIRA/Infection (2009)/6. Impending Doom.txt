Impending doom
Can't escape
Pitch black at the lake
The snow is falling can't escape
The evil approaches
Can't save you

[x2]
These problems don't have solutions
We're rotting inside this cell
Our bodies are like a prison
Only death will save us from this hell

Jagged stairs leading nowhere
The clock is staring at me
Running away from the pain
The evil approaches
No one to save me

These problems don't have solutions
We're rotting inside this cell
Our bodies are like a prison
Only death will save us from this hell

These problems don't have solutions
We're rotting inside this cell
Our bodies are like a prison
Only death will save us from this hell (from this hell)

Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black
Have you ever seen spiders crawling on the grave (on the grave)?

The grave that gave
The grave that gave us fear of loneliness
That turned us into hellions
We're like slugs in the sun
Tearing us apart

[x2]
These problems don't have solutions
We're rotting inside this cell
Our bodies are like a prison
Only death will save us from this hell

Only death will save us from this hell
