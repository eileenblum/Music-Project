I used to feel invincible
Nothing could stop me
Now the smallest things are crippling
Where did my passion go?
Why donât I dream anymore?
Is there anything real out there?
Iâve lost all faith I had before
How much more can I take
Sick of making the same mistakes
These memories have torn my heart
Now time is running out
Itâs hard to face the facts
Head hurts from thinking
All of this could have been avoided
I had to destroy it all
I had to start a new
What is lurking around the corner?
This arrow of time is irreversible
This endless loop repeating infinitely
Iâm swallowed by the storm
