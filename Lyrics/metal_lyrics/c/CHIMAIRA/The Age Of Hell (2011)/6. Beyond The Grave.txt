Iâve seen the signs
But Iâve ignored them
Sickness has taken my soul
This force deep inside has led me to this day
I no longer want to be their slave
Iâm not meant for heaven or hell
So what waits for me beyond the grave?
I see the light
Shining before me
Fearless Iâll walk alone
Into the void everything is unknown
The canvas is no longer black
The situations have changed for the better
Câest la vie
The smoke fills the cracks
