There is a price to pay for freedom
There is a price to pay for bliss
What is it worth to you my friend?
Whatâs more important in the end?
Black hole swallowing
Mental shattering
The virus has consumed you
Deep down
Breakdown
Meltdown
Countdown
Pitch-black attack
And thereâs no turning back cause
Right now Iâve got my finger on the trigger
And Iâm ready to pull
Iâve got my finger on the trigger
And my sights aimed at you
Thereâs no easy way to say this
Thereâs no easy way to stop
Will you look back on this day
And understand the reasons why
You are following the same path
Wallowing
I wish you would wake up
These routines will be the end of you
