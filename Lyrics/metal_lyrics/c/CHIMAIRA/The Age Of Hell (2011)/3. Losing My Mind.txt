Ready to explode
The pressure buries me
The poison takes control
I drop down to my knees
I scream
Get this invader out of me
I need help this is killing me
Iâm blinded by the thought of tomorrow
Iâm drowning in this ocean of sorrow
I need to leave it all behind
I think Iâm losing my mind
Trembling
My hands start to shake
The sweat drips down
Canât look in the mirror
This face is unfamiliar
Temple throbbing
Panicked I start to scream
Is there anyone out there that can help me?
Iâll try anything to make it stop
