Choking on these feelings
This awakening has been at arms length for too long, itâs hard to
accept when all I had was their words
Iâve seen the devil and Iâve kissed the mouth of sin
Bloodshot eyes and senses heightened I am seeking to get in
These chains no longer bound me
Iâm shedding my skin once again
In the year of the snake I was born into a world of pain and heartache
Isolation was the key to unlocking my soul now the story will be told
