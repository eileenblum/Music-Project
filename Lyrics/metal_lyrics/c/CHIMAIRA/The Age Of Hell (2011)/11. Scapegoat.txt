Burning inside
Slumped over
Living a lie
I reach for the whip to tame the beast
Your eyes judge what they do not know
Donât look at me that way
The words you use behind closed doors make their way down the hall
I hear it all
Iâm not your fucking scapegoat
Whyâs it so hard to see the truth
How much more do I have to prove?
What am I supposed to do
When nothing I say, not matter how true, will make the actions of yesterday
Easier for you
Why canât you get over it?
Why canât you move on?
Where were you?
The reflection that you see
Does it haunt you daily?
I shouldnât live in that shame
Iâm not the one to blame
There is a little of me inside all of you
