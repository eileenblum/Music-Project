[USB Bonus Track]These eyes are watching every move that you make
Youâll pay for your mistakes
Your excuses are weak
You are from the king
Youâre a fucking fake
A bat without wings
Your words fall on deaf ears
You better believe your days are numbered
Iâll take you down
Your reign of terror is coming to an end
I see through the lies
Iâll take command away from you
Iâll expose every fucking truth
Youâve reached the end of the line
Itâs been a long time coming
My hate continues to grow
Donât bite the hand that feeds
