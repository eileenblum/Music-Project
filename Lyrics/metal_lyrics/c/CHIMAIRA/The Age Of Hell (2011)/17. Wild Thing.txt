[USB Bonus Track]Wild thing, I think I love you
But I want to know for sure
Come on and hold me tight I love you
Wild thing you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy wild thing

Wild thing, I think you move me
But I want to know for sure
So come on and hold me tight you move me
Wild thing you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy wild thing
