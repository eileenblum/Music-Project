Clockwork I hear the sound of the bell
The more I push the more I forget
Iâm in the mood to lose myself
The more I push the closer I get
I started off small
But you knew it wouldnât stay that way
Iâve tripled the amount three times over
Donât know where itâs taking me
Every day I fly just a little higher
I want to float forever
And leave this world behind
I traveled long and windy roads
The more I see the more I fear
Thereâs only one thing in this world
That makes everything crystal clear
Iâll keep the earth below
Drifting through eternity
