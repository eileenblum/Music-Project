She lays there helpless
Alone in the darkness
My chest is so heavy with pain you canât describe
Sliced, cut
Why?
Skin so raw
Iâve never been so frightened, so enlightened
What kind of god does this?
We were so powerless
Summertime we saw the king die
Does anyone care?
Living nightmares
Breathing heavy as I remember those months
Throat tightens
I wish I were strong like you
