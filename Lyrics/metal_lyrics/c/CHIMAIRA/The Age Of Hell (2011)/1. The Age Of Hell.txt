Are you ready to die?
One more swing
Bloodletting
Thereâs no place left for you to hide
Your world is now over and no one can save you
Ambition has been laid to waste
This gift and creation are plagued with disease
Fury and grief are displaced
No way to prepare for the end
Blood will be shed
Final farewell
This is the age of hell
Heading towards insanity
Scandalous demise
Sacrifice is imminent
The smell of death breathes new life
The structure is cracking from rot and decay
The faces will all look dismayed
No type of prevention, no chance to discover just what could have been the way
Bones have been broken and teeth have been cracked
Walking disaster, headed straight for death
There is no way to get out alive
This temple has fallen for good
Will there be a chance to rebuild it all
If I could fix things I would
