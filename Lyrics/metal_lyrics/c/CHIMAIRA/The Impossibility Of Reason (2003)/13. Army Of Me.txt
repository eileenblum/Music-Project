[Digipack Bonus Track]You can't
Understand I still have a lot to say
To you
Unfortunately it's not the time or place
My life
Upon my life there will always be lies
No more
I don't believe in this hypocrisy

You are
Parasitic bottom feeders
All you
Maggots one in the same, you all make me sick
Guilty
Especially you who justify your rational lives
Killing
You're killing in the name of God or country

Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
I'm surrounded by filth

Army of me
He lives in us all
Army of me
He will avenge me
Army of me
He lives in us all
Army of me
He will avenge me
He will avenge me

Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
I'm surrounded by filth

Army of me
He lives in us all
Army of me
He will avenge me

Army of me
He lives in us all
Army of me
He will avenge me
