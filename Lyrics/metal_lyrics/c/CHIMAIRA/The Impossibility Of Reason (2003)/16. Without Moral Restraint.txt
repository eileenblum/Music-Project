[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

I see what is fake
What is real I'll never know
Can't you see I'm just a disease
Free fall faking over human emotion and all round and I'll Never see you
Never been me
But it's my round to say
It's my round to feel
I can't take a face to your hate anymore
now I lose control sticking it back to you

I'm not the only one
Without moral restraint

I can't image why you would send a force
Send a force up above me thrown down
Never know what I'm up to do you?
Can't you see my lies?
Can't you see through this disguise?
It's my round to say, it's my round to say
I'll never know what the difference is
Is it hell, is it earth?
Is it hell, is it earth?

I'm not the only one
without moral restraint

I'm not the only one
without moral restraint

See me twist, and time come along
Is it my time to make up your soul?
Is it my turn to make up your soul?
Can't keep giving back to you
I keep giving it back to you

Keep giving it back to you [x3]
Never ever say could

I'm not the only one [x7]
without moral restraint
