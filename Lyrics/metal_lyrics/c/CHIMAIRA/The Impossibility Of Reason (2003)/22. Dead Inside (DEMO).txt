[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

I felt so alone...

You left feeling so empty and needing
Can't see the glitter in you (go away, go away)
You called me all the time
Hiding behind your lies materialistic
Go away

You don't know what it's like to be dead inside

You called him a friend to help you get through it
I see your true face now(go away, go away)
Well my tears are gone, I am happy now
Thanks for making it clear
Go away

You don't know what it's like to be dead inside

I am dead to you
You take my heart and used it as a tool
I wish that this would just go away
You can't find love you can't cry tears
And you won't be crying alone

(Dead inside)
Who are you today...another face erased

Dead inside!
