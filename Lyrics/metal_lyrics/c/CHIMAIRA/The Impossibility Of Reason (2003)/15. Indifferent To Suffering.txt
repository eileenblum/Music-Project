[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

Unrelenting addiction
The struggle continues
The urge to satisfy isn't the question
Just donât want to be around
To face the consequences
Fake smiles surround
To ensure the desire
As perverse as it seems, it stays
Who leads their waste of time?

Ever wondered what itâs like, to have dreams last forever
Never doing again, from the everlasting of them

Life feeds off life
Indifferent to suffering

Liars grow stronger
The taste is similar
To the sweetest kiss ever encountered
A painful bliss on my head
Picture painted (Painted)
Could not capture
An ounce of the true sensation
That is derived from some sorrow

Ever wondered what itâs like, to have nightmares last forever
Never doing again, from the constant torture

Life feeds off life
Indifferent to suffering

How, how sweet it is
Sweet, how sweet it is
It, beyond this life
Is, beyond this life

How sweet it is

Life feeds off life
Indifferent to suffering
