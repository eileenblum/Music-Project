How many times can it change
How long will I be restrained
It's appalling to think that
All my time seems to be wasted
Will it stop or is it inly beginning

Here on the inside
My life is not over
I'm down again

Fake smiles surround me all day
No more can I tolerate
These excuses or all this
Constant pressure overloading
Make it stop the fire's always burning
