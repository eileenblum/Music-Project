[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

Face to face
No time to waste
This is the time for revenge
Your claim to fame
Of crushing dreams
Your control has no hold on me

I hate the way
You have no shame
You act like nothing's happened
It's time to rise
The final fight
This is the last time

I will not fail again
I will not let you win
Fuck your power trip

I'll throw away
The wasted days
The chance for revenge
My claim for fame
Ended in vain
This was the last time

I will not fail again
I will not let you win
Fuck your power trip

You are the one who's forsaken us all
Nothing has changed so together We fall
I am the one who's led us to believe
You can't change me

I will not fail again
I will not let you win
Fuck your power trip

Fuck your power trip!
