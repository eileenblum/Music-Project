[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

Stay awake to decide
Are you coming back?
Is this my santity?
I can't forgive
Oh is it the same to me?
I can't take your place
I'll never see you, never flee from me

Severed

Lost lies in the house I bring
I can't fucking see
I can never pull your self from me
I can't focus
Libertine my "said to be"
I will never save you
Wait...

Severed
