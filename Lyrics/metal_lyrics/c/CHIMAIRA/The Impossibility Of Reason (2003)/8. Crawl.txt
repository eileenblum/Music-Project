As I lay this all to rest
Shadows appear reminding me
Of all things left unsaid by me

Maybe one day you'll believe
That I will crawl
I will crawl on broken knees

It's beyond what you really need
Forcing it all out of you
Will I make your life complete
Come Clean

Am I the sorrow
That you won't reap
Am I the secret
That you can't keep
Well I won't stop
Until I'm complete
And I won't stop
Until you believe
I won't stop until you need me
