[Removed track]

You pretend to feel me..
You pretend to care about me..
(I will stay away from you)
This is my time to rise,
Never again will I fall for your lies.
This is my time to gain,
Nothing else will stay the same!
This is my time to rise,
Never again will I fall for your lies.
This is my time to gain,
Nothing else will stay the same!
You pretend to feel me..
You pretend to care about me..
(I will stay away from you)
(from you!)
(from you!)
This is my time to rise,
Never again will I fall for your lies.
This is my time to gain,
Nothing else will stay the same!
This is my time to rise,
Never again will I fall for your lies.
This is my time to gain,
Nothing else will stay the same!
This is my time to rise,
Never again will I fall for your lies.
This is my time to gain,
Nothing else will stay the same!
This is my time to rise,
Never again will I fall for your lies.
This is my time to gain,
Nothing else will stay the same!

WILL STAY THE SAME!
WILL STAY THE SAME!
NOTHING ELSE WILL STAY THE SAME!
