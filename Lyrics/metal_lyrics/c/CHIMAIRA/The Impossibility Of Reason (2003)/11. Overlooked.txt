Closing comments made you wonder
What was the start of it all
Hunting to find the answers
Unavailing attempts to be me

Hey
Did we distract you
Did we prevent you
Did we bore you
Did we stop you

And I'm
Betrayed by you
Won't be overlooked by you
Betrayed
Betrayed

Hoped you were thinking of redemption
Found out you erased the memories
Erased the thought of me
How can I believe this untrue

I know I'm not insane

Come take a look in my eyes
