[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

My scabs are almost picked
Slowly growing into this
Feelings I just can't let go
I am such a bore, you need that much more
Go back that way and see what you get from me then
Nothing at all
My dead hands rise

Why am I this way?
Face my past I can't let go

I see them in the jel
Laughing at me it is hell
Nothing can stop this torture
Fake my way through life
Call on me, my wife
Went back that way and I saw just what I was worth
Nothing at all
My dead hands rise

Why am I this way?
Face my past I can't let go

I won't take no for an answer

You fucked me, bitch
You can't fuck with me

I won't take no for an answer

My scabs are almost picked
Slowly growing into this
Feelings I just can't let go
I am such a bore, you need that much more
Go back that way and see what you get from me then

Why am I this way?
Face my past I can't let go
