Ever want to commit murder
Feel the rush as you kill
Looking into dead eyes
Collecting their last thoughts
Sometimes I feel no remorse
Sometimes I want a taste
Why am I so different
Than those who can just do it

I want to change what I've become
But I can't kill the urge
But I can't kill the urge
You are now mine forever
Walk with me one last time
You'll walk with me one last time

I feel you embracing
You wish it would end
I feel life for the first
Time I ever have

You cannot fuck with me
Like you have in the past
This time I will stop you
Dead in your fucking tracks
Your eyes close away
As I feel salvation
Now you pray
Light, the final vision
Your eyes are blank

I want to commit murder
Feel the rush as I kill
Looking into your eyes
Collecting your last thoughts
I never feel remorse
Now I want is taste
I know I'm not different
Then those who can just do it

I want to change what I've become
But I can't kill the urge
I can't kill the urge
You are now mine forever
