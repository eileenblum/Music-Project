[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

Images still in my head of you dead
I wish I could take them away instead
I sit in my room alone and cry over my loss
Will anything ever be the same?
I wish I could imagine you happy
A life of ecstasy that would be good enough to stop the pain that lingers
In my heart I know I would be content
YEAH! It's your forced life
It's your forced life... It's your forced life...
doesn't it feel the same to you?

I sit and wonder
While you ponder of pathetic items that bring you happiness
Those things that put a smile to your face
Are the things that kill me inside
I know deep down you have a good heart
But why am I never included in all of this?
I take you in...rise you up, yet my soul stays untouched?

YEAH! It's your forced life
It's your forced life...It's your forced life...
doesn't it feel the same to you?

I take you in...rise you up, yet my soul stays untouched?

Nothing ever changes in your mind

YEAH! It's your forced life
It's your forced life...It's your forced life...
doesn't it feel the same today?

Nothing ever changes

YEAH! It's your forced life
It's your forced life...It's your forced life...

Stick your hate to me
I'll find a way to break free
