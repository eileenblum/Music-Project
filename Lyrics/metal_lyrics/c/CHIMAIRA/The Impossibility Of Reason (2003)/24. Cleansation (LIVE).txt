[collector's edition track of the disc 2 "Reasoning The Impossible"]

What do you expect from me
Will I ever be what you want me to be
Will I ever live up to your standards
Will you always look down on me
Maybe I'm not who you are
Maybe I want to be myself
Live the life I've always dreamed about
This is not your path to choose

Yes I taste it
Yes I breathe it
Yes I hate it
Yes I feel strain from
Our separation
But
This is my life, this is my life
My Cleansation
Our separation
This is my life, this is my life
It's not yours anymore

Why did you insist on ruling
Why did you try and control
Why didn't you ever listen to me
Ignored me like a dog
Maybe I'm glad we're apart
Maybe I'm glad we don't speak anymore
I feel better now
Now that you're gone

Yes I taste it
Yes I breathe it
Yes I hate it
Yes I feel strain from
Our separation
But
This is my life, this is my life
My Cleansation
Our separation
This is my life, this is my life
It's not yours anymore
