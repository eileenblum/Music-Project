The sky is closed , itâs my empty door
I wait for (the) light , âcause I canât see anymore
And sorrow reigns , in the coldest void of my heart
Again my dreams are smashed by the night
Broken inside, filthy desire
But with the lust of the sin , Iâll fly again

As I know, Iâm all alone..
but angels never fall..

Try to open the doors of life
There is no light , only an angelâs cry
And all the beauty of her crown, fading away
now she knows that she can change her past
I try once more, but she was my darkest dream
And she knows that she can change her past and she will
Not.....

Let us hasten, when first the Morning Star appears,
(To) the cool pastures, while the day is new,
while the grass is dewy

As I know, Iâm all alone..
but angels never fall..

Try to reach the sky...still
Others wings to fly,to kill
Try to catch the light again
Under me the heartâ¦the pain!!

As I know, Iâm all alone....
but angels never fallâ¦....

From the dark a shell of purple and black velvet
a chant is rising and the skin trembles
I see a gold circle of light in front of me

Forgive my eyes..
Forgive my voice..
Forgive my sins..

But angels..
But angels never fall..
