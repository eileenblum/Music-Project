Burn! The wooden-stand of lies
The fire in my eyes,
The voices told me âdieâ
Now clean my ashes
I lived
Through the lies
Through the sins
Now they send me to the stake
Hellstorm
Iâm heading, to the forsaken place
An endless black hole
a nightmare for the mortal souls
I only loved the trees, I didnât offend God
Sentence of Death, is what, you bastards call law
Hear meâ¦Iâll come back
Prepare yourself.. for my revenge
Dead! I was burned for them!
Your priests eat my flesh
The Mother saved my soul
My hate for you is grown
You must pay,by my side
I will rise.. from the Hellstorm..
