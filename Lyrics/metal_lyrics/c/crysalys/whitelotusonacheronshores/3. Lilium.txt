Starring eyes blessed by the lies
of an ancient darkness you're the keeper, and its gently soul
Lake of life,white wedding in your deep
Lying down , awaits its destiny

Whispering through the damned forest
 On leaves and flowers she sleeps
Let to sleep the white lady
pure is her name and pure is her skin

Auratum Lilium..

Through the flames you danced and smiled
          Through the flames you died and cried out
Burning both body and soul
Then remains, ashes and cold

Auratum Lilium ..
ray of light and night

A painted angel in a fairytale
A witch called to death today..

I received the life again from the crows
Burning both body and soul
Listen well, her voice calls

So I see, through the trees
The fog, is vanishing

I slept a moment, an eternity
I felt the breath of my Father wind
I saw the sky, falling through the leaves
I burned for Him..
Liliu
