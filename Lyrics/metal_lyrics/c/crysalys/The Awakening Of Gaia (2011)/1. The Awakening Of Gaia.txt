She waits for thier sleep,quietly
Everything stands still,hypnotized

EARTH

She trembles,she'll revenge her beloved sons
All their lies fall like leaves
Time has stopped the eyes

"Io son la Grande Madre,
Dea Costa della Luna
I venti in coro cantano il mio nome
Signora di magia
La forza mia primeva
La vostra infausta razza punirÃ¡"

AIR

She screams,winds shout her breath
She'll destroy everything
Sounds fade in air

WATER

She cries all her tears,oceans give her hate
All the sirens sing no more,waves devour the rain

"So sure they could decide not only for their own destiny,
But for their own mother
Relying on thier technologies
And so she reacted,and we will all feel the effects for years to come"

FIRE

She burns,arms of flames tear this agony
Quietly she cleans their flesh
There is nothing left

"We all come from the Mother and to her we shall return
Like a drop of rain flowing to the oceans"

Earth is my body
Water my blood
Air is my breathe
And Fire is my spirit

Oh...where am I?
Mother I can see you again
It's a new birth!
