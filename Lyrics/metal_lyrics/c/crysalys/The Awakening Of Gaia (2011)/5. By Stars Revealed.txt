Hey mom,look at your right
It seems like stars were right!
"Come to me,Angelica.."

Won't you leave this world tonight?
Let's be lost in space and time
Until this world ends
From ashes rise again

They could be wrong
You should be strong
In your sorrow
There's what stars revealed

As dark and stars come with the night
I trace a line writing my name
In this land with no more light
Those stars seem not so far away

Won't you leave this world tonight?
Let's be lost in space and time
Until this world ends
From ashes rise again
They could be wrong
You should be strong
This is the oracle...
It's been so cold
You might feel lost
In your Sorrow
There's what stars revealed

As dark and stars come with the night
I trace a line writing my name
In this land with no mre light
Those stars seem not so far away

Laws of Karma guide your path
Among this faceless crowd
find your answers so far
Far away with dying stars

As dark and stars come with the night
I trace a line writing my name
In this land with no more light
Those stars seem not so far away
