"Once they told me that a simple flap of butterfly's wings creates a hurricane on the other side of the world..."

For a long time...I couldn't see a butterfly
The last time,I was a little more than a child
It was golden,black and white...

how I can see it now?
In this godless land?
Flying on this death...
It seems so powerless
but then she'll never rest

I'm running on this ruins
Chasing my butterfly
I'm hearing every noise
Everything is so alive

She spreads her wings to fly away
Upon this godless land
It seems so powerless
But then she'll never rest

Following the pulse through ruins of reality
Her fate is to change the other face of the world
But she'll never see the effect of her wings
Following the pulse...

I'm running on this ruins
Chasing my butterfly
I'm hearing every noise
Everything is so alive

We contemplate oblivion
Fallen are the ethics
Of this dying race

I'm running on this ruins
Chasing my butterfly
I'm hearing every noise
Everything is so alive
I'm leaving the coldest pain
Catching the butterfly
Binding her soul to mine
Denying what's left behind
