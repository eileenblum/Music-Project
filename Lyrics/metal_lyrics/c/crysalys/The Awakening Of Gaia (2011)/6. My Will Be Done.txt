Awake as a strangers in this familiar land
Light years of pain bartered for instants of half happines
2 inch from my dreams still too far

Don't call me betrayer,alone I'm falling in this chasm
You're right my angel but you just can't pay my price
2 inch from my dreams still too far
In the end my will be done

Don't call me betrayer,alone I'm falling in this chasm
You're right my angel,but you just can't pay my price
Not a solution,instead my revolution because
I'll take my life in hand this time,selling it to Evil
Not afraid of hell,it can't be worse than here

Erase all dry roots holding me in this steppe
Or throw herbicide on my fate
Light-years of pain bartered for instants of half happines

Don't call me betrayer,alone I'm falling in this chasm
You're right my angel,but you just can't pay my Price

I'll take my life in hand this time,selling it to Evil
Not afraid of hell,it can't be worse than here
I'll wash away my sins this time
Paying for my faults
Not afraid of hell,it can't be...
It can't be worse than here
