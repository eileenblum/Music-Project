"They're coming!"
You've waited to see me on my knees
My face drowned in the mud,alone!
They tear you limb from limb
Feed the death they know,you're just meat...!

The stronger drains again
The weaker's dim emotions...
When the sky paints itself in grey
When the hunter catches his prey
Silent screams...

You know that's just their time
The stronger drains again
The weaker's dim emotions...
Vile and greedy leech
mask,liar,misery,deceit..!

When the sky paints itself in grey
When the hunter catches his prey
thier mouths decide who lives
You know that's just your deal
