staring eyes,blessed by the lies
Of an ancient darkness you're the keeper and its gently soul
Lake of life,white wedding in your deep
Laying down,awaiting her destiny...

Whispering through a damned forest
On leaves and flowers she sleeps
Let the white lady sleep
Pure is her name and pure is her skin...

Auratum Lilium

Through the flames you danced and smiled
Through the flames you died and cried out

Turned apart,body and soul
then remained,ashes and cold
Auratum Lilium

Ray of light and night...
A painted angel in a fairytale
A witch called to death today
She received the life again from the crows

Burning both body and soul
Listen well,her voice calls...
So I've seen
Through the trees
The fog...
Is vanishing...

I've slept a moment,an eternity
I've felt the breath of my Father Wind
I've seen the sky falling through the leaves
I've died for Him

I've dreamed a moment,an eternity
I've felt the breath of the Mother Earth
I've seen a red child running up fallen leaves
I've died and cried for Him
Lilium...
