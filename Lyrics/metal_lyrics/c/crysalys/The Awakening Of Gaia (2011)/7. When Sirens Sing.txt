Proud
And so fearless
You caught me before my voice bewitched you
Rude
But fierce as a prince
Maybe this creature can ravish me
As soon as I've desired to be human

"Rinunciando per un semplice umano al mio poderi,al mio mondo,alle mie sorelle
alla mia immortalita ed alla mia angelica voce..!"

Ingrate!
You leave me alone on this island

No matter how far from reefs you are
Across the sea and ground my song will reach you
And you will be mine again
Amongst all sailors who sallied this sea
My promise swam to you with the cursed kiss we had
Along this shore...

I'm the cause of your strength
Of your talent,your charm
I'm your treasure and the reason you're damned
I'm the bride of this waves
She's your fate! She's your shade!
I turned you into the white swan
As soon as I've desired to be human
Ingrate!
You profited by my love

No matter how far from reefs you are
Across the sea and ground my song will reach you
And you will be mine again
Amongst all sailors who sallied this sea
My promise swam to you with the cursed kiss we had
along this shore...

[Siren's lullaby]

Fulfill my dreams and orders inside this melody
Satisfy your wishes and your deepest needs
Abandon yourself when your siren sings

No matter how far from reefs you are
Across the sea and ground my song will reach you
And you will be mine again
Amongst all sailors who sallied this sea
My prmise swam to you with cursed kiss we had
Along this shore...
