Lost since so many days
I walked and hoped for so long
Trying to be realist in so many ways
But more and more loud,I'm hearing its call.

The white lady,asleep in the fog,calls me from that lake.
She whispers through the wind
Winter tales sung my memories
Witches dance under the rain
The Mother arises from pains
I've seen the ruins fall to rise once more
The Earth gives new life from her womb.

I'll never leave and I'll never forget
Strange places and white lands I saw that night
More than a dream but less than simple truth
I swore to see that world awake

The vision of her,running free
A little child and her innocence
That angel was me
Winter tales sung my memories
The seed growing into my brain
My home is but a complex maze
I'm talking alone in an open cage
With all the heroes of my favorite fairytales...

I'll never leave and I'll never forget
strange places and white lands I saw that night
More than a dream but less than simple truth
So bewitched by what you could call lunacy
Ride this night breeze
...and let the innocent dream

Lost since so many days
I walked and goped for so long
Trying to realist in so many ways
But more and more loud,I'm hearing its call
lost in the spell,let me believe...

I'll never leave and I'll never forget
strange places and white lands I saw that night
More than a dream but less than simple truth
I swore to see that place awake
I'll never leave and I'll never forget
Strange places and white lands I saw that night
More than a dream but less than simple truth
so bewitched,by what you could call lunacy
Ride this night breeze
...and let the innocent dream...
