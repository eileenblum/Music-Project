When all lights are gone
When you're on your own
On the second act
Of this tragedy
when It's you and your soul
Even when your shadow stops following you
It's hard to hide yourself

They come in...
Pretending
To play by your side...

Remember me
Don't fall into fear this night
Not for a while
Believe in me
When sirens sing don't cry
My little child

When you shed your last tear
When you stop believing in magic
But witches still haunt your dream
There is something in you
That the storyteller won't reveal for now
But your rivals know...

They come in...
Pretending
To play by your side...

Don't look back
I'll take care of you as best as I can
No one will ever see your pale face until the happy ending

Believe in me when sirens...
Please don't cry,my little child
Remember me
Don't fall into fear this night
Not for a while
Believe in me
Tonight...
Don't fall into fear
This night...
Don't look back...
