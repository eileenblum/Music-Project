The Day will come before next dawn
No hero will answer your weak call
You won't hide yourself in the crowd

how can't you see...?
The poetry inside my plans
The perfection of this symphony
How can't you see...?
No chance to flee

We believe in Holy Light
In submission and sacrifice
You can still be purified
Leave your dirty past behind

The faith consumes the hoping soul
No angels will save you from your soul
They fell in sins,they're lost like you

How can't you see...?
The poetry inside my plans
The perfection of this symphony
How can't you see...?
The sense of my dreams
How can't you fell...?
No chance to flee
How can't you see...?

We believe in Holy Light
In submission and sacrifice
You can still be purified
Leave your dirty past behind

Join us and spread thy word
Join us and purge the ruins of this land
No one will ston us,even you
Join us...or burn!

We believe in Holy Light
In submission and sacrifice
You can still be purified
Leave your dirty past behind
How can't you see?
