Dreaming eyes wide open.
Restless nightmares are in town,
Carving hope out of my flesh,
Deceiving with a numbing warmth.

Living lies, forgotten,
Countless prayers are let down,
Carving faith out of my flesh.
Will I live in a test,
Just to do my best,
Until the end?

But to pretend as if Iâm alive is not enough.
Here I am denying it all, come what may.

Iâm burning out,
This night runs without a need;
Turns me against my awakening.

Iâm burning out,
But this fight shall set me free;
It will lead me to my awakening.

Living lies still forgotten.
A reckless but mundane breakdown.
Carving lust out of my flesh.
Will I live in a jest,
So called a quest,
Until the end?
