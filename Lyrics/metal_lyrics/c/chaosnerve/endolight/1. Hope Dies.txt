Itâs who we are,
Trapped in a cage,
Made of skin and bones.

We know not,
Any other way to live, no;
Just praying for today.

We tell lies,
Just to save ourselves,
Then we are asking for relief.

Live and learn;
Trust isn't earned, but it is gifted,
By the weak.

Hold on to it, never let it go.
There goes the hope, won't back it grow? (Hope dies)
Visit the shrines to stall decay.
There goes your soul, it's too late now to mourn.

Only a few will die,
Knowing better than to fear,
From the unseen and greed.

We held the pride alive,
Stuck with faceless preachers,
And the weak.

We know not,
Any other way to live.
We tell lies,
Just to save ourselves.
Live and learn,
Trust ainât earned but its a gift.
We held the pride alive,
Stuck with the faceless preachers.
