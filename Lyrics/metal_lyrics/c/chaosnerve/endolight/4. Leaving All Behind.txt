These roads weâve crawled in guilty,
Are nothing more than a torture designed,
By our reckless decisions.
Now weâre choosing to fight,
With lust and pride combined.

Rising up,
Into infinity,
Leaving all behind,
Our own enemies.

With each day weâre growing weary.
Underneath our rebellion, lurks in sobriety,
The last stand of our beliefs.
No more will it remain as,
Oppressed by society.

Forget the pain caused by failures,
Let go and accept it, destroy or neglect it.
This war, it never ends.
Yet weâre choosing to fight,
With love and hate combined.

Rising up,
Into infinity,
Leaving all behind,
Our own enemies.

Leaving all behind,
Rise and fall, Iâve seen it.
This time I feel it. Iâm going up!
