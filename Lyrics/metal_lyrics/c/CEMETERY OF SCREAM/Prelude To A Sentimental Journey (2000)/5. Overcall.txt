Please me or bless me 
I'm full of your lack 
depress me and press me
to give me your slack 
weed of your decease 
anger of your bliss 

Crown all your world
cell you gave me to live
wiil be my jail
my reason to fell
that hate you love to breed
will be your decrease

Crash me or slash me 
I'll fix  to your dreams 
depress me and press me 
I'll feel what you'll give 
found lieing on the floor 
the day you realesed your fear.
