The role of Jack-o-lanterns is to be a bridge
a bridge to a desert
a hope in empty words is like the sand,
the sand that burns my soul
with a glow of desires

Who was I?
Who Am I?
Who'll I be?
Should I try?

Can we stop the rain 
if the sky is blind 
can we stop the tear 
a bird that is divine

Left the night behind 
silent candle prayers 
no one's ever found 
tear that pined away

How strange... so moonlit is the great wall of china; this night! 
the huge full moon is casting long shadows before my eyes as 
I'm slowly strolling over the wall, approaching another tower. 
what am I doing here? I feel spiritually naked under these chinese 
skies. Not thinking, still waiting... all those myths and beliefs, I
have heard seem likely to happen, now. what have I come here for?
I remember nothing...

The chinese girl: good gods have sent me here to warn you. but 
my warning is a riddle, and the final answer belongs to you, master. 
please, listen up: what lies between reality and unreality and we all 
have to go there?

Nothingness, it is nothingness
