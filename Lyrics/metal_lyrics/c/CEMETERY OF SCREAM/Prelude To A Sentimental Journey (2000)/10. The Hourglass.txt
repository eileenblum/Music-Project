Far 
so far away
there's an impulse in your brain
it remains invisible
but it's waiting for a day

In the maze
of the ego's secret place
you'll detect your other self
always silent
still yourself

The grains of sand are pouring down
what was then will not be now
you're staring at your hourglass
ashes to ashes and dust to dust

Close enough the old book of hate and love
study life to learn to die
till you utter
your last cry

Feel your blood
getting frozen getting stopped
you don't have to fight again
no more living
no more pain
