That's the game of chess
your life against the death
and you're a looser
just loosing your last breath
the clock's tick tock
seems to be dead men's talk
and you're a looser
juast loosing your last breath

The point of death has never been closer      
enter the garden of chaos and order     

A rude awake from the dream 
from the dream that you've been painting      

It's a dream within a dream     
so much yet to be seen     
how much time is it taking     
till you feel the agony      
and still you are searching      
for your lost memories      
but you know you'll have 
a blind date with your death

The chance to live has never been closer 
enter the garden of chaos and order

A rude awakening from the dream
from the dream that you've been painting

A sweet awakening from the nightmare of the hating 
a dream within a dream so much yet to be seen
