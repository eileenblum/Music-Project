Hear
what I brought
with my fear

Hear
What I thought
scars I feel

Born in the crowd
of the rusty pleasures of your kind
burn like a shout
that'll never rise from your heart
Fall
Never cry alone
Fall
Never cry alone

Hear
what I brought
sign the will
raise the soul
Hear
what I thought
scars I felt
were unreal

Feel
What I brought to you
What I brought to you
Feel
