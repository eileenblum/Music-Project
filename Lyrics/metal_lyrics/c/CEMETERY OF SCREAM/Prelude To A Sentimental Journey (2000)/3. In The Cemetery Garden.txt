Silence has fallen,
and my burnt-out inner self
has been plunged into
complete darkness.
and not so long ago,
the spark of my stray humanity
used to glow with
thousands of irrational colours.
Now... is already here.
it's impossible to move away
from its intrusive presence.
This permanent contact
causes fear and disgust.
so much you can see
walking along the cemetery alley;
the silence is not just silence...
It is destiny!
