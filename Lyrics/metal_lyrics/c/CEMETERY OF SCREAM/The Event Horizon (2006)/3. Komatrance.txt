In the web of dreams
In the well of nightmares
In the world of her coma
She's playing her game
She belongs to the clan
Half-alive, half-dead
Her astral body
Stronger than her mortal shell

Sleepwalking
Still talking
She's stalking
Sleepwalking
Sleepwalking
Still talking
She's stalking
Sleepwalking
She is in her sleep
Her prey somnambulist!
She is in her sleep
Her prey somnambulist!

In distorted rooms
Corridors to nowhere
In the depths of her coma
She has found her home
She's no longer alone
Forever she belongs there
Her astral body
Stronger than her mortal shell

Sleepwalking
Still talking
She's stalking
Sleepwalking
Sleepwalking
Still talking
She's stalking
Sleepwalking
She is in her sleep
Her prey somnambulist!
She is in her sleep
Her prey!
