In the holy river Ganges
In the river of karma and souls
Shiva speaks to the Goddess Kali
Gently breezes carry his voice
In the holy river Ganges
Pilgrims wash away their sins
And the water kisses their bodies
Like the priestess of your dreams

At the Sati ritual fires burn and burn
Flames will quickly take you down
You will drown in flames

In the sacred river Ganges
In the river of spirits and blood
Shiva speaks to the Goddess Kali
Kali will respect no god
On the hill there is a graveyard
Where the fire people lie
Those who cannot ever be there
To the river are sacrificed

At the Sati ritual fires burn and burn
Ganges endless waves still flow
But the ashes change

In the blessed river Ganges
There are many skulls and bones
Shive speaks to the Goddess Kali
Kali wants to kill us all
No more room for Kama Sutra
If you wish to stay alive
You are waiting for a new star
Maybe in another time

Take a dive into the waters
Swim and search the gate inside
You may find a lot of wonders
You may break it open wide
