A rude awakening, I realize
There's cold obsession in my eyes
An alien face that I've to show
Belonged to me some years ago
I'm not myself

I've killed my feelings, I'm soulless ice
There's cold obsession in my eyes
My second mind comes out again
Now filled with hatred and with pain
I'm not myself

Don't bullshit me with all that fiction
Your propaganda's the worst addiction
I don't believe a word you say
I wanna have and walk my way
You hide from death in lies of life
But then you die, who'll tell me why?

Although so young, I'm old and wise
There's cold obsession in my eyes
Facing my fears, I lose the fight
My soul is black and knows no light
I'm not myself

I've killed my feelings, I'm soulless ice
There's cold obsession in my eyes

Don't bullshit me with all that fiction
Your propaganda's the worst addiction
I don't believe a word you say
I wanna have and walk my way
You hide from death in lies of life
But then you die, who'll tell me why?
