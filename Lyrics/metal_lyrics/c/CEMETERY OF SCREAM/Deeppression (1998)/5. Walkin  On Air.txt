I know that someday as the light
Blur on my soul
will switch off.

You'll never know how much does your Gaze means for me
Touch of your hand. The whisper of the heart
Passing moments when I
Felt your breath
Whisper of the heart.

You'll never know
How many of a pain
How many of the suffering
Man can stand.

The limits are like an air
Loosin' the pride he's loosin' face.

I cannot feel anything apart of a reality
Tight as the cage of sad
I'm unable to hate
Unable to hate 'couse I...

Where the birds fly
Where the day wakes up
Where the smell of buyin' tomorrow
From traders of the dreams he was sittin'.
