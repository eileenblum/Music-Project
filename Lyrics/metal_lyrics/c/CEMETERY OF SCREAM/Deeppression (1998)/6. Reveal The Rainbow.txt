In the empty room
The stifling air daub closed inside four walls.
Liein' on my bed
I can see the stains
Over dirty floor
The passion' of creating heaven
In the middle of the rotten swamp.

I just don't want to know
when I kill my feelings
The night comes from behind the sun
And embracin' my world
Then the shadows die.

Prayin' for the silence
I have to find the way to run 'way from here
Run to the shelter
Line of the end
So far as dream 'bout you
Hung up like the rainbow
Between the reality'n'past.

I just don't want to know
when I kill my feelings
The night comes from behind the sun
And embracin' my world
Then the shadows die.
