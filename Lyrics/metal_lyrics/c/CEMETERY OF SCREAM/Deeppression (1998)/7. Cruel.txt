What did you give
Give to the man
Mind that can only fell'n'suffer
Heart made with
With daub smiles
Meaningless words
And bottomless torment.

What did you give to the man
when he with bowed head
With storm of feelings'n'passions
Dives in the whirl of existence.

Is it not to much?
Can we stand that whatt a grace is?
On the rough wave
Of the seeming might
Full of the pride
Cruel words as the weapon.
When one blow
One blow changes
mighty'n'rapid river
In the slime of the swamp.
When the end of
Dream 'bout life
Is so fast
Fast like cu of knife.

When hedies like an animal
With hate'n'fear in his eyes
He'll tear you heart out if
That will give him his life back.

Pray for all the sins that you have faked
With your lips
Full of the sand from the river of truth
That's the cynical worship
Cogs of the brain of the life
Loosin' control
Be aware or you'll be just the clown.
