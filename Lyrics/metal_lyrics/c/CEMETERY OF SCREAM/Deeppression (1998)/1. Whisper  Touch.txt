Everything remained for behind me
the longing in a middle of rapacious world

Your whisper and your touch I will never forget

I cannot hear a music
Empty'n'dead on the sockle of silence

I've left my gaze
I've left my gaze to be devoured
My reminiscences I've left
Left on the dusty carpet.

Neverending chase
Runin' blindly
Catchin' violently the breath with lips full of words.
Ardent gazes
Subtle movements
Your whisper and you touch I will never forget.

Subtle movements
Along the shallow border
settled by the breath
silent as a whisper.

What I want to say
I need time to understand
So close the smile
You're laughin' so close.

I trust in to your gestures touch of your eyes.
The touch of your whispers.
Words are so complicated
I just can't tell
I just can't tell.

In the middle of the world
Where reality died pressed down by hope.

I've left my gaze
I've left my gaze to be devoured
My reminiscences I've left
On the dusty carpet.

Neverending chase
Runin' blindly
Catchin' violently the breath with lips full of words.
Ardent gazes
Subtle movements
Your whisper and you touch I will never forget.

Subtle movements
Along the shallow border
settled by the breath
silent as a whisper.
