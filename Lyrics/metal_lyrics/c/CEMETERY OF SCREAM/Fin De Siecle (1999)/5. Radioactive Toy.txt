[originally performed by Porcupine Tree]

Run through the forest on a hot summer day
Trying to break down the walls of numbing pain
Give me a freedom to destroy
Give me a radioactive toy
Taster the water from the stream of running death
Eat the apple and cough a dying breath
Feel the sun burning through your black skin
Pour me into hole in form my next of kin
Run through grave-yards on a dusty winter day
Spit the dirt out and try to say:
Give me a freedom to destroy
Give me a radioactive toy
