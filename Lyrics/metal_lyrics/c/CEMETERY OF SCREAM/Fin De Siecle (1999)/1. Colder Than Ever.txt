Where the sky is burning
Where the fog is lying down its wings
On the brown soil
Where are the reefs of the asphalt trees
Like lost thought
I was flying
The wooden grief lost in silence
The scream of life cold as a shudder
The acrid taste of air
On the path I walk
Loos'n' my own breath
A fool with the tick'n' clock
Bitter sorrow made by moonlight
The guest-snake fortunate gambler
It's colder than ever
Bits of life fall'n' from my hands
Searching for a dream
I don't need it
