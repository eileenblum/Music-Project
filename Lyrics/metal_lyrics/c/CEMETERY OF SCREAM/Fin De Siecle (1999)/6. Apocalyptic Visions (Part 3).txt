Sad
Sad'n' sufferin'
That's the reward for eternal life
The red colour of a sunrise like blood
Pulsatin' in my veins
Shadows of the mother's tears
The nameless desert of an abyss
Dark'n' bare
Walls of my prison
Are screamin' out the voice of the past people
Where is my land of hope?
Worlds of despair'n' impotence, humiliation
