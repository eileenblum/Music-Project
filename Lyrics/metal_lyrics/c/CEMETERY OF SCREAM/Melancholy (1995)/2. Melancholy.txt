The lovers of night in the faded mouths
Brought the message of the hopeless solitude
Silent nature in the possessed dance
Bowed trees seem to pay the homage
Humiliation'n'death the gods of heaven
Irony of things which are still passing
Immortal'n'eternal march of the martyrs
Alone on the rock of might of existence
Dying in silence conscience like the rugged velvet
Empty balconies, the windows of closed lands
The rain is sappin' the blood from the death stones
Of the power of naked nothingness
So ridiculous in his sudden will of fight
Entanglin' the legs in mazes
Of eternal condemnation the hopeless of life
The smell of thousands of candles
Burnin' on the nameless tombs
For glory of the unknown pagan deities
You're overthrowin' the monuments to
Overthrow the nyth of power
Thorn of rose hurts your hand
Too weak to beat the soulless stuff
The gloom of soul and the sea of destiny
Melancholy of the silent funerals dry flowers,
Tears like tragic jokers
No one know your name blue flowers in the moonlight
Are bleedin' of your voice
