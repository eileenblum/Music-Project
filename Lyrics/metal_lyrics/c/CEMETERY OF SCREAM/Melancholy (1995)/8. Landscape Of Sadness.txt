The blue eyes full of hues and sunshine the sad mouth full of longin'n'desires
the puppets of the characters took out of fables they are making endless seas
The eye, nothing but a soulless shape
when the world and the universe are lying open
the night and black the opposition for day and white good and evil
thousands of colours like the sounds are flying up to the drew out hands
The dream, the spasm, the desire eternal target, motivation for a life
the black of curtain ending the play the weight of dead man eye-lids
limits of existence and perfection where the truth, where the flowers
where is the smell of thousands of flowers paradise
The landscape of paradise the landscape of life the landscape of sadness
