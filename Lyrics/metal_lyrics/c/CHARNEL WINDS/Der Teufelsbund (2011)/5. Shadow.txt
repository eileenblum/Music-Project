The impotent beast drowns
In the vomit of it's dying creation
The realm beyond gave meaning to agony
Beyond torment. Beyond everything and all.
Over blackened landscapes to bring ruin and bring death
The gestalt moves with the night wind

The endless funeral night
Ignorant creatures welter
In the blood of their own kin

Destruction from the stars that shifted in aeons
Primeval darkness. The first and only salvation!

No dawn!
The sun of hope forever eclipsed
Eternal worship. The funeral rite.

And the gestalt moves
With the night wind
