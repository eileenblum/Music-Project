I lie wounded stain with ash and blood
Crossing my pale furrowed hands
As I hurl down into the caves of my black heart

Mournful creatures of the moist earth
I witness their circling descend
Into the streams that separate gods from men

I've set to seek and destroy
Mirages, hungry apparitions

Thirsty shades, fetters of the self
That hold my fiery essence in these rusty chains

They must return, they must drown
They must be thrown into the (dark) waters below

As I descend deeper into hell
And cross the gnawing, gaping abyss
Many vain things leave my being

I behold at the dreadful Kali spreads her arms
The starry gates open wide as the
Ascent though the spheres beings
The wheel turns again as the
Lord of the mountain starts to cross
The thresholds of the daylight darkness once again
With rectifying virtue I stand again
And take my place amongst the beings of pure fire
