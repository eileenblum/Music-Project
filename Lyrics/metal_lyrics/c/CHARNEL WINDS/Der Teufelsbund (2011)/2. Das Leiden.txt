The bodies smeared with ashes to
Come before Teitan
And manifest the working laid
Out in the very blood of ours
Carriers of seed, dogs of typhÃ´n,
So saturnine and bleak

A thousand curses were sent forth
To violently dissolve
All stagnant forms
Devoid of meaning

For is
There
Not
A most
Profound
Joy
In the knowledge of dissolution?

Like some imperial birds of prey
We circle towards the vast
Infinity of space
Upon us a wound heavier
Than all those
Of their ragged Christ
As it is self-inflected
