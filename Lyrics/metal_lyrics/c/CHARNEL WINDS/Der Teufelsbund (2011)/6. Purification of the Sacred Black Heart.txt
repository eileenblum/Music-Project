Thou violator of perfection!
Verily, your creation was in vain!
Enjoy the melancholy and the pain

Behind the masks of agony
Behind all that is good or foul
Over blackened landscapes
In the dark night of soul
The shadow rides the night wind

For the sake of this
Disgust of conscious
The ultimate wound I grant to myself
And thus, to the others' selves
Those ignorant of their heavenly race
Clinging to the flesh not of their own
Waste of seeds by seven sown
The dying sun they face

Towards primeval darkness
We ride the beast of depths
Master sign mark your chests
And sacred asps our feet

No dawn but its star so bright!
In the bosom of ....
Through sacred vows of the funeral rite
In masters truth - our truth - we burn
