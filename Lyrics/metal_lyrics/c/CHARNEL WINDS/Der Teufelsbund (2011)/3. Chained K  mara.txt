What was the feeling so intense
I couldn't see, I couldn't hear
It revealed a secret to my sense:
Everything's already here

Like the chants of the dead
Or the boom of the winds
Thus produces gold from lead
Lifts the world from it's sins

It flows in through your ears
Let it shine, let it rend
Mortal weaknesses it sears
Or brings to the bitter end

Who is the akasic king
His palace under desert's dome
With constant state of solitude
Guards the passage to plerome

Nothing on this earth transcends
The working of his brotherhood
For he is the light of sense
Master Satan understood
