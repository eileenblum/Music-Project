This is where the light left you
Naked, raped and devoid
Of the symptoms indicating
A soulful life

Receive the blessings you did
Of the one who rode at dawn
Yet stained mercury with sulphur
And turned upside-down the law

Through the blackest will
A son of Lilith you have become
Put on a robe of matching colour
And hung the world around your neck

Crowned you were with the
serpent of sunrise
Having caught its head in your spear
Little we knew that it was you as wise
The abyss-beast of wisdom and fear

With the shape of a crocodile
As a mystic creature of the sea
Marking melancholy's reside
It binds us and sets us free

To take up a path of a magician
Is to see possibilities beyond god
To expand and overwhelm like Pleiades
Injected to the tissue of aditi
