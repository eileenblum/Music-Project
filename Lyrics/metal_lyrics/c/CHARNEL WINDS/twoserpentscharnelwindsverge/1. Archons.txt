(Where lies the quintessence?
There's no conflict whatsoever)

Archons
The holy angels
Archons
The guardian devils

(It's fire cracks your visible skull
Desperation flooding over you)

Archons
The pain sustained
By fetters
And stone

What is the will to strive and bloom
Compared to the ruthless deliberation
With which the universe
Grinds you to atoms

No one has the right to practice anything
In the name of anything else
Than naught
All is misery due to the ways of spirit
