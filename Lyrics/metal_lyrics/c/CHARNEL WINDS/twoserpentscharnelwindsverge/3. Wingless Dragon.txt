There they are, the birds of prey
In their ever-morbid flight
A fiery current in their wake
On they soar through the night

Below them the seas of souls
Seeking death, yet finding none
Without wings, gone afoul
Too blind to see the inner sun

Graveyards of spirit black and vast
Stretch across our mothers fields
For the human races past
Away by our father sealed

Their son, the prince holds the key
Behind his mask, in his essence
To opening the eyes to see
Through the terror of his presence

On their path to oblivion
Lacking virtue, lacking will
Devoid of chance to ascension
Are the dragons without wings
