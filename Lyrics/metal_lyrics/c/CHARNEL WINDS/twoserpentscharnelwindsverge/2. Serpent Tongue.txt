Hail the twisted tongue
That whips and writhes
Cuts and lashes
But never does it kill

Hail the evil tongue
That taunts and torments
Mocks and questions
But never does it judge

The power of verbum was usurped back
But as it turns out
It was just some
Horribly boring nightmare

Lick the beings that try to touch your light
From every side, from all-around
Worlds are burning in your heavenly rays
