Intelligence burns
To one forming inside the other
It thinks it transcends the center
When it flees to the arch

It's not about who you are
But the difference in equation
Between the sum of your parts
And you as a whole

To see the greatest of demons
Light our fathers semen on fire
Granting it to the waters below
To our delusive mother

The god-head was called forth
By the great fire in the west
Twisting every life it came to pass

Every satellite has the right to rebel
To question the motivation of its creation
All is misery due to the ways of matter
