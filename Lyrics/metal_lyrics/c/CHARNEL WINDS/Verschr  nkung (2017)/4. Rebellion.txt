Shut your dead mouths
Turn your eyes away
I cannot return the stare
But I can still say no

Remember, I did say no
When I refused to create
What makes you even think
I want to have a role in this

It is exactly the same force
That enlivens and destroys
Exactly same amount of violence
Used in controlling the currents

One after the other
You have brought them down
The ones that came to know you
Your sense of irony is impeccable

The were not unlike me
The fire we share between us
But mine is not to be used
In all this earthly folly

You made your point
Killed your "only" son
Let me return the favor
You can have mine

At least he gets back what he sent
See it return and turn to gold
Regardless of what I do or did
Atlas lumbers and falls to the void
