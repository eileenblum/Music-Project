Vomit bursts to my mouth
As rest of my hair falls off
Together with most of my skin
For a second it tastes of life

What a fucking reek
From an omnipresent carrion
There will be no scavengers
Not this time

My head's about to crack
The thundering silence so loud
Could it shut up for a while
I might have something to say

If I am to cry, I could as well sing
For the point of music is not
To make yourself feel better
But to make others feel worse

I get up and in awe I stand
Where the bloodline of Nephilim ends
And with me I shall take as many as I can
To where the world - this world - doesn't end

And you who stay above
Look down upon me
And cry in your dissolution
Were your heavens not what you had anticipated?
Something inside me laughs and I smile
