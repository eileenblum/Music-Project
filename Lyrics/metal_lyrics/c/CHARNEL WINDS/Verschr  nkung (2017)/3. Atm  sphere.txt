Akasa flees its abodes
The supposedly hollow cavities
Latent fire once sealed within
Human brain and bone

The atmosphere flickers
Into a strangest colour
If only someone could recall
That shade of eerie blue

Blade of a spear reflects
That deep-dark indigo shine
Before it strikes down
Tearing air as it comes

Carving a third eye
Into every forehead
Something stares through
The myriad of putrid eyes

Some morbid wind animates
Countless dead lips and tongues
To muttering their own eulogy
Under the inert firmament
