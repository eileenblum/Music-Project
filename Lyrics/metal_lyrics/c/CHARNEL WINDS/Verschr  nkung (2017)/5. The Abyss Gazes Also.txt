As the fire-born bowed down his head
And let his flames purge the wold
The son came to realize
True cost of his fathers love

But we made it, didn't we?
Through fervent song and constant yoga
Nirvana lies beyond the last veil
The effort was well worth the while

A kumara still caught in entanglement
There was no benefit to gain
Your journey is a blink of an eye
To some of those loftier beings

But I figured out the means to an end
Found the bed-rock under my feet
Are you saying all that pain and ecstasy
Amount to nothing?

Look inside the box
Carefully fold the sides open
And see for yourself
If the world you sought is alive or dead

But I found true consciousness
(Just the sum of your dillusions)

I found enlightenment
(Just the gleam of your false pride)

I found the source of intelligence
(Just the bottomless well of your ignorance)

I found god
(Just a world born dead)

The world you strived to save
Is a necropolis inside a cubicle
While you reached for samadhi
Your soul approached rigor mortis
