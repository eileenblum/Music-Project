Who are you? A voice without a body,
A mind without a reason

Who is the questioner?
I name myself after those I kill,
For I am the god of hosts, paramashiva,
Paramatma, parapara, the bastard son of nothing

I hear the tumult and chaos raging
Above the nothing which was life
Inside this cocoon of worlds the stars are waging
War against being
No events: horizon collapses to the final roller-coaster ride
Beyond null reality

All is gone now, my beautiful Self;
And within this bubble of non-being
Soon to burst without a hold but
The enlightened panorama of my mind
I face him who is the prince beyond countenances

The void at the rainbow surface of the final thought form's mother-of-pearl
No tears nor cracks, nor a puzzle anymore to face as flesh
I am ready for the ultima thule of spirit's un-avitchi, no doubt

This seeming end is a final koan for you, Ouroboros:
Answer me and let everything drop into perdition
Or remain silent and be killed nevertheless in shame

Immortal lady escapes - red ceases to be
The black sun the last rays it sends - infinity ends
