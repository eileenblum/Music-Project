The spark of the source flees
From an already empty composite
So broken, so tired

Well did it pay
To make service for those fleeting demons
Being, once be whole
Purposefully stained with muddy waters

So this was the price and gift
Of my unconditional homage
For the mask so beautiful and horrid

Well did it pay
To forcefully grasp all the latent powers of matter
The mirror of mind once so timid and sharp
Shattered to million fucking fragments

So this was the secret
Of my separation and fall
From the ranks of men so noble and good

Remains left into the shady banks of unholy death
By leaving this precious body behind
I become an abomination for the race

To devour the cursed fruits of misguided deeds
So monstrous, so shallow
And in this painful, unearthly ecstasy
Devour them I shall - to a final bitter piece!
