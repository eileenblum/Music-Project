Covens of nocturnal witchery
Are once again gathered
To the sacrificial pits of old
Beyond the towering black forest
Under His black eye
To glorify the One with Horns
The unholy rituals take place

Raise the goat-horns to the sky in defiance
Let the ground drink deep of your blood
Harness the clandestine knowledge as your weapon
Reveal the long lost ways of death!

Shine! O Azazel!
Upon and from within
The living altars
Legion of Hate
At this night of terror and morbid works

Worship!
