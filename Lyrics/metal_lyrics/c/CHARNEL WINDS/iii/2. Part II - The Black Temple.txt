In the black temple mysteries unveil
Arise with the third,
O' disciples of the true living god

Engravings on the walls,
Veins opened to receive the calls,
Those of an ever-bleeding heart

O' sun-serpent, thou wind-fire
Thy fiery crest is a funeral pyre,
For the one who in the desert lies chained
Arise, O' kaos dragon
The source of my ray you are
The deaths cardinal I faced

Verily, thy altar shall face west,
And be set a flame at dawn

The nature of your sacred god,
Is summoned and revealed,
In a view over cracked moonlight seal
Where the great mothers work continues.
Endlessly....
