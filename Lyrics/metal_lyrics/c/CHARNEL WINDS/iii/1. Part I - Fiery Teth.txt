Verily,
This is where was granted the flame
In the feet of the ophite statues
Under the forbidden fruit's numinous fragrance
With fervour, with words of devotion
I drink deep from the grail of blood and taste the divine madness

So I keep returning to the most sacred heart
Drawn by the winds of melancholy and their songs of this division
Driven by the thrashing serpent longing to be unbound.

And here contemplate the flame and shadow
See them entwine
There is no refuge from the great black time
It must all burn to ashes

Descend with the scarab to the cthonic labyrinths below
Seek within the womb and kill thyself once more
Oh, then to see the dawn emerge with the scarab over these ruins
Such beauteous self-immolation under the black sun
Throughout the cycle, reverse the poison until there is naught but trance-end-dance.
