God left me in a box
So, I learned to be a moth
You couldn't find my face
And, still I washed it clean
Science was a field
Of which you knew so well
Your moon is just a rag
That is used to polish all my chains
Your ego needs a beating (break its knees)
Before you fight with me in my home

It'll be all good
Just don't give up the fight
Or, I will tell them fools
That you blossomed like a joke
Mercy was a dog that you had once adored
Its howls attached to me
Because you wouldn't give it love 

Your ego needs a beating (break its knees)
Before you fight with me in my home
My moth tongue needs more sugar (low on high)
Because you stole it all from my tears! 

I see you, I feel you! 
I don't want them to knowâ¦ 
I see you, and I feel you! 
I don't want them to knowâ¦ 
(I can't believe that you've grown)

My skin is peeling off 
It's peeling in reverse
Sworn myths of wildness
Full of remote controls

I blind you
I can't let you feel anymore
I don't even want to look at you
But, I can't help it
