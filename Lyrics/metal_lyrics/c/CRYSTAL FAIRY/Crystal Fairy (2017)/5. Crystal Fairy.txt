In the middle of December I begin to feel uneasy
(Awakening to northern lights)
Suddenly
I get the feeling that someday
I'll wear a garden strapped onto my head
God (no one) stares

Reality of all my headaches 
It's just the drag that brought me illness
Succumbs to me
The reason that I take from all your dread

I know it's not so easy
Can't seem to stop this bleeding

As a modest yearning shudder
It recedes to take my order
(Replenishing all western thighs)
Hesitated
Turned the switch off
Rented apples from a Manson
Sewn within the sleeve (Of) no one shares.

Prosperity lives in the restroom
It's not the go that makes me cough
Appeals to you:
For reasons that are known by all your shelves! 
I know it's not so easy
Can't seem to stop this bleeding
I'm just a man of he she
When you can see right through me

My name is Crystal Fairy

(Hey yo, Crystal, do you want a cigarette? Hehehehe, come on) 

I believe in three sections of the mind
But, if I seal all the pieces they will rise
Your head is filled with sorrow
It's not a pill of lust
My head is not a number

I know it's not so easy
Can't seem to stop this bleeding
I'm just a man of he she
When you can see right through me

I'm a wire
I'm a wire
I'm a wire
I'm a wire
