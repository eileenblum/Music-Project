I'm only 14
My heads within the clutches of sin

Got skulls on my walls
I've got a goat skin rug

I've got a possessed stereo
With an earphone connect

I put the phones
Up on my head
Get really stoned
Freak out on my bed

I listen to forbidden sound
Which comes from deep beneath the ground
I listen to forbidden song
Which only I can sing along

Voodoo dolls, crystal balls
And all the answers to these things lie in the song

Magic spell, messages from hell
All these things and more
Playing on my possessed stereo 
But, will I hurt? 

I listen to forbidden sound
Which comes from deep beneath the ground
I listen to forbidden song
Which only I can sing along

Possessionâ¦
Possessionâ¦
Possessionâ¦
Possession!
