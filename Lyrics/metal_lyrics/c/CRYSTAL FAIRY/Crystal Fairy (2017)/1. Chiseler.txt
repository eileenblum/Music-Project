There is no victory when you're a stool with a desolate scent
The air is low
It'll feed from the swamp that you'll soon become
In denial there is no end
Every monkey must transcend

When you think you're all dried up
Bright waves of heat will take what's left 
So, hide yourself from the sun 
After you melt 

Why is there such a place where you're born with a sentence of death?
The mood is dense
I can feel it from a mile away
In denial there will be light
Just a second, no there won't! 

When you think you're all dried up
Bright waves of heat will take what's left
So, hide yourself from the sun
After you melt

As a child, his fingertips were turning blue
Plastic nightmare: he realized that he was a jewel
Understated misery is what he needs to feel alive

When you think you're all dried up
Bright waves of heat will take what's left
Hide your smile

Under the ray of light you still convince yourself to dance
Stinks like fungus even if you're bone and slime
The burning fuzz won't stop your howls
