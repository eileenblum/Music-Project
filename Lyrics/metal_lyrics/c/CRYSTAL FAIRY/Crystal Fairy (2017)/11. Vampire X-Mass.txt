Open the latch of Christmas Eve
Elitist chimneys of foreign bellies constantly falling inside a hole
Where every shouldered tooth is worth three pennies 

Ho, ho, ho, ho! 
Release the bell before the snow retracts! 

Fever will strike the temple of
The men who run away with naughty children
Black boots disintegrate from musk
The fireplace is on, the children smell him!

Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Let's feed the deer until he comes back-

Gravity helps lingering a little bit more tolerable
The night is made of diamond reigns
When denied the hall of shame

Unleash the ash
Beneath the lie

Unleash the bells
Beneath the cries

Take a whip to wash the back
Of Santa's slaves
Even if they love him so!
