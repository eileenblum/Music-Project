Look at me, under pounds of trouble
It mimics all of my rubbles 
Set me free from these strands of hair
They picnic on Jude's sisters
Under bricks of boats 
Free me from myself

How much longer will it be while I wait for gratitude? 
Anemic apes would never share chicken coups:
Pink-silver guts
How much longer will it be while I wait for gratitude?

I'm in a jam
Nobody wants my money
So, I threw it out of the window
Kids wreak of bitch tainted by piss troubles
'Made an imp out of me, peels at old remains

How much longer will it be while I wait for gratitude? 
Anemic apes would never share chicken coups:
Pink-silver guts
How much longer will it be while I wait for gratitude?
Look at me, under all this hair
Look at me, feeling quite undone
Living under trouble
