You want loving

It's always you that want's all the squeezing, baby
It's always you that wants all the pleasing, honey

You need hand softness over my rancid jagged shoes
It's always you who does all the hushing, baby
It's always you who does all the hushing, baby

I want nothing
I want nothing
You want loving
You want loving

It's always me who does all the running, baby
It's always me who does all the hiding, baby
It's always me who does all the hiding, baby
It's always me who does all the hunting, baby

An angel with a razor in her pocket
Slowly slips on to the streets a vaporous hoax
Craves tomorrow's pills
She creeps into a corner made for sneaking up on fools
Was never sure she'd hurt one 'till the moans release their sounds

Let me go on home to the family-wife
I'll carry on the cryptic passion of remorse 
Send this wire down
And give me one chance
I'll bury all the senseless: necklace of divorce

Won't she teach us all the ways tonight?
I'll carry all the shifted rain, ah! 

You want loving
You want loving
You want huh, huh, huh!
You want loving

It's always you who does all the hushing, baby
It's always you who does all the hushing, baby

I need hungry feeling 
It's always me who does all the working, sugar
It's always me who does all the running, baby
