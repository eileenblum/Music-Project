Rose weekend hips of Anahi are caught on fence-tail fingertips
Bites against the sleazy hold of layered bunion's modest crime

Strips the curves, replaced by rust
She digs her way out, wronged by thieves

And I do not dare say to her to stop the fainting of seeds
'Cause then nobody keeps approaching my mime under a wave
Southern cigarettes keep an air in a vase
Before the giant envelope wraps you up to a crisp 

Sun bathe the crash that knows so little 
Next to grim tongues no one will shine high

Yesterday's presumptions have trailed city rocks 
Smitten by a certain type of ease 
Regulate Anahi's thoughts 

Please believe the foiled grounds
They've been showered with limbs

And, still the woman sleeps
Forbidden to fly through closed ticks 

Around the dusk she had the firm belief she would not speak
No need to hide underground when mother's a jar

Sun bathe the crash that knows so little 
Next to grim tongues no one will shine high

Yesterday's presumptions have trailed city rocks 
Smitten by a certain type of ease 
Regulate Anahi's thoughts 

Yes, she's all alone in a forest looking for a tree to undress
Clips and skins all the branches off, carves the letters of her name
When suddenly a man shows up the size of God, no smile or shame
She doesn't care, she gives a damn, continues to un strip the bark
Restrains the roots, she uses them to cut out her eyes
The iris shines, the sun is born, the man begins to laugh!
