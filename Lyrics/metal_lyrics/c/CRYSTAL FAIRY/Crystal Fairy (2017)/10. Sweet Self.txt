You're living a lie
You're living a lie
You're living a lie
With your sweet self 

You're high and dry
Like a manic sigh
I can't relate to your denial 

Under weathered, in the shower
The tub fills up with tantrum tangerines
Sweet liquor on the pictures 
Interrupted by a man who yells my name
He tells me to put down the apple
Then he hands me a device of speech
Forcing it against my oval face
I can hear my father's voice

You're living a lie
You're living a lie
You're living a lie
With your sweet self
You're high and dry like a manic sigh
I can't relate to your desire

I'm living a lie
I'm living a lie
I'm holding the truth of my sweet self
I'm low and wet like a preaching cry 
You can't relate to me at all
To me at all
To my sweet self
To my sweet self
