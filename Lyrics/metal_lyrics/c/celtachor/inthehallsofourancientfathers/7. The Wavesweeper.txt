Towards the Hill of Miochaoin, they went
Brian faced Miochaoin, and they fought
Like two beast's they attacked
And as the sun rose Miochaoin fell

As they heard their father's cry
The Sons Of Miochaoin,appeared
Corc,Conn and Aedh ,the champions gathered
Courage Strength and honor in their thought's
Spear's held tight against their enemy
The Last stand of defence on their father's hill
The Sons of Tuireann adamant on their task
They began to clash.

Driving their spear's into Tuireanns Son's 
The Sons in turn did the same
Although death was upon them
The task was still at hand
Nearly at death and bereft of time
Brian called to his brother's
Let u rise up and climb the hill
And give the three shouts.

And with that Brian helped them up
He raised them up with one in each hand
Shedding river's of blood,they gave the three shouts
Brian returned his brother's to the Wavesweeper.

Manannan's Wavesweeper was ancient
It was a sacred curragh
It sailed fast on air and water
With the ferocious speed of the wind
The Son's traveled for many year's with despair and grief
They came to Beinn Edair
And their Father' dun
And asked him for help.

The Brother's gave the spit to Tuireann
Give it to Lugh in friendship
For they needed the healing,power of the pigskin
For death had nearly claimed them.

Tuireann journeyed to Teamhair
In the search for Lugh
He handed over the cooking spit
And asked for the pig skin
Lugh turned and refused him
Even for the earth in gold
Brian asked again and got the same
To their death's they would go.

Brian left and returned to his brothers
And as he lay, the life went from him
He lay dead there, with his brethern
A quest for their life's in vain
Tuireann cried and lamented for his sons
Each of them could have been a king
And so he fell and died with a broken heart
The Son's and him buried in one grave.
