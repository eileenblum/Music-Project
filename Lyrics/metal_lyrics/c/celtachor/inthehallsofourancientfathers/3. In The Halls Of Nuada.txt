Lugh went to Nuada, of the Silver Arm
At the Great Feast of Temhair,Celestial fires burn bright
I am Lugh son of Cian and Ethlinn
What are you skilled in Master of all arts?
I am champion,carpenter,harper and smith
I am magician ,poet and cupbearer,

Nuada challenged him to a game of chess
And ever game played Lugh won
None like him have entered here,His face as bright as the sun
Lugh took the throne for thirteen days ,and not a day more.

To fight against the fomor!!

Lugh went to Grellach Dollaid
with the Dagda ,Nuada and Ogma
To make plans and wage war on the fomor
The place was called"The Whisper of the Men of Dea"
The council broke for three long years
Lugh traveled to the Sons of Manannan
To Prepare for War!

Nuada held a great assembly 
At the hill of Uisneach
The Warriors gathering grasping
their spears and shields
And over the hills came a brightnes
Like that of the setting sun to the west

Lugh and the Riders of the Sidhe
Galloping over the plains
On Manannans Horse Aonbharr
Swift as the wind,and strong as the sea

In the distance messangers
Nine times nine of the fomor come forth
Looking for tax's and fines 
From the men of ireland
Four of the most foul fomori
Eine,Eathfaigh Coron and Compar
Bringers of Dread

A rage came onto Lugh
As he grabbed the Answerer
And watched as the 
De Danann rose for the fomor
A fire in his eyes
That could not be quenched
Anger rose in him
He brought a fight to them
 and the ildanach said!

"Why do you rise up before that surly, slovenly troop, when you did not rise up before us?"
