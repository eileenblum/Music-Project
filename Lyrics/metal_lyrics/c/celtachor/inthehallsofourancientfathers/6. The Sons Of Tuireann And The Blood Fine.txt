Lugh passed down the bloodfine
to Luchar, Brian and Lucharba
For killing his father Cian
Wounded as a pig and killed as a man
Bring me,

Three apples,a spear,two horses,seven pig's
The skin of a pig and a cooking spit
A dog's whelp and three shouts on a hill
This is what i ask "Lugh said.

The Apples from the Garden of the East
The Pig skin of Tuis,King of Greece
The deadly Spear of the King of Persia
Pigs from Easal King of the Golden Pillar's.

The Horse's and Chariot , of Dobar of Siogair
The Hound Fail-Inis from the king of Ioruaidh
The Cooking spit from the women, of Inis Cenn-Fhinne
and the Shouts from the hill of Miochaoin!

A Sorrow fell on the Sons of Tuireann
Manannann's Wavesweeper was given
Tuireann watched in dismay and Lamented
Ethne turned and looked with grief
They left ireland with heavy hearts
And began their quest for Lugh
Through Death and Destruction they would venture
Till the blood fine was met.

In the Garden of the East,They turned into hawk's
Carrying the apples in their claw's
In the Court of Greece,they disguised as poet's
They killed the king and took the skin of the pig
They then went and killed the King of Persia
Found the spear its head in a cauldron of water
So it would not burst aflame!!

Heading to Siogair in the guise of paid soldier's
They stayed for a fortnight and a month
They found the horses and drove
The spear of Persia through the King's heart
Then to the King of Golden Pillar's
Easal met them and gave them the seven pig's
Through free will, As he would surely fall.

Arriving at the coast of Ioruaidh
In search for the Hound from the King
Easal told the story of the quest to persuade him
He refused and they began to clash
The king was bound ,the hound was given
And peace reclaimed.

Lugh had heard of the success of the Son's of Tuireann
He cast a spell of Forgetfullness upon them
With a desire to return to Eire
When they arrived something was amiss
They paid the fine to the king
But they had forgotten the spit and three shouts on the hill!!!!

The Sons were hit with grief and sorrow 
At what had happened
They went to the island of Long haired women
And claimed the spit for themselves
Leaving the shores in the curragh
To give three shouts on a hill
To Miochaoin!!!!
