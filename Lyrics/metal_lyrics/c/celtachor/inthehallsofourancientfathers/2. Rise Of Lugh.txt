Upon the Horizion,The Tower of glass stands tall
Balor of the evil eye ,watchs over all
The sons of nemed attacked with the power of druid spells
A great wave swallowed them and took them to the depths

A Druid told Balor,he would fall to a grandson
he sent his only daughter ,Ethlinn away into the tower of glass
Twelve women put there to guard and protect
To never see or hear the name of a man
and to grow beautifull.

Cian, Goibniu and Samthainn
Three brothers of the tuatha de danann
Residing at Druim na Teine
The Ridge of the fire
Guarding the glas gaibhnenn
Who's milk would never fail
From the theiving hordes
that coveted her.

Balor had set his eyes on it as well
Turning into a Young boy he tricked Samthainn
and as the brothers quarelled about the iron and steel
He left the forge,snatched the cow and crossed the sea.

Cian traveled to the Mountains to find the druid Birog
She dressed him as a woman and sent him across the sea
in a gust of wind......
As they entered the tower of glass
Birog put a spell of sleep upon them,
Cian found Ethlinn and she gave herself to him
But by the winds,he was sent away

And Ethlinn bore a son!!
Balor found out and a fear grew on him
He sent his people to put the child in cloth and to secure it with a pin
Balor commanded that the child ,be tossed into the sea
As the waves crashed,tumbled and fell
A newborn thought to have drowned
The one prophesised ,to end the tyrants reign....

Birog saved the child and brought him to Cian
and he sent him to Taillte,Daughter of the Great Plain
Thus Lugh was born 
and a saga began..
