As the winds blow across Uisneach
Lugh prepares to attack
Driving the fomorians back to their lands
To send a message of war to balor!

No more shall we stand idle by
As our kin and our lands are oppressed
The Sun is setting on our shores
from the east and in the west
Lugh grabed his spear and his shield
and Launched himself through the wind
And as the fomor ran in terror 
Lugh set upon them 
ATTACK!

With blood on his ancient shield
He drove his spear into fomorian hide
Relentless with Rage,Fighting till the end
The bodies strewn and scattered

Crushing bone with tempered steel
Through armour battered and worn
The Call of war rings through theplains
As the horns bellow a new age
Ancient kings of Dana
 look upon,Lugh with pride
Many warriors will fall and heroes will bleed 
Till our lands are free
Forevermore

He made a end of eight nines of them
The last nine protected by the king
To send word back,to the tyrant balor
And tell the story from beginning to end
As the fires burn on the distant hills
And the waves crash upon Lochlann
The tides of battle are set in stone
As the flames flicker and die

Nuada and Lugh look to the horizion
Horns of war proclaim!
A great battle will take place soon
The Wrath of Balor comes forth!

War!!!!

As the fires and flames flicker and die.....
