On the isle of Lochlann
Balor gazes across the wild seas
Ceithlenn his wife reveals
the identity of the attacker
He is the son of our daughter and grandson
as it was foretold by the druids...

The council of fomorian chiefs met
Eab,Seanchub Neid and Liath
Lobais the Druid and the nine of poets of 
Foreknowledge,Balor and Ceithlinn
Plan to amass a army for Bres to 
take and fight with across the sea!!

Prepare Seven Great Battalions
Of the Riders of the Fomor
I will go to Ireland and
strike off Lugh's head and bring it back to Berbhe
Ready my ship's Bres said
Armour and Weapons ready towards 
the Violent Waves..

Bres and Elathan ready the men
The Riders pack onto the ships
Spears and shields glistening in the sun
Mist rises from the depths
Ready to Fight and Burn the land's
And clash with the De Danann Horde
A figure near the harbour comes forth.

Balor commanded that ireland
Be tied to the back of their ships
Give battle to the ildanach 
And strike off his head
Let the waters swallow
and consume the land and
bring it to the north of lochlann

None of the men of dea
Will ever find it there...

RISE FOMOR RISE!!

The Monstrous ships leave the harbour 
Pull up the painted sailâs of war

They land at the harbour of Eas Dana
Sending out a army to Connacht in the West
Burning and Killing destroying the Plains
The Son of the Dagda Fell
King Bodb Dearg!!!!
