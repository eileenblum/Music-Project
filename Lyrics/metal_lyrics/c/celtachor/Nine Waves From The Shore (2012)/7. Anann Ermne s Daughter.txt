Anann, Ernmas's Daughter 
Deep within Temhair she dwell's 
A raging fire by a great cooking spit, 
The Crow of battle 
Wandering overhead. 

Anann, She is the Crow of battle. 
Anann, trinity of the Morrigan. 
Anann, Eyes on the battlefield. 
Anann, Flying overhead. 

Mechi one of her sons died 
By Mac Cecht on Magh Fertaige. 
Three Hearts Serpent bound within, 
For if mechi lived, 
Anything living in 
Ireland would have wasted away. 
At the top of Magh Luathad 
The Plain of Ashes, 
Mac Cecht did burn his three hearts 
And threw them into a stream. 

The water turned black as death 
And everything within it died. 
The sun covered in the shade 
Of a hundred crows. 

The Morrigan lifting 
The dead from battle 
To their final resting place. 
Goddess of Battle, Strife, Fertility. 
Your form of crow, wolf and eel, 
Anann is her name. 
The Trinity of the Morrigan, 
Badb, Macha and Nemain. 

Deep within Temhair she dwell's 
A raging fire by a great cooking spit, 
Carrying the warriors 
To the great hall's 
Of high kings.
