The Dagda at his home 
Of Brugh Na Boinne 
The Hall of the Morrigu 
And Cermaits Birthplace within 
The Prison of The Grey 
Of Macha The Hill Of Dabilla 
Where the Hound of Boann did be. 
In these Halls the Sorrow of the Dagda! 

At one time the Dagda made a vat, 
For his daughter Ainge she was proud, 
She decided to create 
`Her own out of wood and sticks. 
Nuadas Son Gaible found it 
And threw it away. 
A great shadow and curse 
Befell the Dagda. 

One day a man of Connacht 
Did come to see him with his wife. 
Corrgenn was his name, 
Aedh had fallen for his wife. 
That Great anger exploded 
And he killed Aedh in response. 
Everyone thought the Dagda 
Would kill him but he did not, 
He sat with a troubled brow 

And thought about his life. 
He spared his life 
But there would have to be a toll. 
Looking at Aedhs body, 
He knew what must be done, 
To avenge him and to bring peace 
To his home and to his son, 
And as the morning dawn creeped in, The truth and toll became clear. 
"Corrgenn Take my son and carry him, Upon your back and never let him fall, 
Find a gravestone the same size fitting For my son and bury him there." 
Corrgeen spent an age looking for 
The stone and the journey was hard, 
On Loch Feabhail he finally had found it And he rested Aedhs body there. 
Corrgenn did lift the stone 
Above his head 
A glimpse of hope in his eye! 
But no sooner had he 
Lifted the stone he himself fell, 
And he died. 
The Dagda, beside himself with grief, Summoned two of his men 
To build a rath around his son 
And Corrgenn's grave. 
Imheall and Garbhan shaped it 
And made it so. 

The Hill Of Aileac was its name... 
The Hill of Signs and of Stone... 
Made by tears of blood. 
The Sorrow of the Dagda.
