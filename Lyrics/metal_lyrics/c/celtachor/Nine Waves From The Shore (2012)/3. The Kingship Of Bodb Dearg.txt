After Tailtin, the Tuatha 
Were without a place to remain. 
Manannan created a new home, 
Among the hills and valleys 
Of Ireland hidden, 
That no man could see through 
But pass through. 

The Tuatha were assembled 
In the halls in council. 
"We need a king to be over us" 
The Tuatha did say. 
Bring forth those 
Who would be fit to be King. 

From the White Field Lir 
Of Sidhe Fionnachaidh 
From Ilbrech of Ess Ruadh, 
Bodh Dearg of the Dagda born 
From Bri Leith, Midhir the Proud, 
And Angus Og, Son of the Dagda. 

The Circle formed in the great halls 
And the Council of High Men 
They did gather, 
For the sake of the Dagda and the Tuatha de Danann 

Bodh Dearg must and will be king. 
WILL BE KING 

Leaving the halls for his enchanted Home in Sidhe Femen, 
The Tuatha raise their spears 
And shields in glory to him. 
The war drums echo to 
The chants of the druids 
And men and women of the Tuatha, Unite! 

In his hall of Brugh Na Boinne 
Bodb Dearg he is king, 
Along the hillside and the valleys, 
The winds whip through the plains, 
In his throne and in his halls, 
Celebration claims into the night. 
The Dagda on the hill 
Looking at the KING. 
His Son! 
His Son!
