Queen Eriu with the Men of Dea 
Fought the Sons of the Gael, 
Fais and Scota met their death, 
Laid between valley and mountain. 
The Sons of the Gael lost 
Three hundred men, 
But took with them 
The lives of a thousand. 

Eriu went back to Tailtin, 
Aer and Eithis were buried, 
The Gael journeyed to Inver Colpa! 
A message of war was sent 
To Cermaits Son's 
To battle for Ireland's kingship 
Once and for all, 
They came with the best 
Of Tuatha de Danann, 
The Sons of the Gael remembered the death of Ith! 
Great tides of battle crashed 
Into the fray. 
The Gaels had broke the Men of Dea, 
Warrior's lay strewn 
Among Tailtin's fields, 
Food for the crows to dine and feast. 

Sword and Spear 
Battered Shields 
Banners Blown 
Across by the wind. 
A fire fading on the hill. 
A Battle standard remains. 

Eriu, Fodhla and Banba perished 
With three of their kings! 
The Gael masters of Ireland forever! 
The Tuatha fell into great disarray, 
Followed still by the Gael. 
The Men of Dea overthrown 
Ireland belonged to the Gael. 
Heber took Munster 
And gave part to Amergin, 
Heremon claimed Leinster 
And Connacht. 
Ulster was claimed 
By Eimher at Emain Macha. 

Sword and Spear 
Nine hundred years 
Banners blown 
Across by the wind. 
On the hills of Emain Macha 
A Battle standard remains. 

The Men of Dea were overthrown, 
The Gael masters of Ireland forever.
