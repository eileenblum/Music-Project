As the sun shone on the day of battle,
The Men of Dea rose up,
Nuada and Lugh on the horizon
Sending their armies to war.

And still they march on,
To protect their homes
Spears and shields by their sides.
The Battle was frantic,
Many were lost,
The King Nuada did fall.

Lugh flew through the air
with his spear Gael Bolga held tight.
The horns of battle bellowing,
Uniting the screams from both sides.
A river of blood in its wake
The Men Of Dea went forth
To crush their enemies,
The Fomorian horde.
