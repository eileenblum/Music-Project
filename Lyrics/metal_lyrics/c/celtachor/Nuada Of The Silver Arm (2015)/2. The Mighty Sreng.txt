King Eochaid of the Fir Bolg's,
Had a meeting with his men,
A warrior to face the Tuatha.
His name the Mighty Sreng.
In return watchers of the Tuatha
Sent their own champion, Bres.
Both warriors observed each other
By the hillside of the mountain pass.

Raise your spears to the sky
Sword and shield grasped tight!
Eyes full of fire
Magh Nia, ready and willing to Fight!
Raise your spears to the sky
Sword and shield grasped tight!
Eyes full of fire
Magh Nia, ready and willing to die!

The two became puzzled,
When they spoke in their mother tongue.
They spoke in Irish and came to speak,
Laying down their shields for fear.
Observing the craft of each other's spear
To learn each ways fatal!
Craiseach was it's name,
The name Sreng gave them.

Raise your spears to the sky
Sword and shield grasped tight!
Eyes full of fire
Magh Nia, ready and willing to die!
Raise your spears to the sky
Sword and shield grasped tight!
Eyes full of fire
Magh Nia, ready and willing to fight!

Bres turned to Sreng and said
We will take half of Ireland!
And if we can not,
A war will begin, blood will flow.
Sreng went back to his king,
Told of what he'd learned,
When the king heard the offer he said:

Raise your spears to the sky
Sword and shield grasped tight!
Eyes full of fire
Magh Nia, ready and willing to Fight!
Raise your spears to the sky
Sword and shield grasped tight!
Eyes full of fire
Magh Nia, ready and willing to die!
