Ships of fire burst through
The mist of the skies,
The Tuatha DÃ© Danann,
From the high air, arrive.
Four corners of the world,
Four cities, four wise men,
Four treasures!
Morias, Urias, Arias and Senias.

Nuada the High King,
ManannÃ¡n, god of the Sea,
Ogma god of Ogham,
DiancÃ©cht god of Life,
Ãire, FÃ³dla and Banba,
And Dana the All Mother.

The first day of Bealtaine,
King Eochaid of the Fir Bolgs came
With his army from the South.
Residing in Magh Rein
Till the day of battle arrived.
The Tuatha arrived from the
Northwest of Connacht
To meet their enemy at Magh Rein.

The calm before the storm,
Winds whip through the fields of Temhair.

King Eochaid had a dark vision,
He told his druids,
In turn they told the King
That a strong enemy
Was rising up against him,
It would not be long till war would begin.
