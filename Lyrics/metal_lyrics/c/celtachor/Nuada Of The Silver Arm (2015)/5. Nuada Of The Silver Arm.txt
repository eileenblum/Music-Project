In the midst of that great battle, Nuada did loose his arm,
War cries in the deep,
Bodies at his feet,
The air thick loud and deafening
Steel through bone, fighting till death.
He rose between the valleys,
Let out his battle cry.
A great sickness, claimed the king.
Diancecht forge me a new arm!
The smith started to plan,
Lighting the fires once more.

Forging the Silver Arm,
In the great fires of Temhair
Sparks and embers ignite.
The clash of the Hammer on Steel,
The Arm rising from the flames,
The High King reborn,
The High King now whole.

Nuada Silver Arm, Nuada Airgead Lamh!
Nuada Silver Arm, Nuada Airgead Lamh!

Nuada returned to the Tuatha,
At the great halls of Temhair,
Now whole, he could claim
Back the throne.
Once again High King.
Anger possessed Bres,
He went to Eri for guidance.
Seek your father,
A ring of gold, Bres did claim.
They left on a silver vessel,
To the lands of the Fomor and their king,
Upon reaching Fomorian shores,
Elathan met his son Bres,
And he sent him to meet
Balor of the Evil Eye!

Nuada Silver Arm, Nuada Airgead Lamh!
Nuada Silver Arm, Nuada Airgead Lamh!
