I'm right here in front of you and I can't stop sh-sh-shaking
I can't stop sh-sh-shaking. come on and hold me still

did my heart love until now cause I feel as though
I've never seen beauty till this night
I'm forever, yeah, I'm forever yours.

you're wearing your skin like it's too tight.

and there she was; reflecting so brightly the warmth that she installs
and there she was; we were infinite for a moment

There's not one girl here that will be lead by her conscience
in a world where every girl wants to be a model
what's wrong babe? did daddy not give you enough attention.

did my heart love until now cause I feel that
I've never seen beauty till this night
I'm forever, yeah, I'm forever yours

take back what's mine. just leave me in it
and everything that I believe in.
shes shaking. shes shaking. please act surprised.
shes shaking. shes shaking. please act surprised.
shes shaking. shes shaking. please act surprised.
shes shaking. shes shaking.

and there she was; reflecting so brightly the warmth that she installs
and there she was; we were infinite for a moment
and there she was; we were infinite for a moment
and there she was; we were infinite for a moment
