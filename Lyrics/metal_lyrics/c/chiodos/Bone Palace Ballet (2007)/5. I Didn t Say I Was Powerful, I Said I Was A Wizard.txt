And the moment that she left the room
the album started skipping
Goodbye to beauty, shared with the ones that you love
A shadow that has fallen over this town
A shadow that has fallen over this town

Attention, all of my worst critics
Who were once the best of friends.
You're all just crows on the power lines
(Into romantic speculations)
(Into romantic speculations)

Sightings of shape shifting
Dissolved into the darkness
A final opinion is of less value
Than an appreciation of
And Tolerance for obscurity.

Theatrics, all made up of pianos all playing at once through the dust.
I found it difficult in my excitement to keep from floating off
to keep from floating off
(into romantic speculation)
(into romantic speculation)

Sightings of shape shifting
Dissolved into the darkness
A final opinion is of less value
Than an appreciation of
And Tolerance

(A shadow that has fallen over this town)
(A shadow that has fallen over this town)

I'll rest on nets made by spiders fed on drug dosed flies
the spider sings alone
the spider sings alone
he paced the room with hurried steps
and placed his hands upon his head
as if he were afraid
his thoughts were bursting from his brain

Sightings of shape shifting
Dissolved into the darkness
A final opinion is of less value
Than an appreciation of
And Tolerance

Sightings of shape shifting
Dissolved into the darkness
A final opinion is of less value
Than an appreciation of
And Tolerance for obscurity.

As if he were afraid.
