I'd like to take this time to detach my jaw,
And really take a look. I think that I'm tired.
Put away this old guitar and on my way
I'll hang my vocal cords up on the door.

If I could just do these things
(if I could do these things)
If I could maybe do these things
Each and every day wouldn't pass
The way that they so often do
That they so often do
Maybe just maybe
Life would be everything we wanted it to be.

I could even peel the skin right off my face
And blow a chance with the cartilage of my nose
Just to show you how to really move

I'll show you how to really move

If I could just do these things
If I could maybe do these things
Each and every day wouldn't pass
The way that they so often do
That they so often do
Maybe just maybe
Life would be everything we wanted it to be.

I'll show you how to really move
I'll show you how to really move

If I could just do these things
(if I could do these things)
If I could maybe do these things
Each and every day wouldn't pass
The way that they so often do
That they so often do
Maybe just maybe
Life would be everything we wanted it to be.
