The fields are near and they wont trust the air with secrets
I can't stop holding this treasure in my arms
all the water in the ocean could never turn
the swans legs from black to white

let them say. let them say. let them say what they please

you wont be leaving my arms ever. I promise you that.
even if you want me to let go honey
even if you want me to let go
you wont be leaving my arms ever. I promise you that.
even if you want me to let go honey
even if you say the things that make me want to lose you

we went on drinking, celebrating something
I looked at you and said that I'm forever yours
you looked at me and said oh the idea of being in love
the idea. the idea. of being forever yours.

you wont be leaving my arms ever. I promise you that
even if you want me to let go honey
even if you want me to let go
you wont be leaving my arms ever. I promise you that
even if you want me to let go honey
even if you say the things that make me want to lose you

screaming from the inside of me, lonely and pleading phantasm
we only get what we see; gazing so desperately
between the things that we fear; gazing so desperately
alive with illusions; were watching segregating illusions
between the things that we see and the things that we fear
no no it wont make this easier.

you wont be leaving my arms ever. I promise you that
even if you want me to let go honey
even if you want me to let go
you wont be leaving my arms ever. I promise you that
even if you want me to let go honey
even if you say the things that make me want to lose you

even if you want me to let go honey...
