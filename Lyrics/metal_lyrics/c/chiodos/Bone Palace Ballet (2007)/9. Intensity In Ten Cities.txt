I'm not the one that you want, I'll only let you down
And I'm pretty sure that you've caught on.
And you can say that 'oh, I'm just feeling sorry for my...'

I think it's everytime I walk into a room
a silence so sudden that I seem to hear it
(smiles turn to frowns)
Contact saying that you are the rain on their parade

And how long could you hang onto a word?
Tell me, how long could you hand onto a word?

I'm not the one that you want, I'll only let you down
And I'm pretty sure that you've caught on.
And you can say that 'oh, I'm just feeling sorry for myself.'

Or maybe it's all eyes on him
in love with ego and intention
the eyes that are just begging me for more.
This is gone and I can see it
your head is full of words
full of words that don't mean anything

And how long could you hang onto a word?
Tell me, how long could you hand onto a word?

I'm not the one that you want, I'll only let you down
And I'm pretty sure that you've caught on.
And you can say that 'oh, I'm just feeling sorry for myself.'
