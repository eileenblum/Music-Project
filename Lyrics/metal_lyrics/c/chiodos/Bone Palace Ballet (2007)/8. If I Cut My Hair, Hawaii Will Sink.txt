you keep tugging on my shirt
just to pull me closer
one single step at a time
your skin against mine
I can just feel you under me
fit to be tight

fit to be tight
fit to be
fit to be tight

I feel weak
thrown in wide open spaces
we turn ourselves inside out
expose what were afraid to see
and I know what you're thinking
I told myself
you keep pulling
you keep pulling

now grown up petrified I think
no no you don't mean it
you simply say it
because you like the way that it sounds

I feel weak
grown in wide open spaces
we turn ourselves inside out
expose what were afraid to see
and I know what you're thinking

I feel weak
and I give up
and I give up
tell me why
go on and
and tell me
tell me
tell me why
tell me
tell me
I feel weak
