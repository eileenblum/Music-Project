I dropped all of my lovers
I stood up and screamed 'I'm in love!'

You gave it to me through the eyes, hatred.
Centuries deep and true.
I was wrong, graceless, and sick.
All of the things that I had learned had been wasted.

There was no living creature as foul as I,
And all of my poems were false.
I could feel my soul, dropping down through the mattress.
I had to leap up before it hit the floor.
And I'm so alone.

Illumination held out in front of my reaching arms.
The darker things get the better I see.
I'm so alone and so are you,
We all live and die that way.

You gave it to me through the eyes, hatred.
Centuries deep and true.
I was wrong, graceless, and sick.
All of the things that I had learned had been wasted.

There was no living creature as foul as I,
And all of my poems were false.
There was no living creature as foul as I,
I could feel my soul, dropping down.
I could feel my soul, dropping down.
