My eyes are glistered with the ghost of my past
The memories that we once had

Now that you've turned the world against me
I'm only trying to win them back

With my eyes sewn shut
To shut down and bathe in these words about me
And now you're standing alone with your eyes to the sun
Standing alone with your eyes to the sun
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
Worlds are ruined this way
And we've all been there time and time again.

Before the battle it always seemed so still
And I will see you someday again in the clouds
And I will see you someday again in the clouds

All the world's a stage
And all the world's a stage

With my eyes sewn shut
To shut down and bathe in these words about me
And now you're standing alone with your eyes to the sun
Standing alone with your eyes to the sun
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
Worlds are ruined this way
And we've all been there time and time again

My eyes are glistered with the ghost of my past
And what we once had

And all the world's a stage
I existed because I dreamed and well, I dream no more
I've given up on the entire human race

[Spoken:]
Empty is the sky before the sun wakes up
Empty is the eyes of animals in cages
Empty are the faces of women in mourning
When everything has been taken from them
Me? Don't ask me about empty
