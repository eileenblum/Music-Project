We all know, we all know by now,
that you're the only thing you talk about.

So forgive me for bragging out loud.
I tried to reason with myself.
Tell me what could I have done?

Maybe I should have asked you to stay
like I was gone, then just get up and hand it away.
Well babe, like they say about some things,
well I guess something never changed.

We all know, we all know by now
that you're the only thing you talk about.
We all know, we all know by now
that things won't work out, no.
You've got nothing to say.

You've got nothing,
you've got nothing to say.

Some day I hope you see
the consequences of your actions.
I know that I can do so much more without you.
Well babe, like they say about some things,
well I guess something never changed.

We all know, we all know by now
that you're the only thing you talk about.
We all know, we all know by now
that things won't work out, no,
I never really had a doubt
that things would end up to be this way.
And I never meant to make them seem that way.

You've got nothing to say.
You've got nothing to say.
You've got nothing to say.
You've got nothing to say.
You've got nothing.

I knew as soon as I'd left,
that you'd go and fuck someone else, you whore.

You've got nothing to say.
We all know, we all know by now
that you're the only thing you talk about.
We all know, we all know by now
that things won't work out, no,
I never really had a doubt
that things would end up to be this way.
And I never meant to make them seem that way.

You've got nothing to say.
You've got nothing to say.
You've got nothing to say.
You've got nothing.
