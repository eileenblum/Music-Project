(Keep me warm!)
It existed and come to we're meant together
Nothing could keep you warmer
What I wanna know is why your jabbing these feelings
Make me lose control
So lets take out the goblet
Point this straight ahead
We'll hang them in admit they're wrong
The girls giving jealousy
This is killing me
(this is killing me)
For worth your twelve inch
Show that you still care
(stop this flame thrower)
(stop this flame thrower)
Show that you feel
Confusing thoughts with ceiling tiles
Crashing fists of both grown solid
Confusing thoughts with ceiling tiles
Classic fists applaud
Ceiling tiles from solid walls
It existed and come to we're meant together
Nothing could keep you warmer
What I wanna know is why your jabbing these feelings
Make me lose control
So lets take out the goblet
Point this straight ahead
We'll hang them in admit they're wrong
The girls giving jealousy
This is killing me
(this is killing me)
For wroth your twelve inch
Show that you still care
(stop this flame thrower)
(stop this flame thrower)
Show that you feel
This is spending me
This is eating me alive
The knife hits the ground
A corpse is laying cold
The ending hurts
(the ending hurts)
In stained water
(the end)
