I've resolved upon this course, which has no need of you
Denying this day, didn't stop it from coming
Promise me, that you won't be consumed when you realize
We're screaming at the same moon

Shredded by state lines
Press my face up against the glass
With both eyelids shut and baby, this won't get any easier

Don't let this die, we may never fall in love again
It's hard but worth the wait when it's over

Now open up wide, fist first down your throat
Where no beauty lies, and rip out what should've been mine

Comfort always made the rescue, we always hoped 'for the best'
I'll burn this with torches, and drown in my consideration
