His spring of love, resembles the uncertain glory of an April day
The sun beating against my neck, horizons still stuck in my mind

To the girl that can't forgive me

Take these misunderstandings, return them back where they came from
Take these misunderstandings, it's hard enough to live life as it is

Binded
Hooked on an anchor

All nereids beware, all nereids beware

This spring of love, resembles the uncertain glory of an April day
A shipwreck
Left stranded
A castaway

Coast to coast the high seas echo "it's not you it's me"
If the wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs

(I could drive the boat... if the wind... were down)

Take these misunderstandings, return them back where they came from
Take these misunderstandings, it's hard enough to live life as it is

A corpse lies lifeless, where X marks the spot, at the bottom of the ocean floor
Where X marks the spot
Where X marks the spot

All nereids beware, all nereids beware
The finest treasures are buried under waves

A shipwreck
Left stranded
A castaway
