Forget I even called
Why even try to end things on a good note
I should've left with no reply
These next few days you're only a stranger
Our demise awoke the same time that I did

Pull the hair from my scalp
Peek through bloody holes
Witness thoughts I can't describe

From behind, whisper in your ear, 'stop screaming'
Taste my knife
Tears scatter red, you're still bleeding

Tend to me tonight

May it be the last of our alliance
