I've been hiding in this bed for weeks from this
Throats raw from screaming and I haven't said a word
The sky is calling, and the stars they point to this
To a chair we se your breath in the air, but only for a little while
Your cold pale skin and tainted purple lips
Let me embrace you with this kiss
And together we'll float like angels
Together... together we will float, like, angels
Higher than the heavens the clouds part ways
'Promise me to never look down!' and we'll stay like this forever
If your stomach feels weak then my work here is done
To hide from our twisted ways, I've been hiding in this bed
Been hiding in this bed for weeks
