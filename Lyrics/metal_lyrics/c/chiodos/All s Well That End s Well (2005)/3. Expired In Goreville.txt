I'll stop
Stabbing
When you stop
Screaming

It's dropping to the terrain at my feet
Palm trees are my only company
On this beach
Star crossed lovers obsess
Alluring dreams of touching starry skies
Ill love you until my last breathe
Each speck of sand fills in each footstep along the shore
As every tide rolls in; every one takes its toll
The salt in this water is nauseating
Keeping me trapped and running in circles
On this beach star crossed lovers obsess
Alluring dreams of touching starry skies
A quick glance over my shoulder reveals a number only seen in the movies
Chardes of glass, and a decayed piece of parchment half buried that reads:
'You cured me of my foolish obsession with love'
I'll love you until my last breath takes you from me
