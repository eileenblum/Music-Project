This happiness surpasses me.
Just running up and down my spine
Whenever I'm around you
My smile beings to shine.

The love I feel for you
is quite hard for anyone to find.
You're the one that I want to
wake up next to,
and just give us
Your beautiful blue eyes.

Please never, ever leave me.
Just stay right here,
Always by my side.

Your beauty radiates
just like the sun.
When I'm around you,
I tend to lose my breath.
There's no doubt
that you're the one.
Your great smile makes me feel alive.
Your flawless personality,
combined with your godly looks,
makes you more than perfect.

Please never, ever leave me.
Just stay right here,
Always by my side.

Please never, ever leave me.
Just stay right here,
Always by my side.
