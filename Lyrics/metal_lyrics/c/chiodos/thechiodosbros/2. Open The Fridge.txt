These tears run down my face tasting of salt
As feel my heart begin to break
Your love for me comes to a screeching halt
The service that your preaching makes me quake

Please I'm begging you to woo me
Falling in love
Please I'm begging you to make me suffer
Falling in love with you

I could spend forever with you
But that's the last thing that would make you happy
You want to spend forever alone
Or at least I hope you do

Please I'm begging you to woo me
Falling in love
Please I'm begging you to make me suffer
Falling in love with you

Just stay oh so far away from me
Keep your distance and stay alone forever
Just stay oh so far away from me
Keep your distance and stay alone forever
