Bite my tongue, right now the perfect time
Do anything to make her happy
Even if it means my being miserable
As long as she's loving life

I will be able to sleep at night
With a smile upon her face
I will be able to sleep at night
With a smile upon her face

Thought of a smile not being there
My inner feelings would be shattered
A piece of glass puncturing my heart
I'm bleeding from the inside

I will be able to sleep at night
With a smile upon her face
I will be able to sleep at night
With a smile upon her face

As long as she's perfectly fine
I hope she's perfectly fine
And some day she will be mine

I will be able to sleep at night
With a smile upon her face

As long as she's perfectly fine
I hope she's perfectly fine
And some day she will be mine
