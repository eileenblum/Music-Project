Look at those fears we share,
It seems to be nothing,
But we had a heart attack,
And I find myself making a puddle, oh no.
Your immaculate eyes connecting with mine
Was enough to make me crave my feelings to intertwine.

But you're too beautiful,
I can never compare with your picture perfect smile,
And flowing brown hair.
No one will be able to give you what you deserve.
(No one will be)

In the meantime, I sit around,
Thinking of you, dreaming of your touch,
And what it must be like
Stuck in my dreams, night and day,
I'm not even working at all.
Maybe I'll have the gall to walk up and say

You're too beautiful,
I can never compare with your picture perfect smile,
And flowing brown hair.
No one will be able to give you what you deserve.
(No one will be)

Why can't you get out of my dreams,
And into my life?
Why can't you get out of my dreams,
And into my life?
And everything we'd go through,
I'll be right by your side.
