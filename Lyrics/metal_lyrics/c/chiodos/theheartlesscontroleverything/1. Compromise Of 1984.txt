Came to compromise for all of me that has withered up and,
Faded like a fallen sunset.
Came to compromise and let this music paint our silence,
Like a fallen sunset.

And it's each beat pounding in my head.
This too familiar sound of failure
This song I can't get out of my head.
This too familiar sound repeating
Every note making up for words unsaid.
This too familiar sound
We've all sang this same hymn of infatuation.

We're making up for each bitter tongue,
Letting the world know in different ways.
Taking our feelings we can't express,
And showcasing them as if, as if they really mattered.

Here we go
Save me (Save me)

These strings are the only ones connected to my heart,
That no one can play with.
These are the only strings connected to my heart,
That no one can play with.
We're letting the world know

We're making up for each bitter tongue,
We both are letting the world know in different ways.
Taking our feelings we can't express,
And showcasing them as if, as if they really mattered.
