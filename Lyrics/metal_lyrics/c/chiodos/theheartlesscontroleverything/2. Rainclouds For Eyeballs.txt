It's safe to come out now,
No one is around,
This sugar coated donut lost its flavor long ago.
And I just don't know what to think,
When your disguise begins to show.
Now I know,
I always think to slow.

'Cause I never
Thought I would miss
Our sweet forever
Of passion violence
But I can't forget
The wretched torment
It's on its noose
And hung beneath my ribs

You're hung beneath my ribs...

Can't you see,
Can't you see,
Why can't you see?

My heart is branded,
It's all your fault.
You're hanging from my ribs,
And I hope you fall.
My heart is branded,
It's all your fault.
You're hanging from my ribs,
And I hope you fall...

'Cause I never
Thought I would miss
Our sweet forever
Of passion violence
But I can't forget
The wretched torment
It's on its noose
And hung beneath my ribs
