Last night your taste was beautiful
but my tongue doesn't know the truth
cause when it's drown in poison chemicals I see the better side of you
our promise was that we would save ourselves before our minds lost all control
but then our clothes hit the floor
now today you called and told me that it only hurts more

the phone's been off the hook for three hours now
my heart beats fast as the pulse of the tone
blocking conversation I'm hiding from your lies
lies that make you take back what's been said
I'm so angry it's hard to even talk anymore
with words as my weapons
I would say to you
now it's over

no shields can prevent these sharp syllables
I tell myself you'll never let go (you will never let this go)
still I'm the one who is blamed for this

lies depicted a remainder of trust
something deeper than a story

will you hold my eyelids open as I paste your blood on my pupils
then teach me to see with my ears
so I'll find out what true beauty really is

why can't I take back all the time that I wasted on you
and use on friends that won't bring me down
because everytime it seems the same way
and I know that they're there for me and they hate to see I'm ruined
so give me one good reason why you're still in love

I see you standing all alone
and if that one good reason is not enough
I want to be let go
just give me on good reason why you're still in love
