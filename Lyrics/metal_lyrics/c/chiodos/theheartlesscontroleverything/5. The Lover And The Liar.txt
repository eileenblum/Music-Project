[Whispers if you play backwards:]
How does it feel to know that you've taken someone's smile

We're on a search to find the feeling for which we all die
It appeared the answer to the problem
And a reason to smile

Two lost hearts and one caught in the middle
They came together and the other fell apart
It appeared the answer to the problem
I have no reason to smile

The connection... eyes meeting
Lips touching... screaming "Sweet sayonara"
And the other gracious sounds of Claudio
Sweat, spit, and tears exchanged alike
Mistakes made and forgiveness but the eyes still met
And the lover still loved and the liar still lied

Then came the downfall to one's heaven stuck in a world where nothing is beautiful
The nail was in the coffin...it hadnât been buried yet
Nothing but an open casket for him to kneel and weep
(A lover and liar the pain finally stopping for him to try and take his own life)
(And the blood of a body that was once so pure)

It's come together, it's time to change what the script reads
There's no such thing as happy endings
This masterpiece is finally ending slowly
Microphone psychiatry...good-bye for good

It's come together, it's time to change what the script reads
There's no such thing as happy endings
This masterpiece is finally ending slowly
Microphone psychiatry...

Two lost hearts and one caught in the middle
They came together and the other fell apart
It appeared the answer to the problem
I have no reason to smile

Cravings fulfilled hate on oneself...good-bye for good.
