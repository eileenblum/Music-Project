This melody never seemed quite right
Nothing you could ever sing along to
Eerie rhythms creeping through doors

If I close my eyes
Count to ten you will never see me
You won't ever see me
You won't ever see me

Hide in sanction
I'll show you how I bury myself tonight
This fear runs through my veins

Run run as fast as you can
Never look behind and never turn around
Run run till I find who I am
Never look behind and never turn around

Run run as fast as you can
Never look behind and never turn around
Run till I find who I am
Never look behind and never turn around

As I fall face down
I was young and now I still remember, still remember
Everything and all the pain you caused
But now I can't resist these evil thoughts
I still remember
I still remember everything
All the pain you caused
I'm living in this misery resisting evil thoughts
I still remember everything
All the pain you caused
I'm living in this misery resisting evil thoughts

This is what's been haunting me
Beaten tossed around blatantly
I scream out loud
I scream out loud
I can't scream any louder
