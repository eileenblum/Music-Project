Why don't you use your knives,
Continue to stick them in my face
Leave them to be our memories
That I plan to lose
Just like I lost you

I guess I'll just cope with what I can't control
After all it means the best for the both of us

At night when you hear me breathing
Under the covers is where you'll find me
Trying to escape your endless reign of terror
Stale sweat running all over my body
I'm drowning in my dreams
I'm drowning in my dreams
I can't wake now
I'll sleep forever
I can't wake now

What if tomorrow never comes
How will I know you loved me?
I just need something to live for
So I'll never die again.
What if tomorrow never comes
How will I know you loved me?
I just need something to live for
So I'll never die again. Again.
