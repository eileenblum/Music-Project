Let's let the memories drift away
Let's let the memories drift away

I'm taking down these pictures of you on my wall
these scars still bleed and I'm letting them drip on our past
I'm torn between decision and dead reckoning
if I'm not fair then tell me, why do you still care?

"Get out the car and walk away"
I said with dried tears in my eyes hoping you'd ignore my words
you slammed the door and spun around as fast as you could
to get away from all this mess

So take this night
(So take this night)
and search for your answers
I know you'll find what's right and you'll still put me through hell

I'm taking down these pictures of you on my wall
these scars still bleed and I'm letting them drip on our past
I'm torn between decision and dead reckoning
if I'm not fair then tell me, why do you still care?

These scars run deep and they cover me
like an open wound without breathing room
I can't heal like this but it's you I miss
this war won't end

These words are coming out slowly and I mean it when I say I need you
this war won't end
you keep your heart where I can barely reach it and yet it's right in front of me
this war won't end
it'd be better off for the both of us if we'd took these truths and walk away
this war won't end

I'm taking down these pictures of you on my wall
these scars still bleed and I'm letting them drip on our past
I'm torn between decision and dead reckoning
if I'm not fair then tell me, why do you still care?
