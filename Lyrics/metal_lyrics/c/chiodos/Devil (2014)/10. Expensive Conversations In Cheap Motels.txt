I fucking hate you

Let it go right through you
Don't be afraid of the pain that you feel
The resistance is what controls you
Fear covered in sex appeal

(Getting to know you)
I know it's wrong where we're standing
It's better we're by her
(Guilty, guilty)
I can't forget how we spoke
You weren't even listening

Tell me where your love is now
You're too ugly to be narcissistic

I fucking hate you
I'll feel alive when I watch you die
I want to break you
Cutting out my heart till there's nothing inside
Tell me where your love is now
Tell me where your love is

Don't be afraid,
I love your touch in a hateful kind of way
Come on and get a little closer
Let me save your last grin on your face

Tell me where your friends are now
You're disgusting, don't be optimistic

I fucking hate you
I'll feel alive when I watch you die
I want to break you
Cutting out my heart till there's nothing inside
Tell me where your love is now
Tell me where your love is

It's not for real,
I'll stop when it shows up
Tell me I am God
[x2]

(Getting to know you)
I know it's wrong where we're standing
It's better we're by her
(Guilty, guilty)
I can't forget how we spoke
You weren't even listening

Tell me where your love is now
Tell me where your love is

I fucking hate you
I hate you
I hate you
Die!
