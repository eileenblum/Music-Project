[Bonus Track]From the moment I was born I knew I was different
Bounded by the proudness of my sight
She's buildings in my eyes
All of the things that we wanted but thought we could never have
Like I traded it in for a heart, for a song, for a better life
For a beer, for a girl, for a sharper knife

I wish the weight of the world was enough to drown out the thoughts of you

I tell myself this can't be love
Cause I don't even know who I am
(I'm more afraid of letting you go)
I tell myself there's more to know
This can't be how it all ends
(I'm more afraid of letting you go)

Kicked down, coming out of the mud
You're selfish and you won't change
And I'm sorry, but you've got to know
Now that you can have me
Of course you want me, no

I wish the weight of the world was enough to drown out the thoughts of you

I tell myself this can't be love
Cause I don't even know who I am
(I'm more afraid of letting you go)
I tell myself there's more to know
This can't be how it all ends
(I'm more afraid of letting you go)
