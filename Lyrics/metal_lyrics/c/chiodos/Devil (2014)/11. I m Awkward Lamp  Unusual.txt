I wake up (wake up), feel stranded, despite entering my covers
And a ghost from my past standing over my bed
I'm leaving (get out), can't take it, so I'm going forward to face it
But in case your only night on my way out of the door

The life that I live is taking all that I have
(Find your way home)
The only way out is to show that I can't
I can't live other people's dreams

[Chorus:]
Take me away (Rip me open again)
I won't be your hope for tomorrow
Take me away (I can't change who I am)
I won't be your hope for tomorrow

Take it (pressure), the pressure
They say it's how you make damage
But I don't see anything around here because
Can't think straight (my God!), so angry
So I keep on running until I find the place that I can call my own

The life that I live is taking all that I have
(Find your way home)
The only way out is to show that I can't
I can't live other people's dreams

[Chorus:]
Take me away (Rip me open again)
I won't be your hope for tomorrow
Take me away (I can't change who I am)
I won't be your, I won't be your hope

Stand out against the sick pool
Having fun, the wounds are shun
The pressure's on, no way to run x2
But you will hate

[Chorus:]
Take me away (Rip me open again)
I won't be your hope for tomorrow
Take me away (I can't change who I am)
I won't be your, I won't be your hope
