From your knees, youâve lost all direction; So afraid of rejection.
Lost, little toys in forgotten parks.
Do I believe in us; do I believe in lust?
Am I just desperate for a pick-me-up?
Maybe, I got a little lost while searching for my faith, stuck to your cross. 

You set fire to everything around; worry yourself into the ground.
You take all you can and leave the part begging for more,
Do I believe in love; do I believe in heaven?
(At the sound of church bells, they come running)
All my clocks stuck on eleven; afraid of the hymn, my knees, I might get nothing

Devil, donât ever let me go.
Iâve been looking for a tornado; chaos is something Iâve been missing. [x2]

You start wars everywhere you go.
You take shots at everyone you know, and no one can help you âcause you refuse to receive it yourself.
Do I believe in love; do I believe in heaven?
(At the sound of wolf cries, they come running)
All my clocks stuck on eleven, I put too much of my faith in nothing.

Devil, donât ever let me go.
Iâve been looking for a tornado; chaos is something Iâve been missing. [x2]

This is the sound of your savior running in need of anything to save you from nothing. 
Devil, youâre evil

Devil, donât ever let me go.
Iâve been looking for a tornado; chaos is something Iâve been missing. [x2]
