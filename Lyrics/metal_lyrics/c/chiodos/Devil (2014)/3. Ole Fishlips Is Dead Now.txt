Away with the fishes floating like the stars across the sky.

This mirror is feeding me lies. I looked so beautiful but just as desperate.
A victim with a plague with rage reaching to the sky.
I'm chewing on my teeth and staring into a black hole. Let go of your demons

I looked so beautiful but just as desperate
A victim with a plague of rage reaching to the sky
I'm chewing on my teeth and staring into a black hole

She's in love, she's in love, she's in love with herself. 
And I never should have trusted someone else with my insides.
Goodbye never feels complete, there's always one word missing.

I want to forget you. 
You've broken everything I love, took all my light and turned it into dusk. 
I regret all I gave you. 
You've broken everything I love and I can't wait to be myself again.

I feel the separation, I feel it deep inside my bones.
I know you're sharing beds with strangers in sharp corners.
Goodbye never feels complete, there's always one word missing.

I want to forget you. 
You've broken everything I love, took all my light and turned it into dusk. 
I regret all I gave you. 
You've broken everything I love and I can't wait to be myself again.

Manipulate, play with my insides.
Twist around and...
Take what you want, Take what you want from me.

This is love. This is love.

I want to forget you. 
You've broken everything I love, took all my light and turned it into dusk.
I regret all I gave you. 
You've broken everything I love and I can't wait to be myself again.

This is love.
This is love.
This is love.
This is love.
