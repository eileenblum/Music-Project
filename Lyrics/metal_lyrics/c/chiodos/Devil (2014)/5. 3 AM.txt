I hear the sound of the clock and the drip of running water I never thought it would be like this
It's 3 AM and I can't sleep

I had it all planned out find a girl and get married, do things that make your dreams.
What more could you need? I knew that I could win a room because I've always had it, but love is a scary thing.
It's what they never taught and I don't know how its gotten me this far

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless, but I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM.

I wish I would of loved you instead of being selfish and being so obsessed with my dreams
Oh look at me I'm surrounded by the lonely
I thought I could win you back because I've always had it but love is a tricky thing
It's what they never taught, that you when lose what you love, you lose a piece of your heart

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless, but I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM.

Everyday I still learn from the mistakes that I've made
who knew that things would be this way
I'm here because I wouldn't change
I've fallen on my face, but watch me get up again!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
Now everything else is meaningless
So I'm laying in bed sick with regret at 3 AM.
