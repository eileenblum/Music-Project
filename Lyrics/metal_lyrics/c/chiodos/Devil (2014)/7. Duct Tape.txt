I see the world through these shame color glasses.
So don't act like I'm out here searching for dramatics.
When it follows you, you can't seem to escape
When all you liars it seems like all you do is hate.

Yeah that drama ship, yeah it follows me
It ruins every relationship I could ever see.

Yet you won't stop shaking and all you do is fake it.
It's like you bite it, then you fight it, then deny it.
But I was born this way and I can never change.
I hope I scare you to death and leave you shaking in your grave.

Do you want to be born again?
I can chase away those demons.
Hand in hand, you could tell me all your secrets.
I know what you want, but you won't let it go.
I know what you want, but you have to follow.
If you want to know who you are just come with me into the dark.
Come with me into the dark.

I heard that you shake when you think of me.
I'm going to take you to the places that you've never seen.
Running from the things your minds won't let you explain, explain.
Just between you and me, yeah we got places to be.
Dressed up so scary like it's Halloween.

Yet you won't stop shaking and all you do is fake it.
It's like you bite it, then you fight it, then deny it.
But I was born this way and I can never change.
I hope I scare you to death and leave you shaking in your grave.

Do you want to be born again?
I can chase away those demons.
Hand in hand, you could tell me all your secrets.
I know what you want, but you won't let it go.
I know what you want, but you have to follow.
If you want to know who you are just come with me into the dark.
Come with me into the dark.

I can do anything I want, and I do.
In you, you've got your insecurities and I've got mine.
But I got my duct tape.

Do you want to be born again?
I can chase away those demons.
Hand in hand, you could tell me all your secrets.
I know what you want, but you won't let it go.
I know what you want, but you have to follow.
If you want to know who you are just come with me into the dark.
Come with me into the dark.
Come with me into the..
