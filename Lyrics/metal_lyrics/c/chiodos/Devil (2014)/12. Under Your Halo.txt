Lonely bird, sing me your song
I'll stay awake until I see the sunrise
I hear your voice and I know you're alright
I can't wait to feel each inch of you tonight

And all I can do now
It's way to ease the ground

I feel invincible, so chemical around you
Flying high, I'm so alive beside you
All the stars above are under your halo
I'll take every breath and never lie about you
Everything, fuck the world without you
Pull me higher up, just like an angel
I'm under your halo

Lonely bird, lend me your ear
I should have never let my eyes blink that night
Drawn that on the small of your back
Kissed your forehead cause I didn't want to wake you for goodbye

And all I can do now
It's way to ease the ground

I feel invincible, so chemical around you
Flying high, I'm so alive beside you
All the stars above are under your halo
I'll take every breath and never lie about you
Everything, fuck the world without you
Pull me higher up, just like an angel

Halo, halo [x2]
Holding up the stars, holding up the stars with your halo, halo
Lighting up my skies, lighting up my skies with your halo

I feel invincible, so chemical around you
Flying high, I'm so alive beside you
All the stars above are under your halo
I'll take every breath and never lie about you
Everything, fuck the world without you
Pull me higher up, just like an angel
Just like an angel, I'm under your halo
