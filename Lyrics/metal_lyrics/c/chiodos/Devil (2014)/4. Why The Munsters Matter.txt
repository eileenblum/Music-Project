Living lonely in secrets
I raise my hand and I question the normal.
Follow my heart and can't trust my head.
Won't do what you tell me, I'm not good with order.

Busy streets feel like islands, and I'm yelling from the shore.
Isolation hits and all you hear were voices.

Singing the songs in my head.
I beg them to tell me, I just want to know.
What the hell are we here for?

Tell me, do I offend you?
'Cause I don't want to fit into your world,
Into your heart.
I hope I scare you and I...

I've tried that, I've tried that before.
I can't go on as something I am not.

You don't have to pretend when you're alone.
I'm not lost, I'm still figuring out what to do when these voices.

Are singing their songs in my head.
I can't fight the darkness, I just let it show.
What the hell are we here for?

Tell me, do I offend you?
'Cause I don't want to fit into your world,
Into your heart.
I hope I scare you and I...

I've tried that, I've tried that before.
I can't go on as something I am not.

We won't, give up.
Break you down!
We won't, hear you.
Break you down!
We won't, give up.
Break you down!
(You) we won't, give up
Like everyone else.

Tell me, do I offend you?
'Cause I don't want to fit into your world,
Into your heart.
I hope I scare you and I...

I've tried that, I've tried that before.
I can't go on as something I am not.
