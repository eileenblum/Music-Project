Each time I wake up,
I rush to my knees and beg to stop
I canât breathe
I canât think
Will I ever make this right?

Stop and check your pulse
With truth and love all tied up
I canât see
I canât be
Will I ever make this?

I believed you when you called me the villain
Like the devil I was cast out and defined by sin
I believed I could be some kind of hero but I got lost
And on my way to heaven
I was dragged through hell

âfor dust you are and to dust you will returnâ
Jealousyâs something Iâve been missing
Iâm afraid my faithâs been replaced
Iâm afraid Iâve fallen from grace
All of my love has turned to hate
Can I ever make this right?

I believed you when you called me the villain
Like the devil I was cast out and defined by sin
I believed I could be some kind of hero but I got lost
And on my way to heaven
I was dragged through hell

Iâve been laying low, but never hiding
The longer Iâm down here
The more you will doubt, my dear

I believed you when you called me the villain
Like the devil I was cast out and defined by sin
I believed I could be some kind of hero but I got lost
And on my way to heaven
I was dragged through hell
