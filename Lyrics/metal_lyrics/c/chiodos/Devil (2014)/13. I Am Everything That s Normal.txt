As the sun blooms, our lips are tied in knots
I knew this day would come
I finally know just who I am
She said, "My God I started getting sleep again,
I don't think I want to learn how to feel again.
I've been searching myself for so long, so long."
And in these moments truth is found out
It's time to show you who I am

Show them that I'm more than enough
Just look at all the work I've done
You can tell me when it's over
It's never over

Look at us now, we're right back where we left off
It's our time to really do things right

She said doctor, doctor, please oh won't you help me?
See I've been having trouble helping out myself
And I really think I'm meant for something better
Tell me why is it called love if it hurts like hell?

You learn so much when you're out of your own way
Now nothing can, no nothing can touch me

I will be unstoppable
Singing all of the things I never thought I would sing
You showed me life was beautiful
Help me reach all my dreams
You showed me how to be free

Tell me lover, lover, come get a little closer
Cause you're all I have in this freaking world
And there's nothing, love, that we can't do together
Just stick with me and I promise you'll get what you deserve

You learn so much when you're out of your own way
Now nothing can, no nothing can touch me

I will be unstoppable
Singing all of the things I never thought I would sing
You showed me life was beautiful
Help me reach all my dreams
You showed me how to be

Unstoppable
Singing all of the things I never thought I would sing
You showed me life was beautiful
Help me reach all my dreams
You showed me how to be free

And I swear, I'm different now
From all the other say, other day
Don't you disappear, I need you
I need you here

I will be unstoppable
I will see all of the things that I never thought that I would ever see
And you showed me, you showed me that love was beautiful
You helped me with all of my dreams
Because of you, I swear I'm different now

I swear I'm different now [x3]
