Light came through a crack in the wall.
That red sun slowly rose.
At the break of dawn they came for us.
For a while we were safe and sound.
They came like thieves and robbed our town,
Of all the life,
Of everything we knew.
The living versus the dead.
Pray to your god.
Hell is on its way.
Hell was rolling in like a rancid fog,
And the world that we knew was raining blood.
Here we are, we knew the day would come.
Those who slay together, stay together in the end.
Crimson irises, the army of the infected.
They smelled our scent, sensed our fear.
They knew where we were.
The artist of the night,
They're painting the town red with blood.
They came through the door like a flood,
Like a flood.
A force too strong to handle.
We were attacked like a candle
Surrounded by demons that don't want the light.
They darkened our ability to see through the night.
Come through hell or high water.
We'll never leave one another alone.
This plague has taken control of us.
Come through hell or high water.
We die only to be born into a monstrosity.
Light came through the crack in the wall.
That red sun slowly fell down
And we devoured all that we could.
Oh yes we did.
We immersed ourselves in all the blood.
Biting each and everyone.
The army of the infected.
We are the infected.
We are the infected.
Here we are, we knew this day would come.
Those who slay together, stay together.
Here we are, we knew this day would come.
Those who slay together, stay together in the end.
