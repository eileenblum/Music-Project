We the people are gathering to say,
That here this day we're taking,
Taking what's rightfully ours.

This war will tear apart the sky,
Letting through the light.
And we will survive

You are the ruler of lies.
I see it in your eyes.
They're the window to your soul.
And we all know
This is our last chance to overthrow
The king and all his men,
So we can see the light again.

This war will tear apart the sky,
Letting through the light.
And we will survive, and we'll sing.
Marching onward, we're singing for our freedom.

Oh, what gave you the power to take the love from the woman?
Oh, what gave you the power to take the laughter from the children?
You can't blame them.
They're just doing what they think is right.
You can't blame them.
They're just doing what they think is right.

This has become impossible, impossible.
This has become impossible, impossible, impossible...

This war will tear apart the sky.
Letting through the light.
And we will survive, and we'll sing.
Marching onward, we're singing for our freedom.
