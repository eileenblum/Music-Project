I thought I knew you, thought you cared.
It was fooling to think that you were there.
Oh the fire was burning me up while your infamy was bringing me down.
And you were never there, you were never there.
I gave it all to you.
Everything I had and then you took my soul.
You took my soul away.
I gave it all to you.
Everything I had and then you took my soul away.
You took my soul away.
I'm not much of drinker but you poured me a glass,
Filling it up with your lies.
How I drank it fast...down.
Down it went.
Intoxicated with the lies you told me.
But now I see you.
You thought that I was blind.
Thought that I was blind.
But surely I can see and you will burn for this.
You'll burn for this. you'll burn for this.
You'll burn...
I gave it all to you.
Everything I had and then you took my soul.
You took my soul away.
I gave it all to you.
Everything I had and then you took my soul.
You took my soul away.
Oh, I am the weight of the world.
I'm crashing down upon you.
I am the fire, I am the flame.
I'll fight your fire.
I'll fight it with my fire.
I'll fight it with my fire...
Now you're trembling.
I gave it all to you.
Everything I had and then you took my soul.
You took my soul away.
I gave it all to you.
Everything I had and then you took my soul.
You took my soul away.
And I fight your fire with my fire,
And now you're trembling in your skin again.
And I fight your fire with my fire,
And now you're trembling in your skin.
In your skin.
