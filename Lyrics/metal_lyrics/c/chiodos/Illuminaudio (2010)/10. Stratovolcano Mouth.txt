Let it all out.
Let, let it all out,
Let, let it all out.
Let, let it go.
Let it all out.
Let, let it all out.
Let it all out.
Explode.
If mother earth was your body,
And the inner core was your fury,
Then the lava that flows in the chamber below is your adrenaline.
In a single second are a thousand thoughts.
But only one of them makes sense to you.
For so long you've held it in.
Everyday you're getting closer.
Explode into the air.
Explode into the air.
Are you alive?
Are you livid?
Yes are you afraid, are you afraid of what you hold inside?
In a single second are a thousand thoughts.
But only one of them makes sense to you.
For so long you've held it in.
Everyday you're getting closer.
Explode into the air.
Explode into the air.
For so long you've held it in.
Everyday you're getting closer.
Explode into the air.
Explode into the air.
You're breathing heavy.
You close your eyes.
Your hands are shaking, but you hold it in.
You try to stay calm, you try to hold it back.
But you can't seem to rest.
Yeah your heart is breaking right out of your chest. (explode)
And this is what it feels like to be a volcano.
Will it tear you up inside?
Let it all,
Let, let it all out. let it all out.
Just let it go.
Let it all out.
Let, let it all out. let it all out.
Explode out your throat.
For so long you've held it in,
Everyday you're getting closer.
Explode into the air.
Explode into the air.
For so long you've held it in,
Everyday you're getting closer.
Explode into the air.
Explode into the air.
Explode out your throat, explode out your throat.
