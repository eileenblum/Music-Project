When you know that you finally made it,
Can you make your way back,
Make your way back home?
I ventured into the dark to search
For a torch that would light the path ahead.
Over mountains so high, far and wide.
Searching for a place to rest my head.
On different roads I traveled,
But I remained the same.
Facing fears with no fear on my face.
Through all the roads I traveled,
I remained the same, facing my fear.
When you know that you finally made it,
Can you make your back,
Make your way back home?
You're on your own,
You're all alone out here.
Find your way back home...(find your way back home)
From the darkness I came,
In my hand was a torch that I found along the way.
And in the distance I saw a house
With a light that lit the porch.
I found a place to rest my head.
On different roads I traveled,
But I remained the same,
Facing fears with no fear on my face.
Through all the roads I traveled,
I remained the same.
Facing my fear,
When you know that you finally made it,
Can you make your back,
Make your way back home?
You're on your own,
You're all alone out here,
Find your way back home.
