I come from down in the catacombs of the opera house.
I hide my face while I long for her.
While I long for her lovely voice.
I long for her lovely voice.
Her lovely voice. her lovely voice.
She sings la da da da.
Through every crack the voice of an angel.
She doesn't know who I am, for I am a ghost.
Oh, I am a ghost to her.
She doesn't know who I am and she never will
Unless I can make her believe.
I've gotta make her believe in the darker side of me.
So I ask her...
Take my hand and follow me on this journey to the underworld.
How I want her to want me.
Her soaring voice carries into my mind.
I'm gonna take her away,
With me she will stay forever.
Don't deny me, understand that I am a monster.
I am a monster.
Won't you come with me now?
She doesn't know who I am,
For I am a ghost.
Oh, I am a ghost to her.
She doesn't know who I am, and she never will
Unless I can make her believe.
In me, in me, in me...
This face is deceitful when it smiles,
It doesn't show how desperate I am inside.
So come with me and we'll go,
Believe in me and I'll show you who I am.
So you can see the man behind the monster that I am.
Fighting my identity, I'll come take you away.
She doesn't know who I am,
For I am a ghost to her.
She doesn't know who I am and she never will.
No she never, never will believe. believe in me...
