I see her smile in her sleep.
I know that she's a dreamer.
Oh, I follow every move she makes.
It's been a long, long night.
Say you're mine, say you're mine.
Can I keep you tonight?
Tonight...and we dance around just like constellations.
You keep my body warm.
And we dance around just like constellations.
You're keeping me awake at night.
You make my body warm.
And I fall for her like snow from the sky.
Gracefully I land in her arms.
But I melted away like snow into the ground.
I told her I've gotta go, I've gotta go.
And we dance around just like constellations.
You keep my body warm.
And we dance around just like constellations.
You're keeping me awake at night.
You make my body warm.
It's been a long, long night.
You said you were mine.
I felt so bad but I had to go.
No she never wanted me to leave her behind.
No she never wanted me to leave her. (to leave her)
So long, so long,
And we dance around just like constellations.
We dance around just like constellations.
We dance around, we dance around,
We dance around, we dance around,
We dance around, we dance around,
You make my body warm,
You make my body warm.
