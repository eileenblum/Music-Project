I ventured into the dark to search for a torch.
And it would light the path ahead.
Over mountains so high, far and wide.
Searching for a place to rest my head.
On different roads I travel, but I remain the same.
Facing fear with no fear on my face.
Through all the roads I traveled,
I remained the same.
Facing my fear.
