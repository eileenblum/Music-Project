[feat. Vic Fuentes of Pierce the Veil]

I see the way that you act.
I'm not impressed by any of your lies.
I see the way you pretend to be so collect.
You're out of your mind.
You fell over the words that you dropped on the ground.
You're not fooling anybody,
And I'm not fooling around.
What goes around comes back around.
It's coming around for you.
So what made you think I wouldn't eventually come out of my skull?
Above you I hold your secrets.
They're hanging right above your head.
And you can bet that they'll believe.
And I believe that you are blackmailed and defeated.
So what good are your words anyway?
They're just a series of acting and plays.
What good are your words anyway?
Somber. dim lights. somber. dim lights.
Your facade, its not true.
It's not you, what a shame...
The way you are is why you feel the way you do.
Oh your fallacies.
I see the way that you act.
I'm not impressed by any of your lies.
I see the way you pretend to be so collect.
You're out of your mind.
You fell over the words that you dropped on the ground.
You're not fooling anybody,
An I'm not fooling around.
What goes around comes back around.
It's coming around for you.
So what made you think I wouldn't eventually come out of my skull? (your destiny)
Above all I hold the secrets.
They're hanging right above your head baby.
You are defeated. (this time its coming back around)
You are defeated. blackmailed and defeated.
Somber. dim lights. somber. dim lights.
Above you I hold your secrets.
They're hanging right above your head.
And you can bet that they'll believe.
I believe that you are blackmailed and defeated.
