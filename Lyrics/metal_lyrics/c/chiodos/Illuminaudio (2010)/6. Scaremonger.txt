Why are you so loud?
You've said it enough.
I'm standing right here, but can you see me?
All of my time, all of my soul.
I want to laugh again, and live again, and love.
My own way.
The lies engraved will never be erased.
The fear and pain embedded in my brain.
The words pushed out all that I am inside.
Manipulating all that I love.
All my desire you took as your own.
All of my sorrow.
Its not enough, not enough for your hunger.
Dismantle my being.
Oh, let me out. let me be free.
Dismember everything, making me doubt what I'm about.
Let me be free.
Can I just float away?
Can I just disappear?
All of my desire you took as your own.
All of my sorrow.
It's not enough, not enough for your hunger.
I melt down (melting down)
I'm melting down.
Finally there is no sound.
I'm standing in front of you but can you see me?
I'm melt down.
All my desire you took it as your own.
All of my sorrow.
It's not enough, not enough for your hunger.
It's not enough, not enough for your hunger.
