You yell my name, but will I be coming?
Should I be running?
Should I believe in you?
You yell my name, but will I be coming?
Should I be running?
Should I believe in you? (in you)
I've wasted all this time trying to stand by your side.
The wolves are coming out tonight,
For they have heard your cry,
And no one will believe you now.
There's no place to hide.
And now the wolves that you have cried,
Will eat you alive.
It's just you out in the field.
They're showing their teeth behind your back.
They're foaming at the mouth while they're waiting to attack.
Howling in your ears as they surround you.
They smell you, they feed off your cry.
I've wasted all this time trying to stand by your side.
The wolves are coming out tonight,
For they have heard your cry.
And no one will believe you now.
There's no place to hide.
And now the wolves that you have cried,
Will eat you alive.
Quite the alarmist that you are to have worried the people of the village.
Wipe that smile off your fucking face.
This is no laughing matter.
Under the moon, they mock your cry,
With their howling at night.
Will you be fast enough to lose them,
Or will they catch you?
Well you'll run for your life,
There's nowhere to hide.
And you'll flee...
Run for your life.
You are the victim, you are the pray.
You are the victim, you are the pray.
I've wasted all thus tune trying to stand by your side.
Wolves are coming out,
They have heard your cry.
No one will believe you.
No place to hide.
The wolves are coming out tonight to eat you alive.
