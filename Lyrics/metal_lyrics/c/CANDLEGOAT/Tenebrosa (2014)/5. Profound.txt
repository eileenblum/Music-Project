The dying man surrounding me
Hoping for forgiveness
Crawling in the frozen time
And lost in emptiness
Frozen leaf winds of asunder
I see your heart falling
From feelings that haunted
Innocent and wounded

All you see is death and suicidal dream
Beyond the clouds over the mountains
I know you will fall into the darkness
Through the fear that surround you
I know you run but there's darkness everywhere
Like the rotting trees that bending to the ground
All you can see is your own disease
Disharmony and rusty memory
You can stop the feeling that haunted
But you canât take it anymore

In morning dew
You portray me something cold
Something that I canât feel
From the ashes to the misery
