When you awaken in the dawn
Iâm that swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight
Iâm the soft star that shines at night

Iâm dead in grieve with all the tears
But in your heart I lived behind
Donât burdened with times of sorrow
Donât lengthen in with undue grief

Donât stand at my grave, donât stand and cry
Sad and lonely days have passed
Through the purple shadow that darkly trail
I was alone in my distress and desolation

I am here and I am cold
I am loss and Iâm sleepless
Iâm the song of the blackbird
Iâm a thousand winds that blow
I am dust and I am free
Iâm the longing journey
Now I am forever gone
With shadow that fade away
Lossâ¦

In life we never know how weak we are
