Whisper me a prayer
For my deepest wound
These woods it's too cold
When you're not here

A haunting past is gripping
Drown me by sorrow
As night falls into my arms
I through the eternal mourn

Howling, slow and ease, on my own, silence

How can I disguise
The feeling of a broken heart
I see no mercy
While you're drown in fear

Hunting, everlasting sorrow, all is dead, loneliness

No shadows shall remain
When I'm gone bitterly
All these grieves are rust
For you and I forever

I see nothing but these grieves
