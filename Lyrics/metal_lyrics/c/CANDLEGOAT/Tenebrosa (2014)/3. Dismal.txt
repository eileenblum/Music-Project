All seas frozen
When the skies turns black
I see nothing but fear
Frightening woods
Become my kingdom

All dreams are broken
And the curse passed me by
Youâll see no pain in this eyes
But fear I had now gone

All these blessings are burns
All these wound are grow
Everyone I love is gone
Everything is lost

All my will are burn
All my flames are lost
Everyone I love is gone
Everything is lost
