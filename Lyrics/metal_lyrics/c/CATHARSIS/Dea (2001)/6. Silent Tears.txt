Sky full of stars
Before my eyes
My inane look
It calmly took

My only friend
Is air land
Eternal world
Is grey and cold

My soul is tough
It's strong enough
I'm sure I'll win
For loss I'm mean

My story's frank
It's out of rank
Of usual tales
Where feeling fails

There's no end
In such a trend
Where love is hold
On sorrow fold

Remember me
And never flee
From my embrace
To other place

The tension edge
No one can gage
I can't forget...
My eyes are wet...

My sufferings're great
Of tears they're made
I will prevent
My torturement...
