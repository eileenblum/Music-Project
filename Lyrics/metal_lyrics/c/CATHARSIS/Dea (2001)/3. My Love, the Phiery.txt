I'm looking through fences of ancient graves -
The cemetery of dreams has got a new day
Living I'm or not - it doesn't matter for me:
You're left the life when the spring forced to flee:

Joy of that passing days you were alive's
Burning out my soul with the infernal fire
Feelings' waterfall doesn't let me breathe -
Heart's in the vices forging my breast

I want to cry but nobody's around
My part is dead, it's under the ground
I have no choice - just to leave for the light
Blood'll splash on the grass - and I'm all right:

The cemetery of dreams has got a new day
But for the following "again" nobody waits:
Bodies under the ground and two souls in the sky -
They're together in place where no one can die:

[Chorus:]
Cemetery of my dreams
Aura of my cloudy beams
Cemetery of my thoughts:
Thousands of my made-up plots

I'm looking through fences of ancient graves -
The cemetery of dreams has got a new day
Living I'm or not - it doesn't matter for me:
You're left the life when the spring forced to flee:

The cemetery of dreams by flowers is covered
The cemetery of dreams's so high in the clouds
Here and fatal dreams really come true
We'll stay here forever - we: me and you

[Chorus.]
