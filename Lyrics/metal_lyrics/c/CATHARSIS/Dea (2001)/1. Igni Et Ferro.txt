Far away from here
Being apart of me
Silently you fear
Mute eternity

Never ending flame
Burns me from inside
Whispering your name
Going to fight

[Bridge:]
I heal the wings
Of cruel stings
With rings and strings

[Chorus:]
Igni et ferro
Quia nominor leo
Come to me in trinity
Taming the infinity:
Fly faster than a wind
Swifter than a stream
To muffle my
Melancholy scream

We're separate worlds in one
Always striving for
Close to become
Pine for both no more

Dreaming of the end
Cherishing the hope
Carrying on to fend
Going to cope

[Bridge.]
[Chorus.]
