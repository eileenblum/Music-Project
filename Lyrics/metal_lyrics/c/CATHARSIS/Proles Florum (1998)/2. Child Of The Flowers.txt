She is child of another world
And people can't get her
Her face glows with happiness
Her eyes can't lie

Her smile is wonderful
Earth moving under my pins
And my life could be a tale
But doom is cruel

She has no flesh, she is a languid angel
Her soul is loveful
But not for me, for other people
And you must die

[Chorus:]
Window or gun
And you will want to die
She will not be your bride
Your life bites the dust
