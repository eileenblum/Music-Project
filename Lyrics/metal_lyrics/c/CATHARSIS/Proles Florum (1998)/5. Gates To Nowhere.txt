Gate to paradise is open
Come on, my boy, come on
You can forget her
With the help of height

With a kick about asphalt
You'll ultimately die
You will get into the illusion world
And pain is out

Suicide is the key for freedom
Key for the Gate of the other world
Where evil and lie don't dwell
Where life will be happiness

[Chorus:]
Suicide - light in the end of tunnel
Suicide - beginning of the new life
Suicide - reality of the being
Suicide - death is bringing luck
