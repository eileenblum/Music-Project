I stand on the top
Of the high mountain
Three roads of doom
Lies before me
And I must decide
Which road to choose
I'll change in one wink
Or I'll stay myself

The first way proclaims
Be strange to yourself
Your problems will die forever
And your future life
You'll see in bright lights
But you will be departed
On this mortal way

Your soul will starve
It is now, you change
Damage of brains
..... once for all
And so I stand
Of the high mountain
The horizon calls me
I stay on my way

The second way says
You must be oneself
Life is a Hell
But you will be a hero
Attack of the society
Will be corrupt
Your name is heretic
In this latter days

Yourself understood by
One or two friends
Heretic is enemy
For every man
And hero will be dead
In our time
Will die being young man
..... you'll die, you'll die

The third way proclaimed
Deceive and restrain
Pretend adopt
Things as they are
Put on your feeling
The Fantasy mask
Hide soul in lies
You live now calmly

But soul's not a bird
It can't live in cage
It pins for some time
..... and dies
You'll be it's companion
In leaving the world
Your life is too ruthless
For mercy to wait

I stand on the top
Of the high mountain
Three roads of doom
Lies before me
Hot beams of the sun
Hit my breast
Wind rocks my hair
And calls to the west

I've no decision
Which way to be lead by?
The destiny chosen
But is my choice right?
One road's untaken
Invisible one
To hell or to heaven
Your essence will come

The road is simple
From top of the mountain
You'll knock sea of clouds
And enter your dreams
You will find yourself
In dead sleeps of yours
And music will sound
In the world of daydreams

At the foot of the rock
Where three fates were met
Wind horribly blows
..... in darkness
In rock my remains
Remains of my love
Which was fairy tale
You helped to DESTROY IT!
