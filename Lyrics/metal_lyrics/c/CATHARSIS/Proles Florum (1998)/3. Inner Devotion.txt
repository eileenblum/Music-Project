I loved you, innocence - my guide
But you have spurned my clear love
You've learned to know evil deeds
You've learned what's suffering, pain and blood
There's no sence to cry for help
You've yelled but no one heares you
You've frightened - so you've barely breathed
And horror fillsyour trembling flesh

Your shout aggravated your fate
Escaping violence crushed flesh
As firm as steel, it entered you
And bed have flooded with your blood
This hell for aeons could reign
And agony possesses you
Far away you've saw remote end
And God was sick to give you help

You've played with feeling - danger sneak
You realize you were not right
Human's love is beautiful, you know
But violence breaks its excellence

I have you near me obsessed by force
I've sought for happiness but failed
I didn't want to see you filled but failed
Your images have shattered in your flesh
I loved you, innocence - my guide
But you have spurned my clear love
You've known what waits for you
Those were only pain and blood

[Chorus:]
Crazy love gives rise to violence
Everyone should always remember that
Romance dies under pressure of force
And it'll never be back, it'll never be....
