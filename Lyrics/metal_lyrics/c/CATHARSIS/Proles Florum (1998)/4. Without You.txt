Evil never dies, love &amp;death are close
Flowers withered quickly, I lost you
.... forever

I am diving in the dream
I am thinking this is death
Death, this is what I want now
In my death I'll get the quiet
I'll get quiet and happiness

[Chorus:]
Without you, I can't see this world
Without you, I can't hear sound of leaves
Without you, my soul is dreaming

I can flush in the sky
In the sky and strain the clouds
I can conceive price of self
Price of self-devotion
I can live in my world
In my world without you

[Chorus:]
Without your hands, my heard is a frozen rill
Without your eyes, I'm losing meaning of life
Without your, internal world in my
Without your, my world is emptiness
Without your, my life has died
