Hear the torrents of life
Rupturing all dreams and hopes
Beating and storming the Gates of Heaven!
Life-music's thunder and sights
Shattering mirrors and worlds
Will break down your former self forever

Shed all your chains and soar above
In clear sky where only eagles dare...

Your heart
Will open to your dream
The world around and start
The flame inside your soul

Hear the torrents of life
Rupturing all dreams and hopes
Beating and storming the Gates of Heaven!
Life-music's thunder and sights
Shattering mirrors and worlds
Will break down your former self forever

Shed all your chains and soar above
In clear sky where only eagles dare...

Your heart
Will open to your dream
The world around and start
The flame inside your soul
