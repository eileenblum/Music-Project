[Mission, Jeff, Andrew 'Ace' Kravtsov]

Devil mists hide the edge of the sky
Ashes of waves drown the last of the light
Tear down the sails... You know the score!
Here's the moment of truth
That's been sent from beyond!

Eerie light
That led my sailings
Through tempests of sorrow
And reefs of black woe

Grey ocean turns into deadly black bane
Fangs of the cliffs show the death's grin again!
Blood on your lips... Brace up your will â
It's the last of your fights,
So raise proudly your steel!

Eerie light
That led my sailings
Trough the tempest of sorrow
And reefs of black woe
Let it alight
The path of madmen
Who will place above all
Breath of freedom and love!
