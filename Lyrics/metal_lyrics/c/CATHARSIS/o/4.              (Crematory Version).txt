Fallen archangels together,
Features of tired old men,
Waiting for only one order -
To come back - return back again.
Rally all banners and standards,
Arrows and fragments of swords,
Live once again through the battle
Hundred days and nights.

Give back the heavens,
And let the homesick quench their thirst,
Guild their pathways
Gleaming stardust
Give back the heavens,
Oh, thou the Lord of light and love.
Show your compassion,
Give their wings back, give the wings to them...

Fallen archangels together,
Hard to look straight in their eyes.
Desperate, merciless courage
Gleams on - their brows in the night
They knew - the day wasn't theirs
They knew â they would lose the fight
But they rose back to their feet,
To fight and to die.

Give back the heavens,
And let the homesick quench their thirst,
Guild their pathways
Gleaming stardust
Give back the heavens,
Oh, thou the Lord of light and love.
Show your compassion,
Give their wings back, give the wings to them...

Somewhere out there a wingless shadow is roaming
Lonely and lost is the heart of a wingless nomad
Down on this Earth â for aeons and aeons to come
Give back the heavens,
And let the homesick quench their thirst,
Guild their pathways
Gleaming stardust
Give back the heavens,
Oh, thou the Lord of light and love.
Show your compassion,
Give their wings back, give the wings to them...
