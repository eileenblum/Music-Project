Lethargy slowly forges me
Helplessly I submit
All I feel's animosity
Deep inside I'm strongly hit

Snows and rains are always near
Winds and blizzards serve to me
Hurricanes and storms I hear
No one's able me to see

Insanity is achieving me
Victory fades away
It seems to me I'm in jeopardy
Surely I'm to pay

I have strength of nothing real
Everything obeys to me
Wielding all the words I'm weird
In my wrath I'm Eerie

[Chorus:]
Ere the being I was the king -
Every living is admiring
All's fearing... I am the queen
Every loving is fevering

Triumphal defeat
Of my enemy
I'm honoring it
In wine livery
My hunting proceeds
My victims you are
I'm sowing my seeds
I'm not so far

I'm caught in the trap
I share with you
My heart on my lap...
To heaven I flew

I'm no more lone
Emboded're my dreams
To heaven I've flown -
Above real lees

[Chorus.]
