[Mission / Avlasenko]

Hear the torrents of life
Rupturing all dreams and hopes
Beating and storming the Gates of Heaven!
Life-music's thunder and sights
Shattering mirrors and worlds
Will break down your former self forever

[Bridge I, II]
Shed all your chains and soar above
In clear sky where only eagles dare...

[Chorus I, II]
Your heart
Will open to your dream
The world around and start
The flame inside your sole

Past dreams are better dropped down
Find solid ground in your doubts
Your soul is spinning around madly
Do not think of what's yet to come
You live only here and now
Now you have a chance to become your own self

[Bridge III]
Forget your doubts and fly so high
The world is breathless for your soul alive

[Chorus III]
Just dance
Let fire in your heart
Stir up the pain of lust,
The chains and hell of doubt

[Chorus IV]
Just dance
And follow up your dream
Enigma of your fate
Will open - just believe...
