[Mission / Pushkina]

I have blundered
Separating Death and Life
Even Heaven
Cannot draw that parting line
Heaven's angels can't see human nature
Light of Darkness - they still fly through the Void!

[Chorus]
And the silence flows
On the Isle of God's Bliss...
There your heart will know
When to bend your knees

Snow-washed orchard
Lost all hope for summer glow
Stop that torture!
She, who's near me - let her go
Let her palm the sound of my forename
And dissolve it in chanting stream's voice!

[Coda]
Heaven's angels can't see human nature
Light of Darkness - they still fly through the Void!
