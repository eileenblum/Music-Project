[Mission / Pushkina]

Each of us will find
His own way to Hell and Heaven in his life
But remember that we have two different ways -
One of dreams and one that leads us through the days
Filled with empty fuss

[Bridge I]
But if you dare just ones
Span bridge as straight as a lance
Over wild waters of Life
You'll merge into one both your ways forever...

[Chorus I]
Wind sings in your ears
Drying unwanted tears,
Will and Love and Freedom -
Crusader of Holy Light!

Each of us will find
His own way to warmth and ashes cold as night
Don't you ever think of any thing as slight -
Devil's feeding on the smallest of your frights -
In hope to rip your life!

[Bridge II]
Hesitate for a wink -
Your fiery arrow will miss
And the Evil will melt both your lives
Into meaningless nothing!

[Chorus II]
If you cease to walk blind
Your lives and reasons and will
Will grow with the Holy Light -
You're getting used to the life of Crusader.
