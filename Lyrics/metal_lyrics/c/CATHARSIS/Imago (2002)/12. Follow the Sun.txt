[Mission / Avlasenko]

Life never stops
And the time will stop and wait for... No one!
But we won't know who's the last one
To cast shade on Sands of Time?

Sun fills life with its warm light
And your words will never stop... Sunlight
And it's my choice every morning -
Start my life as something new

[Bridge I]
Playful wind will blow me in the face
- Hey, wake up, it's time to shine! -
And the Sun will send me to the place
Where doubts and shame will not be mine...

[Chorus I, II, III]
What if there's no time tomorrow
To run my usual way?
Sun will give no way to sorrow
Warming up my hope and faith

Evening comes back, giving me a reason
To light up my eyes with smile - gently
For what is gone, with its hasty feelings,
Will dissolve in useless dust

[Bridge II, III]
Let the past die quietly away
Fill with reason each new day
Don't stir up the ashes of before -
Just forget and lock the door...

[Chorus IV]
The Time is flying by us
Not all is as it seems
Maybe I'm growing wiser
Time will never break my dream
