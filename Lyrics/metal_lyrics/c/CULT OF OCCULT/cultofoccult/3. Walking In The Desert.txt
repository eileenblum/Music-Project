Down below and so alone I can't stand,
Starring all around.
All is slow, there's not a drone around there,
Nothing on the ground.
So god damn alone !
Surrounded by void !
Crowds of stupid ghosts, everywhere,
What the fuck !

I'm walking in the desert.

Emptiness is their substance,
They're hollow, insignificant.
Their existence is a non-sense,
I deny them !
Everything is nothing.
Can't they die in pain ?
Suffer and go away ?
To watch them fall like rain I could lead the way.

I'm walking in the desert.

They all deserve to die,
Firing squad in line,
To vanish not deny,
This desert is mine !

Alone, forever.
I walk, the desert !
