Blurry!
Muzzy!
I can't see shit,
my eyes burn.
This hammer hitting my head,
so loud, without breathing.
Memory
isn't working, no,
isn't working.
Pathetic bits and snatches of the past
coming in painful flashes.

Fuzzy is everything,
and everything swirls,
and everything's distant.
Not so good.
Puke,
when everything swirls.
This is my last.

Blurry!
And once again,
and once again,
I'm so
Muzzy!
And once again,
and once again!

Blurry and muzzy,
that's all,
that's all I am!
Blurry and muzzy,
that's all I am,
that's all,
that's all I am!

Hangover is so tasteful.
