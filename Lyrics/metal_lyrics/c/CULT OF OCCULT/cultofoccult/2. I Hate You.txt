I don't care who you are,
I don't care what you think
or what you do.
The only thing I know about you is that I hate you !
Your face, your brain make me sick.

I just cannot bear we're breathing the same air.
I hate you !
No discrimination, soon we will be seven billion,
I've got hatred for everyone.

Black or white people, brown yellow or green,
Christians, Muslims or whatever the sect you're in,
Fat ugly bitches that think they are pretty,
Retarded, genius, poor as rich or stinky,
Politicians, artists, prostitutes and their babies,
Your friends and families, your wives and their pussies,
You, laughing, that think I am joking,
Every fucking country, it's workers, corpses and kings !

I hate you !

I'm so pissed off every day,
If only could knew,
If only you could feel how much I loathe and hate you !
