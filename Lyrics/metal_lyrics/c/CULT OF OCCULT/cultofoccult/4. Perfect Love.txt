Where were you when they pushed me out ?
Trapped like a beast, put in a cage.
Thinking of you,  I couldn't stop.
Sad and depressed,  I missed you my lover. Lover.
And all this years, you were away...
And all this years, I slept with pain,
Emptiness and sorrow were my only friends!
Alone between this walls...
They said I was a fool, but all I was is good.

But now I'm drowned in pure happiness,
Now that I'm free, and that you're with me.
Your body is shaking, don't be afraid.

I'll be tender!
Like I always was.
You are my daughter,
Don't be shy like your mother was!
I will take my revenge!
Did you thought I could change?
I'll beat you up again!
You are married with pain,
The same blood in our veins.

Got anything to say? Then suck and stray!
