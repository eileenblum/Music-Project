We chant the name of Lucifer.
In the darkness of the forest,
Pentagrams lighted by candles.
Prepare for the appearance of our master!
Ã Lucifer.
We are your worshipers.

Occultism reigns,
Evil over the earth.
Darkness reigns,
Disasters, plague and curse.

Devotions, blood and sacrifice.
From the smoke you rise.
The black hoods kneel down your power.
Please bring us Hell, hate, booze forever.

Occultism reigns,
Evil over the earth.
Darkness reigns,
Disasters, plague and curse.
