No lust for life. No need for anything. No desire. No itch. Nofuckingthing. A lack of everything. But it can`t be filled. Only replaced by a strong feeling. Then just one envy. Far deep in my belly. Seeing hate and cruelty. Seeking immortality. Imagining you starving. Consumed by Hell`s flames. Ethylic fuel pissing to rekindle the fire that blames. Praying the demons. Begging the Devil. Impersonate the being. On Earth to exterminate. Desert. Void. Nothing. I don`t need anything. Then just one envy. Far deep in my belly. Seeing hate and cruelty. Seeking immortality. Imagining you starving. I will watch us die and for sure never close my eyes. `cause I love to see us punished for the sins we enjoyed but banished.
