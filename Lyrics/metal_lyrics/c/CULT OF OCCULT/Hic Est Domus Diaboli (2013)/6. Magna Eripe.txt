A black procession as a wonder to behold. 
Determined and leading the way. 
A disturbing silence announcing the jubilation over dark and possessed human masses. 
Communion. Alcohol frenzy. Liquor melts into demonic thoughts. The swarm, as Satan`s hand, raises the sacrificial altar and prepare for the black mass. Introducing the sacrificed. Everyone`s screaming "How lucky you are What a great honor to be Satan`s door. You can be proud. You can celebrate this moment".She stamps her feet while she steps forward death. Envious stares pouring on her back. Sharpen blade shining in her eyes. Throats are chanting. Calling to him. The blood spills but she`s smiling. A celebration. A communion with his spirit. Praying him now to be real. Praying him now! Satan. Master. The punisher. Please free us from this fool humanity. Destroy! Destroy us and everything. We are ready for the apocalypse.
