A mix of pain and freedom. Fear is not anymore. Blood mates with venom. Sanity walked out the door. Venom trip. Swimming in the sky. Venom trip. Jumping on clouds. Venom trip. Fucking with angels. Venom trip. Feeling like a God. This bite is infected. I feel life fading away. I enjoy. I`m dead. I`m tripping in my last day. Venom trip. Drowning in the sky. Venom trip. Puking on clouds. Venom trip. Raping the angels. Venom trip. Slaying some Gods. I see. That`s him. I see. The Devil. I see. He`s coming for me. You`ve been hit by my snakes. Now be my slave. Your life`s dedicated to hate. Spread my words of misery. You`ve upgraded my life. Welcome to the sign of Baphomet that appears on my neck. Don`t worry master. I will obey. They shall prostrate before me. I`ll use black magic. Spells and ancient sorcery. They shall prostrate before me. Now I can express all my hatred. Take me in Hell! Burn me in Hell!!
