IâM GOING CRAZY, IâM TURNING MAD. ALWAYS IN A MOOD FOR HURTING. WORDS SHARPENED AS BLADES. ALWAYS IN A LUST FOR KILLING. IâD STAB EVERYONE. I WANT YOU DEAD, I WANT YOU DEAD AND GONE. I STAB YOU IN THE HEAD. I SEE YOU DEAD, I SEE YOU DEAD AND GONE. THEREâS THIS RED FILTER. IT COLORS THE WORLD WITH MURDER. IMAGES OF YOU ARE FLASHING. EVERYTHING IS SWIRLING, NAUSEOUS FEELING. YOU KNEEL, YOU BLEED, YOU BEG. IâM SMILING. WHEN I REALIZE THIS IS JUST A DREAM, I WANNA MAKE IT FOR REAL, FOR REAL. FUCKING SHIT, IâM SO ANGRY. I CANâT CONTAIN THIS RAGE. SATAN WANTS ME TO KILL YOU ALL. HE WHISPERED, IN MY EAR, I SHOULD DO IT. HE CALLED ME âSONâ, HE SAID HE NEEDS ME. I HAVE TO MAKE EVERYTHING FOR HIM. YOUâRE GONNA DIE NOW. YOUâRE THE FIRST, NOT THE LAST. WATCH THE CHAOS THROUGH MY EYES. AS IâLL PLAY WITH YOU âTILL YOU DIE. IT IS SO GOOD. I CANâT DENY I ENJOYED THAT. HATE AND MURDER ARE SO TRIPPY. IâVE FOUND MY WAY IN THIS POOR WORLD. I CANâT WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN.
