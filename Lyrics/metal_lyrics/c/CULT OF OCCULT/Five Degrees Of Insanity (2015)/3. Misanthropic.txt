I DON'T LIKE YOU. I DONâT WANNA HEAR FROM YOU. I IGNORE YOU BUT I CANâT HELP HATING YOU. A STORM OF LOATHE RAGING INSIDE OF ME. EVERY DAY, AT ANY TIME, HATRED BLOWING WHEN I HAVE YOU IN MY SIGHT. DEEPER. DARKER. DISMAL. WEAKER. FROZEN FEELINGS. DREADFUL MOANING. I WANT TO LIVE ALONE AND WATCH YOU ALL DIE. SATAN, COME QUICK; SHOW YOUR BRUTALITY. PLEASE LET ME SEE HOW YOUâLL MAKE THEM BLEED. I FUCKING HATE YOU, LIAR, BITCH ASS, INNOCENT OR FULL OF GUILT, UGLY PRECIOUS LITTLE KID, YOU STINK, YOU SUCK, FUCK OFF, I DONâT WANNA LIVE WITH YOU, YOU ALL HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME SICK AND VIOLENT, THAT MAKES ME WANT TO BEAT THE FUCK OUT OF YOU; YOUNGER, OLDER, EVERYONE PISSES ME OFF, I DONâT CARE FOR YOUR PROBLEMS, I DONâT WANNA TALK TO YOU, JUST GO DIE. CUNT. BITCH. JERK. SCUM. FAG. WHORE. DOUCHE. PRICK.
