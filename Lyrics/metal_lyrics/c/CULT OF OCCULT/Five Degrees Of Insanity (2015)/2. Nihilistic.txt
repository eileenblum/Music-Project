I AM EMPTY. WE ALL ARE. WORTHLESS PATHETIC EXISTENCES. YOU SAY YOUR LIFE HAS VALUE, YOU SAY YOU DESERVE THE AIR YOU BREATHE. I KNOW YOU ARE USELESS AND AFRAID BY THE TRUTH, YOU ARE INSIGNIFICANT AND IRRELEVANT. THE WHOLE HUMANITY IS FAKE. YOU SHOULD REALIZE NOTHING WILL HAPPEN IF WE DIE. THERE'S NO HOPE. I DESPISE YOUR BEING, I DESPISE YOUR KIND, I DESPISE YOU ALL, YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME SICK. SICK. I BELIEVE IN NOTHING, I CARE FOR NOTHING, I FEEL NOTHING, I AM NOTHING. YOU LIVE FOR THIS. YOU LIVE FOR THIS. YOU CAN SEE NOTHING, YOU PRAY FOR NOTHING, YOU ARE NOTHING AND YOU LIVE FOR THIS. YOU LIVE FOR THIS. OPEN YOUR EYES YOUR LIFE IS SHIT. YOU LIVE FOR THIS. OPEN YOUR MIND IT IS EMPTY. EMPTY. WE'RE NOTHING. IS IT POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUS AS THAT THIS MISERABLE AND PUNY CREATURE, WHO IS NOT EVEN MASTER OF HIMSELF, EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF ALL THINGS, SHOULD CALL HIMSELF MASTER AND EMPEROR OF THE UNIVERSE, THE LEAST PART OF WHICH IT IS NOT IN HIS POWER TO KNOW, MUCH LESS TO COMMAND?
