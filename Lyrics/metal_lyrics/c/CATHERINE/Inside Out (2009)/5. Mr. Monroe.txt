Im breaking my back
To hold this all together
Inside my place
I think im hiding itself
Secretly im with it
His heart would stop
So mind your son
Im not a kid

Try and i try and i try and i try
Im breaking my back for them
Try and i try and i try and i try
Were too late for him

Try and i try and i try and i try
Im breaking my back for them
Try and i try and i try and i try
Were too late for him

Who am i?
Who am i?
Who am i?
Who the fuck are you
Who am i?
Who am i?
Who am i?
Who the fuck are you

Secretly im with it
His heart would stop
So mind your son
Im not a kid
Sleep with both of them Mr monroe

And your acts will get you no where!

Try and i try and i try and i try
Im breaking my back for them
Try and i try and i try and i try
Were too late for him

Try and i try and i try and i try
Im breaking my back for them
Try and i try and i try and i try
Were too late for him

This aint a test
You'll live with this
This aint a test
You'll live with this

Tell me sir
Whats your secret
You got more tricks than a fucking magician

Secretly im with it
His heart would stop
So mind your son
Im not a kid
Sleep with both of them Mr Monroe
And your acts will get you no where!
NO WHERE!!
