Dance, just dance

This is a test
For all of you
To show us just what you can do

You've got the stage
Excite us all
Feel the music
Give shock and awe

Dance to your heart's content
Dance to your heart's content

Just be yourself
Feel this flow
Don't hide, let go

Like Cinderella
I'm dancing all alone
I'm like a prince
Without the throne

You know you like my moves
Fresh and at my best
And if you're lucky
You might be my princess

This is a test
For all of you
To show us just what you can do

You've got the stage
Excite us all
Feel the music
Give shock and awe

Let's the get this party started
Let's start the dance hall
Grab your partner doce and doe 

This song is almost over
Don't be the only one
Let's break it down
Ride along
Fucking have some fun

Like Cinderella
I'm dancing all alone
I'm like a prince without the throne

Dance to your heart's content
Dance to your heart's content

I'm on let's see
Just what you've got
Fucking drop it like it's hot

Just be yourself
Feel this flow
Don't hide, let go

This is a test
For all of you
To show us just what you can do

You've got the stage
Excite us all
Feel the music
Give shock and awe
