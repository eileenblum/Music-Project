Take all you need from me
I give it all to you
But still I fell like a slut
It's just the thought that sticks
The awful thought of it
Frigid fingers are making me sick

Don't you like me inside out 
It's days like these I never doubt 
(Can't believe that we call this life)

Don't you like me inside out
It's days like these I never doubt 
(Can't believe that we call this life)

These are the lives we lead
Just like a cut they bleed
Infected lies like battle wounds
And when your time has come
With the battle far from won
You'll be the one who has to choose
These are the lives we lead
Just like a cut they bleed

Infected lies
Infected lies

Inside out astounded
What makes us think disgust is right
Step back
Am I sick
I feel this way when right turns wrong

Inside out astounded
What makes us think disgust is right
Step back
Am I sick
I feel this way when right turns wrong

Don't you like me inside out 
It's days like these I never doubt 
(Can't believe that we call this life)

Don't you like me inside out
It's days like these I never doubt 
(Can't believe that we call this life)

I think I might throw up
I think I might throw up

Don't you like me inside out 
It's days like these I never doubt 
(Can't believe that we call this life)

Don't you like me inside out
It's days like these I never doubt 
(Can't believe that we call this life)
(Can't believe that we call this life)
(Can't believe that we call this life)
