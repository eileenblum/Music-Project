Tonight i died
And no one knew
I cant sleep
But my eyes wont move
Im a freak ill be just like you
Just a typical fuck up up so soon

Why do i put my self through so much
To play along
Why do we put ourselves through so much OH MY GOD
Why do i put my self through so much
To play along
Why do we put ourselves through so much OH MY GOD

I'm a sad piece of Shit

Im the one that you miss
Im a sorry excuse not a fight
Now im tired to breathe
Never able to sleep
I think i might, must be bloating

Why do i put my self through so much
To play along
Why do we put ourselves through so much OH MY GOD
Why do i put my self through so much
To play along
Why do we put ourselves through so much OH MY GOD
