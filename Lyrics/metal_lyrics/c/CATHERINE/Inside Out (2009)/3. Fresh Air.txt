Let me slip away
I am not afraid, of what awaits me

Let me fall below
Discover all that I was meant to see
Describe to me
Describe the way you feel
Bring me with you
Let me pass
Feel the rage from inside

Just let go
Let it take you
Free your mind and stay alive

Just let go
Let it take you
Take the easy
Take the easy way out

Before you speak
Tell me with those eyes
Looks will only
Get in the way

Before you speak
Tel me with those eyes
Looks will only
Get in the way

Just let go
Let it take you
Free your mind but stay alive

Just let go
Let it take you
Take the easy
Take the easy way out

My body belongs
And it's so soft
My heart deserves a second guest
