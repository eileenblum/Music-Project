My Friend
I've never seen this side of you
I've yet to see your mind
The sadness just waking up to these scars
So anxious
Please take this time to reevaluate your life
To rearrange your mind

Think this through
To see what you got onto right now
Think this through
To see what you got onto know

Not just a spill
This is real
There are consequences
Let's make a deal
Down to here
Lay down our defenses
This is our time
Your demise
We'll beat this shit together

Think this through
To see what you got onto right now
Think this through
To see what you got onto know

My Friend
I've never seen this side of you
I've yet to see your mind
The sadness just waking up to these scars
So anxious
Please take your time

Nobody likes a friend who's dead
Nobody likes a friend who's dead

Don't let this go, fight
Don't let this go, fight 

Don't pull them on you, fight
Don't pull them on you, fight
Don't pull them on you, fight
