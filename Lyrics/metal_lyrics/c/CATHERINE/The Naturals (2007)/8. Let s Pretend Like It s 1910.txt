You feel as if the ground is folding
The playing field has never been on your side
Blame them all for the pain you're inflicting
Look at you, you're just along for the ride

Team with those who sympathize for your weakness
Environments that hold and never let go

Never let go!

If lust is trust, If lust is trust, if lust is trust
Than can call me your savior.
If lust is trust, if lust is trust, if lust is trust

THE SKIN OF LIARS ALWAYS TASTES THE SWEETEST
She always tastes the sweetest.

You feel as if the ground is folding
The playing field has never been on your side
Blame them all for the pain you're inflicting
Look at you, you're just along for the ride

WHY DON'T YOU GET IT?
