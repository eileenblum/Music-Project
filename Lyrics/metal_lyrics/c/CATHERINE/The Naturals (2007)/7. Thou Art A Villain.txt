Hours change as seasons show just like before
My feet are chained to stakes and i will never soar
They always asked me for keys to open gates
But tell me why we think a promise land awaits
They always asked me for keys to open gates
But how would i know? But how would i know?

Look! I'm melting

Living more like the ones we claim to hate
We'll try this one more time
Please your peers with a promise, priorities
We'll try this one more time

fill me with another glass to pass along this demons grsp now!

They say this time it's different, of course this time it's different (x2)

There's no hero in me now, and I'm melting inside.

There's no heroes, There's no heroes
There's no heroes, There's no heroes
There's no heroes, There's no heroes
You'll have no such luck this time
