I'm Not Like The Rest

The night pretends not to notice I'm the only one who's yet to sleep
For the moonlight cast the shapes that fit me best

Day time brings those who this and that but see not what my eyes do
Carried across these colored maps by the cloak of could this be
My eyes see these light-less canvases as beauty at its best
but something tells me I'm not like the rest

As the sun comes down I look around and realize this is home

Make believe you're paths of excellence mean more because the daylight.
And that my means of life are insufficient, yea you're right

the night pretends not to notice I'm the only one who's yet to sleep
for the moonlight casts the shapes that fit me best

Praise the night time. You could have seen this coming
Praise the night time. You could have seen this coming
Praise the night time. You could have seen this coming
Praise the night time. You could have seen this coming

Day time brings those who this and that but see not what my eyes do
Carried across these colored maps by the cloak of could this be
My eyes see these light-less canvases as beauty at its best
but something tells me I'm not like the rest

I'm not like the rest

This is where you end and I begin
