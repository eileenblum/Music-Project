What's your name?
What's your name son?
Say, what's your real name?

What have I become?
I'm so in love with myself again.

All this time I never knew that what you meant was what you said.
Oh no, what's that...100th time, the 100th time.

What's your name son?
What's your real name?
What's your name son?
What's your real name?

I'm so in love again.

What have I become?
I'm so in love with myself again.

I dream of days when I can when I can smile never doubting not.
A day when what you want is nothing more than what you've got.
I can't stand beside you while you rot inside.

What have I become, I'm so in love.
