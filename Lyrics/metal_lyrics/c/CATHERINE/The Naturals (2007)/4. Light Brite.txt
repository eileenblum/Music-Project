Mark my words, but makr them not with darkest pigment.
Pay head, but money doesn't grow on trees. Don;t let me hear you walking closer.

Screaming whispers, yes you hear me.
Freed from your eyes.
Screaming whispers, yes you hear me.
We'll bring your demise.

Thinking maps were made for us to follow.
You showed me light was near, the brightest light is here.
We tend to always cling to comfort. Now I'm your greatest fear, the brightest light is here.

Hearing things we've all been told a thousand times.
Making judgements, selling lives $9.95.
Teach me of the ways to tear apart this structure.

This land is bare, it's so unfamiliar. We'll find out way back home.
We'll find a way, we always find a way.
You kno we'll find a awy, find a way back home now.
Find a way back home tonight.
We'll find our way back. Home now.
Find a way back home tonight.
We'll find our way back home.

Thinking maps were made for us to follow. You showed me light was near, the brightest light is here.
