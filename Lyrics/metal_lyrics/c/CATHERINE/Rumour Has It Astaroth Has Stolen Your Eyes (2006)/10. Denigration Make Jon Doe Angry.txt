Each time you open your mouth
I want to rip your heart out
Each word you say to me
Is designed to make me
Hate myself worse than I
Have ever hated you?
With you the scene is a battlefield
Death to all who don't look like you
But you wear a uniform too
With you the scene is war
You say that were face
You say that were talentless
But you dance just the same
You are a coward
You don't want a unity
All you want is uniformity
So much for your
Claims of acceptance and brotherhood
You are a heartless snake
I hope one day
You face your vision and it destroys you
Like the dream you claim to embrace
I hope one day your scene destroys you
