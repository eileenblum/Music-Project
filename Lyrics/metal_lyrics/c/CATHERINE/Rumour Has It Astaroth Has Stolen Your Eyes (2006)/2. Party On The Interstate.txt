I don't care how blue your eyes are,
You'll never get away
Tongue tied to that spread eagle traffic jam leper
It's a party on the interstate
Everyones just pulling in
Everyones just getting off
What lies between is just another ride to us
Don't hold on for too long
That gal ain't what she used to be
Fast lane to fornication
Just watch out for spare parts
Discarded in the frenzy
We've been riding this for far too long now
Just don't be surprised when the wheels are falling off
