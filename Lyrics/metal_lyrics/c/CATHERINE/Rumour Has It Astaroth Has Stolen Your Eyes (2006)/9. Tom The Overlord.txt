The resistance falls beneath our onslaught.
Unstoppable force, watch our numbers grow.
Join our dark army it only costs your soul, and a box of hair dye.
Tom the overload owns all your friends.
And you'll never stop us, we're better dressed than you.
Organized melodrama, the world according to popularity.
Your friends are numbered.
We'll help you count the bodies.
Your friends are number.
We'll are a sophisticated ego mass.
But we're all afraid we all live in fear.
We assemble every weekend.
We'll turn this world into a soap opera.
Lights, camera, action.
We are the overload.
