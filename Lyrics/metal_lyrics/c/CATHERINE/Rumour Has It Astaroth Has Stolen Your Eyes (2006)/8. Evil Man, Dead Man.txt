Still we fight we march to war
Never knowing when well fall
Fueled by a call to cleanse
A call from our god to spill
Your blood
We are tireless
We are loveless
We show no mercy and we know not peace
And our war will end end with your head on a stake
This fire in our eyes
Will guide you to eternity
We spare not the weak and we spare not the cowardly
And this fire will guide you our peace is in death
Your fate lies on our blades
Evil man dead man rest in ashes know your own hell
