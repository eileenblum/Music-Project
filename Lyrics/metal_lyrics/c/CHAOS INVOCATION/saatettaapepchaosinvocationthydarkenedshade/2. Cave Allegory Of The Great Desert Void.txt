[performed by Chaos Invocation]Viscerous am I, amid the shadowy oceans the naught and all are lucid

In vain, thy self devoid of hearts impend Apep's blood, glows fiercely
Communing among the blizzard beasts, seeds assert theistic liberty

Bounded by stones, Ra's slavery, adorn thou blood's disdain
Daylight attain, the blight was busted feign

The brood was born and eons scorned by lightened dissonant gods
Nexions subsists, devoted luminous feasts, revelation of the Azoth

Geb, Nuit adorn, the dread was born, immoral fire illuminate
In elect's veins, Khem Sedjet flames, to bury Ra-Atum's suns

Osiris descend, Dark God's ascend, nocturnal evermore
From Nun's abysm giants arise in bliss, to form nebulous deeps

The Ogdoad Khmun, recoil in gloom, devour the barren soma
Azoth's revive, Atozoth's strive, to mark the seals eleven
The seven heads, Duat's oceans dreads and sinks Maat's progeny sheds

Cascade of Nun... Cascade of Nun...

But Isfet inhales in 72 veils, to shatter the vacant clay
And Set is nigh to sway the night sky, the unsighted dragon sights

Cascade of Nun... Cascade of Nun...
