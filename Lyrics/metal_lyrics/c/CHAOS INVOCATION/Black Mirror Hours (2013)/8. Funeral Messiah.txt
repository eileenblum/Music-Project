Two in Flames!
Recognize what I have brought
Lord of mine, Saint of assassins
Hear my sought!

I feel I am coming nearer 
Through the starless night I dive
Over the reddened nebulous winds
I feel you coming nearer

The scythe will carve the firmament
And cut the  in lank loops moving cells
The cloaked lies clear in death 
Shimmering in the blades created swath

Qayin Falxifer!

I live with the scorpio
I am a fireborn
I curse the clay - born ego
And pierce all hearts with a single thorn

He is Lord upon us 
Lord of all graves - Funeral Messiah
He will come to us 
We welcome you - Funeral Messiah 

Qayin Dominor Tumulus 

Crux Calvaria is laid
Oh Lord of the grave mound
Brandish the bellicum wand into the fumes
Let the dead rise from their tombs

I kneel where Abel lies
In honour to your deed
Skeleton master, controller of shades
Graves are what I feed 

Qayin Rex Mortis

Oh you shadow of mine 
Every bone bears your sign 
Deliver me now as the last consequence
Bury me, just leave me my sense

Since long I have crowned o king 
Now I write my name thirteen times
For one last wish to fulfil
These may be my last lines

He is lord upon us 
Lord of all graves - Funeral Messiah
He will come to us
We welcome you - Holy Death - Funeral Messiah
