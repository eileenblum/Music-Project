Magoa Paymon Amaymon
Timeless end
Timeless end
Released from all able to bend
Our souls inside this profane plane
What we become is unable to tame
Satanic pride
Satanic pride
We are fulfilled with pure delight
We dominate and leave Worlds destroyed 
As we ascend out of the void
Where the light is hidden
And  the dark is living
We found the source of true Life
We build the greatest temple
Build a link
Build a channel
To the Paramount level
Where the light is hidden
And the dark is living
We direct our subconscious
For eternity
For eternity
Where the light is hidden
And the dark is living
We change old symbols into ours
We explored the Craft of recreation
Explored the inner
Explored to travel
To the Paramount level
Where the light is hidden
And the dark is living
We yet embrace divine
Solemn and as fraternity
For eternity
Magoa Paymon Egym Amaymon
We transgress all your laws
And let chaos thrive
We unchained Azi Dahak
And let chaos thrive
The portals are closed
