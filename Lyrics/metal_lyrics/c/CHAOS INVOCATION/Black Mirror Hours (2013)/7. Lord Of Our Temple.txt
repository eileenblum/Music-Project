Mist embraces the temples walls
The circle gathered
Flesh upon the altar
Hearts pound faster
In expectance, not in fear
All servants kneel
While the Lord is near
Your aeon is now
You are the access and intelligence
You are the success and wisdom
You are the past
You are the current
You are the future
You are the time
You are the ultimate perfection
You are the core of Everything
You are all I want to be
Your aeon is now
Worlds narrow your might
Hear now my voiceless doxology
Blood is covering the circles hands
We have dared to call your name
Lord
We have dared to call you
Lord
We have dared to walk with you
