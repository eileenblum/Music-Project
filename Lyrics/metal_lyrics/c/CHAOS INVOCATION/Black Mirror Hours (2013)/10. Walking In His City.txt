A stench and one truth
Boils in this stale air
Welcome to the Concrete gangland
Come prove your drowsing flair
See the shadows fall
Into the black dimension
See the streetlight fed with sin
Don't share yours
Lock them deep within
Conceive
Attain
Realize
Your anger
Through windows stare
See them in the corners 
See them all
Behind the Cold embracing walls
Hear them whispering and hear them call
Anger became my drug
Tatort sin
Let's inundate the city
Tatort Satan
Away from the constant light
The wet ground reflects you see
Away completely tensed
A reflection that seems to flee
Concieve
Attain
Realize
Your anger
Luminaries hang like speechless humorists
While they peregrinate the paths of Life
You are this boulevards abysmal notoriety
Rancorous
Dazed but focused with furtive knife
You ghost of my loathsome moments
Living in a disused mental room
Remembering the hidden is hungry
And always ready to consume
They hustle forth disturbed
They hustle back in anxious
One truth coils in this stale air
This city
Thiis city is insane
They are coming 
They are riding
Upon the cruel winds of rebirth
Once they catch you
They won't let you
Ever return from here
Comment
Demand
Realign
My life
