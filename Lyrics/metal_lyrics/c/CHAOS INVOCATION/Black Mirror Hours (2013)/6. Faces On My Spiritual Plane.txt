Clear revealing night
A man seeks for the essence
He is an insane being
These faces belong here
Where light is broken twice
To welcome now the stranger that has made his rise
He opened another door
Out of which thee gaze in visions
Strangulated by his own
Expectations and inner competitions
Upon the barriers feasting with twilight eating Eyes
Onward resisting
Being human is an oath
So he stared into their eyes
Insane being
Oh multidimensional plane take me for eternity
For these eyes were never shut
Upon humanity feasting with twilight eating eyes
You can't resist their will when they gaze into your eyes
Insane being
