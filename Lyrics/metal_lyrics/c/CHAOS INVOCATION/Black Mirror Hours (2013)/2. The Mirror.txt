Light up, light up the altar Candle
Light up, light up thyself
Candlelight extensively bursting into flames
Aroused by what slumbers between the coiling flame
Spitting and screaming his appearance is long since distorted
A whirl centric roams
Edged and by a thousand Eyes escorted
Worlds will collide Masak Mavdil is awaking through the mirrors lap
Lean your chest into the whirl
Dive through the back
Worlds will collide onward to the precipice
Into the greatest labyrinth of all
To mount the throne from which wisdom reins
And to fetch this existence fall
Keep on pushing forward from the tree of Life
Towards the tree of knowledge
I hold both
Fruit and key
I have seen Qulielfi
The tunnel that does match
Be aware of that knowledge is an altar that lies arcane
And of that that dark is Deep
Able to become your bane
Be aware of that acquaintance with him who hides Shemhamforash
Won't guarantee a blessing 
Malkuth - beware I came from the womb
The mirror has become your festering wound
Malkuth - hide your face in shame
The essence of the mirror through me brought in human shape
