Let us form now hearts
Curses are born from tongues
Let us form now hearts
And let them drip and burn
The portals will be open
Energetic rivers flow
Into spheres beyond our own
True initiaton they bestow
The hanged foetus keeps on swinging
And replaced our pendulum
The bells are ringing
All throats are singing
A cacophony of endless power
The hour is soon
The black mirror hour
Delirium worship and total abandon
All Lifes became undone
Delirium worship and total abandon
We raise hell Before we are gone
Delirium worship and total abandon
The Tools to make us see death in Life
Life in death
To live with thee
Infernal Queen
Darkest mother
Let us suck the nectar from your breast
Antithesis of Cosmic procreation
We offer more than what beats in our chest
We have found the serpent and made it rise
Our feet are seared with blood
Our shadow moves while our body rests
We are consistent with the darkest god
Let us form now hearts
Curses are born from tongues
Let us form now hearts
And let them drip and burn
Holy works
Delirium worship and total abandon
All Lifes become undone
Delirium worship and total abandon
We raise hell Before we are gone
Delirium worship and total abandon
The Tools to make us see
Death in Life
Life in death
To live with thee
Ama Lilith
A rebirth into your realm
Is what we are aiming for
Ama Lilith
Your cup of abomination
A dangerous but blessful door
