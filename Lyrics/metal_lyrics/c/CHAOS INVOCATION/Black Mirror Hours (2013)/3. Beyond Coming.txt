And the testimonial spark reaches deep into their heart
Bursting finally out of the secret gloomy mist
To satisfy the hunger with a snake instead of the fist
Seraphic shadow figures ghostly heralds of death
Come to swallow lives
Choke the throat take the breath
Those are carved in traits of horror and disgrace
Just all over their inhuman grimace
The cedar of Sheol they are watering
The temple of Lebanon they are shattering
They step into the pool of the usurper's brand
And take them to where the heavens end
Beyond coming, beyond coming
Madness released
They will fall like rain upon giant seas of fire
And nothing will remain
Neither day nor night
And as you meet them as a mortal child
They will show you
That there is nothing human left inside
They strike over Cosmic structures
Graceless and restless
They hunt for flesh and souls
Soon you will be breathless
Soon to be breathless
They will break the vetters of the World
The house of Salomon damned and broken
The veins of Jesreel sprung wide open
They step into a place of burning graves
To recruit an army of undead serving slaves
Death - you cannot hide from death
You cannot save your breath
They will find you
Fear - you can't deny your fear
When they are coming near
They are the beyond coming
A vastly mayhem they set free
As they pass the borders which you can't see
They are the ship that rides the Waves tonight
To bring the feeble beyond all light
A vastly mayhem they set free
As they pass the borders which you can't see
Awakened now through our summoning
They are here and now
Beyond coming
Madness released
