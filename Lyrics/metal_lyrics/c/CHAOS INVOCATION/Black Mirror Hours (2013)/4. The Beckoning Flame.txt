What do you see when you shut your Eyes and you're roaming through the fog
What will you follow in the tangle of lanterns waiting to lead the mob
Into the dead end of causality
But is this the determination of the faustian visionary
Beyond borders, beyond order
Lies the hidden path of endlessness
Today visionary, tomorrow Messiah
Preaching the essence of beckoning
Fire - natural Majesty of repugnant destruction
Fire - the beckoning flame prevails in ultimate splendor
Fire - revealing constant aspect of Satan
Fire - it burns in those of the luciferian gender
Prevail
Prevail
Deep inside the greatest abyss reveals the brightest light
Fire - natural Majesty of repugnant destruction
Fire - the beckoning flame prevails in ultimate splendor
Fire - revealing constant aspect of Satan
Fire - it burns in those of the luciferian gender
Leave all these lanterns behind
You're able to shine even more
Follow the path deeper into the dark
And you will find the core of the beckoning flame
