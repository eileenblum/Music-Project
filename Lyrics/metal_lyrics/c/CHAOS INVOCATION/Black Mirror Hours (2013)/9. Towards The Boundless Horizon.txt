The moon is hanging in utmost Bright
Tonight strikes the final hour
I give my soul right back to the source that once filled me up with power
From the very beginning until the end surrounded and walking save
By the light of illumination that is now leading me into the candle grave
One more step to take Before the arch is passed
And one last organ dies between the spine and chest
The stellar door is opened an other closed instead
No return from here
Where graceless angels are smiling dead
One thousand eyes are gazing and Crying bloody tears
Their souls are mourning restless right beside my ears
Invisbile claws embed and scratch above my ones
They take me nearer through the hungry plane among the thrones
A crepuscular atmosphere guides the moment
I take the knife and wrest from Life
In utter favour
Completely fearless caressing the blade to let it frantic strike
The mental core is leaving 
I visualise the sovereign right Before my closed eyes
He is beckoning to take his Cold hands and finally under the vigilance of thee
I start to arise
The sun won't shine again
I kill it's fire
I take it's rows and douse it whole
The crossroad is here
Now is the time to choose the path
To separate flesh from soul
There is nothing left
Thus I fall upon the pentacle from the vaults I aspire and I roam
Towards the boundless horizon
Father
Satan
Guide me home
I light up my world
