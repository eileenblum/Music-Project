From morn till eve our theme shall be
Thy wisdom's wondrous measure;
To sacrifice our flesh for Thee
Shall be our aim and pleasure

The dead heartbeat of dispensation
May your kingdom come - Amen!
The hidden light scale of salvation
May your kingdom come - Amen!

Weigh us now
Weigh us now

Of death we are no more afraid,
New life from Thee is flowing;
Thy hand affords us cordial shade
When the tedious sun is glowing

Weigh us now
Weigh us now

Oh, lord, we are most willingly
We bear, what thou commandest
The flesh of earth into the abyss
We do what thou demandest

Our stream of life shall ever be
A current flowing ceaselessly
Thy constant praise outpouring
Your crossroads are many such as your names
To know them all we'd walk through flames
And spend a lifetime with exploring

And when those flames consumed and passed
On Thee our searching souls shall rest
As under a covering willow
Thou secrets our anchor when by woe
Our heart is driven to and fro
On trouble's surging billows

And there, in garments richly wrought
As Thine own bride, we shall be brought
To stand in joy beside Thou

And with Thy glory we shall see
And taste Thy kingdom's pleasure,
Thy womb our royal robe shall be,
Our joy beyond all measure

The dead heartbeat of dispensation
May your kingdom come - Amen!
The hidden light scale of salvation
May your kingdom come - Amen!
