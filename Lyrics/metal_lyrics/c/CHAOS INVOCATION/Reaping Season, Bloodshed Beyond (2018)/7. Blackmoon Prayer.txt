A blackmoon prayer lingers in the temple

Permeate me wholly, angel of the blackmoon
I have opened my mind just for you
Permeate me wholly, grant me with visions
So through my dormancy I can sink into...

Adjourn into this room in which I await you
Lying prepared right beside your candle
Through the dark of the night I enter the dreamworld
And gape into the fiery house you build and handle

Transform this cuboid into your holy temple
Come permeate and make my senses temble

Until the flame of the candle is doused by time
Angel be with me, angel stay present
When the flame of the candle is doused by time
Out of the fiery space I reach for your hand

A blackmoon prayer still lingers in the temple

The structures I see are turning in whirls
Into clear defined and blissful pictures
The candle's flame splits and flickers wild
While I am moving on to the other side

Until the flame of the candle is doused by time
Angel stay with me, angel stay present
The flame of the candle is doused by time
When the sun of the morning terminates this journey's end

Permeate me wholly, angel of the blackmoon
Come share with me what you already know
Come and permeate me wholly,
Come and dismember this dream
Eclipse this limited and secular show
Share my consciousness either I am high or I am low

An angel is coming, again
An angel is coming, tonight!

Again I pray for your presence
I lid up the candle right beside me
I already sense you...
