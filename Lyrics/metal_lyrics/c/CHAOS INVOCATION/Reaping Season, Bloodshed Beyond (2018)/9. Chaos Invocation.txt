With the hands in the sir
And the knees on the ground
A body moves in the rhythm
Of words that were sung or spoken out loud
To sound between planes standing in friction

It starts as a blaze
That soon lights a fire
Inside and all around you
A finger that points towards unknown directions
To paths leading away from the stagnating slew

Emerge!
Soon you know the voice that is calling!

Unsown fields we have sown
And its fruits we harvested
And tasted, and relished
Digested and understood them
Alone!

A matterless kingdom
An invisible crown
For the absolute spirit
Existing in its own...

Pass through mortifications
Marths holding hands evade
Go with the highest thoughts
To the pristine state

The chaos semen impregnates
The fields of our thoughts landscapes
Altar and magic, sacred throne
Invoking chaos in our own...

Black rain is falling
And washes us clean
From physical yearning
And the dirt we have seen

Black rain is falling
And floods our mind
Black are the tears
Old eyes, but never blind

Emerge from the bones to the blood seas
And emerge from the skin to the shadow
Emerge from the shadow and devour it
You don't need one on your throne
Placed apart from the world

The chaos semen impregnates
The fields of our thoughts landscapes
Altar and magic, sacred throne
Invoking chaos in our own...

Unsown fields we have sown
And lie fruits we harvested
And tasted, and relished
Dignested and understood them
Alone!

And so embed the heart in sheer darkness
Let it grow and pulse in horrific beauty
Your own shadow is paling
Since the human factor is fading
The gates opened wider, and wider and wider
You know whose voice is calling
Yours!
