A whisper in the trees
Beneath the fields where murderous lust is growing
A white thick rising carpet
So inconspicuous but so inestimable rich of content

A shadow between shadows
Fathomed by senses that work unspoiled
Prepares the harvests blood-soaked fruits
A shadow between shadows
Guides into the unseen
Into the realm beyond the mist where no one else before has ever been

A whisper soars from the trees
To manifest, to create and to transform
Into the voice of blood foretelling that
The misty carpets mysteries will be breathed

Now bring forth the energies wiser and old
Bring forth the energies that cannot be controlled

The first murderer reaps with scythe and with fist
Jahweh removed like a sebaceous cyst
Blood shall drain to set his fields in bloom
Blood shall drain and cover every glume

Expelled from the old lands released into bliss
Never before felt freedom so strong
The wild within man needs to be lived
And retained like a seldom and eminent gift

The first murderer reaps with scythe and with fist
To let manifest those who coexist
Blood shall drain to set his fields in bloom
Rich be the harvest to let everyone consume

A shadow between shadows
A wolf among sheep
As a liberated among slaves
He comes to bury them deep in the mist

The caintaclyst's scythe rules over the fields on which blood semen sprouts

The first murderer reaps with scythe and with fist
He who switched and dived through the mist
Blood shall drain to set his fields in bloom
Behold and beware the impulse that spreads doom
