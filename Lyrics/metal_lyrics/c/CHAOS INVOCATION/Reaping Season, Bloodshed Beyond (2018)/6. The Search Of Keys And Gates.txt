Salve snake-like shadow
Our path leads to your waters
On the wavess of your holy urine
We sail permitted stop your pharynx

And the ground was knocked!

Tiamat in focus, we yet hold the keys
Our eyes are gazing hungry through veils of a salty breeze
Eleven guide us now through the abyss of the self
We see the gate and let it open

The cosmos to redeploy
To annihilate and to destroy

Left emanation, Deus Absconditus
All aspects came together
Fervid impulsess from the
Netherworld came closer

Closer to Akarma!

It is time to
Bring the blood, bring the blood
Let the darkness manifest
Murder, magic, trembling figures
Bury the dagger into the chest
Come gaze into, the divine flame
Drag it deep and let it rest
Oh greater darkness manifest

Death in heart, death in heart
Let the darkness manifest
Rape the causal and let it bleed
Flames ascend from the chest
We took the keys and searched further
For the locks that thee have blessed
Oh greater darkness manifest

Ever though we hold them high and they shine
They will not see we unlocked infinity
They will not see divine
And never will they see the world with our eyes

A haze climbs up the abyss
As the ground was knocked again

Twice the ground was knocked
And worms coil in spirals out of the earth
Gather the devils genuine perish
Before the gate they shall uphold their arms
Right into the rapacious living dark
To welcome those pierced by the nightside spark

Three times we proclaimed the manifestation

To wake the slumbering dark in everyone
To reveal the dawn that is about to come

Meet us where the sun is moving
And the moon is fixed
Seek the shores where black flowers bloom
Meet us beyond Styxx

Taste the blood, taste the blood
Let the darkness manifest
Murder, magic, unsouled figures
An abyss where once that chest
Traces unseen, whispers unheard
We walked the path, solved the quest
And in the end we manifest
