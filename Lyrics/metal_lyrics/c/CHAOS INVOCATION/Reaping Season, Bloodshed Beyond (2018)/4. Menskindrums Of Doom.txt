Can you hear the drums of doom?

Necklets build out of eyes and bone fragments
Minds that were shared with gods
Times when words contaminate clans with fear
We revive this cult again

As it was long time ago,
When men were hunt
For the sacrifice of gods
As it was long times ago,
When man were unskinned
And tightened to wood

Blood-source crafting blades
Muscles lay bare
Bloodmoon hunt and deathcult rites
The night is red

A flame light serpent
Coils through the woods
To devour and to vomit up
At the skull pyramideon

Swing the bones
Summon gods
Feel the beat vibrating
On men-skin-drums
Swing the bones
Summon gods
Fleshy gifts
For divine tongued

Froth in front of our mouth
Life juice runs from our brow
Madness captured our eyes
When we beat in trance
The men-skin-drums

Men do winoe
When skin vibrates
It's hunting season
When skin vibrates
Hearts stop beating
When skin vibrates
We swing the bones with vigour
Offerings will be brought
When skin vibrates

A vexing tension floods the land
May survive the virile hand
To act reverent in the estates
Of the fraterniy that destroys and creates

Blood-source crafting blades
Muscles lay bare
Hearts are taken

Swing the bones
Summon gods
Feel the beat vibrating
On men-skin-drums
Swing the bones
Summon gods
Fleshy gifts
For divine tongues

Bloodmoon hunt and deathcult rites
The night is red
Hearts are taken
