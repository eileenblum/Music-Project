These must be the last twitches
Too long you have hold me down
Among gods neither mercy nor resistance
Should guide hands

This night is long

I see your shape so flawless
In the light of your paling dawn
The moon is weaning
Destined to fall in brume and vells so red
You walk on planes that soon fade black

Your sceptre is our blade
Your mortal entity our aid
To take both we have sworn
And what we have sworn we fulfill
You will bath in blood
Through which gods are born

Disciples on divine route
Man in flames most acute
Hunters between heaven and root
Ajna Assassins Absolute

Yet in rotation
Powers of willforce

Circle through me, conflict of hunter and victim
Cricle through me, conflict come to an end

Still in rotation
The powers of willforce

Assassins hunt with Ajna wide open

These have be the last twitches
No longer you'll hold me down
Among gods neither mercy nor resistance
Guides our hands

One dead and one reborn
Into streams where no thought can sail
One dead, one reborn
Into streams where free man reign forlorn

Disciples on divine route
Man in flames most scute
Hunters between heaven and root
Ajna Assassins Absolute

So circle through me, conflict of slave and of free man
Circle through me, conflict come to an end

Let's murder the slave
