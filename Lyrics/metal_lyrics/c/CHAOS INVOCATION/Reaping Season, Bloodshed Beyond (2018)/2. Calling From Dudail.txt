Calling and rising up from Dudail
Let tremble all soils of the earth
From the desert where horns lie buried
To the seas that evaoprate
From the heights where flames erupt
To the depths that aspirate

To dig a tunnel into the ground
Might be enough to bury flesh
That will embrace and become
One with this soils that will tremble, break and fall

Sia! The soils tremble and break and fall!

Calling and rising up from Dudail
Angels standing on the slopes
Calling and rising up from Dudail
Angels gaze out of burning robes

We shovel with our hands at eruptions of hell
And wherever we hear the fire bearers yell

To dig a tunnel into a hill
In quest for its core
Might take its time
But it makes you stronger
And prepares you for more

To dig a tunnel into a mountain
Prospects holes in torso
Prospects holes in psyche
Repeat it like a prayer
Willpower and death have to merge
The harder the stones, the greater our urge

Samael spread your hidden fire
Lilith spread your hidden fire
The watchers are with us
The soils yield, the tunnel is done now

Calling and rising up from Dudail
Angels gather round the flame
Calling and rising up from Dudail
Azazel is yelling our name - we awoke
