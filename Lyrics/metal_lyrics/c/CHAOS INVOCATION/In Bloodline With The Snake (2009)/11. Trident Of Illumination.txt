Three veils came out of Ain Sof. Formless, but of illuminating dark, the thoughtless light burns in the trident mark. Where Molochâs fires burn they shall become, the three veils born from the chaos sun. The divine dagger cleansed with satanic art, yet pierced my phallus, head and heart. From underneath my skin through these parts golden light explodes, the blood of gods. Lylusay Tateros Volt Sids Lucifer! Contamination, the triple vertex reaches deeper. Lucifer ascends! Annihilation, the black throne is supreme. Lucifer ascends! The transfer portals open sunrise like and the craving beast reveals his sight. From the gateways unbound tonight, we praise the powers of limitless light. Lylusay Tateros Volt Sids Lucifer! The atmosphere before Satan yet is fulfilled. Between the horns of Dudail burns the flame. Inside the womb of Tiamat evil incubates, reaching the level of ultimate power.
