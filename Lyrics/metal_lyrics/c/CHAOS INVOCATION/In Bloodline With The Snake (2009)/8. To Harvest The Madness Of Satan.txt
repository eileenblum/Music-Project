Behind him burns the fire of all profane paths, his semen is spread from a thousand arms. On fields where a stench is still hovering, unfaithful children harvest in flesh within. I hear the screams of burning mouths, yet his malformed beasts and putrid angels tremble. Their hymn of death so forceful sounds from the hungering shallow and his radiant temple. A lament triad sounds now from the bleeding heavens black, the dying trinity is chanting a trident buried in their back. The hovering mist still bears the stench. Underneath lies the fruit of worldâs damnation. Unfaithful children fall on his fiery fields, they harvest the madness of Satan. The sceptre of the world lies in seas of blood and shadows and the putrid fornication unveils sublime in fumes. Their power is growing so does the resolute storm of Satan. The praise of the arcane prayers fulfils all cosmic rooms! Madness and perversion is directed from where he stands. Chaos and darkness manifest where he held his hands. Orders cleared! The crop through flesh revealed in earthly blood and heavens fire, for I shall become! The crop of a thousand ends now all bears the one. The hovering mist still bears the stench. Underneath lies the fruit of worldâs damnation. Unfaithful children fall on his fiery fields, they harvest the madness of Satan.
