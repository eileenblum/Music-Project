In verba magistri ivare! Oh great fornicator to whom I give my body and soul. Obnoxious force to whom I give my flesh and will. A phallus like I shall penetrate the cunt of life. Chavajoth, to you in every moment I give my lust!

Omnio ad majorem dei gloriam! Oh consuming darkness to whom I gave my body and soul. Nocturnal daimon to whom I gave my flesh and will. Sinister energies, magical powers I beseech you to burst the heavens. Chavajoth, to you in every moment I give my praise!

Per omnia saecula saeculorum! I installed the pure evil to be my inner flame. Breathless death and life now shall be the same. The temple in which all shall manifest is the sphere I gaze into. Chavajoth, to you in every moment I give my visualization!

Finis coronat opus! Reveal them, reveal them death, so reveal them the suffocating breath. Proclaim them, proclaim them none, exoteric illusions yet become one, with chaos. Bring Terror to those, who claim to be the Highest! Reveal them, reveal them death, so reveal them the suffocating breath. Proclaim them, proclaim them none, exoteric illusions yet become one, with chaos. Finis coronat opus!
