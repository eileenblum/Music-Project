The dormant self of the veracious lord, dynamically growing with every beat in our heart. The menial vertebrate is coiling inside, jaws unsatisfied, banned till earth is broken and then, with rupturing madness, thee will spit cosmic misery, when he has spoken. The winding mischief cannot await, to be a lacerated faiths humiliating fate. Tusks are hungering, till the order is set 
and in the end they will be painted red. Unlock the abyss, summon thee with the deep red from all veins. Revealed now, in malignance purity. Released, from all earthly chains. Smoke in all incredulous lungs, spit from the chaos-wrath, to the smallest and the greatest. We cast a spell on earth, death, death, death! No incense but sulphuric floats where we are blessed, shall it also guide the moment when infected flesh laid to rest. For his crook is broken, our trident burns plain, for in death and in life, their screams are in vain. Chained and choked in the cycles of tame souls, by that snake or the smoke, through a fire- incarnation without salvation and hope. Unlock the abyss, yet unleash the forbidden core, for they all shall die in our holy 
war.
