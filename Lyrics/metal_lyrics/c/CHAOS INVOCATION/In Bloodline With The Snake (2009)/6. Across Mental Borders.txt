Devoured rushing chaos dwells somewhere inside and it restless burns my eyes and my mind. The sigil of light drives burning in me, devouring, canalizing, exploding out of me. And once again they die, in the shadow of my hysterical face. From beyond all mental borders, they call my name. Canalized power and cruel orders: Murder, murder! Seek silence! Following across all mental borders, I drown myself in the echoes of violence. Devoured rushing chaos is bursting to the outside and it restless burns, my heart and my sight. From the darkest path, to the highest peak and the deepest pulpit, I will eternally follow thee. Obsession glows through my veins; I tear the noxious life from your entrails. Eternally chained to the struts of the darkest shining sign. From night to night I set it free, I have sworn to murder all for thee. Canalized power and cruel orders: Murder, murder! Seek silence! Following across all mental borders, I drown myself in the echoes of violence.
