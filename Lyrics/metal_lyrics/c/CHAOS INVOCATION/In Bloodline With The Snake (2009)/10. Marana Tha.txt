In life and death, in light and dark, with the pulse of a god beats their holy heart. The golden sun reveals as Jaspis in the moment when they die. As eyeless souls on devilwings they will be taken towards the burning sky. Marana tha, a thousand times, calling for a god that never shines. They plead for grace and hell revealed. They plead for death and hell revealed. Marana tha, fulfills the struggling earth, towards Gan Sathanas where all will serve. Death calls, from the eleven angles, from the endless power inside. In death and life, in dark and light, standing in between nothing blinds my sight. The pendulum of doom vibrates through and through, it shakes and bursts worlds in two. The tree of Daath takes root in the causal sphere, its fruits fall and destroy everywhere. The lord is near! The lord is near! The lord is here! Marana tha, a thousand times, calling for a god that eternally shines. His teethes in my flesh, spit poison through me. He wants me to become, his raging behorned son. Marana tha, fulfills the struggling earth, towards Gan Sathanas his will I serve.
