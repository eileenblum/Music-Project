Father, lord of uncreation, thy foetus is hungry! We swallow light, we are the children of the serpent sight. We puke decomposition, we are the children of indisposition. Father, lord of desecration, receiving from thy tongue eternally. In bloodline with the snake, one with the flesh of a world devourer, of luciferian blood and venomous power. Across the endless desert of blood, vomit and fire, we are the satanic seed, the children of the serpentâs heir. In bloodline with the snake, one with the flesh of a world devourer, of luciferian blood and venomous power. Thy poison is spilled into our veins, like wine into a chalice. We believe in the trinity of devotion, abuse and malice. Across the endless desert of blood, vomit and fire, we are the satanic seed the children of the serpentâs heir.
