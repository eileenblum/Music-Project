The horizon eats from the sun, the aura of the infernal one, an angel left never to return a god for those whose soul may burn. The horizon eats from the stars, the firmament covered with scars, the horns of Satan gored every shrine, a world is slaughtered and bleeding devils wine. Visions manifest in an endless nightmare, send from the watchers of the spiritual sphere. A man became the black Messiah and the seer of divine fire. Against the divine variety high upon to the seven shrines of Harmageddon, revelation of such flaming voice, foreseen by him, the one of Satanâs choice. Black fog covers his shape, in the name of the lord he comes to rape. A flaming halo is above his head. He is granted by visions that bring the dead. Give birth, ignite the divine fire upon the earth. Black flame unite the heavens, make them one and same with the underworld. He must invoke the force of Azazel, the horned fire bearer and banished rebel. Witches dance and celebrate his spell soon to paint the walls of hell. Disharmonic melodies, million screams, all that foreseen in his dreams. Golden chalice, devils wine, the end is near, the end of time.
