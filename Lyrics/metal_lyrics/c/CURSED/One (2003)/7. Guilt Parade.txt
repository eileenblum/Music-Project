two thousand years and you've got me convinced it was me that nailed you to that cross. and your friends down here below. they'd like to make me think that it was me who threw the first stone. the fuckup who can never atone. no i wont carry your cross. its not mine to bear. the wholes in your hands are your own. the ones in my head are mine to repair. assualt me with your guilt parade. drag me down with your guilt parade. drag your misery through the streets. make it mine. and tell me when my guilt is enough. sufficient enough to cover the cost (the rising cost) of my salvation in your eyes. your salvation. my damnation. spit blood in the face of your tradition. whos the martyr and whos the roman here in your sick fantasy? who goes first in your guilt parade? whos on first in your guilt parade? be the hero, be the martyr - i'll throw the first stone all over again. bury you. bury you. history will bury you alive. (absolve me)
