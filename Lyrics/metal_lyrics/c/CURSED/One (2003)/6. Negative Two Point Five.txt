got cut, along the line. got cut, and opened wide. and opened wide. and opened wide.
got cut, right where the people come out. took a scalpel to my doubts.
i found the glitch and pulled it out.
diffused the timebomb.
they cut the right wire when they cut the white wire.
with no apologies to hypothetical tragedies.
got cut, one less heart to break. one less mind to rape.
one less victim, one less grave.
you'll never have my eyes. you'll never blame my hands.
one less victim, one less grave.
