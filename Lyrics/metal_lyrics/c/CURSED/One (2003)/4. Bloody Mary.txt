five times in the mirror and there you are. staring dead ahead with the virgins eyes. its tearing me apart. i cant control my actions. and i cant control my thoughts. and when i see the things you've done. it makes me fucking hot. all in crimson. bathed in blood. your secrets burning a hole through my heart. liberties with the flesh. a statue never bled like this. crimes. crimes against the skin. and im both feet in. i know its wrong. i know its wrong now bring it on.
