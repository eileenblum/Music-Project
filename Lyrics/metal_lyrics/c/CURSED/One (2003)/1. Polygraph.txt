the body's been dead not seven days, you've already fucked it a hundred ways.
stiffer than some but more willing than most,
"if this is your idea of some kind of joke..."
you can teach your razorblade a thing or two about suicide.
now cross your heart and wash these sheets,
you're going to wake the whole fucking street.
let's get this thing off the nearest bridge.
and i know you didn't mean to,
sweetheart you never mean to,
i know you never meant to,
but you did.
