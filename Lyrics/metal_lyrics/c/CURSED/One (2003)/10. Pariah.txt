whispered your name in a busy room and everyone stopped talking.
brought you up in a confessional and all the grown men within earshot
lost their faith and walked away, walked away and walked away.
lost their faith and walked away.
so what is it you're not telling me?
oh yeah, this time around, i'm not asking.
and oh, how small this town gets when you start asking for too many names.
so where you've come from and where you're going,
i don't care and i'm not asking.
i'd hit the lights, touch your lips.
you'd turn to dust like all the rest.
