punch the clock and assume the position and never ask for any more. live and die going through there motions and never knowing what the fuck for. turn the dollar. dig the hole deeper. regret as you get another year older. a foot in the grave, a cogin a wheel. bred to be slaves to there ideals. here among the lifeless. the worthless. the hopeless. keep me to tired to think. keep me to fucked to care. but tomorrows another day, thats what the hopeless say.
