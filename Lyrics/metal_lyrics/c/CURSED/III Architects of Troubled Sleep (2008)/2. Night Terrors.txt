Hereâs to the end of another day. Another dream you canât relate. Another stiff that owns your time, with six more ways to split your mind into the dissociated states that pass for survival. Night Terrors, Sum of all the parts. Cold Sweat, Alone in the Dark. Night Terrors. Enemy of Sleep. Cold Sweat. Freedom to Weep. The death toll pornography they feed you all day comes back at night and it comes back in spades. Dead twin in the room staring back at you, with a message from all your tomorrows: âYou Never Get Outâ. Are you hopeless enough? Got problems, now you got problems. And we worked hard to lay them in your path. To keep you just hopeless enough. This sleepwalk on broken legs, modern manâs Dance of Death. Here comes the sun, the Trauma King says âSmile and keep moving, you wonât feel a thingâ. Night Terrors, Sum of all the parts. Cold Sweat, Alone in the Dark. Night Terrors. Enemy of Sleep. Cold Sweat.
