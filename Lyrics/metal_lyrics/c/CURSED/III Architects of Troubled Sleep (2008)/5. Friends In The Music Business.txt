Hit Record âcause itâs all fucking pearls. A bridge-burner to end them all. Donât want to bite the hand that feeds â I want to fucking break it off. When they say âYouâll never work in this town againâ, is that a promise or a threat? Businessmen dressed up like friends, they want to talk about business or friendship. The more confused the better the guilt trip. After all I did for you, donât you owe me this? Sign the paper, sign the paper, This Document Is Legally Blinding. We the undersigned do solemnly swear by The Plan. To break down on every highway from here to Creation. To play the game and sit still for pictures. Howâs your draw? Does it look good on paper? Youâd better be someone? Oh arenât you anyone? Gonna be somebody. We got friends in the music business. Theyâre gonna take care of all the details. So is it business or pleasure? The more confused the better. Donât call me and I wonât call you.
