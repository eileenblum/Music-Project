Prosthetic heroes, didnât die before they got old. Happy days are here again if you missed it the first time around. Golden Ages on our doorstep, Golden Ages at our door again. These days you can live forever. Prosthetic hearts, infinite lives. Reset. Reset, continue. Reach back, raise your dead, never say goodbye. 459 in progress at the Foolâs Hall of Fame. Some artifacts have gone missing, reanimated all the same. Lived long enough to see the day that we could melt their years away. These days you can live forever. Prosthetic hearts, infinite lives. Reset. Reset, continue. Reach back, raise your dead, never say goodbye. All my antiheroes are dead, gone to far-off beds. And I got orders â Do Not Resuscitate. Leave them in the ground, weâve got our own frustrations. These days you can live forever.
