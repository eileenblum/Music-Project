Yellow turns orange as orange turns to red. Thereâs someone in the TV and theyâre fucking with my head. Strings to pull, world to win, whereâs it going to crack? Itâs chaos by numbers with no turning back. Controlled crisis, imagined and real. Hegelâs bastards taking the wheel. Staged chaos, imagined and real. Yellow turns orange as orange turns to red. Up in the control room fucking with your head. Strings to pull, world to win, whereâs it going to crack? Itâs chaos by numbers with no turning back. Live on location, dead on arrival. Head-on collision, no chance of survival. Hegelâs bastards, Orwellâs child. Unchecked headfuck running wild. Give me false hopes and false conclusions, falsely immune from the human condition. Give me leaders with strength and conviction and feed me six oâclock executions every day till the end of time. Controlled crisis, imagined and real. Hegelâs bastards taking the wheel. Staged chaos, imagined and real.Give me the vaguest possible enemy and Iâll fight him to the death.
