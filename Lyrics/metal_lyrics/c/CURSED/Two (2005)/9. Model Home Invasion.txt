When the lights went out you were shoved to the ground.
Power station exploded.
They're all watching it go down.
This is a heatwave.
This is a heatwave.
This is a heatwave.
Someone's gonna get burned.
And all your trust boils down to this:
The neighbor's hands that hold your wrists tight.
Tight.
Tight around your property rights.
Hands on you.
Eyes on you.
Teeth in you in the dark.
The clock has stopped.
No alarm went off.
Remember when you slept with doors unlocked?
Well that was then and this is now.
And this is now.
And this is a heatwave.
Someone's gonna get burned.
Someone always gets burned.
