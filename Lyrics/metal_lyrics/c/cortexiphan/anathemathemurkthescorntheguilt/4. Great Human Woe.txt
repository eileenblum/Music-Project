[Hymn Of Lachrymation]

I'm aching in a lamented sleep (so wakeless it seems)
To my lachrymose heart, I do weep (a downpour for thee)
Thy silhouette plagues every blink my eyes give.
It infuses me agony, along with remorse settles in.
The hospice was saturnine in vibe.
Every aspiration carried a scent of dead skin.
With ardour I caressed down your hair.
So celestially preen it was to the touch.
Now I whisper a lullaby from your favorite tale.
Where children beseech of a realm to be ageless.
As I choked aback tears to console you a smile.
The electrocardiograph descended and rested in a din.
Now it's proven.
This world has no humane equipoise.
Now you're at home in the clouds.
Respiring of only ethereal.
Bedimmed are my eyes to all envisage of thee.
Dear child o' mine, may thou rest in absolute peace.
