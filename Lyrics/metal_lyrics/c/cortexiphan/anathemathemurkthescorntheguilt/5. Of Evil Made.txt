[Hymn Of Blasphemation]

"O' Lord bore of horns, I hereby kneel before thee.
To quench thy relish for lecherous needs.
Offering is a virgin bathed in sanguinary.
Here have I succumbed, harbor me now to succeed!"
That night a sacrilegious rite achieved.
Manifestation has taken form to a body of malice.
Empowered with blood flown devilry.
A ravenous being did rebirth.
"O' Lord bore of horns, I hereby kneel before thee.
To quench thy relish for lecherous needs.
Offering is a virgin bathed in sanguinary.
Here have I succumbed, harbor me now to succeed!"
On ravish she disembowels clean.
What steamingly resided within.
Obsequious to an urge ever relentless to be quelled.
Enticing through coquetry, scented victims has she smelt.
BONES SHALL SPLINTER! INNARDS SHALL STREW!
Butcher their bodies, asphyxiate them in blood.
Harmonize their screams terminal from their hearts.
