[Hymn Of Subjugation]

O mother hostile, thy once barren womb now blooms.
Spawn incessantly teeming ov us.
To bring forth this planet's doom.
To the weak and the bleak.
We prowl with scorn 'pon their brood.
Their chestwork therein implant to vilely reproduce.
Boundless our existence to all biblical hold.
Thy God's shallowness, clarifies and unfolds.
Sanctum walls in thee, secrete to roaches bold.
Yield us now as Lord! of eyes mercilessly cold!
Spawn incessantly teeming ov us.
Doom!
Doom!
