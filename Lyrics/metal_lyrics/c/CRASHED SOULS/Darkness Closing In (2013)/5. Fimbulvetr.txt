Slowly crawling across the land
You can't hide from my hand
My searching fingers
Will finally touch you for sure

Your last harvest youâve reaped
Across the land I now creep
Iâm the herald for the end

Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr

Land by land I will cover
Under my cold ân deadly cloak
Nevermore will the trees bear fruit
In these dead and barren lands

Your last harvest youâve reaped
Across the land I now creep
Iâm the herald for the end

Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr

For three long years Iâll reign
Three long years of suffering
And then the end will come
The end called twilight of the Gods

Your last harvest youâve reaped
Across your land I now creep
Iâm the herald for the end

Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr
Iâm Fimbulvetr
