At night time you always come to me
I hope that I one time you will see
Traceless you disappear
But I know that you were here

I hear, I hear â my Shadow Friend
I feel, I feel â my Shadow Friend
I fear, I fear â my Shadow Friend
Can you be or am I insane?

Please show yourself donât say no
Why are you here to haunt me so
You hide in the darkness here
Just to feed my inner fear

I hear, I hear â my Shadow Friend
I feel, I feel â my Shadow Friend
I fear, I fear â my Shadow Friend
Can you be or am I insane?

Round and round and up and down
All the time Iâm loosing ground
A flicker in the corner of my eye
Breathless in cold sweat I lie

I hear, I hear â my Shadow Friend
I feel, I feel â my Shadow Friend
I fear, I fear â my Shadow Friend
Can you be or am I insane?
