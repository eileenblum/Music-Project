It could be any day

Walking down the same old street
The neighbourâs dog barks at you
See the kids playing down the alley
Wondering whatâs for dinner today

Each day is another step ahead
Each choice decides your life
Will it be long and prosperous?
Or will it end in a sudden
Tragic death

It could be any day

Driving your way home from work
The boss been busting your ass all day
Picking up a fag from your purse
Need a smoke to calm you down

Each day is another step ahead
Each choice decides your life
Will it be long and prosperous?
Or will it end in a sudden
Tragic death

It could be any day

Following the sirens down the street
The horror builds as you just know
Your love lies under the wheels
Someoneâs mind were elsewhere

Each day is another step ahead
Each choice decides your life
Will it be long and prosperous?
Or will it end in a sudden
Tragic death
