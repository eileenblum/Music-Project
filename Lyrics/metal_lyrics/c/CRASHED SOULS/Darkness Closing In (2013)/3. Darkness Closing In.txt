As grey clouds that darken the sky
An autumn rain that falls so cold
You comes rumbling over me
And makes me cold at heart
Makes my heart freeze to ice

No will to speak, no will to live
The darkness closing in on me
No time for joy, no time for me
Society suffocates me

Like a cancer, spreading globally
An illness that take land by land
Born of mankindâs greed
Make us slaves to the machine
Make us slaves to the machine

No will to speak, no will to live
The darkness closing in on me
No time for joy, no time for me
Society suffocates me

Globalization, have a sick twist to me
Rationalization breaks us down one by one
Efficiency stamped in our foreheads
Donât you think that you are irreplaceable

Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me - I feel trapped, I canât breath
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me - Insanity, builds in me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me - Please stay away, leave me be
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocates me
Societyâ¦suffocatesâ¦me!
