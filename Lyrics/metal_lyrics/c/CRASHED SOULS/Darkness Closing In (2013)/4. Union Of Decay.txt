Walking down the street seeing nothing but fear
The sound of broken glass is all we can hear
Walking through decay and houses on fire
Watching all the flames getting higher and higher

We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay
We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay

We are here to spread the powers of darkness
A powerful source of hatred and death
People on their knees begging for mercy
But from the darkness no-one escapes

We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay
We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay

We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay
We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay

Now we are done here, the cityâs in ruin
Destroy all the good and only evil remain
Moving through cities like wind in the autumn
You better watch out when weâre coming for you

We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay
We are destroyers and we have the power
We are the union of decay
