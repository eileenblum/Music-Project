Endless age so desolate
Kingless realm so desperate
Throneless rule of nothing
Blade cracked in defeat
This is nothing
Realm of nothing
We are all nothing
You are nothing
All this is infinite

We rot inside of it

Arise to bleakest vista
All suffer here
what cannot kill us?
what will not save us?
Crawl to a dead conclusion
Unending Failure
Grasp onto emptiness
The land of dead hope
All this is infinite

We rot inside of it
