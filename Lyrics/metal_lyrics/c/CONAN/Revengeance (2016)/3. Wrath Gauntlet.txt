Hold aloft the book of deadly quests
Select the path of least resistance
Mystic powers of the wilderness
Raining down upon the evilness
Reign of fire from a hand of steel
With deadly bow and fleet of heel
Axe like a hammer crushing foes
Armoured hide and shield deflecting blows
To the quest a team of four are bound
Deadly hordes of rotten death are found
All swept aside with deadly force
No hesitation no remorse
YOU'RE NEXT!
