Winter fell white
And covered me with its frost
And the light takes
The robe of the shivering tears
Once the night came
And all thoughts were drowned in white
I was nowhere
Nowhere to be found
Binding your hopes
While the snow is still here
Bring me your thoughts
To keep them forevermore
Bring me your pain
To keep it inside of me
Let me take you far from this cold and grief
I will find a way
To come to you
I will find a way to keep you near
I gave my heart away
