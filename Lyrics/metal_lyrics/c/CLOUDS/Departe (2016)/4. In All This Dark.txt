I could see all your despair
I could try to bring you closer
Past these walls I only surrender
And I'll know I won't escape
I'll leave this world and I'll come to find you
When nothing's there to bring me back
How will I know what lies behind us
How could I see in all this dark?
No reason, no hope
And the air I breathe stains my lungs
The sleepless mind surrounded by
Nothing
The air I breathe pains my lungs
The hours stop by
Your voiceless soul
Hurts my heart
The wait, the memories
But there's no one there
No hope for those who are lost
