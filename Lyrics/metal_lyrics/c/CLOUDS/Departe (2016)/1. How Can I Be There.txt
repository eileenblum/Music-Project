Silence moving away from your form
Silent night closing in in your soul
Everlasting memories to drown
Endless nightmares to follow you
When you cannot wake
Pure life, entiwined in all these tears
How can I understand?
Real life, without you by my side
How can I wake up?
And though i wished
To turn the hands of time
How can I understand?
And though I wished
To bring you here again
How can I wake up?
How can I be there
To kneel when i need you
How can I be there
Just to see me for long as to who I am
Departing
How can I be there
Just to see my anguish
How can I be there
Just to see me longing one more time
Departing
How can I be there
For long for everything
For the years that i've lost just to be with you
Departing
How can I be there
Just to see my anguish
How can I be there
Just to see me suffer one last time
Departing
Though I wished and though i tried
I will bring you back again
Though I wished and though I tried
I will be for you right here
And though i wished
To turn the hands of time
How can I understand?
And though I wished
To bring you here again
How can I wake up?
