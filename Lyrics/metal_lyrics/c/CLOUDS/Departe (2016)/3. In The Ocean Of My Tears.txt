So much I've lost
In cheerless life
So much pain and suffering behind
It's time to step aside
I used to think that I can fall
But now I see how fragile was I
How slashed all inside
It's time to step aside
It's time to leave this place
Here I am empty and alone
I gave my heart I gave my all
And now the bridge between two worlds is broken
The starless night that covers me
Softly whispering my name
Carry me away
And wash my sins
In the ocean of my tears
