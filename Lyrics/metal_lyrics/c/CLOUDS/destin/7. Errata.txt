As nightmares,lonely thoughts
In sorrow weld
And the dreams befold
Tales of the old of
No more enchanted souls.

Far beyond this world
im dreaming the Earth
Fallen from grace - deceiving

In was the same old grief
it was the same mistake
it was my only weakness

It was my own weakness
It was my own mistake
Hold on to your only fate
Hold on to your despair

Far beyond this world
im dreaming the Earth
Fallen from grace - deceiving.

In was the same old grief
it was the same mistake
it was my only weakness
