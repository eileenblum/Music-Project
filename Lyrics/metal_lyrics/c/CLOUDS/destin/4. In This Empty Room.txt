Shield, wallsâ¦despair and distant
The rain falls in my eyes and covers all I had
All I have wished to find, once more
Has been taken from me
The light came or through the shadows falsely seen
Is this the end of my misery?
All of eternity, I could have spent with you
In this empty room with endless faith
But how useless sorrow would be?
Without memories
Without all the tears I shared for you?
Now all of eternity, I will spend to mourn for you
To this empty room with endless shame
But how useless sorrow would feel?
Without memories
Without all the things I felt for you
Hope yet perished
All I've lost is chasing me... now
So blind from your grief
How can I see the light to escape?
Please take my hand and follow me
I cannot bare to be alone
Please take my hand
And hold me
Take me away, away from this world
All of eternity, I could have spent with you
In this empty room with endless faith
But how useless sorrow would be?
Without memories
Without all the tears I shared for you?
Now all of eternity, I will spend to mourn for you
To this empty room with endless shame
But how useless sorrow would feel?
Without memories
Without all the things I felt for you
Hope yet perished
And vanished away from the clouds
You broke your vows to me
And left me behind
In Despair
