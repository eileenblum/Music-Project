How many nightmares i'll have
How will I continue this life
And how will i get there
When this road is so blind
Old are these roads that i walk
Where are you so guide me once more
Where are those lights and
Will they be there for me again
Burning tides
Once i left you far behind
The truth was not there to die
I died
A million times by now
I kept the flame alive
Soul denied
I run towards those lights
I cry in vain
No one can deny
Crushing your will
Scorning your way
The hour remains lonely
We are nothing but a name
Entwined - nothing but a name
