Towards the scars that I left
on your forever whitened veil
Towards the endless flame
burning with this deepened pain
All your sorrows will be gone
with the morning tide
For another day

I'll be your guide
through these nightmares
I'll lose myself
for one moment in time
I'll find a way to awaken
All these wounds won't heal
Never

Towards the scars that I left
on your forever whitened veil
Towards the endless flame
burning with this deepened pain
All your sorrows will be gone
with the morning tide
For another day

Throughout all these fields of nothingness
I should curse the day I left all my hopes
and all my dream behind...
