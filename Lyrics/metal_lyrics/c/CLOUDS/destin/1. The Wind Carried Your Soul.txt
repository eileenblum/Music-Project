In all this fading pulse
All our waning pulse
Waning soul
Our lapse - exhausting
Only able to rethink
And trace
The meaning of loss.
One day forgotten
One life absorbed by grief
One soul carried carried away
One moment and it's all gone
Still i try to see the names
On wind's enchanted wings
Still i try to breathe
And trace the meaning of Loss
