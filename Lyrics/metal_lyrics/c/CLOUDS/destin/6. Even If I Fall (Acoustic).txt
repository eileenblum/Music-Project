If I should turn
The hands of time
To see the light
If all these nightmares would stop
I would come to life
Departed yet so close to me
You are
Left in this mute agony
To dwell
With hands folded in prayer
To see the light
Disheartened and alone
Awaiting to be called
To hear your voice
Even if I fall
I'm bound to feel the flames
Of pain and sorrow
I'm torn and I'm ashamed
I couldn't do more
If all these nightmares would stop
I would come to life
Break the shadows into the light
If I fall
Even if I fall
Even if I fall
Even if I fall
Even if I fall
