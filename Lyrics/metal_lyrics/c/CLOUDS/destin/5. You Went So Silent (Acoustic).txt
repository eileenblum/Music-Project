You went so silent
You went so alone
You went in darkness
You took all this life
Holding back
What I missed
And all I had to do
Eternally
Bound to you
More and broken
It burns inside myself
The poison
Coming back to stay
For this moment
Is torn
The pain
Coming back for more
In my head
Alone and stranded
Walking
Whispering moments
Before
This scene is devoted
To none
Whispering moments
Inside my head
Alone
You went silent
