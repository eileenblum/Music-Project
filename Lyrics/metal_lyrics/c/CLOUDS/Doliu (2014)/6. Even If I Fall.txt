if i should turn 
the hands of time
to see the light 
if all these nightmares would stop
i would come to life 
departed yet so close to me
you are 
left in this mute agony
to dwell 
with hands folded in prayer
to see the light 
disheartened and alone
awaiting to be called 
to hear your voice
even if I fall 
Iâm bound to feel the flames
of pain and sorrow
Iâm torn and Iâm ashamed
I couldnât do more 
if all these nightmares would stop
I would come to life 
break the shadows into the light
if I fall
(even if I fall)
(even if I fall)
(even if I fall)
(even if I fall)
