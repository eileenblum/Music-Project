shapes 
silent and static 
thereâs nothing here but the white 
it scares me to close my eyes 
this is not how I dreamed 
itâs not how I had hoped 
let me scream 
I canât even speak 
my mind is a storm 
my body is a void 
and all who enter now 
(return to white) 
must fall past this heart 
(there are no sides) 
bound in the flow 
(only direction) 
that slowly bleeds ahead 
(and destination) 
to where silence is king 
pain will be no more 
touch will be no more 
fear will be no more 
love will be no more
