i fled the place 
where i once sat
in dreams of hope 
and tears of joy
i threw the key 
to life itself
i spat the book 
and blamed the sky
i couldnt care 
oh heavens above
or heavens below 
please take me there
I cannot bare I cannot live 
oh earth please welcome me
take me away from this world 
it is shattered and cold
oh thorns 
entangle me with frost
torn and lost in this 
world oh so cold
and empty 
sorrowfolds me well
