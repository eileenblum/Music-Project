bring forth this darkness 
bring me all despair l
eave me here in nothingness and 
walk further into 
further into time and see 
the only thing i found 
near to the sun 
near to pain and grief 
(heaven was) 
blind to my grief 
so blind 
and even though i asked 
heaven was blind 
blind to my grief... 
(heaven was) 
blind to my grief 
so blind 
and even though i asked 
heaven was blind 
blind to my grief...
