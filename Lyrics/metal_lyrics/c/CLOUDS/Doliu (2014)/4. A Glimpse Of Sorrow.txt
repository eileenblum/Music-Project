in nocturnal slumber
dreams appear through eyes of the dead
tossing and turning drenched in sweat
hazy visions flashing through your head
cardiac arrhythmiayou are lost for breath
no recollection where this originates
are these images of your fate?
trapped within your mind
no chance to be freed
blackened thoughts and demonâs seed 
lost at night overwhelmed by truth or lies
crimson tears they fall from dying eyes 
like swimming in a sea without a shore
it feels like walking into a closed door 
in nocturnal slumber
dreams appear through eyes of the dead 
tossing and turning, drenched in sweat
hazy visions flashing through your head 
cardiac arrhythmia, you are lost for breath
no recollection where this originates 
are these images of your fate?
trapped within your mind 
No chance to be freed
blackened thoughts and demonâs seed 
lost at night, overwhelmed by truth or lies
the crimson tears they fall, they fall from dying eyes 
like swimming in a sea without a shore
it feels like walking into a closed door 
all hope is lost, there is no tomorrow
when asleep there is only a glimpse of sorrow 
only a glimpse of sorrow
