you went so silent
you went so alone
you went in darkness 
you took all this life 
holding back 
what I missed 
and all I had to do 
eternally
bound to you 
more and broken
it burns inside myself 
the poison
coming back to stay
for this moment
is torn
the pain 
coming back for more
in my head
alone and stranded 
walking
whispering moments
before 
this scene is devoted 
to none 
whispering moments 
inside my head 
alone 
you went silent
