When you see your face in the mirror
Does it seem the end is gettin' nearer
All your life you spent as a wheeler
Now the hole you dug, it gettin' deeper

You're talkin' words
But they don't make the rhyme
You'll lose it all
Cause you can't draw the line

You got nothin'
Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin'

When you see the day gettin' darker
You can run to yuor lies, run to your cover
When you feel the heat from a lover
You hit the highway lookin' for another

You made the grade
You left the hills behind
You take the the cake and eat it
You're so blind

You got nothin'
Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin', hey

Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin', hey

Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Nothin' for nothin', hey

Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
Nothin' for nothin'
And we don't need your kind
Nothin' for nothin'
Pushin', shovin', got no time
Hey
You're hurtin' overtime
