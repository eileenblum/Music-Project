Growing up as a young boy
Sometimes can be rough
At six years old I was thinkin'
Seven would be just enough
But I was wrong
Ooo I was wrong yea
Ten years old and I'm growin'
Thinkin' I got it sussed
Mama said you'll be a fine young man
I thought I already was
But I was wrong
Ooo I was wrong

Cause when you get where you're going
The road's still long

Eighteen years I'm a rebel
Thinkin' I'm pretty tough
Daddy said you got a lot to learn
I thought that I'd learned enough
But I was wrong
Ooo I was wrong yea
Twenty-five was a good time
Comin' into my own
Climbed the mountain
And I reached for the sky
I thought that I had it all
But I was wrong
Ooo I was wrong

Cause when you get where you're going
The road's still long When you get where you're going
The road's still long

They all try to tell you
But who are they to say
Cause the best things that you learn
You find out on your way
No time for feelin' sorry
Just time for being strong
When you get where your going
The road's still long

Now I see where I come from
Now I see where I am
Now I see that you never really know
So you just gotta do the best you can
And that ain't wrong
Ooo that ain't wrong no
Cause when you get where you're going
The road's still long
When you get where you're going
The road's still long
When you get where you're going yea
