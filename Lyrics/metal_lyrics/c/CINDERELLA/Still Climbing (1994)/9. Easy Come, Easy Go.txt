I'm running free
But I ain't got no time to fly
And I can see
But tomorrow maybe I'll be blind
I met a man with a cup
Looking pretty beat up
He stared straight into my eyes
He said today you may be rich
But tomorrow you'll be poor
And the next day you could die

I said it's easy come
And it's easy go
Don't go cryin' on my shoulder
Cause I won and lost more than you could know
I always find a way
To make it through another day
Cause when all you got's your pride
Ain't nobody gonna take it away

I'm movin' fast
Always feelin' two steps behind
Forget the past
If it's the only way to ease my mind
Some fortune telling lady
With her face a little crazy
Stared straight into my eyes
She said I'd love to help you son
But this one you can't out run
I sure as hell can give it a try

Cause it's easy come
And it's easy go
Don't go cryin' on my shoulder
Cause I won and lost more than you could know
I always find a way
To make it through another day
Cause when all you got's your pride
Ain't nobody gonna take it away

Take it one breath at a time
Cause we're all just walking the line
I'll be doin' just fine
When tomorrow's out of sight and out of mind

Cause it's easy come
And it's easy go
Don't go cryin' on my shoulder
Cause I won and lost more than you could know
I always find a way
To make it through another day
Cause when all you got's your pride
Ain't nobody gonna take it away, yea
Cause it's easy come
And it's easy go
