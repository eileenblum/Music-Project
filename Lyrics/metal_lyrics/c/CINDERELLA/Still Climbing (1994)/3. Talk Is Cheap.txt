YouÂ¹re wearin out
your welcome wagon
Scraped ya up to drag ya
Home on the range you got the flame
So now you suck some honeys
Comb your hair get out of bed
And wash your face, now look youÂ¹re all
Alone in your room you feel the gloom
So now you curse the day youÂ¹re
Sorry you missed the boat
Sorry thatÂ¹s all she wrote
I donÂ¹t wanna hear it
Mm you talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
I donÂ¹t wanna hear it
T-T-Talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
You talk of love and hope someday
You wonÂ¹t be feeling so
Neglected, all your promises
And now you turn to me and scream
ItÂ¹s hectic at the bottom
And itÂ¹s lonely at the top, so run to
MommyÂ¹s always waitin
But this time she blew her top,
you say youÂ¹re
Sorry you missed the boat
Sorry thatÂ¹s all she wrote
I donÂ¹t wanna hear it
Mm your talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
I donÂ¹t wanna hear it
T-T-Talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
I donÂ¹t wanna hear it
Ah your talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
I donÂ¹t wanna hear it
T-T-Talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
Sorry you missed the boat
Sorry thatÂ¹s all she wrote
I donÂ¹t wanna hear it
Mm your talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
I donÂ¹t wanna heart it
T-T-Talk is cheap
I donÂ¹t wanna know
