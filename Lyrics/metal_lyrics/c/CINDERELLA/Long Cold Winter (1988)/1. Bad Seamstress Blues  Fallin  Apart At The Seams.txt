Bad seamstress blues
Alright
Lookin' on back when I was young
I tried to sing it, but my song had been sung
And now I ain't got no worries
Ain't got no one to call my own
I said but when I got just a little bit older
All I got had come undone
Let's go boys

Fallin' apart at the seams
Ah yea
Old man looks much younger now
He lost his strength respect somehow
Look in the mirror at what I found
It's just the past and it's over now
Ooo it's over now
Ooo it's over now

My heart's like a wheel
And my head's just a stone
I got my memories
Ain't got no home

I'm fallin'
Ooo fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
Ooo yea fallin' apart at the seams

Old friends seem much closer now
They stand the test of time somehow

Look at the winner who hit the ground
It comes around and then it goes back down

Ooo it's over now
Ooo it's over now
My heart's like a wheel
And my head's just a stone
I got no memories
Ain't got no home

I'm fallin'
Ooo fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
Ooo yea fallin' apart at the seams

My heart's like a wheel
And my head's just a stone
I got my memories
Ain't got no home

I'm fallin'
Ooo fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
Ooo yea fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
I'm fallin' fallin'
Fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
Ooo yea ooo yea
Whoa yea
