Everybody needs a little place they can hide
Somewhere to call their own 
Don't let nobody inside
Every now and then we all need to let go
For some it's a doctor, for me it's rock and roll

For some it's a bottle
For some it's a pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's givin' them a thrill

I was one to figure if they don't like what they see
If you live in a glass house don't be throwing rocks at me

[Chorus]
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper to get us by
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper ohhh and it'll be alright

Check out Mr. Politician in his suit and tie
But when the doors are closed there ain't nothing he won't try
Meanwhile Mr. Medicine's treating his best friend's wife

Tipper led the war against the record industry
She said she saw the devil on her MTV
To look into the cabinet it takes more than a key
Just like Jimmy's skeleton's and his ministry

[Chorus]

For some it's a needle for some it's pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's giving them a thrill
You can spend your money before you get your pay
With a toss of the dice you can piss it all away

[Chorus]
