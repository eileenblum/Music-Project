When I was young, old man sat me on his knee
he told me if I had a dream, I could be what I wanna be
Now life goes on a voice echos in the wind
it's telling me to carry on, now I know that it's him

[Chorus:]
he said whoa, watch out boy 
don't go messin with your life cause it ain't no toy
Lord help ya to carry life's load
it could all pass you by down on dead man's road

Now I got a good woman 
ya know she's looking out for me
and if I get a little blind ya know she helps me to see
but I gotta keep runnin' because they're catching up to me
I think I hear that voice again, this time it says to me

[Chorus:]
he said whoa, watch out boy 
don't go messin with your life cause it ain't no toy
Lord help ya to carry life's load
it could all pass you by down on dead man's road

[Instrumental]

when I was young old man sat me on his knee
he told me if I had a dream I could be what I wanna be
now life goes on a voice echos in the wind
it's telling me to carry on now I know that it's him

[Chorus:]
he said whoa, watch out boy 
don't go messin with your life cause it ain't no toy
Lord help ya to carry life's load 
don't you let it pass you by down on dead man's road

[Repeat Chorus]
