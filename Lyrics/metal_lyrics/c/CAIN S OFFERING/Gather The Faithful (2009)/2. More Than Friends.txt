We're more than friends
We areï»¿ like lovers
Two souls in one
Forever entwined
I feel with your skin
You live off my heart's beat
Warm me within
While tending my wounds

Miles still divide
The distance between us
Keeps growing still
And hope is a lie
And every night
We share the same dream
That's where we hide
You and I

You have always been
Much more than friend to me
And I could neverï»¿ hope
To find another one
Now the time is right
Just tell me what to sacrifice
For you tonight

Wake me with the sound of your heartbeat through silence
If I'm an offering good enough for you
Or let me slumber deeper and deeper.
Forever I'm waiting for you.

Would you hate me if I crossed that line from wanting toï»¿ "why"?
Alone I'm tonight.
Tell me if I'm alive or just breathing
For I cast no shadow when I'm alone.

You have always been much more than a friend to me
You were always much so more than a friend should be

Wake me with the sound of yourï»¿ heartbeats in silence
If I'm an offering good enough for you
Or let me slumber deeper and deeper
Forever I'm waiting for you
Just call my name and I'll be there
Forever I'm waiting for you

You have always been much more than a friend to me
You were always so much more than a friend should be

Wake me with the sound of your heartbeats through silence
If I'm an offering good enough for you
Or let me slumber deeper and deeper
Forever I'm awaiting for you
Wake me with the sound ofï»¿ your heart's beats in silence
If I'm an offering good enough for you
Just call my name and I'll be there
Forever I'm awaiting for you
