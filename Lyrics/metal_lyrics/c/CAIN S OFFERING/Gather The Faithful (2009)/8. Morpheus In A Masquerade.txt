One more night, one more before I shall wither and die
Grant me just one more life, one more, I need it to make this thing right
The more that I gave the less I received, it's all for them and none for me
I am unworthy to be sacrificed, I'm such a tragic comic

Doing the dance and singing the songs
I'm Morpheus in a masquerade
The orchard of sins I have held deep within
I will burn down for you

One more night for me to turn into what I've portrayed
Call me by my true name one more time, one more before it's too late
It's not their ovations that I so adore, it's your shrine I kneel before
You were my beginning and you'll be my end, my lover and my friend

There in the dark you have always been wailing
Waiting for me to return back home
Hold on to me when the ballroom has emptied
Last cadence faded

Dark is the road that now lies before me
Twisting the path to that empty house where
Evil lurks in every darkened room just waiting for you

Liars and the martyrs, I've got dreams to auction
Devil can you hear me, I've got souls to sell
Sinner or a saint - for me it's all the same
I have grown so tired of this masquerade

My ray of hope, where are you now when I need you the most
You are the child of love, and you are all I've been longing for

Let your morning fail upon me, let the nighttime fade away
Bestow on me forgiveness and let me live for another day
On this ground I've made my bed, and in it I will lay
Born at evenfall, now old and gray

I'm Morpheus please dance with me, as always you can take the lead and
Guide me through the waltz of life, sailing through the seas of night
I'm Morpheus please caress me, hold my heart too weak to beat
For I'm not sure I want to see what you're going to show to me tonight

A silhouette of a broken man standing by the shoreline
He turns around and I can see it's me
Standing where the ocean touched the sand
This little boy has grown to be a man, let me be the best I can

Take me where the clouds caress the horizon
Where all I'll hear is whisper of the wind
A mothers womb, a soothing song once more
And the star I used to wish upon, so long ago

One moment, unbroken, my heart will be wide open
For someone, for no one, cast to the wind my ashes

Here I stand, naked and ashamed, I've been stripped down to the bone
The emperors new clothes that no one here can see, yet no one cares to say
But it's good enough for me, abandoned and forsaken by my
Imaginary friends
They all leave me alone so I can I doubt my existence
For in the end I don't even know who I am

I've shifted shape so many times I've forgotten which one's mine
So sick and tired of being sick and tired
My quest for immortality has made me so much more human that
I ever wished to be
My love, save me
