Once long ago I was young and naive
I dared to hope and I dared to dream
Once long ago lights were brighter for me
This world was mine to keep

I traveled so far defying the dawn
Just to see where this road leads
My foolish hunt, unbroken unscarred was whole
...and then there was you.

Once long a go I felt lost without you
And life had lift me high and dry
Once long ago didn't know what to do
Alone inside my mind

So far away, from where I'm today
No one could reach my heart
Until the day my darkness fade away
And into the blue

Out of the darkness and into the blue
Still broken and scarred but I'm over you
For every scar and every tear that falls
Means I'm healing

Where are you now, are you thinking of me?
When you look in the mirror, what do you see?
The burden you bear and the secret you keep
Reminding you endlessly

I've been broken for a while
But I'm not missing you

Out of the darkness and into the blue
Still broken and scarred, but I'm over you
For every scar and every tear that falls
Means I'm healing

Out of the darkness; into the blue
where you don't want me and I don't need you
Thou I'm down and thou I'm torn apart
I'm still breathing

Out of the darkness and into the blue
where you don't want me and I don't need you
Thou I'm down and thou I'm torn apart
My heart's beating
