A twisted sense of irony in the way your constant
Lack of sympathy has turned me so hopeless, so heartless
Gethsemane open for me tonight, I'll pray for the last time.
For you and for me and our ordinary lives, ordinary lies.
My pain, redefined like an unwelcome guest arrives just to remind me.

I'm there for you if you'd still want me to, for after all I'm yours to keep.
Just come to me, I'm waiting with my wounds wide open.

Pour your salt into these wounds and watch me crawl.
Tell me to take it like a man, show me my place,
Hurt me just because you can.

Though now it hurts like hell it is better to feel just something else
Than live in that uncertainty, so tell me now, how was he and tell me was he worth it
An ounce of peace is all I want,
A solemn haven for the torn and tired one, downcast wayward son.
Can't crawl out of my hole,
So I'll make it my home,
While wise enough to dig no more.

Trying to wash off the pain stain, don't fill my heart with your disdain.
Why can't you see, a leap without faith is what you ask of me.

You pour your salt into my wounds and watch me crawl.
Tell me to take it like a man, show me my place,
Hurt me just because you can.

Take me in then tell me you hate me,
Breathe with me, make love to me until I bleed.
How does it feel to know that you can break me?

And I guess I'd forgive if I would not look weak
And I knew that you'd give yourself to me
Though the wound is too deep I would give everything
If I could just be the object of your desire

Silently you stood there before me
Violently unveiling your sin and your deceit
You said to me "Love is only beautiful when it bleeds"

Pour your salt into these wounds and watch me crawl
Tell me to take it like a man, show me my place
Hurt me just because you can
