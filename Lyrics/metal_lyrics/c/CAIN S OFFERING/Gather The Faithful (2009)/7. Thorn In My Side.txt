I did not hear the warning, I did not see the signs
You're the master of illusion, you're the devil in disguise
Temptress in lace and leather, you made me lose control
One sinful night and I just lost my heart and lost my soul

I was the one to hold you, but not the only one
I hear you say you're sorry hut some things cannot be undone
I tried so hard to forgive, tried so hard to forget
I tried to understand but it s too late to make amends

Don't come here asking for forgiveness for the things you've done
Don't point your finger at me because you're the fallen one

Thorn in my side, forever haunting me
You're my fantasy for the night, please stay here close to me
I'll play the clown, you strike me down again

Still searching for my pieces, still so out of control
One piece is always missing and I don't know how to fill that hole
Still I don't know the answer, or what the question is
Don't know how we got here but I don't want it to end like this

Thorn in my side, forever haunting me
You're my fantasy for the night, please stay here close to me
I'll play the clown you strike me down again

Still I want to touch you, still I long to hold you
Still I need to feel you right here by my side

And still I cannot have you, still you are too wild and free.
And still I cannot accept that you are not meant for me

Thorn in my side, forever haunting me
You're my fantasy for the night, please stay here close to me

Still I want to touch you, still I long to hold you
Still I need to feel you right here by my side
