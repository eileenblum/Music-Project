My lady of pain, I always come without a warning
And tear your little heart apart
Every mistake and every tear that's ever fallen
Each and every one wears my name

Don't place your hopes on me for I'm going to let you down
I am better left alone, please leave my loneliness unbroken

The charm of stolen waters
A virgin heart on the palm of my hand
My only true redeemer
The only thing I still can feel

Keep your distance, don't come too close or I will hurt you
Even though I don't want to

(just run...)

So hard to make a stand when all I'd ever ask for
Still leaves this hunger unsatisfied
Still I miss the morning dew, still I crave for the warming sun
Temptation too powerful, it breaks my will and leaves me chained

The charm of stolen waters
A virgin heart on the palm of my hand
One fragile passing moment
Just one more dream that did not last

Her angel wings now broken
I've become the face of misery
Door to her heart too open
In silence I just watch her bleed

Innocent stare, young heart so unaware
Falling for every tie, you will be mine tonight
Naked and tied, stripped of all pride
Betrayal of hearts in frail moonlight

Hold me closer, pray that this night's never over
Fear me, so near me. I am so close yet so far away

Don't place your hopes on me for I'm going to let you down
I am better left alone, please leave my loneliness unbroken
The charm of stolen waters
A virgin heart on the palm of my hand
One fragile passing moment
Just one more dream that did not last

Her angel wings now broken
I've become the face of misery
Door to her heart too open
In silence I just watched her bleed
