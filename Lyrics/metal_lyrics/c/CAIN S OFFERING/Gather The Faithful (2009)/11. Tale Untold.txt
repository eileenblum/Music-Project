[Japanese Bonus Track]Share a tale with me,
Our days that would come,
And all that was meant to be,
Down the isle you'd walk to meet me.

Your snow-white veil was stained in red.
On the eve of our love, the first day, the rest of our lives.
Now gone forever, and ever.
Only the lonely keep hanging onto a dream.

[Chorus:]
I'll keep your memories safe with me,
We are un-finished symphony.
But cruel twist of fate,
Our tale was left untold.

I made mistakes, one too many.
Grant me hope, if you've got any.
Burn away the hurt that haunts me
Let me be the light, in silence re-unite.

Save a smile for me,
After all that went wrong,
And all that has come to be,
Our little piece is all a broken china.

So, let the days come, let the days go.
Fade away, hide away,
Our every little lie, every little crime.
Every bit a memory, melody, silently they come to me.

[Chorus]

I made mistakes, one too many.
Grant me hope, if you've got any.
Burn away the hurt that haunts me
Let me be the light, in silence re-unite.

[Solo]

The song of the sirens still calling.
And my eye's are still open wide.
If I lose you tonight, tell me,
Have I then lost you, forever?

Darling, save me a seat from your chamber,
Raise your hammer, and forge me a-new.
You're my virgin, undone.
I'm the crest-fallen one, and I need you.

[Chorus]

No more mistakes, not a single one.
Just one more thing remains to be done.

One love had joined together, has now got put a-sunder,
For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer,
In sickness, in health, to love and to cherish,
Let God do us apart.
