Silence is broken
Empty words arc licking the layers of sin from our skin
We realize happy endings are not for everyone, they're not for us
Break of dawn let us lay down our arms
In the end of the day we can savour our loss
But I never stopped trying and I never said I wasn't up for

A little bit of pain
A little bit of longing
Little bit of love to come our way
A little bit of fear
A little bit of hate
Little hope for the hopeless

A little bit of rain
A little bit of thunder
Little broken smile at the end of our day
A little stormy cloud
A little bit of wind
To breathe life into lifeless

You were always so much stronger than me
And now your pain has made you beautiful
But inside your armour is your heart still open, for here I stand
Still trapped in my solitary shell
Reaching out to you with my aching thoughts
Hear me now, please don't tell me that you are too proud for

A little bit of pain
A little bit of longing
Little bit of love to come our way
A little bit of fear
A little bit of hate
Little hope for the hopeless

A little bit of rain
A little bit of thunder
Little broken smile at the end of our day
A little stormy cloud
A little bit of wind
To breathe life into lifeless

Just give yourself to me
Together we will be
So elegantly broken
