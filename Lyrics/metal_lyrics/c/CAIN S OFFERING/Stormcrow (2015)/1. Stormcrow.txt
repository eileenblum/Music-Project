Rising from the ashes
A Dark messenger of sorrow
I'm the stormcrow

Heaven and hell
Entwined in a dance that you know so well
Your pleasure and pain
They are my domain
They're where I reign

You've been waiting for me
In your denial it's hard to see
Addicted to pain, your life is a cage
And your heart is the stage

Where I'll play my symphony so vile
Your life it will never be the same
The storm will rise again and
You'll see too late I am all that you hate

Rising from the ashes
A Dark messenger of sorrow
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe

Cruel wings of destruction
Harbringer of you downfall
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe

I am your Cain
The pain that will brng you down to you knees
The beast you have slain again and again
I still remain

I'm the ghost of your pride
I am the wight of the days gone by
A remnant of life you left behind
Your angel sent from below

Where you'll go when all is said and done
Your life it will never be the same
The storm will rise again and
You'll see too late I am all that you hate

Rising from the ashes
A Dark messenger of sorrow
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe

Cruel wings of destruction
Harbringer of you downfall
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe

The evil in your closet
The wolf at your door
Everything that you're scared to wish for
I am it all

A whisper of freedom
Like echoes of Eden
I am wher your future lies

I've given to you a burden to bear
The lowest of lows and highest of highs
Give into me and all we can share is
Our sweet demise, the tears in our eyes

Tales of love and loss, a soul once left forlorn
The crow it calls to you, and bearer of the storm

I'm the sorrow and the horror in your heart
Your ill omen and the watcher in the dark

I'll play your twisted symphony once more
Your song echoes through the night so silent
And you will se

Rising from the ashes
A Dark messenger of sorrow
I'm the stormcrow

Cruel wings of destruction
Harbringer of you downfall
I'm the stormcrow

Rising from the ashes
A Dark messenger of sorrow
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe

Cruel wings of destruction
Harbringer of you downfall
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe

Rising from the ashes
A Dark messenger of sorrow
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe

Cruel wings of destruction
Harbringer of you downfall
I'm the stormcrow
I'm your woe
