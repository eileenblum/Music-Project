Once again I'm in too deep
Once again there is no sleep
Underneath these scarlit skies
Where you and me are but a stillborn dream
And if there'll be a brand new dawn
Can you tell me 

Where is my home and where is my haven
Where is the heart my name has been graven in

You're still a saint in my eyes
But God I am so tired
So take the knife
And sever the last lifeline
It's over 

Now one must walk alone
One is left behind
This is who we are
This is where we stand 

Strangers in the night
Our wounds open wide
Know that when you're gone
My heart beats for no one

Now I'm at the end of my rope
Out of strength and out of hope
You can have what's left of me
But if you do tread carefully
For now my mind is a minefield
My heart's a haunted house

Yours is a taste that used to be sweeter
Your every word keeps slaying the dreamer

I'll gather the pieces one last time
I'm not ok, I'm not fine
So dead inside
Leaving heaven denied behind
It's over 

Now one must walk alone
One is left behind
This is who we are
This is where we stand 

Strangers in the night
Our wounds open wide
Know that when you're gone
My heart beats for no one

Now one must walk alone
One is left behind
This is who we are
This is where we stand 

Strangers in the night
Our wounds open wide
Know that when you're gone
My heart beats for no one
