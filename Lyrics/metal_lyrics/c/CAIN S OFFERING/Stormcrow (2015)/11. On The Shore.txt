I know "forever" is asking too much
But what if this moment is all that we've got
What if the morning will leave us so frail
Leave us alone to face another day

I'm trying so hard but it's never enough
You try to stay strong but the things can get tough
We used to say "That will never be us"
Now "Ashes to ashes and dust to dust"

Anything you want, everything you need
You can find it all in me
But if I'm too much or I'm not enough...

When you've hoisted your canvass and you're ready to sail
I wanna tell you please don't think that you've failed
If your ship is too small and there is room for just one
I will stay on the shore so you can move on

Anything you want, everything you need
You can find it all in me
But if I'm too much or I'm not enough...

I'm standing on the shore of my emotions
Waiting for the water to rise and touch my
soul

And every forsaken night
All I wanted was to be right by your side
But you did not hear me
For I never spoke aloud my mind
I never cried

Anything you want, everything you need
You can find it all in me
But if I'm too much or I'm not enough...

Anything you want, everything you need
You can find it all in me
But if I'm too much or I'm not enough...

I'm standing on the shore... 

Anything you want, everything you need
You can find it all in me
