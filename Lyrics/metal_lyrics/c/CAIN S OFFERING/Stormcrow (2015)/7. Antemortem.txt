There's beauty in pain that paints every day
With colours that stay and won't fade away
In wounds that won't heal, in nightmares too real
They tell us that we can still feel 

In fire we're forged and given a form
The harder the hammer the stronger the soul
For all of our tears and all of our scars
They remind us of who we are 

One is for the heart we left behind
One is for a friend who said to goodbye
One is for the love we swore would never die
But that was in another lifetime 

One is for the times we were denied
One is for the feelings locked inside
One is for the secrets that we've had to hide
But that was in another lifetime 

We might've been kings
We might have been pawns
We might've been ducklings
We might have been swans 

There's no grand design
There's only desire
You're either the pearl or the swine

For all that we've lost and our every tear
The choices we've made have brought us here
Everything we are, everything we have
We have built from fragments

One is for the heart we left behind
One is for a friend who said to goodbye
One is for the love we swore would never die
But that was in another lifetime 

One is for the times we were denied
One is for the feelings locked inside
One is for the secrets that we've had to hide
But that was in another lifetime

But that was in another lifetime

Please believe in me
Because the man you see
is not the man I used to be

We may always be alone and broken
But we have survived, we are alive

Please believe in me
Because the man you see
is not the man I used to be

We may always be alone and broken
But we have survived, we are alive

One is for the heart we left behind
One is for a friend who said to goodbye
One is for the love we swore would never die
But that was in another lifetime 

One is for the times we were denied
One is for the feelings locked inside
One is for the secrets that we've had to hide
But that was in another lifetime

One is for the heart we left behind
One is for a friend who said to goodbye
One is for the love we swore would never die
But that was in another lifetime 

One is for the times we were denied
One is for the feelings locked inside
One is for the secrets that we've had to hide
But that was in another lifetime
