I will write a tale that is only mine
On the page the words entwine
My creation of beauty and of passion 

Mortal heart now writing immortal love
Everything I'm dreaming of
I will fashion a goddess, my obsession 

Stains on these pages
Constellation of tears
Like stars with scars 

Dark design of my twisted mind
You're the final blight of a failed playwright
Figment of my madness
Verse of woe and sadness 

Wild and free, you're the raging sea
And one day you will be the end of me
Your star will be brightest
In my constellation of tears 

You'll shine so bright tonight

Broke my quill, I can't bend her to my will
And the love grows stronger still
While the rhymes they betray and the words they fail me 

Erato, why do you hate me so?
Have some heart or let me go
I am old and I'm tired, uninspired 

Stains on these pages
Constellation of tears
Like stars with scars

Dark design of my twisted mind
You're the final blight of a failed playwright
Figment of my madness
Verse of woe and sadness 

Wild and free, you're the raging sea
And one day you will be the end of me
Your star will be brightest
In my constellation of tears 

You'll shine so bright tonight

A flame that burns twice as bright
Burns half as long
Mine faded long ago

My queen will never claim her throne
I'll always be alone, my tale be left untold

Stains on these pages
Constellation of tears
Like stars with scars

Dark design of my twisted mind
You're the final blight of a failed playwright
Figment of my madness
Verse of woe and sadness 

Wild and free, you're the raging sea
And one day you will be the end of me
Your star will be brightest
In my constellation

Dark design of my twisted mind
You're the final blight of a failed playwright
Figment of my madness
Verse of woe and sadness 

Wild and free, you're the raging sea
And one day you will be the end of me
Your star will be brightest
In my constellation of tears 

You'll shine so bright tonight
