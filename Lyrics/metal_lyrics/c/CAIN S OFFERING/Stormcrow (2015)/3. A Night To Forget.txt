When lights go down lets have another round
Come here my love, help me to search for my crown
A king of fools, I'm breaking all the rules
A drunken parody, I can't see the irony

This is my dynasty of pride and vanity
My broken self-esteem just can't face reality
Always the silent one, I was born to be undone
So I'll stay here in the darkness and I will

Leave everything
Leave everything behind me
My every sigh and every little lie
All that I have are memories so frozen
No one is flawless but baby I'm the worst

Pour me another one
Tell me I'll meet someone
A spoonful of sugar makes the poison go down

Feed my insanity
Write me a tragedy
Let's make a memory
A night to forget
Rain keeps falling
I'll keep crawling

At three A.M. I can't remember who I am
A sad and epic fail, I'm three on the Glasgow scale
Once again I vow "I'll make this right somehow"
It's just another lie, you'd cry if you could see me now

I'm such a travesty, living out my fallacy
Leave it to me to be the killer and the casualty
Late nights and neon lights
A thousand wrongs and zero rights
These are the steps that I must follow and I will

A shot of whiskey and some wine
A life in beautiful decline
I try to run, I try to hide
Intoxicated all the time

I'll build a bridge to watch it burn
Pour the ashes in the urn
And turn away just to start again
