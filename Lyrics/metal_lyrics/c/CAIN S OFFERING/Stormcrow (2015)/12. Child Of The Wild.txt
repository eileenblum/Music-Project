I've always been here underneath the stars
Underneath the snow white moon
I have no place to call my own
And my future is unknown 

This is my journey, I must walk alone
Solitude will be my home
Darkness my guide, silence my bride
And the creed of my kind

Blood will follow blood
When the wolves howl in the dark
You will know who you are

Child of the wild
Soul of a vagabond
A son of the moon and stars
I was born to run with the wind
that races along my

Mind of a child
Heart of a wanderer
Eyes always shining bright
Through the night and
Under the northern star
I'll be standing
Strong like my mother
Fierce like my father

I've seen the mountains
Piercing through the clouds
I have heard the thunder roar
Seen thousand waves kiss distant shores
Still I keep searching for more

I'll ask no mercy, I'm the winterborn
I'm the breeze and I'm the storm
I won't be caged, I can't be tamed
Always free and unchained

Blood will follow blood
When the wolves howl in the dark
You will know who you are

Child of the wild
Soul of a vagabond
A son of the moon and stars
I was born to run with the wind
that races along my

Mind of a child
Heart of a wanderer
Eyes always shining bright
Through the night and
Under the northern star
I'll be standing
Strong like my mother
Fierce like my father
