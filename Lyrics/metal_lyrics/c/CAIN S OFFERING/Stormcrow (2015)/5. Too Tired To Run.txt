There was a time when I could make your bright eyes gleam
Now smiles upon your face are few and far between
We were so young, naive and blind in all our pride
To see the warning, the turning of the tide

And I guess it's best we laid to rest
All that we had and all that we hope for
It's time to close the door

Stand here by my side and watch the river flow
Through fields once green, where our garden used to grow
Life goes by so fast and time waits for no one
Too long we stared into the sun
Now days are growing dark and we're too tired to run

Now that we've lost the flame, the beauty of it all
Our symmetry of souls reduced to metaphor
We live, we learn some things are impossible to do
And still I need you more than I want to

But I guess it's best we laid to rest
All that we had and all that we hoped for
It's time to close the door

Stand here by my side and watch the river flow
Through silent fields, where our garden used to grow
Life goes by so fast and time waits for no one
Too long we stared into the sun
Now days are growing dark and we're too tired to run

I could've been worse, but I should've been better
Should've been there 'cause I said "forever"
Now I'm here wondering what
Should've, could've, would've been and

I could've said more 'cause the words they matter
Should've been strong so you wouldn't have shattered
But I'm here wondering what
Should've, could've, would've been

And I hope he gives more than I did
All that you need and all that you hope for

Stand here by my side and watch the river flow
Through silent fields, where our garden used to grow
Life goes by so fast, so hold me one last time
You'll always be true love of mine
And when the day is through I'm watching over you
