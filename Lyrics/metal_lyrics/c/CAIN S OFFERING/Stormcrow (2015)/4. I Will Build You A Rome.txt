[Lyrics and music by Jani Liimatainen]

A word or a touch
All I need, I'm not asking for much
Take my hand, I will follow you home
With these hands I will build you a Rome
Where they will never find us

No need to be scared
I do not care about who you were
All that matters is right here and now
What will come there is no way to know
But we'll face it together

You'll never need to ask for more
You know you can have it all

[Chorus:]
My love, my soul, my heart
Are yours if you just want
To share your life with me
Forevermore

They will not burn our Rome
My heart will always be your home
As long as you will have me

Since we began
You have turned me into a man
Into someone I wished I could be
I believe and the gods they decree
We were meant for each other

You'll never need to ask for more
You know you can have it all

[Chorus]

The only heaven I need is you
Always so tender and always true
You are the spark that can light up my dark
Forever safe right here in my arms

And I don't just love you for who you are
But for what you have made out of me
Not for your beauty, so easy to see
But for making me now complete

[Solo]

[Chorus]
