You always tried so hard to hide
All the pain you held inside
A little piece of heaven
Faded, tainted memory
You always smiled and played your part
A jaded soul and hardened heart
Like a child you stumbled in the dark 

These are the hands that shelter you
When the rain begins to pour
This is the heart than listens
When you're down, can take no more
No matter what you're not alone
I am always by your side
I will be here when the worlds collide 

Let it rain and let it thunder
You'll be safe from going under
You will not drown, I won't let you down
And when the winter comes I'll keep you warm 

There's hope in every heartbeat
Beautiful and complete
When you're in too deep
You can always call on me
For no mountain is too high
No ocean is too wide
For me to come and be your rising sun

I am the one to light the way
Through the darkest of your days
A beacon in the night
To guide your ship back to the shore
A rain to wash away the stains
Of a thousand yesterdays
There's no need for you to be afraid

Let it rain and let it thunder
You'll be safe from going under
You will not drown, I won't let you down
And when the winter comes I'll keep you warm

There's hope in every heartbeat
Beautiful and complete
When you're in too deep
You can always call on me
For no mountain is too high
No ocean is too wide
For me to come and be your rising sun

I will always be here standing at your door
And my arms are open wide
Waiting here until your wave will reach my shore
Waiting for the eventide

Let all your grief cascade on me
I'll be the sea where they'll drown 

There's hope in every heartbeat
Beautiful and complete
When you're in too deep
You can always call on me
For no mountain is too high
No ocean is too wide
For me to come and be our rising sun
For me to come and be our rising sun
