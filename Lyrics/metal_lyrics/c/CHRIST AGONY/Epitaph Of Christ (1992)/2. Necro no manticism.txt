So bloody night soiled with desire
slowly awakes like death looks in your eyes
this night leaves too, she's wearing a coat
she's leaving taken by the horses of day

We come here to glorify death
to take of irons from the face
we come here to sink the fear
to get rid of repugnance

This night is to resemble a temple
this night is the only sanctity
we will apply it's oil to your bodies
and the screams will flow out of one mouth into another
This night is death
it's a last kiss
it's a forgiven sin

We come here to glorify death
to bid the day farewell with screams and singing
we come here to sink in death
and to devote us to this entirely

It's our sanctuary
a temple of lost travellers
searching for their own worlds

Possesed by lusts
they celebrate the brutality of silence
they search for an unknown god
naked truths in irons chained to the rocks
and bloody sacrifices 
hate ragging around
and angert making the hands burst
treaded traces arround to the weird castles
the warriors of barbarous tribes
the last among the real ones
they don't escape from fear in churches of killing
glorifying diamonds and beautiful women
they will find their own home in illusion
the last so faithful till the end
without death
