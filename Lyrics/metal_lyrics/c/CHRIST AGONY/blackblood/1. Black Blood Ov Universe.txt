Queen of the night
Mother of stars
Enlightening the unconquerable trail
Sky is full â circles astray
Falling stars and mist
Signifying the coming oft he
DEAD

Queen of the night
Mother of the universe
You enlightened the undisturbed peace
Bestowing kisses to the night
How bloody and delightful they areâ¦

How lustful and immaculately clean

Queen of the night
Mother of the dead
With demigods and demons
Bring closer to the unbelievers
The meaning of creation and
DESTRUCTIONâ¦

The black blood of your circle
That spills on us all!

I pledge my kiss on your bleeding feet
Gazing in pain upon the dying world
The blood in my veins melts the angerâ¦
Rejoiced I am with the coming of New Age!

Queen of the night
Mother of kings
The horizon bows down to your DREAMS!!!

Goddess of chaos â I summon thee
Lady of darkness â I summon thee
Ultimate witch â I summon thee
Queen of beauty â I summon thee
