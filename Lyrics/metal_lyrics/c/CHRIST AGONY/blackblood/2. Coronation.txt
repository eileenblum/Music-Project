Time
The time has come, in which we all
Shall put our heads on a spike
Born from manâs hatred!

The time has come
In which we all
Shall put words into actions
The time has come

The time has come
In which we all
Shall resurrect in our flesh
The original sin in an unnamed
SCREAM

Coronation! Our flesh!

The time has come, in which silence
Shall reign during the enchanting
Sleep

The time has come, unknown
Longing to becomeâ¦
Making us only a faint reflection
Of Ourselves

Only able to understand
The final ritualâ¦

And let the virgin blood
On the hands of death
Be turned into wine
On the EQUINOX
I summon you beautiful creatures
To breed rebellion and all-knowledge!!!
