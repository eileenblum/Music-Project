From the deeps I carry away my soul
To know the beauty and the spell
That heavenly kingdom is only for those
Few angels that we cast away
From the deeps I call out for my soul
Lost for humanity, lost for the world...

Drink my blood and get rid of guilt
And those distant land from my dreams
Where I stood, the altar of filth
Drink the blood form the fountain
So I may feel hatered again
Hatered, the first misterss of the death

And so I call out from the abyss
Hear my secret request
I live at the banks of humanity
Feeling the disgust and your sweet rot

There is a storm
Inside red eyes of thruth
Fiery sparkles and glows
The only light within
Thousand stars...

O Lord of a Thousand Names
It's nocturn
The abyss is called Hell
Like Sheol is called a tomb...
And when the first is out - your light
Lives on in the dark...

O Lord of the Abyss!
Black blood in the universe - art Thou
A secret circles of stars - art Thou
Marked among them - art Thou
Master of death and chaos - art Thou
