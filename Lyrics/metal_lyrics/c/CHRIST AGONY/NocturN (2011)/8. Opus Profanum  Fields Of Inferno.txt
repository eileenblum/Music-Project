Within the profundity of chaos
No stars and no sun,
Only hatered lets God spread his wings...

O ye almighty dragon
And all-powerful lord
Black star on the firmament of Hell
Show us the way...

Although the path is cold
So dark, and so cold
It's nothing against him
Nor truth
Nothing against nothingness...

You're the eternal flame
You're the celestial key
You're in the sea of fire
Opened are the gates of the universe...

Welcome, o ye eternal fire
Flame of the lost souls
Travelling through forgotten worlds
Welcome, o ye flame of hatered
So pristine, and so beautiful...

Step into the eternal fire
And indulge yourself with its charm
And so the human corpse may collapse
In the burning churches' walls
Undisturbed, like death
In the abyss of the stars

Like a flower - o ye holy hatered
Bloody within the black womb
O saint blood, so black
So full, so defiant
Like a flower dark, from the lips
Extracting the beauty of the night...
