In the bay if dormant wind
I summon those who know
In the glow of red dwarf
I summon those who dream

This place is not for us
Nor is the house of lies
The one which will unite - in pain
His seal is made of blood

Carve your symbol
Dancing with your lover - night
Mark your stigma with layers of sin
The stigma of Hell

O Lord of the Night
At your command
The world will ignite...

Be my penance until the end
My enchanted nocturn
Be my art and flame
And take me away
Deep into the night...
