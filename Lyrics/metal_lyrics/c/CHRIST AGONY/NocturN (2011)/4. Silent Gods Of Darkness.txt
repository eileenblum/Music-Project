In the name of the king, the shadow I invoke
In the name of the king, I call for the wind
In the name of the king, I summon the fog

Come to us, the Priest of Now Silent Gods
The Priest of Forgotten Rituals
Let your fire light up the darkness
Helping us to uncover the treasures
At the bottom of the boundless sea
On the desert coast and on the land

I call for the wind, oh glorious beast
I summon the storm, oh glorious beast
You lift up the sorrow of eternity
Amidst the rain and Thy many names

Oh Lord...
Send us the light of God's existence
That in each of us has its root
Xul is the deed, Xul is the thought
Thus, this makes the one
Which is great and before us
He poenes the gates...
Xul is the deed, Xul is the thought...

I recall you to this land of beauty
I recall you to the gates of the ancient ones
Holding in his hand the ritual stone
Powered by winds
Four elements
And thus I dispere the clouds...
