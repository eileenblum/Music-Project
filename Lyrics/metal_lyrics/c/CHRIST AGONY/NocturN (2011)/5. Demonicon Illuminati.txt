That night you were indescribably beautyful
O messanger of my suffering
In pain we rest with the night
And the luminosity...
That night you were my torch
Which eternal blaze
Brought all the demons to me...

Priestess of the night
Latern of the morning star
The crown of death is on your head
Illuminating path for the mad
Of damnation and sin...
And when the sun will rise
Never fear again
Defiance and pain, it's who I am...
Like the dark that has it's profundity
So I call the primitive rights
You shall not have strange gods before me
And forfeit the syndrom of pulchritude
Giving yourself mto the impulse...
