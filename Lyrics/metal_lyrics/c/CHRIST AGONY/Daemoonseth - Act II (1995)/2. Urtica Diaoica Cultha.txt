my lord
gave me the faith
brought the obsession
gave the love
tha pain
the liberation
I am in the darkness
besides me the nonentity
the god died

in the darkness
I am washing my face
with the blood
of the mute virgins
being raped for sacrifice

I am inside of you
my master
in your eyes
on your lips

oh... master of mine
I am inside of you
as the scar of unbelief
as the might
the obsession!

I am inside of you
as the birth of sin
as the mark of hate

as the devilish mark
it's time to possess
the forces of god!
