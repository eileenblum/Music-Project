oh god
I have seen my reflexion in your eyes
my face was not there
I'm a child of a devil

oh god
look at me
this is my belief
it's me
that changes the wine into the blood
and my body
is to be eaten
by your congregation

oh god
look at me
this is my belief

I wanted to extinguish
the candles on
my own altar
I've tried to conquer the day
which smouldered my body
I've tried the blood
from my own face
I've tried my own crown
which kneds before you, humiliated
the dark ones in hoods
have taken everything
they have trodden my ceremonies
and burned
both my god and his woman

they cried to the sky
stand up you bitch
take the wine cup and the roses
from your naked knees
cover your pure desires

I saw their scream burning
saw them licking up their tears
saw the holy night burning
stained eyes
supsended in the darkness

crowded crosses at night
filled altars at night
sacronocturn
the lonelyness disappears among tears
the belief is vanishing among crosses
sacronocturn

blood brotherhood is belief destruction
belief, that's sitting in your hips
in your hips there's a hidden fear
against the holy sign
against smell of incense
your womb
took christ
hhis ribs rubbed with your breast
lika a loft
a holy covenant has come
I know, that your hips
have taken a god
and they demand a new one

crowded crosses at night
filled altars at night
sacronocturn
