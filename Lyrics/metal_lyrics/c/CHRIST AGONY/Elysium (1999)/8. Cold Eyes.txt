(...of the beast)

You touch my feet without a word
And undress you body slowly
Showing hunger of dead shoulders
To my eyes...

Insatiable of trembling body
Frivolous of a kiss
Disgusting inspired face
And joy from the palms...
You slowly slipped through
My hand
As if everyone could see...

Finally you rise up like carnal
Thrown at the abyss
You're like defenceless dog
Groeles into depth
Where only I paint your eyes...

You go away humiliated
You go away cold
You go away cal my crazy
And from you black eyes
Blood flows down
Turning my palms
Into glass lakes
Surrounded by the fog of sighs
And my lameness...
