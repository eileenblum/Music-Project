What is life?
Immortal dust
What is life?
Stainless fire
What is life?
The source of water
What is life?
Collection to suffer
A cup of sin
Only Loneliness
Among many pains...

Talk to me as much as you can
Speak to me
So I can feel and memorise
Talk to me as much as you can
Speak to me
So I can feel and memorise
So I can understand who you are...

What is life?
Immortal dust
What is life?
Stainless fire
What is life?
Only loneliness
Among many illusions...

Eternal life!
Eternal life!
Eternal life!
