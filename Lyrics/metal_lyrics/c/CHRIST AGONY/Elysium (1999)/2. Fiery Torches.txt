Fire digests my heart
Cause we're not here anymore
Last night you went away
Last night...
I'll only remember
The moments I've spent with you
They'll stay with me forever
Forever...

Death is proud and enormous
Death mocks at human weakness
Death is a Dark God...

Fire digests my heart
I'm full of pain
Last night everything has gone away
The world has finished among the stars...
I'll only remember
The moments I've spent with you
They'll stay with me forever
Forever...

Eternity is our time
Fiery torches are desired
Our naked bodies among them
Will become one...
Eternity is place for us
Moonlight is the signpost
Our lips sealed and bodies
We'll live with eternal love...

Eternal love!

New ways opened in front of us
New gates are wide in front of us
Eternity is a place for us
Moonlight is the signpost...
