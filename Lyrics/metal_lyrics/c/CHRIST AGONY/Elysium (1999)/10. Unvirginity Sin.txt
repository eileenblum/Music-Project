In red of the moon
In bloodred of the sun
I plunge eye-lids
Trying to fall asleep...

Neither dream
Neither god, nor spirit I touch
Still thirsty of the sin

To the sin I am
With a sin I'll be winged
To the sin I am
With a sin I'll be immortal

In red of the moon
In bloodred of the sun
I plunge eye-lids
Trying to fall asleep...

In one moment I could be
As touchable as the night
As unvirginity as the light
As far as the sky...

Nothing except madness
Is left in a look
As fast as...

In one moment I could be
As touchable as the night
As unvirginity as the light
As far as the sky...
