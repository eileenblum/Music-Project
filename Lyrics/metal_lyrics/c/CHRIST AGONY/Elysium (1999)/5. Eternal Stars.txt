I'm running away
Cause there's no place for me here
There's no memory
Time doesn't exist...
I'm running away
Cause the source of my cry ends
My bleeding heart
Has to find eternity
Hidden among the stars

My dying star
Forgive me weakness
My dying star
Forgive me my sin

I'm running away
Cause there aren't your eyes
There's no memory
Time doesn't exist...
I'm running away
Cause the path of my life ends
There aren't your kisses anymore
There aren't your words anymore
Among the stars I shall find your smell...

My dying star
Let me find myself
My dying star
Let me kiss immortality...
I'm beside you
I'm waiting...
i'm beside you
Eternity lets me find you
I'm still waiting...
