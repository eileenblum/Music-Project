Oh, Lord of the Night
Where will you spread our pieces
Where shall the ashes of our bodies fall
Where will our lips bloom again...

Oh, Lord of the Night
Take my blood and drink life out of it
Take my blood...
Let my body be reborn
On the other side of life...

Oh, Lord of the Night
With my calling
I summon all the hearts from darkness
Let the mysteriuos be woken up
Let the voices be woken up

Lord of the Night!
Stronger than haterass
Raises its wings over the stars
Stronger than universe
Raises its wings over the fire

I summon all the hearts from darkness
Let the mysterious be woken up
Let the voices be woken up

Keep quiet!
With cry sew up your lips!
Be immortal!

Keep quiet!
Drink my blood together with death...
Take me inside you...

Keep quiet!
I shall be helpful talisman
When you cross the dark side...
