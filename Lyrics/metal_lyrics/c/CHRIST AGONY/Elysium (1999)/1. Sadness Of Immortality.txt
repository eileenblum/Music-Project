I'll find you on the other side
Even if you hate me
I'll be beside you
You won't even notice
I'll trample on your feet
You won't even notice...

I'll find you on the other side
Cause my love is eternal
Even your sadness won't disturb
You won't even notice...

I'll find you on the other side
My thoughts flow to you
I'll find you on the other side
Hot feelings flow to you...

My heart flows to you
My thoughts flow to you
My feelings flow to you
We'll meet on the dark side...

I'll find you on the dark side
Cause my love is eternal
Even your sadness won't disturb
You won't even notice...

Eternal!

The sadness of immortality
Inside of me
Cause I'm waiting for a meeting
I'm still waiting
I'm unaware of that
What's beyond us...
We take away ourselves among
The same stars
We'll meet on the dark side...
