My body is just like a burning torch
From inside digests my love
And beyond it winds and storms
And beyond nothingness and vanity...

My body is just like burning torch
There's hateress and love in it
There's sadness and pleasure in it
And beyond it nothingness and vanity...
My body is burning!
Let me stay only this night
My body is burning...
Let me beautiful beside you
My sight is already beautiful
Let me be a lover
My bodyis burning
Let me your wing
My heart is already bleeding
