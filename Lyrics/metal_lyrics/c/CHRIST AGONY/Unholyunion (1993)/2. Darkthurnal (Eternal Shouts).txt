The body of the night is the ugliness
Full of waiting
It's the unknown
In which Devil found
The source of my fear

I'm in the middle of this night
Enveloped in sickness
I'm in it
I'm in the middle of eternal flame
And it's priestess invites
She's unknown
An introduction and the end

Kneeling against her
I don't kneel but words
Crying against her
Tears are abnormal
Capable to provoke a storm
With my unbelief

Only the fire and the water
The Unknown God is eternal

The body of the night is the ugliness
Full of waiting
It's unknown
Everyone of you is in this night
And everyone looks for his own god
And everyone cries:

Unsaint shouts
Spat the sky
Unsaint shouts
Spat to God
