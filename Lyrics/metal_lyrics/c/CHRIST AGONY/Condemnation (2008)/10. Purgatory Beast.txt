Behold, I am the Beast
Behold, I am the Only One
Chosen by the Abyss
And messenger of Truth...

With Cleansing Force
I restore the Universe
Building Order
New World...

Behold, I am the Beast
Inscribed Mark
In the Book of Khao'tsu
Ashes shall I leave behind
And confusion...
Because Nothingness fills
My heart for the God of Cross...

Damnation flows in my Veins
Marked with Fire
And Fire I Rule
Because Nothingness fills
My heart for the God of Cross...
