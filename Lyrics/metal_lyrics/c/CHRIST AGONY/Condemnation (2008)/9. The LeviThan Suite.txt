There is no place for good and evil
But ruins and non-existence...
There is no place for love and mercy
But ruins and non-existence...

Only pain and suffering
Allows to feel truly
For there is no place for hope...

Possessed, condemned, barefooted
I stalk through the burning land of beauty
Far beyond howling of wolves...
Far beyond your breath...

Fog above me...
Rain and another step...
I leave the hollow land behind...
Hell may be my blessing
Dawn's possession may be my blessing...

Nobody there is truly herself...
Fake is every cry
Every suffering is just a substitute
Of true suffering...
I stand among the stars
And from them i lick
Divinity given only to the burning angels

Fallen, naked, barefooted
Among many suns
I find my own sadness
And the cause of the end...
