This is my secret...
This is my secret land...
It is me among them all
Wonders of the world here I stand
With my own desire
Of your existence...

This is my kingdom
The fortress of my marks
This is my secret world
And my words like tears
Reflexing the light
Into the non-existence of your world...

This is the manifesto of the sin of mine
Hidden deep down the bleeding heart
Hidden deep down in eyes
And full of poison
Hatching to the world therough the night

This is the manifesto of sin - the manifesto of lies
And truths of all kinds...
Care of domination over the world
In silence and curse we are free...
We care about our beauty
Living just our own lives
We find ourself and our hope...
