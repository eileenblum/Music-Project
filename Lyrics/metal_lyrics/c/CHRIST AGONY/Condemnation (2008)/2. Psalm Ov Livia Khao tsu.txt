You would be too beautiful to die in my arms
But what can you do, when the body is weak and mind too sick
You cannot desire warmness
When you feel only the coldness of body
Chilling senses, longing for ecstasy

But what can you do, if body is only
A reflection of senses
I only crave for one thing
One mind
One ecstasy

Perhaps I'm only nihility in fog of Your Values
Nothing can I do -- I'm only Nothingness...

Without craving -- I'm nothing
And the hub of the Universe...
For what is Nothingness if not the Grandeur of all
My World
My Existence...
