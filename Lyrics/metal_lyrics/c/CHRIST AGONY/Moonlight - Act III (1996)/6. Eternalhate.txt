...And eternity be my curse
Chant of the prophets
...And eternity be my oath
Sorrow of the solitude

I call the spell in my eyes
The mysterious spell
I am liberated
And poured Iam
Into my kingdom
With the tribute
I paid for eternity
This might has my name
And the demons shapes my lips
Into lustful grins

I stalk
I stalk
This blood has my name
And the demons on my lips
Be the devilish tongue

Stalk
Stalk
For one is my name
Of the hateful ones
I create the path
For the unfaithful ones
For the unsatiable ones

I despise the fanatics
And God I detest
The tomb I sign with blood
For the memory of his relatives
The tears meltthe madness
Of my desires

Eternity never I die with
I shall live with eternity

For one is my name
Of the hateful ones

Welcome!
Welcome to the eternity!
Welcome to the edge of madness!
Welcome to eternity!

My feet are bleeding-
-Follow the sign

Welcome to nothingness!!!
