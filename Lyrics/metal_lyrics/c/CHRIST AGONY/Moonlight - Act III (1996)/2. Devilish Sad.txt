My eyes
With nocturnal vampirism they
burn
With the shadow of catacombs
Floating with soul of my
death...

My eyes
With nocturnal bird they burn
With the howling beauty of thy
arms
With the scream filled with pain
They burn

My might
Boundessly it rises
Power of the moons in the
pentagon of love...

Our gods
In their mothers' womb they burn
In diabolical circles of courses of fiery dreams

Demon
Demon of light
Your sadness
Is in my soul
