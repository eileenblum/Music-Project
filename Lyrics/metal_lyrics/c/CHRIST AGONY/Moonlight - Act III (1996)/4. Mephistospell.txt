Only my semen
Full moon it is
Only my semen
Solitary night it is
Only my semen
Full moon it is
Only my semen
Diabolical wind it is

I summon the night
For darkness give me shelter in its arms
I summon the storm
For wind spread my beauty hidden in fire

I stalk towards the endlessness of thoughts
Moonlight be my guide
I stalk towards the eternity
Moonlight be my guide

In magic circle
My soul shall find
Her time
In the ritual of blood
I shall find the existence

Only my blood
Is the devilish truth
In the maze of my soul

Only my semen
Full moon it is
Only my semen
Solitary night it is
Only my semen
Full moon it is
Only my semen
Diabolical wind it is

...Mephistospell...
...Mephistospell...

Only my blood
Is the devilish truth
In the maze of my soul...
