Sonnet of the witches
Sounds the kiss of death
The trinity of omnipotance-
-The triangle of blasphemy

With the fourth thunder
The Pentateuch was closed
The six mysteries-
-The sixth lie

The moonlight shines with demon's scream
I am the heart
I am the soul
Moonlight

Psalm of the seven signs
Eternity above my death
Is the spell
Is the domination of the gloom

The moonlight shines with demon's scream
I am the heart
I am the soul
Moonlight

The black art
Is the power of suffering
The black circle
Is the pearl of the sad throne
My despair
Is the sceptre of passion
The mass of God
Is the call ogf the whores
In the dusk of fire...

Three marks of the gloom
Areon my face
Flames of eternity
The might of moon's beauty
The love of the night
Embraces the blasphemies of gods
With oblivion
Nothingness of dreams
In pagan ritual
Debased

My rebel
My soul despair
My rebel
The union in the gloom

The moonlight shines with demon's scream
I am the heart
I am the soul
Moonlight...
