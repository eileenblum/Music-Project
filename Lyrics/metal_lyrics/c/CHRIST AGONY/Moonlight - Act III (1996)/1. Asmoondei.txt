Kiss the blood
On my lips
Kill the blood
On my eyes
Kill the God!
Let the moonlight
Bring back the existence
Of the missing ones
Their breath
In black despair shall unite
Blasphemous dreams
Illusion of sin

Bow
In the darkness
Kiss the blood
On my eyes

The demon's horus
Have rumbled
The winds
Have possessed the faithful ones

The prayers
Spilled in blood
Scream
Pagan son
Darkness calls
Three black roses
In hair of the wind
In hair of the wind
They are
The sign
Of the death
Of the hidden goddess
They are
In silence of the night
I am with them

Sons of the fire
Sons of the wind
Awake your bodies
Of Demigods

Demons
Dance of the verges
On the triangles...
