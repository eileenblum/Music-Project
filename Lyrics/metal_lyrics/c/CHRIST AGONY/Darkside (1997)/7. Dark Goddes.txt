My goddes waits the insatible womb
The wavy hips, the fresh blood

I'm coming back...
I'm coming back...

Kiss my lips and drink my blood
The eternity is with me

You'll se the light with guides
You'll see the space
of your own liberation

Kill me for my freedom
for my independence
Fill me for me thoughts
for my words
Kiss my lips and drink my blood

Eternity is with me

I'm coming back...
I'm coming back...
