You are the black abyss
Nocturnal wish for sin
I crave for your shadow
Thirsty Goddes of Dream...

Starless space starry abyss
my pain and moon's way
I crave for your shadow
Thirsty Goddes of Dream...

Moon dust on your faces
is only the beginning of sin.
My lips touch the unholy ground
of my kingdom

I'm coming back...

You are the desire for my breath
The phantom and mirrors' reflection
my hands are blooming
as I touch your lips

Your kiss penetrates my mouth
your possession at my source
sips the blood

- I'm already near -
I can see with your eyes
