Darkness!
Wings give to me
To invite the wind
In my arms

Darkness!
WIngs give to me
To relief questions
Of my lust

Darkness!
You are the beautiful act
Of my inspiration

Darkness!
Beautiful you are in my eyes
Messengeress

Fire dimly light in my face
In madness it hides and in sin
More nudity
My eyes inhake
And nothingless
Covers my face
