Dying star
You're my lover
At the heaven of tongues
I desire your light my lover
I desire your tenderness

You are the landscape of desires
THe eye of the only truth

Dying star
Queen of the void
You've given me power
Of the only desire

You flow
In my veins
Till the end of my way
Till the end of the day
