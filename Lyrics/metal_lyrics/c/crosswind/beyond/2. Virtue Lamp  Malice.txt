Two roads lie ahead of you, in every step you take
To pick one isn't just a choice, a vow that cannot break
Virtue is a rugged path, but malice screams inside
All the pleasure, all the joy, you want you cannot hide

Father help me, how could I decide
To kiil the inner call that burns inside
All at once I want but cannot find,
Freedom's not a choice, In my mind

Malice makes a happy soul, when virtue keeps you strong
To pick one never makes you whole, to choose is always wrong
Watch for signs out of the black, to guide you in the night
The path of strength, a call of war, you stand and always fight.

Father help me, how could I decide
To kiil the inner call that burns inside
All at once I want but cannot find,
Freedom's not a choice, In my mind

Just keep an open mind, feed the fire inside
Gaze in your soul, as you walk on through the storm
Straight to the fight
