We have to believe, that we face a dead eve
The kingdom's defence, is no more immence
Our freedom they raped, they filled us with hate
They came up so fast, they made it at last.

[Chorus:]
Insist, raise your fist.
Maybe one day we will find our peace
Feel this ground grass stands pure
Another soldier dies that's for sure.

Our hate now burns, it twists and it turns
We march now to be, independent and free
Our leaders betrayed, they kneeled and they prayed
The time is now right, we'll taste blood tonight.

[Chorus]

With our hearts burning will, with fire and steel
We'll take back our realm, reach for our dream
Betrayers will burn, forever they'll mourn
When breaking the fence, you'll taste our revenge.
