Into the mist of a time long ago
Three hundrend men had the duty and courrage to go
Fight with persians a million strong
Their king wants our country, our proud life and even our soul.

We won't surrender so easy, we won't conform to your plan,
You want ourselves and our kingdom, to make it a part of your clan...
We say come and take if you can!

March day and night to wait at the spot,
Where we'll take your lives and then leave free your bodies to rot.
Stand before you at break of the dawn,
And wait there we will till your bodies by our steel be sawn.

Marching in silence as brothers, our eyes in the blue sky above.
We know that our death is for certain,
But in our hearts no remorse...
Straight to the hot gates we go!

Silence our song as we stand proud and tall,
The battle begins and our hearts crave to kill 'em all.
Theyâre like waves falling onto a rock,
We will stand this ground by steel and by fire and stone.

Fight for your kin not for glory, Fight for your land and your homes
In Hades we'll meet to remember
this day when we died as gods...
With utter contempt for the odds!
