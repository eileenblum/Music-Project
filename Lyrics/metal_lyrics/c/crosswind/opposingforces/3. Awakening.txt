The years passing by made them stronger
Fortressed their reign of decay
Voices of truth kept in silence
Threw dreams and wishes away.
Now that you see the enslavement
Brought down by underworld kings,
Move and get up from the pavement
Rise up and reclaim your wings.

[Bridge:]
For a future so bright,
That they kept out of sight,
In the end we will rise

[Chorus:]
Raise the ramparts, man the guns
Blow them all to hell and back
Fight to reclaim what has been ours
Before the birth of the stars
Give them fire, Give them Hell
Stop when the last one is slain
Break out of your chains, rise unbound
Mankind her freedom she found

For ages they plotted our downfall
Played us like puppets of old
Hiding the truth all around us,
Made us so distant and cold.
Open your eyes look around you,
Nothing is what it may seem
Awaken the spirit within you
Fight to the end for a dream
