Our minions are working the surface for years
To feed them our lies and then drown them in tears
Blind of our actions
They won't understand
How we've arranged this to come
Black out the future so bright they once had
So we can take what was ours.

[Chorus:]
We'll burn down the skies
Crush the hope given by prophets to keep them alive.
Burn all to cinders
And relish in human demise.
Out from a flaming horizon the Nephilim rise.

Hiding in shadows, and wait to appear
Spawn through confusion and bathe them in fear
Out of the darkness
We'll come from below
Torch up the cities above
For our dominion the time's growing near
They'll never see us attack.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
