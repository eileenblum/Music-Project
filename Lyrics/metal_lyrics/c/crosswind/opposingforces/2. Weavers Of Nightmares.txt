They are elected, protecting mankind
But from the shadows they're turning you blind.
"Let us protect you, for danger is near,
Choking your freedom our reign comes from fearâ.

[Chorus:]
Weaving the fabric of nightmares,
Making their profits from war,
Search for the truth and you'll see with your eyes,
How our future slowly dies...

Objectives are set and their mission is clear
While we're asleep, they inject us with fear
Run to your shepherds, their knives are at hand,
Sheep to the slaughter you die on command.

[Chorus]

Humanity's sleeping, where's hope to be found?
We'll soon awaken but shackled and bound
Void of our voices, our rights stripped away
Cry then we will for our hands paved the way..

[Chorus]
