In a world where night
has silently killed off the day
All the mighty do is look proud
on feet made of clay
As a new beginning waits
to devour what's old
All the masses do is weep
for their souls have been sold

Oh, don't try to run, don't try to hide
Shepherds in black will feed you your pride
Pawns in their endgame, attack to retreat
Come and worship the lords of deceit

When the light of truth
is slowly engulfed by their lies
Then the weak will give
their souls up for fear of demise
As they plant their seeds
of sorrow of guilt and dismay
In the people's minds the
night will become the new day

Gather 'round and watch
destruction in places afar
Shut your minds and mouths
for your turn may not be too far
Kiss the hand that feeds
the fear you were destined to slay
Lick the chains that bind
your souls to the spawn of decay.
