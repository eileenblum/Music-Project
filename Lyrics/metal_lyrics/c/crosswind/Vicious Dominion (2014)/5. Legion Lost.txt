Once we set out on our conquest
To battle the land and the sea
The titans would bow down before us
The might of our sword was set free
Rode on through forest and desert
Stared at the eyes of the sun
Always felt something was missing
Despite the battles we've won

Tried to ascend our own nature
Tried to be one with the gods
Wanted to wield our own scepter
But they took off their facades
Banished us all in a a nightmare
Until our time would return
Lost in the folds of dimensions
Forever destined to burn

In silence and sorrow all cast
blind to future and past
Eternally paying the cost
always to be the Legion Lost

At the end of your time,
We'll witness a new world beginning
We'll become flesh and bone &amp; regain our throne
At last to reclaim our destiny

Our swords and our shields lay in ruins
Our pride and our emblems now lost
The one thing we craved for was knowledge
But our own souls were the cost
How can we ever be mortals?
Since we have seen the unseen?
What lays above and beyond us
Oh lord can we ever be free..?

And be whole again
Once more to rise from this bane
Rise up as mortals, as warrior kings
as visions of might from afar
Then they'll recall who we are

Lost In this deafening silence
Mist of our sorrows we call
All of our dreams lay forgotten
Since we have chosen to fall
No-one remembers the future
That has been promised to all
Fighting our way through oblivion
'Til we once more hear the call
