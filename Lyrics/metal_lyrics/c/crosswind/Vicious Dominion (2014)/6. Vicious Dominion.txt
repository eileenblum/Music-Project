Riders who came from the darkness,
Feeding on dreams from above.
Came forth to tear down the skies.
Craving for pillage and murder,
Black are the flags where they stand
Night cloaks the daggers at hand.

Forever burning your future,
Running your dreams to the ground.
No-one but you makes a sound.
Harvesting powers of nations,
Onset of mankind's demise
Wake up and see through your eyes.

Don't hide in shadows and look from afar,
As they break worlds in their palm.
Their vicious dominion will tear us apart
The hourglass runs out of sands.

Death in the mask of creation,
Pain hid in pleasure and love.
Twisting clear day into night
Obscuring the light of your vision
Stuffing your throat with their lies
Sleep while another one dies.
