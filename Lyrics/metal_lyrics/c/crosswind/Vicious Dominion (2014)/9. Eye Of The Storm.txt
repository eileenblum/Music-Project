Nothing seems right,
This dark, cold night
Your heart is empty,
Your soul's full of pain
Just close your eyes,
Leave worries behind
Brace yourself and fly away!

Now face your fears
Flow in the night
You always were on your own...

Dive in your memories, Take what is best
Don't try to hide from yourself
From years to come, You cannot run
So dive in the eye of the storm.

You think you're worthless,
Dust in the wind.
The future is locked for your dreams
Never give up,
Don't think to stop.
Follow your heart
Make it happen.
