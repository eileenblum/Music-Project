Raised as nobles, learned the skills of the fight
Trained in magic, and divine second sight
Preacher warriors, riding hard to the east
Thirsty broadswords for the neck of the beast.

Years of searching, through arcane texts of old
Gave them insight and these powers they hold
One desire, to ascend their own state
Rising higher, to be held down by fate.

War hardened stallions they ride
Fire and steel by their side
Swords make the rules as they sing
Not the will of a king
Red Skies they scream out their name.

Lands have fallen, kingdoms plunged in the black
No contender matched their vicious attack
Their desire to be equal to gods
Brought the fire, only nemesis holds.
