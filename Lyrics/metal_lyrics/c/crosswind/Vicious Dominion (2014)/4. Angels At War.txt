The day has come when the world's come undone
And the empires crash to the ground
No retreat neither win or defeat
Just an endgame planned aeons ago
look up and see that no longer we're free
But the lullaby's screamed in our hearts
Once you give in it takes over your mind
And its jaws will devour your soul
Swallow you whole

Flee from the shadow of liberty's death
Brothers unite in one breath
Sail under black sails and look for rebirth
Forge a new fate in your wake

Prophets appear as the end's drawing near
Just to keep you sedated and calm
Lost in haze all the masses in daze
In a reverie immersed all the time
All is lost who will cover the cost
Of the lives and the dreams trapped in stone
Reach in your hearts find the key to your past
Purge with fire with steel and with stone
Cut through the bone

Imprisoned souls all surrender their goals
All their hopes and desires are lost
Hands come bound as they scream with no sound
In a velvet walled prison confined
Find the source break away from this course
Once again stand united and tall
Rise up and fight and remember your might
you're descendants of gods not of ghosts forlorn
Angels at war
