As empires fall with a bang to the ground
As lives and lost dreams lay in ruins
Out from the Erebus shone a white light
A glimmer of hope shining bright
Waking the powers innate to them all
Gave them courage to walk through the fire
United as one they would rise to the stars
Gaining strength through the blood and the scars

Rise from the pain
Strong and mighty again
Brace and walk through the flames
Act as your fate proclaims.

Where is the fire within us?
Why have the aeons gone by?
When will we stay to fight for the day,
When truth's no more tarnished and frayed?
Never retreat from the battle,
Iron and flesh move as one,
Trust your own sight, strike down with might
Rush forth a kingdom of light

Unity in fear's not an act to revere
When all hope for a future is over
Hiding in shame, always shifting the blame
Never making a stand for what's real
Out of the shadows and into the light
Wage the fight for a brighter tomorrow
Free from the shackles
you thought were your own
Rip the jaws of the beast that enslaves.
