Drain you of life
Much like you've done to me
You're bleeding to death
The way I want it to be

You get to die soon
Consider yourself lucky
I've been dying so slow
Death sleeps beside me

Don't breathe a word of apology
I won't forgive your mental sodomy
Our love was filled with beauty
Consider this your eulogy

Paint a picture of life in full detail
Blood stains the white walls
In life's trust, we horribly fail
In death's grip, we will fall

Revenge is so sweet
The taste of your blood
Sucking down on your hateful
Crimson liquid

Your time has expired
You can no longer be
I give you no reason to live
Like you have done me

Flat is the line of your life
And my grip on reality
At the edge of the word
There is nothing

I stand over your corpse
Not a guilt, nor a care
Forever tortured in hell
I'm coming, I'll find you there.
