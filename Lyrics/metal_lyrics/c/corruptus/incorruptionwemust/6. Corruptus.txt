Youâll ask for guidance from above
But the world doesn't revolve around love
Itâs all about the money and greed to fulfil your every need
Because with Politicians like these around
The Christian message is always found
With moral hypocrisies Jesus was a man of peace

So Corruptus now before it's to late
Exploit our generation with religion and hate
Corruptus, Corruptus, go ahead
Corruptus like you've corrupted them

Conglomerates claim to go bankrupt
Some are legit, but many are corrupt
They pitch out a downsizing phrase
While the CEOâs give themselves a raise
The flags colours are red white and blue
Many have died for it so sad so true
Allowing corruption to go unseen
Turns our flag red black and green.
