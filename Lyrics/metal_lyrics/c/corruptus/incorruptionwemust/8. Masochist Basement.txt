In the basement he waits the night grows darker
His tortured mind tells him to cut deeper
There is nothing left now God is gone
He has it all but he doesn't deserve it
Loyal friends devoted parents all that is good he resents
The flag he sees as he vomits he bleeds

Masochism, self-injury
Cutting myself to punish me
It hurts me not my pain is my pleasure
Sucking our own blood, no one needs me
Who should care? My life is my own
Suicide will be the death of me

He sits there staring at his arms and his legs
With repulsion cut them slash them masochism
Break the skin slit the wrists bite the neck bloody fists
He regrets his friends and family cried
No need for help he says he's doing fine
He wont hurt himself again but you know he's lying

Watching the clock waiting for the moment
Wash the knives the skin make the incision
Scrape away the first three layers making sure to hit the vein
Drawing the blood that's why he's there of his own death
He has no fear he does it on his own in the masochist basement
