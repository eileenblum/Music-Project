The night is foggy the rain breaks the sky
My head is down but thereâs no need to cry
Youâve played with my mind and in my head youâll find
That I want to die knife at my throat tonight

I die. Iâm dead. Iâm guilty.
I die. Iâm dead. Iâm sorry.
Because I donât want to live anymore
Iâve got to kill myself kill myself
I donât want to live anymore
My last thought is I want to die

No more of my wants no more of my needs
I am done lying I am done hiding
How I really feel how I never healed
Now I am no more then the love that was yours

Knife reaching deeper Iâm feeling weaker
The blood is flowing the pain is growing
My end is right here but there is no fear
Because I know something once dead there is nothing
