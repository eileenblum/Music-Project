Why should I even fight it? this shit is out of line
I lost my soul and all control and all my piece of mind
My heart has been cut open itâs leaking like a sieve
I try to find the reasons but I've lost the will to live

Wake Up Wake Up Wake Up Screaming!
There is no relief for the fear youâre feeling
Wake Up Wake Up Wake Up Screaming!
If you think your safe, then youâre still dreaming
Wake Up Wake Up Wake Up Screaming!
There is no escape from the fear youâre feeling
Wake Up Wake Up Wake Up Screaming!
If you think your safe, then youâre still dreaming

There he lays awake in bed staring at the wall
Burning himself with a cigarette so his eyelids will not fall
His floor is strewn of coffee crystals and porno magazines
Anything to keep at bay the horrors of his dreams
