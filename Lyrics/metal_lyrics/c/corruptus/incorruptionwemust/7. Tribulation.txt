You call it life; I cut it down to simplicity
Life is a cycle, adventures in futility
Amidst recurring lapses of absolute depression
Comes a few moments without tribulation

For some the ignorance is truly blissful
Fool themselves into thinking life isn't so dismal
Cycle of hopeless future repeating a desolate past
Cruel truth of life the good times never last.
