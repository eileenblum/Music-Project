I cannot live without you I torture myself while you're away
I cannot think of life without you so why, did you leave me yesterday
There was no way I could have stopped you you determined death to be the only way
No matter how hard I tried to save you you had for me your last words to say

Good-bye my only friend live life long and well
No longer will I pretend that things havenât gone to hell
Politics and religion people Iâve had enough
Now it's to late for me but my friend, don't give up
Most live life afraid of death but death is where fear ends
Stop fearing the unlived life and everywhere it bends

You've left me with nothing but guilt and disbelief
I saw all your signs to you suicide is a relief
I want to be with you now more than anything
Suicide or life the choices I'm stuck between

Most live life afraid of death but death is where fear ends
Stop fearing the unlived life and everywhere it bends
I cannot be as cruel as you and leave my loved ones today
I will always remember you our love will never fade away
I thought I'd be enough for you to at least want to stay
I was there for you as you killed yourself that day
