I saw my mom, sleeping with some guy I never knew
I thought I was dreaming waiting for the nightmare to be through
But I was being naÃ¯ve everything I saw was real
My own mom, I couldn't believe how would my dad feel?

I yelled at her so loud what the hell are you doing?
Are you a whore are you proud itâs not just him you're screwing
I could not obey you mother when you told me what to do
Don't tell your father son I, I, love you

You don't love my dad anymore you don't love that other man either
I'm telling dad that you're a whore and that you are a deceiver
My dad killed her, sleeping I told him what I thought I knew
I didn't know I was dreaming now my nightmare will never be through
