Armed and dangerous and everybody runs
A kid gets bullied and answers with guns
A suburban war zone painted in red
Gunshot echoes; another child dead
Another hijacker on the freeway
A serial killer seizes the day
The truth about our society
Itâs on the news for all to see

We all let it happen everyoneâs to blame
With all the violence now it puts us all to shame
Time still passes by everything is the same
With all the violence around it puts us all to shame
