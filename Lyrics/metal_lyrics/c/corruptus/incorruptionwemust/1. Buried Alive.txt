You woke up in the darkness and you couldn't breathe quite right
You didn't know what time it was but you knew it wasn't night
You tried to move your arms but they were pinned up to your side
Your fingers scrape, there's no escape it's time for you to die

Buried alive, buried alive paralysed under the ground
Buried alive, buried alive rotting bodies all around
Buried alive, buried alive go ahead and cry
Buried alive, buried alive itâs time for you to die

A claustrophobic nightmare suffocating in this cell
Your hands are tied, youâre locked inside the rotting wooden shell
You scream until you're breathless but nobody is going to hear
You better say your prayers because the end will soon be here

Your body begins in spasms suffering from the fright
Breathing getting harder the coffin is airtight
Panic creates illusions of shovels digging overhead
Buried alive you wonât survive becoming the buried dead.
