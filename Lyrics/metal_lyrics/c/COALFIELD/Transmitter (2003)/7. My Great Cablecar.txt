Can you hear me? Just listen up. Can you hear me scream?
Tonight nothing matters tonight we give a damn shit about your plastic pride 1, 2, 3
The volume is on, the sound keeps beating, that's all I need.
All I have
Here it comes to an end the sick noise of voices running through my head
That predict the way it is already stopped
GO!
Tonight nothing matters
Tonight we give a damn shit about your plastic pride 1, 2, 3
The volume is on, the sound keeps beating, that's all I need.
All I have
