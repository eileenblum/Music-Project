I run again, still I'm nothing,
Falling for a second, which changed everything
I would burn it but for now I sell my black soul to you
A million eyes
Nothing could repeat this situation, nothing to repair in this situation
No need to conquer and no view in this situation
A million eyes I remember
A million eyes a million lies I remember
