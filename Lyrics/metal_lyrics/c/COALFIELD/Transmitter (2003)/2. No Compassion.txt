All those scandals all those wounds, they may not heal
Through the years my nervous breakdown grown
All my love already died
But some lights helped to get on the road again
Is my path? All those scandals they won't end
All those wounds they may not heal
It's at hand the enforsment erased every dream
I'm sure I've learned
Always one for one, always questions and contradictions
Content but obedient... I'd rather walk away with nothing
Choose my destiny
I'd rather spread my wings, fly away choose my destiny
Walk away, fly away, spread my fings, YEAH!!!
