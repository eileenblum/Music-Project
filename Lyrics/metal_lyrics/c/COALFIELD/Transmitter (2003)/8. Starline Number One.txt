Those empty streets and empty nights
Never keep me satisfied
Some faces follow those days to come
Where nothing is left
Ideals pushed me to break those icons.
I'm your star... My engines stopped
A flame burns low but forever the chords speak for me,
It's the point
I've Crossed so many times,
It's the point where I burn everything that tries to break my heart
Pictures leave in those times and weakness is all I get again.
- nothing to rely, only my own broken shape, forced to kill desires now
I'm your star. Star shine on, on and on, on and on.
I'm your star, I'm your star
