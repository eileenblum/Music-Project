This is a parade, we'll show their steril games, hide behind our heads
Keep up eternal flags
It all makes weak seven days a week, hour for hour we waste, we fade.
And the new superior attitude completes the scheme, the golden quest the end of a lifetime
Open trapdoors behind curtains reduced to a fool, reduced to fools.
It all makes weak, seven days a week hour for hour we waste we fade
The measure is high like a tower in a melting world of lies, we waste we fade away.
My offer to you, select your own medal.
