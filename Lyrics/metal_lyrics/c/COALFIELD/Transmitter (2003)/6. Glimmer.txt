Save your source
This mortal heart
Won't make a start
Just walk with fire, cause this is wasteland.
The bane won't end if you lose yourself in what you give -
Regret gets you at times, times where you can't change.
Stop your search for their impress, 'cause they won't care
And all you get is their mockery
At times where you can't change
At times where you can't faith,
(regret gets you)
Walk with fire, save your source
