The effect of cocaine is a feeling
That may be described
As a great amount of excitement and joy
You may have this high feeling within seconds or minutes of using cocaine
This feeling may only last for a few minutes
Or it may last for a few hours.
Because of how cocaine makes you feel
You may want to keep using more

How does cocaine work?

Your brain produces a substance called dopamine
Dopamine when you feel happy
After a time

The d'amine when you feel happy. After a time. [6x]

The dopamine decrease is because transporters knock out the dopamine
The transporters put the dopamine back in the area in your brain
Where it is kept until your next happy event
Cocaine works by keeping the transporters from mopping up the dopamine

By keeping the transporters from locking up the dopamine [3x]

While the dopamine stays free 
You have a feeling of great happiness or well-being
The first time you use cocaine
You will usually feel a great amount of excitement and joy
If you use cocaine a second time, you will probably not have the same effect
The high feeling may not be as strong and may not feel as great

Cocaine abuse is when ongoing cocaine use leads to problems being around others
