It's like whatever path we choose in this life this generation has been set to extinguish itself

Don't tell me how to talk or way to live my life
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
Every time I'm right a little part of you die
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
Should I ever be punished for crossing the line?
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
It was made for those who can't think for themselves
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit

(A little part of you) DIE! [16x]

You keep judging my process, never what I think
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
I'm just a drowning maggot in your world of life
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
You pretend to be god, you try to fuck me in the end
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
Consequence, I'll fucking shoot you in the head
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit

(A little part of you) DIE! [16x]

Red walls
It's revolution
Bring out the guillotine
Red walls
It's the final solution
Bring out the guillotine

Fuck that shit, fuck that shit [4x]

(A little part of you) DIE! [16x]

Fuck that shit

Red walls
It's revolution
Bring out the guillotine
Red walls
It's the final solution
Bring out the guillotine

(A little part of you) DIE! [8x]

Red walls
It's the final solution
Bring out the guillotine
Red walls
Bring out the guillotine

Bring out the guillotine
