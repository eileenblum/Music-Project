I'm cleaning out today
Now you can buy my soul
Everything must go
I'm closing down my life
I'm making room for a brand new show
It will consist of empty dreams
High fashion wars and dollar smiles
It will be filled with disco bombs
All I want is for you to be in the show
It's a matter of what I'll achieve
I'm all fucked up now I want you to care
Want it right now, I want you to care

Can I talk?
Or can I fuck?
And we're both so full of shit
Can't get the story straight
Can I talk?
Or can I fuck?
Oh, we're both so full of shit
Borrowed time...

In the pit
In the pit
Just like you
I'm in the pit just like you
In the pit just like you
In the pit
In the pit
I'm immoral body
In the pit
Bring me back in time
In the pit
Just like you
I'm in the pit just like you

I'm closing down my life
I'm making room for a brand new show
I'm closing down my life
I'm making room for a brand new show
I'm all fucked up now I want you to care
Want it right now I want you to care

Can I talk?
Can I fuck?
And we're both so full of shit
Can't get the story straight
Can I talk?
Or can I fuck?
Oh, we're both so full of shit
Borrowed time...

In the pit
In the pit
Just like you
I'm in the pit just like you
In the pit just like you
In the pit
In the pit
I'm immoral body
In the pit
Bring me back in time
In the pit
Just like you
I'm in the pit just like you
