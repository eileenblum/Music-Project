My mind is burning but my heart is still beating
The smoke chokes your breath
A torch in the dark
I'm just a corpse of my kind
Blinded by the light
The fear of failure keeps haunting my dreams
Expressing my demons
Burning through faith
Perfect self destruction
It's time to bury the dead

In your life are you connected to yourself? 
When you die will you be connected to yourself?
