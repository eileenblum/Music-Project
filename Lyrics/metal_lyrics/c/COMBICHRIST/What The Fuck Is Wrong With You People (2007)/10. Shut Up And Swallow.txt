"You know the truth."
"...Where are you?"
"You could call it the end of the world."

You fucking parasite
Feeding off my flesh like a leech
Sucking me dry
Here's some head
Hope you get it in your throat
Hope you gag and choke
Your pale little face turning blue

Now you want it in your ass, as I spit in your face
Face down on the floor holding you by your neck
Do you feel like a wreck?
No, that's life, kiddo
Now shut up and swallow
(swallow, swallow)
Shut up and swallow
(swallow, swallow)

You'll get nothing for free
Don't try to suck it off me
You always take you what you want
Now I just take what is mine
I'll get you after this
You tell of life..
It's up to you to fill it with substance
I'll play your game
A lesson of life: It's not what you want, but what you get
You'll feel it from within as I work my way out
Such a pretty girl, but such a dirty mouth

Now you want it in your ass, as I spit in your face
Face down on the floor, holding you by your neck
Do you feel like a wreck?
No, that is life, kiddo
Now shut up and swallow
(swallow, swallow)
Shut up and swallow
(swallow, swallow)

"Where are you?"
"You could call it the end of the world."
