Intolerance of glorified ignorance 
That sucked you down with your face pushed against the fence
Why don't you finish yourself, since you don't really care
Let the screams in your head be the last things you hear
Just give it a go

Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you

Fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you

Part of me (part of me)
Suffocate (suffocate) 
Tolerate (tolerate)
No one is innocent 

Experience (experience)
Intolerance (intolerance)
Familiar (familiar)
Screaming faces

No one is innocent

Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you

Fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you

Why don't you finish yourself since you don't really care
Let the screams in your head be the last things you hear

Hey you what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you what the fuck is wrong with you

Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you

Fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you
What the fuck is wrong with you

Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you

Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
Hey you, what the fuck is wrong with you
