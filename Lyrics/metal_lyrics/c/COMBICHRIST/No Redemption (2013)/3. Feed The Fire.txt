What if I was never broken
what if I was someone else
what if word was ment to be said but unspoken
and I would know what lays ahead

I had everything and nothing will remain
I torn apart rest of the word
and walked into the brawl of silence
and no god can heal our wounds

and this thoughts sense away
the dawn of a broken day
carries me away
what if I feed the fire

lined by your touch I fell behind
when a fist full of burns will .. in fire
in time we'll learn how to destroy your reflection
thought but truly my shadow was alone

I take my mask and place it in the dust
the sun burns through my shelter.
My flesh peels off.
there is nothing I can do
But embrace the pain as something new.

and this thoughts sense away
the dawn of a broken day
carries me away
what if I feed the fire

what if I'm not who I think I am
what if I am something else
what if I can prove to you
that I always been somewhere else
