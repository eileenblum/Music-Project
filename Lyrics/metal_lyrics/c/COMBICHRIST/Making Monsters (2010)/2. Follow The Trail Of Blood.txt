Follow the trail
The trail of blood
Crossing the line
Sickness of heart

And now you're nailed
Nailed to a cross
Covered in fuel 
About to ignite
You never listened
Never knew what I felt
Now you will burn
And your heart of ice will melt

Follow the trail
The trail of blood
Crossing the line
Sickness of heart
You know you failed
Failed to obey
You're obsolete 
On your knees
Can't walk away

You're obsolete, still killing me
In my head you're the enemy
You're obsolete, still killing me
In my head you're the enemy

You're waiting for change
Don't expect it from me
You're waiting for change
A thousand complaints
You never listened
Listened to me
It's always the same
Just set me, set me free

You're obsolete, still killing me
In my head you're the enemy
You're obsolete, still killing me
In my head you're the enemy

Follow the trail
The trail of blood
Crossing the line
Sickness of heart
You know you failed
Failed to obey
You're obsolete 
On your knees
Can't walk away

In my head you're the enemy
You're obsolete, still killing me
In my head you're the enemy
You're obsolete, still killing me
In my head you're the enemy
