They say its all over now, but I forgot how to play this game, and now I'm just a number
I close my eyes so I can see
Not always what we want to be - We turn it off, and pass it on - We have to die to feel alive
is this how we used to be
I seek control
Do you find yourself in me? Is this the last dance? Are you ready to betray me,
For more of yourself?
I seek control - I came so close - I seek control
