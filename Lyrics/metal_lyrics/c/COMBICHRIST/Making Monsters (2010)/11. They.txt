They wanna own you
And their screams are like thunder
You are losing your mind
And it makes you sick
A sickened soul
And your world is going under
Like you never existed
In this world at all

They wish, they want
They will and never quit
They wish, they will
They wish
They want, they will

They, they want it all
They, they got it all
They, a billion strong
Will destroy us all
Make us crawl

They, they want it all
They, they got it all
They, a billion strong
Will destroy us all
Make us crawl

The only way to stop it
Is to limit our desires
To strip us from power,
Regain control
You've never been me,
So you'll never understand me
I'd never been close enough to take the fall

Do you fear?
Do you feel?
Do you fear?
Do you feel?

Do you fear me?
Can you hear me?
Hiding in the shadow of the life they stole

They, they want it all
They, they got it all
They, a billion strong
Will destroy us all
Make us crawl

They, they want it all
They, they got it all
They, a billion strong
Will destroy us all
Make us crawl
