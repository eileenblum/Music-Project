I'll let this darkness last forever
Iâve been longing for tranquility
And somewhere deep inside of me
Thereâs room for sacrifice, a total war

I lick the blood of your lips
We fall to the ground
Dreams shattered away
On our knees on burning flesh
I'll let this darkness last forever

Slave to machine
Extermination
I'll let this darkness last forever
Destroy this world of dreams
[x2]

A seed within my mind
Hate grows roots
And leaves a trail
A memory of a stranger
The laughter in my head

Trembling hands covers the sun
It was all I had to offer
It was never supposed to be like this
An end, but not like this

Slave to machine
I'll let this darkness last forever
Destroy this world of dreams
[x2]

I'll let this darkness last forever
Destroy this world of dreams

Slave to machine
I'll let this darkness last forever
Destroy this world of dreams
[x2]
