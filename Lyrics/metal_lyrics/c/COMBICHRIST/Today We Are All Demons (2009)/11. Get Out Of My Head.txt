I know you're in there
Pulling strings
I know you're in there
Somewhere deep within
I know you're digging
Digging through my brain
Paranoid they said
Get out of my head!

I know you want it
I can feel you
Deep inside
Under my skin
I know you're starving
For the passion
But pleasure is dead
Get out of my head!

GET OUT OF MY HEAD

I've tried to kill you
Drugs, booze, and noise
Tried to forget you
But I still hear your voice
The headache getting worse
I wanna poison you with lead
Bring a .45 you said
Get out of my head
