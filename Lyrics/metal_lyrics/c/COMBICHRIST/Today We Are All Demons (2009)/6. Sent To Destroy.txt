Iron boots, we're walking tall
With pride we'll walk all over you
Steel grip, we'll hold you down
On a leash, we're coming through

Metal teeth, a diamond smile
Mechanical jaws, a 2 ton bite
With winter frost, an atomic pile
We stand the ground where the big dogs fight

Divine inferno
Hell on ice
Heaven's Burning
Sacrifice

Your God sent us to destroy

Nuclear war, behind glass walls
We long for the storm, we stray from our path
Feel the walls, closing in
Chasing our tails, feeding our wrath

Metal teeth, a diamond smile
Mechanical jaws, a 2 ton bite
With winter frost, an atomic pile
We stand the ground where the big dogs fight
