There is no stopping of what can't be stopped
There is no killing of what can't be killed
First kill; one kill

Slaves of the flesh of a thousand worlds
We live in fear and the pressure gets worse
Nothing will die, where there's nothing to kill
No way to stay alive where there is no will

There is no stopping of what can't be stopped
These is no killing of what can't be killed
First kill; one kill
