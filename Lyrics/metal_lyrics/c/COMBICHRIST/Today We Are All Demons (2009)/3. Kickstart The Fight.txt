Just one more shot girl, she said: Fuck yeah I'm down!
Insanity rules the world, I'll fucking die in this town

I'm here to fuck shit up, and I'm ready to go
A bottle or two, still nothing to show
She said: Drink up motherfucker, we're running out of time
She said: I wanna get wasted; you're my partner in crime!

We're not afraid, of a rumble, gonna kick it, all night
We're not afraid, of a rumble, here to kick it, kickstart the fight!

Alone we are trouble
Together we're at war
Apocalypse in every shot
And we'll be back for more

We're here to drink, fight, fuck, and we're ready to go
3rd bottle on its way and we're ready for the show
She said: Now listen to me fucker, I got nothing to lose
She said: Damnation's at the door and I brought the booze!
