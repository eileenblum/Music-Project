I gotta bring it
I gotta hold it
I gotta force it out, like it never happened at all
I need to be, I gotta hold it
I need to fail, and it's so sensational
And they sent you, through the ages
Now you want me, to restrain me
Tried to reach through, and I failed you
And now we're begging for more, I am here for you

Can't change the beat

Can't stand alone, we never did
Keeps me alive, as we begin
You oughta know, how we will starve
Aesthetic, let it, force it, never again

Can't change the beat
