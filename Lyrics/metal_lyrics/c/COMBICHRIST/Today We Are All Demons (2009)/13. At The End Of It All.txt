I carve your name
Straight across my wrist
Your voice bleeds through
Yelling out my name
Left with a choice
Stand tall or fall down
The laughter in your eyes
Now it's all the same

I would offer you my life
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see the world
As it's meant to be seen
What became of me
It never hurt like this
At the end of it all
A heartless machine
At the end of it all

Now I stand alone
At the end of it all

Everything I need
In front of me
What I want it to be
It cannot be
I never let it out
In secrecy
Within this world
Inside of me

Now I stand alone
At the end of it all
