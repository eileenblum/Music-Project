Do you ever get the feeling that everything in America is completely fucked up?

The choice you make
Will be your own
A pattern forms
Too scarred to feel

Too scared to follow
And so am I
Wisdom will cower
And so will I

Words breed lies
Beneath it all
Death in your veins
Life on your knees

The rain will wash me away
All structures collapse
Nothing covers my grave
Only destruction remains
