I need to taste you, your second skin
Every breath you take belongs to me
Sell me your soul for a life in sin
Discipline, the state of mind you're in

All the moans that you gasp are only for me
Obey, kneel down, I'm in complete control
Your body says stop while your eyes say go
Discipline, on your knees; I want your soul

There is no fear, tension will ignite
And there is no point, no use putting up a fight
Free yourself from mortal pain, no free will, no void to fill
Fantasy becomes reality, fulfillment through submission
