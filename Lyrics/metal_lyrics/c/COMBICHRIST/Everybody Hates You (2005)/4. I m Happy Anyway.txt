I got so much to say
But there's no point
I'll say it anyway
I'm so tired alone
If we are what we eat
I could be you tomorrow
There is a delay in my shadow
A delay in my mind
Laying on the floor in a pool of blood
I can see everything so clear now

I'm happy anyway [10x]

I got so much to say
But there's no point
I'll say it anyway
I'm so tired alone
If we are what we eat
I could be you tomorrow

I'm happy anyway [11x]

Anyway
