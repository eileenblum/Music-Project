"And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand 
that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command.
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti."

"Each day we will spill their blood
till it rains down from the skies!"

Last night my shadow went to heaven 
My body's here, my soul in hell 
Last night I killed, I can't remember 
Who I killed or why I laughed 
Last night was never supposed to happen
Today I woke to a rain of blood 
A rain of blood [3x]

"Each day we will spill their blood
till it rains down from the skies!"

I think I might have killed the world 
But anyway I'm better off alone 

A rain of blood
"Each day we will spill their blood
till it rains down from the skies!"
A rain of blood
A rain of blood

I think I might have killed the world 
But anyway I'm better off alone 
I'm better off alone
