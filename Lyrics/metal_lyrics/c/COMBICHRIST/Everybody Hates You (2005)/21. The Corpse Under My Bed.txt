One month in hell
one month in this--
exploding shells, cowering
prostrate bodies
waiting to join them
to join your comrades
still agonizing
already dead.

Then our
counter offensive
a last attempt to escape from the trap
we'd set our selves
civilians
women and children
slaughtered like cattle
were they our enemies?
their cities burnt to the ground
cities like ours
senseless
needless!
..hopeless
