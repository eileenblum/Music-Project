Here you go, here's one covered in blood, babe
Do you think he is dead?
Do you think we can leave him like this or
Should we chop of his head?

I know you like it when I'm covered in blood
On your knees with a gun to your head
I let you know that you no means yes, babe
And your tears are fake

The night is young, is there anything else we can do for fun?
Kill a body of doom
Fucking high on the tomb
Make you gag on a gun

Feed your anger

A real demon girl, why don't you soak that angel's wings in blood?
I know you're ready for this
I've seen you waking your lips
All you need is to nod you head

Feed your anger, feed your anger
Feed your anger, feed your anger
