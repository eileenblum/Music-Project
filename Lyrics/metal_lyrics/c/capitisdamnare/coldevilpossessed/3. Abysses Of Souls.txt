Fallen into deep Depression, tortured by your own Mind
A dark Power rises from the Abyss of your Soul
Possessed your Brain
Like a Demon it speaks to you, let you doing Things you never want to do
The Abysses of Souls, the Root of Evil
The Abysses of Souls, the Home of the blackest Minds
It holds your Mind in it's black Claws
Hate yourself for what you think
The War in your Soul destroys you
End your Life!!
The Abysses of Souls.......
Make a Journey inside yourself
You can't believe, but it is the Beast of your own
