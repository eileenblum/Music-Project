Hate the eyes of mercy
Hate the infants' cries
Hate the hordes of weakened minds
Hate the whores

Worship all destruction
Love to hate
Salute lack of emotion

Salute charred remains

Awaiting the wicked - the ancient ones
Stand proud and praise your chalice

Search your brain for reason
And find you're totally insane

Fill your soul with pure destruction
Then paint your smile with sheer decay
