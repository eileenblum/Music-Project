Revealing the secrets
Of my past-life subconsciousness

Entering, unfolding
What wasn't pleasant to be

Unborn fantasies
How life came to be
What they didn't see -
A guide by our destructive enemies

Obsessed by the negative
Of underestimating my grin
Beholders of lies

Pretending, defenders
Believing their own disguise
The others made that sin
I'll win I'll win
See me coming through
