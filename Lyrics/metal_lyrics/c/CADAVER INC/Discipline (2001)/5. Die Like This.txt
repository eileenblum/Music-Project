Mortified on the killing fields
A slaughtered army rests
In their eyes - pathetic cries
The final bloodbath

Nuclear massacre
Death destruction
Global genocide

Fester - mankind
World - decompose
Oceans set afire

Elegance of ruins
Glory of silence
Concluded the war

Now raise the trident
Of humans and sunlight
Praised be the fall
And all of nature
This, the last genocide is music to death's ears
