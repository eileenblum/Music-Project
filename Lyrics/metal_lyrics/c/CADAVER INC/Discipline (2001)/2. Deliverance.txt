Extracting placidity
Absorbing the rage
The roads to obscurity
Are sordid from putrid taste

Exhuming iniquity
The eraser of grace
Mounting in purity
Like fountains of primal hate

A breath of satisfaction in the glory of pain
The corroding rain makes fractions
In the solvent ways of death

The laughter joins the vastness
...Ablaze the hurricane
Discordant strings repowered
... Refuels our primal faith...
