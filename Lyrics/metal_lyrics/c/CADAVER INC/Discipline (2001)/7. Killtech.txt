Wrapped up in tubes naked
How will I survive?

This torment I'm living towards the day I die
Cold metal strapped around my body, legs and bones
Carving in my flesh, the more I try to get free

Kill tech death machine
The end is closing in

Existing only through the gruesome pain
I'm living beyond the edge of the insane
Nightmares are flaring through my endorphins
Pleasures of the pain, I no longer care

Kill tech death machine
I'm finally insane
