Hole through the mirror
The fence of scattered time
Crude, relentless sinner
Let the murderhead rise

Torn and mangled carcass
Turns his frenzy to a sign
Greet the worms a welcome
Treat them with its cries

Heretic battering
Dissolves the wretched corpse
He's the scorn tormentor
morbid frenzied ritual

Bestial avenger, trapped in time
Bestial with anger, mortuary carnivore
