Harvested like the untrodden ground
In labs &amp; medical think tanks
Used &amp; new body parts to reconstruct humanity
The wealthy sit first in line
Having already decimated their health
Through wretched irresponsible excess
Buying back what has already faltered
Doctors resort to genetic replacement
Invoking the cursed unrestricted advancement
Of biological medical harvesting
The cloning &amp; animal torture
Soon transferred onto humankind
Manipulating the pools of gene splicing
We see our human frame reduced to spare parts
Incubation of the festering evolution of fools
