Finally some admissions are made
The destiny of waste overflows
Some new policy of retribution
Dealt out a necessity
The children are coughing up truths
Laying sick in hospital rooms
Partners cry at their misery
As misfortune crashes down
Their total disregarded exceeds
All the suffering that they incur
Bulldozers came to excavate
The solvent laden soil bleeds
Through government closed water wells
Clean up their correction, kill the town
The rank &amp; file politicians
Collect their alibis as one
Protected by jailed lobbyists
A sealed informant owned
Corrupt enough to fabricate
But evasion is the oldest trick
Deny the lucrative land dealings
&amp; just never admit their total disregard
Exceeding criminal acts &amp; intentions
So they cover their ass with government cash
Send out the crews in the dead of night
Erase the seeds of their neglect
&amp; the rushing carcass of society
Into the sea
