Gutter ruined remnant of life
Lost it all in no time
Broken rigs lay empty yet still fatal
Days die, pride lies
Smelling ripe, scared to sleep
On the street is a battered habit
A trial you endure daily
Hide your shit in doorways
All resolve stands to the side
Missing all your spokes
Living in a urine sewer
Cheat everyone you know
Cold in your urban terror
