The lawyers can smell the writhing corpses
&amp; manufactures smell a cost cutting sham
It's aimed at our willingness to consume
Any hyped commercial brainwashing
The tests are hastily advanced
Dollar waste to transact
At our expense pain retains rent
Toward collision, towards earth sent
Choke on their fake facts
We are at the mercy of cost effective negligence
Too late, an irretrievable loss
We can't recover
