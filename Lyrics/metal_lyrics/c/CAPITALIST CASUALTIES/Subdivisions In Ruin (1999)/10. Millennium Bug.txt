The prophets laugh at this comedy
Tragedy begets the under laying irony
Canvassing our wonders in darkness
Humanity grid scared like rats
The extinguished light of civility
Crawling the gutters for answers
Feeding of the hopeless population
Lost in the machines
Deserving of this collapse
We fail to breathe on our own
