The veins of human servitude
Injected &amp; running black
The desolate things of society
Inside tomb-like rows
Dollar trust in flames
Luxury ceased, we go to great lengths to pollute our compulsive breath
We lay our future exposed
Like addicts we daily depend
We sit &amp; watch wars
They are a lax excuse for our corrupt need
