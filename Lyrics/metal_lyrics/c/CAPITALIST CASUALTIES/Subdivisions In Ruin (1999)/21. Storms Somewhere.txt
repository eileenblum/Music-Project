Locked &amp; hidden in closets
The children stare in horror
Domestic violence only tells so much
Enduring silence &amp; unspoken words
The pigs are there for entertainment
To show America the trash
It's on display, everyday
Watching a family disintegrate
Recording the tragedy in faces
Scorned &amp; beaten
Mistreated abusive violence
Is it entertainment, or society falling out?
In foster homes they still hear the wars
In silence &amp; in darkness
The quiet stirs anxiousness
The slurs &amp; beating are much louder
&amp; never, ever forgotten
