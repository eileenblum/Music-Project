This complication of job culture
We condone its ingrained course
Why we hold so dearly this raping
By the fossilized ethic of pride through work
We carry the concrete on our backs
The worn out basis of capitalist grief
We struggle through days of poverty line pay &amp; laborers pain
Caustic reminder of lost days
We struggle, at war with good wealth
Turning our minds in constant turmoil
The world seems closed &amp; conceit infects
Can't channel the anger &amp; nothing resets except the days
Look to vacate, but duty condescends the freedom to act
Paycheck insults
A wage for a dog
Driven by industry &amp; the collapse of thought
The clocks &amp; alarms can't awaken the fog
Extermination through labor is all you can afford
Only satisfied by the familiar
We prepare the death costs unquestioningly
We retire in 5 &amp; die in 10
Lie, buy, rape, sty
An exercise in futile strife
