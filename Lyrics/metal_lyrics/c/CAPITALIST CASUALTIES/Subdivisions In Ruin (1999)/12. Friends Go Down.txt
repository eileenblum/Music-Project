They made you into something
I don't fucking recognize
Drained all the thoughts, inducted &amp; now baptized
In this state I face your change
&amp; look away in disgust
No mind left
Just suits &amp; lies &amp; the disruption
Of the person I knew

Closed &amp; quiet &amp; tame [2x]
Tamed in your shameful dead submission
Locked down in this cage, no outlet for rage
Rupture the life in you, it spills out on the floor
I won't follow you down this shit
I won't listen to your shit

People fall off everyday, I didn't think you would
The crop society says is right is wrong
Just like it should be
I'll let you go
Because you're not worth saving anymore
Your mind went soft
&amp; your heart stopped beating years ago

Closed &amp; quiet &amp; tame [2x]
Tamed in your shameful dead submission
Locked down in this cage, no outlet for rage
Rupture the life in you, it spills out on the floor
I won't follow you down this shit
I won't listen to your shit
