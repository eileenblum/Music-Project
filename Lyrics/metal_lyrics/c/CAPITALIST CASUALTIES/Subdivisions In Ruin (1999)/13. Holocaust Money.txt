The remittance will never subsist
The borrow of tragic history
Intent on the creation of falsehoods
&amp; funding fascist fugitives
These banks hold countless deaths
In their vaults &amp; accounts
Continuum of the gas chambers
Constant replay of the worst injustice
Repay in complete shame
Those whose ghosts torture your history
Holocaust money
Reaped off the dead
Collaboration of thieves
