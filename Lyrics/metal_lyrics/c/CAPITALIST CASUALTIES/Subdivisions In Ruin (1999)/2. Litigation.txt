Traffic the disputes towards litigation
Ten percent taken under contract of law
Face the client, smiling your arrogance
Shatter their will, hope deprivation
Criminal indifference while victims are buried
Your service decides lives, your reticence to comply plays with the fates of people who only want their promised justice
&amp; only to relieve their suffering
They must deal with your pompous truths
Receive the bloated systems judgement
Pay the greed manufactured law
Triumph of wealth over shit
They don't give you a fucking ounce of respect or humanity in court
You're guilty whenever they decide
