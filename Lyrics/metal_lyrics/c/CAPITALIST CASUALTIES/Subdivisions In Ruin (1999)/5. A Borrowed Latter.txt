On paper, a battalion of manipulation
Upgraded is a caricature second to none
Birth certificates
Social security numbers of the dead
Reiterate state records &amp; government files
Unbroken identity is ones name maligned
A petulant credit history reborn, hopefully unseen
Tomorrow your future is just a state or even a phone call away
Unsuspecting faceless targets
Criminal endeavor is transformed
So, for the record, it starts again
