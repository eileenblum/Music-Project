Distrust has become second nature
Correspond the lies to fit your life
Bastards overkill this social infection
Everyone knows &amp; everyone accepts
Public mistrust
Mouths are shut
Backs are turned, another burned
When enough mannequins spit out shit sympathy cannot be felt for real
When the population must beg &amp; steal any kind if meaningful truth
We react, know what is false is now fact
With so much garbage in our face
Why believe in anyone?
Why believe in anything?
The truths will be re-recorded to fill in the blanks
