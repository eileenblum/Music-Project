Politics belie their education
Outdated &amp; abused it's our foundation
Loading up money for metal detectors
Rape in the halls, pipebombs in lockers
Stifling new ideas with the cash in the hands of administrators
Fossilized textbooks are barley affordable
Piss-poor tenured teachers crush new ideas
Holding onto their jobs through politics
While drugs are sold everywhere
Curriculum money disappears
The decay in schools tells the terrible truth
Bureaucratic bullshit is everywhere
