The sadness in the procession's eyes
Hides behind some lost valor
Resurrected from battles coerced
The betrothed faces of conflict
Praise the flag &amp; recite the prayer book
&amp; look down into the graves for some sort of meaning
See the horrors in memories
On the lips of the sacrificed
The speeches lie of state &amp; Christ
The false heroism of a thousand dead
The impending fascist replies
The answers lay buried with the dead
Upon the fields of criminal blood
Beset by the tragedy of nations on financial ruin
Within the palaces of polluted lands
Is the carving of a warton sickness
Face their imminent dismantling
Marched into death
Instilled pride as breath
Like good soldiers
