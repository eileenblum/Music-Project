Torture falls daily on the population
Fallen idolaters take the returns
Processed in humanless painted hallways
Trash offered a cheap existence
The forms tear down your character
See how worthless your life really is
Laid out in figures &amp; biographies
Examined by the faceless worker
Processed &amp; filed into emptiness
Never to be redeemed
They won't help the fallen without stress
&amp; will only let induction into the system
Lead to another broken life
