The bodies turn up daily
Displayed in graphic representation
Lining the southern borders
Refugees meet American patrols
Enforcing the racist agenda
Of patriots &amp; Christian whites
The media cries "serial killer"
A likely case of disinformation
&amp; the cause for the dismissal of clues
Against a well-known army of sanctioned bigots
Are these people being hunted by state (&amp; corporate)?
Approved murders
Loaded with complex war technology &amp; entrusted
To guard this country's southern border with force &amp; prejudice?
Border patrols have have consistently been accused
Of robbing &amp; taping those trying to cross into the U.S. from Mexico
This recent rash of murders has cast its horrible light upon the patrols, despite government plotted disinformation to twist the blame away
Another day the sub rises upon the murdered
Another day of no evidence &amp; too any questions
