You blame your biased ideals on how you were raised
On bible class chains you're a dutiful slave
The inbred American way
Instilled from your goddamned very first day

Raised ignorant [3x]

Hold your cross up high
On the battlefield where you've gone to die
The bodies of belief pile high
To uphold the worthless son of lies
The sanctity of your being
Does not require this spiritual prison
Let alone this religious fiction

Your puritan zeal hides your perversion
It hides your vanity, greed &amp; indulgence
Sick preacher of intolerance
Racism strengthens your pious convergence
To self-appointed guardian of a "right-thinking" resurgence
Sensor of cultures
Your God won't return to rescue your worthless sect
Go to hell prophet of slavery
On the same day God created his biggest lie
In 1993 individuality dies in the
Sty of Christ [3x]
