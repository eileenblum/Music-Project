An old house in a forgotten part of town
Dog shit on the ashtray carpet
They've been up for four days
Their porous veins would take anything you've got

Drug culture [3x]
If you quit you'd still have nothing
Plastic bag purchases behind closed
Doors in plain view
Dealing escape or minimum wage
Which would you rather choose
25 bucks for you blanket of warmth
The gravel voice doesn't think
Vomit in the bathroom sink
No waiting but you're still anxious
Control crumbles in this wasteland
Garbage can for human beings
The house is your only safety
For the ritual at hand
No one gives a shit if
You pass out on the floor you're in the
Drug culture
