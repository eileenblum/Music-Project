Basing &amp; harassing to prove that you're a man
Screaming for your equal rights, an Aryan homeland
Societies ill caused by the colored man?
The Jew took your wealth?
You need someone to hate, to hide that you just hate yourself
Fighting to preserve a nation?
Insecurities
When was this an Aryan nation?
Insecurities
Why do gays threaten you? Why do you even care?
Brainwashed man like daddy, or that dress you want to wear
Fear of your own reality, insecurities
Like your father was afraid of his own reality, insecurities
Hypocrisy written all over your face, you decide what's right
Living in a panic, get a fucking life
The chapters of your white trash existence read like empty pages
A grim reminder of the solitude &amp; the spite you incur on others
You insecure bastard
Your lifestyle is timeless in the America of today
The simpletons, the falsehoods with which the road is paved
You carry on this lie that your children will surely continue
Burying your family name, burying your endless shame
&amp; television will guide them just like it brainwashed you
Continuing the 'tradition' until your lineage is complete
&amp; I won't shed pain for you
I won't even pity you
Another dead fucking fool
Insecure brainless tool
