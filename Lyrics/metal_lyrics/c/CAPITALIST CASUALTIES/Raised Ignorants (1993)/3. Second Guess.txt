White guilt and sympathy
When you people whoring on the street
Stop your worthless empty words
You racist armchair politician
You can second guess the rioting
All you fucking want
At least its people doing something
Instead of sitting on their ass
Comparing their ignorance, luxury and security
With status provided by the TV screen
I'm not surprised when you say you can't relate
Comforting yourself with apathy
You've forgotten how to hate
You can second guess charity
But when have you ever really experienced need?
When have you experienced anything?
You took the first option because you were scared
Scared you'd become what you feared most
Having to rely on yourself instead of someone else
You're taken for granted and you don't care why
Pad yourself with protection, money secures
You'll second guess when it crashes and fall hard
You'll second guess the options &amp; take the loss
I hate you pathetic new age morals
Your utopic philosophy is crap
How could anything trust humanity
Violent act after violent act
