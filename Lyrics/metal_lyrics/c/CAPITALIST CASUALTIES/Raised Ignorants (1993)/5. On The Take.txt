Man lies, man learns, man dies
One nation under a so called God
Who claims to hold the seeds of tranquility
Excusing debris caused from self-righteous leaders
Happy-go-lucky, merica's morale
Too rich &amp; greedy, tradition &amp; style
Under pressure
Dedicating simply a must
Oh say can you be more realistic
You've been forced &amp; pissed on
Yes, strategically erased
Some have a problem to where there's no competition
Milk cartons for ID's, nowhere is safe
Your taxes for everyone's defense
Should I think beyond the 90's or play dead?
From decades of devastation &amp; rot
Just remember, everyone takes a fall
Exchange excuses for wrinkles
Not thirty yet
A grand illusion, stability
As life passes you by
Personal dependencies &amp; cliques
Procedures, formations, a boss for a dick
God almighty psychiatrist grandpa in the sky
State conventional anti-depressant explodes on you
Staring in the mirror waiting for yourself to show
A struggle for inches &amp; miles they take, they take
Pledge allegiance, the new order is main stream
The future America, far gone corporation consumption
Television dialogue, rent cheap
Just sit &amp; watch on the take
