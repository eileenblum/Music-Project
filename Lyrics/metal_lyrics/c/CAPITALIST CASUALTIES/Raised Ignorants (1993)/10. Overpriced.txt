How much does it cost?
How many homeless turn up dead
Frozen or murdered on newsreel footage
How many children are beaten to death for your entertainment?
This is the capitalist nation we've bred
With commercials on television exacting our blood
Cutting off the impoverished
Dealing tranquility
Doused in tradition
That for most is unaffordable
Stability is overpriced
Trapped in the safety net
That's designed to catch them
The ignorant America
The gutter of the unnamed the aberration of this machine
Is its neglect of its working parts
