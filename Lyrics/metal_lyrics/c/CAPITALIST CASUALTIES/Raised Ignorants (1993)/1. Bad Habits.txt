New years resolution
Stop this crybaby shit
Of course only after one
More unfiltered cigarette
It's so hard not to break the
Chains of dominoes
Addictions, bad habits
So hard to break
Rainy days and up all night
Anticipation of blood-shot eyes
Burnt spoons, lies and deceits
All my friends are gone
Gas station feed for breakfast
Meth amphetamines for lunch
Uphill climb for forgiveness
Your bathroom is my shitter
