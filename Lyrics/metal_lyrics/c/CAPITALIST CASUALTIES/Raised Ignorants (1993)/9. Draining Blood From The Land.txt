Chop the forest &amp; drain the Earth
Capitalist don't care when money's the word
Land developer? What a fucking lie
Improve you cash intake, improve your life
Draining blood from the land
All Earth's resources traded for cash
Economic insanity
Causes this sick dilution
Twisted into pollution
The ending of the ages
Too far gone, natural castration
Too far gone, self immolation
