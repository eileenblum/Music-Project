American cop in Iraq
Torn to shit by Sunni rounds
No parade for his shattered frame
No burial for America's shame
Frag the cop
Close down shop
Suicide mission when at home
Locked the bedroom, pistol at his throat
No blood for oil, blood for pain
Misery increased wife and kids pay
Camo fatigue
Head shots bleeds
Homecoming was not to be expected
Now in a prison of mind and soul
Fortunate son, gunned himself down
Pride and prejudice eating dead bodies whole
Surge in effect
Leaders derelict
Surge in effect
Leaders in derelict
