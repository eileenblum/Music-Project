Silent death that floats
Off the Great Barrier Reef
This man killer is rarely found
They shun the deep water
Ever so clever as they hug the shore
Only the size of a thumbnail
People clamored for a cure
A sting from the tentacle is
A potent cocktail of toxins
Irukandji syndrome is pain, anxiety, paralysis
One square inch of tentacle contains
Five million harpoon-like structures
Billions of stinging capsules called nematocysts
The fastest mechanism in the animal world
Six species of this tiny killer
Have opened up Pandora's Box
There is no cure for the unholy pain
That racks your entire body
Mother Nature's perfect cover for the perfect crime
