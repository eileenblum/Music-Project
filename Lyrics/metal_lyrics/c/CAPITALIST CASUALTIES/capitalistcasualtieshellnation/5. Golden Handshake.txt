Termination of employment
Days spent in a cubicle
A significant severance package
An executive employment clause
You spent the last 15 years
Thinking your dedication would be
Rewarded with the golden handshake
Supposedly providing for four years
Of corporate enslavement
Carpet pulled from under your feet
All that time &amp; effort
Consumed the best years of your life
