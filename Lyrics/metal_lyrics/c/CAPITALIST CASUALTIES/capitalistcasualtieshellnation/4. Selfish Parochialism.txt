Laid waste in the dirt
Government and incompetence collide
Greed led to crap, engineering mishap
Crave the incoming blood money crap
Money grab
Country on a slab
No one to collect the lives that lay wrecked
Agency clones lose all control
Governors bicker, cash disappears quicker
Stolen by frauds and political mobs
Disaster replenishes the coffee of liars
Waterboarding the last living desire
American disgrace as our cities flood and fire
Money grab
Country on a slab
