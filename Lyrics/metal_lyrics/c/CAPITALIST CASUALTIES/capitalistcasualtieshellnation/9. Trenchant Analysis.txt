Power has many whores
Those that beg, those that kill
They screen the nightly bullshit
Starved nation swallows it whole
Until the next distraction
Sold your self absorption
The scrutiny of vultures
Cleared for daily airtime
Spin the White House drivel
You'll see what they want
Until the next distraction
Kills your motivation
