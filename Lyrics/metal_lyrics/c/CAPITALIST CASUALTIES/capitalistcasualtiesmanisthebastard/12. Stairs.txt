Dragged through a sea of broken glass
White collar dreams will nail my ass
For there to be a top there's got to be a bottom
They can't feel because their minds are rotten
Pulled in &amp; beaten
I'm not a stepping a stone
Why am I bleeding?
My flesh &amp; blood won't make your throne
Corruption increases
Climb the ladder of life with fatal blows
I'm not competing I'm don't watch them
