No more lies, burn the plastic flag of unity
Wall of trash is all I see, ideas live in atrocity
I never needed you before so why would I need you now?
Cut the ties that didn't exist, your moral standards are full of shit
Fighting a war inside your head
The gain of others is your loss
In competition with the world
The mirror is your nightmare
You are not my friends, you never were my friends
You are not my means
You are not my way
Afraid to be yourself although you claim not to conform
Into your bleeding wounds of jealousy
Is the said of your self-doubt, burning
Fuck you motherfuckers
Two-faced motherfuckers
