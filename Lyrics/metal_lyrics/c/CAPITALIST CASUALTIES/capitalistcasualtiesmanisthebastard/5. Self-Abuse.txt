Failure is all I see
Beaten down I begin to bleed
Looking up to face the enemy
There is no one there
Pushed &amp; pulled by animosity
In a living Hell I made just for me
Self-inflicted wounds will be my fall
There is no escape from the mental wall
&amp; I won't let you in
Because I dwell in self abuse
Failure is all I see
&amp; I'm not where I want to be
A time bomb from anxiety
My episode excuse
The realm of my security is
Life sucking self-doubt negativity
No one expects anything from me
&amp; my violent mood swings won't let me be
&amp; I won't ever change
Because I dwell is self-abuse
Failure is all I see
Beaten down I begin to bleed
Looking up to face the enemy
There is only me
