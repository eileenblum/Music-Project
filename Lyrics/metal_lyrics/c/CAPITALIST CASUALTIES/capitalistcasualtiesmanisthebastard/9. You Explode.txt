The dreams all turn to fucking dust
The anger towards others blows a hole in your head
The pressure of a world burning out of control
The prospect of dying before you're born
You explode, your final flame
&amp; when they clear away the bodies
&amp; wash the blood away
You'll soon be forgotten anyway
