Pain from my ears
Turn off the radio
Bleeding from my eyes
Turn off the video
Woe &amp; suffering
Death by the media
Desensitize the masses
Killing is okay
Murder media coming 24/7
Conditioning to accept our society
Violence means ratings, rating mean money
They don't even care that they're causing crime to rise
