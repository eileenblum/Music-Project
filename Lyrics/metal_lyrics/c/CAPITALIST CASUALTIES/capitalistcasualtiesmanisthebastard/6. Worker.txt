Tension builds the wall
Imagined pains, nothing hold you
The worry never dies, everyone lies
The stress always tries to bring you down
The workplace owns you but you're bribed with cash
To take all the blame when their world goes wrong
When you finally relax you need prescription drugs
You turn off the world until the alarm clock breaks the trance
You pass out when you get home
&amp; drink all alone, disconnect the phone
&amp; let the T.V. dull your brain
Break the wall
Worker, nothing holds you
