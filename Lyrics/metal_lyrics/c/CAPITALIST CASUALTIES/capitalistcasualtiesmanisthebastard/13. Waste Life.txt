The concrete walls surround me
My life had no room to breathe
Senseless structure
Incarceration
Booking number, not a name
Just a statistic
The minutes like hours &amp; days like months
Someone please pinch me I want to be waken up
Taken for granted is your worthless small life
&amp; your cell becomes the Devil
Wasted life
No self purpose just being locked down
The fucking D.A. is a liar
Doing hard time is a proportion of your life that are so long
Gone, far gone &amp; missed
