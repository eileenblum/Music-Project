Was home worse than this?
Nothing's worse than this
Your innocence
Has been disfigured
The violated virgin cries
It was given do unwillingly
The camera rolls as the John puts the gun to your head
Goodnight little one
The owner collects on you
The prey is so helpless
To please &amp; pleasure
Now you can't measure
The pain you feel everyday
The market is so full
Of children just like you
Waiting to be bought
