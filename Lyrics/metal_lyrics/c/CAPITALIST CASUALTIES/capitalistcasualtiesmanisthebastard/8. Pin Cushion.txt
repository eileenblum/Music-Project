Pin cushion
Let me stick
A needle in your vein
I won't sell my syringes for fucking shit
I want all junkies off my back
Trying to find a point in my fat
Can't live without a single injection
You're learning how to bleach
Just excited about a high
Shoving shit in your arm
A vein is hard to find
Let's injects 50 United towards a fix
Micro-fine needles, just like death
Air bubbles have no understanding or excuse
Your blackened arm show from drug abuse
I can't wait to kill the lights
Your face is turning blue
You're almost dead
You're a mistake
You're real fucking high
Never been this high
Finally high
Now you die
