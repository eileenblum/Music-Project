People
Exposed to the fading light
Do not walk our path
Two tragedies are over
And time has past
Fading memories of people
Rewritten peace

Thing that wait in the end of journey is the endlessly dark
Anything doesn't remain there
There is not even light that shines on the land
Tears that he shed in the silence are color of blood
Hope is in the end of sky
Despair named justice

Depressed mind
Never ending vanity
Never ending destruction and chaos
Hope becomes shining blade and stabs my skin
Unforgivable absurdity
Painting the future black that we thought we trusted
The land will be closed forever
Time we fear the collapse in silence

Manipulated reality
Paradise controlled by darkness
Chasing the pleasure before our eyes
Cling on to the decayed glory
The traveler stops walking
And looks up at the gray sky
Layers of barren field
To look for the time to retrieve
Set out on a journey again

Judgment day will come
Balance of collapsed life
See the people deforming
We become aware
End is near

Can't control emotion
Can't find own rule
What people see
We figure time is over

To maintain silence
Fear hope
Get out of here immediately
Without footprints
Without scar

People
Exposed to the fading light
Do not walk our path
Two tragedies are over
And time has past
Fading memories of people
Rewritten peace

Thing that wait in the end of journey is the endlessly dark
Anything doesn't remain there
There is not even light that shines on the land
Tears that he shed in the silence are color of blood
Hope is in the end of sky
Despair named justice

Expression filled with insanity
Ecstatic smile of the dictator
The shadow of who writhe in the darkness of blood soaked history
Ruse and pillage
Fear and blind faith
Hypocrisy and information manipulation
The world at its hand

Cruel reality
Shine of soul was lost
Tak a look at the expressions of the children before us
Against the cruel reality
Rise up again
Gods bringing the hammers down
Even the lights disappears

To maintain silence
Fear hope
Get out of here immediately
Without footprints
Without scar

Shadow has fallen
Long way of journey
Days of lost freedom
I lay myself on the ground
Wait for the peaceful moment...
