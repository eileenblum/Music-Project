Indulged in lust and greed
Defiled soul
Sinful one who brought corruption
Say, you judge before tasting the water?

Rusty people break old rules
And long for wealth and fame
For their land of peace
Disgrace the gift of land

Tombstones to deceive the weak
Destination for the travel of the defiled soul
Polish to deceive
King's assasin

Roar of the soul yet to be ceased
To the land of hope
To the end of the ephemeral darkness
Moonlight lights my dreams

Ridicule to deceive the weak
Sinful one's destination
Filled at the bottom of darkness
Wise men who rule contradiction

In the hands of
The sinful one
Tightly gripped
Lust
Symphony of destruction echos continuously
In the passing time
Destination of power

The roaming of the soul still continues
The end of the last movements of the ph?tus
Quest for truth in my mind
Liberation of the sky is drawing near
