Saigo ni ano yama no itadaki o mezash'teitai
Koko ni aru subete no kuuki o ooi tsukusu hodo no ashioto ga kikoeru
Sore wa hitorigoto datta kamoshirenai
Tash'ka ni ano toki doko kara kayattekite
Koko ni ita no darou
Koush'te wazuka na jikan ga nagareta dake de
Sude ni ushinawareteshimatta
Kioku soko ni wa honrai arubeki
Sugata nado kage sae mono kosanai
Hajime ni soko ni nanika o souzou shiaru ga yue ni sorera o motometa
Arasoukoto o oboe-ubai
Aukoto o shiru
Kizutsukerukoto ni yorokobi o motome
Shinjirukoto o wasurete
Ware-ware o tsukasadoru kotoba to iu sube o kuukyo e toshinkasaseta

[Blood]

Lastly, I've been wanting to aim for that mountain top
Footsteps are heard that greatly sap the air from everything here
They may have been my own
Surely, where ever I was coming and going from that time,
I think I was here
In this way, only a little time has passed, and regrettably,
Is already lost
The memory, essentially, should be there
Not so much as a figure's shadow passes by
First I imagine something there and consequently, I sought it out
Disremember the competition
Know the bad experience
Seek pleasure in the wounding!
Forget the beliefs!
We allowed the controls that are our government edicts to come to nought!
