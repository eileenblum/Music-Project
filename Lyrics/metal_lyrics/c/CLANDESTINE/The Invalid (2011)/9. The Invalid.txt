Too much time Iâve wasted
This barely breathing life out of shape
The ceilingâs falling down
Every night when I close my eyes
Bury me inside the concrete tomb
Where I canât hear the voices that arenât there
Iâm steady enough
Iâm ready to go to the other side

Just keep searching for the right ending
And cease my heart distending
Itâs filled with toxication
And it killed the last intention
To keep on breathing and fighting
Really I want no more

Trial makes me paralyze
In denial of my concession
In self-destruction I feel no more pain
Iâm leading this life to where it in fact belongs

Give me self control
Outlive my obsession
Misguide me into obscurity
There I relive myself once again

Let me out of this
Prisonâs my body
Tears my soul apart
Iâm screaming inside out
