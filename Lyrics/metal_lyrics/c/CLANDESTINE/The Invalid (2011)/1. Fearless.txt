It fades away from me
When I taste my fame in the darkness
Where no one could ever find my trace

Deprivation of sensation
Creation of no fear

Wake me up, my dead dream
Youâll bring me the peace I wanted
The day of reprisal
Makes me feel my heartbeat
And I am alive to see
The last daylight that fades away from me
And Iâll take my pride for what I have achieved
While feeling my soul has gone

Fearless
Senseless
Heartless and careless
Weâre ready to fall
Unable to love
Weâre ready to fall
