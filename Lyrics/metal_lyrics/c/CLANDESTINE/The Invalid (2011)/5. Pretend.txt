The silence has come along with me
The time has stopped its heartbeat
In my eyes, a darkened dream shatters
I see the future painted in pain

Go through my tainted past if you dare
Step on the broken piece of me
Destroy your mind and hope that youâll bring me to the space of love

Pretend youâre in my life
We blend in the dark blue strife
Stop telling me that youâre my only one
In my life

Reaching the end of night and I canât hide
There is no shade to disguise in
Breaching the silent force binding my spirit
Now I can hear the breath of the years

You drained the rain that I was drowning in
Stepped on my ground abandoned
Destroy your mind and hope that youâll bring me to the space of love

Pretend youâre in my life
We blend in the dark blue strife
Stop telling me that youâre my only one
Pretend youâre mine
But I donât belong to you
Stop telling me that youâre my only one
In my life
