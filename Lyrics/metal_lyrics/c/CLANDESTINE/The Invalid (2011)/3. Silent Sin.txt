A crystal clear
And surely sheer
Sweet fixation
The cryptic keys
To your frozen feelings

Concealed in calmness
Unsealed by blackness
Youâre not alone
Breathing soundlessly through regrets
Yet consciously counting life

Veering around
Are you free from your fear?
Youâd softly sigh and say to me
Thereâs no one behind
Theyâre all in my mind

The silent sin
From within
In your skin
Surrounded by this
Endless iciness
Slowing down all my senses

There you stand
Misunderstand
The way of our lives (thatâs never ending)
But I donât mind
For I am just your shadow figurine

So far away
Weâve fled away
Weâre Just like prey
Encircled by this
Restless relay race
Shaking down our time that remains (all my pieces)

No one behind
There you stand
Slowing down
Silent sin
From within
In your skin I breathe

Turning back when there is something wrong again
Thatâs not a given choice to us
So we soar to the air
