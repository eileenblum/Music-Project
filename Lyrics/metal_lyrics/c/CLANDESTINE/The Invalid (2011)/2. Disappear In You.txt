I embrace your lies
But I know what you hide
Your faceless name in wonderland shifting all around
But I always find you somewhere in my head that I canât recall

I believe in your primal deceit
Causeâ Iâm so used to this kind of torment that Iâve got to take and I have no choice

All my life Iâve never wanted someone just like you
Falling into fear
And I canât trust myself with you

Youâve let me die
And led my soul to your life
Itâs a never ending labyrinth and I am lost
I bleed and plead
Show me your truth at the end of this game
So I wonât regret

Itâs hurting me, deserting me but I have no choice

All my life Iâve never wanted someone just like you
Falling into fear
And I canât trust myself with you

This growing hate, feeling my fate
Break me out of your route

I believe in your primal deceit
Causeâ Iâm so used to this kind of torment that Iâve got to take and I have no choice

All my life Iâve never wanted someone just like you
Falling into fear
And I canât trust myself
In my life Iâd never try to escape from your lies
Drowning in my tears
And I slowly disappear in you
Disappear in your lies
