This growing distance
Without resistance
So obscured by the shade of gray
Youâre gone
You walked away from this life

Just like a scar
The memories remain
And now Iâm blind
I can not escape
From this space Iâm sinking down
Into somewhere deep inside

Lost track of time
In a pitch black hole
No sense of my existence
But something ingrown
Not part of me
Is filling me within

This pain in the phantom limb
These chains on the phantom heart
Too faint, the smell of spirit
Too far, the sound of your voice

Youâre not part of my life
But youâre still part of me

Aggravate this unfortunate fantasy
Deactivate this anonymous body
Accelerate this path of mortality
Tessellate me into my memories
