I saw you in the light
And I knew I was right
Itâs time for me to take the action now
Life is so unfair that you seem complete
Your smileâ¦ I want it to deplete

Iâll show them what you have done before
Say then what I am looking for
Payback for when you destroyed my last
Belief in anyone
Iâll show them how you could have made it through
Say then what I have gave to you
Canât get away from your wicked past
I will lay bare

Slowly revealing whatâs beneath
I have been dreaming in the darkness
Still breathing in cold, poisoned air
