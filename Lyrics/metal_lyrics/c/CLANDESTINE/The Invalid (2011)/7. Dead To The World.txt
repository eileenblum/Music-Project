To find your fake name of fame
Youâre still out there
Why canât you stop being a runaway?
Gained your self worthiness
Through the emptiness
Chasing your own tail thatâs wagging for

All the attention you surely deserve
To be accepted, you strain every nerve
You dream without color
Donât you feel so unsatisfied?
Stop denying and defying for self-defense

Canât see whatâs beyond the stage
Where everyoneâs perfectly in place
They only say what they read on the page
And youâre lost without one

All the attention you surely deserve
To be accepted, you strain every nerve
Still something feels wrong when they call your name
You dream without color
Donât you feel so unsatisfied?
Stop denying and defying for self-defense

Ignorance is whatâs feeding you
For now youâre feeling fine
But canât you see they would creep away
When youâre dead to the world
