I had a dream of the distant life kept somewhere deep in broken remembrance
Finding my ways of how to escape
From this unconsciousness endless emptiness

As I open my eyes
A broken piece of time falls unto me
And I breathe again

No matter how long I was asleep
No matter where I have been
I will break over damnation
No matter how long I was asleep
Now Iâm ready to begin
Taking over me

Feels like Iâm being born again to this world
Smell of the air and those eyes looking down on me
I had to look around and realize the time has stolen all I had in my past

No matter how long I was asleep
No matter where I have been
I will break over damnation
No matter how long I was asleep
Now Iâm ready to begin
Taking over self consciousness
No matter how far Iâm behind
I will never give it up
To the time thatâs never waiting
Unfold the new life I deserve
I have only one more chance (to begin)
