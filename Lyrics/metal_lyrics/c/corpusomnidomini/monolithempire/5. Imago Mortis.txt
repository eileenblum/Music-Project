For whose advantage all beauty unfolds?
Crimes of sorrow is possession it holds
Built with hate, unholy place
A kiss of filth in its cold embrace

Grievous perish without a spark
Choirs of the gods mere whispers in the dark
What will be still remains to be told
Like a veil of tears my blood runs cold

To find a way escape the fear and pain
To cut my wrists and bleed it all away
No left tomorrows, yesterdays
When all is lost shame will remain

Rejected past in a soulless time
No really dead, just barely alive
A thin line, but a burden to bear
Deliverance or a trip to despair?

To find a way escape the fear and pain
To cut my wrists and bleed it all away
Left all alone in this emptiness
When all is lost

Come forward
Be the first one on the shore
Desperation will strike just like before
It came down to this, now it's your turn
From the sea of death there's no return
