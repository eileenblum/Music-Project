When the fire starts to burn you up inside
I will be there to ease your pain
When the full moon casts its shadows from the sky
Tormented souls cry out my name
When the voices in your head lure with their lies
I will comfort you safely into sleep

For I will bless the weak
And darkness builds upon me
Slaves of the eternal silence
Will forever be released

When the hammer falls and crushes all the light
In a world where violence sells
When the cold wind blows and freezes up the night
Places left where evil dwells
When your darkest fears are everything you have
You try to hide but you're in too deep

For I will bless the weak
And darkness builds upon me
Slaves of the eternal silence
Will forever be released

We have built a monolith empire
Sins of the fathers will become those of the sons
Without a trace, within out ways to be done
For ourselves

Walls in our minds, morbid and black
Until the bitter end they hold us back
Seeds of the pure that we once were
Spilled like the blood of those who care
