As I walk into the dreams
Memories from the past run by my eyes
When I step through the gates
A black vortex takes me to an other dimension
Unknown form I get
Is this delusion falling into my dreams?

Collector comes, death arrives
Dreams torn to real pay the price
End has completed, you can't deny
Explore your dreams, they reveal
Torture and pain you will find
Slave to your own bloodlust

Beneath the reality exists a world of visions
Step inside the state of dreams

There will be time when dreams come true
Fear and terror soon will reign
Sensless colours, shapeless forms
Metamorphosis, extreme pain
Your soul is fading, unbounding depth
With fear your dreams fade away

As I walk into the dreams
Memories from the past run by my eyes
When I step through the gates
A black vortex takes me to an other dimension
Unknown form I get
Is this delusion falling into my dreams?
