Two entities engage in a dance of death
Slowly filling the gaps inside their morbid minds
Solutions to false problems
Created by a twisted â vision
Unable to see what's truly wrong

When the time comes
I won't look back
All the tears, all the fears
Gone forever
When something dies
There's no return
Restart, rebuild
Rise from the ashes
Again

The anger of the beast
Kept in a chain
Soon turned to distant shouts
Attempts in vain
Liquify the agony
Dilute the pain
The only thing that matters
Is that I reign

I will not let you destroy me now
I will not let you destroy me now
Rise from the ashes
Restart, rebuild

Broken wings fly low
Broken souls heal slow
Coming back stronger
Is the only goal
No matter if it takes a lifetime
One will grow
