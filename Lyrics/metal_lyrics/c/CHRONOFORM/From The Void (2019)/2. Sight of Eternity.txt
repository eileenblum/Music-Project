You will
Search the light
Inside the hollowness
I will show the way
Finding lines to pursue

Like the first ray
Of sunlight passes through the space
Sense of safety
Unveils in the center of mess
Words of known kind
Are not enough
To portray the type
Your presence tranquils
The ocean of fire
Mind of madness
Will bow the sight of eternity
Essence of you
Will make the tempest kneel

Calm inside the storm
Voice of yours
Resonating

Extinguish the dissonance
The defect ruining
Conciliation
Break the barrier of declination
The bringer of constellation
The bringer of constellation

Raise the boulder
Crushing sight of a blind alley
Make my eyes
Contemplate the purity
Your being illuminates
Through the end of eternity

Extinguish the dissonance
The defect ruining conciliation
Break the barrier of declination
The bringer of constellation
The bringer of constellation

Conceal me
Guide me
Relieve me
Salvage me
Salvage me

Salvage me
Relieve me
Salvage me
