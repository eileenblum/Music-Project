Core of the earth

Core of the earth will burn to ash today
Sky is red and the sun is fading away

Kneel down for the prophets
Descending, destroying
Kneel down for the prophets
Wiping the soil
Kneel down for the kingdom
Descending, destroying
Kneel down for the prophets

Burn away
The soil will burn today
Burn away
No soul will walk another day

Remains of the throne will see a new morning
Catalyst for the great is now unfolding

Kneel down for the prophets
Descending, destroying
Kneel down for the prophets
Wiping the soil
Kneel down for the kingdom
Descending, destroying
Kneel down for the prophets

Burn away
The soil will burn today
Burn away
No soul will walk another day
