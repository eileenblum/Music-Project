Every step I take towards the edge
Makes me stronger
This will be the reckoning
I will push myself
Over
We'll go further!
Follow me I'm conquering

Full force now, I won't quit
Back to back, standing tall
Among the giants
Rising with, wave of strength
Bringing life inside the veil of
Darkness

Come, take my hand
Together we will make the change
Forget the lines
You are so deeply blinded in
Take my hand
Follow us
Take my hand
Forget the rules

Full force now, I won't quit

Back to back, standing tall
Among the giants
Rising with, wave of strength
Bringing life inside the veil of
Darkness
Follow me I'm conquering
This will be the reckoning
Follow me I'm conquering

I will burn the bridge under the false idols of today
Come on and see
The new dawn of the pure and great
I will make the throne of dismay submit to the deepest hate
We will conquer in waves

Come, take my hand
Together we will make the change
Forget the lines
You are so deeply blinded in
Take my hand!
Follow us!
Take my hand!
Forget the rules!

This day will be remembered as the day we make the change
As the day we make the change
