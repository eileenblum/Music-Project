Route to find the birth of man
The place without time and space

Change in known reality
Forced the evident fall
Too big for human mind to see
No one will ever recall

First to between molecules
Link in the DNA
Course to infinite sanity
Foreseen instant decay

Route to find the birth of man
The place without time and space
Context so deep inside of one
Borders will arise

Dig under the skin
To find the missing piece
Link between man and nature
The solace

Route to find the birth of man, the birth of man
The place without time and space, time and space
