An alien being with a delicate composure
Walking slowly towards me
Intricate details hide the weakness
Masked beneath the surface
Approach or assess from the distance
Should I run or get closer
Frightening yet so beautiful

Revealing itself piece by piece
Desire taking over my emotions
Could it be that there is a way for us
To communicate
After centuries of silence
I've found the key

Sophisticated, gentle, immersed in light
You are a masterpiece
Crafted with precision
So near yet so far
Unable to perceive your deepest purpose
It is still a mystery

After waiting for so long
It is finally time to unveil it all
Speaking in foreign languages
We try to make each other see

The similarities
That make us one
Overcome the hurdles
They prove them wrong
What's found shall never be
Concealed again, or we might
Lose control

Revealing itself piece by piece
Desire taking over my emotions
Could it be that there is a way for us
To communicate
After centuries of silence
I've found the key
After centuries of silence
I finally found the key
