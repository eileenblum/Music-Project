From the void
Warm darkness soothing emptiness
Soon to end
Reborn from the tears of humanity
Stars align beneath the sky
In tragedy

Glaze upon the fall
Of clarity

Formed in hate
By the choice of will
Force unseen
Is it in us
Driven by one
Anomality

A machine called human

Woken from beneath
Rise of supremacy
From beneath
Supremacy

Formed in hate
By the choice of will
Force unseen
Is it in us
Driven by one
Anomality

A machine called human
A machine called human
