Man-made disasters
Taking place every day
Are you willing
To risk your life
Put everything
On the line
In exchange of
Progress

The outcome in the end
Is not always so easy
To see
Underestimation
Leads to an early end

Alone in the dark
The weight of my eyelids
Pulling me down
Into infinity

Stay awake
Keep your eyes peeled

Lurking in the shadows
Danger's coming at you
Lurking in the shadows
Danger's coming at you

Like a stone being hurled across the sky
Numb and powerless you fly
Was there ever a chance you might have
Reconsidered it

No way out
No way out

Will I
Ever find a way
Out of here

Reaching the limit
Passing the line
Consciousness follows
Give me a sign
Never again
Will I do the same
If where I lay
Is not my grave
