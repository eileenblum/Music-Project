Soulless lambs step
Into the market spinning wheel
Roots â destroyed
Follow the money and kick their wheels
Destroy the legacy
You're worthless in my eyes
Collect the paycheck
Stained by your own
Greed

Crawl
Through the hole
Forget everything
Squirm in their leash
Without a meaning
Forget everything
Without a meaning

Stain yourself
Mark your doors
The cleansing will
Take the fools
No hope for saints
Serving gods
Made by men
Worshiping material

Forget everything
Without a meaning
Forget everything

Take your money
Burn it in the faithless fire
I pity you
Drowning in the field of lies
Fake your success
Possible by the corporate reels
I am a purist
You are just worthless
Take your money
Throw it into endless wheel
Hang in the noose
You have just your poor self in
