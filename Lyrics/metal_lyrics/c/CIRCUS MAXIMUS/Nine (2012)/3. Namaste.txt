Carelessness at war
You follow your own orders
With no regards
You trespass all borders
You grind whatever flesh
The War-Mill requires
As you take off your mask
My sympathy expires.

Salutations!
I greet you, I plead to you
My Nation!
Now I bow to you
Our Religion!
Deny it or succumb to it
One decision!
It's always up to you

We witness the stronghold
Of double standards
With the whole world in
The front row seats
Tune in to your favorite
Channel and watch the
Ultimate defeat
When we are in that place
We are one

Namaste
Bow before me brothers
Show your respect
Then create devastation
In the name of peace

Here I stand before you
I'll bleed for you
And die for you

Namaste
Bow before me brothers
Show your respect
Then create devastation
In the name of peace
Show me your strength
And together we die
Forever we will live
