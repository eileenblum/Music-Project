Don't live a life caught in shadows
Our eyes will miss out on what's here
For us
That colors our minds with intensions
That leads us to choose and take the
Path less traveled by
Just reach within and shed your skin
Don't be afraid if it leaves a scar
Sometimes it might take you far

Stand your ground
It's time to face your fears
Now become the one You've locked away
For years
Looking back you've always found
A reason
For the easy way out
Your life in a reflection

There comes a time when we need
The answers
There comes a time when we're
All alone
Although we're bound to this together
You'll have to walk the path alone

I never told you that it would be easy
I never told you I would be around
To save you from yourself
Now you see all the whys
It's time you make your own decisions
And let me go

There comes a time when we need
The answers
There comes a time when we're
All alone
Although we're bound to this
together
You'll have to walk the path alone
I never told you that it would be easy
And now you see all the whys
It's time you make your own decisions
And let me go
