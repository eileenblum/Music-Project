If we could sense each other
In the presence of another
Just for one day
Would it make a difference anyway
If I knew what you were thinkin'
I wouldn't bother wasting my time
I'd spend my day being out of harms way

There's no success without will
What you gain ain't free in life
It isn't where you come from,
It's where you're going that counts
You get back into the saddle again
Ride alongside lifes rain
And walk out as the winner
When you own the game

Would you live with it or let it go
Will you remember it all
With only one goal
When time catches up with you
Then I'll know what you'll do?
You'll keep living a lie don't you know?

Now place your bets on this game
And never let the scornful doubts
Of disbelievers
Have your spirit put to shame
You know what you have found
So close your eyes for the second round

Live it or let it go
Remember it all, if only one goal
Then time catches up with you
And there is no more to do
In the life that was you
