When did it come to this
These drained emotions
I feel guilty for not being inspired
I can see you reaching out to me
But I leave you floating
After I am free of you
I should be missing what we had
In loving memory
To whom do I turn for a new beginning
All alone do I trust with this task
Of solace
In loving memory

I have lost the power to feel
Turned to stone
My heart blackened

I should have seen what was good
Not been so easily blinded
All that glitters isn't gold

Every shimmering rock I've collected
kept weighing me down
Pulling me to the ground
All that I have left of us is a memory
A picture of you and me
Have I forsaken my destiny

I have lost the power to feel
Turned to stone
My heart is bleeding
I should have seen what was good
Not been so easily blinded
All that glitters isn't gold
