I never thought I'd live to know
This feeling
A stream of emotions flowing
Through me
I Used to think that I would learn
How to forget
Please help me through
The days without regrets

Define or defeat you
Me and I about to collide
I used to hope for a miracle
Decide and fend for me
Like all hope was lost
So I'll get used to the pain of being used

Everything felt and looked transparent
I'm starving from the lack of myself
I'm suffering around my own well being
Please someone help me through
And take away the pain

I used to think that this was as good as it could get... being used

Define myself
It feels like I'm going nowhere
I used to hope for a miracle
Decide for myself
It seemed like all hope was lost
So I got used to the pain
Of being used
