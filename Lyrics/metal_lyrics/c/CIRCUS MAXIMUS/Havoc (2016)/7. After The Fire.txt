Intentionally lost
Never to be found
Some time ago this flame
This flame was drowned
I wished last time
Would be the last
Leaving those moments far
Far in the past

Hiding from your eyes to see
Hoping you would not remember me
In a safe haven
I'll be free
I'll be free

This passage could only end in flames
With no room for reason
Just starting the game
With only one breath
Again so blind
This wave of emotions poisoned my mind

Give up this heart left shattered
Survivor alone you stand
With a last leap of faith
The flames will make their brand
One thing is certain
Everything will burn
Within the ruins of men
Save what you can

Hiding from your eyes to see
Hoping you would not remember me
In my haven I'll be free

And I'll never again re-light this spark
Never again serve as your mark
Never again stand in the mire
Never again be after the fire

Come near...
Appear...
Act out...
Don't shout...
I will not fear...
Head clear...
Fall out...
Just go about...

Closing in on me
I feel the heat rising here
Within the deep pitch black
Alone with the wolf pack
I hold up the spear
And I pierce through the fear
Push forward, hit full strength
I have the heart to go the full length

Come near...
Appear...
Act out...
Don't shout...
I will not fear...
Head clear...
Fall out...
Just go about...

And I'll never again re-light this spark
Never again serve as your mark
Never again stand in the mire
Never again be after the fire
And I'll never be after the fire
No I'll never be after the fire
I'll never be after the fire
