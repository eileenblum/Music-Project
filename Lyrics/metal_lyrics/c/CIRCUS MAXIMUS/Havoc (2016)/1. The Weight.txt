Waves have washed me upon your shore
Smooth seas didn't make me a good sailor
I've been living with you
Within a dream that came alive
On the side

Caving in on myself
Venturing deeper within me
I've been eager to pull
To pull out the thorn in my side
To feel alive

Waiting for the call that breaks these walls
Painting these halls with the weight of it all

Be the one you want to know the most
I weigh me down just to pick me up
I'll show you me like you want me to be
The weight has made me blind

Leaving it all in open for all the world to see
I'm showing me hope to make me last
The dark haunts my presence and have erased my past
Still the melody in my heart chimed on...
Chimed on...Chimed on...
It chimed the right tone

I've been waiting for the call that'll break these walls
Painting these halls with the weight of it all

Be the one you want to know the most
I weigh me down just to pick me up
I'll show you me like you want me to be
The weight has made me blind
Oh, so blind
I'll show you me like you want me to be
Love has made me blind
