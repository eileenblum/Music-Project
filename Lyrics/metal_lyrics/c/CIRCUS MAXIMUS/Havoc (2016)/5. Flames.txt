There is no need to decide,
Light the fire let me die.
I feel no more agony,
It is just like it should be.

My burning fire, take me home
My one desire, feed me more
My only choir, in my dome
Let me rewire...

Shed my flesh inside the heat,
Keep on going till the last heart beats.
I'll open and I'll become,
The one thing you should stay away from.

My burning fire, take me home
My one desire, feed me more (and more)
My only choir, in my dome
Let me rewire...

I want to fade from a life that's never real,
All alone but I am with with her here,
I am the master of my final journey,
Hold onto your seat and feel,
And feel...

My burning fire, take me home
My one desire, feed me more (and more)
My only choir, in my dome
Let me rewire

Let me go...
