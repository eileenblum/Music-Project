Facing, I am fading
I've become the word transparent
Seize me as I'm wasting
Bitter tears in glorifying you
Feels like I am being devoured
Devoured by feeling blue

I build it up, you always tear it down
It seems like this is it when you're around
It's not that I don't wanna play the game
It's just that if I lose then you're to blame
You only aim for my weak mind
The one you know that you can buy
You make me sell myself to the
Highest bitter

Welcome to this exhibition
Where I am the main attraction
Come and see me in the pillory
Enjoy my misery
I know you've said it all before
When it was up to you
I didn't pull it through
I never cried out when you lied
I just smiled and slowly died

[2x]
I build it up, you always tear it down
It seems like this is it when you're around
It's not that I don't wanna play the game
It's just that if I lose then you're to blame
You only aim for my weak mind
The one you know that you can buy
You make me sell myself to the
Highest bitter
