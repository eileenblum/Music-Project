Name the place so you'll remember
Just open your eyes and see
Then make believe what has been is the center
That ignites the light within you

The voice inside is your defender
Just speak the words and see
Then make them bleed right through and pierce your armor
Reveal the one within you

Make your way through the madness that is life
Embrace what you might find
If sadness clouds your mind
You will have the tools to use
You'll only have to choose

The voice inside is your defender
Just speak the words and see
Then make them bleed right through and pierce your armor
Reveal the one within you

Remember when it all caves in
The marks you bear that makes you win
In the dark you search within
Just remember when it comes to giving in
The battlefield is yours to win

Remember how, remember when we wore
The coat of arms that made us heroes of the day
Just render the memories again, my friend
You know it lies within, you know where to begin

Remember when it all caves in
The marks you bear that makes you win
In the dark you search within
Just remember when it comes to giving in
The battlefield is yours to win
