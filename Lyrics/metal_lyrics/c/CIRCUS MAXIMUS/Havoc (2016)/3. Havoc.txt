This time I'll go too far
Go too long
Gonna set the bar
I'm out for blood
I wanna silence the peace
Cause I am havoc
Let me have my release

Come on!

Pick a fight
Swinging my right
Make a sucke
Bleed out
Knocked out lights
Out goodnight
Cause in the ring
I am the raging bull
Here's to me
Now go get your pull

I am the prosecutor
Judge
Executioner
The sound of the hammer
Just sealed your fate
Cause I'm the arsonist
Attend my wake
As the Salem Witches burn at the stake

You're gonna see me
You're gonna scream and
You're gonna feel my blade slide in your side
You're all beneath me
You won't defeat me
Cause I am here with havoc as my bride

Step right out folks!
Witness a real live circus freak reeking
Havoc in your neighbourhood
You better step out of his way
Or he'll beat you to the ground

This time I'll go too far
Go too long
Gonna set the bar
I'm out for blood
I wanna silence the peace
Cause I am havoc
Let me have my release

You're gonna see me
You're gonna scream and
You're gonna feel my blade slide in your side
You're all beneath me
You won't defeat me
Cause I am here with havoc as my bride
