I was there for a moment, and now I am gone,
I was watching over you, and gave you all the clues.
So I can't give life to a withered rose,
Tears fill my eyes and all the rest I suppose.
I guess my life was stripped away from me,
And the vengeance will set me free.

Loved ones this is your song, I've owed it to you.
Now that I have found what I've been looking for,
This I can tell you.

You can't see through my transparent flesh,
Floating through time and space I am weightless.
I'm not at the place where you go when you die,
The place where everyone knows.
So I can't give life to withered rose,
Tears fill my eyes and all the rest I suppose.

Loved ones this is your song, I've owed it to you.
Now that I have found what I've been looking for,
This I can tell you.

So I gave new life to a withered rose,
Tears fill my eyes and all the rest I suppose.
I guess my love was ripped away from me.
Vengeance will set me free,
Vengeance will set me free...
