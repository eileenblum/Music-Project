Imagine me as you
Be my eyes and ears
As you read on
Learn about my past, present and future
My flaws, my belief
My success and my love
Loss and all my hopes
My grief and my death

Suffering in silence
Just to be a part of life
Smiling at the crowd while singing
Words made up by lies
My childhood years came and went
I felt nothing to repent
Minutes felt like hours
And the hours seemed like

Days
Nights
All inside is lost in
A haze
Frights
Scared of turning another page

Saved memories
Read them to me and tell
Tell me my story
Some, some will hurt but I can't live without...
I strive to find and re-light the flame
Need to re-fuel and throw away the shame
Mind over matter
That's how it's played

Suffering in silence
Just to be a part of life
Smiling at the crowd while singing
Words made up by lies
My childhood years came and went
I felt nothing to repent
Minutes felt like hours
And the hours seemed like

Days
Nights
All inside is lost in
A haze
Frights
Scared of turning another page
Oh another page
