When there's no love nor hate in this world
When we reach out our hand to someone
...but that someone is not there
I'm all alone in this forsaken world where time stands
...ooh so still
I remember but now it's time for peace

The world ain't no longer
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
It's in the hands of faith

You keep on walking that same dark road
Where there's no end to see
In these ruins you stand all alone
...while you dream about yesterday

There's no turning back once the tides have changed (tides have changed)
The world ain't no longer
It's in the hands of faith

I woke up in the middle of the night
Outside the rain was covered in red
Thunder and lightning covers the sky
I'm all alone in this forsaken place
What have I done to deserve a life like this
Am I the key? Have I unlocked the mystery to life?

Innocence is the secret to reveal the prophecy
A new beginning predicted by the pages in the sand
Innocence is the secret to reveal the prophecy
The soul survivor stands alone to end this misery
