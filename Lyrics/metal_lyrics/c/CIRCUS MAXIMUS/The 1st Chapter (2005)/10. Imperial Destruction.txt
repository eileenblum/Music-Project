[Bonus track]

Times of woe
Uncertain future
Related talks
Events by past
Love to hate
Hate to love
Be a prey
Hunt or stay

False prophets ignored in ridicule
Treason by demons, we will fall
Skeptic minds will turn the tide
To imperial destruction

Don't let depression take control
Unmask your truly self
Ignore the rights and all the wrongs
embrace the light

In the heat of the night
you feel the walls cave in on you
Can you feel what I do
You can open the door
but you can not read what is on my mind
Just open your eyes and see the light

The sun appears
On the rise again
To overcome what has never been
You can feel you're on the edge
You can stop yourself, your fall
Why is there nobody to call?
I can see it through the open line
I can see it to the end this time
You know
It is all in my favor
Reach inside your crystal ball
Open your mind and then you fall

Don't let depression take control
Unmask your truly self
Ignore the rights and all the wrongs
Embrace the light

In the heat of the night
You feel the walls cave in on you
Can you feel what I do
You can open the door
But you can not read what is on my mind
Just open your eyes and see the light

Don't let depression take control
Unmask your truly self
Ignore the rights and all the wrongs
Embrace the light

In the heat of the night
You feel the walls cave in on you
Can you feel what I do
You can open the door
But you can not read what is on my mind
Can you feel, what I do
Can you turn your life around
Can you feel what I do
You can open the door
But you can not read what is on my mind
Just open your eyes and see the light
