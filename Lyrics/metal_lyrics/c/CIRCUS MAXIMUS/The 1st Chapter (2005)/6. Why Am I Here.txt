Falling through the oceans of life... I sense the sorrow
I picture the pain from the stream of life that I'm in
Feel the fire burning through the sphere tonight
What is this thing that I see?
Someone wake me up from this nightmare!

If I only could get through the night
It would be a revelation
The understanding of nothing... seems so far away

Why am I here... down on this lonely road?
I can feel there's no on here
I'm slowly fading into nothingness
Why am I here... down on this lonely road?
I try to speak, but I can't find the words to say

It was only a dream. His body senses relief
He washes of the night from his face
Followed by a look in the mirror
Something doesn't feel right here
Who is this man I see?
Somehow he can't recognize himself

Why am I here... down on this lonely road?
I can feel there's no one here
I'm slowly fading into nothingness
Why am I here... down on this lonely road?
I try to speak, but I can't find the words to say
(the word to say... oh no)

Like a child he is scared by the absence of light
Abducted by himself. Crippled by the mind
The will must contrive the mind

Why am I here... down on this lonely road?
I carry on...
Why am I here... down on this lonely road?
Down on this lonely road
I can feel there's no one here
I'm slowly fading into nothingness
Into nothingness I fade
Stop locking me in!
Why can't I get out of here?
I've been lost in the long forever
Lurking alone again
