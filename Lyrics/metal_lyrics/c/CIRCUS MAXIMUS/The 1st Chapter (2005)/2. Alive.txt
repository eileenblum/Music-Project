I remember you told me once
What could be the answer to it all
The answer to my soul
I believed in love not magic,
need some time to figure out what to do with this
with my heart, that is
(I was so alone)

Why can't you see that I need some time alone?
Every moment my heart beats, I remember how it used to be.

Can you forgive how I used to be?
In a lull the stars remain through lonely nights.
(They keep shining)

I believed in love in the midnight sun we roll
Even if the stars remain, I know
That this won't last forever
(This won't last forever)

We will make it through the night.

[Chorus:]
When you feel alive, when there's nothing you can do.
When you can explain, "Is there a reason why I'm living?"
When you feel alive, when there's nothing you can do.
Now I'll keep on searching for the path that lies ahead, ahead.
Is the longest way to go...

I can see the sunshine up above
I can see the rainbow down below
Into the fire we burn.
I see it.
I can't deny it, feelings I have deep inside for you!

When you feel alive, when there's nothing you can do.
When you can explain, "Is there a reason why I'm living?"
When you feel alive, when there's nothing you can do,
We will struggle towards this together:
Together we will make it through alive...
