I'm staring out the window
It's raining outside
The fall has caught up with me
I feel that I can't breath
I wish I couldn't see
I lived my life through someone else

Long ago I made a choice
That I thought would make a difference
And lead me back on track

Silence from angels above
Leaving us behind in a time when we are in need
Of someone to hold close to your heart
I am just another leaf falling down on the ground

I'm standing at a crossroad
I don't know what to do
I will not live to see another day
The time has come to face the end
This is a necessary thing
Cause I will hold your hand an say
Will you forgive me

Long ago I made a choice
That I thought would make a difference
And lead me back on track
