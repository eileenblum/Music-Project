The men stood tall on the battleground
With pride in their eyes
And with faith to guide them
Blood was spilled over the fields
They won, but for what cause?
What we do echoes in eternity

Now as brothers they unite
And as enemies they shall apart
For the glory of the Empire
Now I've been betrayed
But there is no one here to tell
I must walk towards the deadline
I must walk it alone... all alone

On my quest for a new horizon
I've been waiting for so long
In the time of a desperate fighter

Free me from the spell that I'm in
Through these eyes I have seen
With my soul I have been drowning
This journey must end
I must enter the scene once again

My name has been taken
My soul has been torn apart
What I have lived for has now been taken away from me
Sold for a penny, I was marked as gold
The arena opens up
...the salute of a thousand souls
I must struggle to win the crowd

Now the time has come
Will I win or fall?
Victory is on my mind
Could it ever be what I have found?
Now the gates are open wide
I must enter the arena
It will bring me one step closer to my revenge

On the quest for a new horizon
I've been waiting for so long
In the time of a desperate fighter

Free me from the spell that I'm in
Through these eyes I have seen
With my soul I have been drowning
This journey must end

I gazed into the night
...where you and I once used to watch the sun set,
And the moon rise
Now as the time pass by, when I can not breath at all
When you reach out your hand

Betray whispers in the wind
An era that never ends
My soul is in blister, but I feel no pain
I can now see what was taken away from me
Through the gates I walk, but I am not alone
I am One, now finally... finally I'm free

On my quest for a new horizon
I've been waiting for so long
In a time of a desperate fighter

Free me from the spell that I'm in
Through these eyes I have seen
With my soul I have been drowning
This journey must end
I have entered the scene again

For the glory of the Empire
That's been built by the hands of slaves
For the glory of the Empire
That's been built by the hands of slaves
To fulfill the master's will
