We walk alone to the edge of insanity
In the end of time we fall... tonight?

Never walk alone outside or pull the strings when you are alive in a dying world
It's a mesmerizing thing
These are the nights where the holy morning rise
Now it's time for you to open your eyes

When i look into your darkened mind i take you in, no compromise
There's something wrong inside my head

Can you forget all the promises, is the truth too hard to take?
Now i know there must be time to forgive, we will be one again

I don't know where to find myself, though i can fell it anyway
I won't forget all the things that you promised me
My darkened mind will never set me free
