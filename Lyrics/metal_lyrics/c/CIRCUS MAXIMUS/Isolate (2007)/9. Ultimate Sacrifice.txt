I don't know where to sleep at night, I don't know which way to go
Will I ever be the same? The same as I was before?
Now is time for me to move on through the waters of time
From the ashes I will rise like the morning sun
I can not explain the way it is
It's just something that went wrong
Deep in the core of a mans mind
I will search to find the answers to this mystery of technology we make
Listen to me, there is something that you have to do

While the fire shines bright, I hear the screams from a motherless child
It's tearing me deep down inside

You can not imagine the pain it gives
When you stand there alone and powerless
You need someone to lean on
Now I've been looking for the solution to this crime
This time we shall stand our cause and remember why we fought

In the dark comes the rain with agony and pain
Now I could not see the hands before me
I will never surrender
I'm a survivor and this is my destiny

I can't not believe the truth
There is nothing I can say or do to make it all better
Now it's time for you to fall
There is nothing you can do or say, your day will come tomorrow

Now a new day is approaching the atrocity has been done
I remove the dirt from my eyes just to see what the world's become
When I look back on all the things I've been through
Now we must realize that this must be the remembrance of us all

In the dark comes the rain with agony and pain
Now I could not see the hands before me
I will never surrender
I'm a survivor and this is my destiny
