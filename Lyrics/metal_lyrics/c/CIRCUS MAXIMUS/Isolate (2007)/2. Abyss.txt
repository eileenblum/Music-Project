Can you feel my broken spirit?
Seeing only visions of how it should have been
Rendering what shaped my existence
Wanting a change, but imprisoned by the past
I am lost in my inner forest of conflict
When this journey began, my life was chaotic
Because of my hate held hostage by my own hand
My feelings inflict me
I see no way but in life
Erase the pain that's eating me up inside

Venturing deeper and deeper into the abyss
Hearing voices like someone I know
Feeling harder to breath
Then to be left behind, accepting the fate
"Of what I have become"
The only way my soul can breath again
Is letting the one's we love move on
Let go!

The silent fight will have no winner
Now I see my world
Coming back to life
My eyes are finally open again
Now I see it all in a different light
Standing on the outside
While I'm looking in

I stand on the edge of the abyss and I'm waiting to fall
I see no way out in life
When I look back there was no one there for me
I stand on the edge of the abyss and I'm waiting to fall
And I'm waiting to fall
