The morning came...
I can see you lying there
Your body next to mine,
"Oh God, she looks so fine..."
All my life I've been searching for someone
I thought it was lost
Then suddenly I met you...

I can not lose it all
Feel the love
The feelings I thought were gone, calling me
"You can not win 'em all"
Is all I heard
She's the one who'll be there
Today

Finally the time has come to
Give eternal love, and to
Stay alive together is our destiny
No more sorrow, no more pain
And your presence keep me sane
In the night I'll hold you tight
Until the end

I can not lose it all
Feel the love
The feelings I thought were gone, calling me
We can not win 'em all tonight
The fear of letting go
Now I'm the one who will be there

Where there's time for goodbye
In the darkest devotion
I'm the only one
Feel my heat when the silence surrounds you tonight
