To the black flame I dance the waltz of wonders.
Yet certain is the path that led us here.
Behold, tremble, at the primal beauty.
Echoes beyond time ever near.

The age old yearning beckons now.
Timeless wisdom spreads its wings.
I walk to what's beyond life's structured walls.
To burn the one way path that steers us all.
To the other...I go.

Descend through holes of time,
To venomous depths.
The coils of snakes unwind,
As I follow.

Shapeless shadows taking form.
The nameless choir sings in tongues...

...Yet I hear their mantras clear.
Vibrations from the north shake the lifeless air.
I drift to the outermost borders,
Leaving footprints in the ash of ancient fires.

The nephilim now take my hand, the spectres of the deep.
The swirling darkness takes me home through pathways of my dreams.
