In the dwelling twilight where thy fires burn,
We call upon the end
Ghostly howls of death's delight
Ascending, we become one
In your many arms I bleed,
With the ash of olden times
We forge the way.
Blessed be the burning one,
For in her lies the key
On withered backbones lies earthly truths,
That crumble in thy hand
To hallowed ground where the self must die,
For the new to be rebornâ¦ Reborn!
Exalted one, of storm and wind
By your haunting grace, my hunt begins
This elusive presence in the night-side mist,
Lures my soul with its poisonous kiss
And in the silence the dark one calls,
Beneath Her bloody feet the serpent crawls
In your many arms I bleed,
With the ash of olden times
We forge the way.
Blessed be the burning one
For in her lies the key
