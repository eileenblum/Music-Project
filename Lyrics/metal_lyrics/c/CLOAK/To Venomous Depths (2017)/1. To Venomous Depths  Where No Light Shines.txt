Arise, O fires of dissolution.
Hold high the torch, for an omen is born
Sing loud our praise to ethereal sleep.
Cut deep the veins of a waning world
I hear its croon. Your death breeds in me.
Can you hear the hum of a thousand flies?
Sharp is the blade that reaps the womb of life.
By thy grace we piece each heart.
Just one bite won't tame the hungry sons of wolves.
Basking the heat of the ghastly pyre.
Dance in the eye of the furious storm.
No light will shine where the wicked dwell.
So I tread this path no return.
Rejoicing now in the sea of madness, upon violent winds I ride
An endless voyage neath depths forsaken, where the infernal treasures hide
We gaze upon the fields of mourning, where the men of Abel fell from grace
Behold the holy water churning, as the tree of life is set ablaze
I feel its curse, her blood bleeds in me
I taste the cunt of the scarlet whore
Frail is the hand that guides us towards the light.
By thy grace we sear these chains.
Just one look won't soothe the piercing eyes of snakesâ¦
Yeah!
