The storm of chaos riding near,
Upon the winds of woe.
For its desires dark and vast,
And its reaping ever slow.
And in its touch you feel the yearning sense
To return to a time when all was nothing,
And nothing was all
As the cold winds blow,
My spirit sways
This shell of flesh that conceals,
Must burn within the black
As the Earth becomes a charnel house,
The final flood shall commence
Into the lake of fire,
Open now the gate
Welcome now the death of time,
This ends was made for you
And in the trail of ash you find
The burning pain of truth
Now taste the grit and suffocate on remains nevermore
By the hand of Samael we fall into the great unknown
I've walked upon the path to nowhere
Only now to return
I bowed to none and spit on thee,
God of light and restraintâ¦
Your walls of gold have turned to sand,
Filling the black desert's land
And in the dust of a dying world,
I shall build my throne
Venture to the depths,
The call of the untamed
The passage of the end
Calls my nameâ¦
As the cold winds blow,
My spirit sways
This shell of flesh that concealsâ¦
As the Earth becomes a charnel house,
The final flood shall commence
Into the lake of fireâ¦
