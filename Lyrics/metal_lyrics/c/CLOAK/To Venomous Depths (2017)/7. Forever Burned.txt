It flows like the waters of Abzu, with might so forceful in its grasp to
Strangle all of time
Drown in airless death, look beneath the sand to the nether...remember
The heat blinds my eyes, but nothing can stop the burning hunger for the
Other
In the absence of light, shines visions divine
Where none dare to seek it where the devil shall ride
This unending labyrinth, where truths seem to dwell, is where I shall
Wander
Walk among the coals which illuminate the path of the unknown
One of the night, a child of fire doomed to search - for the kingdom that
Was and will forever be above and below.Behold not what is lost, but
What's forever burned on this infernal journey
In the absence of light, shines visions divine
Where none dare to seek is where the devil shall ride.
In this unending labyrinth, where the sacred ash lies - My hear opens for
Thee.
Granted light from the darkness bestowed.
The night glows through the eyes of Cain.
I am the salt in the wounds of the thorns.
Through the winding path of the abyss, I find the trail of wolf's cum and
Witch's blood of which I was born.
A seed that ignites the blackest flame with divine splendor.
