They breed in shadows of the moon. Unlocking gateways in my mind
The ghosts that sing of Devils, their music is so divine
The dark comes, as does my trance. Born of the witching hour
From forbidden shores I watch the frail Earth that time devours.
In the crevice of two worlds, I see no distant light
Nor the guiding hand that leads the fools from the treasures of the night
Who stand before me? O nameless ones - May your truths be many, and you
Impotence none.
The hidden sphere that burns the heart, forged by the whores of Babylon -
Bringer of God's lament, unveiling gnosis that is shunned
The deep red calls me now - Through its crimson eyes I see
I wander, but have found the one who lives through me
Father of desires, mother of all lusts - Pierce these eyes so I can see
Beyond
Within the swarming shadows live those who roam the void
Shapeless and unbound, cursed forevermore.
What flows within me?
O formless ones - Burn the illusion - All to none
As night falls, the spirit aligns
Drift on towards the hollow, the in-between of time
The ever burning flame, in the depths of yearning hearts
The revealer of truths concealed, a passage through the dark.
The voice that calls seduces me
To walk with fire, with the cursed ones!!!
