Beyond the light of this world,
Dwelling in the fields of Nod.
Lies a place behind the veil,
For the hungry to see.
Come forth, He who wanders.
Reveal all that is locked.
Tonight is the night that marks the first hunt.
The night is a womb,
And I am her child.
Obsessed with the death
That flows from the wild.
Granted the key,
But search I must
For the final gate.
And just beyond sight,
Shines a light from the crack.
But the shadow it casts
Swallows all who stare back.
And deep in the chasm dwells the ancient flame that burns within us all.
But few shall carry the torch that speaks its tale.
Tempter from the other side who haunts my dreams,
Now move through me, so the forbidden fruit may fall.
I shall heed your call.
The night is a womb,
And I am her child.
Obsessed with the death
That flows from the wild.
Granted the key,
But search I must
For the final gate.
For the final gate.
