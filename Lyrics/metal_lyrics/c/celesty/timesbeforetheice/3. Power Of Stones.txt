[Queen Shemin]

It's starting to rain
And the sky is turning to black
I'm feeling strong pain
And I know there ain't coming back

My hands are shaking and I fear
When Delinom is riding here

He opens the door
I drop my sword I don't fight
He forces me on floor
And that's where I'm losing the light

[Delinom]
Now I have the stone and key
I use them and gods will see...

When I cans have the power
Of fire and flame
I have the strength from the stone
Now I can feel the power
Nothing ain't the same
And I rule this world alone

[Queen Shemin]
Help me good gods
I have to get back that stone
Please help me to start
I can't survive this alone

[Delinom]
You can do nothing to me
I'm the lord can't you see

When I have all this power
Of fire and flame
I have the strength from the stone
And I can feel the power
Nothing ain't the same

[Gods of Cryon]
Queen Shemin, we help you but
you must make a great sacrifice
We give you the stone and key of ice;
if you use them it gives you power to rise.
It means that you have to freeze Delinom and guard him
all the time until someone will find the way to destroy him.

[Queen Shemin]
Now I feel how coldness comes.
And I cannot feel the sun
This world freedom is by my hand
And I use this power to free this land
