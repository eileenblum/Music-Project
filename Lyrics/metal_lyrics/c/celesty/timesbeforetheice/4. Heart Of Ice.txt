[Delinom's part]

There is no longer blood in my heart
I feel flames and they tear me apart
Awful pain runs my veins; I am no more a man
I no longer bowl before gods
This is time when my own kingdom starts
What that blue light that shines from window
It blinds my eyes and it starts to get cold

[Queen Shemin]

I'm the ice queen and I'm here, to end what you started
I'll freeze you with the power I gained
Cause I want my land back the same
It's the battle for all that us right
(All that is right)
The only solution for me is to fight
I'll take what shall belong to me
(Belong to me)
My powers I use and my land shall be free
These powers was given by gods
And now I must use them and beat evil force
That violently took me, without asking a cause
Now feel my wrath
Flames are bursting from eyes filled of hate
I shall block them with spell of ice plate
I feel rage as I gain all my strength, to a one
This final burst will freeze you down
For eternity you sleep under town
It's the battle for all that us right
(All that is right)
The only solution for me is to fight
I'll take what shall belong to me
(Belong to me)
My powers I use and my land shall be free
These powers was given by gods
And now I must use them and beat evil force
That violently took me, without asking a cause
Now feel my wrath
