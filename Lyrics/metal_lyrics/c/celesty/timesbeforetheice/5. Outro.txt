[Sir Agathos]

Now when battle is over at last
The Queen must wait and let the years pass
As you know her child will save her
But she must give him away, so the gods have told me
Her town is finally free
But her eternal soul it shall never be
From castle of ice she will keep, The Cryon in deepest cold
But for how long
This is how the age of the ice began
And you know the rest, from story which I have told
You may wonder how Delinom knew
where the stone was, and what it will cause
Myself I used to be god
But I also was evil fraud,
I know where the rest of the stones are kept
So now I will rise...
