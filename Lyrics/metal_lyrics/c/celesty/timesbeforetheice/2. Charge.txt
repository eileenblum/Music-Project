[Delinom's part]

[Verse 1]
Now, when darkness has arrived
And the moon is only light
I'm crossing this line
To the land, which soon is, mine

[Verse 2]
And I'm fighting at this town
Until they all are down
I send them to hell
Can you hear the winning bell?
The winning bell

[Verse 3]
I see, how all my men are in line
Only give them one more sign
And they're heading to fight
To fight for they right

[Verse 4]
And I raise my sword up high
So high up to the sky
My troops on their way
This is a glorious day

[Chorus:]
I ride, and send my troops in to fight
Soon they all will sing for victory
I'll find the stone, and then they all can see
How I live for eternity
Eternity

[Verse 5]
Now, When daylight has arrived
And I see the end of fight
I have won the war
Now it's time for final door

[Verse 6]
Queens castle I must ride
I force her be my bride
A mother of my son
She has no place to hide

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus X2]
