Again, I woke from that dream, which felt like reality
I was walking towards the light, and there I saw my child
And you were there with him, you didnât see me at all
I wanted to stay, cause I have never felt this way
I was fading away

I tried to reach you, and I tried to scream
But you couldn't hear, you withdraw more and more
Then you did turn to watch me you looked in the eyes and you said
donât be afraid, it all will turn to good someday
I was fading away

How does it feel, when a soul finally finds itâs peace
Mind in a place where thoughts fly among the dreams
As I lay down, every moment feels like endless journey
And thatâs where I wake and see you right beside of me

Everything fades away

How does it feel, when a soul finally finds itâs peace
Mind in a place where, thoughts fly among the dreams
As I lay down, every moment feels like endless journey
And thatâs where I wake and see you right beside of me
right beside of me

I know you wonât believe, but I have been there
And I have seen in a dream the end of this all
In the end we all will fall
