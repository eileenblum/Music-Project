Only silence fills the air, as the dust slowly fades away
Suddenly I hear the screams of victory, oh brothers can this be true
This bloody war at last itâs history, as I wished nightly in my dreams

Heading to home

Some say they escape away from here, faraway into the night.
The reason for that, no one can tell, as long as they keep out of sight

Oh, How I see how the birds are flying, in the sky
We are walking home from this battlefield, and we sing

Signs of life, in the night
The time when our new life can start
Signs of life, daylight
help us to follow our hearts

It's time to rebuild our land again, where war left marks everywhere
And it's time to bury our brothers; those brave fallen men of this world

Oh, How I see how the birds are flying, in the sky
We are walking home from this battlefield, and we sing

Signs of life, in the night
The time when our new life can start
Signs of life, daylight
Help us to follow our hearts

Time to keep a moment of silence, for our brothers on the other side
We all know they fought so bravely, will we ever see them again?
Our children remember the day of defenders
Together we won great battle, so brothers rest in peace.

Signs of life, in the night
The time when our new life can start
Signs of life, daylight
help us to follow our hearts

Signs of life, in the night
The time when our new life can start
Signs of life, daylight
help us to follow our hearts
