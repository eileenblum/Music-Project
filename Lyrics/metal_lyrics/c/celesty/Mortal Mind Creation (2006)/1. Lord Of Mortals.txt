Young life began filled with hate
No time to think about the fate
Not when this child can spite the heavens gate.

Mind like an arrow, filled with ice
Where is the truth, where are the lies?
These sad questions we can see from your eyes.

Your wicked manners start remind us of the man we used to know
all the rain and fire, starts before the show.
with thunder and lightning you fill your heart that wasnât whole
To the surface

Some call you chosen one, but thatâs just a lie
Itâs only a dream
Some call you chosen one, but thatâs just a lie
Itâs only a dream. sweet dream

You seek the salvation, the mortal mind creation
Thatâs whatâs important
You seek the salvation, the mortal mind creation
Why canât you see, why wonât you believe
One day you could be
Lord of mortals

You seek the salvation, the mortal mind creation
you seek the salvation

Some call you chosen one, but thatâs just a lie
Itâs only a dream
Some call you chosen one, but thatâs just a lie
Itâs only a dream, sweet dream

You seek the salvation, the mortal mind creation
Thatâs whatâs important
You seek the salvation, the mortal mind creation
Why canât you see, why wonât you believe
One day you could be, eternally free
Why canât you see, why wonât you believe
One day you could be
Lord of mortals
