Take me to the temple, where the gods are always near
I am only satisfied if you donât fail
Take the stones; collect them all, you shall have no fear
You are the only key to free me now, so

Faster even faster, you must be faster now
I am only satisfied if you succeed
So take me to the temple where my cure is more than near
We are almost there, so you just have toâ¦.

Ride
Into the night
Iâm so near and this time Iâll survive
Survive
Out to the light
Prepare to great fight, cause

This time will soon be over, so you must be quick
Together we can end this war eternally
I will fight forever to find a way is there
This place where I am is too empty for my soul

Only a brave man with great honour and might
Finds the way, to survive, and thatâs why youâ¦

Ride
Into the night
Iâm so near and this time Iâll survive
Survive
Out to the light
Prepare to great fight, and
Ride
Into the night
Iâm so near and this time Iâll survive
Survive
Out to the light
This will be my last sacrifice

One more step and our land is free
Their final mistake was to leave us this empty sea
As I walk inside I feel how the ground is shaking
Inside this empty tower, I find the truth
With force of evil power, Iâll erase untruth
Inside this empty tower I find the truth
With force of evil power, Iâll erase untruth

The wind is blowing, the water is flowing
the earth is shaking and the fire is burning

Ride
Into the night
Iâm so near and this time Iâll survive
Survive
Out to the light
Prepare to great fight, and

Ride
Into the night
Iâm so near and this time Iâll survive
Survive
Out to the light
This will be my last sacrifice
