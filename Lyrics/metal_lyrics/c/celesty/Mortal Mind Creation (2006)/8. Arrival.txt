For those who thought I didn't survive
And that I faced my end that night
You should know by now. I'm truly alive!

That force creates a place for those
Who have used that magic force
This is the place where we spend eternity

Where I am called Shadow Land
Like ghosts in the dark
To be free, I found and I believe
That I get out of here, forevermore

I am the silent voice, in his wicked mind
I rule, I command him, until I find the way, out from here.

Out in the light, lead me tonight, please set me free
Glory insight with power and might you have to
Save me tonight, lead me to light, you are my key
Help me survive, from the dark night, I need you now

Closing the land where I improve
Where I show my final move
Then you all can see that I am truly alive

Now fast, I cannot wait
We must head in to that gate
There is the temple where we use the force

Iâll be free, eternally
My mind and my soul
Can you see, could you just believe
I find the way, back to life again

Out in the light, lead me tonight, please set me free
Glory insight with power and might you have to
Save me tonight, lead me to light, you are my key
Help me survive, from the dark night, I need you now

I am the silent voice, in his wicked mind
I rule, I command him, until I find the way, out from here.

Out in the light, lead me tonight, please set me free
Glory insight with power and might you have to
Save me tonight, lead me to light, you are my key
Help me survive, from the dark night, I need you now
