I see the arms of emptiness, surrounds me
When colours of this world began to bleed

I hear how the voice is telling me, demanding
When the sounds of this world starts to seed

You canât remember what you did that night?
Behold the things inside your mind
And now you see it almost every time
You just have to follow my sign

I feel the demon inside of me it's growing
Everything that it tells, sounds so good, so right

You canât remember what you did that night?
Behold the things inside your mind
And now you see it almost every time
You just have to follow my sign

Time is the vision which will burn, love of my heart (love of my heart)
I have to find what causes this pain,
which makes me insane, like a burning flame inside my veins (Inside my veins)
This must be a dream, this must be a lie
I must find the reasons why

You canât remember what you did that night?
Behold the things inside your mind
And now you see it almost every time
You just have to follow my sign

Time is the vision which will burn, love of my heart (love of my heart)
I have to find what causes this pain,
which makes me insane, like a burning flame inside my veins (Inside my veins)
This must be a dream, this must be a lie
I must find the reasons why
Time is the vision which will burn, love of my heart (love of my heart)
I have to find what causes this pain,
which makes me insane

This black ocean, among these stars
I am wounded inside, filled with scars
My only friend this silent voice
I must follow his rules, it's my only choice

Where am I going? I don't know but I am far
Father I am sorry, all those things that I've done... 

I fly alone in the night
Those stones and that sword by my side
My mind, tells me one line:
Believe me and
Fly alone in the night
Those stones and that sword by my side
My mind, tells me one line:
Believe me and you'll be one of a kind
