[Japanese Bonus track]

I see that boy, he scares me
He has the power to see
I feel the wings inside his soul
We are the race to be gods
He presenting the race to be lost
But still I fear his cloudy mind

I canât see where he travels
I fear his path might stumble
To our secret powerful dark divine
We must go to our homeland
Before that child, that's our plan
Weâll need to take the stones from him

In the silence, this time
Iâll try to guide our journey
More faster, before him

This is madness, save us from emptiness
Help us find the saviour
From your kindness not your hate
Sadness, I am the only one in this madness, will you please forgive my soul

I see my ship disappearing
I fear my life soon ending
How could we been so blind to see
Now itâs time for final prayer
But I donât think thereâs Saviour
Iâll die knowing the reasons why

In the silence, this time
Iâll try to guide our journey
More faster, before him

This is madness, save us from emptiness
Help us find the saviour
From your kindness not your hate
Sadness, I am the only one in this madness, will you please forgive my soul
This is madness, save us from emptiness
Help us find the saviour
From your kindness not your hate
