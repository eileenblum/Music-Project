Iâm writing again, alone in the dark
My last love letter, lines go like thisâ¦
When I saw you the first time, your eyes shine so bright
There I was by your side, just warm emotions.

Itâs only a sweet memory and far from our past, forever it lasts
and when I'm looking to your eyes, I feel those feelings again
And I know I am alive

I am alive!
Doesnât matter where we are
From time to time
I wish I could never leave
I am alive!
Screaming from this empty room
Give me a sign
Before they will end my dream.

I'm staring at the stars as a sign inside my room
How they dance on my floor, like we did long ago
flowing around, free from all, dancing together, like we did before

Itâs only a sweet memory and far from our past, forever it lasts
and when I'm looking to your eyes, I feel those feelings again
And I know I am alive

I am alive!
Doesnât matter where we are
From time to time
I wish I could never leave
I am alive!
Screaming from this empty room
Give me a sign
Before they will end my dream.

I wish you wake from this dream, what you see
I miss you so, here beside me
I cannot help you, I am too weak
but my feelings keep me alive

I am alive!
Doesnât matter where we are
From time to time
I wish I could never leave
I am alive!
Screaming from this empty room
Give me a sign
Before they will end my dream.
