As I see the light in the sky
Memories travel far back in time
Our journeys among these mountains
in this land of a thousand tales

Thoughts fly far in my past
Everything has gone so fast
Time just flows around me

If I could travel back in time
Would I try to change my life?
Or would I do it all the same

Sometimes I wish that I could be there
Right beside you, guide the way
Now I'm helpless and Iâm waiting
You have the keys in your hands to save our future

As I see the light in the sky
Memories travel far back in time
Our journeys among these mountains
in this land of a thousand tales

No matter how hard we tried
He couldn't find the peace of mind
to stay here in our lifeâs

Now heâs travelling away
there are no more words to say
I must try to carry on

Sometimes I wish that I could be there
Right beside you, guide the way
Now I'm helpless, only waiting
You have the keys in your hands to destroy our future

As I see the light in the sky
Memories travel far back in time
Our journeys among these mountains
in this land of a thousand tales

As I see the light in the sky
Memories travel far back in time
Our journeys among these mountains
in this land of a thousand tales
As I see the light in the sky
Memories travel far back in time
Our journeys among these mountains
in this land of a thousand tales
