Staring shapeless shadows, under the sky of hallow
Prepare to be the chosen hero, release the force to us.

Between a calm and thunder, beginning of this plunder
This could be our last trip. Last challenge of our race.

Hear our voices, screaming out your name
Devastationâ¦

Feels like endless journey, has started in this night
We know you have the power, which can erase all worlds away.

Fearing, youâre holding
the stones of destruction
No feelings, no sympathy
Weâre chasing your shadows

Staring shapeless shadows, under the sky of hallow
We wonât ever stop the fight, this time we will survive

Hear our voices, screaming out your name
Devastation

Our final journey will stop at this night
You are now the fallen evil, so retreat with all you might.

Fearing, youâre holding
the stones of destruction
No feelings, no sympathy
Weâre chasing your shadows

Unreality, that's what you believe
Too blind to see, the missing key
Until it all will be too late
Unreality, like immortality
Your end has come, it will be done
We are here to claim what we have won

Fearing, youâre holding
the stones of destruction
No feelings, no sympathy
Weâre chasing your shadows

Unreality, that's what you believe
Too blind to see, the missing key
Until it all will be too late
Unreality, like immortality
Your end has come, it will be done
We are here to claim what we have won
