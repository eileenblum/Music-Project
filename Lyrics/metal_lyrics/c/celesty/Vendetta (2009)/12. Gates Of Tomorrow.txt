[Japanese Bonus Track]Can't believe that you find your peace
by insulting me for eternity, overly, 
But underneath your frozen heart 
there's a hatred for me 
that you keep warm secretely 

I know you are afraid of my words 
which are meaningless solely fear in emptiness
somehow you'll describe this world, 
hiding all your thoughts and trying to live in bitterness 

Shame on you my immortal soul 
our future was sealed by these chains 
that kept me from being home 

I Believe its a better way 
and ill choose this path, 
but you can choose your own now
why do you close your eyes, 
you should look into mine 
for this one last time cause

I am closing the gates of tomorrow,
Everything from my past 
burns away with destiny, 
As Im closing the gates of tomorrow, 
Hopefully you wont hear my voice in memories... 
Voice in memories!...

I remember, those words so unreal, 
surrender, without sheding a tear, 
together forever with you,
you said it, by yourself one last time, 
maybe, there was air filled with signs, 
I wont ever return to your frame, 
but how long can you hate my name? 

Shame on you my immortal soul, 
my future was sealed by these chains, 
that kept me from being home!

Dont you think this is a better way 
that you choose your path and I choose my own now,
its time to close your eyes 
and I dont want to see any tears you'll shed for me

I am closing the gates of tomorrow, 
Everything from my past burns away with destiny, 
As im closing the gates of tomorrow, 
Hopefully you wont hear my voice in memories!
