Fortres of evil will spread its wings.
This darkness will rain within.
Face their fire, do now fear their flames.
This battle will end in our name.
When the sun arises, we open the gates through this wall.
And behind that wall lies an enemy who fights for destiny.

I am the Lord of this Kingdom.
He is the lord of this world.
I am the Master of the wind.
He is the Master of the wind.
Carry your brothers if they die, through Hell they survived.
We carry the sword on our shoulders until the end of time.

Power of thunder and this shaking earth.
Our enemies they will lie in dirt.
Prisoners they will rise, they will be my guide.
This army will stand by my side.
When the sun arises, we open the gates through this wall.
And behind that wall lies an enemy who fights.

All will fall after twilight, heroes of past will never fade.
