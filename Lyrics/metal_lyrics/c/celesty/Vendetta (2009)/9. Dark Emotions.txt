Where are you hiding, I'm searching for you.
Are you so scared that you don't know what to do?
Say what you want I believe it's nothing new.
No tears to shed it's just the game between us two.

Invitation inside of these walls.
Revelations of destiny calls.
Your endless screams I still hear them in dreams.
And I know when your power will fall.

Why don't I fear all these games what you play?
Maybe it's time to feed the words of the day.
Believe what you want but understand what you say.
I've tried to teach you but why won't you obey.

Like looking through thin ice in the light.
I'm blinded and cold, awaiting dark emotions untold.
These hands foretell my destiny, they say, help saving this world beckons a new brighter day.

Follow these rules and this world will be free.
You still believe this still holding your key.
Say what you want I believe it's nothing new.
No tears to shed it's just the game between us two.
