This setting in time creates some memories.
I can't believe I still feel sympathy for you.
When you hear about this can you live peacefully?
I believe your thoughts are filled with mysteries.
Oh, how I hate when I am right, blame me for hate and greediness.
Oh, its strain that spurs this fight, fight...
You are so clear and I see through you, if I want I can guess you're every move!

Oh, how I hate when I am right, blame for hate and greediness.
Oh, its strain that spurs this fight, fight...
Time to Rise, I rise from the grave.
I'll lead your people against your reign someday.
Rise, I rise from the grave.
I know your name, so feed this game and set me free.

This burning night gives me strength again.
I will be here and I await you in line.
And this time I won't surrender.
It's my fate to remember.
