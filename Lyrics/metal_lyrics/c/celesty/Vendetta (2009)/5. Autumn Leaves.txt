I'm waiting for you.
In dreams I am with you.
I know that you do miss me too.
Again the snow has covered this earth and it freezes the ground.
I can't imagine where this road leads my life without you.
Oh, how I wish that all could be, like it was here before.
Want to believe that you are here on this beautiful day.

Like the wind blows away, leaves of autumn days, you flew away.
On this first winter day, I've no words to say, if you could stay.
Till the end of this maze, as the dark blind my day.
You'll be safe with me here, we have nothing to fear and light, will be on our side.

Where have you been for all these years, I've been thinking of you.
You left me standing in the coldness, alone in the dark.
Do you remember all the words that you said, before you left?
It doesn't matter now, cause we both know it was a mistake.

Still waiting for you.
In dreams I am with you.
I know that you do miss me too.
Where can you be, do you know I'm still searching.
I think of your name, everyday.
Where we got lost, this place is still far away.
Will there be a day, when you cross my way?
