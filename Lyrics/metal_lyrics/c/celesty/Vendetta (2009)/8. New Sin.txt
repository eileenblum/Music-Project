You gather together the congress of fools.
Your grand high intentions are shown by the proof.
Why waste your life while little leeches only feed them selves.
While lost in deep shadows we strove for the goal, your wiles won't protect you, resistance made null.
Heroes of yesterday, will rise from the dark.

Build your stories with lies.
Envy dressed in disguise.
Share this mask with the weak.
And enjoy 'cause it's...
Time for a new sin.
Get down, take their side and you'll win a bright future.
Believe this and you'll find yourself filled with sadness.
Time for a new sin.
Get down, take their side and you'll win a bright future.
Fear when the sky is covered with wings of darkness.

You call me a dark lord, I lead this dark path.
My servants, unfaithful, they grieve my commands.
The end comes to show all along you should have known.

-When I walk among these valleys, and when I close my eyes, I know who you are, I see your faces filled with lies.-

The end is near so prepare, these dark forces won't fail.
