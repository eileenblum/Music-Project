I'm awake, can you see me?
I feel clean air inside of me.
There's no chance to dream, it's real, I can feel it.
I've come to the rescue, my mind is so powerful.
This land will guide me.
I'm free can't you see me?

Hear my call, with these men I won't fall.
The gods of power and might will defeat your knights.
Like warriors they travel with me.
United we stand and this land will be free.
Warriors raise your swords up high.
Tonight we unleash pure Hell.

I sense the evil, it's growing all the time with force.
We have to be fast, we have to be glorious.
Courage will help me, the power will grow inside.
These men will guide me, I'm free can't you feel me?

See us all, the army of light.
Our onward march, the time is now.
Honour and pride, glory and might.
It's the time for us all to fight.
