Take me away from this cold alley, recall these words before I'll die.
This is my end you need to carry, no turning back, it's my last time.

I know this night will be the last one for me, I feel so cold and I'm alone.
Save this land from that evil we've sown.
So, I can live free as a spirit in the sky.
Fading away, it's sealed in this stone wall.
Fading away, can you hear my last call.

I was so close to end this battle.
I was afraid, I couldn't see you still live, it's all that matters.
Now you can own this victory.

I know this night will be the last one for me, I feel so cold and I'm alone.
Save this land from that evil we've sown.
So, I can live free as a spirit in the sky.
Fading away, it's sealed in this stone wall.
Fading away, can you hear my last call.
These eyes can't see your light.
Only the weak are afraid to die, so I'm fading away.
I've been waiting for you there, behind dark light.

Welcome inside, I saved this seat for you, so enjoy my mind.
I've got your memories here, so close your eyes!
It's your last time.
