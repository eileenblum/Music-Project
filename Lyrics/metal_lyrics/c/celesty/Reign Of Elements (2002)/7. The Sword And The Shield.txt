[Shermin]
Great Spirits hear me
We are hopeless can't you see
There must be one key
You have to set us free

[Amardon]
Now I see a bright light in the sky
Great Spirits, they fly

[Shemin contacts the Great Spirits of the Cryon]

[Shemin]
Spirits know what to do
You gave us the sky so blue

[Amardon]
The light turns to fire
Great Spirits come closer

Spirits in the sky
Among the flames they fly
Fire burning high
Voices on our mind...

[The Great Spirits of the Cryon]
We'll create you a sword from the stones
And the shield that protects you
We'll give you the courage to fight
It's all we can do to help.

[Shemin]
Now to Graynell you go!
Breton's warriors will help you
From Sendell you find...
Cruelty of the darkest mind

You must fight for our freedom
You have to kill Delinom

[Amardon travels to Graynell to collect his troops]

[Amardon]
With my troops I'll ride
To Sendell this sword by my side

I know that the Spirits are near
In my mind I won't feel the fear

Spirits in the sky
Among the flames they fly
Fire burning high
Voices in my mind...

[The Great Spirits of the Cryon]
We'll create you a sword from the stones
And the shield that protects you
We'll give you the courage to fight
It's all we can do to help.
[Amardon]
I have to survive!

[Amardon arrives to the town of Sendell]
