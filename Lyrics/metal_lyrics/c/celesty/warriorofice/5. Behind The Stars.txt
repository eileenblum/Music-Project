[Spoken by: Warrior of ice &amp; Gods of Cryon]

[Warrior of ice:]

I'm all alone
And the silence is filling the air
Oh how pure all is here again

I look in the sky
Dark clouds are moving away
I have won the land back the same

Behind the stars
The gods are looking for me "they say"
You can come here with us

And I'm flying so high in the sky
I'm flying away so far and so high
The gods ask me by their side
To take care of the people from there "all the time"

[Warrior of ice:]

The gods tell me truth
That my mother tried to be good
And I should be proud of her

[Gods of Cryon:]

She kept town alive
By keeping your father in deep ice
She could stayed here with us

But now that she's gone
And the place is open for you
Only you know what to do

[Warrior of ice:]
And I'm flying so high in the sky
I'm flying away so far and so high
The gods ask me by their side
To take care of the people from there "all the time"

[Solo]

And I'm flying so high in the sky
I'm flying away so far and so high
The gods ask me by their side
To take care of the people from there

And I'm flying so high in the sky
I'm flying away so far and so high
The gods ask me by their side
To take care of the people from there "all the time"
