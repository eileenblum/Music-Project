[Spoken Word by: Sir Agathos, The Storyteller]

[Sir Agathos:]

Long time ago in a place called Cryon was a little town. The town had been under
ice for many years and the people had been suffering for far too long. The oldest
and wisest man of the town tested the warriors because some day he would have
to send one of them to find out what causes the eternal winter. Up to the mountains
were a castle where no one had ever been and the only way in there were through
the forest of eternal night.

One day the right man were found. The chosen Warrior wore his best armor and
saddled his horse. He took his fire sword and ice shield and left on an unforgettable
journey up to the mountains. This tale follows the warrior.

The warrior of ice.
