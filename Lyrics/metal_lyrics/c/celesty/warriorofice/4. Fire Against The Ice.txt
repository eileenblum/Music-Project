[Spoken By: Warrior of ice &amp; Firelord]

[Warrior of ice:]

[Noise:] what's that loud noise
It couldn't ever rise, it's sealed in cold blue ice
[Flames:] all has burst in flames
What has caused this haze all I see is blaze

[Father:] someone woke my father
He's heading to the castle I must fight

[Firelord:]

[Son:] you are my only son
Leaving this fight will be just one

[Warrior of ice:]

Now I must rise my sword up high
It won't matter do i live or die
I'll fight my father until someone falls
This is the crossroad of my life
Kill thy father and live or die
Either way you lose you pride
Who will say who will decide
This is the crossroad of my life

[Ice:] mother's cold ice
It could stop the flames and end this endless fight
Blast: The fight's over at last
They both are gone nobody has won

The way to stop the flames was near
I lost my mother, she had no fear
She took his power of ice and
Jumped in to
the fire chest of flames
Now both my MA and PA are gone
I must try to carry on
I'll fight till the end of days
On through eternity, and beyond

[Solo]

Now I must rise my sword up high
It won't matter do i live or die
I'll fight my father until someone falls
This is the crossroad of my life
Kill thy father and live or die
Either way you lose you pride
Who will say who will decide
This is the crossroad of my life
