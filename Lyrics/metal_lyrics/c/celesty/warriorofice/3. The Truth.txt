[Spoken by: Warrior of ice &amp; Ice Queen]

[Warrior of ice:]

As I look deep in the dark
I can see great ice queen
She's starts to tell me the story

[Ice Queen:]

I knew that someday you will come
You're my one and only son
I can prove it if you want

Before the coldness and the snow
Town was possessed by evil force
Who enslaved the people

He wanted town to his command
And he killed those who resisted
I made it conclude

So I froze him under our town
Or he would forced all of us down

Here: Some times ago
Our world was ruled by the mighty eagle
Who tried to kill all the "life" in this place
By using his fire and rage

But this time when you came here
I lost the control of his "life"
I must keep him deep ice

He is your father fire lord
He won't die by any sword
You must try to believe

The only way to keep the town alive
Is coldness and winter all the time

Here: Some times ago
Our world was ruled by the mighty eagle
Who tried to kill all the life in this place
By using his fire and rage

[Solo]

The only way to keep the town alive
Is coldness and winter all the time

There: Was the reason for you
There's nothing else that you can do
Here: Some times ago
Our world was ruled by the mighty eagle
Who tried to kill all the life in this place
By using his fire and rage
