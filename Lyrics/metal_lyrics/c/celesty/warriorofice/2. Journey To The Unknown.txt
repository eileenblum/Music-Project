[Spoken by: Warrior of ice]

[Warrior of ice:]

To the unknown I must ride
On my black armor and sword by my side
To prove that I'm man worth my pride
To find a solution to break the blue ice (yeah!)

The forest of eternal night,
And up to the mountains I see shining light
My shield will help me to survive
As I come to the castle which caused all the ice (and cold)

Must find the way: Inside!

Ride, and find what lies beneath the ice
On with my sword and gods roll thy dice
Truth will be found
And I will seek , fight another round

Down, in the cold I'll find unseen
The castle of snow the home of Ice Queen
I'll stop the frost
And I will fight I wont be lost, until it's done
I fought, I won my way in
After the bloodshed the armies gave in
I went deep inside a big blue hall
My eyes stood still as I gazed at big wall

Voice said "you must stop thy fight!
It's not what you think what is in thy sight
I will fight you, I will defeat you
I'll rip your cold heart and melt with my fire sword

There's no help for you: Now!

Fight, and find what lies beneath the ice
On with my sword and gods roll thy dice
Truth will be found
And I will seek, fight another round

Down, in the cold I'll find unseen
The castle of snow the home of Ice Queen
I'll stop the frost
And I will fight I wont be lost, until it's done

[Solo]

Ride, and find what lies beneath the ice
On with my sword and gods roll thy dice
Truth will be found
And I will seek , fight another round

Down, in the cold I'll find unseen
The castle of snow the home of Ice Queen
I'll stop the frost
And I will fight I wont be lost, until it's done
