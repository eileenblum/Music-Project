[Amardons army:]
We are the army of light.
Against the darkness we'll fight.
And this land will survive, it won't die.
War from honour and pride.

[Reptilians:]
We have come here to get those four stones.
And that macigal sword.
Like the storm, we take over your land.
And this whole universe.

[Amardon:]
There's no time for retreat or give up.
Must fight and defend our pride.
Spirits, give us more courage and might.

[Hagal:]
And fight with us, struggle with us.
To the end of this war.

[Viviathans:]
Now for the glory and the might you'll have to fight
We'll give our power into your hearts.
We'll fight by your side.

[Reptilians:]
It's your time to stand.
Now fight for your land.

[Amardons army:]
We are the army of light.
Against the darkness we fight.
And this land will survive, it won't die.
War from honour and pride.

[Amardon:]
We have the reason to fight.
And defend what is right.
Our land will survive, it won't die.
War from honour and pride.

[Reptilians:]
Your friend won't survive of this hit.
There is too much force with it.
He gave us the sign where he is.
And now he must die.

[Amardon:]
Hagal, you cannot die here tonight.
We still have to fight side by side.
When he's laying beside of me. (He says)

[Hagal:]
Fight for this land, You have to stand
To the end of this war

[Viviathans:]
Those stones will soon appear in Dale now travel in there.
We give our power into your heart
We fight by your side

[Reptilians:]
Now where you will go?
We have to know!

[Amardon:]
I'll ride.

Now I can see how the darkness follows.
I must ride fast and get the sword and the stones.
I feel how the evil is coming too near.
But I must ride I cannot fear.
Viviathans voice I can here.

[Viviathans:]
You have the power and might
And your sword by your side
We help you to survive, we will guide
Now, together we'll fight.

[Amardon:]
We have the reason to fight.
And defend what is right.
Our land will survive, it won't die.
War from honour and pride.
