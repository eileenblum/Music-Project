[Japanese Bonus Track]

[Amardon:]
Look at our son playing on the green fields
He looks so happy with his friends do you see

[Shemin:]
But that strange look in his eyes almost unreal
He's been acting strange now what could it be?

Someday he'll be the great leader you know
It's a great burdon to carry by your own

[Amardon:]
Yes but our son is strong he will survive

[Shemin:]
I'm not so sure just look into his eyes

[Amardon:]
Don't worry my dear he will be just fine now
Trust me and you will see

[Shemin:]
Everynight in my dreams I see
There's evil in his eyes
Although, I don't know what it means
It's not real, it's just a dream

I was scared when I opened my eyes
It was my son, right by my side
I didn't know what to do so I ran away
He shouted to me, please mom stay

[Edel:]
Don't worry my mom I will be just fine now
Trust me and you will see

[Shemin:]
Everynight in my dreams I see
There's evil in his eyes
Although, I don't know what it means
It's not real, it's just a dream
