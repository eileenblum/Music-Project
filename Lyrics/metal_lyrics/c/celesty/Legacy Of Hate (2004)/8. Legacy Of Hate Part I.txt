[--- Blood of enemies ---]

[Shemin:]
When I bring the stones inside and I lay them on the floor.
I hear the steps from other room Edel's coming from the door. My son is watching me with strange look in his eyes.
His voice starts to chance and my heart turns to ice.

Years ago, so I've been told
That the blood of our enemies was put in his soul
Now I have found seed of darkness, he is bound
There's no cure for my son or for plague that they have done.
There's no cure.

[--- Before the sword ---]

[Viviathans:]
Listen what your heart will desire.
And protect all the stones from the dark.
You can't fear the unholy fire
Or the evil will know where you are.

[Shemin:]
Seed of evil has been planted years ago
Before the birth of my man, from darknesses hand.
Just pure evil they infected their souls.
They tainted Amardon, also Delinom.

Evil blood is running through their veins.
Can`t find a cure to remove all these stains.

Those times before the sword, everything was fine.
No one knew about it's source or the power what it causes.
Times when I was God we were safe from the dark.
Now the blood from our enemies is controlling son.

[Viviathans:]
Don't fear the unholy fire
Or the evil will know where you are.

[Shemin:]
Voice of evil speaking trough my dear son.
Says that,

[Voice:]
Your end is near the new king is here

[Shemin:]
With great powers he strokes me to the floor

[Edel:]
No mom why

[Voice:]
Now, you must die

[Shemin:]
Last thing I see he's runnig out from the door
Is this my own blood, I see on the floor?.

Those times before the sword, when everything was fine
No one knew about it's source or the power what it cause.
Times when I was God we were safe from the dark.
Now blood from our enemies is controlling son.
Is controlling son.

[--- Confused thoughts ---]

[Solo]

[--- Betrayal ---]

[Shemin:]
My son has betrayed me tonight.
Darkness growing, I can't see the light.
There's no hope no faith for me at all.
Is this the time when everything will fall?
I lose my son.

[Edel:]
As I walk down the stairs I can hear that voice again.
Something flashes in my eyes and it feels like I'm insane.
Where am I going I don't know but something makes me walk.
I should stop but then those voices start to talk.

[Shemin:]
Years ago, so I've been told
That the blood of our enemies was put in his soul
Now I have found seed of darkness, he is bound
There's no cure for my son or for plague that they have done.

[One of the Viviathans:]
Now all is vanished, the whole universe will be gone.
If we lose the stones this land will be undone.
They can rule the elements fire, earth, wind and ice.
They will destroy everything and we have no chance rise.

[Shemin:]
My son has betrayed me tonight.
Am I dying? I can't see the light.
There's no hope no faith for me at all.
This is the time when everything will fall.
And I'll lose my son.
