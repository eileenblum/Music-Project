[Viviathans:]
With the power and might
We must fight till we die
Protecting the man with the stones in his hand.
The power of stones is your one chance to win.
If they get them, then all will be lost.

[Amardon:]
I armor my troops.
And saddle my horse.

[Viviathans:]
With the power and might you must head for the fight or die.

[Amardon:]
Die without honour.

[Reptilians:]
From your fear we get rage
Kill your warriors slay your mage(s)

[Viviathans:]
Protecting the man with the stones in his hand or die

[Reptilians:]
Die, now, human, scum

[Viviathans:]
With the power and might you must head for the fight

[Amardon:]
Hagal must not die today.
We must keep the enemy away.

The battlefield of hope is where we stand a side together
The power from the stones we have
They rule this land forever.
The darkest army of universe is here.

Battleships and warriors
Too much for an eye to see.

[Viviathans:]
With the power and might you must head for the fight or die

[Reptilians:]
Die by our hand

The man, with the force, Kill him now, Kill him now
[Viviathans:]
Protecting the man with the stones in his hand or die

[Amardon:]
Die, he must not.

[Viviathans:]
With the power and might you must head for the fight

[Amardon:]
Hagal must not die today.
We must keep the enemy away.

The battlefield of hope is where we stand a side together
With power from the stones we have
They rule this land forever.
The darkest army in universe is here.

[One of the Viviathans:]
If Hagal dies, or you happen to fail.
Stones will appear back to Dale.
Prepare your best man and take them then leave.
Go and protect the Dale whit arms and steel

[Amardon:]
There they come with large army I see.
Ground is shaking I feel that in me.
Two of creatures look down to me

[Reptilians:]
Give us the stones or you never be free

[Amardon:]
I raise my sword up to the sky
Tell my troops be ready to go
I look back in their eyes with pride
And shout proudly no!

[Amardon:]
Battlefield of hope is where we stand a side together
With power from the stones we have
They rule this land forever
The battlefield of hope is where we stand a side together
With power from the stones we have
They rule this land forever
The darkest/greatest army in universe is here

[Viviathans:]
With the power and might we must head for the fight or die
