[Hagal:]
Blue lighnings, is all I can see.
All those powers I feel them in me.
Now I feel I'm invincible.
And I know that I am, unbreakable.

I feel the fire, it's burning my eyes.
And how the water is melting from ice.
I could control the wind with my mind.
There's no one like me, in this mankind

[Amardon:]
A feet up in the air.
Fire lighnings everywhere.

[Amardon / Shemin:]
Now we must ride to the town of the wind.
Where the spirits erase the power away
We have to ride to the town of the wind.
So they could help our son someday

[Hagal:]
Now you can only pray.
They cure the rage away.

There's too much power inside of my heart.
I can't control the way in the dark.
Tomorrow will be better day.
After the night, we continue the way.

A feet up in the air.
Fire lighnings everywhere.

[Amardon / Shemin:]
Then we must ride to the town of the wind.
Where the spirits erase the power away.
We have to ride to the town of the wind.
So they could help our son someday.

[Hagal:]
Now you can only pray.
They cure the rage away.

[Viviathans:]
Now, listen, you must here us
This journey, has to end here.
You are in great danger.
And if you don't here we cannot help.

[Shemin:]
What is this, are you in my dream
You told us to use the force.
And bring it to the altar.
Where you can erase the power away.

[Amardon / Shemin:]
Now we must ride to the town of the wind.
Where the spirits erase the power away.
We have to ride to the town of the wind.
So they could help our son someday.
Now we must ride to the town of the wind.
Where the spirits erase the power away
We have to ride to the town of the wind.
So they could help our son someday

[Hagal:]
Now you can only pray.
They cure the rage away.
