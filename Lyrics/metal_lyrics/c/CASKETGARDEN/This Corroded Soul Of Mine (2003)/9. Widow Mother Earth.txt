The black curtain blinds our sun again
Man of nature - nature of man
Playing god again
Over and over again...
Mother!

The black canvas is falling down again
Hate-murder-art patterned after
This blackened bastard
How can we paint the reality?
Mother!

Hail hail - sun father
Close your eyes and the world goes under
And all the mankind shall growling to be saved
Hail hail - sun father
Who will mourn the day?

Comprehension beyond eternal void
Made belief narrow mind whose eyes will tear
Whose eyes will prove...
...The unconcievable ?

Mother!

My widow mother earth
Look at this black sun through your tear-stained veil
And burn your pestilenced weed away!
Life-giver
Lonlier
Widow mother earth
