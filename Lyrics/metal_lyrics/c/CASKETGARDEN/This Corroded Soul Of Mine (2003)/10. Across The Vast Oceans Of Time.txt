Through infinite dreams of chaos
On the day when silence died
There's a place that we rule - we, the blind
Where our soul of hate can rest
And where ashes turn to dust
Where the chains will be broken, the chains of "must"

Tears of mourning, cold deception-
The only castaway I am
Burn these hollow shores of ocean-
Let the celebration begin!

Through thousands of burning sorrows
Across the vast oceans of time
My journey finally ends in my mind
Where the flag of hate can rest
Where the beauty should be found
Why is it so? I look back and there is the light

...Where the ashes turn to dust
Where the flag of hate can rest
Where the beauty can be found
Fear will rise!
