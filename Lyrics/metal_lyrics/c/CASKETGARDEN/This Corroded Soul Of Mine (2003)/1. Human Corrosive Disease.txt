Unborn into a dying world of waters
Unable to inhale this corrosive disease
Rising and tearing this world apart
Corrosive disease
Lifeless and soulless urge in me
Bloody need (to hate)

Thrown out in this pale grey skied-utopia
Bled out my shapeless cell, my embryonic seed

In the deserts of rust I wander
In the deserts of rust I hide
This corroded soul of mine
Infected-murdered-dead

Unborn into a dying world of waters
Unable to inhale this corrosive disease
This human cancer needs no cure or wonder
Through the obscure womb I see
The bloody need to hate
To smash it all away

Human corrosive disease
