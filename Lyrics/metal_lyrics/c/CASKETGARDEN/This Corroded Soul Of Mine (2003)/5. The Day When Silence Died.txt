This sea of tears
And the oceans we've bled
Divide
Our continents of fear and blind

In the shade of a new sun
Creating an other world of lies

Cry mankind
Let the screaming lava
On the day when silence died

Liquid lead in your ears
Melting brainburning mute
Lies
Hydrogen toadstoole forge of the blind

Screaming, bursting,the lead gates of thinking
Let flow the raging sorrow again and again

Forever burn!

(Within-the only living atom-the only whispering black hole)
But I will scream
I will scream down the dams
With bursting oceans we've bled
Cry
Re-opening the seven gates of hell

In the shade of our old sun
Destroying this widow earth

Forever burn! Burn!
