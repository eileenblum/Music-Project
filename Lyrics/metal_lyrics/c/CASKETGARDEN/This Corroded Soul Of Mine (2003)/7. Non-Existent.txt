Until now
I stand here as a middlepoint of a maelstorm
Round and round
Deep inside in my mind
I've inhaled with my burning serpent vacuum
The frozen glances of non-existence

Vacancy
Their dying window pain smiles at me
Time to time
Your shallow, judas soil of mind
Melted by a burning serpent maelstorm
The flaming feelings of a non-existent

I feel your cold steel through my body
Like the only universe of pain

Non-existent non-divine

Lock-jaw fate
Keep at least this embers burning of your hate
Until the time
When comprihends your shallow mind
I am the sinew around the skull of cosmos
...The non-existent

Feel my cold steel through your body
Like the only universe of pain

Non-existent non-divine
