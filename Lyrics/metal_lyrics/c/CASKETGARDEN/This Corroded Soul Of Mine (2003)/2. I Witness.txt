This cubist court room of life
Tribunal genocide
Deformed faces still
Featureless- mentally blind
Mentally blind

All I see - is some light among the sutures of my eyes
I see-this eternal black ink of lies on my death .....certificate

This cubist court room of life
Hand to hand brandishing
Why are you pointing at me
My eyes are sewed I can not see

False witness is the charge against me

Give your bureaucratic knife
Hand to hand brandishing
Since it points at me
Stab in me deep within
