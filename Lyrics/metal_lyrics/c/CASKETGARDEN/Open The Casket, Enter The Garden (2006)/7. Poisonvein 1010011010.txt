Living with this barcode deep inside
Looking through the black cage burnt behind my eyes
Night affection, terminal infection
Binary abscess on this festering nation

[Pre-chorus:]
Black I feel-bleeding still
To mute encoding I close my eyes
I'm rather blind than this barcode inside
Like a tumor ones and zeros burn my bones
I'm without within like mechanical stone
Devaluation, degradation
I'm good at reduced price for this goddamn nation

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
Oh sweet night I'm falling down
I'm poison-veined, generated, enslaved
Hold my arms Embrace me now
Coded and insane I'm poison-veined right now

Poison-veined
...my poison is life

Like clet against machinery seems my war
But all the atoms was believed so undividable
Night affection, terminal infection
I want to be an abscess on this binary festering godforsaken nation

[Chorus]

Poisonvein 666
