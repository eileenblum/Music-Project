Hallucinations of knowledge
The thought you were something existing
Remains from yourself own usurper of your throne
But the mask falls down: spirit unknown

[Pre-chorus:]
No one knew your mind No one felt your sigh
No one wanted to break your heart

[Chorus:]
Joyous thinking Footsteps to leave here
But when heart stops bleeding
Then will be...your spirit unseen, body unknown

Hollow pictures with the razor's edge
Only blood-red paint used on canvas-skin
Remains from yourself at least a brainwashed left behind
a nameless grave-your mirror of life

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

...a nameless grave-the body unknown...

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

...just let it never unknown
