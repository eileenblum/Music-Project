How long you want live this daydream?
While you are sleeping there's nightmare all around

[Pre-chorus:]
God's hands are full - please take mine...

[Chorus:]
...and enter the garden
I will show you the way...

So, pray for me now
Eat-that's my corpus
Drink-that's my blood
And this barrel in the mouth- that's my light

How long will last this utopia?
While you are praying this world comes falling down
This ark is crashing down, but there are other dams to hide
Believe me something, there are new floods on the way

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Enter my garden please take my hand
Feel my cold black steel flowers within
See all this beauty-coins on your eyes
(You won't get in, I whisper)
Cause I'm your mind then it's suicide
Suicide

Release the earthly purgatory
Nothing to unleash you are living here for a while
The bandage of belief important cure for brainwashed minds
Fed your fire, made you forever blind

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

So, pray for me now
Eat-that's my corpus
Drink-that's my blood
And this barrel in the mouth-that's my light
