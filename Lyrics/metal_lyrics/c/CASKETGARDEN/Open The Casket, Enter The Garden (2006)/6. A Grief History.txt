Check this anger...
Our hate crawls flesh to the bone
Enough to look different and one shade of other will open a cause for a war
No wonder it's our fuel fire and food
A warfare instinct spiral

[Pre-chorus:]
If evidence failing
Look into the review-mirror
3 minutes roughing
Is not enough but 2 words are:

[Chorus:]
A brief history
Blood, strength and lies
A brief history
Only grief will rise

...so this means...war...

March - Kill
Rebuild the rain
Our Grave new world needs souls to renew again

But this anger...

[Repeat 1st verse]
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

...only grief will rise
So let's start our war...now!!!
