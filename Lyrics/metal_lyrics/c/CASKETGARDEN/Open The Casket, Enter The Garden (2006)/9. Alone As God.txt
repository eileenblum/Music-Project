Lie me 3 times: love, love, love
Before the rooster wakes they will simply turn into not not not
Who was the apostate, who denied his Lord on this way?
Hey, sorry I don't know I live against these worth

[Bridge:]
Your belief, your life Will fade away in my eyes
Maybe you should do the same Weep out those frozen strength-tears

Have you ever tasted to bid farewell to someone you love love love?
Realized that the kisses were fake not a smile was real not not not
Why I remember your face, the contour of betrayal ways?
Hey sorry I don't know but I can't deny my within (as you)

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Painless within You left me here
Deprivation of my soul to thank
Alone as God I stand

Soulless as god
Scorn my creation
Shut 'em shut your fearful lying eyes
I deny the love
It's my damnation
Fed up with fear I have to dismiss to possess

[Chorus]

...but you lied me 3 times!!!
Maybe I should do the same, weep out those frozen strength tears
Hey, I just wanted to proof: sometimes hurts what's livable

Soulless as god
Scorn my creation
Shut 'em shut your fearful lying eyes
I deny the love
It's my damnation
Fed up with your blood-red weeping lies

[Chorus]
