When you say deaf to me that I'm doin' the wrong
I give a shit on it- cause this is what I like and this's what makes me strong
Red light! red light! dead end station!
Speed on you can't stop my soul-radiation!
...this burning urge in me

[Chorus:]
Jaws through my spine-open my casket to see my face smile
Hammer my coffin nail as deep as you can
I am an anvil- hit me thousand times but I will never bend
Burn me, forge me - devastation
But think it through what you've left behind for this bastard nation

What's your left behind?
Dried blood, pulverized bones, shattered beauty of a shattered man...
But my soul lives on...in these plastic buckets of blood!

Unearth my body and fear my slaughter smile
Realize my beauty and I will be the jaw in your fucking spine
Bury me dig me - soul exhumation

But feel all my fears' and pain's revelation

[Chorus x2]
