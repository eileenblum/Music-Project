Soaring with wings of innocence I saw the Earth's resignation
This 3rd spit of the Sun from above seemed like a teardrop in a black ocean...
...a teardrop of pure emotion

[Chorus:]
You made me unwinged
Separated from my spine and grinded
Yoke instead feathers
but this falling made me sober

From closer world's beauty became disgust as I watched the man's slow swarming
Indifference, jealousy, despise, greed, extortion made the human virus unfolding

[Chorus]

My wings -Your trophy
You're bursting with pride
My pain - Your proof
That you're always right

But to tell the truth I really don't care
You are something I'm not
My soul flies without these wings
As I crawl on the ground till my fingers bleed

Facing the human coldness I resolved to find the missing part of mine
who stands the smell filled the lungs of mine

[Chorus x2]
