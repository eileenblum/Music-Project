Two fathers I had: "survive" and "stay manlike"
While a war of their bloods was raging
I've almost forgotten how is life

No senses I felt Until my fathers' fall
The one killed by the other
Survived as numb and shot like a dog

No mother I had I'm hollow I'm just spawned
She denied me to raise and teaching
That without a within where's pain inside

[Chorus:]
Fire up all senseless
Platoons of my pain march through my vein
Intersection of parallels
Marks the battles we've lost
The place wherever we lay

So I scrounged around for my senses that crawl was so infinite far
It will end beyond horizon where these parallels meet for all

The place I laid is the goal of someone who's looking for the pain

(My fathers are dead - No mother I had
No senses I felt - My half heart was undead)

Where the parallels met I found the part of mine and unchained the burden
Distance made us strong, crawling made us one, we'll cleanse this Sodom
They are the ones who lie living what's lifeless just to stay immortal
But we release our senses and pain to fight in military order

[Chorus]

After us fire floods...
