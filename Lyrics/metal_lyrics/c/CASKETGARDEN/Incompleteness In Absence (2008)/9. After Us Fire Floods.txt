World seemed endless but it fades away
I switched my track from not to dissolve but stay
Slithering to infinity
The crossing I crave it cannot be...

...the point in the distance for railways rasp the unknown
The wish and the dream are different but the sleeper - is the corporate thorn

[Chorus:]
After Us Fire Floods
All is burning
No more dams to hide

All fake roads lead to eternity
My half I missed it was always there for me
Abreast running all the way
Don't look back , let the burning sulphur rain...

...on men of blindness
Transform them to pillars of salt
All of them, to pillars of salt

[Chorus]

As crystal clear eternal crysalis
they died as they lived half-hearted and alone and soulless
Sodium and chloride are lifeless
their pillars of salt are nameless

Let the burning sulphur rain

Fallen leaf I was without a tree
But I found my branch it's always in bloom for me
All the bridges burn on our way
Don't look back - that moment will congeal...In cold structured pain

[Chorus]

After Us Fire Floods
There's no mountain
High enough to build an ark

All the dams are on fire
