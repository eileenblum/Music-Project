Ashes and smouldering
Screaming shades in molten salt
All we didn't find appropiate
We destroy them all, perish them all

Finding a principle
Evil or good to redefine
as we cut all ties to decay
is harder than all - it's the real crawl

[Chorus:]
Dreaming and yearning is bursting our chests Like thorns under rib they bruise until we're dead

Our thirst and all our dreams
Seem to become reality
But all that compassed us fell down
We destroy them all, perish them all

We build the embodiment
Of all evil we feared before
the real tyrants we became
stronger than all we feared before

[Chorus ]

I reclaimed all I had lost
But the doubt in my own self stabs

(I'm maladjusted to myself
I'm not the same man I was
Since I know you I feel that I'm whole
But all that hurts hurts twice)

Hurts twice

Dreaming and yearning is bursting our chests Like thorns under rib our heart they scratch
Our skin's bloodshot gory red They bruise until we're dead

The doubt in my own self stabs
Another mourning comes

The corporate thorn
Hurts twice
