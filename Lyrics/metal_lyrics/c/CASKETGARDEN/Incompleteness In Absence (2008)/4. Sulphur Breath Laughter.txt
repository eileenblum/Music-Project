With every day the whip hits down
Beat by beat you deepen my harm
Tear my wings out, chop down
You can't deny my everlasting fly

[Chorus:]
My everlasting fly
Till my last breath I'm holding on

You are rotten to the bone
You stink like a rat in the hole
Yet you made me serve, pushed me down
I am more abject than you are

[Chorus]

Even if I try
Till my last breath I'M holding on
Hear my sulphur breath laughter

(If you really don't know what hell means...) Come and taste its smell

So I scratch down on the ground
Wound by wound I'm approaching my shell
Unwinged, fallen down
Smell my breath I'm just leaving hell

[Chorus]
