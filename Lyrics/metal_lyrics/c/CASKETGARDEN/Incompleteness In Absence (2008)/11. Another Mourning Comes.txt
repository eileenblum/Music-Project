After all floods has risen
and all anchors are dropped to the deep
We live out of soul abduction
protected by the dams we built
new walls - new martyrs

Brave new world, new world order but all the martyrs are the same: dead

[Chorus:]
Another mourning comes
Another bloodred dawn
Another grave surrounded by my own fiends

Every face looks down on me
Teardrops fall down splattering
Why are those faces so close?
Only six feet from this perspective
Black crowd - same fake tears

All mask's blank featureless like mine It seems like my own funeral - I'm dead

[Chorus]

'Bereavement' is in my dictionary quite close to the 'brave'...to the 'brave new world'

[Chorus]

They wear my mask, face of a regretful martyr Who died for an exception that proves their rule
