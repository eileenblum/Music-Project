The path to the reign of reptiles is paved with negation
The coldest blooded , the strongest nation
They call me weaker, I stand tall
I say I'm closer, they tell I'm far

They vaunt their believed power with oppositions
It's thought-foeticide- mind abortion
They call me brainless, but I've heart
Yet incomplete without love

[Chorus:]
There's no meaning to count my failures, you are something I'm not
Don't compare me to yourself, you're something I'm not

These unspined built a machine for the great abduction
To rip out the last manlike: emotion
They call it sickness, I think it is soul
They call me lesser, but I'm more

[Chorus ]

They want to make me a gear of their machinery
Their will made me resistant, they never will rule on me

My weakness they laughed at it keeps me in motion
To be the plague of this parasite nation
They call me broken, but I soar
They made me unwinged, but I crawl

They call me brainless, but I've heart
Yet incomplete without love

[Chorus]

There's no meaning to stand in my way
'cause I will never give in
Never give in
