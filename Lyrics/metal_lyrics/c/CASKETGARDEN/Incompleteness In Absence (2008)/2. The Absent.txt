Absent through a hollow weight
An ever-hurting pain in vein
Intersection of parallels farthers moreover
The great abductor, the great abductor
Thrusts my soul apart
Fake deceivers, shallow shammers...

[Chorus:]
...tell that I am half
I would show you my twin heart

Distance as dogmatic scheme
Dissolving measure of the frail and weak
but in submission theories invert, turn over
So great dictators, and regulators
It's time to bow down
Fake deceivers, shallow shamers...

[Chorus]

Absent but beating hard

Life-blood that rose too far away

Your so-called "truth" is hate
Covering your wounds like a silken veil
Burden of proof that pulls you down under
If you were on my way
Denial would cut your apathic veins
But I am stronger, two times stronger

Beating hard
Absent but beating

[Chorus]

Absent but beating hard

So great dictators, and regulators
It's time to bow down
Fake deceivers, shallow shamers...
It's time to bow down
Now
