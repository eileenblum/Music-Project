â(Iâm) ashamed of youâ
âYou got me a bad reputationâ
Thousand times I heard

Silent watchers - blind beholders
Your big brothers - ghouls on shoulders
they are your life grinders, idle rollers with nothing to grind 

âBe decentâ
âPlease write in accurate composition
and donât show disrespectâ

Silent watchers - blind beholders
Our big brothers - ghouls on shoulders
they are our life grinders
âsay this say that think it through twiceâ

[Chorus:] 
Fight your fears keep up your courage
They â  the faces of all the (damned)
â¦damned and cursed by this place and age
Are you â the weakest of the fallen                                     

Fallen 

Enjoy - as hold back will is run out of control
Champ the bit â you wanted, turn your face just back for more

Youâre chasing shadows,
You soak up everything you donât wanted and throw off thousandfold

Silent watchers - blind beholders
Expectations - ghouls on shoulders
These are our life grinders, idle rollers with nothing to grind

Haunting retrogression by the faces of all the damned
Cursed by this place and age are you The weakest of the fallen 

[Chorus] 

The weakest of the fallen
