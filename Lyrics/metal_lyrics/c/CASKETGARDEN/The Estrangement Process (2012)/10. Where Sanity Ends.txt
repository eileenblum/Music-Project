Always searching borders of selfishness
When was when âmineâ pushed the mind cross the limits of existence? 

[Pre-Chorus:]
Why these four walls are closing out my soul?
Why my curtains are always black and drawn?
Drawn - curtains are drawn
Drown in my own liquid mind, decomposed rot inside

Iâm always proud of the things that i have got
My nest looks like kingâs castle
Donât question my eternal knowledge
No failures I hadâ¦only the past tense 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Your fake reality with all your love and straightness
that is the place where sanity ends
Where sanity ends 

Let me here in my own liquid in this pigsty
go get a life, but it wonât be as bright as MINE 

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2:]
Iâm the sample thatâs the way to progress
Lock out the argues, bow down and rest
Where sanity ends

But my life just slipt awayâ¦rotten
