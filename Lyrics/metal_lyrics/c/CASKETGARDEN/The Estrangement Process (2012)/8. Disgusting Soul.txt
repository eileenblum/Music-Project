Iâm still holding on. Our future, and all our hopes became ancient
All dreams, our world has shattered, all that mattered.
âCause  one of us has lost all hope, let slip his fears weâve fought for years

 As he faced this I have become a mirror of delusion
â¦a vision...disgusting

Our past was like the highest mountain to climb
If you donât crawl you fall off and youâll never be found (Never be Found)

As he faced this I have become a mirror of selfishness
oh a disgusting soul
a disgusting soul

I helped him to be found by dreams we lived crawling
I cut off all the ties and wake him up falling 

Iâm the one now who paddles in blood: a monstrous birth â ferment - mutagenetic spawn
the life grinder, soul reaper, deceiver, tormentor. death dealer.

I want to keep our dreams as dreams to esteem
I had to wake you up to feel: this mirror is real

As he faced this I have become a mirror of delusion
oh a disgusting soul
oh a disgusting soul
