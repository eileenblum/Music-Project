It rips as your warm embrace transforms into smothering
Whenever our love locks the round and flows forth as a stream of hate

[Chorus:]
These wounds will never heal, never fade
Unlike us, unlike our perpetual faith 

It hurts When your sparkling eyes are eclipsed by my darkest hate
Whenever instead your features I must see your hollow nape 

[Chorus] 

Unlike the perpetual we guessed: faith

This desolation is stamping my chest, like pillars of bleak
Ramming â heart stops bleeding - disinterest is our fate

Forlorn I pose attendance, cut smile on my stone cold face
Whenever wish turns eagerness indifference takes its place

[Chorus]

Wounds never heal
Wounds never fade
Unlike the perpetual we guessed: faith
