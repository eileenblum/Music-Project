Out of this cage
Out of this role of the future survivor
"Today â the aim of your living
donât care of your seeds
the sowing is overâ

Theyâre advertising, stamping apathy - an inner built of machinery

[Chorus:]
A machine within an engine of desperation
They made me suffer, they made me ill

This seed - last of the plants without virus of hate-plague
How to put it, where to and when?
The soil is infected

Theyâre fertilizing the ground with apathy - an inner built of machinery

[Chorus]

Ill of this desolation

Only I have those sparkling dreams?
Only I have those thoughts?
Strobe light visions- ones and zeros again and again 

Every time I think of my seed it burns the freezing cold
The sowing is over, the harvest is on 

[Chorus]

The machine within - the harvesterâs on
The machine within - the harvest is on
