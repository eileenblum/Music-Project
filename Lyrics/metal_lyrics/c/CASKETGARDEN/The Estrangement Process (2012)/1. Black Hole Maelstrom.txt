As your jowl cracks on ground
too late to you realize what have you done
What the fuck lifted you higher?
Vacuum everlasting  - that sucks up even fire

Your eyes are psychopathic
My heart is apathetic
Youâre still pathetic - You locked out your son and my heart

Lock your door one more time
Let all your madness sucking you dry
You dwell in nothingness - slap in the face
A man with sane mind would just burn thisâ¦burn this place

Your eyes are psychopathic
My heart is apathetic
Was your decision: you locked out you got from your heart

[Chorus:]
There was something that took you away
always living those carcass dreams
Black hole maelstrom, mind inception
soaked once you have been

soaked once you have been

Far away from the ground
this spiral graveyard cut all ties that last
Always lifting you high high high
just to strike you down with full blastâ¦full blast

[Chorus x2] 

black hole maelstrom
black hole maelstrom
soaked once you have been

once you have been
