Sneak â sly - weathervane within
Chop and change - for your rapture
Play dead - lay low beneath
Nod and lie - just wait your cremator 

[Pre-Chorus:]
Life light waning
soul strangulation
Gates are closing 
windows to an honest self
windows to an honest self 

Say no-at least itâs time to try
Yes-man - forget your amens
Take on - the minus terminus
You canât - beseem to all others 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
I never knew why you plead for your life - itâs mask itself
the darkness all around is warning 

[repeat pre-chorus from 2nd line]

Sneak â sly - weathervane within
Chop and change - for your rapture
Play dead - lay low beneath
just wait for your cremator

[Chorus]

Your plead for life itâs mask itself
the darkness all around is warning

I closed the gate
