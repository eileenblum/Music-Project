Lifeâs running cataclysmic towards the place called End
All our failures are the missiles
always ready always ready to send

To crush them, to burn them, to doom them, to blame them will tear down our souls

[Pre-Chorus:]
We must spoil before we spin
Leave the red button â itâs time to begin

Our hands are burning continuously but still we touch the fire
How much burns? How much torment?
How much we need to understand the trial

We burnt us. we sold us. we doomed us. to blame them will tear down our souls

[Pre-Chorus] 

[Chorus:]
Itâs harder then all - I confess all 

No past, no skin, no religion - Iâm the one who burned the kingdom 

Itâs our way to purgatory but the worst is yet toâ¦the hell is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]
