Iâm sittin in the darkest corner dejected
Embracing this sweetest bloom  as the rope in a withdrawn suicide â rejected 
I unlock the door of this windswept shed and jaws snap everywhere
This soil is salinized, only weed is blooming - food for the chatterers 

[Pre-Chorus:]
How should I leave her out in the cold? While my life is withering how to bloom yours?

Iâm trembling but I was never afraid as my life is purposeless
Living in this Third Reich is breeding new fuel for the smeltries of soulless

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
No â no â stop to weeping those pitch black tears
No â no â donât embrace me, it always arises my fears
your gentle tenderness reminds me of innocenceâs no place on this Earth
your honest smile strengthens my failures

no - no

Iâm trembling in this darkest corner  dejected
While my life is withering growing this sweetest bloom is banned and out of tune

[Chorus]
