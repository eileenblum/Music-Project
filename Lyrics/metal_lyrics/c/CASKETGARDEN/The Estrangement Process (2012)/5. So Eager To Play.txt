No more deals child, stop bargaining we know it that you can
Weâre demons to some, angels to others â we offer pleasures: the suffering of men

[Pre-Chorus:]
Our visionâs apocalyptic
Of pain pleasure and suffering
A labyrinth your mind createdâ¦

and you created your own hell

Shed no tears child, a waste of suffering, weâll experience your flesh
You want to tread the unknown archways â taste our pleasures: nether regions of death 

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
You opened the box we came
Plain minds, plain ways we found, hollow hearts, shallow fates
So Eager to Play, so hard to admit it beyond all extremes

Beyond all extremes youâre captive of your hell 

Your suffering will be legendary in the deepest ditches of hellâ¦

as a final solution - Explore!  

[Chorus]

So eager to Play, so hard to Admit it
Youâre beyond all extremes

[Pre-Chorus]
