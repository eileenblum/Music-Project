[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

"Scratch, scratch, scratch
That itchy spot
Scratch it, scratch it
Scratch it as it bleeds
Never stop"

Smiling at the eye
Crying inside
You breed the enemy
As they slaughter your pride

Emotionally dying
You're all but alive
Playing the role
You exit yourself, just to survive

Breeding the enemy

Feeding
Starving eyes
With what
The children
Must not see

Wanting to spit
You swollow it all
Dehumanized
You alienate your body
