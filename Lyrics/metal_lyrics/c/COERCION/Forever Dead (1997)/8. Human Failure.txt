[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Invaded by false emotions
My pain becomes unreal

I've given in to the eater of life
I'm nothing but a failure

My body screams for the spirit
That makes the aching stop

I've given in to the eater of life
I'm nothing but a failure

Make me
Emotionless
Rape my
Disordered soul

Life means nothing, defeated
Awake, I dream of death

I've given in to the eater of life
I'm nothing but a failure
