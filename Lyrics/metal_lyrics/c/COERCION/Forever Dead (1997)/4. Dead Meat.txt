[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Enjoy what's left
Of the life you never had
Death now awaits you
Worthless being.....die!

Shaking with lust
As you slowly die
Drooling, I watch
With staring eyes

No hate, no threat
No guilt, no regrets
I just want your flesh

I cut you wide open
And slowly remove your skin
I tear out your entrails
Soon the feast begins

No hate, no threat
No guilt, no regrets
I just want your flesh

Serving your tender
And steaming meat
In slices so tasty
With delight, we feast

Blood flushed down the drain
Skin, bones and bodyparts
Thrown away
