[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Weak minds
In confusion
Ritually raped
By the servants of delusion

Disciple-eyes
Make truth out of lies

Empty lives
Faithfully blind
Easy preys
To the looters of minds

Disciple-eyes
Refuse to see
Twist and make believe

Burn the pages
Destroy the myth of Christ
Silence the preacher
Seal the lips of lies

Holy lies, polluted minds
Lobotomy of a different kind

Disciple-eyes
Refuse to see
Fake reality
