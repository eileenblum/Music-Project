[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Another sleepless night
As dark as my thoughts
A bitter taste in my mouth
See what my life has brought me

Misery
Agony

Begging for rest
No strength to carry on
Once my eyes are closed
I am forever gone

Death
Is calling me
Nothing
Can stop me

Sleepy, as the floor turns red
Relieved to know I'll soon be dead

Slowly fading
Pale and cold as my blood flows
So much more than ready to let go
.....of life

With open arms
I welcome what's to come
My time is now!
