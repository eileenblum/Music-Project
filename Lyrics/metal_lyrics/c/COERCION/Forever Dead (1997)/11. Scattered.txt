Bigmouth
Your threats did not work on me
You stupid fuck
What were you thinking of?

Holding
Your torn-off head
Faceless
It speaks no more

What was your plan?
What did you expect?
Well, barking like a toothless dog
Just doesn't do the trick

Now you look kind of silly
Turned inside out
Head gone, guts spread
So extremely dead

You stood no chance
You were weak to say the least
What you did
Wasn't very clever
