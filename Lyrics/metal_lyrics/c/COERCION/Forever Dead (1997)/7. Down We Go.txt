[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

We are
The human race
The crew
Of a sinking ship

With indifference
At the helm
Downwards
Goes our trip

It's too late for mutiny
So what can we, but die?

Nothing was learnt
Still we deny
The ugly truth
Before our eyes

It's too late for mutiny
So down we go
