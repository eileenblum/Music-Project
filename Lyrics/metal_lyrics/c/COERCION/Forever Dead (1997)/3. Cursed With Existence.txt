[Music: Kenneth Nyman &amp; Rickard Thulin]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

With no prerequisite of living
I'm existing
Only to suffer
Just to breathe means pain

Cursed with existence

With no more blood to bleed
From my burst vains
My heart pounds on
Against all odds

Bearing countless sorrows
Suffering all losses
Infested with vermin
Consuming my twisted soul

Cursed with existence
Touch me and die!

I'm an infernal mass
A world war embodied
Mentally collapsed
I bear chaos within

Touch me and die!
