[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Breaking of the silent dawn
Through a field red from blood
With pride, we march among the dead
Maimed bodies lie buried in mud

March!

Driven by the smell of death
Covered with blood of our enemies
We will march till the very end
Keeping heads as trophies

March!

Until death claims our souls

March!

Until death claims our souls

Charge!
