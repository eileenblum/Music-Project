[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Lacerated
You lie before me
Semi-dead
Soon to meet eternity

Pointlessly pleading, you cry
At my feet, you will die
Coughing blood as you choke
Staring into my eyes

Pathetic
Was your attempt to stop me
Your soul is mine
I am your destiny
Waiting
To see your soul release
The earth and your body
Are soon as one to be

Watching the remains
Lying at my feet
What was your body is now
A reeking pile of meat
