[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Crawling, on bleeding knees
Unable to rise

Degraded, humiliated
In ruins, am I

Cancel the escape
All hope is gone
Everything's lost

Stronger than fear
Darker than death
Greater than life
At the bottom, I've seen it all

I've tasted life's ugly taste
Far to long, now I'm full
There's no way down
From where I am
All I want is to die

Broken
Bludgeoned and weak
Barely human
I'm crawling in filth
