[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Switch On, Switch Off
You Start And Stop
Mentally Bypassed
Company Controlled

Punch In, Punch Out
Once Full Of Life - Look At You Now!

Tick-Tock, Tick -Tock
You Make And Give, Give, Give
With Every Muscle And Bone
Company Property

Punch In, Punch Out
Once A Person - What Are You Now?

Burning Out
Down In The Hole
Where They Made You Fit

Click, Click
Body Fails To Respond
A Tool Out Of Use
Stashed Away

Switch On, Switch Off
You've Been Replaced
