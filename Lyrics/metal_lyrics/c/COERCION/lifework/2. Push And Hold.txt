Life Passed
So Surreal
Like A Very Bad Dream

Review In Black And White
A Glance And I'm Done

Memories Worth Nothing
Forgotten With Ease

Through It All, I Waited
Nothing Showed

Before My Half Closed Eyes
Well Within Reach
Moments Went By
Meant To Be Seized

Traceless Me
Push And Hold
End Of Story

Final Entry
One Last Blank Page
The End Of Me
