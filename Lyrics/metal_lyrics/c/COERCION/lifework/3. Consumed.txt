[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

The Hollow Sound Of My Voice
Echoes Down The Corridors
Where Dreams Died And I Disappeared
Into The Faceless Mass

All And More
Whatever I Once Had
They've Consumed

The Traps Were Set
Long Before I Arrived
Naive And Unscarred
I Stumbled Into Them All

Each Day
A Lesson Learnt Too Late

Unsuspecting Me
The World Stod Ready Waiting
Everyone Took A Piece
Now There's Nothing Left To Steal

Where Once Stood A Man
Lies The Pieces Of An Empty Shell
That No Longer Fit Together
