[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Behind Doors
Locked From Inside
Somewhere In Time
Something Went Terribly Wrong

Former Persons
Since Long Phased Out
Gone

Within Four Walls
Somehow Past Lives Go On

Poisoned Numb
They No Longer Feel
Every Sense Has Been Put To Sleep

Disordered Blank Thoughts
A Wordless Nothing
Now Fills Their Carefree Minds

Inhaling/Exhaling
Time Goes On
Inhaling/Exhaling
Dying Prolonged

Terribly Wrong
On And On
