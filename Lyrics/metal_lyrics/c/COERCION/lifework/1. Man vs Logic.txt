[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

Too Late
Nature Failed
Here We Are
None Will Be Saved

The Farce Went On
Each Phase, A New Low
Evolution - A Worst-Case Scenario

Hope Is Gone
Life Ends With Man
Creation - A Truly Bad Plan

Man Versus Logic

Time To Face
The Given Outcome
Oblivion - Here We Come
