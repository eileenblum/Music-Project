[Music: Kenneth Nyman]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

WITH ALL MY VISIONS SHATTERED
I STRUGGLE TO JUSTIFY
MY OWN EXISTENCE

CHAFED BY TIME
MARKED BY ITS UGLY SCARS
I BURY THE LAST OF MY DREAMS

LIFE PASSES
OUT OF CONTROL
I'M DRIFTING
WITHOUT AIM

FOREVER HAVE I FALLEN
WHEN WILL I HIT BOTTOM?

MISPLACED AND ASTRAY
I DRIFT IN EVERY DIRECTION

BITTER
DISILLUSIONED
OLDER
THAT'S ALL I'VE BECOME
