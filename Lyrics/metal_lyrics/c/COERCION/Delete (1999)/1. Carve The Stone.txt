[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

I'M CALLING OFF THE SEARCH
ACCEPTING DEFEAT
TOO MANY PIECES ARE MISSING

THE JIG-SAW PUZZLE OF LIFE
IS INCOMPLETE

CARVE THE STONE
YOU'RE LOSING ME
I'M A RIDDLE
NEVER TO BE SOLVED

WHEN THE COLD SOIL
WELCOMES ME
TO REST MY BONES
PEACE WILL BE MINE

PREPARE THE COFFIN
DIG THE GRAVE
SOMEWHERE DESOLATE

I'M FACING THE END
WHERE I BEGUN...AND STAYED
- THE FURTHEST FROM GRACE

CARVE THE STONE
YOU'RE LOSING ME
DEATH HOLDS A SECRET
THAT I'M SOON TO KNOW
