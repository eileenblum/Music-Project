[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

PAUSE LIFE
REVALUATION!
SUMMARISED IN ONE WORD
ANTICLIMAX

IS THIS ALL THERE IS?
SO THIS IS
WHAT PASSES FOR LIVING...

ALWAYS CUTTING LOSSES
EACH DAY, A NEW DEFEAT

FROM EXPECTATION
TO FRUSTRATION

A LIFE BELOW ZERO
- THE REWARD OF MY EFFORTS?

SO THE FUTURE WAS THIS...
A DISAPPOINTMENT
TO SAY THE LEAST

THEY LIED TO ME
LIFE HAS NO MEANING
