[Music: Rickard Thulin]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

STOP PRETENDING
I SEE THROUGH YOUR DISGUISE
I SAW THE TEAR
AND I'VE SEEN THE SCARS

HIDING BEHIND A FALSE FACADE
YOU PUT ON THAT TWISTED SMILE
GIVE IT UP, EVERYONE KNOWS

DESPITE ALL YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
AND ALL THAT'S BEEN DONE TO YOU
YOUR TALE REMAINS UNTOLD
NEVER A WORD.....EVER

SILENT, YOU SUFFER
YOUR LIPS STAY SEALED
WHILE YOU'RE SCREAMING WITHIN

SUICIDE - YOUR WAY OUT?
THERE'S MORE TO LIFE
THAN YOU KNOW
IT OFFERS MORE THAN PAIN!

BURST - LEAVE NOTHING UNSAID
AND SURVIVE
