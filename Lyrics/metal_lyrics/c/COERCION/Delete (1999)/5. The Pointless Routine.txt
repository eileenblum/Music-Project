[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

APATHETIC AND NUMB
I SLUMBER THROUGH LIFE

WITH A STILLBORN AMBITION
I BARELY CARE TO BREATH

STAGNATED, I MERELY AGE
STUCK IN LIFE'S PATTERN
THE POINTLESS ROUTINE

PASSING TIME, DECAYING
IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS
THE DIFFERENCE FADES

FROM DUSK TO DUSK
ON, IT GOES
POINTLESS FROM THE START
AND UNTIL THE END

ALIVE OR DEAD?
COULD I EVEN TELL?
HOLDING MY BREATH
JUST TO MAKE SURE...
