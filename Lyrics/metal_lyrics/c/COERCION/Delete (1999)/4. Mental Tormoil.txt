[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

INNER CONFLICT
ME AGAINST MY THOUGHTS
I FOUGHT AND LOST

CHAOS REIGNS
MY MIND IS UNDER SIEGE
NOWHERE IS SAFE
INSIDE OF ME
- MY WORST ENEMY

STUCK IN A MENTAL TRAP
I LOST CONTROL

MY RAGING THOUGHTS
HATE AND DESPISE ME
NOTHING IN ME
WANTS ME ALIVE

I'D GIVE ALL MY BLOOD
FOR A MOMENT OF PEACE

STARING AT MY REFLECTION
AN IMAGE I DON'T RECOGNISE
I'M A STRANGER TO MYSELF

OPEN MY EYES
- TELL ME WHO I AM
TEAR ME OPEN
- SHOW ME WHAT'S INSIDE
IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT
OF WHAT WAS ME?
