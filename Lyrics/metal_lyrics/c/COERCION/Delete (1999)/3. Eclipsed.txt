[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

OVERLOADED WITH EMOTIONS
OF THE DARKEST KIND
IN MY SEE-THROUGH-SKIN
BREATHING THE THICK AIR
I MOAN AND SHIVER

THE MISANTHROPE SUPREME
INFESTS MY MIND AND SOUL

LIKE A CANCER
IT EATS ME FROM INSIDE
I WEAKEN - IT PROSPERS

MY SUFFERING
- ITS ONLY MISSION

WITH A TREMBLING VOICE
IT SPEAKS THROUGH ME
WITH WORDS SO FRIGHTENING

SELF DESTRUCTIVE IMPULSES
POISON MY EVERY THOUGHT

TOO WEAK TO OFFER
ANY RESISTANCE
I WILL DIE
AS I HAVE LIVED...ECLIPSED

LIFE IS MY PRISON
TO ESCAPE MEANS SUICIDE
