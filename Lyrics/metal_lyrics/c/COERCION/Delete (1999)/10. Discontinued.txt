[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

YOUR WORDS PIERCE MY HEART
I AM TRULY DOOMED

ENOUGH SAID
YOUR POINT HAS BEEN MADE
I CAN FEEL MY WORLD CAVING IN

LEAVE ME NOW
FIND YOUR PLACE
TONIGHT BELONGS
TO MY THOUGHTS

EXPERIENCING
THE LOGIC OF GRAVITY
DROPPED - I FALL

WHAT NOW?
WHY THIS?
ENTER, BITTERNESS

YOU BROKE
WHAT WAS LEFT
OF ME TO BREAK

IN THE WRECKS OF MY LIFE
SOLITUDE EMBRACES ME
WITH ITS DEATHLIKE SILENCE

IN YOUR HEART - SOMEONE ELSE?
WAS I NEVER "THE ONE"...?
