[Music: Rickard Thulin]
[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

DRAINED EMPTY
ALL FEELINGS ARE GONE
I'M DEPRIVED
OF ALL I TRIED TO KEEP

STRIPPED TO THE CORE
AND BENT OUT OF SHAPE
I'M TOSSED AROUND
IN A SPINNING WORLD

INDIFFERENT, I TAKE THE BLOWS
WHILE TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK
TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK...

INSIDE MY GAPPING WOUND
THEIR COLD FINGERS GRASP
FOR WHAT'S NOT THERE...ANYMORE

NOTHINGNESS ECHOES
IN THE VOID OF MY SOUL
LIFE OR DEATH...ONCE I CARED

INDIFFERENT, I TAKE THE BLOWS
WHILE TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK
