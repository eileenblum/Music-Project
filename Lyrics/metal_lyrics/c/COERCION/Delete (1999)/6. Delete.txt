[Lyrics: Kenneth Nyman]

THAT WOULD BE ALL
THE FIASCO'S COMPLETE
ALL THAT COULD GO WRONG
HAS NOW GONE WRONG

FINDING MYSELF IN A WORLD
IN WHICH I, A WALKING DEFECT
COULD NEVER BELONG

WITH ALL OF MY STRENGTH
I TRIED TO ADAPT
BUT MY EVERY ACTION AND WORD
WERE MISUNDERSTOOD

MY ATTEMPT TO LEAD A LIFE
- A TRAGICOMIC FARCE

I'M FAILURE EMBODIED
A LIVING ARGUMENT
AGAINST REPRODUCTION

UNDO ALL I'VE DONE
I TAKE EVERYTHING BACK

DELETE ME
RESET AND FORGET
