ACCESS DENIED...
LIFE TURNED ME DOWN AGAIN
SO, FUCK IT ALL!
TO GO ON...LIKE THIS?
I THINK NOT!

I'VE PASSED THE POINT
OF NO RETURN
...FOR THE LAST TIME

ONE MORE SHOT?
MAYBE NEXT TIME?
GO BACK?
STAND LAST IN LINE?
NEVER AGAIN!

I'M WAY PAST THROUGH
I GAVE IT ALL I HAD...BUT NO!

LIFE DENIED
I AM, BUT LIVE NOT
SO, FUCK IT ALL!
I RESIGN

DO YOU READ ME?
BETWEEN THE LINES!
