Swallow me, leaden sky,
Wrap me into your grey sunlight
I have never been as impenetrable as you
I have never sung for dead angels

I admire the haunted horizon
I join a chaotic torrent
I am a provenance,
I see the pores of the earth's skin

And I saw the insects gnaw sleeping ones
Recognizing strangeful structures,
Creating naked writhing sculptures
Under fundamental layers...

I saw the inner worlds fall
Like grains into the abyss,
Their melting auras still shimmer
Somewhere behind all borders

Coming down into my narcosis
I find an accomplishment
Here are no doors,
In indifferent walls
Cursed in temptation
Obscured and mesmerized
Lifeless without motion
Almost gone...
