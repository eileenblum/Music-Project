I stare into my face
We are connected by solitude
Together tied in chains of despair
Not a gleam of .. Hope ...

Mentally enslaved nameless
Having no future and no past
I look at myself from the surface of a black lake

[x2]
Mirrors call
Mirrors melt
Mirrors take me out of here

What the silver moon sings about
in eternal collapse at night
what i am looking for in the empty skies
(empty like me)
A Swallow of freedom sticks in my throat
When the sun goes down
In the mirrors of despair
There is only my face
