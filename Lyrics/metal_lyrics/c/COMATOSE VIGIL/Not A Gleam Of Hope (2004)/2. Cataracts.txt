Behind a mask with no eyes
There is the monolith of a face
I can not escape from
Your abhorrent embrace
Are you my verdict
Or are you my curse
Deep within myself
I feel the hatred grows

[x2]
Cataracts
The fear of madness
Devouring from inside
Eclipsing the light.....

So many years of pain
My punishment is not over yet
They will never forgive
They will never forget
So fill my veins with poison
Fill my heart with fear
Fill my throat with scream
Fill my blind eyes with tears
