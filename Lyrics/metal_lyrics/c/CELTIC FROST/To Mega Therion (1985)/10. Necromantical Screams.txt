Necromantical screams.
Only you are deaf.
Is there life beyond death?

You've entreated death. The answer will come.
Debris of faith. Even you are false.
Immortal morals. Caught up in time.
Vault of darkness. Filled with hate.

[Chorus]
Deny life. Addiction to death.
Procession of damnation. Expulsion of light.
Hazardous ways. Into the rush.
Soul is frozen and flesh is weak.

Necromantical screams.
Only you are deaf.
Intelligence is mute.

Respect and thoughts. Buried long ago.
Pleading for the end. Blind and dumb.
We won't feel. There could be more.
I will remain alone in the dark

... only you are deaf
