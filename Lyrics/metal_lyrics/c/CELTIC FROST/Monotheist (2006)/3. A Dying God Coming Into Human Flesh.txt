All is cold and frozen.
Frozen the sea, frozen the sky.
Frozen is death, but I cannot die.
Cannot die.
As the snow falls.
To cover this all.
And all is cold.
And cold is all.
All is cold and cold is all.
Cold.
Frozen.
Frozen is heaven and frozen is hell.
And I am dying in this living human shell.
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh.
I am a dying God.
Frozen my heart.
Frozen my soul.
Frozen my love.
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh.
