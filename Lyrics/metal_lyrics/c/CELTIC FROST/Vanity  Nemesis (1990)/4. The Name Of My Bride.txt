Burning in a hell made of my own
Looking for the you I once knew
Your love is hanging over me
Like a big black cloud of misery
Oh mother I beg of you to set me free
Now, like the tempting snake of old
She has seduced my very soul
She took my rib she stole my heart
And hid it in her bosom's warmth
Oh mother hallowed be thy name
For u give birth to us in pain
Maybe I'm Adam with a paradise lost
Or maybe I'm Abel, maybe I'm not
But as sure as hell I know that I'll be chain
Wasting love and my life again
Oh woman of sorrow, you guide me on
into caverns, where I do not belong
Out of your womb, onto the earth
Oh mother of my life, please give me birth
Oh mother of pain, please let me go
For you must reap what you have sown
Oh mother, my mother yes I know
The name of my bride is sorrow
