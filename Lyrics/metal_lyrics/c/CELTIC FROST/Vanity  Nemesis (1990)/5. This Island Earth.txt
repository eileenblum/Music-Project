[originally by Bryan Ferry]So I send an SOS semaphore myself catch me falling finally through the air and underground
Everywhere this sound screams whisper I canât breathe I feel it in my bones though I know I'm not alone.
Youâre spinning far too far from me so cruel to be so kind now I know Iâll always find this island earth.

A mystery as I stumble through the dark dream lovers dream apart starry eyed a vision rushes in do I wonder or care.
My spirit is bleeding God knows where a never ending stream I tried to love tried to find my soul in shadows running blind.
Restless as the sea.
Via side-walks through the haze wandering as in a maze lost in number time and space.
So near and yet so far castaway as strangers are this island earth and you and me
