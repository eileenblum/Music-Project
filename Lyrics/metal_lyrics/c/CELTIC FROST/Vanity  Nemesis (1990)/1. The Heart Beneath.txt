Heaven carries not
What the soul would reap
Growth of deception
Lined between the weeps
A thousand lusts luring in the heart
A desire in our sleep Nemesis
A million lies striving to be shared
Escaping mindless leapsereos
An afterthought formed
First among fallen idols
Of the pandemonial storm
The heart beneath, the desire to die
Scepters of Scarlet, the eternal lie
Tormented eyes, perceiving relief
The shadow's light won't disappear
The mist reveals the shades of grief
The heart beneath, inside my fear
