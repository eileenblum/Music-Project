Traces of dew, eyes in disbelief
Did we persist in misery and grief
Tasting a glance of the bold
A thousand days of fates untold
And from the restless seas I'm born
Through pain and in the restless seas I drown
Love in vain
Cold embrace
Regresses from mankind's trace
Ruling the light, we gave our lonely hearts
Addicted fiends, through weakened weeps and woes
The sight of fear, trading in for faith
Eternal thirst to lead the circling hate
Traces of dew, eyes in disbelief
Shattered at base, the lies that we breathe
