[correlated with the cover by Celtic Frost from the album Into the Pandemonium]

I feel a hot wind on my shoulder
And the touch of a world that's older
Turn the switch and check the number
Leave it on, in bed I slumber

Hear the rhythm of the music
Buy the product, never use it
Hear the talking of the DJ
Can't understand, what's he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

Dial it in, tune the station
They talk about U.S. inflation
I understand just a little
No comprende - it's a riddle

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

Wish I was in Tijuana -
Eating barbecued iguana
I'd take requests on the telephone
I'm on a wavelength far from home

I feel the hot wind on my shoulder
I dial in, south of the border
Hear the talking of the DJ -
Can't understand, what's he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

Radio
Radio
Radio
What does he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio ...
