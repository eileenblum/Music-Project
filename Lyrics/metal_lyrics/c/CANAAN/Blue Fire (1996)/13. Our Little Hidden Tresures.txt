"I will make a hole in your head to chain you with the rope of love". 

"Is this really all you have to offer ? A simple promise of suffering ?" 

"Desire is the father of strength
wrath is the mother of innocence
power is the ultimate gift".

"Fear will be the end of your mirage".

"I have sealed the bound in fire; how could you escape this maternal care ?" 

"I'm escaping your web like the sand flowing from your hands". 

"I will bring you down with me ! my body - your prison...." 

"Never - for I am the chosen one
The sculptor of all your defeats".
