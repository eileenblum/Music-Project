"To blindly believe Shall be the whole of your law"
"Love under the siege of faith" 

Bowed before idols of dust:
breathe the air of submission ! 

For when Eternity expires
you'll stand before them Naked in your Sins.
Is this the reward for a life of adoration ?
The idols of lies need silent adorers.
Is this the price of your Countless humiliations ?
The idols of flesh need weak adorers. 

Human garbage
human ashes
human pain
By gods of powder dismissed ! 

To obey is to suffer 
to love is to conquer
to kill is to adore then..... 

As wolves among sheeps we are hunting.
