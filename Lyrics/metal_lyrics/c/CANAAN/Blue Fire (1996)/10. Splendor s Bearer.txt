Pulsing with Splendor, 
with Arthat at my side 
and Amytaba at my back
and Akshobhya in my heart
I need no wings to fly high
above the misty skies. 

With nothing but my bare hands
I shape the dreams of thousands. 

With Yataka at my side
and Sakys on my back
and Altan Kahna in my eyes
I crawl and yet disdain the perils. 

With nothing but my bare hands, pulsing with Splendor......
I pulverize the columns of Sakyamune.
