All I was then
was a pouring rain
All I am now
is a dirty stain
the light traces
of your last steps
have blinded my
poor soaring eyes

All I was then
was a raging fire
All I am now
is a smoking pyre
the far traces
of your last steps
have guided my
straight winding path

If I cried now
would you come by
and take me back to
my own true life
But I need your pain
to see me through
If I cried now
would you let me go

All I was then
was a vivid light
All I am now
is a hopeless fight
the deep traces
of your last steps
have imprisoned my
frantic troubled mind

If I cried now
would you come by
and take me back to
my own true life
But I need your pain
to see me through
If I cried now
would you let me go
