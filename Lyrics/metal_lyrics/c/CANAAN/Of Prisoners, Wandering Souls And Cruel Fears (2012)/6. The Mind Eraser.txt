If you could erase my mind
If you could clean my soul
I don't know whether I'd be
a different person

And if you could delete my pain
if you could embrace my fears
crushing what's growing
the seeds of tainted sorrows

If you'd arouse all my desires
If you'd harass my certainties
I don't know whether I'd be
a better person

Would I start relentless wars
or would I get to know some peace
and set aside all my regrets
of a long gone life

Then I wonder what I'd do
with my soul without its scars
I'd watch the world
with brand new eyes
in isolation
