Yesterday I had to see the lights
Yesterday I had to meet the night
My dark room's far better than this
My dark place's far wider than this

I was about to cross the line
I was about to step the line

I can't wonder why
I'd take the fight
If I had the chance
to start a life

I can't see why
I'd walk this path
If I had to leave
it all behind

My horizon's greater
than this

My horizon's deeper
than this

In the past I saw
a distant fire
In the past I gazed
my useless trial
I was blinded by
my sacrifice
with my empty words
to pass me by
They were asking why
why would I try
I was questioned by
the hardest lie

Now I had to leave
it all behind
