If the solar eye of the firmament
could pass on the cold in my heart
if I could ever push the ship of wrath
through the seas of my caressing soul
all my despairs would become mud
then turn into a silent prayer
so now take a look at these changing eyes
blessed by the absence of pain

and take a glance into
this fragile soul
imprisoned in a
bottomless pit

If the solar eye of the firmament
could open wide the seals of endless pain
if a hollow mind trapped in this maze
could unleash the beasts living in my soul
all my despairs would become real
and grab my neck with their nails
so now take a look at these changing eyes
blessed by the absence of pain

and take a glance into
this fragile soul
imprisoned in a
bottomless pit
