We could meet
but it ain't easy
to fool me
when I'm grounded
by this fear

We could speak
but it ain't easy
to understand me
when I'm moved
by this anger

we could share
but it ain't easy
the seeds in my hands
as memories from the past

sometimes I breathe at night
and I dream of the dying lights
dancing like stones in the sky
branding monochrome scars with their fire
abiding the silent wake
in a grief I will never forget
fallen stars giving birth in my heart
to a new life

We could join
but it ain't easy
to reach me
when I'm buried
in the ground

We could melt
but it ain't easy
to touch me curled up in my shell

I thought this was my way
I put a smile on my face

so that you believed I was
just a spectral friend of yours

then shame cut off our souls
like the blades of a thousand words
cutting loose the red threads once again
like broken pages out of our love

sometimes I breathe at night
and I dream of the dying lights
dancing like stones in the sky
branding monochrome scars with their fire
abiding the silent wake
in a grief I will never forget
fallen stars giving birth in my heart
to a new life
