Here we are again
with the same old fears
are you still the one
who made my world collapse ?

A veil on these thoughts of mine
and back again in time
here we come again

A shroud on this life of mine
and straight ahead in time
with all our pain

In those days I was
ashamed to say my name
and I knew I was
hiding from the world

in those days I was
afraid to say a word
and I knew I was
cheating on myself

because if you tie me
because if you keep me
you shall be again
the one to rule my world

here I stand again
with these wounds of mine
are you still the one
who overthrowed my world ?
