The night is a painless lawn
infused with chants and stars
and calm whispers of joy.

The night is a distant sound
that shakes the peaceful sleep
of tides.

The night is a precious friend
that keeps our deathwish away.

The night is unbearable delight
when you're here to plant
the seeds of eternal youth
with your bare hands.

I'm life itself begging for more
I'm life itself finding a way
I'm life itself speaking again
I'm life itself leaving this pain behind

For your love is the wonder of a child
For your love is the pure passion of mind
For your love is the only shelter of time
For your love is a treasure of the same kind

The night is a painful place
cursed with screams and bones
and spells of a spiritual desert.

The night is a silent plague
that bleeds forever in my torn
apart body.

The night is a putrid clot
that grows a tumor in my
exhausted flesh.

The night is unbearable suffering
when you're here to destroy the
tiny things I care for.

I'm flesh itself begging for its defeat
I'm flesh itself finding its relief
I'm flesh itself leaving its hollow ground

For your love is the tough winter of fear
For your love is the hard feeling of grudge
For your love is the only shelter of doubt
