When did you stop looking ?
When did you stop screaming ?
When did you stop fighting ?
When did you stop living ?
When did you stop laughing ?
When did you stop breathing ?

The last wish of a man sentenced to die
The vast huge distances within the crowd
The disappearance of the last fireflies
The neverending shadows of the night

You let them inspire you
Seeked them and pulled them to pieces

By whom have your clean eyes been compromised ?
You used to draw on sheets others declined

Now you carry on with no frills
on your view

Now you carry on in silence
and no time's left

Your passion was your weapon
And brought you there

Speaking with thousand voices
Keep shouting 'til heard
