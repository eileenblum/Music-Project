The words I lost in you
The ones I never found
The empty words I lost in you
are all I'm left with now
The void I found in you
The light I found in you
is all I left behind

They say there is a place
for everything
They say there is a time
for everything
They say there is a need
for everything

Please tell me where's mine
Because all I can find here
are the traces
of the many words I lost in you
of the ones I never found
of the ones I'll never find
of the many words I lost in you

They say there is a place
for everything
They say there is a time
for everything

Tell me where's mine
Because all I can hear now
is the loud silence
of all the words that once
had a sound
of the only words that
once had a meaning.....
