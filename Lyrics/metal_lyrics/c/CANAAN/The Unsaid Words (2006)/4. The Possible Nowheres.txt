I've dreamt the light
at the end of this sleepless night
just another one like many others

I've heard the sound
At the heart of every void
but this is my void, like no other

I've found the place
at the end of every journey
the one among the possible
nowheres

All that begins
has an end somewhere
All that ends had a beginning
somewhere
All that begins, ends...

I'll dream about a light
far in the distance
guiding the slow steps
of my shy soul

I'll dream about my end
it's just down there, I know
past the lights that blind me now

All that has a beginning
must have an end, I know
An easy end, somewhere
All that has an end
Had a beginning somewhere
The painful rule of every life....
