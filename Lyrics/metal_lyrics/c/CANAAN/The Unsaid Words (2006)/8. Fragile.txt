Fragile
Immobile
For endless
lapses of time

Fragile
Immobile
in an ice cold night
Nothing I perceive
While I hold my breath
and see this life of mine
destroyed
and burnt to ashes.

Fragile
Immobile
With a thousand winds
around me, whispering
words of comfort while
they blow away the sands
of my poor
throbbing heart.

Fragile
Immobile
For neverending
lapses of time
I dare not move
swallow my breath
and my desires
for fear that a sound
could break the spell

Of these frail moments
Of a life I no longer understand
Of this pure perception of me
