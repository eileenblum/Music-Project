Running in circle
entwined in sheets
written with fury
then left
in a corner

Never again

Playing with joy
like a child
left in an
empty room with
a lot of toys

Never again

Bathing in the river
of promises
feeling the hopes of
a whole life
passing away

Never again

Feeling darkness
like a veil suspended
over the dirty windows
of anxiety

Never again
Loosing path like a bird
in a storm
Like a Raindrop falling
from a quiet sky
Like a single ray of light

Never
Again
