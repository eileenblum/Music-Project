Punish my black heart for I have sinned.
Nail my black heart for I have sinned
Leave me alone in
This evening of despair
When nothing has the same meaning again
And this core of self-deception
Fills the pits of solitude. 

Punish my black heart
For I'll sin again
With the same, old illusions
As my monodimensional guiding light. 

And when everything will regain perspective,
I will finally find a meaning
to this deep grey solitude of mine. 

Punish my black heart
Nail my black heart
Melt me.
