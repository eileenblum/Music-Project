Broken
in a chrome overdose
Shaking hands in
ever growing ache

Destroyed
a writing on the wall
lights are trembling
shields are crumbling

Abandoned
in a plastic overdose
coloured in grey
perfumes all around

Passing away
in this chrome red overdose
sensorial overload
Absurd pulses of pain
carving holes in the head

Silver, silver overdose
buried, buried deep beneath
this last forgotten, forbidden
venom dose
