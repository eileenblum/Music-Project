Drink this mercury
from my open hands
for I'm the breathing shadow
that keeps us alive

This grey sky turned to black
so many times honey.....

So stay with me tonight
hold my hands tonight
For I'm the smiling ghost
that binds our hearts together

Don't leave me tonight
For I have mercury that burns
Hold these hands of mine
Kiss these lips of mine
For I'm the mirror
that never lies

Stay with me tonight
Die with me tonight
The sky will turn to black
for the very last time tonight
honey....
