Everything you say is a lie
Everything you do is a lie
But the biggest lie of all
is the love you feel for me

All the lies you say
Shine like diamonds in the sand
All the lies we say
are the bricks of the walls
surrounding us

Everything you do is deception
Everything you say is deception
But the biggest deception of all
is your love in disguise

Everything we feel is a lie
Everything we feel is a lie

Everything you do is betrayal
Everything you say smells of betrayal
But the biggest betrayal of all
Is the love I feel for you
