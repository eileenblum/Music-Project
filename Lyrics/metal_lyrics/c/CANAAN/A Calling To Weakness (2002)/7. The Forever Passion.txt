We have fallen again
Preys of this consuming turmoil
Victims of our own desires
Time loads the remains
Of our pulverized egos

We are
We are the children
We are the children of nothing

Join us to the wrong side
of this atrocious illusion
Where the passing of time
mutates the colours
of a much too silent horizon

We are
We are the children
We are the children of nothing

We have fallen again
slaves to a biological rhythm
that's far from being ours

Dance with us
Live with us a life of regret
as cold as a winter day

We are
We are the children
We are the children of nothing

We are echos in an empty room
The forever passion of decay
