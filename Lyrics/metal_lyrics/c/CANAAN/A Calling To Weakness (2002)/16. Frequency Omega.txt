Silence all around me
is like a key to neutralize
the deadly frequencies inside
There is only silence around me
and it makes me feel like
I am still far from home

Silence all around me
Unrequested codes to break
Rejected paths to overcome
the frequency Omega

This world is not my home
I call, I long for help

Drifting in motionless air
drowning in this ocean of bliss
Silence greets me like
the last faithful friend of mine

There's only silence around here
I am home now
A million miles away
from sanity
