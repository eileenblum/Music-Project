Thrice his arms were trespassed by nacreous nails
Thrice his voice quenched the fires of consciousness
Thrice his arms were nailed to the nightwall
Thrice his voice branded her with the name of Whore. 

And again he rose his eyes with scorn
to violate the sacred woes. 

What once majestic now fades in nightwells. 

Thrice Angel
Twice Angel
Once Angel
Nail Angel.
