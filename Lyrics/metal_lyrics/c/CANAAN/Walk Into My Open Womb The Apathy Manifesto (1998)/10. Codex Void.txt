Show me the end of the journey
Teach me how to wipe this soiling blood
off my eyes hands and lips. 

I now seek my revenge
Over a dramatic pathway.
Codex: untouched. Void: unattained. 

The paths of desire led us
to this Grey slavery
Where golden walls
replace Calm and guardian angels. 

Teach me how to tear this prison down
The Codex spiral !
A strange wheel of fire
still spinning and running and entrapping.
Codex: violated Void: replenished. 

Just another grey day
in this Ebony paradise
Absorbing the venom of your spiritual hells.
Release me from this nightmare:
Lend me your sharpest blade.
Codex: blade Agony: deleted.
