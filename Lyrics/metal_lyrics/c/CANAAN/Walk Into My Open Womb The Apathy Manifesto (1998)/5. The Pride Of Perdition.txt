An even ray closes me
In this circle of darkness
I can't escape. 

Sometimes a child sings his lullaby,
smiling of dead angels.
Watch ! The empty paradise
awaits The God of soul and stone - severance ! 

Oh lovely destroyer,
I bestow you my corrupt plagues.
Your blood is mine, Lord: we die.
My blood is yours, Lord: Let's die.
