In my mind I know how to sing this
But I need your light, God there's no other way
He says I try, the words all come jumbling out
As I rest in your light, I hear your spirit say, you say
"Come"
I don't know why it was that I hated you so
It was before I really knew you
Before I touched your heart and it became unto me, the very substance of my life
I've stayed at your side, I've seen the things that you do
I'm blessed, I'm broken, I'm honored inside to be called your wife
"Come"
Then my heart cries out
You Will Reign Forevermore... I love You Lord
You are worthy Lord, so worthy Lord You're so deserving Lord, take my life Oh God
We Will Reign Forevermore!
Then You sing out over us Oh Lord You respond and I thank You Lord
You sing
You lift up my head and sing
You call me beloved Lord, so we sing
You are worthy, You alone, we sing out
We exalt You Lord
We Will Reign Forevermore!
