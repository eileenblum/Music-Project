I will bleed for the one who gave everything for me
Watch and wait
Read up!
You're going to die for that man whose blood is on my hands
So fess up his name
And be bled dry
You can see the new generation of gang signs
Beware of simple flattery
They'll hand you over in chains
Those who serve and protect just protecting their own best interest
As they serve you up to the flames
But I've got one eye to the Sky
I see just one man in the distance
So step up and feel my resistance
Even if we all die
Time is on my side
I laugh inside as they fight him
Prepare to run I can't spell it out plainly
Aww, you're befriending the system
And you're gonna get paid
And love grows cold as the sick ones hate you
Never realizing they're the ones getting played
read the signs of the end of this age
As man makes plans
The flood comes quickly
Our history's bathed in blood but lets become the copycat culture war
As this Sunday school mind takes the place of the kingdom
And I'm done with this abomination
Desolation
Vultures, vultures circling
And the world will morn as we flee
I see its over
Time is on my side
