I'm rigged to Fire, and I'm set to blow
I cannot live in this state, break down the doors smash every window, to help the orphans escape
What would Jesus do?
I think illuminate
You know what's "unbiblical?"
That's Jesus sitting sitting in some blackened room
These people live so violated and we're concerned with church agendas Oh My God
Pure religion says I fight this war
The hidden millions in our own back yard, exploited masses These kids are all alone, waiting for someone
I tell you what's "biblical" the master came to set the captive free, and we should be like him, we will worship and pray, then instigate their release!
I can't see Jesus in this Pollutes my trust, it fills my heart with hate
I hear their muffled screams, these children terrified
God what is right, I cant stand by and...
I refuse to stand by in this house of fear, its innocent kids who pay the real price, in the House of Fear
Take back every throw away life from the House of Fear
Cant live for myself as innocence dies, in the House of Fear!
Holy God Where are you in the dark and hidden place?
How can I sleep when children live as slaves, these are your people Oh God
Ill pray and Ill move, Father say the Word!
Cause this is unspeakable, slithering darkness but Ill bring the light
And by the morning they'll all be gone, given the chance to lead a different life
Descending into Hell
Cause these Kids are for sale, we walk into Hell
For those locked in a cell, we walk into Hell
Some can't speak for themselves, we walk into Hell
Even Jesus himself walked into Hell
