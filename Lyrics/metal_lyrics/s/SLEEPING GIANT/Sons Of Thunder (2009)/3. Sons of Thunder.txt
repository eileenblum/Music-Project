[Speaking:]
You've heard it been said "Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth."
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
If someone strikes you on the right cheek tell them to hit the other also.
And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let them have your cloak as well.
If someone forces you to go one mile, go with them too.
Give to the one who asks and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
You've heard that it was said "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in Heaven.

This conflict burns in my veins, I feel injustice surround, stopping my movement in Hope
The stinging words of the crowd, they speak of me like I've lost my mind, like I am some kind of joke
I see the enemies rage, I hear the sickening voice taunt, I feel his wicked eyes shine
Simply no longer afraid I throw my head back and laugh, and take a drink of new wine
The fight is over your souls
Sons of Thunder
Calling the fire down
Burning with hope
Sons of Thunder
My only weapon is truth, hatred's more powerful or so it would seem, sapping my belief in all the things you have shown in the secret
My friends and family just scream, angry at you and they cry out to me
They speak sincere unbelief and inside them they mean it
Sons of Thunder
Calling the Fire Down
Bringing Me Home
Sons of Thunder Overcome this world with love
Is there no one who understands, has everyone turned aside, is anyone listening , someone hear me
Does anyone understand, has everyone turned their own way Father help me, return!
In that moment I have felt my life slip from my hands
Becoming heaven's weapon In that instant felt your spirit enter mortal man
See you at Armageddon
Bringing me home
