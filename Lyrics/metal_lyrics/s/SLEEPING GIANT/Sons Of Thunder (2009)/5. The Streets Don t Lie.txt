Taking me to the streets
I'm losing everything, society deemed important to me
Where do I turn?
Kicking me in the teeth
Why's my wife and daughter sleeping in some strange building their whole life taped in boxes
How can my marriage survive?
How will my wife respect me at night if she don't think ill provide
What goes through my child's mind, her fragile heart, this tears me apart
Oh Jesus am I alone in this fight?
Only vagabonds can know
Only the homeless ones can comprehend what it means to lose everything you know, just to come home again
Only the pilgrims go from strength to strength, and the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
So now he helps me find my way in this world, I'm home again
And he sings over me
His voice washes my wounds clean
He says my sons and daughters, exempt from fear this is Jubilee
You are one, you are my child
Child of mine who is unseen, Oh nation, listen to Me
Don't you worry about a thing
Night will fall, though the darkness is real, sun will rise, though the enemy lies
The awakening, your home is nearer than it seems, Come waste away with me
How many sunny days have I passed men and women taken to poverty within this nation
In passing I mumble a prayer,
Oh God just get them out of this jungle, let me show them salvation
My Christian vanity, all my possessions links and chains to this all powerful nothing
We're choking on American Dreams, and this whole nation falling down at the feet of the meek
Maybe the homeless ones are free
Maybe those vagabonds can comprehend, what it means to have absolutely nothing, while coming home again
And as those pilgrims go from strength to strength
Like the son of man, nowhere to lay his head
And I've experienced losing everything I thought was home, on my way home again
And he sings over me
His voice washes my wounds clean
He says my sons and daughters, exempt from fear this is Jubilee
You are one, you are my children, child of mine, you can see me, who is unseen, I know you all, I know and I see
Night will fall, though the darkness is real, but the sun will rise, I'll lift your head up, the true awakening,
I'll never leave, come waste away with me Give up everything
I hold truth and resurrection life
Kid stay vigilant
You watch and wait for my imminent return
And every generation sings
Every generation that lifts up its head, it lifts up its hands
As the people sing... We are those
And we declare to every broken heart
Children of One
Let every wounded soul
Who is unseen
All who've been cast away
Worlds will Fall
Every last one that's been turned away
We may die, in the awakening
We declare over your heart this is your destiny
Come Waste Away!
Maranatha!
Jesus Come! Kingdom Come!
Your Will!
