We are armed insurrection 
We've only begun. 
We are genesis to revelation. 
We the rising tide.

Reformation 
Revival 
Come and See. 
You can kill one man but 
I guess you don't see 
the million other men who stand 
waiting behind me. 

"I solemnly swear to tell the whole truth."

Testify To the resurrection 
Defend The Cross. 
We are the ground swell. 
We are the mob rule. 
We the rising ride. 

Reformation 
Revival 
Come Join with Me. 

You can kill one man but 
I guess you don't see 
the million other men who stand. 
Waiting behind me. 

If they shut me up who'll take my place? 
Who's gonna testify. 
If they end my life will you finish the race. 
Why're you gonna live and die. 
Who'll speak. 
Testify to the Easter Rising. 
I will Testify. 
The Easter Rising. 
I will give my life. 
The Easter Rising.
