[feat. Drew Di Jorio of Stray From The Path (Vox)]If my name was Hosea I would last the night.
If there was some other way I would take it.
If I could just make my beloved believe again,
if Divorce had a face I would break it.

I see her smile but her eyes seem so distant now.
I sleep beside her but we never embrace I'm wondering.
When did your heart grow so cold.
Where did my family go?
Oh God my Family No.
How's it so simple to create a new version of life.
Forgetting me and all the dreams in the past You're walking.
How can I watch my wife go.
Go chase your lovers lover I know they won't last just don't leave.

I hear him calling.
These demons sift like wheat.
After you've fallen.
Return and Strengthen Me.

Now the flame is within I can last the night.
I've seen my life in the way and I'll take it.
If I could just make my beloved believe again.
I wish divorce had a face.
I could break.
I watched you watch him with that look of concealment within.
Oh how I've longed for your simple desire.
I see you slipping away.
I saw the whole thing coming.
Oh cheating heart Iâm wondering.
Oh, cheating heart you wander.
I'll be responsible for all of my failures and faults.
I thought with us there'd never be a last time.
I know I'm finished.
But I've already been were you're running.
Iâll look to the sky for help before I die on the inside.

This pain inside
this separation breathes.
You're at the edge.
And I'm forgotten.
If my name was Hosea I would last the night.
If there was some other way I would take it.
If I could just make my beloved believe again.
If divorce had a face I would break it.

BREAK!!

That was a moment
that only I could feel
and in that moment
only God was real.
