[feat. Bruce LePage ex-100 Demons (Vox)]I know you can hear it,
the sound of church bells ringing.
To signal the new days dawning.
The kingdom of Heaven is singing out.

Wild Pentecostal!
Wild Pentecostal!

Summoning to Nations
come and see where we stay.
A summons to the lost and abandoned.
In the midst of decay.
Take Hope.
The fire is burning
come warm yourselves on the flames.
I know your destiny
Children of God.
My father knows all your names.
DeathKnell.

Wild Pentecostal!
Wild Pentecostal!
Get wild!
Wild Pentecostal!

Summoning to Nations
come and see where we stay.
A summons to the lost and abandoned.
In the midst of decay.
Take Hope.
The fire is burning

I Summon The Nations of the World.
I Summon The Nations of the World.
