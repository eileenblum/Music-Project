God don't let people fall 
into the hands of an angry church 
without love 
I never would have made it. 
Father don't let your people fall 
into the clutches of an angry world. 
Without your love 
we're never gonna make it.

into the hands of an angry church 
without love 
I never would have made it. 
Father don't let your people fall 
into the clutches of an angry world. 
Without your love 
we're never gonna make it. 

All of our politics and pride, 
breed division and disorder, 
anything but love. 
Don't let a Christian Love 
or it's over. 
The only freedom I've found, 
Is Radical Love. 
Radical Love!
