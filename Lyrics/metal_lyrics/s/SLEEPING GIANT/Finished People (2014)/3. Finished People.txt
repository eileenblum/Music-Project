First they let time away blur all the lines in your face.
Then all the letters stop coming.

I see saints in the cellblocks.
I see revival in chains.
I see saints in the cellblocks.
Remember me.

The World Calls us Finished Ones
We are Finished People.

25:40 in a 6 by 8.
I got the vision.
But these bars keep blocking the Sun from me.
I think I'm finished.

Don't let the time away blur all the lies in my face.
Don't let the letters stop coming.

God sees saints in the cellblocks.
We see revival in chains.
God sees saints in the cellblocks.
Remember Me.
Remember Me.

The world calls us The Finished Ones.
We are Finished People.
The world calls us The Finished Ones.
We are Finished People.

God forgive me for bringing tears to my Home.
Forgive me for making my mother cry.
I hope you won't forget me.
Or I am finished.
I hope you don't forget me.
Finished.
