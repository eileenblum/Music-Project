[feat. Joel Muniz of Dinasty (Vox)]There is a sickness
we are the cure.
Many will pass away
we will endure
Committed to violence
our victory sure
the whole earth can pass away
but we must endure

Sweet blood meridian
come flow and purify.
I've met the judge some say like him we never age.
Some say like him we never die.
Like him we never die.

There is a sickness
I am the cure
humanity will pass away
we will endure.
Persistence in suffering
victory sure
the whole earth can pass away
I will endure.

Endurance.
I will endure.

Sweet Blood Meridian.
Sweet Blood Meridian.
