Where death once ruled. 
Now You reign. 
Where sin once ruled. 
Now You reign. 
Where death once ruled.
Now We Reign. 
Where sin once ruled. 
Now We reign.

The Kingdom Is At Hand. 
The Kingdom Is Within Me. 
The Kingdom Is At Hand. 
The Kingdom. 

Where death once ruled. 
Now You reign. 
Where sin once ruled. 
Now You reign. 
Where death once ruled.
Now We Reign. 
Where sin once ruled. 
Now We reign.

I Am The Kingdom.
I Am The Kingdom.
