[feat. Levi the poet]The kingdom suffers. The kingdom suffers. But I must still remain. When the kingdom's suffering Violence. The Kingdom suffers. I must still remain.
I've only run halfway. Feels like less than half my strength remains. But there's just one place I'll make my grave. It's in you. And When the Kingdom Suffers. I Must still remain. When the Kingdoms suffering Violence.
