I am holy vengeance and all we are is worship to the throne. 
We are the lightning that flashes from the throne. 
And the Fatherâs Glory, it crashes from the throne. 
And the gates of Hell can not stand against the throne. 
We silence injustice with truth, 
and we laugh with the man on the throne. 
These are kingdom days in an evil age, 
so we wreck fake culture built on deception and lies. 
This is indigenous style warfare. 
This is throne room militance, 
we wonât accept any compromise. 
Thereâs just one hope (Kingdom!)
Thereâs only one hope (Kingdom!)
Itâs the man Christ crucified, so we live and die for the secret life, and to the enemy of our souls: weâve come here to destroy

We are the lightning that flashes from the throne. 
And the Fatherâs Glory, it crashes from the throne. 
And the gates of Hell can not stand against the throne. 
We silence injustice with truth, 
and we laugh with the man on the throne.
