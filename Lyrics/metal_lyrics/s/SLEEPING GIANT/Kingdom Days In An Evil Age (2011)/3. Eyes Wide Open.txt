[feat. Frankie Palmeri of Emmure (Vox)]They try to silence my voice,
they try to hold me down.
But Iâm still screaming out
Iâm still screaming out

They try to silence my voice,
they try to hold me down.
But Iâm still screaming out
âYou better prayâ!

They call me fanatic
cause I can stand on my own.
I speak revivalist.
I got this fire shut up in my bones.
They call me fanatic.
And all the church doors they stay closed
because I testify.
They preach sermons but still donât know.

The fanatical forerunner.
I prepare the way.
I speak a message of truth.
Take heed
I mean what I say.

âYou better prayâ!
âYou better prayâ!

So hide yourself in the darkness.
Keep your prayers to yourselves,
because any fool can pray
just to get recognized by someone else.

The secret life of fanatics,
they can stand on their own
because they recognize the church doors stay closed.

They call me fanatic
cause I can stand on my own.
I speak revivalist.
I got this fire shut up in my bones.

We pray with our eyes open to see the victims of injustice.
Iâm not just one man
All heaven stands with me.
Iâve got a message for the world:
Itâs not just us!

They call me fanatic
cause I can stand on my own.
I speak revivalist.
I got this fire shut up in my bones.

They call me fanatic
cause I can stand on my own.
I speak revivalist.
I got this fire shut up in my bones.

âYou better prayâ!
âYou better prayâ!
âYou better prayâ!
âYou better prayâ!
