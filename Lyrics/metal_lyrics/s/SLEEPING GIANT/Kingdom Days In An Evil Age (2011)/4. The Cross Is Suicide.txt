Welcome to the life. 
We represent the trial; 
The dead existence
fallen!!
Donât look in our eyes. 
They wonât be seen again. 
This is a former state
Weâre Non-existence. 
No one else should know. 
Itâs not for them to say, 
because we are called
The chosen few. 
Now you canât escape. 
But you realize you never really wanted to, 
and strength fills your insides. 

This cross is suicide. 
We are suicide. 
This cross is suicide. 
We are suicide.

All should come and die; 
Not for the symbol, 
but for the one who is symbolized. 
Our light is inside. 
All else is darkness till the morning time, 
because the sun will rise. 
This is suicide. 
This bloody cross, 
where does it lead me? 
To my own demise. 
Whereâs your secret life? 
Youâre gonna hide your face to be recognized. 
You better recognize. 

This cross is suicide. 
We are suicide. 
This cross is suicide. 
We are suicide.

And theyâll cry out "Let the mountains hide us, and the hills fall on us". 
Iâll stand tall with the strength inside from the spirit of truth. 
Let the earth swallow me whole. 
Let the earth swallow me whole.
Hide me from the justice of the lamb.
Let the earth swallow me whole.
Hide me from the justice of the lamb.
Let the earth swallow me whole.
Hide me from the justice of the lamb.
Let the earth swallow me whole.
Hide me from the justice of the lamb.
Let the earth swallow me whole.
Hide me from the justice of the lamb.
