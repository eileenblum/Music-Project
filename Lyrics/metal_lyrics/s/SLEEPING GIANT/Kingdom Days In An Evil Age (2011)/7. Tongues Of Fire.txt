I speak to the earth, 
I speak for those who donât have a say. 
The rule of heaven on earth. 
Even the stones, they will cry out. 

I am the light in the darkness. 
Iâll turn your cities to salt. 
With fire Iâll speak the word of the Lord. 
Iâll carry the torch of revival, and it burns. 

I speak to the earth,
I speak the life to your destiny. 
I speak the word as a child of the king that we keep our vision set on the Lord and His virtues. My soul
Praise the Lord. 
All the earth, 
we have been called to be prophets and priests, 
so we speak with tongues of fire
destiny. 

Spirit of truth, 
spirit of light, will you come to me? 
Your holy presence on earth 
to testify of the Father. 

Real recognize real. 
Prophetic declaration. 
Do you see how we feel? 
So we declare that everything changes
Revival fire will fall
we all burn. 

I speak to the earth,
I speak the life to your destiny. 
I speak the word as a child of the king that we keep our vision set on the Lord and His virtues. My soul
Praise the Lord. 
All the earth, 
we have been called to be prophets and priests, 
so we speak with tongues of fire
destiny. 

HALLELUJAH!!

I carry the torch of revival to the earth.
REVIVAL, REVIVAL!
I carry the torch of revival to the earth.
REVIVAL, REVIVAL!
