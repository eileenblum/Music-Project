In the midst of this crushing pain, 
when itâs too dark to see. 
Can your hand reach down to this pit Iâve made? 
Can you save me? 
Can you save me? 
When I realize the life you gave, 
bringing me to the light, 
like the scales have finally dropped from my eyes. 
You restored my sight. 
Now I can find. 

We are chosen, 
we are called. 
We belong to the kingdom. 

Now I canât make a pact with this empty world, 
and I refuse to play nice. 
Your bloods been dripping into my eyes, 
and you paid my price. 
I saw the One seated on the throne, 
crystal clear as the sea. 
And He beckoned "Come up here, my child". 
I could feel him breathe. 
And the angels sing: 

"Holy, holy, holy God." 
"Holy, holy, holy God."
Do you see him? 
Do you know? 
Come up here, 
we will show you 
Do you see him? 
Do you know? 
Come up here, 
we will show you 

your God in heaven 
seated on our praises, 
exalted by the sound 
of our hearts lifted. 
Banner waiving. 
All is love. 
He is love.

Do you see him? 
Do you know? 
Come up here, 
we will show you 
Do you see him? 
Do you know? 
Come up here, 
we will show you 

your God in heaven 
seated on our praises, 
exalted by the sound 
of our hearts lifted. 
Banner waiving. 
All is love. 
He is love.
