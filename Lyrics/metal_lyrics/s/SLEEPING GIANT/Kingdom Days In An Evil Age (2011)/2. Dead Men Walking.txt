NO!

In the face of suffering and pain, 
The Lord, our justice is one. 
As Hell postures itself like it still reigns, 
the peace of heaven will come. 
I am a child of God. 
I see all these things â Iâm broken. 
The Lord, our justice is one. 
I bow my head to the king in submission as his words are spoken. 
The peace of heaven reigns. 
Salvation is our banner. 

I will not surrender to the power of darkness. 
All my fear has vanished in the presence of heaven. 
Can you feel the fire
The fire in my heart? 
I see dead men walking; 
I canât help but prophesy. 

Life
To the dead you will rise again. 
Life. 
To the power of Hell
It canât have you, my kingdom is stronger. 
Fight
You must fight. 
Rise!

I know the weight of all the fear in life. 
I know itâs easier to fade and die. 
But can I tell you what it is you donât see? 
There was a king who came and gave his life 
for all the broken ones like you and I. 
Itâs in his sacrifice I trust and believe. 

Can you feel the fire
The fire in my heart? 
We are dead men walking. 
We were born to prophesy. 
Lord!

In the face of all Hell, 
watch the dead live again. 
All the kingdom are redeemed from the curse with a story to tell. 
Watch the dead live again. 
Bringing salvation to all of the hurting abandoned and used. 
Watch the dead live again. 
All of the nations stare in amazement to watch what we do. 
The peace of heaven reigns. 
Salvation is our banner!

As we dance, 
can you feel the earth shake? 
Glory. 
Can you feel the glory? 
Glory fall. 
Can you feel the glory of God? 
Eeeerrrah Stop!

Our praise, 
we dance before the host of heaven. 
All that I need is your presence, 
so let your glory fall. 
Your holy name can save us, 
so let your glory fall.

Our praise, 
we dance before the host of heaven. 
All that I need is your presence, 
so let your glory fall. 
Your holy name can save us, 
so let your glory fall.
