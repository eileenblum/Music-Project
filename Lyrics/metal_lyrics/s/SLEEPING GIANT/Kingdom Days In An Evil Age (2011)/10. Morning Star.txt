Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
I am blinded by glory. 
His face shines like the sun. 
His words shake the foundations. 
The holy lamb has become the lion. 
Lift up your eyes, all you nations. 
The king is returning. 
Oh!

Christ â The Morningstar, shine bright. 
Heavenâs light falling down on me. 
To those who recognize your eyes, 
you will come, 
sing âMy Belovedâ. 
Take you with me.

Maranatha. 
The spirit and the bride say, âComeâ. 
Maranatha. 
Oh God, let your Son return. 
Maranatha. 
Youâre beautiful.
