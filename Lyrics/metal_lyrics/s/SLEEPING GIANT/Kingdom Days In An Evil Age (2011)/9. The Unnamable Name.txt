For all the martyrs that gave their lives 
for the unnamable name. 
To all the saints that made the sacrifice 
to the unnamable name. 
Witness the lamb 
as the fifth seals broken. 
Behold the ones with scars on their face. 
We are the saints at the foot of the alter, 
the holy martyred race.

Avenge blood of the underground. 
How long oh Lord? 
Avenge the blood of the underground. 
How long? 

Precious 
in the eyes of God 
is the blood of the faithful.

To every saint in the underground
I remember your face.

I remember your face.

To all restricted nations: 
Hear me now, 
receive your King.
