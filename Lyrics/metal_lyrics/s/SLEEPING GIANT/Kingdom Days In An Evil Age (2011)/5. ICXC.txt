Behind all your valor, 
behind all your words and pain 
and behind this christian rhetoric, 
there is a rage that will conquer. 
You are the conqueror. 

Behind the words in red, 
there is a rage. 
Behind the blood you shed, 
there is a rage. 
Behind the things you said, 
there is a rage. 
Jesus, why did you end up dead? 
There is a rage. 

You breathe holy terror, 
stronger than all of our pride. 
Oh, holy terror, drop a bomb on the inside. 
Kingdom violence, so necessary. 
We are the violent; 
You have a rage that will conquer. 

Conqueror. 
Behind the words in red, 
there is a rage. 
Behind the blood you shed, 
there is a rage. 
Behind the things you said, 
there is a rage. 
Jesus, why did you end up dead? 
There is a rage. 

Youâre bleeding a terror, 
a holy terror in me. 
Oh God, I am terrified. 
Is this ecstasy? 
ecstasy!

Behold the worthy lamb, 
and be terrified.
we are the terrorist in this evil age
we are the violence 
we are the rage 
of the conquerors 
WRECK!

Jesus the conquerer 
Jesus the conquerer 
Jesus the conquerer
