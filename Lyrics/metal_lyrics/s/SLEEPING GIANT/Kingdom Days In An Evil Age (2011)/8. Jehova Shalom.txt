You are glory. 
You are pain. 
You are master. 
You are the servants. 
You are fire. 
You are rain. 
You are justice. 
You are returning again. 

Oh, holy one, risen exalted king. 
My God. 
Messiah. 
Jehovah Shalom. 

Holy, Holy, Holy!
Oh, Holy One
Holy One

You are presence. 
You are joy. 
You are my future. 
You are my past. 
You are faithful. 
You are true. 
You are judgement. 
Only your justice remains. 

Oh, holy one, risen exalted king.
My God of breakthrough. 
The Lord, our banner. 

Holy, Holy, Holy!
Oh, Holy One
Holy One

Oh, king Jesus, 
you are my God. 
You are so worthy, holy in vengeance. 
And when that trumpet blasts, 
Iâll bow in awe. 
For one half hour, silence. 

Jesus enthroned. 
Let the world be silenced.

Holy, Holy, Holy!
Holy, Holy, Holy!
Holy One
