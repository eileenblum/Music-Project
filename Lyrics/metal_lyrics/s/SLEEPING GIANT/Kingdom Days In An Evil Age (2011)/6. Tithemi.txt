All fear, all pain, all hurt, all grief, all lies 
must bow to Jesusâ name. 
All kings, all thrones, everything that breathes life, 
must bow to Jesus name. 
The earth, the sea, the sun, the stars, the sky, 
must bow to Jesusâ name. 
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

All fear, all pain, all hurt, all grief, all lies 
must bow to Jesusâ name. 
All kings, all thrones, everything that breathes life, 
must bow to Jesus name. 
The earth, the sea, the sun, the stars, the sky, 
must bow to Jesusâ name. 
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

theres no one like You my God 
theres no one like You my King
no one
there is no one like You 
Hallelujah

"They speak highly about supremacy 
this is declaration 
hear us up - you best prepare
swing open you ancient doors 
receive your King"

Kings, crowns, thrones
Bow down. 
Fall face down
Bow down. 
Kiss the ground
Bow down. 
Jesus, you hold the crown
Bow down.
