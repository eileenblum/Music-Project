[feat. Ryan Clark]How do we compare? Just another orphan generation..
How do we compare? A generation of lost boys!

I hear your songs, I don't dance and I will not stay
I know the truth now and I'll never walk away
This generation doesn't recognize its own name
I'm sorry folks - my tribe and people don't play!
It's a mob and the crowd is louder than I care to bear on my way.

Condemning voices they talk and talk and talk
Condemning judges just never say a thing -
they neglect the Cross of Christ but it's the only power for true change!

I reduce the choir to one voice
I choose the assignment of the cast aside
My place is outside of group-think
I choose to identify as crucified!

Crucified!

Crucified!

How do we compare? Just another orphan generation..
How do we compare? A generation of lost boys!

Give me a name, give me a home - lost boys!
I'm so afraid, I'm so alone - lost boys!
Give me a name, give me a home - lost boys, finding our way home!

I hear your songs, I don't dance and I will not stay
I know the truth now and I'll never walk away
This generation doesn't recognize its own name
I'm sorry folks - my tribe and people don't play!
It's a mob and the crowd is louder than I care to bear on my way.

Condemning voices they talk and talk and talk
Condemning judges just never say a thing -
they neglect the Cross of Christ but it's the only power for true change!

Orphan generation - identify as crucified!

I choose to lay down my life! Crucified!
Identify as crucified!
