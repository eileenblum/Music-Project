I was there to give your name â I was only a kid myself!
And I was lost when you went away â that moment of living hell!
Phone calls to hear your voice â this isn't what you deserve!
But a father's love never dissipates â I swore that you'd come back to me!

Dark night. I'm weary. But I'll stay awake!

No sleep from my eyes!

Didn't I, didn't I say â you'll get no sleep from me!
Didn't I, didn't I tell you â I am a patient man. I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait!
Didn't I, didn't I say â you'll get no sleep from me!

Ten years I have stayed â it's felt like a lifetime!
You are shining destiny â you're part of a dynasty!
I've fought for you and I've prayed â this intercession has cost blood!
I believe in you, you've found your way â just One way

And now you're on a journey with me!

Dark night. I'm weary. I swore I'd stay awake.

Didn't I, didn't I say â you'll get no sleep from me!
Didn't I, didn't I tell you â I am a patient man. I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait!
Didn't I, didn't I say â you'll get no sleep from me!

When you pass through the waters I will be with you
When you walk on the waves you won't be swept away
When you pass through the waters I will be with you
When you look in my eyes you'll see that I'm awake
When you pass through the waters I will be with you

A father is always a watchman!
When you walk on the waves you won't be swept away
My child, protected, I'm looking out!
When you pass through the waters I will be with you

A father, a daughter, a watchman!
When you look in my eyes you'll see that I'm awake
All my watchmen â stay up!
