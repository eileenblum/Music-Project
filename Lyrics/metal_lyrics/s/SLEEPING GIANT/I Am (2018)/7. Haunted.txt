This enduring suffering
The Cross captures the attention of the world
The mystery revealed!

Mystery!
Revealed!
I stand at the foot of the Cross!

All my questions swirl!
I have so many whys!
I can see Your face
In this cloud of unknowing!

His life is in my hands!
But I can't see the sky!
This whole place is ghosts -
Or is it my own mind?

My heart, my world - so diseased!
Will I ever find a sense of peace?
The realization - I am haunted!

This enduring suffering
The Cross captures the attention of the world
The mystery revealed!

Mystery!
Revealed!
I stand at the foot of the Cross!

Into the pit You came
With such determined eyes
You reached out Your hand...
It's okay, just let me die!

Why are You pulling me up?
Why is Your blood in my eyes?
I've been lost in the war, but
Why are You on my side?

Looking back, I couldn't see what You wanted
Now I realize, it was me and I am haunted

I am haunted [2x]

I am wounded
I am ruined
I am haunted

I am wounded
I am ruined
I am haunted

By this Love
