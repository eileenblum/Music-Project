I've built my life with these sticks and these stones
With all that I can steal or mend or break
I've built myself a fractured home
and late at night I fear and shake in the unknown

Lovesick. Warfare. Worn thin. Thread bare.

I'll rebuild. I'll add it up. If you know hope, please tell it to reach me soon...

Smashed my life upon the Rock
Breaking all its locks and chains

Test my work by Holy fire
And let the worthless things be ripped away!

Tell me why Your Son was born die?
Why He chose to pay the highest price?
Bringing mercy to the cast aside!
Were we even worth the sacrifice?

What good is life when you're lost and alone?
With nothing in the give that's worth the take?
Who really understands the way that we're thrown?
Into the chaos and the void of the unknown!

I'm sick! Gun shy! No care! Suicide! I'm at the end! Walls closing in! If you know hope, please tell it to reach me soon...

Smashed my life upon the Rock
Breaking all its locks and chains

Test my work by Holy fire
And let the worthless things be ripped away, before the waves consume me!

Tell me why Your Son was born die?
Why He chose to pay the highest price?
Bringing mercy to the cast aside!
Were we even worth the sacrifice?

The only thing a man can take as he passes through the grave is love!

Smashed upon the rock!

I bid you farewell!
