[feat. Brook Reeves]Oppression at the hands of the priest
Progression begins with an overthrow of manipulation

This is our Wittenberg hour
No more religious control!
Out of rebellion we establish the new
Healing for the hurting soul

Live like He lived
Die like He died
Live like He lived
With the world to come in mind

Restoration 'til the war is won!
Reformation! Reformation come!

Oppression at the hands of the priest
Progression begins with an overthrow of manipulation

No other law in this reformation!
Only the law of selfless love!
One chapter closes another begins!
With a standard of fire from above!

Live like He lived
Die like He died
Live like He lived
With the world to come in mind

This is our reformation!
Until the war is won!

Restoration 'til the war is won!
Reformation! Reformation come!

Restoration 'til the war is won!
Reformation! Reformation come!

Reformation come!
