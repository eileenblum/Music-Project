[feat. Mattie Montgomery]No truce, no compromise
Someone gave their life for me
I get it - you better recognize [2x]

Now I will never return to the life
I destroyed the twisted pain of my sinful mind
I broke the pact with the void

Leaving our past behind us
No backward glances
Now we stand in the glory of our second chances

Second chance kids!

Leaving our past behind us
No backward glances
Now we stand in the glory of our second chances

Pain!

From this earth I was born and
From this earth I was formed but
In the end I will soar

Eternal Kingdom reborn!

No truce, no compromise
Someone gave their life for me
I get it - you better recognize

Leaving our past behind us
No backward glances
Now we stand in the glory of our second chances

Second chance kids!

Leaving our past behind us
No backward glances
Now we stand in the glory of our second chances

Second chance kids!

I'm gonna take my chances

No truce, no compromise
Never looking back!
You better recognize!

You let your circumstances write the script
That's worth forgetting

This is your second chance!
Now let the King of Kings take hold of you!
No more regretting!

This is your second chance!

God gave you life!

Take it!
