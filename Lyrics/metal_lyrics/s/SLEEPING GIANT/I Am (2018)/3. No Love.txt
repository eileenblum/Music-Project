We've got no love,
We pushed the world away [2x]

We've got no love

Not your buildings and not your plans
Not your doctrines, oh sons of man!
Not the judgments that push and shove
They'll only know that you're Mine by love
Tear it down, tear it down, go!
There's only one thing that we can show
Break apart the sickening world
There's still only one way they will know
All the world will know
All the world will see [2x]
All the world will call upon
'Cause every soul has a right to believe

How can they believe in You?
How can they know if they can't see our love?
See our love?

Why would they believe it's true?
How can they know if they can't see our love?
See our love?
We've got no love
We pushed the world away [2x]
True love, personified
Holy God, crucified
Hatred makes Him nothing more
Than homophobic holy war
Flags and racists stage the shows
It's all a fraud, no one knows
Faint desire, look above
The truth of God is found in love
All the world will know
All the world will see [2x]
All the world will call upon
'Cause every soul has a right to believe

How can they believe in You?
How can they know if they can't see our love?
See our love?
Why would they believe it's true?
How can they know if they can't see our love?
See our love?
