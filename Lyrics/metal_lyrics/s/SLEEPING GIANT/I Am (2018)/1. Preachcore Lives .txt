Sleeping Giant!
Up from the underground!
We leave behind a legacy of praise!

Kingdom over everything!

I can still feel the rain,
thinking back over these last years,
Reminded again,
You're the only joy in this world of pain! (Pain!)

Let Your word run wild!
And our hearts be filled with Your fire and reign
and recognition of one true name! (Name!)

Let the freedom come and the truth be seen!
My prayer is that all may know what You truly meant to me!

Up from the underground!
We leave behind a legacy of praise!

Don't perform for the crowd,
but reform for the crown!

Sleeping Giant!

Kingdom over everything!

You'll have the words of life
You'll see the fear in their eyes
But don't be intimidated
The darkness in them is just afraid of the light! (Light!)

Let Your word run wild!
And our hearts be filled with Your fire and reign
and recognition of one true name! (Name!)

Let the freedom come and the truth be seen!
My prayer is that all may know what You truly meant to me!

Christ, my strength, my song!
Know, my life is yours
'Til we meet again
I will worship for an audience of One!

For an audience of One!

We leave behind a legacy of praise!
