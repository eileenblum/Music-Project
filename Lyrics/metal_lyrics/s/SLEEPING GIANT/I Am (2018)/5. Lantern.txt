[feat. Bruce LePage of 100 Demons]I was lost and now I'm found [3x]

Born to fear
Left for dead
Straight to hell
Left alone

I was lost and now I'm found

I was lost, I was lost, I was lost in darkness

Disciples of an orphan world, left to find our way alone
How dare you all point at my kind, from the safety of your Father's home?

Father's joy
A Father's crown
A Son is born to let You down

Who else lived beneath the lie?
A man is born to fail and die
Fail!
Fail and die!
Fail!

Lost in darkness

I refuse to hide like a pretender
I give my gift of life to just One
I now light the lantern called surrender
Father come and find your lost son!
Please help me!

I was lost and now I'm found [3x]

Born to fear
Left for dead
Straight to hell
Left alone

I was lost and now I'm found

I was lost, i was lost, i was lost in darkness

We were never born to fear
Religion left Your children here
I will fight to end your shame!
I know my Father and my name!

Father's joy
A Father's crown
A Son is born to take the ground

Who else lived beneath the lie?
A man is born to fail and die
Fail!
Fail and die!
Fail!

Born from darkness

I refuse to hide like a pretender
I give my gift of life to just One
I now light the lantern called surrender
Father come and find your lost son!
Please help me!

Discipled by an orphan world!

Light the lantern! [2x]

Discipled by an orphan world!

Light the lantern!
