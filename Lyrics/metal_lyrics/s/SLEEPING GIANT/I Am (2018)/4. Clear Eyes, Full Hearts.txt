How deep is the scar, the wound, the vow
I swear we've been here before
But everything should be different now

Sail your sinking ship,
Familiar spirits laughing out loud
Cycles of perpetual abuse and addiction I cannot allow

Solider, be sober, be vigilant or be consumed yourself
Be sober, be vigilant, or be consumed!

Don't be consumed!
Be consumed yourself!
Your enemy prowls!

Keep your head straight!

The lion walking the line between legal and lawless
His eyes glisten, there's cracks in your armor

We know this culture defines us
Orphans worthless
Low of the life
Scum of the earth

I defy!
I've made my decision
Oh royal blood

Don't touch their wine
Lest in ignorance drink and fall and die
Speak hope from a clear mind
My eyes are open

My eyes are open
We see the signs of the times
I know I've been here before

Blood in your eyes, your character's gone
But I guess that they've already opened the door
The good book in my grip
A new vision in mind

Disciples sinking with the bottle
That won't stand for me and my kind

Soldier, be sober, be vigilant or be consumed yourself
Be sober, be vigilant, or be consumed!
Don't be consumed!
Be consumed yourself

Disciples,
Keep your head straight!
