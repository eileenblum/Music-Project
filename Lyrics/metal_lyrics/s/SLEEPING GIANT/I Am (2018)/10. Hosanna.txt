Hold up the light to see the Way
Hold fast your hope in peace
The Savior has come!

Move! Bleed with me! Dominate and demonstrate in the presence of hatred!
Bow low! Stand and sing! Please believe â the Savior reigns, so prophesy with me!

Hold up the light to see:
You are the light
The Way
The light of the world

Hold fast your hope in peace
This is the Kingdom!
The Savior has come!

The Savior has come!

I heard Your whisper in my darkest day, "Behold the Lamb who takes the pain away."

What can I say? â You are the God who answered me! You are the Lord whose love has conquered my world!

Suffering King! Author of life! You gave everything!

The world's at war, there's chaos on all side!
He stops the storm!
It's calm in my mind!

Move! Bleed with me! Dominate and demonstrate in the presence of hatred!

What can I say? â You are the God who answered me! You are the Lord whose love has conquered my world!

Suffering King! Author of life! You gave everything!

So we sing Hosanna!

Hosanna!

Hosanna!

Hosanna!
