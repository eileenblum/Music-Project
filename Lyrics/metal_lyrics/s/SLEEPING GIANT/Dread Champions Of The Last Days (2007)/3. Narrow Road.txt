It's ride or die
on this rocky road
the crowds no prize
and I feel so alone

Life
empty burdens and lies
amidst the demons of woe
you feel the flames pile
high
higher

But not me I'm on the narrow road
no room for pride
yeah the walkin is low

Life
I feel so alive
the seed of permanence sown
and there's this joy in my eyes
he's mine
mine

This is my day
the road of life
it's ride or die
