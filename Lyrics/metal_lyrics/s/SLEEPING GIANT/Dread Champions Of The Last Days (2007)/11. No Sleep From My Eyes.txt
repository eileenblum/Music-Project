My master told a parable once
that we should pray and not lose heart.
When You face the Corruption of life,
he says "Come boldly and trust Me"
Grant me justice against my adversary,
that thieving traitor I despise.
you look at me
every word you speak is a prophecy
I feel true over me you speak I believe countering his deceit your will be released within me
Iâm not alone, I rise and smash agendas back
and One day soon Ill see it,
your prayers my prayers they will be answered.

Youâll get no sleep from my eyes
till she comes home.
Youâll get no sleep from me
Ill sit here and pray alone
Youâll get no sleep from me
Ill wait here and pray alone
Youâll get no sleep from me
the lost will see the high cost as you paid I plead War.
The lost will see the high cost you paid plead war.
All My Watchmen, Wake Up!
