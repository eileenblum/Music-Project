Warned
Be Warned
Be Warned

One day the underground
will be the only option

War!
Destruction!
Comes to the shores
of America
One day the price you'll pay
the brutal price to pray
will be the blood of your firstborn sons NO

Now what will you do
will you remain
true to his name
though the Antichrist reigns

and this nation rolls
over bones of believers

they sing "The Saints Are Dead"
we keep on truckin!
Though this nation rolls
Keep Rollin'

they sing "The Saints Are Dead"
we keep on truckin!
Though this nation rolls
Keep Rollin'
