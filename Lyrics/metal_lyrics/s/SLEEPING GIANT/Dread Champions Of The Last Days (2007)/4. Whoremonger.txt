Witness to a youthful lust
who made the same mistake
guess he didn't know
Didn't know it would cost him everything he'd make
Spied that young one
through my window,
on the subtle path
he didn't know the loss
he didn't see the cost
it could've cost him everything

Now he can't find
now he dont understand why
but you see
cuz you cheat and think
that you're free but you know
Now he can't find the way
can someone please come
please come and take it away
before it's to late

wave
goodbye
she'll kill you with a smile
and slit your throat
with a wink of her eye
why
oh brutal heart for a lie
I was that man once
I tell you I'd rather die
Die

He can't just see why
he doesnt see the truth
cuz you know it feels so good
it takes away you
now Disciples would you rise
I know there is sin you despise will you let it go?
and wave goodbye to your friends
and live like it's so

Now he cant find
Why can he see?
Wont you stop him now?
Wont you reach out?
Wont you do something please?
I guess you too busy to see
It brings a real friend to say
In the face of your own Identity.
Please stop him someone

wave
goodbye
she'll kill you with a smile
and slit your throat
with a wink of her eye
why
oh brutal heart for a lie
I was that man once
I tell you I'd rather die

I was!
I was that man once
I'd rather die
DIE!
Why can't you understand why
I only got one heart
and it's the wellspring of life
LIFE!
why oh why will you die?
Give your heart to one love
JESUS CHRIST!
You cant change this all now
You cant let it go
And walk into the light
Please leave this darkness behind

Now
you'll finally know your own mind you can't run this time
desperate to rest
in the peace of the light
I'll be kneeling there
right by your side
Battering hell and I declare tonight.

Hell Relinquish Your Hold On My Sons!
Hell Relinquish Your Hold On My Sons!
