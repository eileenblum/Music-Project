Don't you Judge Me
Don't you dare
One day I'll stand
before a just God
Will you be there?
Or will your false,
your short sighted views
they hold you back
they hold you back from real truth

All
your views leave you
hostage,
from love,
from the real truth.
your held
from the real truth
Held Hostage!

Don't point your finger
like I'm the fake
You let me in
this room that was
your
mistake

All
your views leave you
hostage,
from love,
from the real truth.
your held
from the real truth
Held Hostege!

Don't you Judge Me
Don't you dare
One day I'll stand
before a just God
Will you be there?
Or will your false,
your short sighted views

Follow me
