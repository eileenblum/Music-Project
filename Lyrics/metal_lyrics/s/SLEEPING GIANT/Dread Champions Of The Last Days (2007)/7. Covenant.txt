Though this pain life's reality
You're by my side
its right where the lord says
you oughta be

Your heart is mine
covenant
Your heart is mine
never forget

Though all this pain is my reality
I'm by your side
it's right where I feel
my honored destiny

I'm by your side

A word of truth in my spirit
and I ask you take part
Not just an oath
something I break
I'd no sooner split my own heart
Father
Preserve us

Your Heart is Mine
Covenant
Your Heart is My Heart
Never Forget
