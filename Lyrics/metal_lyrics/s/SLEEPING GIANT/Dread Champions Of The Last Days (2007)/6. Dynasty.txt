My daughter spoke
through tear streaked eyes
said daddy daddy please don't die
said Either way I'm done for
Just remember what I come for Remember me

know the God to whom I pray
there'll be a time Im took away
listen either way I'm done for
just remember What I loved for
remember me
REMEMBER ME!

DESTINY!

When
I'm dead
will my children say?
"My father had a destiny
he fought to taste it
now
because of him
I will rise and say
I'm part of a dynasty
that won't be wasted"

When
I'm dead

Eternal Dynasty

Either way im done for
REMEMBER ME!
Either way im done for
