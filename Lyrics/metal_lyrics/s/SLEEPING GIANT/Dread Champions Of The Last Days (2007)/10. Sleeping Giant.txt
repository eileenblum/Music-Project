Awake
clothe yourself With
with my strength
my betrothed one
Would you
dance from
from yourself a mile
cuz I know you
I chose you
I called you
mine
who are you that you fear
mortal man, oh what a saga
don't you forget me know
cuz I set you on high
take your place know
and be found at the seat
for I am the lord your God
who churns up the waves
the waves of the sea

Awake
Arise
Do You see them?
I see your face

One day
I'll speak your name
I'm the one that
I'm calling you out
awake

arise
put your hands up
look in my eyes
I'm calling you out

He says "Take my hand"

Awake Holy Ones
awake cherished daughters
my honorable sons
you are under attack
quit standing there helpless
(Fight!)
and freakin Fight back
I clothed you with grace
these demons assault you
they spit in your face
What lies you believe
You Belong to Someone
You belong to me!

You belong You me
I've covered you with my right hand
and these Giants have dwelt too long
in this land

Yet my army arises
wake O Zion
Sleeping Giant

wake
rise
And Build Up

Awake
rise
And Build Up

Wake
Rise
why dont Build up?

Awake
Arise
Wake O Zion
Sleeping Giants
