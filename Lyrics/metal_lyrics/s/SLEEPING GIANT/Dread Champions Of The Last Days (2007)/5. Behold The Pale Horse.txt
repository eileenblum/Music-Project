Hail!
The Fourth seal screams
The beast is holding
The veil at bay
And it all
Seems surreal
To war and conquer
Life from all man

Slain by sword
The plagues rising
The beast of burden
Becomes your demise

Oh
My god I've not
Known a fear
So pure
And here
It swings
But my vision now
The rider cloaked in
Heavens name is....

I can't speak
I shake!
I see him!
Slain by sword
the plagues rising

The one who sat on him was death
and ALL hell followed with him.

All hell follows with him
All hell follows with him
All hell follows with him
All hell follows with him

BEHOLD THE PALE HORSE

All
Hell
Follows
With Him
