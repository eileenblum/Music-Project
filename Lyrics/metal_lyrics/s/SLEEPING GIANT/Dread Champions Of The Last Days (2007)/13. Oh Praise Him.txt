Oh Praise Him.
The resurrected Lord Jesus the Lamb who was Slain, The mighty Lion of Judah with Blood on his Mane.
We love You Lord Jesus, we Lift up our lives and sing, All Praise Honor and Glory to you Christ The King.
The faithful True Witness Your Song we will bring.
Our Lord Everlasting Bridegroom Judge and King.
You are worthy Oh Jesus you paid with your blood,
You redeemed us a people that live in the flood of your grace Lord.
Oh Praise Him. He is Holy. He Is Worthy.
