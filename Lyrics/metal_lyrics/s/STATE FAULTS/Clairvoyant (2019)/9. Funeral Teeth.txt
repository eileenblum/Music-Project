How softly moonlight dances
With dew drops on vacant streets
Chalk outlined effigies silent scream
Mothers start baring their funeral teeth
Victims of violent and lucid machines

Shadows crowd chalk outlined streets
A cage of rats picking badges clean
Trigger pulling god complex
Blood spills warm into the sacrament

Bare your fangs
Your funeral teeth
