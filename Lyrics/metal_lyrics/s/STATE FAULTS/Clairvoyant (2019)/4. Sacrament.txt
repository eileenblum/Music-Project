Arrowhead embedded
Softness quelled
Violet
Light trails pull me into you
Love is a rose
They pull at the pedals
Because they hate how it grows

Roses growing from corpses
Consuming sacrament
Roses blooming forgiveness
But softness seldom grows back
If love is a rose
Then be a bouquet

Stop this incision
Semiautomatic
Exasperation infinite
Blood in the sacrament
Pours on the cold cement
Prayers said with violence
Arms crossed in silence
Choking on petals
We pull from our innocence

Stop this incision
Semiautomatic love
