Cruciform irises
Cursing their spectrum love
Sealing their eyelids
Sharpen their poison tongues
Stuck in reversal
Stuck to a moldy book
If love is abomination
Iâm an inverted cross

Moon light dancing on tear drops
Black masses held in our hearts
Lunar hymns baptized in mercury
From our lips to stars

I just want to hold you
And be where you are
Bathed in soft violet light
Let real love reign free
