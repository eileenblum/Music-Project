Soothsayer
Heal me of these ballot box blues
I swear we never knew the razors edge
I swear we never knew the consequence
Resentment
Another thousand years of dark and cold
Destroyers
Tearing down the bleeding alarm
Enforcers
Burning all the evidence

And hanging from a telephone wire
We never knew the razors edge
Taxi cabs turn to spectral hearses
Birdcages lined with bible verses

Ghost cities
Faux-skeletal lighting up the telephones
I swear we never knew the razors edge
I swear we never knew the consequence
Denial
Another million years of dark and cold
Destroyers destroying
Bleed contaminature

They drink blood for contaminature
They burn crosses for contaminature
They drop bombs for contaminature
They sing hymns for contaminature
They spill blood for contaminature
They live their lives in contaminature
