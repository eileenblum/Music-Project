Baptized in stars
Safe in the ether
Softness compelled
Lost in together
I'm floating up
I'm still asleep
My heart keeping vigil
Bathing in dreams
I let myself go
I'm floating away
Passing the first death
And on to the next

I'm still a dreamcatcher
A head in a hurricane
A fistful of summer
A wish on a dead star
I'm opened up
My heart spills it's hate
Sorrow escapes me
Is this awake?

Light in a prism
Love refracted
Show your colors
Flesh is a prison
I'm still a dreamcatcher
