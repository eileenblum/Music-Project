Planetary impact
Hearts in motion
A horoscope dream
A bouquet of incisions bled denial
Momentary contact
Endless sanguine
Antidote streams
The bouquet of incisions bled dry

Celebration envy
Wrapped in a skeletal veil
Subversive apparitions
That mumble into stethoscopes
Amazed we could be the tourniquet
Love so planetary
