Clairvoyant
Young healers
Kill the old ways
Let the past stay dead
Clairvoyant
Cleanse hatred
Let their tongues run dry
Revival
Let the old wounds die
Clairvoyant

Let the old wounds bleed

No suffering
No remorse
No excuses
No mercy
Clairvoyant

Let the old wounds bleed

Hold their heads under water
Stop their gnashing of teeth
This is their baptism
A baptism of fire
