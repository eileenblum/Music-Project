Sleepless phantom pain
Shadows play on window panes
Winter creeps in side of astral planes
Sleepless in this prism
I can see my body below
The veil disintegrates
I'm floating and drifting further
Am I dreaming?
Or floating endlessly
Is this sleeplessness consuming me
I don't know where my spirit goes
I'm lost
Evergreen and June gloom
I'm lost
Vespertine impending doom

I don't know
I don't know
Where my spirit goes
