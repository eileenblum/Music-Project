Spectral debris
Forest green and gold
Burning
Clean and cold
Burning
Building a pyre
Funeral prayers sang soft
Morning dew forms
Inside my eyes
Burn down the night
Creatures sing their songs
Softly singing psalms
In moon light

Shedding my skin
Rejoice in the reverie
Shedding my skin
Rejoice in the suffering

Shedding my old skin
I want to start again
I want to start again
I want to start again

Rejoice
Weâre all just cemetery lights
I want to start again
Weâre all just cemetery lights
