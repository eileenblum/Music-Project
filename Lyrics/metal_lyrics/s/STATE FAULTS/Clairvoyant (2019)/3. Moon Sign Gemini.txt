Endlessly twisting
Deeper and deeper
Sinking my fangs
Into crystalline
Walls in my heart

Endlessly searching
Deeper and deeper
Sanguine and sweet
Is the autumn
That blooms from the dark

I drank a spell from your wishing well
My bodies shining bouquet
Baptism scars opened wide
Pulling cruciform teeth
With moon sign Gemini
I drank a spell from your wishing well
And joined my heart with the night
But it could never quell
My sleepless worry
