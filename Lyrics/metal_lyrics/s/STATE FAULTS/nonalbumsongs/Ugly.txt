You were a light
I am not meant to see
And all I have worn
A disguise, I am ugly
What if I had worn something true?
I could believe I would never be seen

We are one and the same
I believe we can change
If you are who you say you are
We don't have to be afraid

I am a liar
in a kingdom of wolves
you were a sheep
I had charmed in woolen clothes
What if I'd worn something true?
I could believe you would never have been

I am alone
In a world of many forms
All I have known
I have seen most every one before
