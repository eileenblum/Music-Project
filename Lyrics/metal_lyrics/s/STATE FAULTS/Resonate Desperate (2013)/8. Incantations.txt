Iâm painting mountains across timeless passions
I climbed the tops of trees but all I saw in me
Were just cloud mouthed storm fronts clouding crystal visions
A ruined painting disintegrating
I will never be forgiven for the spiderwebs Iâve woven
When the light goes out is it really the end?
Peel back the scab, let it all breathe in
Temporary spirit energies dance under our skin
Shivers splinter in my chest
And spill the bilge flowing in my head
Iâm just a ruined painting, Iâm just a wish resigned
Iâm just a wolf in shepherdâs skin and Iâll eat myself alive
