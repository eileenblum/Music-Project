emotions hide
crystals splinter winter nights
like harsh starlight
watercolor seas
a dream that blooms so endlessly
from a single seed
the autumn strangled 
the roots unfold aimlessly
entangling me
the garden wilts
the roots unfold so aimlessly
strangling me

we seem so human
withered hollow vessels wrapped in paper thin skin
lost in the brilliance
drowned in water color astral waves and time
we seem so human
