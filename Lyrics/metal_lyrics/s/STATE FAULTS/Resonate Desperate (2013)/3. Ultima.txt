A spell reciting incantations 
A spark igniting oil consecrations
A candle burning violently on both of its ends
Flickering wildly like a dying constellation

Its true, I never felt more alone
The room drowned in everlasting dial tone
The spark quelled, that once burned on in infinite
A youth squandered, swallowed in this anxiousness

Give me a sign that youth never dies
That its just buried deep in atrophied dreams

I wish I could turn it off
Kaleidascoping blinding lights
This silence is deafening
I'm lost in my apathy

Stomp me out cause I'm burning at both ends
Stomp me out cause I'm burning on infinite
