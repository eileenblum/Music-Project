This atmosphere hangs so heavy
Pirouetting silhouettes
A thousand thoughts dance in my head
Constellation spiderwebs entangle me
Choking on this rosary
Coughing up prayers like a plague
Longing for just one more fever dream
Longing for just one more fever dream to never wake up

Don't wake me up
Let me bathe in the mist of the morning star
Drifting away
Clinging to the tomb of my childhood heart
Seasons in verse
Autumn winds cut to the bone
As they wish me away
Shivering cold, I am a birth defect

I am awake
I cannot breathe
Put me to sleep
Give me to dreams
