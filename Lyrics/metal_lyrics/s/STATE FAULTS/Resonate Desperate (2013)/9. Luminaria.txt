falling star dew drops on the rearview mirror
disconnect from the self
suffocating slowly in subconscious dilation
peeling scabs with my teeth
i read the verdict in my palms
certain futures lost in present tense
another lump in my throat
another fortune lost to wishing wells

my heart is a desolate peak
life is a lonely disease
embedding splinters in me
life is a lonely disease

wound tight like tourniquets
splinters embedded in consciousness
spiders shedding webs from their spinnerets 
sinking their fangs, this brittle husk just isn't permanent
