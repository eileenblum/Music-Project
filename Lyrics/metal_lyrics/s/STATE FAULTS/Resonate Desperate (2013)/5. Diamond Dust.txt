they're blurring together
sun dogs in diamond dust and coastal fog
i'll try to sleep with my arms crossed
to hold it together
these glacier walls that scratch at my skin
and let the dreams of winter creep in
i am an avalanche swallowing everything
i am an avalanche burying myself alive
and i feel just fine

cause i'm just a mote in a sunbeam
nobody loves me, floating in crystal seas
bathed in uncertainty, lost in eternity
sunspots will swallow me
i'm just a mote in a sunbeam
baptized in mercury, rewire my circuitry
we wish impossible things and sink into nervous energies
wishing impossible things
