i guess that faith was just a seed
that never planted in me
quelling capricorns dreams
close your tired eyes, they're dilated
so pull the dirt from my lungs
and feel the jagged pulse in my skin
as i fall into astral rifts
and feel my body slip in disintegration

staring deep into forever
my wishes resigned
apparitions dance in me
as i welcome in their teeth
maybe someday i will feel
the light in me rebuild and illuminate me
illuminating every single fang that sank into the vein
every single fang i felt disintegrate in me

i feel so empty
the universe inside of me has faded
it just drifts away
our bodies age and entropy
everything that is will disintegrate
