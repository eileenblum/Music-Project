our wishes on dead stars
are echoing incessantly
so desperately its haunting me
enduring existence
resonating tirelessly
a tangled mess of circuitry
i admit it; i'm a mess
of unwavering uncertainty
just forget it
because you'll never ever know
how it feels to resonate so desperately

lost in haunted memories
given to dreams
and drowned in endless apathy
baptized in the glow of the evening star
i turn away, nothing is real
i close my eyes and feel my body slip from me
