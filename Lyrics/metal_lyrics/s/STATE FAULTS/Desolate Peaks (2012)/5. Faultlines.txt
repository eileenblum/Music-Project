I was sleeping, but my heart kept vigil
Through winter nights, deep rivers
Bitter nights, sleep shivers
Window panes and breathless whispers
Haunt me for as long as you'll have me
I couldn't keep you here with me
I couldn't be your diamond eyes
I couldn't see you through your shine
You cant save me
Don't cry for me
I'm already dead
