I feel them caving in
These fragile walls I built from falling stars
From the weight of every wish
That fell on deafened ears and echoed endlessly away
No more desolate peaks
No more wishing that this coastal fog would devour me
I'll wipe the sand from my eyes
And realize you gave me nothing
That I can call my own, nor a heart to call my home
Dreamcatcher, you've lost your baby teeth
So do you believe?
Or have you lost the will to dream?
We're making wishes on dead stars
They echo endlessly, they echo back to me
We're building cities in our hearts
The weight is crushing me, its getting hard to breath
'Cause time cant stay
These feelings so fleeting will all float away
