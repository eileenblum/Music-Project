I never did, I'll never forget
The way the veins burst from your hands
How you were fighting for breath
And holding on when there was nothing left
But bitter nights, sleep shivers
I can hear your voice still screaming
Forever searching for something
I wont let you disappear from my life
This weight upon my chest
"Can you see me?" "Can you feel me?"
Like the rivers we once sailed, I cant stop
Bitter nights, sleep shivers
I can hear you at night
You're screaming "You lied!Â  You lied!"
"This love was never made for me," so you turn your head and die
