I cant move on
'Cause everything means everything to everyone
Time bridles dreams like waves decay the coast
We're broken vessels, we're full of ghosts
My eyes are packed with gauze
I don't want them anymore
'Cause what you see is rarely ever what you get or what you want
My lungs are full of sand
I don't need them anymore
Cause I've been swallowed by a sea that I built from my regrets
This cant be the end
These tidal waves are drowning me
They're swallowing up my effigy
This cant be the end
As a whisper in a roar
A death rattle in a roar
