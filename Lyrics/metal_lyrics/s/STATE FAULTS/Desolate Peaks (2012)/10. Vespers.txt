The cold crept in the day you left
This shepard's skin wont catch my breath
This silence screams to hold me in
When the sun sleeps I'm alone again
Because there's nothing left
Maybe I'm a wolf seeking blood in shepard's skin
A lonely heart that breaks when the sky caves in
Make my palms bleed by the cracks in your teeth
Smashing my teeth on concrete
Scraping my knees on these worn dreams
These thoughts weigh infinite
Like the sands of the sea drowning me
There was no wreckage, no broken bodies
Just the seeds of regret planted on this burning bed
And you'll watch me burn
Maybe I'm a wolf seeking blood in shepard's skin
A lonely heart that breaks when the sky caves in
Alone like the eyes of a wolf whose lost it's pack
Alone like the eyes of a wolf
