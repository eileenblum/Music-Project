In a city between two failed cities
These kids are drowning
Their anchor eyes are cast to the sidewalk
Beneath a sky full of stars
I just wish you'd make me believe you're someone else
I wish you'd take me for more than a silhouette
Like the white owls, like ghosts in the snow
Like you'll never know
Like diamonds crushing diamonds
Like beauty destroying itself
Your heart's a failing city
So pretend you're someone else
Like the white owls
Like ghosts in the snow
