We're kids without homes
Carrying backpacks full of ghosts
We're drunk driving through our lives
Lives like cities without streetlights
And we're alright
Am I cursed with quivering teeth from the cold trapped in my bones?
With a mouth full of clouds the rain pours in my lungs and I am gone
'Cause there's an ocean inside that pulls at me, its tearing me apart
And every wave is a whisper goodbye, and I'm told to carry on
We're just kids without homes
Carrying backpacks full of ghosts
We're drunk driving through our lives
Lives like cities without streetlights
And we're alright
Cause there's an ocean inside that pulls at me, its tearing me apart
And every wave is a whisper goodbye, its just so hard to carry on
