I'm taking my time, just try to remind myself that who
I am is all I want to be.
I'll build it piece by piece, this life in front of me
Just try to remind myself that who
I am is all I want to be.
I can't really explain what's making me feel this way.
Like everything that I love has turned its back on me.
Do you feel alive?
Are you there inside?
I'm taking my time, just try to remind myself that who
I am is all I want to be.
I swear I'll be fine just trying to find myself,
With my life in front of me.
And this is my chance to crush the world with my hands.
I refuse to amount to nothing with my life right in front me
Or is it too late? Is it too late for me?
Is it too late, too late?
It's never too late.
Or so they say.
I refuse to amount to nothing
With my life right in front of me.
I'm taking my time, just try to remind myself that who
I am is all I want to be.
I swear I'll be fine just trying to find myself,
With my life in front of me
