We've been betrayed by our own.
It makes me so sick, like you don't even know.
And I've screamed this over and over,
Your lies they get older and older the more that you spoke
I believed in the person that you were,
Not the one that you've become to be.
It's really not you, just take it from me.
This is your one final warning.
No show me what you're made of.
How can we hope to inspire,
If you don't have the heart of desire?
Tell me, are you here for nothing?
Are you just for show?
We've been betrayed by our own.
It makes me so sick, like you don't even know.
