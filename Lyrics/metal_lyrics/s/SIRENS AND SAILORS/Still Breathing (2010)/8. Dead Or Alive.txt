Dead or alive.
I am digging myself out to take back what is mine
Every moment, every minute.
I'm so sick and tired of you wasting my time.
So stop wasting my time.
Why my eyes see anything in you,
I'm not sure that I will ever know.
So take it as it comes, leave it if it goes.
Dead or alive.
I am waking myself up to leave the pointless behind.
Every moment, every minute.
I'm so sick and tired.
Closed like my coffin.
When it opens, climbing out to come searching for you
You're the living liar and I'm rotting proof
That you thought you could get away with murder.
