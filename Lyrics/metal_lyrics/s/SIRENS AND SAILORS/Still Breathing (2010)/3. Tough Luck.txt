I am free now.
I got out.
It took awhile.
Who's laughing now?!
Don't want to hear what you have to say.
Got what you wanted, but never gave me a single thing
Don't have time to answer, so let the phone just ring
Hello?!
This is the last call you will ever get from me
I'm taking some time to myself.
Lose sight of you to catch a glimpse of someone else.
Who's going to stop me now?
Your image to ashes, our flame has gone out.
And the look on your face tells me
That someones feeling sorry.
Too little, too late, tough luck.
I've had it up to here, had just about enough.
No more patience to put up with it.
No more desire to give into this.
Who's going to stop me now?
Your image to ashes, our flame has gone out.
Too little, too late, tough luck.
I've had it up to here, had just about enough.
So long! Goodbye!
I'm taking some time to myself, just try to stop me now.
