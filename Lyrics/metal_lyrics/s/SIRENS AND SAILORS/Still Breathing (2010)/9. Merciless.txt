If I could make it out of this one alive,
Wouldn't that be something else?
Out of this one alive, would I have proven myself?
There's no time for this now.
There's no time for this, not right now.
Save yourself and just find your way out.
This is what they'd want.
Give in. Give up.
Merciless, meet your maker.
Just admit you've got nothing on me.
Merciless, you're the trader.
Just admit you've got nothing on me.
If I could make it out of this alive,
I'll be the one to fly.
Merciless, meet your maker.
Just admit you've got nothing on me.
Merciless, you're the trader.
Just admit you've got nothing on me.
And I was there to witness the destruction
Of the world in its ending.
