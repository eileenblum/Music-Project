I'm living this conspiracy.
There's something hidden, buried underneath.
Nothing is ever as it seems in this fiction we call reality.
If this is it, if this is how it is,
Then I shall never rest.
If this is it, if this is how it is,
You ain't seen nothing yet.
They lead us on just write us off,
As we waited to hear the truth in abandoned promises.
Forget them, they wouldn't give us the cure.
They left us all to die here and rot that's for sure.
I don't know who I can trust anymore.
In a maze I'm lost in my own mind.
Can you help me find the way?
And I will pay for this with my own life.
Drain the blood right from my veins.
You'll see that my heart still beats.
And oh, what a waste.
I gave it all just for barely a taste.
Check the pulse, my lungs are full,
I'm still breathing.
An I'm not ready to leave until I've said my piece.
In a maze I'm lost in my own mind.
Can you help me find the way?
And i will pay for this with my own life.
Drain the blood right from my veins.
You'll see that my heart still beats.
