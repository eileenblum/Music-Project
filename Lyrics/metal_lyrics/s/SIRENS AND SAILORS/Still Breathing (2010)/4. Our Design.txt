Machines, waking up to another daily routine.
Is this life all that you thought it could be?
Living just like the machines.
Your tangled wires transmit their man made virus.
I know the truth hurts, but this is who we are.
No longer humans,
We have all been replaced by blank emotionless faces.
And all of our hearts made of mechanical parts.
How has it come to this?
And where were the signs we missed?
We've built our own apocalypse.
Now we're falling to pieces again.
This isn't the first time we've built our own apocalypse
We're in this struggle together.
Our lives designed by crooked minds.
We want the answers, they just feed us lies.
I know the truth hurts, but this is who we are.
How has it come to this?
Where were all the signs that we had missed?
In their eyes there's no compromise,
But that's for us to decide.
Our Design.
Now we're falling to pieces again.
This isn't the first time we've built our own apocalypse
We're in this struggle together.
Machines, is this life all that you thought it could be?
