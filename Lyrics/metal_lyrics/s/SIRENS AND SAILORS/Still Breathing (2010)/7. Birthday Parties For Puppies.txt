I'm caught in between living this life and chasing a dream
I have worked so hard and I've come so far.
This isn't over yet.
It's only just begun.
I'd like to thank you one and all for giving love,
And showing compassion.
If I had another chance,
I'd make the choices I made, do this all over again.
So please don't go worrying yourself to death.
All I need is a good excuse,
I haven't found one yet.
Oh, I need this more than you know.
If there's a will, there's a way.
It may mean nothing to you, it's everything to me.
This is my only escape I'll never give up.
And this is my only, my one and only true love.
I am nothing without my thoughts.
Nothing.
A toast to the times we have had.
Here's to the memories we haven't made yet.
How could I ever forget the impressions you left?
I'm not trying to confuse you,
But I don't think you fully understand that
This is my only chance to become something extraordinary
Please don't go worrying yourself to death.
All I need is a good excuse, I haven't found one yet.
Oh, I need this more than you know.
If there's a will, there's a way.
It may mean nothing to you, it's everything to me.
This isn't over yet.
It's only just begun.
