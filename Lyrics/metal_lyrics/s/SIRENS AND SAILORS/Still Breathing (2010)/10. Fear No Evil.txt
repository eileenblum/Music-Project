We set our hopes high like the moon
That gives light in the darkest corners of night.
There's a feast in the shadows.
Come one. Come all.
Fresh flesh. Indulge.
The line between the earth and the sky.
Your legs cannot keep up with the panic in your mind,
As we hunt you down to eat you alive.
Your hands reaching, stretching towards the sun.
Barely breathing, don't look back just run.
You're living amongst the living dead.
And your future is in circles again.
You're asking, "How could this happen to me?".
You're reaching towards the sun, don't look back just run
If hope could only save you now.
Be one with us.
You're living amongst the living dead.
And your future is in circles again.
You're asking, "How could this happen to me?".
The Living dead.
Bite your neck, just sink my teeth in.
Fear no evil.
Welcome to the life of the living dead.
Bite your neck, just sink our teeth in.
Fear no evil.
Welcome to the life of the living dead.
