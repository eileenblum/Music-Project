Now is the time to take the wrongs and make them right.
No more orders or restraints, no more life left to waste It's the dawn of a new age.
We must fill the void.
To go it alone is our only choice.
The only question that I have needs an answer.
Are you feeling up to this?
Has the thought occurred you're in over your head?
If you never try, you'll never know.
I don't want to be the one to wait
For someday to never come.
Now is the time to take the wrongs and make them right.
We must fill the void.
To go it alone is our only choice.
Now is the time.
Are you feeling up to this?
Has the thought you're in over your head?
If you never try, you'll never know.
Waiting for someday to never come.
Now is the time to take all the wrongs and make them right
I don't want to be the one to wait
For someday to never come.
Someday never comes.
This is our chance,
To start living each day like its our last.
This is our chance.
