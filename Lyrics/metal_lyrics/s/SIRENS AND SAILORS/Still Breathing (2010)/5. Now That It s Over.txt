Losing you, and I am stuck here regretting this.
My face in my hands.
It's like you're pushing it all away,
When all you want is to get closer.
Cursed by the mistakes we've made, now that it's over.
We can't keep doing this day to day,
It's too much weight on our shoulders.
Cursed by the mistakes we've made, now that it's over.
I'm hoping that you'll regret.
I'm hoping that you'll fade just like the memory you are
You couldn't make the change.
We're doing better apart.
My face in my hands.
Fade just like the memory you are.
You couldn't make the change.
Pushing it all away, when all you want is to get closer
Cursed by the mistakes we've made, now that it's over.
We can't keep doing this day to day,
It's too much weight on our shoulders.
Cursed by the mistakes we've made, now that it's over.
I'm hoping that you'll regret.
Fade just like the memory you are,
You couldn't make the change.
We're doing better apart.
My face in my hands.
