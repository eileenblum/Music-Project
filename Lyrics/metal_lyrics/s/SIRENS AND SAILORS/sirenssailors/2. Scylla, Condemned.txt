Somewhere in this vast ocean
She stands in utter misery with
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 heads and 12 feet.
Oh no !
All hands to deck, I'm afraid we're going down.
Scylla please !
You've made enough wives to widows
And enough men into meat.
I'm sure you could just spare me and my ship.
Can we mend your broken heart to ever love them again ?
