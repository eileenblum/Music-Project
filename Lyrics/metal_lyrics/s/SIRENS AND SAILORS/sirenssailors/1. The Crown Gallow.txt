The way she smells, it's addicting.
I want her, but she won't ever have me.
So I'll wait until she sleeps.
Demonize her dreams.
In the garden, there are secrets left
To be untold. She's ice cold.
And I'm his wanted man,
So I will take my leave and never
Come back to this evil place again.
We've all done it, we're so quick to judge.
The king calls, and I'm his wanted man
So I return from leave and come right
Back to this evil place again.
I fall, knees to soil.
Here I am again in this city of lust and sin.
All hail, he is dead.
His final breath, then off with his head.
