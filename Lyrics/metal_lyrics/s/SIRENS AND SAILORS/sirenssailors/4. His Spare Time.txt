Is there a clean conscience in this room ?
Because I just can't get over the way she grooves.
Cheap bright red lipstick and bitter sweet perfume.
I'd go through hell for you, and only for you.
Just don't put your lips on the collar of this shirt.
Pay for pleasure.
We that wear ties, lead lives that are full of lies.
Everything I ever gave you, was anything that you needed.
And whatever I saw in you, was never something I believed in.
Diamonds sparkle.
It keeps your mouth shut.
Why do I pay for pleasure ?
My heart pumps lust, not love.
This is the diary of a well dressed rich man.
