Walking through life on a tight rope. So afraid to fail, so afraid to fall. Hiding behind the shadow of who you really are, cuz someone told you, "you're not good enough". Hopeless one, don't hang your head. Who you become is up to you in the end. It's a long way down, don't let yourself hit rock bottom. Stop living to die, start dying to live. This is where the torment ends. Stop living to die, start dying to live, this is where your life begins. You value everyone else's opinions, but never seem to value your own. Why be a pawn when you can be a king? And lead yourself straight to victory.
