Never sure of which direction to go. We hold a compass, but have no place to call home. A sense of wonder and a desire to grow, as we venture into the unknown. Find our place here, what's our purpose? There has to be more than what's on the surface. Rising Moon, Setting Sun, cast your shadow, watch over us. As we sleep and drift away, into a dream, upon these waves. Rising Moon, Setting Sun, cast your shadow, watch over us. Soaring above, never sinking below. We will persevere, we will stay afloat. Through every storm and test of our will. Our courage can not ever be killed. Show the world who you really are, this is your universe, it was yours from the start. Show the world who you really are, this is your universe, write your name in the stars.
