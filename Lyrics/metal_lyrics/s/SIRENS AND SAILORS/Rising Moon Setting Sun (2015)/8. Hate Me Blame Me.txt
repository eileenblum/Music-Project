I'm always beating myself up. I scream and I yell, but my voice is gone. You think it's easy to let go and just let your mind flow, but trust me it's not. So here we are at the start again, and I'm falling apart. You can hate me, you can blame me, just like everyone always does. I can't speak, my stomach feels weak, I'm running out of words to say. I can see the end so clear, but it feels so far away. You can hate me, you can blame me, you can try, but you're never gunna change my mind. This is just the way I live my life. My world is spinning around me. I feel like I'm drowning. I feel so confined. And everyday it's the same old thing, I'm starting to think it's not worth my time. You can hate me, you can blame me, you can try but you're never gunna change me. Now it's time to say goodbye to everything you thought you knew. You can hate me, you can blame me, you can try but you're never gunna change me. Now it's time to say goodbye to everything you knew about me.
