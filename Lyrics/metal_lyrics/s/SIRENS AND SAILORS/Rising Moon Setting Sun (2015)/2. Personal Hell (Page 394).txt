Welcome to my personal hell, won't you be my guest? I'm just a tormented soul, demented, and possessed. No matter how high I climb, I keep falling back. Will I ever escape this endless punishment? There is a monster inside of me, it will eat you alive. Stay away or you'll be next. Run, run for your life! Save me, save me from myself. I keep hiding secrets that I wish I could tell, but I'll never tell. I said I didn't need it, but I could really use the help. The way that I've been feeling is a way I've never felt. The evil's overtaking, my eyes are seeing red, soon I will be covered in the blood that has been shed. Into the fire, that's where I fell. Welcome to my own personal hell. I greeted Death like an old friend. As he reached out his hand I felt my body descend. Into the fire, that's where I fell. Welcome to my own personal hell.
