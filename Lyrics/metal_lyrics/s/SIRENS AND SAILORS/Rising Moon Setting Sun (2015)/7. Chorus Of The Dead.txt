Here I lay rotting in regret
Underneath the tombstone where they put me to rest
Always wishing that I had another chance
Always hoping to heartbeat in my chest

[2x]
I used to love my life when I had it
Now I spend all of my time in this casket

Listen to the melody of the voices in your head
Sing along so willingly to the chorus of the dead

What the fuck was wring with me?
Where did I go wrong?
I took for granted everyday of my life forever lost

Rolled the dice
I was gambling
I took the risk and I went all in
A mistake I will not forget
Here I lay rotting in regret

Listen to the melody of the voices in your head
Sing along so willingly to the chorus of the dead

[2x]
I used to love my life when I had it
Now I spend all of my time in this casket

My life is over
Now I'm d e a d
Oh shit

Listen to the melody of the voices in your head
There is no escaping from the chorus of the dead
