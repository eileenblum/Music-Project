I am never gunna change just to make you happy. If it's not worth it to you, then it's not worth it to me. You ungrateful waste of my time. Pull the plug and watch us flatline. Falling behind me, we were something, now we're nothing. Please don't remind me, don't say you ever cared, cuz you were never there for me. Don't say you ever cared, cuz you were never there, never there for me. This isn't what I want, you are not who I thought, who I thought you'd be. I feel pathetic, I hung onto every word. Your speech perfected as if you had it all rehearsed. Put the nail in the coffin and cover me with the dirt. And there's no getting better, it will only get worse. I don't know why I hurt or ever questioned my self worth over someone like you. But if you want to see the scars, I will carve out my own heart just to show you the proof. I'm dead inside because of you.
