If you want it, come and get it. You talk too much, but don't live it. Just another running mouth wasting air to breathe. You act like you deserve it, when you know damn well you haven't earned it. You will never get any respect from me. You've been handed everything. Never worked for anything. You'd hate to admit it, but you know it's true. You're the one that waged this war, so what are you waiting for? I'm standing right in front of you. You are no better than me. I am the opponent you will never defeat. Pick it the fuck up! Some people just never learn. Play with the fire and you're gunna get burned. You are no better than me. I am the opponent you will never defeat. Bring it mother fucker!
