There is no need to prove you wrong, we all know that you're the guilty one. Blood on your hands with your weapon drawn. Knew it was you, I knew it all along. You'd kill me with kindness, if kindness was a rope that you could wrap around my neck to watch me choke. You would make me a promise that you know you couldn't keep, just to stab me in the back and watch me bleed. After everything we've been through, you go and throw it all away. We were the best of friends, now we're the worst of enemies. I would sleep with one eye open if I were you. Two can play at this game that I'll never lose. You fake, two faced, sad example of the human race. Never give, always take. Suffer the consequence of the choice you made.
