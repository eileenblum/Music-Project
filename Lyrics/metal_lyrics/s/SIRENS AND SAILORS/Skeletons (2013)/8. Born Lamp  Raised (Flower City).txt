Go grab your guy
Go grab your girl
Because tonight we are the kings and queens of the world

So raise your glass
Propose a toast
This goes out to the city that I call home sweet home
Because there's no place like home sweet home

Get to the show
Let's rock and roll
Tell all your friends bring everyone you know
We'll live it up
We'll go all out
I'd like to see you try to stop us now

This is my pride
This is my everything
These are my friends
This is my family
Born and raised
There's no place that I'd rather be

This is our time
It's all we know
Let's make the most of this and just let go

So raise your glass
Propose a toast
This goes out to the city that I call home sweet home
Because there's no place like home sweet home
Because there's no place like home sweet home

This goes out to the city that I call home sweet home
Because there's no place like home sweet home

This is my pride
This is my everything
These are my friends
This is my family
Born and raised
There's no place that I'd rather be

[2x]
My heart will never leave here
Never
Hometown pride
I'll love this city forever

Because there's no place like home sweet home
Because there's no place like home sweet home

This is my pride
This is my everything
These are my friends
This is my family
Born and raised
There's no place that I'd rather be
