Once again I've been held back by the ropes that tie me down
I've been here a thousand times, somehow I keep breaking out
I know it's the fight in me denying your every doubt
All that you have bled for, now it's time to prove yourself
So chant it loud!

If this ship goes down then I'll go sinking with it
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in
I won't die, I won't die here tonight
I will fight, only the strong survive

The world will not wait for you
This is your only chance
To leave behind your legacy
Don't let it slip right through your hands

I won't die, I won't die here tonight
I, I will fight, only the strong survive

If this ship goes down then I'll going sinking with it
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in
If this ship goes down then I'll going sinking with it (I'll go sinking with it)
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in

The world will not wait for you
This is your only chance
To leave behind your legacy,
Don't let it slip right through your hands

The world will not wait for you
The world it will not wait
The world will not wait for you
The world it will not wait
Now it's time to prove yourself!

I won't die, I won't die here tonight (here tonight)
I will fight, only the strong survive

If this ship goes down then I'll go sinking with it
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in
If this ship goes down then I'll go sinking with it (I'll go sinking with it)
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in
