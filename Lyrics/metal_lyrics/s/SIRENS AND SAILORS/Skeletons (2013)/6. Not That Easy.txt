Let's go!

Suddenly, everything is going to change
And they say nothing good can ever stay
But you know that Iâd have to disagree
Because they've never met someone like me

Oh, I know that love is a test
But we are stronger, stronger than rest
I know that our hearts can endure
Because you're mine and I'm forever yours

I know itâs not that easy
Sometimes it gets so hard
Youâre always here with me
Even when we are apart
I know itâs not that easy
I know it's not that easy
I know it's not that easy

I know it's not easy
To love someone like me
We'll prove them wrong, youâll see
I know itâs not easy

Oh my darling, my dear
You have nothing to fear
I am right here by your side
AS the years come and go
I just want you to know
That my heart will stand the test of time

I know itâs not that easy
Sometimes it gets so hard
Youâre always here with me
Even when we are apart
I know itâs not that easy
I know it's not that easy
I know it's not that easy

I know it's not easy
To love someone like me
We'll prove them wrong, youâll see
I know itâs not easy

It will always be us against the world
It will always be us against the world
Itâs us against the world!

I know it's not easy
To love someone like me
We'll prove them wrong, youâll see
I know itâs not easy

I know itâs not that easy
Sometimes it gets so hard
Youâre always here with me
Even when we are apart
I know itâs not that easy
I know it's not that easy
I know it's not that easy
