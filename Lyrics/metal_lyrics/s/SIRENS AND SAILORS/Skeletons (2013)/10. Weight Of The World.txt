Rise up!
You aren't the only one
Who lives in a constant struggle
We all have our own hardships so grab the hand of your closest brother
This time we will become victorious

Our heart, they cannot take that away from us
Sometimes we hurt, sometimes we bleed
A shred of hope is all we need
A lesson learned, what will it be?
What will it take to set us free?

With the weight of the world
By the glare of the sun
Where the universe has left me to belong

Let go of all your past mistakes
Your worries, and regrets
Thatâs not the life you lead
That was the life you left
Don't you forget

With the weight of the world
By the glare of the sun
Where the universe has left me to belong
With this brain in my head (with this brain in my head)
I can think for my own (I can think for my own)
I don't need someone to tell me what I already know (what I already know)

I can think for my own

With this brain in my head
I can think for my own
With this brain in my head
I can think for my own

With the weight of the world
By the glare of the sun
Where the universe has left me to belong
With this brain in my head (with this brain in my head)
I can think for my own (I can think for my own)
I don't need someone to tell me what I already know
I can think for my own
