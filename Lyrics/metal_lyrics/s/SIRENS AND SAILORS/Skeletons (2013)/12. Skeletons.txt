I see with the eyes in the back of my head
I always knew that this could never last
You dug this grave for yourself, so now you're gonna lie in it

The thought of you makes me sick to my stomach
To trust you was a lesson learned
If I saw your body catch fire
I swear Iâd just watch it burn baby, burn
I wanna watch you burn baby, burn

Look at you now
Good as dead
A feast for the vultures that fly overhead
Who are you now?
You're a mess
You pushed them away, now you having nothing left

You dug this grave, now you will lay
Under every choice and decision you made
Nothing you say will ever change
The way I feel about you
Thatâs the price that you pay

The thought of you makes me sick to my stomach
To trust you was a lesson learned
If I saw your body catch fire
I swear Iâd just watch you burn baby, burn
I wanna watch you burn baby, burn

Look at you now
Good as dead
A feast for the vultures that fly overhead
Who are you now?
You're a mess
You pushed them away, now you have nothing left

Look at you now
Good as dead
A feast for the vultures that fly overhead
Who are you now?
You're a mess
You pushed them away, now you have nothing left

You have nothing left!
