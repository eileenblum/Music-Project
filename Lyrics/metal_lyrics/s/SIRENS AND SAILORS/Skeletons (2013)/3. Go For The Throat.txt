I'm going for the throat
I don't care anymore
You can't hide the truth from me
But you tried
Yeah, you tried so hard
And you failed so miserably

I have nothing left to lose
I wish that I could say
Say the same for you

I have nothing left to lose
Everything to gain, nothing left to lose
I wish that I could say the same for you
I wish that I could say the same for you

I don't need explanations
Save your excuses for somebody who really cares
You have proven yourself to be useless
What's done is done
What's fair is fair

I have nothing left to lose
I wish that I could say
Say the same for you

[2x]
This is for what you did to me
This is for what you did

I have nothing left to lose
Everything to gain, nothing left to lose
I wish that I could say the same for you
I wish that I could say the same for you

This is for what you did to me
This is for what you did

You have gone too far this time
So long and good riddance

This is for what you did to me
This is for what you did

I have nothing left to lose
Everything to gain, nothing left to lose
I wish that I could say the same for you
I have nothing left to lose
I wish that I could say the same for you
I have nothing left to lose
I wish that I could say the same for you

I'm going for the throat
I don't care anymore
You can't hide the truth from me
