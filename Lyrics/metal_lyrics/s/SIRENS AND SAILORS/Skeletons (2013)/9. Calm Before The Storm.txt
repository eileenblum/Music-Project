Itâs been a long time coming
I finally figured it out
Thereâs nothing left for us to talk about

Iâm going to make this right
Iâm taking back whatâs mine

To give up is for the weak
You beat me down, but now Iâm back on my feet
I called for help, but you never took the time to listen
To anyone but yourself

This is the calm before the storm
You'll get whatâs coming to you, you have been warned

I've heard all the lies
Now Iâve opened my eyes to see
Youâre not the person you used to be

Iâm going to make this right
Iâm taking back whatâs mine
All of this wasted time
I'm taking back whatâs mine

The opportunity that you were handed
It went straight to your head (it went straight to your head)
I gave my advice, but you never took the time to listen
To anything that I said

This is the calm before the storm
You'll get whatâs coming for you, you have been warned

I've heard all the lies
Now Iâve opened my eyes to see
Youâre not the person you used to be

You may have won the battle
But I will win the war

This is the only thing I have
The only thing worth fighting for

You may have won the battle
But I will win the war

This is the calm before the storm
You'll get whatâs coming for you, you have been warned

I've heard all the lies
Now Iâve opened my eyes to see
Youâre not the person you used to be
You're not the person you used to be
