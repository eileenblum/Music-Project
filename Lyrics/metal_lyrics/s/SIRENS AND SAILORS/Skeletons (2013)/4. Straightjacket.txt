I am the maniac that lives inside your mindlessness
You think you're crazy but truthfully I'm the one that is
Some people can't tell the difference
They question themselves and their entire existence

I am on the brink, on the brink of insanity
Blurring the lines of fiction and reality
I am on the brink, on the brink of insanity

This is the beginning of my end
A single idea leads me straight to the edge
My unhealthy obsession
Poisoned by the possession
I'm trying

I'm trying to erase, I'm trying to forget
I need to forget
I need to escape from this prison in my head
From this prison in my head

I feel lost with nowhere to turn
What did I do to ever deserve
This never-ending nightmare
This constant burden that I bear

I am on the brink, on the brink of insanity
Blurring the lines of fiction and reality
I am on the brink, on the brink of insanity
I'm trying

I'm trying to erase, I'm trying to forget
I'm trying to forget
I need to escape from this prison in my head
From this prison in my head

For as long as I live, for as long as I breathe
I'll always be my own worst enemy
For as long as I live, for as long as I breathe
I'll always be my own worst enemy
I'll always be my own worst enemy
Pick it up!

I'm trying
I'm trying to erase, I'm trying to forget
I'm trying to forget
I need to escape from this prison in my head
From this prison in my head
