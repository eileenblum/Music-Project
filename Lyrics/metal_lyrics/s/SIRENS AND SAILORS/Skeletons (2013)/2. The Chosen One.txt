Where is this path never traveled leaning?
You have the choice to take control
You have the strength to defeat them all

Donât you give up, the time is near
For all to see, and for all to hear

Donât you give up, the time is near
This is your life so make it,
For all to see, and for all to hear
You are destined for greatness!

Youâve risked it all to get where you are now
It wasnât easy, but you made it somehow
You have the drive to see things through
Youâve earned your place and paid your dues

Donât you give up, the time is near
For all to see, and for all to hear

Donât you give up, the time is near
This is your life so make it,
For all to see, and for all to hear

This is your life, this is your life
You are destined for greatness
This is your life, this is your life
You are destined for greatness

Donât you give up the time is near
For all to see and for all to hear

Donât you give up the time is near
This is your life so make it,
For all to see, and for all to hear
You are destined for greatness!

This is your life, this is your life
You are destined for greatness
This is your life, this is your life
You are destined for greatness
