Itâs time for a change, time for a cleansing
I canât just look away and keep pretending like thereâs nothing wrong
Because this was all my fault

Heaven help me, Iâve been going through hell
Heaven help me, Iâve been going through hell
I donât know how much more of this stress I can take
Heaven help me, Iâve been going through hell
(Heaven, heaven help me
Heaven, heaven help me)

Beg for forgiveness
Iâm so sorry for the things that Iâve done
With the devil upon my left shoulder
Asking me to against the will of my God
Donât listen to the demons, rid them from my head

Enter into darkness
Prepare for the end
I have felt so sick
I donât need a doctor, call the exorcist
I have felt so sick
I donât need a doctor, call the exorcist
(Help, someone save me)
I donât need a doctor, call the exorcist

Beg for forgiveness
Iâm so sorry for the things that I've done
With the devil upon my left shoulder
Asking me to go against the will of my God

Down on my knees I pray, to see the light of another day
Down on my knees I pray, to see the light of another day

I can hear the angels above me, trying to guide me home
I can feel the evil surrounding, dragging me down below

I have felt so sick
I donât need a doctor, call the exorcist
(Help, someone save me)
I have felt so sick
I donât need a doctor, call the exorcist!
(Help, someone save me)
