This isn't how I pictured this, I saw it all so differently.  Of what does this life consist?  Disappointments and certain tragedies.  And every time that I feel like I'm close, it all just slips away from me.  Finally, our time has come, we've been waiting here so patiently.  This is what we've always wanted and everything...everything is looking up, we knew that there was something more.  This is our chance to, this is our time to break out all of the chains that held us down before.  After all these years, what have we to show?  We have conquered the impossible.  Nothings impossible.  All the dreams I've chased, all the choices the I have made are falling into place.  Leave it all behind, leave it all in the past.  I'm moving forward now, and I'm never looking back.  Follow your heart and take a chance.   This is what we've always wanted and everything...everything is looking up, we knew that there was something more.  This is our chance to, this is our time to break out all of the chains that held us down before.  After all these years what have we to show?  Nothings impossible.  All the dreams I've chased are falling into place.  It was never enough for you.  You were never enough for me.  I'm moving on.
