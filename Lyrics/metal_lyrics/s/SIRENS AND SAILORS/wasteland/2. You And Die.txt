You could choose to hold a grudge for your entire life, in your own world, with your closed mind.  Why do I even try?  How can I trust in anyone who can barely even trust in themselves?  You get what you deserve, there is no remorse for the scum of the earth.  Deep down inside you're swimming in an ocean of guilt.  You blame us all for the walls that you've built.  One day you'll find that you've lost touch with everyone.  There's not a person in site.  So just open your eyes to a world you've never seen, and open your mind to a thought you'd never think.  You get what you deserve there is no remorse for the scum of the earth.  No remorse.  The innocent is looking awfully guilty.  I'm not convinced, and I will not be deceived.  I honestly wish you nothing but the best.  I know you'll always hate me.  So just open your eyes to a world you've never seen, and open your mind to a thought you'd never think.  You have no one to blame but yourself.  So just open your eyes to a world you've never seen, and open your mind to a thought you'd never think.
