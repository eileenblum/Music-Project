Another day lost, another week wasted, another month gone, another year fading away.  How can I dream if I don't ever sleep?  When does it pay off?  I'm sick of waiting.  When do I become everything that I've wanted to be?  How can I dream if I don't ever sleep?  Tonight, I just stare into the dark and hope there's a light that will lead me to the answers for all of the questions I'm asking inside.  Gone away, are all of the things that we used to say, and never again will I feel this way.  This is last time you'll hear me say, "it's not okay".  This is my life, it's what I make it.  This is my time, it's now or it's never for me.  How can I dream if I don't ever sleep?  Tonight, I just stare into the dark  and hope there's a light.  I hope there's a light on the other side.  As I sink my hands into the sands of time, keep moving forward, keep moving forward.  Gone away, are all of the things that we used to say, and never again will I feel this way.  This is the last time you'll hear me say, "it's not okay".  Yesterday, is just a memory that fades away.  I'm so sick of just living day by day.  This is the last time you'll hear me say, "I'm not okay".  How can I dream if I don't ever sleep?
