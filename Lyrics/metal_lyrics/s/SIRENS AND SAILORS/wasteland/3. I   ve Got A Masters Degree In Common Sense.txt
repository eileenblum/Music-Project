Don't tell me how to feel.  I'm through with second guessing.  Old wounds have now healed, immune to the affection.  Lay all my doubts to rest.  No need for opinions, this is just how it's gotta be.  If you'd shut up and listen, I need some space, I can barely breathe.  I gave you all that I've got, it's all I have to give.  Don't tell me how to feel.  I'm through with second guessing truth.  I have to wake up and realize, I need to escape from reality.  Oh, you're pushing me over the edge.  I have no patience left, there's nothing more to give.  I have to admit, I'm so over this.  I'm so through with trying to become everything to everyone who expects me to lay my life out on a limb.  Don't tell me how to feel.  I'm through with second guessing truth.  I have to wake up and realize, I need to escape from reality.  You think you know what it takes just to let this go.  Don't tell me how to feel.  I'm through with second guessing.  How's it feel?  How does it feel?
