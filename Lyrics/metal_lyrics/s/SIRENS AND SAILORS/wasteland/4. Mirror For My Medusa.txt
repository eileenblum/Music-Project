I can't bear the site of meeting eyes that form statues.  A torch bestows the light, use a shield to block your view.  A monster's tomb.  Reflection is the weapon that I choose, your own image staring right back at you.  And it's a mirror for my Medusa, she looks nothing like she used to.  Medusa!  I could explain, but it's no use.  Replace the truth with an excuse.  You better love me now before I'm gone for good.  Breaking your promises just like I knew you would.  I can't bear the site of the look in your eyes.  You once had my heart, but it was always yours to lose.  Suffer from the consequence, the choice was yours to choose.  I always knew that I could never fully trust in you.  I could never trust in you.  You better love me now before I'm gone for good.  Breaking your promises, just like I knew you would.  You better love me now before I'm gone for good.  I'm gone for good.
