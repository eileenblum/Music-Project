So tell me, what will it profit you now?
To gain the world, but forfeit your soul...
In your lust for everything else,
It seems you've lost yourself

You flirted on with ignorance, betrothed to all your lies.
Did you wonder how much more I'd take before I realize?
Slipping away, you knew this truth, taboo, would soon or late catch up with you
But what you didn't know is that I'd grow much too tired of this to advise

So, now I'm choking madly on this hilarity. And, its all thanks to you.
You are a shadow; a perfect mockery of your own ideals

Face me:
Yet, those eyes do look so familiar
I think I saw my life through them, once

So, go on and take the time to distinguish your face
And so, be the first to put yourself in place
Dirt out of fingernails; blood off our hands
Expect of ourselves what of the world we demand
These eyes staring back are where change can begin
And, the struggle for yourself, it must be fought from within

No, what's done is done
The stranger in the mirror runs at the sight of his loss
No, what's done is done
The stranger in the mirror lives for you both
