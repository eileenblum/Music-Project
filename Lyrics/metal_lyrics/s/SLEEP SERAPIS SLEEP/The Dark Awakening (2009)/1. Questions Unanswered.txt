Believe me, this time
Our time, your precious time, has ticked the seconds last
For since that frozen second-hand no more lives in the past
Lose these unforgiving pains, which pump that poison in your veins
I've seen more thrill in spineless chill or playwrights left miscast

Words to wise, or not so much: cries fall on ear's relapse
A lesser toll than a common goal with Death might suit perhaps
A jaded smirk at a thousand's grave was the only thing in life you gave
Leave suicide unglorified or watch more buildings collapse

Thousands Dead: This is where our story begins
Thousands More: Where yours, inevitably, ends

So, here's to you!

You selfish son of a bitch,
How could you think I'd forget?
Cause we know, in our hearts,
That you'll never forgive!

So, here's to you!
And your glorious reign
I know, you got what you want
Because you're king for the day...
...but when tomorrow comes, will you want what you got?

I can't believe you've lasted all this time without
Knowing the harm that you intended
Another false threat, your lies accumulate
While in your blood empty promises coagulate

That's when you know that,
There's no words that account
The bloodbath that your wrath
And gluttony amassed

That's when you know that there's
No words that account for your fury

Victims of their Cause
They mock their fate
