The truth has set free...
A sickly embodiment, the thunder that shakes my identity
With guilted ink, it rewrites our reality
On a stone carved of all my imaginings
Making men once strong weak, in days now dark as night
It will never stop until I forget (I forgive)
...until the ink in my blood runs dry
And so, my thoughts haunt me:
Your last moment's revisiting
I stand humbled by the grasp of oblivion
In a staggered descent
For what seems like years,
Towards the realization of unimaginable solitude
And if I could, I'd suffer this myself
But the untold truth is that you wouldn't have it any other way
No, I will earn this sacrifice.
For, you show me what it is to live.
I will claim this uncertainty for myself, and give it a name that it fears.
This is the day I abandon truth for the answers I've been searching for...
Today, even the stone beneath my feet will be forever forgotten
No, I will earn this sacrifice
So, let me show you what it is to live.
