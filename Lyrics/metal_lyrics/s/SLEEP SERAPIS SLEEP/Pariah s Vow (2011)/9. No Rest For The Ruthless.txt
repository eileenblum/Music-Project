âSound the alarm, wake the guards
Death does not wait for man nor beast.
They come as the shade of night,
Burning with desire for demise of our pride.

'Relentless, unforgiving, our fate is sealed
By the hands of a heathens- by the hands of liars.
We must pay for what we have done.'â

âTwo seasons ago we marched for purpose, out for justice.
Lead by our hearts in what we were sure was truth. 
Through the gates, house by house, burning it all to the ground.
Leave nothing of this broken town but their entrails for the crows and worms.â

Even liars have truth that slips through the cracks in their teeth.

âNo time for mercy, boy. It's time to be strong.
Your God wants his redemption, but it's going to have to wait till we are done.
Line them up by class, with the rich in the front and the poor in the back.
You can barter with the faint of heart, when your money's only good in the right amount.

Make no mistake, these beggars clothes are lined in silk.
We took everything, spared no one, left them to be forgotten.
But what lied, buried inside, amongst the rotting flesh 
Was a nameless evil that was out for all of us. 

Each soul dispatched by my hands returns for what is theirs
Carve your legacy upon my open chest...
Make haste, take it all back.  Make haste, take it all-â

âSound the alarm, wake the guards 
The deal with death has run its course.
The silence of the bleakest nights
Is broken with the screams of guilty menâ

In pursuit of light we have found nothing but darkness.
In pursuit of light, the shades of its colors reveal us.

Has this ever been more than an alibi for the expansion of an empire? 
The jury's reached a verdict.
We're guilty of our crimes.  Ropes from the gallows swing. 
It seems to call my name:

âHeathens,
Liars!â

As my vision starts to dim like a flame with no oxygen, 
It becomes clear to me this disease will be my end!
