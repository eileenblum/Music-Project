Darkness falls upon this bleak, enveloped estate;
I stare into its blackened antiquity and wait.
Silence is stifling the howling wind at my back;
With emptiness, it echoes upon the ivory black.

Again,

...distress interrupts the whispered still of the night
From beyond the unhinged door, to offer its invite.
âOh, save me!â sounds a plea, a child calls from the debris
As I rush to find and set him free, whatever is his plight.

Tearing through the wreckage, exploring every nook,
His cry resounding louder, upon no visage do I look.
With dead and smiling faces underneath the cracked floorboards,
Thereâs no quarter here for children, nor their restless souls.

In sudden, am I felled by the flooding rapids of death,
Torrentially engulfed, I cherish my last breath.
âOh, save me!â I sound a plea as but a child in a toxic sea:
âSomeone please set me freeâ, in swifter currents am I arrest.

Light shines deep beneath me, a faint glimmer at first.
Then it glows blindingly, for its warmth I begin to thirst.
I swim the chilling shadow, leave that wretched place behind,
For miles washed asunder, unbeknownst of what Iâd find.

Again in anxious beckoning, for the last time he implores.
The lonesome deathly child beseeches me all the more.
âOh, save me,â I hear his plea, and answer it belatedly:
âLay your head and rest in peaceâ, and drew breath like I hadnât afore.
