The rope around her neck pulled taut like the one around her youth
And every once-beloved misled their sight, in horrified untruth
With a torch behind his back, he feigned paternal consolation
No father would let a child have a life like this, so heâd insist she have none

âNow, hold your breath, Scarlet
Drink not in these burning currents
Stay your lungs here, where the sharks prowl.â
A drip of red innocence thins in the black of a merciless sea

âJust you hold your breath, Scarlet.
Youâre too good for this world.â

Drowning deceit in flames, confined
Death is now the only mercy on which she relies
The sky is spinning, not too much longer now
What a welcome release from this world to shut her eyes and never have to see through them again...

I see youâve washed ashen guilt from your hands to indulge in applause,
Without a dry eye for your victim or a selfless pause
So even if you canât, I see you for what you are:
Griever, seer, fiend, you've lost yourself in the char

Hellâs no escape from her pursuit
Until vengeance carves her stillborn heart anew
From within me she imbues,
Eager to breathe in, at long last, the scent of the blood of a father she thought she knew...

âStill, may this reckoning forgive.
And so, forever shall you liveâ¦

For, true suffering needs neither fire nor flood.
Eternally, will consequence be your ever-living Hell.
And when Iâm dead and gone, only the blackest of depths will remember your name.
But when sanity abandons you, mine is the only word your broken mind will think to say:

...Scarletâ

You're too good for this world.
