I stand surrounded and confounded by the holocaust
Of a billion shrieking souls that have all twice been lost
It seems that heavenâs no paradise, but a hellish prison instead
And there isnât a moment of rest for the ruthless dead:

âHear us, heed us!
Mark us, be lost in our call
This is eternityâs offering, our offering
Your rightful place awaitsâ¦
If you'll just scream with us
If you'll just scream with us, your rightful place awaits."

Louder still, as it bears upon us, bones begin to break.
âSurrender now your piteous tongues; in our melody partake,
Oh pious thirst, willing victims first, your mislead courage is but a curse.â
âWeâd rather die with unclouded eyes, than into this nightmare wake.â 

âTo arms, to armsâ¦ â¨
God, save us from our faith in you.â

With this began a bloody wrath upon our mortal lives
A new meaning of despair that no man can survive
Still defiantly we gaze into our Godâs vengeance
As the heavens unveil our unrelenting torments

One by one, these words crept into our 
Hearts and mouths, weâd known them all along
And suddenly, there was no need to fight at all, 
We had already overcome

All too clear was the hatred within
âCome, traitors,â
All too clear was the triumph at hand
âHear us singâ¦
You have forgotten your word,
It is we that forgive you, now.â
