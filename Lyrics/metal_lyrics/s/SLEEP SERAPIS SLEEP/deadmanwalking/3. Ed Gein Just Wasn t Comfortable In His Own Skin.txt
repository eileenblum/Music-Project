Nothingâs wrong with a little wronging now and then,
only to seek a little fortune for myself
If thereâs a better
Time, a better place then you name it; Just know that your obligations arenât the only ones at hand
If thereâs a will
Thereâs a way
And my will be done this way
Your devotion wavers today

Iâll cut you off!
Like fingers or digits or anyone else who didnât think this through
Who didnât think me through?
This is, This is... this is the lust of our likeness
This is the root of your wrath.

You wiped that smile right from my face
So Iâll scrape that face right from itâs skull

I took my time
With this one
I Loved her
Anger-saturated skin

Is this the
Essence of us all?
What have we done?

Oh God, what have we done?

Meow.

Revisit; sanctioned and consensual;
Too much, it seems. Though the morals have changed
What remains familiarity, conceived in this bed
Is 'Whoâs laughing now?', when Iâm right and youâre dead...

Death to the traitor
To the nation of my expectations
Death to the traitor
To the nation... my nation
