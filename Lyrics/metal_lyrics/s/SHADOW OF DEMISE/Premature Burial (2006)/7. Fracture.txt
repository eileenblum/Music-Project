Swing the fist
Cause it to bleed
Fight to scream
No one hears me
Nightmare scene
Pray for a dream
Want to escape
It wonât happen

Left face down
Choke on the mud
Hands of hate
Covered in blood
Hold me back
Say thatâs enough
Final swing
Leaves you motionless

This is what it is when you die
When thereâs no one left to hear you cry
Fear like this you have never ever known
This is what it is when you die alone

Grey
Bleak
Cold
Contemplate homicide
Lose
Control
Permanently damaged end

Fear like this you have never ever known
Fracture skin and bone
