All is well until the day that he died
Taken from his motherâs arms
Carelessness has left him dead to decay
Father is left with the blame
Nightmare figure guides his thoughts to the stones
Somewhere way off in the woods
Solution given to him but hesitates
Knows he can, think he should?

The soil... is sour now
Boy... has rotten through
The soil... is sour now
Boy has rotten through

Take him from his burial crib
To the secret place you found
Evil awaits for another vessel
To be buried in the ground

The soil... is sour now
Boy... has rotten through
The soil... is sour now
Boy has rotten through

Donât come back

Sometimes dead is better
