Believe in Nothing
Trust Less in me
I speak in shadow
No reality
My lies are cancer
without a cure
Just smoke and mirrors
Cry nevermore

You disregard me
and still obey
All that I'm selling
And what I say
Follow so blindly
You are a whore
You should heed warnings
Cry nevermore

Go Farther Down

No want for reason
Or sympathy
I am what I am
No changing me
If you don't like this
Well there's the door
And as you suffer
Cry nevermore

These Lies

Watch with open eyes as I suffer
