Jesus Christ dead and broken
All his useless suffering
His disciples must be joking
Thereâs no reason to die for me

What savior?....not mine
Whoâs savior?...not yours
False savior?.....all lies
Dead savior?.....no more

My God, your God, your God's no God
My God's, the God, your Godâ¦ Dog God

I walk into the house of worship
Burning down all I see
Ask yourself is it worth it?
Praying to what you canât see

What savior?....not mine
Whoâs savior?...not yours
False savior?.....all lies
Dead savior?.....no more

My God, your God, your God's no God
My God's, the God, your Godâ¦Dog God

Dog! God! Dog! God! Dog!
