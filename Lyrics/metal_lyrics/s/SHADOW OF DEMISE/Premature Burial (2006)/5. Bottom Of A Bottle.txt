The way that my life's been
All out to do me in
One shot to numb my brain
Five more just to keep me sane

Drink it down to see what I can find
Hard pressed so I can tow the line
Homicide has once or twice has crossed my mind
Reality distorts when I take a sip

At the bottom of a bottle
Is where my body dies
At the bottom of a bottle
Is where the answer lies

Inside my heart A hole to fill
Carefully poured As not to spill
Still tastes like more So I enbibe
I'm still in need
My question's why

This time I'll make this stick
Too much has made me sick
But I can't so just like before
Line 'em up 'cause I'll be keeping score

Feel the heat as it slides into my veins
Don't give a shit too much so I exclaim
"Fuck the hurt, I'll fight right through the shame"
It's just a shame that the bottle is empty again

Take a good look it's your last one
Time to go home but it's been fun
Stumble outside into the streets
Flat on my ass my night's been sweet

Melody, it's five more beers

At the bottom of a bottle
Is where my body dies
At the bottom of a bottle
Is where the answer lies
