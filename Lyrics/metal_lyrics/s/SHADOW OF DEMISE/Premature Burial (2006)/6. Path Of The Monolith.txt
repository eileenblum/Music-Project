From a 10,000 year sleep, beast awakes from it's prison
No ones ready or even prepared, for this evil that has risen
Sheer sight of this monstrous thing makes your blood run cold as ice
Eyes focused with the anger of years knows his path before he walks it

Dear God we pray to thee we truly feel that we can't stop it
The women cry and the children are scared
Panic grips our minds so tightly
Tell us what we've done to you, that you've sent this walking nightmare
No crime committed by man
But the beast screams out his judgement

I Despise
All of you
No stopping me
When I roll through

Sorrow takes a hold of me The devastations vast in numbers
So many died in the futile attempt to stop a thing that's unrelentless
Reality of the matter is that all of us is part at fault here
Our failure as a race why he's here... He plays no favorites when He's screaming

I Despise
All of you
No stopping me
When I roll through

I am superior
You are inferior
I am superior
You are inferior
