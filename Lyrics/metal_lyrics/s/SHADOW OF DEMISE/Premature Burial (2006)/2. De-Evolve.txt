Throughout all of history
Mankind is based in misery
War and hatred is what we found

As I look around the place
I despise the entire human race
Pray to god that we all fall down

Prepare yourself for the worst
Message that I'm sending
Who the fuck is laughing now
That this world is ending
Take your last look around
Begin the final countdown
'Cause the only way to live is to

Take it back...To the past
De-Evolve

As this world slowly dies
Morbid feast for your eyes
Images that play in your head

Smell the air rife with decay
Burning bodies light the way
Choke on the ashes of the dead

When does it stop?

Throw restrictions to the wind
Forget what they have taught you
Change from man to animal
Fight back what has fought you
Humanity's been burned away
But admit you like it
This is your chance to advance... you must...

Take it back...To the past
De-Evolve

LAST STOP!!!

I am no longer a man
I am now a monster
I'm in your room late at night
I'll be
WAITING WATCHING!!!
For you to close your eyes asleep
So begins the feeding
I am complete in my change
I will...

Take it back...To the past
De-Evolve
