Cover my body in thick muddy grey
Stealing my form and my shape
Price of addiction is too high to pay
Realizing this is too late
Pulsating matter replaces my flesh
Transform me into this sludge
Use of my eyesight is taken from me
Limbs legs and arms they wonât budge (they won't budge)

What have I become
What is this plan for me that I must suffer so miserably?

Hideous sight congealed human skin
Abomination to this world
Locked him away from the curious eyes
Deviation is controlled
Chaos theory dictates the ending of this foul destructive self
Dividing itâs cells for mass infection covering us all in this hell (god help us)

What have I become
What is this plan for me that I must suffer so miserably?

Shapeless
