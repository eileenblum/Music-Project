[Twisted Sister cover]

Are you afraid of things that go bump in the night?
Behind closet doors are things when you turn out the light
Don't be afraid of the night, there's a light in the dark burning bright
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid of the light

Come inside our world, an oyster 'round a pearl
You'll all be safe inside, a perfect place to hide, you'll see
Fun by decree
Ride above the storm, the average and the norm
A newfound ecstasy, a wild fantasy come true
This one's for you
Oh, welcome to our show
Oh, welcome to our life
Just follow me and you'll set yourself free
Now won't you come out and play

Come out and play, come on out and play
Come out and play, come on out and play
Come out and play, come on out and play
Come out and play, come on out and play

Join our cavalcade, enter the world you made
We're only here for you to do what you won't do, you know
On with the show
A place where fallacy becomes reality
We'll spin your head around, we're programmed to astound, stand by
Prepare to fly
Oh, welcome to our show
Oh, welcome to our life
Just follow me and you'll think that you're free
Now won't you come out and play
Come out and play, come on out and play
Come out and play, come on out and play
Come out and play, come on out and play
Come out and play, come on out and play
