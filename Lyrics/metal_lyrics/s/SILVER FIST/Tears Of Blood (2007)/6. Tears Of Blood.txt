You go out like every morning
A morning just like any other
Already become part of your routine
You don't know if you come back

You think if it is worth the price
Waking up once again
Listen to the news, imploring and praying
There is no other yesterday

There is people lying on the ground
see lives flying away
Lives that somebody took away from them
And no one will return them back

Powerlessness
Destruction
Innocence
Execution

You wish you could end it all
Heal over everybody's wounds
Not a drop of blood anymore
No more need to fight

You will cry,tears of blood and anger
You will feel, fury and terror
You'll suffer, the heaven knows well about it
You will wish,you die
So that you won't stand the pain

You plead to the God of Men
To make stop the violence
From whom the white hands splatter with blood
Using His name as an excuse

Your friends and family have fallen
Your turn's gonna be tomorrow maybe
Won't even mind to be the first to go
If the end at last was meant to be

Fanaticism
Obsession
Annihilation
No reason

Feel afflicted
A conflict without solution
