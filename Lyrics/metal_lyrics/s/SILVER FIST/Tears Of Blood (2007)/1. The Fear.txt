Like dead man walking
I can feel the dark
A malevolent force is holding fast

Just like another torture I
Can feel the Evil
From the deepest inside slavering me

Under domination
When there's no way to escape
I'm a puppet enjoying its fate

Bullying and putting me down
Origin of pain
Manipulates me, show my weaknesses

Want to be me
And losing all control
No will of mine
Able to kill

Fear is into my soul
Fear is into my mind
And also fear of the dark

Fear when thinking of life
Fear when thinking of death
Even more of waking up

What I aspire to
Is being brave

Fear is into my soul
Fear is into my mind
Terrified by solitude

Fear when thinking of life
Fear when thinking of death
When facing reality

Fear is getting hold of
Fear is surrounding me
Making me delirious

Fear is into my soul
Fear is into my mind
I don't wanna walk away

Fear when thinking of life
Fear when thinking of death
And never see you again
