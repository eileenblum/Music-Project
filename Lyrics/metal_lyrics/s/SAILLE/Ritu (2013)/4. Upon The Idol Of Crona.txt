Ride on backs of goats
lured by glory
towards the home of Nol
to pledge our allegiance

We are nighthaunts, they say
for we thieve at night
we murder and pillage
and we conspire
against the state and clergy

I abjure god
and the holy mother
And I make vow
an unbreakable oath
to Satan

Ride

Drink
a strange old brew
a method for bonding
that makes us so
delirious
that makes of us
buckriders

In blackest of nights
we flock together
in houses and caves
that spawn fear in the bravest
Our rites are unholy
our future looks poorly
but our loyalty has rarely been seen

Christum Jesum ich Absage
und dem teufel falle zu
Christi mutter von mir jage
jetz frey morden stehen thu

I abjure christbastard
and the holy whore
and I pledge
allegiance
to Satan

Over huis, over tuin, over staakâ¦
En dat tot Keulen in de wijnkelderâ¦

Ride

An oath is sworn
upon the idol
of Crona
and of saint-michael
the trampler
