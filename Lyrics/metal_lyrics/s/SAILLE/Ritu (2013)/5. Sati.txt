I
I have lost
whatâs closest
to my heart

In this woeful hour
Iâve chosen
to lay myself upon her pyre
For nothing
but sadness remains
Self-immolation
not unlike Dakshayaniâs act
for brighter future
and reunification

Sati

I wish to be consumed
by these merciless flames
With you
For all is meaningless without

Creeping on your burial pyre
Sleeping beside what will again be mine
My love
