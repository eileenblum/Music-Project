Cha-Chaac

Ages of drought
call forth a necessity
of death by water
Sacrifice to pleasure the raingod

Chaac

For thee, Cha-Chaac
I pledge my life

I accept my path
that runs down these slopes
down the Holy Snake
to the sacrificial pit

Bolon Dzacab
As Hunac Ceel will jump from this spot one day
so will I
in attempt to please the gods

But unlike him
my life is forfeit
and for my people
my flame too will fade

Where others have fallen before their time
this cenote
my resting place

Bolon Dzacab

As I watch the water come closer
a smile on my face begins to form

And should I return
from woeful pond
I have received
blessings scarcely given

For thee
Cha-Chaac
I pledge my life
