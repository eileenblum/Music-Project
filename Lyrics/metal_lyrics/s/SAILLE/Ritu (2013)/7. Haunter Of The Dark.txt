In shadows I once dwelled
driven wild by curiosity
It was then that I uncovered
the Shining Trapezohedron

I summoned the Haunter of the Dark
from across the black gulfs of chaos
Haunter of the dark

âI have seen the dark universe yawning
Where the black planets roll without aim
Where they roll in their horror unheeded
Without knowledge or lustre or nameâ

Only light keeps it at bay
so I fear the dark of night
for it knows where I reside
and it will consume me

I see it â coming here
hell-wind â titan blue â black wing
Yog Sothoth save me
the three-lobed burning eyeâ¦
