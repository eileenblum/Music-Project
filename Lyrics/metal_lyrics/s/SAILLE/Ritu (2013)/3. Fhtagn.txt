Phânglui mglwânafh
Cthulhu Râlyeh

Wgahânagl
Fhtagn

Night as black as shoggoth-mass
The stars are right, we realize
The stars are right for hellish mass
Cthulhu from your sleep arise
Lord of depths and maddening fright
We worship thee, we worship thee
Râlyeh, rise back to the light
Escape thy slumber from the sea

Hail Hastur, hail Azathoth
Shub-Niggurath and Yog Sothoth
Hail Great Old Ones that stand for nought
But chaos that their presence brought
For now we summon on this night
For mankindâs fall, for once and all
The lord of depths and maddening fright
For we have heard Cthulhuâs call

Ia! Ia!
Cthulhu fhtagn
Ia! Ia!
Death and despair awaits mankind
Ia! Ia!
Cthulhu fhtagn
Ia! Ia!
When at last the stars are aligned

Ia sakkath
Iak sakkakh
Ia sha xul
Ia sha xul

And we scream blasphemous chants
From cold planes to seas of sand
For thy coming is now at hand
And we scream blasphemous chants
