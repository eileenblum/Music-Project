Brethren, lend thy ear
listen to my tale
How I discovered
the secrets of runes
I hung for nine full nights
on the windswept tree
Sacrificed to Odin
Myself to myself

Depraved of water
and bread for strength
Pierced by a spear
hangs the one-eyed

This son of Bestla and Borr
threefold the highest is he
Tyr of the hanged man
Ruler of Asgard

Father to the slayer of giants
Once gave his eye, a sacrifice
so he might drink from Mimirâs well
to master poetry and wisdom

There I hung from Yggdrasilâs branch
Reached for the runes and screamed with all my might
Suffered for wisdom, fell from the tree
Magic of runes, strong and stout staves
Fell from the tree
Fell from the tree
The highest of Aegir
that in Asgard dwell

But with this wisdom
come frightful visions
of the sailing of Naglfar
And Lokiâs son
unchained at last
marching in Surtrâs wake

For the gods are doomed
once the branches burn
