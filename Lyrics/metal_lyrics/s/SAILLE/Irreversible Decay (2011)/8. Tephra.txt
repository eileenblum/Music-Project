The heaven erupts and vapors iginite

Black rain falls down
Covering the shortcomings of our doomed mankind
Dark clasts rain down
Silencing the voices of a global failed sect

Clastic clouds rage down from the summit
A hazardous flow, evolutions surge

Into ash, mud and rock
Broken by fire
Descend into darkness

Expanding for more than thousand miles
While droplets obscure the light of the sun

A never-ending volcanic winter
Cold will conquer us all

An unusual climate aberration
Results into famine, death and despair
Eighteen hundred and froze to death
And brown snow will fall
Obscuring the new summers

No one stays behind in this new aged world
Tephra! Salvation from the earth!
