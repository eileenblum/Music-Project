Hidden signs were everywhere
Ill presages of doom
Messengers of peril
Which malice was to come ?

Ravens descended
To proof the left-hand path
The presence of a smokeless spark
The age of Erebos !

Slowly light fades
Our minds are choked by endless fog

We tried to prevent this coming
The bear has been buried
All rituals performed
But all whatâs left is despair

An eerie gloom remained
Our lives are choked by endless fog
Apatic and undone

S e seo an oidhche thug dhuinn ar dÃ²chas,
seo an oidhche mun cluinn gach deÃ²raidh,
Oidhchâ thug teÃ rnadh o bhÃ s bu beÃ² dhuinn

Ravens descended in the west
To proof the left-hand path
The presence of a smokeless spark
The age of Erebos !

Slowly light began to fade
Only an endless night remained
A cloak of warm empathic shade
