History repeats
Through sudden apprehension
Cold pain, biting sweat
Without an indication

Pandemia proceeds firmly
Slowly delirium spreads
Everyone contagious
The fourth plague has begun

The double helix entwined
Cells decay from inside
Recovery absent
The big sleep almost instant

âFloat to the lightâ
âDetach yourselfâ
âBe the lightâ
âBe the lightâ

âMy time has comeâ
âLet me beâ
âLock me upâ
âLeave me behindâ
âI am uselessâ

History repeats
Through sudden apprehension
Cold pain, biting sweat
Without an indication

The population decimated
Mass graves bulging
Doomed perspectives
Of a sudden end

âCivilisation should start againâ
âWeâll never succeedâ
âWe always willâ
âThe plague will returnâ
âWeâll be immuneâ
âWe never willâ
