âAnd the same hour was there a great earthquake,
And the tenth part of the city fell,
And in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand
And the remnant were affrighted,
And gave glory to the God of heavenâ

And hell where revolution unties
The shattered sound of golden trumpets
Glorify the coming of war

In the name of the Lord we seek repentance
And strife for our word to be the truest
A crusade against the unworthy
Preaching death above life

Throughout ages men is known
For his craving for power
And will to be the only one
Weâre all equally less
And mean nothing in this vast world
