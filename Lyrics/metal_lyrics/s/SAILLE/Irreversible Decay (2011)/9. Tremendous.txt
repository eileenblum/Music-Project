They form a cluster !
A swarm of harmonic destruction
caused by earthâs core
The endless waves of surface
reshape the crust and will â de â stroy
every resistance

Weâre in the seismic shade
Thereâs time to rest
Living in constant fear
The fear of death

Fear
Earthâs
Rage
Brace yourself

For the next collision
Of inner plates

Everything has been fragmented
to its essence, its core foundation

Only some winged survived
Scavengers flourished
Feasting on spread remains
Awaiting their mythic kindred

To summon all before the throne
