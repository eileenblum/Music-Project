Born out of envy, a quest to the Well of Urd, to outshine the power of the Norns and gather the knowledge of the runes. It was there that I hung on a windy tree for nine long nights, wounded by a spear, given to Odin myself to myself, on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run. A god unto a god, an ultimate ordeal and a semi death. 

Further tales speak of Mimirâs well, where I asked for a drink in exchange for an eye. Trading one form of perception for another and thereby to forever be known as one-eyed. But no sacrifice can be too big. Through this I gained cosmic knowledge, what has come to pass, and what is yet to be.

Foreknowledge of loss and pain. And the promise of a hunt, when the Twilight of the Gods at last arrives!
