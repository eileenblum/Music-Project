Prometheus Plasticator! 
Create us! Mould us! Under the goddessâ inspiration, may you mix Kinguâs blood with earth, let it be clay and form to house our wandering essence. Then command Phtiaâs king to protect us from the flood, which serves to eradicate Lycaonâs kin and all of mankind! 

Prometheus Pyrophorus! 
One of seven titans! Set the world ablaze! First by ways of knowledge, a most holy Luciferian delight, later by torch, a possession of the divine, lit at the fiery chariot of the sun itself! 

Prometheus martyr!  1.000, 30 or 30.000 years. 
Weâll keep the fire burning.

The fire burning!
