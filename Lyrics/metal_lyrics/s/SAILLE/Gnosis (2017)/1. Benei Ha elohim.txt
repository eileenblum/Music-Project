Benei haâElohim! Once dreamt by the Destroyer of Nations, 
and once regarded highly amongst those of spiritual nature! Should we consider you fallen? 

Samyaza, great instigator, a more honest cause could there not have been, acts of rebellion in the name of love and lust!
And Azazel, great scapegoat, why should we consider your gifts poisoned? 

The Nephilim!

Children of fornication, of when the Sons of God came unto the daughters of men! Giants consumed, bloodshed commenced, all against all. And earth turned into a charnel house of love. Now the Lord of Heaven has deemed it necessary for men to perish.

We shall die the death, an end of all flesh.
Alas! The great flood is coming!
