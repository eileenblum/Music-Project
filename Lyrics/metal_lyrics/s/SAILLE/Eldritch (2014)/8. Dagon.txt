I'a Dagon! I'al sacred Mother Hydra!
The time has come for me to take the secret oaths!
A first oath of faith, a second oath of servitude
A third oath of procreation. Our bloodlines, forever mingled

And I shall gladly rid myself of my human shell

A first oath of secrecy, a second oath confirms my subjugation
A final oath promises the continuation of your bloodline

In thy name let us behold, the father who inhabits the depths beyond the Devil's Reef!

Depths that I've haunted in feverish dreams
Hail to the ancient dreams!

The Esoteric Order of Dagon, the only way to enlightenment
Through it I discovered past, present, future and the fate of mankind
Not a fate that will be fulfilled on land
The true evolution lies under the waves

In thy name let us behold the father
From the depths of the water I come and from the depths
The Deep ones also have come!
Hail to the ancient dreams! Hail to Dagon!

Through black abysses, to Cyclopean and many-columned Y'ha-nthlei
â¦and in the lair of the deep ones we'll dwell, amidst wonder and glory forever!
