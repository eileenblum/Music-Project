Will-o-the wisp, don't glad about on Brocken's summit you'll lead our way
For I'm the master of this place and I will blow your lantern out
We'll now attend Walpurgis night, experience lust on a higher level
We'll mix with daughters of the devil, depraved bodies of such delight

And fire, such fire!
Its beauty unmatched
A glorious prelude to Satan's arrival

Dies Irae, dies illa
Solvet Saeclum in favilla
Judex ergo cum sedebit
Quidquid latet adparebit

Nil inultum remanebit
Quid sum miser tunc dicturus?
Quem patronum rogaturus?
Cum vix justus sit securus

[English translation:
Day of wrath and terror looming
Heaven and earth to ash consuming
Then the judge will sit, revealing
Every hidden thought and feeling

Unto each requitel dealingâ¦
What shall wretched I be crying?
To what friend for succour flying
When the just in fear are sighing?]

He speaks in tongues and yet they understand
Of he-goats and she-goats, of phallus and cunts
They bow at his altar, give ear to his words and kiss his backside
Vassals: good and true

"I don't know what they're stewing and brewing.
A witches' coven. Ride on! Ride on!"

Ad Majorem Satanae Gloriam!
