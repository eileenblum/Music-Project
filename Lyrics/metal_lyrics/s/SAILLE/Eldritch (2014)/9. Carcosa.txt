Along the shore the cloud waves break
The twin suns sink beneath the lake
The shadows lengthen in Carcosa

Strange is the night where black stars rise
And strange moons circle through the skies
But stranger still is Lost Carcosa

Songs that the Hyades shall sing
Where flap the tatters of the King
Must die unheard in Dim Carcosa

Song of my soul, my voice is dead
Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
Shall dry and die in Lost Carcosa
