I have seen her transform from woman to man
From man to beast and from beast to worse:
The daughter of Eve and Pan

A spawn of nature, amoral at its core
Surpasses concepts of good and evil

...and still I witnessed pure darkness in her eyes
She took every ounce of joy from my life

I have seen the great god Pan!
Witnessed its true form, neither man nor beast
Aaaargh! I have seen Pan!
Left me corrupted, both body and soul!

Should we realize the horrors that lay lurking
Through the cracks in the walls that protect our world
And the shadows in the cave of our perception
With an origin of pure malevolence

And the shadows in the cave of our perception are breathing pure malevolence

And still I witnessed pure darkness in her eyes
She took every ounce of joy from my life
Aaaargh! Lost, never to be regained

Even though we're convinced that knowledge equals power
there is comfort in not knowing the shadow's origin
Often ignorance is the greatest bliss
