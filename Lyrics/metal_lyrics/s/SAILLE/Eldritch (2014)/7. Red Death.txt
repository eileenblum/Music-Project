Welcome, my honored guests
Please enter these chambers
And rid yourselves of somber thought
For this plague has been locked outside these walls
That lowly peasants will find impossible to breach.
We'll feast throughout the months
And let decadence carry us away
While death reigns outside

A feast to lighten the mood.
Such frivolity and joy! Oh, it suits this place
One chamber for every sin.
We indulge ourselves, in the pleasures of this earthly life
But the sounding of the clock
Reminds us of the fragility of our mortality

An unwanted stranger appeared!
His aura foreboding. He's here, he's here!
A red masked stranger appeared!
His aura foreboding. He's here, he's here!

An unwanted stranger appeared!
His aura foreboding. He's here, he's here!

Behold red death's mask
He entered our sanctuary like a thief in the night
No nobleman, landlord or king will be safe
From these cold hands, so eager to snuff out our lives
