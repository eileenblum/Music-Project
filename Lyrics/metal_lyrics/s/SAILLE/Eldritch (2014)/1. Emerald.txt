A single word was written: "Rache!"

Tyrants have arisen from the seas
And descended from the stars
An ancient royalty returned
To what is their rightful dominion

The most complete form of submission

We embraced their domination
As if we ever had a choice
We have our freedom, as long as they will it
We have our minds, as long as they permit it

All hail the new royalty!
All hail the old royalty!

They will feast upon the minds of the innocent
'Till there's nothing left but skin and pit

There is a price that we must pay for peace and prosperity
All it takes is two blind eyes to deny our impending doom
Our doom!

Tyrants have arisen from the seas
And descended from the stars

Yet this might still be the better of evils
For there's something stirring in the east
