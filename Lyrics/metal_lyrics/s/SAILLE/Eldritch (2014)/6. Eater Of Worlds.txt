If you were ever to witness my true form
You'd find your sanity shattered to pieces
For I am evil incarnate, manifestation of nightmares

I am the eater of worlds and my hunger is endless

And since I'm eternal I will not stop 'til all is consumed
'Til nothing remains, 'til all flesh is ripped and the last fear is drained

Let my disguises fool you into believing,
That joy and happiness lie just around the corner
Ignore the faint, rotten stench that you might smell
And instead focus on the promises of laughter

And there will be laughter!
Yes, there will be laughter

"He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts."

Stare into my deadlights and behold my true form
I couldn't care less for your well-being

For I am driven by an endless hunger for fear and flesh
...by an endless hunger for fear and flesh

That which was old when the earth was young...
That of which horrible songs were sung...
Deeply ingrained in this here soilâ¦
Since long a part of us

Stare into my deadlights and behold my true form
The flesh tastes better when you're scared
