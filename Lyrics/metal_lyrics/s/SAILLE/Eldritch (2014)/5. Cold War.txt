Here we areâ¦
Here we'll discover which one, one of us, is not what he seems

We brought it upon ourselves, by touching what shouldn't be touched
And unearthing what should have been left to rest
Some secrets should remain buried

It came from another sun, a star beyond stars, from a world with a bluer sun.
(But) now it dwells here, unleashed from its ice-cold cell
With no other purpose then to procreate.

There is no co-existence
If it survives, we die
Unprophesied extinction

Shape shifting horror, awoken from your catacomb
Buried for millions of years
In the shadows of these cursed mountains of madness
May your kingdom never come
