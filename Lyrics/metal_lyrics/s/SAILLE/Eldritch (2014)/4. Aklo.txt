It was revealed to me, in darkest of nights, amidst the filth
the heirs to the mongrels that once crowded these streets
At the Red Hook, where the stench of murder still reeks
Of infants young; mere lambs for the slaughter

I've been shown, been told, been made to feel the Ur-Syntax
The glory of AKLO
This knowledge mends and shatters my brain
Pure clarity! Fhtagn no longer!

WZA-Y'EI!
DHO-HNA!
YR NHHNGR!

"It's the end and the beginning. He's beneath the waters now, but soon, in (only) a few months, he will come forthâ¦ and until then he sleepsâ¦ and until then he sleeps and dreams."

I too have been shown it's ways, in a city so old, guided by the crawling chaos
He showed me the error that one finds in interpretation, and the terror that lies ahead

"Nyarlathotep!"
That is not dead which can eternal lie

I've been shown the nature of (the) seed inside this womb
And the future of ill-fated mankind
Of aeons that are yet to come.
The time is nigh
How strange those times will be!
