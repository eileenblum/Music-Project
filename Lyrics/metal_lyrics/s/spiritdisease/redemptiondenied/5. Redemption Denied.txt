Adolescent deflowered and defiled.
Butchered innocence - a childhood denied.

Raped and tortured as the clergymen smiled.
In the name of god victimized and brutalized.
The day of retribution has now arrived.
A vengeance with wrath just like the child fantasized.

There will be no salvation.
There will be no redemption.

Murder, mayhem, massacre - redemption denied.
Torment, carnage, semen - redemption denied.

Mutilated and exterminated and excreted upon.
Strewn on the altar the remains of all but one.
Nailed to the cross, like his savior he died.
A righteous punishment by the child brutalized.

There will be no salvation.
There will be no redemption.

Murder, mayhem, massacre - redemption denied.
Torment, carnage, semen - redemption denied.

[solo]

Annihilated and mutilated.
Excreted and ejaculated upon.
Exterminated and defiled.
Excreted and ejaculated upon.

There will be no salvation.
There will be no redemption.

Murder, mayhem, massacre - redemption denied.
Torment, carnage, semen - redemption denied.
