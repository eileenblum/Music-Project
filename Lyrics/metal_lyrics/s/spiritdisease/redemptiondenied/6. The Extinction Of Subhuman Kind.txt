Corpses all around us, we bathe in blood.
War and destruction has now begun.
Hearing their screams excites us even more.
Time to crush our enemies in this final war.

War! Sweet war!
The extinction of subhuman kind!

We maim and maul, mangle and destroy.
We kill again, we use them as cheap toys.
The battle continues until all of them are crushed.
We'll destroy the entire race of subhuman cunts.

War! Sweet war!
The extinction of subhuman kind!

All hail the extinction!
Extinction!
Extinction!

Corpses all around us, we bathe in blood.
Death and destruction has now begun.

War! Sweet war!
The extinction of subhuman kind!
