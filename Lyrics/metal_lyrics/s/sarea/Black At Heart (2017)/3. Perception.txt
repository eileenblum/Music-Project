Endless search for tranquility
A vast image of what used to be
Only to find, it was all in my mind
A hopeless quest for prosperity
I'm drowning,
Help me find a way to the shore
Pretending, how much can we endure?

So let us wander into darkness
Blinded by our own beliefs
Let us cross these shallow waters

Try to deny the inevitable
We sink to our demise
Help me find a way to the shore
Be my pillar, be my core
The more we fight it, the weaker we get
Filling the surface with our blood and sweat
Let us drown in silence, hand in hand

Will I ever find salvation?
Can you save me from myself?
I need to know
Will you be my liberation
And save me from myself?
Don't let me go

Motionless the tide rolls in
With no direction, do we sink or swim?
No path to follow, no tomorrow
The surface is never there
I'm drowning,
Help me find a way to the shore
Pretending, how much can we endure?

Don't let me go
