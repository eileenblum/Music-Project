The sharpest thorn in my side
I flail at the bushes around me
And all I get in return
Is more of the same old pain
Believe me I tried to escape
A sick mind in a healthy body
Black veils close around me

I can see it now
All around
This cloud of apathy
I need some synergy
To remember
Who you were
Who I should be
Still lack in sympathy

Brought up to stay my ground
Always question without a doubt
And now you see me for what I become
A child of society
One in a million, that's not me
A narcissistic ego child
With money on my mind

Give me the strength
To carry this burning torch
To light your fire in every soul
Ann Marie
