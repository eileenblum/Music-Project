I've carved your pictures on my walls
A scent of someone else under control
Ask not what I want you all to do
The stench is heavy, overwhelming
I filled this room with heavy fumes
Now it's time for you to start this chant
Silence, suffocate

Farewell to all those pretty lies
Farewell to who we are
My conscience will not burden me
Dead eyes is all they ever see

Picked apart, piece by piece
I vow to hurt you, I will haunt you
I'll make sure you cannot breath
Systematic, cynical
Remember not to come too close
Overdose, overdose

The voices in your head,
They'll never let you go
Farewell to who we are
