Perpetuate
The shelters in your life
Discriminate
The people that you fight
Subjugate
Yourself in every way
Consummate
There's no time left to wait

All you'll ever know
And all you'll ever see is greed
Staring back at you

Retaliate,
Make sure they stay down
Resuscitate
And start all over again

Every time we speak
In every word we hear
Our true identity is revealed

Neo fascist hate,
Don't let it get to you
Cultivate yourself in every way

A loss of all conditions
This frantic love to hate
We build ourselves anew
Eye for and eye
And tooth for a tooth
