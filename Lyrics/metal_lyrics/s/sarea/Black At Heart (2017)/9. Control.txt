And so I wake up
Believing my own head
Is now against me
The words that passed my lips
Were never meant
For you to hear
And now I'm sorry
I've said enough,
I've lost control

Again
Will it ever stop?
Can I find a place
Where I control myself?
Is it over now?
Do I have what it takes,
To be in control?

I've made it clear
I need to help myself
Before I try to mend you
This is real, my vision is nothing
Action speak louder than words
I hate my normal state
My incoherent distorted face

Incomplete
My head is filled with thoughts
I need to speak
I've said enough,
I've lost control again
