Never thought that I would see you
Spread all this shit
You despicable person, you make me feel sick
As a kid growing up you had nothing to say
Now you try to pretend like
You've been awake all these years
You're a coward with nothing to say to the world
Do us a favor and go back to sleep

Oh shallow void, feed on a vagabond soul
Scourged by life, is this forever?
Walk the mile, consciousness, a burden
Black at heart, this is forever

So, you drown in your mind
Hollow and broken
You are what you do, no excuses
Only what's done is true

Break the silence, spit it out
Face the world you lived without

The only way, a structured way of pain
Countless aeons, the art of being perfect
The resistance, the blockade, the great wall
A blackened art, the art of being perfect

Unveiled, unbroken, lived without
