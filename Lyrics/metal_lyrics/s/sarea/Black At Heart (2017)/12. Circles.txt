This factory built you up from the ground
Human atrocities will fulfill you
Why do all things come to this?
Benevolent beings

Scared of what lies beneath the ashes
Scared of what lies beneath the ashes
Coming up short again

I beat you up, I bring you down
I give you everything you never wanted
That is all I've been given
I told you once, I told you twice
I told you everything will be forgotten
That is all you've been given

Today we walk around in circles
Our heads are hanging down
Don't you wish it all could end today?
Life is so meaningless, pointless anyway

This slipstream war will end us all
We gather troops, we won't recall

I perfected the silence
To be heard by the masses we applaud
This gift I blame on you all
For being so mechanic in your thoughts
I wage this war
Crucified by your thoughts
I stand against you all
I wage this war
