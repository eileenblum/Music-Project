Break out
The sickness spreads and we rejoice
The fall of government is how we come to life

The horror, the colour
Our future is bright
Inception, redemption
Multiply before we starve

And so it begins
The culling, the rapture
The total loss of hope

Now we hold on to what we used to know
We lack the means to grow
We are so cold, lacking the will to push
Something's gotta give

There are people hanging from the trees
You see the people taking pictures,
You believe

You've seen it all by now
We have no self-control
The dormant national sophisticated whore

False control, sense of hope
Calls you out, shows your throat
