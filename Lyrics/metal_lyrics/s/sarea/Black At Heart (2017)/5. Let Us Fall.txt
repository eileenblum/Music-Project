Here I am,
I feel it burning from the inside
Here we stand, we watch the world
Crash on the outside

Never thought on looking back
Never once had no regrets
Let us fall into forever

Let us fall into the night
Let our hearts light up the sky
Let us fall into forever
Still we can't believe
Though we make believe
This is meant to be
This is everlasting
Let us fall into forever

Here I am,
I can't promise not to hurt you again
Here we stand
Face to face, face the world
On towards brighter suns,
Bigger schemes
Broken dreams, no more

Let us fly
Let us fall
Let us drown, into infinity

Your life begins to fade
Come close or stay away
Wake up, wake up
