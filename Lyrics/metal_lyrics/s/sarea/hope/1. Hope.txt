I FUCKING TOLD YOU
NOT TO QUESTION ME
DON'T SECOND GUESS ME
Your life is violence,
it corners you
It's dragging us down
Can you see it's a dream
A mirage

DON'T BELIEVE
You seek justice, You're so naive
You think you're better, better than me?

We hope for something better
We dream of things to come
Today is not forever but I could be wrong

Surrounded by walls I need to break
Vision is blurred, constant headache
I've been here before I'm sure
But nothing stays the same

Damnation this jester sees your soul
He comes from a broken home
A puppet ready to fall
Now faces takes it's toll
