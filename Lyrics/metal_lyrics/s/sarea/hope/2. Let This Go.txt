[Bonus Track]Is this the end now tell me.
Oh please just tell me.
I need to know, was this for show.
Can't let this go.

Oh how I adore you.
How I want more.
How I adore your soul.
Was it that hard to let this go?

We decided long ago no one will ever know.
How you caught your tail.
How you ask?
I don't know!

Is it over, I don't know.
But I just can't let this go.
Let this go!

About time I surrender?
I say never!
I won't let go.
Still want to know.
Can't let this go.

No more sweet surrender.
I blame myself.
Giving up was easy, the hardest part was letting go.

We decided long ago no one will ever know.
How you caught your tail.
How you ask?
I don't know!

Is it over, I don't know.
But I just can't let this go.
Is it over, I don't know.
But I just can't let this go.

Tell me I need to know.
Let this go?

Let this go.
Let this go!

I don't know!
Is it over, I don't know.
But I just can't let this go.
Is it over, I don't know.
But I just can't let this go.

Tell me I need to know.
Is it time to let this go?!

Let this go?
Let this go!
