Language spoken through eyes of "the righteous" 
Hateful it spreads in the lair of the liars 
serpent world, cynic minds - they want under your skin 

You want the truth - there's no truth to be found 
the logic in your mind is the only thing divine 

When you don't see you're slowly infected 
It's like poison through your mind 
There's never truth enough to sort the lies 


You want the truth - there's no truth to be found 
the logic in your mind is the only thing divine 

Opposition, strike it down!
Decades of ruin behind 

Going beyond where you hide youself 
Insides out, revealing your secrecy 
After all, your truth shall vanish when you lay down to die 

You want the truth - there's no truth to be found 
the logic in your mind is the only thing divine 

Opposition, strike it down!
Decades of ruin behind
