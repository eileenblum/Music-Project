Through a fog of ice 
Our breathing almost can't get through 
A frostborn path to lead us 
Freezing hands turn into one 

Sacred road blessed in snow 
Light's reflecting landscape's beauty 

Destiny is at hand 
We won't cry those tears of ice 
No regrets as winter's all around 
Sun will wash those sins away 

Shivering moves in winterland 
Steam's drawing the sight 
Forbidden world of ice 
To passionate the wild 

Freezing skin at melting point 
Blood is boiling in the cold 

Destiny is at hand 
We won't cry those tears of ice 
No regrets as winter's all around 
Sun will wash those sins away 

Through a fog of ice 
Our breathing almost can't get through 
A frostborn path to lead us 
Freezing hands turn into one 

Sacred road blessed in snow 
Light's reflecting landscape's beauty 

Destiny is at hand 
We won't cry those tears of ice 
No regrets as winter's all around 
Sun will wash those sins away
