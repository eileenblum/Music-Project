Here you lay, waiting for the end to come 
Shadow of your former self 
Entering a lifeless slumber, nothing left but pain 
Eyes are fading soon 

This moment cannot be denied 
final hours of your dying breathe 
body twists from a cold down your spine 
heart freezes over as time passes you by 

clear inside your mind but your time has come 
Eternal sleep awaits you now 

Disappear, you have faced your last dawn 
too tired to breathe anymore 
volcano inside, you know the end is near 
there's chaos in your eyes 

This moment cannot be denied 
final hours of your dying breathe 
body twists from a cold down your spine 
heart freezes over as time passes you by 

clear inside your mind but your time has come 
Eternal sleep awaits you now
...awaits you now
