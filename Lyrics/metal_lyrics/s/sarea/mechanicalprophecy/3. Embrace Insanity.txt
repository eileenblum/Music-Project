The last thing you know they're taking control of your life 
What it is - the end of a dream 
Snaps and bite, crushing, melting, nightmare in motion 
Children of the mastermind, destroying their maker 
What they are -  end of all, final destruction 

The source that you knew has blinded you 
What you've always trusted (has betrayed you) 

Embrace Insanity 
Everyone who is truly alive 
Embrace Insanity 
Our contribution to our our bane 

Don't you look for answers now, 
your life is left behind 
dust and bones is all that's left - An emperor is rising 
population of the world enslaved by invention 
once you know, the signs will show - war is yet only sleeping 

Our time is short, is running out 
We've got no time to spare 

The source that you knew has blinded you 
What you've always trusted (has betrayed you) 

- Humanity enslaved, my captives for all eternity 
- NO! 

The source that you knew has blinded you 
What you've always trusted (has betrayed you) 

Embrace Insanity 
Everyone who is truly alive 
Embrace Insanity 
Living inside the birth of our bane
