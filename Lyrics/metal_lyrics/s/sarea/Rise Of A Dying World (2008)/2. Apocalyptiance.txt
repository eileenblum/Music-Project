Standing here in the nuclear winter
Obsessed by you, searching all over
The world is falling apart around me
Where are you now, in my last hours?
Where are you now?

The fire is swallowing me alive
Inferno all around me, time is running out

Let me die smiling, knowing you know
I won't rest until you know

The end has come to get us
Falling by the hands of our creation
I'm still alive, searching for you
Where are you now, in my last hours?
Where are you now?

The fire is swallowing me alive
Inferno all around me, time is running out

Let me die smiling, knowing you know
I won't rest until you know
