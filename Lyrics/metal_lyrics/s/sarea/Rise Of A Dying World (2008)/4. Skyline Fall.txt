No matter where you've been, or whereever you may go
All the words once written shall come true
Scrolls from the past or cynics of today
There comes a time when all shall vanish and die

In the sky I connect with the universe beyond
Balance disrupted, implosions of fire

Watch the stars fade out
As our heaven's falling down

This world is all we know, mother of all life
Ruling with an iron will, reaching our demise
Evolution means dividing and multiplying
Man is nothing but a lifeform inside a circle

In the sky I connect with the universe beyond
Balance disrupted, implosions of fire

Watch the stars fade out
As our heaven's falling down

When Tellys was born - beginning of the end
When Tellus was born - rise and fall of man

Watch the stars fade out
As our heaven's falling down
Skyline fall - the end
