This is the rise of the beginning
A new dawn, the last light we'll see
It has been here all along
It was just a matter of time before

Light the world with my fire now
The end of earth is here

Volcanian sun, rise to shine, to devour
The beautiful irony, now we see the light

Those who seek the peace and calm
Are the same that rage into war
Of all the prophecies that man has set
The one of our demise will come true

Light the world with my fire now
The end of earth is here

Volcanian sun, rise to shine, to devour
The beautiful irony, now we see the light

Now we see the light...
