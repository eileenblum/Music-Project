Given life of mortal flesh
Blessed with unhuman might
Life amongst the living dead
This curse I cannot fight

I transform, I declare war...

...against the fools unaware
Don't try to sleep I'll be there
To hunt you down again
Evilution knows no remorse

Am I cursed with genious,
or am I struck by bless?
Either way it's killing me
I have to rid all the less

Evilution, I transform
Evilution, I transform, I declare war...

...against the fools unaware
Don't try to sleep I'll be there
To hunt you down again
Evilution feels no remorse

How many years 'til you wake up?
Death comes in season, always on time
Stuck in a box, cornered to the middle
Lifeline genetic, create and destroy

...against the fools unaware
Don't try to sleep I'll be there
To hunt you down again
Evilution feels no remorse
