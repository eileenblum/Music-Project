It goes deep inside your mind
It wants you to commit
Strange feeling haunts my sleep
Following me into daylight
It won't let me be alone

I feel the agony pierce right through me

In the end there will be no great reward
So don't try to justify your beliefs anymore
Souls on departure

You think that you're sane inside
But it controls you all the time
I know for sure that I will die
Some people believe in afterlife
I say when we die, there's nothing left

I feel a change taking shape inside me

In the end there will be no great reward
So don't try to justify your beliefs anymore
