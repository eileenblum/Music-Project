End all living and break this world
A pattern of destruction
Seek the cure to what the plague has caused
Diseased in time

On and on, forevermore
We will damn
On and on, forevermore

We're the summoning, order of doom
We're the summoning, hands of fate

Raised on disrespect of all alive
We ignore
Summon up to strike at last
It's the epoch armageddon

On and on, forevermore
We will damn
On and on, forevermore

We're the summoning, order of doom
We're the summoning, hands of fate

Boundaries in stupidity never existed
Ignorance's our call
Shameless and careless
We gaze at the nightfall
