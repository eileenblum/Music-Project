Our creator, the force of our habit to evolve
No religion, just the common symbol of when time began
Those who foresaw our fate in our early years
Passed on their knowledge in different shapes across the world

There are those amongst us, bound to enlighten us all

Rise from the ashes of our lives
Heed the oblivious always doubting
Strike down the masses unaware
Arise and face today

Sun and moon - universal forces almighty
What sign you represent is not relevant when the end comes
The script's already written for us to live
Spend your time and use your mind to the furthest kind

There are those amongst us, bound to enlighten us all

Rise from the ashes of our lives
Heed the oblivious always doubting
Strike down the masses unaware
Arise and face today
