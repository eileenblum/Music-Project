I wear the mark defining time
Earth shook many a times as I've lived
Forever I have walked this path of mine
Many times I have questioned existence

Whenever Death is called upon
I'm the one to carry out his will
I'm the plague
Harvesting lives while I'm grinning in vain
Counting my causes on fingers decayed
I'm the plague

I am the plague but I have many names
Mankind has feared me for as long as fear has been
I am one with many a names but you can call me The Plague

I'm the plague

So many lives I've extinguished
While humanity seeks a cure
I'm the plague
For every disease where one survives
I evolve to disrupt by killing two more
I'm the plague

I am the plague but I have many names
Mankind has feared me for as long as fear has been
I am one with many a names but you can call me The Plague

I'm the plague
I'm the plague

I wear the scar, marked by him
Earth shook many a time as I've lived
Forever I have walked this path of mine
Forever I have questioned existence

...welcome to my quarters son, enjoy my hospitality
you see, I only fulfill his will, feel the pain...

Fire shall swallow the earth
Illness will conquer birth

Sole with my illwill, I'm blessed with its' curse
Damnation's the price for all in my way
I'm the plague
Daily I'm roaming my lane of death
Accomplishing mission: Evilution, for HIM
I'm the plague

I am the plague but I have many names
Mankind has feared me for as long as fear has been
I am one with many a names but you can call me The Plague

I'm the plague
I'm the plague
I'm the plague
I'm the plague
