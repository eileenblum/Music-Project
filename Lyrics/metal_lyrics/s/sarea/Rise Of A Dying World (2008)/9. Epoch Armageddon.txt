Infernal attitude through centuries of time
Imbued by harmonizing disrespect
Man may learn when awakened in hell
Religious or not, our ending will tell

Armageddon's in our epoch

Why are we here?
Vain shall master society
Why are we here, 
when our deadline's due today?

Brutal corrosion into the core
A primitive weapon devastating
Silence means death's to come
Extinction and mankind, hand in hand

Armageddon's in our epoch

Why are we here?
Vain shall master society
Why are we here, 
when our deadline's due today?

Sinful is all we are
Killing our mother of life
