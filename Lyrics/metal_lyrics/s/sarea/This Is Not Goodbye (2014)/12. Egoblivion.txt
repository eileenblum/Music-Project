Did something leave your life?
Misfortune leads to denial
We seek oblivion. This cannot be undone

I bought your vote today
Welcome democracy
Songs for the broken, on sale today

How bleak does it get. No time to regret

Greed leads to nothing more than shallow ideas
If we as a people are living today
Then how can we live with being this way?
How can we live with being this way?

Lead me to oblivion
They creep and crawl
We come from nothing hear us roar

So are you ready to live the dream?
Are you willing to step over anyone to make it?
Do it yourself...Should he do it for yourself
It's no longer about helping out or doing
Something for someone else
Just because they need your help

WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?
WHAT DO I HAVE TO GAIN?
If I do this, what will you do for me?

I'm not saying we should all divert to being idealists
But I do believe it's time that you judge a society
By how they look after the weak
And less fortunate. Then again, there are over seven
Billion of us out there. What makes you and me
So special? NOTHING! We're all the same collaboration
between cells that need to work together for us to survive
What makes us so special is that we have a choice, we choose
Who lives and who dies
On this forsaken planet

Top of the food chain or
At the end of the line
