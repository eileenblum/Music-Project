Do I care enough to matter?
Think of the times we spent
Together. Forever
I gave everything I had
Reboot rewind my head
Look forward, start over

RUN
That's what you've always done
Will we ever see this place?
This place you call your home?

Will I make it?
Can I surrender everything?
Reverse this, got nothing
I poke around inside my head
I'm sorry, I'm drowning

RUN
That's what you've always done
Will we ever see this place?
This place you call your home
(DON'T GO) the shadow is all alone
Better be forgotten than left all alone

GIVE ME A PILL I CAN SWALLOW
WHERE FUCKING MEMORIES WON'T FOLLOW

RUN
That's what you've always done
Will we ever see this place?
This place you call your home
(DON'T GO) the shadow is all alone
Better be forgotten than left all alone

I found forever
Please don't you worry
This time I will let you go
Can you hear me?
Can someone tell me?
Is leaving the same thing
As letting go?
