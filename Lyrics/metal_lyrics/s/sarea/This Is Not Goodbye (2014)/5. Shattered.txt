Reactions better left for dead
State of denial, eyes turned bloodred
My mind is twisting, but my feet are holding still
Tears of sorrow. HOPELESS, last will

Move, nothing to see
I turn around it's instantly
Hits me like a newborn sun
A stroke of insight
NOW IT'S GONE

Keep sinking, head first, dead thirst
No opinions left to share
I'm a prisoner guardian a wreck
A bruised soul
With chains around my neck

I have this feeling that life is
Somewhere else
I have this urge to battle by myself
The scars are deep, buried here within
My head in CHAOS
Future looking grim
