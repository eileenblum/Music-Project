Tell the story of a man
Born leader, march hand in hand
Stand tall, wall proud
We won't live to tell
No one left to fight our wars
No cause and no remorse
Make way for neverland
All left is dead dead dead

We won't stop we won't try at all

We burn as we try
Will we ever see the sky?
No horizon, no relief
Humanity exiled

I see logic in the sublime
A caged release so deep entwined
Nothing left to lose
You cling to a hope that scars

Will we ever see the sun?
Faded out long, long gone
I wish for a better place
A place where night is day

We won't stop, we won't try
WE WON'T TRY
Even harder we must strike
We won't stop
We won't try at all
