Reach out, trying not to break.
This curse these worn out words.
A eulogy got lost in clear transparency.

Nothing can keep us from falling.
This downfall, no end in sight.
My plague is you.

Words.
Got nothing to say.
This plague will set me free.

We feed on broken souls.
Guided by lights of one last hope.

As easy as it started.
As difficult to break.
As easy as it started.
As difficult to break.

Nothing can keep us from falling.
This downfall, no end in sight.
My plague is you.
Nothing can keep us from falling.
This downfall, no end in sight.
My plague is you.

As easy as it started.
As difficult to break.
As easy as it started.
As difficult to break.

In mourning we suffer.
Yet heartache remains.
In mourning we suffer.
Yet heartache remains.
