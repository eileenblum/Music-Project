Catch flames, worlds apart
I've spent the last few hours
Looking for the cause
The answers that you seek

Leave all. Get out
Don't stop now

Just don't look back
Stay your ground
This water will not break through the cracks
Leave all. Get out
Don't stop. Get out!
(This flood it will not drown us)
(This force it will not move us)
(Leave all. Get out. Don't stop now)

I've held my head up high, summoned my last strength.
This is the final hour, this day I walk alone.

Beneath this road of envy
We sold our sleep to breath
Awoken from the slumber
I wished for better days

This pain I feel is real
But pain is not forever
