These are your darkest days
Your body filled with rage
Creak to stay awake
Something you need to say?
This is the day

I need to find a place where I feel at home
Somewhere I belong, somewhere I feel strong

Stuck in place 'til the end of time
About to change my mind
This clock it won't rewind
Breathless
I'm dying
I'm trying
To focus on reasons for why I can't see a way
Out of this day

Got something else to say?
You sure you want it this way?
Rupture will go away
Leaving you in pieces

Out of this. Out of this today
Out of this. Out of this someway
