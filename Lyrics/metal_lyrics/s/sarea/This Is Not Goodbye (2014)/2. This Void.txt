Serenity, the enemy
this conscience that I fear
Tranquility, I need you now
I need you to rebuild
This factory, this tragedy
It's all coming back to me
This wheel of no return
WILL I EVER LEARN?

Let me know
How life got so much better
Tell me how
How it all ends

Falling down, down, I am all alone again
I'm breaking through the sky. In solitude I stand
Breaking down, down, I am all alone again
I'm falling through the sky. In solitude I stand
My life abandoned

Society, the enemy
This structure that I fear
I'm all alone, I need you now, I need you to repair
Once more it's complicated
Once more it's out of reach
Once more it seems all over
Once more it's endless again

No one would hear the complaints
No one would ever care
No one would ever comfort
No one would ever be there

Nothing is all. All that we get
Nothing is now
Nothing at all
