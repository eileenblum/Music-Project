Reborn if blood and anger
Watch how this city burns
In flames and chocking ashes
WE WILL RISE AGAIN

Oh how I long for days of privacy

Run while you can. Don't say a word
I will chase you down
This day your story ends
I will chase you down

Sweet shadow calls me
A cloaked surveillance cam
We watch you beat this system
In our new stasicams

We seek the truth, but are we looking?
For something more than what we have?
RUN FOR SHELTER
Chase these demons out of my head
