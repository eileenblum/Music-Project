Conformity was never the answer
Regulation a cause for relief
Animating the dead to arise
Last call, are you in or out?

Master, Master hear my call
Lead me blindfolded, on and on
Arise your dead, force-fed
And the rest of your friends

We are leaving all those wasted years
Believing we could always escape
This time we are all left to die
Force-fed a lifelong lie

Manifestation of the scorned
The high end of human code
Generic force of illusion
Where did it go wrong ever (go back)?
READY NOW? Holster your thoughts
Damnation, solution, withdraw
Repent atone for your crimes
a lesson learned in life
