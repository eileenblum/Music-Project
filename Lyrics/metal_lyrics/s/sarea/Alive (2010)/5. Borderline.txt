systematic overdrive
my chaotic reality
a demon driven optimism
delusionistic sanctuary
a borderline impersonated
on legacies of disbelief
steering life with unseeing eyes
a disturbed mind in harmony

come to me
taste the sweets in my utopia

let me fabricate
let me live my reality
I'm the borderline
help me fantasize
help me live my reality

with devil eyes I passionate
sacrificing sexual flesh
serpent tongue is licking skin
poisoned love with no regrets
further away my mind drifts off
twisting worlds and turning days
into hell nights, forever black
with agonizing pain 

come to me
taste the sweets in my utopia

let me fabricate
let me live my reality
I'm the borderline
help me fantasize
help me live my reality
