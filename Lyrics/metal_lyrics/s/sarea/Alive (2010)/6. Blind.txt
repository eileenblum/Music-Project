I can show the essence of a void
I'll find symmetry in empty rooms
brought down to the deepest one of all
underestimated life on a daily basis

here I stand, wearing out my innocence
feeling torn but bound and lifeless
I'm my greatest enemy

burn fire burn
light my solitude within
make me blind to the world
cast my shadow on the past

show me all your doubts, let me enjoy
let me know what masters (are) all about
teach me how to smile for just one day
what you can't remember was never for real

here I stand, wearing out my innocence
feeling torn but bound and lifeless
I'm my greatest enemy

burn fire burn
light my solitude within
make me blind to the world
cast my shadow on the past

show me all your doubts
teach me how to smile
for just one day
