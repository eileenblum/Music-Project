life begins too late nowadays
so much we shall fulfill
we push our lives too much into the future
before we dare to live

catch your dreams, make'em happen now

make up your mind
no one knows what's waiting on the egde
live now if there's no tomorrow
make up your mind
no one knows what's waiting on the egde
live now if there's no tomorrow
live now you may die today

education seems like a good choice
our future is secured
years from now we're grasping the glory
we earned at younger days

we forgot our present, we forgot about today

make up your mind
no one knows what's waiting on the egde
live now if there's no tomorrow
make up your mind
no one knows what's waiting on the egde
live now if there's no tomorrow
live now you may die today
