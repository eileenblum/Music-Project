would you mind to raise the stakes?
an open game in mind wash
free for all, though it's you and me
to penetrate our afterlives
bringing me down to a level of yours
feeding my stupidity
still I know it's you and not me
I'll bring you down even lower

face to face, and facing death
see the final horizon

do you fear what you've become?
will you act before we're done?
all the treachery I feel inside is you
never again we'll run in line
nothing's left we're dead inside
seek no shelter now, this is nemesis

racing down my fearless road
adrenaline at boiling point
conquering my inner doubts
punching the nerves outside my skin
beating you up in our circle of war
sharp as a razor high on speed
permanent we fire at will
endless sad decay

face to face, and facing death
see the final horizon

do you fear what you've become?
will you act before we're done?
all the treachery I feel inside is you
never again we'll run in line
nothing's left we're dead inside
seek no shelter now, this is nemesis
