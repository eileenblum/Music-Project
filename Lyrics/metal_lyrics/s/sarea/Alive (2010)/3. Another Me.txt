distant is the world you knew
faded and worn, vacant and torn
memories go back to days so gray
welcome to my new reality

feel me
won't you breathe me
please me, come sweet death

fragments from a lost eternity
yesteryear built, yesterday burnt
what's seeming endless is nothing but a lifetime
join my final journey

feel me
won't you breathe me
please me, come sweet death
and as I open my eyes
I kneel for the new born horizon
taste me, another me

why can't you heal me
won't you speak to me
join me, oh sweet death
and as I open my eyes
I kneel for the new born horizon
embrace me, another me
