lost in the helix of time
with no chance to rewind
discarded dreams an irresolute state
was this life ever meant to be?

trust in christ to brake your fall
so entwined and enchanted of all

you are alone, there is no guiding star
no one to lead you
blindfolded you are
endless devotion to amor fati

the chosen path is marked by the one
and forever  you'll stick to his side
Though you're choking on dust from the trench
you'll never turn away.

trust in christ to brake your fall
so entwined and enchanted of all

you are alone, there is no guiding star
no one to lead you
blindfolded you are
endless devotion to amor fati
