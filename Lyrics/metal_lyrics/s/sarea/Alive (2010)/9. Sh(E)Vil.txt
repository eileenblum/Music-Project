a they bite you're laughing
perfect mind games - your euphoria
sadness hand in hand with vanity
hypnotizing chants in disharmony

I don't care for this no more
as I leave your world behind
I don't care, I'll watch you fall

it's only suffocating madness
falling deeper (down)
dividing hearts with tyranny
dethrone sh(e)vil

importing jealousy and doubts
trading with compassion
a lifeless symphony exposing
fatal desperation is at hand

I don't care for this no more
as I leave your world behind
I don't care, I'll watch you fall

it's only suffocating madness
falling deeper (down)
dividing hearts with tyranny
dethrone sh(e)vil
