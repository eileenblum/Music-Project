dreams crushed and tore apart
what's supposed will never be
calculating on misery
a sinister game, seeming endless
if you try to reach for life
they'll smash you down to the ground
locking you up in their righteous cage
feasting on your disbelief

they will bring you down
and they'll end your life

they'll watch, you're always on their minds
crawling to their feet
though you'll never be forgiven

degree day in protection
with some blue men in disguise
your closest friends and only hope

sacrificing so much for nothing
divine's the conflict of culture mismatch

they'll watch, you're always on their minds
crawling to their feet
though you'll never be forgiven
they see you, you're always on the run
messing with your life,
psychic knives - brainwash divine

they will bring you down
and they'll end your life

they'll watch, you're always on their minds
crawling to their feet
though you'll never be forgiven
they see you, you're always on the run
messing with your life,
psychic knives - brainwash divine
