tie your rope and make it tight
you must do this sin
do it now, you filthy man
no one will know you're gone

inside is gone, now your mine

Make your choice, play the game
choose a knife, choose a gun
make it good, strike and fall
with your coward purity

inside is gone, now your mine
I'll rip you up with your greed

be a coward take the pills
no blood, just sleep and death
tie your throat with a string
make it tight and it's over

the snare is good and strong
you are alone
I'm only in your head
do it now, do it now

inside is gone, now your mine
I'll rip you up with your greed

be a coward take the pills
no blood, just sleep and death
tie your throat with a string
make it tight and it's over
I'm the judge, I will make you beg
all purity is gone
I'm the judge I will make you beg
now suffer
