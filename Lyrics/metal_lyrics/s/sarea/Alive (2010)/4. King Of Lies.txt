they're weak but they are eager
fools in disguise, clever as few
cremating skin and blowing dust away
ripping your guts out, poisoning your veins

parading with madness
uncertainty's their road
embracing my conscience
as I stumble to their feet

I can't take this forever
riding on dreams wherever

break into my coffin and spread the word
liars rule and pawns are we

parading with madness
uncertainty's their road
embracing my conscience
as I stumble to their feet

I can't take this forever
riding on dreams wherever
and you're falling behind
I won't take this forever
another king of lies, a partner in crime
