May I kiss you wound?
Maybe that will heal my soul.
Free me from this tomb, light my darkness, make me whole!
Let me take your hand, and together we shall fly to a lonely place, where as "lovers" we can die.
In an land ... so dark ... of seven moons ... eternal night, with a sky of thousand stars, yet, for us there is no light...- there waits no light.
