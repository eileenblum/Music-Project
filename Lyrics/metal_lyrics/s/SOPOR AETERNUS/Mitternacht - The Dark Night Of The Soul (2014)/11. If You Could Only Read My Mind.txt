If you could only read my mind, 
you would know what I feel for you. 
If you could only read my mind, 
it's only friendship that I seek
and truth. 

If you could only read my mind, 
you would know that my trust
in you is complete. 
If you could only read my mind, 
you would know that I cannot
lie or deceive. 

If you could only read my mind, 
I don't want to scare you away. 
If you could only read my mind, 
all my life I've been alone, 
and I'm afraid... that this might
never change. 

Hoping, and waiting, and secretly
praying that I didn't say a wrong word
(or that I've gone too far revealing).
But I have never learned to hide
the things that I carry within me. 

If you could only...
