I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

He shot me down
I hit the ground
That awful sound
My baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang

Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

He shot me down
I hit the ground
That awful sound
My baby shot me down
