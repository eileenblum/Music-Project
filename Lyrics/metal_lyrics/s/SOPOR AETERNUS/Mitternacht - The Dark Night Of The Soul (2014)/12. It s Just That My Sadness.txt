Please, know... my sadness goes
all the way through. 
But, please, don't ever think
that I did not believe you. 

It's just, when I don't hear
from you in a while, 
then the old ghost of doubt
comes back and haunts my mind. 

Born from a past, a childhood
made for the most part of hurt
and pain, and it has come here
to show me once more, how it
is all repeating again...

...that my fragile and sad attempt
of finally making a friend
has been once more ridiculed,
and my trust has been betrayed...

...again. 

Please, do not ever think
that I am doubting you. 
It's just that my sadness
really goes all the way through.
