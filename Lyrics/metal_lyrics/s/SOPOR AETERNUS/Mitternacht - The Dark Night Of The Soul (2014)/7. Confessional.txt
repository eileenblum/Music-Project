Where do I begin, 
where should I start?
So much to tell... or nothing at all. 
At the end of the day it is all the same, 
'cause that's how things are. 

No-one ever writes, no-one calls, 
only replies, so I have to go first, 
which is tiring and sad, 
but all that I have, 
so I just go ahead with it. 

Because:
I DO believe, 
I DO believe, I DO believe, I DO, 
I DO believe in friendship...-
in FRIENDSHIP and in TRUTH. 

I often try picturing what it
would be like to have a friend, 
someone who spends his time
with me, enjoys my company
as much as I like him. 
Someone who calls for no reason
at all, simply out of a whim...-
whom, at the end of the day, 
I don't have to pay
like everyone else. 

Someone, who has no gain from
knowing my name, my weakness
or strength, who doesn't pretend
and isn't afraid to share pleasure
or pain, is honest and true.
