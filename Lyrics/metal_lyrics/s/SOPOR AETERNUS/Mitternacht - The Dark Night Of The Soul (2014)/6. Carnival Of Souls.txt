If your world has crashed around you,
and your hopes and dreams are gone. 
If you wish your life was over, 
but it drags you on and on.
Then lock up your heart forever
with all your ruined goals.
throw away the key, 
come along with me
to the Carnival of Souls. 

It's an easy thing to cash in 
all your chips and buy a ride,
and the kind of life that you lead
doesn't leave that much behind. 
When your flame grows dim
with darkness, and, at last, 
a lone bell tolls. 
Listen well to me... that bell tolls
for thee from the Carnival of Souls. 

But think twice before you enter, 
once you're there you can't return
to the world as you know it, 
and the hardest thing to learn
is... the heartache and the sorrow
will stay warm like glowing coals. 
Yes, it's sad, but true, 
they're a part of you
in the Carnival of Souls. 

Yes, it's sad, but true, 
they are forever a part of you, 
and they will burn you
like glowing coals
in the Carnival of Souls.
