Let me tell you a secret, one from
accross the divide; when I saw you
with her that day, I...
...I don't know how I felt, 
to be honest. Confused, maybe, 
at first and sad, because of the usual, 
but just for a moment...-
and then it all changed. 

Because there was also another
sensation, one I had never 
encountered before:
a genuine pleasance, 
a warmth overcame me, and I was
surprised that the only cause for this
was the fact that YOU were happy, 
and to witness this fortune
that wasn't my own, was enought yet
for me to abandon my sadness
and delight in the joy...
...that you clearly had found. 

But then, as it is with a mind that is
tidal, at the end of the day the sadness
returned, along with the cruelty of my
condition: forever denied... what now
became hers. 
To put it more bluntly: I pitied myself. 
I sat there and cried and sobbed like
a fool that nature had built me in such
a foul way...- that I will never be
what she is to you. 

Yet, as I compared my grey solitude
to the golden halo of your blissful joy, 
that warmth from before once more 
overcame me and stayed in my heart
till this very day. 

So, let me tell you a secret now:
it's almost like I am no longer myself, 
I am bathed in a wonderful feeling...-
for I now that you're happy and well.
