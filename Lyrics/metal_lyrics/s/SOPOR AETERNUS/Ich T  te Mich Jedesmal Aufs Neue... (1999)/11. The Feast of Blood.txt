Today the y've found another one, lifeless an the old subway floor. His face was turned to his back ...- the same way the others died before. "Drain the mortals to their last convulsion and veil the ancient cause. Let off of them and see then tumble, let off and en joy their fall!" The feast of blood ... "This mortal nectar that warms from the inside, this very special sort of mine. So delicious ...- let it flow, devour! Oh, so divine! ... and the feast shall never end, until we all descend ...- in hell.
