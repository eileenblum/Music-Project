I shattered all the mirrors fearfully hoping that they won't be able to remember my face. Darkest of all light, most greedy to embrace, surrounded by demons and breathing in life. "I don't want to be a perverted temple of my Lord ... though his hands I am, I have forgotten how to hear or understand his words..." Between tides the time seems endlessly, the force of habit or whatever pulle d me back into a well-known pain. What uses the knowledge of my progressions when the old world is g one? Without a new "inside", with my new-found life, I am homeless again ... "I don't want to be a perverted temple of my Lord. Through his flesh I am, I have forgotten how to hear or understand his words ..." I am falling down, back to the lowest spheres ...- Do you know my name? Did you answer? I just cannot hear ...
