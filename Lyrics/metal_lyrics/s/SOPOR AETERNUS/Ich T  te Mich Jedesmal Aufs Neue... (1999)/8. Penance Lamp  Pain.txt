"Living ...- have a look at the living! Dancing blindly, losing balance ... - will you choose pain or will you prefer "the penance"?" The living and the undead ...- penance and pain. Light and dark, into paths ahead: Death to Rebirth or "life undead"". Life on one side, the Undead on the other side ...- the darkest side. I don't belong to "your" side anymore, I am one of the Undead ...- damned and forgotten.
