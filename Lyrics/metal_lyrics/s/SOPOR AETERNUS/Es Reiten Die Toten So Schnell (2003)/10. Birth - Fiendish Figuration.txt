Exposed with hands as empty, as the opposite space,
Crawlingly we move to where the final station lies.
To whom is the debt that we are forced to pay,
Real faces dare to appear only, when we turn away.
Truth reveals itself ... - reveal yourself !
A face ordained to serve the hypocrites,
We know the masks, the artificial smiles ... -
Mind's black eyes should break the lies.
Distorted pictures are all trans/parent to us,
Phantasmagoria, such a useful weapon;
Ineffectual against us ... -
Enemies with the knowledge of truth.
Truth makes me sick ... - what a wretched play.

Paralysed by flesh and bone ... -
Condemned to vegetate,
Condemned to stay alone.
Helplessly we are escaping, we're clinging to ... -
Stranded at the shores ... oh, beloved infamous side.
Our distress in perfection, trials and tribulations ... -
Preferring our pain, we'll stay and die.
