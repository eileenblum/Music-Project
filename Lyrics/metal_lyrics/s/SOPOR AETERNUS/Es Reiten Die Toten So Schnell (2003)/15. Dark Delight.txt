Hands folded in a prayer,
A rosary embedded in-between ... -
Tonight I'll join you in your sleep.

(... sleep brings no joy to me ...)

I'll bring you back to life this night,
It's meant for the flesh at least ... -
I'll join you in your sleep.

(... sleep brings no joy to me ...)

Come up, I hear your voice ... - this is not me,
I'm not aware of what I'm doing.
I'll shiver at the recollection,
When I'll awake with the soil ... on my hands.
I know, they will find you ... fallen asleep again,
Between the mounds and crosses.
Tomorrow night it will be just the same ... -
It will be just the same.

(... sleep brings no joy to me ...)
