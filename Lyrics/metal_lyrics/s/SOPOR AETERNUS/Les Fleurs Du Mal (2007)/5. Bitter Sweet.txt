Well this is such a sad affair
IÂ´ve opened up my heart so many times
But now itÂ´s closed
Oh my dear every salted tear
It wrings

Bitter - sweet applause
But when the showÂ´s in full swing
Every once in a while
High stepping chorus lines
Mean iÂ´m forgetting
Mein lullaby - liebchen
How rich in contrast
Love can be

Sometimes iÂ´m quite amused
To see it twist and turn
To taste - both sweet and dry
These vintage years!
Lovers you consume, my friend
As others their wine

Nein - das ist nicht
Das ende der welt
Gestrandet an leben und kunst
Und das spiel geht weiter
Wie man weiss
Noch viele schÃ¶nste...wiedersehn

And now, as you turn to leave
You try to force a smile -
As if to compensate -
Then you break down and cry
