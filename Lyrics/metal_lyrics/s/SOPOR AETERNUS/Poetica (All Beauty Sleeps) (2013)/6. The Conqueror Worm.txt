Lo! ('tis) it is a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years
An angel throng
Bewinged, bedight, in veils
And drowned in tears
Sit in a theatre
To see a play of hopes and fears
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres

Mimes in the form of God on high
Mutter and mumble low
And hither and thither fly
Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro
Flapping from out, their condor wings
Invisible Woe

That motley drama, oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot
With its phantom chased
Chased for evermore
By a crowd that seize it not
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self same spot

And much of madness and more of sin
And horror, the soul of the plot

And much of madness and more of sin
And horror, the soul of the plot

But see, amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrudes
A blood red thing that writhes
From out the scenic, solitude
It writhes
It writhes
With mortal pangs
The mimes become its food
And the angels sob at vermin fangs
In human gore
(Imbued)
Imbued

Out are the lights, out all
And over each quivering form
The curtain, a funeral pall
Comes down with the rush of a storm
And the angels, all pallid and wan
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, man
And its hero
The conqueror worm
