At midnight, in the month of June
I stand beneath the mystic moon
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim
Exhales from out her golden rim
And softly dripping, drop by drop
Upon the quiet mountain top
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley

The rosemary nods upon the grave
The lily lolls upon the wave
Wrapping the fog about its breast
The ruin molders into rest
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take
And would not, for the world, awake
And would not, for the world, awake

All beauty sleeps
And lo! where lies
His casement open to the skies

(All beauty sleeps)

All beauty sleeps
And lo! where lies
His casement open to the skies

Oh, lover bright, can it be right
This window open to the night?!
The wanton airs, from the tree top
Laughingly through the lattice drop
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout
Flit through thy chamber in and out
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully, so carefully

Above the closed and fringed lid
'Neath which thy slumbering soul lies hid
That, o'er the floor and down the wall
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall

Oh, lover dear, hast thou no fear?!
Why and what art thou dreaming here?!
Sure thou art come, o'er far-off seas
A wonder to these garden trees

Strange is thy pallor, strange thy dress
Strange, above all, thy length of tress
And this, all this
And this, all this solemn silentness

My lover sleeps
Oh, may his sleep
As it is lasting so be deep
Soft may the worms
About him creep
I pray to God that he may lie
For ever with unopened eye
