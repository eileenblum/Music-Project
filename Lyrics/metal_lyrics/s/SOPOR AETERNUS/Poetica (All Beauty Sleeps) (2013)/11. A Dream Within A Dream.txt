Take this kiss upon the brow
And in parting from you now
Thus much, let me avow
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone?!
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream
A dream within a dream

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf tormented shore
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand
How few, yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep
While I weep

Oh, God!
Can I not grasp them
With a tighter clasp?!
Oh, God!
Can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?!
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream,
A dream within a dream?!

You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
In a vision or in none
Is it therefore the less gone?!
