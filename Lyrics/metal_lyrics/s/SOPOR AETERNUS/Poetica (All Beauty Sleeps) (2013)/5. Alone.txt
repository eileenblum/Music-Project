From childhood's hour
I have not been, as others were
I have not seen, as others saw
I could not bring
My passions from a common spring
From the same source
I have not taken my sorrow
I could not awaken my heart
To joy at the same tone
And all I loved, I loved alone
Then, in my childhood
In the dawn
Of a most stormy life
Was drawn
From every depth
Of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still

From the torrent or the fountain
From the red cliff of the mountain
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold
From the lightning, in the sky
As it passed me, flying by
From the thunder and the storm
And the cloud that took the form

When the rest of heaven was blue
Of a demon in my view
Of a demon in my view
