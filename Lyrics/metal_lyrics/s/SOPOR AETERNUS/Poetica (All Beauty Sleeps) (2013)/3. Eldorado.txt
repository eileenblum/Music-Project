Gaily bedight
A gallant knight
In sunshine and in shadow
Had journeyed long
Singing a song
In search of Eldorado

But he grew old
This knight so bold
And over his heart a shadow
Fell, as he found
No spot of ground
That look(ed) like Eldorado

And as his strength
Failed him at length
He met a pilgrim shadow
"Shadow," said he
"Where can it be
This land of Eldorado?!"

"Over the mountains
Of the moon
Down the valley
Of the shadow
Ride
Boldly ride
If you seek for Eldorado"
(The shade replied)

But he grew old
This knight so bold
And over his heart
A shadow fell
As he found
No spot of ground
That look(ed) like Eldorado
