In my version of the story,
Nemo makes out with Arronax,
below the surface of the oceans,
in the uncharted, murky depths.
In those lower regions of this world,
where the cruel light reaches not,
they kiss and touch, and kiss again ...-
oh, and then distroy some battle-ships ...

In Captain Nemo's study, that red velvet lounge,
after those symbolical cigars,
they take turns playing that big organ ...-
wild symphonics that shake the walls.

In my version of the story,
on that old loveboat "Nautilus(t)",
they are cruising happily forever ...-
Oh, and blowing battle-ships to dust.
