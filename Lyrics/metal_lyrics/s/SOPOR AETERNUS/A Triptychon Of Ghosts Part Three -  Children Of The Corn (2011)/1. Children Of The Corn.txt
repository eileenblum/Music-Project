There's not a shred of beauty here
residing in the human flesh,
there's only sadness and confusion,
and the stench oh shit and death.

In moments, dull, of self-pity
of insufficiency and doubt,
I catch myself, black-handed thief
wishing that there'd be someone else.

Sometimes ghosts are passing through
the mind, both labyrinth and tomb,
and yet it's still unrivalled here,
Because all things unborn, only ideas,
are sleeping safely far beyond the horrors of decay,
and are thus sacred and immortal, because they never had to fade.

Thumbing at times harlf-heartedly
through flip-books of a lonely child,
old silent movies shake and flicker
in the dark theatre between my thighs.

Then countless are the heads and limbs that wildly jump atop
soulless bodies, unspecific, as they are numberless and cropped.

When you close your tired eyes,
does he then join you to this place ?
Will he cross over, share your dream,
or does he vanish on the doorstep, all too quickly disappear ?

Alas reality is such a crippled whore,
all mortal things are sick and rotten to the core,
only the mind, that frail, but kingly jewel,
gives birth to beauty, love and truth.
