I climbed the stairs up to his floor
and placed the box outside his door
I did not speak, said not a word,
left as I came... unseen... unheard.

Threefold the sign had marked this day,
to end a love, one-sided, fey:
the sickle and the morning-star
and the brightest moon... -
O, virgin I, unanswered bride,
have freed myself from you.

I, like ether,
veiled in shadow and in silver light,
sever all the wicked ties that used to bind me,
bind me to the likes of him.

Go.
