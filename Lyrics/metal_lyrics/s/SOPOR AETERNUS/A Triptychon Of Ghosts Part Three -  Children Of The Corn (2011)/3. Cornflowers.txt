If I had... Oh, if I only had a proper cunt
I would be delighted to lift my skirt for you.
I would gladly take your hard cock in my hands
and bury it, ever so deeply, in the darkness of my tomb.

Come, my handsome ghost of lust, and masturbate for me
I promise, it will get you out of your misery
I have been sleeping on the flours for days... to keep myself from dreaming,
a punishment for things delayed and maybe for disbelieving.

Don't scare away the old crows in the field,
walking in lumber... through rows and rows of corn.
I am madly in love with a sad illusion, don't you see... -
but, then again, aren't we all ?

He will build a temple, a temple for your Schwanz,
and he will build it with his mouth.
He will chant the poetry, words of heartfelt longing,
all through the lonely midnight hours.

If I had a proper cunt, I'd lift my skirt for you,
I'd take your hard cock in my hands and bury it deeply in my tomb.
