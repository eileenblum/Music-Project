May I kiss your wound,
maybe that will heal my soul.
Free me from this tomb,
light my darkness make me (whole)
let me take your hand and together
we shall fly to a lonely place,
where as lovers we can die.
In a land so dark, of seven moons,
eternal night, with a sky of thousand stars,
yet for us there is no light...
There (waits) no lights.
