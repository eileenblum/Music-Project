I once made a Confession, it won't happen again,
I've killed all my Desires after that fateful Day...

I once had an Erection, well... sort of... at the Age of Five,
we fumbled in the Bushes, Yes, we made out in broad daylight.

Not sandbox, slide or jungle-gym,
entertained a different whim:
our groins playfully occupied...
it was our first and only time.

Because I failed to take into account
that my Sickness would be spread around:
All the Parents gave advice to shun
that dirty little Fairy who was out to stain their precious sons...

Sometimes, in those lonely Hours,
I can hear His voice in my Head,
the most erotic Promise that a Man has ever made:
"If you were a landscape Love,
a kingdom I came passing through,
I'd stop and reach down for my Penis and urinate all over You."

I once had an Aquaintance too,
who liked to wrestle me (me me),
he'd put me in a Headlock or he'd simply sit on Top of me.
One sunny day then I found out
that touching me got him aroused,
which gave a whole new meaning to
the Squats our Gym-coatch made us do...

... Where he had to sit on my Shoulders all Sweat &amp; sighs,
my Head embedded firmly between his strong warm Thighs.
Perhaps all this got me somewhat predisposed...
... for butch guys, Bears and things you're not supposed to do...

Sometimes, in those lonely Hours,
I can hear His voice in my Head,
the most erotic Promise that a Man has ever made:
"If you were a landscape Love,
a kingdom I came passing through,
I'd stop and reach down for my Penis and urinate all over You."
