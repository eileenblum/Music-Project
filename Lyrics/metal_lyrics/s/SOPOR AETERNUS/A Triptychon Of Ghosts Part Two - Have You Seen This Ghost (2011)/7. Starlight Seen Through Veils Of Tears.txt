Is it a Belly of Muscles I see shaping underneath that turtleneck?
I never ever dreamt having the rusty trunk of a car against my Backside...
That's poison for my piles, the street is glimmering, 'cause it had rained all
night.
Please, do not think that I don't appreciate your generous Offer of a Ride...
home.

I am curious now, how many pirouettes can a straight Man like you spin,
until his Compass-points all begin to blur, and his Needle finally gives in?
Am I expected now to do my best and try to catch you when you fall?
But you're a heavy Guy and like this we'll only end up lying on the floor.

Look, what the Rain has done,
snow-white has scattered her Mirrors like petals on the Ground.
So I sense a one-eyed Serpend
rising slowly now from behind this old thundering Cloud?
Was it a trick of the Evening-star,
or had I been blinded by the passing lights,
Could it be that I really saw myself reflected in his green-grey Eyes?

It's hard to waltz precissely when his towering stature casts its Shadow all
over me.
But since he's leading now (anyway), I might just as well step onto his feet...
