I do not eat because I'm hungry,
though... this sometimes happens too,
I only eat because I'm lonely
and I got nothing else to do.

I recently discovered it's the perfect Way to pass the Time,
I'm wolbing down all kinds of Shit,
to fill the Emptiness inside.

I tend to live on Chocolate now, for Reasons I mentioned above,
the Fridge's become my new best friend, and Food...
my substitute for Love.

I do not really go for Taste,
there's no such thing as 'good or bad',
I get no joy from eating food 'cause all things taste the same...- I'm fat.

I've banned all Mirrors from my home,
I cannot bear them judging me,
I feel... I'm gaining weight each day.
I hate myself enough for three.
I do not eat because I'm hungry,
well, yes... that sometimes happens too,
I mostly eat because I am alone,
and I've got nothing else...to do.
