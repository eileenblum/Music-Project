What has happened while we slept?

We have revived the water... or perhaps it simply woke up on its own.
Anticipating... it is murmuring now along its ancient bed.
Where is the stone... the tower...that worships...and reveres us?
No such a stone is here, I swear...well feeling that there should be
On hottest rods we're shooting through the night along a private garden-way...
Though we no longer have any business being here
On the left-hand side the greenhouse of a market garden...
What fragile shoots are being sheltered there?!

Merry Rock, dressed in the midnight gown of tears,
He is sitting on the floor and cries
His eyes are gazing at the western sky...
Oh everything seems lost to him
Tapping his shoulder gently,
My desire hardly concealed:
You've done a lot already, and much more you will achieve!
Sweet syrup consolation is dripping from my mouth...
Can I, myself, believe this solemn vow?

I shattered all the mirrors fearfully hoping
That they won't be able to remember my face.
Darkest of all lights
Most greedy to embrace
Surrounded by demons
Or breathing in life...

Between the tides the time seems endlessly
The force of habit or whatever
Pulled me back into a well-known pain.
What uses the knowledge of my progression
When the old world is gone
Without a new in sight, with my new found life
I am homeless again...

"I don't want to be
a perverted temple of my Lord...
thought His hand I am
I have forgotten how to bear or understand His word..."

I am falling down
back to the lowest spheres... Do you know my name?
Did you answer
I just cannot hear...
