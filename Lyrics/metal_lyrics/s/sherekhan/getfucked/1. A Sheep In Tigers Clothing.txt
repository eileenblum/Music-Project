Remember
When you said the words that meant nothing
So convincingly
You had a tigers skin for a fucking sheep
You've shown your true colors
We know you inside, and you're nothing
Nothing

You were never shit then
And you ain't shit now
Nothing has changed
You're still a fucking fake

You went out and turned your back
On everything you ever claimed
You broke your fucking edge
And shit will never be the same
