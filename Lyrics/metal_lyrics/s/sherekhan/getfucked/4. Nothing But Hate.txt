The corrosion of our humanity
I won't share in their fate

My devotion is to destroying apathy for atrocities

The human race could have been something great
Instead we waste our lives away feeding dependency

Nothing but hate for the human race
All that I see is my disappointment
As you're killing yourselves, I'll stay unbroken
Straight edge
