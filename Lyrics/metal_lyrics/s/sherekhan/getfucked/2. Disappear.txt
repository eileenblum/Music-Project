I'm brining certain things to light
You're a fucking liar
Forget everything you've ever said
All your words are just pretend

Now I can see from here
The pictures getting clearer

You never gave a shit about your friends
You're talking taller than I've seen you stand up
Cause every time I had your back
You'd disappear
Your boasts are lies, and I'm calling your bluff
Calling your bluff

The time I wasted by your side
As you spit out your lies
To think one time I would have called you friend
And now I'm kicking your teeth in

You run your game about loyalty and talk your trash
And expect me to have your back
But every time I'd turn around, you were gone
You'd disappear
