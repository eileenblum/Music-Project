Skipping school to skate all day
We didn't give a fuck about anything
We did what we want and
There was nothing you could say

Cheap seat ball games when we were kids
You go left after the rat and then over the bridge
But now nobody even knows who Bleacher Creature is

And the doors to my favorite punk rock shows
Have long been boarded up and closed
And the once fresh paint on the walls of Gold's
Is chipped and faed and growing old

We all are growing older
This is your life
Open your eyes

My father looks at his life when he was my age as glory days
I refuse to let my memories be all of faded dreams
I remember my youth as a time when I lived my life for only me
That way I lived is the way I feel
And I will not forget
