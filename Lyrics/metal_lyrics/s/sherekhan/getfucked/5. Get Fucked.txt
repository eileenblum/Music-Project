Somebody once told me there's a golden rule
"Do only unto others as you'd have them do to you"
But the only thing I got was my ass kicked,
And a reputation as the kid
Who puts up with your shit

So I turned my back
On a world that had its back to me

Never saw much use in running the rat race
I never wanted any more
Than to be looked in the face
My friends are the only ones who gave that to me
So until I see different
The rest of the world is enemies

Brotherhood, family
More than words to me
"Lifetime loyalty"
I say with sincerity

This world can get fucked
It's us against them
Making enemies and
Burning every bridge we can
