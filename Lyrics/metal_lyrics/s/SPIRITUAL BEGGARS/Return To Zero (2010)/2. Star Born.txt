Sitting here watching the sun
Melt into a golden sea
It fills me with wonder
Of life's ever growing mystery

You're living on borrowed time
Pick up your self esteem
And start living your dream

We are star born
Ready to burn!

Try to not dwell on the bad
It'll only end up driving you mad
Nothing better than to see you smile
Blessed by a ray of the sun
