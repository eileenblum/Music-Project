Look me in the eyes old friend
Say those things you said again

The life you lived has led you here
To a point of no return

You know, I know that this is the end
The smoke is clearing
A new dawn is rising
Never, ever looking back again
You know, I know that this is the end

The choice you made is yours to live
The bridge you burnt is yours to keep

There is no more you and me
We are free and so it shall be.
