The stage is ready - amps are buzzing
And the crowd is roaring
Anticipation, admiration
The show is on

We were looking for something to believe in
And we found it in music
We lose ourselves in the moment
Food for our souls

And we are free
We are free

In the volume, in the power
We stand as one
Body and soul - no mind control
This night will never end

We were looking for something to believe in
And we found it in Rock and Roll
We lose ourselves in the moment
Food for our souls

["music in the soul can be heard by the universe" - Lao Tzu]
