All things must pass
A good thing seldom lasts
But you know that's OK
You go your own way
Was never really good at this anyway

But the road less travelled
Is the one for me
Somewhere down life's dusty path
Is where I'll be

Bitter facts of life
I know them all too well
And if I'm right
And even if I 'm wrong
I need to stay free
And find some answers
Just for me...

The road less travelled
Is the one for me
Somewhere down life's dusty path
Is where I'll be
