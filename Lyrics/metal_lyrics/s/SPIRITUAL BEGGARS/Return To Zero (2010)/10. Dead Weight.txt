One time, pushed your luck too far
No game, without a number one
Last call, never cared for less
Free fall, forget the one you love

Turn around and face the sun
Walk another mile
Hear  me out, I'm the loving kind
I'm fighting all this

Deadweight
Living your lie
Deadweight
Wasting my time
Heart's grown cold, your mind's gone old
The spark is gone, guess I stayed too long
Deadweight
Dragging me down

Homegrown, final journey home
Long gone, spot the restless soul
One down, deny the state you're in
Stand tall, there's no second chance
