We both know - you were right
I was wrong - don't wanna fight
We're wasting time - precious time
All I want is to make things right again

Can you believe in me
Like I believe in you
Getting on the train tonight
I'm coming home to you

How can I gain your trust again
Things got out of hand last night
Bad words spoken, promises broken
I don' want to lose my best friend
