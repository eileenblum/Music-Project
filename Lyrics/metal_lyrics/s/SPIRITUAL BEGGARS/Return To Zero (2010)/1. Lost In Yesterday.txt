It's not the same without you
Twenty years now dead and gone
Fresh flowers on the grave

Time that was long ago
You're still with me when I'm low
Faded  picture on the mantlepiece

Forever lost in yesterday

Been living in the past
Will I ever find peace at last
I'm still lost in yesterday

The nights are never ending
Chasing shadows deep in the night
Stay away, away from the light
