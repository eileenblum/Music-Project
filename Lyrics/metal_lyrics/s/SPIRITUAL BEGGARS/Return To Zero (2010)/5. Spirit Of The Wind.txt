I wake up in my own bed
Pull the shades - to see the day
All I see is sorrow
All I feel is hollow...today
Black towers reach for grey skies
The statue's face full of sadness
All I see is sorrow
All I fell is hollow...today

No one laughs, nobody smiles
This world is full of pain
And the spirit of the wind
Echoes in the distance, so far away

I walk on empty streets
This used to be my home
All I see is sorrow
All I feel is hollow...today
The playground is empty
I wonder where the children are
All I see is sorrow
All I feel is hollow...today

No one laughs, nobody smiles
This world is full of pain
And the spirit of the wind
Echoes in the distance, so far away

I woke up crying, thought I was dying
Spirit of the wind
I pull my shades to see a new day...
Spirit of the wind
