Got no soul, got no pride
Lost my touch,
Tried to stay cool
Drinking too much
My head is spinnin'
Oh, I've been such a fool

This self destruction
Can't take it no more
Just woke up on the floor
Try to pack it in, let my life begin
The time has come, I'm coming home...

I'm coming home!

I truly missed you
Can you find it in your heart
To forgive this clown
I'm sorry for the letters I never wrote
Regret the words I never spoke

My thoughts are clear now
So real now
Pure as the new fallen snow
I hope it's not too late
The time has come, I'm finally coming home...
