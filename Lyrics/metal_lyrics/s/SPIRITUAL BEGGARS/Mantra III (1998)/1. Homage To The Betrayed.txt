Someone bring me the wine!
Well you know, know what you came for
Are you still blinded by hate

well I try and I do understand you
never met a woman that hasn't betrayed me

You sit and you wait by the phone
You sure gonna gun down that whore

well I try and I do understand you
never me a woman that hasn't betrayed me

Someone bring me the wine!
Well you did, you did what you came for
said it was a voice in your head

well I try and I do understand you
But can't you tell a demon from a friend
