[bonus track]

Baby, will you hold my hand, my head is haunted
I feel that the worst is to come
Oh baby warm me
Maybe if you hold me tight
I will be alright
I feel that my life is running out
Oh baby love me

Gone insane...
I remember how it all went away

And if you should leave me here alone now
I will open the door to the end...
so I won't be left again

Heal me, will you heal my wounds
I need your love babe
Even if you don't know me yet believe I love you
Guide me, will you lead me through the hungry forest
I know if we pull it through love will bloom
