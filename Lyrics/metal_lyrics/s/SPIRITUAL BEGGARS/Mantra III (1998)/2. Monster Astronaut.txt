Take me to the river
Dance with the demons inside
Put me in the mist wait for the golden twist
Fly me to the moon we got enough of fuel
Dark moving shadows once got a hold of you
well I won't be back there

I won't be back there
No way
Tripping with my baby she's got a taste for fun
Dance a little dance
Twist into the magic trance
Monster astronauts semen of the sun
Monster astronauts now we're leaving ground

And we won't be back there

We won't be back there
No way
