Power up the electric lady
lick her spasmic skin
stick one finger into her mouth
wet her up for a carneval
Let luna set fire to our souls
Red wine won't escape our tounges
kiss scars of yesterday goodbye
let the romance kick off
Our minds are cristal clear
don't mind the silver lace
there's no limit for souls in love
cosmic romance kick off
