Fine woman won't you buy me another drink
I'm broke but not tired
you can pour all your problems on me

Smoke queen mama kiss me so sweet
Licker King papa make me feel free

Take me away baby
let us loose ourselves
Fine Lady will you sail away with me
Let's climb to the top of my magic tree

We're getting bye baby
just buy me another pint of hell
Take my hand baby
we'll find a better way
You're such a sad looking Lady
come onboard, join the show
