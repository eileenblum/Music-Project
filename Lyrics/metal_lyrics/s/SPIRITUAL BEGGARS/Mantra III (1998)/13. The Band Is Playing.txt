[bonus track]

Pass me the wine... gotta, gotta warm up my spine
It's what I need to carry on...
So many people have come down to see the show
seems to be a fine day for Rock'n' Roll!

The band is playing
The girls are swingin'
Booze is flowing and we are loaded

(Bring out the band...)

There's that hazy bird with diamond eyes
she always swings like a crazy cat
shes a woman of the first division
she's filled with the holy ghost of rock'n'roll

Pass me the wine... gotta, gotta warm up my spine
It's what I need to carry on... honey
Tonight's the night, gonna give you what you want
Fill you souls with good old rock'n'roll, c'mon!
