Bad karma, bad life
Magic wonders is a horse without a head
No sign of hope, my soul miss home
Pills and booze become my lullaby

I'm singing to you
Don't give me your truth
Divine woman, blackhearted lady
Tenderness turns to a holy mess
Sence of chaos, a broken song
Find myself in the worse mess I've been

Bad karma, bad life
Magic wonders ain't made for you and me
But inside charmers make me breathe
They tell me stories of why I have to bleed
