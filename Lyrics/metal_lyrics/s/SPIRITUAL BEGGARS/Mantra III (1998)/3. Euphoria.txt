The sun is high and so am I
The plant in the hole starts to rise
Thoughts of the moon rotating in the room
I'm floating down a river without you
Smoke me baby, boil my soul
Let your wet pieces warm my bones
Ocean wide smell of freedom
Ocean wide taste of joy

I'm thirsting for euphoria
I'm drowning in this ocean of doubts
I'm fighting with my phobia
I'm thirsting for euphoria

Planets circulate around our heads
Listen carefully and you hear them say
Life is love and together we are God
Hold me tight, warm my bones, take me home
