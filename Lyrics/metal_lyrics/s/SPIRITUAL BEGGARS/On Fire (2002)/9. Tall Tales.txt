[Music: Michael Amott]
[Lyrics: Michael Amott]

Rising up -Iâve had enough of 
Your lying and backstabbing
Who wants to listen? Who wants to know?
You got a problem and you let it show

Iâm no fool -I see through you
Pitiful, thatâs what you are
You donât know me, you never did
And you sure as hell never will now

The things you say behind my back
Distorted view of a jealous mind
A jealous mind can be excused
But who are youâ¦who are you to judge me?

So you never believed in meâ¦
To tell you the truth
I never thought much of youâ¦

Telling all tall tales
Makes you feel good (makes you look bad)
But that black tongue
Is dragging you down
