[Lyrics: Per Wiberg]

Street fighting saviours
Flashes down the street
Got my mind on the favours
Damn hard to make ends meet

Way above the action
Next to a liars mind
Trying to build some attraction
I guess itâs hard to find

Donât take it for granted - I can see through you
Ainât got the answers - But I got plans for you
Donât take it for granted - I can see through you
I came empty handed - But Iâm never falling through

Shivers down my backbone
Need to hitch a ride
Spaced out and on my own
Sometimes itâs hard to hide
