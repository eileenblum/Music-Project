[Music: Ludwig Witt/Michael Amott]
[Lyrics: Michael Amott]

Crawling on my knees
Fumbling in the dark
Turning wheel of fate
Keeps spinning

Iâve seen âem come and go 
Got the staying power
But I got nothing to show

How my life turned out to be
A rhyme without reason
A self fulfilling prophecy

Killing time
Donât know what Iâm doing
Killing time
Searching for that something
Killing timeâ¦

Back on my knees again
Lifeâs a losing game
This wheel of fate
Keeps on spinning
