[Bonus Track]

[Music: Michael Amott]
[Words: Michael Amott]

We used to walk in the sun
With our heads held up high
We vowed to never be like you
No, that just would not do

Where did we go wrong
Remember our song
Hanging on to the past
Donât you know that nothing lasts?

There was no way we could lose
Yet somehow we lost it all
And now we stand in line
Just like the rest of them do

Feeling the years
We cried all the tears
Feeling the weight of the 
Burden Of Dreams
