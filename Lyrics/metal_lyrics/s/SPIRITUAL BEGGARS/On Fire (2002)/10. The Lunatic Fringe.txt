[Music: Michael Amott]
[Lyrics: Michael Amott]

Demon rising slowly
Or is it all in my mind?
A reflection twisted
He knows me all too well

A face in the mirror
A man I do not know
Hopes and aspirations
A thousand broken promises

Fear is growing slowly 
Itâs drowning - killing my soul
Waiting, contemplating
The demon is reborn
