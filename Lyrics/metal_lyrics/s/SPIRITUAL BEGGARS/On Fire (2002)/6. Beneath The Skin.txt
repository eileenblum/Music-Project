[Music: Michael Amott]
[Lyrics: Michael Amott]

Always there to gloat
Revel in your failure
Echo in your head
A familiar voice

I am the clown in the mirror
The part of you, you hate
Never far away
Just thereâ¦ 
Beneath the skin

You sold your soul to me
A long, long time ago
Your own insecurity
Made me your master
