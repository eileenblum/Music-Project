[Lyrics: Michael Amott]

Youâve been down this road before
Heard this story a thousand times or more
With a cynical bitter stare
You watch your life go byâ¦bye, bye

A young man 
With an old soul
Open your mind
Donât close that door

No matter how high you climb
Itâs never high enough
Canât enjoy the moment, no
Never satisfied with what you got
