[Music: Michael Amott]
[Lyrics: Michael Amott]

Been ploughing the dark
Seeking shelter in hell 
Where evil dwells
The more you saw
The less you believedâ¦the less you believed

Casting pearls before swine
They could never see. They could not bleed
Decadence rules divine
In this sick and twisted world we call home

Youâll seeâ¦
See another mountain
Calling your name
Another way to wander

All the things you thought wrong, all the things you thought right
No longer carved in stone
These wounds from the past
Will follow you
As long as you let them last

The rising of the sun 
Is seen by everyone
Black feathersâ¦
Black Feathers at dawn
