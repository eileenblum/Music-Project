[Lyrics: Michael Amott]

Seeing is believing
Or so they say
But whoâs to judge
Whatâs real anyway?

I know itâs fake
So get off your high horse
Youâd rather have this dream
Than your tears and heartaches

Iâm sorry
But I canât help you
Iâm really sorry
But Iâm busy chasing fools gold

Itâs always been this way
I gotta ride my own wave
Canât intellectualise
Thereâs no compromise

Iâm not like you
I can only be me
And thatâs something 
You never quite figured out
