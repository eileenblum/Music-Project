[Music: Michael Amott]
[Lyrics: Janne Christoffersson]

No underhanded lies 
Better look me in the eyes
Speak the truth if you are still my friend

âCause I wonât be fooled 
By any calculated tries
Better change your plan
Or take your final bow

Look back
I never look back

To make me stick around 
You have to compromise
Itâs a give and take 
You gotta share the crown
âCause I wonât be hooked 
By any mystifying lines
Watch me stand alone 
Like I always have
