See days dawn under silence
Eyes cautiously follow face expressions

Well it's easy to live in a lie
but I guess it will be hard
to die with that wisdom

Bleeding, running blind
Dark meat rise
Eternal, the possible
Frozen under silence

It shines constantly inside the slaughterhouse
And from here I look out
Under silence
