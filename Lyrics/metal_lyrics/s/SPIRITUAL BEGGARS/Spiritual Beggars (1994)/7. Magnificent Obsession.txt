Who said death must be sad?
Let's go together, take my hand
Don't call me mad now 'cos I said so
I'll carry you across the deep black river

And as I lay you down
on the fresh green grass
I'll kiss your bloodred lips...

You know when night turns to day
and your head feels tired 'n heavy
When black and white emotions
turn to boring grey

We're together now and forever
we won't come back, no never
We're together now and forever
we won't come back... No...
