Woke up this morning from a wonderful dream
A dream about a beatiful land where I could breathe
The only thing I wanted was to go back to sleep
and dream all day long... I was feeling rather down

If this is all...

I dream all day long about having it all
of being rich and famous and doing what I want
I don't think it'll solve all my problems...
You know it's only money, but lot's of fun

If this is all...
I don't want to stay!
Don't want to stay... Take me to another place
