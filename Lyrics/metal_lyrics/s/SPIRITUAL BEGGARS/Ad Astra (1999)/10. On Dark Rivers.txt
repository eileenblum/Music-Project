On dark rivers we float
Never to meet the releasing sea
Our souls hide
Deep inside our bodies
We got to feed our dreams
Nurse our dreams
Sounds of words that are spoken
Merely flirting with the truth
But we never find it
Never can we put the finger on it
Under a bad moon
We try to figure out
Which way to fall In this masquerading boat
You've got to wonder
Why most of us
Choose to stay
