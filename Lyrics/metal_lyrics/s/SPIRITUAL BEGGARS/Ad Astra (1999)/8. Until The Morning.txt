Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I've been
I'm back in the hazy woods
I hear the mountains bark
Until the morning comes
I'll rest my head in my arms
Until the morning line I stay awake
I see no point in
Staying sane I sell my days to keep
My demons in control
I'm galloping towards death
I'm not apologising, not begging
When you reach knowledge
You will understand
