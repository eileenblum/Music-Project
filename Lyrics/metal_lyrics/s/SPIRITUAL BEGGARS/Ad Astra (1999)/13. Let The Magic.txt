Talk Into the blind zone - hiding
Cold as the moon now - freezing
We live in the shadows - with blindfolds
We die in the shadows - regretting
We didn't take the chance Into the blind zone - bleeding
Cold as the moon now - we are freezing
While fire burns away
Take a trip into your magic soul
You'll find you've lived a thousand times
Let the magic talk and ride away
With no feeling of doubt *** into the sun
Gaze into the centre of yourself
Left brain people never find this path
They stand there wondering
How anyone can be so naive
To search with
Over and over
Breathe magic rhythm
Gaze into the centre of your dream
Fell the magic rhythm take you away
Let the magic talk and ride away
With no feeling of doubt *** into the sun
Over and over
Breathe magic rhythm
Over and over
Let the magic talk
