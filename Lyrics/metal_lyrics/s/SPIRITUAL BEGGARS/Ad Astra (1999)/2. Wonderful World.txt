Cloudless sky is in my eyes
The sun has come out for air
My dog is sitting by my side
Watching me getting high
What a wonderful world
Looking with inner eyes
What a wonderful world
Nothing ever dies
Can you feel the taste of life
Or are you blinded by the clowns?
Shake the water and feed the sun
Oil the universal joint
