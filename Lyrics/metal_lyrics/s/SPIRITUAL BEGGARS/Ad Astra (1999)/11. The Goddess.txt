Said she's from another world
I said, "I know what you mean"
I gave her a little more red wine
Our dreams came up for air
Messengers from beyond
Future plans and history
I caught a little cloud
My semen took off
Yeah Baby!
You make me high, make me fly
Make me king of life
You shake the earth, shake the dirt
And we dance into the sun
Sacred words appear
Questions solved and we are gods
The goddess is for real
