He took me away
He showed me a way
The rivers where running too slow
The wizard said "This is your name Eternal Gladiator, my friend"
Higher and higher and higher I fly
Escaping the circle of clowns
With magic wisdom
With magic eyes
I'm eating the stars and the Moons
I'm going home
And guess what?
I'm not dead
Yes, I'm going home
Freedom is the name of my soul
Faster and faster and faster
I speed I'm beating the light
With my eyes I find thousands of universes
Inside every single atom
