She shone like the sun in those days
Whispered things into my head
Now I lie cold in my cell
Kissing pils to keep me sane
Angel of betrayal
Nowadays I like to meditate
With a couple of drinks
Sitting on my sofa
Watching a dumb TV
Gin and Tonic rules
Blood on the floor
Burn marks from cigarettes
My throat pleads for more
I tried to put my tongue into the cave
I prayed that
I was insured
I tried to put my tongue into the cave
But she led my mind astray
Angel of betrayl
I ought to kill the bitch
To clean out of my head
Letting off some steam
If you know what I mean
Gin and Tonic rules
Blood on the floor
Burn marks and everything
Her soul leaves for home
