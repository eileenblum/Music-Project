I bled through our time
All her lies
She drove me insane
Now I'm back in my shoes
And I ain't singing the blues *** no more
Do you remember me baby?
Down by the river of fear
Recall you said you would
Always love me
Down by the river
I stand with my gun
I'm gonna shoot you down
It's over for you
You stole my pride
And you stole my self-esteem
I fled into insanity
And I knocked on the doors of death
