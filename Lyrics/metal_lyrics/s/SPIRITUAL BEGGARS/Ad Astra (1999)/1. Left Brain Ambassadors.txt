He's never been arrested once In his life
Never received a letter from the law
Quite insane Never felt the demon riding his back
He is safe from harm
Never got hallucinations after
Being too long on the booze
Logical thinking
Turns to Stupidity
Never had longer relations
With the female sex
Never been quite all alone
Poor little boy
Never had suicidal thoughts
Never quite understood
The true meaning of the word life
