Looking up from an icy spot
Praying for the re-birth of the sun
If everything would explode
Would you breathe in or out?
Bring me a dog or a loaded gun
I'm fed up with all the people around
Most of them are to me
Like crisp breadcrumbs in my bed
And all I can say to you Is to fly with the riddle
To touch the moon
All I can say to you *** is try!
Passive thinking, stuck in the game
Souls hide in infected cells If everything would explode
Would they breathe in or out?
Stranded, deep in civilisation
People I thought were like myself
Have turned into what we all once said
We hated so much
And all I can say to you
Is that fly with the riddle
To touch the moon
All I can say to you
Is that I try
