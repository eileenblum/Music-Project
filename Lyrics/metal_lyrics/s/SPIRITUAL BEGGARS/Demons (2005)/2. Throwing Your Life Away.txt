I saw the worst of you
You saw the worst of me
Gotta learn to let it go
And leave it be

You're no good for me
I'm no good for you
Thought it'd last forever
How sad and naive

Can you try to see things my way...
Can you listen to what I say?
And you keep on calling back for more
Throwing your life away

Throw your life away
Do what you got to do
I must confess - I couldn't care less
About your sorry... mess

... Life can be so unforgiving...
... Life can be so cold...
