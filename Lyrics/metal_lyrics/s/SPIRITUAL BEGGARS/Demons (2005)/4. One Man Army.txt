There is darkness all around me
Or is it all within me?
Plastic faces, they are melting
They couldn't stand my heat

One man army... (Out of control...)

Phase two could be fatal
No time for fear, next level's here
Chain of command - it is broken
Inside my head the voice is clear

Warning light shines red
Reports show 1 million dead
The pressure's on to deliver
Once again I am your saviour

There is darkness all around me
Or is it all within me?
Plastic faces, they are melting
They couldn't stand my heat

...I am the chosen one...
...The one man army...
...Out of control!
