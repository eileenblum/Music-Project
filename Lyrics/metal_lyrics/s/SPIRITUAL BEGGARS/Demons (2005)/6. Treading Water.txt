How did you get this far?
Lying, cheating, stealing your way
You are burning out - Like a falling star
Always looking out for number one

When you're all alone
At the end of your days
When you're all alone
Will you regret your ways?

Never to find your inner peace
You're treading water again
Need to find some kind of release
But you're dancing on storm clouds
