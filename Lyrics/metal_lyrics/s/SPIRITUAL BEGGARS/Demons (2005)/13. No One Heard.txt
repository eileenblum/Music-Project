You're waiting for salvation
- guess it never came to pass
Who helps you when you're searching
- you know that nothing lasts
Still you plead for absolution
- And you're buying all the lies
- He was never there, never there

All your praying - it's all lies
All your kneeling - I spit in your eyes
The fate of betrayers - You got what you deserved
All your praying - No one heard

Ignoring what's around you
-never heeding nature's call
Building temples and double standards
- watching wisdoms fall
Still you think you've been chosen
- hypocrisy standing tall
You think your God is waiting
- one eye laughs in his hall
