Floating in a dreamlike state
My body is sleeping my mind is awake
Losing... control...
Letting go... letting it flow...

Been floating down the river
Through halls of jasmine trees
Otherworldly beauty
As far as my eyes can see
The whole world is open
Stretching out its arms
Beneath me the ocean
It's calling my name

Leaving all my burdens behind
The past and the future entwined
Losing... control...
Letting go... letting it flow...
