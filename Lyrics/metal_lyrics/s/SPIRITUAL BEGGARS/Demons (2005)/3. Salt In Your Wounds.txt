Don't turn your back on me
I'm not going anywhere
I'm telling you as a friend
There's more to life

Down on your luck
Walking that very fine line
The pressures too much
You're losing your touch

Been a long time coming
Time to break the mould
Been a long time coming
No more salt in your wounds

What's done is done
What you did was wrong
Now pick up the pieces and move on

Don't turn your back on me
I'm not going anywhere
I'm telling you as a friend
There's more to life
