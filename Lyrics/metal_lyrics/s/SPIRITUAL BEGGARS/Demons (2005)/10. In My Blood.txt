I have sailed upon the devil's sea
Tossed and torn, battered and worn
Lived through the pain
Survived my final battle
I'm coming home

It's in my blood - In my soul
It can't be bought - can't be sold
Won't back down - will cut you down
In my blood - In my soul

The moon and stars,
They guide me through the night
Can't change my situation
Nor my destination
I will return and take back what's mine
You will learn that this is my life
