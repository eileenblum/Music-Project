Never had it easy
Was never on a roll
Never felt love, sweet love
Always felt the pain
Never left compassion
For my fellow man
Some say I was born to die
Well, I guess they're right

I was born to die
I guess this was my life
Never meant to cry
But this pain is driving me insane

Never lived the good life
Always warring with myself
Never felt joy, sweet joy
Always felt the pain
Grew up on the edge of a sharp steel knife
Some say I was born to die
Well, I guess they're right

...Guess this was my life...
...Never meant to cry...
...I was born to die...
