I have lived my life alone
And I dwelled upon my throne
Lost in confusion now
Burned by insecurity

Rise above the lies
Now fortune smiles again

Laugh in the face of the enemy
Keeping of the ghost inside
Laugh in the face of the enemy
Leaving all my fears behind

I, I always came in peace
And I found trust in my beliefs
Betrayed by a war for souls
Left this sinking ship for fools

Now I'm here to stay
Prepare for blood today

Laugh in the face of the enemy
Keeping of the ghost inside
Oh, no, no
Laugh in the face of the enemy
Leaving all my fears behind
Leaving all
Leaving all
