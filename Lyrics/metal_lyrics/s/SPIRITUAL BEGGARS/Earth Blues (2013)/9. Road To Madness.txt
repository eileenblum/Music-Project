We've been through good, been through bad
Snarling patience, with demon eyes
The Dragonstone you all dream
Before you're over it, you'll be sold

It's a road to madness
Paid with gold
An ocean of sharpness
Calling your name
Your body won't turn back

The truth lies within, my friend
There's gotta be another way
The Dragonstone you all dream
Before You know it, You'll be sold

It's a road to madness
Paid with gold
I never An ocean of sharpness
Calling your name
Your body won't turn back
