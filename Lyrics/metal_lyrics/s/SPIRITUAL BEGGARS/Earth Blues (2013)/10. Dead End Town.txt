Rain keeps on falling
Falling on my head
Rain keeps on falling
Wishing I was dead

Winter's coming
Dragging me down

Walked the streets
A thousand times
Dead end roads in a
Dead end town
What you learned
Only comes out wrong
I wanna live but I don't belong

Rain keeps on falling
Falling on my head
Rain keeps on falling
Wishing I was dead

Winter's coming
Dragging me down
Yeah

Death is calling
In this dead end town
