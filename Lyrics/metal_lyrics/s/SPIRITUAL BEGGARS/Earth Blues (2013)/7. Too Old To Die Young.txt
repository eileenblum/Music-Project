In a dream I talked to you
Fading image of the man I knew

A neon moon shine as we're wild
Don't leave so soon, my friend
This music is life, is all that I know
And not too old to die young

So much harder to put through
I'm getting older, not any wiser

A neon moon shine as we're wild
Don't leave so soon, my friend
This music is life, is all that I know
And not too old to die young

Our void has been filled
Leave the love to the night
Another passing wine
Searching in the dark

Oh
The better I feel today
The worse I feel tomorrow
Always a price to pay
Come drown in my sorrow

Too old to die young
Too old to die young
Too old, too old
