The treasures you've been taking
The mistakes you've been making
You'll do anything for him
With disgust, you play the fool

You dream of tomorrow
I came without sorrow
It's never too late, no
But you know, you know

Hello Misery
Hello Darkness too
Hello Sorrow

You're very close to confusion
Hard to face the conclusion
Is it really turned in stone
That you wind up alone

You dream of tomorrow
I came without sorrow
It's never too late no
But you know, you know

Hello Misery
Hello Darkness too
Hello Sorrow
