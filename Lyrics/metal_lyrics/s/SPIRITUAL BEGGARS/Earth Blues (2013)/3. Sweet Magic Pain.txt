Call me a sinner, call me a saint, oh
you talked through the wine, wasting my time
You can't provoke me, can't know my mind
Just look around, time to calm down
Time to calm down

Come on, get down
Where do you draw the line
Come on, get real
Living on borrowed time

This is your big thrill
It's dead in the water
How do you feel? Are you for real?
Always seduced me, my sweet magic pain
Hold on tight, turn on the light
Turn on the light

Come on, get down
Where do you draw the line
Come on, get real
Living on borrowed time

The sadness in your eyes
Crawl up between me with a kiss
Look out below, my sweet magic pain
Save yourself while you can
Yeah, yeah

Come on, get down
Where do you draw the line
Come on, get real
Living on borrowed time
Living on borrowed time

You're living on borrowed time
Wasting my time
No, no, no
