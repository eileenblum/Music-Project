Dreamer, dreamer
Like a fool I thought
That I could be
Dream on, dream on
Surely someone
Will understand me

What do I say when I
When I've said too much
I think by now I'm wasting time
I'm going, well I know that I am gone
You are the absence of my mind

Oh Dreamer, dreamer
Like a fool I thought
That I could be
Dream on, oh dream on
Surely someone
Will understand me

Down the wrong way on a one way street
You'd think by now, I would have learned
I'm so little, but I learned only the less
I've only learned to repent

Oh dreamer

What do I say when I
When I've said too much
I think by now I'm wasting time
I'm going, lord I am gone
You are the absence of my mind

Dreamer, Dreamer
All of my life
I've been a dreamer

Dreamer
