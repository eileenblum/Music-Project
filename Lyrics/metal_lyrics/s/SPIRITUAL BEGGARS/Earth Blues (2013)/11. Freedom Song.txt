A man of simple visions
I don't ask for much
Just need my freedom
And to not live on my knees

I'm a hard lot to beat
I get back, back on my feet
Life's too short, way too short
To lose my integrity

I pity the fool
That lives by their rules
The wheel keeps turning
On and on, into my place

Let it be known
I'm a free man
Singing my
Freedom song

My truth is in my heart
Never lost track of who I am
No corporative
Caught up in the money game

I pity the fool
That lives by their rules
The wheel keeps turning
On and on, into my place

Let it be known
I'm a free man
Singing my
Freedom song
