One Man's Curse
No man's blessing
We ride the quest
Of the raging storm

It's killing me
Gotta get away
If you kill me now
Don't you ask me to stay

Your lips
Begging for sheen
But my jealousy
Speaks as much

Yeah, It's killing me
Gotta get away
If you kill me now
Don't you ask me to stay

I'm tired of fighting
Tired of living a lie
Going through emotions
Twisted devotion
It's no good

How to love the game
When no one wins
Secrets, lies and
Stolen truths

One man's curse
Another man's blessing
We ride the quest
Of the raging storm

It's killing me
Gotta get away
If you kill me now
Just don't you ask me to stay

I'm tired of fighting
Tired of living a lie
Going through emotions
Twisted devotion
It's no good

Come on!
