Yesterday is all I've known
Rebel in my final glory days
I sold my soul to rock
All my whole now stumble through the haze

And the sun won't shine no more
And the sky a blackened dome
No stars to guide me home
Got no friend but a
Lonely winding road

War resounds as legends fall
Beaten by a twisted laughing clown
All my sins will disappear
Never cared for my fellow men

And the sun won't shine no more
And the sky a blackened dome
No stars to guide me home
I got no friend but a
Lonely winding road
