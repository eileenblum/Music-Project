The sky is crying genocide
Mother nature bleeding dry
Rivers running black with disease
All because of human greed

Take a little time
And look around
What did we do
To our paradise?

I see a black dawn rising
Can we turn the tide?
Is it too late?
Or can we turn the tide?

The children of tomorrow
will be the victims of our crimes
Let's make a change, do what's right
Before we run out of time

Just take a little time
And look around
What did we do
To our paradise?

I see a black dawn rising
Can we turn the tide?
Is it a light?
Is it a light to turn the tide?

Take a little time
And look around
What did we do
To our paradise?

I see a black dawn rising
Can we turn the tide?
Is it too late?
Or can we turn the tide?
Is it too late? Oh
