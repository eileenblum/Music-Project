When you think i'm going out
I will rise up again
Gonna rain on your parade
Steal your thunder, make you pray

Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolf

All this time i've been away
You'll be joyed, what is mine
Here i am by hand of fate
You damned fool, i pity you

Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolf

Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolf
Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolf
