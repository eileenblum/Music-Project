You choose to dive into this nothingness
while I try to swim against the stream

Listen to my inner voice
feel it caress my soul

Dream away in a magic spell
I will not fall apart under the oak
Yeah loose my mind
she can't belive that it is right

We run, we die
desperation in our eyes

Reach out for the opportunity
or fall down in fear
squeeze my pillow tight
longing back

My eyes are the same
even as a child I could see
a glimt of the road

Yeah loose my mind
she can't belive that it is right
