Feel betrayed,... as I sit here cold and tired
It seems that what I valued before
has been eaten cold by a ghost

Deeds, what's to gain here
I want to kill myself
but I ain't got the guts... yet

Ice cold, even the smoke cuts cold
Mother, father, brother, sister
you don't understand me
'cos how could you...
When I can't

You bastards
Blind laughters I miss my home

Sick, feel sick
can't eat more of your shit
You are a decieving liar
and I am a mistrusting fire
Nowhere to go but home
