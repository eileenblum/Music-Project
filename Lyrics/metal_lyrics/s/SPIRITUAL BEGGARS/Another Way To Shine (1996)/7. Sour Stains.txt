When the day is over
and I've fed my kama
When "...the wind cries Mary"
...Lingers on

Feels like I'm walking in water
anguished water
With twisted emotions
I drink my wine

When th eday is over
I feel confused mum
Wish I could be happy
wish I could put trust in love

Red wine on my tongue
good feelings linger on
I kiss the naked wind of love
with sour stains on my heart

When the day is over
and I've fed my kama
Fear sneaks up on me
wondering who am I
