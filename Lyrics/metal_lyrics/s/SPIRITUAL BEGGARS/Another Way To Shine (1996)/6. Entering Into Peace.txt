We have passed stars and moons walked through the storming rain
shared the same pain
A three of life our holy trinity
Never thought I be wishing for eternity
Oh you read me like an open book
I was running like a wounded animal
You showed your love for me to see
This woman has set me free
The soil is our blood
May our roots grow thick and strong
I meet you in a sea of dreams
MoonLady I love you
