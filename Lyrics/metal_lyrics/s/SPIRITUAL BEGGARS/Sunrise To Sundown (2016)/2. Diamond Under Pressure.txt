You build these walls around you
Turn your back on the world
You let your fears surround you
It's such a shame to see

Staring down the bottle
One shot too many,
She ain't coming back
Any foll can see, it's a losing game
And you know it too

Diamond under pressure
Pick yourself up before you're dead
Diamond under pressure
There's a better road ahead
So come on

One look in your eyes tonight
I see what I needed to know
You've still got, got what it takes
To reclaim the throne

Diamond under pressure
Pick yourself up before you're dead
You're diamond under pressure
There's a better road ahead
So come on

Diamond under pressure
Pick yourself up before you're dead
You're diamond under pressure
There's a better road ahead
So come on

So come on
