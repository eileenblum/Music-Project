Liar
Hatred is what you sow
In your self-righteous way
You knot yourself the rope but cut it through
And rise anew
Every single day
Your hatred heralds our demise

Would you take me by my hand to bear another day?
Should we do it all again? I would do it again
Couldn't fill the void inside me any other way
I would do it again

Never
Could this distress decay
In the end you'll see
Your scorn would never en
Perseverance
Our coherence
Brings us to our knees
Our hatred heralds our demise

Won't fade away
Never face a brighter day
No end in sight
Stuck in our perpetual fight
I'll tear it down tonight
