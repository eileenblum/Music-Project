They carry on a thousand cries
They suffer unto fear and strife
But their hatred bred for much too long
'Cause vengeance's strong

And as the sun ascends again
We free ourselves from enmity
Can't take it all but by my soul

Heavy air is all I breathe
Vermillion soil under my feet
Feel a thousand vultures underneath
Lurk their feast

And as the sun ascends again
We free ourselves from enmity
A thousand vultures underneath
In enmity
We won't leave this end
Can't take it all but by my soul

Descent
Hold your breath and take my hand
You'll stand before your god, in darkness we'll descend
