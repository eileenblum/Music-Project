Torn apart
You sheathe this blade into our heart
They ascend
Acclaiming strife until the end

To see this ancient haunted grey
I will never be the same
Sick and tired
Drowning face forward in your lies
Face the end of days
For you will set our world ablaze

We're undaunted
Too dead inside
To quench the light
Doomed to lose it all in strife
I can't waste another life
Just sick and tired
I'll burn it all tonight
