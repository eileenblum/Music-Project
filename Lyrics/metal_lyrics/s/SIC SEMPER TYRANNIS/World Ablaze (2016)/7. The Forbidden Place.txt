Feel the very sweetest sin
As it slides gently across your skin
You fail yourself again and again
Not only every now and then.
You have left it all and locked the door
You're filled with hate and rotten to the core
You hate them all but you hate yourself more
Being alone is what you despise yourself for

'Cause we don't care as the world burns down
We seal our hearts and stand our ground
We're in the forbidden place you and I
And we'll be right here till the day we die

Feel the vultures circling above
Surrendering life that you've been dreaming of
You fail yourself again and again
Not only every now and then
You have left it all and locked the door
You're filled with hate and rotten to the core
You hate them all but you hate yourself more
Being alone is what you despise yourself for
