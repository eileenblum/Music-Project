Another round
Let this be just the last condemnation
Behold me lying dead inside
Can't take me down
Still facing your justification
I could not see the end is nigh

Can I be infested by these lies
Bearing just another day?
Will I be the last one who denies this final round?
I'm falling stricken to the ground

Let's face it now
We're standing upon this desolation
There's no way left we could deny
Cause I'm the one
Who threw us unto this damnation
I could not see the end is nigh

Can I be infested by these lies
Bearing just another day?
Will I be the last one who denies this final round?
I'm falling stricken to the ground

Can I bear it for another day?
I'd bury it in you
Heart's still beating, dead inside
I bury it in you
