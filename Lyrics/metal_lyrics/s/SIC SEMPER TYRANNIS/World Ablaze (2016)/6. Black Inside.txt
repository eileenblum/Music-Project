The fatal solution
Just as these Muppets used to dance
Not only martyrs would die alone
Come and behold this final chance

Holding fast unto this grey
No more light may guide my day
I've been infested by this light
Now I'm dwelling black inside

It's death's retribution
All of my colours burst into grey
And as they're fading there all alone
Never coming back again
Holding fast unto this grey
No more light may guide my day
I've been infested by this light
Now I'm dwelling black inside
