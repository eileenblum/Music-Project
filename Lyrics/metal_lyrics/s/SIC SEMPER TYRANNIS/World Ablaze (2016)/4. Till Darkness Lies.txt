Not in vein
Don't let them hold me down
My demise, deep inside
Cannot undo
Those lies that dwell in me
I can't see no other way
As they spilled blood that night
Death in vein
Killing me, breaking me deep inside
But we won't give in till your demise
And fight this time

Bright tonight, still I can't see through blinded eyes
If I accept these lies, I'd die inside
To feel the pain till darkness lies

End of this pain
And I would wait for them
No more tears, no more fears
Breaking me down
Those vicious dreams grow tall
All my life, they shall stay
Cannot break down
