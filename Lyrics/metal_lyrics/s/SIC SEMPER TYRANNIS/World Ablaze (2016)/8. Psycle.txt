This is my past that drips
Can you taste it on your lips?
This is the sweet on your skin
Released what's held deep within
You slowly slip away into my domain
So sweet when slowly your life I drain

Innocence smells so fucking good
Something I never really understood.
Could you smile for me, if you could?
Please smile for me, if you would

Something somewhere went wrong with me
Sometimes I'd rather not be me
Something somewhere made me fall ill
I need something for this â this hole to fill

Get out of my head, don't fail me
Take me with you for a ride
Then you will know me so very soon
I slowly made you slip into my domain
So nigh is the time that your life I drain

Innocence tastes so fucking good
Something I never really understood
Could you smile for me, if you could?
Please smile for me, if you would
