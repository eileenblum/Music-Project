No heart left to beat,
No pulse racing, behold the debris of all fears swept away.
Why would you fail us oh so miserably?
Watch us falling, crashing down.

As we drown we'll be wasting not a single round until you waste away.

Am I lying?
I can't tell no more.
Set me free.
Lying, there'll be no end.

All our hopes withdrawn
Let the champion decide your fate.

Still the race goes on.
So tell me, was it ever worth the wait?
As our last hopes come crashing down.

All around they are fading into the void of sound.
The voice that we betrayed

Am I lying?
I can't tell no more.
Set me free.
Lying, we can't pretend

They're not dying, lost forevermore.
We will be trying until the end.
