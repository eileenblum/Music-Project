With no sound
You are fading into darkness left to drown
Inside of your own fears.

With a heart of stone
You're left facing your own nightmares all alone
Spilling your last tears.

Can't hold on to something
Innocent yet blind.
When did I lose my mind?

Before the end, I knew nothing
Of the price I'd have to pay:
That in the end I would lead
The blade you run through me.

So with my last breath
I hold on to my lost thoughts I once possessed.
I never saw this clear:

That the edge you held
Would sweep everything away that we held dear.
Draining my last tears.

Can't hold on to something
Innocent yet blind.
When did I lose my mind?

When you finally felt something,
'Twas only then, it made you see
That your own blood would sheathe
The blade you ran through me.

I could not see
The blade you ran through me.
I took you for granted
So in tears you made me pay.

You fade away
In sorrow and dismay
And forever you will stay.

Through your last tears
I seek a single way
To overcome my fears.

If I could see
Into this world of yours
Would I find my way

To make you stay
With me forever?
But never.
