So I'm facing just another of these days
My friend
I've seen it all before
But you can't raise your head and say a word
But I do
I've done it all before
I cannot rest anymore

Take me away
Silence has come
Come here to lead us all astray

I've come to understand
Solitude will never end
Only thing that's real
Silence has lost its appeal

Facing what's in you
What they said was never true
I will break this wheel
Silence has lost its appeal

So together we are standing on the edge
My friend
I've been here all before
Still you won't raise your fist and and make them hurt but I do
I've done it all before
Straight out of hell I will soar
