And so
A dream tonight in my head
I cannot make it right

Your transgression reveals (my) disguise
Join me tonight

I can't take it for another day
I am en route to hell anyway
Disrobing me you endlessly despise
Me gently as I close your eyes

Pulse racing
Scarlet disguise
That's when I made you close your eyes

And I watched her lie in my bed
Wish you were her instead

Your discretion reveals these lies
Join me tonight
