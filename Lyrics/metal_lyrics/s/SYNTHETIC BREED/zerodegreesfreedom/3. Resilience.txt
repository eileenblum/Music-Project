As I read between the lines
Discordance is pushed further away
Slowly
Itâs slipping away from me
I see the answer behind two closed eyes
Can I ever discover a true
Reason for why I am here
Iâm reaching out to claim forsaken dreams
What I ever hoped to achieve
Only I posess
Infinite methods of madness of this dying dimension
Erasing empathy
Still I count the hours Iâve wasted
Searching for a new way to escape from the pain spreading out
Infecting all that Iâve become
My vital signs draining leeching from my skin functionality undefined
Absent from reality

Stay
Could we stay
This will be forgotten over time
All alone
On our own
We stay
Would we stay
Leaving all the pain so far behind
All alone
On our own
My pain
Its never ending curse
Endless suffering
Through this existence
Consistently received
In time
So many times
I have felt myself falling away
Departure from my body
I donât want anyone to tell me
This disgrace Iâve created
Discard this empty vessel
Iâm in hell
My broken shell
Wonât hold together anymore

Stay
Could we stay
This will be forgotten over time
All alone
Weâre on our own
We stay
Would we stay
Leaving all the pain so far behind
All alone
Weâre on our own
