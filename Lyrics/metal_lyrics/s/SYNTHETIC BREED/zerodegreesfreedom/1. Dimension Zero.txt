Inhale the void
And try to sustain the feeble
Heartbeat that pulses within
We canât breathe here
We canât exist here
Canât exist
We have desecrated the material cycle
Tainted these immortal structures
What a waste
What a travesty
We are the violated
We are a glitch in the
Cosmic blueprint, pure irony
Disassemble this plane
Thereâs no way to return
This dimension is corrupted
Resistence, a futile endeavour
Destroy the tangible self
Existence as a carbon based form
Is our antithises
A void heard swan song
Echoing out across the eons
Echoing to take us all
The cycle begins again
Structures to radicals
Warring with the tennants of science
Disassemble the forces at work
Manipulate the frequencies
Incinerate, recreate, invalidate

Whenever there is a need for absolute silence, you all speak. And when there is need of speech, you
remain as silent as the void. When you are present in this moment you desire nothing more than to be
absent, yet when absent you cry out in despair. In peace you formulate war, yet while warring you
desire peace. In your mind, you descant on bravery and strength yet in this battle you tremble

We are the violated
We are a glitch in the
Cosmic blueprint, pure irony
Disassemble this plane
Thereâs no way to return
This dimension is corrupted
Resistence, a futile endeavour
Sentience is the antithises of evolution
Crush this structure so we may no longer feel
Reanimate this form
A grotesque marionette
Kneel and disconnect
Disconnect from the cycle
Corrupt the strings, contaminate
Our frequencies distorted
In an agonised symphony
We embody the event horizon
