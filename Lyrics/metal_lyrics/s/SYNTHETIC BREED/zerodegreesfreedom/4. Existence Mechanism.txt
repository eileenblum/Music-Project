Disperse through the subatomic field
You matter hungry parasite
Be gone from the conscious collective
You have nothing to offer anymore
Remember when I watched you twist
The strings of your own pathetic existence
Itâs only a matter of time till
Youâre crushed by the void within
You have wandered too far, too far
Will you ever see the error of your ways
Never
You are the embodiment of darkness and light
A functional paradox
A non-existent entity
I witnessed you crawl from the threshold of chaos
A twisted wreck
Reeling from your ill-educated views
Collapsing around you
Remaining here, an impossibility
Shed the delusions
Embrace the quantum field
Destroy
Destroy
Destroy your form
Dissipate into the aether medium
Cast yourself yourself into yet another disproven theory
Hold to it
Alter it
Make it your reality
Your molecular deconstruction
Bleeds electricity into formless voids
You savage malfunction of the existence mechanism
You have wandered too far, too far
Will you ever see the error of your ways
Never
You have wandered too far, too far
Will you ever see the error of your ways
Never
Youâre nothing
Itâs all you could ever be
