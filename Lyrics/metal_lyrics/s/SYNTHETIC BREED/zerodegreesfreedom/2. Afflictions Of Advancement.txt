Voiceless violence suffer in silence
Forced
Complications
Subjectively
Reformatted
Taken over
Run the program
When will the pain ever end
So gullible
Youâre spoon fed all of the lies
And believe what they all say
I try to look inside
For the part of me that cares anymore
From within I feel nothing
Forced
Complications
Subjectively
Andreformatted
Taken over
Run the program
When will the pain ever end
So many faces
Were are all expressionless weâre shutting down
We are the braindead
No longer relevant
No longer functional
So take my hand
Tell me
What do you see
Is this what we least expected
To be forever connected
We could get away
From this place so follow me
Just trust in your soul to make the change
Now open your eyes
Synthetic cells rearranging
Contorting my view
For ever skewed
Lays to waste
All that I am
From within I feel nothing at all
Iâm feeling nothing
Iâm feeling nothing at all
Realisation
No reawakens
Thing redefining
To lost connections
Feel nano systems
In feeding science
Side mechanations
Me we never asked for this
We never needed it
We never needed this burden
So take my hand
Tell me
What do you see
Is this what we least expected
To be forever connected
We could get away
From this place so follow me
Just trust in your soul to make the change
Now open your eyes
Individual
Code implanted
Thought conditioned
Filtered
Mind distorted
Human structure
Fragmented
