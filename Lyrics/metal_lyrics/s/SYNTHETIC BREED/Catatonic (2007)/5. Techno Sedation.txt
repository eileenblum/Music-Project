Master becomes subservient to creation
Intended to entertain
Pleasure devices control the game the tables have turned
To their favour against our own will new electronic generation
Disables the human population
Sterile stimulating by inner piercing plugged in sedation
We are soiled consumer society tranquillised by intolerable aberrations
Electric signal pauses beneath the iceberg's tip incapable of moving forward
Without it's aid
Consuming our reality draining meaning no more life time heals no wounds old lies new ties
Our species is able to harvest life playing god
Creating hybrids the biggest mistake a pledge to learn
Push the envelope of insecurity marxist claims
We are a product of our labour
In this new light were simply a tool
Cogs in the wheel of evolution
The most complex organisms are primitive inordinate collectivism now
Our technology improving
Without (consuming)
Techno sedation
Spirituality (reality) producing (consuming) dehumanization (reality)
Docile connection
Master becomes subservient
It's creation paralysed the cores centre
Consuming our reality draining meaning no more life master becomes subservient paralysed
Next generation will be
An equation the synthesis incapable of emotion no soul
Humans lose humanity through progressions and were bleeding now
Consuming our reality draining meaning no more life master become subservient paralysed core
