Social visions determine thoughts
Assimilated data controlling minds
Choke on poison pills habit redefines systemised to narrow lines
And never outside square confines
Break down our capability
Limitations deterring what could be
Burn submission turn away don't be trapped create integrity
Shut down crush the machine (now)
Downsized democracy constructed class lines
Optionless modal categories defining our existence
We're all chained an obscure percentile of free thinkers found the answer
Shut down crush the machine
Altogether adhering taught not to question the axiom brain trained to a melody reoccurring thought patterns
My degradation
My soul is suffering soul is suffering negative
My soul is suffering soul is suffering the negative
I stand up high fist in the sky and I defy I'm unafraid of everybody
Time now to lead the human race
Right to be free from control
Block the money whores of imposition
I'm emancipating the clutch hold my life dear to me I wont let you bludgeon my integrity
No more restraint
Ever pressing
Breaking the chains with my limbs let go
Altogether adhering taught not to question the axiom brain trained to a melody reoccurring thought patterns
Rise above the simpletons
Strive for a new future to set us free don't be numb
To what stands before you open fire spill out thoughts from beyond
Don't be numb
Objects of your mind lifelines
Drowning the mind distort self corrosive supply materialism drowning the mind wonât let you corrode my life or survive
Altogether adhering taught not to question the axiom brain trained to a melody reoccurring thought patterns
Shut down crush the social machine
