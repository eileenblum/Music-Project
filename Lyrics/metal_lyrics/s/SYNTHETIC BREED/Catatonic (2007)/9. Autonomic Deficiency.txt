Remodified reality science now controlling our mindâs chemistry genetical prototypes
Or superior breed deleted memory incomplete reality
Turn the wheel
We are all
Expendable obsolesce
Hand of fate
For the ever changing god recreates
Autonomic deficiency
Autonomic defeciency mind deleted memory incomplete reality
Submission the unatural pattern overcome to replace
Fractal illusions of our himan race
Must I deny self and soul
Finally itâs clear to see Iâm disgraced
My eyes realise Iâm alone
Will I ever remember?
Never awaken
My mind has been taken away
Why am I the only one elevated?
Iâm standing tall
Iâll never be what they want me to be Iâll be the last one left to fall
We are suffocating
Asphyxiating in our own flesh
Unfamiliar artificial mesh holds us together everyone seperated every soul contaminated under the impression
This is now we have to be not ok
Couldnât give a damn anyway
Itâs all youâll ever see
A new regression
The systematic sedation through progression
Now our inception simulated resurrection replicated
Intellect
Incorrect and defective all I need is to see a new reality rearranged uncontained
Total freedom
Watch and learn as I burn
The opposition to the ground take back tomorrow
A new regression
The systematic sedation through progression
Now our inception simulated resurrection replicated
Must I deny self and soul
Finally itâs clear to see Iâm disgraced
My eyes realise Iâm alone
Will I ever remember?
Never awaken
My mind has been taken away
Must I deny self and soul
Future replication
Generates the answer
Finally itâs clear to see Iâm disgraced
My eyes realise Iâm alone
Future replication generates the answer will I ever remember?
Never awaken
My mind has been taken
Taken away
