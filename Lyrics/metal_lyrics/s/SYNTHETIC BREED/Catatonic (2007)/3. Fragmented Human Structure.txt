There is danger in both belief and unbelief

Suffocated all reasoningÂ 
The plague remainsÂ 
Betrayed by self convictionÂ 
My disguise of sanity slips, it falls away
Broken shell of this existence
The seeds of doubt are sewn, this life Iâve known is torn apart

You, in your reflectionÂ 
Fragmented, incompleteÂ 
Divided in shadows you hide
Focus magnified
Embrace the hurting
When all thatâs left insideâs corroding
Bleeding from me
Dreams of genocide, the suicidal adverse cogitation embracing my self-evisceration

Mirror of normality
A sea of alienation floods my soulÂ 
Broken pieces of reality
My life I live
I live my loss
My will to stay alive
Slowly dying
I see no hope for me
Now that this insanity
Itâs taken over me
I am my own worst enemy
Try to start things anew
I know Iâve got to make it throughÂ 
Itâs time to face the truth
Take my pain away

You, in your reflectionÂ 
Fragmented, IncompleteÂ 
Divided in shadows you hide
Focus magnified
Embrace the hurting
When all thatâs left insideâs corroding
Bleeding from me
Itâs cutting from the inside out is my world
Bleeding from me

There is no more positivity to extract, no deluded optimistic mindsetÂ 
Only pain, the realisation of the uncontrollable, the unbelievable
And the inevitable fact that my suffering will soon be felt by everyone

Nothing is left for me
Some things are meant to beÂ 
Nothing is left for me
Some things are meant to beÂ 
No more regrets
No one is there for me

You, in your reflectionÂ 
Fragmented, IncompleteÂ 
Divided in shadows you hide
Focus magnified
Embrace the hurting
When all thatâs left insideâs corroding
Bleeding from me
Itâs cutting from the inside out is my world
Bleeding from me
