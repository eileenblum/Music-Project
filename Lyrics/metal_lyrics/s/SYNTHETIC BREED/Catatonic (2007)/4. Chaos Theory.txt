Paralysed in fear
From what stands before me science cannot comprehend formulated chaotic theories
Only see in black and white
Just digits on the screen
It's not the number
It's what between the numbers
It's not the light shining down
It's energy a golden ratio
There is only one language spoken throughout the universe numbers are the spirals of life
Paralysed in fear
From what stands before me science cannot comprehend formulated chaotic theories
Only see in black and white
Searching...why don't you just give up looking... for an answer that could kill me
I'm not interested in your petty materialism
As it doesn't satisfy at the end of the day
I'm just wanting to understand our own world through logic and discover answers to the unknown
Paralysed in fear
From what stands before me science cannot comprehend formulated chaos
No more denial
We're wasting existence searching for comfort in the end meaningless
Metamorphosis
I emerge from a chrysalis
A new born knowledge beyond all comprehension but at what cost have I sacrificed
All that is sacred to me?
Searching...why don"t you just give up looking... for an answer that could kill me
Paralysed in fear
From what stands before me science cannot comprehend formulated chaos
No more denial
We're wasting existence searching for comfort in the end meaningless
Order from chaos
My mind is unstable everybody's so wrong or am I the only one? order from chaos
My mind is unstable everybody's so wrong or am I the only one?
Chaos
I'm the only one am I the only one?
Only see in black and white
Order from chaos
My mind is unstable everybody's so wrong or am I the only one? order from chaos
My mind is unstable everybody's so wrong or am I the only one?
