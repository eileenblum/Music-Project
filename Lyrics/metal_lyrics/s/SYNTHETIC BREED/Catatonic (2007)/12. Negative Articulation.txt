What am I in this life I spiral down in a circle
I'm out of control cant break the cycle
So direction less my life gets lost in the haze around me
God knows no one is going to save me now
This is my flawed perception
Never will I hide whats inside I just cant break through this time self sufficiency my worst enemy
What am I I'm like you
Was this life what we chose sorry I cant recall wanting this burden
Are we not the same
People underneath the flesh after all
Were all pawns in the game but never asked for this
Wrong way
Turn back around
And relocate
Distant recollections persisting calling our names
So relocate
Information understanding
Taken away everybody's freedom of thought
And if your thinking that because your still breathing
And your alive your living a lie
Trading dreams to comfort for what
To be a mindless drone in the system
Fabricated life pull the strings on conformity controlling our every numb action until we cut them away
Was this life what we chose sorry I cant recall wanting this burden
Are we not the same
People underneath the flesh after all
Were all pawns in the game but never asked for this
Wrong way
Turn back around
And relocate
Distant recollections persisting calling our names
So relocate
