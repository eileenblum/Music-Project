Chamber of the mind shell holds time
Neuro connectivity
The development of the divine menial task of life analyse and engage in the complexity of infinity
The struggle to reclaim our foresight see myself within from the out
Tortured by emptiness this void called me
I manifest the nothing
Have I enslaved myself to this
Deep dissolution now am I cocooned awaiting neuro visions of true clarity
I, in out and beyond it now
Shut out
Flowing down separate myself transmigrating leaving
Set free
From the grip of the holding cell to become a frequency
Received by human receptors
See myself within from the out
Tortured by emptiness this void called me I manifest the nothing
Have I enslaved myself to this
Deep dissolution now am I cocooned awaiting neuro visions of true clarity
I, in out and beyond it now
Shut out
Flowing down separate myself transmigrating leaving
Floating in the current of void I see within i'm pushed now by neuro connectivity
Sweeping me to my insanity
I see within i'm pushed now by neuro connectivity
Set free
From the grip of the holding cell to become a frequency
Received by human receptors
I, in out and beyond it now
Shut out
Flowing down separate myself transmigrating leaving
