Thought disintergrating defy evolution technological advances species simulated genetically corrected past the point of no return now i see what i am
Moulded into a tool
Human mind is under control social conditioning
No turning back
All the lies we are fed
The facts remain
No more time
Conciously enslaved weâre all blind
Simulated inception
Technology brings no hope follow conformity
Forget weâre already dead
The manipulated soul
Future forsaken already dead
No time for ignorance so blind forever
No time for innocence so blind forever
No time for apathy
So blind forever
No time for dignity
So blind following the blind
Alienate emotion
Seperated through distrust propagation rejected
State of mind the choice is lost disconnected in distress individuality dissipate our conciousness
Salvation seems so distant now
Evolution of the collective mechanism
Mind is now in effect sciencehas given licence
To change and influence the human brain
With extreme precision through alterations
Of our intellect
Individual actions and emotions become obsolete over time citizen behaviour
Becomes bio-chemically stratified
And now you feel it
Living the new nightmare
No oneâs escaping
No waking up from this world you feel it
Live the new nightmare
No oneâs escaping
No waking up from this world
The last great frontier
Is being explored and mapped via electronic stimulation
The once human being
Is simply the cheapest
And most efficient of machines
To create and operate
Micromanipulations control an anesthetised
State of existence sense of self now the greatest myth
Of mankind
