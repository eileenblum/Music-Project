Some things in this life are better off just left behind
And all these fears and doubts my anxieties almost forgotten
The part of me that was you is now severed
Cut out
And I canât help but feel my emotions entombed
Bear witness as I inflict my hatred upon you
Mirror mirror
I thought the day would never come
The day I could see
The defing hate in my
Devaluation of your sense of worth
Obtained

I am
Cut open and bleeding
Iâm conflicted
Is it only agony who
Whispers my name
The last essence
Of my true reflection remains
Sustained
Tongues ripper from the root
Eyes stitched shut
Iâm deaf to your pathetic cry for mercy
Mirror mirror

Iâm disconnected from you
Indifferent to all your games youâre to blame
Whoever gave you the right to play the victim
Thereâs nothing left to gain here
It feels like
Iâm disconnected from you
Iâm rejected and broken in two itâs ok
Tonight will be the last time you break me I swear itâs over
Unaffected by the tears of loss and your deceitful smile
Lately it seems all thatâs good inside just turns to decay
Discover the illusion
Defines you
Unveil your deluded self
For all to see
Iâm disconnected from you

Indifferent to all your games youâre to blame
Whoever gave you the right to play the victim
Thereâs nothing left to gain here
It feels like
Iâm disconnected from you
A slight deception I couldnât see through itâs ok
Tonight will be the last time you break me I swear itâs over

My trust was misplaced in you
How could I be so deceived by you
Ive gone so far away from this life
I canât hear a word youâre saying
Forever in my escape from this life
How could we ever let this get so cold
My perception scattered in red
All of the psychotic voices screaming inside my head
I canât separate
Anymore

So disconnected
So disconnected
Far from this place
From everything
Iâm disconnected
So disconnected
Far from this life
So far away from this place
