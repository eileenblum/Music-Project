Closer feel it creeping
Redivining
Slowly creeping closer

Time is stagnated
Illuminated
Waits to show us a sign
Recirculated through the darkests of hours inside
My worlds are colliding

Tomorrow your pride
You swallow
Victimised
And defiled
To one inch of your life

You persistant so deceiving
I just canât believe
Where does this existence begin
Beyond the sphere of reason

Focus
Visions youâll never explain
Feel the embrace
I know weâll never be the same

Wading in the sea of all my weak excuses
The shoreline obscured
Itâs blurring as it fades away into subreality
Iâm submerged
By the design

So follow me
You follow
Break the restraints
Burn your old ways
Disconstructed remoulded
Can you understand
Itâs a crime
Emotionlessness maintained through
Manipulating the world

You persistant so deceiving
I just canât believe
Where does this existence begin
Beyond the sphere of reason
