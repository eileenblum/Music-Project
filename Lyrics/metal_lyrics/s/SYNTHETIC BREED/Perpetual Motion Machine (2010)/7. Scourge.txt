Drown in your despair
Sorrow

Burning through my eyes
All colours bleeding together
Unrelenting process of complexity
Immoral devastation, a faceless sensation
Of this stagnant life
Bringing me undone again

New desire unleashed on us
The unsuspecting masses
So expendable, why can't you see
We will be the ones suffer into submission
How could i be stripped of my humanity ?

We drown in despair
We're sinking inside
Through all the things we've lost
There'll be no way to forget
There is nothing left
We drown in despair
We're sinking inside
Now everything is gone
There'll be nothing but regret
There's nothing inside

Self inflected ruin, our rise of depravity
We are condemned forever

Inside this empty space
We wait to face our future
Cast a blind eye to the unknown eradication
Of us all
There's no erasing
Only assimilating
We all played our part
In creating our insidious existence

Drown in your despair

We drown in despair
We're sinking inside
Through all the things we've lost
There'll be no way to forget
There is nothing left

We drown in despair
We're sinking inside
Through all the things we've lost
There'll be no way to forget
There is nothing left
As we drown in despair
We're sinking inside
Now everything is gone
There'll be no thing but regret
There's nothing left inside
