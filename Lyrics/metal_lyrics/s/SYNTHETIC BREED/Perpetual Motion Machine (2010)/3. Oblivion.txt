Just a simple solution that
You'll never find
You're following blindly but got left behind
When will you wake up?
The consequence and reaction
That you will never see
Their insecurities I try to hide inside me

Hollow people
Slaves to no life
Empty people
Living a lie

A slow descent
Reaching out to drag you in
Will you repent
All sin
Keep your faith
Far beyond all reasoning
Unto the end
Just kill your God

Shamed and degraded
The light has faded
Forever mistaken
Never awaken
Salvation
Bow down to the new
Lie

Yeah you still believe
Ignore the contradictions
Well, are we so naive
So
I'm still deceived
So pity me
You will be chosen come the final judgement
Right

Try to understand
If you can
See we're so dead in this skin
Still they remain
True to illusion

Pseudoscience hides behind reason
Rational thought corrupted
Pseudoscience masks the true knowledge
Focus
Just let it all go

Let go
Kill your God

Hollow people
Slaves to no life
Empty people
Living a lie

Search for your God.
