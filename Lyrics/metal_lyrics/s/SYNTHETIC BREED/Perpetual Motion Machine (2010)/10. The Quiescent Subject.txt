So pure
In deathâs lonely embrace that shuts out the day prying eyes remain unseen
Bereft of all hopes sheâs patiently waiting
For her inevitable conclusion
Red
Liquid displaying
Such
Suffering her finest work
That was so thoughtlessly spilled out
Blonde crimson soaked hair rests on her pretty face the gift of agony
She
Takes
She takes
Silence surrounding you
It feels like youâre dreaming
Silence surrounding you
And it feels like youâre breathing again
Lifeless, she hopelessly lost her own way in realityâs
Deadly illusion
Could empty promises ever be gained
A victim in her
Life
Moments of suffering in medicated nightmares never kill the pain 
Moments of suffering in medicated nightmares never to awaken
Silence surrounding you
It feels like youâre dreaming
Silence surrounding you
And it feels like youâre breathing again silence surrounding you
It feels like youâre dreaming
Silence surrounding you
And it feels like youâre breathing again
