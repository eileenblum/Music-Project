Inside in this moment
Iâm infiltrated by the sickness of my life
Suffering in my punishment alone
In the unknown
The hopes and dreams of human nature dies
Desecrated defiled removed de-sanctified
Future unwritten fate unseen
Justified by your ignorance
Destroy all conscious thought
Kill
Our future unwritten fate unseen
Purified underneath the skin
Destroy
Embrace the sickness
Kill
Reciprocated
Enslavement blackens my sight
Kept in the darkness never see the lies
A prisoner defiled by this parasitic life
Shot down in silence
The cataclysm of the entity
Deep within sensing a helpless state of despair
Reciprocated damnation
In my life
In time
I just canât fight against this anymore
So deliver me from this repetition
And release me from this
Its clenching grip
To delete all traces of the shape of our humanity
Delete it
Ashamed
Gone
Erased
Reciprocated damnation
