Break away
Separate
Become the illusion
Break away
Separate
Become the illusion
So unrecognisable to myself
Have I sold my soul?
Underneath thereâs still breathing
Absence of meaning unraveling
I contextualise my nihilistic ways
Hate burning from the inside
My now corrupted blood flows within
I choke
Itâs gagging my senses
My expectations falling down
So now who am I?
My complete separation
To wallow in the pity
Break away
Separate
Become the illusion
Break away
Separate
Become the illusion
A rancid stench of ignorance permiates right into the bone
Obvious
A generation shamed and corrupted
Am I suffering?
My expectations falling down
So now who am I?
My complete separation
To wallow in the pity
Become the illusion
To see yourself mirror of thyself
Going insane will never be the same again
Youâll bleed out slowly weâll be wasted
Open the vein
Just bleed
My expectations falling down
So now who am I?
My complete separation
To wallow in the pity
Break away
From your sins become the illusion
