Primary biophysical structure remodified
Internal linear chains
Links in my cellular abduction
Now I'm paralysed
Non covalently predicated
I self assemble
Artificial machinations inside
Byzantine changes
Systematic process
Advances into nothing
We're going nowhere fast
Microsporadic invasion of contagious cells
Concieved augmentation
Resistance futile
Auto immune system
Overrun compromised
Self and non self
Indivisible
In this synthesis of science of soul
Iâm violated
Iâm out of control
Redividing
My very being
Replicating this life
Will we live to see
Our time characterised
By steady degredation
Coexistence in dysfunction
Replaced
Redesigned
Rewired
Reprogrammed
Integrated
As we watch
All of the world goes under
We cant stop the rising tide
Still you strive to find the reason
But never ask yourself
Why
Why
You never ask yourself one question
It makes no difference anymore
Replaced
Redesigned
Rewired
Reprogrammed
Replaced your god
Redesigned your life
Rewired your soul
Reprogrammed
