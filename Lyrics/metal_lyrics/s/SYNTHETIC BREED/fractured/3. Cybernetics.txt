Cybernetics
Merger between two worlds
Biologic and mechanical spheres collide
As a result the new breed is created
That is superior to anything we know
Human beings created the machine
And the machines create themselves
Is this artificial intelligence or simply intellect?
A.I. is something that I.A.created
Technology within our genetics
Comparative study of mechs and mankind
Dissecting familiar artificial systems
How long can we inhibit this process
They are designed to control themselves
A.I. is something that I.A.created
Technology within our genetics
A.I. is something that I.A.created
Machine code within schematics
Cannot escape so wake up from so called reality
You have no soul you're a machine
Incapable of producing thought
Breeding drone beings
Perfection deformed
No more steps towards the end
Artificial hearts nature departs
Tissue is weak and withers away
Cyborgs mechanic organisms
Version 2.0
Humanity the biologic element
Created in the same way machines were born
Therefore I am god to the next wave
Cannot escape so wake up from so called reality
You're just a number a silent figure
Get back in line it's not you're turn
And it never will be
Breeding drone beings
Perfection deformed
No steps forward
It's just circular
Life in cycles
Humans disposed
Borgs will take our place
In the next wave of evolution
Eradicate your own god
We forget we're simply animals
Primal and useless
Breeding drone beings
Perfection deformed
We never realise the consequences of our actions
One step forward two steps back
One step forward ten steps back
