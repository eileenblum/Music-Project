Stumble
Falling through forever
Planetary sickness
Shut out in the shadows
Rediscover
Move in empty space
Sensing but can not feel
This place pulled out from underneath
Sorrow
Preaching egocentric
Theology accepted
For the inequitable
Illusion is now complete
Futile efforts work in vain
Searching for peace of mind
False claims take the pain deliver us from our sin
Test subjects ingest history
To see our world with blinded eyes
Oblivious souls mesmerised
Bioorganic origins bound
To a post modern society
Infiltrate in continuity
Destiny brings self destruction
Suffer
Genetic segregation
Systematic wreckage
Sinks into the waters
Suffocating the mind
You will hear the haunting truth
In states of indifference
Hold on to your life when pertinence is lost
Test subjects ingest novelty
To see our world with blinded eyes
Oblivious souls hypnotised
New synthetic formulas found
Chemicals counterbalancing the pathogenesis
Spreading like a plague no equilibrium
Prototypes of a silicon caste
We're nothing our cells evolving still
We're existing now self's dissolving us
Holding on it's all gone
Opening eyes
Completely mesmerised
Were hypnotised
And dead inside
It's all gone
Opening eyes
Completely mesmerized
Were hypnotized
And dead inside
(watch as our world dies)
