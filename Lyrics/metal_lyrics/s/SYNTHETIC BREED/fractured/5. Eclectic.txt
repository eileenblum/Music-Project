Day by day
Trapped inside police state authority\
Drain all thoughts and struggle
A nation gripped by fear
I'm insane enslaved by these thoughts
Forced fed lies exist in demise
Disgraced I'm torn in tragedy
World will fall forever at war
Aim to destroy society
Broken mind enslaves mankind
Predated throughout history
World will fall forever at war
Aim to destroy society
Day by day we fade away
Fading away
Stain of hate embraces me
Fading away
Drain all thoughts and struggle
A nation gripped by fear
Blame the party an imperialist regime
Creating counter cultural autonomy
From expelling all we know and all we see
War is peace freedom is slavery
Forced fed lies exist in demise
Disgraced I'm torn in tragedy
World will fall forever at war
Aim to destroy society
War is peace ignorance is strength
Broken mind enslaves mankind
Predated throughout history
World will fall forever at war
Aim to destroy society
Drain all thoughts and struggle
A nation gripped by fear
Lies arise
In media generated hypocrisy
Over analysed
Through every waking thought and action
I'm insane
Enslaved by these thoughts
A crime
Destroy this individuals mind
Burn this nightmare
Of negative utopia
Destroy all thoughts
Drain all thoughts and struggle
A nation gripped by fear
No hope for tomorrow
Now our future is here
It's here
Right now
