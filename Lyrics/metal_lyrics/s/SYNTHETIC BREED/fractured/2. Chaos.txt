Paralysed in fear
From what stands before me
Science cannot comprehend
Formulated chaotic theories
Only see in black and white
Just digits on the screen
It's not the number
It's what between the numbers
It's not the light shining down
It's energy a golden ratio
There is only one language spoken throughout the universe
Numbers are the spirals of life
Searching... why don't you just give up
Looking... for an answer that could kill me
I'm not interested in your petty materialism
As it doesn't satisfy at the end of the day
I'm just wanting to understand our own world through logic
And discover answers to the unknown
Paralysed in fear
From what stands before me
Science cannot comprehend
Formulated chaos
No more denial
We're wasting existence
Searching for comfort
In the end meaningless
Metamorphosis
I emerge from a chrysalis
A new born knowledge beyond all comprehension
But at what cost have I sacrificed
All that is sacred to me?
Searching... why don"t you just give up
Looking... for an answer that could kill me
Paralysed in fear
From what stands before me
Science cannot comprehend
Formulated chaos
No more denial
We're wasting existence
Searching for comfort
In the end meaningless
Order from chaos
My mind is unstable
Everybody's so wrong
Or am I the only one?
Order from chaos
My mind is unstable
Everybody's so wrong
Or am I the only one?
Chaos
I'm the only one
Am I the only one?
Only see in black and white
Order from chaos
My mind is unstable
Everybody's so wrong
Or am I the only one?
Order from chaos
My mind is unstable
Everybody's so wrong
Or am I the only one?
