From boredom comes the birth of our meaningless necessities
Repetitious practice of conformity recycled it never ends
Thrives in the majority lies dormant in the minority
Our independence is viewed as catatonic behaviour we're sick
Inflicted guilt (the invalid) a designed message
Fuelled by fear (and doubt still feeding) on the true design
So wrong
Process blinded independence has recommenced
Realization of self unobtainable
Remodify
Exist in the folds of inexistence
Focus of mind
Inflict the message infect
Repeat the message repeat
Admit defeat
Inflicted guilt (the invalid) a designed message
Fuelled by fear (and doubt still feeding) on the true design
So wrong
Remodify focus of mind
Convert the flesh to circuitry
Random expelled from space and time
Expose the core of apathy
Remodify focus of mind
Convert the flesh to circuitry
Random expelled from time and space
Expose the core of apathy
