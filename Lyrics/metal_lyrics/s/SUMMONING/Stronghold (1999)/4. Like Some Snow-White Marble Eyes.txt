How countless they congregate
O'er our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow

Upon this star I fixed my eye
And rode over the wide, wide lands
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof
He raced and never stopped again

As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest, and a place of rest
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate
Those stars like some snow-white
Like some snow-white marble eyes

How countless they congregate
O'er our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow

Upon this star I fixed my eye
And rode over the wide, wide lands
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof
He raced and never stopped again

As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest, and a place of rest
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate
Those stars like some snow-white
Like some snow-white marble eyes

How countless they congregate
O'er our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow

Upon this star I fixed my eye
And rode over the wide, wide lands
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof
He raced and never stopped again

As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest, and a place of rest
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate
Those stars like some snow-white
Like some snow-white marble eyes
