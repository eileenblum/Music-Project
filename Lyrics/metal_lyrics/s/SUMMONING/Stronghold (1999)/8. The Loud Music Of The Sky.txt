What I am, I must not show
What I am thou could (not know)
Something between heaven and hell
Something that neither stood nor fell

Far less happy, for we have
Help nor hope beyond the grave
And this is all that I can show
And this is all that you may know

A year there is a lifetime
And a second but a day
And an older would will meet you
Each morn' you come away

The thunder's noise is our delight
And lightning makes us day by night
And in the air we dance on high
To the loud music of the sky

Neither substance quite, nor shadow
Haunting lonely moor and meadow
Dancing by the haunted spring
And riding on the whirlwinds wing

A year there is a lifetime
And a second but a day
And an older would will meet you
Each morn' you come away

The thunder's noise is our delight
And lightning makes us day by night
And in the air we dance on high
To the loud music of the sky
