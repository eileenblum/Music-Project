My star, I saw it high and far
At the parting of the ways
A light on the edge of the outer night
Like silver set ablaze
Where the round world plunges steeply down
But on the old roads goes
As an unseen bridge that on arches runs
To coasts that no man knows

I would not find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men
long lost to where no pathway goes

But where they bloom those flowers fair
In what air or land they grow
What words beyond the world I heard
If you would seek for know

In a boat then, brother, far afloat
You must labour in the sea
And find yourself things out of mind:
You will learn no more of me

I would not find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the deadly snows
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men
Of long lost to where no pathway goes

There the twain enfolded,
Phantom twilight, phantom twilight,
And dim the mazes dark, unholy,

I would never find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows
Nor seek in mountains dark, the landscapes of the men
Long lost to whom no pathway goes
