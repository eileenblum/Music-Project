[Morgoth:]
Sit now there,
And look out upon the lands
Where evil and despair shall come upon those whom thou lovest.

Thou hast dared to mock me, and to question the power of Melkor,
Master of the fates of Arda.

Therefore, with my eyes thou shalt see,
And with my ears thou shall hear;
And never shalt thou move from this place
Until all is fulfilled unto its bitter end...

[Orcs:]
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!
