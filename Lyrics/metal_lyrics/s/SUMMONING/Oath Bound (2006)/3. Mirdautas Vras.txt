[Written in black language of Mordor]

Brus-kuluz taurzur bÃ»rzu tiil-ob
Hush-ob dhurum agh ufum dhurum
Tor Vautu brus-troguz
Urgai-u gukh dÃ»mp agh tiimor

Talaan-u rÃ»k-ir tor urÃ»k
Nauru-ir agh kragoru nÃ»rsu grishÃ»rz
Nork-ulu furtun agh goth
Mordor-ob bot-tuk

Ghaash agh akÃ»l - NazgÃ»l skoiz
Mirdautas vras!
Karn ghaamp agh nÃ»t
Shaut Manwe quiinubat gukh

[Translation (Narrator is Sauron):]

A Good Day To Kill

Dark have been my dreams of late
Of secret doubt and secret fear
A thousand years have passed away
To lay down doom and terror

To north ride on, a thousand orcs
On wolves with giant bloody fangs
They take the storm and power
Of Mordor through the world

Fire and Ice, the NazgÃ»l fly
It is a good day to kill!
(Painted) red is Earth and sky
Even Manwe will bow down
