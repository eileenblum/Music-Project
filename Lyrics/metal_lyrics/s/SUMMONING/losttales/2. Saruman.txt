[1. Sample]
Saruman come forth.

[2. Sample]
I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman of many colours.

[3. Sample]
Middle days are passing,
younger days....
The nine have come forth again

[4. Sample]
A new power is rising,
the victory is at hand and there will be rich reward for thoser who aid it.

[5. Sample]
By night or day. Are we not both members of a high and ancient order (most
excellent in Middle Earth).

[6. Sample]
The friedship of Saruman and the power of Orthanc (can not be lightly thrown aside),
you have won a battle but not a war.

[7. Sample]
Will you have peace with me. And all the aid that my knowledge,
founded in long years can bring.

[8. Sample]
Good days, come back by night or day
