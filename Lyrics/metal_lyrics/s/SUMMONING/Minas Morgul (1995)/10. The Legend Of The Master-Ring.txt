Three rings to elven kings
Under the sky,
seven for the dwarf lords
in their halls of stone
Nine for mortal men
doomed to die
One for the Dark Lord
on his dark throne

In the land of  Mordor where the shadows lie
One Ring to rule them all
One Ring to find them
One Ring to bring them all
And in darkness bind them
In the land of Mordor where shadows lie

The earth was trembling by cloven hooves
and no stars shined in that night
foreseen the Morgul road
was hidden by clouds of doom...
and trembled again by the outburst of darkness.
Ten thousand orcs and trolls,
paralyzed with fear
of the nazgÃ»l king ???
One ring to rule them all
In the gathering of darkness
In the lands of Mordor where the shadows Lie
