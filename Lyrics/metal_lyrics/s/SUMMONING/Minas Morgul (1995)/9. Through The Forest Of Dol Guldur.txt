A misty path through woods long past and shrined in silence
and runes will keep the secrets of Dol Guldur
Far away and over the cold fold mountains
our gleaming eyes are searching for a sign
and down to the deepest dungeons
and to the old forgotten lair
We must leave now, before a new day breaks
to search for the pale gold
that once belonged to the forest

By the sounds of pounding hammers
that sound like bells of the elves in our ears...
we are still searching in the underground
where our dark secrets sleep
