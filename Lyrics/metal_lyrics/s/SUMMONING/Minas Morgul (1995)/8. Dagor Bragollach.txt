In the year 455 it began, the battle of rapid fire.
Announced threw flames,
more deadly then the third battle.
Streams of fire flowing out of Thangorodrin and burned Ardgalen
And with the flame a see of orcs arived,
and balorgs and glaurung the dragon.
Having received all his might now Dor Thonion broke down first under this onset
Angrod and aegnor where killed and their folk enslaved.
The riders of maglor where sacrifices of the flames.
On the planes of Lothlann victory on our side the triumph of Morgoth.
