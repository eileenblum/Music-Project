Beneath the moon and under star 
he wandered far from northern strands, 
bewildered on enchanted ways 
beyond the days of mortal lands. 

Through evernight he back was borne 
on black and roaring waves that ran 
oâer leagues unlit and foundered shores 
that drownded before the days began. 

His sword of steel was valiant, 
of adamant his helmet tall, 
an eagle-plume upon his crest, 
upon his breast an emerald.
