[Special Edition Bonus Track]Fair shall the end be!
We will never turn back from pursuit.
War shall he have and hatred undying.

We and we alone shall be lords of the unsullied Light, and masters of the bliss and beauty of Arda.

Fair shall the end be!
We will never turn back from pursuit.
War shall he have and hatred undying.
