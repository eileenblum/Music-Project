They come from the burning skiesTo bring eternal chaosRiding high on mighty black horsesWhich are spreading death Prayers of chaosPrayers of darknessTotal desecrationBringers of death Cold are their mindsAnd cold are their bodiesNo life and no soulThe legions of the apocalypse Riding on the wings of infernal wrathFires embrace the earthArmageddon has come Dark red eyes is the lastWhat you see before you dieA shower of spells from heavenYour God is dead Prayers of hatePrayers of warCold are their mindsBlood-thirst is their way Sacrifice their bloodTo cleanse the worldFrom the plagueThatÂ´s called religion The storm brings the endFire is their breathA blackened fucking earthAnd burning corpses are the rest
