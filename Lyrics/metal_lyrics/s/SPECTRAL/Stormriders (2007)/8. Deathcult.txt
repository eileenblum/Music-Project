Death fills the atmosphereDarkness surrounds youScreams of pain fill the airFrom the unknown blackThis is the end of lifeTake your last breathShadows in the dark whisperingDeath!! Soulless creatures out from hellTake your soul, you are damnedEndless pain awaits youYour deepest nightmareBecomes realityThis is the reign of deathNo return to lifePain, torture, death!! Feel the blade that cuts in your fleshFeel the pain in your soulFeel the blade that cuts in your fleshThis is the end of your life
