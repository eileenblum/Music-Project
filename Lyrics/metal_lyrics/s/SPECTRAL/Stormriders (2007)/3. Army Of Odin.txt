Wrath is my bladeThe Gods are my shieldBy the hammer of ThorYou all shall die Unholy swordsEat flesh and bonesYour death will be my pleasureAnd your blood will be my wine Army of Odin We are devastationWe have come to grind youDrowning the sky in darknessWe bring suffering and pain The ground is shakingThe earth is burningItÂ´s the wrath of the northern Gods Army of Odin The fame and gloryOf fire and bloodWith the power of the RavenlordWe will fight until we die
