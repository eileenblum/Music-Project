With power and wrath we strikeBlack are our heartsWeÂ´re praying for vengeanceBaptized in blood Death to our enemiesTheir blood will be our wineWe raise the horns under aFucking blackened sky Fire burns in our heartsThe fire of black Viking powerWhich burns forever and ever Raise your swords forBlack Viking powerHail to our hordesBlack Viking power
