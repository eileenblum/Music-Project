In a land of eternal frost and iceWhere no life dwells and darkness rulesDark forests and mountains made of steelA mysterious fog lies on the frozen land A man with his horse rides into the snowItÂ´s the only way he can goThe air is cutting his skin like cold steelThe bitterness of the land takes his soul The hopeless land spreads itÂ´s deadly windsThe cold storm and snow bring the man to fallThe frost is bursting his skin like cold steelThe blood cannot flow because its frozen
