Death is by my sideI feel the magic riseTo the gates of ValhallaWhere all my brothers live I feel the sound of warI see the fields of bloodThe first warriors begin to fallThe battle has begun Blood runs over my swordBlood runs over meI donÂ´t have fear of deathI shall live eternally IÂ´m lying on the groundBlood runs out of my woundsThe gates are opened wideThus my soul has arrived
