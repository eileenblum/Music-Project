Wind comes upFire in the skyTurned blackSword and axe riseTo killThe enemies hordeComes nearThey cannot wait The ultimate battleWill beginHate and rageIn their eyesPride and honourIn their heartsThey are fightingFor their kingdom Kingdom under Fire! They will fightFor their landNo fear ofEternal deathNo remorseFor our enemiesWe kill withViolence Dead bodies lieOn the battlefieldTheyÂ´ve been thrashed withHate and rageBlood flowsOut of their woundsArms and legscover the land
