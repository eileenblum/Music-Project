Far beyond the seaFrom the cold northern landsCame the Vikings with their dragon shipsUnder the banner of Thor they followThe call of the Gods through the raging sea Whispering voices in the wind they hearAgainst the open sea with no fearWith sword and shield in handThey stand on their enemies land They are ready to fight Hate will lead their swords in battleThey will keep fighting onIn the name of Thor and the mightyGods they shall kill
