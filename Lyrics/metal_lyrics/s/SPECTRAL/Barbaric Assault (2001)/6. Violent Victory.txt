The light was banished to the dark side
By the infernal might
Hell creatures will rise

They bring the spawn of
Death to earth
About to spread hypocrisy
This is the beginning
Of the end

Hell storm comes to destroy
What god once created

Corpses lying on the ground
In their own spilling blood
Burned by the flames
Angels fall from the sky
And are damned to endless fire
Heaven shall be destroyed

On a mission to kill
In the name of the great emperor

The last life is exterminate
The silence is coming back
And darkness rules on earth

On a mission to kill
The battle is over
The domination is ours
