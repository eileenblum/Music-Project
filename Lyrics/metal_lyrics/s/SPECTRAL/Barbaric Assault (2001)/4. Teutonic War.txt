I have seen the rage in their eyes
After they
sacrifice their own flesh and blood
Many weeks they
marched through the night
Only to kill the enemy by a
mighty Teutonic War
Death by Teutonic War

They praise the lord and fight
For his kingdom
They defend his land and many
warriors died
Many weeks they walked into the night
Only to kill the enemy by the mighty
Teutonic War

I have seen theâ¦

The fight for the gods for the throne and for the
mighty Kingdom. They ware lead by the winds and
the moon stand on their side. They ride into the
final battle, reaching the end which bad been left a
Bloody drenched battlefield.

Many warriors died on the battlefield and spilled
their blood about fight for honour of the gods, about
to saw hate and war all over the world
