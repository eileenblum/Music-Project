Beyond the gates of Valhalla
In a very ancient time
With thunder and steel
Rages the endless war

Towards the magic gate
Upon the einherjers place
The immortal warriors march
Kill the enemies
(Blood lust in their eyes)

Warriors, Gods and Demons
Fighting on the battlefield
The sky is turning red

Blood flows everywhere
Dying bodies falling
Fenrir's howling
Thor's armies calling

Across this violent place of doom
The Valkyries rise (again)
The lead the fallen ones
Back to eternal life (again)

Wolf and eagle, proud and mighty
Guardians of the magic gate
Forever they will wait
At the Valgrind gate
