Legions from deep in hell
To kill their enemies
And bring eternal death
From the darkest shadows
They will rise
Hellfire on their side
About to burn the corpses

Dark forces bring
Apocalyptic war
Possessed by their master
And fight for eternal domination
Dead bodies lying on the ground
Devoured b the flames
Slashed by unholy swords

The mighty throne of damnation
Protected by dark creatures
Barbaric sons of blaspheme

Dark force brings Armageddon near
Only pain and fear rules the earth
The time is past you must die
Chaos and destruction is your realm
