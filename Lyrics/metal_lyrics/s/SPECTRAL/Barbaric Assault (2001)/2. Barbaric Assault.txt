A sign deep from hell
The sign of war â infernal spell
The night â total black,
Darkness spread and the
Gates of hell are open wide

The fallen hordes will rise
Revenge for a lost kingdom
Revenge, to ban the light
Screams of angels rings
Trough the night
Battered wings lie on the grounds
Demon bring the sacrifice
About to honour,
the only horned master

Darkest wrath â damnation is near
The gates of hell are open wide
The infernal storm is blasting through the night
In the name of the only one horned master
Beginning of the assault

Darkest wrath â damnation is near
The flag of war blows in the wind
The victims shall desecrate
In the name of the only one horned master
The beginning of the assault
