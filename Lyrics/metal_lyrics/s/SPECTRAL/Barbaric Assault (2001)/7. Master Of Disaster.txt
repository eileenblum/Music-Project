I am dominate of torment and chaos
I am the bringer of eternal darkness
I am the darkest purest wrath
I am the master of disaster

I am the darkness that surrounds you
I am the wind that is blowing through the forest
I am the protector of infernal flames
I am the master of disaster

I am the spawn who comes from deep out of hell
I am the one who leads you to the abyss
I am the messenger of death
I am the master of disaster

I am the sin that who you commit
I am the demon who occupies your soul
I am the warrior which kills for lust
I am the master of disaster

I am the reaper who's calling your name
I am the mind that makes you insane
I am the blood that is flowing in your veins
I am the master of disaster

I am the beast who is raping the human soul
I am the death who's waiting for you
I am almighty, I'm dominant
I am the master of disaster
