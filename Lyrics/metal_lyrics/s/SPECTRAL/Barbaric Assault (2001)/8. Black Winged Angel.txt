My thoughts are carried
by a black winged angel
Into the arms of torture,
Into the arms of torture

The gates has opened
And I have no choice
Iâve got to find the way
to myself
And find out about my destiny
Iâve got to get red of my body
and free myself from the curse of life
I shall give my body to you demons
of the underworld

My soul will rise
My soul will rise

At last, free from fear, anger and pain
My new life will be beyond life and death
Life and death, life and death, life and death

My soul is imprisoned,
forever between life and death
My soul is imprisoned
forever between life and death
