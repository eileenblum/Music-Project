In an ancient time of warWarriors hear the call to armsWith odins mightTheyÂ´re marching to the battlefield Mighty warriors standing tallWelcoming death with open armsAll those who die in battleKnow theyÂ´ll die a glorious death With their sword in handTheyÂ´re standing tall side by sideAwaiting their enemyForever fighting on With faith they are marching onTo find their true destinyBeyond the Call of DutyThey will fight until they die Without fear they will standLooking in the face of deathProudly holding up their swordAgainst their enemies One by one, side by sideTheir bodies fall onto the groundOne by one falling downNo one will survive With babaric wrath they fought in warsHeld their sword in honor and prideTo hail the gods aboveWho gave them immortality
