Marching, fighting,
where the battlefield is frozen
arctic frost has frozen their breath

thousands of soldiers
those who were left behind
all frozen and starved to death - in the winterÂ´s hell

Creeping, screaming,
As their eyes start bleeding
And ther life pours down their skin

thunder and lightning
explosions lightens the sky
those who survive will fight Â´till death - in a winterÂ´s hell

the artillery is firing
and the battle is raging
Dust has covered the battlefield

Exhausted warriors
Standing line by line
Fight until they die - in this winterÂ´s hell

Honor for the fallen ones
who fought and died for their land
In the battle they fought Â´till the end
Until the last of them has been killed
