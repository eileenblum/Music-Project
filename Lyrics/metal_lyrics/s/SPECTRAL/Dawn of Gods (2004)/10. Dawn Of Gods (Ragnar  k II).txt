The earth errupts by the sound of the Gjallarhorn
Fear spreads on heaven and on earth
The Einherjer ...
The final march to Wigrid is near

Father and son marching side by side
The battle has begun as the two powers collide

Odin riding straight ahead his spear in his hand
To fight the Fenrir-Wolf to death
The god of thunder destroys the snake
Just to die in her poisonous breath

Without his sword in hand Freyr dies in the flames
His last demand is revenge for his death

the god of heavens fights with the beast
odinÂ´s killed by the wrath of the wolf
his son arises to finish the deed
rips off the throat and takes revenge for odinÂ´s death

as the sky turned black the earth is drowned in flames
the heaven bursts and the world is covered with darkness

the Dawn of Gods - has led to war
that drowned them all - in flames

gods of war - will rise once more
to fight this war - again
