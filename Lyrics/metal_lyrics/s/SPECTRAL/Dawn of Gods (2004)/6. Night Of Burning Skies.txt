As the darkness falls the first bombers leave the groundThe rise up to the clouds and set of their deadly crusade In the night the sirens cry, bombs beginn to fallThe arrival of the enemy to bring death upon us all The first bomb that hits the groundhouses turn to dustpeople turn to claythe devastation has begun the sirens play their songmelody of paina whole city starts to cryitÂ´s the night of burning skies People eaten by fireTheir bodies torn apartThe bombers come againFar to many to kill them all the defense starts to roarfirst enemies begin to fallthe achievement of mankinditÂ´s the night of burning skies... the night of burning skies... underneath the darknessÂ´carpet the bombs go down as rainitÂ´s a carnival of starvation the earth is mixed with blood the night brought death to those who were running for their livesas people stand up to get prepared for the next night of burnig skies
