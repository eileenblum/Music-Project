Bombs are falling on the groundLike a hawk that hunts for preySirens crying through the nightMassenger of pain Iron Demons in the nightInferno is breaking loseIron Demons through the nightOpen the gates of hell Darkest smoke covers the skyKilling every lightThe battlefield is drown in flamesThe smell of burning flesh Iron Demons on the groundDevastate the landIron Demons in the skyDrown the earth in flames Hear them coming through the nightThe battle has begunSee them crawling side by sideKilling one by one Iron Demons screaming loudSpitting fire and steelIron Demons fighting onFight until the end
