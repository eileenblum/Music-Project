The cold wind blowes through the forestWhere the corpses hang downTheir blood was spilled to please our gods Death is the priceYou pay with your bloodTorned flesh for the god of the dead Silent SlaughterDeath is the price for wisdom and mightSilent SlaughterYour flesh for the god of the dead Signed by deepest woundsThey sacrifice themselvesAnd offer their body with pride With his spear odin arisesAnd takes their mortal fleshImmortality for those who sacrificed their lives Silent SlaughterDeath is the price for wisdom and mightSilent SlaughterGiven by the god of the dead
