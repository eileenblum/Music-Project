When the fog is creeping through the ancient forestsThis is the time we arise As shadows of the underworld born with axe and swordDriven by honour and pride - we never bow our heads with our courage and strength we will fight Â´till the endbetrayal and misery rules the land with strong will and wotanÂ´s might we march to the fightthe souls of our elders by our side - devastation is your destiny
