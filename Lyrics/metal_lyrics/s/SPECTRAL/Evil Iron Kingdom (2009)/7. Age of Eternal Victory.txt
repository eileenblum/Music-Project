In a dark nightthe warriors shall riseFire burning highInto the sky Mighty flames of warEnrich their bodiesHonour and prideA new age will come The moon is shining brightShields reflect the lightBlood for bloodReady to fight Thousands (of) warriors standSide by sideReady to killOne by one Fight against the worldHumanity shall dieA new age will riseThe time is come Blood stains the groundThe air is filled with deathCorpses lying everywhereDeath rules this world Dark smoke covers the skyThe mourning sun is turning blackNo reburth of lightThe dark age has arrived
