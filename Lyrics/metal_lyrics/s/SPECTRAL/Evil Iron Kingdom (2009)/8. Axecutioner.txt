Black is his maskAnd sharp is his fucking axe Steel hits your neckPainful screams No chance to prayDemons desecrate your head Blood drenched eyesYou have no time to cry AxecutionerHeadless you will burn in Hell You have to payFor the wakness's in your life He takes your soulTortured screams Your body burnsIn the shadow of the axe He is the oneWho fucking reigns in Hell AxecutionerHeadless you will burn in Hell Your soul is damnedTo burn in hellFire burns your bodyEndless pain forever You'll be a slaveOur victim of death AxecutionerHeadless you will burn in Hell
