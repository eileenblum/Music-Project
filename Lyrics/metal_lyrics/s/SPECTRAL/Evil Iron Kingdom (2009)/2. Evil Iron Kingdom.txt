Black clouds darken (the) northern skiesAt nightfall we will riseTo turn your life into darkness and destruction Fire and screams cut through the nightWe strike with fear and terror into your heartFor our Evil Iron Kingdom you shall die Evil Iron Kingdom Bestial torture and sufferingTorment and pain awaitsFor those who dare to stand in our way As six infernal warriors rideTheir bodies will be sacrificedAnd our Evil Iron Kingdom shall arise Evil Iron Kingdom I'll take your lifeWith no remorseYou shall dieYour blood shall be spilledAnd absorbed by the groundAll your bones will be brokenAnd your body shall be shattered When the smoke clearsAnd the rain washes awayThe fragments of blood and fleshReveal a place without hope Bare sand and stone which harbored lifeHas lost it's ashes in the airMay the Evil Iron KingdomReign over your graves
