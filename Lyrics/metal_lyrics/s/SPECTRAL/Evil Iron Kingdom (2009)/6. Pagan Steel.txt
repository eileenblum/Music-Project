Burned in unholy fireA blade unscathed and eternalSwords wchich spread your deathGuided by the power of Odin Blinded by steelA kiss of ironSharp and deadlyWe are sworn in blood We are sons of OdinDie by pagan steel The battlefield thus tremblesBy pagan steelHoly swords sink notIn the name of the gods Steel meets steelBones are crushingVictims of warBlood runs over my sword We are sons of OdinDie by pagan steel Warriors from the northFight with pagan steelEnemies shall dieEternal war
