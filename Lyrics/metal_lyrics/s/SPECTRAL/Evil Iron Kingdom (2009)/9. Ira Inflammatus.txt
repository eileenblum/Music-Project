In a raging battle
Blood everywhere
Slaying without mercy
Battlefield in flames

Demons rising out of fire
Feel their infernal voice
Fire like hot as hell
Burning down

[Refrain:]
Fire will destroy your body
Ira inflammatus
Enter the realm of flames
Ira inflammatus
Death is your master now
Ira inflammatus
Massacrate your tortured soul
Ira Inflammatus

Screams of torture
Look into the eyes
Of death
It's the last time
You will be on earth
Your spirit falls
Into eternal darkness
Hellfire burns

[Refrain:]
Fire will destroy your body
Ira inflammatus
Enter the realm of flames
Ira inflammatus
Death is your master now
Ira inflammatus
Massacrate your tortured soul
Ira Inflammatus
