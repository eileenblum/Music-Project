The sreams of agony and madness ariseI sense the smell of bloodA piercing slash that drains my strengthLays my body to the ground Sand that flow through my fingersKnows my time has finally comeAs the darkness embraces meMy whole life is gone (the) Gates of Darkness are open for meThe ancestors call my name(as) Death welcomes me with open armsI know (that) my time has come A heavy burden is lifted frm meRidden from the wheight of life(I have) no fear of whats awaiting meI m not afraid to die Farewell my friend-don't bow your head in griefAs I hear the Valkiers call I will go on with my journey which has just begun What was should never beAll that has been has vanishedMemories of past nad presentWill perish forever I see my family before my eyesThere is no reason for griefCause my journey has come to an end
