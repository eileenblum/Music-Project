Viking hordes are sailingFrom the north (and) to the southTo west (and) to the eastAgainst the raging sea Thunder growls from the skyWith lightning and windFog hinders their shipsRavens show the way United forcesFor blood and honour Icewinds blowing through their facesMighty gods of warSending legions from the northTo rule the world Bloodlust in their eyesThe storm is beginning nowNo one can stop the invasionUnited forces from the north United forcesFor blood and honour
