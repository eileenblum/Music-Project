Strong were our heartsAnd strong was our willWith hellish screamsIn battle we will rideSwords before usAnd hate in our heartsFighting down the enemyYou must (fucking) die Die in battle now, For the northen Gods With the hammer of ThorAnd Odin by our sideFlames in our veinsAnd fire in our eyesThunder shakes the groundThe mouth of hell is open wideWinds of hell, unholy flames Die in battle now, For the northern Gods Skin burned from their bodysThe smell of burning fleshA thouand souls ride to hellthe slaves of the deadViolence ruledIn (this) fucking battleNo remorseThe battlefield shall be their grave Die in battle now, For the northern Gods Sword and axes rise to the skyA sea of skulls and bonesThe sign of victorythis battle we have wonWith the Gods on our sideIn the blood red morning sunWe (shall) ride intil we fight
