Evil voices arise insideTime for alcoholic nightsManiac souls are ready to fightLet hell break loose Darkness comesDon't fear the nightCome with usMetal lust Break your chainsFeel the soundRaise your beerStart the fight Raise you fistPossessed by metalRaise your fistPossessed and evilRaise your fistLet hell break loose Raise your fist... Infernal LegionsRaise their fistsLeather and chainsBlood and beer Hammer of deathMetal nightsTogether we standFor metal we fight We ve got no fucking God(So) Praise the soundOf the metalgods Kill em allDeath to allFire and deathIn metal we trust
