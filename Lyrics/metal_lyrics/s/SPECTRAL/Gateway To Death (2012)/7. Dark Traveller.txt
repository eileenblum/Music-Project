Traveller on lonesome paths through desert lands
Sickness is his companion his journey never ends
Corpses burned by the sun plague follow his ways
Dark unholy omen the sign of terror and hate

The sun withers the land his shadow starts to change
His path leads him away from mankind from his inner self
Traveler on lonesome paths rage burns inside
His soul made the sacrifice to the lord of lies

The traveler has disappeared consumed by flames of hate
A fire that scorches the earth when evil shows his face
Traveler of lonesome paths through desert sands
Instrument of destruction his journey never ends
