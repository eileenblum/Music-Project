Hell opened his mouth
The time has come again
Spreading fear and terror
Driven by hate and death Riding on the winds of vengeance
The Forces out from hell
Battlefields are pounding
No one can escape

Lord of fire, lord of flames
Sending war and sending death
Baptized with sins
Be in demonical possession
This is the day of wrath
In this final battle
We shall kill again

Marching against our enemies
Bloodlust in our eyes
Blood drenched swords
Press the enemies to the ground

Ripping out their hearts
And cutting out their eyes
Impale their fucking bodies
Bloody massacre

Lord of fire, lord of flames
Sending war and sending death
Baptized with sins
Be in demonical possession
This is the day of wrath
In this final battle
We shall kill again

When the battle ends
Death is all around
Thousands bodies lying
On the blood drenched ground

Scorched earth is everywhere
No sign of life
Lord of fire
Driven by hate and death

Lord of fire, lord of flames
Sending war and sending death
Baptized with sins
Be in demonical possession
This is the day of wrath
In this final battle
We shall kill again
