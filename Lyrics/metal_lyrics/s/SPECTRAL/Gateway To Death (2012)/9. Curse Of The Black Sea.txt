Silent seas are rising
With anger and hate

Waiting for some souls
To devour

Creations from deep
Waking up
To conquer this world
Creations from the past

Curse of the black sea
Curse of the black sea

Collecting human bodies
To rot
On the oceans bed
To never
Come back

Hate and death
In waves
Will crashing down the past
For a life in fear

Beasts from the depths (deep)
Are rising
To take your soul
Forever
In the eternal sleep

No one can escape
Because
The curse
Will catch you all â follow the dark sea

Darkness rising from the abyss
Taking all our mind
Under a moonless sky we ride
Death is by our side

Awakening the underworld
Which sleeping for many times
Revenge shall coming now
The surface has arrived

Taking all our strength to ride into the
Curse of the black sea
Into the eye of the storm we ride
Curse of the black sea
Black waves pounding over us into the
Curse of the black sea
Fearless we wander in eternity
Curse of the black sea
