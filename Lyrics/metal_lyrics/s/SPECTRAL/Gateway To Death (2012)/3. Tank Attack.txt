Rolling Roaring
Spitting fire and death
50s tons of mass destruction

Panzer divisions
Ready for attack
Blitzkrieg commandos strikes

Rattling chains
Breaking skulls and bones
Death defying steel

The earth is shaking
Blood on foreign ground
Forces get ready to fight

Fire
Tank attack
Ready for attack - fire
Tank attack
Ready for your death - fire
Tank attack
Spreading fear and terror - fire
Tank attack
Feel the iron breath

Howling grenades
The battlefield is bombed
Screaming soldiers died

Rapid fire
Bullets smashed some heads
Senseless death has begun

Troops of steel
Coming from the back
Commanding to destroy

Sounds of war
Feel their iron voice
Killing machines of hate

Division north
Division south
Division west
Division east
Division hate
Division blood
Division death
Division war
