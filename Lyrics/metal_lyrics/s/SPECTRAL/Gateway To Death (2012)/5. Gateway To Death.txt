Starless night
And a moonless sky
The fog is rising
Cold as ice

My tears are frozen
And my skin is torn
I see my breath
Death will come

Before my eyes
The reaper rise
To take my soul
On the other side

Strength and power
Losing effects
My soul escapes
Into the night

Gateway to death
Cursed eternally
Enter the gateway to death
Enter the gateway to death
Enter the gateway to death
Enter the gateway to death
I feel the dark
I feel the frost
Black winds blow
To the horns of death

Creeping shadows
All around
Taking me and taking my mind
Beholding (the) scars
That never heal

Desolated souls
Were waiting for me
To snatch me into the eternal vortex

Hopeless darkness
Is catching me
Through the gateway to death
