Down in a land of snow and ice
A secret of the past
Valley of ancient times
Buried for ages

Beware of the things you may find
No man shall ever know about
The secrets that should have been
Buried forever

At the mountain of madness

Behold (the) secrets of an ancient race
Human mind cannot understand
Lost in a forbidden place
Between mountains of ice

Death (of) gods of cosmic power
Their temple lost and forgotten
The power of the ancient one
Torture a soul with madness

Dead fires burn at the mountain of madness
Honour and pride for those who falls
Valour was their fate for all times
Buried with their wisdom and might

At the edge of cosmic lights
Endless fires are burning bright
Gives us power to read the signs
Take their wisdom and take their might
