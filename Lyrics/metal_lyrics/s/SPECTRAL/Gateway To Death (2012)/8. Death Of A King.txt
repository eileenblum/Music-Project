Hear my son my time has come
To tell you of my eventful life
When I was young - I left my home
To travel to the land of snow and ice

Northern hordes
Blow their horns
Warriors
Wise and strong
Rule the land
Of mountains high
For freedom united they'll fight

Proud and glorious â thirteen warriors
Fight to avenge the death of a king

Through storming sea
They travel on
Kill the beast
Carnivorous
Bearlike men
Hide in the fog
Worm of fire
Enlightens the fog
Mother of all
She has to fall
Blood on swords her life has gone
Her legacy
Poisonous
Will lead to the tragic death of the king

Proud and glorious â thirteen warriors
Together in battle 'til the death of the king

Brothers in arms
We bid farewell
Raise your swords
Death of our king
