Darkness is rising over me
Black winter and ice cold snow
Sorrowful times are come
Eternal frost forever

Into oblivion

Timeless I wander in my dreams
Sadness and death on my way
My eyes are turning black
The endless night has come

Evilness in my mind
Demons in my head (screaming loud)
Destruction of the light
Keep it far away

Into oblivion

As I enter the other side
Spirits I can see
I fall into ashes
My soul is free
Now I wandering
As a spirit across the seas
Silent and dark
And for evermore
