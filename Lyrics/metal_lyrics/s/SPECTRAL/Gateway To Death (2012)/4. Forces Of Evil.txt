The earth fall in darkness
Hope and love is lost
Angels falls from heaven
Drowning into dust

Forces of evil
Standing proud and tall
Waiting for the battle
The infernal call is come

Demons rising out of ashes
Leading to destroy
Driven by endless war
The hordes of light shall fall

Flames strikes in the air
Slaughtering the weak
Sacrifice them all
Vengeance is the law

Beasts of damnation
Blackness takes sun
Open graves and exhumed all
A bestial invasion comes
