Arms of an angel, heart of gold
Eyes that can melt a soul
Always you wait and care for me
A love that is uncontrolled
Once and again our paths they cross
Gently you speak to me
âWorry not, baby you know me,
Know that Iâm only yourâ
But youâre goddamn liar
Oh no, canât believe that I believed you, no
Such a witch, you liar
No no, did you really, really need to?
No!
Time after time you break my heart
Again and again you do
Oh still how I need to be with you
Crush me again, anew
âWorry not, baby you know me,
Know that Iâm only yoursâ
But youâre goddamn liar
Oh no, canât believe that I believed you now
Such a witch you liar
No no, did you really, really to?
No! no no!
Be with me, stay with me oh
Keeping me, breaking me oh
âcause youâre a goddamn liar,
Oh no, canât believe that I believed you, now
Such a witch, you liar
No no, did you really, really need to?
Youâre goddamn liar
Oh no, canât believe that I believed you, no
Such a witch, you liar
No no, did you really, really need to?
