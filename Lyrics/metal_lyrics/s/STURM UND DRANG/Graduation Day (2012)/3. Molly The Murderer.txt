Ragin', as the night begins to raise
An ambush waiting for the prey
Gonna shoot me in cold blood
Cavin', as I admit the crime is mine
Though we both crossed the line
My friend

Still you murder me
Yeah, you murder me
Still you murder me
With your lies

Baby baby, you murder me
Baby baby, you murder me
Your weapons are words
Killers when heard
They murder me

If you try to assassinate me
You're doing it perfectly
Take a good look at me
I'll take a bullet for free
With no alibi
Molly you murder me

Crazy, thinking you would ever change
The nights will always be the same
For you and I
I would change this, if only you would let me
But baby you don't get this
You don't even try

Instead you murder me
Yeah, you murder me
Still you murder me
With your lies

Baby baby, you murder me
Baby baby, you murder me
Your weapons are words
Killers when heard
They murder me

If you try to assassinate me
You're doing it perfectly
Take a good look at me
I'll take a bullet for free
With no alibi
Molly you murder me

Your trap
Just waiting to drown

Guess I'm the only one
Was just another one of your lies
You murder me
Murder me

Murder me
Baby baby, you murder me
Your weapons are words
Killers when heard
They murder me

If you try to assassinate me
You're doing it perfectly
Take a good look at me
I'll take a bullet for free
With no alibi

Your weapons are words
Killers when heard
Your weapons are words
Killers when heard
You murder me
Murder me
