A young man he came, from far and away
To the front on a cold winterâs day
Just a poor farmerâs son, was given a gun
And the hope of glory to come
Now the old winds of war, they will blow, they will soar
From the east, as the guns start to roar
But they would not surrender
The pride inside their hearts
When we walk through the fields
Over blood that was spilled
For your fatherland
For the freedom they gave
With their names on the graves
For our fatherland
Come on, raise your hands
Out in the trenches, down on their knees
Wait for the storm to unleash
The enemyâs name, the fear it remains
It be over in three weeks they say
But they would not surrender
The pride inside their hearts
When we walk through the fields
Over blood that was spilled
For our fatherland
For the freedom they gave
With their names on the graves
For our fatherland
Come one, raise your hands
All the mothers who cried over soldiers who died
For our fatherland
For the freedom they gave
With their names on the graves
For our fatherland
Come on, raise your hands
