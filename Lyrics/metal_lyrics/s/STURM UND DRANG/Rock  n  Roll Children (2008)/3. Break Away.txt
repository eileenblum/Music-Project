I am the one, no longer petrified
Who's seen the lights in the blackest night
You wanna know if mind just purify
Can clarify this whole life

So see that these things are pretentious
And just take my hand

Break away
From this never-ending wheel
That's spinning on and on
Break away
Their backs against the wall
Break away

Break away

I set you free and you'll forever see
That to your heart it has no key
You bear alone the loss of all those years
But all the loneliness and pain

Now I see that those heroes were cheaters
So just take my hand

Break away
From this never-ending wheel
That's spinning on and on
Break away
Their backs against the wall
Break away
Break away

Break away
From this never-ending wheel
That's spinning on and on
Break away
Their backs against the wall
Break away
