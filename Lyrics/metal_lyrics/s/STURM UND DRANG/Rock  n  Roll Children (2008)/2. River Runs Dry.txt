There is a limit how much I can carry
The misery I married kept me chained down so long
Now I feel alive for the first time
Where I have been, what I have seen contribute to the moment
The river runs dry

The river runs dry

And I want you to know you are all that matters
And I hope you remember me
Hold on to your dream while the night is growing dark
Soar as the winds lift you higher
Keep searching for hope mountain high or river deep
And there I'll be tending the fire for you

I captured the essence of existance
Saw the fading lifeline and took hold of the flame
Now I'll illuminate this moment
Become the spark to light up the dark, open up your eyes to see that
The river runs dry

Our river runs dry
And I want you to know you are all that matters
And I hope you remember me
Hold on to your dream while the night is growing dark
Soar as the winds lift you higher
Keep searching for hope mountain high or river deep
And there I'll be tending the fire for you

Like river runs into the ocean
We're running right into our grave
Let me know when it's all over
And I shall never rise again

I don't know what we were waiting for
Remember what we were fighting for
I don't care if it was us or them
We knew they weren't heaven sent
Still followed them to the bitter end

And I want you to know you are all that matters
Now I know what it feels to be alone
Hold on to your dream while the night is growing dark
Soar as the winds lift you higher
Keep searching for hope mountain high or river deep
And there I'll be tending the fire
