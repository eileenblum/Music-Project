Crystal eyes, never cries
On and on the pain no one can see
Dream of yours, chains of mine
On and on the rain no one can feel

In the dead of night her lonely heart will cry
Ever far away her dreams will lie, and hope is left to die

Heaven is not here
It's forever away
Heaven is not here
Why she cannot stay

Never wanna waste another day, ever again
Cause heaven as it seems is nothing but hell
Cause heaven is not here

Fades away, every day

On and on through grey that never ends
Say the name, sail away
Sail away, no angels will be sent

In the dead of night her lonely heart will cry
Ever far away her dreams will lie, and hope is left to die
Heaven is not here

it's forever away
Heaven is not here
Why she cannot stay

Never wanna waste another day, ever again
Cause heaven as it seems is nothing but hell
Cause heaven is not here

Forever away, cannot stay

Heaven is not here
it's forever away
Heaven is not here
Why she cannot stay

Never wanna waste another day, ever again
Cause heaven as it seems is nothing but hell
Cause heaven is not here
