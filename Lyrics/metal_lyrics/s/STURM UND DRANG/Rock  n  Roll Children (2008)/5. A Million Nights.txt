So many darkened days have passed
So many lonely nights I've had to last
Distance to light and happiness
Feels infinite, I couldn't joy in this less

Closing my eyes I can see your face
But the feeling of warmth is long gone

I would fly, leave this solitude far behind
Hold you eternally close to mine
Get away from these million nights of winter
I would, if I only could

Trying to cope with how it is
Â´Til one day I'll feel joy and nothing of this
Though with mind that is frozen by this cold
*I can still recall that you have to hold*
I close my eyes and I wait for when

The feeling of warmth will return

I would fly, leave this solitude far behind
Hold you eternally close to mine
Get away from these million nights of winter
I would, if I only could

I would fly, leave this solitude far behind
Hold you eternally close to mine
Get away from these million nights of winter
I would, if I only could
