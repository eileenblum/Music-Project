Darkest night when asleep and through all days I'm deep inside you
All the secrets you keep are forever to remind you

Even if no one knew I will always be true,
I'm the devil in you, know the things that you do
Memory of sins that you're hiding

Can you hear I'm calling out your name again, sinner
Can you feel I'm crawling, it's the same again, sinner
You can run or hide but you I always will find

I could go, would you mind? Would you do it on forever?
Or leave all that behind and redo it never ever?

Even though no one knew I will always stay true,
I'm an angel in you, show the things that you do
Memory of sins that you're fighting

Can you hear I'm calling out your name again, sinner
Can you feel I'm crawling, it's the same again, sinner
You can run or hide but you I always will find

Can you hear I'm calling out your name again, sinner
Can you feel I'm crawling, it's the same again, sinner
You can run or hide but you I always will find
