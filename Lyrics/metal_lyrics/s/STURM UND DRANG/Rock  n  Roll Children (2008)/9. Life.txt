Lying awake again as the night before
Wondering if this moon will be my last
Finding myself inside the hourglass
This room I am in fills with the sands of time

One second you're here, one moment all changes
and the light of the sun fades away

I'd give it all, if something I had
For those times, for a life
All of the time it replays in my mind
Those far days, the days of my life

Memory runs blank like a broken arrow
From times of the past, through darkness to the present

One step and you fall, and everything changes
And the shine of the stars fades away

I'd give it all, if something I had
For those times, for a life
All of the time it replays in my mind
Those far days, the days of my life

I'd give it all, if something I had
For those times, for a life
All of the time it replays in my mind
Those far days, the days of my life
