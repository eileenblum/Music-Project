Right out the night, we're taking the fight
From now on we'll go our way
Glory we'll find, leave sadness behind,
For reborn we are today

You're gonna see that it's over, we'll never give it up

We come alive
Never falter, never fail
We come alive
Turn and run now when we come alive

Right out the black, we'll win your attack
And freedom shall be eternal
Forever again our power will win
And your lies won't be heard of

You're gonna see that it's over, we'll never give it up

We come alive
Never falter, never fail
We come alive
Run away and turn your tail
We come alive
Never falter, never fail
We come alive
Turn and run now when come alive

We come alive

You're gonna see that it's over, we'll never give it up

We come alive
Never falter, never fail
We come alive
Turn and run now when come alive
