Came to us when darkness had fallen
Took us up from we were crawli'n
Said that we would find what we sought for
But now where trapped in endless war

Promises were made out of lies
Anguish, fear and dread in our minds

[Chorus:]
Mortals, But you'll never take our souls away
We are Mortals, But you'll never take our hearts away

Thought that we were free still we were slaves
Sanity was lost into madness
Blinded by the promise of our hopes
We couldn't see that hell is what we chose

Destruction you have brought before our eyes
Will one day be upon your kind

[Chorus]
[Solo]

Promises were made out of lies
Anguish, fear and dread in our minds
Destruction you have brought before our eyes
Will one day be upon your kind

[Chorus x2]
[Solo]
