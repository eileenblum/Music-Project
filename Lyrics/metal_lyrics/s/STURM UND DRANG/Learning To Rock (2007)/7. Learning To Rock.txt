Sitting here trying to cut off all of the things you say,
don't wanna listen to you yell!
All your words are like poison, tainting my very brain

Turning the sound up, I just wanna rock

[Chorus:]
We're learning to rock
- Higher and higher screaming
We're learning to rock
- Fueling up for metal
We're learning to rock
- Higher and higher shooting
We're learning to rock
- Heading for the stars

Trying like crazy to change me, everything I am,
having a fight with my inner demons
Well we'll see who'll be talking, I'm better of on my own!

Turning the sound up, I just wanna rock!

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]

We're learning to rock
We're learning to rock
