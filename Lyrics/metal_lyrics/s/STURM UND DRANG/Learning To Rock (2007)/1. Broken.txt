Wandering somewhere between darkness and light,
between dream and reality, trough the cold night
I watch the last light of life fade away,
as on this stormy path, yet of calmness I stray
Frozen eternal I'm cursed with this blight
For I'll never again see the light!

[Chorus:]
Time will destroy me so slowly
Broken forever and ever
Never again will the sun rise on this sky
My wings of steel like a dry autumn leaf, I am broken!

Forces I sought to control now my friend,
like the abyssal fires it burns in my eyes
Now in my mind is but hatred and death,
but it matters no more for my destiny's set
Frozen eternal I'm cursed with this blight
For I'll never again see the light!

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
