Like a child, with no troubles in mind
Young and wild, not a thing that I feared
Now winter's here,
in this darkness I look up and long for my freedom

[Chorus:]
Out of the ashes I'm rising anew
Drowning my sorrow and pain
Just like the wind and the stars will never die
Forever I'll stay here this way

We were one: The shadow, my fear and me
I was done, without a reason to be
But I broke free from the chains of the past
now I leave all the sadness

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus x2]
