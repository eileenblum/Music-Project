Forests wrecked and cut,
flies the raven in the sky
He's got no home, no lonely hut,
he's forced to fly and fly

Shut your eyes, don't kill your dreams,
fly, trough the clouds above
Nothing is no longer what it seems,
turn all your anger to love

[Chorus:]
A lonely wolf was chased down there,
by people scared and poor
He's like you, he cannot share his life no more
Fly down raven to your friend,
leave destruction far behind
Fly and run until the end and finally ease your mind
Fly away like the raven

He was running free across the plains,
but now he's doomed to die
We're coming back you can be sure,
it's all just one big lie

Shut your eyes, don't kill your dreams,
fly trough the clouds above
Nothing is no longer what it seems,
turn all your anger to love

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
