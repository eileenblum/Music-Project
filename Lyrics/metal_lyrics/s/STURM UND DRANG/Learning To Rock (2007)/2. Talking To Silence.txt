As I lay floating inside my mind's corners it comes to me
Darkness it falls when you least would forsee it,
upon your soul

On think again what you think is for real
Maybe in silence there happiness is...

Took us in our darkest hour, brought us down with it
Trapped in an eclipse of sense, oh I should have seen

All with freedom in our minds, yet we were it's slaves
Found such peace, still it was a constant war

[Chorus:]
Talking to silence
Talking to silence

There's no point, no journeys end,
not going anywhere
Just found ourselves under the spell,
no end of it I see

All with vengeance in our minds,
yet no one there to blame
Destination there but there's no roads to take

[Chorus x2]
[Solo]
[Chorus x2]

As I lay floating inside my mind's corners..
