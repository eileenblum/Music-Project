Looking over a million parts of my once called life
Shattered in infinity, cut out by own knife

The rain is coming,
stormclouds are gathering above
I know it's time for me to go

[Chorus:]
I fly away I am leaving this kingdom of lies
Through the storm,
passing hell all for my kingdom come
All for a life one day

If only I could take you with me,
but the past holds you enslaved
I have to let go of it or it will tear me apart

The rain is coming,
stormclouds are gathering above
I know it's time for me to go

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
