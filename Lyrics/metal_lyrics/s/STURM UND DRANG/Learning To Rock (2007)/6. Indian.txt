Maybe one day in a place without time, without space
I can look back and see that I am finally whole
Dying to undo the moment when all fell apart
Trying to fade out what's real it's not for a life

[Chorus:]
One brief moment brought agony blackened my heart
No light for me, no way out, I'm next in line
Never ever, in this life I'll never find peace
Digging my own grave, I'm shot down in flames

You were my guardian angel, you saved me all times
But angels will fall burning, all candles have burned out
There is one way to escape but worse things will await
I'll let him take me, eternity will pay my price

[Chorus]
[Solo]

Maybe one day in a place without time, without space
I can look back and see that I am finally whole
That's what I hoped but now I don't believe anymore
My wounds won't heal, I will bleed til the death of my soul

[Chorus]
