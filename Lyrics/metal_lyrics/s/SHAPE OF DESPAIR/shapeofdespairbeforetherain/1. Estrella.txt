[originally by Lycia]you
peach lips rose hips
wrapped around you
you
sonlight skintight
heaven bound
stars fly
birds sigh winds cry
beneath the ground
my love
angel grin blessed within
lost and found
climb into the skin cocoon
above our limbs... the harvest moon
into the night... we fight, consumed
with shouts of fire and hearts in bloom
you
dizzy kiss our bodies twist
void of sound
you
in my arms away from harm
above the clouds
with cotton candy lips like dew
your pretty face and eyes of blue
inside your heart is heaven true
forever and always am i with you
