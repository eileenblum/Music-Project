Years of breathing
This consuming
Black sphere
That surrounds me
Life in your future
Exists not for me
All clouded
And unresolved
As I helplessly watch
The descending of
The final inner night
To see the self
Disintegrate
All clouded
And unresolved
As I helplessly watch
The descending of
The final inner night
