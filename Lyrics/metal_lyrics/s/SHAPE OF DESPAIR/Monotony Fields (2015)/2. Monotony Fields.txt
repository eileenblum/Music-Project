Taken down
Gone my will
Touch the ground
Perpetual void
Beneath a voice
A sigh from afar
Moments between
Remember still
What was sought
And not found
All that was lost
On these monotony fields
Folding in
Ever deeper
Into the undertow
Of thoughts
Drifting through
The pale landscapes
Of the withering mind
It would have been so different
Without this burden
This sense of nothingness
The lifelong defeat
That took us here
To a distance unreachable
To a grey indifference
Into these vast
Monotony fields
