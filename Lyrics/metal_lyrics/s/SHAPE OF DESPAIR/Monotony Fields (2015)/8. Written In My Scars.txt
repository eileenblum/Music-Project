Salute it more
O thee great misery
Long-past deceased
As reborn
Misleads your path
As you running
Chase on the trails of misfortune

As they left you
In darkest tragedy
As louder you cry
Through all the times repeatedly
Still louder they cry
Tarnished they betray their hearts
The curse written in my scars

The curse written in my scars

It holds you calm
It's sinking fast
It holds you calm
It's sinking fast

Plain rot
Within my core
Blindfold and punish
Thereafter seem
Harbinger of requiem
