All life will be gone
soon leaving myself...
into the spheres of emotions...
emotions...
i thought... 
There's nothing left for me,
anymore... everything
is gone. 
Nothing left
to feel nor to understand.

I did not wanted 
to live my life
nor did i even wanted
to live for my death...
strong it is indeed...
life... strange to born for death...
