Fragile emptiness,
Cracking whilst I move
My hands (penetrating)
Through this silence.
I beheld this loneliness and
A dream in illusion...
It awakens me
In somber,
In drifting
Absurdness.

As a burden
This dream moves in me,
Tiding me inside,
Closing.

In it's shallowness
In it's entwined self,
Life torn widely open.

Flowing within this dream,
Slowly sleeping sleeping away,
Drifting from used reality.
