In emotion,
Carried fragements of hate,
Astrayed in blur of mind.

Raised the vanguished faults
...lost enlightement...
Buried senses of long lived
And deceased.

Awaken

All I can see,
In here,
Is that I've lost in illusion's play.
Bleaker and closer to heaven,
These shattered formations faint trail
Move this light.

Come closer to my mind,
Come through me.
Leave me behind,
To see,
Too faintly,
This absurd renewing.
