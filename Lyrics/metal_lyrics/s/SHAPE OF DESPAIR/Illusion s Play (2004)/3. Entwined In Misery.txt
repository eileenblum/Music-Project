All these years in absence
...forgiveness does not reveal itself...

...and emptiness falls before me...
And silence this life,
Every word is whispered through me
And all emotions will cry,
Leaving me still alone.
Every moment still awaits,
For nothing
It brings fir me.
Everythings is entwined in misery.

All these years in absence
...forgiveness does not reveal itself...
