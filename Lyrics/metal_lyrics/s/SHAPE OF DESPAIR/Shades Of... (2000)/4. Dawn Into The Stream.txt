This day travels within dense mist and
woke this clearer sight as the birth of the
night were seen... though my mind wandered
like a stream beside, carressing a sigh...
fading afar... closing me in, to astray. Still
motionless I am, I carry the seeds of
horror inside me. This pain... grows in me
and try to reach the other side... infinity of
dreams... and they all - each side in me - are
listening myself and my mind blacken...
fading like that gone sigh... and I fall...
down into the stream...
