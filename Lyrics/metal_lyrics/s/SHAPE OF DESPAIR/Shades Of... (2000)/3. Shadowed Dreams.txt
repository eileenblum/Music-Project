In here, every shadow in the ground passes
me by... slow... flickering above me. And
silently they (like in a dream) growl over
me... be-witched I do follow their beautiful
ways, beside tis wintry frozen palace. Take
me to another world, to another conscious-
ness... away of this time. And they do arose
me... and I do watch... with broken eyes
how this weather... forever will stay...
in my frozen heart...
