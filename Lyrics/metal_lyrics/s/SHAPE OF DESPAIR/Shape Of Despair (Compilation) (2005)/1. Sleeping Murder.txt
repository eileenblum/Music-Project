As the ray of light and we see it, in mourn
and so the light has fallen to bleach
As the sleeping murder (is) still haunting me
it hurts, I'm going insane, the starvation over sleep

Over sleep!

In the mist a flowing sadness sees you
Drenched to the world above - nothing breathes in you
And soon betray our love, is this destruction?
Our fall eternal in this sleeping murder

I'm the last one who makes you fall
As their spirits escape through your wounds

We will be caught by will
sadness, sleep now
As mere dreams
scars repair

sleeping soon
as the spirits
escape
Through your wound
