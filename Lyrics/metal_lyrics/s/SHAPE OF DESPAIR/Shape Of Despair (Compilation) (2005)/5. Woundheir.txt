Wound was the heir, the ruler within fire
closed my page, as hatred reigned higher I
did notice a knife and hills covered with
blood, was I the one who's life is most precious to this new "god"

Indeed I must be loved, for I killed many
thousands I opened with highest fashion,
pain didn't spare any of these pitiful humans,
that the whole earth is covered with
tempest and storm of urbans lay bleeding
and kissing my beloved feet

shall I not wait for the greatest hour when
this god sees the bloody shower
