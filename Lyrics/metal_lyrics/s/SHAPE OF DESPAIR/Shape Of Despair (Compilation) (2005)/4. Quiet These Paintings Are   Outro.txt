Why did you leave these colours so they'll fade?
but soon they will be as one for the moment
I will stare into this dim, silent sea
silent sea

and we'll suffer the kiss bright

on the fields vails emotion
live still never they'll return
as they are laid to rest
into this one lonely life
in which depths is growing
growing

as they are laid to rest
into this one lonely life
with depths is growing painfully into life
to die

into life
to die
