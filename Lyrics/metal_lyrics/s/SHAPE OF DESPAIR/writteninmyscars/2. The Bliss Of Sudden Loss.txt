No sense of horizon
at werge, of destruction
it strikes upon you
blessed as pursuing horde of raptors
this paralyzing glow
seduce us to abhorrence

It has begun
step up front, thee convicted
as centre of supreme terror
ina nest of evil deeds
the bliss of sudden loss
you can't resist it's decay
your world is dying
sinking to waters all shallow

Searing at the sun, it's crying
dashing down fire and blood
there's no one to follow
his heritage

It has begun
step up front, thee convicted
as centre of supreme terror
ina nest of evil deeds
the bliss of sudden loss
you can't resist it's decay
your world is dying
sinking to waters all shallow

No sense of horizon
at werge, of destruction
it strikes upon you
blessed as pursuing horde of raptors
this paralyzing glow
seduce us to abhorrence
