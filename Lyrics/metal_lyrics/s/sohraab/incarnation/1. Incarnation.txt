Feed me blood, turn on the night
I'm the monster of the dark, made out of fire
Dance with me let me creep on your skin
Show me how I make you crawl into desire

Long time ago sun started to die,
The day you wanted to touch my burning shadow
Then the blood of sun dropped in your eyes
And my bleeding out fixation made all the winds blow

I'm in love with my fire
I'm in love with your sinful eyes
I'm in love with my fire
And nothing can fix this love but night-time cries

Do you dare to stare in my eyes?
I make you suck my pain and fear into your veins
Mesmerizing, hypnotizing, your consciousness gone
Shameless moments disappear the future's trace

Ain't no light, ain't no dark, all the feelings are lost
And the creepy cold insanity is ruling my hand
Incarnation, sublimation of a dying soul
Drink acid water by my side and this is the end

Dream for me tonight
I see you by my side

Dream for me tonight
I see you by my side

Dream for me tonight
I see you by my side

Dream for me tonight
I see you by my side

Dream for me tonight
I see you by my side

Dream for me tonight
I see you by my side...
