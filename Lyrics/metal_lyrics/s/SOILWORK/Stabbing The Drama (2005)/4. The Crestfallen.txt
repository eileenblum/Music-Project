Don't question any lies,
There's no reason to find..
Another trip to cause a denial
Yet you're stripped and your hope is gone
Another trap for you to fall into
You swallow every threat that will enter your mind
Enter your mind!
A shadow just as dark as your past
Is leading the way through the web of desire
Healing all the wounds in your chest
Vengeance is rising...
Can I ever resolve, if it's a matter of time?

-Just remember..
Where you've spent your time
Can't respect all the tears you have cried
-Just remember..
How you've changed your life
Can't trace your fate with a pitiful crime..

Don't question any lies, there's no reason to find...
Another trip to cause a denial
Yet you're stripped and your hope is gone
Another trap for you to fall into..
Can I ever resolve, if it's a matter of do or die
Can I ever resolve, if it's a matter of time?

-Just remember..
Where you've spent your time
Can't respect all the tears you have cried
-Just remember..
How you've changed your life
Can't trace your fate with a pitiful crime..

There's no way you can dig much deeper
-if you think it's all right
assorting the right from the wrong ones,
that you have learned so well..
so well...

You're stuck, you can't remember
The light is turning dim, you're trapped
Although you've been there a thousand times
Before
You're stuck, you can't remember
The light is turning dim, you're trapped
Although you've been there a thousand times
Before

Crestfallen be thy name
Crestfallen be thy name
