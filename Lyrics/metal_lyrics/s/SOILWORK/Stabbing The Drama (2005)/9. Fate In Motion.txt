I'm facing a trauma, it's crawling inside
Don't walk that line, don't take that ride
Conclusions will show me the sweetest pain
Don't walk that line, don't take that ride..
(And I can't move at all now)
What I can see now, I don't want anyone else to see
(And I can't move at all now)
It doesn't matter somehow, what it does to me

Feel how the journey's just begun
Heading for disaster
Formed through the night and it's all mine..

The game is too easy for me to just play
It steals the day, it steals the day
Dividing the image in possible ways
It steals the day, it steals the day
And I can't move at all now
And I can't move at all now
What I can hear now, I don't want anybody else to hear
It doesn't matter somehow, what it does to me

Feel how the journey's just begun
Heading for disaster
Formed through the night and it's all mine..

Feel how the journey's just begun
Heading for disaster
Formed through the night and it's all mine..

Just pull me out, I have nothing to fear
In front of my eyes, never to leave
What I can see now, I don't want anyone else to see
It doesn't matter somehow, what it does to me
What I can hear now, I don't want anybody else to hear
It doesn't matter somehow, what it does to me
