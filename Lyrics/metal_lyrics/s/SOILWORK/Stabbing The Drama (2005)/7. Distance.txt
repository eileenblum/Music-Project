Can you please remind me where the fuck I've been
Cause I can't find it out you see
So return me to a vital place
From a distant observation
Corrosion of emotions
Is how you block your state
From scratch to revelation
It's all been there, bleeding for someone to dare
Extension of deceptions, brings you to your final collapse
Am I really an exception?

Is that your only entertainment? (Spoiling your desire)
To blow your minds on a one-way track
From a distance...

Building knowledge out of flexible existence
Hunt for adrenaline is staggering, grand lack of emotions
You'll never face conclusions, you'll get what you want
Am I really an exception?

Is that your only entertainment? (Spoiling your desire)
To blow your minds on a one-way track
I tell you a lie and you make it a statement (Sleeping in denial)
You're all wasting the time of your lives

Cold and crawling, you made it back
Fear is selling and your one with the fact
Counting the days for rebirth
Lost once again and how it hurts...

[Solo: Wichers]

Is that your only entertainment? (Spoiling your desire)
To blow your minds on a one-way track
I tell you a lie and you make it a statement (Sleeping in denial)
You're all having the time of your lives

(You're wasting...)
Is that your only entertainment? (You're wasting...)
To blow your minds on a one-way track
(You're wasting...)
I tell you a lie and you make it a statement (You're wasting...)
You're all wasting the time of your lives
