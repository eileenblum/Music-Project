Now I'm one with the flies
Rising up as the creature cries
Sucking up, breathing stops..
-For the very last time!

Can you see it, can you reach it,
As it climbs to the top of your spine
Such a healer, can't believe it
I'm left so far behind
Born to please, to release
Wide open and undefined
Crashing down in a velvet hall
Side by side
Narcotic-injected, erotic-respected
-It suits your kind, cause you're one with the flies
Can you feel it, can you cease it
As it crawls to the top of your spine
Such a healer, self redeemer
-I keep thinking that it seems like it's not fair..

(Reach out) And choke with me, reach out
Cause it's killing me..
Down! Bring down this sheer submission
Down! You know you have to bring it..
Down! Deranged from a mind pollution
Down! Pitch black but unrefined

Such a healer, can't believe it
I keep thinking that it seems like it's not fair...

(Reach out) And choke with me, reach out
Cause it's killing me..
Down! Bring down this sheer submission
Down! You know you have to bring it..
Down! Deranged from a mind pollution
Down!

Deceiver, believer -don't need you tonight
You've spilled enough blood, you've wasted my life..

[Solo: Wichers]

-You know you have to bring it..
Down! Bring down this sheer submission
Down! You know you have to bring it..
Down! Deranged from a mind pollution
Down! And screw that common sense..
Down! Fight back those limitations
Down! And screw that common sense!
