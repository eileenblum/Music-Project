Call it liberation or frustration,
As it hits like a bomb
Tearing you apart as you're first in line,
Entering the zone
Watch how it runs, a nerve wrecking resistance
Watch how it burns, a venomous script's getting formed
You've traveled a long way to get here
And now it's waking you up..

Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn

Watch how it runs, watch how it burns
And it's all a deception
Break it and learn, there's no return
For a presence like mine..
You've traveled a long way to get here...
It's getting all so clear now, all the
Things I know
An elapse of conscious progress will last forevermore
My courageous insanity follows
An infinite time
I'll be attaching the world
On my shoulders
Without a look inside
Inside

Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn

Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
