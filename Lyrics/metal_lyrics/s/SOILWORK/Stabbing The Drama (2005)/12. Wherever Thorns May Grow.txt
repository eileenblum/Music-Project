I'm gaining trust for a lifetime
Wherever thorns may grow
Bleeding wounds turn to prosperity
With a distinguished revolt
Better not fail with a guideline
Rather not to die with any seconds denied
Shelter runs by for the final time
Just take a step outside

Just stab the reason and make it bleed
(Stab it and watch it bleed)
It's becoming one with the guilt that you feel

Better take a look inside
Will you ever realize, the greatest effort ever known
Before you let the pain decide, run back and you'll only find
Resurrection through it all

Better start to deal with your tension
Rather not fade as you've gone through it all
Shelter turns blank without redemption
You're destined to make the call

You think it's time to just give it away
(Giving it back as you've failed)
Reconsider the vibe as you forget and forsake

Better take a look inside
Will you ever realize, the greatest effort ever known
Before you let the pain decide, run back and you'll only find
Resurrection through it all

I've got my mind made up
Shock, denial, anger, acceptance
I'll watch those demons drop
For my presence, for my sake

[Solo: Wichers]

Better take a look inside
Will you ever realize, the greatest effort ever known
Before you let the pain decide, run back and you'll only find
Resurrection through it all
