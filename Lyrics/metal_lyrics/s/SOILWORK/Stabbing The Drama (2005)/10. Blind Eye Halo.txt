I came here to justify, such a thing would never cross your mind
Those scars that you wear, seem like they lie and won't disappear
Once again you will cross that line, without reflection
Filthy and defined, information: dead to the nation

B, manic, L, cynic, I, auto, N, matic, D

Pretentious, every detail is built to get you through
An universal looking glass, information: dead to the nation

B, manic, L, cynic, I, auto, N, matic, D

What ever happened to you mind-fucking system
It's all so shattering, so battering to the core..
Watch that halo grow, on an everlasting lane
Such an animated pleasure-dome, doomed to carry infected flames

[Solo: Frenning, Wichers]
