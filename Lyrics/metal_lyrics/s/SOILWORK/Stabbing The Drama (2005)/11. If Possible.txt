If possible just turn the page
And all you'll see remains the same
I wish I could blame it on a face without a name
In the center of the place I hate
There's no escape, that's what they say
Without a name..
I've vanished since the anger came

Bitterness, sums up the truth I swear
And I won't dread my time

I won't leave today..
As long as I can take the words you stake
No matter how the hell I make
The desperation go away
Without a name...

Bitterness, sums up the truth I swear
And I won't dread my time
Meaningless and unsincere
Hold back those tears, rewind..

Come to the point with an illusion
It's there but it's not a revolution
You'll bare what is not your responsibility
All that is left of what you used to be

Bitterness, sums up the truth I swear
And I won't dread my time
Meaningless and unsincere
Hold back those tears, rewind..

Hold back those tears, rewind..
