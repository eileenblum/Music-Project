[Japanese bonus track]

Slowly slicing forward, into the flesh.
Incentive ways to enter the night.
Reality turns it's back on you,
A chance to get you through.
Burning, brighter than the sun,
Searching, to summon the suspicion.
It's getting harder to see,
Searching, for the killing ignition,
To fulfill what you need.

So, is it time to let it go?
All the pain that you have owned?
Unleash the crimson rebellion,
You'll never see, what I can see.

So, is it time to let it go,
All the pain that you have owned?
Revoke the burning ambition,
As you despise reality.

The enemy's sleeping silent, in your head.
He's not there to get you through.
Of all the bastards that ever intended to make you lose,
This is the one you can't fool.

I won't, reach a point of disaster.
I won't, neglect to think in distress.
I know, you've you got manic depression.
I know, you've faced on everything.

So, is it time to let it go?
All the pain that you have owned?
Unleash the crimson rebellion,
You'll never see, what I can see.

So, is it time to let it go,
All the pain that you have owned?
Revoke the burning ambition,
(As you despise) As you despise reality.

So, is it time to let it go?
All the pain that you have owned?
Unleash the crimson rebellion,
You'll never see, what I can see.

So, is it time to let it go,
All the pain that you have owned?
Revoke the burning ambition,
As you despise reality.
