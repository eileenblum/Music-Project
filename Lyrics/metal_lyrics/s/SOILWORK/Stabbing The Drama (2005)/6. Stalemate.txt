Just pick one and make it all come through
Infiltrated and fucked up for years
And now it just suddenly turns to you
In a second, in no time
Rise up, get up, stay up, fed up
With the brand new sensation
I'll bring back what's mine
No, sense for sanity
No, sense for clarity
No, sense for dignity
Just ask once and it's coming straight to you
-Overrated and blinded by fear
Inspiration turns to dust as you've had your share
Rise up, get up, stay up, fed up
With the illumination
I'll take back what's mine
No, sense for sanity
No, sense for clarity
No, sense for dignity

And I say (now gimme your best shot)
Wait a lifetime to pull it off
And I say (is that all that you've got?)
Wake up in no time and blow it off..

No use for frustration, if you can't get through
And you think your pride will do
To get to your spot
Rise up, get up, stay up, fed up
With the brand new sensation
No, sense for sanity
No, sense for clarity
No, sense for dignity
No, sense for empathy
No, sense for sanity
Will stop you now..

And I say (now gimme your best shot)
Wait a lifetime to pull it off
And I say (is that all that you've got?)
Wake up in no time and blow it off..

Now gimme your best shot
Now gimme your best shot
Now gimme your best shot
Now gimme your best shot

Just pick one and make it all come through
Infiltrated and fucked up for years
And now it just suddenly turns to you
In a second, in no time
Rise up, get up, stay up, fed up
With the brand new sensation
I'll bring back what's mine
I'll take back what's mine
No, sense for sanity
No, sense for clarity
No, sense for dignity
