I woke up that morning
Feeling slightly stressed
Getting in an urge to just bail out completely pissed

What did I know?
That night we made our way
Through the darkness
And the shame

[Chorus:]
Don't let yourself run away
Cause we have another game to play
That night you would make us say:
"Fuck all the details, get on with the show"

It doesn't matter if the mind's at stake
Cause we had another round to make
There was no way we could fail
Fuck all the details, get on with the show

The Pittsburgh Syndrome!

An hour of destruction
Intoxicated bliss
Moments of sobriety
Would cease to exist
A sudden turn
Would make that city burn with souls on fire
Relentless desire

[Chorus:]
Don't let yourself run away
Cause we have another game to play
That night you would make us say:
"Fuck all the details, get on with the show"

It doesn't matter if the mind's at stake
Cause we had another round to maker
There was no way we could fail
Fuck all the details, get on with the show

The Pittsburgh Syndrome!

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Don't let yourself run away
Cause we had another game to play
That night you would make us say:
Fuck all the details, get on with the show

It doesn't matter if the mind's at stake
Cause we had another round to make
There was no way we could fail
Fuck all the details, get on with the show
