Here lies the quest
Right upon you
It's time to make a stand
Now, whether you like it or not
You better deal with it once again
This time it's essential
This time it's for real
In life there's just questions
Successively wasting your time
A gradual restraint of the mind

I let my feelings show, don't know where I'm at
It doesn't give you the right to use me...
I know I'm better than that...

My emptiness fills the holes of your predictable questions...
So give me no lectures, don't you sell me your kind

[Chorus:]
20 more miles in the rain
20 more getting drained
I can't redeem myself
But I still can figure it out

20 miles in the rain
20 more getting sane
I shouldn't reveal myself
But I still could figure it out

Don't let me go through this with nothing
Nothing to salvage a possible fall
Though I still have my conscience to guide me
It concerns me enough to believe

I let my feelings show, don't know where I'm at
It doesn't give you the right to use me...
I know I'm better than that...

My emptiness fills the holes of your predictable questions...
So give me no lectures, don't you sell me your kind

[Chorus:]
20 more miles in the rain
20 more getting drained
I can't redeem myself
But I still can figure it out

20 miles in the rain
20 more getting sane
I shouldn't reveal myself
But I still could figure it out

[Solo]

20 more miles in the rain
20 more getting drained
I can't redeem myself
But I still can figure it out

20 miles in the rain
20 more getting sane
I shouldn't reveal myself
But I still could figure it out
