Pay not attention
For what it's worth
'Cause whatever I'll say
Turn into dirt
Here comes the sane
Here comes the remains
Ball and chain
Here comes the remains
Here comes the sane
Here comes the remains
Ball and chain
It's all the same

Since when did my life have a meaning?
Since when did I have a choice?

To make my way through this ravaged landscape
As a disposable toy

The sun will embark
With a trembling notion
Claiming I once had it all...

[Chorus:]
Time, giving it time
We are still miles apart
Insatiable
It's just fine, aware of what's mine
Can't make it more obvious
The snare broken by lust

Since when did my life have a meaning?
Since when did I have a choice?

To make my way through this ravaged landscape
As disposable toy

You've had your countless hours
I've had my moments of grace
But every time it devours
It'll catch that ugly face

The sun will embark
With a trembling notion
Claiming I once had it all, but...
I reach for defiance, I reach for despair
There is nothing that can keep me from making the ultimate sacrifice
All I want, all I would ever dare to accomplish
Is in the hands of the deceiver...

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Time, giving it time
We are still miles apart
Insatiable
It's just fine, aware of what's mine
Can't make it more obvious
The snare broken by lust

Giving it time
We are still miles apart
Insatiable
It's just fine
