Please don't put it into words
'Cause I fear what you're thinking
...It's gonna make it hurt
You better not try to make me
Believe in someone new

[Chorus:]
Faithless
On my way
Defenceless
From my heart, won't you be
Heartless, here with me
Breathless, from this night's misery
This night will start the Exile... RUN!

Now you tell me what it was worth
Was it meant to be broken
The circle that wouldn't shed a single tear
And now you wanna redirect me from the face of the earth
Not willing to share your time
Not near
Not far
I'm just a spectator, once loved
Just fear
Just scars
A sheer introduction to what I've lost, to what I've lost...

[Chorus:]
Faithless
On my way
Defenceless
From my heart, won't you be
Heartless, here with me
Breathless, from this night's misery
(from this night's misery)
One more endless night...

To notice all the things I have to be...

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Faithless
on my way
Won't forget...
From my heart, won't you be
Heartless, here with me
Breathless, from this night's misery
This night will start the exile... RUN!
