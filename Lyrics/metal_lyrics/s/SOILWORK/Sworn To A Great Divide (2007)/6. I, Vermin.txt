Hide away from the restless
They're making trails as they've failed once again
Behind that colony of well shaped nightmares
Is where the vermin depends

[Bridge:]
High and low
They'll bring the tooth and nail
Fast or slow
Will you give me just one damn second to bail out of reach?
Before I'll do as you please... cause...

[Chorus:]
Me eyes call for definition
They will capture the vile as they seek
Down low lurks the opposition
I just hope you won't categorize me

The truth is ugly, raw and malignant
The message is as cold as despair
'Cause you're no better than anyone I've ever known
If only love could be real...

[Bridge:]
High and low
They'll bring the tooth and nail
Fast or slow
Will you give me just one damn second to bail out of reach?
Before I'll do as you please

High and low
They'll bring the tooth and nail
Fast or slow
one damn second to bail out of reach?
Before I'll do as you please

'Cause I might be wrong...
Am I the only one who sees that the damage is done
And it won't be long...
Before I lose my faith and make a run become like you...

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
My eyes call for definition
They will capture that vile as they seek
Down low lurks the opposition
I just hope you won't categorize me

High and low
They'll bring the tooth and nail
Fast or slow
Will you give me just one damn second to bail out of reach?
Before I'll do as you please

High and low
They'll bring the tooth and nail
Fast or so slow
Give me just one damn second to bail out of reach?
Before I'll do as you please
