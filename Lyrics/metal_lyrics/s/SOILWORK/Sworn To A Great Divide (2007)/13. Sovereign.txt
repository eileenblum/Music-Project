[Number 12 on the Japanese album, bonus track]

I felt the urge of knowing
despite the fear of who I am
where the truth stands tall
and where nothing is a sin
is there anything more
that tells me where to begin
with nothing to guide me

except a poisoned well
I let the demons rest
and believe myself
redeem myself!

Life's not bigger than this
I'm sorry but you have to leave
You have been deceived
now just wake up your belief
don't worry, you wont stand a chance
as a broken man...

Just like you...

I wanna know
if time will capture
the scars I've worn
just let me hold the future
for once
out of my daily life
I can't reject what's obviously wrong
cause I'm blind, selfishly blind (Blind!)
selfishly blind

Life's not bigger than this
I'm sorry but you have to leave
You have been deceived
now just wake up your belief
don't worry, you wont stand a chance
as a broken man..

Just like you...

See me bury the hatchet
Life will suck me dry
Pass on all the details
When I will get it right...get it right...

Life's not bigger than this
I'm sorry but you have to leave
You have been deceived
now just wake up your belief
don't worry, you wont stand a chance
as a broken man...

Life's not bigger than this
I'm sorry but you have to leave
You have been deceived
now just wake up your belief
don't worry, you wont stand a chance
as a broken man...

Get it right!
