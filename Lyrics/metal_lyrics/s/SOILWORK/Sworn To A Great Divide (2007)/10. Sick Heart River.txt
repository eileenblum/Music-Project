Leaning against what' next to me
Have no fear, won't see
Will it eat me up or bring me down
I'll gradually make up my mind, my mind...

Revolution within myself
I'm puzzled, still overwhelmed
By the stories that you would tell
They always send me something
Revolution within myself... within myself...

Let me give my best, I won't depend
This time I will make another plan to find
What's left and nothing less, still I won't tread
I'll find my own way to make it all worthwile

Call, call on me darkness
Wait, wait on me now...
Won't you say...
Say that I'm sorry
'Cause I won't wait

I've found another form
It's breeding life
It must have been there
The whole time when I was dead
'Cause I was pledged to emptiness
And now I've let myself
To see all the thins
I just didn't expect

Still I remember, still I repent
I'd walk through
The never the never
Despite my descent

Reborn, acknowledging the part of me that once was lost
I have repressed, too many years, my utopia was within my grasp

Doomed in absentia, left to be sentenced
Still rising to cherish, all the things I have left...

[Solo]

Call, call on me darkness
Wait, wait on me now...
Won't you say...
Say that I'm sorry
'Cause I won't wait
