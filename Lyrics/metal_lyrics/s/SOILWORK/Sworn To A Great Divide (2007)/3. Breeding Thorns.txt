You have not seen the last of me
I'm breeding thorns
I'll follow your footsteps down below
I will trust all my instincts and bring it home.

Does it appeal to you now as a part of the violation?
That wherever it takes you, you won't be able to choose.

I will carry the message, it will swallow you whole

[Chorus:]
You ain't never gonna tell again
Caught as the founder of the emptiness
It must have made you stocked
whenever my pride was taken, again and again...

Again and again

Now put your envy in motion, one step at a time
I wanna see the closure when your access is denied

I will bury the damage, I will drench the device

[Chorus]

Now I want you to tell me (tell me again), do you see what I see?
'cause it's so damn obvious to me

[Solo]

(Whenever a promise taken...)

Won't you tell me that it's raw?

[Chorus]

You ain't never gonna tell again.
