So the idol you preached
Has turned to nothing
It was making your way through the dust when searching
You never thought it would give you up
Your beloved scapegoat
You never thought it would interrupt
Your sweet escape...

[Bridge:]
Those were the times when you cranked it all up
You soared for the moment, without wings to lift up...

[Chorus:]
I'm crossing that line with a state of mind
One more night missed out
As if I was blind to the fact
It won't wait...
Won't you carry me home?

Did you do it all for nothing
Or did it make you sure of something
No matter the subjection
Or the mystery of life was just put on hold

You will alway treasure the things
That reject you and possess you
Breeding new life through the eyes of the insane
And it all comes down to you...

[Bridge:]
Those were the times when you cranked it all up
You soared for the moment, without wings to lift up...
But tonight...

[Chorus:]
I'm crossing that line with a state of mind
One more night missed out
As if I was blind to the fact
It won't wait...
Won't you carry me home?

Nothing can touch such a mind in distress
Won't you find another bright solution
Crossing that river, get away with what's left...
Eternally stuck in the realm of confusion...

[Solo]

But tonight...
I'm crossing that line with a state of mind
One more night missed out

As if I was blind to the fact
It won't wait...
Won't you carry me home?

[Chorus:]
I'm crossing that line with a state of mind
One more night missed out
As if I was blind to the fact
It won't wait...

Won't you carry me home, carry me...
