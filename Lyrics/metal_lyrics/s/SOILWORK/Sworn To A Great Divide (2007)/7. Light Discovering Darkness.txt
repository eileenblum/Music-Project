Light, time is on my side
Well you better believe it's true
Cause you can't make me run

They call it life
Covered 'till it makes you blind
Do you wanna make the trip outside
Then you better start running

I won't let it distract me...

[Chorus:]
Out...
I can't believe it's true
You better just shut it...
Out...
They won't let me pull it through
Shut it... out
Can I push my luck on you
Don't shut me out...
Again...
'Cause you better shut it out...

Define...
The shelter as the time goes by
It will change 'till you can't decide
Now you're left without nothing...

I won't let you distract me...

[Chorus:]
Out...
I can't believe it's true
You better just shut it...
Out...
They won't let me pull it through
Shut it... out
Can I push my luck on you
Don't shut me out...
Again...
Cause you better shut it...

I feel it too, I feel it
I feel it too, no I can't see anything true...

I won't let it distract me...
I won't let you distract me...

[Chorus:]
Out...
I can't believe it's true
You better just shut it...
Out...
They won't let me pull it through
Shut it... out
Can I push my luck on you
Don't shut me out...
I can't believe it's true
They won't let me pull it through
Don't shut me out...
Out...
Don't shut me out...
Again...
Cause you better shut it...
