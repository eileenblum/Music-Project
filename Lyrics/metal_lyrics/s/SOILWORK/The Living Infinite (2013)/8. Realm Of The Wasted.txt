[Music: Coudret; Lyrics: Strid]

Is it still me
Who controls my universe?
I won't be objective
I don't want any of your lies
Such desperate ways
To control and capture my attention
Please look away
While I make my escape

There's something more
That will enhance all my visions
A personal war
Against all gratification
So leave it behind
Erasing all of yesterday
Build your own world
Let go of their shield

Let go of their shield

All your generic pieces
Of human flesh
Will lead the way
For every fool

The wasted
Follow all your rules
Leaving for something
Better than it seems

I broke the record
Of pleasing someone else
We stand together
As long as someone makes amends
The shit you read
Guidance to self destruction
We make it bleed
To wake each other up

The wasted
Follow all your rules
Leaving for something
Better than it seems

Now does it hurt too much?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Too deny every second
Of a prosperous life
Where you make the call
I will be sheltered
I see no loss
I make my own decisions
For my own cause

[Solo: Karlsson/Coudret]

Break out... Break out...
Don't let the shield get to you

The wasted
Follow all your rules
Leaving for something
Better than it seems
