[Music: Coudret, lyrics: Strid]

Are you here to watch me
Fall on my knees
You've done it again, I'm out of reach
What was the reason, what was the cause
For you to be able to change who I was

But you can't leech from me
Now there's nothing to fear

Your acts keep setting me aside
How? Will I ever know...?
Tell me why

Is it worth to cut through
The state that I'm in
When our almighty mother
Constantly wins
But I'm not here to fight you
You gave me life
But I won't understand
If I was put here to die

But you can't leech from me
Now there's nothing to fear

Your acts keep setting me aside
How? Will I ever know...?
Tell me why
Your acts keep telling me to fly
But I feel like I'm needed though
Show me why

The right time to reveal the rapture
I want to know where my steaks are at
The truth hurts
But I feel that I've served well
I hope the living
Can cope with collapse...collapse

[Solo: Coudret]

The creation â I've embraced
So enrich me â I won't fail

I will never trace your path
But I will challenge
And dispose all my wrath

But you can't leech from me
Now there's nothing to fear

Your acts keep setting me aside
How? Will I ever know...?

Are you here to watch me
Fall on my knees
You've done it again, I'm out of reach
What was the reason, what was the cause
For you to be able to change who I was
