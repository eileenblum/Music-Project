[Music: Andersson, lyrics: Strid]

Need for attention
Need for solace
In this abuse-ridden world
I've fallen into oblivion with you
A mental hand shake of fools

This life has gotten us all
The paradox still remains
We live to choke the difference
Carry the weight of an awful fate
That's what they told you to do

Nothing's changed
Nothing will
We still live the other truth
It makes us cope
With our need for violence...
Nothing's changed
Nothing will
We still give
The water's still
But it still drowns our wish
With silence

I can laugh in the face of god
Cause I wont be loved in the end
Look at all the pain that I've felt
The truth that I've bent to accommodate
Myself

A sideshow with misery
An affair with no dignity
I've lost myself.. I've lost myself

[Solo: Andersson]

This life has gotten us all
The paradox still remains
We live to choke the difference
Carry the weight of an awful fate
That's what they told you to do

Nothing's changed
Nothing will
We still live the other truth
It makes us cope
With our need for violence...
Nothing's changed
Nothing will
We still give, the waters still
But it still drowns our wish
With silence

While the silence remains
You and I pick the change
The scraps of a lost free will
I won't bother, you won't see
But we can sense the infinite dream

I can laugh in the face of god
Cause I won't be loved in the end
Look at all the pain that I've felt

The truth that I've bent to accommodate
Myself
A sideshow with misery
An affair with no dignity
I've lost myself...
