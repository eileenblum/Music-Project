[Music &amp; Lyrics: Strid]

Surrender... Will there still be a place for me to grow?
Transcend me beyond this source we thought we knew

Like the river kissed this darkened sea
The shelter has to be somewhere beneath

Let me go... To where the purity comes alive
Drown me... In the living infinite, let me go

I will be one with the abyss, it will bring me to life
Return all the memories, be reborn through the night
A motherly farewell, a tear leaves the eye
I tremble with emotion as I bid goodbye

Like the river kissed this darkened sea
The shelter has to be somewhere beneath

A swirl of emotions
I'm being dragged by the tide
I will turn to my maker
To watch me drown in the great divide...
Great divide

[Solo: Andersson]

Let me go... To where the purity comes alive
Drown me... In the living infinite
I will go... To where the vanity won't survive
Drown me... In the living infinite, let me go
