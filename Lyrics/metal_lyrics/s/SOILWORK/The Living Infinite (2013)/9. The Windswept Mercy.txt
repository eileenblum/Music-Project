[Music &amp; Lyrics: Strid]

Out we go, we've been ruthless
The tears of time, makes it endless
Give me another life
That will grant me with its solace

Watch it burn...

The need for light
That would guide us
Has gone away
While we progressed
Tell me now, does it die
When we turn our heads
And walk away

Walk away...

The winds swept all of our mercy
It won't never ever come back
Now the pain we feel is worthy
Watch us carry the final collapse
The final collapse

What can we do ?
Resurrect the ashes ?
Can we stick it through?
And forgive ourselves?
Our minds are covered with dust
Our need are filthy
Our hands are tied but we still see
That we are guilty
So deliver us from broken dreams
Return us from this mental siege
Throw us back in the cradle of time
And heel our desperate ways...

The winds swept all of our mercy
It won't never ever come back
Now the pain we feel is worthy
Watch us carry the final collapse...
The final collapse

Out we go... Out we go...
