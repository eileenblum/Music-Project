[Music &amp; Lyrics: Strid]

I reckon you have something to say
Like you always do
Disguised with an urge to control
Like always, it's all about you
And the plans that you've made

Never and ever I will let you in
Cause you command lives
With passion
A hidden agenda has risen from
Your precious insecurity... now

How could anyone
Stand to be around you?
The profound you... Let me be
Always seem to feel
How we're safe and sound to
Relate to you
Your broken dream is all I see

The way you get to me
Still puzzles my thoughts
It ought to cease
When the day is done
But it tears me apart
It twists my conscience
I've never felt such impact
On my emotions

I cringe by your presence
I hide and I tremble
I feel no connection
Just disgust and anger
I lash out from memories
Daggers of the mind
I've tried so hard... please believe me

How could anyone
Stand to be around you?
The profound you... Let me be
Always seem to feel
How we're safe and sound to
Relate to you... To you

Did I put this curse upon myself?
It shatters my daydreams alone
Do I leave or just ignore the fact
That it will never leave my system?

I see you've found a way
To infiltrate the poison
It's really more than I can take

I hereby declare you non-existent
Never to return... Go!

How could anyone
Stand to be around you?
The profound you... Let me be
Always seem to feel
How we're safe and sound to
Relate to you
Your broken dream is all I feel
