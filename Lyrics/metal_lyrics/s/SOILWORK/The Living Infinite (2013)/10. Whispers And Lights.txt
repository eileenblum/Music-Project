[Music: Andersson; Lyrics: Strid]

What if I chose a path of no return
What if I gave you the tools
To ruin my life
Would you gladly accept
And steal all my time
Do I control what is missing
And where does it end
Cover my eyes

The wind blows whispers of doom
I'm in tears
Getting a notion it's time to rise
To rise

What is the purpose of being
What makes me alive?
What is it that limits my reach for
Something outside?
Why do I dream, are you trying to
Tell me what's next
But there's no use for me waiting
Around 'til it hits
Cover my eyes... Cover my eyes

The wind blows whispers of doom
I'm in tears
Getting a notion it's time to rise
The wind blows whispers of doom
I'm in tears
Getting a notion it's time to rise

I'll face whatever may come

Whispers and lights

All mistakes by misassociation
Lead to the darkest of times
Here I am with a new declaration
It's all mine and it reads : all out war!

Cramped up soul
Cramped up soul

What if I chose a path of no return
What if I gave you the tools
To ruin my life
Cover my eyes... Cover my eyes

The wind blows whispers of doom
I'm in tears
Getting a notion it's time to rise
The wind blows whispers of doom
I'm in tears
Getting a notion it's time to rise

I'll face whatever may come
