[music: Strid/Andersson, lyrics: Strid]

My eyes are bleeding
Theyâve searched
For someone else
Addicted to the hunt
And end up somewhere else
Where the expendable souls go
There must be more to this
Iâm right in here
Staring through
A glass wall
I tell you this my friend
We must be bigger
Than momentary bliss

Donât let the light you see
Restrain you
Donât put your trust
In the dark outside
There will be more
Than you ever could die for
This Momentary Bliss is a lie

Cause my eyes they are bleeding

Iâm off to treasure
A brand new emotion
Iâm taking off
Like a demon of fate
I reckon something
Will see my devotion
For I may be the one to get closer

Closer to what lies beneath 
Iâm gazing right into
A well of redemption

Donât let the light you see
Restrain you
Donât put your trust
In the dark outside
There will be more
Than you ever could die for
This Momentary Bliss is a lie

Donât let the light you see
Restrain you
Donât put your trust
In the dark outside
There will be more
Than you ever could die for
This Momentary Bliss is a lie

The enemy is what you feel
Believe my words
The enemy is what you feel
And see itâs real

[SOLO: Andersson]

Donât let the light you see
Restrain you
Donât put your trust
In the dark outside
There will be more
Than you ever could die for
This Momentary Bliss is a lie

Cause my eyes they are bleeding
