[Music &amp; Lyrics: Andersson]

First the silence, then the chaos
Faces burn, end up flickering light
First the hunting, then the killing
May your demons surrender tonight

If you're looking for your gods beneath the dying sun
No one here can mend your soul before it comes undone

There's no one here to guide you
There's no one here to bring you home

Let the first wave rise
Let your weakness subside
Let the first wave rise
LET-IT-RISE

First the symptoms, then the sickness
Last caress with your own trembling hands
First the victim, then the weakness
Well, it's too late to make your own amends

If you're looking for the proof behind your dying flesh
In the shadows find the answers that you once possessed

There's no one here to guide you
There's no one here to bring you home

Let the first wave rise
Let your weakness subside
Let the first wave rise

First the silence, then the chaos
First the silence, then the chaos
First the silence, then the chaos
First the silence, then the chaos

[SOLO 1: Coudret]
[SOLO 2: Andersson]

Let the first wave rise
Let your weakness subside
Let the first wave rise
LET-IT-RISE
