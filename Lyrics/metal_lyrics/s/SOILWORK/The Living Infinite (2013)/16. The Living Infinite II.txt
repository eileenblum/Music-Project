[Music &amp; Lyrics: Strid]

The shackles of a lifetime
Are bound to be broken
My fate will be sinking
To a world beneath

Dedicating my hopes and fears
To the world below
It will swallow all my visions
And turn them into gold
I wanna pierce the surface of dreams
I wanna go where there is no need
To accommodate my beliefs
And preserve the disease

There will be no one to tell you why
Why we need to pursue our dreams
A gift of resemblance
Without the greed
A new constitution

It will bring us apart
Then build it all up
To challenge our fearful waters
I can sense what it's like
And what if it might
Be the key to a new conclusion

Stay aware of all that you bare
Far below the sun
(I'll take you there)
It won't ever cease, it numbs the feel
So unlock the damage done
(I'll take you there)

The feelings you carry won't ever die
They're one with eternity
The tears you've shed
The words you said

Are all a part of a constant realm
Withering emotions
Turn into mindful dust
The reality you've known
Has always fed your trust

There will be on one to tell you why
Why we need to pursue our dreams
A gift of resemblance
Without the greed
A new constitution...

Believe me,
There will be something else
That drains you
From unwelcomed distress
So bring it to a whole new dimension
Captured in the deep

[Solo: Andersson]

It will bring us apart
Then build it all up
To challenge our fearful waters
Can sense what it's like
And what if it might
Be the key to a new conclusion

Stay aware of all that you bare
Far below the sun
(I'll take you there)
It won't ever cease. It numbs the feel
So unlock the damage done

Stay aware of all that you bare
Far below the sun
(I'll take you there)
It won't ever cease, it numbs the feel
So unlock the damage done
(I'll take you there)
