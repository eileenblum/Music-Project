[Music: Andersson, lyrics: Strid]

Who cares but sorrow
When you're down and close to nothing
No one will bother
Watching antidotes in passing

I'm left without a cause
Believe me...
They never told me why
I'm grieving
Now where is the light?

Outside the world goes on
It keeps on turning
The feeling of being an outcast
Just keeps growing

There must be life... there must be light
Take me home, where the truth unfolds
And steals away the night

Distance keeps growing
Soon I'm far enough to lose it
Am I deserving
Cause I was brave enough to use it?

I'm left without a cause
Believe me...
They never told me why
I'm grieving
Now where is the light?

Outside the world goes on
It keeps on turning
The feeling of being an outcast
Just keeps growing

There must life.. there must be light
Take me home, where the truth unfolds
And steals away the night
Steals away the night
