[Music: Andersson; Lyrics: Strid]

I've been a failure
I've been a success
Those smiles
Were a gift from the blessed
So tell me
Where do I go from here
I've been brought up
With an aimless tear
On bloodstained fields
Of broken dreams
I've lost it all
In the upward stream
This time I gotta set free
What lurks deep inside of me

Watch the power leave your chapped palms
It all comes together
Through influential tongues

The hated see the light of day
And here comes the sane
They're aching
Once they were sacred
Search for forgiveness
Forgetting their weakness
I do belong

You're a dent in my strive for
Not feeling contempt
Towards the goals
We were raised to achieve
All my pride was spent
On making myself so numb
Not getting stuck
Under your thumb
Our poor judgement
Will forever be denied

Watch the power leave your chapped palms
It all comes together
Through influential tongues
We're latching onto a new phase
That will rob us of our glorious days

The hated see the light of day
And here comes the sane
They're aching
Once they were sacred
Search for forgiveness
Forgetting their weakness

That's why I'm dedicated to
How to cut things through
And I'm not one in a million
... I'm just forgetting
That I ever was here...

[Solo 1: Coudret]
[Solo 2: Andersson]

The hated see the light of day
And here comes the sane
They're aching
Once they were sacred
Search for forgiveness
Forgetting their weakness
I do belong
