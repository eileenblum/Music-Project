[Music: Strid/Andersson, lyrics: Strid]

All you presence makes me sick as dog
You parasite on a dream
That was worked for so long
You dragged a good soul down
And you buried his will in the mud...stay
Away...

Now she's a savior, a lie, a forced goodbye
Manipulation of the desperate kind... so

I'll give you something
That you can't ignore
A bait to go all the way
A place where your urge gets paid
All hail the parasite blues

She's a lingering creature
She will blow your mind
But when it comes to your end
Of this infected alliance
She won't give in

Feel the love from your savior
A deceiver of trust
All that you give
Will be returned
With your feelings crushed

I'll give you something
That you can't ignore
A bait to go all the way
A place where your urge gets paid
Your conscience all washed away
He gave you a world that serves
What you've done before
Now it is here again, my dear
You just killed a friend....
All hail the parasite blues

Just when you thought
It couldn't get much worse
She raised the bar to an all-time low
You worked so hard at covering it up
But now it's taking a new shape

[Solo: Andersson]

I'll give you something
That you can't ignore
A bait to go all the way
A place where your urge gets paid
Your conscience all washed away
He gave you a world that serves
What you've done before
Now it is here again, my dear
You just killed a friend
