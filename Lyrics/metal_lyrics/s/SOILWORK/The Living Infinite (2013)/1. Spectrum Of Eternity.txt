[music: Strid/Andersson, lyrics: Strid]

I feel Iâm done with this shell of mine
Separated from the one I knew
Iâll kill every minute on hold
While the ocean brings me back to life
Iâve lived, Iâve breathed, Iâve learned to be deceived
Sheltered for what itâs worth, forced to make it work
I feel Iâm chosen to see what others havenât seen
Itâs not a tragedy, itâs just reality but how it makes me believe

Now I see a spectrum of eternity - The remedy is yours
A thousand of demands, a never-ending glance of fateâ¦ Of fate
Iâm yoursâ¦ Iâm yours

Three years since I was reborn, a brutal insight
Never knew it could do so much to stir my soul up
Itâs been relentless, Iâve felt deprived of my own life
Stuck on the other side of who I was enlightened by

Embrace me, for one last time, take me there
Somethingâs out there and it wonât leave me astray

[SOLO: Andersson]

Embrace me, for one last time, take me thereâ¦
Somethingâs out there and it wonât leave me astray
A thousand of demands, a never-ending glance of fateâ¦ Of fate
Iâm yoursâ¦ Iâm yours
