[Music: Andersson; Lyrics: Strid]

Where's the notion
That I would be left out
I wish you'd take me away with you
I know I cursed you
I know I had no doubt
That all of you were the thorns of life

Misanthropic tendencies
I was the one who could never believe
You broke my trust, all was lost
You're all the same to me
I made peace with solitude
A farcical interlude
The wrath made me a lonely soul

The misanthrope lives on
Through the burning sun
A champion for the ages
The hatred lives on
The world goes numb
A provocateur of life

You won't affect me, I'm in control
When I take the role of the misanthrope

A well of emotion taking you back
I won't be shaped
Cause it never ever lasts
Leave me alone
Give me no words to keep
No familiarity
And I won't be deceived

Where's the notion
That I would be left out
I wish you'd take me away with you
I know I cursed you
I know I had no doubt

That all of you
Were the thorns of life

Misanthropic tendencies
I was the one who could never believe
You broke my trust, all was lost
You're all the same to me
I made peace with solitude
A farcical interlude
The wrath made me a lonely soul

The misanthrope lives on
Through the burning sun
A champion for the ages
The hatred lives on
The world goes numb
A provocateur of life

You won't affect me, I'm in control
When I take the role of the misanthrope

A well of emotion taking you back
I won't be shaped
Cause it never ever lasts
Leave me alone
Give me no words to keep
No familiarity
And I won't be deceived

[Solo 1: Coudret]
[Solo 2: Andersson]

A well of emotion taking you back
I won't be shaped
Cause it never ever lasts
Leave me alone
Give me no words to keep
No familiarity
And I won't be deceived
