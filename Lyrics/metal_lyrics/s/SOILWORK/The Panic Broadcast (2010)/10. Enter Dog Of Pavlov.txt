Here I am, the prodigal son
The self proclaimed deprived
Spending hours of fighting the peace
When I should lay it on the line
It makes it hard, I won't fall asleep
Until I'm one with the other side
Fighting shadows, imaginary scenes
Flashing through my mind

So...

[Chorus x2:]
Could I be on the rise
Reality or disguise
Constantly mesmerized
Ripped and torn
Hypnotized

Let me feel the urge to get that rush once more
I will beckon when the sound of venture calls

When will I learn to resist?

[Solo: Coudret]

I should have put it down
While it was in my hands
Like love that never dies
I'm preaching words
That could answer it all
As I'm bound to break the ties

I'm making progress again
The return of the blind
Feel the kick setting in
Don't ever choke it again...

Let me feel the urge to get that rush once more
I will beckon when the sound of venture calls

[Chorus x2]

I'm making progress again
The return of the blind
Feel the kick setting in
Don't ever choke it again!!!

I'm on the rise!
