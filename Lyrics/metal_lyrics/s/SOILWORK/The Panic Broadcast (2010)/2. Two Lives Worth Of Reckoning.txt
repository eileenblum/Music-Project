It's just the way it starts
The way it feels
Submissioned while trying to find the lead
One thing to another
The way it goes
The plans you were making are turning cold
One by one, they set your fall
So distinguished yet having to go through it all
Forged into something that wasn't meant...
To be in the shadow of make believe!

Round.. two...
You're trying to make me
Bound.. to...
The circle within me

[Chorus:]
I gave it away
And now I am so tired
There's nothing more left to fight
I'll be learning to change
(Two lives worth of reckoning)
It hurts to be blind
And how I've been fading lights
I've been crawling to pick my side
And it left me deranged
(From the reckoning)

It's just the way I need
To plant that seed
Won't settle for nothing
Won't settle with greed
All I'm asking for
Is to reach the point
Where I won't dwell
On resentful times

Round.. two...
You're trying to make me
Bound.. to...
The circle within me

Oh... Right!

[Chorus]

(When I see that graceful day)
The hours remain
From the scar to the threshold
(It will be the greatest slay)
The forced mind will turn
Won't stick or burn
(I'm holding on, it goes deep within)
Releasing the guilt
Please encourage my will
(It will be the sweetest release)
The struggle makes free
And the air.. I - WOULD - BREATHE!

[Solo: Coudret &amp; Wichers]

[Chorus]
