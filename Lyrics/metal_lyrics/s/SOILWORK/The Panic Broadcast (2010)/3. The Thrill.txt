Watch me now...

Gave in for the moment
A lifetime of thrills
Paid up to deserve it
Made up with my pills

Now will you ever learn
And make it all just turn

An ironic pattern
A foolish will
A sweet reputation
A passion to kill

Falling down again
And feel the core getting chilled

How it lies, a twisted device
Giving you up ten times
Stop the search and you will find

And dismantle the thrill

Hunting for closure
But the story goes on
A cancer that bleeds...
Won't leave till your done

Like streams of broken glass
Passing through your veins

Obsessed with obsession
Corroded from guilt
Such a drag of progression
The tears getting spilled

Now will you ever learn
And make it all just turn

How it lies, a twisted device
Giving you up ten times
Stop the search and you will find

How it lies, a twisted device
Filling you up to deny
Stop the search and you will find

I'm playing alone and will master
Talking to myself and will find out
How to retain ever after
The pain, the sound, the bottomless game
I was taught

[Solo: Wichers]

How it lies, a twisted device
Giving you up ten times
Stop the search and you will find

How it lies, a twisted device
Filling you up to deny
Stop the search and you will find

And dismantle the thrill...
