Where is it all?
Where am I?

Only present to bleed, only present to die
Only scratching the joy, yet filled with desire
I will be turning my head off...

I've made ways to forgive, I've made ways to forget
Ceasing the hours, made a friend I can reach
Can you hear how it's calling?
I'll make sure it's not falling

How long will I
Turn myself around this time
Can I revive?

And then it came
Blood rushing straight through the eyes of pain
Moving up, getting sane

It feels the same
But times takes a toll on this buried flame
Lift me up, say my name

I was longing to feel it, crying for sleep
Finding the essence, burned by the heat
Given the answer, given the cause
Suddenly seeing, it was lost when I called

I'm crashing down - nothing to keep
Without a sound - I wed the weak
When it turns out the enemy's loose
At the back of my mind it is twisting the truth

How long will I
Turn myself around this time
Can I revive?

And then it came
Blood rushing straight through the eyes of pain
Moving up, getting sane

It feels the same
But times takes a toll on this buried flame
Lift me up, say my name

[Solo: Wichers]

[Solo: Coudret]

The feeling surrounds me, bigger than pain
Awaken by loss, engaged to maintain
It might switch for all I know
I'll let it drown in the afterglow

And then it came
Blood rushing straight through the eyes of pain
Moving up, getting sane

It feels the same
But times takes a toll on this buried flame
Lift me up, say my name
