Choking on nothing
Hands turning cold
The deeper the mind goes
The deeper the hole

I'm reaching a point where
No one else goes
My fate seems to be split in half
Can't control it at all

Words turn to ashes
Comfort won't help
Pointless to reach out
I'm losing myself
All I know is I wish this could end
Get rid of this feeling and stop to pretend

[Chorus:]
(Let me...)
Try to understand as I've
(Failed to be...)
Someone I'm not
(It's so real...)
I've been fooled once again
I've been -
Forced to feel...

It's like I'm not present
It's like I'm not here
A voice calls with vengeance
I am lost with the fear

Searching for meaning, searching within
The lust that was broken, has vanished again
Feels like a set up with no one to trust
The pictures I'm seeing won't leave 'til they're loved

[Chorus]

And now I wonder what's become of me
Is it the truth that was found?
Whatever it is, I won't respect the sound -
Of giving things up

[Solo: Coudret]

(Choking on nothing)
(Hands turning cold)
The deeper the mind goes
The deeper the hole

I'm reaching a point where
No one else goes
My fate seems to be split in half
Can't control it at all

[Chorus]

So let me...
So let me...
So let me...
So let me!

Fuck it all...
