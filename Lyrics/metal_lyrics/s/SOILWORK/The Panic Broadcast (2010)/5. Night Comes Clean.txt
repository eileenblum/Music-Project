Let me tell you about a soul who loves disaster
The night comes clean and then he dreams of going faster
He deals with angels one on one and gets his hopes up
It runs so deep, it runs so deep...

Changes...
Won't you tell me why it's changing...
It breaks my heart each time
Changes...
Won't you tell me why it's changing...
It breaks my heart each time when it dies...

The desire we will fight
Is tearing through my veins
We're exploiting our fears
Bringing fire to tears, I am lost

He fights the anguish and he overcomes the madness
See angels fall and now the demons are his masters
With broken heart he turns away from all the sadness
It runs so deep, it runs so deep...

Changes...
Won't you tell me why it's changing...
It breaks my heart each time

Changes...
Won't you tell me why it's changing...
It breaks my heart each time...
When it dies...

The desire we will fight
It's burning in my veins
We're exploiting our fears
Bringing fire to tears, I am lost

Turn your back on me...
Does it have to be?

Turn your back on me, like the ones I've lost, opened up my insanity
Does it have to be, such an endless story that keeps on breaking me

I'm gonna reach out, I'm gonna take back what I once had
It's like I blacked out, no more deceit, no more regrets

[Solo: Coudret]

[Solo: Wichers]

Changes...
Won't you tell me why it's changing...
It breaks my heart each time

Changes...
Won't you tell me why it's changing...
It breaks my heart each time...
When it dies...

The desire we will fight
It's burning in my veins
We're exploiting our fears
Bringing fire to tears, I am lost
