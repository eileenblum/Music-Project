[deluxe edition bonus track]

I can feel how it's calling me
I can feel how it hurts
Like the words to a silent sleep
As the beating gets worse...

I face the fact as I roll the dice
Pretend to feel when my luck is burnt
Sick of fighting lad of provident lies
I hope the wind finally turn...

(Won't be...)
Selfishly?
(Won't share...)
The wanted time?
(Can I...)
Make my way?
(If I...)
Turn away?

I've learned to trust the fall
I've learned to see through all
When the peril is out of time
I'll be there at the end of the line

Sweet demise
Always out of time
Sweet demise
Through the threshold

For a deny
Always out of time
Sent to die
Born to defy

I don't care who is wrong or right
Cause I had my share
It doesn't matter if it's out of sight
When no one else seems to dare

[Solo]

Sick of fighting lad of provident lies
I hope the wind finally turn...

(Won't be...)
Selfishly?
(Won't share...)
The wanted time?
(Can I...)
Make my way?
(If I...)
Turn away?

I've learned to trust the fall
I've learned to see through all
When the peril is out of time
I'll be there at the end of the line

Sweet demise
Always out of time
Sweet demise
Through the threshold

For a deny
Always out of time
Sent to die
Born to defy
