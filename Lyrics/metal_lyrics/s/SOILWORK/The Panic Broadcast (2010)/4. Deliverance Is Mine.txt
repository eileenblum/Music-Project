From the darkest river, comes the darkest heart
Never to be one with all I know

So bitter to the core, won't you fix your grudging soul
Forgiving, yet unable to see what you have done

Embraced by the treasury...
The mind's in captivity...
I'm not your enemy...
Forced mind activity...

Now is it so damn hard
Don't tell me what I don't deserve
Coating the words, crushing the urge
To be able to feel something more

Now where do we go...

Deliverance is mine
Me, myself and the hands of time
Deliverance is mine
And you're way out of line

Deliverance is mine
Me, myself and the hands of time
Deliverance is mine...

Now let me run my own fucking show...

Make up with your spitefulness
Drain yourself from all the guilt
Become all of what you preach
Before you spill all your guts

Embraced by the treasury...
The mind's in captivity...
I'm not your enemy...
Transporting all the guilt
Forced mind activity...
Ignoring what was built

Now where do we go...

Deliverance is mine
Me, myself and the hands of time
Deliverance is mine
And you're way out of line

Deliverance is mine
Me, myself and the hands of time
Deliverance is mine...

Time to live through yourself
Time to kill that golden parasite
Respect your own self
Stop intoxicating your beliefs

[Solo: Coudret]

Now where do we go...

Deliverance is mine
Me, myself and the hands of time
Deliverance is mine
And you're way out of line

Deliverance is mine
Me, myself and the hands of time
Deliverance is mine...

Live through yourself...
