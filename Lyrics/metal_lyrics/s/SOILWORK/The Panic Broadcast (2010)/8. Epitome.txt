Lost, it's been a long time
For this moment to come
Lost, it's been a long line
Where I've been waiting too long

All those words and the consequences
Won't you please shed some light
All the fear and all that joy
Guide my way as I turn in desire

How it hurts when I give up
The way that it ends
Twist and turn till it erupts
The way it commands...

Lost, it's been a long fight
And it kept holding on
Lost, it's been a long sigh
It has been clearing my mind

All those years being overloaded
All the strength I put in
Let me share what I've done to myself
I've been losing to win

How it hurts when I give up
The way that it ends
Twist and turn till it erupts
The way it commands...

How it hurts when I give up...
You don't understand
Twist and turn, the way it looks into my eyes again

[Solo: Coudret]

How it hurts when I give up
The way that it ends
Twist and turn till it erupts
The way it commands...

How it hurts when I give up
You don't understand
Twist and turn, the way it looks
The way it commands...
