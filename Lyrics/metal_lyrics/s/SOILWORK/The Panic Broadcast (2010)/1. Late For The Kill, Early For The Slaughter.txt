Consider me dead if that's what you want
Gather around me, the day has come...

Straight through the threshold, the morning calls
Wasn't meant to be there, when I opened the door
You saw me begging, you saw me down on my knees
I felt defenseless, and you don't know how it feels

I have made up my mind every time
It's been dragged in the dirt
Every scar wears a thought
Leaving battles that I've loved

It's been hard, it's been fiercely infected
It's been dropped, it's been suddenly present
Cutting ways that I've walked
Earning miles through it all

I was late for the kill, but early for the slaughter
I don't care how it bleeds
I was late for the kill but stopped in to drag the waters
Turn the bitter to sleep

I do believe there's something more
Though my vision's blurred
Straight out of nowhere, with the lack of words
I've been given the time, I've been given the faith
Don't try to stop me, don't you lie to my face

I have made up my mind every time
It's been turned to prevail
Every word feeds the crown
To dictate the profound

It's been hard, it's been fiercely infected
It's been dropped, it's been suddenly present
Cutting ways that I've walked
Earning miles through it all...

Through it all...

I was late for the kill, but early for the slaughter
I don't care how it bleeds
I was late for the kill but stopped in to drag the waters
Turn the bitter to sleep

Just hear me out on this one
Cause I ain't got nothing to hide
I will wipe out this mess
And return to life

[Solo: Coudret]

Consider me dead if that's what you want
Gather around me, the day is done...

Late for the kill...
Early for the slaughter...
Late for the kill...
Stopped in to drag the waters...
