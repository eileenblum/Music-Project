Like a flash from a distance I learned to prevail
Over all those dark moments, I set the sails
I learned to believe it, I learned to deny
Which was nothing but running away from the tide

This life has been shattered next to something better
This life has made up with its soul
Next time I will deal with the storm that gathered
All the thoughts that came up on their own

Can someone give me an answer
About the choices I've made?
Cause I can't think anymore
These thoughts are buried forever
Deep down in emotional graves
Forever lost in vain

Turning points are glowing with their absence since there's
No hope of finding my way
What may lurk in the shadows while I'm in here waiting?
Something better than I've already seen?

Can someone give me an answer
About the choices I've made?
Cause I can't think anymore
These thoughts are buried forever
Deep down in emotional graves
Forever lost in vain

So do I truly deserve something better?
(Way better than this)
This weight on my shoulders still matters
(Matters to me)
After all these years through the never
I can feel how it all comes together

[Solo: Andersson]

Can someone give me an answer
About the choices I've made?
Cause I can't think anymore
These thoughts are buried forever
Deep down in emotional graves
Forever lost in vain
