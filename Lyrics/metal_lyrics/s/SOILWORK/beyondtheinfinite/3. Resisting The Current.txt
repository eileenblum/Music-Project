Did you come to witness my downfall?
Did you come to see my demise?

Back to where the mothership landed
Back to where the panic arose
Back to all that I once transcended
Back to where the innocence glows

And that door is always open
And that path will always drag me down
Beneath the waves- watch me slip away

All I need is a new heart beating
And I'm ready to die again
All I need is to hear your breathing
And I'm ready to follow you down
All the way
Right to the very end
As I die again

I have tried resisting the current
Dug my feet deep down in the dirt
I have tried to live with the silence
But it cuts much deeper than words

I have tried to find a way to
Make your name unspoken
I have tried to reach the surface
Just before the tide

And that door is always open
And that path will always drag me down
Beneath the waves- watch me slip away

All I need is a new heart beating
And I'm ready to die again
All I need is to hear your breathing
And I'm ready to follow you down
All the way
Right to the very...

All I need is a new heart beating
And I'm ready to die again
All I need is to hear your breathing
And I'm ready to follow you down

All I need is a new heart beating
And I'm ready to die again
All I need is to hear your breathing
And I'm ready to follow you down
All the way
Right to the very...
