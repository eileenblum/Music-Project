A fragile existence
Is saving my day
Transcend into dark

A spin of wheel
Headlong to feel
As my body still heals

A sin for a sin
Truth lies deep within
A veil is lifted from my eyes

When sound collides
A kiss will erase your filthy lies
When sound collides
A barrier of a million eyes

Unreal Reflections
Painting my night
Reclaiming the day
A cup to the king
Filled up to the brim

As the freezing cold sets in

A sin for a sin
Truth lies deep within
A veil is lifted from my eyes

When sound collides
A kiss will erase your filthy lies
When sound collides
A barrier of a million eyes

A sin for a sin
Truth lies deep within
A veil is lifted from my eyes

When sound collides
A kiss will erase your filthy lies
When sound collides
A barrier of a million eyes
