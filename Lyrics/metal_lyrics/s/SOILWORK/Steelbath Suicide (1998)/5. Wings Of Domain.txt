I'm bleeding
bleeding inside
for love is no longer
a part of my life
I'm screaming
screaming for faith
my faith has flown out into
shining lights.

[Chorus:]
Where am I now?
what have I gained?
trying to find
the wings of domain
Where is the love?
I'm dwelling in pain
hiding beneath
wings of domain!

Me alone
against the world
the void of emptiness
is piercing my soul
a virus
infects mankind
an infection incurable
for all of eternity

[Chorus:]
Where am I now?
what have I gained?
trying to find
the wings of domain
Where is the love?
I'm dwelling in pain
hiding beneath
wings of domain!
Where am I now?
what have I gained?
trying to find
the wings of domain
