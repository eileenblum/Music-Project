Absorbed in life's eternal wheel
feel the energy flow within
energy in which you most certainly need
no one can bring you down!
a chance to be spinning in dreams
exists in your inner fantasy!

[Chorus:]
I wanna search beyong
I wanna search for inner peace
I wanna dig a hold deep down
to find my inner need!

Welcome to a bright engage
face the light of inner rage
energy in which you most certainly need
no one can bring you down!
inhale a breeze of passion
and sink deep into the well of life

[Chorus:]
I wanna search beyong
I wanna search for inner peace
I wanna dig a hold deep down
to find my inner need!

Energy in which you most certainly need
no one can bring you down!

Absorbed in life's eternal wheel
feel the energy flow within

Energy............
No one...........
