[a dedication to the metalgods of the 80's]

In the night when you feel those electric desires
neverending noise from chains
and the world is on fire!
right!

[Chorus:]
Steelbath suicide
enter the other side
steelbath suicide
on wheels of steel we'll ride

Sleeping tight as the lead is pounding in the air
leave this world only metal is fair!
right!

[Chorus(2x):]
Steelbath suicide
enter the other side
steelbath suicide
on wheels of steel we'll ride
