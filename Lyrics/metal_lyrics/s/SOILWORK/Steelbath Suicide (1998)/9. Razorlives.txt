In the jar born to die
feeling sick couse my life's gone to far
blood will rain, so indane
liers will get burned
onjection overruled
life's a mirror who won't get fooled
a story of another kind
always so hard to find

[Chorus:]
Razorlives!
liers will get burned
Razorlives!
history will turn
Razorlives!
liers will get burned
Razorlives!
history will turn

Meaning out of sight
can life be so pure, so bright?
terror in your soul
speaking to a wall who's already been told
if life is life and eath is death
why do I feel my destiny's breath
seeing through different eyes
cause we're all devils in disguise!

[Chorus(2x):]
Razorlives!
liers will get burned
Razorlives!
history will turn
Razorlives!
liers will get burned
Razorlives!
history will turn
