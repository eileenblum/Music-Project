Taken by suprise
in an early starshined night
with my thoughts I blur
into their minds of knowledge

I glanze updon the obscure date
well, I see a million of lights
flashing inside the weakminded soul
so intelligent
I see the gift to my inner dreams
ascript to solve the HIV exposed

[Chorus:]
Then they flew
so fast into the other world
then they flew.....so fast into

Taken by suprise
in an early starshined night
with my thoughts I blur
into their minds of knowledge
into their minds of knowledge

I glanze updon the obscure date
well, I see a million of lights
I glanze updon the obscure date
well, I see a million of lights

I glanze updon the obscure date
