A stinking aroma
spreads into my sense of smell
a smell of ageing filth
from the body you wear
you will soon become
shattered into fragments
fragments dissolving
fragments to be deframed [repeat]
.......again.........

[Instrumental Chorus]

You're a prisoner
in your filthy mind
hanging tied upside down
couse you're walking the Aardvark trail
..............for evermore...........

[Instrumental Chorus]

I give you hell!
I give you hell!

Walking with blinded eyes
feeling the temperature rise
pleased to be a swine
as the devil rips your spine
..........away...........

[Instrumental Chorus]

I give you hell!
I give you hell!
