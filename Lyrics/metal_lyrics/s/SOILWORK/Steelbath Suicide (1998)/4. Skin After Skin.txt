I count them all this must be number ten
Am I right is it over again?
My body shivers and shivers again
I nail their faces to the wall
Oh...those sweet pictures
Do you realize what youave done?
Pictures cause thatas what you are
There is no truth in what you say!
Scars! cause that's what you create
There is no love left!
There is no truth in what you say!

Feel a part of me that is dead! [x2]

[Chorus (2x):]
Skin after skin
Sin after sin
Loose or win
Skin after skin
Sin after sin
My brain oh drowned in sin
