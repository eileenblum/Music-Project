We're the ones who'd never betray you
We're the ones that would always stand back
We never made a sound, never left a trace
Now the pace keeps changing but we're still here
The whirl of pain and the unlimited fear
We're already thought things over
All in pain

Save those words tonight
We don't care what you're thinking
'Cause they were never meant to forge
how selfless of you to finally grant our presence
Don't you leave us 'til we bleed

After all I ever did, it's washed away
Don't let it be me now
It's like I never even tried to remain sane
But it all turns out just not what
you wanted
Now what you asked for
Now start dragging me around

As the world breaks down
We'll explore without a sound
Lost together in this whirl of pain
Bow your head down low
When this world is overthrown
We'll unite where nothing else remains
In this whirl of pain

Let us all rejoice before you throw us all
To that howling wolf of yours
Making room for a storm
In the well of unanswered prayers

Same sound, different voices

[Solo: Andersson]

As the world breaks down
We'll explode without a sound
Lost together in this whirl of pain
Bow your head down low
When this world is overthrown
We'll unite where nothing else remains
In this whirl of pain

Same sound, different voices
