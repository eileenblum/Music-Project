[music and lyrics: Strid]

So I say you're miles away
The bleeding heart takes another turn
You gave me life, you took my side
While time stood still we were trying to learn

My world divided
I sense the great unknown
It's becoming my closest friend
Perhaps you'll see me no more

Constantly in motion though the curtains
are drawn
You make it seem so easy
It's tearing my throbbing heart apart
I always think of leaving

Where do we go now?
I thought you knew I just planted a seed
A picture of someone I used to know
Just shed a tear

The lights that I see from a distance
Became a shadow of what I believed
Won't you give me the well-earned
deliverance
The rest I can hardly perceive

Here's one who will always be gone

Away from the pain
I have given more than I got, won't change
All anger delayed after days in the shade
I'm stuck with a deathless turn

So they say that bridge will crumble
All the fear that may breed ghosts and thunder
Still wants you here
Your permission to yearn

My weakness is loyal, it speaks to me
Out of courtesy when there is no more
to preach
The rhyme of ancient entities has paved
my way

My fate in the hands of others
My fate in the hands of time
The urge that no one can cover
Up while I'm one with the night

Where do we go now?
I thought you knew I just planted a seed
A picture of someone I used to know
Just shed a tear

Tear, all the pain I've known
The same bloodstained fields we've sown
The rain keeps on falling
I've made the choice of crawling

Away from the pain
I have given more than I got, won't change
All anger delayed after days in the shade
I'm stuck with a deathless turn

Should've known better
Now I've buried it all
'Cause it won't change
All anger delayed after days in the shade
I'm stuck with a deathless turn

[Solo: Andersson]

Here's one who will always be gone

Away from the pain
I have given more than I got, won't change
All anger delayed after days in the shade
I'm stuck with a deathless turn

Should've known better
Now I've buried it all
'Cause it won't change
All anger delayed after days in the shade
I'm stuck with a deathless turn
