Your imagination
Will set the world on fire
Silenced by shining lights
A satisfying delight

A resolution never seen before
Reality won't be a friend no more
'Cause the further it goes, the less you will grasp
In this dying world of yours

It won't ever let you go
It won't ever let you grow

The infiltration of the empire meant for you

...Just ruined your chances too soon
You're one with the frame that will get you through
The tension, the drug, the helpless mind
The love of a mother redirected

Now I feel for you
The way you're sinking
Deeper and deeper
Beyond recognition

'Cause the source is never ending
No use, stop pretending
We won't ever find your way
Since the source is still defending
Our crown of reality sending
Nothing more than what's been said

Our lives going nowhere
Constantly bleeding somewhere
Life's going nowhere

[Solo: Courbet]

'Cause the source is never ending
No use, stop pretending
We won't ever find your way
Since the source is still defending
Our crown of reality sending
Nothing more than what's been said

Your imagination, the infiltration
