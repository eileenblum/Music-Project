On wards I tremble, on wards I crawl
My reason profound, the pain above all
Secluded from motion, detained to rot
Emerging from sacrifice
Giving all that I've got

The strive of reaching higher
And hold on to what eventually falls
Is making sure that the spirit will crumble
Once the bloodstained curtains are dropped

Violation of what I've kept inside
A nation of remedies all mine

All along echoing paths
The lights are gone
Strength in numbers
Will burn us all

The weight that's been covering our backs
Is now replaced
A place where our hearts will turn black
That's where we'll stay

Segregation of souls beneath the norms
Revelations and the oncoming storm
Abandoning pressure, abandoning reasons
Overcoming burden that drove us through loss

Outcasts of heaven, beggars in black
Escaping the kingdoms of perpetual wrath
Needless to say I'm through with you
My fallen angel, my fallen star

The strive of reaching higher
And hold on to what eventually falls
Is making sure that the spirit will crumble
Once the bloodstained curtains are dropped

All along echoing paths
The lights are gone
Strength in numbers
Will burn us all

The weight that's been covering our backs
Is now replaced
A place where our hearts will turn black
That's where we'll stay

[Solo: Andersson]

All along echoing paths
The lights are gone
Strength in numbers
Will burn us all

My creation, forever lost to wrath
