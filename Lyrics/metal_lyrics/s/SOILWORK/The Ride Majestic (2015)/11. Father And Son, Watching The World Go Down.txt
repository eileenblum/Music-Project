[feat. Nathan James Biggs of Sonic Syndicate]All that comfort lost in seconds
Into burning fields of the unknown
I saw the fear, I felt the rumble
Our eyes exploding, our memories lost forevermore

We're going down

I thought we never could be wiped out
Lost and dragged in shame
To be one with what's been made up
It all ends here, but where do we go?
Do we ever get o find out
Where our hearts will lie?
Transcending filled with pain
Our souls without a name

Into the night as our hands are entwined
Never let me go
We owned our time but here we drown
In tears we've collected
Slowly we rose for a glance at the skip
Never let go
Father and son, watching the world go down

Our reality is lost in motion
Never coming back
Your lips are moving but there's no sound
Watching the last light die
Sensing our last sigh
Together as we have lost our last fight

I thought we never could be wiped out
Lost and dragged in same

To be one with what's been made up
It all ends here, but where do we go?
Do we ever get to find out
Where our hearts will lie?
We all knew it all the way
The growing shadow that brought this day

Let it come, there's no fear
All at once, we're already numb

Into the night as our hands are entwined
Never let me go
We owned our time but here we drown
In tears we've collected
Slowly we rose for a glance at the skip
Never let go
Father and son, watching the world go down

Go down...

Riding the wave of nothingness
Our ambitions slowly ripped apart
But we still stand

[Solo: Andersson]

Into the night as our hands are entwined
Never let me go
We owned our time but here we drown
In tears we've collected
Slowly we rose for a glance at the skip
Never let go
Father and son, watching the world go down
