Embracing the silence as served
You know how the next thought will turn
No matter the guilt you've let in
The crown of resemblance will win

'Cause you see the connection, you
feel the pain
Synopsis: you can't help getting maimed
Whether it's you, whether it's me
It's all still inside the shell

Now it's gone and all that's left
Is the path I once repressed
She is closer now than death
Aspire Angelic
But the Ride is Majestic

Recalling the hours you've dwelled
From everything to nothing,
Make sure from the first glance of light
You steer into venomous lies

'Cause you see the connection, you
feel the pain
Synopsis: you can't help getting maimed
Whether it's you, whether it's me
It's all still inside the shell

The rain whips me conscience
The strain towards the end
The rain keeps on falling
The sound got me settled with sadness
I know it too well now
The stranger in me turns to ashes

[Solo: Courbet]
[Solo: Karlsson / Andersson]

Now it's gone and all that's left

Aspire Angelic
But the Ride is Majestic
