[feat. Pascal Poulsen of Odium]I live to awake you
You son of time
As soon as I see you
You draw the lines
Through chambers of delusions
Your nurturing shadow
You give me closure and shelter in fire

A keeper of our needs
To wallow in secrets
You hold no dignities
And redeem the speechless

Prey on my mind
Tell me I'm here
To rejoice in in my misery
Take my side, let me find
The abyss that I've faithfully designed

The world is a snake and thou tongue is vile
It swallows your guilt, but then you die
I'd rather speak with the phantom inside

I dream of dominions I once used to roam in need
...Now ruptured and sunken
The surface still bleeding but I'll just
pretend that I have seen
...A world beyond
The night is still cold and I'm still deceived
But in the phantom I believe

I live to awake you
You son of time
As soon as I see you
You draw the lines

[Solo: Andersson]

I dream of dominions I once used to roam in need
...Now ruptured and sunken
The surface still bleeding but I'll just
pretend that I have seen
...A world beyond
The night is still cold and I'm still deceived
But in the phantom I believe
