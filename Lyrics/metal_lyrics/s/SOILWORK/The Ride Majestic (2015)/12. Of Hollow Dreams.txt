[music: Strid, lyrics: Miguel Holmberg]

Shattered by the sudden and horrible loss
Only in my sleep can I contain the grief
Until the moment I wake up
To the nightmare of reality

Trying to find relief in these painful times
â¦Of hollow dreams
Hoping the time will heal
It's so surreal, the way I feel

Emptiness, a crucial part of me
Forever gone
Sorrow cannot seem to let me go

Condemned to pain
But somehow you keep me sane
Nothing can replace you in my life
Even though you're never, ever coming back

The thought of a future without you
Keeps on haunting my fragile mind

It wasn't meant to end so soon
Where did you go?
Now I'm hoping that time will heal
To see you leaving was so surreal

Release me from this prison of the mind
Time is rushing forward, but I'm
standing in line
Thankful that you probably left us unaware
Liberated from the sorrow

Trying to find relief in these painful times
â¦Of hollow dreams
Hoping the time will heal
It's so surreal, the way I feel

Emptiness, a crucial part of me
Forever gone
Sorrow cannot seem to let me go

Condemned to pain
But somehow you keep me sane
Nothing can replace you in my life
Even though you're never, ever coming back

[Solo: Coudret]

Sorrow cannot seem to let me go

Condemned to pain you still remain
Nothing can replace you in my life
Even though you're never, ever coming back
