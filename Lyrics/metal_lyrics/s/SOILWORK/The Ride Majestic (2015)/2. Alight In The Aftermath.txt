Then they came in shapes dreams
Visions wrapped in smoke and steam
Spoke to me in twisted tongues
Words that burned inside my lungs

They they came to bring the end
Infiltrate and then transcend
Whispers from the dawn of time
Spiritual but not divine

Where is the meaning to all that's left behind
If I walk down that path?
From the beginning, we kept our souls entwined
Alight in the aftermath

Then they came like rand and wind
Flesh can't hold the truth within
There's no guilt, no one to blame
Spirits travel without names

And if that flame enlightens me
Will it relieve me of my needs?
To come alive, free from existence
Escape the emptiness where I was born

[Solo: Courbet]

They come as travelers through astral planes,
diverting time
The great unrevelers of all that's hidden in your mind

I lift my gaze into the fire beyond
This wondrous phase, it will not last for long
Embrace this dawn like I once held you
You'll know before my time is due

Then they came at no small cost
They alone knew what I'd lost
After birth communiquÃ©

Where is the meaning to all that's left behind
If I walk down that path?
From the beginning, we kept our souls entwined
Alight in the aftermath
