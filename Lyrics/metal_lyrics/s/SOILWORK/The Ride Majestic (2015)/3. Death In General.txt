You went out of reach as quick as the setting sun
Nowhere else you could have gone
Still geraniums whispered your name that night
There was no one there who'd give you up

We all see changes, but how the cut runs deep
A shadow approaching
Your pain is common, it's like lament on repeat

How about driving souls apart
Like death in general
It's bound to shatter what you know
'Cause pain is nothing
Recalling the way we used to dance
Through gutters all built in distress
I still mourn

The bars turned to strangers as soon as your light moved on
Infinity burned my fingers, one last look and then you're gone
The world crashing down on the innocent
The sky opening up for the truth
You were carried with honor and fiery eyes
Into unknown dominions where hearts reunite
Sail on... My flash in the night

How about driving souls apart
Like death in general
It's bound to shatter what you know
'Cause pain is nothing
Recalling the way we used to dance
Through gutters all built in distress
I still mourn

The wind, the touch
The zenith, the iris
The never let go...

We all see changes, but how the cut runs deep
A shadow approaching
Your pain is common, it's like lament on repeat

How about driving souls apart
Like death in general
It's bound to shatter what you know
'Cause pain is nothing
Recalling the way we used to dance
Recalling the last dance, my friend, my friend.
