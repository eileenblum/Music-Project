Total oblivion of my inner past.
Will I ever be the same again
Landscapes of treasures before my eyes
Now it's over forget the past

Spirits...of the...future sun
Spirits of the future sun!

Legal lies and desperate cries I cannot see
I'm on my own self destructive and the anguish of youth
Future's rising in your mind!

Spirits...of the...future sun
Spirits of the future sun!

Your spirits wait for me in vain! I won't fall!

Sun burns red on the innocent child
Twisted rules by in common souls computerized
Pathetic lies the lights are out... Here comes the war!

Spirits...of the...future sun
Spirits of the future sun!

Your spirits wait for me in vain! I won't fall! [2x]

Total oblivion of my inner past.
Will I ever be the same again
Landscapes of treasures before my eyes
Now it's over forget the past

Spirits...of the...future sun
Spirits of the future sun!
