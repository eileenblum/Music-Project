Like the cold sweat running down your backs
I'll be there to make your lives a living hell
I'm your eyes in disguise... Silverspoon meltdown!

Break me! Kill me! I'm standing in your way
Condemn me! Punish me! I am your poison wine

Inside your temples of fortune and lies
You obey your power and might. I'm your headaches
I'm your agonies... Giant walls of steel!
You can't repair all the work you have done
Lies burning bright in your mind
I will never go down no needs to be found...
I am your hell!

Break me! Kill me! I penetrate your pride
Condemn me! Punish me! You can't break down my walls

I am the one the evil son.
I am the one with the darkened sun
Possessing the angels!

Feel the smell of crimson sweet sin
Your lies are weak and much to thin
I'll never die and I'll tell you why...
My jealousy is killed!

Break me! Kill me! I'm standing in your way!
Condemn me! Punish me! I am your poison wine.

I am the one the evil son!
I am the one with the darkened sun!
And your time has just begun to wane!

[Solo]

I am the one the evil son!
I am the one with the darkened sun!
And your time has just begun to wane!
Possessing the angels!â
