Inside you, I feel you from inside,
Satisfaction built on sin
Condemn everything who says what is wrong
Drown in my eyes, no need to deny I scream!
Feel my devil inside you, gaining!
Reaching diabolic speed!

I reach, I feel you're lost
Millions of flames in your eyes

I command the gods of time
Make this dream never end
Imagination?
Evil salvation?
Red light's city makes you burn
Oceans of immortal speed
I'm the hand sweeping over midnight's land

I reach, I feel you're lost
Millions of flames in your eyes

...So sell your soul and be mine!

I decide if you will rise
Total control! I'm in your veins
I reach, I grip your mind
Never surrender
