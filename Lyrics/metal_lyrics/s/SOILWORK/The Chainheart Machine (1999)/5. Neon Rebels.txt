Staring through the eyes of a cosmic breed
Through distant skies above the fields
Another face another dimension.
A broken circle of human attention
Around making my way through the desert plains
I'm a legend a gift from the gods,
Sirens scream there is no rest
A diary of a tragical life in this nest

Screaming for victory...
Neon rebels will rise
Breaking down the barricades...
Nailed to the skies

Riding on the winds at the speed of light
Selfish pride is a rebel's might.
Cosmic warfare a taste of my life
A gallery of a lifetime under the knife.
An endless voyage in an endless time,
Reminding thoughts of an ancient sign
Staring through the eyes of a cosmic breed
Through distant skies above the fields
Destructive thoughts in a narrow void,
Another mission in galaxy 2001

Screaming for victory...
Neon rebels will rise
Breaking down the barricades...
Nailed to the skies

Killing to stay alive
Madness rules here again
Tear away the golden skies
Neon rebels will reign!
