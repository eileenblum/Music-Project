Trying to hold back the jaws of mankind
Trying to avoid their hysteric lives
Where I walk or where I stand underground or no man's land
My eyes will always see what they've always seen
My ears will always hear what they've always heard

'Cause I'm back in room no. 99!
I could stay there for a lifetime!
'Cause I'm back in room no. 99!
(To my friends..)
When universe is on my side!

Can't pay the price of a madly game
I'm a victim who will stay the same
Where I talk or where I go.
Something tells me that it hurts me so
Hungry rebels cut my way
They steal and others have to pay
Spit or swallow that's a fact.
I'm going back going back!

'Cause I'm back in room no. 99!
You can be blind there for a lifetime!
'Cause I'm back in room no. 99!
(To my friends..)
When universe is on your side!

No! No! No!
My eyes will never see what they've used to see!
My ears will never hear what they've used to hear!

'Cause I'm back in room no. 99!
I could stay there for a lifetime!
'Cause I'm back in room no. 99!
(To my friends..)
When universe is on my side!
