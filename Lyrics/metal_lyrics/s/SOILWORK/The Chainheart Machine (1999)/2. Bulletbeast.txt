Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the mightiest of them all
Every little question, none who will be answered
Staring at the bullet beast pointing his gun

Killing
There's nothing in my seeing what's wrong
Running
Or is it just that I'm fearing
In fears for your lives you scream like a pig
Thrilling
My pulse will go up and yours will go down!

Why, why
I'm in for the quest
There's no turning back once you've tried
Why, why,
You're all laid to rest
The bullet is sent by the king

Once again I'll tell you, my friend
Don't trust anything you'll see
"Redrum" overdose
Telling no lies
My trigger finger is divine

Hatelights
Aim at the chest fire at will
Lesson
A lesson in pain, waiting for vengeance
Chasing my footsteps not to be found
Instruction
Instructor unknown, but he will proceed!

Why, why
But you won't resist
I'm back once again I will kill
Why, why,
I'm put to the test
I'll never go down to the ground!

So you wanna play rough?
Say "Hello" to my little friend
With my finger on the trigger
You're watching the judge of today

Killing
There's nothing in my seeing what's wrong
Running
Or is it just that I'm fearing
In fears for your lives you scream like a pig
Thrilling
My pulse will go up and yours will go down!

Why, why
I'm in for the quest
There's no turning back once you've tried
Why, why,
You're all laid to rest
The bullet is sent by the king

Last time, last sign
My face have turned to dust
Underground, no sound
Of human innocence

Hatelights
Aim at the chest fire at will
Lesson
A lesson in pain, waiting for vengeance
Chasing my footsteps not to be found
Instruction
Instructor unknown, but he will proceed!

Why, why
But you won't resist
I'm back once again I will kill
Why, why,
I'm put to the test I'll never go down to the ground!
