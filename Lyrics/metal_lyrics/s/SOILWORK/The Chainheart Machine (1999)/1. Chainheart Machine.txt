I am the sledgehammer messiah!
Waiting for sins to be born!
And if you stop for a moment,
You can hear the machines are playing your song!
There's nowhere to run and nowhere to speak,
I'm gaining, you're falling into me!
Tell me you piece of shit, how does it feel?
To be down here with me?
Living, living, dreaming, dreaming.
Drowning!

Chainheart machine!
By cosmic retribution I've been sent!
'Cause I'll rise, I'll rise!
You'll fall, you'll fall.
Roll the dice! Roll the dice!
My call, my call!

Tick tock, time to die!
No use reaching as time goes by.
Self absorbed egotistical... fuck!
I'm reigning your life!

Chainheart machine!
By cosmic retribution I've been sent!
'Cause I'll rise, I'll rise!
You'll fall, you'll fall.
Roll the dice! Roll the dice!
My call, my call!

Preaching for the sun!
They say there, they say there is a sun!
So I'm preaching, I'm preaching for the sun!
They say there, they say there... is a sun!

[Solo]

My body is chained to the ground!
Where I walk they stalk...
They hunt my every thought with,
Execution, evolution, disillusion, pre-conclusion!
Why is it me?

Chainheart machine!
Your suffering will be legendary, even in hell!
'Cause I'll rise, I'll rise!
You'll fall, you'll fall.
Roll the dice! Roll the dice!
My call, my call!
