I play the game of piercing fear.
Is this the only sound I'll ever hear?
Of hate I'll rise of this perennial demise!
Well if I ever should fall from this earth.
Would there be anything left of me?

Come feel the need of piercing steel penetrating your hope!
We suffer, yes we suffer in this pit of hell
The pulsating hatelights who will deform?
Total devastation just catches your eye!
Take a trip inside of me! There's all I need!
Of hate I'll rise of this perennial demise!
'Cause we've cried bloodstained walls on every fucking side!

Come feel the need of piercing steel penetrating your hope!

Kill kill machinegun majesty!
Just steal steal come steal my night

The nights are long as well as the war
They pull my strings whenever they want a feelings just reach us
A feeling of insecurity of strength I'll rise of this miserable disguise

Come feel the need of piercing steel penetrating your hope!

Kill kill machinegun majesty!
Just steal steal come steal my night

I play the game of piercing fear.
Is this the only sound I'll ever hear?
Of hate I'll rise of this perennial demise!

Kill kill machine gun majesty
Just spill spill come spill our blood
Kill kill machinegun majesty
Just steal steal forever stealing my life!
