Maximize my pleasure maximize my pain
'Til I've been heaven-sent in this downward spiral with no end
Angel face filled with sin I will lick it clean. Fixate my eyes to the TV screen

Treasurize this entertainment now!
By public demand we work for pleasure.

Mesmerize my god mesmerize my blood
From his mind to his spine we will make him doubt about his might!

Treasurize this entertainment now!
This is where we stand until we fall

Brutalize my lifetime brutalize my thoughts
In a trance, last dance for Mr. Moralize

Treasurize this entertainment now!
By public demand we work for pleasure.

Operation seedspill

On this open road of no regrets
Born on a plate, food for velvet lies

[Solo]

Maximize my pleasure maximize my pain
'Til I've been heaven-sent in this downward spiral with no end
Angel face filled with sin I will lick it clean.
Fixate my eyes to the TV screen

Sterilize this moment of truth that we stand for!
This is where we stand until we fall!
Treasurize this entertainment now!
This is where we stand until we fall!
