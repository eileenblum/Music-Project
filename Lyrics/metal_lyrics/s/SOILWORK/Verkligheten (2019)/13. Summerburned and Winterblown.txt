Could you live with the silence?
Could you live with the truth?
All the things that we wanted
Disappeared with our youth
Could you live with the promise
Of an imminent death?
When your daydreams are haunted
By your last dying breath
Somehow we end up
Summerburned and winterblown
Somehow we end up
Losing everything we've known
Even though you split my armour open wide
Do you really want to see what dwells inside?
Could you handle the sweetness?
Could you live with the pain?
To bring all that we wanted
To the surface again
Would you care for the outside
Or just make this our own?
It's a level of nearness
That they'll never have known
Somehow we end up
Summerburned and winterblown
Somehow we end up
Losing everything we've known
Even though you split my armour open wide
I would never dare to dream of all I wanted
All that I needed
All that was always you
I would never dare to dream of all I wanted
All that I needed
All that was always you
Somehow we end up
Summerburned and winterblown
Somehow we end up
Losing everything we've known
Even though you split my armour open wide
Do you really want to see what dwells inside?
Could you live with the silence?
Could you live with the truth?
All the things that we wanted
Disappeared with our youth
