[Instrumental]Verkligheten, the Swedish word for Reality. The entity we're all escaping from.

Verkligheten is the dark matter surrounding your personal space,
Verkligheten are the neighbouring dimensions that you thought could never affect your reality.

Verkligheten is the monster under your bed, the skeleton in your closet that still is alive after all these years.

Making his bones stripped of sinew, cartilage and muscle to move in synchronicity just to remind you that nothing is what it seems.

Verkligheten is a reminder, a omen, a futile firework shot into the stratosphere to perhaps reflect its outburst on a tiny piece of the earth.
