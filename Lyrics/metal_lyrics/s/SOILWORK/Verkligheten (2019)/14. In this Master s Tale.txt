I live with the last of the silence
I gave away all my hope
I managed to turn my laughter
Into a wall made of stone
I left on a foggy morning
I reached my goal at night
Fired burning and hollow eyes
We have all made our silent goodbyes
In this heartless, meaningless shelter
Below the fields of our spirited past
Cold as ice and with wings of disaster
Well make sure that this moment will last
We all knew it was a calling
And we thought we'd escaped the rain
Growing closer to our dark fate
In this master's tale
Water's rising as we desperately
Reach out for the sun
Deal is broken and our souls
Have now moved on
If you ever cared for what you had
It's already gone
Leave it all behind - pick up the pieces and run
One flew from the other side
Got caught in the cold
My son, this is war, come and join the fold
Don't you ever look back, put it all to rest
Take your chances but that burden
Won't ever leave your chest
'Cause I see nothing but a deadly sign
Our shallow hearts in a well of wine
Setting our minds straight
Time to open the gates
We are the dead, short days ago
We've lived, felt dawn, saw sunsets glow
We're the keepers of the wisdom below
Neither enemies, friends or ghosts
Take up our quarrel with the foe
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch be yours to hold it high
If you break faith with us who die
In this heartless, meaningless shelter
Below the fields of our spirited past
Cold as ice and with wings of disaster
Well make sure that this moment will last
We all knew it was a calling
And we thought we'd escaped the rain
Growing closer to our dark fate
In this master's tale
Water's rising as we desperately
Reach out for the sun
Deal is broken and our souls
Have now moved on
If you ever cared for what you had
It's already gone
Leave it all behind - pick up the pieces and run
One flew from the other side
Got caught in the cold
My son, this is war, come and join the fold
Don't you ever look back, put it all to rest
Take your chances but that burden
Won't ever leave your chest
'Cause I see nothing but a deadly sign
Our shallow hearts in a well of wine
Setting our minds straight
Time to open the gates
Time to open the gates
