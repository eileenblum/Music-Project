[feat. Dave Sheldon]Turn around my friend
and watch it all go down
with your heart, with your mind.

Let it sink!

Believing your thoughts soon will migrate
to a place where your soul is a storm.
The insight still make you aquiver!

The ethereal glow of the master
who controls all your imminent thoughts
is consuming your way to salvation, heed.

As fire breaks the dawn!

Pervasive hatred now
intruding your inner reluctance,
wuthering days are extending
your breakdown.

Lash out as the thorns
keep piercing your soul,
Washed out as the crown above
your conscience turns cold.

Greeting somber ages to come!

Speeding through chambers of illusion,
summoning the ghosts of ourselves.
The aurora of our blind faith,
it is me but it's you that I feel.

The shivers are constant but soothing,
the love for the order of sins.
It's faithful but still it
is spreading disease.

Pervasive hatred now
intruding your inner reluctance,
wuthering days are extending
your breakdown.

Lash out as the thorns
keep piercing your soul,
Washed out as the crown above
your conscience turns cold.

Greeting somber ages!

Pervasive hatred now

Lash out as the thorns
keep piercing your soul,
Washed out as the crown above

Pervasive hatred now
intruding your inner reluctance,
wuthering days are extending
your breakdown.

Lash out as the thorns
keep piercing your soul,
Washed out as the crown above
your conscience turns cold.

Cold is your state of woe,
greeting somber ages!

Lash out as the thorns
keep piercing your soul,
Washed out as the crown above
your conscience turns cold.

Greeting somber ages to come!
