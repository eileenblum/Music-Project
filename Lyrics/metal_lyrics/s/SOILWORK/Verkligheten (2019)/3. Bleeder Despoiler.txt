Is it you my bleeder despoiler,
all that was and never were?
Hard drugs and heavy religion,
all that was because of her.

Is it you my bleeder despoiler,
all that never came to be?
Hard luck and quick decisions,
all this because of me.

And it's safe,
let your mind just float away
This time we might find a way!
There are words still left to say
for those departed we'll remain.

Is it you my bleeder despoiler,
these words weren't meant to last.
Rough love and premonitions,
all going nowhere fast.

Is it you my bleeder despoiler,
our love's a funeral pyre.
Hard times and quick decisions,
who knows what's left inside.

And it's safe,
let your mind just float away
This time we might find a way!
There are words still left to say
for those departed, let them stay.
