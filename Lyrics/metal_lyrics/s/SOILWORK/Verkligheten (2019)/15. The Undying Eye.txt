Deprived of the fundamentals
Those animalistic needs
Became ever more essential
And so it began to feed
Please don't tell me what you're thinking
Let fire rush to my head
We're trapped in a stare
Unblinking
A hivemind of nearly dead
Still locked to the generator
A current without a spark
My mind was the instigator
My flesh longing for the dark
Finally
There's a trembling light
That's fading over me
Silently
We avert our empty gazes
From the sky
And the undying eye
Deprived of the fundamentals
Those animalistic needs
Please don't tell me what you're thinking
Let fire rush to my head
We're trapped in a stare
Unblinking
A hivemind of nearly dead
Still locked to the generator
A current without a spark
Finally
There's a trembling light
That's fading over me
Silently
We avert our empty gazes
From the sky
And the undying eye
Finally
There's a trembling light
That's fading over me
Silently
We avert our empty gazes
From the sky
And the undying eye
