Was it just a subliminal death threat
when you said that the ending was near?
Was it part of your criminal mindset
to appease the celestial sphere?

Was it Death as an everyday phenomenon
that all is passing like the clouds?
Would you meet me at the gates of Parthenon
to relinquish every doubt?

And if you were on my side
would you leave me to decide?
Will it change this time around
when the wolves are back in town?

Though the times I spent with you
took me further from the truth,
I still hoped you'd be around
when the wolves are back in town.

And so you say
there's an end to the carnage
but no end to the fear,
now your sympathies are clear.

There's a cloud of death around you
and a halo of despair.
And the plague you brought is dying
to infect the midnight air.

There's a cloud of death around you
and a halo of despair.
Though it took so long to find you
you could have me anywhere.

And if you were on my side
would you leave me to decide?
Will it change this time around
when the wolves are back in town?

Though the times I spent with you
took me further from the truth,
I still hoped you'd be around
when the wolves are back in town.

There's a cloud of death around you
