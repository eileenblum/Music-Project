Luminous deity, perilous Djinn,
sacrificed unity, servants of sin.
Ominous spiritus, reaper of souls,
living in all of us, seizing control.

What if it's too late to suffer?
What if it's too late to die?

As we rise, seeking shelter from our sins,
we'll escape from the universe within.
In a time when the veil is growing thin,
we'll take flight from the universe within.

Eschaton aftermath, burying trust,
even this psychopath learns to adjust.
What if it's too late to suffer?
What if if s too late to die?

As we rise, seeking shelter from our sins,
we'll escape from the universe within.
In a time when the veil is growing thin,
we'll take flight from the universe within.

We're unwanted pariahs
at the governance doors,
it's the finalization of
what's happened before.

As we rise, seeking shelter from our sins,
we'll escape from the universe within.
In a time when the veil is growing thin,
we'll take flight from the universe within.

Luminous deity, perilous Djinn,
sacrificed unity, servants of sin.
Ominous spiritus, reaper of souls,
living in all of us, seizing control.

As we rise!
