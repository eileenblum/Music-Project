I've never been your savior,
I've never been your ghost,
and as I'm pushing further
I'm playing the silent host.

I feel like I am treading water,
smoke's still burning my eyes!

Through and through I'm
still captured by disorder,
swept away by every
helpful advice.

Anyone would cure it with blindness,
there were moments where I thought I could be
a man who's aching for the hour of closure.
Darkness clearly kept on covering my needs!

Kept on covering my needs!
But it's not what it seems,
it's just an inner endless shriek!

I won't unchain the lonely,
I won't release their souls,
but I will examine the wishful
and drown in the full moon shoals.

Anyone would cure it with blindness,
there were moments where I thought I could be
a man who's aching for the hour of closure.
Darkness clearly kept on covering my needs!

Kept on covering my needs!
But it's not what it seems,
it's just an inner endless shriek!

Embracing the culmination as the
flames keep licking the sky.

Slowly rising from the murky waters
I reach for the tenebrous sky,
sons and daughters of the repressed order
take my turn and meet the dragon's eye.

Anyone would cure it with blindness,
there were moments where I thought I could be
a man who's aching for the hour of closure.
Darkness clearly kept on covering my needs!

Kept on covering my needs!
But it's not what it seems,
it's just an inner endless shriek!
