We will follow and our hearts will bleed,
servants of the circle will renounce their greed.
We will follow and our hearts will bleed,
servants of the circle will renounce their greed.

Within the realms of reason,
we've felt the ominous rise.
Taking turns to encircle the scapegoat,
our everlasting vice, everlasting vice.

From the shadow of the restless mind
to the hollow and deserted sky.
We feel the hunger but we're
bound by the night.

We see the sign but
we're still slaves of empty...

Spaces controlling this ride,
changing the pace of time,
watching the stars align.

Unknown faces reside in my mind.
Poisoned but mesmerized,
serving the darker times.

We hear a distant calling,
the current is pulling our souls.
Sudden defeat but constant turmoil,
we've embraced our fatal role.

Relieved but torn from the inside,
received but the wish is dead.
The wish is dead!

From the shadow of
the restless mind
we see the sign but
we're still slaves of empty...

Spaces controlling this ride,
changing the pace of time,
watching the stars align.

Unknown faces reside in my mind.
Poisoned but mesmerized,
serving the darker times.

Darker times!

We fear the dawning of a new day,
the bleakest winds are coming through.
If this is death I will remember
every word I saw in you.

Spaces controlling this ride,
changing the pace of time,
watching the stars align.

Unknown faces reside in my mind.
Poisoned but mesmerized,
serving the darker times.

Darker times!
