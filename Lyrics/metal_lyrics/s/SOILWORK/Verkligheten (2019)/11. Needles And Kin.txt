[feat. Tomi Joutsen]Sentinel of the retribution,
summoner of the dying light.
Guardian of the grand delusion,
phosphorus and apatite

She's observed you
from the other world
She has heard you,
every world unfurled.

Soon she is coming,
soon she'll descend.
First we're devolving
then we'll ascend.

And I know it's the only way
out of here that lies ahead,
and I know that she will get us
off this planet of the dead.

Oversight of the ever-watching,
vigilance of the seldom seen.
Sulphurous dawn is soon approaching
promises of what might have been.

Unshed tears cascading from
her interstellar space,
disconnected from the earth
and all that we embraced.

She's observed you
from the other world
She has heard you,
every world unfurled.

Soon she is coming,
soon she'll descend.
First we're devolving
then we'll ascend.

And I know it's the only way
out of here that lies ahead,
and I know that she will get us
off this planet of the dead.
