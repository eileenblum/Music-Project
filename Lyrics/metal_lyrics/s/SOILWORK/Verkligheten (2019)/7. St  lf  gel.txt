Now did you hear the sound
ascending from the ground?
A prayer from those who stayed
or died along the way.

We trust the trembling air
to take us anywhere,
transcending gravity and
hoping that we'll be set free.

Unbound instantly,
airborne aimlessly.
We drift towards the
darkness of our Heavens.

Unbound instantly,
airborne aimlessly.
We drift apart to
finally fade away.

I'm whispering your name,
a memory set to flame
like all I left behind.
Becoming someone
else this time.

Unbound instantly,
airborne aimlessly.
We drift towards the
darkness of our Heavens.

Unbound instantly,
airborne aimlessly.
We drift apart to
finally fade away.
