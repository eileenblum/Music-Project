Soak up the sound of the ageless whisper,
let buried memories form the shadow of doubt.
All those years when your senses would proliferate
you shut the doors but unleashed the hounds.

You spoke the words of reason,
you fired your instincts at will.
You married the rain through the
seasons of everlasting thrills.

Still waiting for a call
as darkness shall befall the
one who never settles within!

Do you remember choosing
death when we were young?
We let the darker moments flourish
and kept our destiny shunned.

Now there is nothing left
from when we used to run,
in the valleys of our dreams
we'd already sold the sun.

Two worlds colliding in a merciless winter,
wearily fires burn inside your soul.
Imaginations thrusting your guidelines
and steals the light beyond control.

You spoke the words of reason,
you fired your instincts at will.
You married the rain through the
seasons of everlasting thrills.

Still waiting for a call
as darkness shall befall.
Darkness shall befall the one
who never settles within!

Settles within!

Do you remember choosing
death when we were young?
We let the darker moments flourish
and kept our destiny shunned.

Now there is nothing left
from when we used to run,
in the valleys of our dreams
we'd already sold the sun.
