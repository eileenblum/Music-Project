Megalithic and ancien,
of unknown origin.
The long dead disciples,
their bones now dust
and scattered in the wind.

These fragments of a soul
like specks of sentient will,
black matter fills the void
of all that can be killed.

Blank-faced enigma,
nurturing stars.
Residual carbon is
all that we are.

At first there is nothing
and then it unfolds.
Evolves into something,
no one can control.

The ones who forgot us
when the dam finally broke
were longing for silence
when the universe spoke.

The eloquence in sadness
of uncompromised loss,
from a temporal riptide
to a cancerous growth as
all the lines are crossed.

Time is the immortal continuum,
Death is this subconscious design.
The relentless scavenger of galaxies
will not cease or devolve.

Blank-faced enigma,
nurturing stars.
Residual carbon is
all that we are.

At first there is nothing
and then it unfolds.
Evolves into something,
no one can control.

The ones who forgot us
when the dam finally broke
were longing for silence
when the universe spoke.

Deflect to the warship,
cease and desist.
The ones that we fought for
are no longer missed.

No!

At first there is nothing
and then it unfolds.
Evolves into something,
no one can control.

The ones who forgot us
when the dam finally broke
were longing for silence
when the universe spoke.
