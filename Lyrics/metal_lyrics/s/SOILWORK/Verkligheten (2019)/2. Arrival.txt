Right then my blood was the sunrise,
my soul the imminent threat.
Jaded by nightmares and nothing but tragedy,
declarations of utter distress.

I will love you but so will the scapegoat
when there's nothing more left to regret.
What I feel as I wade through the ashes
is so much more now, how could I forget?

I feel alive...
My senses flow on repeat,
The essence burns when I feel!

The sky reflects in my hands,
you took my world 'cause you can.
Is it just me or is the light?
Oh read me, you dust ridden seer
and prepare for the night!

It is never too late,
now released from the cage.
But still stuck in a dream,
bleeding through all the seams.

All my inner redemption
was all captured and carried away.
Needing closure but yet stuck on repeat,
speeding through deserts, burned by the heat.

Time will show if I'm fit for the breakdown,
merging the images with all your words.
Everything's falling but I seem to be floating,
quenching my thirst from the deepest of wells.

I feel alive...
My senses flow on repeat,
The essence burns when I feel!

The sky reflects in my hands,
you took my world 'cause you can.
Is it just me or is the light?
Oh read me, you dust ridden seer
and prepare for the night!

It is never too late,
now released from the cage.
But still stuck in a dream,
bleeding through all the seams.
