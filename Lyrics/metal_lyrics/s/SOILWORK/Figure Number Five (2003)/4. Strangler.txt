I feel it coming, my thoughts are running
Cause I can't do nothing about it
I'm turning, turning away from filth
on my journey, stepping aside
from the breed that is burning
How did you get so unbearably stupid
How did you get your demons to rest
One final option, a senseless adoption
of a self-made confidence

[Chorus:]
Bow, to get rid of this
Bow, another fear to kiss
Bow, this is my soulful departure
Walk the lifeline with no regrets
Wasting it all on what you cannot get
Forever painful and so goddamn deranged
Make no difference don't make a sound
Make your choice out of what you've found
Forever painful and so goddamn deranged

Cause I might as well choke
Listen to the sound
cause I can't do nothing about it
Another round of their hysterical laughter
Plaguing my ears, causing my tears

Let's give another hail to the ones
that finally failed
Holding on to the truth 'til the very end
facing their very last stand.
