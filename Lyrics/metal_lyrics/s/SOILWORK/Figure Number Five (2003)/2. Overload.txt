Still I'm spreading my disease
You'll work it out this time
Hell no, I won't retreat
Two times won't make it happen
Three times won't make it go
Overcome, make it run
I insist to make it flow

Now I'm chasing what I've learned
You won't be blind this time
Getting back what they have burned
Two times won't make it happen
Three times won't make it go
Overload, still it grows
I resist and make it flow

[Chorus:]
Trusting the ways of my vulnerable heart
A million times before I get things right.
So fragile it hurts when I just fall apart.

Still I wont get what I deserve,
Your search for dreams may falter
Paying back won't make it turn
Four times won't make it happen
Five times won't make it go
Overrule, from a tool
that brings me everlasting pain

Those thoughts are ruling my valuable time
In search for shelter I draw the lines
Won't you give me another break to examine
my growing and countless mistakes
