[Japan Bonus Track]I share a common disease
I don't know but I think they call it greed
unfaithful to my alternate self
every once in a while
I'm here to live and tell

Well I lie and do as I please
'cause I'm out of belief
I can't claim for my wrong
unless you play that song

[chorus:]
you've gotta give back what you've taken
'cause the devil's part of the making
you've gotta give back it all
before you get the pain once more
(pain once more)

I'll be a cynic till the end of time
out of reach and I crossed that line
what I've caused just doesn't mean a thing
bursting out to the chest to a king

I never meant to be cruel
just like the fact
of being a fool
for several million
you'll never last in
a billion

well I lie and do as I please
'cause I'm out of belief
I can't claim for my wrong
unless you play that song

[chorus:]
you've gotta give back what you've taken
'cause the devil's part of the making
you've gotta give back it all

before you get the pain once more
(pain once more)

[chorus:]
(play that song)
you've gotta give back what you've taken
'cause the devil's part of the making
you've gotta give back it all
before you get the pain once more
(pain once more)

I'll be a cynic till the end of time
out of reach and I crossed that line
what I've caused just doesn't mean a thing
bursting out to the chest to a king
