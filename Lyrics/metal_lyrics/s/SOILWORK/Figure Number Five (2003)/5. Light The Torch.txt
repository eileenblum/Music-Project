Claiming he's an innocent soul
Son of a silent force
Under pressure but all so cold
I better light the torch
Cause he's able to do it again
degrade and suffocate
Getting the useful support
from his passive friends

How can you just proceed you little callous fuck
You just walk the streets like a not knowing breed

[Chorus:]
Give me a sign and I'll do just
what I'm thinking right away
How can she ever forget, so suffer and start to regret
It will come around cause you know that she'll
be thinking of you...
I feel so powerless. Can't face my hollowness

You've had your time. Gonna walk that line
Like a living travesty, endlessly bound to your sins.
I'll hunt you down in time. You're just a feeble swine
How can I compromise when all you do is deny

This pain will last forever, never growing old
Nobody will ever answer, how you can be so cold
