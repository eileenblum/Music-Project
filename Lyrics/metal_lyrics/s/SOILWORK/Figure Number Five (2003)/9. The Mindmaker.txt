Who dares to care when affection's all we need
Who dares to bare what the others have to feel
I put my trust in a prominent machine
Feel no pain and don't you dare to make a scene

The search for truth's just moving' on
everybody wants a piece,
denying the sound of their restless song
Keep your eye on where you've gone
I don't think that you belong. Escaping reality
won't set your judgement free.
Who'll hide to find the ultimate belief
Who'll ride the kind of perpetual disease
I thought that still every breath I take is free
I was so wrong they'll make a profit out of me

[Chorus:]
When you've lost your power
You drag yourself down
In times like these. You are here to devour
Now you feel so numb.

"God I feel so numb!!!"

So! eternal Cold! infernal
So! dispersal. One more time.
So! eternal Cold! infernal
So! dispersal. It rules your mind
