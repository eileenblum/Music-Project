You're taking care of your instincts
No matter what you do
Your life could be so much better when everything is through
The demons that refused to let you go
They leave with empty hands
You got to give it a try
Don't put an end to your life
Cause that's where you show your last sign

[Chorus:]
You gotta rise with me!
Cause you're so vulnerable... Me!
No need for sympathy now...
Yet so admirable... Say...

Your passion for art is your well hidden cure
Cause that's where you have a plan
Escaping could be such a movement now
In your fragile heart also true

[Chorus]

... You'll never ever hurt yourself again!
