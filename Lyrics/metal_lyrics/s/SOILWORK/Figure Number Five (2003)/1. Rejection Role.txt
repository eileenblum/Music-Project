I'm the result of an ageless redemption
a body with a heartless convention
a face with a smile that's been shut down for years
facing the facts of my generation...cause
I'm a sinner, a winner, my blood is getting thinner
I might as well get another life cause I've been there
I know what's been said and I know what's been done
don't you tell me I'm the only one, cause I...

[Chorus:]
I will be there looking for something
Coming straight out of nothing, just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
I really am waiting for nothing
Coming straight out of something, just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile

Now put your trust in a solid machine
Filled with words that have never been seen
A plague to insatiable souls left to die
Charged with mankind's raw energy
I rumble, I stumble
My memory starts to crumble
I can't refuse what's haunting my dreams
Have I stumbled?
On my way to a created perfection
I penetrate the gates of rejection

There's no determination, echoes of a failed gallery
There's yet extermination, inside us all screaming
