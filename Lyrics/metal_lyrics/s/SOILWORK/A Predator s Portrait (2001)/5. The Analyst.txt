Straight forward on the path of life,Who makes you choose
that way Is it a crime to give it all up,To leave it all behind
Oh...this is all so crystal clear Going on in shallow blindness
To watch the madmen sort things out No time to spill,Isn't
it such a thrill? By self-deception I am bound to take it
seriously I'm way beyond,I've put myself in such horrible
way to go

[Chorus x 2]
I think you just made a big mistake...This is just a fake cause
I am,Guilty by association,sinner of mankind,I'm forced to
build my life upon this,hidden path I just can't find.

Well...is this all so crystal clear?
Sometimes it seems like time stands still Demolish myself at
free will,Can you watch me burn As the sun goes down and
my life is overturned,Can I identify myself with the
judgement that I'm facing here Can't deny,won't deny that
I'm level with the ground by fear

[Chorus]
Punished and banished I kill the ways of life You predict and
restrict my views in the hands of time

[Chorus]

You wear the face of desperate man displacing his fatal
actions Refuse to recall the miserable times of stupid and
naive attractions Going on in shallow blindness To watch
the madmen sort things out No time to spill,Isn't it such a
thrill? By self-deception I am bound to take it seriously I'm
way beyond,I've put myself in such a horrible way to go

[Chorus]

I think you just made a big mistake...This conversation's over
The analyst may have won this case of,discrimination and
nothing but lies,This fallen era makes me wonder,Is it worth
it when your dignity dies
