I lick the surface of a freedom ride Under a hammering
light....I scream!!! Let's roll the dice of the future,burning
in my hand,I've built destruction upon the velvet skies
Maybe I'm strong,maybe I'm wrong

[Chorus x3]
Lead us,Shadowchild - soiled bu your faith in disguise
Shadowside - reflecting the eyes

I'm raising hell,a magic spell Pain and pleasure
together as one,I will recall,I will recall When I'm
down the stairs....I spit human cries,I can feel when
they lie My sun being one with the...universe Hear my
call

[Chorus]

Creating my crown from the millions of lights I'm
abused beyond recognition Pre-Millennium futuristic I
predict you all to live Under an individual sun We're all
collecting our senses and run...

[Chorus]
Lead us,Shadowchild - soiled bu your faith in disguise,
Shadowside - reflecting the eyes,Lead us,Shadowchild
- the truth's lying far from your life,Shadowside -
reflecting the eyes...
