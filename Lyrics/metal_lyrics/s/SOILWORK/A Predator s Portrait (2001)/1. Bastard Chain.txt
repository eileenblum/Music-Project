Searching for power,who is to blame ? You weak little
bastard - bound to symbols of pain,Hiding in shadows,a
pungent smell,You haven't decide your own fate cause
your story of life is too bitter to tell Your dying eyes with a
cowards reflection,Heading for the true direction, forward
to die !

[Chorus]
Bastard Chain, with souls so lame the bastards chain Bastard
Chain, with souls so lame A Bastards chain [x3]

So you say your mind belongs to them ? - turned upside
down again and again and again Feel ashame ,feel ashame,
Yourself to blame,yourself to blame - Only yourself...Only
yourself you can blame! only yourself you can blame ! [x3]

[Chorus]

Helpless you will devour,everything that comes before your
eyes Citizens of restless power,never let your scorn rule
your fate...Your fate!! ...always dragging you down,to the
ground,A disgrace,a disgrace,your "masterpiece",your
"masterrace" - only yourself,...only yourself you can
blame !! Only yourself you can blame ! [x3]

[Chorus]

Hey!Won't you tell me your name and justify your way of
thinking Walking the stairs of the manipulated ones - only
yourself,...only yourself you can blame!! Only yourself you
can blame ! [x3]
