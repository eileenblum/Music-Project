[Japan &amp; Korea version only]

Can you see me crawling,
Down the trail of despair
Forgot how to cherish myself
Painful writings everywhere

[Chorus:]
I can see strange things coming over me
I can feel

Stare into my eyes believe me
I'm the one to forget what's right
As the blazing fire awakes
I turn to stone, there is no fright
Heavenly pleasures grants my desires
I'm totally lost
Demolation of the human nature
No matter what the cost

[Chorus]

Everytime I loose my judgement
You try to grab a hold of me
Vem fan ar du, jag gor vad jag vill,
medans tiden star still

[Chorus]

Watch me dance as I'm totally lost
One step closer to infinity

A great pretender, a face of an angel
Buried alive, alive!

Watch me dance as I'm totally lost
One step closer to infinity

A great pretender, a face of an angel
Buried alive, alive!
