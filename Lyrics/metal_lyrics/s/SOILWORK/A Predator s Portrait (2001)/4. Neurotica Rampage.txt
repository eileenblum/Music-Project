Neurotica you player and daughter of mine
Don't you think I know what's all behind I suck on your evil
punches that my grants soul tumble and roll You give me
strength to break my chains Demonic assaults is all that
remains - raising hell within my veins,claim it's right to play
those games you're making me repeat myself again - bury
the hatchet,light my torch A true believer,a deadly force
you're making my sore eyes live again The wrath of my
demon Is all that I can give back to you No use for solitude It's
better to be burned And not to learn that your master will
return You give me strength to break my chains Demonic
assaults is all that remains - raising hell within my veins,
claim it's right to play those games,you're making me
repeat myself again, -bury the hatchet,light my torch,A
true believer,a deadly force,you're making my sore eyes live
again

[Chorus x 3]
Hear! hear them say it's so clear,What's behind and so near
Hear them say it's so clear...,That you're one of them

Look at the inside and tell me that everything there is so
sane You're so affective and only got your roots to blamed
You give me strength to break my chains Demonic assaults
is all that remains - raising hell within my veins,claim it's
right to play those games you're making me repeat myself
again - bury the hatchet,light my torch A true believer,
a deadly force you're making my sore eyes live again

[Chorus]

You give me strength to break my chains Demonic assaults
is all that remains

[Chorus]
