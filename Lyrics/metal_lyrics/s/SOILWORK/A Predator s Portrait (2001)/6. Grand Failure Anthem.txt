Look at the pale face in the sky It seems so ravaged inside
the sense of rage is burning my eyes,burning in my eyes,
burning to deny I'm apart of a fallen machine Which
reflects my life of misery - please guide my way through
fallen galaxies Grand Failure anthem - you'll never see what
you've become we want to get some well-earned respect
before we choke Well,there isn't anything that will kill our
lust,our lust for power...they say: "may you get an hour in
heaven before the devil knows your dead!" Grand failure
anthem - you'll never see what you've become we'll never
get some well-earned respect cause we have..Failed!Failed!
Failed!,Ripped another spine 'til the end of time Failed!
Failed!Failed! We're being flushed down the drain

[Chorus x 3]
And the one you hate,will suddenly be yourself,and it's all to
late...

Anything,anything what will Make my conscience clean Is
there anyone out there,who can restore what we have
destroyed? Grand failure anthem - you'll never see what
you've become we'll never ever get some well-earned
respect cause we have...Failed!Failed!Failed! Ripped
another spine 'til the end of time Failed!Failed!Failed!
We're being flushed down the drain

[Chorus]

Disruptive and bound to kill itself The face of earth will turn
When you're crawling to the cross And your inner thoughts
reveal themselves Grand failure anthem - you'll never see
what you've become we'll never get some well-earned
respect cause we have...Failed!Failed!Failed!Ripped
another spine 'til the end of time Failed!Failed!Failed!
We're being flushed down the drain...

[Chorus]

So you have died,you pale face in the sky The rage is
burning...burning my eyes I'm blind Grand failure anthem
- we'll never see what we've become we'll never get some,
well earned respect.......
