Well,it's one for the money,two for the show it makes
no difference where I'll go Push injections in my skin
To make my mission begin Needles to fly,needlefeast,
needles to die,needlefeast Gotta get inside,gotta get
inside,needles to die needles to fly Burning up my
hunger,lay it all to rest! Waking up my hostile pain,
put it to the test When all is said and done I tell you
I'm the one The one to reign supreme I'm like a
brickwall I'm a solid player and I'm standing tall Who
can make me fall On this very road...Needles to fly,
needlefeast,needles to die,needlefeast Gotta get
inside,gotta get inside,needles to die needles to fly
Fly!Fly!Fly!

[Chorus]
This life I cannot face it,with the writings on the wall,
this time - it's hard to face it As I'm screaming what am I
doing here ?!!

I bite the days like a suctionpump Another breath,
another punch It makes me catch my breath Needles
to fly,needlefeast,needles to die,needlefeast Gotta get
inside,gotta get inside,needles to die needles to fly Fly! Fly!
Fly!

[Chorus]

Before you steal my breath away I like to know if I was led
astray Neurosis comes to me at night,It holds the truth
cause I'm... one for the money,two for the show
Straight to hell is where I go! [x3] Go!Go!Go!

[Chorus]
This life I cannot face it,with the writings on the wall,this
time-it's hard to face it As I'm screaming... What am I doing
here?!! [Repeat]
