Bring punishment to get hold of me
So cold like a glance from my eyes
Accept the way it's meant to be
A mental sacrifice
Go down hear the sound of a gentle man
Leading you straight to the void
Where the neon bastards they make
Dropouts out of leftover toys

[Chorus]

No more angels, no more painful lies
No more strangers, no more waste of time

So here I am going straight to the plan
Never knowing that I'm damned
Walking the thread that's so precious to me
A secret part of my history
My time- to short as nothing beckons to me
My time- goddamn what is it I try to be
Fill the hole a thousand feet below
Become the master of a freak show

So!! Cold!!
Right! Now! [Repeat]

[Chorus]

No more angels, no more painful lies
No more strangers, no more waste of time

Bring punishment to get hold of me
So cold like a glance from my eyes
Accept the way it's meant to be
A mental sacrifice
Go down- the keeper of your thoughts may be
Go down- a sacred child who just can't see
Counting the days. so amazed
Of this sweet and miserable effort

So!! Cold!!
Right! Now! [Repeat]

[1st Lead Frenning]
[2nd Lead IA]

So!! Cold!!
Right! Now! [Repeat]

[Chorus]

No more angels, no more painful lies
No more strangers, no more waste of time
