Black star whenever you're ready
you're much too far away!
By now your soul seems steady now crawl to the cross

Meanwhile time takes a turn
-I'm feeling damned when you make it burn
Let's testify you're born to die
-You speak the truth and so do I
Don't give it away
-Don't give it away
don't try to nail
don't you try to nail
Don't try to nail!!

Black star whenever you're ready
you're much too far away!
By now your soul seems steady now crawl to the cross

[Chorus]

Black star deceiver kills it all
THe sun lies waiting for a call

You seem to be a fatal one
come watch me preach under the gun
I'm down and out, so down and out!

Black star whenever you're ready
you're much too far away!
By now your soul seem steady now crawl to the cross

[Chorus]

Black star deceiver kills it all
The sun lies waiting for a call [Repeat]

[1st Lead Frenning]
[2nd Lead Wichers]

Take me away, I'm in distress
Oh grand deceiver put me to rest
I was never in pain, sick or insane
So hear me now you're the one I blame!

Meanwhile time takes a turn
-I'm feeling damned when you make it burn
Let's testify you're born to die
-You speak the truth and so do I
Don't give it away
-Don't try to nail!

Black star whenever you're ready
you're much too far away!
By now your soul seem steady now crawl to the cross

[Chorus]

Black star deceiver kills it all
The sun lies waiting for a call [Repeat]
