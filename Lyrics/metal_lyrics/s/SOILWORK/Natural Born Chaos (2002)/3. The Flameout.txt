Don't look for compassion as long as you
Keep turning away
It's all that matters to me
When I try to puzzle your pain
You struggle against yourself by living in the dust
Can't you realize there's no one here who you can't trust
May the gods have mercy on your bastard brain
Hold on one more second my fatal one

[Chorus]

Feeding angels with despair
flameout's reigning everywhere
And you need it so, you just can't let it go away

I try hard to pull the strings of your life, adopting my
soul to figure out what's right
Deep down I know you can make it shine
-Save yourself and do not decline
An acute manner for an acute self-destructive kind
It is structured before your eyes
you're so inferior and vile!
A creator of demonized stress and steals the crown from
the evil ones living in his mess

The remnants of his youth lies public
just if someone cares...
-Swallow the bitter pill and justify!

[Chorus]

Feeding angels with despair
flameout's reigning everywhere
And you need it so, you just can't let it go away

So here I stand all alone
where is the face that I used to know
can't believe you never found out why?
why keep on hurting you're self

[Lead Frenning]

You struggle against yourself by living in the dust
Can't you realize there's no one here who you can't trust
May the gods have mercy on your bastard brain
Hold on one more second my fatal one

[Chorus]

Feeding angels with despair
flameout's reigning everywhere
And you need it so, you just can't let it go away
[Repeat]
