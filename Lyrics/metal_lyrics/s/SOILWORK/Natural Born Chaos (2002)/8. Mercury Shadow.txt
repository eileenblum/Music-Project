Breakdown of a shadow unknown
Tomorrow belongs to no one
As I repent the things I've done
There is a freeway heading for sorrow
Breakdown cause you've had enough
You've never felt so strong
Steal away, steal away let it all astray
It's been so long!
When there comes a time
With a feast on what used to be mine
Sent from the front to the back
All in numbers and fellish black [Repeat]

[Chorus]

We know how to spit or swallow
Bring out, the Mercury Shadow

Is this the statement that I feel?
-Accused to be an unbeliever

Hit the lights and won't you please resign
Way down and right on time

Is this the statement that I feel?
Acccused to be an unbeliever

Won't you shut all the doors in mind
The ones you cannot find
There is no way that I can see
Why you keep on... haunting me!

[Chorus]

We know how to spit or swallow
Bring out, the Mercury Shadow [Repeat]
