As we speak...
-the stable table turns
As we speak...
-I should have known we're burned
And I guess I'll never never learn which of those faces
who makes it all turn
As we speak...
-I'm going deeper down
As we speak...
-With a terrible sound
a feeble holy bastard son
has it only just begun?

[Chorus]

I turn away.....fading out alone
Was a lifetime worth it all?
...fading out...fading out alone
Ass we speak we turn to stone

As we speak...
A young man looses his mind
As we speak...
He kills what's next in line...
A broken down mother ask herself why
-Is this the end of her precious time?
As we speak...
-a conscience leaves without a trace
a silent departure to a silent place
what do we know about the anger that starts to grow

Don't despair, time will heal your torment
Don't you dare, spend your days in hell
So beware, faith will bring you treason
While you stare... Oh!

[1st Lead Frenning, 2nd Lead Wichers]

I turn away....fading out alone
Was a lifetime worth it all?
...fading out...fading out alone
As we speak we turn to stone [Repeat]
As a lifetime turns to stone...
