Now the Bombshell babies see the world
with brand new eyes
The day they were born they couldn't get it right
Leaving scars and agony
Gathered in a fatal colony
We've seen 'em fall
One for all, bitter and bright
Nailed to the wall
Closing in as the terror's going blind
Ruthless and devastating as our time just passes by
We've lost our patience and our belief
Dismantled and broken as the sirens shriek
What can we do, what can we say
Our veins are filled with pure dismay

[Chorus]

Staring through the windows
Waiting for all sins to be born
Playing on a mindfield, searching like never before

Now that our state of mind has left us broken and divine
We never meant to hurt ourselves
-Signed, sealed completely blind
There's a lack of foundation
A horrible scream of our nation cause...
We've seen 'em fall
One for all, bitter and bright
Nailed to the wall
What can we do, what can we say
Our veins are filled with pure dismay

[Chorus]

Staring through the windows
Waiting for all sins to be born
Playing on a mindfield, searching like never before

[1st Lead Frenning]
[2nd Lead Wichers]

Staring through the windows
Waiting for all sins to be born
Playing on a mindfield, searching like never before
