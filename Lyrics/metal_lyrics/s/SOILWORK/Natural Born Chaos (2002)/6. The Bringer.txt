Hey soilmates, we're facing the end
We're down low no use to pretend
A bitter message from heaven sent
it says we're asleep at the wheel again
Let's say we're stuck in an illusion
Let's say we're out of control
Possessed by a lethal redeemer
Forcing us to play a neurotic role
Oh, won't you take this thing out of me
It never leaves me alone
Fight the demons and devastate
This mental battlezone

[Chorus]

Bring it back, bring it home
Enough is enough, I'm alone
Everything's set all ready to go away
Bring it back, bring it home
To the place I used to know
There comes a time
when this nighmare will turn to hate

Beware what you intend to say
Those words will always make you pay
Repress what's before your eyes
Gather the spirits and hypnotize
Let's say we're stuck in an illusion
Let's say we're out of control
Possessed by a lethal redeemer
Forcing us to play a neurotic role
Oh, won't you take this thing out of me
It never leaves me alone
Fight the demons and devastate
This mental battlezone
I wait for this to overcome
What's inside it needs to be done
this vital plague has brought my pain
and endless pain...

[Chorus]

Bring it back, bring it home
Enough is enough, I'm alone
Everything's set all ready to go away
Bring it back, bring it home
To the place I used to know
There comes a time
when this nighmare will turn to hate

[1st Lead Wichers]
[2nd Lead Frenning]

[Chorus]

Bring it back, bring it home
Enough is enough, I'm alone
Everything's set all ready to go away
Bring it back, bring it home
To the place I used to know
There comes a time
when this nighmare will turn to hate

Oh, won't you take this thing out of me
It never leaves me alone
Fight the demons and devastate
This mental battlezone
I wait for this to overcome
What's inside it needs to be done
this vital plague has brought my pain
and endless pain...
