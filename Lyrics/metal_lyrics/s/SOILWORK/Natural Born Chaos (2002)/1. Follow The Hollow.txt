I fought the forces that will bring me down
they crawl without a sound
They wake me up at night, kill the lights, make it right
No time for slumber I'm getting dumber every sigh,
-everytime I'm standing tall, everytime I rise and fall

I think w'ere closer now, I'm getting nearer
I can see it touching ground, it's getting clearer
can't you see I'm way behind, I'm so sincere
I believe you'll never find.

wee out the sun, under the gun
kneel down for the ricochet
my future tells no lies to a creature with o rights
as for the plans I have in mind I have nothing left to find
please show a sign, who's next in line?

I think we're closer now, I'm getting nearer
I can see it touching ground, it's getting clearer
can't you see I'm all denied faithfucked believer
I claim you'll never find a better fear

[Chorus]

take a look, take a ride, stay by my side
don't dare to think-let's FOLLOW THE HOLLOW
it kills your pride to be alive
please step a side, cause I FOLLOW THE HOLLOW!

we head for hell and we do it well, come eat the dust
cause it's all a dirty lie that chokes the sky

I think we're closer now, I'm getting nearer
I can see it touching ground, it's getting clearer
can't you see I'm way behind, I'm so sincere
I believe you'll never find a better fear

[Chorus]

take a look, take a ride, stay by my side
don't dare to think-let's FOLLOW THE HOLLOW
it kills your pride to be alive
please step a side, cause I FOLLOW THE HOLLOW! [Repeat]

[Lead Frenning]

I think we're closer now, I'm getting nearer
I can see it touching ground, it's getting clearer
can't you see I'm all denied faithfucked believer
I claim you'll never find a better fear

[Chorus]

take a look, take a ride, stay by my side
don't dare to think-let's FOLLOW THE HOLLOW
it kills your pride to be alive
please step a side, cause I FOLLOW THE HOLLOW! [Repeat]
