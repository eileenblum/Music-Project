In this land of misery
Infliction and slavery
Too much blood was spilt
Our people died for liberty

Dust and bones over the sands
We must fight, we shanât be bland

Itâs the time to rise in arms
Wonât give in until we die
Call upon the Gods Of War
Onuris be our sacred guide

Time has come for revolution
Time has come for us to blow them away
Only victory or dying
The rebellion will break out once and for all
