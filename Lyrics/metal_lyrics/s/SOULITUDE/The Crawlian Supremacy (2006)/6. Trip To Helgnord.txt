Somewhere far beyond the dunes
In the land of ice
Find the King Of Helgnord
Go Masud, follow the runes
Freedomâs in your hands
Gather all the viking clans

Wind and sun, cold and heat
Travel through the arid sands of Dhalm
Ice and snow, rain and storm
Travel to the north and reach your goal

Thy command is my task
No time for hesitation
My mission will be over
The way is long and risky
I leave now, my master
Iâll give my life for Mubians liberty

We sneak between the shadows
We cross the enemy lines
No storm or heavy weather
Will stop us âtil we die

Under the moons of Thralldoom
We are creeping in the night
Like serpents within shadows
To avoid the Crawlian sight
