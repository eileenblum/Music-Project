Many men are wounded
And some others passed away
Let us pray for the fallen ones

Great Moon is the witness
Of the day when overcame
Let us pray to the Gods above

And together we shall reign
In the name of human kind

We die but I swear that we will return
Lifeâs gone but I swear that we will
reborn

Spread the word of freedom
From the North right to the South
Tell our people that peace is at hand

Welcome to the new times
Of harmony and peace
And forever weâll cherish this land
