Weapons armed and ready
Legions sent to war
Storming without mercy
Kill and maim them all

They march to war beneath the star lights
10.000 soldiers
The clash is close the flag is waving
March of the Crawlians

Heolfor obbey my orders
Leave no sign of life
Bring me the head of Khalid
Ruin the viking tribe
