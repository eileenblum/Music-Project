Lord Ravenous something is going on
The Oracle has seen a vision
Pictures of chaos, supremacyâs gone
The all seeing eye tells no lies

Rebels are gathering to start the revolt
Trying to change our fate
Futureâs uncertain we must get prepared
Avoid the attack before itâs too late

The crimson sky light fades away
Turning to darkness
One deadly silence hangs about
Howling echoes mourn aloud
The moons will cry out to the stars
High in the heavens
All clouds above are dyed in red
Tears of blood will flow on earth

Prophecy is telling what youâre gonna see
Clear is the Spectral Sphere
Get ready the troops for the final outcome
Is coming The Day of sorrow and pain
