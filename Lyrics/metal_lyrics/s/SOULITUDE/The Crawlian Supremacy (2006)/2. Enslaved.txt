All over space we are taking control
Slaving all races wherever we go
Down on your knees, domination complete
Pain and submission to satiate our greed

Out in the stars
In a planet Godforsaken and lost
Out in the stars
Thousand years light far away from home

Civilizations we took from The Earth
Mines in Thralldoom is the end they will find
Forests of Helgnord for the viking tribe
Dunes of Mub Harass for the egyptian kind
