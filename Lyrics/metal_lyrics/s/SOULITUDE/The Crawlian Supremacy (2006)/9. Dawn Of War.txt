Sun is rising in the sky
Frozen dew upon the land
UV rays melt the ice
On this day of war youâll die

We are not afraid we wonât surrender
We are not afraid we wonât give in
Rather dead than living in sorrow
Rather dead than living in pain

Look at the armies of humans united
Standing on the horizon

Follow the sign of Helgnord
Morning has broken, Dawn of War
Heeding the call of the horns
There is no turning back, Dawn Of War

Donât you dare to change your fate
Never try to put us down
Youâd better give up and be a slave
Otherwise youâll meet your grave
