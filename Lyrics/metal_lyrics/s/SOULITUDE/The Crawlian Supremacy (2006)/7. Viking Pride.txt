Elders have told us stories
About the old Planet Earth
Roots of our people and culture
Dawn of the human breed.

Odin is guiding our trail
Sorrow and death you will find
The Hammer of Thor will not fail
Weâll exterminate all your kind

Too many years of damnation
Living in a mourning keen
The day of revenge now is closer
When we all be free like the wind
