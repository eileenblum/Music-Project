Chaos
Confusion, pain and chaos
The punishment and horror
Across the Universe

Sorrow
Youâll feel the whip of sorrow
The wrath of Ravial Tantrum
Across the astral plane

They came from a distant galaxy
Steeping into ecstasy
To rule the worlds

They came setting up supremacy
Storming with no clemency
Throughout the worlds

Suffer
Forevermore youâll suffer
In constant fear and sadness
Across the galaxies

Menace
We bring the threat and menace
A nightmare for the planets
Obbey our discipline
