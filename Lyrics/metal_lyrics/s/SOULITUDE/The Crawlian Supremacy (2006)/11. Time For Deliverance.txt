Lord, the battleâs on their side
Hate, I see it in their eyes
Base of Zoldiath has been wrecked
Hordes of humans everywhere

Bloodshed and dismay all across the planet
Decaying flesh for the scavengers
Victors cheer aloud in a jubilance chant
Wielding up their weapons to the sky

Thralldoomâs on fire, fire them all
Alliance has succeed
And mankind is victorious
Fire, fire them all
New age has been born
Now itâs time for deliverance

Blood and corpses on the ground
Death is lurking all around
Praise, invoke the Halig Gast
The Sublife waits for us
