Here we are at the edge of space
Equations have been checked and weâre ready to go
We shall cross the Einsteinâs Bridge
Travel to another dimension unknown

Interuniversal gate
Through the hole that formed the collapse of a star
Faster than the speed of light
Navigate the Kruskal spacetime diagram

Start countdown and say farewell

Swallows every beam of light
And bring you to another place and time
The Wormhole
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing
Soon weâll know the mysteries behind
The Wormhole

Based on Schwarzschild geometry
Simulations work out but now this is real
Reach the outer boundary
Mission will be done and our dreams will fulfill

See you on the other side
