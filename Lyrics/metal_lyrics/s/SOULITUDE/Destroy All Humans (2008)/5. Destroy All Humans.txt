The more I know you, the more I hate you
Infested planet by a plague of bastards

Now Iâm gonna tell you whatâs my biggest satisfaction
Total extermination of this foolish population

Hatred, standing by my side
Mankind, say your prayers and die

Day after day, time after time
Your senseless lives, food for my gun
