Fighting for the enduring freedom
Iâll bring you peace, prepare for war
Pay me cash or pay me in petrol
And sorry for the damage done

Justice and liberty, yes I am, Born In America
I'll keep your country clean 'cause I am Born In America

Iâm so proud I feel so haughty
Everytime those rockets fly
When itâs time for the call of duty
Bars and stars are on my side

Justice and liberty, yes I am, Born In America
I'll keep your country clean 'cause I am Born In America
