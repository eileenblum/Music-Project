Lightning, in the sky
Before the blitz of fire
An angel have arrived
The savior of mankind

He came down to heal
From a distant galaxy
He came to reveal
What said the Prophecy

Further than the sun
There is a sacred Eden
Father, Iâm your son
Deliver me from evil

He came from the stars
From a distant Universe
Releasing us all
From darkness and ignorance

I will teach you to survive
I will give the Earth a chance
Praise and worship for your life

Take my hand I will show you better tomorrow
A new paradise, alien messiah
Iâm the chosen one I will wipe out your sorrow
Follow the wise, the alien messiah

Bible is a fake
Forget the host and wine
Old Gods passed away
And Jesus did resign
