Break the chains leave all behind
Be yourself just for a while
Escape from reality

In the corridor of life
Human cattleâs walking straight
Knelt to their destiny

I know a secret
A place behind these walls
Donât be afraid and run away

Let me out, set me free
This is not what it was meant to be
I want out, leave me be
Donât wanna be a clone of mediocrity

In a world of black and white
With no colours and no light
They try to lead your dreams

Close your eyes and you may find
Just a little peace of mind
In my new society
