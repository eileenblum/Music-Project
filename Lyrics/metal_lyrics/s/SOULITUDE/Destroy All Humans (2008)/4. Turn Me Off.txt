I can live one million years or even more
I can be forever young, never get old
Stronger than a hundred men, and a higher IQ
Even though I try hard, Iâll never be like you

Give me life
Give me birth
Give me love
Give me a soul

No emotions can process this microchip
I ainât got a heart inside but only batteries
Am I dead?, Am I alive? Or just a fantasy
If Iâm only a machine, please tell me what I feel

All my system seems to break down again
Terabytes of tears flood my core
I was not programmed to destroy myself
Disconnect me and donât turn me on
