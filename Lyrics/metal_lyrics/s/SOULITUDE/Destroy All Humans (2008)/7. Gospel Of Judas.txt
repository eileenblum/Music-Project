Judas Iscariot, betrayer of God
From this day on, thou shall be cursed

Gospels of Mark, John, Mathew and Luke
The legacy for the Holy Book

For you will sacrifice
The man that clothes me now
The star before your eyes
Will guide you when I go

Does the Bible tell the truth
Why they do conceal the proof , Gospel Of Judas
Centuries of misbelief
Might pull down christianity, Gospel Of Judas

Stone him to death, hang him on a tree
Fake suicide for the disciple of greed

New Testament will rule the world
So it is written and so It shall be done

Step away from them
Betray me I beg you, son
My Kingdom is in the end
To you it will be shown
