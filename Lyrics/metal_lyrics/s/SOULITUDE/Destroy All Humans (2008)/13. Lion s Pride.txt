Hear the scream
of the ones who face the beast
In the field
Goliathâs eager for the feast

Here we are
More than hundred years of fight
Keep the flame
Days of glory will come back

Donât give up, never give in

Restless we are one of a kind
They donât understand
Never shall we burn down in Hell
In union we will stand

Hold your ground
Now is time to cry aloud
Head held high
We are different and we are proud

Raise the flag
Wield the crest up to the sky
Red and white
Colours of the lionâs pride

Donât give up, never give in
