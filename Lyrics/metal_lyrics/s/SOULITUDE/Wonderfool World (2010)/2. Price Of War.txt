Hatred, since you were born
Grow with a gun in your hands
Hold on, show them no fear
Die like a hero or live like a fool
Helpless, nothing to loose
Follow the way the brave
Beware which side you choose
Kill or be killed is the script on your grave
Living on the run
Sleeping with your gun
Playing in a game
You'll get no fun
When the game is over
And your lifeless body
Lie in the ground
Don't wait for the angels
Rest forever in a burial mound
Trapped in a row
Beforehand was lost
Now pay the price of war
