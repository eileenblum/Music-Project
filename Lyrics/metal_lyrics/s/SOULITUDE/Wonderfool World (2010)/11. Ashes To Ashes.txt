[David Bowie cover]

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man
I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all
I've needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of jap girls in synthesis and
I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet its glowing
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again I tell myself I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again

I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
