Left or right, fight for the crown
Choose your side, fool or clown
Working classes
Act like asses
Mass brainwashes
Retarded nation
Look aside, close your eyes
Hypnotized by their lies
Feed your master
Working harder
Die of hunger
Retarded nation
On and on, trip on the same stone
On and on, get nothing in return
Promise words, broken laws
Be a pawn on their board
Just a illusion
Constitution
Media abduction
Retarded nation
