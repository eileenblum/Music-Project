All aboard, hoist the sails
The journey has begun
Say farewell you may not return
Navigate to the north
Where no man's been before
To conquer the Northern Pole
We sail by the open sky
The stars will light our way
Polar circle is beating us all
Godforsaken, we're lost in the ice
Arctic rage wind and storm
No mercy no relief
The icecap moves under our feet
Day after day week by week
The goal cannot be achieved
My challenge is now my defeat
Winter's here, ice and snow
Give up this is the end
We won't reach the top of the world
Years have gone by and we know
There's only one hope
A miracle will take us home
