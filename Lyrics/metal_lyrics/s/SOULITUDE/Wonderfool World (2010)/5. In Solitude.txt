I'm alone
The world is mine
Once so bustling
And now so quiet
Scavengers coming
To enjoy the feast
Am I still a man
Or I'm a beast
Now here I stand
Waiting, rambling
The dominance of humans
Has come to the end
My desperate cries for help
Vanish like whispers
I am the last survivor
Over the Earth
Alone in solitude
Roaming, drifting
I am the last of men
Reprieved by the Death
Now here I stand
Waiting for nothing
If God is everywhere
Then why am alone
