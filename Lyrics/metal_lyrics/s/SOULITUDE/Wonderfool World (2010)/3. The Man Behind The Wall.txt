Demons and elves of insanity
Laughing all the time
Between these walls
Whispering voices
chilling noises
Deep inside my head
Medicated isolated
In a concrete cell
Look at the mirror
I am the man behind the wall
A breed of evil
I am the man behind the wall
Ask myself, is it really me
Or is it someone else
I lose control
Crawling shadows
Dance in circles
Under tungsten light
Abstract paintings twisted faces
Chaos in my mind
Am I dead or am I alive
Is this real or is it Hell
