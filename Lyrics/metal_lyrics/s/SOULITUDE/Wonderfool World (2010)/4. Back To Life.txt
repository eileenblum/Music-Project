Blinded by the sunlight
The hole was dark and cold
I feel the warmth of energy
Running through my blood
The void I left behind me
Long time has been my home
Rising from the ashes
I walked the path alone
Back to life now I'm alive
Father I know, I'm alive
Living in a prison
Black is in my mind
Unchain my soul and cry aloud
I'm here, I've come to life
Silent screams to nowhere
The echoes of the past
I promise you that never
I will never die again
