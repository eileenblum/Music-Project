From a very distant corner
Somewhere out in space
Hear the crying of a planet
Falls into disgrace
Human termites eat their mother
The womb that gave them life
Time is short, destroy all humans
Before the plague is rife
A flash of light
Thunder and fire from the sky
He's come to kill he's come to save you
End of mankind
A new beginning for new lives
He's come to heal he is the savior
From the stars
Carrying out the disinfection
Through the galaxies
Rid the Earth of the human virus
Mission to complete
