[Loren:]
The day is gone and night is here
Silent fear
Somethingâs lurking out there in the dark
This nightmare never sleeps
The campfires fade
Feel the fright as they are coming back

[Max:]
No fence can stop the wild
Some men will die
Hear the screams that shudder down my spine
Smell of human flesh
The thirst for blood
In their kingdom we are under strain

[Marco:]
The ghost and the darkness
Awakening of the beasts
The roaring terror
Weâre raw meat for the feast
Shaman, he spoke
Welcome to hell
A herd of humans
Into the jaws of death
