[Loren:]
She can be merciless, she can be sweet
She has the power to kill and to heal
Bringer of misery, giver of life
Nothing can escape to the gleam of her eyes

[Max:]
Let the wind blow and listen whispering trees
May the waves be the guardians of oceans and seas

[Marco:]
Mistress of nature
Queen of the land
Goddess of thunder
Storm wind and rain
Give us your water
Creator of life
Embrace me in your arms
The day when I die

[Loren:]
She is your master she rule your mind
Weâre just toys to play with under infinite sky
Earth mother we praise you we kneel to your might
In your honor I offer my own sacrifice
