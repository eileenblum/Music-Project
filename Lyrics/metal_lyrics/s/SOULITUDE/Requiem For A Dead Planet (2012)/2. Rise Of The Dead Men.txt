[Alain:]
Take a look around, what do you see?
Architectures of society
Swarms of people walking down the streets
No free will just puppets on a string
No thinking, no dreaming
Your future is safe in our hands
Imprisoned, your reason
We control and manipulate

[Loren:]
Rise of the dead men
Farewell the kingdom of the living
Rise of the dead men
They want you dead not alive

[Ian:]
Primal instincts rule upon their souls
Hipnotized by the spell of God
Mediaâs power feeding up your brain
Government drinks your last drop of blood

[Alain:]
No thinking, no dreaming
Your future is safe in our hands
Imprisoned, your reason
We control and manipulate

[Solo: James Stephenson]
