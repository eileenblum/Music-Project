[Alain:]
Hate inside is rising
I will never forget the day
You refused to give me a hand
And all I loved did fade away

[Loren:]
All your mercy and all your tears
Empty prayers to the wind
I will not rest I wonât give in
Until I hear you scream

[Jevo:]
Against wind and storm, through hell and high water
He sailed the skies and crossed the gate of heaven
Until the lair of God himself

[Alain:]
Thereâs no curse to stop my rage
Your sacred spellâs a harmless trick
Now my soulâs free from your chains
I will not turn the other cheek

[Loren:]
And the angels in my way
They will fall to burn in hell
Iâll show no mercy, youâre to blame
Revengeâs a dish best served in flames

[Loren:]
Now the time has come
I am in for the kill
In the lair of God
Justice shall be done
Pay with blood for your sins
In the lair of God
