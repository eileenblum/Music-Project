[Max:]
Day after day living to survive
Trying to find just a beam of light
The world is a grave of ashes
Everything is lost

[Loren:]
Wake up again in this barren land
Moving in silence to make no sound
Fear of the most depraved side
Of the human kind

[Max:]
The road is long and tiring
The road goes on and on
Weâll keep forever walking
Until we find the shore

[Loren:]
All that we knew has already gone
The end of all days is about to come
Why in the name God
We cling to a chance of life

[Solo: Felix Neumann]

[Max:]
The road is long and tiring
The road goes on and on
Weâll keep forever walking
Until we find the shore

[Max/Loren:]
The road is long and tiring
The road goes on and on
Weâll keep forever walking
Until we find the shore
