[Alain:]
The World has gone insane
But whoâs the God to blame
We are pieces in a game
And you shall obey

[Loren:]
Dictators in sheepâs clothes
So eager for your votes
They promise you the world
But saints donât exist at all

[Max:]
Pray for nothing
Say amen to all they preach
Put on your knees and kiss
The holy ring of fear

Marco:
Obey Your Master
Obey Your Master

[Solo: Carlos Alvarez]

[Alain:]
Abduction of your brain
Have faith my little ones
You follow every step
We will save your soul

[Loren:]
Under one flag we shanât be split
The same old song the same old shit
Donât swim against the flow
Remember thinkingâs not allowed

[Max:]
They rape your mind
They say the words you wanna hear
Millions of minions
So fucking blind to see
