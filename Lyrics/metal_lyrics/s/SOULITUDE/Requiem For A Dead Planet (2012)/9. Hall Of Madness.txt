[Max:]
I ask myself when did it all began
The man behind the mirror
Stares at me again
And I try to stay away from all my fears
Dreams become a nightmare
Canât wake up anymore

[Loren / Alain:]
Despair and dejection
Iâm stuck in between two trances
One step to my downfall
I stand in the hall of madness

[Ian:]
The worm inside is eating me alive
My memories my feelings
The freedom to decide
From the deepest corner somewhere in my mind
One inner voice is calling
Can only hear my cry

[Loren / Ian:]
Despair and dejection
Iâm stuck in between two trances
One step to my downfall
I stand in the hall of madness

[Solo: Marco Cudan]
