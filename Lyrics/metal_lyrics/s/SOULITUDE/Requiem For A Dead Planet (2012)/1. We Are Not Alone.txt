[Loren:]
Iâm looking for a new place to reborn
So far beyond the sun
I lost my faith in this rotten human kind
Goodbye to all my mission has begun

[Max:]
Turn all the engines on
Countdown and here we go

[Solo: Mikel Martinez]

[Loren:]
I sail the stars throughout the galaxies
To dive into the unknown
Thereâs no reason for a fight I come in peace
Another world another chance will come

[Max:]
And if I were to fail
Donât cry for me my friends

[Loren:]
Faster than the speed of light I cross the skies
Searching for a place to be my home
Somewhere in the space there must be other lives
Let me show you we are not alone
