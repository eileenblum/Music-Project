[Loren:]
One winter morning I entered the gate
Turmoil and flashes storming my head
And I reached the other side
Blinded by sunlight I opened my eyes
Moor lands and brackens in front of my sight
Where am I? This place is odd to me
This canât be real must be a joke or a nightmare
Cause now I know where I am
Out of all reason this is beyond fiction
I think that somehow I travelled in time

[Max:]
I am alone in a cage without bars
Iâm trapped in a world
Somewhere in the past
Insanity by my side Iâm just a castaway
Lost in the grandeur of time

[Loren:]
400 million years far from my home
Feeding myself of trilobites and moss
I must find the way I can return
Oxygenâs low but Iâm able to breath
Remember the future my life and my home
I must find the wormhole to my time
I pray the lord take me away from this wasteland
But heâs probably not even born
No one will ever come I feel so helpless
Must get away from this primitive world
