[performed by Spiritus Mortis]Once I was a warrior
Walked thru fire with passion and desire
Couldn't see it coming
There it lies when spark of mine dies
Thru the gate I will go
To kneel the Lord and face His sword
Will I get a place
Beside my king, beside crown an' ring
I'm coming my God
Let me sink to sweet oblivion
