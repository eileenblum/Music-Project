Ultimate in body and soul
Every cell hard as diamond
Every thought crystal clear
Unbending
Unbreakable

Untamed free and wild spirit
Fearless, obeying no one
The man of steel

Able to stand the heat of god-forsaken deserts
And the cold breezes of Nordic hells

Crushing with the embrace of sole power
Cold and strict life force
The man of steel

Forever going
Never stopping
Never surrendering
Extreme in brilliance and courage

Rise with the man of steel
Strike with the man of steel
Drink in honour of the man of steel
Hold the banner of the man of steel

March with the man of steel
Rejoice with the man of steel
Die for the man of steel
Obey every command given by the man of steel
