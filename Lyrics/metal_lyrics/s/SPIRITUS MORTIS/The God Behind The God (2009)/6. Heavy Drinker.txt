I am on the streets again
In my head a chaotic swarm
This night will be cold
Infernal liquids keep me warm

Left alone, no friends in sight
The streets are full of human scum
Don't know where I shall sleep tonight
Will tomorrow even come?

Lord have mercy on my soul
I feel sick inside
Unable to find my goal

Out of the blue, a familiar face
A bottle of nitrate in my hand
I am led to another place

Sniffing and drinking
Swallowing unknown pills
Laughing and crying
In every corner new thrills

It's seven days and seven nights
Since I was shanghaied from my home
Now I lie in someone's basement
And I do not know where to go... next!
