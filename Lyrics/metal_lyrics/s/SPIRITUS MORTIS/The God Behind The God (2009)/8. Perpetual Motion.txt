You gave yourself to me
That was not enough
I need more than anyone can ever give

I won't stay middle of the road
I will go to extremes
I want to learn what it means to "really live"

Now I purify my soul in the flames of your hatred
I offer my flesh to be burnt in your hellfire

But I will never return to the temple of your heart
I will never be captured
I set fire to out love's funeral pyre

When the new day dawns
I am gone
Here I go again
I am on the run!
