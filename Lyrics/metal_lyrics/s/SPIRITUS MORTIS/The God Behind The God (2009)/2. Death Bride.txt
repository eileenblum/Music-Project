The mortuary horses
Were galloping merrily
When taking her away
For it was not just her funeral
But also our wedding day

In the hearse
Her beautiful coffin
Our blessed nuptial bed
How sweet and delicate the bride
So lively, even when dead

I vex my heart alone
She is at rest
They buried her
With a stone on her chest

I inhale her decay
I take her into my breath
I come upon the grave
My bride in death
