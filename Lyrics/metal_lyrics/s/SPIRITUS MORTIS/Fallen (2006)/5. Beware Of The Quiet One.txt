In the evening when I go to bed
Thoughts moving in my head
When I'm trying to sleep
Still I'm full of fear
I saw it near
Evil feelings inside of me
Nightmare's my reality
Somewhere deep down inside of you
A part is controlling you, too far to reach
When the moment's right
No use to fight, he will come to you
Controlling you
Beware of the quiet one, he will take you down, down
Beware of the quiet one, he may cause the greatest sorrow
Never turn your back again
Or your time will run low
Don't let the beast come in
While you're fighting for your soul
Don't take the easiest way
You don't want to pay that toll
Beware of the quiet one, he will take you down, down
