Calm was the sea when they crossed the ancient seal
Fear is the key when you see the sword of steel
See the opened door in the mountain of your god
Going to war, steel is hungry, thirsty for blood

Farewell to this life, prepare yourself, be ready to die
Be one with your knife, shield 'n' sword hold' em high
Cutting pain in your head, all you see turns to red
Legs feel heavy like lead, last breath you are dead

the Alliance was broken
No time for token
the Alliance was broken
All the words, all the words were spoken
