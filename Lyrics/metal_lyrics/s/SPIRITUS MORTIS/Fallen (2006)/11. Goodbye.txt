Grant me the wisdom, show me the reason
Why all this was taken from me?
Did I have to fight, in the darkness or in light
Was it written in the stars
Lost in a sea, dreaming to be free
Was it too much to ask
Abandoned in my grave tho' all I gave
Alone, I will spend eternity

[chorus]
Hear the whisper in the w ind, cry in the dark
All who cared, all who feared
All my friends an enemies
I thank you and goodbye

Come, come closer, headstone filled with anger
Air's so thick you can't breath
Cruel, pale vengeance, I plea for alliance
God you failed me

[chorus]
