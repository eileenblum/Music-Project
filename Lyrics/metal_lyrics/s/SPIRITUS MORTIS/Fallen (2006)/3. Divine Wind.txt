They're coming out of the sun
Manic battles have begun
Wind falls from the sky
For the glory, they will dive

[chorus]
Burning planes fall from the sky
To the death kamikazes fly

Desperate weapon of war
They're dying for their lord
Ultimate price they shall pay
It's an honor to die this day

[chorus]
Burning planes fall from the sky
For the glory they will dive
To the death kamikazes fly
