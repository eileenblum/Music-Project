The price of our arrogance took us here
Filled us with fear
Shadows of the past tracked us down
Knocked us to the ground

Wind out of the sails we tried to fight
No hope in sight
Journey to the sky
Only a heartbeat away

Light fades away, darkness settles in
Let the journey begin

[chorus]
Leave me,
Leave me, let me die in the battlefield
Leave me,
Leave me with my sword and my shield

Let me go down to sleep
Let me meet my maker

[chorus]

Let me take the final leap
Let me cleanse my soul in fire
Let me go down to sleep
Let me meet my maker
