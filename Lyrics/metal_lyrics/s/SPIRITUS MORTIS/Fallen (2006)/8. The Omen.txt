When I return to ashes
then the comet rips the sky
and holy man of the mountain falls
then you all must die

to eternal sleep I sink now
creating sorrow on all shores
turning men against their brothers
till man exist no more

till man exist no more

when there's left no ruler
All hell will then break loose
you people cannot survive
now you all have to choose

whether you all follow me now
or you slowly die in here
fly with me beyond the stars
just take my hand, have no fear

just take my hand, have no fear

no no no
