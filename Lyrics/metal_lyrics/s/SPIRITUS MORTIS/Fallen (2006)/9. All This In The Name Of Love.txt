You killed yourself, your wife and daughters
Aged three and seven
Now you come before me
Are you reaching for heaven

[chorus]
All this in the name of love

What went through' your heard when you pulled the trigger
Emptying both barrels
Into the faces of your children
What does that tell

[chorus]

You wanna meet your maker
But you have met him, of don't you see
He has won your soul, He has won your soul
You have fallen, oh don't you see

[chorus]
