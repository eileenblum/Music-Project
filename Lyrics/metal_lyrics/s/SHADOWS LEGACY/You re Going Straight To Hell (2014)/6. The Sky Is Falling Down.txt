Out of this world of pain
My pain is valorous
A lifetime built of scares and hate
Did what is my soul
And in the night your eyes
Are watching over me
Hiding through the shadows
You are waiting for my sins

No matter how time I try
Always the night going down

The sky is falling down

When the light comes down
I know it will return
Disguised in higher wishes
To affront my soul
Thunders far away
Warning that it came
Blackened eyes observes
While I say my last pray

No matter how time I try
Always the night going down

The sky is falling down
