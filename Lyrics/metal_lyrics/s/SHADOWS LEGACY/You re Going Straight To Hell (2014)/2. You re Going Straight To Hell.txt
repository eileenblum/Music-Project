Oh, hey you, what are you looking for?
There is nothing to be found in this place
Nothing changed, nothing really changes
So don't be fool to worry about tomorrow

There's just one way for you
Don't you dare to cheat the death
This is what your fate reserved
You're going straight to hell

You try to pull, but nothing comes
From now on these things are
Happening by themselves
Turn around, see the world around you
Your time to live is already over
You're going straight to hell

This is what you call home
And there's nothing you can do
Just enjoy what waits for you
This is not a dream
You're going straight to hell
