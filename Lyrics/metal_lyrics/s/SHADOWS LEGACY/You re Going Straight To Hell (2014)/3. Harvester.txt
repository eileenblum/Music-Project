Do you hear the song
That sings about the evil on the earth?
Do you hear the song that shows
All the things that couldn't be?
Now it's time to leave behind
All the truth that you believe

Would you sing the song that speaks
About the truth inside the fear?
Would you sing the song that shows to us
How the things really are?
Don't be part of anything
That you would not believe

Blind the eyes of everyone
That refuse to see the truth

Take and don't care about
What is yours is marked with pain

More than you can accept
The truth is to the reach of your hand
More than you can believe
Freedom is not something to play
There is only way to live
With no shadow from the fear

Your fears aren't mine
Or even part of my plans
Forsake the fears and doubts
That are revealed among the lines
Find and burn all those that try
To suffocate your life

Seek the uncertain lies
In the eye of weak

No mercy for the fools
'Cause the harvester is here
