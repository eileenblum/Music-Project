I don't know how unleash all the hate within
This feeling seems that grows day by day
Reaching an explosion point
Bringing madness to the edge
It seems that will consume my whole life

I am ready and want to face every fear of mine
I need to leave and let some things behind
Maybe it's time to wake up, take what is mine
It's time to release from the chains

An uncontrollable flame growing inside me
Taking away my sanity
It is out of control, is not in my hands any more
I am living on the edge

I am ready and want to face every fear of mine
I need to leave and let some things behind
Maybe it's time to wake up, take what is mine
It's time to release from the chains

Now you shall get out of my way
You won't, you won't change my mind
You shall get out my of my way
'Cause it's not safe for you now

I am ready and want to face every fear of mine
I need to leave and let some things behind
Maybe it's time to wake up, take what is mine
It's time to release from the chains

Now you shall get out of my way
You won't, you won't change my mind
You shall get out my of my way
'Cause it's not safe for you now
