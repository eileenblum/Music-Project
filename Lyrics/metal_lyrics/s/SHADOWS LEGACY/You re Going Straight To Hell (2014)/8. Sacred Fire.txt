I see the world on fire
And all my faith is fading now
Fear the sound of hate and rage
In every whisper and breathe of the night

Feel the pain in all my tears
As the eyes are burning out
Flames and lightning everywhere
As the darkness falls on my back
Feel the eyes of the night watching me
Burning sun doesn't light my path

To the sacred fire, secret desire
The gates of fire are open up for me
See the wreckage of your life
This is what you life became
Welcome to where every soul
Agonize in the ruins of unknown

The light of hope can not resist
The fear of the unknown
The fire burns higher and higher
Purifying the sins of my soul
Sail away from fire, you will never face
You are pain right now for all the things you said
Far away from heaven, burning in desires
It's too late for regrets face the endless night
