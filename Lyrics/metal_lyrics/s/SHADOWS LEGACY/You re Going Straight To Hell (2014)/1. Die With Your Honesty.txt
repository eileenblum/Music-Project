Kill, or die honestly
Mercy is needles
Futility empire
Here nothing is priceless
Take what you can
Everything's for sale

You shall buy the pride
And consume the lies
Pay for ostentation
That devours the soul
And human's heart
Wait, we will create
Your needs and values
So we'll pervent them

You did believe
And now you think you have
Your way of think
