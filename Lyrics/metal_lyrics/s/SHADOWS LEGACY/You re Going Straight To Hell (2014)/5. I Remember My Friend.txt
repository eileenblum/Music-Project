Take a dip into the sea of memories
Take a dip in the deep of your soul
Where the memories must remain intact
Giving meaning to our certainties and our lives

Fear, pain, regret. Wounds that never heal
Looking for redemption
Shared dreams in fervor of the soul
Wasted in vain, and I wonder why

I remember, I remember my friend

A simple mirror could reflect
The good and evil entwined
As old friends together but the mirror doesn't show
Just what the heart wants to feel

If there's no reason to our lives
Why should we stay alive?
Life really doesn't show what we want to see
It seems like a destiny's joke

But nothing was in vain

I'd never give away, even on the dead of the night
I'd never give away, the blood runs in my veins
I'd never give away, I always had my beliefs

I remember, without surrender to the pains of life
I forget, without abandoning my good memories
Go away, go my friend into infinity
Maybe one day, later or not, we meet again.
