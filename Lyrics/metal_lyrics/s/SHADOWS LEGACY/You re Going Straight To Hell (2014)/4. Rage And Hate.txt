Lost in a time of darkness
You accepted and chose your fall
Held out your hand to cross the black curtain
And now you're a prisoner

You are alone in this world
Their tongue was trained to say only lies
Nothing can be as real as your last day
The end of your existence you soon will find

Crawling in the mud of your life
You didn't bother to clean your face
You're afraid of what's coming
Because you are a damned

You don't know where to go
The time has come to make the justice
And everything will be put on the table top
Just take a look around you are all alone

For the anger that you kept stored
All the hatred you felt against other
Do you think you are worthy of something promised?
Do you know where are going? You will never know

For the anger that you kept stored
All the hatred you felt against other
Do you think you are worthy of something promised?
Do you know where are going? You will never know
