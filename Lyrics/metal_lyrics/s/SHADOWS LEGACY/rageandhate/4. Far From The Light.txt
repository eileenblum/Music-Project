Far from the light, locked up inside
Looking for replies that stay
Rounding within my head
I try but nothing makes a sense

I'm a hostage of my own mind
Chained to the things that just
Don't belong to me
I just want to set me free

I never found a care inside my faith
Inside my soul
And I will not to try anymore

Will I not to see the light of day?
Will I not to find my own way to the light?

Waiting for the sun of a new day
That brings the light
And the answers to my longing
Break these shadows of my song

I never found a care inside my faith
Inside my soul
And I will not to try anymore

Will I not to see the light of day?
Will I not to find my own way to the light?

Everyone has a ghost haunting your life

I'm far away from my desires
Everything I have is inside
Now I am tired of this freak world
But the road I obey takes below
