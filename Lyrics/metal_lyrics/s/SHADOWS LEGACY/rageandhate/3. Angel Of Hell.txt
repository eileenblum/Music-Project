Behind the mask they hide the truth
That feeds their lust and greed
Behind the mask lies a wolf
That dresses a lamb skin
They wrap your thoughts
They ilude your mind
They're trying to mix your life
They sell a place beside the god
But for this they want your blood

To every blood drop in your hands
To every nail they have a poison word
Sweet words from the black tongues
Softly hiding the scalding sun

All they want is rule your mind
And now they want control your heart
Beware of what you see
Nothing is what use to be
'Cause they are the angels of hell

Inside the dark they smell their preys
Waiting for the right time
Men with souls dressed in black
Using all their crowns of brights
The evil hands are in command
You are being manipulated
The evil hands are pulling the strings
Whispering things in your ears
