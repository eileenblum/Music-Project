Through the hard times we survived
Against the storm we stayed alive
And kept the flame burning
Even under the rain or darkness
There is a truth that shall be said
A feeling that couldn't be forsaken
We're the remaining and endless power
That resurge upon the runs
The darkness hides a secret for the fools
Inside our hearts lives a might that strengthen us

We are the legacy of metal
So we are here for what we believe
We are the reason of liberty
Like a child's hands that fight
To survive with her dreams

In every cold dawn of our lives
A fervent feeling burns like a fire
Behind the eyes that don't pretend
Lies the legacy of time
The darkness hides a secret for the fools
Inside our hearts lives a might that strengthen us
We are the legacy of metal
