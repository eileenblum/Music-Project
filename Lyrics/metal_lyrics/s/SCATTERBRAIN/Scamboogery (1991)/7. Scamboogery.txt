Scamboogery, Scamboogery-Watch out!
Watch out, don't look now; 
Here it comes and don't ask how.
Scamboogery-Look out!

Scamboogery can get you anytime or where,
It's around, it abounds, you better best beware.
Bad luck; It's coming for you
There ain't nothing much about it that you can do

You ain't safe at home, or one the street,
You ain't safe at home, or one the street-
Odds stacked against you, tough odds to beat.
Knock-Knock; What's behind the door?
Not the Avon Lady, now that's for sure.
Damn right-better watch your back,
Scamboogery Attack and that's the fact jack.

Here it comes, too late to duck.
Here it comes, too late to duck-
Ain't nothing gonna give you luck.
You could knock on wood, it won't do no good.
Forget your wishbone, horseshoe, four-leaf clover,
Gone goodbye, good luck-It's over! It's gone baby!

Bamboozled-Scamboozled...
Scamboogery gonna get ya, 
Scamboogery-Watch out!
Watch out, don't look now; 
Here it comes but don't ask how. 
Here it comes baby
Scamboogery-Look out!

It's a force you can't dismiss,
It's a force you can't dismiss-
If it happens to you it might go like this;
Wake up, trip over Fred.
Fred was your dog...Fred is dead.
Step over Fred on a piece of crack-
Papa calls, says: "Mama broke her back!"

That's just the start...
Scamboogery-You're gonna get your fill,
Gonna get yourself a one way ticket to Palookaville.

Emboogered-Scamboogered....
Scamboogery, Scamboogery-Watch out!
Watch out, don't look now; 
Here it comes but don't ask how.
Scamboogery-Look out!
