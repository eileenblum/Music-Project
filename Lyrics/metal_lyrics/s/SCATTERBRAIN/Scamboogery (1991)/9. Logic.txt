Stop, look, listen, learn; your lessons have begun.
O.K. school's in session-lesson #1,
Inductive, deductive reasoning and thought.
It's called logic, are you ready to be taught?

It won't take long, you can't go wrong.
Use it and you're always right,
And don't forget that right is might
Shall we move along?

If a is b, and b is c, then a is c. See?
It's really easy, here we go,
For example, here's some samples; we'll start slow:
&gt;From war comes peace-Peace is good.
Therefore war is good.
Let's try another;
Johnny blew his head off-Johnny listened to metal.
Therefore metal killed Johnny.
That's logical, it's settled.

Take it from me, now here's the key;
Shape the truth to fit your ends,
Take the facts then twist and bend to your morality.

Twist it-logic; You can justify anything you want.
Twist it-logic; You can justify anything at all.

Stop, look, listen, learn; isn't logic fun?
O.K. one more thing, memorize this one;
You're always right-They disagree.
Therefor they are wrong. See?

It works for them, it works for me,
Can work for you I guarantee.
Easy as a, b, d or 1 and 1 is 3.
Makes a lot of sense to me,
Solve any problems that you see-Got it? Good!

Shape the truth to fit you ends,
Take the facts, then twist and bend.
Use it and your always right,
And don't forget that right is might-It works
I guarantee!

Twist it-logic; You can justify anything you want.
Twist it-logic; You can justify anything at all.
Twist it-logic; You can justify anything at,
You can justify anything at,
You can justify anything at all
