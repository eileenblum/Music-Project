My girl's all a man could want
There ain't no doubt about her
I got a girl and yes indeed-
She's got everything I need.
You know I tried the rest
And then I built the best.
I built myself a fine machine-
She does more than cook and clean.
I know you'd be impressed with my baby, my lady
My Swiss Army Girl.

I'm a scientific genius and here's my story,
It all came together in my laboratory.
I couldn't find a dream girl to become my wife,
Then I got this idea from my pocket knife.
Now you can call me crazy, Dr. Frankenstien,
But I built myself a girl and she's mine all mine.

She's my baby, she's quite a lady
She's my Swiss Army Girl.
She's my baby, my handy-dandy lady
She's my Swiss Army Girl.

Full of motors, tools, appliances, yeah, I'm no fool,
Great in bed or around the house-a handy tool.
Got 1,001 uses to suit my needs,
She canges into many things with lightning speed.
Now you can call me crazy, Dr. Frankenstien,
But I built myself a girl and she's mine all mine.

My girl's all a man could wish-
She can even scale a fish.
Becomes a wrench, a drill or saw-a Soloflex 
And so much more.
You know I tried the rest, and then I built the best.
Swiss Army Girl for me not you-YODEL-ODEL-A-HEE-HOO!

She's my baby, she's quite a lady
She's my Swiss Army Girl.
She's my baby, my handy-dandy lady
She's my Swiss Army Girl.
