Once upon a time I used to be alive,
I lived and loved, I laughed and cried.
But I've forgotten how 
'Cause that was then and this is now
I'm down so low, the cold rain and snow,
Has battered my body, shattered my soul

Beat up, broke down, so low.
Beat down, broke up, down so low

I've seen how man treats fellow man 
And I just don't understand
I don't care if the meek inherit the earth,
You keep my piece for what it's worth

It's a fine line between living and being alive
It's a fine line between living and being alive
It's a fine line when you're;
Sleeping on the street in the city that never sleeps
Sleeping on the street in the city that never sleeps

The street has made me numb, I pray my time to come,
I'll be here I'm not hard to find,
God hear my prayers, for once be kind.
Let it come I am not afraid
I'm ready now I don't despair, where, when, now I
really don't care

It's a fine line between living and being alive
It's a fine line between living and being alive
It's a fine line when you're;
Sleeping on the street in the city that never sleeps
Living on, dying on,
Sleeping on the street in the city that never sleeps
Living, dying on the street.

Beat up, broke down, so low.
Beat down, broke up, down so low

It's a fine line between living and being alive
It's a fine line between living and being alive
It's a fine line when you're;
Sleeping on the street in the city that never sleeps
Living on, dying on,
Sleeping on the street in the city that never sleeps
Sleeping, living, dying on the street-city that never
sleeps.
City that never sleeps

Fine Line. It's a fine line
It's a fine line, it's a very fine line, it's a fine
line
