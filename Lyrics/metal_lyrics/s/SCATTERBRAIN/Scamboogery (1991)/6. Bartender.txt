Hey everybody can I have your attention?
I wanna tell you about the world's most noble
profession.
Always there for you, on that you can depend,
I'm talking about man's best friend.
Serving us is how he thrives, touches all our lives.

Tried and true, always there for you.
Yeah, there for me and there you you too.
He's never far, all around the world no matter where
you are.
No matter where you are;
Cures my ills just like a doctor,
He's my friend, he's my bartender

Bartender, Bartender-
For all the things you do and just being you,
Say-Hey Bartender this song's for you!
Bartender, Bartender, my friend.

Tried and true, always there for you.
Yeah, there for me and there you you too.
He's never far, all around the world 
No matter where you are.
No matter where you are;
Cures my ills just like a doctor,
He's my friend, he's my bartender

Bartender, Bartender-
Come on down here, let me get a beer my friend...
Everybody grab a drink and raise it high,
and toast the bartenders of the whole world wide,
And to your favorite bartender in your hometown,
Everybody raise your glass and drink it down.
Now rain or snow nor dark of night,
Is gonna keep him from serving you-ya got that? Right!
Alright, yeah!

He's a giant of a man, the king of kings,
Oh yeah he knows a lot about a lot of things.
It's more than drinks, he does a whole lot more;
Gives advice, knows jokes and all the scores.
Serving us is how he thrives, touches all our lives.

Tried and true, always there for you.
Yeah, there for me and there you you too.
He's never far, all around the world 
No matter where you are.
No matter where you are;
Cures my ills just like a doctor,
He's my friend, he's my bartender

Bartender, Bartender-
For all the things you do and just being you,
Say-Hey Bartender this song's for you!
Bartender, Bartender, my friend-
Oh yeah, that's right!

This song is over, it's at its end,
This has been a tribute to man's best friend...
Bartender...Bartender...Bartender...
Bartender...Barkeep!!!
