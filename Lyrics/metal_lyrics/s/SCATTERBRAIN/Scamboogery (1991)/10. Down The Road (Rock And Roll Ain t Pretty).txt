Down in the dumps and feeling blue,
Sitting home got nothing to do.
Help me-Just get me....
Down the road, down the road, that's where it's best.

Homesick for the road again, homesick, it's our friend
When we're on tour we're at our best,
Anywhere; North, South, East or West.
We get the call, I get my wish,
I'll pack my bags, you get my mail and feed my fish.

We're down the road, down the road
That's where we're best.
No worries there, no mess, no fuss.
Take me anywhere, but get me on that bus!
We're down the road, on a quest, down the road,
That's where we're best.

A band possessed, we're always ready to strike.
We like what we do, we do whatever we like.
Just give us beer, liquor, money, chicks and a stage.
Oh-Tay, time to rage-onstage, backstage
The bus or hotel
'Round and 'Round with Scatterbrain
The Carousel From Hell!
All-aboard; Check your morals at the door.
Acts against nature, acts against god.
Acts of sheer stupidity, we hit it hard.
Every night-it's not a pretty sight.

We're always ready to go off-a loaded gun.
Rock 'n' Roll ain't pretty, but it sure is fun.
In town after town, night after night,
We're having fun with our friends, the fun never ends.

We're down the road, down the road
That's where we're best.
No worries there, no mess, no fuss.
Take me anywhere, but get me on that bus!
We're down the road, on a quest, down the road,
That's where we're best.

On a quest for excitement, for a thrill,
Coming to your town-moving in for the kill.
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, more, more, more.
We're just like little kids in a candy store.
Gut us going, we just can't stop,
Just like a crazy bull loose in a china shop.
Acts against nature, acts against god
Acts of sheer stupidity, we hit it hard.

Let's go! No worries there, no mess, no fuss.
Take me anywhere, but get me on that bus!
We're down the road, I said down the road,
There ain't no worries there
There ain't no mess, no fuss.
Take me anywhere, but get me on that bus!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust;
Dead or alive-down the road or bust!

We're always ready to go off-a loaded gun.
Rock 'n' Roll ain't pretty, but it sure is fun.
In town after town, night after night,
We're having fun with our friends, the fun never ends.

Here comes trouble and it looks like fun,
Everyone's invited, everybody-everyone.
In town after town, night after night,
We're having fun with our friends, the fun never ends.
