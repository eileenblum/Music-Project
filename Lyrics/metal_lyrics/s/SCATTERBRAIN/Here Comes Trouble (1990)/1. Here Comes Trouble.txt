Oh no, here I go...
If I go here or I go there or anywhere,
It follows me or meets me there - it's in the air
Here comes trouble
What did I do now, how did I get where I am?
Well where am I? That's what I say a lot of days
When I wake up and see that I ain't home.
Here comes trouble
What did you do? Pounding head, broken bones
Soaked in blood, feeling dead.
What did I do - did I die? - Not a clue, what did I
do?
I don't look for trouble, trouble looks for me -
It finds me every time
Here comes trouble
It finds me every time, it finds me all the time.

Here comes trouble - yeah trouble again 
Trouble is my shadow, trouble is my best friend.
Here comes trouble - yeah trouble again
Trouble is right behind me - now on that I can depend.
Trouble is in the air, trouble is everywhere
Here it comes - Trouble again

S.T.D. - D.W.I. - I.V. - O.D. - Oh my, Oh my...
I wake up dead in a strange bed
Or on the street or prison floor - done it all before.
Here comes trouble

I've lost control - I smashed up cars
I trashed some bars,
I broke some bones, I spilled a lot of blood.
Here comes trouble
I've lost all sense of right and wrong
I lost my mind.

Here comes trouble - yeah trouble again 
Trouble is my shadow, trouble is my best friend.
Here comes trouble - yeah trouble again
Trouble is right behind me - now on that I can depend.
Trouble is in the air, trouble is everywhere
Here it comes - Trouble again

T - is for my time in jail
R - rot gut
O - overdose
U - an ugly life
B - forgot what that's for...oh yeah - blackouts
L - liver damage
E - is for elegance - well at least I ain't got that.
