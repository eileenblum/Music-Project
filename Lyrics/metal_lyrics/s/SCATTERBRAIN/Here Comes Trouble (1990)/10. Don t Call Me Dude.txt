Here's my story, sad but true
About a girl that I once knew.
She broke my heart, I became unglued,
It all started when she called me dude

Well today I leave the psycho ward
Cause my sentence did conclude:
I had killed a man with my bare hands
Because he called me dude

The jury said that I was insane.
Temporally insane - brain strain.
But now the doctors say I'm A.O.K.
So I start my new life today.

This story starts some years ago
As I vacationed by the sea.
In the California sunshine
Just me &amp; my baby.

I was in love feeling sky high
When a big blonde lifeguard walked by.
He looked at her, she looked at him -
I knew it was good bye.

He took her by the hand, kicked sand in my face.
She looked &amp; laughed &amp; said, "Later Dude!"
They were gone without a trace
And the waves echoed her laughter
And her words...Yo Later Dude.

Later that night I was in such a bad mood
Sittin' in a bar drinkin' hard, getting stewed
Thinkin' 'bout that girl &amp; how 'bout I'd been screwed
When some guy walks in sits next to me &amp; says
What's up dude!

I heard the word dude &amp; I became unglued.
Slowly I turned, step by step, inch by inch
And put my hands around his neck, and I squeezed...

Don't call me dude!

So that's how I got where I am
But this ain't where it ends.
The doctors said they cured me
I said good bye to my crazy friends.

I was smiling as I left that place
My life had been renewed.
The guard at the gate, he stamped my pass
And he said, "Yo Later Dude!"

Slowly I turned...
