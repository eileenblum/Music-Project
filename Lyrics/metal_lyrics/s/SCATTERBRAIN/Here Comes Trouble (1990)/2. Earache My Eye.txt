My mama's talkin' to me
She tells me how to live,
But I don't listen to her
'Cause my head is like a sieve.

My daddy he disowned me
'Cause I wear my sisters clothes,
He caught me in the bathroom
With a pair of pantyhose.

The basketball coach
Done kicked me off the team
For wearing hi-heel sneakers
And acting like a queen.

The world's coming to an end
And I don't even care,
As long as I can have my limo
And my long blonde hair.

And it don't bother me
If people think I'm funny,
'Cause I'm a big rock star
And I make a lot of money!

I'm so bloody rich,
I own apartment buildings,
Shopping centers, condominiums
And I only know three chords!
You fools - watch me now.
