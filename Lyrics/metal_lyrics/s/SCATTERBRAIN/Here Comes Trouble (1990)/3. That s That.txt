Color by numbers, stay inside the lines
Ya got a question? Check the rulebook
See the grand design -
See the world, wow! It's black &amp; white,
Where rules are rules, and wrong is wrong
And right is right - That's right

Hey kids check it out,
Upside down or inside out,
This is it, it's what it's all about
Strike one, strike two, strike three you're out

It's seconds, minutes, hours, daze inside a maze,
Ya keep your feet upon the yellow bricks
You got it made
'Cause every piece of the puzzle fits the master plan,
In this pre-fabricated, formulated land.
It's every piece in it's place.
Red light, green light, Simon sez
Take a tiny step forward and ask again.

Nothing left to chance, this ain't no lottery
Play it safe, keep it simple - A, B, C - 1, 2, 3
That's good, but this is bad
Smile when you're happy, cry when you're sad

Hey kids check it out,
Upside down or inside out,
This is it, it's what it's all about
Strike one, strike two, strike three you're out
Check it out, see hear what it's all about

It's seconds, minutes, hours, daze inside a maze,
Ya keep your feet upon the yellow bricks
You got it made
'Cause every piece of the puzzle fits the master plan,
In this pre-fabricated, formulated land.
It's every piece in it's place.
Red light, green light, Simon sez
Take a tiny step forward and ask again.

Everybody this is this and I said that is that
See hear everybody this is where it's at - That's
that.

Hey kids check it out,
Upside down or inside out,
This is it, it's what it's all about
Strike one, strike two, strike three you're out
Check it out, see hear what it's all about
This is this &amp; that's that, check it out.
