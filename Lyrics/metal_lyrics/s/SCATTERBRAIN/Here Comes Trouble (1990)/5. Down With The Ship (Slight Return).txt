Sailing on a big ship
Deaf, dumb, blind
Sailing through a wild one
To the other side

I'm not going down with the ship

Everyone's captain
Trying to tell you what to do
I want to do what's right for me
For me - not you

I'm not going down with the ship

The ship is going down fast
But I won't be around
I'm jumping in a lifeboat
And heading for dry ground

I'm not going down with the ship
