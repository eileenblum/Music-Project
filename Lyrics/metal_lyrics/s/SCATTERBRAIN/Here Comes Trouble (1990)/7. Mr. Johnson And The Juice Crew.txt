Here is a tribute to my best friend,
Hung with me since the beginning
And he'll be there to the end.
Talkin' Mr. Johnson and the Juice Crew.

I love Mr. Johnson and the Juice Crew too,
And all the girls that meet him, they love him too.
'Cause he's the baddest of the bad,
Hardest of the hard,
Mr. Johnson is a giant, dare I call him God?
Juice Crew - Dept. of Energy,
The power Mr. Johnson, Johnson powers me.
And all the girls keep knockin' - knockin' on my door,
All those Johnson junkies want more and more.
So hail Mr. Johnson and his two friends, too,
Mr. Johnson super hero, Johnson and the Juice Crew.

Johnson's hypnotizing and Johnson's mesmerizing...
Johnson keeps me vital, Johnson keeps me strong
Just like Samson had the power when his hair was long.
Everybody needs a source of power,
A hammer works for Thor but I got Johnson power, 
Every minute every hour.
So darn cute a big hood with one eye,
Girls can't keep their hands off of him 
And neither can I.
Talkin' Mr. Johnson and the Juice Crew.
