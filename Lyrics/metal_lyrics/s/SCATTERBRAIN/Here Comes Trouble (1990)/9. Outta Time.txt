I can still remember the first time you tried it,
Just like yesterday
High as a kite, yeah you tried it and you liked it,
Problems went away.
I watched as you turned the outside in 
And took off with the night,
Without a care in the world you never felt so right -
Quite alright

So you started buyin' hope, you needed it to cope.
Went on the streets and copped your hope,
You handed me the rope.
How could good be bad? Felt like you never had.
How could something good be bad?
That question drove ya mad.

It made you smile every once-in-a-while,
Well it made me smile too.
Runnin' for your life - Keep on runnin' boy
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide - you can't hide
You just ran outta time.

I can still remember the first time 
You rode the mainline,
Just like yesterday.
You sit down on the hook and I saw that look,
I knew it was my lucky day.
Out of sight, you felt the sting 
And it was love at first bite,
Love &amp; marriage happened all in one night.

Shit happened much too fast,
The honeymoon it didn't last.

You wanted more - I wanted you
You needed more - I needed you.
You lost your friends, you lost your girl,
You lost it all, you had what you needed cause
Love, friends and family didn't really matter to you,
Not to you anymore.

You lived in hell, you called it home
It was a living hell...
Home sweet home
Runnin' for your life - keep on runnin' boy
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide - you can't hide.
You just ran outta time.

I can still remember the day that I took you,
Just like yesterday.
You did too much of something that was much too good,
Started slipping away.
I made my move, it was so easy cause you were so weak,
I just kicked down the door I didn't have to sneak.
Job well done, 'cause usually 18 year olds are tough,
But you did half my job for me &amp; that was enough.
