[Nieder / Christ]

I go out, I have a beer to start the night
I have some more, I feel alright!
Hey Bartender, double whiskey here we go
Yo make that a triple I can't say no

Feeling good and getting happy
I just got to smile
A real good mood and I'm one cool dude
'Cause I got cat class and style

Yeah move out to the floor
I gotta dance and sing
Baby I'm the king
I've feeling smarter, quicker, stronger
Feelin' oh so fine
Back up to the bar where the world id mine

Ta-ta-tequila, see that girl I got to feel her
All the girls in here want me
And I intimidate the guys
They're scared of me

Check it out - I might look like flabby 
Little girlie man but I work out
1 lift, 2 drink:Beer Muscles!
Live and drink and keep it up:Beer Muscles!
List your liquor drink it down
You've got to learn
Pump those beer muscles baby - feel the burn

Beer - Beer - Beer Muscles!  
Beer - Beer - Beer Muscles!

I'm all pumped up and my work - out's done
Back into the crowd I'm gonna have some fun
Moving' - groovin', like a Cadillac I cruise
I'm gonna get myself a woman
Anyone I choose

Hey Babe! Hey Babe! I know what you like
Come on, let's go:Whatcha mean no!
Are you some kind of dyke?
Ooooow! She hit me in the head!
Ooooow! She hit me in the head again!

I got up off the floor
I said you want some more?
I was ready to beat everybody
They were lucky that the bouncers
Threw me out of the door.

Check it out - I might look like flabby 
little girlie man but I work out
1 lift, 2 drink:Beer Muscles!
Live and drink and keep it up:Beer Muscles!
List your liquor drink it down
You've got to learn
Pump those beer muscles baby - feel the burn

Beer - Beer - Beer Muscles!  
Beer - Beer - Beer Muscles!
