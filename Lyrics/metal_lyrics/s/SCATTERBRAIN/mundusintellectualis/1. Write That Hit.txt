[Nieder / Christ]

That is it, you need a hit
Radio friendly and kind of trendy
Think video
That's the way to go

You've got to push that product and pray for luck
Write a good clean song and don't say 'fuck'
That's what you've got to do
You gotta write that hit, gotta write that hit
Airplay, everyday
"Do you think that this song is it?"

Keep it heavy or maybe not
Try it simple or complicated 
Danceable or kind of pop
No not too pop! How about Hip-Hop?
Or a metal thing, maybe a funky swing
Or try alternative or something in between

You've got to push that product and pray for luck
Write a good clean song and don't say 'fuck'
That's what you've got to do
You gotta write that hit, gotta write that hit
Airplay, everyday
"Do you think that this song is it?"

"Oh baby I love you got to hold you 
I got a nine, doin' crime and I rhyme
Dance, shake your body
Dance! Dance! Dance!
Rock 'n' Roll tonight!!!

You've got to push that product and pray for luck
Write a good clean song and don't say 'fuck'
That's what you've got to do
You gotta write that hit, gotta write that hit
Airplay, everyday
"Do you think that this song is it?"
Doubt it

"How about a ballad ?"
