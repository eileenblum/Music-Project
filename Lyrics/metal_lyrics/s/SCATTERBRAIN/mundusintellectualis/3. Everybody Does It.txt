[Nieder / Christ]

Say hello, say good-bye
It's time to go to live or die
Left - right - left, now you're doing fine
Step right up and join the line
It's your lucky day, hip - hip hurray!
Just leave your brain and walk this way

Everybody does it - Everybody does it!
Everybody march! Everybody does it! Everybody march! 
Left - right - left,  you're doing fine
Take yourself a number
Step right up and join the line
Pick your bridge - Pick your bridge
Pick your bridge and go
Wait look out below!
You better look before you leap
If everybody does it
You better look before you leap

Jump, don't jump, it's up to you
But don't look down, the joke's on you
It's the big - big show where anything goes
But the emperor he has no clothes
No - no clothes but you can try
Keep flapping those arms but you can't fly

Everybody does it - Everybody does it!
Everybody march! Everybody does it! Everybody march! 
Left - right - left, you're doing fine
Take yourself a number
Step right up and join the line
Pick your bridge - Pick your bridge
Pick your bridge and go
Wait look out below!
You better look before you leap
If everybody does it
You better look before you leap

Here lies Tim, jumped off a bridge and he is dead
He jumped to swim right off that bridge but he died
instead
He never thought, he only jumped because others did
He couldn't swim so here lies Tim, a stupid kid

That's what it is, that's what it was
No nothing changes - never does
Are you gonna go? It's yes or no
So say good-bye, say hello
The end is here, fork in the road
Make your choice
We'll see you next episode

Everybody does it - Everybody does it!
Everybody march! Everybody does it! Everybody march! 
Left - right - left, you're doing fine
Take yourself a number
Step right up and join the line
Pick your bridge - Pick your bridge
Pick your bridge and go
Wait look out below!
You better look before you leap
If everybody does it
You better look before you leap
