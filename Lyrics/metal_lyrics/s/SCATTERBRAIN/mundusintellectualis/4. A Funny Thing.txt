[Nieder / Christ]

Two people, great for each other, meet by mistake
Now you tell me is that coincidence?
You've got two others, great for each other,
They've never met and never will
Is that coincidence or fate fulfilled?

Is this a part of a master plan
Or are we on our own? I don't understand 
It's a funny thing the way it works
A funny thing the way it don't
It's a funny thing and so it goes on and on and on
A funny thing I don't understand

A guy's driving, think about nothing
A sunny day, a truck runs a light
And he ain't going home tonight
If he'd have left 10 seconds later
Would he still be dead?
Or do you think he might have lived
100 years instead?

Are there only accidents or none at all?
Do we walk around in roulette wheels or crystal balls?

It's a funny thing the way it works
A funny thing the way it don't
It's a funny thing and so it goes on and on and on
A funny thing I don't understand

Is this a part of a master plan
Or are we on our own? I don't understand 
How do you think we wind up
With these cards in our hands?
Is it the right place - right time
Wrong place - wrong time?
Which place - which time?
If you think about it too much
You'll go out of your mind
It's a funny thing!

If only this, if only that
Does it matter if we could've should've done that?
It's a funny thing, I don't understand
It's a funny thing and so it goes on and on and on
A funny thing, I don't understand!
