Murky waters live in my eyes
Within my restless nights
Begging the spring rain to fall
Escape these murky waters
Make you remove this blinding pain
And my cliffhigh prison
This is the growing vision
Murky waters

Waves of my crippled heart
That rests beneath, dead and dark

But nothing will ever remove this certain pain
Nothing will ever softened me
Make the spring rain fall Blend these murky waters

Murky waters live in my eyes
Within my restless nights
Begging the spring rain to fall
Escape these murky waters
Make you remove this blinding pain
And my cliffhigh prison
This is the growing vision
Murky waters

(Please) Calm my cries
(Please) Call my name
