And the warm wind caressed me deeply
Gently touched my soul
Made me forget all dark thoughts
Sadness on its way
Sorrow nevermore to stay

I'm the mare in my dreams
I'm the scarred wrist I fear
I'm another life that will fade
Shadows of my haunted soul
The pain that will not end

Come take it all, burn it away
Let the sunshine in again
Stop the loneliness - make it sane
Twist the broken mirror into one
Make me believe the pain has gone
