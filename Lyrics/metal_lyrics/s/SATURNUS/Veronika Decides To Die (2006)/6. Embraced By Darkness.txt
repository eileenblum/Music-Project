In this black cold night
Make me calm
Stop the blood running from my eyes
In my mind
From the places in my mind

When the darkness embraces me
I do not feel alone
When the darkness embraces me
I know I'm going home

In this black cold night
Chase the pain from within my heart
Wipe the blood from my eyes
From the places in my mind

When the darkness embraces me
I do not feel alone
When the sorrow takes me
I'm embracing the darkness alone
Please - take me home

I'm the snake in my own so called paradise
Embracing myself with darkness
My demise

In this black cold night
Make me calm
Stop the blood running from my eyes
In my mind
From the pain within my mind
