As I stand here in the dead of night
I am embraced by a soft purple light
It is not a christian light but deep and soft
like dark wisdom to the fool
but beware!!!
Like wisdom details come with tim
and everything appears so fine
it is no damnation burning up your eyes
where you see god and nothing else
but a soft light
soft like a wise womans cloak

Dark
Deep
Purple
Blue

Drped and flecked with silver tears
I see the lovely temple without fears...
Waiting in eternity
