Look towards the forest
and meet your insignificance
feel the warmth of the ancient fires
look towards the forest

There won't be no tonight
the world dies with her
There won't be no tonight
she's long gone

" Love is dead and thou art free
she doth live but dead to thee "*

Look towards the raven
as he flies away in the dark
look towards the night
that took your love away

There won't be no tonight
the world dies with her
There won't be no tonight
she's gone forever

" Love is dead and thou art free
she doth live but dead to thee "*

[*Robert Deveraux, Earl of Essex]
