A sea of hope - a sky of flame
I cry out your name but you're only a dream
a hope to die - always this endless pain
with an endless sigh - so endless sad
so break my urse - let my heart forget
end this dirge - these endless regrets
Lost my way - blackened faith
Lost my love - heart went astray - blackened faith
Lost my love - myself to blame
Lost my way - blackened faith
lost my love - gaining pain
blackened faith - this vacant heart
love astray - and hearts do fall apart

The sun is et and masked night
vailes heavens fayer eyes
what trust is there to a light
that so swift yes
- Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester
