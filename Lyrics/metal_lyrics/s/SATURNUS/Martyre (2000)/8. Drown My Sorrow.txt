I fall back into pain
with your empty kiss
beneath this rain
You're still the one I miss

Drown my sorrow
in the coulors of you aura
embalm me with your innocence

and save my soul
the fire burns
but why am I still so cold

I fall back into pain
with your empty kiss
beneath this rain
I couldn't care less
