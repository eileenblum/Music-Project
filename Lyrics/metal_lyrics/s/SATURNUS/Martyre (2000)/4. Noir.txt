Tears to fill the despair
dreams to hunt forever
so fill up my cup with emptiness again
and chase those blackenened dreams on
more time

Nevertheless I'm gone

The drone of snow
as i breathe every second of your nearness
so fill my cup with despair again
and dream those blackened dream one
more time

Nevertheless I'm gone

Help me change
change the pain
my sadness never sleeps
I walk the lonely mile
should I forget your face?
and cast away my dreams?
should I walk away?
would I walk forever?

Nevertheless I'm gone
