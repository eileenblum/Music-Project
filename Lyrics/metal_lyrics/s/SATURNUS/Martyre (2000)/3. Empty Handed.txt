She's the wind that shatters
neverending tears
She's the pain within thy heart
Nothingness as I fall

And I'm falling behind empty handed
behind these eyes inflamed
inflamed by darkeness
And empty smiles

She's the tempter of the night
the wildstare in my eye
she's the lie i live by
the shadow in my eyes

And I'm falling god abandoned
Empty handen
with a smile upon my face
And the happiness erased
