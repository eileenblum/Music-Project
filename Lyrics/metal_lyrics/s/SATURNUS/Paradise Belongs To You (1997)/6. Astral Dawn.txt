Reality must sleep, for a while.
As I travel beyond our language.
Our personalities are manifestation of spirit.
The stream of eternal life carry us on to the end.
We are rushing oh so fast... worship not.
Observation is creation, creation is reality.
Astral dawn. I shall see the faun
The atheist shall mourn for ever.
The morning is my consciousness.
The world is my eyes.
The world is the lives, of all that lives.
Mankind dies as I close my eyes.
Live and seek your destiny.
Seek the gate within your self,
more I shall not say.
Beware of evil, it has many forms, for it is not one.
Before my silence was past.
Let it now return.
