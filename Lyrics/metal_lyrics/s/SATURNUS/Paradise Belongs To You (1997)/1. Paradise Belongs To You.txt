Find your wasteland sharp and cold
beyond the doors of fear and love.
Seek the rose - her tiny leaves - climbing up the walls.
Even her life is taken by winter's night.
When he breathe upon her neck.
Look at her, as she smiles of death -
her body grabbed by icy hands,
any thorn is overruled by night.
For he crawls into the hearts of all.
The eye of the moon is glowing, though...
she is silent, at distance - lonely wolf is howling.
Then... everything is silent.
The cold is sneaking up upon us all.
The sun is gone, like a lonely man...
Now the angels start to fall.
Bloodstained walls - time is melting
Curtains torn apart.
Dark winds leap across the mountains
death is, when life turns into art.
Human
God
Sleeping heart
Know thyself - the beast you are,
Oh yes, feel, run into your arms.
Paradise belongs to you.
