I dream of this candlelight
My pain floats away, just one second
And my thoughts wandering off
To a better brighter place

A place I can rest my mind
I should summon sunlight
I should sleep peacefully 

I'm freezingly walking back
To the shadows from which I came
And the silence screamingly speaking to me
Uncovered, unwise, unspoken
One freezing mind of me
I fade away - suffocating 

A place I could rest my mind
I could summon sunlight
I could sleep peacefully in

Lit a candlelight for me.
