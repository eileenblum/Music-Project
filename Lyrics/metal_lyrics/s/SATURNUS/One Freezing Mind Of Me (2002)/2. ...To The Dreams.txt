And the warm wind caressed me deeply
Gently touched my soul
Made me forget all dark thoughts
Sadness on it's way
Sorrow nevermore to stay

I am the mare in my dreams
I am the scarred wrist I fear
I am another life that will fade
Shadows of my haunted soul
The pain that won't end

Come take it all, burn it away
Let the sunshine in again
Stop the loneliness - make it sane
Twist the broken mirror into one
Make me believe the pain has gone
