My red swollen eyes
Reflecting the trail of fears
From all my lonely nights
My angry lies
My hush - goodbye
Understand I am one - alone
Understand I am none - shown
Understand my grief
My stenched soul
My broken hopes
My red swollen eyes
Reflecting the trail of fears
From all my lonely nights
My angry lies
My night
My goodbye
