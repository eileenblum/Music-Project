Forgotten memories resurrected in dreamlike scenarios.
My fate laughs at me trying to get me to understand.
That its reach is out of my hands.

Under the arms of the Mourning Sun
I embrace my fate, my death, my destiny
One moment of despair

Under the arms of the Mourning Sun,
I embrace my fate.
My fate, my death, my destiny,
One moment of despair.

Cold nightmares haunt my heart.
Reflections from the past.
Creeping feelings that never wanted to die.
Why can't I just forget... everything?..

Blind surroundings,
Who do not understand what hides under the surface?
Distrusting fools.
However it still makes no difference.
My world will always look like this.

Under the arms of the Mourning Sun
I embrace my fate, my death, my destiny
One moment of despair

Under the arms of the Mourning Sun
I embrace my fate, my death, my destiny
One moment of despair

Cold nightmares haunt my heart
Reflections from the past
Creeping feelings that never wanted to die
Why can't I just forget... everything?..

Memories resurrected,
Memories that stabs in my heart.
However it is time to say goodbye.
Goodbye.
It is time to say goodbye.
