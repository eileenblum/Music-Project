Stare... into the night...
As a winter turns bright...
Falling leaves...
Divided for a treasures deed...
Looking... Only too dawn...
For a pale night`s gone...
Silently braced...
Towards death`s all grace...

Inside the forest of insomnia...
The dystopian nightmare shall end...

Stars... lights the road...
To our destiny`s code
Quietly proceed...
To the shadows of my path...
Shallow... cliffs of conscience...
Arising from hell...
The abyss...
Awaits our call to begin the sleep...

Inside the forest of insomnia...
The dystopian nightmare shall end...

Asleep... In the fores of insomnia...
Never to awake...
Falling down...
Along the rocks of death...
Cursed... By the one...
And not the heavenly son...
Broken down...
Inside me I am now dead...

Inside the forest of insomnia...
The dystopian nightmare shall end...
