The night sky is ever still as silence descends
The four winds becoming one caressing my naked body
And as you watch the branches bend revealing all of you

Long lost but never forgotten

Will you meet me at the lake where the water calms my fear?
Will you once more fall in love and lighten me your flame?
Come to me once more and I shall know peace

The shattered path before my heavy feet
Leading me inward to this broken temple
This temple of love, lust and creation
Resting here whilst heeding the call

We now lay under the moonlit sky in the shadows of the past
And as we become one the stars kneel down
Whispering poetry of this withering moment

The falling leaves
Weaving a blanket
Underneath it the innermost truth
Feeding the sands of time
Stilling it's hunger
While we quench our thirst

Taking our place among forever
Remembered only by two

Now closing our eyes to see changing our hearts to feel
Sealing our lips to hear, to hear the call
The call of the raven moon laying us to rest

Your skin like silver in the night
Your face like a poem without words
Your touch was the sun in my heart
And my heart was found by you

And as the worlds begins to wake
So falls the last petal
And at all things end
We must go our separate ways
Into the night
Always alone
Because I couldn't save you
And for that, I am sorry
And always will be...
