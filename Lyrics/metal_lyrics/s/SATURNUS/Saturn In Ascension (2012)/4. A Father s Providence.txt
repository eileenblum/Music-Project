All the things I did wrong
I pray for a father to forgive
For this providence I long
Will I reach out forever?

Behold the golden tower of our saviour's church
Reaching up unto the ever grey
Our hope knows not death
Numb to its bated breath

We may dream of a world
With no sins for ghosts to forgive
Yet in unwilling eyes
I crave to see God arise!

Behold the golden tower of our saviour's church
Reaching up unto the ever grey
Our hope knows not death
A fathers providence

Until it too draws a final breath

We must break and crack all bone
Trying to hold up the continents he built
Man must bear the task alone
Bowed down beneath

Behold the golden tower
Of our saviour's church
Reaching up unto the ever grey
Our hope knows not death
