Like a faithless I weep
Like an old man in his final, filthy bed
What love was ever mine to keep?
Over what do the trees stand dead?

Brave little flame
I really saw you below the oak
Whilst wondering to thy name
Your dance plumed the fires beneath your cloak

The litany of rain, upon an earthless coffin...
The litany of rain

Like a stranger on the path
Like a lonely man that lingers
What dark creature will reveal it's wrath?
To what do trees point barren fingers?

Silent little flame
Was it really you before my face?
Why burden me with such a shame
Forever your ghost to chase?

The litany of rain, upon an earthless coffin...
