Soon to wake, so weary, so old
Another faceless October mourn

A night torn by time spent sitting deathless
Amongst languished graves plagued by a lifetime
Destined to float upon murky waters
Desperately wondering what to name the conspiracy

I remember last winter
Seeking comfort in the wine offered from your neck
I remember last winter
A lustful bond, both ship and wreck

Under damp death of day to fail
Forever's gloomy ocean to sail

I foresee the coming winter
Seeking comfort in unwilling skin
I foresee the coming winter
Bitter sunrise revealing my sin

Under damp death of day to fail
Forever's gloomy ocean to sail

A night torn by time spent sitting deathless
Amongst languished graves plagued by a lifetime
Destined to float upon murky waters
Desperately wondering what to name the conspiracy

Where man has no part
Between dirt and sun
Between worm and woeful star

I remember last winter
Seeking comfort in the wine offered from your neck
I remember last winter
A lustful bond, both ship and wreck

I foresee the coming winter
Seeking comfort in unwilling skin
I foresee the coming winter
Bitter sunrise revealing my sin
