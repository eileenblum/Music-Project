Holocaust biological conflict
no return from shadows kept
hemorrhage humanity
till none are left

March toward eternity
by ignorant vice
sulfuric rot in scribe
the illiterate breed and thrive
with ignorance to ply
manipulated incumbent
contaminated by repudiation

Cultivated genocide
empty vessels of creation
spurned from judgment
plunged into ash
abandoned to degenerate

The road to annihilation
paved with the slain progeny

[Solo R. Beevers]

Divisive words scar virtue
cleansed of lunacy
to the abyss with humanity's apathy
