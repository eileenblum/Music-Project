Crowned vassals worshipped by fear
Unholy taking lives

Terminate free will
Starvation propaganda
Slaves of pride
deliverance a conquering blade
the spear impales, exsanguination fills the horizon

The putrid stench infects my soul
in awe struck terror my senses recoil
the grim institution of horrors
despair: my judgement

[Solo: J. Gregory]

The putrid stench infects my soul
in awe struck terror my senses recoil
the grim institution of horrors
despair: my judgement

in anguish we serve, with dread we survive
in death we despair we live enraptured

Revolution holocaust uprising
massacre
scorched by design

No breath
no thought
no hope
no life
