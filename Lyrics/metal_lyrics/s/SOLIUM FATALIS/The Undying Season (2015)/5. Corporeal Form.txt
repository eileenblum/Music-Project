Behold your liberator
such absurdity to stand and deliver
clutched within the throat of passive struggle
engulfed in the fury of delusion
witness the emancipator

Blackened eyes to the sightless inviter
permeated in your mind to reveal desire

Validate the barbaric luminary
somatic intention masks grand fabrication
ruination stains corporeal form

[Solo E. Hill]

Such contortions elected by incomprehension
starved demands for desperate fools
we stand in awe of your ignorance
preach beliefs countered to criterion
refuted your collapsed singularity

I thirst the dread
I thirst the end
I thirst humiliation
We thirst for your evisceration
