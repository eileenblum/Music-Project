Rise! Conqueror Supreme
Lies, to feed famine
Die, all falsities writhe
Enlighten those pariahs

Parasites devour beneath
hallowed sacristy feeds
walk toward light, pyres
hallucinate second sight

In servitude kneel
for the legend
In solitude
spawns oppression

Fall monuments of empire
Decay sacrilege inspired
judge hidden beliefs
engulf conscripts of deception

solo: C. Donaldson

In servitude kneel
for the legend
In solitude
spawns oppression

The struggle to survive
all falsities writhe
enlighten those pariahs
engulf conscripts of deception

Rise! Conqueror supreme
Lies to feed famine
die all protagonist claims
eroded flesh of the martyr
