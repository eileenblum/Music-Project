Veiled susurrate
In disregard
The demise of ideals less explored
Blistered pyres of disdain deafened by a language despondent
In abandon a world broken

Throat of the world dilated open
De-creation flows from the wound

Saturating species
Encompassing doom

[Guitar solo: Toby Knapp (Waxen, Onward)]

Light extinguished finite eclipses
Aeons nucleic mass turned to dust
Splinters of your essence torn asunder

Enthralled locution lord of the flies, lord of the flies
Emancipator of grace in purged fidelity, fidelity
Embrace the shadows of uncertainty, uncertainty
Harbinger of relevance cast aside, cast aside

Throat of the world dilated open
De-creation flows from the wound
Throat of the world dilated open
Incarnation seeps from the wound

Throat of the world dilated open
Throat of the world dilated open

Harbinger of relevance cast aside
I consume this variation of subterfuge
