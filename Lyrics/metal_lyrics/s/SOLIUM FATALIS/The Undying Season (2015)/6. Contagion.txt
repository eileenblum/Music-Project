Nameless horror
formless terror
distorted DNA
lurking in the depths
chaos unfurled
disfigured malevolence

Morphed into abomination
tongues lashing out
disease set loose infects life
grotesque appearance willed into existence
parasitic origin
leaches your life

Manipulated genome
combined to decay

[Solo: C. Donaldson ]

Disfigured
manipulated
abomination
broken will helpless disrepair
distorted
forever in despair

Cleansed by fire to resurrect flesh
rotted still functions a heaving form
annihilation of genetic construction
folds life into living destruction

manipulated genome
combined to decay
