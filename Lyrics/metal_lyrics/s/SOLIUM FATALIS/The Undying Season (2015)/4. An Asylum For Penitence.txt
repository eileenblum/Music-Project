Gnarled fingers clutch
my consciousness
it speaks in tongues
a veiled shadow lingers in deceit
embedded forsaken to awe

Divisive guises mourn the loss
wallow in the filth of avarice
denial seeds the malice
of empty vacuity

We shall remain
histrionic woven shades
consecrated with profanity
etched synaptic trauma
horror...forevermore

[Piano/synth solo by Ludovick Daoust]

Decomposed portrait viewed static
oath of denial
unto you uphold
emaciated
the dream forsworn
rejected and diffused
I drift in isolation
carried to obscurity by irreverence

The sulfuric stench of virtuous fiction
so amusing, a condolence for your ignorance
farewell thy crestfallen mortal
blessed be, a slow death to your conviction
