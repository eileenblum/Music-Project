I the wraith
nameless destroyer
I the artist
sculpting horror
I wear the mantle of chaos spawn
and I reap the sorrow
I am divine

Arisen from the endless fissure
angelic creation mourns

Tears flood the emptiness
swept across ionized landscape
defiled my poetry of war
cut by the barbs of scorn
they contort in agony
behold godless humanity

I the demon
I the liar
I the offering
I the empire

[Solo E. Hill]

Up from the black I come crawling
my flesh rots my sinew falling
my words spread nightmare
I am the wretched eternal
out of the dark I slither
all I touch turns to wither
I am the fear upon you

I the demon
I the liar
I the offering
I the empire
