Neurotic cleansing
virulent doctrine
chemical lobotomy

We inhale frenetic psychosis
to global scale hallucination insanity
retched conglomerate black creation
viewed through scope disassociate

Severed from reality
mangled volition
never ending
everlasting sorrow
sadistic martyr

The megalith fractured
fraying the threads of validity

Leading all to slaughter
human life
thrift commodity
Insatiable threshold

[Solo J. DeMarco]

A history of validated murder
deprived of elucidation
and never questioned

Leading all to slaughter
human life,
thrift commodity
Insatiable threshold
