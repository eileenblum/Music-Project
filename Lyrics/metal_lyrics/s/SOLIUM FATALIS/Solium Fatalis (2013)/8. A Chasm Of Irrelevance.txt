Gone... All light...
Wronged... All rights...
Forfeit... Your life
Doomed animus
Removed from all dimension
The path of the dark
Killed on sight

We pray the fathers of the earth
Comfort in the afterlife
To exist on planes of hereafter
Your voice not heard
Insignificant
It never mattered what you thought
It never mattered what you thought at all

Cold, the dark in which you're interred
Empty, your forefather's archaic nature
Pain, none shall escape the beyond
Death, your release from those that torment

Sculpted from imagined stigma of relevance
Voiding phasma, without meaning in conjecture

Blinded by ideals of scripted histrionics
Psychopathic lies told unto ones self for piety
