Explode hyper-cellular acceleration
Infest imagination degeneration
Output level nullified by your kindly gesture
To exceed capacities understood by mass hysterical
De-evolution divined
Liberated by the slaughter for a deity of earth

Knowing of nothing willed out of logic
By a writ and fleshly tome
Saintly worship for visual ticks and fear based rancid terror

Devices of encrypted design
Brought forth by singular disguise
Flesh for a deed
Spit in your face
Condemnation that you are disgraced
A whole example for the fucking human race
And altars by which to damn us by

Die, dying end times end all
Lie, deceit is where we fall
Burn, burn the pages of fate
Escape, escape is to deteriorate
Burn flames to cleanse the world

Purge, the monarchist conjuration unfurled
Testify to your varied lives
Vilify the sub-cultured minds
Razed forever after crucified divergent times
