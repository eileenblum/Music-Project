Hypodermic to black
Involuntary lender
Wake up to coma
Harvesting to dismember
Wake up without eyes
Discounted for your lives

Lay siege to
Like laboring flies
No reprieve when the subject dies
An empire built to schism
Tasted death imprisoned

Wrongly and just convicted
Prisoners then executed
For the greater humanity
Committed to murder in vanity

The narcissistic will of power
Annihilated with apathy... devoured
