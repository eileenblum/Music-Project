Pierced my thoughts
Your forked tongue conspires
With images of sanctimony

Muddled in the spires
Self-loathing hypocrite
Of self-righteous desires

No tearing myself from disaster
Unleash the bloodshed

Enslaved mindless sycophants converge
Save me at your expense
Then turn your gaze

While I slit your throat
Sell out your life
Sell out all you know
Sell out your conscience
Sell out your soul

Put on display for your amusement
Plagues upon thee abhorrent
The fires are burning
The fuse is ignited

While I slit your throat
Sell out your life
Sell out all you know
Sell out your conscience

Set forth to detonate
That which is blighted
Scream the mindless rattle
Into the void that is your soul
