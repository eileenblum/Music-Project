The depravity on which you feed
Deviated psychology spews forth and bleeds
Plague the world to which you have no regard
Coagulates agony blackened and scarred

A virus to feed
Upon the open wounds of man
With thorn embedded hands

Horror, a whisper of a thought
Venom on which serpents rot
Regurgitate bacteria disease
Pain the only release

Initiate sycophantic logic imbued
Back to the pit that birthed you
Erupted turmoil
Consumed to rapture
Gagging plague inhaled
Enlightened by darkness and impaled

I invoke thee!

Thy cursed me!

Where are the leaders of this world
Where are the cowards so I can bleed them
Where are your followers for which you trust

Save us!
Save yourself!
Save my life!
