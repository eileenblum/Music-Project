Light ignites the way to render us blind
Searing vision of the rituals ripped from reality
Cosmos interred multi-dimensional beings enshrined

Forces of nature yet determined
The undying season
Portal warp connected
Sumerian demons of seven abyssal's gorge on your flesh demented
Beg for a fate less tormented in eternal damnation

Gates within space and time
Gates clouded by interpretive lies
Torn apart
Self-destruct the prognosis
Faceless soul exposed
Enshrined in hate
Baptized in the inferno
Purged disbelief of hexagonal theorem

Fates to play on our psychosis
Fear and dismay
Godlike hypnosis
Demented in fever vomit driven reasons

Suffocate ideals free of hate
Paralysis in a sub-conscious state
Existential, your only true fate
Detrimental for evolution lest genesis in alienate
Suffocate ideals free of hate
Paralysis in a sub-conscious state
