Splintered stained glass reality
Complacent sense of relativity
What you seek within your mind
Thy kingdom come insatiable crime

Razors spewed forth in twisted wisdom
Idiosyncratic bleeding narcissism
They rip and claw at states envisioned
Pandemic brought forth by idyllic prisons
Ideal for humanities reckless vision
Burned into mind the thoughts unleashed

Breached through force
Destruct deadline
Impaled mankind
Killed by time
Leeched point blank
Destroyed in time
Then stripped dry
By those who lie

By those who lie

Resemble creator of vestigial prisms
Ejected outward into schism
For those who remember
Ideals burnt to ember
