I can see all the peopleÂ 
As I feel all their pain
Moving step by step as one, as one giant body
Like sheep when the shepherd beckons
They follow his judgements
Like sheep when the shepard beckons,Â 
They follow his judgements now

Woah
Never questioningÂ 
His worthless words
Never doubting his,Â 
Mindless motives [x2]
These people were born and raisedÂ 
In a case of glass,Â 
They are bred and tamed
They are all the same [x4]

No one stands out,
No one questions him

I look them in their eyes but they are blind
I look them in their faces but no one's right
This is crazy
What have you done?
This is crazy
This is Slaughter,

Am I all that's left [x5]

They wish to tear my fleshÂ 
With razorblade teeth like the others.Â 
They want me blindÂ 
In my eyes.
