Break it

As the darkness above you
Comes crashing down
You cannot run away

As the darkness above you
Comes crashing down
You cannot just run away

Take your fears
And lock them in a closet
Where they will rot forever

And lets go

The only way to move is forward
So dont look back
The world is a terrifying place
But we're here
For you

We will not let you do this alone so
Just take my hand
And take a chance

This is a one way road
So just embrace
Every chance we provide you with
Cause it will be the last
This is the last one you'll need
The past is easy to see
So look beyond
We'll protect you
And we'll watch over all of you

With a gun and a halo
