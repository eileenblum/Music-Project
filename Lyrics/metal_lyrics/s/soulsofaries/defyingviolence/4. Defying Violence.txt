Sewing the eyes
Of the one who saw peace
Because it does not exist

Your dreams are not important

Your eyes are locked on the sky
These lies just spill from your jaw
There is no way to rule a world

I won't be here
When they finally realize
That you feed them with empty promises

So take your blood ridden paws
And wrap them around your throat
To end your reign
Of useless power

I won't be here
When they finally realize
That you just feed them empty promises

So take your blood ridden paws
And wrap them around your throat
To end your reign
Of useless power

The hate inside their eyes
Destroys the peaceful times (let's all break down this wall)
What once was great
Now smoulders in ashes (and just defy this violence)
Your hopes and your dreams
Aren't quite the way they seem (we were the ones who trusted you)
They lock them all away
And violence is the key (but now we just defy you)

Lets go!
OH

Look at me

They just want to see you burn

Stare in my eyes
As they take you away
You've seen our pain

Are you ready?

Your dreams are now important

We took care of this wretched leach
That sucked the life from you
I can't believe my eyes
You were the ones who ruled us

We cant be brought down
Down to your level
Because now we're here
And we are the ones

Because now we're here
And we are the ones
Who broke you down

We're now the ones
Who saved you all
