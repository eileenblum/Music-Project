Take a walk on this winter night
The clock strikes back and I'm colder inside
I think I can see ghost's in my mind
I'm feeling tired but my heart's on the line

Egoism's the very essence
Of a noble soul in confidence
Ton of lives and stories untold
It's better to know how to learn than already know

Is man a god's blunder?,
So should would be afraid?
Is god a man's blunder?
Do we need someone to blame?

Sirius has mysterious ways in me
It's all there for everyone to see
It feels like the hooks have sank too deep (oh)
You must be the light who sets me free

On the edge of a human landslide
You are with me, now my lights shine bright
Spending time staring the hourglass
Call me insane but we made a mess

We should trust our consciousness
History is proof of our obtuseness
I get a little frightened sometimes
Scared by deceit that's come across my eyes,

I am the Sirius, Sirius
I am the Sirius, Sirius star.
