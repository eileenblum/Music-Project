Unrelayed, bite right through
Curse the weight that strains your mind
Stationary, facing nothing
It devours you from inside
Short-lived passion, now inflamed
Realize you've spilt the essence
Boiling over, flesh melts fast
Liberate the key to vengeance

I'm not the one to steer this
My duties are fulfilled
Take the strain and struggle
The endless downhill

From a reasonable distance
All seems strangely quiet
Take just one step closer
And be entangled in my spite
Jackhammer comes crushing
Pounds to pulp with no relief
Bite the dust and chew it well
Suffering's all I can give

I'm not the one to steer this
My duties are fulfilled
Take the strain and struggle
The endless downhill
Wreack havoc on my path
Strike back with blinding rage
Nothing can hold me back
None will be saved

Each second the need is growing
To fill this enveloping void
Each instant without passion
Leaves me emptier still
