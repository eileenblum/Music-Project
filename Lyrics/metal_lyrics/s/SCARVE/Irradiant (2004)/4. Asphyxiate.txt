In the end, everything is said. A state of mind one can only regret.
Touch truth but only skim perfection. Plunge beyond this painful deception.
There is a way for it all to happen, a riverbed where everything can flow.
Harsh memories scattered around, no promise on which to bestow

This world, a burden of pain
Asphyxiate this sickening state

Straight ahead to the place we belong. Looking back, it all seems so wrong.
There must be a way for us to see, and dive past each miscalculation.
Fear is the stone cold murdurer, the rampant virus contaminating

This world, a burden of pain
Asphyxiate to recreate
