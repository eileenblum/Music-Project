First war was born before the completion of creation
Our words lit up and stained our souls with quivering shadows
Scarved until our time comes, will you choose to join in?
Banished from this doomsday, our scars will emerge

Scars are eternal (immaculate skin never remains)

Infinite the laws of chaos
My existence is the token
Relic of mortality
The barriers are bound to be broken

Eternal repulsion of profound bliss - don't tear up the missing pieces
The healing frightens the shores of your wounds - don't tear up your missing pieces
Scarved until our time comes, will you choose to join in?
Banished from this doomsday, our scars will emerge

Glue my molten scars back together, decorate the well that pierces my eyes
Light the candles, burn my ice-cold skin, watch... and sigh!
