Cherish that which shines
Beneath a charred black crust
A treasure too enlightening to divulge
The very core of existence
Concentrated in one single being

I will wait until it blooms
The all within the one
And merge with her reflection
The shivering we will become
I will wait until it shines
The precious blinding star
I will dive into her waters
The thrill that grows into war

Haunting and addictive
I deify what roams inside
The diffraction of a mutilated soul
A purity no brandishing could induce
Immense the particle within the whole

Intensity - chaotic ascension
Surpassing gravity
Transcend spiritual convention
To magnify humanity
