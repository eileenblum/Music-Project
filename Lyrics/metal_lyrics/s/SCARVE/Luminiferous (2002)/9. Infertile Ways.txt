We have reached a point in existence
Where the predicted end leaps forward
Infiltrating our subconscious
Until every motive caves in

We have witnessed the elements withdrawing
Interfering devastation
Countless particles absorbing
The perfect world we never should have reached

And helplessly we watch
As the turbulence completes
To erase Infertile Ways

Open wide your privileged eyes
Be the prophet of your own demise
For the meaning of the present
Lies in its affection to the future

You shall see what you're about to be
You shall teach what we have never learned
You'll imagine the knowledge to foresee
You'll achieve what we have left undone

Erase our Infertile Ways!
