Smash the flesh
Hard as you can
And let it come to me...

Pain is for the innocent
Feel its burning radiation
In solemn hideaways
It seeks continous execution

Silently, they all relent
Subdue the tide that turns
Pain spares not the strongest
In this stillborn universe

Smash the flesh
Hard as you can
I'm careless, so careless about death

All resistance is futile...

Observe myslef and grin
Like each one of them I struggle
But one simply can't escape
My fate is just the same

Unavoidably
Pain is for the strongest
So flourish all your hate
And make me suffer
