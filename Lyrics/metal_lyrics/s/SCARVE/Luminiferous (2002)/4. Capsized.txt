Float into the open space of thought
And see only what you will
Justify your belief by any means
Where do you choose to fall?

Deadly design has capsized

What if we were the conscience
Intruded by their light?
We have to look further
What if the only secret
Resided in our minds?
Behold sanity shatter

When the insides start to rumble
You know there's another way
Free to let your certainties evolve
Never settle until the grave

Rumbling, breaking, tumbling, quaking
Can't stop before each den of my mind's taken
Rumbling, breaking, tumbling, quaking
Won't stop until all of her senses awaken
