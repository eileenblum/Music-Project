Visionary madness - a parasite's morphology
Submit all that can serve and plunder with impurity
Break what will not bow through nanotech control
Nothing shall withstand when human pretence unfolds

Proliferating leakage in the mechanism of reason
Tantalize the birthing ground for total domination
Self-contagious sickness leaves the imperfect behind
Every life requires death but this phagocyte is blind

Purity is drifting away
(Along the Path to Apoptosis)

Disappear in the cascade
Of a programmed suicide call
Visionary madness
And its consequential fall
