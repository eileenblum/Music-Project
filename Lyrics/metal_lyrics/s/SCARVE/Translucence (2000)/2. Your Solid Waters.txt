Seeing your submission
Overwhelm the acid taste of life
Nothing more to offer
Consumed, diluted in the sky
Glow above the horizon
In a slow descending motion
Deeper down towards the heat
Liquid crumbles underneath
I once believed
Your Solid Waters
Could save a few more days for me
It hurts to see your beauty die
A formless mass devoid of light
Distilled from deception's bitter grains
Don't desire, don't believe
This empty crush, our raped creation
Floating broken, rained to rust
A copulation of disgust
The strength we shared, a nightly glare
Consumed, diluted in the sky
Submission lies under your Solid Waters
I once believed
Your Solid Waters
Could save a few more days for me
