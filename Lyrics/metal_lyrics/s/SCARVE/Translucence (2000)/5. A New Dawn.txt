I recall a city of soil
Vision of order and hierarchy
Improbable creatures in a stone court
Punishing me for mistakes I cannot remember
My body's different, newly moving
Heavily into this space
A wave of unknown feelings rolls,
Collapses violently within
I recall a stellar junction
Universal sentinels
Throwing me into banishment
Like worthless gravel into the sea
My head is full of confused thoughts
This New Dawn tears my spirit apart
Or is it only just a common conscience?
This life will be an unreal leprosy I can't control...
Sorry for the things I do but I can't control myself
