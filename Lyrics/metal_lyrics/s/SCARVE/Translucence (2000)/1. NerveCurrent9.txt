Swarming in doubt, you suffer of being
Sculpting a spirit, carving a soul
Your every fiber is infiltrated by pain
Not the last time I will torture
Not the last of my attacks
Sole on this surface
I will slip between the cracks
...and sever!
Free to heal you
Free to kill you
All your fear could not destroy
My source of power unwithstood
This current through the nerve
Sectioning the endless cycle of life
Free to heal you
Free to kill you
Free to heal or to kill
