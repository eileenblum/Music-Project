All the way in oh so deep
Digging to the core
Sickening being, vital seed
Always back to make me bleed
I am the murderer (in my dreams)
Just don't have the will to be
Someone pull my claws away
Help me please for it remains
...A pointless twist
...A shrieking cry
...A Kingdom of Sins to rule
...A living lie
Tremble
Tremble to the bone
Can't feel hatred leaving me
The blood of ends infinity
Surreal but right here in my hands
I'll leave you buried once again
My touch is the whip
That rips your flesh to shreds
...A pointless twist
...A shrieking cry
...A Kingdom of Sins to rule
...A living lie
I dream my will to life
I sink in sin tonight
