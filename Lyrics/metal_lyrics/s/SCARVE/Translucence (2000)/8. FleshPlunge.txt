Wade through the mud
On this misty winter dawn
With the future only thoughts away
Ecstasy uncontained
At the sight of her sweet silhouette
Bathed in the humid morning mist
Alone
The cold breeze flows softly
Over her naked body...
I Plunge into her Flesh
Dark the emanations
Of her stream towards relief
My spine chills with passion
Doubt is a sickness
That spares the spirit
But relentlessly devours the soul
Delivered of all my fears
I shall doubt no more
And be who I am!
Forever out of sight...
