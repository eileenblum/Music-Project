His eyes translate an
Uncontrollable fury
His dislocation jaw
Grows in a groan
He moves only at
Insanity's request
When the hope of a
Victory becomes dismal

The wisdomless man
Exhausts himself
Hiding in his den
He cooks his fears
But time and time again
He passively observes
The collective slaughter

Always the same principle
A mortal lack of confidence
He doubts about the nature
Of his instinct
Disguise your thoughts
And implore the fury
Kneel down before
The altar of light
