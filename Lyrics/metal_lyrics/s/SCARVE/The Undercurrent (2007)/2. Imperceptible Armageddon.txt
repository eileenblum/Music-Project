Fear what I see
Something unknown reflecting in me
A new parameter leaves its imprint
Feel so naked
Stripped of what once was a soul
Defeated Unsuspectingly

Inescapable refraction
Recurrent phase in deconstruction
Imperceptible Armageddon
I can't find my way

Fear me
Fear what I see

Burn this conscience
Guilt spews forth a liquid flame
Scorch the path I used to walk
Behold my fate
As ecstatic as it is bleak
In my healing process
Everything becomes so weak

Disrupting my circuitry
Caught off guard once more
Disorientation becomes my name
Everything so weakâ¦
