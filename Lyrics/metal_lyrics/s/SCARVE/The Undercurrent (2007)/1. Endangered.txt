Concealed in this refuge
When the urges to selve
Headfirst into the dark
Grow too strong to resist

Endangered I come alive
Feel my instincts pulsating now
Endangered I breathe new life
Angst, a second awakening

My eyes caught a glimmering light
Some strangely unexpected sign
Triggering all this beyond
My wildest nightmare

How to elevate oneself
Above clouds of mediocrity
When the only open road
Leads directly to rivalry

Insecurity so vital
Ever-changing, non-revealing
Ineluctably reinforces
This jaded resignation

Endangered I come alive
Endangered I've reached new life
