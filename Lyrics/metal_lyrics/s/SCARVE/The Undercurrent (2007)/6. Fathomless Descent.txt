Flattened out, corroded
Filtered till the last drop
Enlacing my damnation
Disappeared at the last stop

Digging way too deep
Wearing out my very core
One glance at this illusion
There's no exit anymore

All merged into disarming bliss
Steep hills transformed into chains
I'm bound to my uselessness

Pay heed, wanderer
To these killings in disguise
It matter not how deadly
All treasures glow from afar

Innocence laid to waste
Bitterness becomes my taste
Gold-plated failure at a breakneck pace
fathomless descent
