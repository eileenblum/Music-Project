Fallen too deep
To live by a vow
No contemplation
It's here and now
This is me and my need
Don't even waste a through
Just inhale and absorb

Take it all away
I exalt my emptiness
Take it all away
Feed on you till I'm done

Carry out denial
Nestled within me
Quicksand has swallowed
The guidelines I lived by
My granted existence
The center of all

Unprepared to face the day
When rights will be reclaimed
Resources dropped to nil
I pillage my way through this maze
Blind steps to the trapdoor
That beckons me to my fall
