Burning me out
Pulling me down
Gnawing at me
Devouring me raw

Shut myself off
Far too Unworthy
Dreams is my shelter
Senseless I will be

Can I take it all ?

Leaping and screaming
In from all sides
Melting and weaving
Locked in the ride

Turn myself out
Yearning for empty
Dream is my shelter
Senseless I will be

Hack my way through evolution
Stand and embrace evolution

Some jewels must remain untouched
Can I take it all and face myself ?
Some illusions must remain enthroned
I will take it all!
