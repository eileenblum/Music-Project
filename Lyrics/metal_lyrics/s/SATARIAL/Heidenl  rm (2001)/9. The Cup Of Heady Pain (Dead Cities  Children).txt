We shall drink up this heady bowl of pain together.
We, the Dead cities' children,
We pass through centuries as shadows aiming the living
With stardust on our garments.

For them our way is a bird and her name is Death,
And our life shall forever remain in their sorrowful dreams.

So kiss my mortal lips
And light up the obsequial fire so that I could die.
In fire my flesh shall resurrect.
We always get to know pain through pain,
Above dead bodies shall the last king rise
And fire of creation shall be his sword.
The heart bets in iron clutches born of the fear of those who left forever.

Do you remember when they perished in delirious dreams,
Night became our home under the Starrain.

But the day came like Magedon
And pain touched us with her soft wings,
By pain you shall be stigmatized.

Our Alfaron has left forever.
