The time will come and the enemy won't leave this way.
So give your blood to drink to our Land's freedom.
Let me drink the wolves' freedom,
The night wind, let me drink your heady ale.
Let the moonshine be split with fire on the celebration of The Dark Moon Godess.

Call me with the wing of the Crow,
With the Elve's flowers,
With the wind of the Night!
Each one of us shall drink the cup of fate someday.

A flower grows where you spill the blood
And the fairy of spring shall plait it into your diadem.
And I'll be back with the wind of freedom
And I'll wipe your tears with my lips.

Where you spill the blood,
Where the sword sang,
Where Death danced with Fate,
There you should praise The Dark Moon Godess.

Don't baptize my land,
Don't baptize my land...
