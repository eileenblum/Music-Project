I'll raise the heroes from the Overseas
And ice will melt in Uttland.
They'll rise from the dark frozen desert.
They'll take your thoughts apart with cold fire,
They'll stop your life with a sword,
Those who came to Darkness for Tiamat,
Those who percieved the power of reincarnation
And the name of the Dark Godess,
Those shall gloriously rise in decline.
They'll freeze,
Waiting for the battle
And the Dragon's Shadow will stigmatize the Earth
And fire arrows will pierce the sky.

Sing the song about the final battle, oh pilgrim.
Sing, for you have seen the decline,
Sing about our Dark Mother's tears
And about the heroes that lay under the mountain.
About the ships that will come from the Overseas,
About the King that dwells in darkness.
Sing, and we'll be back.

You remember the river of fire,
The birth of the mercurial lion
In the fading fire of Sabbath.

Our strength is in these words,
Your oblivion is in these words.
We who came seven levels down,
We crave for vengeance.

Those who came to Darkness for Tiamat,
Those who percieved the power of reincarnation
And the name of the Dark Godess,
Those shall gloriously rise in decline.
They'll freeze, waiting for the battle
And the Dragon's Shadow will stigmatize the Earth
And fire arrows will pierce the sky.
