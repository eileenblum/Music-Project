Valiant days, when i walked in shadows
Endless time of pain
Alone i seek a sacred scripture
The lost scrolls of the plauge

A darkened figure amidst my shadow
Ha said "search the land and find the key
Unlock this door, to this kingdom
And all will be yours beyond the sea"

Let the moruning light guide your way
Fire so bright, scorching flames
A quest of honor, valiant name
Let the mourning light guide your way
