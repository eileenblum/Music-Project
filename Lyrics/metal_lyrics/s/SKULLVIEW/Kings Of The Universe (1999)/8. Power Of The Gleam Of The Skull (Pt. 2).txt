I'm losing my mind, now gaining control
Caught in a trap, it's taking it's toll
Nobody cares, nobody hears
Searching to find the power within
The strenght is now strong
The gleam of the skull
The power of might, the search for a soul
Willing to try, fighting to give
The power of all comes from within

Can you hear them can you see them
Can you feel the power of the skull [2 times]

I'm looking around, trying to see
My life has become a blur to me
I reach down inside, i'm lost and now blind
Stuck in a trip, i fall from the sky
The strenght is now strong
The gleam of the skull
The power of might, the search for a soul
Willing to try, fighting to give
The power of all comes from within

Can you hear them can you see them
Can you feel the power of the skull [4 times]

Take away this misery
I'm falling too fast in a hole
Breaking into an eternal bliss and i find
There is nowhere to go
The battle is lost, i've thrown down my axe
And i walk into the gleam of the skull
I move too fast, the power is strong
I want back my lost soul

The power of the gleam of the skull

Searching to find his will to live
Searching to find the heart within
Anger is the essensce of pain
Live your life in agony
Power lies from deep within
If you fail you will die my friend
