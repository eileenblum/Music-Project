Hail to the madness
Hail to the sea
Bring forth another valiant knight
For the world he'll live

Hail to the madman
Hail to the crying
Bound in arms of steel
The valiant sword will bleed

Promises from the scriptures
Written in stone long ago
Tells a tale that predicts the facts of life
Of this world unknown

Cobwebs and shadowed images
Victims of life are told
Cobwebs and shadowed images
For this glory unfolds

Long ago, in an age of crime
Bring forth another page of this life
Written in stone, cast to the sea
The scriptures of life and the prophecies
Hail to thee

Take another light to the heavens
Your burning torch so bright

Long ago, in an age of crime
Bring forth another page of this life
Written in stone, i cast what i say
The scriptures of life and the prophecies
Hail to thee

There is a light in the heavens
Your burning torch so bright

Can you set me free, lead me in the dark
The pain of reality, there's torture in my heart
Can you feel teh madness now
I have nowhere to turn
Bound in arms of steel
The valiant sword will burn inside of me

Hail to thee, hail to thee
Hail to thee, hail to thee
Cobwebs and shadowed images
Cobwebs and shadowed images
