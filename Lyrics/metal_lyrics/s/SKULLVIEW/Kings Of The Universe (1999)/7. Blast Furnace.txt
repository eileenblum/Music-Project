Scream!

Scream!

Scream!

Scream from the top of your lungs

Scream!

Scream!

Scream!

Scream from the top of your lungs

Your brain feels impacted with fire, now you're gone,
You're burning inside
A trip of the mind, you feel you're about to explode,
But now you are blind

What does it feel like to be a loser of the world
Did you ever think about
What you really deserve

Scream!

Scream!

Scream!

Scream from the top of your lungs [2 times]

What does it feel like to be a loser of the world
Did you ever think about
What you really deserve

You think about the past
But your mind is such a mess
Now you suffer
In a blaze of burning hell
No tomorrow
Can you feel the fire scorching you soul
You burn
Controlled by the brain
And you feel that you're insane,
Are you crazy, are you going mad
Fire blazing,
Now you are left behind in the smoke
Lungs aching
You begin to choke, you're on fire

Let it burn, let it burn
Blast! blast! blast! blast! blast furnace!
