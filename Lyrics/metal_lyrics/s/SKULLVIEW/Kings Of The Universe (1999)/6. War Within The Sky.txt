Darkened days we cruise the skies
Bloodshed tears cloud your eyes
Mountains of rage burn with fire
Deep inside

Clenched in battle for our master
The war machine it soars so high
The endless supremacy
The war within the sky

[chorus]
War within the sky
Soaring so high
Tortured in ruins and beat down
Take my life
In the sky

Tortured in ruins and beat down
Take my life

Arms of steel and nuclear power
Metal strenght and legends of valor
In the sky see molecular horror
Hear the screams as the missiles devour
[2 times]

War within the sky
Soaring so high
Tortured in ruins and beat down
Take my life
In the sky
Tortured in ruins and beat down
Take my life

Arms of steel and nuclear power
Metal strenght and legends of valor
In the sky see molecular horror
Hear the screams as the missiles devour
