Long ago before the rage
I can hear them call my name
I've heard these screams before
The battle to slay the dragon dead
The nails of pain are burning red
I know my destiny awaits to take the fall
Blackened hearts can't tell the facts
To lunge the sword into the dragons back
I'm scared to death, and i will die soon
Holding anger deep inside
I cannot run i cannot hide
I must accomplish my destiny to kill

The blanket of light has risen
Grasp the light, hold onto the flame
Breaking free from his misery

You will awake from this loss
Screams of pain from the burning cross
If you believe in the dragon

Grasp ahold of the mighty axe
Never fear there's no turning back
Hold on tight, feel the aching blow

Grab hold to the mighty axe
Never fear there's no turning back
Hold on tight, feel the aching blow

I know there is no misery
Listen to me, i'm not afraid
'cause i'm in league with the dragon

Long ago before the rage
I can hear them call my name
I've heard the screams before

The battle to slay the dragon dead
The nails of pain are burning red
I know my destiny awaits to take the fall
Blackened hearts can't tell the facts
To lunge the sword into the dragons back
I'm scared to death, and i will die soon
Holding anger deep inside
I cannot run i cannot hide
I must accomplish my destiny to kill

Feel the fire burning in his eyes
Strip away the dragon's pride
Feel the anger deep inside your mind
I believe in the dragon

You're in league with the dragon
You're in league with the dragon
