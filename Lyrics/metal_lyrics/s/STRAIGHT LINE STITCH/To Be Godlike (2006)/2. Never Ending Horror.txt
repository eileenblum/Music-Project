Emotions rotting in my mouth
Biting my tongue to keep them from coming out
Spoiling on the inside has made me nauseated
Holding everything inside I thought I ever hated
Why is so much amiss? Why must you inflict this

[pre-chorus]
Why is this horror never-ending?
What did I do? Who am I offending?
You try to break me, you cannot break me (i'm only bending)

[chorus]
I wake up everyday
So many feelings of dismay
The nightmare becomes real
Facing this ordeal
Why should I even look ahead?

I want so bad to feel apart of me thats killed
My flesh collides-dying on the inside
Fading into nothing, yes it is coming
Up and through my insides never to subside

[pre-chorus]

This is where it ends

[chorus]

This is where it ends
