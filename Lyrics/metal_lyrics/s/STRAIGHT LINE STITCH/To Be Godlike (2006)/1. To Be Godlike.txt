Is there anyway that I can recant my doubts?It seems as if I always have my hands outA social pariah is not your messiahWhat is there to venerate? Nothing on the outside to captivateTear myself at the seams cause I feel dirty &amp; uncleanYou can save all your approbationsThere's more to me then your single-minded manipulationAccept me as I am or don't accept me at all No longer is there an occupancy for meWithin myself I retreat from all discrepancy Please accept me This cannot be simplified,feelings buried deep insideDon't you canonize me / Don't you patronize meI have nothing that you need, tell me why you cannot see You see right through me / I'm not what you believeCan you hear me cry out? Do you feel the pain I feel now?Can I be redeemed and not lose my self-esteem? Don't canonize me / Don't patronize meI have nothing that you need, tell me why you cannot seeAccept me as I am
