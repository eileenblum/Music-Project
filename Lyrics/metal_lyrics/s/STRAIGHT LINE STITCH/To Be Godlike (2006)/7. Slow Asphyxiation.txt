Myself [6x]
Self-immolation
Oh, I feel my body leaving me,
Hole in my lungs I cannot breathe.
To much hate in me and I cannot breathe (breathe)

I feel my heart slowly tear
In my wind pipes not enough air.
Too much hate in me, I cannot believe in me, I need a release from myself (myself)
The anger that I have won't be subdued
If only I could express this to you (if you only knew [2x])
You say I'm not who I used to be,
No one to blame who could of changed me, you say I'm not who I used to be,
No one to blame, who could have changed me
No one to blame!
I feel good, I feel great
Inside I hyperventilate I strangle with this selfhate
You say I'm not who I use to be (I'm not)

I feel my heart slowly tear
In my wind pipes not enough air.
Too much hate in me, I cannot believe in me, I need a release...
you say I'm not who I used to be
I am not!
