It's so hard to let go of this grief that constantly follows me
This dull ache within my bones won't leave me alone
A pain I've always known
Refusing to go anywhere that cannot be repaired
My feelings of despair say that I don't have a prayer

[Chorus:]
Make me believe that this is not the end
Make me believe that you can't take this from me
Make me believe

How can I heal?
Retreating inside, I hide myself from you, forsaking everything I knew

I'll find my way out of this adversity
Won't let you push me into obsecurity
Swallow my pride and myself pity
You can save your sympathy
Save your sympathy

[Chorus]

So many misleading routes that I can't find my way out
So use to misery suffusing everything
Taking me / making me / break everything

You can't condemn me
