I thought I'd begun to see the light but shadows appeared
and this is just like I feared, no path is clear

[Chorus:]
I'll run away, won't look behind me
Cut all strings and set myself free
let go of everything (that hurts me)

How did I get here? 
Can I just make myself disappear?
I can't live another day like this
Not knowing what it is I'm fighting against

[Chorus]

I want to be free

Dear God, why am I running away? 
(Why am I running away?)

Please ease my pain / Please let me start again
I'm starting over, I begin again (I've seen the truth)
