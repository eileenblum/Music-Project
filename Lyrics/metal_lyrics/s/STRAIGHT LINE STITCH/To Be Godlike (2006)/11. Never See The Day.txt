There's nothing that you can, take from me. That you don't have to a certain degree. God help me - feel something, 'Cause I feel nothing!  What do you want from me? I have given you my plea. Gave you my life, gave you my soul, In which you already control.  What do you want from me? Give me time to grieve. Relinquish control! Why can't you, just let me go? Why grab a hold of nothing?  There's nothing you can take from me. There's nothing I can do for you. There's nothing you can take from me. There's nothing I can do for you. No matter how you try to get inside of me.  You try to get in but there's no entry, Because there's more to me than just debris. Gradually, you've taken everything, Except my sanity. I'm wrapped around your finger. I'm wrapped around you.  You're just where I want you. Never see the day!  Theres nothing, that you can, take from me! ('Cause I feel nothing!)
