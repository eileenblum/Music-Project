Blood in their eyes

Make a sacrifice 
We got to regain consciousness
Take this life run from the darkness

Blood in their eyes
They cannot see their demise
It's what we knew it would be
A life hypocrisy
This is no circumstance
No fucking game of chance
This the weight of the world

There's got to be more than this
Inside my heart's an open abyss
The pieces have fallen into place
And we have fallen from grace

Make a sacrifice and run from the darkness

Depart from here the end in near
Whom is it that you really fear
Suffer the consequence
This is the weight of the world
