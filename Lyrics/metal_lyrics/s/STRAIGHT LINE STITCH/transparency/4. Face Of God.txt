Grant me breath and watch me come alive
Give me strength I will survive
The feast is over now it's time to flee
All my enemies here to devour me

I could've prayed but I never stopped believing
I know you stayed even when I said I'm leaving
Don't turn your face
Don't leave this place
Escape this hell

You never see me I never a sound
I've been here I've been hiding underground
Release relieve I still believe
Restore renew the lost and confused
Rebuild resolve the feud that kills us all

Make me see
Make me see I'm not believing

You never see me
I never make a sound
I've been here hiding
Hiding underground

This is hell
