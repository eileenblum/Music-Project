I know we sacrificed
I nearly lost my life
Abiding sadness enduring madness
This is sickness needing forgiveness
I break the cycle of heartache
I cannot take

I went astray entangled in the fray
I lost my way in your retribution
But give me absolution
Don't hate me forever

You won't consume me
You never knew me
There is no way I'll let you break me down into pieces
I'm not defeated won't be mistreated
Don't be conceited that you were never needed

I know what I've done I never tried to run
The burden's not mine alone and I'm not made of stone

Up until now I've worn this pain like a shroud
Your pain is mine and I think it's time
That I face this loss and let go this cross I've had to bare
I no longer care 
And I'm not scared of anyone or anything even you
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing left to prove
I've nothing left to lose
