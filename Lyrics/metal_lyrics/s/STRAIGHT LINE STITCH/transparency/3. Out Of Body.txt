I lean when you stay straight
I stop
Everything that you say you are
I'm not
I'm not lost
Lost
So lost
I'm not lost

Hurt me no more
I will endure
Stone me and dethrone me
You cannot
Cannot hold me

I am so weak and your strength makes me shake
Something that I see in you makes my heart break
Break down these walls
You cannot hold me at all

Hurt me no more
I will endure
Cannot hold me

Don't leave me drowning in self pity like this
Please come to me and I won't resist
