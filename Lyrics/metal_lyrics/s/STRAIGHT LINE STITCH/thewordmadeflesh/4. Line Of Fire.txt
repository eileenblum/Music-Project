What's done I can't undo but I would die for you
I got involved in something I never meant to
But it wasn't something I could easily undo
I can't move &amp; I can't breathe in this box of apathy
This complicated everything I've ever hated
How do I defend the position that I find myself  in
No use in choosing sides cause no one will ever win
In no time quickly this will travel
Just in time to see your life unravel
I pushed you over pushed you aside left with no one in whom I could confide
I never meant to push you (away)
What's done I can't undo but I would die for you
I got involved in something I never meant to
But it wasn't something I could easily undo
Ask me what I go through &amp; I'd giving anything to take it all away
I pushed you over but you threw me away now there's more to say
Sacrifices I made &amp; promises that I gave have been broken &amp; backfired held in the crossfire
So many casualties lying around me as far as the eye can see
Take it away can I convey decisions that I've made are buried &amp; decayed
What's done I can't undo but I would die for you
