Show yourself show me your face show me who you really are
Don't tell me the reason why you hide yourself from me is because you think that we are similar
With blood on your hands you are unclean
Preying on those who are depraved but you yourself  you know you cannot be saved
I know who you are you cover your scars
So many unshed tears to undergo a pain so severe
You try to take me by surprise I see right through your eyes
Wicked malicious are blameless &amp; faultless
Forgive you?? How can I? I can't even forgive myself
What (you) you take you take from me
Please give me something to pull myself through don't you think that its way overdue
Say it's for the last time
Why would you do this? You could never explain this
Why would you do this? Never again
For the last time. Forgive you how can I?
