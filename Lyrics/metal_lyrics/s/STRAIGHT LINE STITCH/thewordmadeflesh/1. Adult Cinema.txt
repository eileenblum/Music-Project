Now showing for your viewing pleasure
To be insecure but how to endure
Why would you want be anything like me?
Is this how we choose to live our lives?
Feeding off others pain just to survive
I've given you a perfect view consider this my very special gift to you
Here's your ticket &amp; a front row seat to my misery as you watch me like
You watch the sliver screen
I could be your scapegoat &amp; I could be your martyr
Anything you want of me but it just gets harder
You take me break me hold me choke me mold &amp; control me
The same words repeating myself the same energy depleting itself
One this will all be over &amp; no one will be left to recover
&amp; you will find that I am human
So use to being empty with no one to comfort me
I'll let you see at my own expense
After all enjoying your own pain wouldn't make much sense
I've given you a perfect view consider this my very special gift to you
Look away this is hurting me you'll only end up deserting me
Look away my life can't save you I'll only end up depraving you
Look away
