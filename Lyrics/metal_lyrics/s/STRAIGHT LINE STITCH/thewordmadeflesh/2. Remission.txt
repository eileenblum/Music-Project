This is the last day the last day that I sway
No longer will you dictate what I do or say
I've taken a leave of absence
I've taken a leave of the senses
&amp; there's nothing in the world that could change this
Life is diminished
I'm leaving you &amp; everything I knew
Tomorrow only leads to more sorrow
But I don't care pretend your unaware
I was never there
No one cries more than I take my life but scare to die
I feel so incomplete everything is way beyond me
Watching my life go by standing on the sideline
I'm leaving you &amp; everything I knew everything is you
I'm leaving you &amp; everything I knew
Tomorrow only leads to more sorrow
But I don't care pretend your unaware
I was never there

Standing on the sideline where I've been left behind
Standing on the sideline waiting for the right time (life goes by)
