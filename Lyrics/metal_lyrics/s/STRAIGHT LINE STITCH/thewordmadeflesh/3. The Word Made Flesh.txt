Intensify the pain as I speak these words
So personal to me do I make things ten times worse
Throwing all sense of caution to the wind
The next tragedy will begin where this one ends
With everything that's happened &amp; I allowed
If I held this all inside I'd be dead by now
Reality dawns &amp; ends the world of make believe
Suffering silently is done for my day has come
I die every time I say these words that kill something in you
The word made flesh the word is flesh
With everything that's happened &amp; you know that I allowed
I let this out &amp; it all affects you some how
Reality dawns &amp; ends the world of make believe
I've only said what I felt to play the hand that I was dealt
So I'm unstable but my cards are here on the table
Suffering silently is done for my time has come
Breaking my bones this friction this is like a sick addiction
I refuse to place the blame but whoever you are go back from where you came
Screaming voices in my head words never to be heard
Suffering silently is done for my time has come
