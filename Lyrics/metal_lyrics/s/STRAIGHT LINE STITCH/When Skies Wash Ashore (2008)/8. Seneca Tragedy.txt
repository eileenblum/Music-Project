Temperature is rising no disguising these cries tonight
Spin the wheel this is real doesn't matter if your right
Lost in the shadows outside this room take my last breath
I would die for you
Wake me from this dream where everything is so unclean
Take it all away
The world is crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
I hold on tight
The world keeps crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
Lets make this right tonight
The picture is fading tired of waiting my hearts on ice
Say a prayer you can swear in the end we'll burn the sky
Chemical silence, a violent blue just hold my hand
I would die for you
Wake me from this dream where everything is so unclean
Take it all away
The world is crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
I hold on tight
The world keeps crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
Lets make this right tonight
I'll wait until my heart starts beating again so I can make sense of it all
Don't know where I'm going but I know where I've been try to make sense of it all
The world is crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
Just hold on tight
The world keeps crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
Lets make this right tonight
The world is crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
Just hold on tight
The world keeps crashing down on me with every second that I breathe
Lets make this right tonight
