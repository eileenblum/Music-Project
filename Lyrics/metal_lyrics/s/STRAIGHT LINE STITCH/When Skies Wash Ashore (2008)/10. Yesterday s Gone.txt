I'd take the next train going anywhere if I knew you where there
I'd swim across the ocean &amp; sail the seven seas just to have you here with me
All I ever asked for &amp; all I ever wanted now has flashed before my eyes
So many broken promises when you run out of time
The morning that you left I felt a pain no one could heal- I wish it wasn't real
&amp; I can still remember all the laughter that we shared- life is so unfair
You lifted me up &amp; fueled my dreams now yesterday's gone
When I breathe I whisper your name in memory cause yesterday's gone
&amp; I know I can move on from that cold December rain straight from my heart
I wish you could see how I've changed
How can I get through another show with out your face in the crowd?
Still feel that chill in the air when the lights go down
Nothing can be said to make this all go away- just take it day by day
Every time I fall behind I think about your smile- &amp; I go another mile
You lifted me up &amp; fueled my dreams now yesterday's gone
When I breathe I whisper your name in memory cause yesterday's gone
&amp; I know I can move on from that cold December rain straight from my heart
I wish you could see how I've changed
The world still turns
What does it mean?
I silence the scream, It feels like I'm falling down
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
You lifted me up &amp; fueled my dreams now yesterday's gone
When I breathe I whisper your name in memory cause yesterday's gone
You opened my eyes &amp; set me free but yesterday's gone
Now the wind whispers your name in memory cause yesterday's gone
&amp; I know I can move on from that cold December rain straight from my heart I wish you could see how I've changed
