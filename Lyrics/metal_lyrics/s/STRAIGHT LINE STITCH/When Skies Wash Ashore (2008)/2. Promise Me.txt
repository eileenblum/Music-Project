This is the last day the last day that I sway
No longer will you dictate what I do or say
I've taken a leave of absence I've taken a leave of the senses
&amp; There's nothing in the world that could change this- I can't change this
No regrets
I'm calling on you angels of truth
Tell me that you'll never fall through
Promise me Promise me
Don't crumble like paper mache
Tell me that you'll always fine your way
Promise me Promise me
This is the last day the last day that I sway
No longer will they dictate what I do or say
Not another dying day a part of me that's wasted away
&amp; There's nothing in the world that could change this- you can't change this
No regrets
I'm calling on you angels of truth
Tell me that you'll never fall through
Promise me Promise me
Don't crumble like paper mache
Tell me that you'll always fine your way
Promise me Promise me
Standing on the sidelines where I've been left behind
Right here on the sidelines waiting for the right time
Life goes by
I'm calling on you angels of truth
Tell me that you'll never fall through
Promise me Promise me
Don't crumble like paper mache
Tell me that you'll always fine your way
Promise me Promise me
