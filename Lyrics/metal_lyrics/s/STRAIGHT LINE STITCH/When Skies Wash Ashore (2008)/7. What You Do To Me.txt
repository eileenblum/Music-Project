Please heal me feel me kill me its not easy
Everything I had is all I had to give
&amp; what I have is not enough for me to live
&amp; how long till your gone is this what life is something's gone wrong
These days I cannot cope at all I need some kind of miracle
To shake me from this confusion its what you do to me
My heart lies bleeding in your hands time stops &amp; turns around again
It doesn't matter what you say its what you do to me
You hurt me desert me divert me its not easy
Is there anything that could change my point of view
Wish you only knew how much I bled for you
So hang on
won't be long is this what life is something's gone wrong
These days I cannot cope at all I need some kind of miracle
To shake me from this confusion its what you do to me
My heart lies bleeding in your hands time stops &amp; turns around again
It doesn't matter what you say its what you do to me
Its what you do to me
Pick up the pieces all around
Always wondered why we fight never even made a sound
Never thought I'd see the light
I'm not falling I rather stand alone
These days I cannot cope at all I need some kind of miracle
To shake me from this confusion its what you do to me
My heart lies bleeding in your hands time stops &amp; turns around again
It doesn't matter what you say its what you do to me
