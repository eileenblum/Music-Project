I heard a voice just yesterday that told me I'm slipping away
I never felt like this before the sky's not blue anymore
But the wind still blows &amp; the story goes
Lend me your wings fallen angel I'd like to fly away from here
I'm coming home
On &amp; on we ride the storm with our blinders on &amp; our faith no more
On &amp; on we dream but it feels so real I can barely breathe
My life has changed don't even remember the game
I never felt like this before the skies are washed ashore
But the wind still blows &amp; the story goes
Lend me your wings fallen angel I'd like to fly away from here
I'm coming home
On &amp; on we ride the storm with our blinders on &amp; our faith no more
On &amp; on we dream but it feels so real I can barely breathe
I'll find my way like the sun finds the day
&amp; the wind still blows I'm- coming home
Lend me your wings fallen angel I'd like to fly away from here
I'm coming home
On &amp; on we ride the storm with our blinders on &amp; our faith no more
On &amp; on we dream but it feels so real I can barely breathe
Tonite I'm not alone the light is all around me
Change is in the air- I'm coming home
