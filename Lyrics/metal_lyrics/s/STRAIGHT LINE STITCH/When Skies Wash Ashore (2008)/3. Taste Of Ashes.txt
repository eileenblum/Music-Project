[feat. Jamey Jasta]

Let them pull the wool over your eyes â no hope for the fallen
Misconceptions of a false paradise â these words are unspoken
The blind leading the blind but I decline â we walk the straight line
The one who holds the truth be divined â death is forever
The writings on the wall now the mighty fall
Divided we cannot stand bury your head into the stand
Killing the fat of the land an albatross across your neck- thorn in your side
Don't be afraid of the dark you're still held up by the stars
The light will carry us over
The dice have been cast &amp; your position must be steadfast- we are the chosen
Let no man pull us under never deter- there is no contrast
You can't always crucify what you don't understand- beware of the vampire
&amp; this time you'll see who has the upper hand- the world is a wasteland
Don't be afraid of the dark you're still held up by the stars
The light will carry us over
When all this time has gone by you'll stop &amp; ask yourself why
The light will carry you over
Open up your eyes / read between the lines
However long the night the dawn will break
However long my eyes are closed I'm wide awake
Stand, stand, stand up &amp; fight
It won't be long before this candle burns again
Don't be afraid of the dark you're still held up by the stars
The light will carry us over
When all this time has gone by you'll stop &amp; ask yourself why
The light will carry you over
However long the night the dawn will break
However long my eyes are closed I'm wide awake
Stand, stand, stand up &amp; fight
