You bend you break you crumble
Your kingdom has fallen you stumble
Fight for your life to not fall through the cracks
Its to late there's no going back
Time waits for no one and the damage is done
Caught between a rock and a hard place without a face

[Chorus]
Everything has gone to black and there's no coming back
There's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow
There will never come a day when we'll see it the same way
There's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow

I mend I wake I fumble
I will show you what's meant be humble
You will never again get the best of me
No longer will my heart bleed
I've got the power (power) &amp; I've got the gun
And now your hour has come

[Chorus]
Everything has gone to black &amp; there's no coming back
There's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow
There will never come a day when we'll see it the same way
There's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow

How does it feel?
This is how it feels

[Chorus]
Everything has gone to black &amp; there's no coming back
There's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow
There will never come a day when we'll see it the same way
There's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow
Everything has gone to black &amp; there's no coming back
There's no tomorrow there's no tomorrow

There's no tomorrow
