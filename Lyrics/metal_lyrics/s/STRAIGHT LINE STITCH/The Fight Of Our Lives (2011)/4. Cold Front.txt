Don't turn away you might miss me as my soul starts to fade (fade away)
What's left to say? Please forgive me if I'm losing my faith (losing my faith)

Don't get to close
Cause I stand alone
I've got no way out (just go)

[Chorus]
I've turned my back on feeling  (I'm cold)
I've given up on dealing
Take my life break the ice
I've got nothing inside   (just go)
You hold a heart that is freezing  (I'm cold)
Its going to break into pieces
Take my life break the ice
I've got nothing inside

Don't be afraid of the emptiness that stands in your way (your way)
Stay with me stay but my frozen lips just won't let me say  (please stay)

Don't get to close
Cause I stand alone
I've got no way out (just go)

[Chorus]
I've turned my back on feeling  (I'm cold)
I've given up on dealing
Take my life break the ice
I've got nothing inside   (just go)
You hold a heart that is freezing  (I'm cold)
Its going to break into pieces
Take my life break the ice
I've got nothing inside

Inside it's winter in my soul (so just let me go)
This heart can only break there's only so much I can take (I can take)

Don't turn away you might miss me as my soul starts to fade (fade away)
Just go

[Chorus]
I've turned my back on feeling  (I'm cold)
I've given up on dealing
Take my life break the ice
I've got nothing inside   (just go)
You hold a heart that is freezing  (I'm cold)
Its going to break into pieces
Take my life break the ice
I've got nothing inside

Inside
