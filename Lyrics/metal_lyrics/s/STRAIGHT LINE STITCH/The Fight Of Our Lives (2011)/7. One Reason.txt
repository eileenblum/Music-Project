Its a shame to hide behind my back
And when the hammer drops the smoke will clear
Your there and I should of caught you red handed in the first place

[Chorus]
Give me one reason why I should trust another fool like you
I'm done with believing you
The harder I try to see the truth that lies in your eyes
I'm done with believing you

You send out your spies
I can hear them scratching at the walls
And I got no time to think when your inside my head
Your here and should of caught you red handed in the first place

[Chorus]
Give me one reason why I should trust another fool like you
I'm done with believing you
The harder I try to see the truth that lies in your eyes
I'm done with believing you

Its a shame to hide behind my back
Should of caught red handed in the first place

[Chorus]
Give me one reason why I should trust another fool like you
I'm done with believing you
The harder I try to see the truth that lies in your eyes
I'm done with believing you

Give me one reason I'm done believing you
