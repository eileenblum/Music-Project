You never say what you mean, mean what you say

Pick up the pieces and heal the pain of your cruelty
Maybe one day you'll be able to say that you're truly free but there's no guarantee
It's always the same everywhere you go welcome to the sideshow
Right up front for the whole world to see your display
You can never get away

[Chorus:]
You never say what you mean, mean what you say
I'll blow you away (blow you away)
Shot down in a blaze now you're lost without a trace (without a trace)
But don't get caught out by the undertow (out by the undertow)
Because today is the day that you'll never
Never escape (never escape)

I hope you see my face as clear as day and it continues to haunt you
Maybe someday you'll be able to breakthrough but you don't have that kind of virtue
It's always the same every time I move like you got something to prove (something to prove)
You think I'd lose my edge over the third degree excuse me if I disagree

[Chorus]

You'll never escape
You turned your back on me
You'll never escape
