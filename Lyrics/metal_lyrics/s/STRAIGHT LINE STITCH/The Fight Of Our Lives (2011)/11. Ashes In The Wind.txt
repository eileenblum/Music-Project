The rain has fallen so hard enough to drown
The thunder crashes to earth and shakes the ground
Faces hidden in the shadows it's so sad
Don't rock the cradle when it's draped in black

[Chorus]
I've never fallen so far from where I've been
This road has ended but a new one begins
And I wash away my sins like ashes in the wind
Like ashes in the wind
Like ashes in the wind

The tears run so fierce it leaves you blind
And there are many mountains yet to climb
My feet are bleeding on the glass of broken dreams
Devastation lies right here right in front of me

[Chorus]
I've never fallen so far from where I've been
This road has ended but a new one begins
And I wash away my sins like ashes in the wind
Like ashes in the wind
Like ashes in the wind

The rain has fallen so hard enough to drown
The thunder crashes to earth and shakes the ground

[Chorus]
I've never fallen so hard from where I've been
This road has ended but a new one begins
And I wash away my sins like ashes in the wind
Ashes in the wind
I've never falling so far from where I've been
This road has ended but a new one begins
And I wash away my sins like ashes in the wind
Ashes in the wind
Like ashes the wind
