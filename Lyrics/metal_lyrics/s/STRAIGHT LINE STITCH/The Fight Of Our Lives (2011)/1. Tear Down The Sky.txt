My deepest darkest fears come to life
Everything you are was just a lie to tear down my sky
I live to seek the truth
And I have done all this without you
Hide behind your material possessions until the stars align
Victory is mine
You were never who you claimed to be
Something's happened to reality
What I feel is beyond belief
I feel my heart has fallen out of me
How I fell for your stupidity your hypocrisy
Your insincerity dishonesty and duplicity
I can't believe that you had the audacity

[Chorus:]
These scars have left me guarded
There's nowhere left to run (away)
When will this hurt begin to fade
These scars have left me guarded
And nothing has become (of me)
When will all this hurt begin to fade (away)

If you only knew there's no one left here that even cares for you
That was the last stone that you fucking threw
And if you died today I wouldn't bury you
So get a fucking clue
I won't be broken
Not by you or the words which you've spoken
Goodbye and farewell
Where we go from here it's not hard to tell
You were never who you claimed to be
Something's happened to reality
What I feel is beyond belief
I feel my heart has fallen out of me
How I fell for your stupidity your hypocrisy
Your insincerity dishonesty and duplicity
I can't believe that you had the audacity

[Chorus]

You wanna change who I am
You think I'm too weak to stand up
You're not better than me
I'll take you down down down down to your knees

[Chorus]
