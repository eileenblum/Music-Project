Out from the darkness and into the light
I open up my eyes awaken by the sight
Of the walls that are closing in, it's happening again
Just another black cloud that's become my only friend

Bring it on
No one said it'd be easy and you don't have to believe me
When I tell you it's not over
I've come to far to back down now
Gotta finish what I started it's not over (no its not over)

[Chorus]
So hold on say we'll never surrender
If there's a chance of losing hope let it go
So hold on say we'll never surrender
If there's a chance of losing hope let it go

Another sleepless night alone and I can't do this on my own
I'm reaching out to touch someone just like me
But no one seems to hear my voice it echos across the void
Shattering the noise

Bring it on
This is our chance for redemption and you don't have to question
Whether we're or if we're right
I've come to far to back down now
Gotta finish what I started it's not over (no its not over)

[Chorus]
So hold on say you'll never surrender
If there's a chance of losing hope let it go
So hold on say we'll never surrender
If there's a chance of losing hope let it go

So hold on
This is the fight of our lives
Hold on
Whether we're wrong or we're right
Hold on

[Chorus]
So hold on say we'll never surrender
If there's a chance of losing hope let it go
So hold on say we'll never surrender
If there's a chance of losing hope let it go
So hold on
