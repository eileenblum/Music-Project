There's nothing to defend
Nothing left but regret
Its the beginning of the end

What's it all been for?
I can't take it anymore
You take all we give
And now it's time to burn the bridge
We've been set up for fall
Now they've come to kill us all
The time has come
The time has come

In this world all we've done is hold each other back
To be the one that's the leader of the pack
Blood on your hands but it's all the same
It's the warm up before the game
Tell me how its suppose to be
I've done to you what you've done to me
So many fatalities so many broken dreams
So many unheard screams its beyond extreme

[Chorus]
By the time you reach out - no one can save you now
And see the truth - no one can save you now
It'll be no use - no one can save you now
It's overdue - no one can save you now

What's it all been for?
I can't take it anymore
You take all we give
And now it's time to burn the bridge
We've been set up for fall
Now they've come to kill us all
The time has come

You hate me and you hate yourself
Don't lie cause it bad for your health
All the wrongs that you can't put to rights
How do you sleep at night
No time to wonder no one will save you
No man to take us under you'll see the truth

You'll see the truth

We can't fall under we must transcend
It's the beginning of the end
It's the beginning of the end

[Chorus]
By the time you reach out - no one can save you now
And see the truth - no one can save you now
It'll be no use - no one can save you now
It's overdue - no one can save you now
