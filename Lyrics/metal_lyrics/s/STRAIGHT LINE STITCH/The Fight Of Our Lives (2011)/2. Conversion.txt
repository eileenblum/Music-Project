What be this beast here that lies deep asleep right in the heart of me?
They say I'm not the person that I used to be but I don't know what's changed me

[Pre-chorus:]
Today (today) it feels right to let go of everything I know
Release (release) the reins and just let it go (go go)

[Chorus:]
And I can't take this pain I'm holding back the storm
But can you tell me what we're fighting for
And why am I to blame? I've been here before
But can you tell me what we're fighting for

There's more to me cause now I'm changed
No longer will I be the one to bare the pain
You pushed and pushed until you knocked me down
But I'll catch you on the rebound
This is the last time that I close my eyes
If I were you I'd run and hide
Cause I'm coming for you

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Fade to grey
You can't hideaway

[Chorus]

No longer will I be the enemy
Break down the walls you built around me (what we're fight for)
No fear inside I set my soul free (what we're fighting for)
What we're fighting for
No longer will I be the enemy
Break down the walls you built around me (what we're fight for)
No fear inside I set my soul free (what we're fighting for)
