They creep in on you even as you dream
Making you believe its exactly what it seems
They're gonna get you someday
And there's no running away
They're deep beneath your skin where they've always been
No one is safe - No one is safe

[Chorus]
Falling in your sleep, don't wake up, just hit the ground
It's real but you don't realize, you're dead you only act alive

Their right here looking through your eyes
And it's not you it's them in your disguise
And they become you today
And now you can't break away
You were such an easy prey
You just hand your life away

No one is safe -No one is safe

[Chorus]
Falling in your sleep, don't wake up, just hit the ground
It's real but you don't realize, you're dead you only act alive
Running in your dreams, don't wake up, you will be found
It's real but you don't realize, you have to live to be alive

Wake me (Wake me up)
It's time to stand up &amp; fight for life
It's time to stand up its time to wake up
It's real but you don't realize

[Chorus]
Falling in your sleep, don't wake up, just hit the ground
It's real but you don't realize, you're dead you only act alive
Running in your dreams, don't wake up, you will be found
It's real but you don't realize, you have to live to be alive

Falling in your dreams wake up
Wake up this is real
You have to live to be alive - Be alive
