My plight has have fallen on deaf ears
But you don't hear
In shallow graves we lay
Living as all we decay
I bury all remarks
But they lay waiting in the dark
I feel your hands around my throat
I feel your hands around my throat

[Chorus]
I can't live life
I can't live life this way I can't carry the weight
I can't live life
I can't live life this way I cannot compensate

Your oppression cuts me to the bone
I've always known
I'm not heard
There are only so many  words
I bury all my remarks
But they lay waiting in the dark
I feel your hands around my throat
I feel your hands around my throat

[Chorus]
I can't live life
I can't live life this way I can't carry the weight
I can't live life
I can't live life this way I cannot compensate

You can't hold me down
I stand my ground

My plight has have fallen on deaf ears
I convey myself  but you don't hear
In shallow graves we lay
Living as all we decay
I bury all remarks
But they lay waiting in the dark
I feel your hands around my throat
I feel your hands around my throat

[Chorus]
I can't live life
I can't live life this way I can't carry the weight
I can't live life
I can't live life this way I cannot compensate
