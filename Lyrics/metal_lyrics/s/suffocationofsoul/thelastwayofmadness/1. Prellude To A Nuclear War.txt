Beginning of century twenty one a nuclear menace took account of planet
Terrorism, chemical armies uncertainty of a future bellow of sky in black smoke 
We are lowermost particles without dimension of danger in a bomb dominated for hate 
Prelude to a nuclear war prelude to a nuclear war

Beginning of a devastated century that begin with disgrace 
Day after day the man is his worst enemy for sovereignty with the days count
Prelude to a nuclear war prelude to a nuclear war

We are living the worst days in the fall of arm armistice 
The third world is an hostage at the hands of the nation more powerful.
Prelude to a nuclear war prelude to a nuclear war
