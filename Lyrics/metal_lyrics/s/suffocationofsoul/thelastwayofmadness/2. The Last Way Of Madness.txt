Midnight walk in the streets on ruins of a life without destiny search the death
Share the pain with the black sky of night from the past comes the storms
An horror squad that torture the soul lost hear bells of a church
Funeral song of disgrace and death all good things come to an end
Tears they flow for a world very wrong where all curse is throw on our lives
Bringing despair the depression the madness and death
Just the end, behind of gates this life there is fate interrupt who goes pay for all suffering?
The mind and the body ruins donât search answers
The last way of madness terrible prison
Lost in the shadows of sadness torment terror

Two steps for abyss is the end of reason a history of suffering pass before eyes
Like in a war where all is tragedy the vision of hell with the damned
Screaming and keep the fire burning enter madness rest in despair
The blade fell blood of wrist the body donât feel more pain in desperate search for death

The last way of madness live is a intense agony
Lost in the shadows of sadness the end is only solution
See in mirror a dead image trapped in yourself freedom for choose die
Free chains of fate the summons bells of death will chime
