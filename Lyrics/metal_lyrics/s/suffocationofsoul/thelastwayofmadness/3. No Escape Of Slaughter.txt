Rituals of magic and intense pleasures burnt in bonfire of the ignorance
Massacred for fanatics assassins laws
Solitaries in a full moon night not there is a waste of time
Searching the perfect magic the wizards are united for revenge
In the night of the curse guardians of evil search the head of their enemies

Sacrifices of cursed bodies this blood is of demons homicide celebration
No escape of slaughter the past hide cruel crimes violent persecutions
The blind faith without mercy the ancient winds brings the spirits until here
Hears in the darkness the voices saying all crime has a judgement
