welcome to my world twisted and cold
It's too late now there is no return
Shadows of humanity drives me mad and it reflects the hatred inside
There is no hope for this existence,anhillation is my deliverance

innocence is not a part of me anymore
I can't stand to see this disguting world
Misanthropy floods my mind
eternal resentment burns through my eyes

Nuclear thoughts,life circle revolution
for humanity there is only one solution
Destroying nature of life,diffrent races denied.
The Final war will merge from our destructive nature
as we bring hell on earth,weapons of murder and self destruction.
will end existence in the final war

innocence no longer part of me anymore
I can't stand to see this fucking world
Misanthropy floods my mind
eternal resentment burns through my eyes
