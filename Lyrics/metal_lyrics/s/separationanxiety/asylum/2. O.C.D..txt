Possesed by demons
gained through the exprience of life
No,can not reach my knife.
trapped inside this hell,haunted by the
sickest thoughts,possesed under a spell as
reallity distorts.

Rage has taken over me,Im going berserk,
locked inside those chains,those chains of the darkness

Madness has taken over me Im going insane
Injection reached my body through the veins

Injection shot,against my will,can it make,
the demons go away?Tranquillized for
a peroid of time,but the demons
still posses me from inside

Rage has taken over me,Im going berserk,
locked inside those chains,those chains of the darkness

Madness has taken over me Im going insane
Injection reached my body through the veins

Trapped in assylum
trapped here for life
