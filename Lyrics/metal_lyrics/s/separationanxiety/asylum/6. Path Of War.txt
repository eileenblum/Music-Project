There's a spell on this land
A curse of eternal war
Evil power makes its dwellers
Venomous to their core

Deserter! Traitor! You're in my domain
On your life I shall not spare
When darkness falls I will bring you pain
I challenge you, see if you dare

Restless souls are running free
On this bleeding land, obscure and damned
I've come to show you the light
I've come to succeed where he failed

I will put this to an end soon, my dear
My presence you must caused you fear
Nothing escapes from my terrorizing sight
You will not live to see the morning light

Leading this battle, possessed by wrath
We will fight till out last breath

Possessed by wrath
In darkness we'll bathe
Our life would fade
Were made for death
Show us the path!
