I've been betrayed by my friends
I know that they hate me to the death
they took my power away
there's no need too tay

I know they just can't see
the genious inside of me

Who the fuck needs them I have my own way
There's no need to stay
Inferior production without me.
My art rules supreme

My new circle accept me as their king
They will accept whatever I may bring.
Revenge on the old traitors.
I'll show them all,who is right

Who the fuck needs them I have my own way
There's no need to stay
Inferior production without me.
My art rules supreme

I know they just can't see
the genious inside of me
