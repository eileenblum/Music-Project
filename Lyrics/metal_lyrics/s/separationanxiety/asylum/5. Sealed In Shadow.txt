Aftermidnight when the light is gone
i see the fallen ones rise,and hide
in the shadows
we apair at night so no one can hear our sorrow
were runing away from our past,so we can
rise, we can borrow
moonlight

hear us fallen ones as you
walk through valley of shadows
now your soul belongs to us...
there is no way back to life
this eternty sealed, we are forever
at night

as daylight falls in to the darkness
my heart frezes and sieze of life
i feel agony thats burns me from inside
till my last breath,as we walking through
the shadows,my hate growing deeper
in this valley of misery

now its time to walk throuth the gates of no return
my final words...(Your soul shale burn)
with this hate deep inside,i lost all control
in the shadows i dwell as eternty is long

hear us fallen ones as you
walk through valley of shadows
now your soul belongs to us...
there is no way back to life

hear us fallen ones as you
walk through valley of shadows
now your soul belongs to us...
there is no way back to life

this eternty sealed, we are forever
at night
