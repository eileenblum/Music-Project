Strong, wrong, none
Burning lies in a fisheye
Lying down in a background
Falling around in a blue sky
Lightning apple-time

Loving new stars
A concrete mass
Relieve then
A using eye
Moving new arts
A plasma blues
Believe in
Raining signs

I won't lies
To deliver schyzo ants
I won't burn
To believe in coloured dreams

Skin, trim, noise
Lightly faith for a canvas
Lonely white and nothing on
Sinking down on a scary time
Painting giant-size

Na ve new arts
A living truth
Relieve then
A science eye
Loving old blues
Modern fake stars
Believe in
Coming signs

I won't lies
To deliver schyzo ants
I won't burn
To believe in coloured dreams

I won't die to kill the thrill
Let them die before they're right
Feel the lies and see those fakes
Feel my eyes and see my real gods

Epileptic modernartistic non-beliver
Epileptic modernartistic non-beliver
