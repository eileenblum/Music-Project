Landing... on a spheric line they dare to drive
Breathing... a scarry sign of sodium lies
Slyness... a primal moral conflict form
Sadness... a linked device reacts

Red sand cloaked over the clouds
Time's forest infinite place

Slyness... in a plasma sphere you are
Sadness... in a liquid form we die

Trapped into
A shapeless cup
A dense cluster of souls
Mineral skies
Beyond shiny haze
Synthetized to decant souls
Awakening

The perfect symbion makes
Mortal frequencies
Navigates through the waves
A new essence rules

[Lyrics Cryopsis]
