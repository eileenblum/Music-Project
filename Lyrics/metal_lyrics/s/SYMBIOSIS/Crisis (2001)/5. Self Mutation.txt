Universe of strangers
Who love and tear eachothers
On a medium chaos i
Wear illusion's soul

Have you been aware of it
Hanging over all the walls
Lightly on the twilight glow
Sweeping crystal rules

Behind hundred walls
I can see the silence
Behind hundred souls
Can you see my patience

Mutilation soul
Fear and live emotions
On a massive sweety light
Scary dragon eye

Clearing endless mighty night
Opening my sleeping eyes
Feeling rising memories
Kissing crystal fools

Behind walls of time
I can see my mind
Behind golden's soul
Can you feel outside

[Lyrics Corrosive Bob]
