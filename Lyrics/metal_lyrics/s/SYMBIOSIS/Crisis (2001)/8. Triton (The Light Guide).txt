My friend so you are here too
Don't be ashamed to say that
He is inside of you too
It is so good to me

To feel his
Poetic madness

The light guides
The bright brides
I need those
Streaming thighs

Come on my friend
Will be the absolute man
The fairy herself
Will be fecundate
By our light guide

My eyes can see evermore
I only need those two ones
To appreciate my destiny
To control anything

Thank you father
For so much power

The light guides
The bright brides
I need those
Streaming thighs

Come on my friend
Will be the absolute man
The fairy herself
Will be fecundate
By our light guide

Abyssal light he is
Infectious speech he has
His strange parish i like
Tonight i'll sleep in the sin
