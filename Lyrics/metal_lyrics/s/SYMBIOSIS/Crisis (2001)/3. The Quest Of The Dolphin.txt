Here i am again
After torments of anguish
I'm lucky at this moment to
Be able to remain

Waiting for the course of things

There's evaluation
And then simply to
Let oneself hear
The answer within

Are two methods bleeding together forever more ?

And i'm able to discern,
In fact i really ask to
Myself the question
I look for inspiration

Interruption of it all
I've read a tarot
The question inside my mind
Seated in the tower of destruction

Searching for the most correct word

This word is linked to the cosmos
By the quill of the past
Which is going to open
Doors of non being

Opened to listen to the hanged man it seems to really say

That i'm able to discern,
In fact i really learn from
Myself the question
I look for inspiration

Thrill

I'm gonna try in hope to find
At last inner answers of the past
Logical order of human plurality
And ideas deep down myself

Nothing Stronger than the quest
Now I'm powerfull to reach the abyssal point

I'm trapped forever in the acid sea
The harmless dolphin is my friend
Can I swim to him
I'm looking for the star
I'm looking for the fool
The lighly star, the mighty fool
