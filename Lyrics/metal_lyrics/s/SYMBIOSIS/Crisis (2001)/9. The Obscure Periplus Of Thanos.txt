Running... towards fields unfertile
Spreading... terror over all
Life becomes obscure under my feet
Humility becomes pride after my arrival

You don't see me
You don't hear me
But I'm here

Observing your strange dance and rituals
Observing your every moves
I'm waiting
I'll get you
It's a question of time

I've received, here the best and the greatest
Greeping... in the wingdings of night
Don't touch the shadows or
You will be infected

Your head, your eyes
Your hands, your legs
Belong to me 'till birth

Observing your strange dance and rituals
Observing your every moves
I'm waiting
I'll get you
It's a question of time

At least approaching my funeral ornament
Let my hand lay on your shoulder
You're feeling right now
I got you for ever...
