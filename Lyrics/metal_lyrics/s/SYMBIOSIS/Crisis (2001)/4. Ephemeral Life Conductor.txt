The crippled dolphin
Show me the way to send my life
Ondulations, ondulations

My Entire body
Is liquid so I'll be the violator
And torture his skeleton

Tenreide Spadipheris
Genatca Eridius

Everlasting
Transparancy
Through I can see them all, transparency

Of the light Steel
Called Intraneo Solidium
Tomorrow won't be, cause I'm Ephemeral

Tenreide Spadipheris
Genatca Eridius

I die, you live
My water wrings are
Already evaporate
My being is your birth

Can you feel me
Penetrate your cells
Ephemeral
Life Conductor

Intraneo
Solidium
Ephemeral
Life Conductor
