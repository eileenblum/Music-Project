Atmosphear is humid now
Skins under control
Her taste is so pure
Wanna swallow her sweetness

This little piece of flesh
Neverending pleasure
Fifteen and a climax to go

Little princess
You're the one
Be my pride

Vaginal tears dropped
By serpent moves
Oral fluid help
Us 'till asphyxia comes

This woman attitude
In this fragile body
Increase my desire

You're the one
Be my pride

The end of a climax
Feeling of realization
I'm your light guide
And you're my pride
