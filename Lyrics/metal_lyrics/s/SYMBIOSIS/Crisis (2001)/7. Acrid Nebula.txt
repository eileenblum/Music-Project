Awaken in acrid clock
Bended string between the eyes
Walking through buried clouds
Into carbon dioxide
Devoid of synchronic signs
New configuration lies
To become a liquid skin
Lightning organic texture

Corpse corrosion Soul corrosion
Corpse corrosion Soul corrosion

Different kind of frequencies
To see what's behind
Explode outside extasy
To be what's beneath

Stare blind to the opaque
Obscured thick horizons
Diving onto a blue fog
To complete the mutation
Float towards acrid nebula
Body confinment collapse
Night and day dissolve

Corpse corrosion Soul corrosion
Corpse corrosion Soul corrosion

Different kind of frequencies
To see what's behind
Explode outside extasy
To be what's beneath

A sea of destiny
A rose of sufferings

Living... under the barrels of flesh
All... difformed vision lies
I... always walking through the blind
Infinity... space ad continuum

Different kind of frequencies
To see what's behind
Explode outside extasy
To be what's beneath
