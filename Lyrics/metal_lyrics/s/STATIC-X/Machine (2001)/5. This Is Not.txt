Lines and the light stream 
Screaming by me scream 
Burned down 
Not me you see me suffer 
Haunted by your spirit 
Undead by your spit 
Taunted by yourself alive 

Dazed and burning state 
Hazed and spinning fate 
Dazed and burning 
I say I can't come 
You say this ain't home 
Hating this I mouth your name 

This is not my life 
This is not my home 
This is not me 
I hate this 

Your voice in my mind 
Come home it ain't time 
Burned down 
Not me you see me suffer 
Solace to inspire 
Lowness to my life 
Taunted by yourself alive 

Dazed and burning state 
Hazed and spinning fate 
Dazed and burning 
I say I can't come 
You say this ain't home 
Hating this I mouth your name
