Get to the gone 
Under the gun 
Drop in drop out 
Get to the gone 

Get to the gone 
It's just the way you wanna be 
Under the gun 
It's just the way to be 
Drop in drop out 
To begin with it's killing me 
Killing the one thing 
I know this to be 

I fly I fly 
Around the word 
Through the night sky 
I feel the end 
Relations die 
One mile 
Ten thousand miles 
Makes no difference 
Changes more changes 

Get to it 
Get to the gone 
You get to it 
Get to become 

A relic 
A cynic 
An addict 
Automatic destruction 

Get to it 
Get to the gone 
You get to it 
Get to become 
The static 
The metal 
The hell 
Got to get it 
Sensation
