Heavy solid metal
Shift it into go mode
Hit the skinny pedal
Make a violation

Gasoline (Check)
Ignition (Check)
Compression (Check)
Cranking (Check)
Sensation (Check)
Relation (Check)
Connection (Check)
Burn the tires up

God damn it
I don't believe
At all
Just slam it
(And drive like I stole it)
Wide fucking
Open the throttle
Just hold on
And I don't care

Open four barrels
Push it to the red line
Dying for a reason
Harnessing the screeching

Gasoline (Check)
Ignition (Check)
Compression (Check)
Cranking (Check)
Sensation (Check)
Relation (Check)
Connection (Check)
Blow the fucker up

God damn it
I don't believe
At all
Just slam it
(Now the fucking pigs are after me)
Wide fucking
Open the throttle
Just hold on
And I don't care
