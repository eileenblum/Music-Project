Terminal head hard under fire
Hard crunch gate over rate
Anything goes
Trip hop chill out overtake under rate
Take a couple pills
I got nothing more to lose

Put a fist through
Through the window
Take an eight bit
Over sample
I'm a speed freak
Devil angel
Try to hold on
When I slam it to the floor

Beat down
Fire it up
Burned out Z28
Iron clad big block
Old carburetor
Try to keep it on a straight line
Burn those slicks
Brawler crawler
Keep it on  the red line
Take another shot
I got nothing to lose

Put a fist through
Through the window
Take an eight ball
Oversample
Aspiration
Rehabilitation
Try to hold on
When I slam it to the floor
