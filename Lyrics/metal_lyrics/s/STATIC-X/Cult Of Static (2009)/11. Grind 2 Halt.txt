Pitch slap deep space techno echo
Gate and filter the thoughts
Short break electric scramble
Take what you thought was yours
Tribal bible punching metal
Black fills up every knot
Scratch up synthetic substance
Break up the fall

Grind 2 halt
Slam it shut
Never stop
Make the cut

Carve confusion bright illusion
Drive to burn up the road
Visions begin to glow
It starts to heavy the load
Still I'm liable twist in my side
Black fills up every knot
Scratch up synthetic substance
Break up the fall
