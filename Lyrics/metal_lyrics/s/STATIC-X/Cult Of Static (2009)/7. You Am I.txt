Train of thought is what you see
Beautiful screamer
Take a beating
Take it all
You take it deeper
Give me everything with your intensity
A demolition champion
It's all conditioned

You scream for me
Fill me up with everything
Get me high when I'm low
You am I
I am you
Worship me
I worship you
Our time is endless
Driven to the burning you
They cannot stop us now
Seeing is believing
I am bleeding for you
Drink it up
Take me in
We are one

Sense of thought
Thought of touch
Touch of you will
Tap my veins
