End
Burning lips
Keeping me
Forever counting the days
Nights
Hands untied
Screaming from beneath
The end

Nocturnally
Turning to the blackest
Internally
Rolling beneath it
No looking back
No one there to tame us
Our dying breed
Take me to the dark

Fire out
Still I see
What I have come for
The wait
Fight
Battle grounds
Keep me from the dark

Nocturnally
Turning to the blackest
Come back to me
Peel away the layers
So I can see
Turn the wheel faster
So far away
I can feel you coming
