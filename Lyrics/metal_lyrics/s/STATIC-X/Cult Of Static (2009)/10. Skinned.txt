Skinned from within
I'm infected
Toxic locked in
Rejected spreading thin
Turn it all around
Diffusing scene
Re-arranging
Stronger than all
As my fortune sets in

Twenty-five pounds that were weighing me down
Pounds of restlessness
Had to kill the innocents
The body eats itself from the inside out
Losing my voice
Was it worth the fucking price

Stretched to the limit
Peeling ignite
Taking me slowly
It's close and tight
Stretched to the limit
Peeling ignite
Taking me slowly
I'm skinned alive
