Motion range arpeggiate
The decimator bend rage
Oscillate assimilate
The agitator depth cage
Modulate the head space
Parallel the universe
Transpose this face
Compress all

Trip myself up
I stand alone
Take myself out
I cut the throat
Trip myself up
Shuffle it slow
Take myself out
Time to reload

Shift the pitch up
Phase the noise out
Scan the record
Throw the bitch out
