Spinning and whirling
Descending unending
Light the halo
Watch the day glow
Spiral is viral
I'm seeing believing
Dig the feedback
Take another crack at it

Harder and harder
The hollow deceiver
Hit the noise blox
Smash the ice box
Louder and louder
Forgetting the setting
Kill the digital
Beat the terminal

Go
Take it slow
Let it go
Get down hard
It's terminal

Sensing commencing
The final dismantle
Your confusion
My illusion
Terminal heading
Advance to the hideout
Put the light out
Throw me down, throw me down
