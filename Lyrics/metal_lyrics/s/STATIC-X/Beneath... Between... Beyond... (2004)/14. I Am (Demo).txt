I've been taking abuse and it's senseless
Fist into the wall and it's painless
I've been living the lie that I made me
Live it

Screaming into the mic and I like it
Put it all over the air in thick slices
Soak it all up in your head with the anger
Like it

Older
Elder
I am
(grind on it)
Deeper
Bleaker
I am

Brush the surface off and grind on it

Put a gun in my mouth and threaten to shoot
Justice died here
