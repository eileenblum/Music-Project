She heard it all before
She had a grand design
Barely living on borrowed time
Turn a blind eye to
See the shadow come
Never even notice
Having so much fun

One thing on her ind
It's just fun and games
Scott free
Baby wants to point the blame
Listen up people
Gonna spread the word
Break it down
'Cus you got to be heard

Hey i know i hope she don't crash
Barely living on borrowed time
Never stop to think how or why
An aimless driver lives inside her head
She only needs to have her ego fed

Hey i know i hope she don't crash
