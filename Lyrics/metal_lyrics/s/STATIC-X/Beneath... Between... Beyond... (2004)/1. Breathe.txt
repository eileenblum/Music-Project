Regrets
I ran away I froze
(so frozen cold)
All bets
I turned my back
My heart, it closed
( I turn to stone)
Undone
I put my head into my hands
(my broken hands)
Not won
I did not want to understand

Breathe for me
Breathe in me
Breathe

I can
I cannot feel I cannot see
(I cannot see)
I got
This feeling hanging over me
(hung over me)
I can
I cannot feel you take a breathe
(one final breath)
I got
I got this feeling,kiss of death

Still i fade, Still I fade
Away,away.
