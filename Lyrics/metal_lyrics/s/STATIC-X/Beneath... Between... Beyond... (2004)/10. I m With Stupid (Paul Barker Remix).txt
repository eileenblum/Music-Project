Great pains
I've gone to gang slang
I've gone to lame brain
Looking for gold I
I have become someone else
Outside stepping to inside
Stepping to my side
Stepping I wade through shit

He's a loser
He's a loser, she said

I am mine, I am mine
I am mine, I am mine
I am mine, I
I can't become someone else

He's a loser
He's a loser, she said
He's a loser
He's a loser, she said
