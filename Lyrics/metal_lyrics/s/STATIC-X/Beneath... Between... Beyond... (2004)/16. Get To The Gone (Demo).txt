Get to the gone
Under the gun
Drop in drop out
Get to the gone

Get to the gone
It's just the way you wanna be
Under the gun
It's just the way to be
Drop in drop out
To begin with it's killing me
Killing the one thing
I know this to be

I fly I fly
Around the word
Through the night sky
I feel the end
The end is near
Relations die
One mile
Ten thousand miles
Makes no difference
Changes more changes

Get to the gone
Under the gun
Drop in drop out
Get to the gone

Get to the gone
It's just the way you wanna be
Under the gun
It's just the way to be
Drop in drop out
To begin with it's killing me
Killing the one thing
I know this to be
