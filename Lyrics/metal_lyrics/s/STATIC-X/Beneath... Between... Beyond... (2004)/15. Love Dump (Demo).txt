Hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line hand me a line
Really hand it to me I've always loved you
Love dumpling
Your shit's like chocolate cake
And your ass smells like a rose

I really hate you
Love dumpling
Now my bowels ache

Drop down in a line
Really hand me a line, really hand me a line
Hand me a line, really hand it to me
