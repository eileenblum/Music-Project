Never fear
Never fear to meet the resistance
Walk with me though don't mind the distance

To avoid all collected
Disinfect the affected
Just to feel this connection

Feel, feel
Walk by me

To avoid all collected
Disinfect the affected
Just to feel this connection

Driving it down
Tearing it down
Break it down
Drive it.
