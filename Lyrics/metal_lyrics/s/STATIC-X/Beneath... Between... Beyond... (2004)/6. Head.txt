You enveloped in your
You enveloped in your head
Justify it in your
Justify it in your head

Head
(yet we speed)
I know what I've got to
Head
(to frighten ends)
Said I know what I've got to do

See the savage in me
Savage the savage in my head
I'm all you claim to be
I'm head

I'm old
I'm wasted
I've come full circle.
