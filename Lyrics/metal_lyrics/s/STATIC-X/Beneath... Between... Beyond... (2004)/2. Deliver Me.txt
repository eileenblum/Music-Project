Ripping at the soul
Scrathing it for more
Ripping at the soul
Unattainable goal

Giving into sin
Getting out of pain
Burning in the sun
I'm drowing in the rain
Rain

Fate, deliver me to
My final destination

Sometimes it's too dark
Seek this light of truth
Sometimes hard to find
Don't die without a fight
Fight

Fate, deliver me to
My, final destination
Deliver me 'cause I
I've got my reasons

Giving into sin
Getting out of pain
Burning in the sun
Drowning in the rain
It's not too late
I've got my fate.
