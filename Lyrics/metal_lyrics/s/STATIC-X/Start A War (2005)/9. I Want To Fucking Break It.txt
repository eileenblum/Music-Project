This one's for the assholes
This one's for the freaks
This one's for the stupid fuckers
Trying to keep me incomplete

They can't take me outside
They can't take me down
They can't take my thoughts 'cause
I will smash their face into the ground

I want to fucking break it

Feel this anger building
Feel this blow your mind
Feel this break the silence
I can't keep my hate pent up inside

They can't take me outside
They can't take me down
They can't take my thoughts 'cause
I will smash their face into the ground

I want to fucking break it
I want to crush you from the inside
I got no time to fake it
I got no time to waste with your kind

Take this for the last time
Take this for release
This one's for my enemies
You know who you are
Fuck off, please

I want to fucking break it
