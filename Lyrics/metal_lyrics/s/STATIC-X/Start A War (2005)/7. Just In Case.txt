Keep my around, waiting behind glass
In case you need, I'll be your piece of ass
Pretend to want me, string me along
Break glass if needed, you can make me crawl

'Cause you make me feel like a dog
You can't see my emotion
Is this for real?
I'm a man sinking deep

I was strung out for such a long, long time (time)
Now I own myself, yes I am mine (mine)
No longer will I be your just in case (just in case)
No longer you shit do I need to taste (taste)

'Cause you make me feel like a dog
You can't see my emotion
Is this for real?
I'm a man sinking deep in the ocean

I don't wanna be your just in case boy
I don't wanna be your just in case
Oh no
I don't wanna be your just in case boy
I don't wanna be your just in case

I don't wanna be your just in case boy
I don't wanna be your just in, I don't wanna be your
I don't wanna be your just in case boy
I don't wanna be your just in case

'Cause you make me feel, like a dog
You can't see my emotion
Is this for real?
I'm a man sinking deep in the ocean

'Cause you make me feel, like a dog
You can't see my emotion
Is this for real?
Is this for real?
Is this for real?
