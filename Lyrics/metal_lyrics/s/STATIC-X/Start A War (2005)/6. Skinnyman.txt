My little girl
Where are you?
My fucked up world
Destroyed you
Day after day
Day after day
I get it now
I just go on without you
Twisted inside
Six miles high
I rehearse how to
Say goodbye to you

Skinnyman
Turned into a monster
I'm a motherfucker

Wrap it up tight
Emotions are distorted
It's no surprise
Nothing alive
All hope has been aborted
Day after day
Day after day
I get it now
I just go on without you
Twisted inside
Six miles high
I rehearse how to
Say goodbye to you

Skinnyman
Turned into a monster
I'm a mother fucker
Inside I'm dead
All used up
God damn I miss her

As my skin turns yellow
I forget this hell
As the skies are bruised
And the rain comes down
As my face turns pale
Try to deal with these thoughts
At the end of it all
I still miss you
