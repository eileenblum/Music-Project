Confine me it's all that I see
Sickness keeps you following me
Kept it inside, all that is sharp
Held it inside, all that is dark

Tear
I'll shut you up

Down, down, down
I'll destroy you
Kill or be killed
Down, down, down
You've become the enemy
Enemy

I thank you for making me feel
Make me feel like I want to kill
You show me you're evil inside
Now won't you just curl up and die

Tear
I'll shut you up

Down, down, down
I'll destroy you
Kill or be killed
Down, down, down
You've become the enemy
Enemy

You make me
You make me hate
You make me
You make me hate
