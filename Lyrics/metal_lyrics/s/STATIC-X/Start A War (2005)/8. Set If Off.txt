Wait every hour of everyday
Played light, played hard
Had to go my way
I feel like death wearing a disguise
Can't catch my breath
From all this noise

I want
I'm fucking bored
Give me a new found sensation
Take it
Take all the pills
I'll try anything to get me off
Come on
Kicked in he ass
Why do you tell me I can't?
Fake it
I can't go on
Give me anything to set it off

I bite your tongue
Watch with keen eyes
I found the gun
Nervous excitement
Go on and touch it
You just might like
I sip you poison one last time

My confidence is all that's left
Under this veil I count the minutes
I'm growing weaker
Search for a glimmer
Pulsating sounds come blaring out
You may be right
My mind is gone
I'll try anything to set this off
Set it off

Set it off
Anything to set it off
