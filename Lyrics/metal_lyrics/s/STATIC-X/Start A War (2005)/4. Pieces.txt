I found a piece of
What I want to find
I got a taste of
What's on the outside
I feel it pounding
I feel it bending
I feel it breaking
Breaking me inside

I got
Not yet
Smash my
Fucking fist
(My frustration)

My body, my mind, my soul and my life
So far, so near, so hard, so clear
My body, my mind, my soul and my life
Too far to go, too high, too low

Killing me inside
Take a drink forget
Chemical passion
Drowning my defect
I feel it pounding
I feel it bending
I feel it breaking
All that is perfect

I got
Not yet
Smash my
Fucking fist
(my frustration)

My body, my mind, my soul and my life
So far, so near, so hard, so clear
My body, my mind, my soul and my life
Too far to go, too high, too low

Frustrated, frustrated......
