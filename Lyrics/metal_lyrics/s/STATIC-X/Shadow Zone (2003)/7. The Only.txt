I'm winning, you're losing
I'm falling, your agony
Lower than lower, before
Your forgotten memory

My heaven, your hell
I'm killing, your fantasy
More and more, you follow
Your deepest reality

You're trying to take me
You're trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
Tired of trying
I'm tired of lying
The only thing I understand is what I feel

Identity, fantasy
Heresy, killing me
Lower than lower, before
This thing to feed

Hypocrite, lunatic
Fanatic, heretic
More and more, you follow
Your deepest reality

You're trying to take me
You're trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
Tired of trying
I'm tired of lying
The only thing I understand is what I feel

Hypocrite, lunatic, fanatic, heretic
