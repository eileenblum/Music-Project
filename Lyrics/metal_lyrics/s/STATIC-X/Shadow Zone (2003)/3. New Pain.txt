Misdirected, I'm awakened
Manifests in, into my head
I feel new pain, becoming part
Of my every, every moment now

New Pain - you told me you wanted and hated me
New Pain - you kill me now this becomes part

I'm so sure I'm, so confused I'm
All things to you, nothing to you
I feel new pain, in these shadows
Of my every, every moment now

New Pain - you told me you wanted and hated me
New Pain - you kill me now this becomes part
New Pain - you told me you wanted and hated me
New Pain - you kill me now this becomes part

You told me that you wanted me
You told me you hate me
Tear for our suffering
Told me that I'm the one
You wanted to kill me
And now it makes this all ugly
Becomes part of me
Turning into this new pain

Your horse I ride, bite down hard
And now I suffer
My heart to my mind it burns
Rips it hurt, it kills
