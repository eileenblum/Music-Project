Breathing, killing, seething, willing
Fighting, biting, hating, waiting for you
Don't you, won't you, don't lie

Give it, get it, live it, let it
Dedicated, nothing sacred for you
Don't you, won't you, I die

Wreak havoc, I'm crippled
Your polluted soul, is so corrupted

In your eyes, see all the lies
The alibis, That I despise
In your eyes, see all the lies
The alibis, That I despise
In your eyes, all the lies
Alibis, I despise
See the lies, spirit dies
Your disguise, Monster size

Breathing, killing, seething, willing
Fighting, biting, hating, waiting for you
I don't know why I try

Give it, get it, live it, let it
Dedicated, nothing sacred for you
I can't see you I'm blind

Wreak havoc, I'm crippled
Your polluted soul, is so corrupted

In your eyes, see all the lies
The alibis, That I despise
In your eyes, see all the lies
The alibis, That I despise
In your eyes, all the lies
Alibis, I despise
See the lies, spirit dies
Your disguise, Monster size

Wreak havoc, I'm crippled
Erasing, Refacing
So worthless, no mercy
Your polluted soul, is so corrupted
