Everybody, soul and body cold
All this sickness, you lost control
You can't get it
You just don't get it, no
You can't get it
You got zero

Look within me, am I evil enough
Memories bring tears of years old
You can't get it
You just don't get it, no
You can't get it
You got zero

Life - you take it
Lies - you fake it
Suffer - within me
Torn - you break it
Life - control it
Lies - withhold it
Suffer - you're skinny
Torn - you're wasted

Kids with defects
We're all rejects, so
Don't forget it, cold inside
You can't get it
You just don't get it, no
You can't get it
You got zero

Break this take control
Take this I control it
Break this take control
Take this I control it
