Drowning myself, over and over
Desolate, trying it's over

Why so cynical in life
You think you're living to die
All in wait, all in wait

Burning inside, long for answers
Makes no sense, trying it's over

Why so cynical in life
You think you're living to die
All in wait
Step down and smile at this fool
The believes his own word
All in wait

Now I'm drowning myself over and over
Makes no sense we're trying but you say it's over
Burning inside as we long for the answers
Desolate we're trying but you say it's over
