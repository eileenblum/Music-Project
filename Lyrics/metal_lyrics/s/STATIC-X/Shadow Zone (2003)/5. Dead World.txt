Look down around
All is not well
Victim of change
Far out of range
A is non-A
Be or be not
See what I see
Get what I got

Sometimes I wish I could see beyond this dead world
Sometimes I wish I could see beyond me
Dead world

King of my world
This rule I break
King of my world
I eat my cake
A is non-A
Be or be not
See what I see
Get what I got

Sometimes I wish I could see beyond this dead world
Sometimes I wish I could see beyond me
Dead world

Softly, angry, bitter, killer
Torn flesh, more less, ears curled
Dead World
