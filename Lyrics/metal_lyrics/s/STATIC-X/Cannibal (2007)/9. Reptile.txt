Shedding your skin
Itâs falling to pieces
Feeling within
Body is cold
Cold to the bone
Bestial sin
Youâre trying to keep it
Feeling within
Spirit is old.

Let me in
It never can happen
Bitting me with a poisonous mouth
A venomous shout.

Tear me apart
Chewing the gristle
Chewing it up
Spitting me out.

Reptile.
