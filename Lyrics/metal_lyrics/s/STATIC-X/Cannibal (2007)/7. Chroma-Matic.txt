Winding it up
Like a wound metal fuzz box
Tuning it up
Make your neck bent down
Plugging it in
To the primary noise box
Making it raw
Make your brain shut down.

Origin know
To the few chroma-matic
It shakes your ayes
And it shocks you wide
Tuning it down
To the end note
Feedback
Fuzzback
Head scratch
Phase loop
Heart attack.

Chroma-matic.

Origin know
To the few chroma-matic
It shakes your ayes
And it shocks you wide
Tuning it down
To the end note
Feedback
Full stack
Head crack
Slam that Cadillac.

Chroma-matic.
