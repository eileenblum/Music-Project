Itâs time to melt you down
Itâs time to strap you in
Your mindâs abut to be disminished.

I scream to get me off
Air blast to pull you in
You feel the atrophy.

Electric
Electric pulse.

Nightmares to shut you down
Static to keep you in
Darkness what you donât see
Atomic.

Shockwave to set you off
Itâs time to throw the switch
Itâs time that you receive.

Electric
Electric pulse.
