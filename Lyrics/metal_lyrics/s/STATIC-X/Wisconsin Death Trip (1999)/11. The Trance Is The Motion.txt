speed toward hell
shed no tears
you don't know me
take my life
steal my tongue
to defeat your taste
could never criticize
no better then me
better then you
it's easier to lie
than to tell the truth
you've become the waste that i despise

this is the motion of the new revolution

the trance is the motion
