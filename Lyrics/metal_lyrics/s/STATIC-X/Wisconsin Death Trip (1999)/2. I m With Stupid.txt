great pains
i've gone to gang slang
i've gone to lame brain
looking for gold i
i have become someone else
outside stepping to inside
stepping to my side
stepping i wade through shit

he's a loser
he's a loser, she said

i am mine, i am mine
i am mine, i am mine
i am mine, i
i can't become someone else

he's a loser
he's a loser, she said
he's a loser
he's a loser, she said
