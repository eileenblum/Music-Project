i've been taking abuse and it's senseless
fist into the wall and it's painless
i've been living the lie that i made me
live it

screaming into the mic and i like it
put it all over the air in thick slices
soak it all up in your head with the anger
like it

older
elder
i am
(grind on it)
deeper
bleaker
i am

brush the surface off and grind on it

put a gun in my mouth and threaten to shoot

justice died here
