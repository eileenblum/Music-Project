Corrosive tainted by my sin
I'm spilling blood
And I can hardly contain it
Corrosive hallowing the hand
Stiffened I eat away
Eat, eat into the surface

Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!

Explosive more violent more violent
All consuming throbbing
Straight to the circle
Explosive move on reaction
I slow it down I slow it
Down, down, down, down, down

Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!

I see it. I need it
I see it. I need it
I see it. I need it
I see it. I need it

I see it. I need it
I see it. I need it
I see it. I need it
I see it. I need it

My mind is corrosive
I trip on corrosive
I freak
See through me
My eyes are explosive
I feed on it
Black out
Crucify me

Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!

Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
Yeah! you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!
You... you push it!
