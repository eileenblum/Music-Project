what's wrong
don't you sing dong ding dong
push it the phoney
hook it up and ride away
motion
can't you feel the motion
you can see right through me
we connect
you're a part of me

take this
break the vibe and make this
get up on it
oh yeah
close your eys and fly away
motion
can't you feel the motion
you can see right through me
we connect
you're a part of me

get up on this wiscosin death trip
get on it

take me
clear your mind and make me
feel me inside oh yeah
you can have me anyway
motion
can't you feel the motion
you can see right through me
we connect
you're a part of me
