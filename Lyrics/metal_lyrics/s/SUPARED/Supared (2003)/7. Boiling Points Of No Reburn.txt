[Kiske]

I get lost in the rush of cities
Do you feel the push of sure or maybe
Do we know it better
Is it forever or crazy
I got a thing just for me
It says: free me

We change it now
There is a boiling point and we've past it
There's no somehow
Don't give us fun or your: none or just maybe
What's your life about?

Do we feel the blame
Or some shame if we get there
Would it be the same 
If we all came from nowhere
I got a thing just for me
It says: free me
If you got your own
It's not blown
Will you join me?

[Refrain:]

Has your brain departed?
Has your fading started?
Will you end cold hearted?
In your hands you've got it

[Refrain:]
