[Kiske]

I can't explain
I'm running all over
Their wasted pain
I don't seem to know how
Their suffering works
I won't do the big bow
In front of jerks
In front of jerks

But can I know now [3x]
How you do it 
Will you show how [2x], Can I know now
How to get us through it 
God

I got no will 
To eat un-perfection
Contains no thrill
To lie an affection
If I dig deep
Will that reveal beauty
Or just a creep
Or just a creep

[Refrain:]

[Solo]

So I believe I had a good start 
Then you made me crawl 
After all
Let me conceive I want all inner peace
Don't make me fall
Not after all

[Refrain:]
