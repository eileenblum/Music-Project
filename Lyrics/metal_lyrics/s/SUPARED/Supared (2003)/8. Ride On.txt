[Kiske]

Is it you, is it me?
Well it seems I'm on fire
Is it true? You believe,
Just the beast gets us higher
Follow me! On the edge I do the dare

Don't just weak it out or let it all fade away
We cracked our faith enough and I feel some good today
Get it ride on 
Get it ride on

Can you see all burned out
It's field full of doubts
I was free, I was fine
So to speak was all mine
Follow me! On the edge I do the dare

Don't just weak it out or let it all fade away
We cracked our faith enough and I feel some good today
Get it ride on
Get it ride on
Get it ride on
Get it ride on

Wednesday the morning was fine
No major heavies on my mind
Tonight's rain did clear up the air
If I freeze those moods, no losing, I swear 

Don't just weak it out or let it all fade away
We cracked our faith enough and I feel some good today 
Get it ride on
We get it ride on
