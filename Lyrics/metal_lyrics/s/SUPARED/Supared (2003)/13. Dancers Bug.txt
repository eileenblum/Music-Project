[Kiske]

It feels kind of bad
At the wrong side of track
Please will you get me back
Don't let me down
I'll try to hide my frown
Don't let me be a clown

There is always a good cause calling
That keeps our own self from falling too deep
It's true we long for salvation
Till then, how to keep us patient?

Don't stare at me
As If I'll never see
As If I'll never be free
A sweet sunny smile
American style
Came across hostile for a while

Major eats up the minor
Comfortably numb I find myself with
All I got to do seems clear now
I got to post off all fear now
