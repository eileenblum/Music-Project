[Giampietro]

This is the way I'm dressed at home
But in this world I do belong
Can you imagine that I'm real
I don't feel sorry, plain I feel

Turn it into all that you're now and be true to yourself
Turn it into all that relies upon the things that seem to be unsafe

Is this the way you look at night
Surely in this world you are right
I can imagine that you're real
In the way that you act and how you deal

Turn it into all that you're now and be true to yourself
Turn it into all that relies upon the things that seem to be unsafe
All that you're now and be true to yourself
Turn it into all that relies upon the things that seem to be unsafe
And now
Everything is clear
The start is now and here

[Solo]

Turn it into all...
