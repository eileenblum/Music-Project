[Kiske]

Ain't we had it all
And more, by now 
Ain't it all had to fall
Come on, somehow

We're still running
Don't stop running

Let's be sun-like, Let's be heroes
Let's be different, Let it all be right
Let's be sun-like, Let's be heroes
Let us win 

It's mediocrity that kills
I told you
Isn't it the enemy, It seeths
And I told you

Let's not run with them
And go down with them

[Refrain: 2x]

I awake
To see me fade
Can not wait
Hey awake
Get away
It's getting late

[Refrain: 4x]
