[Kiske]

He pretends 
No one gets him out of chance
He pretends 
No one will break his defence

He only plays what he's better at
Cause he's better at, what he's better at 
And when he plays, he will make his bet
Cause he is better at it
You better don't forget 

We know, he's the same
He knows, he won't change his game
We see him around
We might watch it all come down

Sweet admits
Had never any means for him
Pleasing gifts
Butt-cream and candies he'll bring 

He only plays what he's better at
Cause he's better at, what he's better at
And when he plays, he will make his bet
Cause he's better at it
You better don't forget

[Refrain:]

We see the face of an innocent angel
All pretending, all demanding more
Part of him will always grin hidden
All pretending, all demanding more

He only plays what he's better at
Cause he's better at, What he's better at 
And when he plays, he will make it best
Cause is better at it
You better don't forget it

[Refrain: 2x]
