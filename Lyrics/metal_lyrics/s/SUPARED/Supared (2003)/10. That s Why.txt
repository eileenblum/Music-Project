[Giampietro/Kiske]

Let's leave our fears
All behind for now
And if we can
Let's stop all thinking about

Everything that's way done
It's burden to our flight
They may say: this road was never tamed by man
That's why it's so beautiful to try ?

Let's not waste time
With all those doubts we had
This blue-eyed innocence
Is needed ahead

It take so little to be small in life
And much more to stand tall
Let 'em say: this mountain is just much too high
That's why it's so beautiful to try
They may say: there is no chance to reach the otherside
That's why it's so beautiful to try
