Broken people
Hollow and feeble
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill
Rotten ingrate
Stupid mistakes
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill
Wishing wells and
cockle shells
They swim
throughout my
head
My eyes are
closing slowly
As I'm lowering my head
Wanting and getting
Silent setting
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill
Robbing and burning
Wasted learning
They're rolling
Rolling up the hill
Wishing wells and
cockle shells
They swim
throughout my
head
My eyes are
closing slowly
As I'm lowering my head
Breaking in
In my eyes
I can't see like this
I can't let go
Please help me down
I can't be like this
Seeing(Fearing) them
Them all around
How can they be so sweet?
Sweet
They panic so
Just hold them down
I could live like this
I'm closing in
Hey, all around
I could be like this
Hearing them
Them in my head
How can they be so sweet?
Sweet
They're all around
Hey, hear me say
They're all around, yeah
They're all around
Hey, hear me say
They're all around, yeah
They're all around
Hey, hear me say
How can they be so sweet?
Sweet
They're all around
(Breaking in)
All around
(In my eyes)
All around
(I can't see like this)
They're all around
(I can't let go)
All around
(Please help me down)
All around
(I can't be like this)
They're all around
(Seeing them)
All around
(Them all around)
They're all around
(How can they be)
They're so sweet
Sweet
