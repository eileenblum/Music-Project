Can you see me going down
I am screaming out loud
And the fear of god
is in me now
Dissolve
In the moonshine
I leave no trace
My visions have gone
Far away from this place
They've dissolved
Can you see me going down
I am screaming out loud
And the fear of god
is in me now
Dissolve
Dissolve
Dissolve
