Slowly she moves underground
Far below is where she is found
Quickly now she's moving up
Seed of need it will erupt
Something is happening
underneath the ground
For she's been waiting to bloom
Thinking and wondering
Of her climb up to the sun
For she's been waiting to bloom
Waiting for her
Thinking now she can't ever get in
Dizzy now from the earth and its spin
Forcing her she must give up
Seed of need it will erupt
Waking so sweetly
The earth she has outgrown
For she's been waiting to bloom
Stretching she's growing
Her time has just begun
For she's been waiting to bloom
Waiting for her
Let me grow
The soil it strangles me
Let me grow
The soil it strangles me
Something is happening
Underneath the ground
For she's been waiting to bloom
Thinking and wondering
Of her climb up to the sun
For she's been waiting to bloom
Waiting to bloom
