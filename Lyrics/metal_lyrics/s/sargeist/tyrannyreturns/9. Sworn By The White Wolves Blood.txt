The end belongs to none but you
Created from dust and empty souls
You'll soon return to the void
A destiny worth of nothing
You all nasty creatures of god
Will regret you ever lived
You the Nazarene, bastard crowned
You shall feel the spear once more

Our kingdom - the night
Everlasting - when humanity ends
For the glory of Satan

And all human your father made
Oh, we'll laugh at their ashes grey
Until the winds from the sea blow it away
In the dark war, endlessly

The moon, the cries of wolves
The ancient times
Only night brings a feeling
To this "human" body of mine
Nothing in common with life
Only death is REAL
