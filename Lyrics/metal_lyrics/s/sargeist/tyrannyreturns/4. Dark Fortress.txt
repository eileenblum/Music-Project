Fires burn yet again
Fed with corpses of the men
Who opposed us and never will be free
They still live for only flames to see

And the old gas chambers
Destroy human life again
Pestilent weak people
Grimly rid with Zyklon-B

You will work force labor
For our engines of war
As the fodder to feed with
To be reaped with war

God's race feeds our cause
Such an irony within
Grim Northern funeral winds
Blow again over lands

No mercy will be shown
Panzer march, panzer march
Iron tyranny and hate
Conqueror fire and supreme art

Dark fortress of SARGEIST
Soon stands rising proud
Nation's flag upon the walls
Cross of blue on white

Reshape the fallen dignity
Of a mighty northern race
We are the first of cruelty
Beating on humanity's face
