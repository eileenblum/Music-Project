[Music &amp; lyrics: Shatraug / SARGEIST]

Hear the calling
The same call to darkness
I listened all those years ago
The path of hate and wisdom

In vain are you confused
Don't even try to understand
My way is with Satan
I have no heart for compassion

Resist the dark no more
A slave under his immortal will
Warmoon shining morbid
You must welcome the curse

Desecrate the creature of God
Ruin your life, care of none
I am a prophet slashing with his words
Bleed in enslavement obtained

Do you think you understand?
Wrong, there is no way
I see the life in your eyes
You must welcome the curse
