Gigantic carvings
Of the Other gods
In the mountainside
Of this waking world
A cold, darkened land
Full of steep black ridges...
Beyond which nothing
Is visible but the sky

Moon is waxing gibbous,
Two nights before it's full
The dreadful carvings glow
Under the moon's old eye

Come night, pitch-black darkenss!
Horns concealed by the shadows...
Howling of the nameless beings
Across the cemetery fields...

Black beings rise again
From their hidden nests..
The ones no one speak of,
The ones no one know

Come night, pitch-black darkenss!
Horns concealed by the shadows...
Howling of the nameless beings
Across the cemetery fields...
