Inside te demon's maze
Trapped in the void that is known
To exist between life and death
Where no common soul can dwell

Where winds forever blow
Only from the north
And each sign carved in stone
Is an epitaph

Inside the demon's maze
Searching for the gate
Accompanied only by despair
And the mad flutes tone

Followed not by the shadow of being
But by a being of the shadow
Unable to defeat life or reach death
In the cursed eternity
