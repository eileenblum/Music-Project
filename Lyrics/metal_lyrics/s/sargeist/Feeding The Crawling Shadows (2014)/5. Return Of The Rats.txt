I am the coffin spirit
Old ghost of vengeance
Cold may be my bones
Long since decayed my heart
Still here in this crypt
My cursed being bound
Not even rats have returned
Since many centuries

But soon i will again
Have their hungry company
Foolish humans have come
To try and rob my graves
Let them enter my darkness
And break the seal
My blades thirst for blood
For it is near...

So their fortune seeking
Became my rarest joy
Corpses of thieves a fest
For the rats have returned...
