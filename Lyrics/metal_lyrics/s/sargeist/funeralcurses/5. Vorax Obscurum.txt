Vorago...
Burning spells and incantations.
Blasphemies and desecration.
Consecrated in devouring.
All the life in Darkness.

Iron will, and fist to match it.
I am the arrow pointed at you.
From the scorching bow of Satan.
In readiness to hammer you down.

Vorax obscurum
Devouring you soul.
Devouring the light.
From you heart turning cold.

Omens read of carnage visions.
Clad in dust and spider webs.
From the cauldron of master Satan.
I am the poison boiled with HATE.

Vorax obscurum
Devouring you soul.
Devouring the light.
From you heart turning cold.

Pontifex, sacerdos.
Infandus mortuus.
Vorax obscurum.
The Eater of human souls.
