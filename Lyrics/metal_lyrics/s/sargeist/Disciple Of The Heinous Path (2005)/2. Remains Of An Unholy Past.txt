Once again my thoughts-are drifting back in time.
Remembering the times-when the cult was one.
Black metal nowadays-is too much just a game.
But in my heart prevail-the age of black metal reign.

As the shadows rise-echoes from the past.
We are the Satan's legion-devoted to his crimes.
Nothing ever will be the same-returin to the Night.
The curse has not been lifted-its stronger than the passing time.

Black metal is a spell-of misanthropic light.
Burning in my eyes-disciple of the Heinous Path.
In the glare of burning churches-a dedication monument.
Unholy black remains-worshippers of the cult.

Black metal fucking war-satanic possession
To Satan,forever-under the funeral moon.
We are an evil blaze-eternal in the northern sky.
It's the time of Sabbath-return of hell and tyranny.

Remembering the times-murders and the arsons.
The flame is in my heart-the oath and covenant
Darkness of the past-the calling of devotion
Following the freezing moon-into the deepest Night.
