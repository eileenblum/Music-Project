Born a night from a rotten womb.
Breath of terrible mournful past.
Fear and misery of the peoples memories
Waiting for the coffin lid to open.

With a Chalice raised to the Majesty
I'm his disciple and devotee.
I am the fist of Satan clenched
In rapture by the worship

Cursed blaze of rituals
The sinister black catharsis
Remembering the unholy chants.
As I scratch the wooden lid.

I'm the melancholic lord of torment.
The remains of a ruined soul.
Evil presence from an Empires doom
The raven at your funerals

Under the full moon
Tormented howling winds
Born a Night from a rotten womb
Breath of terrible mournful past.
