[By Leneauth for Sargeist]

Blessed are those who know and face sorrow.
Thus who experience a life of constant overcoming.
Strength to be blended with pain
On the heretic path,iron will prevails.

To rise and survive
In this world object and rotting.
Darkness means the highest knowledge.
On the heretic path,iron will prevails.

Breed of Satan
Noble and solitary
Blazing spirit and heart unbleeding.
Eternally denying,defying and conquering.

Command to the eternal circle
Strike with the spear of Satan
Instincts and strife for excellence are always at one.
To celebrate the sinister dawn.
