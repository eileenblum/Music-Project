I have watched over thousand deaths.
Possessed the mourning families.
I have felt their tears of grief.
Flown on my face under(their)skin

I am the entity that feeds the sadness.
Depression and melancholy.
I am a demon who's wings are nets.
Catching every tear that you cry.

The salt in your wounds is like alcohol to me.
Drunken I've been so many times.
I still remember the age of Black Death
The years I was feasting so long.

Now that I look at the pathetic world
I despise the humans since day one.
Invisible the shadows that haunts infernally.
I am there when you are hurt in pain.
