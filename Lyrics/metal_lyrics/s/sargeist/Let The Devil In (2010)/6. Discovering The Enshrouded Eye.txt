Ritual recitations are done
A cold current impales me
It's white fire engulfing my soul
In the death-womb of void

Discovering the sinister eye
Within enshrouded reaches
From one end to another end
Obscure chants are carried

In me the Devil lives on
Manifesting in my thoughts
Appearing in my passionate deeds
As a fist when i strike revenge

In glory for his eternal majesty
My voice is your voice
I am but a cup to be filled
With the wrath of Hell

Enlightened by the sinister eye
Within enshrouded reaches
From one end to another end
Obscure chants are carried
