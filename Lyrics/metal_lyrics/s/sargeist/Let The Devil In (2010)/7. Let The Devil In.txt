My dark promise to Hell
I will live in lust and hate
By heart devoted to crime
Against the coward god

I invert the cross of hope
And dwell in black despair
Every moment of every day
I'm blasphemy incarnate

Let the Devil in
Let the Devil in
Let the Devil in
Possessed...

No virtue undesecrated
No sin I did not taste
I imagine a life for Jesus
I'd rather take the rope
