Hail Satan - Hail Satan!!
Father of my flesh and soul
My voice burns in purity
Of praise and adoration

To you my hands are crossed
My face draped under this hood
Whatever your demands may be
I am at your service, lord

Whatever this dream called life
May offer in it's fading light
Only your wisdom will shine
A meaning to existence

Only in your presence is truth
Ultimately found in the end
I slash open the final gate
And fill this chalice of Hell...
