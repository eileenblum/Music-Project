Once again the moon is glowing
Alone i walk into the night
Must rising from the damp fields
Silence in the darkness

To watch forever it's shining cold
Drinking blood like it was wine
To watch forever it's shining cold
Revelation of the goat is mine

Like the scourge it slashes
Freezing breath of evil winds
Kneeling at a pentagram of ashes
Of the burnt bible pages

My eyes lifted upon the light
In the nocturnal autumn sky
This chalice half empty now
Last words of black recitation

To watch forever it's shining cold
Drinking blood like it was wine
To watch forever it's shining cold
Revelation of the goat is mine

Shut the mouth of the priest
His lord has nothing on me
Devotion in black eternity
I worship Satan!!
