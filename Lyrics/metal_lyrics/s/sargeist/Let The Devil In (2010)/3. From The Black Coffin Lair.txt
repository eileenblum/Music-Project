I uncover the black coffin
A dreamgate to the land of death
With blood I travel there
Drawing dark sigils

The night of my demise...
I gave my soul to Hell
Now I live among skulls and bones
In the land of death

Immortal in undeath
I live in the stench of a grave
Staring from the black earth
Among skeleton pieces

Drop me the taste of your blood
And i caress your dead bones
Cursed with me we are one
May we haunt in disguise

Tearing apart loved ones throats
From the rotten lair I was laid in
Blood soaks the black earth
Transforming lifeforce into a key
