Miserable creatures crawl
Hiding in the dark corridors
Hissing voices of hatred and despise
Pure feelings of eternal loath

Born under the blazing eye
Spawn of a putrid black womb
This, the empire of malevolence
Against the filth of creation

Signs of ominous forces
Inscripted on the crumbling stone
The shining iron pentagrams
Illuminate focused worshippers

Torrent of poisonous chants
Blood stains the ritual blade
Golden crosses turned to Hell
Horns against Heaven
