Come hail and fire, raping the world
Come reap with desire
To chaos are we hurled
Stars will fall with blackest death
Carnage of all, worms in your breath

People swarm in their despair
Bloody limbs cut everywhere
Darkness tears with greedy claws
As nigh their final hour draws

Washed away - with decay
Failing flesh
Torn apart - heart by heart
Death so fresh
Wiped away - no more prey
All is dead
Soul by soul - this hellhole
A void instead

Ash and lava, poison fumes
In each direction perdition looms
Last of prayers heard above by none
Glory to Satan, gods become one
