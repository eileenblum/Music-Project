The flame of darkness and hate
Black token of forbidden art
Ashen walls and pitch-dark ceiling
In this ruin of monastery

Fornication of the evil ghosts
Sinister presence of ancient cold
The shadow in the coffin room
Eyes like burning pits of Hell

Rusty chains rattle in the night
When the vampyric moon is rising
Bloody rituals of black monarchy
Sanguine chalice filled

Immense decay and rotten air
Stench of death, of bones in piles
A throne adorned with skulls
In the gloom of candelabras light
