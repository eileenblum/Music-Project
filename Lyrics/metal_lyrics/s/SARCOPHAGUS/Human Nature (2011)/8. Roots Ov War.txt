wars will be the reason for extinction the human race
human is the reason ov the wars and brought just death
why we die for nothing and only for the greediness
why we fight for nothing and finally its will be death
its just one life we'll live why don't we live it in peace
with out wars or greediness but angels can't live on earth
why we make all this wars as we live in hell and we lost million souls but we just don't care
our life is odium and full ov deceit selfish minds ruthless hearts with out any mercy
human made the rules human broke the rules human is the roots ov war human live in hate human live in lie human live in savagery
we can live in peace why we chose the war as a dirty way to live i don't understand why we've don this wars and we have to die in this way human just a fake human live in hate human is the roots ov war
human is a lie human you'll die human is the roots ov this war
why we still making wars again and we know its will ruin the human race
science is not just for the war or to make destruction guns
we're wasting our life every day in this deadly way
we're destroying what we've built by our hands or by ancients
we're digging our graves through the wars and by hatred
_nothing will remain after wars and pain
only blood and flesh and skulls except the human race
is that the human hunger for blood and death and anger and living through insanity its not liberty when u kill to rule the world
each bullet we've used will be a step to our doom
armageddon its will be by our hands and not by hands ov god
why we sacrifice by our souls
we became a cause ov death by all this wars and for greediness
we're killing each others destroying lives of the others
hate is only in our souls domination always is our goals
we're drowning in our blood and breathing hate and death and wars
why we die then we cry making wars again and again
roots ov war we're is the roots ov war we're is the war....
its cruelty and insanity all this wars just for power burning all this flesh spilling blood bringing zero hour
what we'll gain from this pain and this corpses around us
and what is worth to genocide whats wrong with the humanity
war.... human is the roots ov the war and cause ov death
human is the roots ov the war and brought just death
