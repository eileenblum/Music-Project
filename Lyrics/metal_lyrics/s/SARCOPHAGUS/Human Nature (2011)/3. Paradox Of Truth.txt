the voice of human lies seems like a shambles of smiles
raping the justice on earth corrupting the poems of truth
the birth of human lies brought all the mourning and cries
wars and death for power chaos instinct is rules

we just miss the truth in every feelings we use
pretending loyalty and faith and giving our selves excuse
whats happened to humanity to be that low and loose
we just create black cavity in ruin and we just going through

we still in this world together we'll still human till forever
created by lies and hypocrisy and filling the great blood river

what we've done to our world what will become help us my lord
is that's the end of this cosmos or we just cursed till the time of
doomsday

the voice of justice in life seems like crematory of lies the white
sun of truth
melting black snow of dissemblance

no one telling the truth no one following the rules
human burned through lies greed treason and we just cant deny

life with out lies cant be
life with out tears can't be
life with out blood can't be
life with out sacrifice cant be
