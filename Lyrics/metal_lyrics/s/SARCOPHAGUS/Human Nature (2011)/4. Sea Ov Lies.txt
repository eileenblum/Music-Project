In the sea of lies we all drowning and crying for what we couldn't realize to let our sickness satisfied through the sea ov lies
through this empty life we are consumed ov guile trivial prostitute human you're alive to lie in the sea ov lies
Human just a fake and borned in vain and nothing God is feel regret and standing high and watching what we've done on earth and how much blood we've shaded
and we waste our life counting sins ov all the others
Am sick insane and wrong and I'll burn in fire but i despise the human being cos he's the hatred's sire
low and base and mean and vile in feelings just a liar
i refuse the human rules and how i wish the God destroy them all
we ruined the cultures ov ancients by selfishness and greediness we deformed the faith and we killed all the goodness inside our hearts
we're suffocating the truth we're burning our life's blooms we're destroying the earth and on our graves we'll dance
we're the dirt we're subverter on earth cursing our life slaying roots ov humanity vessels ov deceit profane human infamous hatred arrogance sacrilegious you'll die
human no time to atone sadness and regret has gone
none will erase your sins your shroud turned to your life's deeds....die
