I believe in my eternal dreams but i wont to be the one who drowned in tears
My extreme mind screaming for deliverance my sensations dying for remembrance
And this voices running to the other side searching for the wings broken and blind
I am waiting the final day in my life to join the dead's in them peace in the other side
I am waiting souls of death to hold my hands and take me then to my eternal silver place and far away and sick insane
I am sick insane and wrong and singing to my death this song and am alive in this world through my sickness and among
I am waiting the time am waiting the rapture i will leave this world at last world of lies destruction hypocrisy greediness and
Madness i have nothing to lose in this weak and ruined disgusting world and all of it will be destroyed by the storm
What the meaning of this life if we are all will dead why we've done all this wars why we have to kill the others
Is that all for the power or its just human nature i want to live in peace but its just not existence.
Darkness destruction madness infection selfish perdition faithless and lies
