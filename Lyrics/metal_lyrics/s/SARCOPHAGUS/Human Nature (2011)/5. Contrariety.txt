through my live i never felt a true sensations with out conflict the feelings is just a sort of war and we just living through hate and love
we cant deny the rules of life we borned confused and we justified by lies truth wars and fear contrariety fills the atmosphere
why we cant be so straight with out inflection in our sensations
and y we telling dissemblance and living through lies and hypocrisy
what the meaning of human life with out sensation and they just strive for money and power and ruling the world we just turned our life to a disgusting big fold
what worth to kill each other in this world and we just created on earth of same blood we killed the tolerance inside our hearts replaced by deceit and hatred and lies
y we feeding our lies by deceit as all children feeding at them mothers breast
and we just forsake our souls for the damnation killing our feeling leaving no salvation
bloody history of humanity in the human race death is just a grace
what we have to give only wars and grief hatred consequence human dissidence
there's no absolution mistrust consecution and we just alive to kill each other in this world to another one more chance
human existence is the first nail in the coffin of the mother earth
