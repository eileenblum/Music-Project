through this night am roaming free and laughing till the end of me
i am dead in this night and out of all the human sight
i am sick of war and tears and living in the hope of dreams to live
in perfect world indeed
go away am dead tonight
in the human realm the mercy never seen only hate and greed rules
the world and lead
we daily fill new graves the world in not that safe the live in hell
of god is peaceful
than i thought
crying for god and nature to cure the human nature of this immemorial
fracture and take me
out of existence
no one believe the pain i have inside i feel inside i grew within
I'll live with out
by death indeed am dying lost of human deeds i want to die
through my frozen eyes i see the human lies increasing as the dust
suffocating roots of truth
lies anger obsession
i lost the way of faithful thoughts don't blame it on me am out of
control
i lost the light in the wold of lies my mind was mine but now its
gone
nothing true in the world of lies
