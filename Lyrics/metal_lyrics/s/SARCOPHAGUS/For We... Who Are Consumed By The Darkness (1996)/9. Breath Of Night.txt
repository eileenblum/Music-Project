beyond the firey lakes
of time, there is a void...
I iwll be what I will be...
from above, a shadow
comes down on me,
through the majestic
spheres, natures eternal
circle of sublime beauty,
the pain, the torture,
the night, the dark,
I am but a void,
a tiny disgusting seed,
sealed in this black earth...

I laugh at the illusion of
god, the grandeur, and the
fools that have followed,
be at peace, my friends,
when you close your eyes
it is forever...

dawn arose when I met
this wolrd, from the
warmth of oblivion, to the
cold of reality's absurdity.
as I watch the blood
spill from my wrists,
I anticipate the warmth
I shall feel again...
