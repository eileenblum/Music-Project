hatred of
the holy,
vengeance to the wicked,
my eternal potion,
disown that deity
damned below judas,
pure abhorration,
sell you holy master,
rot in holy servitude...

I received my sentence,
I disavow my master

I find no shelter
vanquished...
damned below judas,
pure abhorration
"him the vindictive rod of
angry justice, sent quick
and howling to the centre
headlong, I fed with
judgement, am buried
above ground..."
