I want to be a rock
harden my heart to god
I want oblivion
I want to be alone

I raise my arms
into the wind
I tilt my head
towards the sky

as if I could fly away
into the deepness above
forever
for mercy's sake
feed my mortal desire
end all that is round me
I want to become one
with the stars,
I want to become air
to sail as the
evening breeze

make me immortal
make me perfection
I'll live to die
with your spirit in me

I want to become
the wintry sky
my blood etched hands
wills for this end
