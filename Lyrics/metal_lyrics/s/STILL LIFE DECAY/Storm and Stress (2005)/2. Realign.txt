Rebuild to connect
It crumbles in neglect
Alone and cold
Payment of your soul

Half-present and aware
The start of another
Skin shedding torture
Half-blistered future

I'm bound to the ground
I'm found looking onward
Into a hole...
If i could stand i'd fall

I can't find peace of mind
I need some more time
I can't find peace of mind
I'm dying on the inside

It's torturous
So goddamn violent
So motherfucking introspective

This is an inner search...

This is an inner search
It's all been rehersed
A desire for escape
From what's been made

The closer that we get
The more it grows distant
So arrogant so ignorant
Distress...
Distress...

Tranquilized T.V. eyes
Unplug and realize
We ingest forcefed lies
Then question burning skies

It's torturous
So goddamn violent
So motherfucking introspective

My head's loaded
My head's a loaded gun

It's torturous
So goddamn violent
So motherfucking introspective
It's torturous
So goddamn violent
