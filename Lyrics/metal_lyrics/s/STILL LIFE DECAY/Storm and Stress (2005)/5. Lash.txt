Big let down
World crashing down
In a puppetshow
Suburban overload
Nowhere to go but inside
Unwelcoming
Bodybag
Passing time
Freezeframe
Insanity
New day opens wide
Quickly closing in
Attention scattered
Phobia...

Dull throb
Black tounge
Speaking knives on a metro line
Thin finger
Scratch rot
Looking for another sign

Stitch
Laughter
Pump action
Explode
Ripped flesh
Oversewn
Force-fed
Head bloat

Environment control
Restraining downlow
Bleak overview
Strain to see through
Alterside
Serenity
Costume violent memories
Creeping in and poisoning
Infecting everything

Contemplate
Life waste
Out of touch
Abyss suck
Obesessive
Compulsive
Distraction
Nightmares still
Unmasking nemisis

One last piece to make me complete
You precious thing don't ever leave
Embalm moment in time
To archive peace of mind

Synchronicity revives
Falling in line
Blackwinged and cloaked
Circling high
I'm still speaking knives
On a metro line
