My skeletons still dance with broken limbs
Woven together by circumstance
Stung with a static sting
Floating down over everything
Sore waves of bitter lips
Salted to preserve distress
False drama weakens the grip
As all consciousness begins to slip
Amnesia assists my trickery
I'll lead you inside to see the workings of a frail device
Constructed with no use

One hand on the door
One cracks a whip
I feel nothing
I still feel nothing
I feel nothing...

You can't give it to me it's something i must retreive
You can't show it to me it's something i have to see
I can't hear it calling me
I can't hear it call

Grown into a suit of scars
But i'll inflict one more
If i can't feel the pain
I can't feel anything
I mirror a reflection vile
A disgust so jekyll and hyde
Like a monster that holds me and takes over inside
I need a slap to wake me
But soon the sting will subside
I need some death to feel alive
Gimme some death to feel alive
I need some death to feel alive

One hand on the door
One cracks a whip
I feel nothing
I still feel nothing
I feel nothing...

You can't give it to me it's something i must retreive
You can't show it to me it's something i have to see
I can't hear it calling me
I can't hear it call

Can't...
Feel...
No more...
Nothing...

I'm...
Destroyed...

I feel nothing
I still feel nothing

You can't give it to me it's something i must retreive
You can't show it to me it's something i have to see
