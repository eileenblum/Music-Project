When will it end
Will it ever end
Wake up to the noise
Of unfinished unease
Tear at myself
Tear at the world
Bite the dog
Smash the clock
Jump out the window
Fragmented thought
Distraught
Release me
Frustrate
Slowly being erased
Seclusion
Restraint misplaced
Detach
Backlash
Misfed
Detest

I'm standing on the brink of collapse
Nothing's left to hold me back
This time i've gone too far
Now i'm going to let it fall

Self-inflicting mutilation
Always cutting and replacing
Revive a disguise
To anesthicise
Imbedding inside
Now purge and access
Recollect &amp; dispense
Into your head
Envision incision
Extract and detach
Recoil
Retract
Convulse and react
Release then set traps
Outreach
Reject
Defect
Reset
Brainwash that infects

I'm standing on the brink of collapse
Nothing's left to hold me back
This time i've gone too far
Now i'm going to let it fall

Detach
