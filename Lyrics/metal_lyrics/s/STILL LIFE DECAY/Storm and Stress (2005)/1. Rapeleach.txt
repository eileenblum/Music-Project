Forward resistance
False lethargic
Expectant reward for nothing labored

Suck like leach pulled from me
Hold back boundries now construct
Arms length to protect
Stealing fruits of inner toil
I will fold
Never stepping stones to reach
The joke unable to comprehend
The words i speak fluently

Trapped in plastic
Mindset material gain will slap you again
Sleep on with head numb
Come undone
Awaken only within trauma
So keep looking on in shallow senses
Hindsight all the wasted moments
Unable to touch
The sad vacancy never present to be aware
Chances lost now contemplate
Stratagies to regain meaning
Many seperate ways
Many seperate paths

Go full on or complain
Point out fault
Contemplate
Recognise these things that trouble me

Cut...

Cut them from life
Displeasing taste to dramatise
Until believing am i being fair to myself
To hate...
No respect for mirrored fault
Mirrored plea
To hate...
No respect for mirrored fault
Reflection plea

To hate everyone else
Point out fault
Contemplate
Recognise these things that trouble me

Cut them from life
Displeasing taste to dramatise
Until believing am i being fair to myself
To everyone else
No respect for mirrored fault
No respect...

Something's wrong

To hate...

Go full on or complain
Point out fault
Contemplate
Recognise these things that trouble me

Cut them from life
Displeasing taste to dramatise
Until believing am i being fair to myself
To hate...
