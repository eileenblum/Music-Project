Pale existance
Bleached white deficience
Evolving insects left me with a hole
A death within
Left this hole to fill with sin
These clouded secrets
I'll bury deep
Deep to forget
And disguise the stench
Of cold regret that's leaving it's toll

All that was asleep and numb
Lay wide awake inflicting ruin
I'll tear the skin and peel it back
To leave it's marks and feel it scratch

Pale reflection
Disguising hidden deception
Hungry insects left me with a hole
A hell within
Punished by my own sins
These hidden demons
Are consuming me
All that is left
Is this spoiled flesh
And an emptiness that is swallowing me

All that was asleep and numb
Lay wide awake inflicting ruin
I'll tear the skin and peel it back
To leave it's marks and feel it scratch

To leave it's marks and feel it...
To leave it's marks and feel it...
Scratch
