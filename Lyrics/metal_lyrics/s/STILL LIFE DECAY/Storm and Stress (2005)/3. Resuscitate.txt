Unwind and find
Losing track of time
It escapes me quietly
Until i seep into infinity

Fading fast
Losing grasp
It slips too fast
Time trick giving chance
A second glance pulling away
Time keeps ticking away

Fall into the fold
Connect this dislocation
Numb mind
Dead eyes
Walk off
Motion sickness

Help to soothe
Lick these wounds
That will not heal
Injest
Unrest
Nothing making sense
Unclear hollow thoughts
Distract evidence
Unexplained memories lost

Retained memories collage
Nothing seems to connect
Unravel into torment
Torment...

Traumatic installation
Reaching into degradation
Feeling cold as it unfolds
Erasing light
Relapse
Self-confined
Grow new shell
Transform under
Break tough layers
Membrane wrapped
Fracture and reveal
Disillusion shock
Internal monologue repeating

Unrevealing
Until it flows into a gush
Step heavy down
Barren rows feel grey
Push down slow
Implant rejected
Clean this mess
Paranoia mental stress

Extending hope
Reach out
Grasp
Hold on
Holding on only slivers
Sinking quicker
Reach short
Undertow pulling
Submerge
Impending panic
Engulfed by overload
Rescue uncertain
Struggle
Submerging
Grasp
Hold on
Only slivers
Reach short
Sinking quicker
Hold on
Entanglement
Slipping
Imminent void

Hold on
Last breath
Grasping
Reach short
I'm slipping into nothing
Hold on
Can't breath
My grip is slipping
I'm reaching into nothing
Hold on
I'm reaching
Can't grasp
I'm slipping
I'm sinking

No response...
