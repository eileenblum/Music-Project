A faceless ghost haunting sleep
Sinking eyes roll back and disconnect
With white wash rinsing deep
Brought to a place disfigured and opaque
Open...

Emanate and touch the flame
Blister mother given hands
Stand still embrace the flames
Split wide open cracked and cleansed
Left with a shadowed view
Raw afflicted thoughts in mind
Old reflections seeping through
Exposing leasions of a different kind

Open eyes
Open these eyes
Let in the light
Casting shadows in a sickened mind
Let in the light
Throwing image into a broken sky

A dull throb pounding to get out
Into a room so still...
Feel the vacant silence
Move through it, breathe in
Suffocating lost whisper licking
A dull throb still pounding to get out
Into a room so still...

Open eyes
Open these eyes
Let in the light
Casting shadows in a sickened mind
Let in the light
Throwing image into a broken sky

Getting back lost path rewind rewind
Question destination
Unseen complications falling off the edge
Rewind
Confine
Rewind

Open eyes
Open these eyes
Let in the light
Casting shadows in a sickened mind
Let in the light
Throwing image into a broken sky
