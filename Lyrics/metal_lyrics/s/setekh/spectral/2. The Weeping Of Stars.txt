Visions of the infinite realm
Of the Universe
Spectral light of stars
Shining light years away

How complex they are
In design
And Magnitude

The key
To all knowledge
Lies Beyond
The Weeping Stars


Many moons gravitate
Towards one fixed orbit
The light of a burning star

Its force
Pulls me in
Yet I do not resist

Thy cold and rigid
Atmosphere
Not fit for life
Perplexes me
And haunts my mind
