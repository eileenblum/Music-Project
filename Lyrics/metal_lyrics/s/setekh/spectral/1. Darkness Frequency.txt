Eternal Blackness
Drifting through the void
Of Space and Time

Controlled Psyche
But distorted thoughts
The mind of man is weak
And feeble to the cold unknown

Toxic light permeates the subconscious
With thoughts and visions

But the Frequency of darkness
Knows no bounds
And has dominion over all
Of beast and god
And even light itself

An array of the brightest hues
Make themselves present
Before they burn into the blackness
Of a dark vortex
Where the brightest of suns
Is grinded into dust
Never again to shine
