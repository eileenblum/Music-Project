Across the cosmic grid
Mesmerized by the stillness
Of space and time

Taken across this void
To where Many
Of moons have danced
Since early times

A sea I travel
Not of water
But of time itself
My cosmic voyage
Goes farther
Than the deepest
Reaches of Dimension

The stars burn brighter now
But I still descend further
Beyond what I can perceive

Towards a perception
Hidden from consciousness
Even where gods hold no power
â¦The endless void of time
