Always this way, this fight for freedom
Because of you we'll touch the bottom
I wish you were the hero, my pride
I can't repress my fear, my shame, my sadness.

It won't work this time
I swear it won't work this time
This path you take
For my sake I will cross it 

For my sake I will cross it 

Guide me to your warmness
Keep for once one of your promises
Iâd maybe put away your past
If you look one time behind you

Guide me to your warmness
Keep for once your promises
Why would I put away your past
If youâre not looking behind you

The snake always bites its tail
It is an endless cycle
I wonder if it's really hard
To stick to your word and fight for what you love

Iâm not waiting for you to react (I'd never ask for that)
And Iâm not waiting for a sign from you (for a sign from you)
I'd rather show you the man that I became without your help (your help) 
Finally you are alone, despicable but you (but you've not realized yet) 

Guide me to your warmness
Keep for once one of your promises
Iâd maybe put away your past
If you look one time behind you

Guide me to your warmness
Keep for once your promises
Why would I put away your past
If youâre not looking behind you
