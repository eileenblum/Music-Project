Tell me one more time, recount your past
You could have received the best but here we are
God, how can I be blessed like that?
My acts should have only bred my own desperate times

Can't you really guess what's in my heart?
It may look bright but inside I'm a mess
This feeling's sweeping softly through my fingers
As I touch your arm (or look at your eyes)

The earth stops spinning
As I'm about to touch your lips
I'm picturing myself the scene
Can you feel the dance (of my inner sins)?

The earth stops spinning
As you're coming closer to me
Let's reinvent ourselves this scene
But can you feel the dance of my inner sins?

You are the air I needed

I can't see clearly through you
You're just the perfect innocent
A kind I thought gone for a long time
How could this be when everything around us is all broken

Just leave the wrong parts to me!
Please leave it!

Mistakes won't come with my second chance
I'd rather take myself to blame to spare you

I'll give everything I have
And all the things that I lack
To see you smile again my dear
Even if I can no longer hold your hand

Have I just dreamt a bit?
You were right there, I can't explain or find a reason

Tell me one more time, recount your past
You could have received the best but here we are
God, how can I be blessed like that?
My acts should have only bred my own desperate times

Can you still not guess what's in my heart?
It may look bright but inside I'm a mess
This feeling's sweeping softly through my fingers
As you turn around (or look at your eyes)

The earth stops spinning
As I'm about to touch your lips
I'm picturing myself the scene
Can you feel the dance (of my inner sins)?

The earth stops spinning
As you're coming closer to me
Let's reinvent ourselves this scene
But can you feel the dance of my inner sins?
