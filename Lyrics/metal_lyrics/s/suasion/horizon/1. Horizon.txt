What is this feeling ?
It's racing through my veins
Is this a mistake ?
Or is it the world ?

I can't remember 
The reasons of my choice (it's no more clear) 
I just want my home

Where is it ? 
You can't say this so soon
Catch the dream at your door
And take control

What's going on ? 
I see nothing but deception in my drowned eyes
What's going on ? 
Is it my turn to have a mechanical heart ?

But it's going on and on
So I can't hold my distress

If it's on this final way 
That my goals are meant to be 
I'd see myself far away

If it's on this final way 
That my goals are meant to be 
That's just not my dream

Will I become so hollow inside ?
Like all those faces (those faces nearby) 
I guess that's just the price to pay
But I hope I will remain the same

My fear, my panic have imposed their will 
My fear, my panic have imposed their will

I won't yield the slightest (the slightest part of myself)
I will only look forward to get out of this place

Is this a mistake ?
Or is it the world ?
Is this my mistake ?
Is this my new world ?
