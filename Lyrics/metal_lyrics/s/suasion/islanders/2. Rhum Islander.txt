Rhum Islander
I'm looking for freedom
Would this ever happen?
Thought I could stand my demon
But all I though was wrong

Consequences of drinking all away
Did i swear or had a reason to stay ?
I can't remember what I said
The words come out so easily

Everything in my brain is upside down again
Try to fix together a cigarette and Mary Jane (Mary Jane)

I can feel the substance running through my veins

I feel hot, I'm burning from the inside
I'm dreaming like a child who can't decide
How to live my life with no listener
I'm just a Rhum islander

I can't remember what I said
The words come out so easily

I have seen the fucking dark in me
There's nothing but a black sea

Everything in my brain is upside down again
Try to fix together a cigarette and Mary Jane (Mary Jane)

So much drinks to feel free

Help me !

I feel hot, I'm burning from the inside
I'm dreaming like a child who can't decide
How to live my life with no listener
I'm just a Rhum islander
