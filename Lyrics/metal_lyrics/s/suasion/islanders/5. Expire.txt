Since we avoid the drowning winds
And find our shore
The evolution of our dying souls
Ran through my door

Take it back and simply follow me
Take it back and have for once some kind of faith in me
For no more crows

The common feeling of an inner pain
Ridden again through all my veins
The common feeling of an inner pain
Ridden again

No more regrets for the choices I'll take
I'll forget my faults for my brave

Oh

Take it back
I can finally rest (take it back)

I promise we will cross the forbidden lines of our lives
For the memories of our broken past
I promise we will cross the forbidden lines of our lives
For the memories of our broken past

And if you try
You will find another wall (a wall, a wall)
And if you try
You will find world
A world, a world

Another wall
Another world
Until I expire
