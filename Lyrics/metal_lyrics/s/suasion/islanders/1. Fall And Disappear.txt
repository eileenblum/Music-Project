I can still feel you inside me (inside me)
Can I bet you'll get on your knees ? (Get on your knees)

Your life is ending now
Heavy heart
I tried to make you stay
To believe

There's the devil underneath your smile tonight
You are in flames and undertake the demons of your past
Starring at the sky and ask why
You have choose this side to take the wide

You planned to suicide

I feel bad to know you were sad
I want to see you rise from your demise
I want to say goodbye one last time

I buried my mates, my brothers and my fate
It's hard to pass over it
'Cause I'm fucking lying on this pit

There's a star above my head
Which shine so bright
Your soul has been embedded
To the dead, and mine has been shred

I can still feel you inside me
Can I bet you'll get on your knees?

I wish you all my best and hope you are appeased
You will forever live through my heart
And we're all proud of you
From the end to the start
And my tears fall and disappear
I trapped the feelings in the harmony
And slowly disappears
Into the seas

Fall and disappear
