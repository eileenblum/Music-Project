Self abandoned by dividing nightmares
Staying awake to avoid your face
Upgrade my courage to see who cares
Rewake the magnificient disgrace

Can you survive this ?!

I've left my questions and hopes behind
Guided and trained
Despaired and broken by mournings and crimes
I inspire the glory in life

Through your field of force
Living like riding God's Horse
Through your field of force
I'm lost in all kind of remorce [2x]

Can you survive this ?!

There's still an ampty place inside my mind
Keep following the waters
If I Survive [2x]

YOU SAY I'M UNDEPRAVED

Will we get over the sweet and the cold you gave
I beg and wish you say I'm undepraved
But in the end

I have to free this from myself
No matter how we've seen the end
After all
I want to build this world again

Cause I faced my fears and tried to change
Tell me there's future in our hands
Cause I've done my best to understand
Why all my dreams fade away

There's still an ampty place inside my mind
Keep following the waters
If I survive [2x]

YOU SAY I'M UNDEPRAVED
