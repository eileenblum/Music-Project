You took the brightest part in my eyes
They chased suspicion in the dark
Claimed all our dreams were only lies
Affected my angels left me your mark

Donât ever take my hand
It burns like hell Iâm cursed and dead
Please don't ever take my hand

You left some scars, engraved my heart
It's time to take off this black coat
Shining lights will replace our hurt
But reckless faith controlled my thoughts

Teach me a way to rework my behaves
And learn to swim by the side of waves
Teach me a way to rework my behaves
And learn to swim by the side of waves

And we will keep on looking forward
And we will keep on looking forward
And leave the lights leading our breath
And we will keep on looking forward
And leave the lights leading our breath

You left some scars, engraved my heart
It's time to take off this black coat
Shining lights will replace our hurt
But reckless faith controlled my thoughts
