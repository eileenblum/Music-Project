Forced above toward the vicious blackened canopy
An infinite cognizance to standardize depravity
The only thing that stands between demise is you and me
Will one survive to test the limits of insanity
Suffer in secrecy your faults shine bright for everyone to see
You burn within the deepest reach of hell
void the soul and scour the brain,your heads becomes cell
A simple drought of common sense
A terrible sight of  deplorable blight  breaks the will of men
Malevolent heresy will taint your name for all eternity
Now let the demons seal your tomb
A deed sanctioned by the lord of the dark
Reside in sin's unholy womb
destined to be damned, bear the mark
Now demons peel the flesh from the remains of your human form
Now jaded, time stands still, any discretion exists no more
Look upon the massive burning city, void of life
An insurrection in the previous life has paved a path in which all you know is this
The dark lord seeks your soul to serve his severed sect, and offer you cannot resist
Hail the lord of darkness,
Grave defiler. hatred born
Now you fall to fate's twisted game
A pawn on death's province, a conscript save a name
Hail the lord of dark 
Grave defiler ,hatred born
Look upon the massive burning city, be forewarned
So now you see what your treachery has brought you
This heresy now comes full circle
Feel the burning eyes
Looking out at you vindictive innovations
End with an unholy guile
May you acts be reconciled
Such a cowardly disguise
Hiding from all of your bitter incantations
You act just like a child
You are destined for exile
Descent complete, you're now a shell in Lucifer's retreat
