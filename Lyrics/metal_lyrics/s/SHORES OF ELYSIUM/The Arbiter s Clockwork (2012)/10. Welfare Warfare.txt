A never ending line leads to a government concession
A collection of broken dreams and spiraling depression
Green paper and silver coin have brought about a new obsession
This currency-based worship drives us deep into recession
Welcome to your nightmare
Your Times worth judged in dollars
They know youre not  all there
Trade in your freedom for collars
The bill of rights is void now
This couldn't have been their vision
Freedom isn't always free
Time to make a decision
open mouths and empty hands
Just waiting To be fed
Sitting ducks waiting for aid, we're all as good as dead
With every dollar that you spend you buy into the game
To them we are all dollar signs
They see us all the same
You are a consumer
A product of the system
How dare you even question them
You Better not resist them
oppressive hands hover above the American population
Bastardized machines, we're under constant observation
Tables have turned,times have changed and much to their elation
Secret prisons are resurrected all across the nation
Control control control control
They're Never satisfied with more
it's time that we reverse the role
The American dream has been thrown out the door

It's time to end oppression
Time to prove our worth
We have a chance to make a change
To save this Dying earth
If we dont make stand now, we'll never get the chance
open your mouth and speak your mind, lest this be our last dance
