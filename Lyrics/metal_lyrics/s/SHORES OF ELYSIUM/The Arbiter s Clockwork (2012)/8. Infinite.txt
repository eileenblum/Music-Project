Inhaling smoke opens the mind and drowns out all deception
Allowing one to step away from man's profound perception
As the embers burn Time seems to slow its pace 
Eyes now bloodshot,glazed and red The truth will show its face 
Unity with space and time breeds new ground for believing 
A conscious contradiction, first impressions are deceiving 
ascend from this abysmal place to find a deeper meaning
My mind runs wild, my body lies limp with eyes crimson and gleaming 
The focus of mankind assured their own damnation
The lies we're told grow like a fucking infestation
Faultless but upon us, a soothing perish song
Hear their heartless motives, we're forced to sing along

Mind numbing monotony
Combined with class conformity
Minds are grown like botony
In this gruesome deformity 

When observing the majority
Your labeled a minority
A user, an abuser, a new target for  authorities 

Heads of hypocrites spew shit about our harmless dope
Then go home ,Hit the bottle, pouring poison down their throats
I wonder why such a vile substance was made legal
Consuming countless lives that once belonged to decent people

Mankind is flawed, now see the error in your ways
Our own stupidity will be the end of days
A lone mans voice, a whimper amongst waves
It's time to break these shackles, we're not fucking slaves

Inhaling smoke opens the mind and drowns out all deception
Allowing one to step away from man's profound perception
As the embers burn Time seems to slow its pace 
Eyes now bloodshot,glazed and red The truth will show its face 

So now we see, flaws embedded with in men
These flaws Ensure extinction, stubborn until the end
The old will wither and die, then well have our time
The future is bright for us, I see
It in my mind

One day new brilliant minds will finally be put to use
no longer will we have to suffer this negligence and this abuse

In this uphill battle, it seems we've reached the summit
A single bill will pass and we will watch the crime rates plummet

In this uphill battle, it seems we've reached the peak
A single bill will lead us to the answer that we seek
