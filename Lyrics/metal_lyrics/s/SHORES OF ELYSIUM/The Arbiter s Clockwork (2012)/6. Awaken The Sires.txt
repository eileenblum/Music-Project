With each and every dollar spent, we dig out ditches deeper.
Each man a slave to bottomless debt until we meet the reaper.
Work your fingers to the bone to buy what you desire,
Years go by, you wish for time knowing you'll soon expire.
Looking back you'll realize you've wasted all your time
When Death comes knocking on your door, you won't leave with a dime

Why are we wasting our lives?

make a stand, it's now or never
stand and fight, or suffer forever

There's more to life than the fame and wealth you seek.
the dollar sign Suffocates your mind, infecting the thoughts you think
mankind as a whole has been overcome with noxious greed
there's no time to stop and think with money to make and mouths to feed

When will people realize their times not worth a paycheck
break your back and swell your mind for green pieces of paper
minds of men misguided by massive amounts of money
hearts of man consumed by greed, and insatiable gluttony.

the federal reserve
is a clever guise hidden in plain sight
a single word
sailed a scandal overhead like a fucking kite.

We've spent too much time putting all our faith in corruption.
fat cats with Cheshire grins have ensured mankind's destruction.
