A single sunflower is all he could afford
Who knew a simple garden could deter an undead hoard
You'll reap the benefit while they photosynthesize
They hunger for the organ setting  right behind your eyes
As the decomposing hoard
Draws closer to your door
The foul stench of the undead spewing bile from their pores
Enough to make you heave
They long to watch you bleed 
the switch was hit their feeble minds only tell them to feed 
These plants will not suffice 
Your brains set in their sights
All you can do is watch and pray you'll make it through the night 
This is your last resort
The fiends will be no more 
These vicious bombs you wield will send them to the morgue

What once was dead now thrives again

He deploys armies from his cold dead armored hands
The zomboss lays your plans to waste
He Consumes countless souls and smashes scouts within his hands
Interested in intellects taste

With the cruelest of intentions 
The dead were resurrected 
Miles of mindless minions march to munch upon your marrow
Inclined to make you one of the infected
