Fearless forces trudge on to wail of a war horn
They march with heavy hearts and thoughts of home, now long forlorn
As they gazed upon the field through clouds of freezing breath
A familiar taste fell on their lips 
The air was thick with death
Thunderhead trudged down the line and met each set of eyes
And from beneath his beard erupts a mighty battle cry
Hail us the wicked ones, rulers of land and sea
We must assume our rightful place, fulfill the prophecy
We've traveled over oceans by the might of many men
We've come to far to not take back whats ours again

now is the time 
To take the throne
Now is the time
To reclaim our home

Enshrouded in darkness
We've achieved a most unholy strength 
completion of this dark ritual will ensure our acceptance amongst dark ranks

Enshrouded in darkness 
we've obtained a most unholy Fervor
For ever loyal to the underlord, for life a faithful server

Though the tide is strong, we move onward despite treacherous seas
Though the tide is strong, we are stronger, bringing foes to their knees

try as you may
You will fall

Though the tide is strong, we move onward despite treacherous seas
Though the tide is strong, we are stronger, bringing foes to their knees

Try as you may
You will fall

Armies fight and fall at the hands and might of the hoard
Kneel before us you traitorous fiend, or meet your end by the might of my sword
