Radiation thick like smoke suffocates what breathes on the surface
A faint trace of a mushroom cloud makes man question his purpose
Why are we here? We're we engineered to destroy? 
Rational men act as children
treating atomic bombs like toys

Radiation thick like smoke suffocates what breathes on the surface
A faint trace of a mushroom cloud reminds us that we're all fucking worthless

The whole damn worlds a contest
To see who holds the biggest gun
But when it's over and it's all said and done, no one has won
Ode To the deceased
Victims of ignorance 
Kus a collection of super rich assholes can't set aside their arrogance

Ode To the deceased
Victims of ignorance 
We've fallen victim to a system of negligence 

Why are we here? We're we engineered to destroy? 
Rational men act as children
treating atomic bombs like toys

No one reigns supreme, we are all human beings
Stuck in a life without a plan, were all left searching for meaning
The end will swiftly come, atomic bombs for everyone. 
the calendar ends at the end of the year so go get yourself a gun
Preach to your peers about the end of days
Misguided passion pushes paranoia
pray to a false god swearing to change your ways
but don't say I didn't warn ya

Our lives are trivial, our input is nothing
Apocalypse is upon their lips
We're at the mercy of the man with the fat ring 
Nothing but Flesh covered poker chips

Everything's gone, a new day has dawned
This ravaged earth is soiled with corpses
Thousands of casualties that could have been avoided 
Lives ended by our armed forces
