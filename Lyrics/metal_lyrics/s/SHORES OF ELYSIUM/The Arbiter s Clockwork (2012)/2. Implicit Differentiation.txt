Numbers cloud my thoughts with no clear finish line in sight
The only thought in mind the silent solace of the night
The former years have offered such a simple path to take
One obstacle to overcome, I need a fucking break
Omen of obscurity, a single test to pass
A vicious abstract juggernaut to mortify the mass
It's made dissonant,entombment of the brain
A chorus of new formulas could drive a man insane

The alphabet and numbers coexisting all the same
An open pit of seething embers flamebroils my brain

This ruthless unrelenting shit is wasting precious time
mind mutilating marathons manipulate my mind
This restless calculation a completely flawed design
Symbols read like hieroglyphs and tear this tested mind

Calculation of a different kind
Obliterates this tested mind

Calculation of a different kind
The Answers are impossible to find

Calculations of a foreign kind
Decimate this tortured mind

In stark contrast to fundamentals known since birth
A nasty plot to put a plague upon this earth
Made to overwhelm the minds of citizens today
They bend the path with laws and proofs to fortify your fate
Hear the numbers as they start to sing their sultry tune
Victims of a sick cruel joke, my mind is void of room
I can't understand this shit, despite close observation
they're speaking Japanese, implicit differentiation
