It is the future... year 6969. Somewhere out in Megaspace.
The Pelozees of the Lesbodyke Nebula, in order to continue breeding after removal from the
Universe their last remaining enemy, men, created the PIL - Penile Impregnation Lingumbot.
Rezark SP - a prototype PIL, accidentally launched into chrono-space during the hyperfiber wars, has programmed a self replicating evo-loop and drifts for a kilo-year, alone and sentient in a tele-operative trajectory above Planet Three-S: formerly known as Earth.
Lowering his astrogate to Planet Three-S, Rezark SP, the last surviving chrononaut, has a bad case of bluballsium and one thing on his hydro-mind:
Pussy!
