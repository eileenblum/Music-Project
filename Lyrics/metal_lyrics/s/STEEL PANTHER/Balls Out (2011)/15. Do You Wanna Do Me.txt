[Japanese Bonus Track]I see you staring at me, just like I'm staring at you
I wanna go for a ride, up on your ass and your boobs
I want my cock up inside, on your Fallopian tubes
Baby I don't need to know your name

You see the look in my eyes, you know that I wanna feez
I want you backin' up West, I'll stick my tongue to the East
I cross the fingers and pray, that you're not covered in yeast
Don't be stupid, girl you know the game

Do you wanna do me?
Tie me up and screw me
Beat me, black and blue me
I know you wanna do it, so let's get down to it

Oh, gonna get down to it, yeah

Let's get to business baby, let's go back to my place
I'll fuck your skull and put the pictures up on MySpace
Then you can Twitter to your friends 'bout how my balls taste
God I love the information age

And then when we're done fuckin' I'll go on your Facebook
And I'll find out you got chlamydia from Dane Cook
Well that explains just why your pussy didn't taste good
God I hate the information age

Come on, baby!

Do you wanna do me?
Tie me up and screw me
Beat me, black and blue me
I know you wanna do it, so let's get down to it

Do you wanna do me?
Tie me up and screw me
Beat me, black and blue me
I know you wanna do it, so let's get down to it

Let's get down to it, yeah!
I know you wanna do it, so let's get down to it
