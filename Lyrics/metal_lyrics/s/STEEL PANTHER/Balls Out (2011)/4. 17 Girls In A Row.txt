I fucked 17 girls in a row last night
And ten of them gave me head
I had to tip the maid a hundred dollar bill
To clean the wet spot off the bed
Yes I did

The very next day I told the guys
The flipped me off and said that's all lies
Gotta admit I was a little peaved
Stix and Lexxi wouldn't believe

I fucked 17
17 girls in a row
What a dirty hoe

I banged 17 girls in the grocery store
And never lost my erection, no
They had to mop up sperm in aisle 3
And some poop in the produce sex-sex-section
Stinky!

When I told the boys in the band they said
Motherfucker you're out of your fucking head
I don't lie about the girls I screw
They're just so jealous 'cause they know it's true

I fucked 17
17 girls in a row
Yes I, yes I did!
Woah!

17 girls in a row!
17 girls, I shot my blanks in every hole
17 girls in a row!
When I was done they were begging for more!

I fucked 17 girls at the trailer park
Down in Memphis, Tennessee
I whipped out my dick and they got on their knees
Like they were all getting ready to pray

Wham to the bam to the thank you ma'am
Then I praised the lord like Billy Graham
Hell may be where I'm gonna go
But when I get there I'm pretty sure the devil will know

I fucked 17
17 girls in a row
Sweet, young, juicy pussy!
I fucked 17 girls in a row!
Hop on that camel toe
I fucked 17 girls in a row

[Clean/Radio version:]

I did 17 girls in a row last night
I can't get 'em out of my head.
I hit the team tomato on a dollar bill
I'm cleaning six girls off my face
Yes I did

The very next day I told the guys
But they said that's all lies
Gotta admit I was a little beat
Stix and Lexxi wouldn't believe

I did 17. 17 girls in a row!
Dirty hoes!

I rocked 17 girls in a grocery store and never lost my erection!
No!
They had the saying aisle 3 and my love in sec-sex-section.
Stinking!

When I told the boys in the band they said
'Michael Starr, you're outta your crazy head! '
I don't lie about the girls I screw
So jealous 'cause you know it's true

I did 17. 17 girls in a row
Yes I, Yes I did!
Woah!

17 girls in a row! 17 girls
I had my face in every hole
17 girls in a row!
When I was done they were begging for more!

[Guitar Solo - Satchel]

I had 17 girls in a catholic church in the middle of the effing day
Climb in baby!
I whipped out my junk and they got on their knees like they were all gettin' ready to pray, yeah!

Wham to the Bam to the Thank You, Mam!
Then I praised the lord as I
Tell me where I'm gonna go when

I did 17. 17 girls... in a row!
Woo, sweet and juicy, juicy! Yeah!
17 girls in a row!

On that camel toe
I rocked 17 girls in a row! Yeah!
