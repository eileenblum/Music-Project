I want to tell you 'bout something fun
So I wrote you this song
If you've ever been to Disneyland
You know the lines can be real long
But I got a ride that the bitches love
And you won't have to wait at all
All you've got to do is ditch your boyfriend
And give sexy Michael Starr a call

I'll take your ass for a weenie ride
Spread your cheeks and swallow your pride
It's scary like a rollercoaster
It will stretch you out so wide

Gonna take your ass for a weenie ride
Hold on tight 'cause I'm coming inside
It's better than a ferris wheel or a water slide
It's a weenie ride

I want to sing about a thing that's funner than a swing and better than the
Monkey bars
You can take it on the couch or your water bed or in the back of your
Daddy's car
And it's open all day, night time too, seven fucking days a week
It only shuts down intermittently so I can take a leak

So put that snatch on a weenie ride
Ride her face down or on your side
You'll be amazed what you can fit in there
When some leverage is applied
Open your legs for a weenie ride
You won't be the first to see it and cry
Just bring the baby wipes and some astroglide
It's a weenie ride

Oh yeah

Scream for me

Honey, won't you try the weenie ride
You're never gonna be the same
Baby, how you gonna get to Heaven if you can't take a little pain?

Step right up for a weenie ride
It's even more fun when you're gagged and tied
Oops, I think I got a little DNA
All over your backside

Go on and tell your friends about the weenie ride
You can charge admission, baby, I don't mind
Even with the big old muff you won't get tonight
For the weenie ride

Ooh

Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Ride (It's a weenie ride)
Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Ride (Come spread your
Thighs)
Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Ride (Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh
Ooh, Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh)
Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Ride (It's a weenie ride)
Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Ride (It's a weenie ride, 
Yeah)
Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Ride (Baby, baby, baby)
It's a weenie ride
