Last night, I got so high
I think I had sex with the cable guy
Well Iâll admit, it wouldâve been funny,
But that pole smoker stole all my drug money
I buy chronic every week or so
But I do it when Iâm really really high on blow
Iâm wide awake, but itâs hard to count
I paid 1100 dollars for a quarter ounce!

I like drugs but they donât like me
My brain cells seem to disagree
I like drugs, I like drugs, I like drugs, but they donât like me

I was pounding some bitch the other night
Rolling on E man, feeling alright
When I was high she was hotter than heck
But I woke up to a face that looked like Shrek
I get high, that ainât no lie
But I canât afford another friggin DUI
Doctor says "stop, or youâll be dying"
I was gonna, but then you said you were buying

I like drugs but the donât like me
Itâs always better, when theyâre free!
I like drugs, I like drugs, I like drugs, but they donât like me
No they donât!
Donât try and stop me, I canât be saved, oh yeah
If I die tonight at least my balls are shaved,

Can you necro-feel-it!

Aaahhhhh yeah... I like drugs
I do it when Iâm chillinâ
Aaaahhhhhh yeah... I like drugs
Iâve even snorted penicillin
If I can crush it - it goes up my nose
If itâs smack Iâll shoot it in between my toes
How old am I? Nobody knows!
My surgeon is my dealer so my age never shows!
Vicodin, Valium, Percocet and crack,
Everybody scream Heavy Metalâs back!
I like drugs but the donât like me

I like drugs but the donât like me
Iâm driving right now to the next party
I like drugs, I like drugs, I like drugs, but they donât like me

[Michael:] Oh shit man, Iâm getting pulled over again...
Ah I better chug these beers, whereâs those pills, shit?
[Cop:] Sir do you realize you were going 25mph on the freeway back there?
[Michael:] Well whatâs the fucking speed limit? 15 mph?
[Cop:] Sir do you have any Warrants?
[Michael:] I got their first CD, but you canât have it motherfucker! Later!
[Cop:] I got a 5150 on a 2112, Iâm following a 1984 yellow Camaro. Suspect looks like a chubby David Lee Roth... scratch that, more like a skinny version of Vince Neil!
