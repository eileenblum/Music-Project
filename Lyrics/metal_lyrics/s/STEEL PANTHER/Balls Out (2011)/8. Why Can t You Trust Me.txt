I want you to know one thing
You ain't getting an engagement ring, yeah
So if you want to keep being with me
Oh, you've got to give me just a little, little more space
Stop chasing me around all over the place
And checking all the comments on damn Myspace
And acting like a fricking nut

Why can't you trust me baby?
Why can't you trust me baby?
So I did a little blow, get off my back
It's not like I'm smoking crack
Why can't you trust me baby?

I want to tell you just one thing more
Don't treat me like a dirty man whore, yeah
'Cause I can walk right out your Mum's front door
Oh, you better treat me with a little, a little respect
Before I go Chris Brown and punch you in the neck
Keep your insecurities at fucking check
Before I fuck all your ugly friends, yeah
Why can't you trust me baby?
Why can't you trust me baby?
I must have caught something from the toilet seat
You know that I would never cheat
Why can't you trust me baby?
Why can't you trust me baby?
If you think I'll mess around then get a grip
Or you're gonna get a big fat lip

I tell you everything I do
Is always gonna be for you
But you never hear a word
You treat me like a fricking turd
Just like a big, juicy turd, yeah, yeah

You better open up your eyes and shut your trap
I ain't putting up with anymore of your crap
Stop threatening the bitches on my Facebook page
Or I'm gonna rip your head off in a cocaine rage
Why you gotta check my prison history?
Baby, why can't we just let it be a mystery?
Besides, everybody knows it was you
That blew Justin Bieber at the petting zoo

Why can't you trust me baby?
Why can't you trust me baby?
I'll speak real soft so you can understand
I don't cheat like the rest of the band
Why can't you trust me baby?
Why can't you trust me baby?
Our love is fragile like a piece of glass
Don't make me drop your big, fat ass
