Sleeping on a park bench in chilly October
Currently homeless, or is it foreclosure?
I need a place to stay, you say you'll grant my wishes
I got no money but you tell me I can wash the dishes

Sexual tension, we both can feel it
I got a swollen member, I can't conceal it
Slide into your Comaro you see my circumstance
You tell me if I stay my friend has to stay in my pants

Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Let me cum in your house tonight
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Let me sleep on your couch, alright
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Let me cum in your house tonight
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Wanna be with you yeah

I know you want me, you know I want you
'Cause you like musicians and I like people with boobs
Your lips are soft and wet, your cheeks so smooth and rosy
It must be nice inside, my cock will be so warm and cosy
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Let me cum in your mouth tonight
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Baby, swallow my creamy load, don't bite
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Let me cum in your mouth tonight
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
I'll give you something to chew, yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
I'll give you something to chew, yeah

Spreading your legs, I see it in your eyes
You're getting your eggs ready to fertalise
Don't get yourself excited 'cause I ain't going there
Don't need no kid to support, I'm going up in your rear

Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Let me cum in your ass tonight
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Your gluteus maximus, so tight
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Let me cum in your ass tonight
Let me cum in
Let me cum in
Your super duper pooper yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Something new to you yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Something new to you yeah

Whoa, nothing new to you
