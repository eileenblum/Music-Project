The food will be great
And the drinks will be free
And all the sexy girls will wanna party with me
The weed will be toked
And Columbian coke
Will be snorted off some strippers boobs and that's no joke

It's the party of the century that's right
Unfortunately it's tomorrow night
I'm going to a party
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night (yeah)
I'm gonna get some pussy
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
But tonight I'm gonna jerk off

It's in Beverly Hills
They got prescription pills
And Keifer fucking Sutherland is coming to chill
The got sushi and rice
Lowenbrau is on ice
In the living room they're playing naked twister and dice
The security and pussy will both be tight
But I'm on the list for tomorrow night!

I'm going to a party
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night (yeah)
I'm gonna get some pussy
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
But tonight I'm playing angry birds
Like a million other stupid nerds
But tonight I'm gonna burp the worm by myself!!!

Ponies and clowns will be walking around
Naked people having sex all over the ground
Britney Spears is making out with Christopher Walken
In the back yard Iron Maiden is rocking
The couch is on fire but nobody cares
Charlie Sheen is winning in the bedroom upstairs!!!!
Tomorrow night 
Tomorrow night

(Yeah)
I'm going to a party
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night 
Tomorrow night (Yeah)

Tomorrow night!!!!!
