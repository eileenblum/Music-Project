[Bonus Track]It's so fucking hot in here 
But the devil doesn't care 
The front row will be dripping wet 
But satan won't ever break a sweat 
He's in the car turning up the heat 
Burning my hands burning my feet 
Some cool lemonade would hit the spot cause it's really really really really really hot 

Hell's on fire 
Burning your body right to the core 
Hell's on fire 
You can fry an egg on the floor 
Mmmmm I like 'em scrambled 

Let's get drunk and smoke some pot 
I want to party with Bon Scott
Randy Rhoads, John Bonham too 
It's a heavy metal party and were waiting for you 

Hell's on fire 
The devil's hungry and he's eating light 
Hell's on fire 
Frying up a fillet soul tonight 

So hot, so hot
My skin is turing red
So hot, so hot
Good thing we're already dead 

[Guitar Solo]

Hell's on fire 
Hell's on fire 
Hell's on fire 
Were burnining burning burning burning burning burn 
Hell's on fire 

Erif on slleh
