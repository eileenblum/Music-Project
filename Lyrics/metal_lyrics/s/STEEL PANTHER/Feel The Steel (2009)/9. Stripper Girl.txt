I met you down at the Seventh Veil
The first night that I got out of jail
Your lips were red and your skin was pale
You were the one that I wanted to nail

Yeah.

I asked you for a table dance
You came over and put your hands in my pants
I ain't lookin' for no wild romance
but by the way: hey you got any blow?

Stripper girl
Heaven sent, pay my phone bill, pay my rent
Stripper girl
I love you, all my friends really love you too
I really love your boobies

I wanna love you til the end of time
I wanna love you in a 69
I wanna love you where the sun don't shine
Hey, where'd you put that coke? Cool.

[*Sniff*]

Take my cock into your backdoor
I wanna fuck you fuckin' whore
I wanna jam it in and out at a real fast pace
Til I squirt hot juicy all over your face

Stripper girl
Heaven sent, take one look and I pitch a tent
Stripper girl
You're the best, up all night on crystal meth

Yeah!

Sometimes you think that I'm a jerk
When you catch me fucking your friends from work
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
If you buy me an iPhone you can give me a call

[Guitar solo]

I really love you baby
I wanna watch you dance
I didn't mean to fuck your friend
Give me one more chance

Stripper girl
On my lap, hope I didn't give you the clap
Stripper girl
I need some cash, get on stage and shake that ass
Stripper girl
Heaven sent, thanks again for payin' my rent, yeah
Stripper girl
Stripper girl
Stripper girl
Stripper girl
Stripper girl
