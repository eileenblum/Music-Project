I saw her drinking beer
Eatin peanuts by the bar
I was pretty desperate and I knew she had a car
She said her name was Debbie
She was a friend Jenny Creggs
She had boobs like water melons and breathe like rotten eggs
I know your hungry
I can see it in your eyes
Cause your looking at me like I'm a side of fries
I want to take your chubby ass back to my place
And squirt my baby gravy all over your face Yeaaahh!!!
