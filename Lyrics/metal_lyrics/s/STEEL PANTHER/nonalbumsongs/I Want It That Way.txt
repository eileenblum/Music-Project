[originally by Backstreet Boys]You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
I can't reach to your heart
When you say
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
That I want it that way

Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know, that it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
That I want it that way

Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be,
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me...

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
You are, you're the only way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Don't wanna hear you say
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you sayÂ 
That I want it that way
