Let's go !

City nights, summer breeze makes you feel alright
Neon lights shining brightly make your brain ignite
See the girl with the dresses so tight
(Give your love) Give you love if the price is right
Black or white in the streets there's no wrong and no right
No right !

Other side, buy your kicks from the man in white
Feels alright, powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cryÂ 
(Like some girl) Like some girl it makes you wonder why
City life sure is cool
But it cuts like a knife, it's your life

So forget all that you see
It's not reality it's jut a fantasy

Can't you see, what this crazy life is doing to me

Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life
My life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life
Let's see you livin' now

[Solo]

So forget all that you see
It's not reality it's jut a fantasy

Can't you see, what this crazy life is doing to me

Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life
My life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life
