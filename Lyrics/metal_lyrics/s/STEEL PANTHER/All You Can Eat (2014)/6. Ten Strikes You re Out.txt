Flip them burgers man

Strike one, I saw you winking at my friends
I'll poke your damn eye so you'll never wink again
You'll never wink again

Strike two, you touched my damn iPhone
My other bitches call and check so leave it alone
Just leave it alone

Eight more and you'd better not doubt
You'll be out on the streets so don't make me shout
Everybody knows it's ten strikes you're out, you're out
Ten strikes you're out, you're out

Strike three, you gave my dog VD
How'd you fucking go give a dog VD?
That's just beyond me
Strike four, I don't remember four
But whatever it was well you'd better not do it no more

Strike five, well you're racking up strikes
Faster than your momma getting Facebook likes,
Everybody knows it's ten strikes you're out, you're out
Ten strikes you're out, you're out

Six and Seven came as a pair
Piss and shit stains all over your underwear
Well baby you're out, you're out, you're out, hahaha

Strike eight, you made me double date
With a bald dick head and a bitch who's overweight
That made me irate
Strike nine, I understand you had gas
But you farted and another dude's sperm dribbled out of your ass
That's fucking gross

Strike ten, well you drank my last beer
So baby pack your shit and get out of here
Everybody knows it's ten fucking strikes, you're fucking out
You're out, you're out, you're out

Ten strikes you're out, yeah
You're out
