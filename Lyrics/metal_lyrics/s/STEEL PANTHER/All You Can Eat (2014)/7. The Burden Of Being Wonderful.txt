Why in a world of ugly faces
should I be allowed to be so hot?
So many people without talent
yet I was born with all the magical gifts I got.

The perfect body, the perfect face
itâs like Godâs best work all in one place
But the haters hate perfection
Canât you see?

Itâs a burden being wonderful like me.

How in a world thatâs so imperfect
did I wind up with so much cool?
Friends never stick around too long
never feel like they belong
next to me they feel like a fool.

Iâve got the grace of a dancer, a golden voice
people seem to hate me like I had a choice
Being this blessed is a lonely way to be.

Itâs a burden being wonderful like me.

Like me.

So you say you wanna hang around
Donât ever ask me to tone it down
Iâm a diamond, Iâm gonna shine
compared to everyone else
Iâm like a whole damn diamond mine.

Oh yeah...

Iâm just a Maserati in a world of Kias
âGeniusâ would describe any of my ideas
If I was born in 1453
Leonardo Da Vinci would be jealous of me
but a world of Stevie Wonders never see.

Itâs a burden being wonderful like me.
