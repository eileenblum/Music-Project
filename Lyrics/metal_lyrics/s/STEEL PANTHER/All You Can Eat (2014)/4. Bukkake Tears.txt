You said you wanted to open up the doors to our bedroom
You said my cock was nice but left a little too much headroom
So I called some of the boys and I set it up
How was I to know you'd regret it, oh

There was so much love on your face I couldn't see the tears
There was so much spunk on your face neither the boys nor I could see the tears

I said it would turn me on to watch you get fucked by nine or ten guys
When you said you banged the football team your freshman year I was slightly surprised
But as I started letting out the dog in me, you flipped the switch and went back to monogamy

There was so much love on your face I couldn't see the tears
There was so much spunk on your face neither the boys nor I could see the tears

We can't stop now it's moving too fast
There's a nine inch cock in your pussy, ten and a half in your ass
Dongs in each hand so hold on tight when we all bust a nut I'm gonna make it right tonight

There was so much love on your face
There was so much love on your face
There was so much love on your face I couldn't see the tears
There was so much spunk on your face neither the boys nor I could see the tears
There was so much so much love, so much love on your face
There was so much, so much love

Sticky, gooey jizz on your face, yeah
Oh, your stupid sticky face
We're gonna give you our love

There was so much love on your face I couldn't see the tears
There was so much spunk on your face neither the boys nor I could see the tears
