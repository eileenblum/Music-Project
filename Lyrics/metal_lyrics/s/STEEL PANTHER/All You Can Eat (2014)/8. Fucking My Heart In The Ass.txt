The heart is cool
It's a magnificent machine and it don't have a brain but it thinks that you're being too mean
And it don't have legs, which is sad, 'cause it can't run away when you treat it bad
And if the damn thing had a mouth I'm sure it would say,

Oh yeah,
That you gotta stop fucking
Gotta stop fucking Gotta stop fucking
Fucking my heart in the ass
Won't you please stop fucking my heart in the ass,
Oh won't you please stop fucking my heart

You can kick me as hard as you want in the left ventricle
You can bite like a bitch with your teeth on my aortic arch
But I won't even flinch not an inch
It would be a cinch when compared to the pain of the emotional boner you shoved in my heart's ass today

Oh yah
Girl you never stop fucking
Never stop fucking
Never stop fucking
Fucking my heart in the ass
Won't you please stop fucking my heart in the ass
Oh yeah,
Won't you please stop fucking my heart
Fucking my heart in the ass

Baby can't you see this is starting to look like an epic fail
My heart's ass is starting to feel like it spent a week in jail
'Cause you're fucking my heart
Fucking my heart
Fucking my heart in the ass
