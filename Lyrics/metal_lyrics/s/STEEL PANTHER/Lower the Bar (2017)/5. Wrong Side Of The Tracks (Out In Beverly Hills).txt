My mansion is the size of a city block
I got a statue of David but he's missing his cock
I got my name monogrammed on the side of my jet
But I can't afford a hangar to park the thing yet

Tell me how is a guy to live

On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills

I got a twenty year old wife and she's eager to please
But she made me throw away my Dokken CD's
I got surround sound running through the whole damn house
And some Dokken's getting cranked
Just as soon as I figure the bluetooth out

Tell me how is a guy to live

On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
On the wrong side of the tracks... out in Beverly Hills

And every night there's Hollywood
Just beckoning from my neighborhood
Transvestites under street lights
Looking so tight, think I just might

I got a Filipino butler with a southern drawl
I can only sleep at night using Propofol
You can take a boy out of the trailer park, you see
But you never gonna get the trailer out of me, no

It's the only way I live

On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
(On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills)
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
(On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills)
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
(On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills)
