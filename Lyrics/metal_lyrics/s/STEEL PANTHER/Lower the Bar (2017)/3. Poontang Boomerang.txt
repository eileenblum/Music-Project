Met a girl on Tinder, about a year ago
Ass felt like a beanbag, stinky down below
She never got a call back, I couldn't get on that fatty
Yeah we're golfin' three days later, guess who shows up as my caddie?

Poontang Boomerang
Just can't throw her away
Dump her ass on a Friday night
She's back by Saturday
Sing it, Poontang Boomerang

My friend was gettin' married, and met the bride to be
It was pretty obvious, she wanted some of me
I told her just the one time, I would make an exception
Then she tried to suck my balls and her own wedding reception

Poontang Boomerang
Give that shit a hurl
But I can almost guarantee
I'm gonna wind up with that girl
Poontang Boomerang
Thought about goin' gay
The boomerang wang is even worse they say

Wow
Look out

You can chuck that whore, if you don't wanna fuck no more
But you better watch out Jack, cause that ass is comin' back
If you're tired of getting in her brown, you can take the next bus out of town
But you can't get far enough away, that bitch will you find any day
Change your name and cut your hair, move away to Timbuktu
But I'm tellin' you right now, that boomerang tang will follow you
You can chuck that whore, if you don't wanna fuck no more
But you better look out Jack, cause that ass is comin' back

Poontang Boomerang
That shit never fails
Sure as a bear shits in the woods
And sail boats have sails
Poontang Boomerang
Better wise up real quick
But the boomerang is as dangerous
Down under on your dick

Poontang Boomerang
Oh yeah
Poontang Boomerang
Wwwow
Poontang Boomerang
Awww
Poontang Boomerang
Oh yeah
Uh
