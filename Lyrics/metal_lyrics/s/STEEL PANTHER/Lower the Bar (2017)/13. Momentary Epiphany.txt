[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]When I look out to the stars
And confront my own mortality
I'm overwhelmed by desire to live
To do something more, to give
But time is short and I'll soon be dead
Or living in my uncle's pool shed
I get scared and I start to cry
Then I go to my room and get high
I get high

When I look back at history
On the shoulders of giants I see
We are standing you and me
We must not waste this opportunity
But just look at the shape I'm in
I wouldn't even know where to begin
I've been living so long in sin
I think I'll go and get high again
High again

Every moment we begin
Every moment we begin
Every moment we begin

Every moment we begin
Every moment we begin
Every moment we begin

Then we go get high again
