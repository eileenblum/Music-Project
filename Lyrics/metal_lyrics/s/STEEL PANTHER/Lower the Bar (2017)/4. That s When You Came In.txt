Every night I'd party till I was stupid stumbling drunk
And the walls were drenched in vomit spit and other peoples spunk
And an endless line of 18 year old stripper druggie whores
Would be winding to my bunk, from right outside the tour bus doors
But I couldn't help but want, for something just a little more

That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away

I was looking for a woman, more beautiful than most
And not just in the retouched facebook selfies that they post
Who'd refrain from talking only of herself when in my bed
Not that I'd ever consider it, but someone I could wed
I needed someone just like me, but I got idiots instead

That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away

Of all the girls I've ever known, you show me things no one could ever show me
It doesn't matter where you go, you'll always be the one I want to blow me
Cause you blow me away, whoo

I was ready to retire, maybe move to Mexico
One too many raucous parties, one too many skanky hoes
After all the critics said, our debut record was our peak
Now I couldn't hit the high notes, sometimes I couldn't even speak
But the band had dates in Germany, for just another week

That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away
You blew me away
You blew me away
You blew me away
