Don't need a certified public acountant
To run the numbers on my dick and balls
Don't need to look at every Amex statement
Already know I'm getting charged for the booty calls

Don't need a history of my transactions
To know the piper's going to get her due
It won't be long if there's a missing payment
She'll come for me like she's coming for you

Pussy ain't free, let me tell you, brother!
You'll pay for that shit one way or another!

She'll make you pay when you're out with your buddies
For every text that you choose to ignore
When you return, interrogation
Your dick is going on the waterboard!

Pussy ain't free, let me tell you, brother!
(Everybody pays, word to your mother)
You'll pay for that shit one way or another!
(Everybody pays one way or another)

This is not a choice you have that's only in your head
And when you're getting the 3rd degree
You'll remember what I said
Oh yeah cause p-p-pussy ain't free, boy, no

Pay with your gray hair and every wrinkle
Pay with a heart attack or maybe a stroke
Maybe you'll understand on your deathbed
The price of pussy, it ain't a joke!

Pussy ain't free, let me tell you, brother!
(You'll pay for that shit one way or another)
Pussy ain't free, let me tell you, mister!
(Baby, let me taste every single sister)
Pussy ain't free, everyone knows
Pussy ain't free, let me tell you, brother!

This is not a choice you have, it's only in your head
This is not a choice you have, it's only in your head
