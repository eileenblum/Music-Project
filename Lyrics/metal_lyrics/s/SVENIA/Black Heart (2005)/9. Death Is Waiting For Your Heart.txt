Sweet maiden in this starless night
Death is waiting for your heart
And chose you to be his endless bride
All is done to start the rite

And so baby come die in his arms
Come die in his arms...

Sweet maiden in this starless night
Death is waiting for your heart
May you receive heaven from a world
That deserves you no more

And so baby come die in his arms
Come die in his arms...

This in your end
Forever he will love you
This is your end
Forever he will love you

This in your end
Forever he will love you
This is your end
Forever he will love you
And so take his hand
Forever he will love you
And so take his hand
Forever he will love you

Forever he will love you...
