Buried is the light of day
And risen is the darkness of the night
Where I'm falling
Worried by the eyes of love
And cursed by the world of beyond
Only darkness anywhere

My blood is poison
And for all my life
I'm cursed by hell

M y body is a suffering tide
Lost in the darkness of the night
Where I'm falling
So shall I devour my life
Wandering alone in this plagued cry
Love is my sin

My blood is poison
And for all my life
I'm cursed by hell

What I feel in my heart...
What I feel in my heart...
What I feel in my heart...

My blood is poison
And for all my life
I'm cursed by hell
