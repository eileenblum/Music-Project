Love me to death my darling until the end
Love me to death I want to dream forever

You have come in the shadow of love
It wants you until the death
Our fate is in your eyes
Our fate is in your eyes

We will fly between the hell
And the heaven without being touched
Our love will not die
Our love will not die

Love me to death my darling until the end
Love me to death about the rest we don't care
Love me to death my baby take my hands
Love me to death I want to dream forever

I want to kiss your lips my love
666 times
For this one an after life
For this one an after life

You have come in the shadow of love
It wants you until the death
Our fate is in your eyes
Our fate is in your eyes

Love me to death my darling until the end
Love me to death about the rest we don't care
Love me to death my baby take my hands
Love me to death I want to dream forever
