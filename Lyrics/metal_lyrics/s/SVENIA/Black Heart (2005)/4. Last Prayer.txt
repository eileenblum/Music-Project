I will always be your pray
Tell me why my baby
I feel your heart far away
Hear my prayer light of my grave

Now I see my death is in your eyes
I' m praying you tell' me why
Tell me why my baby
Tell me why my baby

Love stained whit blood my life
and I bloody declaim this my last prayer
I will always be your pray
And drowned in tears I curse my fate

Now I see my death is in your eyes
I' m praying you tell' me why
Tell me why my baby
Tell me why my baby

Now I see my death is in your eyes
I' m praying you tell' me why
Tell me why my baby
Tell me why my baby
Tell me why my baby
Tell me why my baby
