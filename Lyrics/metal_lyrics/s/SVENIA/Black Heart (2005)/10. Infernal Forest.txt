Far in infernal forest dark and old
For you may some vault unfold
Where love is ready to welcome your sacrifice
Where the mystic moon is ready to welcome your eyes
Your eyes...

Your eyes in this forest
Your eyes in this forest
Your eyes in this forest
In this infernal forest

Your destiny is in my arms
Only flower in this forest
I want to touch your face
With my hands wrapped by flames
Where love is ready to welcome your sacrifice
Where the mystic moon is ready to embrace your eyes
Your eyes...

Your eyes in this forest
Your eyes in this forest
Your eyes in this forest
In this infernal forest

Your eyes in this forest
Your eyes in this forest
Your eyes in this forest
In this infernal forest
