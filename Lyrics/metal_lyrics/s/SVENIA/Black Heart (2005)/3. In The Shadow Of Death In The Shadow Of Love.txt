Don't open your eyes
Don't fear to die
You' ll find me saying I love you
On the way to eternal life
You are all to me
For this my soul is drown in pain
And in silence my ghost is crying
What I'd like hear
Is only you condemned love
So I sweetly say to you come...

Don't open your eyes
Don't fear to die
You' ll find me saying I love you
On the way to eternal life

Bury your life dear
Doom wont's us wed in the graveyard
Sleep quietly and I will wake up your heart
What I'd like hear
Is only you condemned love
So I sweetly say to you come...

Don't open your eyes
Don't fear to die
You' ll find me saying I love you
On the way to eternal life

Don't open your eyes
Save your heart that cries
This love is only for you
On the way to eternal life

Graceful girl in dress of pain
Welcome my soul there is no shame
Rise again my love
Rise again my love
Rise again my love

Don't open your eyes
Don't fear to die
You' ll find me saying I love you
On the way to eternal life

Don't open your eyes
Save your heart that cries
This love is only for you
On the way to eternal life
