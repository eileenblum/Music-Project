There is no rest in my days
Kill me whatever are the ways
My heaven is by your side
On the tomb of hendless love
Engraved in my life...
with you

I love the taste of your lips
That like at sleep of death
My heart is waiting for you
By your side is my place
On the tomb of my life...
with you

Kill me my sweet love
and make my soul glad
Leave on my lips the kiss of my death
Only in your arms I will find the rest..
I will find the rest

There is no rest in my days
Kill me whatever are the ways
My heaven is by your side
On the tomb of endless love
Engraved in my life...
with you

Kill me my sweet love
and make my soul glad
Leave on my lips the kiss of my death
Only in your arms I will find the rest
Live on my lips the kiss of my death
Kiss of my death
Kiss of my death
Kiss of my death
