Marry Mortuary
Leather jackets feed worms in a dead horse cemetery
Marry Mortuary
Kicking clouds with my boots in daisy-chain territory
Marry Mortuary
Feather fucks flash down our last anniversary
Marry Mortuary
Breaking vows when the cows graze hard out of a monastery
The cigarette's desperate smoke breathes lonely bomb threats
Marriages, carriages, split headaches, earthquakes
The cigarette's desperate smoke clouds are the only cancer I'll ever need
