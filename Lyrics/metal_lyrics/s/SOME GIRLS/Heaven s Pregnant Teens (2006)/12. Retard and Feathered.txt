All of you dead doves on sun-staining streets
Becoming soulmates with soles of my feet
Clipped little wings
Escaping the rain
Crash into windows and bruise their bird brains
The second verse is as bored as the first
Satanic gloom and barbiturate doom
Pawning guitars to heat up a spoon
You can't just eat shit on an empty stomach
And then act surprised at what comes out of it
