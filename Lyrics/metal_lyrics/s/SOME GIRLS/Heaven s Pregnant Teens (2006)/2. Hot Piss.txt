Fangs on flesh sink in soft skin
Throw your soul to the volcano
Where lava once erupted in your stomach now molten in the skull
Follow me
Swallow me down
I don't coma anymore
I map my way around the matressed floor
Angels of the underworld at night we dine
Your teeth will grind into mine
Fangs on flesh sink in soft skin
Just keep me out of the sun
You call me scum like I'm the only one
You call me scum like I'm the only one
