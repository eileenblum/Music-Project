It's kind of like love but a little more important
Kind of like sex but a little more impotent
Totally pregnant teens with erections
Of sunbathing dreams on the brink of dissections
Because it's too late to place faith in fate
I will pillage the village to rape
You are heaven's pregnant teens
If celibacy shakes afraid of snakes
Then we will slither into outer space
And if fertile beds should fall to the floor
We'll go down with it and conceive some more
