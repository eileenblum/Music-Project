In the kingdom of hell
You and I would bastardize the secrets we would tell to them
She fell on him
Into a bottomless well
Where we're the kings of hell
Black blood on a throne of skulls
Shake "We don't love you, we love we"
In the kingdom of hell
In a cavern called hell
In a chemical hell
You and me
The cross will crumble
