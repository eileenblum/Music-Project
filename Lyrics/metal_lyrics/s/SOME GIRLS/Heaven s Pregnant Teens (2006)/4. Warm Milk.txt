Don't blueprint me you casket designers
You're not dead like me you little lip-liners
Some powdered nose and some stranger's skull-fucked head
I want a little warm milk before bed
Spilling guts across the floor
I don't even lock the door anymore
We're in the world and we're on our knees
So we should all come together
Yeah we should all come together
I don't lock the door no more
So we should all come together
Yeah we should all come together with warm milk
