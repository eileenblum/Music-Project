As sun and dove over bat and moon
If we stay on this road we'll find religion soon
I plant the seeds that flower in veins
And destined down black-lit bathroom drains
Of sacraments and ends
Dead in a ditch death is the friend buried beneath drugged skin
My stand became a lean verse cigarette machine
Could cocaine candy console crippled children cavities?
The tears of flesh death burns
Now a miscentered mantelpiece in a porcelain urn
But what words will witches sing
While warlocks pluck away all day at their broken heartstrings
I took some gun from some sick hand
Said, "Count to ten."
Oh, one, two, three...
Fuck it, I don't care
And all of us widowed wives
Discussing dimensions in dream homes we hide
And it's not fair
These affairs are all I had
Instead I had to lie
Forget it
I get it
I guess it's true
I'd make a boring bride
