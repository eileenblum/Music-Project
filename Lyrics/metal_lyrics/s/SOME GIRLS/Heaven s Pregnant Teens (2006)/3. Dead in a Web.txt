Immortal memories dead in a web
Where we once wore our roaring head
Dead in a web
Boring people on bad cocaine
Dead in a web
Sandpaper tongues forked with terms of depression
Missing limbs thin under sweet obsession
God coming down pulling fuckers from bars
And sticking them in driver seats of cars
Track marks the spot of the stuttering dead
There's easier ways to blow of your head
