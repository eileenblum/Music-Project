Black Jesus on a burning cross
Even nuns get splashed by filth at bus stops
Under the moon and a veil
Skin splinters out of its jail
Where worship deceases its crud
Dead dogs under tires and mud
Sunday morning I'm going to lie
Sunday morning sorrow will die
Comets bleeding through black holes of crime
Comets falling from god's holy sky
Who will fuck when the people are all gone?
Who will fuck when the people are all gone?
I would smash the face of the world
Just smashing the face of the world
Smashing the face of the world
Sneaky little boys
Sneaky little girls
All children wrath hard of divorce
Yet they will aspire to wed
While the ring is stuck on the finger
You're sucking on the head in a bed
I couldn't care less what I say
I couldn't care less of your friends
I'm tired of trying to write
Everything's already been said
Feed me a hard skin as dead as a cat
Who will fuck when the people are gone?
