I fiend it fair
When hell will melt
The misery me and Joseph have felt
A stiff foul cross hangs hard 'round your neck
Over your chest where my head used to rest, but now...
Snaking my way as only serpents could
To the holy house where your love's nailed to wood
But through and through I'm obsessed with you
It's true, it's true, infesting you
It's just god's way of keeping us outside of their insides
Remember when the house burnt down?
