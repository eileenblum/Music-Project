As we're pricked with the sand spurs of time
Who will feed the dogs when our neighbors have died?
A cherry blossom kisses anti-depressants of old brides
When the bulbs all disappear
Don't flick your lighter over here
Dee eye vee oh are see es eye in
Es tee ee ee pea el ee es oh in
Ef eye are eek ay ee ee pea oh in
Bee you are in eye in gee em ee
Ex nuns between the legs with whiskey
As we're pricked with the sand spurs of time
Who will feed all the dogs when you've died?
