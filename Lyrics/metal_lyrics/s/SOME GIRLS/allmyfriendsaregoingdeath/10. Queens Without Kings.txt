Don't get me wrong i know something is wrong
And now we're gonna dance to a different song
No lovers or blankets are keeping me warm
Between two cities decisions are torn
When you leave, sometimes you leave a lot
I came up with thoughts, and this is what i got
I would say that i think it's a good thing
I left that fucking hill
Cause next time i slipped on ice
I was fucking staying there
And as "man" has discovered
Ice is fucking cold
