I couldn't be who your god
Wants me to be
He's never even introduced himself to me
I would be more inclined
If "he" was a "she"
"i'm hearing your plan
But no thank you m 'am"
In romans 1:18 thru 32
I read what you wrote
That shit isn't true
I am a fly on the wall
Of a bachelorette's ball
I see your bluff and i'm gonna call
Yes, i sing the blues
