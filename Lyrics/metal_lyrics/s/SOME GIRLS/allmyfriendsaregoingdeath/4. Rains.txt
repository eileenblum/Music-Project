You were born with a choice at least
So i'm not dropping any sympathy
And in my head i'm on my porch
Buildings across the street from me
Living lives too complete for me
Faces far too sweet for me
Hey, these are the rains you've read about
(and it's all coming down)
And I can't discredit beggars
Cause I for one have begged
I.e. dear world please leave me alone
Dear world please find me a home
And I'm not asking for a lot
Fuck
I'm only wanting
To slip through the pavement
Christ
These are the rains you've read about
