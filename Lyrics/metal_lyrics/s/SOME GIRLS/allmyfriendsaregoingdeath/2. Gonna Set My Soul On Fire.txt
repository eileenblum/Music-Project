Our lipstick' s lined some luscious lips
Up and down the vegas strip
I walked solo, so slow, alone
We all want something to call our own
There' s a bible in the drawer to keep you from sinning
There' s a lock on the window to keep you from jumping
There' s a black cloud in the sky to keep you from winning
There is drinks on the house so here' s to new beginnings, you fucks
