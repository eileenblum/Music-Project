Cut it 'til it's gutted
I let my weight fluxuate, fuck
Yes, love is a jellyfish and I clean my stings with tenderized piss
No, I don't care very much
You keep your mouth fucking shut when you talk to us
The dream machine will take it's tilt
The fear will bloom, the heart will wilt
Friends forever fucking each other's fuck-friends
These are the 'ins and outs' and I'm out to win
Fuck it
Thank God I love my life
Thank God I love my friends
With all this lithium, the stability could never end
