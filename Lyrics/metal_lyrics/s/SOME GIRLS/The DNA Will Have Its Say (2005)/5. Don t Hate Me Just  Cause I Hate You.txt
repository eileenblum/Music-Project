Crowded couples sipping sucking sex
Under bleachers, student teachers know best
Yea, well, fate is fucking romantic if you can get off on failure
Right on reds and left at an altar
"Oh now I want to cry.
I don't try, I don't try, I wanna die"
People say that you're stuck on yourself
Just because you aren't stuck on anyone else
Anyone else?
This could kill you
But so could I
This could swallow you whole
But so could I
