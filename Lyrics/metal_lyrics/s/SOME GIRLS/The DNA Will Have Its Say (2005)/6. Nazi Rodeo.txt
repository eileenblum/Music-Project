Corner-sitting in a club that I'm sure to love
All for a better view of the very few things in life that I am already sure of
(The things I love)
And I go: "Hands caressing the skin, they're dying to get in"
Even the winners lose
You know the trigger to pull your weight
To give me headache
So dance
Talk shit
And throw your guns in the goddamn air
