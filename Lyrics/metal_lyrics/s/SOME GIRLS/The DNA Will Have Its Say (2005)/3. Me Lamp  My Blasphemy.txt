It is very true
Part of my skeleton is stained black and blue
A decline in health
Irreconciliable differences with myself
A flock of crows circling my head
They used to come and go
Now they shriek, "Dead dead dead..."
Come apart at the seams
Come part the seas
Come party with me in a deathbed left for dead
You don't think about the future when you are this fucked in the head
