Dark horizon for my December soul
Dramatic serenades to be heard

Dark horizon for my December soul
Dramatic serenades to be heard
I am the lord of all the lost souls
Doomed to walk the earth
The light in my eyes no longer exists
It dies on that night
The tragedies in my life still exist
In the deeper depths of this cold soul

Into slumber, into sleep...we access the endless abyss
Once a king, now crowned the fool...I am the king of fools
Agony, suffer in the souls of a thousand men
A blood dripping heart â for a moment
Stand still...stands still...the torment
Howls in the night â dark shades of the dark

Horror dwells underneath the skin
An endless masquerade
No rest for this wicked soul
Free from torture thoughts

Leave this world behind
Release this bitter soul
Heaven, oh, so cold
A darker place Iâll see

Doomed to walk the earth
But I forever dwell
In the deepest of your mind
Where no one else can dwell...

Leave this world behind
Release this bitter soul
Heaven, oh, so cold
A darker place Iâll be
I am doomed to walk the earth
But I forever dwell
In the darkest of your mind
Where no one else can dwell...

Better left among the dead
Cleansed from this dark earth
Soon I again shall arise
To a better world and life...

Better left among the dead
Cleansed from this dark earth
Soon I again shall arise
To a better world and life...
