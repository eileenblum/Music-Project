Curse the hours of the night
Sleepless night
No other demons in sight
Apathy in a fading dream

Curse the hours of the night
Sleepless night
No other demons in sight
Apathy in a fading dream
I am forlorn, I am left for dead

A mournerâs kiss

They ended weeping at my grave
Blame the cross around your neck
Cursed are now, this cold earth
Let us return to the eve
All in tears â the night bright as heaven
Age of the heartless â this world shall burn!
The hand of doom â awake â arise!
Like creatures of the night
The hand of doom â awake â arise!
Like creatures of the night
A thirst for the âopium roseâ
In the kingdom of the fallen

The lost, the one with death in his eyes
Forthcoming damnation
A hunger to become extinct
As I surrender to my eternal father
To be buried in thy hallowed earth
Bring justice to my soul
Formed in flesh â all evil
Mortal men â mightier than God?
Guard the key to the gates of hell
In the kingdom of the fallen
The lost, death from the skies
Forthcoming damnation

Guard the key to the gates of hell
In the kingdom of the fallen
The lost, death from the skies
Forthcoming damnation
Glory, glory to the brave
With solemn hearts weâll part
Not sympathy for the darkness
Nor enigma night I will praise

Observe the wooden coffin
They weep and mourn for my soul
White lilies â pales faces
Oh, hark! A tearful romance
Oh, he shall endure by coming in the flesh
To a lustful life and to a cursed death
