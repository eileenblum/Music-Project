Feel this riverâs rage
Tearing up your heart
Feel this riverâs rage...this riverâs rage

You say this world must end
I feel this world on my shoulders
Gather flames and alight your pyre
Burn your hands and feel the fire
Vanish in shadows I am leaving no trace
A wicked world on my shoulders to embrace...yeah!

A wicked world on my shoulders to embrace
In the blackest of night â a fear of sleep
Close my eyes now â wide awake!
Nightmares coming to haunt my soul!

Repent and fall on your knees
Dark eyes...horror inside
Deepest dreams youâre still there
In hell Iâll arrive with death by my side
Crushing claws tight around my neck
A relief â come to me now
The morning I welcome â not dead in my sleep...

Is this the moment of my death?
Or just another day I will live through?
Is this the moment of my death?
Or just another day I will live through?

You say this world must end
I feel this world on my shoulders
Gather flames and alight your pyre
Burn your hands and feel the fire
Vanish in shadows I am leaving no trace
A wicked world on my shoulders to embrace...yeah!

Digging for you...I am digging for you
The beauty of your grave
Deepest and deeper...deeper and deeper...
Earth coffins for the sinners
The hours of forever...timeâs up for you...
The hours of forever...timeâs up for you...

Feel your riverâs rage
Deep inside of you
Feel your riverâs rage
Too close to you...
Feel your riverâs rage
Deep inside of you
Feel your riverâs rage
Too close to you...
