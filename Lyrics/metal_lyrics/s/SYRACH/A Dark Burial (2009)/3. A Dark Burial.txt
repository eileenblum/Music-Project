Celebrate...I celebrate the days of wrath
An age of new blood...
A trail in the snow so pure and red
As I haul her to the lake...

Dark desires...kept deep in heart
Enter the dark...beyond voices of mankind
Creeping, crawling towards the light
My face vanishes from your eyes...

Close your eyes, welcome your god
My strong hands holding you down
Touch of deathâs angels filling your soul
Welcome the light of a new world

Howl water howl...your tomb, calm and cold...
Lay down...let me guide you
Do as I say...let the black water embrace you...

Standing at deathâs door...fire in my hands
Walk the path with serpents...wash out the demons
The shadows of your soul...of your soul!

The cry of despair...deep is your dirge
Weak and torn â I took your soul
Let you be mine, forever!

Bring the nightmare â close the chapter
A short breath, soon nothinâ at all
The grim reaper â me â cloaked in dark...
Your body sentenced to sleep, go!

The fear...still hides in your eyes
A roaring fire...soon put to rest
Free now...or forever in pains?
The roaring fire...no longer in your chest

Bring the nightmare â close the chapter
A short breath, soon nothinâ at all
The grim reaper â me â cloaked in dark...
Your body sentenced to sleep...

Hands of horror, hands of death
The ecstasy â the risk in one kiss
The knife...forced by the devilâs touch
The serpent lives inside my soul...
I sank into earth at the lakeside...
I almost walked away, prayed for my sins...
