Read for me the words of the dead
Fathers of the dark
I stumble forth in misery
Read me the words of the dead

In darkness I sigh
Arrival of the fallen
A longing for the heavens
A night of burden
In darkness I sigh
Arrival of the fallen
A longing for the heavens
A night of burden

Remember the fallen
See them hang at the gallows
Remember the buried
Died for their forefathersâ sins

As I walk, the skies grew black
As I stopped and never looked back
For those once loyal...yet so false
I sighed again and sealed my lips

Let us celebrate the dead
Let us celebrate this journey to the end
Let me enter the garden of delights

If I shall rise from the ashes
Bloodstained and hurt
The scars â kisses of Judas
They have been with me â with me from birth
Scream to me the words of the dead
Forge the fathers of the dark
If I stumble forth in misery
I read for you...the words of the dead
The words of the dead
