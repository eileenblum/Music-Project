I can hear the sound of a thousand voices ringing for a chance to be found
their hopeless

Face down can you find the light within the shadow that surrounds
I see the pain you feel like shards of glass in an open wound

You must rise to the task seek out the venom consuming you
reject the poison, only light can renew

Restore the truth
revive what you know true
from the depths of despair
revive what you know true.
