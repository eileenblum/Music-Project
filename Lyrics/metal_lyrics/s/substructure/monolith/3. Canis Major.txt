Life is the means to suffering
where one ends another begins
feasting on each others struggles

We must break this cycle cut the ties that bind
to this hellish rage mankind continues
to devour each other with no remorse

We must end this constant struggle
awaken the ghost in the shell
we must end this constant struggle
revive mankind from hell

Can you feel it? The struggle in your heart?
the seed's been planted will the roots take or will you starve

Taken from ruin
reformed to begin again

With eyes now open
can you see the light thats up ahead
these roots have sunk to deep
for this to be the end.
