Are we the cursed ones?

You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.
The terror you have made comes to pass on you now

I am an awakened being eyes open to what I lack
I am an awakened being I can show you the world with the veil torn back
eyes open with the veil torn back
I am an awakened being

My hands are made a new
the scales on my eyes fall like ashes to the ground
Sight I once knew but lost I now have found

Are we the cursed ones
We ask ourselves this every day
eyes open awakened beings
do not be lead astray

We have fallen to the ground
but the truth is
we have the strength to abound.
