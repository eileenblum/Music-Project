From horror perfection will arise
from the hearts of man all will be

From the hearts of man all will be demised
from the souls of flame hope will arise

Look to the sky can you see these heavens above us
seemingly out of reach but ever closer do they come
and as the world around us falls to the morningstar
the sun arises burning with a cleansing fire.
