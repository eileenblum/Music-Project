Fear runs high
or the war for the outcome of all men
approaches faster then a storm on the strongest wind
and yet as the hour nears and our fears become reality
the silent masses wont stand up instead embrace defeat

Have we become so blind
that we cant see our own fallacy

We must rise up for the apathy of man will surely lead us to our end
but with this duty will we make the best of it

I cant see an end to all this constant bickering
a body once divided cant stand united against this coming storm

Some only care for what they think is right you refuse to acknowledge those who are on your side kings of hypocrisy.
Some stand aside at war without a will to fight, their weakness devours what strength they had a man without his might coward

All will fall in time

Now face the truth misanthropy has plagued us all
so will you find the narrow path or will you start to fall

Rise up this disunity is killing us
we must bond together or this world will bury us.
