This world that we live in has become a farce
of the identity we could have had
we now lie in a state of ruin simply destroying everything we can
the grace were given has been exploited to the furthest end
the creator we have avoided is now calling for us to ascend

The air we breathe is starting to run out
the light we see is beginning to burn out

A generation of vipers
cant be enough to bring us down
we will be the catalyst to ignite the spark
these flames burning in the hearts of many
all will know the name of the Just One
redeemer crowned most high

My heart is heavy
carry me on your wings
my heart is heavy
I reach to the sky

I fear the lights will fade to dim
if we cant find the narrow path

I find hope is the only thing that we have left
grace is the only way we can forget
the pain weve caused ourselves
we cannot escape
we must rise together ascend to a better place

This is the beginning of a new age of man
we will find glory in the name of the king
the serpent has been crushed by the archetype of everything.
