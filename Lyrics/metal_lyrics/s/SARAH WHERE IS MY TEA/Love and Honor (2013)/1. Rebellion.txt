(This is a new shit by fucking sarah where is my tea from fucking russia)Â 

Hey hey hey hey hey hey heyÂ 

Let's go let's goÂ 
We wanna go aheadÂ 
This is a revolution bitchesÂ 
Our lungs breathe this nasty airÂ 
We can't hide it anymoreÂ 
This is rebellion for everyoneÂ 
Go go go goÂ 
My friends and meÂ 
We wanna go aheadÂ 
This is a revolution bitchesÂ 

This is a revolution for me and my friendsÂ 
This is a music from my heart and I'll make you screamÂ 
I'll make you screamÂ 

(Come on little closer bastardsÂ 
I wanna feel your breathing and sweaty hands on my microphone right now)Â 

We live for rock'n'rollÂ 
I've built myself a life that my parents disallowÂ 
We live for rock'n'rollÂ 
We're the dregs of society and this Is Rock'n'RollÂ 

We see another world where there's another paintsÂ 
You have enough brains to see the sameÂ 
We see another world where there's another paints
