Monochrome landscape reflected in my eyes and I'm in loveÂ 
I love these quiet placeÂ 
These lands help me forget about everything I left behindÂ 
But not about you but not about youÂ 
Thousands of miles between us burn my mindÂ 

Trying to find the closest way to youÂ 
But I can't die...Â 

So far away So far awayÂ 
So far away tonight todayÂ 
So far away So far awayÂ 
So far away tonight todayÂ 

Tremendous distance only makes us be apartÂ 
This desperation gives me hope but I can't standÂ 

I don't think about death but I'll be with youÂ 
Holding hands in the darknessÂ 
Just gonna play this fucking hazard every dayÂ 

We live only once and we gotta have a heartÂ 
With every dirty word just dive into the darknessÂ 
We value the wrong things without knowing who we want to beÂ 
Without knowing who we want to seeÂ 

My heart now - she calls it her homeÂ 
I'm happy that you take my soulÂ 

Trying to find the closest way to youÂ 
And I can't die cause you're so far awayÂ 

So far away
