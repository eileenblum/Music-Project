They tell me that I try run away from problemsÂ 
These words don't make me cry these words just make me strongerÂ 
Yeah I'm going off but I promise to loveÂ 
Thanks for my first toy although I was bad boyÂ 
When I had a chance I lost itÂ 
I've a second chance I lose itÂ 
And leaving me you don't know why I did itÂ 
Keep do itÂ 
This is the first part of novel about my heartÂ 
Another sad story about what I've done and what I've gotÂ 

Stop these voices that disturb meÂ 
Stope these voices please don't hurt meÂ 
This is the dark side this is your lifeÂ 
How I can fight with the fakeÂ 
This is my life this is my sideÂ 
And I've accepted my fateÂ 
Breathe air masses sleep with facelessÂ 
I'm so scared to be here foreverÂ 
This is the dark side this is your lifeÂ 
How I can fight with the fakeÂ 
This is my life this is my sideÂ 
And I've accepted my fateÂ 

Just a couple of days and I feel the sameÂ 
Just a couple of drops and I know I'm lostÂ 
It never was warm in my heart but I can stand hereÂ 
I can stand here but I don't live here
