[feat. August]So take me take me homeÂ 
Take me homeÂ 

Old stars just fall into the abyssÂ 
New horizons give us hopeÂ 
And our dreams turn to dust and debrisÂ 
There isn't desire to live and loveÂ 
We are as wolf and fox our angel makes us loveÂ 
We're ready to flirt with deathÂ 
We're ready to pay in fullÂ 
One year is like 3 secondsÂ 
12 seconds of heaven with youÂ 

Lights of the universe that we saw every nightÂ 
Lost in our real life foreverÂ 
It's my fault and I won't denyÂ 
These youthful memories are stuck in my mindÂ 
We will look we will here till it makes us apartÂ 

So take me take me homeÂ 
Take me home so take me homeÂ 
I'm just a homeless animalÂ 
And I could never get enough of youÂ 
I'm just a homeless animalÂ 
And I could never get...Â 

Forgive my sins forgive meÂ 
I'm not the kid I used to beÂ 
Set me free set me freeÂ 
So take me home I see youÂ 
I see you're almost hereÂ 
Set me free set me free
