When I was a child I didn't see anythingÂ 
I loved my mother and all people around meÂ 
Looked in the sky and talked with my only friendÂ 
That haunted me all my childhood What I've done?Â 

It eats me from the inside No? Why?Â 
This is a cancer in my mindÂ 
Where is the truth? Show me the truthÂ 
Absolve me from this raveÂ 

Ever since this began I saw how death approached me so closeÂ 
The agony - it's all what I felt 3 years agoÂ 

No No No No this devil scoffs at meÂ 
No No No No one thought in my head - don't give upÂ 

One thought in my head - don't give upÂ 
We have survived doomsdayÂ 
One thought in my head - don't give upÂ 
Believe in yourself every dayÂ 

(We try to find the idols into the dust but the idols are inside us)Â 

The idols inside us
