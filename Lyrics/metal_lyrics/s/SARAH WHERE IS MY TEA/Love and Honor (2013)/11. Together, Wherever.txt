How far are we willing to go?Â 
This endless circle of victories and failuresÂ 
The sun don't smile usÂ 
But we don't erase our happiness from facesÂ 
We were born between these cold mountains and we'll die thereÂ 
There're a two things there's a one hopeÂ 
Is this game worth it?Â 
We'll surely winÂ 

Even when we can not sleepÂ 
We continue draw our dreamsÂ 
Don't loose hopeÂ 
It's deep insideÂ 
It's just in my mindÂ 
Just stay srongÂ 
I still sing this songÂ 
I still sing this songÂ 

Together wherever Together whereverÂ 
Together wherever Together whereverÂ 
We're all singing itÂ 
We're all singing itÂ 
We're all singing itÂ 

We are still hereÂ 
We are still hereÂ 
Years go byÂ 
Our hands are closedÂ 
We'll never say good-byeÂ 

How far are we willing to go?Â 
This endless circle of victories and failuresÂ 
We're confusedÂ 
Is it a game or is it real?Â 
This virus in our minds in our bloodÂ 
Any cross can't eject thatÂ 
There's a reason there's a missionÂ 
Everything we do - we were born for thisÂ 

I still sing this songÂ 
We're all singing itÂ 
I still sing this songÂ 
We're all singing itÂ 
I still sing this song
