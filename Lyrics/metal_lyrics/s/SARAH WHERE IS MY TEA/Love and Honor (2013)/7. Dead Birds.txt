I'm leaving this town with angerÂ 
Few seconds to forget your faces to erase them from the memoryÂ 
Erase you and your fucking friendsÂ 

I hate I hate your voices your mind and actionsÂ 
It lives in me I feel this hatred from the beginningÂ 

Your eyes are full of bloodÂ 
You didn't try to stopÂ 
I see no reason to live like you and the crowdÂ 
My life would be better without youÂ 

Everything I see Is my beliefÂ 
You are with me and I can't forget youÂ 
When the lights go out we're powerlessÂ 
So go get it go get itÂ 

I dreamed about a better placeÂ 
And I've been looking for a traceÂ 
Show me the door to nowhereÂ 
Show me the door to nowhereÂ 
Show me the endÂ 
The end of this false heavenÂ 
Show me the endÂ 
The end of this false heavenÂ 

Ok, another dayÂ 
Another day in the same placeÂ 
Green trees become greyÂ 
Green streets or highway?Â 
Cheap whores change my faceÂ 
Fuck this placeÂ 
I can and you canÂ 
We can change it and don't gonna eat that shitÂ 
From my daddy's TV please momma don't hate meÂ 
I just wanna live like allÂ 

You're doomed reading your last spellÂ 
You're dead birds flying to hell
