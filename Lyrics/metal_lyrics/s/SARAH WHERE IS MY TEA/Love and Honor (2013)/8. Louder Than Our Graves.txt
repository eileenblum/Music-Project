Break Break the system that we have madeÂ 
Change Is it possible to change something?Â 
Cz I believe in the crowdÂ 
Break and changeÂ 
This is the anthem in our stupid headsÂ 
In my headÂ 

You saw who I amÂ 
I tried to wake up to wake up and understand thisÂ 
I'm just like you You're just like meÂ 
We're nothing but wanna be everythingÂ 
We're nothing but wanna be everythingÂ 

We undervalue that our blood is powerfulÂ 
Wasting time on the hillsÂ 
We lose our minds and the future foreverÂ 

I don't want to see my graveÂ 
Ð¡ause our graves are uselessÂ 
We won't allow thisÂ 

Death around me once again againÂ 
And my wounds are bleedingÂ 
Oooh bleeding Oooh bleedingÂ 
Overcoming the war I'll be a heroÂ 
Your son will ask you about meÂ 
Oooh about me oooh about meÂ 
You'll answer with prideÂ 

This is the anthem in our stupid headsÂ 
Again and againÂ 
This is the anthem in our stupid headsÂ 
Again and againÂ 

Stars look at me but I don't ask for mercyÂ 
Only sky can hear that we're screaming louder
