Everything I hadÂ 
I've buried that 10 years agoÂ 
And everything I haveÂ 
Your picture in the hip pocket.Â 

This is justÂ 
A piece of that photographyÂ 
This is justÂ 
A spot in my memory.Â 

I write with bloodÂ 
I haven't inkÂ 
With every letterÂ 
I'm losing self-controlÂ 
When I'm standing on a cliffÂ 
I can not decide.Â 

Life or deathÂ 
The end or helpÂ 
...This is the entrance...Â 
Sky or holeÂ 
This is the entranceÂ 
To another world.Â 

I...Â 
Pray when I see people passing byÂ 
To see your face and blinding lightÂ 
To lose my sight like it's first timeÂ 
I don't need anything more.Â 

...I'm praying...Â 
Pray when I see people passing byÂ 
...To see your face...Â 
To see your face and blinding lightÂ 
To lose my sight like it's first timeÂ 
I don't need anything more.Â 

I don't need anything... [3x]Â 
More.Â 

I hurt every timeÂ 
I think about thatÂ 
I already forgotÂ 
About water and breadÂ 
You are my hunger, my thirstÂ 
Am I ready to suffer?Â 

Life or deathÂ 
The end or helpÂ 
...This is the entrance...Â 
Sky or holeÂ 
This is the entranceÂ 
To another world.Â 

Breathe...Â 
Breathe the one last timeÂ 
And runÂ 
To the best life.Â 

This is a nightmareÂ 
You'd better live thereÂ 
This is a nightmareÂ 
But it's worth it to sleep.Â 

Fuck this! [2x]Â 

[2x:]Â 
This is a nightmareÂ 
You'd better live thereÂ 
This is a nightmareÂ 
But it's worth it to sleep.Â 

I...Â 
Pray when I see people passing byÂ 
To see your face and blinding lightÂ 
To lose my sight like it's first timeÂ 
I don't need anything more.Â 

...I'm praying...Â 
Pray when I see people passing byÂ 
...To see your face...Â 
To see your face and blinding lightÂ 
To lose my sight like it's first timeÂ 
I don't need anything more.
