You don't want to be aloneÂ 
But nobody's leavingÂ 
This is your only fearÂ 
There's a place for me inside youÂ 
I need to touch your heartÂ 

We burn in love and we love itÂ 

Your frozen heart like a solid stoneÂ 
and I repent I repentÂ 
Your frozen heart like a solid stoneÂ 
and I repentÂ 

FrailtyÂ 
I deny it more and moreÂ 
in my veins head and armsÂ 
I deny it more and moreÂ 
I deny only pride nowÂ 
I deny only pride nowÂ 

You don't want to be aloneÂ 
But nobody's leavingÂ 
This is your only fearÂ 
There's a place for me inside youÂ 

Your frozen heart like a solid stoneÂ 
and I repent I repentÂ 
Your frozen heart like a solid stoneÂ 
and I repentÂ 

YeaaaaaahhhÂ 
Mo-mo-mo-mo-move!Â 
Come on!Â 

OoooooohÂ 
We will move backÂ 
OoooooohÂ 
We will...Â 

FrailtyÂ 
I deny it more and moreÂ 
In my veins head and armsÂ 
I deny it more and moreÂ 
I deny only pride nowÂ 
I deny only pride now
