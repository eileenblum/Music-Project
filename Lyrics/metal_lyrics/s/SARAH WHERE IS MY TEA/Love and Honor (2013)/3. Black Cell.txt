These white walls don't make senseÂ 
Cause we can not change thisÂ 
All the promises we've madeÂ 
Ðre the promises we've paid forÂ 

Rain on the streets I feel pain in my kneesÂ 
Forgiveness ForgivenessÂ 
What have I done to deserve this?Â 
I don't know but I wanna liveÂ 

What have I done to deserve this?Â 
It is your right to choose who's nextÂ 
What have I done to deserve this?Â 
The voices whisper to meÂ 
Wake up and be strongÂ 
If something goes wrongÂ 
Wake up and be strongÂ 
The voices whisper to meÂ 

No pain no hope only tears fallÂ 

Your eyes can tell everythingÂ 
Your eyes can tell more than you thinkÂ 
Your eyes can't talk any moreÂ 
Cause you're not breathingÂ 
Your eyes can tell everythingÂ 
Your eyes can tell more than you thinkÂ 

No pain no hope only tears fallÂ 
No pain no hope only tears fallÂ 
You should be here my guardian right nowÂ 
One life one chance one coffinÂ 
We'll be there So when? So when? So when?Â 
You should be here my guardian right now
