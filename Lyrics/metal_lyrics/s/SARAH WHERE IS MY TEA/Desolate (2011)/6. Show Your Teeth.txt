No life costs these pitiful cash
Cold blade cuts your flesh
Lie still don't worry
We'll take only your skin
To sell it for little money
No life costs these pitiful cash
Lie still don't worry
We'll take only your life
We need a lot of greenbacks
You'll die I'm sorry
I look in your pitiful eyes
No life costs these pitiful cash
No life costs these pitiful cash
Don't worry bro
I'll take off your scalp
And hang on my wall for beauty
Where there are hundreds like you
Your fur shoulders doesn't makes you sexy
Doesn't makes you fashion
But it makes you a bitch
Take it off
Lie still don't worry
You'll die I'm sorry
We'll take only your skin
To sell it for a little money
Sell it for a little money
For a little money
