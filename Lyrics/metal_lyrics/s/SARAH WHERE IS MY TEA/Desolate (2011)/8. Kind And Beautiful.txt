This fucking evil world
Drink up the last glass of whiskey and die shameful death
Before leaving I want to kiss your bloody lips
If I' want I'll torment If I want I'll kiss
Or I will fuck your fucking deadly mouth
Because I'm crazy and I wanna kill you now and you will die long hard
Fingers become blue
Horror in my eyes
I'm afraid I don't want to look at violence
Oh my god
Blood
More and more
The white light has changed to black gray
I don't want I can't live in this evil fucking world
Where is blood and nothing else
I hate this world and fuck you all
I wanna lots of smiles
Light and good things
We can't stand without it
Or people will die
You have made this world such
Abundance of corpses of women and children
Die shameful death
You have made this world such and thereâs nothing to change
I see what is happening
And tears from my eyes
Fall to the ground slowly flowing down
