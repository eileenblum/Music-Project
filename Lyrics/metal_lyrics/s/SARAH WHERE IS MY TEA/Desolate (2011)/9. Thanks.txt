Iâll never let you go and never lose you
You give me everything
Find it for me
You give me everything
I need warm
Grab you with stranglehold
Squeeze till blue bruises
You'll understand how much emotions I feel to you
On the last days
I understood how much do you mean for me
I was a fool I didn't realize
You are the air I breathe
You are the air I breathe
And until I breath
Go near them and don't stop
Never lose
And you must take your luck till the end
Many things are impossible without you
I'm weak I don't have enough strength
I need you my friends
My sincere eyes
And time has come
Has come
When i repent and apologize
No need to hide and be ashamed
I want to say thank you for that you're here
