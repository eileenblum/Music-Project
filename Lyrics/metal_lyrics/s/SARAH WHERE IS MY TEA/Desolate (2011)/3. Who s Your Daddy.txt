Smirk on my face every day
When I remember your face
Hide your pride
You don't deserve the book to be written about you
You are the first after god
You are the first
Are you better than a shit?
I don't think so
And nobody thinks
Stand out from the crowd
It's necessary for you
You're an incredible man with lots of secrets
Your conduct is unacceptable
People don't like your lies
Everyone hates
Whose trust you've tamed?
Brainless children father's sons who will be just like you
Rich but worthless
Expensive outside but cheap inside
Hide you pride
You don't deserve it
