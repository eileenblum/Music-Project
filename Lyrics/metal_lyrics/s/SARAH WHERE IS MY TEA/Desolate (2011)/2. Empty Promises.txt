I was impressed by your beautiful words
Show me your expression again
You've completed your mission
Spat on everyone
You have only your needs and desire to entertain
People like a sponge
Before you know they'll absorb everything that you thrust us every day
Strangle your throat
And don't give a chance to dissipate your promises
Don't give a chance
You threaten me
What a fuck? You're sick
Sale everything for the sake of principle
You threaten
And poor people are in fear believing every your word
I won't forget this words are in my head forever
Give me freedom
I won't forget this words
For crying out loud
Please stop and think about all
About everyone
You are myth buster about honest human
This day for you to tame your fear
Your word is a new empty promise
I won't forget this words are in my head forever
Give me freedom
My dreams are your promises
