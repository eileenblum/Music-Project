The regular day is over
Warm shower washes off all negative criticism
And dirty words you've heard
Erases of memory all angry faces you saw
A cup of tea superlight cigarettes
Bright red sunset all it makes me calm
The Sun Sleeps
Light summer breeze blows my shoulders
When city is dead and I'm calm
And I have no problems
Endless night
Thoughts memoirs questions and answers only now
