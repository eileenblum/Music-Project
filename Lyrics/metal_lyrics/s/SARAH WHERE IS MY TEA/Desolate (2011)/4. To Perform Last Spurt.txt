When all the hopes are falling
When all dreams are forgotten
You stay alone given to yourself
And like in a finger-click
All the memories are springing up in my head again
The lungs are full of tobacco smoke
You don't feel emptiness inside
You close eyes you open eyes
But you change nothing
When all hopes fall
When you don't have a lot of forces
For a new step to the purposes
Which you were dreaming about all your life
Like in a finger-click
Springing up in a head
All new and new fears
The lungs are full of tobacco smoke
You don't feel emptiness inside.
You close eyes you open eyes
But you change nothing
Only you only you
Only one only one
When all the hopes are falling
When all dreams are forgotten
In spite of everything itâs necessary
To try to find forces inside yourself
To turn page and start from a blank leaf
To do a confident step
To continue the course of life
Sometimes I wanna hide myself in a closet
Don't show my weakness
