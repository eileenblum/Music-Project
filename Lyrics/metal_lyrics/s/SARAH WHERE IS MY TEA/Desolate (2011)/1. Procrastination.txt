First day. I see how can you get my soul.
Second day. You kill so slow.
Third day is torment. I`ll learn to appreciate.
Every day for me is a desolate.

Behind the wall
You see only the red bricks
What's on the other side?
You want to know it
But you're confined to the monotony
You're tired
Your body went numb without action
You have desires
Seems that you should go into the fire
You have dreams
But youâll never accomplish anything
You have no key of metal chain lock
And someone threw it into fucking dreams with best wishes
Forever
You need an alternative way
No need to be a genius for it
Your mind allows you to much
Impossible to tolerate
Unable to fight with drawback
Rise up your head and open eyes
Look at the new world
Time to realize what happens and what waits us?
Only god knows
High voltage in my arms
Drops of sweat on my forehead
Time to remove dust from the head
You have few seconds to escape from death
Well, what's your choice?
Right or left
Different roads with different ends
No more time to think
It's your chance
Don't lose it
Rise up your head and open eyes
You hope for tomorrow again and again
You're naive as a child believing miracles
