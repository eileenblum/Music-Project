And each of us are looking for...
My sea is burning
It's brave deed
My heart is bleeding
You had no reason. Why?
A dirty soul inside the finest body.
Your coast is burning
My hopes into the deep
I don't believe
I'm doing everything for you dreaming of your thanks
But a dirty cloud will stand over my head
Take a time to ponder
I'm falling on the ground
I see your mimicry
You'll fly downhill with me I'll pull you
Hear my prayer feel my feelings
Every your touch gives me faith in you
It's an illusion
We'll break this fucking stereotype and you'll finish to lie
Show me the rule that says that I must do everything
But without any payoff from you
Show me black letters
Pictures, instructions and a complete plan of my actions
We'll break this fucking stereotype and you'll finish to lie
Down with me
Come on be strong come on go on it`s time to end it
Love goes away remains of pain are closed inside myself forever
Tears of happiness cause i know how to love
You'll fly downhill with me
Love goes away
Down with me
