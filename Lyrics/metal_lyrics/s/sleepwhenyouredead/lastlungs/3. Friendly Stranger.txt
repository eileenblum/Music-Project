Whatâs your name, where are you from
Whatâs your story, letâs have some fun
Iâve never seen you before
But the musicâs loud and Iâm feeling good
I can see us getting along, I can see you calling me back
What would come of this situation
What would come of this, what would come of us
Youâve got the look, Youâve got my attention
Consuming me right to the core
What would come of this
What would come of this, what would come of us.
It would be so nice if you werenât like the rest of the world

My past is fading away
And my future starts today
If I had the choice
I would erase my memory
No recollection or recovery

Throw your morals aside
No need for extra baggage
Throw your morals aside
No need for extra baggage
Forget everything that you know
Forget everything that you know
Throw your morals aside
No need for extra baggage
Throw your morals aside
No need for extra baggage
It would be so nice if you werenât like the rest of the world
