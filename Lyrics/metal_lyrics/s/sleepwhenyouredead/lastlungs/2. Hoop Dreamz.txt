Your Diamonds mean nothing
Nothing to me
You flaunt your wealth like Iâm supposed to give a fuck
And your confidence comes with a price tag
Youâre just a slave to the name thatâs on your shirt

What would you be if your money left you
Would you still show your face
My rags are my riches
With nothing in my pocket I stand tall

I canât wait to watch you fall, after all
Karmaâs a bitch and packs a punch
Can you even handle
Reality anymore
Or are you lost in your own fucked up world
Donât flaunt what you got anymore
Iâm not interested
You sold out everyone you know
And youâre going to regret every second of it

What would you be if your money left you
Would you still show your face
My rags are my riches
With nothing in my pocket I stand tall

I canât wait to watch you fall
You sold your soul for fools gold
I canât wait to watch you fall
You sold your soul for fools gold
Iâll be there to kick you when youâre down
You sold your soul for fools gold
Iâll be there to kick you when youâre down
You sold your soul for fools gold
