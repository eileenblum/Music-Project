This must be the end of the world
A dead silence, all was quiet, a faint ringing in my head
To blink would deprive me of the worldâs beauty
For in these final moments I am free
In a flash everything was destroyed(destroyed)
Our existence disintegrated in to a memory
Everything we had ever known was taken from us
Everything we had ever known was taken from us
The sky has left us behind
The ground begins to crumble
The earth begins to shake
We panicked as we lost way
And then it all became reality
We fell to our knees
And at that moment
I understood we would never see
The world for what it was again
We would never see the world
For what it was again
We will never see this world

At that very moment(at that very moment)
The sun had set for the last time(for the last time)
It sunk in to the darkness(sink in to the darkness)
A final ray of light blessed my eyes
And touched my soul
It blessed my eyes
It blessed my eyes
