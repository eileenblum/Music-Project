The night is calling
Heading downtown to place my bets
Temptation on my shoulder
And it is saying
If you play your cards right
(Yea ill play them right)
lady luck will be mine tonight
(Mine tonight)
Those snake eyes staring me in the face
Roll the dice to see what I can take
Iâm getting dizzy
But I will spin that wheel again
Iâll let it ride
Let it ride tonight
Let it ride
Let it ride
And the sad truth is
My greed will always win
Itâs a burden my shoulders cant seem to bare
And the sad truth is
My greed will always win
Itâs a burden my shoulders cant seem to bare
Iâll let it ride
Iâll let it ride
Iâll let it ride tonight
And the said truth is
My greed will always win
The sad truth is
I will never win
I lost it all
Itâs all gone
I spent it all
Itâs all gone to shit
Itâs all gone
Itâs all gone
