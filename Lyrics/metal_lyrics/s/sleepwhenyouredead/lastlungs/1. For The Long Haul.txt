I have a feeling that Iâd be fine, if you paid your dues, cause Iâve paid mine
I sweated it out, Iâve made the effort, Iâve broken the bones, I passed the test
Give me something to live for, give me something more
They say thereâs a light at the end of the tunnel (They say thereâs a light)
Give me the recognition that I deserve
Give me the respect that I deserve
So many times Iâve been walked all over
So many times you have brought me down
Iâm going to stand on my feet again
I donât need your pity
I donât need your approval
Iâm going to be stronger than ever this time
I donât need your help

Iâve worked so hard for everything that I can call my own
Iâve worked so hard [Iâve worked so hard] for everything
You canât take this away from me
You canât take this away from me
