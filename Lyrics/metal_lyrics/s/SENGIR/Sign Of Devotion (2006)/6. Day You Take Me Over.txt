Will you ever find me?
As I lay within my shell
My thoughts are still floating
Away..
The day you take me over
You will set me free
Into infinity
The day you take me over [3x]
Now, I can feel you near me
As we are drifting of to see
My soul is still yearning
For you..
The day you take me over
You will set me free
Into infinity
Into infinity
The day you take me over
It's the day you take me over
Day you take me over
It's the day you take me over
Day you take me over
It's the day you take me over
Day you take me over
