Run faster,
I Cant lose it
Its everywhere I go
but its nowhere to be found
Don't look at me like
I'm a stranger by your side
I am a victim in these suffocating times
I keep holding on to what I got and my defense,
it is stronger than you know
I keep holding on and what I got is no regret,
there is a time for letting go
Now listen, I don't know what I'm after
running down an empty street and while I pray
I run faster to my dying day
I keep holding on to what I got and my defense,
it is stronger than you know
I keep holding on and what I got is no regret,
there is a time for letting go
I keep holding on
There is a time for letting go, there is a time for everyone to know
this world so free lies deep in me
