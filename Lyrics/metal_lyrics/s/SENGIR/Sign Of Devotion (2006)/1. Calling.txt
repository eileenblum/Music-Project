Is it everlasting, the love that we share in our hearts
In times of sorrow you better take my hand before this world gets older
These words are killing me and I can't give up the fight
Forsaken dreams
My love has been denied
I am dying, crying and calling out to you
Now don't you worry?
Days like these they will come and they will go
But I won't grow any stronger relying on your empty words
I need to feel you, I need to hear you
Like there is no tomorrow
There is no escape, when I fear for you I will die for you
There is no reward, when I fear for you I will die for you
These words are killing me and I can't give up the fight
Forsaken dreams
My time is running out
I am dying, crying and calling out to you
