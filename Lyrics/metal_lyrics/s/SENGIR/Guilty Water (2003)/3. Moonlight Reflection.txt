The nights went on and on
While my tears were falling down
But with the moon rising up above
Share with me her love
The nights went on and on
While my tears were falling down
But with the moon rising up above
Share with me her love
The nights went on and on
While my tears were falling down
But with the moon rising up above
Share with me her love
The nights went on and on
While my tears were falling down
But with the moon rising up above
Share with me her love
Share with me her love
The nights went on and on
While my tears were falling down
But with the moon rising up above
Share with me her love
The nights went on and on
While my tears were falling down
But with the moon rising up above
Share with me her love
