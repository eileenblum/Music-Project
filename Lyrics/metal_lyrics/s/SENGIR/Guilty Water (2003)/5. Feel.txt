I long to feel
the point of no return...
Never walked alone
I thought I'd always fly back home
But it takes no fear
To find a way to disappear
Though it would
Always be a part of me
So real
I never thought it would find a way to dissapear
So am I really running free?
from this feeling
I long to feel
The point of no return
I long to feel
The point of no return
One peaceful day
I'll let it all slip away
Though it would
Always be a part of me
So real
I never thought it would find a way to dissapear
So am I really running free?
from this feeling
