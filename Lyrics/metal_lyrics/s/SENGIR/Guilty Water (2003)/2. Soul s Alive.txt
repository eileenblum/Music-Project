Today
There is nothing more to fear
Fight the clouds so unreal
We won't fall down
We pray
That the engine in our minds
Drives us faster than the light
We won't fall down
We won't fall down
To the ground upon we are walking
And we'll survive
Keeping our souls alive
Now time is falling away from me
If you fall
there is nothing I can do
I can't slow down and wait for you
Anymore
And I recall
While you were dancing with my mind
I tried to keep my soul alive
We won't fall down
We won't fall down
To the ground upon we are walking
And we'll survive
Keeping our souls alive
Now time is falling away from me
We won't fall down
we won't fall down
To the ground upon we are walking
And we'll survive
Keeping our souls alive
Now time is falling away from me
