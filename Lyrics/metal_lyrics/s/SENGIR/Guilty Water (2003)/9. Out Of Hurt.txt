Never ment to cause you any pain
Sure I've done nothing wrong
But faster than the rain
You slipped away
And you know it's not the way
Leaving me astray
Leave me shattered by the morninglight
You and me are falling down tonight
'Cause you were shallowing my mind
Clouding up my starlit sky
You and me are falling down tonight
I feel there lies something more ahead
So leave your pretty words unsaid
It only could go wrong
The way you make me feel
You make my world closing in
And I fear...
All my life lights were shining bright
But you killed them all
So I guess I don't need you anymore
You and me are falling down tonight
'Cause you were shallowing my mind
Clouding up my starlit sky
You and me are falling down tonight
One last candle burning bright
She rest her hear
And died...
She died...
Died...
Died...
But now I'm out of hurt
Standing out of time
I'll never trust your mind
Never again
