I wonder how we ever made it through
I think we were losing
Track of time
By reaching each other's mind
But what I found
Is the old world tumbling
Down
In this time of change
This time, our lives won't be arranged
We won't come down
From these dizzy heights we are on today
No we won't delay
Will you ever know
How many tears I've cried?
I burried hurt deep inside of me
And you will
Never find
What you are looking for
'Cause spirits move me
And they are coming back no more
