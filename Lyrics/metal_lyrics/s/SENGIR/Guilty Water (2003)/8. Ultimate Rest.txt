Sometimes
Stars would disappear
Leave my
Thoughts concealed
Your dreams
Never took much care of me
I cried
For the light you tried to hide
All I ever wanted
Was some time to breath
We would be holding on together
'Till the rain set in
Holding on forever
'Till the light comes in
All I ever wanted
Was some time to breath
We would be holding on together
'Till the rain set in
Holding on forever
'Till the light comes in
Behind the door
There was no way out
I ran for cover and I stumbled until I found
Faith was never far away
And She turned to me
Like a flower to the sun
So stay forever... and ever
All I ever wanted
Was some time to breath
We would be holding on together
'Till the rain set in
Holding on forever
'Till the light comes in
