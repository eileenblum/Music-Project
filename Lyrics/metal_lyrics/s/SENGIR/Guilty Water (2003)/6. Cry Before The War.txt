Don't ask me if it's right or wrong
You've lost your way forever
No matter where you belong
Because you're falling into this beautiful oblivion
You thought you could have it all
Even in you darkest hour ever
Your soul is beyond recall
Your angels are dying and pain will never feel the same
But now it's time (now it's time) to let you go (to let you know)
I think it's time (I think it's time) to let you know (to let you know)
I will surely haunt (I will surely haunt you) you down (down)
But it's too late tonight
Don't ask me if it's right or wrong
You've lost your way forever
No matter where you belong
Because you're falling into this beautiful oblivion
This time I make you love me
This time I really care
This time I make you love me
This time I really care
This time I make you love me
This time I really care
This time I make you love me
This time I really care
Don't ask me if it's right or wrong
You've lost your way forever
No matter where you belong
Because you're falling into this beautiful oblivion
You
Now you're falling
you're so beautiful, when you are falling down...
Falling down...
