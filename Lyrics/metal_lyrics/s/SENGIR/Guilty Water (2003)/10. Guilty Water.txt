No cooling down
I will be restless
'Till the end of time
'Cause I yearn to fly
In the deepest blue of the moonlit sky
The water between us is getting icy cold
But the only thing that I want is a warm surrounding
The water between us is getting freakin' cold
And it's rushing through my veins at night
And it can't be denied
It can't be denied...
Such a waste of time
To draw all those boundaries in my mind
And you would not have a clue
That the more you try, the more I run from you
The water between us is getting icy cold
But the only thing that I want is a warm surrounding
The water between us is getting freakin' cold
And it's rushing through my veins at night
And it can't be denied
It can't be denied...
This guilty water
This guilty water
This guilty water
This guilty water
This guilty water
This guilty water
This guilty water
The water between us is getting icy cold
But the only thing that I want is a warm surrounding
The water between us is getting freakin' cold
And it's rushing through my veins at night
And it can't be denied
It can't be denied...
