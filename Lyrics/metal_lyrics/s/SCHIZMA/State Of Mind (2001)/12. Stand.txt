Goin', keep it goin'
Got no time to waste
Over your bullshit ways
Get the fuck out of my face

Never been a part of this system
Dragin' me in when I wanna stay away
Why can't you just leave me alone?

Drag me in ï¿½ wanna get out
Bring me down ï¿½ gonna fight back
Knock me out ï¿½ wanna get up
Crush my bones ï¿½ still I will rise

I'm gonna still stand my ground
If you don't kill me you'll just make me stronger again
