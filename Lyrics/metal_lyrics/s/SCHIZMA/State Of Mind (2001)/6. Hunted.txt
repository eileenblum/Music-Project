What does it take to make right choices?
Before everything breaks down to scare your dreams away

Face to face with everyday, face to face with reality
Leaves nothing but frustration
So you begin to wonder why
You should constantly try

Cause no matter what you do
Just don't seem to be breaking through   .
The same shit just another day
How the fuck I'll make my way?

What's the future to come I wonder why
I should care about righteous ways
It ain't take a genius to see
Crime pays gotta face the facts

What do you expect me to say?
When every time I try I fail
What's left from how I was raised?
Will I have to reevaluate?

Sell my soul reality
Become a human animal and set it free
Hunted like a beast paying for misdeeds
When it's too late to look back

Don't let them scare your dreams away
