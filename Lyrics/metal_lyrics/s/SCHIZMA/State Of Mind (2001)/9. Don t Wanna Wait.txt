Don't want to wait anymore...

Let me be your enemy
Don't wanna wait at the door of your acceptance

My world myself create
No need for yours to wait
Reached my hand and got bitten
Though I tried so hard
All my hope in vain
Now you gotta pay

Let me be your enemy
Don't wanna wait at the door of your acceptance

Don't want to wait anymore...

Never again will I reach out
Your disrespect fucks with my pride
Come back for more - gonna get shit
You're out of game
Don't try to judge
You don't know shit
