I still maintain my stand in this h.c. game
Against all odds I keep living my life this way

Disappointed with who I thought would never change
Gotta stick to the spirit, that's still the same
To do what I gotta do, I've never failed
'Cause I, I still maintain

Set my goals straight
Hope I won't give up
Down but not out
Keepin' my head up

Times are changing, kids get bored fast
But I'm too old used to my ways
Remember the good old days, how could I change?
To do what I gotta do, I've never failed
'Cause I still maintain

Set my goals straight
Hope I won't give up
Down but not out
Keepin' my head up

I still maintain my stand in this h.c. game
Against all odds I keep living my life this way
