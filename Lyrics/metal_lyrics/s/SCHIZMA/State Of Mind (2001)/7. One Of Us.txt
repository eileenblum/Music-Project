I watch you rise, never seen you fall
Through all these years made difference to me
Made me believe, made me doubt
What's in our ways wrong n' right

That's what friendship's all about
Now you're far but will never be out

You'll be forever one of us
Jednym z nas

I watch you rise, never seen you fall
Like a younger brother who came to overthrow
Whatever it meant breakin' the walls
Do what we mean through thick and thin

Always on point to rock the joint
Never failed to prove you're not fake
Never give a fuck 'bout what they say
Did your thing now forced to break

You'll be forever one of us
Jednym z nas
