I still can believe it happened this way
Like a slab in the back
Should've known better, now it's too late

You and your friends you never cared
Why does it always have to end the same fuckin' way?

All of these lies - why waste your time?
Liar!
Sold your soul, all of this shit, still can't believe
Liar!
Where's your pride?

I've had enough of your little war
Stop all the lies, do your own thing
Deal with your life

Spreading your bullshit wherever you are
We're back from the dead - forever hardcore
Don't waste your time

All of these lies - why waste your time?
Liar!
Sold your soul, all of this shit, still can't believe
Liar!
Where's your pride?
