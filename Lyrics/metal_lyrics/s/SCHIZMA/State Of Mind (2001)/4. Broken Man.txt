All my life all I wanted was for you to understand
All my life all I needed somehow to take a stand
I don't care, don't care, don't care what you do or say
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live my life my own way

I will never be a broken man
Live my life just the way I want to
I will never be a broken man
Show my pride the only way I can

All my life I keep trying you fail to recognize
All your life you kept trying, now it's my time to shine
I don't care, don't care, don't care what you do or say
I'll never live, never live my life your way

I will never be a broken man
Live my life just the way I want to
I will never be a broken man
Show my pride the only way I can

I want to live my life my way
I will always hold my own
I will take every step my way
I will never make your mistakes

I know it was hard
Struggling through your youth
Given me everything you thought you could
But now it's my time to shine
