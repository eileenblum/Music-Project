What da fuck? Another year goes by
Nothing is changing
Despite all the suffering
It's always the same

The powers that be content with themselves
All of our dreams
All of our hopes
Broken by pain

You better think twice
I'm in the hardcore stale of mind
You better think twice
Cause it's the hardcore state of mind

Walking round this town
Nothing to do all day
Nothing is left, nobody cares
Someone's gonna pay

You better think twice
We're in the hardcore state of mind...

Oni nie moga juz tego dluzej robic...
Schizma
Hardcore state of fuckin' mind
