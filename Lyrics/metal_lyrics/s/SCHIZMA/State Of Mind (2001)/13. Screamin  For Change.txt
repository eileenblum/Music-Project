What's happened to us?
Can we no longer see
Something's dying out
Between you and me

It used to be so simple
Used to be so clear
But you're givin' up
Destroying our dreams

I'm screaming for a change
I'm still screaming for a change

We're not walkin' a one way street
Heart and soul the only key
Step aside still can be real
Individuality

I'm screaming for a change
I'm still screaming for a change
