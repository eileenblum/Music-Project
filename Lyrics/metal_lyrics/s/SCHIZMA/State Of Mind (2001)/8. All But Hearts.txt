So you think you figured what is all about
So you hope you can make some money on that
So you claim everybody can sell out
So you pray all the rest will think that way

Never gonna take it away from me
'Cause you don't comprehend what's for us plain to see
Bunch of clowns seeking popularity
But for us is respect is sincerity

Shit your pants for a record deal
Make all the kids think you do it for real
Satisfied with mass appeal
Their hearts you'll never win

Never gonna take it away from us
Cause we're kept together by friendship and trust
You will never win

Satisfied with mass appeal
Their hearts you'll never win

You'll win all but hearts
