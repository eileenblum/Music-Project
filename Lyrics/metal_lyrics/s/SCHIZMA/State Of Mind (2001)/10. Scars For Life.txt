Prove your brotherhood, teach me something
Show that you really care
Learn ï¿½n elevate, your style demonstrate
Represent with what you do and you say

Want you to make me think
Want you to prove me wrong
Don't follow with blind faith
Say something new at last

Too many of you just come and go
With nothing to say and nothing to prove, no
Too many of you just come and go
Leaving scars for life

Far too many times I fell victim
To my own expectations
I dared, I challenged your priorities
Proving nothing but wrong

For those who failed to feed my loyalty need
I feel sorry but I no longer worry...

Is it me to blame for my quest for ideals?
Is it you to blame for your ignorance?
Is it me to blame for my inflexible stand?
Is it you to blame for your lack of integrity?
