I feel the anger bleeding inside of me
I see your weakness growing more and more
The reason for your conviction means nothing to me
My feed and my breath are called war

We share your insanity
We support your inner demons

Run
Before the world explodes
Kill
While your time stands still
I will take your soul, I will steal your pride
I will throw you back to hell
Back to hell feel my rage
Right now
This is the art of wrath

Can you see the fire burning within?
The greater inspiration always will win
I can hear the ancient warrior singing
It's time for the primal instinct

Run
Before the world explodes
Kill
While your time stands still
I will take your soul, I will steal your pride
I will throw you back to hell
Back to hell feel my rage
Right now
This is the art of wrath

We share your insanity
Run
We support your inner demons
Kill
We share your insanity
Run
We support

This is the art of wrath

Run
Before the world explodes
Kill
While your time stands still
I will take your soul, I will steal your pride
I will throw you back to hell
Back to hell feel my rage
Right now
This is the art of wrath
