Say farewell to your vital signs
Faithless portion of a wothless life
Imagine fire running through your veins
Now go insane, stay insane

All the stitches, all the scars
Consequence of constant lies
Existence gets so out of reach
As the future ceases to exist

Caught fear itself combining forces
With reality, the worst part of it
At last you've seen it is not a game
Now let the fire spread away

Self-destructed, self-corrupted
Only fragments of inner strength
Self-disgusted, self-ablaze
Let hope incinerate

Just let it burnThere's no way. 
There's no one left to save.No return. 
There's no way.
Let's hope incinerate

A sudden turn to your faceless self
Getting an urge to fail
Does it really matter anyway
To die tomorrow if you're dead today

Self-destructed, self-corrupted
Only fragments of inner strength
Self-disgusted, self-ablazeLet hope incinerate

Just let it burn
There's no way. There's no one left to save.
No return. There's no way.
Let's hope incinerate
