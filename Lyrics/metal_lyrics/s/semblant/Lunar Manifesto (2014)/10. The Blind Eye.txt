Look the other way
Pretend there's nothing there
The universe revolves around you
Your choice to be unfair

Turn your face away
It's hard to look ahead
The future doesn't look so bright
Desperation and despair

Destroy the selfishness
There's no where left to hide
The universe revolves around you
On the verge to collide

Revenge's about to come
Revenge's about to come

Escape before it hits your head
Before it hits the blind eye
The blind eye ending

Catch the bullet while you can
Before it hits the blind eye
The blind eye ending

Revenge's about to come
Revenge's about to come

Escape before it hits your head
Before it hits the blind eye
The blind eye ending

Catch the bullet while you can
Before it hits the blind eye
The blind eye ending
