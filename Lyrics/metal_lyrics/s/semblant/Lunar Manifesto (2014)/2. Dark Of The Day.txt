Close this chapter and watch it burn
End of innocence, blood and lust
Face the days of endless dusk
Darkness comes as you turn to dust

For those of you who plead for mercy
Contemplate your brand new saviour
For those of you who live in misery
Look to the sky and embrace your inner fear

Fear... The sense of isolation
The reason of it all
The weakest generation
The dark of the day
The lies an the illusions
The end of what we know
The fading generation
The dark of the day

Close this chapter and watch it burn
Open your eyes as a new born
Face the light of thousand suns
Brighter days are yet to come

Dead sun rising
Dead sun shines no more
Dead sun standing
Above as silence grows
