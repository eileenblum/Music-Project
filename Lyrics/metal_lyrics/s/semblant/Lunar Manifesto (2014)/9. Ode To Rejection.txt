Despise the condemned
See a face and mark it as inferior
Constantly asking for attention

Wearing an invisible crown

Ignore the diseased
Vermins of society
Rejected as the whole world
Buried beneath the ground

This is the day of rejection
The is the pain we're going through
This is the end of life as we know
This is the end of all the scars
This is the only chance to face the bright tyrant eyes

Remove ignorance
Accept what cannot be changed
Those who are forgotten
Those who won't remain

If you say who's the one to blame
Point the finger to yourself
We are rejected

This is the day of rejection
This is the pain we're going through

If you say who's the one to blame
Point the finger to yourself
We are rejected
