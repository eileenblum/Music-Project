There's a magic atmosphere
Beyond these gates of oblivion
Dive into the unknown
And face the limits of reality

Religion is a name to domain
Every soul's poverty
Some doctrines can prove you
That the unreal deserves your true faith

Imagine and follow
All mysteries behind the shades
Begin your quest
Through the darkest of the ways

Believe, became
A master upon all types of messiah's names
No fear embrace
All mysteries above the human race
We could learn to see beyond the void
(And so many lies)
We could find a flame inside the black
(Behold the truth)
Flesh holds a power through pleasure
Pain and suffering
Hides their treasures

I wish I can read behind the lines
Unholy wisdom sanctified
I am the fallen into this abyss of fire
This is my inner shrine
I saw when reason and lies collide
I hear the call of the ancient times
Dark is the source of light
Something wicked lives in the shrine

(This is my inner shrine)
Seeds of sorrow rites of blood
A soul departure has its thorn
Scars of a forgotten knowledge
Bleeding again until men dies

Imagine and follow
All mysteries behind the shades
Begin your quest
Through the darkest of the ways
Flesh holds a power through pleasure
Pain and suffering
Hides their treasures
I wish I can read behind the lines
Unholy wisdom sanctified
I am the fallen into this abyss of fire
This is my inner shrine
I saw when reason and lies collide
I hear the call of the ancient times
Dark is the source of light
Something wicked lives in the shrine

We could learn to see beyond the void
We could find a flame inside the black
There's no return for disbelief
(When you'll see the light)
Embrace a plan above all secrecy
(New revelation)

I wish I can read behind the lines
Unholy wisdom sanctified
I am the fallen into this abyss of fire
This is my inner shrine
I saw when reason and lies collide
I hear the call of the ancient times
Dark is the source of light
Something wicked lives in the shrine
