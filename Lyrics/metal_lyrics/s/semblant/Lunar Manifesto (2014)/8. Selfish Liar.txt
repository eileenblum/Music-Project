Lie who are you trying to fool?
The world is not dying for you
Your selfish soul makes you blind

And now you're dead behind society's eyes
Molded by the one who you chose
To make your life an entire hell

So much promises to be swear
So much poison to be shed

What's the difference between you and I?
Shattered dreams of a whole new life

Try to reach your lost dignity
And don't fool me with your falsity
Decide what do you expect from yourself
To turn your life an entire hell?

So much promises to be swear
So much poison to be shed

I saw the slander inside the lies you spoke
Your words are cursed hollow
Reptile tongue
I hear the Devil speaking through your throat
You're a selfish liar,
Fire burning down your lies

Living in this path of sadness
Living in this guilty's land
Living in a life made of shame
Here's a world made of blame

So much promises to be swear
So much poison to be shed
So much blood running dry
How much cost your words tonight?

I saw the slander inside the lies you spoke
Your words are cursed hollow
Reptile tongue
I hear the Devil speaking through your throat
You're a selfish liar,
Fire burning down your lies
What's the difference between you and I?
Shattered dreams of a whole new life
