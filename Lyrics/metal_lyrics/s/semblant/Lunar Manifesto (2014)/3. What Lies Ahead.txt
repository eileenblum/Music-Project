New reality - viral obscenity
Bloodstained Walkers all around
Insecurity - Death of humanity
Contaminating the air with rotten flesh
Violence becomes the way
Terminate - Elimanate
Fear everything inside
Eliminate - Disintegrate

Empty are the eyes of everyone 
who's dead inside
Guilty as you slay the agonizing ones - demonized
Open are the wounds inside us all
Fragile as the loved ones start to fall
Empty are the eyes of everyone whos dead inside
Forget all your regrets
Survival is the only chance to keep their memories alive
No one knows what lies Ahead
So keep on walking until the end, until your certain death.
