Moonlight please show us the way
In darkness we dwell, the lords of the deep we obey
Immaculated and hallowed be our cardinal sins

Black veils of the night will swallow the sun
The spell of the present time can never be undone
Defying the rules of the holy, above the limits of death
Eternal unbroken disease, our curse, our path

In darkness we dwell, Creation's sacrilege
Fake life, true hell, Scarlet Heritage

Blood is our fountain of faith
In darkness we dwell, shadows with tales to tell
We sail with Charon until the shores of Acheron

It's time to prove our might in the lands of no sun
Navigate through darker tides until the end is done
Decoding the sign of the omen about the future of men
Immortal unspoken disease, your blood, our feed

We are the ones who bring back the plague
Serpent's surrounding the mankind's grave

Moonlight please show us the way
In darkness we dwell, the Lords of the Deep we obey
The answering abyss to our impious utterance

Another time, another age
We all praise the Scarlet Heritage
Another life, another way
We all praise the Scarlet Heritage
Another sun, another moon
We all praise the Scarlet Heritage
