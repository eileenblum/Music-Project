Embrace in the unknown, passion for our blasphemy.
Horging every sense of what remains untold.

The dawn of every day, glorious path of eternity.
Illusions fade in slowly as the end [?]

Engrave your name on me

One heart, unbroken, until the moonlight disappears.
So dark, so lonely, the one who bites the hand that bleeds. The one who bites the hand the bleeds.

Sake the one that gave, [?] fuel the blank inside with [?]

Decay is raining, [?] path of reality, through the ashes we will rise above.

Engrave your name on me

One heart, unbroken, until the moonlight disappears.
So dark, so lonely, the one who bites the hand that bleeds. The one who bites the hand the bleeds.

One heart, unbroken, until the moonlight disappears.
So dark, so lonely, the one who bites the hand that bleeds. The one who bites the hand the bleeds.
