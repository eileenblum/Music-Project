When you face the dark
All the things you hear
Are silent on a conspiration growing inside
How many lies will fall
How many masks you keep
Thereâs no living arrogance in a place so deep

Itâs time to die
Itâs the end of your life
A hollow life growing from inside
A blinded vermin
A soul parasite
Your nest belongs far from Earth delights

When the truth comes out
All the shame will bleed
This plague starts poisoning through the veins
How many lives must pay
How many souls you take
Thereâs no answer for your prayers and screams

Itâs time to die
Itâs the end of your life
A hollow life growing from inside
A blinded vermin
A soul parasite
Your nest belongs far from Earth delights

Something dark is coming
Iâm paralysed
The seed of evil is growing deep inside
Thereâs no other escape to run away from shame
For those who hide the skin behind the mask

Let there be blood
When ignorance remains
Let there be blood
Violate me

Something dark is coming
Iâm paralysed
The seed of evil is growing deep inside
Thereâs no other escape to run away from shame
For those who hide the skin behind the mask

Itâs time to die
Itâs the end of your life...
