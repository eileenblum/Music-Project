I'm here to bring you the winter
The blackest clouds are covering the surface again
All dreams of freedom are over
All doors of wisdom are opened

I build an empire of glass
The will to live belongs to me again

I say you I'm back, you tell me I'm dead
I told you I'm here, you scream and can't understand

There's no life to hold my breath

World's a shade of what I am
It's time to rise and dream again
Walking the Earth as the undead

Darkest waves of mankind
All disgrace that makes you blind
Sleepers of eternity
It's a dead society
