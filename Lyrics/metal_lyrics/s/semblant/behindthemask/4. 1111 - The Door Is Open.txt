Some people are doorways
A passage to the other side
A gate to the outworld
A sign to end of times

The universe
Brings illumination
For the chosen ones
A new age dawns

Come see what lies beyond
Heed the call and cross the gate
Decode
All the tales they told
Behold the truth
Eleven and... eleven

All mirrors are gateways
Bridges between dimensions
Forbidden suites about the apocalypse
Be silent about things we shouldn't speak

Welcome to the age of recreation
The call of the unknown is blowing from beyond
All religion, faith, creed has gone on a deep dark truth
