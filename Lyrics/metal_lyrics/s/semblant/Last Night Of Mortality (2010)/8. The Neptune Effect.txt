Cruel changes-in all aspects of this mortal life
For every part i see disease, fading lives and broken hearts

Shadows beneath Aquarius
Painful indeed in all clarity
Dead stars are falling
Maybe a myth or reality

Our empty lives becoming dark
The world is haunted and negative
Our empty lives becoming dark
The Neptune effect over the earth

Agonyâthe key to open the age that comes
Whispering voices from beyond
Tell me reasons to left this world

The trident possess my deepest side
I think about suicide
All this must be an illusion
A short nightmare doing confusion

Our empty lives becoming dark
The world is haunted and negative
Our empty lives becoming dark
The Neptune effect over the earth

The Neptune effect over the earth
