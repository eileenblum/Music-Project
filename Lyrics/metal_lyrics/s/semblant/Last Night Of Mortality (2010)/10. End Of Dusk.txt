I cannot have you for much time
I lost my way to paradise
The night can make my dreams come true
I was born in sacrifice
I was born in your desire
And you know all of my sins

Take my hand and fly with me
I'll give you my spell for guarantee
It's a just little kiss and you die
The time and years have gone away
The tears are dust on your face
You are slave from my desire

I can't have you
I can't leave you
I can't feel you
Blood is on my mind
I can't touch you
But I need you
We're souls in a double sacrifice

I still remember what we've done
Can you face the creature you'd become?
We can't remember our lives before it
The passion is born in sunless days
The tears are dust on your face
You are slave from my desire

I can't have you
I can't leave you
I can't feel you
Blood is on my mind
I can't touch you
But I need you
We're souls in a double sacrifice

Creatures between two worlds
Living on the edge by the will of blood
A killer instinct arises
For the need of pain, blessed in disguise

The passion is born in sunless days
The tears are dust on your face
You are slave from my desire

I can't have you
I can't leave you
I can't feel you
Blood is on my mind
I can't touch you
But I need you
We're souls in a double sacrifice
Creatures between two worlds
Living on the edge by the will of blood
A killer instinct arises
For the need of pain, blessed in disguise
