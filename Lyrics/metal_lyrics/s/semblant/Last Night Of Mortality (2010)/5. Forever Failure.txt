The first of angels fall
The end of beginning, the seed of it all
First sign of hope and light
First stars fade and die

Passion burns with greed
Hellish memories or reason to bleed
Two worlds collideâ
There's no hope when the sun never shines

The pure essence reborn

Forever failure from the sky
Don't wash away, don't wash away, don't wash away the poison
Forever far away from light
I'll bleed today, a hell to payâa new sin I've committed

Seven churches, seven keys to hell, seven ways to find them
Ignorance, deliverance, I gave you my reverence

Passion burns with greed
Hellish memories or reason to bleed
Two worlds collideâ
There's no hope when the sun never shines

The pure essence reborn

Forever failure from the sky
Don't wash away, don't wash away, don't wash away the poison
Forever far away from light
I'll bleed today, a hell to payâa new sin I've committed
