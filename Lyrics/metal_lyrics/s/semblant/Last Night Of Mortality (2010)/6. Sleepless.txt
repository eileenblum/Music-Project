Why don't you try for a second time?
Why don't you swim against the tide?
Can you forget all the past behind you?
A burning soul who lost its mind

Nothing else remains the same
Someone else turns you insane
Stained blood inside my veins-
The clock stops before my eyes awake

Let me dream with blood, let me dream with your eyes
I'm never close to die
Let me dream with blood, let me dream with her lies
I'm never close to die

Who are you calling my name outside?
Who are the ones walking through the night?
A ghost appears and the mirror lies
The rain starts sweet but your tears run dry

No solution, just suicide
Hollow dreams and sorrow's emptiness
There's no angel by my side
Just a deadly will to find the end

Let me dream with blood, let me dream with your eyes
I'm never close to die
Let me dream with blood, let me dream with her lies
I'm never close to die
