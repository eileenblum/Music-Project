A cursed nation under serpent's embrace
The truth is coming
The birth of damnation and gods made of stone
The scarlet whore

Time is ending tonight, all people will cry
Salvation's a lie
Time is ending tonight, all people will cry
Salvation's a lie

A fallen creation through another side
The bringer of light
The blackest of nights arise over mankind

Nocte Aeternus Libera Me Ex Inferis
Nocte Aeternus Libera Me Ex Inferis

In the shades of a confidence
hides a hollow heart
There's a sinner inside the saints
with a burning dark
We are the last temptation
We are the false devotion
The Earth has turning cold
We build our Black Babylon

A never ending winter's domain
Our iced landscape
The path we have chosen there's no return
Our souls will burn

Nocte Aeternus Libera Me Ex Inferis
Nocte Aeternus Libera Me Ex Inferis

In the shades of a confidence
hides a hollow heart
There's a sinner inside the saints
with a burning dark
We are the last temptation
We are the false devotion
The Earth has turning cold
We build our Black Babylon
