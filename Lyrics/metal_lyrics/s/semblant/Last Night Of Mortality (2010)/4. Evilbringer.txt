I'm a prisoner fading
On this cage of remembrances
The air I breath exists no more
Inside this black water
No one can see my shadow
My ruin was a blinded sense of passion
I'm avenging now
My soul claims
For a violent regression

I feel when the water's freezing my soul
And the shade inside is covering me all
Something is calling deep in the abyss
A race causing the self-indulgence synthesis
Going under and being their own enemies
Always march on the blackest side of life

I am your karma
I am the moment when your death comes
I'm the last of the autumn seasons
I'm the result of your bloody treason

Look at me
I'm the worst thing that I can be
There's no way to save our lives
We brought all evil to a place of light

I feel when the water's freezing my soul
And the shade inside is covering me all
Something is calling deep in the abyss

Look at me
I'm the worst thing that I can be
There's no way to save our lives
We brought all evil to a place of light
