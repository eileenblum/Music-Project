No exorcism can save you from your inner demons
The weakness of your sad feelings just causes your decay

Let us take you to another world
Beyond the mirror
Can you save me from the innocence
Of divinity?

Believe my wordsâit's a haunted imagination
Welcome to the nightmare worldâone thousand tales of creation

Beauty always comes behind a mask
Like a wolf in sheepskin
From some places there's no turning back
I'm in a harvest of sins

Lies. Torment. Pain

There is a labyrinth closed for me to overcome my fears
I follow the way where daylight dies and nightmare
Visions rise

Believe my wordsâit's a haunted imagination
Welcome to the nightmare worldâone thousand tales of creation

There is a labyrinth closed for me to overcome my fears
I follow the way where daylight dies and nightmare
Visions rise
