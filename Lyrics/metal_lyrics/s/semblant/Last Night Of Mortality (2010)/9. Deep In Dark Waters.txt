Ghostly eyes can unravel it all
no more secrets, no more scars
a gloomy night brings the death's embrace
demonized by an angel's face
the resurrection of knowledge
through the eyes of the dead
I am the witness of your suffering
a mortal life's just a game
ashes to ashes, pain to pain
immortality's not a game
behind, beyond
walking between the worlds
try to justify
after crucify
the evil in your eyes
makes my heart deny
the ghost of your mistakes
keep my eyes awake
I feel my senses numb
dark waters rain for you
your face's clean
but so deep inside
I know you're hiding something dark
I'm the witness of your suffering
a mortal life's just a game
the resurrection of knowledge
through the eyes of the dead
ashes to ashes, pain to pain
immortality's not a game
try to justify
after crucify
the evil in your eyes
makes my heart deny
the ghost of your mistakes
keep my eyes awake
I feel my senses numb
dark waters rain for you
