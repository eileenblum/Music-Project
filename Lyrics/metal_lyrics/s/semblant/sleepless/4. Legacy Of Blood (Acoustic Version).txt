A virus is burning my veins
My tears are drained with the time
Along the years
I lost all my innocence
I saw everything dies
In just one little kiss

This spell stays on my neck
This spell will never turn back
I killed the time
Can you show me that I'm not alone?
But the years keep going away
and then you die

I'm learning to fly
I need your blood tonight

I pay the price
I cannot die
I cannot see the light of the sun
One little kiss - immortality
I cannot change all the thing that I've done

There's a thirst inside of me
There's an evil inside of me
I don't want be here
I can't escape of all that I need
There's a shadow inside of me
screaming possessed by fear

I'm learning to fly
I need your blood tonight

I pay the price
I cannot die
I cannot see the light of the sun
One little kiss - immortality
I cannot change all the thing that I've done

Shine - and makes me free
Burn - I want my

soulâ¦
PAINâ¦ I lost my heart
I'm a deadman facing the sun
