You say you'll love me forever
You got my heart in your hands every day
You say "you've got to get it together
And make me part of your plans, take me away"

You say that you'll love me forever
But then you call it a day
You take my heart away
You're a woman of the world
You're a cold hearted girl
Dime-a-dozen, imitation, mother-of-pearl
Cold hearted girl

You say you've got no other
You tell me I'm your man every day
But you're a two-timin' lover
And now I gotta make plans, I gotta get away
