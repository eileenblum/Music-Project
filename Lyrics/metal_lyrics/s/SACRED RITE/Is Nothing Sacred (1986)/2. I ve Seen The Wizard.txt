I have seen the Wizard, and he's told me of his plan
He wanders through the darkness, gathering the damned
He strips you of your soul and then he throws you in the fire
When he finds you, he will force you to make love with all the liars

I have seen the Wizard, I have seen the Man
I have seen his magic, catch them, if you can

I have seen the magic of his mountain in the sky
Lords and demons disappear there, right before your eyes
Lies are true, and truth? It lies! You wonder, what is true?
Confusion shreds your soul, now look what has become of you

I've seen the Man, he sits there, high above the clouds
He's crying for the loss of all his children in the crowd
He's praying for your soul, he'll love you 'till the end of time
Praising you, your glories - forgiving you, your crimes
Yes, He's an old Man
His hands are filled with time
Time and time
Time and time, we'll see the end

I have seen the fires of hell, I have seen the dead
I have seen the Wizard deny everything he's said
I have seen the gates of Zion, I have seen the Man
I have seen His people die, they never understand
