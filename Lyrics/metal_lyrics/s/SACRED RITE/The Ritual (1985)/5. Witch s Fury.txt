The King! We found him dead last night, no heir to win his throne
The Queen is still a virgin, she's lying there alone
The King is dead; long live the King, but who will be the one?
The monarch will be chosen between the parted sons

And daughters of the evil witch, who lies beyond the sun
She's watching you, she's watching, can you see the damage done?
Brothers take the battlefield and turn to face the foe
Bad men scream their battle cry where good men never go

The knight in black, the knight in white, will never see the day
The dead men on the battlefield can't hear the voices say
The wicked minds that lie before you can't show you the way
The evil witch is fading, melting, cast her soul away!
