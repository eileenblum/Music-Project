Far beyond the edge of sight, in a deep and distant land
Lies the dark and misty road that takes the shadow of a man
He stumbles on a band of savage sinners, pagan fools!
Worshipping the carcasses and carrion left by you

Have you seen their eyes?
Have you heard their cry?
Have you seen the pain
That brings them down again?

With pig's blood and with poison, they prepare the evil Rite
With dignity, they march their sacrifice into the night
A maid, no more than twelve years old, will soon be with the Man
Free the virgin chained to stone, and you will win her hand

Born within the young, and then it spread throughout the old
A demon wrecked their bodies, stole their minds, possessed their souls
Writhing, bleeding madman, spitting screaming, bloody fright!
One by one they fell and disappeared into the night
