Iron clouds of thunder, roaring 'cross the sky
Speeding to the war-scene, many about to die
Radiation warheads ready to destroy
Like fire-breathing dragons, making all life void

This is the ending of the earth!
Revelation is at birth!
Man has fallen into black!
They warned us about this death attack!

Approaching from the darkness, to mankinds surprise
Missiles launched in fury, claiming all our lives
Fire and death surrounds us, falling from the sky
There is no use in hiding, we are doomed to die
