Come and delight at the show tonight, see the beautiful and the bizarre
The King and all of his men will be there to witness the death of the star
Jesters and jugglers and horses and riders parade through the field of Hell
Magicians and sorcerors chant and incant and will captivate you with their spell

As the shouting goes down, you can hear the faint sound of the ringleader giving his cry
'Bring out the sacrifice, place it up high on the altar of the sky'
The audience roars as they bring in the whores and the animals smile with joy
Open their cages, there's nothing to fear, they have only our souls to destroy

See the show
Second row
See the show
It's Rock-n-Roll

Witches and demons will gather together to sing you their own special song
The evils of all the world will be there, so won't you all come, sing along
They'll charm you and tempt you and ravish you, and give you anything that you desire
They're plotting to capture the world by the balls, and cast your soul into the fire

As the curtain goes down and the beggar is crowned, and the fireworks blast through the sky
And the spirits of lovers and ladies and lords celebrate as the virgins cry
And all the King's horses and all the Kings men travel home to their castles of sand
And the circus of Hell packs it's bags and moves on to enchant and entrance other lands
