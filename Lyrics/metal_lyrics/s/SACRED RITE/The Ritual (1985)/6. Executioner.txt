My head's to the stone / The executioner's coming
My sins stand alone / Soon my blood will be running
Save my soul / From the path that awaits me
His blade will crack the stone / And darkness will wake me

Fight the dead / Or tomorrow they'll take you
Away to the hills / Where they laugh as they break you
Live in sin / And play with the damned
You'll fight with the beast, and eat at the feast, before you become a man

Shed the tears / Of the Angels who want you
Taste the fears / Of the devils who haunt you
Rape the dead / Make love to the living
They'll take all you have / Until you stop giving

Many times, the sound of the dead
Has rung through the hills, still rings through my head
Dry your eyes of the tears you're creating
Say goodbye, the hangman is waiting

Feel the end, ice to the bone
His task is done, the hangman goes home
