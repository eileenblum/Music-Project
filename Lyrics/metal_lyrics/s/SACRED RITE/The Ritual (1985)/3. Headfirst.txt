The night has come, we're heading for the door
The rush is big, gets down to the core
Headfirst tonight is all that's on my mind
I need it now, don't waste no time

One thing's for sure
There ain't no cure
One thing I know
I can't wait for the start of the show

Goin'
Headfirst into lovin'
That's when push comes to shovin'
Headfirst into lovin'
Headfirst into...

You got the fire to make the night go on
I've got desire to have some fun
You're lookin' hot (yeah!) We need some time alone
I call the shots, sucked dry to the bone

C'mon, baby, give me your love
And I'll take you higher
Don't mess with me, I need you to please
My desire
Oh, got me goin'
