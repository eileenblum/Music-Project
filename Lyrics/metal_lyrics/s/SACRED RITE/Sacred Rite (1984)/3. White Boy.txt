I was walking down the street, when a lady caught my eye
As I walked right by her, she said, 'Ooooh, my, oh my!'
'If you step this way, boy, I'll give it to you free'
I said, 'I'll think about it', and you know what she said to me?

'I need a little white boy
'And I feel that you're the type, boy
'I need a little white boy
'And you sure are lookin' right, boy'

I said, 'Now wait a minute, you're comin' on too strong
'I got a feelin' you're a lady of the night, but you know I could be wrong'
She said, 'Awe, come on, son, you got to learn how to relax
'And even if I was one, wouldn't charge you any tax!'

I woke up the next morning, and I knew that I'd gone wrong
I had to find a way to warn you, that's why I wrote this song
If you ever come across a lady who's givin' up for free
I advise you to stay away, 'cause she's got some kind of disease
