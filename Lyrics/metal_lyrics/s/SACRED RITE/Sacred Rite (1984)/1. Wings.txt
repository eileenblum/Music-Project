We summon you into the night, can you hear the sound?
We've crossed the force of darkness, and drove them to the ground
Every day they turn deaf ears to what we try to say
One day they'll learn the truth, and then they'll have to pay

Like the sword of the warrior, we'll destroy the demons in the end
Like the wings of Pegasus, we'll fly to Hell and back again

We raped the sorceress and left her there to die
Burning down the devil's temple, hear his children cry
We cured the leper and he told us when he said
'Sing the songs of soldiers as you wander through the dead'

We found him crouching in the halls of darkness
Screaming madman, worshiping the dead
Praying for the night to send him swiftly to his grave
Recieving only damnation instead
