In the space of time before me
Lies the passage of the dead
I met a man, he tried to warn me
'Close your eyes', is all he said
Following the man, I see the torture
A thousand victims lie in pain
Now I hear the voice of judgement
'Throw them all into the flame!'

Who are you to murder the faithless?
Who are you to damn them all to Hell?
Do you know where they go when they leave you?
You'll pay the price for the souls that you sell

Are you the tyrant who cast them to the sea?
One day you'll be among the dead
And when they bury you beneath your enemy
Oh! Rest in peace

In the dark, they hide and tremble
Crying eyes that shake with fear
Fighting time, alone and frightened
And all at once, they disappear
Just a breath of life before them
stands the Man, the Mind, the Way
And with him go the chosen children
To their home so far away

One day you're a beggar, and the next day you're a King
But you'll never know the joy to hear your subjects when they sing
For you persecute and damn them 'till they curl up, there, and die
They call you Lucifer and you wonder why?

Total disintegration - Famine and disease
Ruthless domination - Bring them to their knees
Power to your people - Freedom to your slaves
Your torment and your evil have sent you to your grave

We find you guilty
What have you to say?
Take him away!
