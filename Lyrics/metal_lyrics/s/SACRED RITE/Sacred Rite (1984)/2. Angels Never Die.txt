From down beneath the fire
Came demons, riding high
Set forth with hate and vengance
Telling all, 'Prepare to die'

Angels taste ambrosia
Angels never lie
Angels live forever
Angels never die

With wings and eyes of fire
Destruction in their minds
Set forth to fight the heavens
'Till death destroys their kind

Angels taste ambrosia
Angels never lie
Angels live forever
Angels never die

And if you ask me how the world survived that day
I'll tell you, 'I don't know, my world has passed away'
