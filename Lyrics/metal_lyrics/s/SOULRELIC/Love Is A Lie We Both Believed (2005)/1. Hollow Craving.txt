This morning I missed you more than before
Fell from a dream so frail and you are not here to guide me through this day

Where the roses never grow to pierce your heart with blood-red glow
Crown of thorns won't shield the pain

Hollow craving has fallen upon where we lie
Together, yet separated slowly we die

[Chorus:]
And if my sun sets today to drown and sleep away
Who will be the flame to light your way?
And if solitude is my grave, seal my heart with pain
In this dark I share alone with tears

Your kiss won't grant eternal life
The voice of cruelty lurks inside
I yearn to close my eyes

Hollow craving has fallen upon us one more time
The rain is pouring down from our loveless sky

[Chorus:]
And if my sun sets today to drown and sleep away
Who will be the flame to light your way?

When I hear the call of last goodbyes, my heart is letting go of you

[Chorus:]
And if my sun sets today to drown and sleep away
Who will be the flame to light your way?
And if solitude is my grave, seal my heart with pain
In this dark I share alone with tears
