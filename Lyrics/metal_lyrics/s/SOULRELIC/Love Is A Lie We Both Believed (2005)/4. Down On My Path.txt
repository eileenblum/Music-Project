Your seent is followed by the death of what I feel
You give pain a name
In fire of the souls your tears are gasoline
And mine will bring the rain
I canÂ´t believe I threw myself away only because of you
What will I become?
Everything I ever had is dead and gone
Desire left me cold
Kill my love, bring the dark
When I see you, youÂ´re all escape I need
I will fall again
Kill my love, bring the dark
When I see you...
You are the snake and lay the apples on my path
I will fall again
I canÂ´t believe I threw myself away only because of you
What will I become?
Everything I ever had is dead and gone
Desire left me cold
Kill my love, bring the dark
When I see you, youÂ´re all escape I need
I will fall again
Kill my love, bring the dark
When I see you...
You are the sin and bleed
Your love to stain my heart with hurt
I lost my path
Kill my love, bring the dark
When I see you, youÂ´re all escape I need
I will fall again
Kill my love, bring the dark
When I see you...
