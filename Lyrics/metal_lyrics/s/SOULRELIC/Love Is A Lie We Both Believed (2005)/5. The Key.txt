Only you can save me from this night
Show the path and guide me to the light
When the life I never chose to wait
Is fading back into the shades
I want you here with me
CanÂ´t you see how it hurts to be alone and lost like a leaf
Fallen from tree and the wind is too cold
You are the one who can cure these wounds
Take my hand IÂ´m too tired to walk here alone
Without you I closed all the doors
You are the one with the key
I run for days and crawl for miles
For the life I lost inside the night
Will you be there to resque me
Or let me fade back into the shades?
I want you here with me
CanÂ´t you see how it hurts to be alone and lost like a leaf
Pain pours like rain and the wind is too cold
You are the one who can cure these wounds
Take my hand IÂ´m too tired to walk here alone
Without you I closed all the doors
You are the one with the key
You are the one who can cure these wounds
Take my hand IÂ´m too tired to walk here alone
Without you I closed all the doors
You are the one with the key
