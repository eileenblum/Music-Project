I wish I could just surrender to the wind
Drift away to better world
It`s like I could hear echoes from world beyond
Fighting against time alone
Broken heart in a freezing breeze
I can`t feel your touch anymore

Time crawls on, killing the beat inside
All that is left to me is a smile of dyin' angels
I let go and there's no turning back
All that is left to me is a smile of dyin' angels

When I met you, it felt like two stars melting as one
Now that it`s over, I realize we were always universe away from eachother
So many things unsaid
Don`t you know that frozen heart breaks into million pieces?

Time crawls on, killing the beat inside
All that is left to me is a smile of dyin' angels
I let go and there's no turning back
All that is left to me is a smile of dyin' angels

If I had just one day, I`d hold you close so I could feel you again
I can`t hear your gentle voice anymore, I`m all alone

Time crawls on killing the beat inside
All that is left to me is a smile of dyin' angels

Time crawls on, killing the beat inside
All that is left to me is a smile of dyin' angels
I let go and there's no turning back
All that is left to me is a smile of dying angels

Time crawls on killing the beat inside of me
All that is left to me is a smile of dyin' angels
