I died in hunger and your name was written on this empty plate of our love
The more I crave for you the more I bleed and hurt
Yet the plate wonÂ´t refill
We are chased by shadows of our yesterday
We crawl for more
ItÂ´s all so easy
Breathing eachother Â´til we die
And getting high of you
ItÂ´s all so easy
Beating together Â´til we pry eyes open one more time
Oh, how the dawn seems like a shroud upon our dream
Yet itÂ´s true what we see
We are chased by shadows of our yesterday
We crawl for more
ItÂ´s all so easy
Breathing eachother Â´til we die
And getting high of you
ItÂ´s all so easy
Beating together Â´til we pry eyes open one more time
So murdering hights we slowly flow to hide ourselves from what we knew
ItÂ´s all so easy
Breathing eachother Â´til we die
And getting high of you
ItÂ´s all so easy
Beating together Â´til we pry eyes open one more time
