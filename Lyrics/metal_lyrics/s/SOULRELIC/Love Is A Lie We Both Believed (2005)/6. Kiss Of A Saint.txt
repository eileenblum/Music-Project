Lost deep in your eyes
Safe in your heart
I'm still waiting for you to seal my lips with a kiss of saint

You are the air I'm breathing tonight
A heart made to be broken beats only for you

Again I'm falling from this heaven

[Chorus:]
The cloud of your love cried the sea I swim under the moon of your lies
And when stars lead me astray I hope to find you

But the darkness crawls upon us
Holding you close won't keep you here with me and I know we'll never last

[Chorus:]
The cloud of your love cried the sea I swim under the moon of your lies
And when stars lead me astray I hope to find you
