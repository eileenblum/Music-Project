Where am I and who are you?
ItÂ´s like I woke up in a different world
I can only remember what you said to me
This feeling is so divine
Strange thoughts circling around my head
IÂ´m like a fragile leaf blown by wind
After all of this is gone
IÂ´m still breathing
Will this ever end?
IÂ´m still breathing
Please make me stop
IÂ´m still breathing
IÂ´m still breathing
I saw a dream and you were there
I felt so cold and felt so blue
The light of the candle makes me colder
Reminds me of warmth I coul have
IÂ´m still lying here alone
Wishing you where here
After all of this is gone
IÂ´m still breathing
Will this ever end?
IÂ´m still breathing
Please make me stop now
IÂ´m still breathing
IÂ´m breaking through I am still breathing
Am I dead?
Is this heaven or is this hell?
It doesnÂ´t really matter
As long as you are here
After all of this is gone
IÂ´m still breathing
Will this ever end?
IÂ´m still breathing
Please make me stop
IÂ´m still breathing
IÂ´m breaking through I am still breathing
