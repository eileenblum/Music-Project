Frail like a dream, we believe in tragedy that never fails...
And our eyes share no more tears.
In front of me you will break, but it's meant to be this way.
I won't waste my dreams on you.

We were strangers of lust, embraced by hate and darkest dust.
By the stream of a dream we drowned our tears... Tears of deceit.

When life will bring us to grieve and despair is our song, we sing along and cherish the moment.
I don't know why we buried our love with a smile and then believed we could heal hearts with our tears.

Love is a lie we both believed.
