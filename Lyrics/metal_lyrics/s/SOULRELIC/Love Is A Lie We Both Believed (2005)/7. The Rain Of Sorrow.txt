Sway like a tree the day as clouds float away
The wings are too weak to save the fallen one
Who believed in life that now ends here tonight
Dreams crumbled and died
When hurt is endless the cure is to throw yourself away
Hope only betrays
The rain of sorrow has paved the path and the thorns
Will keep you awake for as long it falls
For as long it falls, for as long it falls
Time can heal a broken heart or leave you to prey
The clock would tell for end and fight away the dawn
Tomorrow is a door and the seal youÂ´ll never break
Would only betray
The rain of sorrow has paved the path and the thorns
Will keep you awake for as long it falls
The sorrow has paved the path and the thorns
Will keep you awake for as long it falls
The rain of sorrow has paved the path and the thorns
Will keep you awake for as long it falls
The sorrow has paved the path and the thorns
Will keep you awake for as long it falls
