We are made to die and born again
Until the ones we hurt no longer feel the pain
Desire haunts
WeÂ´re falling like rain to kill the flame of our love
And in your arms I cannot be saved
We have no heart to say goodbye
No strengh to hold on
We wither away and burn to ashes all we have
The wind is cold where we are one with the ones
We loved and slowly burn our hearts to light the dark
Can the words we say renew the broken dream?
Or will our hearts bleed again until we drown this sin?
We have no heart to say goodbye
No strengh to hold on
We wither away and burn to ashes all we have
We have no heart to say goodbye
No strengh to hold on
We wither away and burn to ashes all we have
We have no heart to say goodbye
No strengh to hold on
We wither away and burn to ashes all we have
When all is gone, we are alone
And love is a lie we both believed
