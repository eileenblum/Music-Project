Been spendning their days at Hobarth's Inn
Came for a drink and they stayed for ten
The wind was howling on the winding road
When the smoke fro a chimney smelled like home
Weary warriors shethed their swords
Heavy wood creeks as they stepped theough the door

Welcome to Hobarth's Inn
If you're thirsty, come on in
Welcome to Hobarth's Inn
If you're lonely, come on in

Forget that quest the you think you're on
Hobarth's Inn
When the goings hard
And the waethers cold
A pint of his sle
Will fix your soul
Relax, I said kick back
Hey man, you dont need that act

Welcome to Hobarth's Inn
If you're thirsty, come on in
Welcome to Hobarth's Inn
If you're lonely, come on in
