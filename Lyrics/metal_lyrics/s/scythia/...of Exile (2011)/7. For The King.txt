For the king we ride tonight
For the king we fight
For the king we will die tonight
We are not afraid

For the king we ride tonight
For the king we fight
For the king we will die tonight
And death is not the end

Now we ride and on we charge
Into this battlefield
We raise our swords
And together we shout
For the king we sacrifice our mortal lives

If you offer a fight
Downfall is your fate
Prepare yourself
As the reaper greets you
For the king we sacrifice our very lives

The ravages of war
It's a price you pay
Upon the field where savages prowl
For the king we sacrifice our very lives

For the king we live by the sword
Die by the sword
Fight for the day

Live by the sword
Die by the sword
Fight for the day

For the king we ride tonight
For the king we fight
For the king we die tonight
And death is not the end
