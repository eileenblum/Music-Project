King: a voice screaming in my brain
Causing bloodshed, an end to my reign

What happened to my kingdom
What happened to my soul

Sword: I am the voice of the sword
You choose me to kill your enemies

Now you can see the lust of blood and gore
You have no thoughts, you are mine to control
None can resist the bidding of my word
You have succumbed to the voice of the sword

King: you six warriors must help me
Free my mind
Help me quiet that voice deep inside

In a time of war I struck my enemies down
Across the desert I searched
This ancient blade was found
Stained with the blood of thousands
It had an evil heart
I tried to be rid of it
It would never part

Sword: you six warriors cannot help
And death awaits you if you try
This old king is mine to control
Forever til the end of time

King: help me regain my sane mind
I can help you with your good cause
Help me now t silence the voice of the sword

I can overcome my honor remains
You have no hold
Over my soul
They need me
To reach their final goal

Adamantium on which evil shadows dwell
Let it be known the sword comes from hell
