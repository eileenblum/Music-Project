Charging soldiers race on foot
With pounding hearts
Through blazing heat
An ordeal fraught with hopeless odds
They press on towards the keep
Tactics of an ancient king
Seen as ruin from a blinded eye

Battle has come
To this fortress of lies
Balancing the art of war
The flames never die
Battle has come
To this fortress of lies
Balancing the art of war
The fear in their eyes

Arrows soaring overhead
Burning oil drinks the dead
Few in number heroes charge through
The gate and the courtyard
Mayhem reigning on this field
Yells, screams and the clash of steel

Battle has come
To this fortress of lies
Balancing the art of war
The flames never die
Battle has come
To this fortress of lies
Balancing the art of war
The fear in their eyes

Up the ramparts they press ahead
Valor fills their noble hearts
In this hour of reckoning
Beyond thick walls of stone
An inner cloister rests
Where the high priest is waiting
With spite in his chest
No is the time
When two forces collide
Freedom versus dominance
At the fortress of lies
