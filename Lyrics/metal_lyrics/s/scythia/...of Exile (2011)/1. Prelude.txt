In a time, not long forgotten
In a place where magic still lives
Trusted Chancellor
Guardian of Talus
Seized power from his noble king

It became a grave situation
Monarch exiled and stricken down
Knights they gathered, few in number
The days of Heroes had long passed

There they stood, ready for vengeance
Bravely awaiting the forces of evil
Hordes they came
Countless in number
They betrayer led
Stronger than before

The sands of time were falling faster
As the reaper waits for his flock
Warriors outnumbered
On the field of war
Forced to flee to the mountain inside
Here we are beaten and surrendered
They shouted to the silent stone
Waiting wearily
The unexpected came
