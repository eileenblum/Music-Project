Onward I began my journey
Away from home
Exiled from my kingdom
Yes, betrayal in the bloodline
Twas my father's brother
Who seized the throne for his own
Sentenced to the only rightful heir
To walk alone
And so it was written
This unknown quest
But deep inside I knew
Fates guides my step in every way

I walked until I found a shrine
A place forgotten by the hands of time
There I lay my sword
When it spoke to me
Consoling me in my time of need

I commanded legions
Saved men from their demise
In my finest hour
I watched my empire rise

I was the answer
The harbinger of change
But those days have ended
And my destiny lies estranged

I walked until I found a shrine
A place forgotten by the hands of time
There I lay my sword
When it spoke to me
Consoling me in my time of need

'Tis the tale of a fallen king
Withering away at the hands of time
What does fortune bring?
Will you help me again?
And reclaim my kingdom and birthright
