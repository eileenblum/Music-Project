And thus we stood amongst dust and debris
Within the fortress walls from inside the keep
The last rabble came swinging and clashing their swords
Outnumbered we were, a broken king
And a Handful of warriors
The battle was fierce, the stakes were high
And death was close at hand

On this day, this day of wrath
The high priest looked down and laughed
He didn't suspect his guard could fall
As we were but a handful strong

Hold ground warriors
Have no fear for death or pain
Go forth with pride
For we rule this cursed night
Make way for your king
Risen from his dark betrayal
Ruthless in your plight
Show your strength in this fight

Charging through the castle halls
And raze the armory
Determination in their minds
Devoted tot this strife
Hell ablaze within the keep
Awaits the light of day

Victory
The battle is won
His reign is done
Rejoice
Warriors in arms
Redeemed
Bound by the sword
