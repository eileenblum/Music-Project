Thunder on the mountainside
Amongst spires of stone
Where shadows hide
The journey has been long
And weariness only grows

Hollow and desolate
Our march of exile carries on

Spirit of the quest lives on
It is the strength
The move beyond
Spirit of the quest lives on
A glimmer of hope
In the darkest times

Adversity has no meaning
When the fire begins to roar
Life courses through our tired soul

Spirit of the quest lives on
It is the strength
The move beyond
Spirit of the quest lives on
A glimmer of hope
In the darkest times
