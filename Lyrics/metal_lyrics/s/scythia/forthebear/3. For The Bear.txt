For the bear we ride tonight,
For the bear we drink tonight,
For the bear we dance tonight
and dance the night away!

Put him in a cage, put him up on stage,
make him dance the night away
wiser than his forest kin but he's ours to entertain
if he ever gets away, he will make us pay
blood and claws, revenge of the bear
