Invaders below
Ones that defiled our home
Silently pursued our prey
Foreign laws we can't obey!

Asking for courage
wisdom and more
Grant us your favour in war
You were there for our fathers
and fathers before in our
ancestor's tales of lore

Never to leave my post
I swore an Eternal Oath
Forced to stand my ground
I swore an Eternal Oath

Blood shall run
Men shall fall
Uphold the
eternal oath

Pay homage to death
Curse them 'til our final breath
Even if we fall tonight
our vengeance shall be had!
