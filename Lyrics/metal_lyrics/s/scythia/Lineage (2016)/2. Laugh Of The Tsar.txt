Many centuries ago when the tides of man were turning
There was a leader who ruled the land with an iron fist
They knew him only as the tsar and this is his tale

Now you will fear
wrath drawing near
you will cringe at the
Laugh of the tsar

all my armies marching forward
desecrating sacred lands
reaping spoils and taking riches
conquering with iron hands
Flee before the savage bear
he will tear into your flesh

I will conquer and you will feel my wrath

Now you will bow before me I am the tsar

Leader of the holy army
Torturing those who oppose
I will drown your helpless screams
Laugh of the Tsar

Crusading with a higher power
Seizing all my rightful lands
With the might of Bannered steel
Laugh of the Tsar

I am the tsar
Kneel before me
I pass judgment
on all those I see

All will succumb to my reign
Bringing slavery and death
I'm the beast of bedtime stories
Stealing children in the night
I will rule this land forever
Never shall my legend die

I will conquer and you will feel my wrath
Now you will bow before me I am the tsar

Laugh of the Tsar
Sounding in the night
Laugh of the Tsar
Following you everywhere
