Riding hard across frozen lands
With no guarantee that we will survive
They found me and taken me in
Will there be initiation to this pagan land?

Run, run, fight!
Hunt, hunt, prey of predator?

Banners flying high through the arctic tundra sky
Just another night in the army of the bear
No one dares to oppose the way of the warrior's code
Ride with us in the army of the bear

Singing of the glory days
Sanctity in ancient ways
Never forget lest you fail!

For seven month I've been called here
To this place where mortals dread
I lost my way, I'm found again
Remember I must seek the master within the labyrinth!

Banners flying high through the arctic tundra sky
Just another night in the army of the bear
No one dares to oppose the way of the warrior's code
Ride with us in the army of the bear

Singing of the glory days
Sanctity in ancient ways
Never forget lest you fail!

Run, run, fight!
Hunt with us in the army of the bear
