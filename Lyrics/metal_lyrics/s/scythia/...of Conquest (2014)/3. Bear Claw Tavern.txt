I' m heading away and I wont be back for a very long time
Hide your woes, show your smile and pour my cup of wine
On the morrow i set to sea and know not when I'll be back
So come my friends and drink with me until the day is black

Though the rain is pouring down my spirits are still high
Reckoning day is fast upon but still I've got to try
I walk abreast with friends of old through the streets at night
A tavern we spy not too far lit by lantern light

'Tis the place where the hearth's ablaze
The fire warms your bones
Forget your troubles and earthly woes
'Tis your second home

Tavern known through the ages fill your cup at the Bear Claw
Minstrels sing of heroes and legends tell your tale at the Bear Claw
Brigands and bandits, captains and sailors all cross paths at the Bear Claw

Fast we approach with lingering hope this place of cobble and straw
Where a placard hung of polished brass, emblem of a bear claw
Open door that revealed a festive scene within
Jolly sailors, merchants, wenches packed it to the brim

Once inside we waste no time kicking off the night
Seven years I may be gone, sailing nay respite
But this place was made for legendary time
Here I dance with the blackened beast, get me in the morning!

'Tis the place where the hearth's ablaze
The fire warms your bones
Forget your troubles and earthly woes
'Tis your second home

Tavern known through the ages fill your cup at the Bear Claw
Minstrels sing of heroes and legends tell your tale at the Bear Claw
Brigands and bandits, captains and sailors all cross paths at the Bear Claw
