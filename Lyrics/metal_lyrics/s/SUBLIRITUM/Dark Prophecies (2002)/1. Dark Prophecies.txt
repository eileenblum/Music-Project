Morning rise awakening of the darkage
The time has come, so beware and prepare
You can see, you can fell that all evil are about to be real
The words written the prophecy will reveal

And you are the chosen one. The one to see, the one to lead
The Path is dark, the ride is long, you'll see the end and return again
Bleed for your soul, fight for your life
Surrender in blackness, surrender all evil lies

Now the brave men must stand proud
To the fields they are heading
The dark path they all follow
At the battlefield their faith will be sealed

Fight your enemy with great perfection
You stand in flames your hands burning your eyes flashing
Sparking lights like chariots of thunder will approach
But the grimmest of them all stand above all the others

So beware and prepare, it's the time of the oath
Dark age, evil age is coming let the shadows be your guide
It's our ride towards the final battle
It's the end of an era, but is it the birth of another?

Now the brave men must stand proud
To the fields they are heading
The dark path they all follow
At the battlefield their faith will be sealed

Conquerors of the Night is set to conquer
Prepare for the final fight, it's already in sight
Could this be my imagination
Could this be my darkest fantasies
Is there no way back
Is this a dream or is it reality?
