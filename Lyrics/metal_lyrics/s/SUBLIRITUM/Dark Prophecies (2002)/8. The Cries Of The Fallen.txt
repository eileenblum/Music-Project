Now the battlefields are quiet, they have fell into decay
Your god didn't come to save you, even though you did pray

The echoes of the screams from the battle can still be heard
The cries and the tears of the fighting men we can taste in the air

As we look towards these ruins, these fields of putrefaction,
We can see the bodies of the fallen men mingled with blood

Their eyes are widely open,
Even though they have lain dead for a long time

They know is so well, that this torture will never leave this planet
They are still terrified, they can never find peace anymore!

Their major loss of their men made us even stronger
The can never be a prevent for us any longer

We came as their mortal enemy,
They died at the hand of their murderer
Face you death, your only salvation!

In these battles they were doomed for all eternity,
Nothing could save them

Now the battlefields are silent, cold and lonely
The blood of the fallen has now colored the sky into deep, intense red
We look towards the sky
A heavy fog marks the essence of the brutal, cold truth

Now we can rise proudly above the ones who fell
Our honor is now regained
And will be preserved for the future to come

We can smell the stench decaying bodies
And fell the their confusion of unanswered prayers

We can still hear the silent cries of the fallen...
