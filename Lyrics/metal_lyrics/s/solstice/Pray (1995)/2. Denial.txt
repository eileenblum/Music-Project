Mind explodes, pressure you can't take
Everybody goes by, closer to point break
Everywhere you look
Everyone turns on you
On the verge of ending
All existence made of hate

Embellished insight
In the light of frenzied life
Distant inner fear resides
Rising up through denial

Complicate
Aggravate
Asphyxiate

Desolate
Separate
My altered state

Dizziness
Binding sense
More complex

Thoughts obsessed
False pretense
Perplexing stress

Punishment
Detriment
Torn apart
