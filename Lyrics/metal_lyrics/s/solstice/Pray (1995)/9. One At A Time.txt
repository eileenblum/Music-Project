Hate's expand with fear genocide
Rape the land of life
Nations fall behind the wall
The second coming of Christ

Confiscate the meaning of life
Desolation bleeding my eyes
Sympathy has weakened your mind
Deafened by the wind

Bright lights remove your sight
Politicians have lost
The clud expands to take your breath
Suck it right from your lungs

Global warfare hate
One a man at a time
Violence takes its place
The earth will turn into hell

Confiscate the meaning of life
Desolation bleeding my eyes
Sympathy has weakened your mind
Deafened by the wind

Reality betrays the law
Volation of pride
Contaminate my deepest thoughts
Extend the truth with lies

Emptiness swells inside
The continent divides
Obliterate the populace
Send them back to God
