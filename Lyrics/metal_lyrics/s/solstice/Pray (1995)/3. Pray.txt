New found evidence
Apparent disbelief
Brothers in faith
Without a God
Purity now corrupt
Messiah laid to rest

Dead in the public eye
Dispel the faith of human kind

Tear the heart of being
The light everlasting

Faith is proven failure
Annihilate the savior
Deviate the maker
The world is cast aside

Pray

Wisdom falls to science
And burns in his defiance

Faith is proven failure
Annihilate the savior
Deviate the maker
The world is cast aside

Pray
