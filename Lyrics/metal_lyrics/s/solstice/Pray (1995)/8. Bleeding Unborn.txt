I'm left collapsed and torn
Life's honesty is gone
Infected minds
Infected cry
The lies remain lies
I'm bleeding unborn
Bleed before my first breath
Cut out extinct
Preconceived end
Twisted now dead
I'm ripped apart
The bleeding unborn
Born premature
Violated body torn
Dissected worm
Bleeding unborn
Death surgery
I'm denied to be
Conscious left to scar
I no longer bleed
Bleed
