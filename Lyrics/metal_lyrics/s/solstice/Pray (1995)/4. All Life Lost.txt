Pain inside you can't release
Try and try but won't succeed
Inner virus eats away
Life's a struggle you die a slave
Motionless you lie in pain
For yourself wishing death
Now these days you waste away
Pray to God you deteriorate

You've seen the end closer and closer
Too late, but now you comprehend
You have lived a lie, hating yourself
To late for you to realize
The pain you've cause
To those around you

On your knees beg for forgiveness
Now you plead with no hope at all
Body destroyed worthless you are to yourself
All of life is lost now you repent
Internally mind still intact
The misery eats you away inside
