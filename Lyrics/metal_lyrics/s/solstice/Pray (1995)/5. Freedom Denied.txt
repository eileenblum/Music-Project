Mind so gone
The existence of your thought are dead
Individualism is a lie
Forced acceptance of a false sense of price
Consciousness
Misguided heads
Open minds have fallen dead
Blinding lights
Freedom died
Lies
Obscured views
Plants the seed inside the youth
Rejected being
Spawn recedes - denied esteem
Hideously
Victim to the machine
Blame I realize
Freedom has died
Upset by pride
Freedom denied
Disassembles feelings
Turn to face hypocrisy
Torn beings
Left to swell, suffer beneath
The remains
Our society so lost
To machines
