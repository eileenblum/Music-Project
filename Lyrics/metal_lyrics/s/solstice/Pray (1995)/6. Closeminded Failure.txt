Censored waves distort my ears
Limiting the general population
Gripping the mind molding the view
Experimental machinery
Offspring detail closeminded failure
Sibling mind rot intensify
Regulated tax invaded not created
To serve the man

Take away my dignity
Suppress me in society
Aggravate my intellect
Suffocate my self respect
I'm drowning in your fucking politics

Confiscate my right to say
Repercussions limiting
Expressions is now forced between
Oppression and lack of dignity

Dishonesty corrupts the truth
Morality poisons the roots
American life dissolves
For liberty and justice for all

Labelling all forms of life
America is categorized
People are left behind
Nothing to visualize

Desolation reigns inside of
What was once my brain
Labelling expression keeps
The population lame
Forced behind a limit freedom
Slowly drifts away
Life it seems with everything
Was meant to be free
You disgrace yourself
Beyond a reasonable doubt
How can you call yourself
A breathing human being
You turn my words around
And bend the truth beyond
You feel you can control me
