Anger and suffering
Repressed self esteem
Swallowed in shame
Honor taken away

Depression
Preconceived stability
Weakening
Justified on your knees

Twisted mindlessly
Perception ripped and torn
Breathless I suffocate
Beg to be unborn

Depression
Preconceived stability
Weakening
Justified on your knees

Stagnate emotions drowns
Bleeding hearts decay
Numbness destroys my nerves
Feelings wiped away

Fear now bred with lunacy
Faceless I'm left inhumane
No control identity
Depression swells my state of being
