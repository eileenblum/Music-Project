Once called you a friend
Now I call you a liar
My fucking eyes see red
Hate swells inside

Regret you've come ahead
Your loss my gain
There is strength in pain
I wish you were never born
Die you worthless fuck
I turn my back to you
While you swell in idiocy

Concern no longer a friend
Mistrust agonizing end
Your shit outa luck
Bust you in the suck
