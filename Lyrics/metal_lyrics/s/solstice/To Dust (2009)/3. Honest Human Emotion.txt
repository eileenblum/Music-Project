Under and in between me
Layers of scars define
Twisted deformed emotion
Colors bleed in black and white

Honest human emotion
Overwhelms me
From the inside through
The light everlasting
But the inside leaves
It's shell cracked and fading
Inner dying seed planted
Under nothing

The scars remain
and paint the page along the way
The picture fades
Here and now the colors grey
Anointed by
This loneliness where I can hide
Deep inside
The well is cracked and has gone dry
