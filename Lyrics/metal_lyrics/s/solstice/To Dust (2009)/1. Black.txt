Deep inside this hole where no life sees
Emptiness surrounding everything
Deafening silence speaks, my ears bleed
Clotting remnants of emotion
Black

Loathing in my amnesty
Underneath lucidity
Drowning in the absence of
Conscious inner faith
Submerged in theology
Breathing in the fluid
Black

Swimming through the seas of nothing
Drowning in the waves of absent feeling
Choking on the fluid that submerges me

I can't see beyond the colors
Of this blackened mind
Isolated deep within
Severed nerves feel nothing
Choking on the fluid that
is submerging me
