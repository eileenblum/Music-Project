Nothing more for me to see
From the eye that sleeps
Closed within a silent dream
A meal for the worms to eat

No rise into the heavens
No three day resurrection
No pass into purgatory
Nothing! To dust

Complicate the ending
With the dreams of ever-after
Consuming every breath
You breathe the filth of rapture
Poisoned words
Condemn the non-believer
Close my eyes and lay to rest
And let the worms devour

Return to the mother
Remove the weight forever
Wash away the stigma
I don't need it where I'm going
Nail shut the coffin
And drop into the nothing
Decompose
My flesh within the temple
Withering
Nothing here
And nothing to betray
Close my eyes and lay to rest
And let the worms devour
