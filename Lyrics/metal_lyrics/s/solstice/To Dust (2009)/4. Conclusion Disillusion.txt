[Intro:]
Have you seen Jesus anywhere?
No... I haven't. I thought he was with you!

Torn away from everything
Everything that loves me
Solitude's awakening
Remove the black-toothed grin
Savior is calling me
Summoned to the hanging tree
Grind the path before me
And show me this misery
Show me this suffering

Open my mind to believe, I see
Nothing to ease this suffering in me

Conclusion disillusion
Tainting the pool I drown in
Sinking to the bottom
Substance the bludgeoning

Looking through my eyes conceive
A flame that burns to save me
To get me through just one more day
And scar one more memory
The chapel doors are open
Consume the flesh, forgiven
Forgive the flesh, consume
And burn the gates of heaven

My life's rotting slow
Consume flesh
Nothing left
