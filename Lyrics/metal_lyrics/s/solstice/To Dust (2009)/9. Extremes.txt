[originally by Cynic]Society's selfish meaning to confine 
Disabled by the need to cure an insecurity 
Masses strive to keep themselves in line 
While the radical seek attention all the time 

Say they're sick - just hypochondriacs 
Cry some more, I know it's all an act 

Lies...taken to extremes 
Despised...because of what they need 
A selfish thought to please themselves 
They strive to succeed in what they're looking for 
Defying, lying, rebelling for attention 
A disability taken from one extreme to another 

[Chorus:]
Abusing rights, defying given laws 
Excessive whining, they desire sympathy 
Rebel, they prove their lives are just a flaw 
Immoderate acts plagued by the disease 
I proved them wrong but they're the ones to blame 
Defeated fair and square at their own game
