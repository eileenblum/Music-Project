Images of the victims, they suffer
Their innocence means nothing to me
Capture the enemy, discriminate
Feel my wrath, my brother

Remove the face of compassion
And raise this heavy hand
Broken bones of opposition
Taint this holy land

A congregation lied to
This parable untold
Sacrifice diplomacy
Let the war machine unfold

Return of your lord
Return of your savior
Deliver us from evil
Deliver the enemy
