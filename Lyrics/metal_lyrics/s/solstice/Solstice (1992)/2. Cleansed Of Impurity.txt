Driven to the limit
I refudse to abide by the rules
Insolate fools
Injustive served by manipulative tools
The hands of authority label you ignorantly
Keeping you confined
Blinded from the truth - propaganda
Feeding you with lies

All of the unjust condemned with battlescars
Countless occassions of people getting
Paid off to look the other way
The land of the free and the home of
The brave its time to make a change
Suspended in paralysis of al that is
Just what is right? Wake up!

Autoritative figureskeep you in their
Sights like a sniper on a roof
I wish I had eyes in the back of my head
'Cause I know I'm gonna need 'em

All of the unjust condemned with battlescars
Countless occassions of people getting
Paid off to look the other way
The land of the free and the home of
The brave its time to make a change
Suspended in paralysis of al that is
Just what is right?

Painful truth
Hurts so much that you try not to
Deal with it and you try not to as
Much as you fucking can

I'm both shocked and amazed
I watch a display of dishonost with
No guilt, no conscience, no morality
I'm slapped by reality....

Autoritative figureskeep you in their
Sights like a sniper on a roof

Enter now deceptive one to be
Cleansed of all impurity
Be forewarned I'm prepared to use
Whatever force is necessary

Plastic shitbag
Don't tell me what to do 'cause
I have no boundaries
My fist, your face, get down on your knees.
Suck it!
