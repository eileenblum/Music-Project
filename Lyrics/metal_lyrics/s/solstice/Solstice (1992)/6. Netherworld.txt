More a state of being rather than a place
Hell is merely a stage for the soul
But all must walk the path
Uncertainty, the problem of pain
Experience second death
The soul that sins shall die, supposedly...

Consequence in the hereafter
Weeping, gnashing of teeth
This world revolves around conflich
And opposing forces.

Unquenchable fire to this stop could be the last
The inner sanctum not easily grasped

Left in limbo, unholy infants are then cast away]
