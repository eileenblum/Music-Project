While pinned to a slab of
Marble on the floor
Dreaming of carnal pleasures
You beg for castration
Then somebody counts of ten and the
Parade goes by nursery rhymes
Screams of ecstacy and of pain
Broadcasts on inaudible frequencies
Dissonant music
A great orchestral swell
Swell of noise....

All those unconscious desires and fears
Wants and needs, repressed
Longings have been set free
Eternal waking the sentencing
Staring into the maske of all your fears,
Face unveiled...

The torture has begun and
Will never cease within eternal waking
Recurring nightmares endlessly
Consciousness appears impossible to regain
Realisation of the grimmest reality
To fight a losing battle within yourself...

Chronic phantasmagoria...
All those unconscious desires and fears
Wants and needs, repressed
Longings have been set free
Eternal waking the sentencing
Staring into the maske of all your fears,
Forevermore...

The torture has begun and
Will never cease within eternal waking
Recurring nightmares endlessly
Consciousness appears impossible to regain
Realisation of the grimmest reality
To fight a losing battle within yourself...
