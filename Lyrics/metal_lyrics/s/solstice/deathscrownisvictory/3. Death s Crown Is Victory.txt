Like wheat in the wind, bow and bend
Your Will And Your Knee, To That Of Your Lord.
He Laughs, Beckons, To Fools Who Listen
Enraptured By Words, Hollow, Ill Thought
Revenants Of Rebellion, Haunt Your Periphery
A Cold And Nameless Grave, The propylon Void

Burning Darkness, Seething Rays of Holocaust
The glory fields unto which we'll pass
Are dressed with fire not stone

And here is where we stand, upright and unchained
Whilst your shaking hands, tend to bloodied knee
Without a name, you are not a man

Never Forget, The Chains That Bind
You Left Your Kith, For Slavery
Weâll Never Surrender, Weâll Never Yield
Deathâs Crown Is Victory

The wind heaves heavily, to sweep out the day
And, like that, another flag is planted on unbroken ground
It is not fear but respite that carries our sails
So continue, we do, toward far off shores

Ten are your thousands to each one of us,
Yet not one heart that beats in song
We come to fight not to fall.
The tide retreats from the cowering shore
So it need not wear our blood tonight.

When the silence roars loudest, the moment is closest..
