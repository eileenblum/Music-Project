Trembling Courtiers, In The Shadow Of Saturnists
Will Their Masters Reap, With Brimstone Fist
Promised The Light, By Plague Wielder Pestiferous

Contumelious Feasting, On The Frail, The Weak.
Still Black Maxims Flow, Like A Poisoned River
Over The Fevered, Engorged, Corpulent Mass

Sits Rapturous, Poisonous, In Pious Light
The Salt &amp; The Maggot, In England's Wounds.
So Gather Wolves, Gather, With Fury Unleashed

Beset Them With Tooth, And Razor Claw
The Shame Of Their Saviour's Stigmata &amp; Suffering
Death Is The Crown, That All Men Shall Wear.

My Name Is Revenge
Their Fate Cast In Stone
My Name Is Blood
Is Fire, Is Death
I Am The Hunter
Wielder Of Truth

Weeping Trickster, Is Martyred No Longer
To Carrion, To Offal, For The Beak Of The Crow
Torn Unto Shreds, Commandment &amp; Gospel
The Deiparous Now, Shall Repast Alone.
