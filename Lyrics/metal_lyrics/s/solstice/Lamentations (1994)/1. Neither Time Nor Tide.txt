lone narcissust
mad at the sun
he wanders defeated
through cities of dust
amidst frustration
like so many dreams
of saints and sinners, none could percieve
the fall from heaven, and mow we would bleed
face the adversary, with rage inside
nothing can erase, neither time, nor tide
dark is the heart
that could not feel
the silent screams
grieving sentinal
eye among the blind
holds salvation
ravaged paradise
torn are the skies
in oblivion
orchid of happiness
never to bloom
blessed with his tears
