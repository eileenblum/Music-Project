the page reads another tale
the story of my yesterday
onwards along the bleak paths trail
follow the script until
the path I walk
to me is blind
and only the haze is clear
forever search
and never find
reason for life so dear
nowhere journey
grace me a destiny
grant me immortality
then I will forever be
i'll bathe within the fountain of youth
to keep the dark at bay
my dark reflections find the truth
scenes only fate portrays
from my goal i'll never cower
nor future present vision
torturous existence I will devour
until I find my salvation
