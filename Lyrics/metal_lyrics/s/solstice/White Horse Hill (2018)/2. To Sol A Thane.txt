None so revered
As the orchard keeper
Whilst his cargo sways heavily.

See now, he's forgotten.
Like all the mute ones when bellies fill.
See now as I spit only contempt for you

For all that weave only
From second hand passions.

Mine is the heart that skips not a single beat
For all your kind.

I am not your kin, I'm not your peer.
You that bear not a thought of your own making..

Ye in panic and ye in retreat
Ye who sing laments of sufferings not yet born.
Your minds collected
Are unfit to engage even one of ours.

Ye who roar surrender in unison
With yet even a whisper of carnage to be anointed.

The wolf with lamb's heart falls in shame.
Having died tasting no blood but his own
Having died a coward.
