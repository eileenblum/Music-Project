Barren lie our homes, our women
Whilst our children fall ill
Idle lie our men, our fields
In the shadow of White Horse Hill

This is how it was once was
How it had been for the decades before
Fields were tilled, then crops borne
Homes were built and families grew
Children nurtured until they bore their own

Our vast fields ran further than any eye could hope to see
and their harvests left no table bare

No matter the stormâs ferocity or the how sharp the teeth
Of the coldest wind one went without safety or warmth
Just as our currency was truth
Just as our courts let any man's mind be spoken

And for the longest of times we never knew of any other way
Every man, woman and child here today
Knows of love only through stories and tales
From those old enough to recall but it has long left us

It is a foolâs gold that makes rich a man now,
And your truth will buy you only the lonely walk
to our hungry gallows
Few are the children born of love or family

The word of few is law
Those fluent in lie and half-truth
theirs is a poetry of deceit
