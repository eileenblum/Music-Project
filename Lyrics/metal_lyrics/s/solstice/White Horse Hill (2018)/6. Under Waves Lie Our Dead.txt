With nothing left, worth giving or talking
I hope for some kind of balance
Is it better not to know
To lie here sleep, taken by the flow

It's so hard not to notice you went away
Despite the promise of time to watch over me
To clean my wounds
The journey to surrender is one so complicated
In the midst of so many storms.
Would they still call it defeat
Even though the will to fight has gone?

Sometimes I realise it's so hard just to do;
When I must raise the heart of my soul.
I see then it's not when or not who,
Just simply that I'm no longer whole.

And here I'll ask you to remember me
As I was, rather than I have become
I'll ask that you pass these shores, without stopping
I'll ask only this, as you give yourself to the sea
