It's only now I see distant ships
Fall to the horizon
What had been here most of my days
Will be here no more

All those things I could have said
In their place are all the things I never will say.
On the ocean and away with its water are you

On the ocean and away with the sails
Is something which I love so dearly
Both are together and gone.

It's the silence that fades fastest
Like the stillness that comes when the water
No longer holds trace of your leaving.

How would you ever know that you are loved
When I never did speak of it
And how would you ever, ever know
When you are so far
far away from me
From love and from me
