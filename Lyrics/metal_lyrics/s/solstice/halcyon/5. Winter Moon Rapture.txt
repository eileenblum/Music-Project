Cleanse My Wounds In Winter Moon Desire
The Endless Quest For Sanctuary Pure
As Formless Leviathans Swim Avernian Seas
Crystal Citadels Call Me In My Dreams
Desolate Epochs, The Statues They Weep
Through Aeons Passing, The Guardians Still Sleep

My Heart Greets Forests, Once Sacred, Profane
The Earth My Mistress In Pleasure And Pain
Seeking Solace In The Glory That Was
of Hidden Shrines To gods Now Lost
Amongst Hopes Ruins To Find My True Place
I Orphaned of Heritage, A Man No Race

Cleanse My Wounds In Winter Moon Desire
The Endless Quest For Sanctuary Pure
Drown Nights Sorrow In Rapture Divine
Enchantment Delirium And Yet Do I Seek
Winter Moon Rapture, The Ebb of Her Light
But I Cannot See, For Tears In My Eyes

The Tower of Silence
The Fortress of Strength
The Wealth of Compassion
Would Ease My Descent
