From Lack of Hope, Confusion And Anger
Nightgaunts They Mock, My Brooding Tragedy

Her Word Made Flesh
And Seek Us Not, In The Darkside We Dwell
A Realm of Broken Hope And Madness
A Myriad of Unemotional Hell

Starborn She Serenades, My One Desire, A Fleeting Touch
Draw Down The Sun, Reborn
Words Unspoken Now Forever Gone
Open Your Mind And Open Your Heart
Please My Child In This Place of Dark

This Shard of Dirt, May Obscure Her Light
The Pain Increases, As Time Drifts By
The Muted Pleas, We Cannot Hear
In The Cold Damp Earth, Of Spoken Fear....
