Forgive me father (for I have dreamed)
Of nighted vales, betwixed time and light
Still falls the rain, silent, unclean
Unfetted, unleashed, I sought the gate
Lascivious, beckoning, at the threshholds forbode
Satyriasis vermivorous in shadow encloaked
Frozen in antiquity (mocking cruelly)
Terous in angle citadels profane
Across yawning chasm of tribulation
Farewell to Sol, in perpetuum rise
(Ascension beyond) corporeal constraint
Would the glaze of Algol sear my eyes?

Winds from the black mountain, rend and tear
Sepulchral thanes, so much walking dust
Icelocked the nexus, an empire awaits
Axiom abhorent, protean triumvirate

Forgive me father (for I walk alone)
To a destiny untained, opaque, my own.
