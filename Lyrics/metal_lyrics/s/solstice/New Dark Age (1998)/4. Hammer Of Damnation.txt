Enjewelled the crown, of mirrored deception
Where the serpent lay coiled, upon Babilian tower
In charnel gardens, spawn twelve black orchids
Colder than death, incandescent they shine

Sentinels of stone, speak sweet delirium
Paragons of virtue, with poison tongues
Ossific cathedrals masqued in innocence
Belie wrath arcanum (are we undone)

Downward christus soldier onwards
From your twisted tower (of malice and spite)
The opiate archeus that you feast upon
Our primal lands of winter and night
Damn us all with your mercy and charity
From chaos is found, true shape and form
The inferno of summer may hold us in check
But we will awaken, no longer in thrall
