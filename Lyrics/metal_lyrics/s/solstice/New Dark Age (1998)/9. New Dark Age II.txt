Beyond these mountains lay vistas of dread
Black sea of infinity herin they drift
Devolved as one atrophied architects
Cyclopean forms askew in the midst
(Of) seraphic decay, an unbeheld might
The arcane majesty a conqueror awaits

Captors of millennia cloaked in confusion
Cast ever out to the tides of time
Gathered in silent peripheral empires
(Of) dust choked oceans who sing their last
Vanquished voyagers of revelation
A brooding enigma yet still to pass

Sinistral gulfs yet may be crossed
To ophidian cowering citadels
Raptoral judgement upon all our sins
This placid island of ignorance
