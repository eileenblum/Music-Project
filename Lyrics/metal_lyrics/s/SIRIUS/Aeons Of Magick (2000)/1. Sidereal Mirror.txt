The hand of oblivion stretches at me. What worlds lie beyond the abyss? 
Whither dost thy stare take me for so long? Hither do we not belong..? (do 
we not belong?)
Alas, they forsaken energy springs into radial reflections, which in me 
reassemble whole of essence for which my soul thirsts - my sidereal mirror 
from where the stars arose.
Yet far can I sense thy hand, such is the power of your presence! Whose 
voice, this of the leading silence? And what face portrayeth behind the veil?
Whence dost it call? Thy bewildering song! Such beauty dost not hither 
belong... (Whence dost it call? Thy bewildering song! Such beauty dost not, 
dost not belong, dost not belong)
Once I gazed at thee, in the river of hope. But this, the reflection of thy 
thoughts in mine, was but the flow of the waters, of despair.
Yet far can I sense thy hand, such is the power of your presence! Whose 
voice, this of the leading silence? And what face portrayeth behind the veil?
Whole of essence for which my soul thirsts... My sidereal mirror from where 
the stars arose.
