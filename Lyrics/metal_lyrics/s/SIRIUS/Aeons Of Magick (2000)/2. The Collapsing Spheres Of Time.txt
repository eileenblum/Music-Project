Chaos is calling beyond the stars...
Through this silent stream I sail, towards realms to me unknown. I aim to 
swerve this starlit veil, to landscapes never shown (Never).
The stars aloft show me an escape, into ethereal worlds of bliss, where I 
can eternally, eternally dwell, lost in freedom's illusive kiss.
A dimensional portal is now open, one thousand and one nights of eclipse 
shall follow, while the shield guides of universal wisdom, bloom ablaze 
before my eyes...

After the western horizon's blood turns black, and all through the dusky 
hours, I, in my solitude, roam the far flung realms of time. In ancient 
halls with brazen censers smouldering, strange shadows dance across vaulted 
ceilings and curtains of rich velvet. And those stone chambers ring, with 
echoes of the twisted language of conjuration, lighted by the glow of 
otherworldly powers.
The splendour of an eclipse now burning, like a spring, like a spring in my 
autumn of suffering.
Like a spring in my autumn of suffering.) (Like a spring, in my autumn of 
suffering.)
Between tunnels of darkness and light, through dreams or illusions, (Between 
tunnels of darkness and light, through dreams or illusions) my this sword be 
my weapon, the infinite forest of galaxies my realm and the spectral void my 
shelter. (my shelter, forever, and the spectral void my shelter)
For between a tear and the ocean, there is only us. (There is only us.)
A dimensional portal is now open, one thousand and one nights of eclipse 
shall follow, while the shield guides of universal wisdom, bloom ablaze
