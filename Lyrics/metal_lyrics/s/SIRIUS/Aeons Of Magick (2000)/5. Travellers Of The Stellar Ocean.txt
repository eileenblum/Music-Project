Swaying in the cosmic winds, enraptured by arcane visions of endless 
stargates swathed by the origin of all.
A thousand dimensions, spreading from the ancestral void, harken as I howl 
unto the splendorous night this call:
"Sirius, mighty sothis of the ancients. Let thy fires be strengthened by the 
ones inside my skin!
Rekindle flames of the ancient magick fettered beyond my veil of humanity 
and torch the myriad galaxies that lurk so deep therein!" (That lurk so deep 
therein, that lurk so deep therein!)
Shalt ever our voices sing in unison "twixt bewildered stars, to see secrets 
of all space and time before our eyes unfold?"
Shalt my hands touch a new beginning, rising beyond its end, and soar 
throughout the multiverse, upon ethereal wings within my soul? (Within my soul?)
"Sirius, mighty sothis of the ancients. Let thy fires be strengthened by the 
ones inside my skin!
Galaxies... they are but dust in our hands. A mighty dragon I behold, whose 
bosom spawned forth time - rolled upon his fiery tongue (rolled upon his 
fiery tongue), his immortal tail does stand.
Close thine eye, oh source of power, close thine eye, and watch everything 
die. (Close thine eye, close thine eye, close thine eye, close thine eye,)
