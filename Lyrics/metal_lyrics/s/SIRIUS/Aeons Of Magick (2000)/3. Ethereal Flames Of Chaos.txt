Glowing upon the mountains, is the neon fire of chaos. Shaped in the smoke, 
strange inhuman forms. A rite of destruction, esoteric fiery storms.
Darkness lights my obscure path, floating towards the enraptured skies. 
Dwelling in the harmony of knowledge, drowning in chaos, burning in hate.
Darkness lights my obscure path, floating towards the enraptured skies. 
Dwelling in the harmony of knowledge, drowning in chaos, burning in hate.
My soul is like a vessel, sailing the endless seas of time and space.
'I am the freedom, in the web of human limits, I am the cosmic sand, falling 
down the path I once climbed.'
Darkness lights my obscure path, floating towards the enraptured skies. 
Dwelling in the harmony of knowledge, drowning in chaos, burning in hate.
'I am, the freedom, in the web, of human limits. I am, the cosmic sand, 
falling down the path I once climbed.'
A spiral of emotions, floweth through my veins, drunk with delightful chaos.
Burning inside me are the ethereal flames of chaos. (Ethereal flames of chaos)
Glowing upon the mountains, is the neon fire of chaos. Shaped in the smoke, 
strange inhuman forms. A rite of destruction, esoteric fiery storms.
