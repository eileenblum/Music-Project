Myriad arcane gateways into forbidden dimensions
Are gaping open before my eyes
From afar, I watch my soul step forth
Into the searing radiance of the mirror's other side

Engulfed in cataclysmic bursts of energy
Ephemeral nightmarish shapes permeate my consciousness
Psionic ripples in the galaxy-crested sidereal waves
Violently stir the stygian bejewelled aether

Enshrouded by billowing tides of skyfire
My spiritual mantle blown by newborn solar winds
I behold new universes in ireful bloom

Once more, as has been for countless times before,
The siren call of creative energy is answered
By the unseen magickal forces
That interweave space and time

Standing and watching, I learn of their ways...

And by touch of their powers, I have seen
Simple drifting grains of cosmic dust become
Titanic effulgent orbs of fathomless majesty,
And still rise to transcend the very boundaries
Of their newfound splendorous existence...

Such magnificent power!
