Chaos is the longest distance between two points
The further the travel, the blurrier the vision...

We envisioned development as the perfectly drawn line
Grown polarised, in the aim of equilibrium

Structured Genomes - the architecture of oniric DNA
Is but a part of the mingled essence of dimensionism
The principle of uncertainty
- A morphed perception of existence -

Random Vacuum fluctuation
A backsweep from emptiness to oneness
Zero-point energetic transcommunication

Ex-nihil
We hold the lock of Yin
And the key of Yang
Nothing is everything

- Dimensional Quantum -
Psychic surgery in spectral consciousness 
Inter-dimensional particle amidst creations,
Spontaneously combusted into the explosive
Growth of a dying universe...
