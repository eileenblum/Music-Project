Where hierarchies were found
We met the structures veiled to life.

All the grief as stone, cold as the night.
Sharpened light, bleeding the sun
In seas revolving inorganic cycles.

Eyes wide open absorb the wave of conception
And the mouth bond to lies replicates
The horror of mankind.

Transition begins.

I drain the abyss.
Forging a dying planet
With the demons in my head.

Travelling in this admirable tunnel
Words pull the trigger in vectors
Constructing reality from a third point of view.

Behold the seeds of the universe.
