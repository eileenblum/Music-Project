Innate strength
Mind and soul drift away
From a bygone marked in futile artefacts
On an inset path of blinding light...

...Existence
We set the inheritance of new death.
Outrageously we devour the elements
And drink from the spiral essence

"None are innocent.
There are only those weak enough to believe they are.
And those strong enough to revel in the 
Knowledge that they are not."
[...Jacob Strauss, Magus of the Shining Hill, London 1940]

Like black holes of enchantment...
We sombrely glitter yet consume cosmic energy
'Til you experience inorganic distress

Life as you know it has come to an end

Devoid of human flesh and blood,
The Stars are the sparkle of our eyes,
Streams of nothingness our veins, and pain...
The work of our hands.

Defy the limits of perception
Destroy the Earthly.
