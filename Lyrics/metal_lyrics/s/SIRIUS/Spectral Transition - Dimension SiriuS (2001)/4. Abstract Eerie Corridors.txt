Abstract Nexion
Echoes of reminiscence pounding inside
Silence is screaming my name
Screaming your name
Have you ever met your Demon...?

7th Portal Connection
Transformation's wormhole unveils an alien maelstrom
Beyond reckoning
A sun spreading its rays in multiple tones
And spectres emerging from chasms of light
Overwhelming hydrogenous stellar art

Deep black gateways lead to untrodden plains
Beyond the furthest nebulae
Eerie corridors into immeasurable destinations

No regret.
No looking back.
Never question.
For life was but a poetic artifice...
