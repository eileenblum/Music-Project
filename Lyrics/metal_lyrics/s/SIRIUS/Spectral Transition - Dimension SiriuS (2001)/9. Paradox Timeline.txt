Enhanced frequencies of unknown origin
Billions of effulgent blazing shells
Lurking in the nothingness of the void

We ventured through.
I exploited the Source of Self-Art
Never avoiding the fluorescent photon belt
I reunited the Alignment of ascension

Who besides me, could be
This Soul in transience, asleep in a wreath-like womb
Aesthetically static yet so revolutionary force?

May all life respond!

I remember myself as the progress of creation
Rewrite the principle of genesis as known
Non-substantial matter hits me like wildfire
I feel the surrounding siege of the Multiverse

I became the dagger
The dagger that lead myriad worlds to compulsively bleed
Reality with me fainted... was any of this ever true?
While leaving my consciousness, I forgot what I never new,
I remembered what I never was,
I remembered what never happened...
I finally know what I had always been.
