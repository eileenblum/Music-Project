Magnetic tide brought the message forth
Proclaimed illusion, I sink in these galaxies

Cold landscape
Circular abstract forms orbiting a virtual collision point
Between inverse polarised entities
A searing dead light, consuming the whole
Relentless
Crushing every atom of life
Never to be forgotten
This Cold, Cold landscape

Arcane transmissions from a distorted timestream
Strewn stars like magick drops spilled in the Ocean
The mistake was to wish for my eternity
We were the keepers, we arrived along with demise

Hologram-formed cells in eruption
Plasmic obsidian pouring out from limbo

Relentless
Crushing every atom of life
Never to be forgotten

Infinite Desolation
