I suffer in delight
The poison is mixing with my blood
A raging cyclone is coming
Onto the threatening sky of mine

Fury and longing rule my heart
When my time has come to depart
When I take my very last breath
I close my eyes and I emerge

I dare the burden of gravitation
Into cold space I venture

I watch the stones from the far distance
Beyond the threshold of earthly existence
The sting of darkness penetrates me
I'll be the cruellest shade
That dwells in your scariest dream
