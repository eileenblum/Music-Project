And I saw my death
And I killed with passion
I was out of breath
And filled with aggression
A silent cry echoing in my mind
And a handful of sand
that in the deep of my heart dwell

There are visions engraved in the maze of my brain
And a sempiternal restlessness leads my existence
Into the darkest labyrinth of life
An unbearable pain restricts me from touching the stars
I lick the waters that fall from heaven
Even so I dry

I have seen my doom
and I travelled through horrors
there's an awesome vortex
that in the deep of my heart whirls

Though tears fall from heaven
It won't soak my soul
I would rather dry forever
Than to be empoisoned by god

I've been searching for the treasures
Hidden in the tangled labyrinth
Of my innermost and supreme being

Sometimes I fell upon the earth
Yet I rise and with the strength I sweep
Into the darkest labyrinth of life
An unbearable pain restricts me from touching the stars
I lick the waters that fall from heaven
Even so I dry
