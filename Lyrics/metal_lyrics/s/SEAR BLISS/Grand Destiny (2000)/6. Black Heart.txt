Still I dream and I'll never wake again
from a dream where the cruellest phantoms dwell
I invite you to my world to enter
Where the wind blows always and night is darker

I'm everywhere. Here and out there
Crossing galaxies I travel

I have no visions and entirety draws near
Look at this liquid blackness dripping and floating
Unseen I sail the streams of ether
Waiting for the greatest storm to gather

I fell in love with darkness
With delight
With hatred

Come and taste my fury
I rise and spread the wings of my heart
Over spheres and stars
...You will fall into my slumber
