I have left my world behind
Ethereal winds tear me apart
Fallen angels wanting my bleeding heart
Ghastly shadows I belong to your kind

I fill the universe
With black cosmic sadness
Come to drink
from these galactic fountains

I watch the stars' aura
I feed my lake of fire
I'm lonesome and forgotten
Heading to the endless seas of oblivion
