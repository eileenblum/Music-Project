Beyond the utter darkness
In the blackest night
Where noctiflorous flowers bloom
We breathe the autumn air

The night sky seems so pure
When we wonder in the winter cold
We are but shadows
Smelling the breeze of forests

Perhaps the vision is over
And the fog ascended
Walking towards the sky with desire
I'm disappearing in the distance, far away

When I find no words
And I loose my breath
Then I find out that
All finite things reveal infinitude

When the secrets are destroyed
And nothing left but void
I will see you in the night
Dressed in silver moonlight
