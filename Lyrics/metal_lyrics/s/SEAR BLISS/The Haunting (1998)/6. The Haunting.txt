[lyrics by Janos Barbarics]

Your memories torture you with pain
They hurt you, don't they?
Spasm of pain, are you sweating?
They don't leave you alone
with the loneliness of your mind.
Who is that? Who does speak?
You could embrace with one movement
but it fades...it has gone!
Your brain, in front of your body.
Do you feel your consciousness in your hand,
and the similarity with one movement?
It has come back! It speaks!
Everything is moving again!
Are you growing weaker?
Its face has been satanic!!!
But the Dreamsoul strikes down
Disappeared!!
Your living wraith.
The world ebbs, abates, calms down
What's going on?
You seem tired and confused
but tomorrow is already near!!!!

What is this silence?
You will never know...
What tries to stay in silencearics...
