[lyrics by Laszlo Fodor]

Centuries pass slowly
I'm looking at the appearing memories in silence
There is no existence, only the neverending flotation
In the sempiternal dark of cosmos

The path has come to an end
I've broken free from the earthly bound of my body
That was a heavy stone on my soul

I'm travelling in space
I'm lonesome but not alone
The stars are my companions
They call me with their icecold brightness

But they are far away from me and I'm suffering
The permanent coldness shackles me
Another dimension of existence it is
As I am left by myself in the dark
