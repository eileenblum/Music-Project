[lyrics by Attila Halasz]

Snow falls into her open coffin
I'm looking at her frozen face
someone has painted a smile
on the face of death.
Unprepared to her sudden exit
the fast arrows of my imagination
are flying through the air,
Confused in this madness of the flesh
I feel I've been tricked.
Who holds the answer to this?
Sweeping rain of tears pounds the earth
and echoing cries reach the universe
Misery descending on my days
I'll pay whatever price
I have to pay.
Go now, get prepared 
so you will be able to understand 
this internal hell
