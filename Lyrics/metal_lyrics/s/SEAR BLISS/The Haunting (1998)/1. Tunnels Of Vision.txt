[lyrics by Attila Halasz]

I hear the languages of south
as a dark angel accepts me
under her wings,
with dry skin and soft eyes
I head into oblivion
through this tunnel of light.
My heart appears new and unaccessible
in divine blood.
I lived without victory until now
but right here in the milky light
among monsters I thrive.
I'm dying in joy.
It's pure violence in my mind
when I take account of the past
I am handsome in my death, really beautiful
soothed by my departing soul.
Shifting away I don't care
as it is no longer mine.
I have a vision and now
I step on to the bridge to learn
the horrendous wisdom of life.
