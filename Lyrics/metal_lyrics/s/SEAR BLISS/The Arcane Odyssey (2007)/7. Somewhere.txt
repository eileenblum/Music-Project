The arcane path we walk
Our consciousness is clear and our heart is cold
Through the valley of shadows
A journey that lasts a lifetime
The memories of yesterdays with us on this lonely road
In between shackles and deadly traps
Would you sacrifice your soul?
Striving and fighting till death
We are the legion of the damned
These wounds will heal in our soul
Through nightmarish visions
Our hearts are filled with blackest woe
Stormclouds gather wherever both we roam
Youâll never know when this journey ends
Or if it will ever end at all
The seeds of joy planted into barren soil
Sorrow embrace  both of us anywhere we go
