Welcome to my dreams
A fragile place with fragile thrills
Shadow that hide
In the loneliest part of my mind
A spirit lost and found
In the forest of eternal entirety
Rise of an untamed soul
The fire that burns within
Gives me the will to live
But the shreds of past haunt me still
Like blackest clouds they cover me
There is no place to hide from myself
I feel lost, Iâm cursed
The blood slowing down in my veins
Whenever I look back I see nothing but hate
Whatever I try to hide or pretend
Iâll always be who I am
Gaze into my eyes, what you see is a shadow in the blackest forest
Someone who fears to touch the light
