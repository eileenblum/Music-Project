Path to the divine ground
Where sacred blood flowed to feed the soil
And the flowers of glory blossomed
Though our path is full of tragedies and obstacles
The roots are deep beneath the ground
Carry on the heritage of our forefathers
And follow the path to the motherland
Path to divine ground
Where sacred blood flowed to feed the soil
Torches sine in the dark
Our sword is drawn
In our soul and our arrow we trust
We march through the nightsky
Our hearts filled with joy and pride
Our anger will strike down from above
To help our brothers and fight by their side
To find a way to your soul
Is to find the path to the motherland
Torches sine in the dark
Our sword is drawn
On our soul and our arrow we trust
