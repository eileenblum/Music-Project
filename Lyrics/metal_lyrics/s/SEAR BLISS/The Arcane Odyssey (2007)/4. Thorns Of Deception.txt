I saw it with my mindâs eye
And sensed the growing serenity
The divine order of a higher being
Procreation of an unknown breed
A menace in disguise
A dagger behind symphatyâs back
Welcome to fools paradise
The snake coiling around your neck
I see a future that is black and white
Thorns of my skin restricts me to find
My peace of mind
The birth of something new and sinister
Wrapped in deceptionâs cloth
On the fields of glamour
Our feet will not tread
In a senseless peace of mind
Eliminated we are from the circle of happiness and delight
These words repeating in my head again and again
Sometimes love is the key that unlocks hate
A merace in disguise
A dagger behind sympathyâs back
Welcome to fools paradise
The snake coiling around your neck
I see a future that is black and white
Thorns on your skin restricts me to find
The calm in you
