Locked inside the serpentâs den
We are depraved and possessed
By a temptation we canât explain
The venomous grace flowing through our veins
Everything we see cannot be real
The infinite flow of tears, an ocean of sorrow
Emotions departed
You are deceived by some illfated vision
Which cannot be erased from your brain
Behold the flames arising
Let the beast control your body
Let the poison work in your veins
Infinite lust and hunger I feel
The earth will crumble
When I oppress what should be released
A wondering soul
Never finds its home in this world
Never finds rest in this slumber
Behold the flames arising
Let the beast control your body
Everything we see vannot be real
The infinite flow of tears, an ocean of sorrow
Emotions departed
You are deceived by some illfated vision
Which cannot be erased from your brain
