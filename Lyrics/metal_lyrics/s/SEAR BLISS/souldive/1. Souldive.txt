Close your eyes
Start to dive into your thoughts to understand the secret
Drink from fountain of wisdom
And feel the energy
That surrounds everything - both material and living being

Where you can't feel the frequency of the gravitational waves
Tiny is the drawing to the center
Where we are a drop in the ocean
A fine piece of sand
In the desert -

Fools are those who believe in God
Fools are those who put themselves above all
It is time to explore the relation between inner self and the cosmos

We are part of the universe
Which surrounds us
Few know that in each of us a cosmos dwells
And that there's an almighty:
The infinite power and source of energy
