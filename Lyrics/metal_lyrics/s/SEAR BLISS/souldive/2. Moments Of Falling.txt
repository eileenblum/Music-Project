The spell has broken
I can't see the face of silence anymore
And the force of wind suffocates me
I need all my power
To struggle forever 

I've fought many battles
My hair is stained with blood
And in the dark the blade of my sword shines
I know now how the wind blows the infirm ones away 

I stayed here, yet not alone
The Eagle leads on me
As if I knew him since the days of old
My only companion 

I feel now as a warm wind calls and caresses
into the deep
We dive
Sweep between walls of flame
Roam through the darkness of dangerous fields

I entered a marble room
And spreadlegged angels laid before me
(I've fought many battles
My hair is stained with blood
And in the dark the blade of my sword shines)
