Still I feel lost 
In this chaotic world of hypocrisy 
The memories still haunting me 
And the voices echoing between 
The grey walls of my mind 
With a bleak smile on my face I feast 
As I still mourn the past 
I watch as the naked leaves fall 
And rigid branches crackle under my feet 

I will return to the peace I so long forgot 

Regression and progression are the same 
In this state of suspended animation 
Heartless I lie on the coldest ground 

...Night is too bright for me 

I learnt much of the lies 
I have seen witches burning on stakes 
I will never smell the fresh air again 
My vision is blurred with fine hoarfrost 

The horrendous truth 
It blurred my vision 
I glance (at you) with empty eyes 

As I vanish into thick fog 
I realize that 
Night is too bright for me...
