Threatening clouds darken my sky 
The air is filled with infernal heat 
Wicked flames are longing to taste 
Her witching body 
Ghastly voices echo in the dusk 
Faceless demons waiting for their feast to come 
When the dark sky is about to open 

Despair and horror everywhere 
The terrific visions became reality 
There's no way to escape 
It is the utter end 

Memories fade away 
Like when mountain disappear 
In thick haze 

Despair and horror everywhere 
The time has come to understand 
The lethal wisdom of hell 

The angry flames like hungry wolves bite the flesh 
They're licking her with ecstatic lust 
Time passes slowly when she is devoured by fire 

Only fine ashes you leave 
But your spirit unseen flies away 

Time and space do no more restrain 
You step out on the way of stars again 
Step out on the way of stars again...
