A battle cry for the very last time 
My enemies must all face me and die 
The circle of fire will consume them 
I will point the bone and release the magic 

Prepare to fight and lose it all this time 
We are standing in the circle of fire 
Destiny brought on and will end this war forever 

I will look you in the eye 
Break your will and destroy your weapons 
I will bury you under earth and ice 

Fire brought heroic inspiration to fight 
Unmarked graves will hold our enemies forever. 

Demonic fear squeezes hearts 
We bring darkness and weaken the soul 
But the face of death 
Advances on me 
Steel or armour 
No longer protect me 

But no fear in me as we clash!
