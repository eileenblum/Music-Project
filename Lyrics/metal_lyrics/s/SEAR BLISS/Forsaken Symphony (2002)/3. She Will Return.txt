Through the night 
Dreams elude me 
Wide eyed, alert and sane 
I stare into the heart of darkness 
Waiting, inhaling 
Exhaling, dying 

She will return to me 

I live colourless days 
The sky lightless and pale 
I envy the living 
The star-crossed lovers 
Of hope and life 

Waiting, inhaling 
Exhaling, dying 

She will return to me 

Lying here motionless 
My eyes wide open 
With a torn and naked heart 
I long through the threshold of pain 

I left open the gates of hate 
Allowed emptiness to come in 
Desperation weigh me down 
Falling like an angel...
