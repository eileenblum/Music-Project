Am I ruling in hell? 
Or is it just a dream so cruel 
I have taken the hands 
Of the most magnificent doom 
Blindly I'm seeking for the wisdom of truth 
With persistence untold 
I'm standing in a lake of warm blood 
Yet my visions are cold 
I see cliffs and peaks licking the sky 
And deep cold lakes 
With the universe their bottoms unite 
Cosmic forces gave me the strength 
To take my journey 
And to be one with the stars 

I was a demonfaced man 
But now I'm a manfaced demon 
Look at me and this face 
Bathed in the silvery moonlight 

I admire the splendour 
But it's getting pale as I leave it behind 
Now the sparking stars are the only light 
But their shining still as cold as ice 

I died a thousand times 
Yet I believe in thanatism 
So I avoid the realms of bliss 
In the search of utter end 

May the darkest space be my tomb 
And may my blood paint the stars 
Lifeless I drift far 
But I reborn in the shape of emptiness
