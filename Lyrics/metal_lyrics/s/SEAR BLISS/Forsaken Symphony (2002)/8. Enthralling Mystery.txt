Between two worlds 
Here I'm standing in a shower of arrows 
Watching as my spirit departs 
As though I walked the path of inferno 
(You can) Take my soul, take my life 
My spirit with the cosmos unites 
I feel the blackness devouring me 
I see my destiny clearly 

I remained all alone 
With my odium unfathomable 
I soar high on the stellar vault 
Towards a mystic vortex I flee 
Where I'll be engulfed 
By the most sombre gloom I've ever seen 

I'm bleeding from a thousand wounds 
I cannot hide, I will look you in the eye 

My lood gushing forth 
The time has come to the last sacrifice 

Storm of blood, storm of wrath 
There are things no one could understand 
I'm facing demons surrounding me 
They eat my flesh, eat my soul 
I'll be one with them 

I see planets with stars collide 
The immensity of its power enthralling me 

My path has come to an end 
Future holds nothing for me 
I've seen everything I had to see 
I've been everywhere I had to be
