On the battlefield 
The carnage is done 
Heroes, broken and dead 
Lying in the mud 
But I look up to the sky 
Ready not to die 

The sky above me is gray 
My blade is drawn 

It's getting dark 
I see the shades of my enemies 
They gather by the thousands 
Darkness encircles us all 

My sword is drawn 
For the very last time 
They're sharpening their claws 
Screams and thunder 

Their claws ripping my flesh 
It is the greatest day 
As I won't retreat or surrender 

My body falls to the ground 
Their teeth tear my flesh 
Eyes, burning with madness 
Teeth bloody, I've heard 
The crunching of my bones 
I die! 

Enshrouded in fog I'm marching 
With great warriors of past 

Among the slain I wander 
I look up to the sky 
Filled with stars 
I became one with them
