I beheld an awful sight 
With abysmal woe in my heart 
Into blackest mystery I dive 
Among fools and in despair I lived my life 
Now I'm longing for the time to come to depart 

The years rolled away 
Now my days are numbered 
The hours vanishing away 
Soon I will visit that place below 

Among the living I have nothing more to experience 
With profane rites I enhance my longing and willing 
Gates are opening in the gathering darkness 
I leave this mortal coil to enter the endless depths 

I behold a grim sight 
Forgetting the taste of pain in my mind 

Everything came to an end 
All I hate in this world is over 
No more lands, religions, kings and boundaries 
The battle is for eternity now! 

No more years, neither days nor hours 
Time has lost its meaning
