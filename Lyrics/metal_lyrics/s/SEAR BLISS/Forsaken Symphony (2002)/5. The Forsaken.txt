...In the coldest chamber 
Of my mind 
A place 
Which never saw 
The beams of light 
Never felt the touch of Sun 
I am aware what dwells within 
I faced the impossible 
Thus an eidolon I became 
Transfixed with the blade of immortality 

I am inaccessible 
Roaming upon aeons 
Holding the secrets of ages 
And the ageless wisdom of eternity 

I take a look at the past 
All I feel is bitterness 
Emptiness surrounding me 
Is this grand destiny?
