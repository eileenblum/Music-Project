My body is split open
At dawning of pain.
Come, step inside and dream on.
Beautiful suffering it is
On the other side of an other dimension.

"With dead bodies we hug each other
I touch you with my ice cold fingers."

Do you feel it?

"We dance together, on the horizon
Of eternal sadness,"

Winter veil covers us.

"Wake up, on the day of your funeral
Praise the Lord"

For this beautiful night.
