Feel the cold embrace of despair
In the land of the phantoms
Be prepared, for you will taste
The cold sweat of fear
This is what you will feel

My tears mixed with rain
My blood became cold
My soul in sulphur lake

I saw as the sun broke to shatters
Since then the coldest winter dwells in me
I will be here until eternity ends
For I've seen the future
And I've seen the past

But I broke the hourglass of tomorrow
And time will lost its meaning

My tears mixed with rain
My blood became cold
My soul in sulphur lake
