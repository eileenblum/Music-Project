There's a feeling that weakens me
Sucking my blood
Like thousands of leeches on my skin

There's something that keeps me sleepless
It draws me in deeper and deeper
Like black holes devour the stars

There are memories I find myself
Imprisoned in earthly flesh
But the ground will be shaking
When I unleash my wrath

I have been at the birth of time
I have seen rainbows made of methane
Galaxies were my playground
And the universe will be my grave

I sank into the waters
Of grotesque
I must drink from the fountain of wisdom
For I want to roam

The unfathomed depths of the universe
Where stars are born and die
And the aeons seem only to a moment
A tiny fragment of endless time

But now I stepped through
The threshold of fear
My heart is filled with joy
I laugh upon the mortals
For they can't explore

The unfathomed depths of the universe
Where stars are born and die
And the aeons seem only to a moment
A tiny fragment of endless time

I have been at the birth of time
I have seen rainbows made of methane
Metagalaxies were my playground
And the multiverse will be my grave

Nothing weakens me anymore
It is unearthly tranquility I found
And now I cross the river of no return
