My will has woken
Feel the eruption
Of all that seethe within
This is the beginning of the neverending restlessness

Rise!

Among pyramids made of ice
And icicles of sand
Crossing the orbits of dangerous planets I flee

My soul is broken
Feel the eruption
Of all that seethe within
This is the beginning of neverending restlessness
My life it and elegy unwritten

I sculpt you like the clay of time
Like crystal snowflakes dress the naked land
After an enormous avalanche
I lay there buried

Be prepared to be the next victim

Fall!

And now I realized you are a spectre in my dreams
