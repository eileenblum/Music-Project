Enter my dreams and you will see what truly hides behind my mask
Believe me I am bleeding from a thousand wounds

I often feel I'm banished
This world is not for me
For a long time I found out
How to communicate with stars
For they are my only companions

On the edge of an unknown existence I am staggering
Look into my eyes and you'll know what I'm yearning for

I celebrate the funeral of my emotions
Will this nightly journey ever end?
My scars are deeper than you'd think
And even if I die now, my shadow will haunt you

Forever!
