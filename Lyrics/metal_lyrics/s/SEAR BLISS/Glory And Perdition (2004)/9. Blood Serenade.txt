The walls you built surround me
I'm lost in the labyrinth of my dreams
In the hollowness of despair
Where my memories are dead

I'm in the chains of temptation
Of the darkside
Free me from the emotion of mortals

I'm mesmerized by the bleakness of the moonscape

Among the trees I feel
This sinister breeze
And I see that blinding glitter
In the dark
The walls you built surround me
I'm lost in the labyrinth of immortality
In the hollowness of despair
Where my memories are dead

I'm in the chains of temptation
Of the darkside
Free me from the emotion of mortals

I dream of the dawn of a new world
I dream of the dawn of a new age

If I could see with my eyes
You would be carried by the wings of demise

Without role on the stage of life I play
But I will wait for another thousand years
And until the end of time

My clearest vision of you
Is a blurred mosaic
Where the pieces are blended
And I'm confused
