I'm in the claws of darkness
The sky above me is bloodred
I welcome you to my place
Where I dwell
In the palace of loneliness
At the shore of forbidding illusions

I am the planet and you're my moon
I need you
To glorify perdition

Until the grave I'm fighting
I try to look into your mind
In the flickering light of a lone candle
I summon thee

I rebel against the things they do
I never let them take my throne

I am the planet and you're my moon
I need you
To glorify perdition

I'm bewitched by your splendour
Time has come to the final sacrifice
And in this very moment
I summon thee
