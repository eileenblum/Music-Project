Try not to scream,
Deep down here there's no one will hear.
Try not to breath,
Deep down there there's no one believe.
Don't you ever dare to tell anyone when you hear me and finally see him!
Don't you ever dare to look around to ensure everyone.
Keep being normal without any horrendous deal.
All of these are formed as little crumbs which only existed in some pixels.
You're just not deep yet to see this like forcing a mortal to annihilate the seven seas.
Somehow, it will be delayed.
You'll be muted, remained unspoken and being abolished when he appears.
Keep that silent, heed me while burying your pulse.
Further heeding leads to your visual woes of bottommost.
