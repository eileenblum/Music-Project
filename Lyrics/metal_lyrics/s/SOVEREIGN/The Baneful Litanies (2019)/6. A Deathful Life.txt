Wake up to the view of the sorrow and grieve
Feeling's crumbling as the clock's ticking fast.
The man inside your head starts whispering regarding the truth, you've been avoiding.
Wake up son, there's no one else beside you
No one else to count on but it's only you
If there's any one said life is a merely lie.
Those are the one you should never say good bye.
For the sake of your own self, this I tell you!
You are barely living, as you're living a deathful life.
You might say that a living, but for me it's just a deathful life.
When will you realize?
There is no one else to save, pacify, not even to hold your hands
Solemnly in the dark you realize
Life is a comforting lie whilst death is a painful truth
Don't let life drives you straight out to nowhere
And leaves you unprepared.
For truth shall come,
I hope you understand
The end of life starts since the second you were born
Just starts searching for the meaning
Why you were born?
Why do you live?
Why do you even exist?
