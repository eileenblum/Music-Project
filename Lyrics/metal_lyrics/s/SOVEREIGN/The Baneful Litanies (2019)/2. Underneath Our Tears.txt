Run, run.
Underneath our tears.
One of the Men Who Laughs wants to watch the world burn.
And all of us are on his demand.
Behind the curtain they put a poison in a cup of tea.
To wash our brain and then slay thee.
Appears like an angel, then leaving the unsolved story tangled.
He makes conversation ain't for communication but to start conspiracy.
He can turn pig smell as well as a fairy tale.
Underneath our tears.
In a single smile, they can turn your vein in pain.
Then all of us are on His demand.
Behind the curtain, they'll turn your head upside down within a vow.
To wash their feet and then pray with it.
He killed, he crippled, and tortured or murdered countless people
All just for a laughter
