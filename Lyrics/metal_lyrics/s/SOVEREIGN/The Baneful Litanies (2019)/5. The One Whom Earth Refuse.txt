And as the earth starts to spit out the heat.
He will be near somehow.
Watching disasters and laughing on it.
As the birds start not to fly on the sky.
He will be near somehow.
Provokes people to be behind his lead.
The one whom earth refuse.
Rush, blood.
There's no one sees him in the crowd.
Not a human, nor a creature.
His hands are fulfilled by the blood.
Wreck and ash, people down.
Keep your eyes open in the crowd.
Don't give him any chance.
Tears drop from your eyes.
And the sorrows start to leave.
He comes from the dark.
Sings the song of the hell.
From the distance, he takes
Behemoth with him.
Sings the song of hell.
He abolishes all he sees.
No one will leave, and no one will survive
And in the end, you realize those all
You are already late, you're in the time when the world meets the end.
