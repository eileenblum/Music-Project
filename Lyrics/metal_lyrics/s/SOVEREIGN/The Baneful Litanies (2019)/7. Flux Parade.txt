[feat. unbound]Good morning our humble citizens.
We would love to remind you that we have confined your humanity in another kind of dystopian space.
So sit back, stay still, reproduce, grab a coffee while you file those file to another file.
So sit back stay asleep be entertained pick a fight when you lost on searching what loose.
On flux parade everyone's decapitated.
Embrace what you hate, colonized by those whom so called saint.
On flux parade none of us are safe, none of us are free from this dystopia.

Dekap rindu nafsumu
Senyap ini penuh luka.
Semerbak wangi surga
Anyir penuh darah.
Sampaikan berita
Semua akan musnah.
Bentuk perang masa depan.
Teror dan kematian.
Sematkan hormat di dalam jasad.
Hidup singkat dan terlaknat di hadapan umat.

Good day sir,
Dear humble citizens we would proudly announce that your reality has been constructed, restructured day by day by your artificial god, by our artificial god, by their artificial god.
Your acceptance, our acceptance regards religion helps us construct superstructure you won't comprehend.
Thus we hope you enjoy this flux parade while you fight each other, and we fight each other and make you fight each other too
