Wreathe scorched horizons, there beggars pray 
Usurpers of tomorrow feast on faith 
Irrelevant time, when beasts breed decay 
Proprietors of ancient times resurrect the waste 

Coerce the fires, beset the light, guide Colossi to his throne 
Coerce the liars, beset the night, guide the chosen to their home 

Fire scoured as wings of damnation 
Cowards fall to their knees 
In judgment they kneel and they pray 
Enlightened they beg and they slave
