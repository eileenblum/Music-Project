Count your blessings, gold is only stone in a prize-less world
It has always been that, knowledge is triumph over diluted minds
It will always be that, flesh is power
Exist through instinct live through the black beast inside
Mindful of commoners blind mindful of holy swine
Emerge, iconoclast of time emerge the cynic, the divine

Revel in truth indulge in its wisdom
Denounce the singular faiths they who devour God
Patriarch of ruin melodist of calamity
Conqueror of thrones majesty of hollowed lands they who devour god
I the beast, I the chosen flesh
