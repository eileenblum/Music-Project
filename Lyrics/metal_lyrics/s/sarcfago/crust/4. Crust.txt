Scars and wounds burnin' the flesh
All the pain came at last...
Your brain now is raped
You will eternally suffer
The hands of doom point your way

Fear, fear, fear... of death!

Scars and wounds burnin' the flesh
All the pain came at last...
Your brain now is raped
You will eternally suffer
Crust, crust, crust.

Thanks to helregni for correcting track #3 lyrics.
