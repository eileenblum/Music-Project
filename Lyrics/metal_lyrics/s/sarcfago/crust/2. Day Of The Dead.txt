When the dark and light collide
We know that we'll meet our doom
From this point there's no return
Final revelation... freezing our soul

... Now we feel the pain
(In the) day of the dead!!! [x2]

Feel the death mutilation
It's our final bleeding
We'll never return... never scape from her
It's time to rot, time to rot

Laments in the coffin
Will never be heard...
Will we find peace?
(In the) day of the dead...
