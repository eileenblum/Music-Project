If you're in despise like I
Enter this rage cage
And cleanse out all of your demise
A sin for the sinners
A trophy for the winners.

Erestemated time
Of all the hatred inside
Is now, cause we're all
In the same crowd
I hail to the insane
And I embrace this day
Let's show all of these fuckers
Who's going to pay
Enter this oblivion.

The dices shows an unknown number
While laying there on the floor
Regardless the outcome
This cage is just for the scum.

Enter the oblivion a manifest of anger
The tension house the worst place by far.

The dices shows an unknown number
While laying there on the floor
Regardless the outcome
This cage is just for the scum.
