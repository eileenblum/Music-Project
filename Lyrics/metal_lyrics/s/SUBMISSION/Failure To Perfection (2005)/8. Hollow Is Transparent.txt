Inject the salvation
Into my own neck
Watch it transform
See the gloss of the new and reborn
Try to stop this tirade.

I'm forced to live with the regrets
The lies, doubt and everything
Disturbed it all might seem
Disoriented, the way I feel
I can't reach I'm lacking beind
Everything and anyone has left my side
I take no pride in this.

Silence, screams the air
We overcome and disappear
Hollow is transparent
Awake, but still in a dream.

Inject the salvation into my neck
See the gloss of the new and reborn
Try to stop this tirade while I sing my serenade.

I'm forced to live with the regrets
The lies, doubt and everything
Disturbed it all might seem
Disoriented, the way I feel
I can't reach I'm lacking beind
Everything has left my side
I can't reach I'm lacking beind
Everything and anyone, has left my side
I take no pride in this.

Silence, screams the air
We overcome  and disappear
Hollow is transparent
Awake, but still in a dream.

Still in a dream
Still in a dream.
