Reset this world
Reinstate some sanity
Reject-ignite-burn
Control-delete-return
Society's slumber, weaves the neglect
Dishonorable discharge
To any reject
The pillars of this system
Shall crumble and yearn
I reject, I ignite, I burn.

System failure to perfection
Slaves to our weakness
On the outside a blessing
Inside a sickness.

System failure to perfection
Slaves to our weakness
On the outside a blessing

Controlled existence
Living in a machine
Lack of spine, dying in a dream
Drowning in denial
Floating dead down stream.
