Just look around, long enough
And the answer you'll see
Close, so close the
Killer will be.

The clues aren't always what they seem
Hidden and well kept for all
Eternity.

Resting are these bodies deep within
Irreversible are all my sins
Pointblack, that you might fear
Pointblack, that the ending is near
Evasive I'm not trying to be
Reach out and touch me.

Examinations for two hundred years
Questions still asked, but they are never clear
Unassisted through all of my crimes
All done with the edge of a knife
Last supper was that they got
Spay all of those sluts.

Misanthrope I am
Evidence is in your hand.
