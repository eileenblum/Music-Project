You disgust me
With all of your fucked up games
And each time I look at you
All I see is disgrace
You're playing with people
Like they where toys
Is the only fucking reason
Of the hatred in my voice
No regrets of witnessing your fail.

I was at first
Fooled by your pretty disguise
Impressed by the thrills
That you made me feel
But I was soon to find out
You are all the same
You were only in it, for the kill.

Twice as much pain
Will hit yourself
I'm standing on the side
While I'm witnessing your downfall
Your downfall.

As my eyes are darkened
So is my love for you
Like the pain in my heart
As it's been from the start
You will never win.

You still think you're number one
And all your playing went well
Remember the curse twice as much pain
It will only hit, hit yourself
Twice as much pain will hit yourself
I'm standing on the side
While I'm witnessing you
Cause I know, hate
Is the way I was breed
And the way I was send to the throne
Cause of the pain that I bring
And I know its today
That I send off all my sins
And I throw them all away
Your downfall.

As my eyes are darkened
So is my love for you
Like the pain in my heart
As it's been from the start
You will never win.
