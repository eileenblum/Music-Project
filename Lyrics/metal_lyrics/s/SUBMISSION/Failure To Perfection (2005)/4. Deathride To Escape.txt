Greetings to all in hell
You all do it well
As the mark on the map
Where we're all getting trapped
They all live aside as if it was suicide
As they decide to live on the deathride
Deathride to escape.

Surely hell is better than heaven
Cause everyone goes down under
No one is perfect, no one is good
They all think they're in heaven soon
As they decide to live on the deathride.

I know for sure that I'll make it to hell
Cause I know what kind of person I've been
Others believe in heaven, you're blind
You're stuck, no wonder
Your life is fucked.

Greetings to all in hell
You still do it well
Making the rules of this world
As people are getting curled
Greetings to all in hell
You all do it well
As the mark on the map
Where we're all getting trapped.

I know for sure that I'll make to hell
Cause I know what kind of person I've been
Others believe in heaven your faith
Deathride to escape.

Deathride to escape
Deathride to escape.
