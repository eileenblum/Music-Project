Lack of faith
And the hours are getting near
Simultaneous beating myself
Back and forth do I care
My presence seems more and more unclear
Lack of faith do I care
My presence seems unclear.

To stand up again
Well my friend, that I've tried
Want to know how it went
Like withering heights
But it makes complete sense
That I one more time
Should be inflicted by destiny's revenge
That I one more time
Should be inflicted by destiny's revenge

One less thing to care about
One less soul in denial
Keep in mind that everyone
Someday shall serve their time
So my love, look out for the signs
Cause the reaper is out tonight
And he's walking the green mile.

Electrical waves
Are passing through my mind
And I'm burning the images of my own crimes
The end of the tunnel is turning gray
Still I have nothing left to say.

Condemned cell, I'm carving days on the wall
Condemnation, this is the end of your fall.

Lack of faith
And the hours are getting near
Simultaneous beating myself
Back and forth do I care
My presence seems more and more unclear

Electrical waves
Are passing through my mind
And I'm burning the images of my own crimes
The end of the tunnel is turning gray
Still I have nothing left to say.
