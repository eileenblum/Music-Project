Why live among anger
Hunger, violence and sick bastards
Who is to blame for this world
That should be so beautiful.

Corruption, dictators and shit
The people has to suffer by it
Powerful wolverine men
As any president.

Forced to be a soldier
Fighting against equal men
Only because of the rights and wrongs
Tell me the meaning with war
Does peace follow along
Hate is just growing bigger
Each the we pull the trigger.

Warhunger
Man is the smartest creature so far
Why don't we think
Instead of var
Questions are asked but never answered
God's making of mankind
Is a cancer.

Why live among anger
Hunger, violence and sick bastards
Who is to blame for this world
That should be so beautiful
Forced to be a soldier
Fighting against equal men
Only because of the rights and wrongs
Tell me the meaning with war
Does peace follow along
Hate is just growing bigger
Each time we pull the trigger.

Do they think that war brings us hope
While all their soldiers are hooked on dope
And what about the election of the new pope
I'd rather see him by the end of a rope.
