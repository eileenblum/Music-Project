Glasslike eyes
I'm looking from beyond
Introspective what have I done
My life is exposed, now what should I do
When opportunity, is the words
I just can't see through.

I'm not searching for all the answers
Just a guide to lead the way
Cause it's getting harder and harder
To avoid this judgment day.

Where do I start, and when does it end
Depression sets in
Departure is set for all lost soul
The last humane element
Has now left us all.

I'm not searching for all the answers
Just a guide to lead the way
Cause it's getting harder and harder
To avoid this judgment day.

Raised fist I'm repulsed
As I object to my anger burst
Psychical pain no longer hurts
Realistic images you are my worst
Raised fist to all the scum on the earth
As I object to my anger burst.

I'm not searching for all the answers
Just a guide to lead the way
Cause it's getting harder and harder
To avoid this judgment day.
