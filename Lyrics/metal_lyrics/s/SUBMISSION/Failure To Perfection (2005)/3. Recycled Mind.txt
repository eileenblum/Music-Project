In every way, every day
I'm filled with all your shit,
That I can't corporate with
My wrath is reversing towards you
Cause of your constant pressure
And telling me what to do.

You talk and talk
But my mind is shut
You try and try
Why won't you just die
Your lies, your lies
Recycles my mind.

Didn't you see it coming
Or were you too busy,
With all your fucking problems
Cut the picture
So it fits the frame
I have only feelings left
Of a crying game.

You talk and talk
But my mind is shut
You try and try
Why won't you just die
Your lies, your lies
Recycles my mind.

Didn't you see it coming
Or were you too busy,
With all your fucking problems
You talk and talk but my mind is shut
Recycles my mind
