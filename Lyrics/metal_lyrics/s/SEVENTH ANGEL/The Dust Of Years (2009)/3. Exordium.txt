Here at the beginning
Betrothed to one another
Ravaged by the beauty
The euphony of whispers

Here at The Unveiling
Antiquity of empires
Jaded by affliction
We wake to see the dawn

We thirst, turn us not away
In tears, the taste of you remains

In the beginning, at the end of all things
I am
In the beginning, at the end of all things
I am suffering

I am broken
Cast me not away from you
Forgotten
Wake me from this sleep of death

Your heart reveals my pain
Your heart reveals my pain

Here at The Unveiling
Antiquity of empires
Jaded by affliction
We wake to see the dawn
