Did you leave me here all alone?
Crown my head with tears, love unknown
Climb these narrow stairs, walk with me
We shall cast our cares into the sea

Break the chains that seek to bind us
Speak the Word to free us all
Break the chains that seek to bind us
Speak the Word to free us all

Brittle hands that long to hold
Guard my flesh in bitter cold
We abide beneath this veil
Will we ever be?

Sun and moon and stars hide away
Blood pour, spirit wound, Agnus Dei
If I lose my way, mourn my birth
If we are but clay, lament the earth

Brittle hands that long to hold
Guard my flesh in bitter cold
Fractured limbs that try to heal
Will we ever be?

Sun and moon and stars hide away
Blood pour, spirit wound, Agnus Dei
If I lose my way, mourn my birth
If we are but clay, lament the earth

Twilight embraces this world
Languid, bejeweled so frail
Autumn, daughter of spring
Farewell fainthearted one

Laughter, transient sleep
Hallowed, shining of fire

Treasure candlelight dear
Night falls, heaven draws near

Laughter, transient sleep
Hallowed, shining of fire

Did you leave me here all alone?
Crown my head with tears, love unknown
Climb these narrow stairs, walk with me
We shall cast our cares into the sea

Break the chains that seek to bind us
Speak the Word to free us all
Break the chains that seek to bind us
Speak the Word to free us all
