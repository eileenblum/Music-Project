I have seen the shadows
Falling on the fields
Endless march of progress
Endless march of greed

In the midst of turmoil
Frozen still or running scared
From the hands of chaos
Tearing down the world we shared
(Lost in moments, lost forever)

Did you see a world
Endless, vast and free?
Was it ever real?
Can it ever be?

In the midst of turmoil
Frozen still or running scared
From the hands of chaos
Tearing down the world we shared

Close your eyes and dream
Of things that were not as they seemed
Again the time has come to learn
That nothing lasts
[2x]

In the midst of turmoil
Frozen still or running scared
From the hands of chaos
Tearing down the world we shared
Lost in moments, lost forever
