This blood flows thick with the dust of years
This vain catharsis of bitter tears
This inner sanctum of human hands
Can't give me shelter, it will not stand

Velvet walls conceal the crown of thorns from me
Rise, faint heart and lift your eyes to see the light has come

This burden carried, too great to bear
This flesh decaying borne of despair
This cruel affliction: the raven sky
Bring me salvation or watch me die

Velvet walls conceal the crown of thorns from me
Rise, faint heart and lift your eyes to see the light has come

[2x]
Quell the river's flow, bury me below
Take this cup from me, filled with memories
Can this life be saved from the silent grave?
Tear the raven sky, bring light to these eyes

Quell the river's flow, bury me below
all that once I desired
Take this cup from me, filled with memories
reaching out from the fire 
Can this life be saved from the silent grave
yearning for me to come to the end?
Tear the raven sky, bring light to these eyes
Searching for a way out of this hell

This blood flows thick with the dust of years
This vain catharsis of bitter tears
This cruel affliction: the raven sky
Bring me salvation or watch me die

[2x]
Velvet walls conceal the crown of thorns from me
Rise, faint heart and lift your eyes to see the light has come
