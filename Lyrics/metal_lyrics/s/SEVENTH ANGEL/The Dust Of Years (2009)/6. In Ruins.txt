Dwelling in ruins
Swallowing poison
Carving out wounds on the hands that held you
Spitting hate on the fools who cared

Have they broken you?

There is no reason
to live in this prison
Proudly display all your chains and your tears
Run away when the pain tears your life apart

Abusing and cursing - you are betrayed
Blame is never on your shoulders
Always pulling further away
All that could have been - so distant

Entering again and again
into your self-created nightmare
Erasing all that remains
Waking again to yourself and your hatred and pain
Entering again and again
into your self-created nightmare
Run away once again
Never see the damage you have done

Dwelling in ruins
Drowning in poison
Dwelling in ruins
Drowning in poison

Have you broken them?

Leaving your ruins
Spreading new poison
Carving old wounds on all who defy you
Spitting hate as they disappear
