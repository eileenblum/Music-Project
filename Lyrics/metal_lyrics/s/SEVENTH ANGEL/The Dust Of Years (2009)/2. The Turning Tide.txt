The turning tide - Will we survive?
The drowning of our former lives
The waves that flood our weary minds
And all the promise left behind

The tide spares no-one
Time cares for no-one

In creeping cold I walked alone
Forever searching for a passage home
The freezing wind on broken skin
Hoping somewhere a pulse still beats within

The tide spares no-one
Time cares for no-one

No more looking back
Life will not wait for us
This well-beaten track
unfolds again
So follow on, traveler
Follow on

The ticking clocks will never wait
Searching for answers that come too late
The wasted moments in the dark
The tears, the scars, the broken hearts

The tide spares no-one
Time cares for no-one

Was it just an empty promise?
You would be waiting for us
