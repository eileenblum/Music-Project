I am weak, I am strong
I am anything that will make me belong
I am proud, I'm ashamed
I am looking for someone to carry the blame

Weep not for us
We rest in peace
Our charred remains
Eternity
[2x]

I will sleep, I will wake
I will offer my soul for someone to take
I will hate, I will crave
I will promise to lay down my life once again

Weep not for us
We rest in peace
Our charred remains
Eternity
[2x]

Mercy, laughter
Gallows that whisper
Jaded garlands we wear
Twilight, faithful
Silent in circles
Candles flicker and fade

I recall we were young
When our lives had just begun
I remember we would dream
Slow engulf serenity

Mercy, laughter
Gallows that whisper
Jaded garlands we wear
Twilight, faithful
Silent in circles
Candles flicker and fade

I recall we were young
When our lives had just begun
I remember we would dream
Slow engulf serenity

Weep not for us
We rest in peace
Our charred remains
Eternity
[2x]
