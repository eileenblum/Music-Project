It's so cold in here
I'm lonely and tired
But I cannot sleep
There's death in the air
There's a pain in my head
Would I be better off dead?

Locked up in chains, sentenced to die
Nobody present to hear my cry
Locked up in chains, sentenced to die
Nobody present to hear my cry.

Prisoner for Christ, my only crime
Is preaching His word, so truth can be heard
I've been locked inside, they say I'm insane
Beaten me, starved me
Left me in pain.

Locked up in chains, sentenced to die
Nobody present to hear my cry
Locked up in chains, sentenced to die
Nobody present to hear my cry.

Arrested and chained, taken away
Away from my home, from the people who love me
I've been locked inside, they say I'm insane
Beaten me, starved me
Left me in pain.

Locked up in chains, sentenced to die
Nobody present to hear my cry
Locked up in chains, sentenced to die
Nobody present to hear my cry.

Sometimes I lose hope
But I know I can find strength
In my Saviour who died
He suffered and bled
I know he's waiting for me
If I die, I know he's waiting for me
Pray for me!
