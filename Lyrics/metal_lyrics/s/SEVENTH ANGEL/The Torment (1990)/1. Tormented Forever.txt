Cruelty and violence, inspiration from the depths
Man's inhumanity, tormented till death
Hope, lost world's injustice don't be deceived
One day one will pay, justice all will see.

Day, night, Tormented Forever.

One day, Satan will be thrown into the lake
A lake not of water, but a burning sulphur lake
Day, night, forever and ever with the false prophet and beast
Never ending agony, the pain will never cease.

Day, night, Tormented Forever.

Listen to me now for this concerns you,
If you do not accept Christ, you will be thrown in too!
If your name is not found in the Book of Life
There will never ever be an ending to your strife.

Day, night, Tormented Forever.
Day, night, Tormented Forever.

The lake of fire is the second death
No one can return
In Jesus there is an escape
Now is the time surrender
Turn away from unrighteousness
Giving all to Christ
You will not only find joy in this life
But in the life to come.
