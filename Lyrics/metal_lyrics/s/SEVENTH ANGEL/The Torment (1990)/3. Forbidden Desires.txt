Welcome to the tainted eden
See Adam eat at the fruit forbidden.

Garden burning, crimson passions
The mesmerising song of sirens.

Temptation's thorn piercing unsoiled flesh
Desire gives birth to death.

Fall of Man
Fall of Man

Welcome to the fallen paradise
See Adam craves, her words entice.

Gather round the beckoning vine
The serpent whispers seduction's rhyme.

Temptation's thorn piercing unsoiled flesh
Desire gives birth to death.

Fall of Man
Fall of Man
