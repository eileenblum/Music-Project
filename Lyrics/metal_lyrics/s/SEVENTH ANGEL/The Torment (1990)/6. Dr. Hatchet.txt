Dr. Hatchet dressed to kill
A woman's right a twisted will
How much for the slaughter of a baby child
Aborted victim of a world defiled
Hanging from the gallows in a hospital room
Claiming of a life in a medical tomb.

Dr. Hatchet dressed in white
How can you sleep at night?
Lives you've taken and thrown away
You'll have to give account on judgement day.

A woman sits waiting in a chair
Soon to be shackled inside the snare
Inside this room spotless and clean
The victim's blood is never seen
Your unborn taken, ripped in two
The one so helpless relying on you.

Dr. Hatchet dressed in white
How can you sleep at night?
Lives you've taken and thrown away
You'll have to give account on judgement day.

But Dr. Hatchet, you're only a man
You are part of a larger plan
Prepared by evil in the darkness below
You've been deceived, too blind to know
The slaughter can stop, don't let it go on
There is forgiveness in the risen Son.
