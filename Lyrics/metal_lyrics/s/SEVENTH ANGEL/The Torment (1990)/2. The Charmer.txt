Hold my hand, I'll take you to forbidden lands
Behold your queen.
Speak these words, intoxicating all who've heard
A mind naive.

Enter the trance, desires and dreams that'll enhance
Caressed by skill
Beyond the door, what lies there you must explore
Melting your will.

Blinded eyes, heed his lies
Visions of lust
Safe at first, now you're cursed
Crumbling to dust.

Now I return to my distraught shell
The masque of falseness has taunted me well
The Charmer is laughing, has left me to die
Deceived with power, I've swallowed the lie.

In the last days, there shall not be found
One of you standing upon holy ground
The witch will burn, the Charmer flee
From Jesus the Lord of all purity.

Hold his hand, He'll lead you to the promised land
Behold the Throne
Sing His praise, surrender to the Son He raised
The journey home.
