[performed by Seventh Angel]In heaven I saw a sign, a great and marvellous sign
7 Angels with the 7 last plagues
With them, God wrath is completed
7 Angels with the 7 last plagues

I saw what looked like a sea
Glass mixed with fire, standing by the sea
O'er the beast, His image, the number of His name
All those present know victory

Great and marvellous are Your deeds, Lord God Almighty
Just and true are your ways, king of the ages

Holdings harps given by God singing the song of Moses
Moses the servant of our God and the song of the lamb

Who will not fear You O Lord and bring glory to Your name

For You alone are holy,  all nations will come
They will worship before you, your
righteous acts have been revealed

After this, I looked and in heaven the temple was opened
(The tabernacle of the testimony) out of the temple came the 7 angels 
with the 7 plagues, they were dressed in clean shining linen and wore 

golden sashes around their chest, then one of the four living churches
gave to the 7 angels, golden bowns filled with Gods wraths (He
lives forever and ever) the temple was filled with the smoke from the 
glory of God (and from his power) no one could enter temple until
the 7 plagues of the 7 angels were completed.
