Eighty years have passed
Weak eyes can hardly see
This frail body dies
Mortal life expires
As my soul is removed
Farewell to Human cries

My soul journeys on
I know my name is written in
The Lamb's book of life
I soon will see you
My king, my only Lord
To dwell in Heaven's peace

My journey complete
Unto a better life
There is no more pain
Free from infirmity
Love of the Trinity
Reflected happiness

So I find release
Jesus Christ King of Kings
Is here with me
No need for sun or moon
God's glory will never cease.
