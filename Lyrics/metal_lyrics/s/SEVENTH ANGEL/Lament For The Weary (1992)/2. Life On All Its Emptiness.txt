Blackening clouds darkness
Clawing my mind sadness
Visions so black clawing my mind.

I have nothing left to live for
All my friends have forsaken me
I am here alone in this darkened room
Visions of Deeath are all I see.

I have given, I have taken
I have lived my life by the rules
I have been used by so many people
Only to be left as a fool.

[Bridge (solo)]

Sadness falls on a lonely heart
Tears flow freely
Darkness plays a mind torn apart
Life in all its emptiness (hope has gone from me)
Emptiness (where is my release)
