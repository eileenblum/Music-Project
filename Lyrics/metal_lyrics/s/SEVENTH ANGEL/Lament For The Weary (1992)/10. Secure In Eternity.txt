Survey the past, gaze into time, recalling pain, once was mine
Reheld the blade, symbol of my moorbid desire, then to die

Screamed in agony,
Life was Hell for me,
I cry out to thee.

[CHORUS:] Secure in Eternity, of hopelessness devoid.
Bestowed Immortality, fear of death destroyed,-

I lie alone, close to death, assured of Heaven, to my last breath,
My peaceful soul, God is here, encircling peace, Paradise is near.

Miraculous entity,
Only now I see,
Escaped Mortality.

[CHORUS;]
Forgiveness of sin, through God's own Son, by holy sacrifice,
Eternity begun.
The disentombed Christ, opens up Heaven, brings me life, by ressurection
