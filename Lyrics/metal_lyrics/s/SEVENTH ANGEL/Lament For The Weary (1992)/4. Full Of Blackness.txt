Childhood memories, haunting my mind
A lingering pain left unhealed by time
A scream, a prayer, a tear
Grant me an end to fear

[BRIDGE;] Time is passing by, one more night these tears I cry
Slipping, falling into darkness, this life is full of blackness

[CHORUS;] No love left to offer, stripped of hope, alone i suffer
(The end for me is near, one more night, then no more fear)

This cold empty room full of memories
It screams of my past giving me no peace
The hours crawl on again
I'll sleep tonight in pain

[BRIDGE+CHORUS]

You came to me once, whispered my name
Many years ago you took my shame
I ran from you in tears
The only one who cares

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS2;] No love left to offer, stripped of hope, alone I suffer
(The only thing I can do in this night is run to you)
