[INTRO:] I'm still living, life goes on
But with you its no longer impossible
Through the tragedy, alone so long
I had given up on everything possible

[BRIDGE:] Falling deeper into depression
I needed death, I'd thought it through
Constant failure, endless pressure
One last chant, I take in you

I fell to my knees in despair, please save me Lord
Feeling weak, Feeling numb, thinking that the end had come

Falling away from reality, giving way to insanity

I fell at the foot of the cross, I saw your face
Saw the blood, saw the pain, through you I would live again

[CHORUS, BRIDGE;]

I stood by the cold empty grave, and you were gone
Alive again in flesh and blood, in my mind I understood

Returning once more to reality, released from fear
