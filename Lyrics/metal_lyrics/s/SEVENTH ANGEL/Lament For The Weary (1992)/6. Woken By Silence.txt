Through the dark night
From this slumber woken by silence
In this silence
I have the choice to live or die
I remember
You gave me love I'd never known before

Lord I cry to you
See my pain
Raise me from this agony
To live again
I return to you
Through the pain
I know there's no other way
To live again
