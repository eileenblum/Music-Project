Never will I leave you nor will I forsake you
This is what you promised
Even though I wander running all the time
You have always loved me

DARK SHADOWS

Never thought I'd see the day, these dark shadows stripped away
Rising ever higher, from oppression, taken to another place

[CHORUS;] DARK SHADOWS

Forgiveness, and to fear, numbness taken from my mind
Finding a new potential, inspiration, finding fullness through Christ

[CHORUS;] DARK SHADOWS
