In your filthy body
I bury my sword
You shall never again
Pray to your fucking lord

With red-hot steel
I rape your throat
And force you
To kiss the goat

A sharp knife cuts your tongue
I pluck out the eyes of the bastard son
Shining scythe ends your life
Your agony is the payment for the crimes

From my command you eat filth and mud
I'll torment you until you drown in your own blood
Now you are destroyed and we are back in the ways of old

I burn your body and leave the remnants for the crows

Victory! I speak the words of blasphemy!
And the world shall forget your memory!!!
