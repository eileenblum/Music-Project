The decay started to blind their blue eyes
As they smiled and laughed praising their lord

And the last lie they needed to hear
Was supposed to set them free
To forgive all their sins and purify them
To save their immortal souls

The horror spread through the nations
And mankind was drowned in despair
Statues of Christ bled black blood
And were swallowed by the earth

Even the strongest of men screamed and cried
One by one their lifeless corpses fell to the ground
Feeding the fields of blood
Summoning the final hour of destruction

As the sun began to blacken and the world to freeze
Flowers withered and stars fell
See the plague spread in the cold breeze

No human would ever again breathe

Statues of Christ bled black blood
And were swallowed by the earth

The reek of death descended from the sky
And the whole world stood still
The future of life seaced to be
And mankind would now finally extinct
