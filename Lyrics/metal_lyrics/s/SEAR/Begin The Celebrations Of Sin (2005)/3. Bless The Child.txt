Incest, molest
The beauty of this world
Incest, molest
You rape your children again and again
'Til they can't take no more

You scar the infant with a burning cross
And make your saviour's mark
Child of Christ for eternity
You take him from behind
Rape the soul through the anus
Hear the flesh rip open as angels chant
Pillow on the child's tiny head
Make sure no one can hear a sound

Slowly thrusting harder and deeper
Bones start to break and the child breathes no more

Praise the lord and thank him
For this fragile and innocent whore
