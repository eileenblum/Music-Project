No one can say its all a waste of time
Turn back the clock and watch the worlds align
Did you forget the things that brought you here?
The inner child the one who knows no fear

This time the toys have all been packed away
Who wants to go when everything says stay
Can you find the things you feel inside?
Just close the door to see a brand new ride

Imitating slowly fading life
So much older something just ain't right

Now every day seems like the one before
So much to see and there's no time
Memories wrap themselves around my heart
Am I mistaken, am I wrong

Seems like every time I close my eyes
The pictures fade they come and go
Set everything aside there's nothing more
Come hide the keys and lock the door
