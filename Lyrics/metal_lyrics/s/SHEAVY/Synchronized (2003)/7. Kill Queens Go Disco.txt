Kill queens on a desert sky
In a death car powered by
Nothing like you've ever seen
See the dust on the driver's side
Four speed and the power glide
Close your eyes and now they're gone

Set fast in the city lights
See the flames of the disco nights
If you ain't there you're gonna lose
Drop shift and a double clutch
Miss a gear but it won't mean much
You'll see the evil in their eyes

Always searching, never finding
The engine fires okay
Kill queens on a two lane highway
There's never time to stay

Headlights on the center line
Top speed and they're doin' fine
Its just the way its gotta be
Sit back and enjoy the ride
Shift straight into overdrive
Driving on into the sun
