Its in the way that you
Lay it down
Not everything's gonna
Turn you around
You like to dream but you 
Fear the time
When nothing else ever
Fits the rhyme

You look away when its
Time to see
Losing the place where you
Think you'll be
You say its clear but its
All a haze
Can't find your way through the 
Endless maze

In the time it takes to see
The future's pre-decided
If you stop to read the signs
The light is always blinding

You won't believe that its
There to find
Too many pieces
Escape your mind
Do what it takes till its
Just what it seems
Inside today's confusion
You'll find your dreams
