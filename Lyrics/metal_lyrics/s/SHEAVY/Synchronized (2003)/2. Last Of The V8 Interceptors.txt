Show me the gasoline and come fuel the fire
Lost everything except my dreams
Take it all apart now, see what it is
You'll find a face that can't forgive

Never forget the past it's too much to bear
Unlock the interceptor mind
I'll find the one who haunts me, I know his name
Someone must die to play this game

Is it all so black and white?
Faces turn I know I'm right
Nitrous burning in my mind
No escaping what I'll find
