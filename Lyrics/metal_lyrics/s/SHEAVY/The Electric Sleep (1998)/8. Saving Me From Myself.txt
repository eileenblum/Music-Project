It's like every sparkle that fell from your eyes
It's like every dream they sold you
Came today like some terrible vision
They came the day nothing seemed to be right

It's like every light gave its soul to the darkness
And said its last goodbyes
It's like every day made its mark on the future
And promptly left you behind

You had a voice that could wake me
Saving me from myself

I wanted to find things I lost in the mirror
Who lives behind that face
I needed to find what was real and illusion
To prove that I was okay

You had a voice that could wake me
Saving me from myself
Laughing on the outside but the inside is another ride
That I never wanted to see
Laughing on the outside but the inside is another ride
And I never wanted to be

You helped me to see that the sky hadn't fallen
Were just my eyes misplaced
You said I could look past the crack in the mirror
Past the empty space

But you had a voice that could wake me
Saving me from myself
Laughing on the outside but the inside is another ride
That I never wanted to see
Laughing on the outside but the inside is another ride
And I never asked them to be

I thank you for eyes that can see what I'm dreaming
What did you see in my face
I thank you for days far away from this sadness
Far away from this place

But you had a voice that could wake me
Saving me from myself
Laughing on the outside but the inside is another ride
That I never wanted to see
Laughing on the outside but the inside is another ride
And I never asked them to be, yeah

I never wanted to see
I never asked them to be
I never wanted to die
I never wanted to try
