On and on, time it slips into the sea
On and on, a circus crowd surrounds the sun
Stay my friend, a song not nearly at its end
Sleep my friend, the dream is far from over

What would they say, if we stayed right here forever
What would they say, if we stayed

Days pass by, the crimson ship has flown away
You and I, may lie right here forever
Say you'll stay, if for just a little while
Say you'll stay, tomorrow's just another dream

What would they say, if we stayed right here forever
What would they say, if we stayed

Shine and shine, the world is still a friend of mine
Torture's garden, where every sky is silver gray
Sleep my friend, the day is surely at it's end
Sleep my friend, the sky has turned to velvet

What would they say, if we stayed right here forever
What would they say, if we stayed right here
Forever

On and on, a circus crowd surrounds the sun
