She forgot to breathe
She forgot it was make-believe
Can't avoid her eyes
She never cared for long goodbyes

Thought I heard a whisper
Something 'bout a masquerade
Now she dances every day for me

She forgot to say
Why she wrote the final scene that way
And years leave only time
On silver screens that play across my mind

It should have been easy
It should have been everything she dreamed
It should have been magic, yeah, but it's over
Who knew what was on her mind
It should have been magic, yeah, but it's over

Caught up in that world
Where some stars shine and some just fade away
Yet I remember smiles
Forbidden dreams and places I might hide

Thought I heard a whisper
Something 'bout the game she played
Yeah, I know those whispers aren't for me

It should have been easy
It should have been everything she dreamed
It should have been magic, yeah, but it's over
Who knew what was on her mind
It should have been magic, yeah, but it's over

She forgot to breathe
She forgot it was make-believe
And I still see her eyes
She never stayed for long goodbyes
Hey, it's over
Hey, it's over
The dream is over
The dream is over
Yeah, it's over

Sinderella's got her life on trial
Sleeping beauty with the icy smile
Steamy hustler did it with those eyes
X-rated surprise
And oh Savannah, was it life you loved
Endless parties
Flights of ecstasy, the dream never dies
In my eyes
