Tears in the eyes of age
Whisper softly silent sounds
Tears in the eyes of age
See a world turned upside-down

Time drifting slowly
Through the eyes of the Oracle
Can I ask a question
What does the future hold

Sign of the times, my friend
So much at your fingers' ends
Sign of the times, my friend
Never reaching things you see

Life passing quickly
See the eyes of the Oracle
Can I ask a question
What's left for me

Come see the Oracle, the prophet looks my way
No tricks or crystal gazing, no words to say
Open your mind to every single thing you see
All that's good and evil, frozen in your dreams

So walk with me, my friend, there's nothing left to fear
The things you hope to see have never been so near
Now every day will hold a brighter sky, you'll say
I'd pray for darkness, it's the price of sight you'll pay
