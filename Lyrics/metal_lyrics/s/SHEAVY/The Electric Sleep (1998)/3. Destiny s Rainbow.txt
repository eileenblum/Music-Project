Seven angels painted the heavens
Six will find me, still I can't know
Why the colors trapped in the rainbow
Weave a silent peace as they glow

Sliding down destiny's rainbow
Leaving all my worries behind
Sliding down destiny's rainbow
Fate will find me safe in the skies above

Days at twilight drift with no reason
Steal the future as it begins
Ageless, timeless, beauty so mindless
Chasing the colors, surely I'll go

Sliding down destiny's rainbow
Leaving all my worries behind
Sliding down destiny's rainbow
Fate will find me safe in the skies above

Sliding down destiny's rainbow
Leaving all my worries behind
Sliding down destiny's rainbow
Fate will find me safe in the skies above

Safe in the skies
Safe in the skies
Safe in the skies
Safe in the skies
