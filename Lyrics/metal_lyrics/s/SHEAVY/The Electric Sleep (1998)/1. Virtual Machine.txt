You like to see me, I'm everywhere
You say you need me but you always disappear
The slate is empty, you wiped it clean
They say you live just like a virtual machine

I want you to feel like I do
I want you to feel
Like I do

The years have left you, a faceless dream
That hides the pain and all the sorrow that you've seen
The faintest laughter, the brightest skies
I wish you everything this life just can't provide

I want you to feel like I do
I want you to feel
Like I do
Like I do

The wait is over, I feel it's near
When all the empty skies will fade and disappear
It's all the same now, it's just a dream
No more to walk this world, my virtual machine

I want you to feel like I do
I want you to feel
Like I do
Like I do

I want you to feel like I do
I want you to feel
Like I do
Like I do

You like to see me, I'm everywhere
You say you need me but you always disappear
The slate is empty, you wiped it clean
They say you live just like a virtual machine

I want you to feel like I do
I want you to feel
Like I do
Like I do
Like I do
Like I do
Like I do...
