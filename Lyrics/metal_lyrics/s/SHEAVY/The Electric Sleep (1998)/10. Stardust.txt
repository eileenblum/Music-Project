Stardust fills the endless night
Through galaxies of darkened skies
Where memories begin to fade
And dreams no longer die

This universe, my lonely place
Where few will ever see
The empty spaces left behind
Where life it once had been

Hey, we're a part of the stardust
Just another light in the sky
Hey, we're a part of the stardust
Spinning long after we die

Stardust fills the endless night
Through centuries of war and pain
Where tears from countless eyes have fallen
And wounds forever bleed

Hey, we're a part of the stardust
Just another light in the sky
Hey, we're a part of the stardust
Spinning long after we die

Stardust fills the endless night
With signs for all the world to see
Forget the sun, the signs will say
The light can set you free

Hey, we're a part of the stardust
Just another light in the sky
Hey, we're a part of the stardust
Spinning long after we die
