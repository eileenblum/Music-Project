Wheel in the sky sent me here from the future
Kept me under it's spell
Lying awake, scan the things that surround me
Sleeping city waits
Electric mind, silver circuits, electrodes
Never know who I am
Father of children, the one stood beside you
Only time will tell

If all the secrets, they've been hoping to find
Unlock the programs buried deep in my mind
And am I human or just a robot slave
They sent me here so their world I could save, yeah

Searching the streets, a machine with a mission
Never programmed to fail
Targets in sight, retina scan past alarm lights
Password's broken I'm there

If all the secrets, they've been hoping to find
Unlock the programs buried deep in my mind
And am I human or just a robot slave
They sent me here so their world I could save, yeah

Daylight's turning my sensors red
Better download before they find me
Scanning, searching the files protected
Your encryption can never stop me
Search complete, federal mainframes beat
These files belonged to my father
Data saved, now I'm disengaged
Flashing screen says task is aborted

Message conveyed through an infinite darkness
Light years, maybe further
Mankind in wisdom, you made us your slaves
Future shows who's the wiser

If all the secrets, they've been hoping to find
Unlock the programs buried deep in my mind
And am I human or just a robot slave
They sent me here so their world I could save, yeah

They sent me here so this world I could save
So this world I could save
So this world I could save
