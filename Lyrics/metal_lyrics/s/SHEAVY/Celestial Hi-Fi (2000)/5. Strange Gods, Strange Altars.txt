Do you think about the future, can you see your inner life
Are you there because you're all alone
Dreams can weave illusion, just like time can blur your mind
Take it all and leave the rest behind

Strange gods upon strange altars
Little pieces of me and you
Magic eyes watch you falling faster
Past the places you thought you knew

Is it real or is it something, high above or far below
Do you see it, can you touch and feel
Far beyond tomorrow, in a place no one remembers
Will it matter if you worshipped the sun

Strange gods upon strange altars
Little pieces of me and you
Magic eyes watch you falling faster
Past the places you thought you knew

See it all, coming clear, believing in you
What is there, cannot say, you'll see it too
Who are you, who am I, waiting to find
Will it be, can it be, seems so unkind

Believing, believing this time
Believing, believing this time

Take it all, looking back, finding you there
Worship me, worship you, why should I care
I can see, you can hear, what does it mean
Look inside, see it there, all just a dream

I'm leaving, I'm leaving this time
I'm leaving, I'm leaving this time

Do you think about the future, can you see your inner life
Are you there because you're all alone
Dreams can weave illusion, just like time can blur your mind
Take it all and leave the rest behind

Strange gods upon strange altars
Little pieces of me and you
Magic eyes watch you falling faster
Past the places you thought you knew

Strange gods, strange altars
Strange gods, strange altars
Strange gods, strange altars
