So many questions, too many lies
Not enough answers, what a surprise
Facing the world like destiny's child
Who am I kidding

I can't believe there's a God in the sky
Selling his dreams to the world
I can't believe that the sun in my eyes
Couldn't care less if I burned

Tell me your reasons, I'll tell you mine
I'm a believer, pray at my shine
Selling my soul one piece at a time
Yeah, it's beyond me

I can't believe there's a God in the sky
Selling his dreams to the world
I can't believe that the sun in my eyes
Couldn't care less if I burned

You know, Mr. Zero, it's me
Yeah, Mr. Zero, can you see
If you're the light in my eyes
Why do you need a disguise

And so if you see me, show me a sign
Too many questions, not enough time
Closing my eyes and leading me blind
Who are you kidding

I can't believe there's a God in the sky
Selling his dreams to the world
I can't believe that the sun in my eyes
Couldn't care less if I burned

You know, Mr. Zero, it's me
And yeah, Mr. Zero, can you see
If you're the light in my eyes
Why do you need a disguise

What's up, Mr. Zero, yeah
What's up, Mr. Zero, yeah
