They took the long dark journey back into the void
Escaped the Earth's black world of decay
They watched as mankind brought about its own demise
Fell down to Satan's slaves
Upon a world unknown came the future
In peace and love they would live every day
With all the hate and greed far behind them
It was a better life they made

Too soon the poisoned Earth was forgotten
The sons of freedom now in their graves
Inside their children's hearts grew the darkness
The start of all man's wicked ways
They watched the cities rise up around them
And tower high over empires of greed
The burning hate that the fathers had fled from
Could it be their own destiny

To the skies their rockets blazed, with lethal might they soared
Killing sprees on distant worlds, a new apocalypse was born
On and on through galaxies, the endless wars they waged
Back on Earth ten legions rose, the fire of Satan's rage

The crumbling skies rained darkness upon them
The blackened sun brought an unending night
The shattered dreams of a world dead and dying
The end of all man's hope and light
A single flame carried those who remembered
Out to the shield where it all had begun
Once again they would fight for their freedom
As they headed into the Sun
