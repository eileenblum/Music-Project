I've seen you on the streets a thousand times
Is it all out or nothing today, yeah
See you shining under super skies
Or did you leave the garden this way, yeah
If I take my time, I can roll down through this world
If I could get my turn, if I could ever learn
Not a lot to say, oh yeah
Oh yeah

I took the stars from the sky once more, and I'll leave them all for yesterday
I have stolen the mystery, it's gonna come my way
Slipped it into a final gear, but it's holding back on you
Now I've got my turn, know I'll never learn
Got a lot to say, oh yeah
It's goin' 'round, yeah
It's goin' 'round, yeah

I can feel the engine runnin' fine, it's all out or nothing today, yeah
If it's the last machine in time, then you'll be flying me out there
If we take our time, we can roll down through this world, yeah
We've got a lot to learn, we've got the fuel to burn
Had enough to say, oh yeah
It's goin' 'round, yeah
It's goin' 'round, yeah
