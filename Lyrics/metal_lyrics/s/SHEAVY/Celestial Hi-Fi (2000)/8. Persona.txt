I was searching for real
I was searching forever time
I was giving it all just waiting for you, yeah
I was searching for any day now
I was looking the best to come
I was feeling like nothing ever will or was
I was setting my sights on someday
I was looking so high I could die
I was feeling like nothing would ever happen
Lord knows the peace of time could come over me
I never saw it before and I'm sure I'll never see it again
Oh no, it's coming back, it's coming 'round again
It surely will wake me from my dream over and over again
Oh yeah

I know it's over mine
I know it keeps you there
I know it's on your mind
And I know it keeps you there
I know it's the real life
I know it's a state of mind
If it could be everything, who would you be this time
Oh yeah

Had a dream that you left me
I couldn't take it away or give it back
Wanted you so badly that I
Never saw any more
I leave you entirety, yeah
I wouldn't want it any other way
I kept you tomorrow, and I'll leave you here today

Come walk along the universe
Is it you I'm seeing today
Glossy faces, pixel eyes
Not a picture, not a disguise
Say is it there, all the time
A persona looking at you
I know you say, the things I see
They're never quite who you are

It was a Sunday dawning
And you were just there
I feel like a new day dawning
And I don't care
I know it's not real life
I know it's not who you are
Still do you wonder if she's really, really there sometimes
Oh yeah

With rented time, that's all it seems
Taking turns and drifting away
Some people watch the bluest skies
And see the darkest shadows of gray
Oh, is it you or is it me
Or does it really matter which way
I hope in life as if a dream
You're as real as you are today

Something inside it told me
It really don't matter now
It kept me here and I
I really don't know how
I looked into her face, yeah
I'd seen it before
I'd seen it a million times, and I'm sure I'll see it once more

Ah yeah, you've got a million smiles for me
