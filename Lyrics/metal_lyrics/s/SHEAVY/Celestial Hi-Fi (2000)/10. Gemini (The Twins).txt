I gave you everything
You took it all
Stars told our destiny
We watched them fall
I said you'd see my vision
You said I lied
Like every word unspoken
Things kept inside

Come feel the silence, watch it tear out your heart
If fate meets destiny, can't tell them apart
So many faces, taking two making one
Planets in disarray, we're coming undone

What's your sign

Still life, another day
That's what you claim
So much and far away
Just who's to blame
You said I'd see your reasons
I said you lied
You walk the world in shadows
I stand aside

Just like the promises that burned in your eyes
I took the ?? and fell for your lies
Crossing the universe, it's you I would find
Where are the others, did you leave them behind

I spoke in mystery
That's what you said
Spiraling questions answered
??
I couldn't see myself there
You said I died
Truth is you never saw
Who lived inside

Come feel the silence, watch it tear out your heart
If fate meets destiny, can't tell them apart
So many faces, taking two making one
Planets in disarray, we're coming undone

What's your sign
What's your sign
What's your sign
