I climb the mountains here every day
Ten thousand voices, just can't hear what they say
One empty scream fills the darkness above
No sign, no warning, just the warm light of love
Oh yeah
Yeah...

I climb the mountains here every day
Ten thousand voices, just can't hear what they say
Here lies the last of the cold dead fire's hate
Come light the candles, eyes closed, silently wait
I climb the mountain, feel the tightrope on my mind
I climb the mountain, know the madness' not my crime

Nightmares and dreamscapes fill up my mind
Searching the darkness, tell me what will I find
Here lies the last of the cold dead fire's hate
Come light the candles, eyes closed, silently wait
I climb the mountain, feel the tightrope on my mind
I climb the mountain, know the madness' not my crime

I climb the mountains here every day
Ten thousand voices, just can't hear what they say
Here lies the last of the cold dead fire's hate
Come light the candles, eyes closed, silently wait
I climb the mountain, feel the tightrope on my mind
I climb the mountain, know the madness' not my crime

Yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
