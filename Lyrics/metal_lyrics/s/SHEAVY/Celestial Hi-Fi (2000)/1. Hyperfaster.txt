Take me into hyperfaster, show me your love
I'm gonna see it someday
Take me into hyperfaster, show me your world
I'm gonna be there someday

Take me to the places where you've never been
I'm gonna be there with you
Show me all the things that you have never seen
I'm gonna see them with you

The sun is rising, higher and higher again
My world keeps glowing, darker and darker, the end

Ask me if the things I see become my dreams
I know you see right through me
Let me hear the thoughts that echo past your mind
I know you'll share them with me

The sun is rising, higher and higher again
My world keeps glowing, darker and darker, the end

Send me into hyperfaster, lost in the sun
I know we'll find it someday
Send me into hyperfaster, leaving this world
I know we'll shine there someday

The sun is rising, higher and higher again
My world keeps glowing, darker and darker, the end
