So many faces dance through my mind, I don't know which way to turn
Take all the memories and keep them inside, they say I'll live and I'll learn
If it was true, would you tell me, if it was lies, would you hide
All of the things that they've taken, on this solarspherical ride

Give me the pieces one at a time, I lost them all in the end
Do you believe me, what would you say, if I said the light I could bend
You took a chance on the future, I saw you give it away
Killing yourself with the answers, to questions I hear every day

I've seen the solarsphere, I've seen the solarsphere
I've seen it all in my mind
I've seen the solarsphere, I've seen the solarsphere
I'll take you with me this time

The setting sun was dying, on the night I found you there
You said your life was spent just waiting, I didn't know if I should care
In your eyes I saw a picture, a million constellations where
Every question had an answer, every thought was void of fear

The second star was rising, by the time I looked away
You said you'd had enough of waiting, couldn't stay another day
Closed my eyes and took you with me, not a whisper, not a care
I hope you find the things you wished for, the endless night, the solarsphere
