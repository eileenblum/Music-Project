I used to be just like you
I'd sit here everyday
Mock suicide, your wounded pride
Kept getting in the way

You know that I can't tell you
You know I'd never lie
Your enemies are ill at ease
The moon is in their sky
Alright

Can anybody tell me
The difference right or wrong
Put games aside the second time
This joker's played too long

Don't say I didn't warn you
Don't say I wasn't fair
With open eyes, to your surprise
You'll find I wasn't there

And you say you could never read me
That cards never play in my eyes
But the pieces are moving, the game's an illusion
And the hand you've been dealt is mine

And you say you could never read me
That cards never play in my eyes
But the pieces are moving, the game's an illusion
And the hand you've been dealt is mine

Destiny's answer to everyone else
Seems empty as far as you've gone
Expect the surprises, don't ever ask why
You're facing this world on your own

Promises broken and promises made
The sooner you know, you can try
The best you can hope for is knowing someday
All winners and losers must die
