Take your memories, the things you've seen
Close your eyes and watch it like a dream
Green with envy and colored with lies
The universe inside you slowly dies

See the difference
Between you and me
I'm not the only one
Dancing with demons who die in the setting sun

Trusting in yesterday, the first time by
Leave your heart and be the last to try
Promising everything and dying to live
The lesson's learned and still you can't forgive

See the difference
Between you and me
I'm not the only one
Dancing with demons who die in the setting sun

Tempted by fortune, what comes and goes
Open your eyes, I fear the curtain's closed
Turning the pages and trying to find
The words that tell you what you left behind

See the difference
Between you and me
I'm not the only one
Dancing with demons who die in the setting sun
