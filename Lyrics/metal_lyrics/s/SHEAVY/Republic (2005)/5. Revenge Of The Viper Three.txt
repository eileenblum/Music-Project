It's just a picture of what might have been
But now it's everything you see
Just leave it hanging on the wall that way
It lets you live it all again

Feel it coming
Chances are
The silver blade will leave a scar
See it running
Down the spine
The day you said revenge is mine

Still can't remember where it all began
Those who were five, now only three
Forget the shadows and the memories there
It's just a place where things went wrong

Feel it coming
Chances are
The silver blade will leave a scar
See it running
Down the spine
The day you said revenge is mine

Wasted anger turned inside
The pain is all you see
Eyes are closing, darker now
It's all you'll ever be

Now every day is one you hope to see
What's in the past, forever gone
You'll know the faces in the shadows fear
The ones who live to see them fall

Feel it coming
Chances are
The silver blade will leave a scar
See it running
Down the spine
The day you said revenge is mine
