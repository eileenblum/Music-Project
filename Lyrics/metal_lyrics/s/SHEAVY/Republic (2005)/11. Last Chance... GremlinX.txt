Walking in circles, wondering what might
Turn into, come back to, who knows what's right
Take every moment, you'll see it's true
Some laughing, some crying, what else can I do

Victims of choices, only one life
Paste tenses, last chances, fading into night
Losers and winners feeling the same
No ending, no denying, tell me who's to blame

No time for me to say
No time for you
Whatever sense it made
Won't be the same again
You'll turn away and find it's gone

Born to live and die the same as everyone
Read the lines they carve below your name
Will it say the past is just where you belong
Or will they live forever in your song

No time for me to say
No time for you
Whatever sense it made
Won't be the same again
You'll turn away and find it's gone

Now the demons you can leave behind
Fall along the way
Scattered on a world of dreams
See it everyday

Now they're gone
Yeah, they're gone
Now they're gone
Yeah, they're gone

If it's you and me, then who decides
Why the voices come
On and on, the echo flies
Burning in the sun

Now it's done
Yeah, it's done
Now it's done
Yeah, it's done
