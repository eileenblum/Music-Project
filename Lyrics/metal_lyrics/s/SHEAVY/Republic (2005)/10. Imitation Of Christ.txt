Who am I deceiving when I place my trust
Devotion saved by mysteries, two thousand years of rust
If evil is the enemy, dish it out in spades
Crucified, now you decide just how this world was made

Meditation on the death of all I think and feel
Behind a wall of solitude, who can see what's real
Vanity's a poison pill, you fail at every turn
Glorified, you can't decide, and now you'll never learn

I can feel the desolation, chaos in my soul
Promising a new beginning, still I lose control
So they say that my reflection pales next to you
How can I trust myself to see it through with you

Everyday, a new temptation, something I can't say
Trusting my imagination, blind in every way
Would you say that I'm a theif for imitating you
Why would you even trust me if I do, should you
