Nothing ever changes
Traps that aim to foil
Ease into your leisure
Blood begins to boil

Eyes in every corner
Spy the bombs you lay
Fortune weighs empty
Explodes now every day

Cracks in the mirror
Sevens in a row
Luck needs no comfort
If chaos steals the show

He who is clever
Builds toys electrified
Others lie waiting
Conscience, no guide

Ask me the reason
Trust me, I lied
Poisoned by the venom
And daily, I've died
