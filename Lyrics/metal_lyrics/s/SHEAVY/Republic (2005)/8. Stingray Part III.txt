Destiny's a cold, dead hand, tempting me with nowhere
Rise and fall, but after all, today is dying somewhere
Possibly a part of me still believes I can
There was a time when only my mind said where it all began

Say, can you show me
What should I believe
Walking in shadows
'Til the day I step into my grave

A messenger, an empty page written by a dead man
Wake to find, but can't deny, the book's never been opened
Possibly a part of me still believes I care
Welcome the time when nothing inside says, "here's the line you fear"

Say, can you tell me
Who should I believe
Hiding in shadows
'Til the day I step into my grave

Say, can you tell me
Who should I believe
Hiding in shadows
'Til the day I step into my grave

Can't you see the part of me burning in the fire
Darker now than anything, temptation fuels desire
Love the soul and hate the man, nothing new, you say
I'd believe in stories too if I knew no other way

Say, can you show me
What should I believe
Walking in shadows
'Til the day I step into my grave

A eulogy, a silent psalm spoken by a deaf man
Try to hide, but can't decide, the spell's never been broken
Could it be a part of me still believes I can
Cursing the time when something inside said, "here's the life you planned"

Say, can you tell me
Who should I believe
Hiding in shadows
'Til the day I step into my grave
