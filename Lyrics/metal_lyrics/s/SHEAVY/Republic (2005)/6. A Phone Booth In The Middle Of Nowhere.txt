Nobody's calling
Asking myself why
Voices from nowhere
Just tempting me to try

Now I don't even know you
Or why I even care
Bizarre tales and mysteries
Keep asking why you're there

Somebody's leaving
Desert eyes enraged
Too busy watching
While nothing stays the same

Now you don't even know me
Or why I really care
Looking through the windows
Seeing sand blown in despair

Everybody's saying
Something's gone wrong
Enemies surround you
It's been silent for so long

Now I can't even see you
It's better left this way
Fading fast in memories
I knew you'd never stay
