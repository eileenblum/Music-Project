The world eater approaches
All galactus brings is death and chaos in his wake
Crippling fear
The silhouette of my enemy approaching
The universe collapsing behind him
The world eater is here
Destruction
All around
Bodies litter the ground
Depopulation
Of what I have built
My minions turn against me in the blink of an eye
Black holes opening to reveal mt opposition appearance
The beginning of the end
The apocalypse is here
For the first time fear is taking over my thoughts
How can this be stopped
How do I stand a chance
The only one to pose a threat
Bringing nothing but emptiness
Armies fall before him
Life sucked dry from all living creatures
Colliding planets as he grows nearer
Eclipsing all of space
Consumption of my world
The eater nearing the end of his process
The Earths core sucked dry
It begins to crumblevdrom the inside
I brace for this
Ruins now my home
Six pieces used for destruction now used to defend
Shards of Earth breaking off
Into space
Constellations rearranged
From the destruction
No amount of cosmic force can stop this
Ripping pieces of existence away
The process now close to complete
The world eaters deed is fulfilled
My throne it crumbles on the ground
I was creator the merciless destroyer
Nothing remains of my throne
