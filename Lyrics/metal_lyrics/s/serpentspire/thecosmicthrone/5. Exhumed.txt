Digging
Thrashing in the ground
So excited by what I have found
Scent seeping through the coffin wood
Getting stiffer by the second
This rotting pussy I will pound
With each thrust getting more excited by the squelching sound
Robbing graves is how I get my nut
Playing and lashing out on dead sluts
Her tender cunt now ready for the feast
Lick her till she splits
Turn her over now
Get a better view of what I must chew
Munching gnawing at her throbbing clit
The more I lick it begins to split
So I continue to feverishly lick
My meat is throbbing amidst the thick stench
Filth and bodily fluids dripping from me now
Her ass is now my chow
Maggots protrude
Squish them to produce my lube
Slippy juices thrown around the room
Shove it deep inside of her without any remorse
I feel the cavity collapsing underneath my force
No more tears shed
Over this cunt
Her family only
Wishes to mourn
Bloated by the rot
This whore will take my cock
I take her down...
I take her down to my fucking lair
And strap her to my operating chair
My tools to perform my experiments laid out perfectly
I cut and slash her skin so meticulously
Filleting each piece with precision
I'll be wearing her momentarily
She was exhumed to fuck
