Cosmic throne
Endless power at my disposal
Ruling over all that exists
Your efforts are useless
Unite and fall together
My reign will change the course of existence
Armies at my disposal
And many pawns are all at work
Faith shaken soon destroyed
Desolation everywhere you look
Complete destruction of planet Earth
I am the ancient of all ancients
Bow down and prepare my sacrifices
Blackened out skies and death close behind
Fear gripping any left behind
Enslaving the population
Rebuilding the world and stripping all it's resources
Molding it to my liking
Death incarnate
Creating cities out of the leftover bodies
I am creator and merciless destroyer
Bow down before my cosmic throne
I am creator and merciless destroyer
Bow down before my cosmic throne
I, the merciless destroyer
I, the all feared ruler
I, the bringer of death
I, the merciless destroyer
I, the all feared ruler
I, the bringer of death
I, the mad fucking titan
All your threats all your security
Will mean nothing when I rain my atrocities
Sis pieces together for one purpose
Nothing can stop what I have become
Send them all
One by one
Or together
It makes no difference
My entire being is focused on destroying your entire species
Martial law now in place
Race obliterated
Not a trace of your existence is left
I am creator and merciless destroyer
Bow down before my cosmic throne
I am creator and merciless destroyer
Bow down before my cosmic throne
I am creator and merciless destroyer
Bow down before my cosmic throne
I am creator and merciless destroyer
Bow down before my cosmic throne
You all will bow down to me
Ashes of a once great race now under my feet
The cosmic throne is complete
