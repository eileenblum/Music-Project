Beasts summoned from an alternate realm
The skies open up
With beams of light
Bodies begin their ascent
Bodies begin their ascent
Population dwindling
Panic strewn streets
An unstoppable force pours on the Earth
No amount of preparation could have stopped this
Cosmic enemies now at our doorstep
No amount of preparation
Could have stopped this
Cosmic enemies now at our doorstep
Cosmic enemies now at our doorstep
Modern man now deceased
Cities reduced to rubble
In what seems like a fraction of a second
This race falls so easily
This Earth now a tomb
Set for me to rule
Set for me to rule
The degradation
Of a population
The degradation
Of a population
The extinction of the human race
Has begun
