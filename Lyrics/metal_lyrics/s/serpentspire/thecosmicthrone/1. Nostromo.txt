Dimly lit corridors
Shadows dancing on the walls
I can still hear the echos of
What happened here before
What happened before
Hunter close behind
A killing force that can't be stopped
Breath quickening
Scrambling for my weapon
Others gone one by one
Only glimpses of what is behind
What is hiding here
What have we awoken
What have we awoken
Derelict rooms covered in gore
Trapped in a maze that ends in death
Fear has taken hold
Fear has taken hold
Consistency stalked
We funnel into her grasp
Blood strewn in every direction
So quick we can't see her shape
We were given every warning
But heeded none
A perfect specimen only bred for death
Foolishly led like sheep to the slaughter
False hope as I see the light
Sharp pain
Sharp pain
Sharp edge pushed through my spine
Face to face with the enemy
And the world feels clear
Right before the end
The world goes black
