The northern winds carried the vision of a time yet to be
when the cold breath of evil once ascends from it's throne
To join me as one with the night, in the light of moon
to let me inhale the mist of my sorrows
Let them flow through my veins and awaken the malice
the convulsion to be reborn like Fenris unbound from its chains
So that I could forever wander in search for his morbid heart
and leave behind just the footsteps in the snow.

Towards a gate between life and oneness with darkness
on a path made of crushed joyless frozen flowers
I will never look behind me, the desolate dark awaits
only once reaching out to crush the memory of life
Wandering into the endless depths of the dying horizon
to disappear in the raging funeral snowfall
In obscurity, encircled by the coiling shapes in ice
with eyes staring into the silent infinity where eternity awaits...
