A vial is shattered in anguish
the blood cherished in the glass
Shall run free once again
Like years ago in the veins of a cursed Emperor

Standing aghast by the rebirth
the blood runs on the seams
Soul expurgated by the spell
of the immense worship to the dark one

Once feared mark of Satan engraved
solely to the chest of the devotee
a dying memory of a shadow order
now sown again as a seen for a new temple
