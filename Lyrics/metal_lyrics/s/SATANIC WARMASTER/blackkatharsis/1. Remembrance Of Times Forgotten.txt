A depressed soul infested with black hate
within the chamber where emotions have died
Sadness and sorrow left behind only ruin
A depraved shell resting in silence

Remembrance of the times long forgotten
From those times the soul still holds the ashes
Like the last remains of human feelings
They smolder to light again as a new king

Seen from the tower in the nightly hours
a shining beyond the clouds
Remembrance of times forgotten
Awaiting their return...
