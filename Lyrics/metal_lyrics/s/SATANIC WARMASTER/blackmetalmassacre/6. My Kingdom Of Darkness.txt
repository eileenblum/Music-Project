This sunless landscape of my realm before my eyes
Like and untouched creation from the darkest ancient times
There, where the raven flies, lie the gates to my kingdom
Forgotten and buried in snow behind these lifeless trees

My kingdom, where my throne is eternal
Where my reign is lonely in silence
Where the bleak sky is guarded by the ravens
In my kingdom of darkness

This night-time, in solitude with all my deepest thoughts
The stars in the sky as my only light and company
Like a thousand eyes of Lucifer, watching over me
Enlightening my journey across this cold domain

My kingdom, where my throne is eternal
For centuries before me it has stood
When I am gone, it shall still remain
My kingdom of darkness-
