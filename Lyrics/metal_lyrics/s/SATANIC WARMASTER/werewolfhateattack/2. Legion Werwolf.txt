Satanic warlegions, our sign -the horns of the goat
Battlefiels of blood, the temples ablaze in the dark
Wolfish songs of fight, desecration and triumph
Banner of blood and honour,
the natural way of the strong

Legion Werwolf

Black triumphant hordes, all devouring flame of Satan
Blood and sweat of combat, the scent of the new dawn
Old mother-serpent, our spirit from the stars
The fist of the conqueror, the hammer of our supremacy

Legion Werwolf

The night and the fog
Blood of the holy gives life
to the seeds new aeon of Satan
Open tomb, Violated grave
Profaned remnants of the christian god killed by
Legion Werwolf
