Inside my chamber illuminated by candlelight
The unholy shadows of my memories slowly dance
Reminding of a time of arrogance and hate
Of a diabolical war that once more shall be

A hate unfolded from the old black songs of evil
To command the destruction of the foul crucifix
A weapon forged from true unholy Black Metal
From which the flames blazed in the western sky in the spring of 1992
