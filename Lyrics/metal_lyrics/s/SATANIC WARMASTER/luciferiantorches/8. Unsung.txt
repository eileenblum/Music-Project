When a Black Cross Hangs from the Sky
Painted with the Blood of a Thousand Angels
Unholy Winds of Funeral Cry
The Gospel of Merciless Armageddon

Cut Wings of Cherubs fall from the Sky
Like a Snow of Endless Death
The End of All Prayers for Redemption
Now Heard only by Dismembered Ears

On the Throne of the Black Horns
Lies now the Dominance of this world
In the Eyes of the Sinful Master
Burns a Fire of Humanity's Pyre

Crucified in Reverse to Mock Life's Worth
Raped by a Black Monolith from the Earth
Cut Throats that Bleed a River of Red
That Drowns all Holyness' Remnants

Endless. Darkness. Extermination. Death
