Winter Darkness Eternal Night
Silent Throne to Us
To walk the Funeral Coldness
In the Light of Satan's Eye

My Eyes are like Shadows
My Heart - Longing for Winter

The Blinded Eye of the Sun
Cries no more it's Tears of Fire
And the Lunar Eye of Satan
Gazes in Solemn Radiance
My Throne - Sunless and Dead
And the Flowers... gone.
