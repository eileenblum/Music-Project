Sieg Heil! The sign of our cross rises
The age of fire and retribution is upon us
Shadow resistance, the order of hate
Against the cross that has oppressed us for so long

Torching the Jewish creation
Laughing on their despair when they cry
Blood shall be our guide - On the battlefield
Where the churches burn bright into the night

We are the black wolves of blood and iron
Our hunger grows with the stench of holy blood
To feel is no remorse is our natural born pride
Might is right, and to devour those who are weak

Immortal hate, a hammer that smashes the skull
The skull of the false prophet of christian belief
Shadow resistance, the order of hate
Against the cross that has oppressed us for so long
