Our forefathers fought for our land
With power and steel, swords in hand
Pagan blood was strong in their hearts
Given by the gods to reach the stars

Heathen blood, the guide of the strong
Never lets our hearts guide us wrong
Vengeance and honour, forever they reign
Our might was received through war and pain
