IN THE DIM OBSCURITY OF THE ECLIPSE
A XENOLITH OF PURE BLACKNESS
SPEARS INTO HEAVEN
FROM THE LIGHT OF SATAN'S EYE

MY EYES STARE INTO THE SHADOW
MY HEART HUNGERS FOR WINTER

THE IMPALED QUINTESSENCE OF GRACE
TAINTED BY THE BLOOD OF THE ANGELS
FORLORN INTO FROST
IN THE SHADOW OF SATAN'S WINGS

MY GLARE, LOVELESS AND DEAD
AND THE FLOWERS... GONE
