LURKING THROUGH
VAST DISMAL FORESTS
TOWARDS THE HEART
OF MY SHADOW
THIS QUEST
FOR A TWILIGHT CATHEDRA
MY MOONLIT CROWN

LET THE STARS SHINE UNTO ME
ADORN MY SPECTRAL GAUNTLETS
A WOLFISH KHAN OF A LORN PALACE
THE CRUX OF MY STRIFE

FULLMOON HORDES CHANT THEIR HOLOCAUST SPELLS
IN TAUNT FOR THE SLOW DEATH OF GRACE
MYSTERIES AND TRADITION BREATH INTO ME
WHEN THE THUNDERS HAIL MY LUCIFERIAN BLOOD

LANDSCAPES OF SHIMMERING FROST
HAMMERED INTO IMMORTAL SUPREMACY
TO WITHSTAND THE TRIAL OF TIME
MY LUMINOUS SPHERE

LET THE FLAME OF SATAN
GNASH THESE RUNES ON MY BLADE
A WOLFISH KHAN OF A LORN PALACE
THE CRUX OF MY STRIFE

FULLMOON HORDES CHANT THEIR HOLOCAUST SPELLS
IN TAUNT FOR THE SLOW DEATH OF GRACE
MYSTERIES AND TRADITION BREATH INTO ME
WHEN THE THUNDERS HAIL MY LUCIFERIAN BLOOD
