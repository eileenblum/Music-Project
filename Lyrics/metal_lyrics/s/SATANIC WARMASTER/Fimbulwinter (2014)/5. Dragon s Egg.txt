IN DISMAL TIMES OF TWILIGHT
EARTH'S CRYSTALS WERE FUCKED
INJECTED WITH DEVIL'S FIRE
THE DRAGON'S EGG

A PHANTASM OF A SOMBER AGE
WHEN TYPHOONS ROARED
AND CARRIED THE FIREHEART
TO BRAND THE EARTH

INSIDE A STORM OF EMBERS
CARRIED BY A GRUESOME VOICE
BLAZE OF EXTERMINATION
THE DEATHWINGED

THOSE WHO ONCE CIRCLED
THE MOUNTAINS
WITH MIST AND LIGHTNING
AND SANG IN A GRUESOME VOICE
THE WILDFIRE ARIAS OF ORDEAL

PYRE'S REFLECTION
FROM PAGAN TALES
THE ORDINANCE OF FIRE
DEMONIC ENDLESS FLAME
