Black Metal is War
The glare of churches burning in the night
The glow of nails and steel in the darkness
Nordic blood that boils with hatred is the knife
That slits the throat of the christian god...

Eliterian tyranny, strife for a revolution
Is the path towards the new black order
To fight for the kult is not the way of the weak
We reign with the iron fist of tyranny and the will to power...
