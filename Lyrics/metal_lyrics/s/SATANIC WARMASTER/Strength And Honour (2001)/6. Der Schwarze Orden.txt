In the forest of broken crosses
The aryan wind has blown
The blazing torch of death's majesty
Reflected on the skull

Torching winds of war
The semite creation in ashes
The remains blown away to the past
Of the new Hyperborean order

Das Schwarze Orden
Das Zeichen der Sonne am Horizon!

And the star that lights the night
Is the eye of the one with horns

Horizon engulfed in red clouds
A thundering roar as the star of david is crushed
The slow death of degeneration
A new order of wisdom is at hand
