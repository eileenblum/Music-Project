Reign of tyranny, of magick and strength
Enthroned Aryan spirit the resurrection of our reich
Valour of pagan Europe
War and warrior's blood
We know that our destiny lies in the forgotten stars...

Nordic Blood.
The howling wolves in the night
The forests caress the spirit long forgotten
The time of retribution is at hand, with iron and hate
You are the iron youth that will set our minds free.
