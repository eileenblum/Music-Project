[by Akhtya Nachttoter of Black Funeral]

Thou Evil Spirit, Thou fever of the desert
Gather unto this circle
My blood I offer, feed and grow strong
Enter my flesh we shall dwell as one
The moon eclipsed, darkness enthroned
The primal serpent stirs
Awaken hordes long sleeping

Utug-Hul, A-La-Hul, Gidim-Hul
Messanger of Tiamat
Arise through me, passions of darkness

Ea, King of the Deep
Banish them not, these phantoms of the abyss
The Blood I offer, my life essence
That I may bring them within
To devour in time

Gaining the essence of their spirit
Ancient memories awakened in primal sleep
Atavistic horror, flesh cloaked in shadow
Ea, Lord of the Deep, banish them not

Utug-Hul, A-La-Hul, Gidim-Hul
Messanger of Tiamat
Arise through me, passions of darkness
