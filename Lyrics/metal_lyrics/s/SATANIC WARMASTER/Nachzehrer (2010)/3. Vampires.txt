Sorrow rides out
as spectral knights
A wind of grief
from an open coffin
When the bells of funeral chime
through the nightfall
A black star rises
at the final twilight

Gargle the blood
Spit the cruor

From beyond darkness
A revenant blaze
Fire of conflagration
Burns in empty eyes
Disgusting tongues
That lick your face
In morbid hunger
When you sleep

Gargle the blood
Spit the cruor

Sacrifice
To end your life
Carnage
To light the fire
And forever
We rule the night
All exultant
Vampires

We are the worms that crawl
on the broken wings of an angel

Gargle the blood
Spit the cruor

Sacrifice
To end your life
Carnage
To light the fire
And forever
We rule the night
All exultant
Vampires
