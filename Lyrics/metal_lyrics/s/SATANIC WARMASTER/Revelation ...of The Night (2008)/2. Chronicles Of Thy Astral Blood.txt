Though I search the key
To open the eternal kingdom
A world of pain and bloody agony.
Where shadows dance towards the white mist.

Gazing at the sky to find the way.
To escape from this world.

The blood is coming from the sky.
It recover the wasted land.
All is now only desolation.

La nuit laisse place a une eternelle agonie.
Je sent la mort couler dans mes veines.

I penetrate the night.
My eyes are now closed.
The pain is now a pleasure.
All is wasted now.
Death is our realm.
Blood... Sang et Larmes.
