Werewolf legions awakened to a black crusade
To break from the chains and to emerge in combat
Seeking fulfillment in death's cold arms
And rejoice a life of strife with all it's gifts

Like and explosion from earth's deepest core
In a pillar of hellish scorching fire
The sirens howl to call for total destruction
A new reign of iron will and instinct must prevail

Into the battlefield
Into the war
In a storm of blood and fire, our glory is revealed
All your dreams denounced and drowned in gore

On the deep snow in the blackest final winter
Where the paws of the beasts have trodden
The flowers of a new black order shall bloom
In Lucifer's endless morbid grace

Into the battlefield
Into the war
In a storm of blood and fire, our glory is revealed
All your dreams denounced and drowned in gore

Into the battlefield
Into the war
In a storm of blood and fire, our glory is revealed
All your dreams denounced and drowned in gore
