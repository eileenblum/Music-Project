A black book of depraved old mysteries
Bloodstained black cloth that covers the altar
Clad in thick robes to conceal the flesh
of a man-god I was bound to be

The abyss winds return
on the hour of revelations
Conspiracy of homodeus and Satan

A balance of power that was shattered
with the spreading of the jew disease
Shall be undone with our rites

and the persistence to reverse
the unnatural reign of christianity

As the chant of our discontent
echoes to the world
A human is reborn
and the highest law shall be
written with a Luciferian sword
to the flesh of god's corpse

[Satanic Warmaster 8.12.2002]
