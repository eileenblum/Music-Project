Past the end of life
my torments ever grow
Blood on my knife
mutilated self to show

My torments...

Never forget cries
of anxiety to serve
Satan and deny the lies
for eternity they burn

Satan master I believe
in the triumph of will
That the strong shall see
the new dawn rising
with my torments...

[Satanic Warmaster 8.12.2002]
