Terror night â we're ready!
for murder, unholiness sermon
tortures begin â in the night
in the blackness grows the seed
of the legions' remains

Come tonight!

Black winds if morbid funeral
forever they cry out in pain
calling the disciples of the
dragon and the impaler
to gather under the banner
of the black holocaust

[Satanic Warmaster 27.1.2003]
