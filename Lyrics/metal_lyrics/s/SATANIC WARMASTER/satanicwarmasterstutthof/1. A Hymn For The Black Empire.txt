I hail you, king of the night
in your name I spill the blood
to seal your conspiracy in eternity
for the death of all (false) light and life...

In glory I praise you, Master
let me be at one with your might
so that these eyes once could see
the ashes of god's creation and a new age to be...

For the glory of Satan
For the light of Lucifer
I sing this song in your name
A hymn for your Black Empire...
