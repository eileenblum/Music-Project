[November 2004 / January 2005]

Born from the blood that was carried through time
Encircling the true essence of the wolf
To reap the weak as a cursed shadow in the night
And let their death ornament the snow

When the fullmoon shines, the werewolf strikes
The human fear sings my song
When carelian forests echoe with your death
The power is regained by the strong

Singing ---- ---- - psalms to scourge ------ god
To make his children rot and hurt
Burning the chapels so their prayers cannot be heard
To leave them as kill for our knives

When the fullmoon shines, the werewolf strikes
The human fear sings my song
When carelian forests echoe with your death
The spirit is regained by the aware

To see their altars turned to dust - Is a dream becoming reality
To see their cross crumbling to rust - Forgotten to void for eternity

The rite of white man reborn - From false light into darkness
That holds the true light in scorn - The Carelian Satanist Madness

When their children crawl in broken glass
The human torment carries my name
When the embers breed a new black order
The darkness reveals the true light

When the fullmoon shines, the werewolf strikes
The human fear sings my song
When carelian forests echoe with your death
The world is regained by the Satan

The rite of white man reborn - From false light into darkness
That holds the true light in scorn - The Carelian Satanist Madness...
