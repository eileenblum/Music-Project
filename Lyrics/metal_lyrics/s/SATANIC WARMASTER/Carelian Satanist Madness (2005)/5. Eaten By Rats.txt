[Februay 2005]

Moist walls, embraced by putrid stench
Dark hallways, where echoe silent squeaks
The rhythm of dripping water calls to morbid dance
...of the contagious children of the crypt

Darkness of the dungeon, womb of the deceased
Stealthy heralds, sharpening the scythe of plague
The parade of creeping shadows, like a living floor
A carpet of sharp teeth and black filthy hair

Here the bones lie, like fallen pillars of ivory
Hundreds of hungry red eyes, slithering tails and poisoned teeth
Only death is real
Eaten by rats

Deep down enshrined inside the walls of stone
Black death's reflection in a pair of red eyes
Around each corner, awaiting to inject painful death
for them to devour the poisoned human flesh...

Here the bones lie, like fallen pillars of ivory
Hundreds of hungry red eyes, slithering tails and poisoned teeth
Only death is real
Eaten by rats...
