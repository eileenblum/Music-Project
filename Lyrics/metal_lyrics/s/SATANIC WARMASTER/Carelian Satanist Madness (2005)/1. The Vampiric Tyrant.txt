[February 2005]

Mountainsides clad in cold mist
Damned land of mortal terror
Ghastly temples of forests and ruins
In the kingdom of evil souls

In the blackest evil night...
Vampire sucking blood
As a gestalt of the vampire
The pure perfect evil to be one with Satan
The phantom of the night - Strigoi...

Once these plains witnessed the impalements
When sub-human life fell into decline
The envoy of Satan, the son of the dragon
Cruel tyrant for the living death to conceive

In the blackest evil night...
Vampire sucking blood
As a gestalt of the vampire
The pure perfect evil to be one with Satan
The phantom of the night - Vrolok...
