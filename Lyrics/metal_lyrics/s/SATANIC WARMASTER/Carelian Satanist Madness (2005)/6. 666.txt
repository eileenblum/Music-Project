[1995]

With rituals of evil wisdom
Grim icestorms take me
To the skies, storming black
Like dragon I fly, I desecrate...

I hold the sign of evil...

I ride the winds of holocaust
Black sword in hand, with witching rage
Wings of darkness surround me
In this ravaged realm, I desecrate...

I hold the sign of evil...
