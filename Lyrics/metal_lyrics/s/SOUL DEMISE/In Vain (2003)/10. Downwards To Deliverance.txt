Sitting imprisoned in a chair
Only suicide can liberate me
Set me free from this slavery
Visions of death show me the way

If I could escape this vicious circle
To experience the joy of healthiness

Doomed to death sinister thoughts
I'm a prisoner in myself
Stolen is the power of my limbs
Dreams about death in me

In me

Motionless tied to a chair
Try to escape this slavery
Sickness is imprisoning me
Thoughts about suicide arise
I'm falling

The stench of death is in the air
Awakening in emptiness
The burden is gone, my soul is free
Open my eyes but I can't see

An unknown place
Don't want back to this occurrence
The path to freedom I will explore

The stench of death is in the air
Drifting without control to the end
Death's hand had pushed me down
Down into the abyss of nothingness

Path to freedom I will explore
Awaiting reception into hell
If I could escape this vicious circle
To experience the joy of healthiness
