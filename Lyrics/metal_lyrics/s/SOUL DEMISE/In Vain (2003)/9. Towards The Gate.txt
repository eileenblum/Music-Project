Ageless during self-intoxicaton
Chaotic and loose the authority I'm under
Carried by the clouds of thoughts
Towards the gate of being

One's own flesh and blood
Disfigured by light and shadows
Mirror's power represses me
Exposure in a soft way

To receive this division
An eternityfor time to pass by
Pleasure instead of womb fruit's course
A climax but not the wise seed

The price of dwelling twosomeness
Unappreciated, burnt, the true self
Neither realized what is real
Nor am I untouchable

Intoxication by sweet sounds in my head
Shall never end, shall never pass away
The second self was born thereby
I'll never miss the mirror's image

Towards the gate

Disfigured by light and shadows
Mirror's power represses me
Exposure in a soft way
