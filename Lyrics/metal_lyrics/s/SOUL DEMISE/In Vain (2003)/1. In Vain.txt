You feel the power in your limbs
Feel the power in your veins
Heading for some other luxuries
Something you do again and again
Haven't you been told for ages
Haven't you been told long ago
That the treasures hoarded up in earth
On your final path they can not follow

Never ever wasted a single thought
On higher values
Like a mirror of society
You reflect a form of life
Obvious to me

All your greedy efforts
Haven't you been told for ages
Haven't you been told long ago
That the treasures hoarded up in earth

I hate your equals - the likes of you
Don't appreciate - any of you

[Chorus]
All of your low motives
Are damned and in vain
All your greedy efforts
Forever in vain

Never, ever
Never ever wasted a single thought
On higher values
Like a mirror of society
All of your low motives
Are damned and in vain
All your greedy efforts
Forever in vain, in vain
Forever in vain
