The human race seems to be damned
Existence means just agony!

Money is all that counts
Greed rules our lives
We exploit our planet
The human race seems to be damned
Existence means just agony!

We don't fucking care,
Behave like guests,
Behave like friends,
Use our intelligence.
We simply act like imbeciles

Hatred and selfishness rule our lives
So keen on profits - I can't believe

Eventually we'll die
Slowly committing suicide
Eventually we'll die
Eventually we're dead

Shouldn't we practice love and peace,
Help each other, stop the madness
Shall we finally exterminate ourselves

Why don't we behave like guests
Why don't we behave like friends
Why don't we use our brain
Why do we act like imbeciles

Why is money so important
Why does greed rule our lives
Why do we exploit our planet
Why don't we fucking care
