I don't understand
You can twist it as you want
Nobody gets the point
Laughing, you failed to see the intent
Trampling on evolutions development

But still you're satisfied
And not prepared
The hour is late and time is flying
Can't avoid fucking
Show me the button you can set time with
Pain

Frankness, a miracle to you
Narrow minded like a wall
Subjected to your own
Standard
You're not listening at all

[Bridge]
Impossible, this game is
Over your dreams
Your visual hunch of what is right
Has to give way to your vanity

Unanswered questions remain
Do sound vibrations reach your ears?
The burden, too heavy for your shoulders
No fun 'cause you drive me crazy
