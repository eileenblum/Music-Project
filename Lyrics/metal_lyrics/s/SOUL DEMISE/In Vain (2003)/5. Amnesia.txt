Lost my memory, as words out of my mouth
Just odd words without sense
A punch was the cause
Tell me, who I am
Able to travel through the time
Yet bounded on the spot
Able to move through bodies
Yet prisoned like in a cell

Amnesia
I've been wandering through death valley
Hear my call
Can feel the sun and moon's rays
Help me come at all
My hands raised towards the wall
To break it down forever
Still waiting for the day and time
So we can come together

My very will is stronger than death
Managing it will be my goal
Going to free me from this misery
Too much of an effort to you alone
Eternally prisoned in time and space
In a dimension
