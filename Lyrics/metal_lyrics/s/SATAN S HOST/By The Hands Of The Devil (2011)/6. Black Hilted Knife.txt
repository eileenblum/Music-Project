Dragons whisper
Demonic silence
Within the brimstone burn
Scales eclipse from
The coiled serpent
Leviathan! 

Feel the blade taste the steel
Accept the wound
That never heals
Banished into this midnight
A weapon with eternal power
Strength beyond all offerings
Unholy union Sameal Lilith
Thy mastery evolved mankind
As we unleash
These ancient demons

These words I do evoke
Beyond the great divide
We open portals
Undead awakening
Spirits consuming flames
Whisper Hells gates opening
The drudge comes to life
Now become before mine eyes

17 candles burning
On this alter unseen
Silence angry silence
Bestow my offering

Black hilted knife
Conjuring source of black flame
Black hilted knife
Controlling armies unseen
Black hilted knife
Doors forever opening
Black hilted knife

In a darkened grave
Burning hearts of hell
These rituals
Enchanting spells
In living dreams
Doors swing open wide
Spirits of unrest
Break thru from the other side

I can feel them
Without seeing them
As the doors open wide

Black spirits I command
From the world sights unseen
Black spirits I command
From the world sights unseen

Blackâ¦ Hilâ¦ Tedâ¦
Blackâ¦ Hilâ¦ Tedâ¦ 
Blackâ¦ Hilâ¦ Tedâ¦
Blackâ¦ Hilâ¦ Tedâ¦ 
Blackâ¦ Hilâ¦ Tedâ¦ KNIFE! 

Blackâ¦ Hilâ¦ Tedâ¦
Blackâ¦ Hilâ¦ Tedâ¦
