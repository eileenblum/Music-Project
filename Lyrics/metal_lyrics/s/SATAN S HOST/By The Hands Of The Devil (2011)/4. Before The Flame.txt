Reverberations
Consecrations
Imaginations
We do invoke! 

Awaken all unholy
Appear now in your
Devilish charm
By the blood of all that is wicked
Scepter of the Antichrist
Deformed
Dispersed
In the eyes of all creation
Adversary discourse of reason Now set free

Behold this destruction of grace
Fall slaves within
Inferior Worlds

As the blood through corruption
Destroys the grain of society
Drawn forth into action
Seminal virtue
Eagles of the Dead
Consume the carcass of your god
As they do devour all presence

Desires of the Damned
Revenges of the wickedness
Wandering shadows
Behold thy guest of Hell

Approach ye now
Stand before the Flame
Infernal offerings
All creatures shall be bound

Stand Before the Flame
Profanely inclined
Commerce of the flesh
In darkness we shall bind

For those who seek the truth
In the fires they shall find
Oracles of knowledge
Divine powers, purified mind

Incantations
Conjurations
Creator of the night
Perilous
Passions
Reprehending debauchery

Man, in whose soul
Is forged in divinity
Man, in whose soul
Is sealed for eternity
Man, whose soul
Is created from dust
Man, whose soul
Was unleashed in Hell

Spring forth into Hell! 

Knowledge for Centuries
Hidden agenda from the past
Succession of ages
Falling upon Almutel
Observation, 
Ascendant calculations
Desirous of binding
Ready obedience

Governors ministering spirits
Keepers of these sacred secrets
We rise of swords and fight
Vengeance, Evil, 
Black Brotherhood
In the veins of the wicked
Strength, valor, eternal might
Bestow your unholy allegiance
Within this ritual, this hour, 
this night
