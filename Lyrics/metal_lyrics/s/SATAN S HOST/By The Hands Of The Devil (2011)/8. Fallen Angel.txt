Before the dawning of the sun
There was an angel
Who stood above them all
He was a bright and shining star
The gifted one
The ever present

Fallen, Fallen Angel
You are the master of mankind
Fallen one, down trodden one. 
Lead us all into temptation

Crowned in glory once above
He stole the only thing
That ever really mattered
Wanted power wanted love
I wanted it all
And now I have you

Unto us all
Sin is born
Through us all
Sin is won

Fallen One, Down Trodden One
You are the master of mankind
Fallen, Fallen Angel
Subtle whisper in our minds
