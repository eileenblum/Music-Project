Centuries past beyond the grave
We have come to conquer
Your ungodly souls

Openers of the way
Across these decayed lands
Darkness transcends forever
Upon the footsteps of the damned
As we shatter the seas of glass
Beyond all eternity

Seventh Tower
Seventh Key
Seventh Tower of Satan

The wicked ones shall rise
Seventh tower of Hell
Seven Towers of Satan

We take this walk of the damned
Echoing this sacred voice
On the wings of MALEKTAUS
We open Hells burning gate
Revival fears beyond conception

Revival- Liberation
Revival- Invoke New Laws
Revival- Liberation
Revival- Freedom

Infused by the night
Demonic entities
Celestial interventions
By the words of the Peacock God
Our blood burns as fire
Beyond the night sky

Air, Water, Earth, Fire
Burning Illumination

Revival, Freedom, Liberation
Seventh Towers of Satan

Revival- Revival
Revival- Revival
Seven Towers of Satan
