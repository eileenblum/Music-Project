Within these fires--
Shaitan--arise
From where Shades
Of the tomb do gather
In the Devilâs Name
I conjure thee
Awaken Dark entities
From beyond
This vortex bending time
Cross fourth these gates
As we do consume the Afterlife

Born of the Witches blood
Under dark flames
From the forged Divine creations
I shall become in your name
As does the spark fly
Blood dripping kiss
Thy serpents tongue

Crimson flame
Horned shape shifter
In thy Hands- I open these books
Wherein ancient shades
Rule dreaming
Let me see beyond creation

Dark spirits-Illumination
Lord of Beast- Transformation
Cloak of darkness- Recreation
Shadows beyond life

Shades awakened beyond light
The dead have left their tombs
The fallen rise from graves
In darkness they shall call
Shades rise dusk till dawn
Spirits Reborn in Life
By the Hands of the Devil Theyâre born
Shades of the Unlight

[Pre Chorus]

[Outro]
We drink of wisdom,
We bleed of strength
Shades spirits of the dead
We welcome thee

Spirits undead-
Come into this life
Spirits awaken us
One star in sight
Shades divine
Spirits of the dead
Shades sacred fires
As we were born

Casting the shadow of shadows
Bursting beyond dimensions
Shades awaken
Creatures beyond the night
Casting the shadow of shadows
Bursting beyond dimensions
Shades awaken
Creatures beyond the night side
Shades awaken
The fallen rise from graves
Shades awaken
Divine spirits of the dead

Spirit of vengeance-Spirit of truth
Spirit undead beyond all creation
Spirit of Metal- Spirit of Hell
Spirit of burning
Hearts and valor
Spirit of fire- Spirit of flame
Spirit who crossed veils unseen
Spirits we guide thee
Unto our world
Shades Dark secrets of the dead
