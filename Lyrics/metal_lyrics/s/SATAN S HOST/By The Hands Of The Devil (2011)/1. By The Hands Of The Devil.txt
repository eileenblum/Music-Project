In the eyes of history
One voice has stood defiant
Descendant of Sumerian blood
The Dark Lord, the Devil

Deviant, who stands in defiance
Sinister Black hearted infamous
One world in revolution
By the thorns of anarchy

Exposing Historyâs lies
To those who are brave enough
Discipleâs bloodline of Satan
Thus we are forever free

Wicked in the eyes of salvation
Bringer of torment blasphemy
Keeper in the realms of silence
Destroyer to religious doctrine

Nocturnal bloodlines
Passed down for centuries
Hidden knowledge
Has been concealed
Damnation forged in life
The walls of truth
Come crashing down

By the Hands of the Devil
Dissolving consciousness
The framework for mankind
To invoke new laws
Hellfire will command
Renouncing of all gods
Recognizing fallacies

Fear in the eyes of whatâs holy
Eliminate to their so called truth
Destroy all those religious
Consumer of all their faith

By the Hands of the Devil
Dissolving consciousness
Hellfire will command
Renouncing of all gods
Recognizing fallacies

Exposing lies that transcend time
By the Hands of the Devil
We set a fire within the mind
Forge the path, Awaken

Embodiment of Evil
The nightmare you despised
Forbidden proclamation
Lead to your demise
As the walls crumble down
And the questions of your faith
Giving no real answers
As the truth slips away

Gates of Hell manifest thyself
By the Hands of the Devil
Within this body I have prepared
Exposing lies
That transcends time
By the Hands of the Devil
Evil Divine!
