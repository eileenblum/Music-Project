Unworthy children of god
By my hands shall they bleed
yearning for the wetting at my blade
Such wrath did consume me

Mine is the power of creation
Forbidden rift within our sight
Entrance to insure our future
To bring to being our champion race

I shall give rise to a new race
By my hand shall be a worthy people
Why yet are they in infancy
As children, savages filled with potential

I strike upon Adonai Yahweh
Ripping out the order of creation
I did consume in one serpent gulp
To the deep veil my black despair

Darkness is but an absence of light
Evil is not such a thing you imagine

This is what I sought in the dark realm!
I cam to contemplate what might be done
And now I do perceive the way to advance
As the shores of this unsunned sea

Alleviate my wrath
Cultivate this crime yet further
I shall destroy you
Pre-dating god
More dreadful than dragon's fire
Is not a burden to be born
Repent this heresy
Pre-dating god, Pre-dating god, Pre-dating god!

Cultivate this crime yet further

Pre-dating god
More dreadful than dragon's fire
Is not a burden to be born
Repent this heresy
Pre-dating god, Pre-dating god, Pre-dating god!

Evolution - Reconstitution - one step closer
Pre-dating god
Revolution - Execution - to the truth
Pre-dating god, Pre-dating god, Pre-dating god!
