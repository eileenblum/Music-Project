As the Dead, they Sleep
As the Dead, they Sleep

In living dreams, transcending beyond all time
Constellations, collapse within the mind

As the Dead, they Sleep
As the Dead, they Sleep

Inner being, becomes me
Bestow within, power unforeseen
Collective knowledge, now dispelled
Truth be known, all lies unveiled

Calling forth from the great Abyss
Reaching out with a blazing fist

Time stands still, reality now gone
Trembling within, all right is wrong

As the Dead, they Sleep
As the Dead, they Sleep

Whispers in the darkness, closer to me
Willing to unite, my soul with thee

Take this vessel, do what thou wilt
One voice, one vision, till all truth revealed

As the Dead, I now Sleep
Damnation, a cruel curse before the grave
Temptation that only leads 6 feet underground
The Dead-Demonic prophesy
Ancient whispers crackling thunder lightning
As the Dead-Demonic prophesy, ancient whispers of old

In living dreams, transcending beyond all time
Constellations, collapse within the mind

As the Dead, they Sleep
As the Dead, they Sleep

Take this vessel, do what thou wilt
One voice, one vision, till all truth revealed

In living dreams, transcending beyond all time
Constellations, collapse within the mind

Panic bound, anxiety
Fright rules your life for eternity
Is bound forever in torment!
As the Dead, they Sleep

Whispers in the darkness, closer to me
Willing to unite, my soul with thee
