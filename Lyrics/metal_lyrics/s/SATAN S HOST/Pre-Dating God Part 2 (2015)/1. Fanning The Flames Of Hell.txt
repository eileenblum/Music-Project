Sacraments of impurity
The seeds that rule life
Sacred are the constellations
Under which you were born unto life

Bleeding far deep upon destructive
A curse becomes the amulet of Hell
Dedicating, oscillating
Consciousness within the mind

Fanning the Flames of Hell, rising within the ashes
Fanning the Flames of Hell, reclaiming our unholy throne

Once we tried to bring peace
Only to be rejected
Foring our will into stell
So became the hands of Death

Visions call the ancients
Into a world once divine
Shadowed specters of eternity
Bringing light into the blind

Fanning the Flames of Hell, rising within the ashes
Fanning the Flames of Hell, reclaiming our unholy throne

I grace the altar with righteous virgin blood
Break the veil of innocence
Defiled and corrupt, to see beyond Death's curtain, return the Magick lost
Free the mind, expose the blind and pay the final cost

In victory we stand, under the gleam of the sword

Sinister Ocraraine empowerment
Cascading across the lands
Blasphemous, infernal, dedication, commanding
Those of the left hand
Those of the left hand

Fanning the Flames of Hell, rising within the ashes
Fanning the Flames of Hell, reclaiming our unholy throne

I grace the altar with righteous virgin blood
Break the veil of innocence
Defiled and corrupt, to see beyond Death's curtain, return the Magick lost
Free the mind, expose the blind and pay the final cost

Fanning the Flames of Hell
Fanning the Flames of Hell
Fanning the Flames of Hell

Sacraments of impurity
The seeds that rule life
Sacred are the constellations
Under which you were born unto life
