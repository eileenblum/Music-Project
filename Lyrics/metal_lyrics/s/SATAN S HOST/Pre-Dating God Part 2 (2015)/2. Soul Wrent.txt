Calling for the vipers of Hell, tormentor of the flesh
I do the bidding of which you commands, direct me to the path
Infernal Magick awakening, the Beast inside these bones
Spill the blood of innocence lost, upon thy ungodly throne
Where you now reign

Take me now to do thy will
Fill this vessel full
The things at which I've seen and done
Has torn my very soul into dust
Into dust, into dust

Cause me to fall into the great Abyss
Cause to me to fall never more will I resist
Cause me to fall into the great Abyss
Cause to me to fall never more will I resist
Claw at my soul to open and see inside
Claw at my soul never again to hide away from you

Come inside fill me now
Take place of this nothingness
Come to me unholy one
My soul you shall possess
This very night

Cause me to fall into the great Abyss
Cause to me to fall never more will I resist
Claw at my soul to open and see inside
Claw at my soul never again to hide away from you

Take me now - now that my Soul is Wrent
Take me now - now that my body is spent
Take me now - now that my Soul is Wrent
Take me now - now that my body is spent

I do the bidding of which thee commands, direct me to the path
Infernal Magick awakening, the Beast inside thses bones
Spill the blood of innocence lost, upon thy ungodly throne
Where you now reign

Cause me to fall into the great Abyss
Cause to me to fall never more will I resist
Claw at my soul to open and see inside
Claw at my soul never again to hide away from you
