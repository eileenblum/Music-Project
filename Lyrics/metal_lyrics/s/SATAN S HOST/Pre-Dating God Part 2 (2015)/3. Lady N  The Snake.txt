There was this fair lady
Created equally to man
She was told to bend her will
to heed to his every need
Command to lie beneath him
In rage she flew from the garden

Lady n' the Snake, comes to you in the night
Lady n' the Snake, drinks the stolen blood
Lady n' the Snake, harming those with child
Lady n' the Snake, unholy tree of life

Never to be told what to do
The Snake enters her womb
Samael begets willing Lilith
Mother of the demons
A wrath of vengeance and hate
To torment the children of man

Lady n' the Snake, comes to you in the night
Lady n' the Snake, drinks the stolen blood
Lady n' the Snake, harming those with child
Lady n' the Snake, unholy tree of life

Free of original sin
Inanna enters the seventh gate
Resurrected by Enki
With you taking her place in Hell

"I am the harlot of Jerusalem
One hundred a day
I bore the Lilim
All newborns charged to me
An amulet to spare their lives
Spitefully I turned on my own
And eat their infernal souls"

The wife of Death
Succubus of the night
Murder of infants
Mysterious hold Lilith
Lady n' the Snake

The Dark moon in dim twilight
Pre-dating any god all worshiped
Great Goddess of the Earth
Ruling a hundred thousand years
Pushed out by the false lords
Black Madonna's still bear witness
