Descending in the shadow of Osiris
Traveling far beyond these tunnels of Set
Hand in hand we walk with Anubis
Far beyond these ancient shrines

We are the children of this flaming star
Split between dimensions across space and time
Even as two dark stars crashed together
We rekindled the fire of all things Evil and divine

Then there was born what is the horror or time
When all things are no longer absolute
Divided became the dark upon the light
As the foul of stain became the storm of star within the sky

Forever darkness has fought the light
Order became chaos, the great divide
Imperfection was born into all living things
As Death's wings consumed the fragile rift called time

Arcane perfection, Baphomet, Capricornus liberty
He is the Devil, Satan or Hadit Ayin, the EYE

Upon the dead making empty eyes
And bones fleshless from the fight
Eyes that saw such sorrow
Made blind themselves with tears

Won by the blood of the fallen
To cast aside their strength courage
Would be treachery to their noble ghast
Descending in the Shadow of Osiris

Arcane perfection, Baphomet, Capricornus liberty
He is the Devil, Satan or Hadit Ayin, the EYE

Upon the dead making empty eyes
And bones fleshless from the fight
Eyes that saw such sorrow
Made blind themselves with tears

To fight beyond the settin sun
Will lose that which is now one

And what distinctions we have marked
Will be eroded by the dawn

Loard Satan commander of our hearts
We'll have Shedim discharge their duty
Levying a tax of blood this day
My eyes count 3 foes dead, there so called trinity

We are the children of this flaming star
Split between dimensions across space and time
Even as two dark stars crashed together
We rekindled the fire of all things Evil and divine

Won by the blood of the fallen
To cast aside their strength courage
Would be treachery to their noble ghast
Descending in the Shadow of Osiris
Descending in the Shadow of Osiris
