Death! Awaken!!
Metal From Hell,
Where Evil Dwells.
Eeeaaaggghhh...Metal From Hell.
Metal From Hell...Hell.
Metallic Battalions declare Raging War,
We shall take this World in our hands.
Prepare now the Alter,
Bell, Book, Dagger and Scourge.
Supreme Ritual where All Hell is at Command.
Devils Dance at moonlight,
Hear their Fires Roar.
Corrupt All Nations at Midnight,
Weâre the Vicious Dogs of War.
Ten-thousand Warriors Pounding,
Metal From Hell.
Screaming arise,
A Land where Satan Dwells.
We shall Survive unto the end
As Luciferâs Friend.
Weâre the Power
Weâre the Force.
Weâre Metal,
Metal From Hell.
Weâre the Power
Weâre the Force.
Weâre Metal,
Metal From Hell.

Soldiers of Fortune,
We March for the Anti-Christ.
Each Warrior show Satansâ Sign.
The smell of rotting flesh,
A wasteland full of Death.
Proclaiming we form a sacrifice.
Devilâs dance at moonlight,
Hear their Fires Roar.
Corrupt All Nations at midnight,
The Vicious Dogs of War!
Ten thousand Warriors Pounding ,
Metal From Hell.
Screaming arise,
A Land where Satan Dwells.
We shall Survive unto the End
As Luciferâs Friend.
Weâre Metal,
Metal from Hell.
Where Evil,
Evil Dwells.
