Planets align on this night,
Of the Evil Walpurgisnacht.
Where all Warriors
Around this World ,
Unite and Bind.

Gathered around a Ring of Fire,
Inner Demon Light.
Sacred Wisdom, Centuries Past,
Burning Forever Bright.
Legions of Darkness Arise,
Living Eternal.
Where Shadows Come to Life,
Universal Will.

RRRAAAHHHhhhh, Whaaaaaahhhhhh...
RRRAAAHHhhhh, Whaaaaaahhhhhh...

From around this World,
And Beyond the Gates of Hell...
Our Infernal Calling.

Before the birth of man,
Inner Demon-Light.
Our inner fire gem,
Burning forever bright.
From now till end of dawn,
Living Eternal.
Weâre All Beyond the Gates of Hell.

Cosmic consciousness,
Our Universal Will.
Transcending space
As time creates.
Theomorphism,
Becoming Godhead.
Weâre at the moment of death,
Where life passes.

From around this World,
And Beyond the Gates of Hell.
Our Infernal Calling.

At the moment of Death
Where All life passes.
Now before your eyes,
The Quickening.
Sonic Energy,
Manifesting.
This Inner Fire:
Nocturnal Desire.

...OOOHHHhhh, OOOHHHhhh.
...OOOHHHhhh, OOOHHHhhh.

Scriptures come alive,
Quiled by Blood and Fire.
Weâre outside the ring society.

From around this World,
And Beyond the Gates of Hell.
Our Infernal Calling.

Nocturnal Desires,
Demons Arise.
Legions under Satan.
Infernal ~ Conflagrations.

Itâs Our Infernal Calling.
Itâs Our Infernal Calling.
Itâs Our Infernal Calling.

From around this World,
And Beyond the Gates of Hell.
Our Infernal Calling.
