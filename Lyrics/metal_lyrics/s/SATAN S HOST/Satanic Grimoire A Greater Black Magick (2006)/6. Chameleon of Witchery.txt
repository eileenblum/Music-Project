Chameleon of Witchery.
Chameleon of Witchery.
I transform society, Incantations awakening.
Veins of Wisdom are flowing;
This Chameleon of Witchery.

Centuries ~ Iniquity
Where by thy Will I am Belief.
Our Universal, this Energy
A Silent-Ring... Echoing.
Wisdom, Evolution
Telepathy.
Where as What you think
Truth Becoming.
Fourth Dimension, Reality Alive!

A Chameleon of Witchery,
Where my Demon is released.
This Chameleon of Witchery,
Evoking the Curse, you Bleed.
A Chameleon of Witchery.

The eyes of glance that curse your soul,
Now in what forever... Wwwaaahhh!

A Cryptic Sanctum,
Where now the Stars align.
Show the future,
Primal Consecration.
Binding Spirits and Energy,
Beyond the Living, Beyond the Dead.
Sacred Wisdom: Quintessence
This Inner Fire and Belief.
To formulate a Strength within,
This Shadowed Being Awakens.

Our Universe of sight abound,
We form in Power the 10th. Degree.
Forever beyond this hour,
Weâre in the Nocturnal Awakening!
This Chameleon of Witchery,
Where my Demon is Released.

Wwwaaahhh...
Here I am now above you,
And Inside you.
The Ecstasy of Mystery.

A Mental Evolution, Telepathy
Where as What you think, Truth Becoming.
Our Fourth Dimension, Reality
Black as candles burn; Cascading.

[Harmony Lead]

From this Chameleon of Witchery,
Evoke my curse as you Bleed.
This Chameleon of Witchery,
Where my Demon is now released.
