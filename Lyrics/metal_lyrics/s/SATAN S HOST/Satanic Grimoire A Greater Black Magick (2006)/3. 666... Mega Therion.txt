Alive,
Satanâs Reign.

From out beyond
The Cryptic Dawn.
Feel the Dead
Awaken.
Etherealize
Thy Will.

Terror, Torment
Under night.
Source of Power,
Sacrifice.
In this Aeon,
Stars above.
Blackness;
Black Death.

Fear not the fire,
As one w/ pain.
We retrograde,
Torrent and lies.
Beyond this night,
Beyond thy eye.

Sacred words,
Summerian.
By rites of
Consecration.
Forever entombed
Your glory gone.

Deep inside, forever locked...Primal.
Now these depths, in hell.
These abysmal depths unknown...
These abysmal depths of Hell... Hell

A Terror, Torment
Under night.
Source of Power;
Sacrifice.

666...Mega Therion,
The Beast from within.
666...Mega Therion,
Release your Demon.

By thy will of all Masters,
Where now in this Aeon it has come.
Feel the Formulations now,
Transcending.

[Lead 1]

Now from beyond,
Casting out beyond.
A funeral spell under Satan.
Entombed now this curse.
From the Legions
All Around this
Infernal World.

Explore this Aeon,
World of ways...Magick.
Talk and protection, this dominion.
The Royal Art,
Discovering...Devouring.

Positive
Negative
Syntheses.
Empower
Self of force.
The Black Flame,
Summoning the Demon tonight.

Feel now the Magick inertia... Coming alive.
Forming Demigods...
Unholy One...Unholy One.
