[1st verse]
I'm your most unholy nightmare
The ruler of forbidden dreams
My power should not be fooled with
The answers behind the scenes

[1st chorus]
I am the King of Terror
I am the King of Hell
Come into my land of evil
take a stand, be strong
The force of Satan works
while you sleep !

[2nd verse]
I'm the king of hell-bent suffering :
I'm the king of delight and lust
Forces of darkness behind me
Future justifies the means

[Repeat 1st chorus]

[3rd verse]
Wings of death we will fly
to the other side
Take hold, here we go -
Oh No !

[4th verse]
I swore the oath of Satan :
To be forever strong
My call will roar eternally ...
You are the devil's children :
I am Satan's unweiler
I've waited a thousand years ...
Now I shall rule !

[2nd chorus]
King of Terror - King of Hell
Land of evil
Stand ! Be Strong !
King of Terror - King of Hell
Land of evil
Take a stand ! Be Strong !
The force of Satan works
while you sleep !

[Repeat 1st verse]
[Repeat 2nd verse]
[Repeat 2nd chorus]
[Repeat 1st chorus]

[final chorus x2]
I'm the King - I'm the King -
of Terror
I'm the King - I'm the King -
of Hell

[x2]
Come into my land of evil :
Take a stand ! Be strong !
We will burn !
