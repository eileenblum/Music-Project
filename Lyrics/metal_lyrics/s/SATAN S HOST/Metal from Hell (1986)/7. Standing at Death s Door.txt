[1st verse]
Let us bring you to
this most unholly place :
Where the spirits reach out
from the other side
Standing at the edge of insanity
Standing at Death's Door
Can you find the evil key
to your mind ?
Devil beckons you
to the other side
Standing at the edge of insanity
Standing at Death's Door

[2nd verse]
I can feel an evil presence
ripping out from the other side :
The unholy claw of the Devil -
Tearing at out minds
Reaching out from Hell
screaming out to you !
Satanic forces stalk thee,
you may die at any time
Unless you hare the evil secret
you may find yourself -
Screaming out from Hell
"let me out of this cell !"

[3rd verse]
Dark forces surround thee
as you struggle to escape
It is too late for answers as the
Reaper swimgs open the gate
Reaching out from Hell
screaming out to die !
You have to come to -
The end of your line !

[Main chorus]
Standing at Death's Door
We can let you in
but you will have to
Pay the Toll !
Standing at Death's Door
We can let you live
but you will have to pay your Soul !

[4th verse]
My most unholy pleasure is to
bring you these evil words :
The law of the Devil's land
Reaching out from Hell
screaming out you !
We shall cause Satanic panic
on this ball of dirt
and for those of you
who are weak - We shall kill !
We can't forgive ;
You'll be sacrificed
The Reaper has called your number !

[Repeat chorus]

[5th verse]
Oh, don't you know
the dark forces have been waiting
to take you down to Hell ?
There's no time for answers
Only time will tell ...
Standing at Death's Door !
