[1st verse]
His book is made of flesh
it's called the "Book of Death"
He brough up unknown powers
from a long and ancient trance
No one can really comprehend
the nightmare at hand
Once he began the old one's ritual
the foolish one was damned
He proceded with the final steps
he took his last breath
within the hidden tomb

[2nd verse]
Inside the musty crypt
he called them all by name
Once the work was finally done
they had broken through yo living plane
To prowl the forest with and evil spite -
Not to rest a second

[1st chorus]
Escape them if you can
they are the strongest of the night !
Yea, they are the strongest of the night !

[3rd verse]
No where to run
You know there is no escape !
You know they have no inetentions
of ever letting you go !
Once you have called upon the spirits
you have lost your soul !
That's the gamble he took
in the dead of the night !
You can't join our legions
untill you are an "Evil Dead"
You thought you controlled these spirits
but they took your life instead !

[2nd chorus]
Yea, they are the strongest fo the night !
Fuck yea, evil spirits -
The strongest of the night !

[4th verse]
These black spirits have a vengeance
deep within their soul
Once you have received their bite
you're within their control

[5th verse]
Cold dark spirits
lurking in the trees
Looking for a victim,
you shall be seized !
No chance for you to live
We have come for you to prey
Who shall be next ?
The time has come for us to rage !
Why have you awakened us
from our ancient slumber ?

[3rd chorus]
Escape them if you can -
They are the strongest of the night !
Fuck yea, evil spirits -
The strongest of the night !
"Evil Dead" will rule !
Taking no prisoners -
The strongest of the night !
KILL
