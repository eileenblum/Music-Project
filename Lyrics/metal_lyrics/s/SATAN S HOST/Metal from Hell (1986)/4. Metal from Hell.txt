[1st verse]
Metallic batallions declare raging war
"We shall take the word in our hands"
prepare the altar :
Bell, book, dagger and scourge
Supreme ritual
the power of Hell's at our command

[2nd verse]
Devil's dance in the moonlight
you can hear the fire's roar
Corrupt thy nations at midnight
"We're the vicious dogs of war"

[3rd verse]
Ten thousand warriors pounding
"METAL FROM HELL"
Screaming arise
come from the land where Satan dwells
We shall serve untill the end
as Lucifer's friend

[Main chorus]
We're the power
We're the force
We're metal -
Metal from Hell
Where evil dwells !
Metal from Hell -
Where evil dwells !

[final verse]
Soldiers of fortune
march for the Anti-Christ
each warrior shows the Satanic sign
The smell of rotting flesh
a wasteland full of death
Proclaiming we shall cause sacrifice

[Repeat 2nd &amp; 3nd verse]
[Repeat Main chorus]
[Lead]
[Repeat 1st &amp; 2nd verse]

We're the power
We're the force
We're metal -
Metal from Hell
Where evil dwells !
Metal from Hell -
Where evil dwells !
Metal from Hell !
Where evil dwells !
