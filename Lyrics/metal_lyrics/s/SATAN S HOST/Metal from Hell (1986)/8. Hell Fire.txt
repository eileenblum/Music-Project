[1st verse]
We are teh secret chiefs of thy world
Striving to find people who know
the meaning of true evil.

[2nd verse]
Welcome to our kingdome of Hell.
Take your time, find your place.
Unleash the savage wings of destruction.
Is this real, no it must be a dream.

[3rd verse]
Pay salute to the warriors of Lucifer.
dark prophets of the 21st century
We proclaim the standart of Satan
is the standart of the strong.

[4th verse]
This is the dawn of the age of fire.
Satanic wisdom takes its place
Unholy blessings of the children of evil
founders of the master race.

[1st chorus]
We are Hell - Hell Fire
We are Hell - Hell Fire
We are Hell - Hell Fire
We are Hell - Hell Fire Club

Unleash the savage wings of destruction
It won't be long till you find yourself
under our spell !

Piligrims of the age of Fire,
manifest in my desire.
Unchained are the legions of Lucifer,
pay tribute to the Syrian's of old

We are Hell Fire
Hell Fire
