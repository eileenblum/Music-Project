[1st verse]
We scribe in the dark of the night
our Black Stele
The evil rite of the black and the light
We now reveal to you -

[2nd verse]
We dedicate this song
this day this hour
to the ancient ones -
who gave us this evil power
From a thousand years in the past
to this very day in the present
the Stele shall live on till the end of time

[1st chorus]
Black Stele
Cross time and space
Black Stele
A silent pact with an ancient race

[3rd verse]
Thy solemn pact in blood
with the gods of hell
We are warriors of death :
We impale you with our evil spell
No mercy for the week ones
we rejoice in your torturous death
A flaming flesh torn corpse
is all you'll have left

[2nd chourus]
Black Stele
We shall kill !
Evil Stele
418 666

[4th verse]
Across the Abyss we fly
protecting the souls
in the hands of Belial
He is the eyes of the night
controlling the evil
that dwells within you
Death in the touch of his hand :
You'll burn in the flames
as written before
Satan's Host commands !
This our secret
We now concieve
Black Stele

[1st lead Bridge]

Englightened by Lucifer
Seeing open wide
the gates of Hell
You are our captive of the night
We are - Warriors Of Satan
With a horrifying burst of flame
Dark Prince, Lord of Fire
We shall rise with an angry vengeance
Conquer we shall this battleground

[2nd lead Bridge]

This is the Law - There is no grace
This is the Law - There is no guilt
This is the Law of unholy hell
This is the Law of 666
Bnag your head for Lucifer
Bang your head against the stage
Bang your head for Lucifer
Do what thou wilt !

[final verse x2]
Black Stele
We shall kill on through the night
They shall behold a warrior in spikes
Their armies shall be made of:
