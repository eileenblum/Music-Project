Born of the blood, Samarian Prophesies
Nightmares of the ancient, casting forth the dead
Hells Disciples, infecting your land
Converting your dead, to infernal command 

We are the Legions, World Wide 9
Transforming your will to our blood line
Under the curse of fate, faith has been denied
Turning blind eyes, one consciousness divine

Chaos from beyond, fires from the sky
Chaos from within, blazing alive 
Ascending vibrations, as two worlds collide
Necromancy of creation, ruins of your shrine
Satanâs pride and blood, the wounds you shall fear
As the horror of truth, finally rings clear

The end is here - beginning is near
The end is near - beginning is here
The end is here - beginning is near 
Truth rings clear

Hatred of lies, at last comes to light
The killing, the slaying, we sacrifice tonight
Upon the altar, Black Hilted Knife
Blood will stain, and bring to our delight! 
The ritual, moonlight, dancing Demons rise
Sacraments, unholy, Satan laughs inside 

Hellâs Disciples, marching Legions to conquer all mankind, delivering destruction and death
Hellâs Disciples, marching Legions to conquer all mankind 

As the armies of the underworld arrive
Your mind is torn, bleeding inside
Revelations of the highest realm, the Abyss now opens wide

Clashing metal, thunder and doom
Earth quaking, rising tombs
Lightning, fiery brimstone
Rains upon the endless horizon

Hellâs Disciples, marching Legions to conquer all mankind, delivering destruction and death
Hellâs Disciples, marching Legions to conquer all mankind, Hellâs Disciples
