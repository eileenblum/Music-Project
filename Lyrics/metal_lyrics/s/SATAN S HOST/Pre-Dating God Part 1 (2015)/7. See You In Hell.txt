[originally by Grim Reaper]See you in hell

Can I make you an offer 
you can't refuse 
I kept my eyes on you 
'Cause I tell you that you lose 
And you can come with me 
To a place you'll know so well
And I will take you 
To the very gates of hell 

See you in hell my friend 
I'll see you in hell 

Your choice's up then 
How many sins can be yours 
At my kingdom final choice is yours 
You can take it 
Any time that you need 
Next thing I'll borrow
All you've got to do is bleed 

See you in hell my friend 
I'll see you in hell 

Come with me, i will take you down 
To the very depths of your soul 
And I'll make you burn! 

See you...see you in hell
