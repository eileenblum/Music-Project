Wealth, souls, lives of the un-damned, is never enough 
The life of this Earth, is what we will burn up
By faking oppositions, nations against each other
The strings we pull, our gullets and pockets fill up
Their throats will bleed with gold

Apocalyptic, Hellish Metal screams
Across the crimson skies
All our poison, within their veins
Sickness in disguise
According to the plan
First strike strategy
Breeding the war machine

In ritualistic form dimensions unseen
Open the door way 
Dark energy, collisions cosmic aspirations knowledge
Become our spoils of war

Conjuring upon the Devilâs cauldron
Dragons blood the elixir of life, 
Ye do I invoke the Goat of Mendez
Energy of night under our command

In ritualistic form dimensions unseen
Open the door way 
Dark energy, collisions cosmic aspirations knowledge
Become our spoils of war

Live for Metal, die for Metal
The rarest treasure, we so seek
Die for Metal, live for Metal
Mining ores to rule the meek

Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Greed, Lust, Hate, War 
Greed, Lust, Hate, War

Greed, Lust, Hate, War
By the hands of the Evil Lord
Greed, Lust, Hate
War, atrocities of the night
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Abominations of light 
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Celebrate in Hell

Tear the heart, of the enemy
Victory is ours
Destiny we ride our truth
Trample all, worthless and weak

Greed, Lust, Hate, War
By the hands of the Evil Lord
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Atrocities of the night
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Abominations of light
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Celebrate in Hell

Soft as silence
Their skin gleaming
Caressing my triumph
With every moonlit thrust
Engorged and dreaming
We soar into the universe

We rule now
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
You exist no longer
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Conquered to ashes
Greed, Lust, Hate, War
Master is what you call me now
