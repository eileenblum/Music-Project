So much for temptation
In the hours you once believed
In the deceiver
Once you felt the hatred of god
So much for the hand of glory
And the loss of your faith
Every word you read
Was written a great lie

I, I shall deny salvation
Penance beyond your beliefs
I, I shall deny, salvation
As we realize we will never be saved

Now I cast these shadows, accepting the blood on my hands
Hatred I use for glory, defiant we make our final stand
In death Elysium fields, calling upon the Legions of Hell
To fight in honor, bathing in the blood of conquered lands

I, I shall deny, salvation
Penance beyond your beliefs
I, I shall deny, salvation
As we realize we will never be saved

After the End, the end of mankind
After the End, the final curtain call
After the End, before you were blind
After the End, awaked your mind

After the End, before they were blind
After the End, darkness consumes the light
After the End, before they were blind
After the End, no end in sight

Hell is upon the Earth, blood and no rights
This war, this fight, extinguish the light

By his hand, by our will
Sacrifice to take control
To kill, to destroy, vanquish lies for all
By his hand, by our will
Sacrifice to take control
To kill, to destroy, vanquish lies for all

Hell is upon the Earth, blood and no rights
This war, this fight, extinguish the light

By his hand, by our will
Sacrifice to take control
To kill, to destroy, vanquish lies for all
By his hand, by our will, sacrifice to take control
To kill, to destroy, vanquish lies for all
