Hand of fate drips with blood 
Screams of death split the night
Is this real is it a dream 
As if nothing is what it seems 
I am a vessel of evil

Ra asa Isalomanu Rita Zodacare, Zodecarena Calam en Forentia

Broken spirit raping peace 
Boiling veins of molten heat
Decaying bodies once mindless sheep
Rivers of blood now flow at my feet

Valley of Blood
I claim my prize
Valley of Blood
Red rivers rise

Condemning millions to their deaths, 
Flaming sword of Blasphemy shall never rest

Valley of Blood
I claim my prize 
Valley of Blood
Red rivers rise

For too long have the righteous ones, given the space to breed 
Time is now for the flaming sword, to hush them in their sleep
Dominion over mankind my birth right, this ball of dirt 
Laughing now I claim whatâs mine, the souls upon this Earth

Valley of Blood
I claim my prize
Valley of Blood
Red rivers rise

For too long have the righteous ones, given the space to breed 
Time is now for the flaming sword, to hush them in their sleep

Valley of Blood
I claim my prize 
Valley of Blood
Red rivers rise

Valley of Blood 
Valley of Blood

Dominion over mankind my birth right, this ball of dirt 
Laughing now I claim whatâs mine, the souls upon this Earth

Valley of Blood
I claim my prize
Valley of Blood
Red rivers rise

Valley of Blood
Valley of Blood

Bestow thy power unto me, now use me as thou wilt 
The future set no longer to be, now that all the blood has split
