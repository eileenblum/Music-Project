I shall give rise to a new race
By my hand shall be a worthy people
Why yet are they in infancy
As children, savages filled with potential

Mine is the power of creation
Forbidden rift within our sight
Entrance to insure our future
To bring to being our champion race

Unworthy children of god
By my hands shall they bleed
Yearning for the wetting at my blade
Such wrath did consume me

I strike upon Adonai Yahweh
Ripping out the organ of creation
I did consume in one serpents gulp
To the deep veil my black despair

Darkness is but an absence of light
Evil is not such a thing you imagine

This is what I sought in the in the dark realm
I came to contemplate what might be done
And now I do perceive the way to advance
At the shores of this unsunned sea

Alleviate my wrath, cultivate this crime yet further
I shall destroy you
Pre-dating god
More dreadful than dragonâs fire
Is not a burden to be born
Repent this heresy
Pre-dating god
Pre-dating god
Pre-dating god

This is what I sought in the in the dark realm
I came to contemplate what might be done
And now I do perceive the way to advance
At the shores of this unsunned sea

Alleviate my wrath, cultivate this crime yet further
I shall destroy you
Pre-dating god
More dreadful than dragonâs fire
Is not a burden to be born
Repent this heresy
Pre-dating god
Pre-dating god
Pre-dating god

Evolution â reconstitution â one step closer
Pre-dating god
Revolution â execution â to the truth
Pre-dating god
Pre-dating god
Pre-dating god
