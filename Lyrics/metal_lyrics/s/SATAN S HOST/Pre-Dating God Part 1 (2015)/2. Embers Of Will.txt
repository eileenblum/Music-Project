Embers of my will 
Burn deep in this shell 
Black window to Hell 
I unleash my spell

Incantations, liberations, your blood now I spill 
Reverberations, vibrations, your energy I steal

In trance, you are slipping 
Your body floating beneath 
Silver lining of consciousness 
Devouring Abyss it absorbs you

Into the darkness
Black hole of existence 
Deep in your core
Your soul becomes my whore

Embers of Will, to embrace the unknown
Embers of Will, bound to this evil
Embers of Will, rotting corpses all around
Embers of Will, I shall consume

Embers of Will, to embrace the unknown
Embers of Will, bound to this evil
Embers of Will, rotting corpses all around
Embers of Will, I now own

Embers of my will
Burn deep in this shell
Black window to Hell
I unleash my spell

Itâs Evil, all is Evil

Embers of my will
Burn deep in this shell
Black window to Hell
I unleash my spell

I unleash my spell
