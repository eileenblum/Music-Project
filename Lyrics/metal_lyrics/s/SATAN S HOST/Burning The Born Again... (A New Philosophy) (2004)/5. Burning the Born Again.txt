Judge or ye be judged, seems your double standard.
When preaching from your tongue the Hypocrisy.
In your world of make believe.
No leaders of tomorrow, these words to say as you pray.
Your life of lies another day.
So itâs near all your fears.

Deem it trickery unto white light fiends.
Preaching from your tongue the Hypocrisy.
Nailed at the wrist of grace, a living organ flesh of waste.
In your words now fatigued, my strength youâll bleed.
Lose of god, born again, a will weakens.
Not a chance, golden ring: Immortality.

Nihilist, Rational, Illusionâs Dying lie.

Salvation...Damnation.
Salvation...Damnation.

Where severed minds are born of no true strength.
They fall behind in this War of Life.
Like a will stricken by sloth,
No born again is pure of thought.
Judge or ye be judged, seems your double standard.
When preaching from your tongue the Hypocrisy.
In your world of make-believe.
No leaders of tomorrow, these words to say as you prey.
Your life of lies another day.
So itâs near ALL your fears.
