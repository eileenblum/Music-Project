Centuries of blood have spilled for freedom,
Where mad monks and monasteries decimate...Decimation.
Our sacred order: Black Circle.
We survived and multiplied 999 unified.
Wield now your Nocturnal Sword of Iniquity.
We are the Ancient Warriors of this sacred order.

Before all religions, a grotto alive.
Through out all eternity of becoming.
Our legacy infernal majesty.
Wield now your nocturnal sword of iniquity.
Warriors of this twenty-second century.

Through me you go through, into grief.
Through me you go through, pain eternal.
Through me you go through, people lost.

Abandon hope all Yeâ who enter.
Into and beyond the gates of Hell
A land unknown: Demons.
Eternal friendship, supernatural wings eternal.
Only a true Beast possesses the strength
Great enough to wield this steel of Baphomet.
Decapitated, severed and wasted...Decapitate.
One among the other side

Where Sorcery is older than time.
Azag~Thoth... Lord of Black Magicians.
Azag~Thothâ¦ Lord of Black Magicians.
Cosmic castration where the enemy is blood of man.
Azag~Thothâ¦ Lord of Black Magicians.
Azag~Thothâ¦ Lord of Black Magicians.
