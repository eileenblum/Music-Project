Spawned...From the Dead I awake.
Beyond...From the Dead I awake.
Under our Law, Under our creed
We are the Ones you need.
By lies undead you will bleed,
Revealing your everything.

Feel this sword of Satan decapitate you,
Demonic consecration another soul entombed.
Sever out the tongue so they speak no more,
While Dark crows feast upon lost words.
As with every moment time becomes my Magick,
Infernal Fires now burn.

Deep itâs from within, Believe itâs in the air.
Breathe in Lucifer.
Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized.
Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized.

This untold Wizard, sons of the northern winter
Frozen burnings, One among.
As with all what now becomes, the seed of truth in Darkness now grows.

Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized.
Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized.

We are the balance, a scapegoat for some.
Keeper of the keys where life and death are now one.
Sacred wisdom, the Everlasting.
Tranquil serene, eternal fires enlightening.
Divine Demons sanctify apparitions now arrive.
7:16 pm. Twilight a solar eclipse
A burning sky.

Rituals now have begun, Nocturnal.
Sanctified Necromancia
Where thy soul is eternal.
We hold Godhead...Occult Wisdom.

Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized by fire Infernal light.
Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized by fire Eternal life.
We hold Godhead...Occult Wisdom.

Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized by fire Infernal light.
Sinners in Sanctuary
Where Demons are Demonized by fire Eternal life.

Sworn in blood. Bonded by Will.
Form the Unknown. Bornless One.
