On her last night she gave herself unto me eternally.
For now the moon it has eclipsed as this earth utterly Darkens. Mercury stood afar from the sun having won.
A house of truth above thy head: Infernal Serpent crown.
Her beauty is pure evil a mystic power to unveil,
Where man is destine to be lost, in this web known as love.

Mercury stood afar from the sun having won,
Virgin now she comes forth, a naked copulation.
Under a Full Moon Midnight
The Ecliptic Equinox arrives.
Infernal crimson final hour,
The Ecliptic Equinox arise.

Magick is in the air, Nocturnal whisper.
Tranquil her lusting, Virgin that sings
Primal desires, carnal her touch
Tranquility in every breath I breathe.
Under a Full Moon Midnight
The Ecliptic Equinox arrives.
Infernal crimson final hour,
The Ecliptic Equinox arise.

Magick is in the air, Nocturnal whisper
Tranquil her lusting, Virgin that sings.
Primal desires, carnal her touch
Tranquility in every breath I breathe.

Scarlet Goddess Dream
Bending in ecstasy.
Flesh on flesh this Devil copulates.
Across the alter is where the red haired virgin lays.
Head to the south, priest to the east
Naked is her flesh. A chill of lust
Inverted cross, Succubus.
Lilith Iâ¦

In here pure Magick it is one of mind and flesh.
Mystical rivers of fire now shall guide us.
Infinite space starlight, sacred our flame.
Power serene crystallized, eternal life.
Between her...Tender is where I die.
Mystic rivers of fire now shall guide us.

On her last night she gave herself unto me eternally.
For now the moon it has eclipsed as the earth utterly Darkens. Mercury stood afar from the sun having won.
Our house of truth above thy head, Infernal serpents crown. Under a Full Moon where love is her doom.
