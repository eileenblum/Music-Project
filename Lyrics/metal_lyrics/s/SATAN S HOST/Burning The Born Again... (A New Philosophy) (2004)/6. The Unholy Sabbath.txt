Summon to power, dormant in time
Born of the Devil torment your life.
Conjuring Demons from the un-light,
Revolution now comes alive.
I am the one, the one that you fear

In this hour of Darkness.
The Unholy Sabbath arise.
The Unholy burning of skies.
I am the One from a lost past,
I have now returned.

Frozen by sordid lies where times back-lash pain.
In this webbing of your mind
Youâll feel our weakness cauterize.
I am the One, the one that you fear
In this hour of Darkness.

The Unholy Sabbath arise.
The Unholy burning of skies.
Cryptic till your inside, Bleeding Angel-eye
From the fear you denied, possession is now alive.
Winter prophecy, Dante freeze
Inevitably the sins of blessing.
Formulate realms to every and ALL.

A probability, your evil entity...afire.
This Unholy Sabbath is under evocation.
Youâll feel all candles now burning,
By the light of midnight...Arise.
Battles to War releasing rage. This witchery through eyes now enflamed.

Soon to inflict Nosferatu: 
Colasoul desires Impale you and burn. 
Sever the son, Burning christian. Sabbath of night, Heaven afire.

Sworn by thou way, Infernal sins awaken life beyond.
To all inside desires arise, Warlord-Fire the burning souls of night alive.

Forsaken ways from the fires of time direly burn, which are here and edged in life.
Iâve lived by ways, nightly age in a rage of enlightening.
Time to act, bleeding heart. Speak the rite an offering is now alive.

Form yet wiser one where all Magick is from.
Hear our chants echo among the dawn we shroud.
Unsheathed swords, children of the night. Bow to thou new Lord

Your strength is with our fight tonight.
Now ignite this War and release some pain.
Deeds of the dead to power as this Devil formulates.
Compeller, Infernal fist of change.
Save your prayers for your god does not care.
