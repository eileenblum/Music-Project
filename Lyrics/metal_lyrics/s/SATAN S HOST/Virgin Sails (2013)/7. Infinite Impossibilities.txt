Infinite Impossibilities
Stimulate the pineal gland
To awaken mans third eye within the mind
Subsonic vibrations of the night
Dark matter, divides in two
Secrets reach beyond the great divide

Creatures, nocturnal, divulging
Knowledge forgotten
Creatures, infernal, awaken
Dimensions unseen

Secret societies trap and blind
Fluoride, crystallized 
Mankind left sightless and lost 
Doorways into the unknown past
True origins of mankind
Revealed in hypnotic trance

Creatures, nocturnal, divulging
Knowledge forgotten
Creatures, infernal, awaken
Dimensions unseen

With a lie instilled from a hidden past
A false faith to control
The destines of all hope
And all the natural energies
Drained for an agenda

Spiritual imprisonment 
Alliances denied
We recognize and open the third eye
So that all truths suffice and liberate

Fight, you fool
Against slavery and control
Regain what once was yours
Since the beginning of time
Unleash inner power
Never sought before

Your very life, it depends, will to strike 
Open up, your third eyes mind 
Your very life, it depends, will to strike 
Open up, your third eyes mind

Infinite Impossibilities 
To break the crustations
That leaves us blind
Infinite possibilities 
As we stimulate
The pineal gland

Resonating through the universe
Seven billion thoughts combined
Subsonic vibrations of the night
Dark matter, divides in two
Secrets reach beyond the great divide

Your very life, it depends, will to strike
Open up, your third eyes blind
