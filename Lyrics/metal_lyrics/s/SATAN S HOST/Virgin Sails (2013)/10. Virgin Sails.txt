We raise our sails, we set the course
To prepare our voyage of the damned 
As Maulduines boat, becomes our guide
Through these currents, the waters of the dead

Seas of mist, storms of blood
Seeds mysteries, anticipation
Fiery seas, a fight for life
Drowning in our destination

Angry waters, bottomless pits
Swirling storms of Leviathan
Seas of glass, on horizons
Torments and torture becomes our guide

Virgin Sails 
On high tide
The unborn spirits of reincarnation
Virgin Sails 
Upon the afterlife
The unborn souls rape your lives
Virgin Sails 
On high tide
The unborn spirits of reincarnation
Virgin Sails 
Upon the afterlife
The unborn souls rape your lives

Within these Waters
We've sailed upon
Apparitions vapors of the sea
Demonic Incantations
Now we belong as one with Hell

Virgin Sails 
Creatures of the night
Blackened hearts 
Unholy Kraken
Waves of Flames
Melting Flesh
Desires Burning
In the darkness of the night
Virgin Sails
Demons Wail
Hail Ho! To the highest
Our Dark Lord
Waves of flames
Sailing on
To Port in the
Realm of forgotten

Within these waters
We've sailed upon
Apparitions vapors of the sea
Demonic Incantations
Now we belong as one with Hell

Enter now a sea of glass
Fall upon the waves of destruction
Blocking out the scorching sun
Damned souls lost eternally
Eternally, eternally, for eternity!

Sail into the afterlife one by one
Eternally damned souls
Blocking out the sun
We set our anchors upon the port of the lost
Your infernal damned souls paid the final cost
