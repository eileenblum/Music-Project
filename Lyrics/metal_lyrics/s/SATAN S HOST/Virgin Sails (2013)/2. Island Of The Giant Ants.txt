The all seeing eye
Of our modern time
Ancient doctrines
Leading all the blind
Like sheep to a slaughter
Madness is accepted
With mankind's lust
Deception of the masses

Raging, waging open war
Financed in blood
Lies and propaganda
Turn against yourselves
Raping the harlot
They want you to believe
Infidels surround us
The unseen enemy

In the wake of global collapse
Blow your wealth
Feed the machine
In time, your services 
Enslavement to the new regime

Secret societies
Scheming up the grand plan
Of the world's bleak future 
Conceived since antiquity

Island of the Giant Ants

Freedom
Is just another word now? 
Liberty and justice
Freedom
Is bought and sold
Sightless injustice

Feed your children 
To the corporate warmonger
Spill their blood
To save their filthy lives

Rape your children
To the beat of lunacy
Sell your soul to gain
A shred of dignity

Fool us all
To live beyond our means
Fear and faith 
Used to create slaves

Island of the Giant Ants

As it was before
History has been erased
More men have died
In the name of their god

As it was before
History has been erased
More men have died
In the name of their god
