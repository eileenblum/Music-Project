Awaken, by dead silence
Wooden prison underground

Clawing, pounding -need to escape
The poison -in zombie state
Searching, needing â feed the urge
The poison -has you in hate

An army of dead, coming to life
The taste of blood on their minds
Young or old, no prejudice
Till all is gone

Clawing, pounding -need to escape
The poison -in zombie state
Searching, needing â feed the urge
The poison -has you in hate

Reanimated Anomalies
Killers with no soul
Reanimated Anomalies
Abomination! Woe!

Walking in the shadows
Needing to feed my hunger
Insatiable desires
In your blood I fix my need
Rummaging through your entrails
A death stare in your eyes
As Hell manifests
I lose control

My desires multiply
With every gruesome attack
Black silk in the twilight 
On this unholy night

Running 
Your life means everything to me
Killing
Exhausted? I never stop

There is nowhere to hide
There is nowhere to go
Our date exposed
I will find you
I will gut you
We'll be one forever
There is no escape
Charon awaits
Two pence to pay your toll

You will find heaven
When you cross over
With the flames of Hell 
Licking you all over
You will find despair
When you cross over
With the flames of Hell 
In torment forever

There is nowhere to hide
There is nowhere to go
Our date exposed
There is no escape
Charon awaits
Two pence to pay your toll

Reanimated Anomalies
Killers with no soul
Reanimated Anomalies
Abomination! Woe! 
NO REMORSE!!!! 
NO REMORSE!!!!

Searching in darkness, 
They glow as the daylight
Quenching my desire, 
As I feast in delight
