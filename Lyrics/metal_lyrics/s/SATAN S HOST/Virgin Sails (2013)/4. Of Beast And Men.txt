Living the gospels lie
Drowning in the blood of christ
Hatred for all mankind
Why won't they all just die?

We hold the keys to the kingdom
Greed, power, war and lust
Mankind is doomed for destruction
So long as god remains
Breaking down the walls of freedom
Demanding sacrifice
Those who now hold the strings
Watching as billions die

Bleeding in the hearts of the men
Psalms that feed the lie
Governed by false fear
That blindly controls their lives

We hold the keys to the kingdom
Greed, power, war and lust
Mankind is doomed for destruction
So long as god remains
Breaking down the walls of freedom
Demanding sacrifice
Those who now hold the strings
Watching as billions die

Denial of the church and state
Cower in fear Of Beast and Men
I consecrate
Unholy trinity Of Beast and Men

Burning as the shades of grey
Descendents forever serve

Lord of the underworld
Keeper of the night
Herald the coming of the dead
Beyond the grave

Blood red seas torment sorrow
Breed the seeds Of Beast of Men

Destroyed depraved
Followers Of Beast and Men
The blood has spilled
Over and over Of Beast and Men

We take the keys to the kingdom
Lead by infernal blasphemy
Accordance with the future
Changes in society

The blood has spilled
Over and over Of Beast and Men

Political perversion reigns
United Nations combined
The truth needs to be said
In peril we all will die

We hold the keys to the kingdom
Greed, power, war and lust

So long as god remains
Breaking down the walls of freedom

Corpses lay in the burning ash
The remnants of society
Cemeteries have become our cities 
By the will Of Beast and Men
