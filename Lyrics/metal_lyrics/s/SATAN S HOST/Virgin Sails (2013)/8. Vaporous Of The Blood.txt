At the dawn of time 
Darkness casts its shadow on man
To indulge in all desires
Bestows him a will of his own

You are my divine creation
Your will and mine are the same
I will lead and I will guide you 
I am the fire within your veins

At the dawn of time 
Darkness casts its shadow on man
To indulge in all desires 
Bestows him a will of his own

Infiltrations of corrupt dominions
My ancient path led astray
Their veil of misleading doctrine
Clouds your vision away from me

Come back to me 
Remember whence you came
Return to me
Infernal glory reigns

The war has been won 
My legions are free to roam
I'll burn the veil of lies 
And consume all who are bound

Vaporus of the Blood
Linage of Infernal generations
Vaporus of the Blood
Lifelines pure and true
Vaporus of the Blood
Dedicate your soul to the Master
Vaporus of the Blood

With the carcass of the dead god 
Now in ashes before the Beast
Cloven hooves crush the iniquities 
Blasphemous flames I now feast
I now Feast
Mindless flock Sheep

Burning of the scared wisdom
Wings of angels turned to ash
Conscious of eternal visions
Heavens pillars burned to reason

With the carcass of the dead god 
Now in ashes before the Beast
Cloven hooves crush the iniquities 
Blasphemous flames I now feast
I now Feast
Mindless flock Sheep

Now these strands of existence 
Alien infused first born lines 
Original creation 
Continued through all time

Dedicated lives for the born-less one
Synchronized with the fires of the sun

Vaporus of the Blood
Linage of Infernal generations
Vaporus of the Blood
Lifelines pure and true
Vaporus of the Blood
Dedicate your soul to the Master
Vaporus of the Blood
