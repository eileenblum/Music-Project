I come not to send peace
But a sword to slain men
I form to the light
Creating darkness upon this earth
I am the bringer of Evil

Nocturnal whisper
Burning brighter than the sun
No hoary falsehood
Shall be a truth
I raise up in stern
Split his worm eaten skull
Gather around me
Ye who is death defiant

I request reasons for your golden rule
Belief in false principles
Beginning of moral decline

I request reasons for your golden rule

Proclaimer of destiny
Orchestrator of the stars
Architect of creation
Castigator of sin
Scourge of Evil
The cloak of darkness
Though that accursed race
Satan's bloodline

Cor Maleficus
In the Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude
Tyrant of existence
Cor Maleficus
The Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude

Thus I do reap
My treachery
Heavens left hand
Betrays its right hand
Satan knew the fate
This high estate
Full of vipers who sting themselves

Cor Maleficus
In the Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude
Tyrant of existence
Cor Maleficus
The Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude

Now I decry in every shadow
The knife's reflected light
In every cup the fatal potion
The assassin's vial

Cor Maleficus
In the Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude
Tyrant of existence
Cor Maleficus
The Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude

We have arrived in every shadow
To wet the lands with blood
Before yet greater parts
This empire's laid to waste

Cor Maleficus
In the Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude
Tyrant of existence
Cor Maleficus
The Heart of Evil
Lord of infinitude

Lies have built themselves a throne
Let it be, cut them out
Exterminate repentance of misdeeds

When you beg me through your thirst
My whip will repeatedly rip your flesh
Only the vain ask for forgiveness
Everlasting torment
As you plead for solitude
And the pleasures of your flesh
Only the vain ask for forgiveness
Everlasting torment
