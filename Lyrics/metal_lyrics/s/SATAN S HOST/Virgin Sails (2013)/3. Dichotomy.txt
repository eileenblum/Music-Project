Day refuses night
Darkness swallows light
A soul is fueled and filled to live
Binding all around
Confounding all within
Supporting systems built to fail

Hope supporting life
Brought down by despair
Constant struggle from within
Resistance of new change
Adapting to new ways
Evolving life as it transcends

Race to our end 
The ending of mankind 
First we do and then we die
Race to our end 
The ending of mankind 
Race to the end of this life

What is the consequence? 
Of our footprint in time
A penance for our crimes

Born with one intention
One aim in mind 
Be resourceful and to yourself pay kind
Further on your visions expanding all around
An all seeing eye protects and confounds
Born with one intention, one aim in mind

Be resourceful and to yourself pay kind
Let loose you inhibitions
Conjure the beast within
Release the power
That started off as sin

A Dichotomy 
What is and what shall be
Existence all at stake
We gasp
We shake

Race to our end 
The ending of mankind 
First we do and then we die

Mankind meets its end
The futures never lie
Dark shadows in the night
We do until we die

Day refuses night
Darkness swallows light
A soul is fueled and filled to live
Binding all around
Confounding all within
Supporting systems built to fail

A Dichotomy 
What is and what shall be
Existence all at stake
We gasp, we then shake

Race to our end 
The ending of mankind 
First we do and then we die
Race to our end 
The ending of mankind 
Race to the end of this life

We do and then we die
We do and then we die
