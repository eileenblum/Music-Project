This is all that I believe
To bear witness to my calling

My life escapes me, my days they shorten
These final breaths to testify

To face these years is adversity in itself
Calm passed long ago to revel times foretold
Before is the open book another page, pieces fall into place
Take heed to discern the times, of the signs

These times that try men's souls

Whereby we know, this life is like a shadow
And assuredly death shall stand to greet the soul
The years, they've coursed the storm that's been uprising
Since the days of old building, and now approaching

He sees not his shadow, who faces the sun
For his eyes burn and melt as wax
The price paid for living in light
Is that of gold in the crucible

Ever melting, straining, striving, to be made pure
Purity escapes me, remembrance breaks me down

Though my knees become weak, I will cause my foot another step to carry the task
Bleeds my hands but, they are kept, remembrance breaks me down
But I will survive until it is the last time
