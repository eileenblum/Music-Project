You're my beloved and all together lovely
As a gift that can't be bought, as if gold could favor outweigh
Your meaning to me, the secrets of the heart made manifest
Even beauty's priced beside thee, proportioned by lot the less

Wishes fade, dreams break, promise made

Takes away your will, takes your whole heart captive
Just for one promise, sell it all for one true word
To hold on to, face the shame of it all
Safer to neglect, than open your callused heart

Piece by piece, you have lost a part of your self
You share to gain but lose at love and learn to hate yourself
More and More each day and all the days thereafter
They labor to put back together and regain what is gone forever

Wishes fade, as dreams break, promise made, tomorrow takes

The most costly mistake is to try to change the past today
The filth and the shame, they all wash away
For you Christ will clean the slate

Only love can fill the void, when the world has taken it's toll
Hand in hand, by your side, we'll walk down this path together
I'll take you to the place where promises will never break

To the advent
To the advent
To the advent of a miracle

True love is to die for and is why I cry, for you
And the pain you feel and feed can heal
If you'd just walk with me toward the light
