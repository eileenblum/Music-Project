There can be no justice
Where there is no truth

A life of self sacrifice, a new creation
Devotion to purity, in the midst of light conviction
Set fire, to the hearts desire, taken by storm
No longer in the dark, dwelling in shadows nevermore

I surrender all, all I am I give
Give there of till end much more, more than this death
I surrender all, all I am I've spent
Spent my essence and much more, more than this death

Far be it from me to flee from the den of lions
The truth can be blinding
Cast me forth for stoning
Misunderstanding causes fear
I feel your pain, I feel your emptiness
And on this day your blood will touch blood

Because I am an example I will not flee
Waiting for an end as breath fades away, fades away, fades away
Waiting for an end as breath fades away

I surrender all, all I am I give
Give there of til' end much more, more than this is death
I surrender all, all I am I've spent
Spent my essence and much more, more than this is death
