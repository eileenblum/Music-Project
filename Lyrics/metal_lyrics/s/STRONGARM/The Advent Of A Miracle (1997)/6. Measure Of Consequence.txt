Raging, your eyes seeking cleansing for their disease
Hatred, suffocating reason, the ground cries out

For the spirit broken, erased by aberration
Turn the pages of sacrifice, blood cursed with retribution
To the blind a cancer, but for the chosen generations
Memories to sorrow, for their souls a lamentation

Therefore, he has come
For Christ is comfort, Forevermore

Countless number of bodies, raped of their lifetime
An end to families, through heritage survives a lifetime
Voices that call through seasons carry timelessness
A measure of consequence

Never again to create the cycle
Never again denying their lives
Please help us, Oh Most High
To never again see through those eyes
