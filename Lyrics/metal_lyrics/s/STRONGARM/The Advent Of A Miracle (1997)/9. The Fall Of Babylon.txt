When nations rise
With eyes of arrogance, raise your war cry, and be shattered
The string of dissension, ensnared by evil tongue
Cast your ring of disappointment, the plague of dissolution

The plans of your devise, they will be thwarted
Spirit stained by corrupted flesh
Your hollow truths will be shattered

Your riches are acquired by the misfortune and bloodshed of others

Within our midst is the prophesied age, of new Babylon

All the images of it's gods, lie smashed on the ground
It's driven by darkness, the dwelling place for demons
For the nations race to drain the cup, of the maddening wine of power

To deny, a man his rights
To deprive, a man of justice
He looked for justice but, saw blood shed for righteousness
But, heard cries of distress
He will cleanse the blood stains of the oppressed
By a spirit of judgement and a spirit of fire

The thing that drive us to hate, to love, to lust, to greed, and to good is 
longing
Every soul is born with that vague undefined hole
We search each other's eyes for answers and find none
God will break the yolk that burdens you
But, those who refuse to see, leading others astray in your iniquities
Terror will seize you

The hour of judgement will come
