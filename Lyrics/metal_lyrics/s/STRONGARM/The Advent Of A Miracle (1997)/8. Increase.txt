I fall to my knees for this my LORD I plea
In this hour alone, and surely stand stoned

For fear will face me to meet me where I flee
Still I run away, this cup I pass to pray
As a rivers end meets sea so my eyes they flood into thee

In many ways, I feel I've dug my own grave

A friend, what does it mean?
Obedience, what does it bring?

Knowledge comes easy, easily obtained
Wisdom the greater but, only through pain
This I ask for, to surround
To near the backbone to growth
And therefore to clear convictions
That draw me, closer to lead me
Decisions to flow with thoughts to bring healing
Truth to perfection my spirit discerning
But, in all that I've learned I am still learning
That the plague of my life I must fight

To survive these self same truths revealed to me
To be the absolute
Change starts a thought and can only be taught
With deep concern, the heart through the mind through time, learn

Wearily I divide
Called to disunite
Afraid that they may scatter
But rather they gather
