Truth and justice belong...
To you, behold the power of his undying sacrifice

As a sanctuary for the wounded

In the council of perfection

All creation stands as a witness
All creation stands as a mark of your will

Wisdom (like an ocean) hides behind your eyes
Darkness, divided, by your fallen tear
There the wicked cease from turmoil and the weary are at rest
All sacrifice and all suffering is redemptive

Formed, in the palm of GOD's mighty hand
Shaped, by the work of his will
And alive from the breath of his loving heart
Man's inspiration, is GOD's touch on the quickened nerves of the spirit

Enflamed by your unquenchable fire
I stand in the Spirit of conquest
Through you, I am created to conquer

Fleeting, living life of calamity
Forces unseen are controlling my destiny
We're not at the mercy of fate
Fears born of this world are groundless
Lord, teach me and I will be silent

Word made flesh, we long to hear you
You are my advocate, my mediator
With complete power and perfect love
You alone hold the scales of judgement
