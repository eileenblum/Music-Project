teethmarks, these are all parasites
you just might get out alive
my patience has run its course
the blame and the force is on my hands
to justify this is out of question
what am I waiting for?

on a daily basis, I've been overwhelmed with the fakest sorry excuse
the worst kind of connection to the truth (wipe them out)
march on through this night
I'm dancing in the streets, prolonging the inevitable end of the evening
open the flood gates and wipe them out

you're all pigs, without a doubt
no more lifeless hours, unlock your doors
try to be yourself or I promise you won't get out
laughing and shining on the surface, but for what?
you're a joke to these people
watch your mouth
the drive is gone from all of you, including myself

upon deaf ears, we will beg for a second chance,
only to pour it down the drain

the coroners await the arrival of another wasted soul
goddamn you all! rise without fall!

you're all pigs, without a doubt
no more lifeless hours, unlock your doors
try to be yourself or I promise you won't get out
laughing and shining on the surface, but for what?
you're a joke to these people
watch your mouth
the drive is gone from all of you, including myself

open your eyes, and look what surrounds you, lies! lies! lies!
you shoulder the blame, you were better off coming disguised
my cover was blown
what did you expect me to do, when we are all alone?
I gave you every lifeless breath that I had to offer,
but that wasn't enough for you
