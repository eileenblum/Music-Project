chosen ones, at the top of your lungs repent
paranoid and lost the cause for any chance of safety
hold fast! hearts racing to the finish line of the passerby
pick your side and get used to hearing the cries of our fellow man
where we stand, the ground crumbles beneath us
(pick them off) one by one
there is no truth in what they teach us

this wasteland will think for you
I'll kill myself today,
on top of everyone and every word that was out of date
to make amends and follow, is the last thing that I would care for
you are..

my innocence out the door
don't misbehave my dear
contain yourself in my domain
the bones are what is left
plant your sins and go

with you breathing down my neck, only the worst will come of that
this lifestyle is only cut out for the finest abomination

these waters haven't settled in years,
with all these tears and all your fears that you can't handle
you've made your mark, stood your ground
exhale and let go with us now

wake up!
