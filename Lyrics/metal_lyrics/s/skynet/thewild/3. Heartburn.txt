would you spare me your ignorance?
the lies are spreading and causing disease
where were your parents?
this is what she left of me

Ceilidh, you told me there was nothing left to live for
abandon trust, we looked to find the cure for
this love is crawling, rotting, and gnawing
against my better judgement, the ride along is what I held dear
do not be fooled, this outcome is not an illusion
when I fear for you

whore, fuck the ground you walk on
there couldn't be another one like me, who has brought this on
there couldn't be another one
so long, my love

last chance for lust
this is love gone, it's never coming back
last chance for us
this is love gone, it's never coming back

Ceilidh, they told me you were lost long before me
fixated on the days of orchids and charity
you fucking ripped my heart out

whore, I can't take this any longer
on that note, I must capitalize the storm
gut wrenched and it's eating itself
I'm gone

last chance for lust
this is love gone, it's never coming back
last chance for us
this is love gone, it's never coming back
