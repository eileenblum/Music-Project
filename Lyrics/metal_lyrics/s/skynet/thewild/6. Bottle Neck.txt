pass it on
I won't regret a moment of this
fortunately it won't be long until they are barging in
this is a promise I made to myself
you may want to relocate now

I'll set the trends that bury us all
I fenced you all in, there is nowhere to go

burn it to the ground
everything else is planned and going well
focus,enjoy the show
this pales in comparison to hell

consider me guilty, colour me obscene
without question, forget question
crimson on the screen
this was a long time coming
I had to wait until I lost my mind

I'm calling in sick
I'm calling in not breathing
instead I'll stand behind the scene just waiting
kudos to your men, you are all so foolish
cheers to what you believe
you've got your lead

I'll set the trends that bury us all
I fenced you all in, there is nowhere to go

(burn it to the ground)
you beg me to stop, but I won't stop now
