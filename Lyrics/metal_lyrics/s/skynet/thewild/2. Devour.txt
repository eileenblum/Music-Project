I couldn't help but squirm out from my seat
not quite what I expected
I am constantly relying on others defeat
dare not bare to be humbled, no pressure

pick up your crown
place it where it once belonged
as for that, it's the best that your memory has to offer

take me home
if I never see this place again, good riddance
the sounds will carry me back to home

I'm back to claim what I have conquered
line them up, shoot them down, let's go

I sat back for so long, just to watch it all made me ill
I kept my mouth shut, tell where did that get me?
surrendering to the thrill
as I sit on my throne, I salivate out from my mouth
devour what stands right in my path
I can't abandon it

take me home
if I never see this place again, good riddance
the sounds will carry me back to home

I'm back to claim what I have conquered
line them up, shoot them down, lets go

come one, come all
you all look so well
I've got nothing left to sell
someone should have let you know that I've given you my all
