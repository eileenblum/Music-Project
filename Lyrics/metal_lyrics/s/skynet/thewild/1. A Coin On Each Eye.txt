throw your money on the stage, take a second, explain
like the pest that won't go away, in the presence of waste
the animal has lost its touch
the description fits, covered in bed bugs
the taste that numbs more than the tongue
she wants to get paid

it plays over and over in her head
these pills will have her wound up dead
you scold her, you leave her in this dark world

time's up..

wash it off, this is all so abrasive
harlot is the girl that carries the virus we've all tasted
she rides the new wave, teaches me things I've never heard of
I must confess, her clothes undressed, class dismissed
fuck you!

(taste it, clear your head with the rope that you hang yourself with
have you felt ease in between your knees? do you worship me?
I'm your man, I've got a stack of your saviour in my hand
the difference between you and me is how we see the colour green)

all the money in the world, and all of your prescriptions cannot save you from yourself
you're just a girl
