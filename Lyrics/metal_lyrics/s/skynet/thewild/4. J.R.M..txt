my dear brother,
seven years it's been the grimmest weather I can't fathom
all I have that remains is an apology to you
where would I begin to get through?

say it louder, turn my insides inside out
make it better, turn my insides inside out
rewind the horror, turn my insides inside out
go about it similar on this journey we're walking towards
then change everything (I mean everything)
I was never ready to let go

if this will be the last night that you walk this earth, I'll be more alert
who do you think that you are? you've got it all backwards
remove the veil, the hardest day was saying goodbye to you
you trusted me, I can't bring you back
until then, I'll be screaming up to you

occupy this presence, and make us come forthright in every message
in an everyday hell, it is you that we owe this to (remove remove)
the rude has driven through
we'll be shredding stones on the move,
making only room for improvement into the zone in which you have created
I thank you

say it louder, turn my insides inside out
make it better, turn my insides inside out
rewind the horror, turn my insides inside out
go about it similar on this journey we're walking towards
then change everything (I mean everything)
I was never ready to let go

if this will be the last night that you walk this earth, I'll be more alert
who do you think that you are? you've got it all backwards
remove the veil, the hardest day was saying goodbye to you
you trusted me, I can't bring you back
until then, I'll be screaming up to you

throw the ring in with him
we will raise our fists
we have not forgotten, that's a fucking promise
I owe my life to you
