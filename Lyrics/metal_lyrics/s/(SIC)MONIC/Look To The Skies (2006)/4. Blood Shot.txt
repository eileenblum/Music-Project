This is the blood of the weak blanketed in sacred billowing incisions blowing through you innocently deep ceded visions of the paranormal being living inside you we've got your number written down and we will find you splatter your head to pieces and gouge out your eyes too finally expose the unwritten extortion total chaos mind fuck bleeding abortion

[Chorus:]
Bloodshot fucked forever dig your fucking grave and sever
You are the meaningless foreshadowed death defying symbol of treacherous creation and just because your wallet can purchase souls in seconds does not mean a single thing to me

And just because your wallet can purchase souls in seconds does not mean a fucking single thing to me
And just because you throw yourself to the masses does not mean a fucking single thing to me
Just because your wallet can purchase souls in seconds does not mean a fucking single thing to me
You wanna step up and get that smile knocked off your face I got a pocketful of hate and an onslaught of pain to infest all that I see in doubt and corruption simplify reality to blurry distortion nothing is your god

[Chorus]

nothing is your god
