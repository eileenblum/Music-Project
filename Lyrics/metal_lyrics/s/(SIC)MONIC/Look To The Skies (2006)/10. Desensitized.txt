Suffocate the voices penetrate the noises through walls of deceit I move to see
what this could be and tread ever so softly across this blue sky I will survive
through moments of clarity bathed in severity desperate conviction time elapse
addiction color me in shades so deep I shudder when the angels weep for these
eyes I still do keep a piece of me locked up in side but in times like these it
haunts me for days

[Chorus:]
suffocate the voices penetrate the noises black is your new god viles
of shards that rip you clear open then desensitize the choices penetrate the
noises for closure exposing that you need your knives to feel okay impaled in
your virtue they stifle the beauty of moments like these saints on their knees
blind faith if you please across this blue sky I will survive deep breath to
sigh why cant you look me straight in the eye those red veins envelop your
pupils and lie to me (chorus)
And you need your knives to feel okay they tear apart circles of flesh truth
and all that's in front of you

[Chorus]
