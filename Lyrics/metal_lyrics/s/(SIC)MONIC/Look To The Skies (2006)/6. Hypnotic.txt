So beautiful your own sense of hypnotic face down on the floor your left broken and bleeding
So pitiful your jaw locked on the image face down on the floor your left broken and bleeding
And I know this to be true cause I have been their before in a spiraling image I focus on the damage and the wreckage of every single step that you take so walk with me as I analyze sunlight and in the darkest hour I devour a sense of peace within me but it surely will mutate into the hate that you need

[Chorus:]
Cry to the sky as it whispers haunting memories of the way your bloody eyes suffocate conceptual demise when blended with the vision create a twisted fucked array of lies
This is schizophrenic hypnosis in its purest form follow me down
You crave to be the victim in a system of lies that does feed you you slave away for nothing but holes that do slay and mislead the past is gone this moments blowing through you like the wind oh but it surely will mutate into the face that you feed

[Chorus]

If I could be anyone but me I could be okay for a moment and if I could see all the things you see I could slip away and control this
Follow me down to your grave that's where you will find me

[Chorus]

If I could be anyone but me I could be okay for a moment and if I could see all the things you see I could slip away and control this
Prolific addictive specific inscriptions formulated by your psychotic incisions blinded by the image that does that impede our vision still believe you can exist eyes xed out fucked in very way
