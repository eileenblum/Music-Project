[Pre-verse:]
Infinite is how I dream silently is how loud I scream if eternity cannot be conceived then I will collapse where is stand and disappear if I could only breathe one breathe if I could only say one word
It would be whispered at the break of dawn maybe only a thought heard only by angels as my symmetrical shadow treads beside me a symbol of a deeper meaning inside thee wandering through forests only by moonlight over hills deep into valleys that just might

[Chorus:]
reveal the living breathing transient ambiance of the sacred cadence I have heard for so long it seems like eternity but time will always be misconstrued so in these moment that color you in shades of forever tear down the walls and move through

[Pre-verse]

Oh god I need to know how long I have been here although I'm motionless it seems like a nightmare my last memory I was staring into the sun searching for signs of life all went black and know I come back to life looking eye to eye with the highest cloud objectively analyzing rhythms and patterns know

[Chorus]

In all of these dreams I measure the distance between the falling rain and neverending existence and it recedes below the surface resurrection of a deeper purpose ponder the philosophy of where we do come from what we are made up of in relation to the sun these are the moments that belong to anything but ourselves that realization what Ive been waiting for.
