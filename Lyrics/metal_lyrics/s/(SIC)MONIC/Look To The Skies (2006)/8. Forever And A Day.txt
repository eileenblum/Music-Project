[Chorus:]
Whence forth she came we breathed the same life combined in shallow
halls remain and this lights the way through my darkest day the sharpest gray
peels away the layers that I've made
All I've become is life in its purest form and through all the frequencies
slain in alleyways remain I walk down halls stricken with her voice I came come
on experience the beauty that remains

[Chorus]

And from her fingertips energy do slide come on experience the vertigo inside I
walk down halls stricken with her voice I came come on experience the beauty
that remains

[Chorus]

your heart it bleeds for this moment this is so unreal the devastation
I feel lost between colors same shade no resemblance

[Chorus]
