Ill be the victim bleeding in the gutter you be the phantom in the wind it
shudders send me on my way to soulful sweet decay for the last breath ill wait
in vain the sweet sound that drives me insane every last one of us will
eventually forget why we came

to forget were the same
disconnects our hearts in the same breath ill smash it all with one single
attempt theyâll stand back and scream with contempt that you are not god but
youâre my master better start running through time much faster

[Pre-chorus]
drift to the sound shallow halls of silence impound and
desperation is finally here

[Chorus]
swallow my own reflection voices taunt from all directions

[Pre-chorus]

Its catching up on your heels its plastered self-realization and know your
levitating back through your own deception seems like youâve lost the
connection rifled through time the blackened divine with colors in my mind ill
paint in words sickly sublime the plight of the weak is found in the streets

[Chorus 2x]
