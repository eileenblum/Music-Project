Deep in the stillness of the storm
I lay my body down to rest between these particles of oxygen in liquid form

To leave my home behind and walk to the place where I first believed
all along the way I past where I fell in love with oxygen
and I though that I knew what it means to be fearless to be grateful
all along I merely dwelled in the crevices of the hands that hold me down

Deep in the stillness of the earth
I lay eternity down on its back
and wrap my hands around its neck
to try and choke out

Untie me from this chaos I'm bound to
these memories I walk thru
sanctity, clarity that I found
when all I did was breathe

Remember what it feels like
to be stripped of your dignity
in the moonlight shown
in the light for what you truly are
no more secrets your are exposed
and the lunacy that's coursing through your veins is blacking out your

on move on away

Deep in the stillness of the storm
I lay my body down to rest between these particles of oxygen in liquid form
