All the light fades away darkness now will decay every being on this earth I'm
entranced by suddle ways movements and glances my way haunt me in my dreams
live life like a dream where nothing is quite what it seems the light in your
eyes does gleam burn bright for all to see describe with words that do so
softly take me away to another day crawl through my disarray and find myself
Somewhere beneath the clouds deep stares serenely sound similar to prophetic
lunacy when we fall away rise and return someday our paths are intertwining In
everlasting sun rays walk with the spirit unafraid and let the vision begin
Paradiseum.
