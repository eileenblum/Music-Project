Climb in between the dissonance crouch down and cover your head the impact is
drawing near the sacrifice u made in absolute purity slain in mercy and stained
with regret Will I ever become just who I am?
All these painful delusions I
live with And I dream more then I
could ever live so I crumble and I suffer You wont forgive me you wont forget
this you'll always remember I'll stick the blade in and twist and turn it take
it out and show you your reflection in the side of the blade the last
temptation the final revelation staring into the mirror looking back at myself
as the resolution fades in and out of consciousness my pupils enlarge my spine
is contorting this sacrifice this sacrifice is all I have a dialogue drenched
in vanity incinerated dilated marauded landscapes tongues torn from their mouth
I can still hear them speaking dig out with a needle this lifeless reflection I
promise to always be your perfect failure redundant and blessed under shards of
ice get down on your knees push your head down further beg to be exalted
sacrificial malice look straight up at the sky I still can't fucking hear
you..Sacrificed in the name of God Sacrificed...I've got visions that make me
twitch sow another stitch shovel one more ditch someday I'll die in the name of
it oh but my skin is numb to the cut 'a continual sacrifice this shame that
dwells this shame that dwells...separate the body from the mind these places
you'll always remain a shattered distortion of blood and grace play the fucking
victim you wear it so well...no more will I breathe no longer will I see...cause
here in this moment I cease to exist...and you may find yourself beyond the
boundaries of this universe balancing between the stars that light the way oh
but in reality you've separated yourself so tell me what do you have left to
behold?
this is the last chance for your malice and your redemption so tell me
what you've
truly become staring into the mirror looking back at myself staring into the
mirror looking back at myself resolution fades seeking forgiveness for all that
I've done
