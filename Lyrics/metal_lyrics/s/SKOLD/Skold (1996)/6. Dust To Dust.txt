Don't ask me
I don't know
I don't care
I never did
It don't matter
You can't change it
You can't fight it
It's guaranteed

Dust to Dust
Dust to Dust
Say goodbye now 'cause you'll be gone forever
Dust to Dust
Dust to Dust
Say goodbye now 'cause you wont be coming back
Dust to Dust x4

Just a moment
Lost in time
Like a tear
In the rain

No prophecies
No theories
No accident
No coincident
The future past
Will come at last
No alibi
Its time to die

Dust to Dust [x6]
Say goodbye now 'cause you'll be gone forever
Dust to Dust
Dust to Dust
Say goodbye now 'cause you wont be coming back

Dust to Dust
Dust to Dust
Say goodbye now 'cause you'll be gone forever
Dust to Dust
Dust to Dust
Say goodbye now 'cause you wont be coming back
Dust to Dust [x8]
