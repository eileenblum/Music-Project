You left me stranded here
Abandoned and alone
With silly memories 
Of things I've never known
So when the mystery
is starting to grow old
Another dream goes by
Like ashes out of gold

[chorus]
Hail Mary
Hail Mary
Hail Mary
Won't you take my hand
Hail Mary
Forgive me Father for I do not understand

Just like the brightest light 
Will fade away to black
There comes a time when there's 
No reason to look back
I gave you everything
I gave you all I had,
And when it all comes down
I know I won't be sad

[chorus x4]

Forgive me Father for I do not understand
