Doesn't matter if the world stop turning,
I don't think I'd even care.
And if God decides to drop the curtain,
It won't matter much to me..

Granted clemency, I loose myself in apathy. 
Perverse affinity, a self induced amnesia. 
No discrepancy, my ignorance will set me free. 
Erase my memory, I suffocate in hate. 

[chorus]
Lost, It slowly went away,
Was gone without a trace,
I'm tired and I can't remember.
Lost, I thought it came to stay,
And put me in my place,
I'm tired and I won't remember.

Like the night I embraced the strange and lonely,
Bring me shelter in the dark.
It don't matter if the sun stop shining,
It might save me from what's real.
Save me from whats real.
Save me from whats real.

[chorus]

Granted clemency, I loose myself in apathy.
Perverse affinity, a self induced amnesia.
No discrepancy, my ignorance will set me free.
Erase my memory, I suffocate in hate.

[chorus x2]
