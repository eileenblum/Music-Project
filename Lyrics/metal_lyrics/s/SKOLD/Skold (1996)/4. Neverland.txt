Say hello to nevermore,
There's no justice left worth fighting for,
Drown your faith in disbelief,
And base your morals on deceit and greed.
Say goodbye to all you know,
Hold your breath and let your conscience go,
Put your faith in Jesus cash,
Close your eyes and let the system crash.
In a crown of razor wire, kiss me now.

[chorus]
If I loose my faith - It would be too late,
Right back to neverland.
It would drag me down - Suck me underground,
Right back to neverland.

Sell me hope in little pills,
The fastest way to break the human will.
A barefoot walk through broken glass,
Maybe something I can feel at.. at last.
In a crown of razor wire, kiss me now.

[chorus]

You don't understand,
I'm down the hole again,
never enough, its never enough.
You can't comprehend,
I'm back on the cross again,
never enough, its never enough.

[chorus]

If I loose my faith - It would be too late.
It would drag me down - Suck me underground.

Right back to neverland.
Right back to neverland.
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
You don't listen.
You don't listen.
