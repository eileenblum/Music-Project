I've got a habit
I've got a vice
I've got a problem 
With advice
I've got a hunger
I've got a lust
An alter ego 
I can't trust 
I don't even wanna know 
How much further I can go

[chorus]
Devil inside, got no religion
Devil inside, ain't got no pride
Devil inside, enjoy addiction
Don't need no alibi
Devil inside, get tired of waiting
Devil inside, just wanna ride
Devil inside, make the decision
Never question why 

I ran out of money
I ran out of luck
I hit rock bottom
I got fucked
I put the demon
Under my skin
Sweet Armageddon,
Came crashing in
I don't even wanna know
How much further I can go

[chorus x2]

Deep inside of me
Filling me with agony
Slowly killing me
I look but I don't wanna see

[chorus]

Deep inside of me
Filling me with agony
Slowly killing me
I look but I don't wanna see [x2]
