Chaos...
Power, money, holy roads
Information overload
Leave me in the bitter cold to die
Killing time has just begun
Clinging to a holy gun
Leave me in the blazing sun to die
You get nothing
Except what you steal
I've got a cut in my soul
That just won't heal

Inject myself with cyanide
Break on through to the other side
Gimme one more try
One last lie goodbye

[chorus]
Chaos
You got a one way ticket to
Chaos
You go down
Chaos
You got a one way ticket to
Chaos, Chaos

Breaking every promise made
Redefine a better way
Asphyxiating while I pray, I'm dead
Destroy, offend and terrorise
With noting left to vandalise
You can't make me compromise, I'm dead
You get nothing
Except what you steal
I've got a cut in my soul
That just won't heal

Inject myself with cyanide,
Break on through to the other side
Gimme one more try
One last lie goodbye

[chorus x2]

So if you think you're in control
Its dragging you further down the hole
Right when you thought it all would end
All of the pain is back again
Every attempt to make it stop
Is taking you right back to the top
Nothing you do can change it now
Not that it matters anyhow

[chorus x4]
