Hell bent
Outta hand
You still think you're heaven sent

Right back
right on track
No way you'll get off my back

I've got your naggin' ringin' in my head
You're gonna keep on bitchin' `till I'm dead

Shut up
You're talkin' to a wall
Shut up
I've heard it all before
Shut up
Can't take it anymore
So, Shut up Shut up

Eject, Intellect
Best damn thing you'll ever get

Fat lip, Power trip
No way you'll make me submit

I've got your naggin' ringin' in my head
You're gonna keep on bitchin' `till I'm dead

Shut up
You're talkin' to a wall
Shut up
I've heard it all before
Shut up
Can't take it anymore
So, shut up shut up
shut up
Or tell me something new
Shut up
There is no point to prove
Shut up
I've had enough of you 
so shut up shut up
Shut up [x2]
