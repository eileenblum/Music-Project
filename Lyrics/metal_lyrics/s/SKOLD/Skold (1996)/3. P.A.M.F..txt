I'm just another motherfucker,
I'm just another piece of trash,
I'm just another fuckin' sucker,
So blow it out your ass,
I don't need you, you don't need me.

I'm just another fuckin' looser,
Got the short end of the stick,
And if you sit any closer,
You'll be sitting on my dick.
I don't need you, you don't need me,
Get outta my face and leave me be.

Punkassmotherfucker Fuck off [x3]
Punkassbitch

Why don't I tell you that I'm sorry
I'm only in it for the cash
Why don't I tell you I'm a junkie
You're only here to see me crash
I don't need you, you don't need me

Fuck off Punkassmotherfucker [x4]
Motherfucker [x7]

I'm just another motherfucker
I'm just another piece of trash
I'm just another fuckin' sucker
So blow it out your ass
I don't need you, you don't need me
Get outta my face and leave me be

Fuck off Punkassmotherfucker [x6]
Motherfucker [x7]
