I go down on my knees
I do everything I can to please
I give in, I obey
I comply with every word you say
I give up all control
Existing for you're beck and call
Nothing left to defend
I surrender everything I am

I'll do anything
Anything you want
I'll do anything
I'll do anything
Anything at all
I'll do anything

Make me plead, make me beg
Punish me across your leg
I'm the slut, I'm the slave
Make me promise that I will behave
Tie me down, fill me up
You decide when I've had enough
I'm the bitch, I'm the whore
You give me all you got but I still want more

I'll do anything

Anything you want
I'll do anything
I'll do anything [x3]

Anything at all
Anything at all
Suffer and be used
After all I've done for you
Submission
Commit to the abuse
After all I still love you
Submission [x3]

I'll do anything

Anything you want
I'll do anything
I'll do anything [x4]

I'll do anything
I'll do anything
Anything you want
Anything at all
