It's dark and I'm lonely
So cold, so alone
So much that I know now
I should have known then
But what does it matter
I won't try again
All I remember
I wish I'd forget
Never say never 
And that's what you get

[chorus]
I tried to stall 
And took the fall
Wouldn't make the call
Now I've got nothing left at all
I thought I'd win
But I gave in
I lost again
Now I've got nothing left at all

Nothing's the matter
It won't happen here
You'd think you'd know better
Blind to the fear

I've lost my religion
Lost all I believe in
My memory's in shackles 
I'm down on my knees
It's dark and I'm lonely
So cold, so alone

[chorus x2]
