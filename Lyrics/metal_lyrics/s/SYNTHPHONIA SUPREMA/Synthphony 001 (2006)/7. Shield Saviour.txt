IÂ´ve lost my watch and thereÂ´s no time
For me to listen to you now
A circuit breaker turns me "off"

Silence speaks to me of my dreams
My sensor feels IÂ´m overwrought
A fall in tension makes me dark

I need a shield saviour
To set my mind free from "Error"
I need a shield saviour

Silence guides me! A flux of particles
Gives me power to carry on
When the quiet pole is hard to find
When no one says the things I want to hear!

I need a shield saviour
To set my mind free from "Error"
I need a shield saviour
I need a shield saviour
I need a shield saviour
