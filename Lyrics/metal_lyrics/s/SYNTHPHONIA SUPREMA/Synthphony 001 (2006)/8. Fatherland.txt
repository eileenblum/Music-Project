They wrote your names in red
Red means blood, blood to tread (on)
The lives you knew, flew away like dust
For the idea of a perfect way to control
You all, the minds, the souls, your world
It was like a nightmare all along
It was like the singing of this song

Fatherland - Power in my hand
Iron hand - This is not your promised land
Fatherland - Wait for my command
At my command - There will be the end!

And now itÂ´s over, all you are is dung
But of your remains the earth is clung
If someone has survived, it doesnÂ´t matter
One drop in the ocean canÂ´t be better
Than a thousand people blinded by the power
You can cry in the wind or scream from a tower
But what you talk about is too cruel to believe
ItÂ´s them who write this story...
While the others forgive...

Fatherland - Power in my hand
Iron hand - This is not your promised land
Fatherland - Wait for my command
At my command - There will be the end!

Fatherland - Power in my hand
Iron hand - This is not your promised land
Fatherland - Wait for my command
At my command - There will be the end!
