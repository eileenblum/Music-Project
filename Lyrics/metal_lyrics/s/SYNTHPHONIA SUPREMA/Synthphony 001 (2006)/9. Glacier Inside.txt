[Bonus Track]

You can see what I am
You can know my name
Now that I rule over the land
To a glacier youÂ´ll fall
If you challenge me
Because my arm was made of steel

To fight against me is to
Pay in blood and tears
The glacier will kill your black soul
Space is always my guide
On time I ride
The Gods are always by my side...
My enemy will die!

You are called by the light
So, take you life and fight
Your enemies will soon fall!
You are called by the light
... Fear is only a lie

You are called by the light
So, take you life and fight
Your enemies will soon fall!
You are called by the light
... Fear is only a lie

Your enemies will soon fall!

I have a glacier inside!
