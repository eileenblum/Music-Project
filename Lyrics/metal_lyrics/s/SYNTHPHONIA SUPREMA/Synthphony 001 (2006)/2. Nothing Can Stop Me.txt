Lightening in the galaxy
Something makes me strong
Beyond the laws of gravity
Floating far from home

I will keep the legacy
Of the lord of all
What they see is not a dream
Of a starless world

Nothing else can change my plans
And my destiny one more time
IÂ´ll go to war

Starway through the universe
No one sees my wings
WeÂ´ve chosen the way we feel
We are warrior kings

Fighting, winning, singinÂ´ out
Inner forces grow
All your fears and silent tears
Now you have to throw away, and

Nothing else can change my plans
And my destiny one more time
IÂ´ll go to war

IÂ´ll be there when you cry my name
Nothing can stop my ride
Through the galaxies and time
IÂ´ll return!

Nothing else can change my plans
And my destiny one more time
IÂ´ll go to war

IÂ´ll be there when you cry my name
Nothing will stop my flight
Through the galaxies and time
IÂ´ll be there when you cry my name
Nothing can stop my ride
Through the galaxies and time

IÂ´ll return!... Through the galaxies and time
