"There is nothing waiting out there
Dreadful dreamers"
Silences that make your breath away
Silent screams that rise towards
A God who has forgotten us
"Closed like dogs, you wonÂ´t get out
You wonÂ´t get out alive"

My war - Scream of pain
My war - Word of the beast
My war - Lie of freedom

Work gives freedom, bodies are chained
"We are about to
Reach perfection for the highest race"
But our memory wonÂ´t ever die
This dead flesh will never forget

My war - Scream of pain
My war - Word of the beast
My war - Lie of freedom

Is the point of no return

"Dust to dust
Trash to trash
You are dust
And you are ash
You were dust and to dust you will return
You were trash and to trash you will return"

My war - I believe in
My war - I believe in
My war - Just believe in my war...

My war - Scream of pain
My war - Word of the beast
My war - Lie of freedom
