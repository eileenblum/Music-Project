In a world of space cars, in a world of software
Who is the fool one that never walks under a ladder?
In a world of Hi-tech, in a world of grey lands
A broken mirror? It is only economical damage

We donÂ´t believe in these old tales...
A black cat is crossing my road

In a world of robots, in a world of steel birds
Would you not eat if we were 13 around the table?

We donÂ´t believe in these old tales...
A black cat is crossing my road

Black Cat!

We donÂ´t believe in these old tales...
A black cat is crossing my road

Black Cat donÂ´t cross my road!

Black Cat!

IÂ´m gonna spare you Black Cat!
