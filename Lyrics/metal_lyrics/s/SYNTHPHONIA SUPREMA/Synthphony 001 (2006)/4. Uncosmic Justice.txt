I am the law in this fallen world
Where "sinners" live
I am the Fileader of this world
YouÂ´re trapped in my web
Someone tries to escape from my words
Revenge awaits them
I donÂ´t care if you are young or old
YouÂ´ll pay for your evil

And soon the uncosmic justice will strike
ItÂ´s time for everyone to rise

"I have lost my dreams in this world,
I burn inside"
Please, donÂ´t be afraid Â´cause in my world
Revenge is rising
People feel my words within their hearts
They cry "Forgive me"
These terrestrial laws make you the one
Who can laugh last

And soon the uncosmic justice will strike
ItÂ´s time for everyone to rise

They donÂ´t know: Within my velvet glove
An iron blow lies I keep your lost dream inside my heart
I fight with you, so an eye for an eye is always my divine
Existence vision and this world is really very hard...
For all my enemies!

And soon the uncosmic justice will strike
ItÂ´s time for everyone to rise
And soon the uncosmic justice will strike
ItÂ´s time for everyone to rise
