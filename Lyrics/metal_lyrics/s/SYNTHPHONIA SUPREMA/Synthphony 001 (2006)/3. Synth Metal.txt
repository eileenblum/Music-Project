An electric hammer hits hard
The power of the earth in an endless railway
Now you have to line up the lights
The metal master calls our names from the sky
"When the steel appeared in the world
The dynasty of the king had begun to rule
Today a new millennium is here
And you are the Fileader...

Fly beyond the walls of sound
You will be immortal, you will be the one
You will be the leader who can
Sing with us the Hymn of the great Synth ruler"
An electric storm in my head
The fury of the wind and my silver hairÂ´s flying
I feel doom and blood in all my years
But now IÂ´m the fileader!

We ride... endless power in my heart...
We fight... for Synth Metal!

Synth Metal
Synth Metal

We ride... endless power in my heart...
We fight... for Synth Metal... Synth Metal!

Tomorrow is today
Tomorrow is today
