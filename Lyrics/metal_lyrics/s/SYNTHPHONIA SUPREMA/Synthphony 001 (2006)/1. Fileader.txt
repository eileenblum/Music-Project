Your life is just a game of mine
IÂ´ll stop the passing of your time
JusticeÂ´s by my side
I see your life burning bright

IÂ´ll be your ice when youÂ´re cold
Like dust when your tongue is dry
Your angel of death
Will burn your life at my command

IÂ´ll be the file-storm when you sail
Your game is over now youÂ´ll die
YouÂ´ve got nowhere to hide
Your chance is gone, so die in pain

All in one, justice for all
Revenge is your reason, Â´cause youÂ´re the

Fileader, only you can move the poles
Fileader... rules!

IÂ´m the fileader of the world!
