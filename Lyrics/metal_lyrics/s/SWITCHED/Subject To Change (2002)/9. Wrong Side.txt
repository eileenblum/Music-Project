I've made some mistakes, in my life. I've pushed away, and I feel alone. Wait for something more, I will shed this part of me ... Take my will from me, you burn my eyes but I can't see. Confuse our lives with misery. You lock me out, and throw away the key. And I feel alone. Every morning I wake up on the wrongside
