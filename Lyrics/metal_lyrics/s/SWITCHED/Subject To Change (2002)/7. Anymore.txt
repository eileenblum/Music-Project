It took years to understand this situation. All that's left is desperation, calling out your name. Fake your way to hopes and dreams. But you realize it ain't as it seems. Torch my trust in flames, with your ignorance. Hate, suffocation, hate, i'm raw, hate, devastation, hate, installed. You rise, you fall, I can't believe you anymore. You rise, you fall, you won't change me anymore. Throw away your mask, and show me who you are. An imitation is all you'll be. Why can't you grasp, and take ahold. Cause it's too long to wait and see. You'll fall ... Im sick of your lies, Anymore
