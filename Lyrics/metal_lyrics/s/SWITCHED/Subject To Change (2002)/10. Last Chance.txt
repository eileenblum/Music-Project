Why do I try to mend this pain, it haunts me. The times we spent, only memories washed away ... I'll wait another day searching for you, my friend. What have you done to deserve this. My last chance ... and now you're gone. My last chance ... i've waited too long. I'll reflect, the choices i've made to end this sorrow. I'll wait another day searching for you, my friend. What have you done to deserve this. I'll shed another tear remembering. Cause I can't get you out of my mind. I couldn't save you, but I can save me. Try to walk a straight line in a crowd of thieves. No need to waste what you've been given. But you can't shake those temptations. Strangle you like a fool. I couldn't save you. I should have stopped you when I had the chance to say goodbye. I waited too long. And i've waited ...
