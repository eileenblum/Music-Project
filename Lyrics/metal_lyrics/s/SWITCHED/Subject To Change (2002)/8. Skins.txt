i will not believe this is killing me face to face but still i cant concieve and its all coming down to fast to ignore and my body aches i wanna feel no more hate me for what i have destroyed but i fail to see when everything comes crashing down on me lay down beside me under my skin - letting go until i release all these scars left behind me so how could you take this from me its seems your out of reach but i fail to see when everything comes crashing down on me lay down beside me under my skin - letting go lay down beside me under my skin - losing control under my skin im losing control... i will be free... lay down beside me under my skin - letting go lay down beside me under my skin - losing control
