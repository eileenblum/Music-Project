It's on my face a pale disguise
in disgust i close another chapter to my life
and it's so hard to understand
cause i dont care and i dont care
so why dont you leave me here
why dont you leave me here
cause im better off dead and im better off dead

say you will not follow me
i take this path alone
say you will not follow me...you whore
stay away, stay away

wash my hands from years of regret
scrape away the dirt that i left
and its taking its tool, down on me
and im better off dead, better off dead

say you will not follow me
i take this path alone
say you will not follow me...you whore
stay away, stay away
reflections, reflections

ignore you attempts to weaken my streangth
i was expecting more
into yourself shell you run from me
to be, just like me say you wont follow me
you turned out just like me

say you will not follow me
i take this path alone
say you will not follow me...you whore
stay away, stay away
reflections, reflections
