these tears run down my face of signs of redemtion i swallow in my sadness i'll never pull a shame hung by strings like puppets in a play run like slaves nowhere to escape no sun burns through these darkening days hard to imagine i could be this way i hate to see these darkening days so deep my motivation when the time is on my side everything ive had ive wasted ive gambled all my life hung by strings like puppets in a play run like slaves nowhere to escape no sun burns through these darkening days hard to imagine i could be this way i believe you believe you i hate to see these darkening days looks like all the time i need to unwind i cant be the way you wanted me to be constant pride ive frozen mine im losing mine hung by strings run like slaves no sun burns through these darkening days hard to imagine i could be this way i believe you believe you i hate to see these darkening days no sun burns through these darkening days hard to imagine i could be this way i believe you believe you i hate to see these darkening days these darkening days
