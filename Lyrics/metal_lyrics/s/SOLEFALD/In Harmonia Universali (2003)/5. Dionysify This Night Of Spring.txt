{Dionysos, god of wine and ecstasy
Attend this vernal feast, with satyrs and bacchantes -
fury, strings and  choirs create a canvas in your honour}

Mademoiselle, please enter this night of spring
Undress to the sound of carcassing chorals
"Dionysify this night of spring", dionysified they sing
The Aphrodite Loveroom glows with ruby walls
I gently tie you up in a bondage so mild
Your eyes float in the sea of red Bordeaux wine
I kiss you all over, passsion-blind
In the sea of white swims the albino crocodile
I tenderly adore the taste of your she
In this cathedral of cinnamon and sodomy
Strong colours congregate on the outer canvas
The motive of worship is your humid ass
Mademoiselle, this night is all yours
Choose from three thousand possible doors
