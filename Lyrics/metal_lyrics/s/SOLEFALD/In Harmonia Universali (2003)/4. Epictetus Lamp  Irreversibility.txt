{Epictetus, freed slave
Turned stoic thinker

Expelled from Rome
for seeking virtue and wisdom

In Nature, the city of gods
He found his destiny
In simplicity and dignity}

What do I care about you, when all must die
What  does your face mean to me, When
All my eyes can seize, must die

What is your warmth to me, it will not last
What about your hair, can it do
What the atoms will, last

What is music, a drug forever falling
What do you care about words, as you do
What the bombs keep doing, fall

What do I  think of you, Amor, when all must die
What are your smiling winds to me
All their beauty and grace must die
