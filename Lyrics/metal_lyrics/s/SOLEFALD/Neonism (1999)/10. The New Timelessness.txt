Proprietors of Red and Priests against Prozac
Propose one hour of messainic mozart
Wolfgang Amadeus a.k.a. Muzak
Got himself a VISA and went wild in the popmart
The 23rd player thrashing the rest of his team
Flashed his ability to discard the mainstream
Largo to presto he grieves the accelerando's finite
Headphones on tight more beats per minute
Stepping on his watch enters the state of Freedia
Fucking the hostility inherent in the media
From chronological to kairological
Measure of the linear time unjustly installed
as the distinguo between work and pleasure
Serial time personal sublime
Immortalizing the point on the time
That's meandered in a circle
The revolution of all the small parts that constitute the cosmos
in which you speed for a paradise
moving just ahead but slightly faster
Middle-aged monster get out of here!
Cyclical patterns don't fit your square ear
Sensing so slowly you mistake the Sunset of Sole
For the longed-for legendary sunrise of old
Your sexist ratio pervades the hearts
Your racist sexio misinterprets the arts
Decay's seized your sensorial protection
The only thing evil's your own perception
We rest on day seven
On day eight we blast heaven
