A sotto voice sang for the soprano singer
Whose tyrannical arais won't cease to linger
Bob's out there none of us play cool
Classmates in a haunted school
Agent Dale Cooper won't take you any higher
C'mon li'l boy 'n play with the fire
Surrounded by the presence of the absent teacher
Both knowing silence as the music of the future
Surrendered at the sepent's burning gates of fear
If you think that this is hell the truth's in there
The world situation calls for evacuation
We wait in the dark for the next ejaculation
Your black fingernails clasp the candelabra
Turn the light on I see the abracadabra
Naomi does the catwalk even when it snows
Male photographers so envious it shows
The stage their temple their trampoline to trance
Trampled and turned by the transvestite's dance
It isn't Naomi it's the Marlboro Man
If you want to run I understand
The night dies on a daily basis
The solar orbit doesn't disturb my ekstasis
Searching for knowledge in the spirit of Tintin
Alone on a plain with Plato and Plotin
My forehead bronzed by the Lamborghini moon
I'm out of my night tomorrow at noon
Lead the suntan astray kick the cancer away
I'll kill my ego on a hidden highway
Invoke the big silence on this small disc
Trespasser listener on your own risk
Outside of our chords and choirs of the sublime
Reality is nothing but a heartbeat in time
Outside of the bass and the blitzing blastbeat
A massive vacuum whose ambition's complete
All-sound without sound booming all around
All-sound without sound booming all around
Enjoy the years of work in these minutes of movement
You evolve in our improvement
With a linear scaffold still to fulfill
I exercise a style of radical will
Accelerate the ratioplane past the sound barrier
To accomplish the bang the whole of my career
Masculine motorcar technowork sublime
Be beaten or compete this is the last heat
The Tiger Sky's jaws break the neck of time
Speed increased to scaffold
Silence be complete
