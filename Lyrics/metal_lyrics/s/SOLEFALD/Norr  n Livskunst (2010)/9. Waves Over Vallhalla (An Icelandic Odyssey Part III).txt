As the last god on Earth I ask for a whisky
The floodwave took it all life up here is risky
What can I tell you the giants pulled us under
A sky-high tsunami black walls of thunder

My Third Valhalla was splintered by the waves
I knew at heart no bloody magic saves
In solitude divine I mourn the greatest loss
The golden world of gods everything that was

Creator Destroyer I am Allfather again
The nine worlds went under except for number ten
One for Being Yggdrasil in my hand
Zero for the lifeless Nothingness' land

I curse the Norns that weave the Vital Code
Life both good and evil to rise and to erode
Cells feed on matter feeds on cells feed on matter
If a body is to grow it needs another one to shatter

Life requires Death to seep through the pores of Time
A mytholife like Sisyphos that continues to climb
It menas that no life is pure not even my own
Also Odin's veins are host to a giant's seed sown

So what I create 'twill have a twofold nature
The Twilight of the Gods was not an erasure
What hurts the most is that if I kill the enemy
His essence still lurks deep down within me
