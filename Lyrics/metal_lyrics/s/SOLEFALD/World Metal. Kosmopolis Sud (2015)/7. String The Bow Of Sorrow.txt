STRING THE BOW OF SORROW

A vessel filled with flowers burning in the bay
The giver of life claimed by death so fast
String the bow of sorrow for a salute
Arrows of eternity, of all the ones I loved

So many departures, so many women gone
I swim the sea of tears, covered with salt
Now I know what it feels like to lose protection
Your body is gone, it left me in a hearse

It may sound cynical, but this life is mine
Life is for the living, that is undeniable
When your image is gone, my face will be blue
Through time and space, womanity be one

You're no more in the phonebook
The statements have been written
Goodbye, Norwegian mother
The quiver of time is empty

SOLEFALD, 15.9.1995

La martyren salve sine sÃ¥r,
Solefald
Er jeg ditt fiolette fragment?

La naturen klage sine Ã¥r,
Solefald
Hvem av oss har linsen som blinder?

Jeg ante ditt nÃ¦rvÃ¦r i min drÃ¸m
Solefald
SÃ¥ jeg bakom honningens ansikt?

Mystikkens fjes forsvinner med deg,
Solefald
Synker ned i den siste dvale

Snu for meg din fatale bane,
Solefald
Stig fra en heroisk horisont

You liked AC/DCs Â«Hell's BellsÂ», but Slayer was no stayer:
I know how much you hated that Slaytanic Wehrmacht patch
In the end, you did set it onto my black denim jacket
I picture your afterlife in Freya's wooden halls
Robed in light colours as an Art Nouveau lady
You go for walks in the forest of oaks
Where bumblebees hum and blackbirds sing
Maybe you paint watercolour like you used to
Enjoy cake and champagne and immortal youth
I will leave you here, where you sat with your parents
On the simple wooden staircase
Where bumblebees hum and blackbirds sing
As the evening breeze sways the firs in the sunset
- Solefald
