2011, OR A KNIGHT OF THE FAIL

Hey Andrew Lacoste, I say welcome to Hell
Playing killer games in your solitary cell
Mr. Coward, what went wrong with your head
A murderer of children, and still you aren't dead

On July 21st, I saw Gurnemanz mourn
In the ruins of '45, his uniform torn
Parsifal in Bayreuth, a Knight of the Grail
The Dictatorship defeated, a quest doomed to fail

A wedding in Norway, the conductor's hand beckoned
I flew out on July 22nd
Landed in Oslo at 15:22
Three minutes later the Terror became true

Saw Government buildings going in smoke
I thought it was a video, it had to be a joke
Stayed in the airport, safe and at distance
Hardly a position that offers resistance

Dramatize the Untergang, don't we, my artist friends
That sweet sensation of an Angst that never ends
But all a sudden, the threat became real
Expanding ammunition made wounds that wouldn't heal

Hey Andrew Lacoste, I say welcome to Hell
Playing killer games in your solitary cell
Mr. Coward, what went wrong with your head
A murderer of children, and still you aren't dead

I thought it was a film, it couldn't be right
Terror took the form of a lunatic Knight
Disguised as a policeman he killed 77
That was Oklahoma, our September 11th

On the day two months after I lost my loved mother
Everything changed from one day to another
All of a sudden, my grief was ours
The young kept on dying, in spite of the powers

That tried to help them, but the evil was strong
And "you did this", O Heinous, the irreparable wrong
In the Nation of Tolerance, the end of a Pact:
People thought it was Islamist, Muslims were attacked
Hey Andrew Lacoste, I say welcome to Hell
Playing killer games in your solitary cell
Mr. Coward, what went wrong with your head
A murderer of children, and still you aren't dead

The Kingdom wept and protested with roses
I kept my uniform on and continued my poses
They gathered at Young's and sang children's songs
I kept listening to Burzum, unrepenting my wrong

To mother and daughter, to father and son:
I think Grief made us mad, each and every one
I had wept for four months and only felt rage
Gone were the days of the lyricist sage

I saw analysts grapple with Freedom of Expression
Using he massacre as a reason for Repression
I spoke out against them, here Justice ends
Not the kind of message that wins you new friends

2010, before everything went black
2010, now it's time to look back

TOTENINSEL

Skyene pÃ¥ himmelen
vatnet i sjÃ¸en
doggen pÃ¥ bÃ¥tane

kjem frÃ¥ andedragi
Ã¥t dei som sÃ¸v
under sypressane
