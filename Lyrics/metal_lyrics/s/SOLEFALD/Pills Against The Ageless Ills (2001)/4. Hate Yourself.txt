[C:] Hate yourself and I will make you happy
I am not a happy boy I refuse to believe 
That if I hate myself I will become happy
When the trendy believers refuse to relieve
Relieve me of their lies
[L:] They say hate yourself and I will make you happy
I am not a happy boy I refuse to believe 
That if I hate myself I will become happy
When the trendy believers refuse to relieve
Hate yourself you are not good enough
Hate yourself they have told you before
Hate yourself there is always someone better
Hate yourself they fight an anorexic war
[C:] Hate yourself you deserve to die
Hate yourself they have told you before
Hate yourself you are too weak
Hate yourself they fight an anorexic war
[L:] Hate yourself you deserve to die and
Hate yourself they have told you before
Hate yourself you are too weak and
Hate yourself they fight an anorexic war
[L:] Hate yourself nobody loves you
Hate yourself they have told you before
[C:] Hate yourself you are left alone
Hate yourself they fight an anorexic war
[L:] I say hate yourself like Kate Moss
Hate yourself they fight an anorexic war 
Hate yourself like an xxx actor
Hate yourself you can take some more
[C:] Hate yourself with a touch of glamour
Hate yourself and smile at the anorexic war
Hate yourself suffering is sexy
Hate yourself you're their corporate whore
[L:] Hate yourself suffering is sexy
Hate yourself you're their corporate whore
Hate yourself like everybody else
Hate yourself they have told you before
Hate yourself money ain't enough
Hate yourself you want some more
Hate yourself continents are starving
Hate yourself you fight their anorexic war
[C:] Hate yourself like a pornographer
Hate yourself like I do
No way to improve 
No way to do it better
Just suffer suffer suffer! [x 2]
Suffer! Suffer! Suffer! Suffer!
