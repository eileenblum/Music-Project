[C:] One day I'll return with another man's clothes
One day I'll return with another man's name
[L:] I am all alone
Existence has no friends
I feel the emotion that never ends
[L &amp; C:] I'm sleeping on the edge of a knife 
Don't wake me up from the meaning of my life
There never were equality and freedom
In a world of individuals there is only boredom
[C:] There is lust in all repentance
And remorse in all desire [x 2]
[L:] I want to dissolve myself and to unify
With stupid ideals that are but a lie
To rid myself of what belongs to me
But I remain an I that talks about an I
See?
I fear the fatigue of the love that went
Down the drain without asking for my consent
Loved one
I miss you too much
The way you gave me the healing touch
[L &amp; C:] There is no kindness
Only desire
There is no kindness
Only desire
[C:] The grand devouring fucking fire
The grand devouring fucking fire 
No kindness around me
Only fire
The grand devouring fucking fire
[L:] There is no kindness
Only desire
There is no kindness
Only desire 
The grand devouring fucking fire
The grand devouring fucking fire 
No kindness around me
Only fire
The grand devouring fucking fire
[C:] I fear the fatigue of the love that went
Down the drain without asking for my consent
Loved one
I miss you too much
The way you gave me the healing touch
There is no kindness
Only desire
No kindness around me 
Only fire
That rips up every truth and leaves it a lie
That beats me asunder and makes me want to die
[L:] Without any reason
Because I have it all
That might be why
Cannot climb
Only
[L &amp; C:] Fall!
