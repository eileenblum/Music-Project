[C:] Out of the seven classic arts
Rhetoric rises to bust the charts
The master of agony invites you to the Forum 
Louder than Romanum's decadent decorum
The bell booms GO! The centurion rhymes
Heroically racing for blood-hungry times
Close to the edge he resists their push
Pure strength saves him from the greedy rush
The race has a goal though very few know where
Mostly officers on the ground and satellites in the air
The star-spangled racers speed into house and home
Today the Americans try to recreate Rome
[L:] Leaves flicker across the boulevard
Way down I see my old retard
He said "Ello ma feren, want a nice place to go?
I fix booze girls burgers floorshow!"
(The old retard tells me: 
"Come with me you ain't nothing to lose!"
I refuse the offer I cannot refuse
He hears my no scratches his beard
When Beelzie runs a nightclub times are weird)
[C:] I deny the existence of the USA
Just a fat film with too much to say
[L:] The USA don't exist 
The USA don't exist
The USA don't exist 
Again I'm pissed
[C:] I deny the existence of the USA
Just a fat film with too much to say
[L:] The USA don't exist 
The USA don't exist
The USA don't exist 
Again I'm pissed
[C:] Jim is alone and afraid of '67 
The summer of love never returned from heaven
The hippies slowly died at the Heartbreak Hotel
Where the Peyote Poet reinvented hell
Fifteen years later he returned as a YAP
Just to make sure that life was still crap 
Down and in need of the drugs that made the fun
He soberly declared I need money and a gun
[L:] Fifteen years later he returned as a YAP
[C:] I deny the existence of the USA
Just a fat film with a bit too much to say
[L:] The USA don't exist 
The USA don't exist
The USA don't exist 
Again I'm pissed
[C:] Pornographer Cain haunts from the dead
Sews up Madame with a waxed red thread
The wanderer has found himself a home 
Madame hangs as doll in his sexodrome
It's a man's world and he has seen the need
For yet another man to do the dirty deed
In Rock 'n' Rollywood our guy's at work
Pushing love shit to some fellow human jerk
[L:] It is a man's world and he has seen the need
[C:] I deny the existence of the USA
Just a fat film with too much to say
[L &amp; C:] The USA don't exist 
The USA don't exist
The USA don't exist 
Again I'm pissed
