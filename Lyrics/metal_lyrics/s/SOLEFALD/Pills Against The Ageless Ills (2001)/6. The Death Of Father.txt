[C:] To the sisterhood of the pornographic force
I raise this case to bring an end to our wars
We have not been enemies all the way
Remember our delights in the wild green bay
Father separated us in the garden you know
Father fooled us we were siblings long ago
Father is in my hands drowned in apple juice
Accused and deemed to admit his abuse
[L:] In my solitude and forest the sun bleeds red
In a few seconds Father will be dead
Warm from the womb I will greet the stars
Finally reborn and cleansed of my scars
[C:] Two decades as an eremite deprived of my right
To be part of the brotherhood of the mystic light
To make Father understand how much I missed
His punishment is hard
The penalty is this
Reap as you have sown
Go on your own
Take your evil with you and die alone
The firearms glow white in the hands of the hurt
Black horses drag Father through the dirt
[L:] Sister, let us love when the lights are low
Don't ever wait for the night to go
In black hole solitude my hope glows white
Father has ceased his hold on our light
[C:] His death is my rebirth, the birth I never had
No wonder why our love turned out bad
Let us move out through the foyers and portals
Move on through the vulva of immortals
Sister, let us love when the lights are low
Don't wait for the night to go
In black hole solitude my hope glows white
Father has ceased his hold on our light
