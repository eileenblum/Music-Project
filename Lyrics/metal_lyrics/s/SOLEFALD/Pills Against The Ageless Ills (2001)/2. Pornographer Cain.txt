[L:] My appartment works fine 
No need for locations
It's spacious enough for a camera and some Asians
[C:] At the moment I am working on the Eastern Block
I bet my ladies would love a Serbo cock
[L:] Before shooting the sessions we chill out with a joint
Pump the girls with drugs to make them see the point
[C:] In bonking lousy guys in my stinking cellar
Baby close your eyes if you want your $
[L:] I write the story 
I shoot the scene
Sometimes you see me dance across the screen
My critics claim that my movies are for men
What can I say I'm astonished when
[C:] People understand what I am trying to say
To show the world the American Way (x 2)
