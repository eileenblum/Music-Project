[C:] Last time I saw the sun it blew me off the street
With tremendous force and invincible heat
Its light was too strong, its face beaming hate
At a bat born at day by the fury of fate
Fuck talks to Leonardo Pitt
Am human sweat piss shit
Your heart beats fast when I come up close
To beg for money
Not for a pose 
Fuck talks to Marilyn French
Am inhuman eternal stench
The only time you talk to me is when you need to know
How I can starve eight days in a row
[L:] Last time I saw the sun it blew me off the street
With tremendous force and invincible heat
Its light was too strong
Its face beaming hate
At a bat born at day by the fury of fate
Fuck talks to Leonardo Pitt
Am human sweat piss shit
[C:] Am Fuck and you are afraid of me 
You have learnt from watching TV
Am Fuck the scum you fear
Misery is generous we can share
People that think must always die
They know too well the shit passing by 
Fuck talks to Hitler and Pot
Wipe me off the planet 
Let my body rot
[L:] Your heart beats fast when I come up close
To beg for money
Not for a pose 
Fuck talks to Marilyn French
Am inhuman eternal stench
The only time you talk to me is when you need to know
How I can starve eight days in a row
Fuck talks to Kurt Cobain
Your high life and enduring pain
I shared it once as Pornographer Cain 
Philosopher Fuck repents in the rain
