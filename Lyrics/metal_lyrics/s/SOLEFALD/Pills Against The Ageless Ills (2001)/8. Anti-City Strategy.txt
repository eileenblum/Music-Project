[C:] For the torso begging on Colaba Causeway
For the green-eyed girl on the street in Mumbai
For the grapefruit tumour that entered the taxi 
The bitter reality is far from sexy
[L:] Choose the grave of the classes
Choose another guide
Than the old god who committed suicide
Am the fire that blew up Oklahoma 
Am the wind that demolished Sodoma
[C:] Choose the grave of the classes
Choose another guide
Than the old god who committed suicide
Am the fire that blew up Oklahoma 
Am the wind that demolished Sodoma
The blood that gleams on the butcher's knife
Am filtering Ray-Ban philosophy of life
May my bombs smash The City of No Pity 
Kings and generals have never been pretty 
Am the child's brown teeth
The ribs that broke
The billion lives that never spoke
Broadcast the crucifixion of the poor
Wake the human beings and arm them for war
The Third World War rages below their feet 
Information works for their defeat
Before my fur suits the somber ladies
Before my wolf soul belongs to Hades
Bring wind to the forest of the crosses
Comfort the people who suffered the losses
Stop the media murders
Rumour after rumour 
Kill the weak 
Say it's postmodern humour
[L:] Write my thesis with a razor in the face of lies 
One word for every hope that dies
The blood-stained brokers die as vampires die
Roll their marble staircase on people that cry
[C:] Write my thesis with a razor in the face of lies 
One word for every hope that dies
The blood-stained brokers die as vampires die
Roll their marble staircase on people that cry
Hand out the pills, pass the chalice
Let us die to give the animals some peace
Together for the first time let us drink 
Extinguish everything or what do you think
