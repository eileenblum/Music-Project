O father of truth and marvellous lies
Ignorance the dragon never dies
In the Midgard of men they call you sagateller
In the Asgard of gods they call you dragonkiller
Red words for black thoughts, you cannot be blamed
No name is a secret, no secret is unnamed
The sagas you tell mankind teach them about fate
Songs and legends from times of love and hate
When the words of Odin's art resound through the horn
Heroes and Giants of the ancient epics are reborn
In the Midgard of men they call you sagateller
In the Asgard of gods they call you dragonkiller

[Skald:] The eyes of the universe, the witness of time
Heart and head tied together in rhythm and rhyme
The fury of enemies the madness of the young
There is no thing in the world that is not in your song
Under the silver of a thousand moons
The book of your life was written with runes
Would you know the future of your kin
How White Christ and Black Death were going to win
The Icelanders who hungered the Norwegians who died
Before the doors of Hel, they had their strength tried
Remember the hardships the toil they through
Remember the hardships the battles they lived through
Our blood hails the North pagan Vikings stay true
Red for Fire + Black for Death
Our blood hails the North pagan Vikings stay true
The Icelanders who hungered the Norwegians who died
Before the doors of Hel, they had their strength tried
Remember the hardships the battles they lived through
Our blood hails the North pagan Vikings stay true
Sagateller Dragonkiller
O father of truth and marvellous lies
Ignorance the dragon that never dies
The Icelanders who hungered the Norwegians who died
Before the doors of Hel, they had their strength tried
Red for Fire + Black for Death
Our blood hails the North pagan Vikings stay true
