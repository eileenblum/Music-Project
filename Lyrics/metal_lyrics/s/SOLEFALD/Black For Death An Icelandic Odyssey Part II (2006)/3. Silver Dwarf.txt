I am your friend from way down
Trapped in a dark forever
Silver Dwarf
This place is dead
Silver Dwarf
Night everywhere
Chained to the Tree of Death
I see no birds no life
Silver Dwarf
This is my home
Only these walls know my face
This is the mine where I am stuck
Silver Dwarf
Bowels of greed
Silver Dwarf
Once filled with gold
Friend from the Land of Light
Help me out of darkness
Silver Dwarf
Horses pull me apart
Silver Dwarf
Under the earth
I wish to be strong
But I was born in a mine
Silver Dwarf
Never allowed to leave
Silver Dwarf
Cellar of life
I will dig my way out of here
The Silver Dwarf will see the sun
Silver Dwarf
A closed infinity
Silver Dwarf
Nothing to lose
I am your friend from way down
Spiders eat me
Silver Dwarf
Sunlight and glory
Silver Dwarf
I will make my way up there
