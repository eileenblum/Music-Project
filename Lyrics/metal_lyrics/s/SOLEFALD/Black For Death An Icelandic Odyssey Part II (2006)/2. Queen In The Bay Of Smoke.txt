Treacherous queen
Who abused my good faith
I will take you
Where birds have never been
A knife in my belt
A spear in my hand
To my burning eyes
Your halls are made of glass
Treacherous queen
You abused my good faith
I will take you
Where birds have never been
A knife in my belt
A spearhead in my heart
To my burning eyes
Your walls are made of glass
The age of the heroes
A distant memory
The Iron Law rules Iceland
Evil kings faithless queens
Who hides in the Bay of Smoke
Nothing goes unpunished
Look where you step
You might tread on me
Queen in the Bay of Smoke
Bring supplies
For the worst of your winters
I shall wear your pain
As a golden crown
Whe shall crawl the tunnels
In the dark of the Underworld
A million midgets are waiting for you
Queen in the Bay of Smoke
I tasted your beauty
You threw me to the dogs
I walked as a wolf among the dogs
I walked as a god among the slaves
Queen in the Bay of Smoke
I mÃ¸rket under jorden
ligger dvergenes gruver
Den hvite dronning faller
i Regins svarte hull
Skalden sÃ¸ker
en konges skamhevn
Dronningen dulgt
i smÃ¥folkets berg
Dvergene stimler
om fagermÃ¸ya sammen
Skrekk stÃ¥r Ã¥ se
i Berg-Disas blikk
Hva vondt har jeg gjort?
Hvor tar du meg hen?
TÃ¥resalt drysser
pÃ¥ gulvert av gull
Her skal du bli
svikefulle kvinne
Ta skalden til mann
og skammen i hug
