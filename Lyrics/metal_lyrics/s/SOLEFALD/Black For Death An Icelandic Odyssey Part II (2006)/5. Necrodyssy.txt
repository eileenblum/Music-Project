The black art's dead can't you feel the foul smell
Ten years ago THE CORPSES gave us hell
Now the scene's changed we're still around
The vampires lie six feet deep into the ground
We have engineered a MEDIEVAL WAR MACHINE
Come with us corpse feel your own medicine
Now listen to me to the end of the story
We claim what is ours we HUNGER for glory
Ja you were right music IS war
Now show me the TRUTH that you've fought for
It isn't very much if NOTHING AT ALL
Toss those remains into the Chieftain's hall
Let everybody witness the state of your carcass
All of you devils who wanted to mark us
Come on brand your iron I BET YOU it is cold
Let's see how hard you are growing up and old
The winters of Norway have frozen your brains
At every living thought you SCREAM in seven pains
As Necrophisto I speak the Deity of Hell
Spellbound I will have you tremble to the bell
Join me in battle fight by my side
Together we may run for TRIUMPH AND PRIDE
But if you go against me fight like a man
Make me die with a SWORD IN MY HAND
Give up your life the rags that were you
You'll feed the snakes all the time to stay true
Thank you for all now give up the crown
Our law is here WE RULE YOUR MIND WITH SOUND
Join me in battle fight by my side
Together we may run for TRIUMPH AND PRIDE
But if you go against me fight like a man
Make me die with a SWORD IN MY HAND
