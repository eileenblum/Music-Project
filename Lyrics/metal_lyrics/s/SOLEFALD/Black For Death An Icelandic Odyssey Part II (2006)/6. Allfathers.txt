Allfathers ancestors
I think of you in Odin's hall
Allfathers ancestors
I think of how you crossed the seas
Dirty bearded men who slept in the snow
Can you feel the beauty of Iceland still?
Eagles and icebergs
The white nights of the North
I will fight for your legend
Never forgotten
Combat for your honour
Protect my kin
Allfathers ancestors
What you were I want to be
What you were look at me
Tell me what you see
Do you see a son in me
Or just another man
I am the son of a man
Who was the son of a man
I will fight for your legend
Combat for your honour
What you were I want to be
Now look at me what do you see
Allfathers ancestors
I think of you in Odin's hall
Allfathers ancestors
I think of how you crossed the seas
I will fight for your legend
Combat for your honour
Steel in my hand
Hatred in my eyes
Don't you touch what is mine
Spoil what I hold dear
Defile what I love
Smear pure with impure
Or I shall avenge with sword and axe
Till Hel decides who she wants
To burn
