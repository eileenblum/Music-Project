Burn the edges of your thoughts
-feel the air beneath
Burn the edges of your thoughts
-feel the air beneath

Witness the cosmic dance
From a red view

Burn the edges of your thoughts
-devastating fire
Burn the edges of your thoughts
-devastating fire

Pieces of a paradise never created
Floating on the tide of the human mind
Washing the shores of the microcosmos
Guiding hordes of men
Towards the sick and the blind

-red view-

Ascend, descend - the order of chaos
Stay safe in the eye of the
Renaissance tornado

See the universe unite
And yourself become its key,
And a sense of correlation
Your opportunity
