I have not tasted bread for weeks
Snow is what I eat and drink
My saga the saga of hunger and need
The father of my father ancestors of my kin
The skald told the story of my house

Here I lie like a dead man
A weak wreck of no worth
At the Crater of the Valkyries
The angels of Odin my master

Take the dead home from battle
To Valhalla

Here I am as a nobody
Awaiting the beating of wings
Of the godly women who fill the sky
Black wings on their shoulders

Helmets hide white faces
They will take me to Valhalla
Not as a warrior
Hall of Od
Skald I be

Skald through the runes
Let Fate decide
If you shall live or die
Fall into the volcano
Or still suffer under the stars
Skald do you see the raven
Munin is its name
It turns the rune
That would have you
Fall into the flame

Skald do you see
The raven by your side
As you throw the runes
To settle life or death
Are you still to see

The blue of the sky
Or shall you fall into the fire
Of the mighty volcano Hekla

The raven turns
The rune of your fate
You shall live for vengeance
To have justice done
Return to Reykjavik
To the hall of your king
Show them what you have suffered
Be the man you were

Father of my father
Ancestors of my kin
You had mead to drink
And meat to eat
You lived in crafted halls
And sacrificed to the gods
You sailed black longships
With red shields and dragon heads

Here I lie like a dead man
A weak wreck of no worth
At the Crater of the Valkyries
The angels of Odin my master

Take the dead home from battle
To Valhalla

Here I am as a nobody
Awaiting the beating of wings
Of the godly women who fill the sky
Black wings on their shoulders

I am the memory of all

Helmets hide white faces
They will take me to Valhalla
Not as a warrior
Hall of Od
Skald I be
