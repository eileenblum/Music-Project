You are my tree of life
The nine worlds of manhood
I drink to you, my father
I was like the apple in the hands of the giants
Once you were small, small like me
Once you were the son of a man who was the son of a man
My father, my eyes bleed as you age
Stay on the screen on which the worlds are shown
Stay in the hole where I was safe
Protect me, father
Protect me from the evils I cannot combat alone
