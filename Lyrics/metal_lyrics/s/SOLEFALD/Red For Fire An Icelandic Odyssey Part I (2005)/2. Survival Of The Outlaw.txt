As a hungry wolf with an old man's teeth I run
Freezing cold in caves, forever crushing the sun
The daylight and all time when the weather is clear
I live in night and darkness, that's why I'm still here
Iceland was my home with seals in the fjords
My winter's only thought is fleeing from the hordes
They may come anytime to kill me like a dog
Always on guard I pray for another day of fog
As the outlaw am I shout at the mighty Thor
Greatest god of thunder I can't take it anymore
Take me home where smoke rises from the halls
Make me welcome again within the Chieftain's walls
Drown his treacherous wife the adulterous Queen
Who told the King what a rapist I had been
She lied she was wrong she asked me to seduce her
In her games of sex I was bound to be the loser
She harmed her husband's skald, caused the poet's disgrace
Outlawed at Althingi, I can never show my face
At Reykjanes again, lest I want to endure
All the evils she accused me of doing to her
More bone than man, I hail the gods of the North
Avenge my injustices, I beg you to come forth
Misfortune loves both fool and wise
For seven winters I have strayed the land of ice
A master of the word and a man of the sword
Of tongue and steel many times I proved to be lord
Gods of the North, I beg you come forth
More bone than man Odin I hail you
As a slave on the run I must stay out of sight
Allfather make my destiny right
That in none of the worlds whose number is nine
Another innocent must suffer a fate like mine
As the outlaw I am I shout at might Thor
Great god of thunder I can't take it anymore
Take me to Reykjavik where smoke rises from the halls
Make me welcome again within my Chieftain's walls
