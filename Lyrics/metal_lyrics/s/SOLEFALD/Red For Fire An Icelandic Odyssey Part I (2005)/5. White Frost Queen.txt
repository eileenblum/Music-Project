The wheel of light sets another day
Glowing in the Water of Reykjavik bay

The ground has grown wight with nightly frost
The town is a wake at the sullen gloom's cost

Odin has granted Icelander's the light
To sharpen their swords, to show off their might

For another day in the bay of smoke
Where virtue is strong and weaknesses choke

A king on his throne and a queen by his side
The ruler of men and his principal pride

A blade his companion, the crown his duty
The lady he reveres, her radiant beauty

-Oh queen, grant my wish, make me calm and serene
Please stay by my side, never fly from our scene

I rule this cold land and I herd my flock
I worship the gods on this volcanic rock

But might makes me weary and you are the cure
You keep me strong, that is your allure

Deceitful queen in the land of cold
Smiles to her king, keeps her story untold
