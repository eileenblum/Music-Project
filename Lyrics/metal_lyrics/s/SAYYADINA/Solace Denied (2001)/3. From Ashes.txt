With honour
Give up your body
Save the sick and dying
Nothing to fear

A way out of living hell
A way into death

Now you die
Die for nothing
All this was known
To those above
Your scream for help
Will get you nothing
One million down
One billion to go

A way out of living hell
Looking for a way out of misery
A way out of living hell
A way into death
