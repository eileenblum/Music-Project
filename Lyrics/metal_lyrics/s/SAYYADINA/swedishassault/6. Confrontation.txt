Confrontation
Hard as stone cold as ice
Desperation
I'm dying again and again
Separation
I'm leaving this place now
Intoxication
Can't think straight at all

The point of no return
I'll burn in your fire again

Destination
What's the fucking point
Explanation
Don't make me do this again
Damn this nation
I'm leaving this place now
Resignation
Thanks for nothing
Thanks to you

The point of no return
I'll burn in your fire again
