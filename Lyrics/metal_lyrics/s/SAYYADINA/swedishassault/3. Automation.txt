Global structure of power
The total destruction is near
Despair about the fact
That mankind has failed

Soulless automations
Loosing human grace
Soulless imitations
We're dying in this cage

Gazing up to the face
It won't take us forty years
And what happens here
Is always and forever

Soulless automations
Loosing human grace
Soulless imitations
We're dying in this cage
