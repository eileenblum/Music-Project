Pure hate flows in the veins of the free
Time and time again the sheep gives it away
The suffering of a world
Population means nothing at all

Those who want to live in line
Choose the narcotic
Of ultimate enslavement
Those who want to live in line
Conformity

Pure hate flows in the veins of the free
Time and time again the sheep gives it away
The suffering of a world
Population means nothing

Nothing at all
