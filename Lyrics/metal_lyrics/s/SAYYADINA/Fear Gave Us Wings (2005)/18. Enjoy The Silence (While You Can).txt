I am the hollow, I speak in silence
I hear you all, but I feel nothing

Sleepless nights
Wake up in fear
All lights are gone now
In my castle, my grave

I am the hollow, I speak in silence
I hear you all, but I feel nothing

Sleepless nights
Wake up in fear
All lights are gone now

Sleepless nights
Wake up in fear
All lights are gone now
In my castle, my grave
