The blood on your face is not evidence enough
Not a proof that you're not safe
Scars and bruises, praxis in your life
You'll be hunted every single day

17 years you could bear
But one minute of abuse is too much
Responsibility thrown around like hot iron
Just because they would not relate

No one will save you
No one will care
There's no shelter
No place to turn

You slipped so easily through the system
Only because we didn't stop and listen
Your case is as old as the human race
It sickens me to see that fear in your face

No one will save you
No one will care
There's no shelter
No place to turn

The blood on your face is not evidence enough
Not a proof that you are not safe
Scars and bruises, it's praxis in your life
You'll be hunted every single day
