Can not breathe, water up to here
The good in life is just an illusion
I stay down here in safety
Broken glass will only cut deeper

Can and will not
Live up to it
Can and will not

Looking down, looking up
The meaningless of living
Overwhelms me
I will explode with no sound
And disappear just like dust

Can and will not
Live up to it
Can and will not

Shifting to higher levels
Only to see
There's nothing more to this
This means the end

Can and will not
Live up to it
Can and will not
Live up to it
