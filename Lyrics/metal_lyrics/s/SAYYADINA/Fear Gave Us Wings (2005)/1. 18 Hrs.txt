All trees are gone
No trace, a face
A fading reminder
Immortality ain't all

It's been 18 hours and 16 days
Since you stripped it all away
Can't sleep at night, can't sleep all day
A black hole, not painted, it's real

All trees are gone
No trace, a face
A fading reminder
Immortality ain't all

Is this really what we're getting?
Gravity, take us back, bring us back to real
We're split in two or even thosands
Seems like it doesn't make a difference anymore

Remind us, or don't
We'll be anything you say
Remind us, or don't
We'll be anything you say

It's been 18 hours and 16 days
Since you stripped it all away
Can't sleep at night, can't sleep all day
A black hole, not painted, it's real
