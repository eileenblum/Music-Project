Keeping away, holding distance
Spending time all alone
Watch myself fall apart
Rot inside, drown in sweat
Need someone to bring me up
Or I will end up dead

I'll hurt myself, I'll reject you
I'll break and eat this glass
The pain will prove that I'm alive
The blood will make me see

No reason, I got nothing
To accomplish or to gain
Never asked to take part
In this stupid, fucked up game
Everything's meaningless
Hope I'll soon end up dead
