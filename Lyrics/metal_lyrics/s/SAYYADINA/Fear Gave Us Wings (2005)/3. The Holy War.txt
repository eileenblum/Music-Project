The holy war, who started it?
Does it even matter?
Who will suffer and who will win?
Does it ever matter?
Starvation and poverty continues on and on
The holy war fighting an unknown

I'm holding on to individual thoughts
Not a collective hateful mind
The threat is colored red, white and blue
Tanks, guns and b-52s

The holy war, who started it?
Does it even matter?
Who will suffer and who will win?
Does it ever matter?
A threat to your sick values of world domination
A one way ticket to hell

I'm holding on to individual thoughts
Not a collective hateful mind
The threat is colored red, white and blue
Tanks, guns and b-52s
