Slowly now we start to move
With every breath I'm deeper
Empty spots in darkness
Nothing to fall back on

Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted it to be like this
Brand new, old, grey
Controlling it to perfection

Eye to eye, no words at all
Inside out, skin off my face

Slowly now we start to move
With every breath I'm deeper
Seeing empty spots in darkness
And nothing to fall back on
