My sacred dedication
Graduated with discharge
Lost and still losing more
Seems like it's all against me

Spilling gas around the house
Just trying to find a lighter
Or a match
A second thought
Search for a glimpse of regret
But I fail again and again

Short time, no time
The truth shows at all times
We won't see, never see
Never keep us from failing

Spilling gas around the house
Just trying to find a lighter
Or a match
A second thought
Search for a glimpse of regret
But I fail again and again

Taking time out
From this miserable life
Taking a break from a life
Not worth living
Losing on every front
Losing time, losing mind

Taking time out
From this miserable life
Taking a break
From a life not worth living
