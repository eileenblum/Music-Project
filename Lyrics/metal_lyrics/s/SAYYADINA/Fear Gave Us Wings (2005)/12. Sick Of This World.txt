Rotting away in endless streets
The corpses of our brothers decay
The fight, the war, was meaningless
The smallest lie swept under the carpet

Sick, I'm so sick of this world
Hopeless, the struggle is hopeless

Lies and hate rise above us
Talk of progression leads to regression
Money spent on bombs and arms
This is the welfare state we dreamed of

Sick, I'm so sick of this world
Hopeless, the struggle is hopeless
