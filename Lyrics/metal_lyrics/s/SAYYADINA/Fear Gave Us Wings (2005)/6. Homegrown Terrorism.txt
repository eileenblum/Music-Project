The world will never listen
The world will never change
The world will never see
The world is going down

Nailbombs, nailbombs, nailbombs
I'll put them in the smartest places
Taking out so many but still too few
The reflection of the fire in my eyes

Triggers, bullets, grenades and arms
I'll shoot from the smartest places
Taking out so many but still too few
The reflection of the fear in my eyes

The world will never listen
The world will never change
The world will never see
The world is going down
