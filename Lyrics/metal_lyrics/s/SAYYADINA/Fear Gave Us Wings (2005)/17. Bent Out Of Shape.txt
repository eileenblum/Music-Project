Can reality be a fraud,
A fake beyond description?
Is it all lies and mistakes?
Did we come out clear
Or are there pieces missing?
Is the razor not as sharp anymore?

The perfect shape is bent
It's all just cold and bitter

Demand answers, face the ghost
Go beyond, look further, look ahead
But there is nothing to give us satisfaction
The answer is: it's all just a lie

The perfect shape is bent
It's all just cold and bitter
