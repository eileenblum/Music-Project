Red eyes broken down
Fear of waking up
Living means feeling
Feeling means defeat
Don't ever wanna wake up

If only I could understand
The reason for my crying
If only I could stop this fear
Of dreaming that I'm dying

Outside me I'm blooming
Inside me I'm dry
Living means feeling
Feeling means defeat
All this fear of dying

If only I could understand
The reason for my crying
If only I could stop this fear
Of dreaming that I'm dying

All this fear
