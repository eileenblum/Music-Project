You must lose faith in humanity to keep sane
Humanity is an ocean of blood and shame
A few drops are fresh, but a thosand years is way too long
Races erased, millions killed

Where there is hate and power
There is life
All dreams shattered, the door is closed
The key thrown away

Being dragged to this level
Entrapped in endless and hopeless wait
Losing faith and hope, no escape
No security and this cloud will bring us down

Where there is hate and power
There is life
All dreams shattered, the door is closed
The key thrown away
