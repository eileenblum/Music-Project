Can not breathe
Water up to here
The good in life
Is just an illusion
I stay down here
In safety
Broken glass
Will only cut deeper

Can and will not
Live up to it

Looking down
Looking up
The meaningless of living
Overwhelms me
I will explode
With no sound
And disappear
Just like dust

Can and will not
Live up to it

Shifting to higher levels
Only to see
There is nothing more to this
This means the end

Can and will not
Live up to it
