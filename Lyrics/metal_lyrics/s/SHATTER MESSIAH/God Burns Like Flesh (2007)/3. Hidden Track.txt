Darkness descends
The sweetest dreams made nightmare
All that ever was made sacred
Blasphemy's child
Preaching words of malcontent
Breeding a new way of being

Burning your gods
Like flesh at the spike
Branding your faith
And showing the scars
Bleeding dreams and weeping eyes
Tears that wasted the taste
Salt biting deep
Like a nail in your cross

Touch
Feel
Love
Hate
Worship me

Burning your gods
Like flesh at the spike
Branding your faith
And showing the scars
Bleeding dreams and weeping eyes
Tears that wasted the taste
Salt biting deep
Like a nail in your cross

Darkness descends
And reason dies in the light
Fools will swallow the blind
And bleed for messiah
Pulling the trigger so deadly
Pulling the trigger so gently
Choke on the blood of god
Eat the war for salvation

Burning your gods
Like flesh at the spike
Branding your faith
And showing the scars
Bleeding dreams and weeping eyes
Tears that wasted the taste
Salt biting deep
My soul bleeds for you
All of my faith
Wasted on you
All of your faith
Wasted on me
