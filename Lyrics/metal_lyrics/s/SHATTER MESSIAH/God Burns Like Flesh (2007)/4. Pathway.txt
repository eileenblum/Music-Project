Taking the first
Steps on the path
Timid and jumping at shadows

Failing and falling
Wanting and needing
The answers that we dream

Open my eyes
To know this world
Is more than black and white
Open your eyes
To a world that has more than pain

Rapid fire
Dieing of days
That fast becomes your life

Cherish the breath
And drink in the joy
Before it wastes all away

Open my eyes
To know this world
Is more than black and white
Open your eyes
To a world that has more than pain

When the sun sets will you weep with regret
Or find your life after death
I will stand tall and toast to my fate
And beg for nothing at all
