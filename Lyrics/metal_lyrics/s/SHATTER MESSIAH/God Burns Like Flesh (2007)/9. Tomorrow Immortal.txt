The sands of time slip through your fingers
And never will you see your leaves turning grey
Never to feel the sun set on your soul
Never aware of where you are
Caught in the ebb and the flow
Of time

Our seconds turn to minutes
Our minutes flow into the hours
And hours march forward
Heedless of my cry's for today
To tomorrow

Tomorrow immortal

The sun shines
Bright through my eyes
Warms the flesh
And moves my blood that grows cold
Tomorrow immortal
Opens her mouth
And swallows me whole
Devours my life
And devours my soul

The clock tolls the hour of reckoning
Waste not what you are given
Want not what you waste
For the judge of today is tomorrow immortal

Held in the arms of my lovers grip
Pulling me to my end
The end of all of your days
Caressing the lines
And the years into our skin
Wrap me in your velvet embrace
Entombed in this place

In void of purpose
There can be no existence
There can be no future
Without your past
Hold me tight in your hands
To keep me safe from the years
That wears me down
And turn us all into dust

The sun shines
Bright through my eyes
Warms the flesh
And moves my blood that grows cold
Tomorrow immortal
Opens her mouth
And swallows me whole
Devours my life
And devours my soul
