Today is the day
That I end
My god given life
Spit of the face
My creator I mock you
I cannot explain
This anger
That wells up with in me

Painted on smile
Your vacuous stares
I cannot stand to be
Breathing the same air
Wanting you dead
Hating the lie that you buy
Contempt raises bile
So thick in my throat
Can't stand the site of you
This vicious joke

This is the day
I bring about my own destruction
This is the day
My rage poisons your purest dreams
I can't stand you
Anymore

There's something inside of me
That I cannot live with
There's something I see in you
That I will not bare withess too
All of the truth
I've learned from your lies
All of my life I've lived in denial
Unable to fight your constant reprisals
I see my will weakened by you
I see my life a worthless lie

I pray and I cry
For some meaning to seep in my life
Your life built on words
From the lies of a dead man
My fragile existence
You cannot preserve
Your faith and your ethos
I deny

Today is the day
I bring about my own destruction
Spit in the face
My savior
Messiah and Christ

This is the day
I bring about my own destruction
This is the day
My rage poisons your purest dreams
I can't stand you
Anymore
