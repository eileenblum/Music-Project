Struggle to bring
Order from chaos
Making the structures divine
Gilded by guilt
Controlling the poor
Keeping your masses aligned
Automatic
Fanatical death
Triggers the end of our time

Prophet existence manufactured
Contain all the fear in your eyes
Searching your souls for my answer
Terrified by the void

Welcome to the end my friend
To this televised sacrifice
God burns like flesh on the spike
And this traitor laughs again

Bleeding revelations
Sweeping exodus fear
This genesis failures complete
And god burns like flesh

Welcome to the end my friend
To this televised sacrifice
God burns like flesh on the spike
And this traitor laughs again

Counting your silver while making the wounds
That you call your faith
God will burn like flesh on the spike
And we traitors laugh again
