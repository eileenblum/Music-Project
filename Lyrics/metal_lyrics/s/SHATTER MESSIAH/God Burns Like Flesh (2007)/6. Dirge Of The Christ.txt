All hail
The dirge of the Christ
His final mass of death
And my last revelation

This is the dirge of the Christ
The greatest mass of death
Breathing requiem's last breath

Told from on high
His final chapter's verse
Bleeding from the chorus
That I sing

All that is and ever was
All that is shall never be
Pull the scales from my eyes
Reveal the path that is the lie
All that ever was Made undone

Feasting on the week
Has made you soft
Their pail white skin
This victimless rape

Paid for with blood
So we can drink wine
Setting the feast
On the bitter dead

Snared in the game
Vulgar and vicious
Bighting at the hearts
Of the ones we should love
Faded former glories
Of righteous wars won
How quickly you would burn
And steal away my trust

I am the dirge of the Christ
My greatest requiem mass
Forsaking your saviors
Rotting on their cross
Betrayed by you all
And all that He was

Powers pleasure and pain
This mad empires reign
Innocence and purity
Twist to read like a sin
What can poison a mind?
Like powers sweet divide
Feeding the wrong for right
Eating the days light

I am the dirge of the Christ
My greatest requiem mass
Forsaking your saviors
Rotting on their cross
Betrayed by you all
And all that He was
