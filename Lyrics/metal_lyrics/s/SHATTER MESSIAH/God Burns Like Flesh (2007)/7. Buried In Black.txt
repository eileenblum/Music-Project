I am the pilgrim all alone
Bleeding to death on this broken road
Failing the path of god
To find my paradise is lost

Blinded by light that could save us all
Buried in the black tides rising fall

Could I be the dove?
The olive branch in my hand
Pulling the trigger so gently
To face my judgment in flames

Feeding the fear that I love
To fuel this vulgar tragedy
I feel so far from the surface
Unable to cope, unable to die
Here is the dream that haunts my night
And the visions that blur my sight
Blinded by light that could save us all
Buried in black tides rising fall

Who is the demon in my mind?
Reflecting the evil that I hide
My penance must be paid
To the end of darkness days

Feeding the fear that I love
To fuel this vulgar tragedy
I feel so far from the surface
Unable to cope, unable to die
Here is the dream that haunts my night
And the visions that blur my sight
Blinded by light that could save us all
Buried in black tides rising fall
