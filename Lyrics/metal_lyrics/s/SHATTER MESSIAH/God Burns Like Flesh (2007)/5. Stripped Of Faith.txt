Terrorized and horrified
By the prophets
Sworn to protect us
From evils abound in this world

Twisting the tails
That makes up your lives
Bending the light so perverse

I have been stripped of faith
For the very last time
Raw and bleeding
Sick and deceiving
Stronger than the lie
We rise above
Pulling freedom free
From the clutches of you

I cry for the world
Broken and calloused
Making our lives
Not worth living for
Bleeding hearts
And foolish dreams
Burning alive
By vicious swine

I have been stripped of faith
For the very last time
Raw and bleeding
Sick and deceiving
Stronger than the lie
We rise above
Pulling freedom free
From the clutches of you
