This narrow
Narcissistic view
Of how the world
Revolves for you

Pandering to
The servant's who slave
To feed your swollen shell

Take it all in
Drinking your shame
The same bitter pill

Filling your cage
With anger and words
Still spiteful but bleeding gold

Stand beside
And hiding behind
I watch your jester rule

Laughing at love
And I am ashamed your actions
Weep deceit

Pretentious pretenders
False heir's to the throne
You could never earn
Shallow graves
And hollow passions
From years of bitter abuse
Idolater, Idolater
I pull back your white face mask
Clearing the smoke
And breaking the mirrors
Reveal your master is slave

Selfish defeat
Your visions are twisted
By scheming and impure thought

Terrified
By all of your failure
Laid bare again and again

Flay the flesh
From other bones
To fill your empty defeat

Placing the scars
On other skin
Showing the world your wounds

Pretentious pretenders
False heir's to the throne
You could never earn
Shallow graves
And hollow passions
From years of bitter abuse
Idolater, Idolater
I pull back your white face mask
Clearing the smoke
And breaking the mirrors
Reveal your master is slave

Hiding in corners
Afraid of the light
That shows your vulgar lie
Nothing can love you
And nothing can heal you
Poisoned by your ego
