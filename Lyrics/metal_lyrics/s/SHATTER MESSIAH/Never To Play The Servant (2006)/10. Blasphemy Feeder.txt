Sacred sins burning on your soul
Follow the lies of divinity
Bleeding red in your flesh the story unfolds
What tale will you tell

Purity dies like the shadows in the light
Dismember your gods and feast on their flesh
Holding the heart of your faith in my hands
See it bleed black like the night

Poison seeps in the words that they preach
What blasphemy would you believe
Take your eye for my eye
Slitting my throat to heal the wound

What would the words of blasphemy be
Upon your lips to slip your tongue
Poison or prophecy it's all a deception
It's all a design for control

Choke on my words like a serpents tongue
They whisper deception then sing upon high
Pray to their God that I would call sin
Sweet poison it bleeds in your veins

What would the words of blasphemy be
Upon your lips to slip your tongue
Feel the poison flow as you bite
The serpents tongue
As I cross your lips to numb your soul
Wash away the sins that stain your flesh
My desire, my love, my sin, my blasphemy
Are you poison are you prophecy
