Why is the passion of man to destroy
All that he sees all that will breath
Burn out the world and choke on the ash
Put out the eyes of the ones who will see

Blood on the page the cross I will bare
Wounds of stigmata held high in the air
This crown of sin that you pound in my skull
The martyr the man my blood on your hands

I am the martyr
I am the man
You are the cross
And faith is the nail

All hail the new faith
All hail the new god
All hail the dead Christ
And crucify freedom

Man has made God to mold in his image
Blocking the light
And controlling the vision
So open your mind and feast on the truth
To read the betrayal of Christ

So much contempt burns in my eyes
As I see you eat
And swallow the lies
Temptation is life
And the sin is light
Through the cracks
In the sky they design
Scriptures and words written by man
In the guise of God and Christ
Control the ultimate goal
To hide the freedom of life
Run and crush the world
And crucify freedom

Revelation will always spill
The blood of the weak
Tear apart the seems of the world
And rip at the fabric of faith
Praise the diseased
As they bleed upon the cross
Praise the diseased
As it scream "I'm forsaken"
