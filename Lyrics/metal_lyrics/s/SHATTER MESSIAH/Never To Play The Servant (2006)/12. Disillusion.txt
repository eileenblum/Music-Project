Disillusioned with my life
And all the things I bring to it
Surround myself with love
Just to see it turn to shit
Back and forth again and again
I feel the pain inside
One more chance to give
One more life to live

I've taken everything
And I've given it all to you
Fix my disillusion and repair
My fucking collapse

Please put me back together
And hold my seems tight

You are the only thing
Keeping me alive
Without your softest kiss
I pull the trigger hard

Feel the madness rising
Splitting me in two
Rip myself apart just to see
The black inside
Chaos building chaos screaming
Feel myself slipping
On the blood soaked grip
