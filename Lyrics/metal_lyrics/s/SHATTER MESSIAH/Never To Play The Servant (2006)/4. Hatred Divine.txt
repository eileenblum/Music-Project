I struggle with my life within
And all the memory that it brings
A flash of anger a flash of guilt
Brings me back to the place from I ran

All the bad you make, all the good I build
Take my joy and you call it a waste
You drag it out
And you throw it back in my face

Reason leaves me when I see you
My rage is absolute
Cloud my vision cloud my mind
My hatred is divine

Drowning in my misery
Self inflicted state of despair
The madness build behind my eyes
Starts the end that I feel inside

Outside
Is not your pain
Inside
I'm not your pain

There for by the grace of God I go
Full of hate and rage inside
As I rip my way through life
So tired of the being next in line
Filled to the teeth with this vision of rage
I lift myself to a better place
I lift myself to my hatred divine
