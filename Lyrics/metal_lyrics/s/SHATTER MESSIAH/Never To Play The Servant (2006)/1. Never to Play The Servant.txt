This convoluted sense of God
Denies me of my freedom
My mind, body and soul
The things you need for control

I am caught in the spin
Falling through my place in time
Blind to the meaning of existence
Needing to prove my worth to you

Never to play the servant
Never to be your slave
Bowing and scraping for my salvation

I will kiss the hand of the demon that beats me
Bow to the tongue of my brutal master
Saved by my spite
And Jesus weeps for the sound of my voice

Never to play the servant
Never to be your slave
Bowing and scraping for my salvation
Never to play the servant
Never to be your slave
Wishing for something better then I see in you

I am not your weakness, I am not your fault
I am the voice inside your head,
Calling doubt to your faith

I walk away from my pain
And I walk away from your shame
I turn my eyes to God
Just to find that he is you

Never to play the servant
Never to be your slave
Bowing and scraping for my salvation
I walk away from my pain
And I walk away from your shame
I turn my eyes to God
Just to find that he is you
