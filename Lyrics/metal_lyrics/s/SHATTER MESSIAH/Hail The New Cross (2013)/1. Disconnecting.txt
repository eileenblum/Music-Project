Viral connection
Human inflection
We are the chaos
That burns down the world

Poison my purity
Blackmail infinity
Disseminate mankind's legacy

Forcing me
Trembling
Worship me
Disconnecting

Here is the melody
To sing as Rome burns
All of the notes
Discordant disarray
