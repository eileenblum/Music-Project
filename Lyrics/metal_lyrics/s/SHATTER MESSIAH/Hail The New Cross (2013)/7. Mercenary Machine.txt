With one pull of the trigger
The bodies all fall down
Bullets fly with pain
Round after round

Scrambling out to kill everything in my sights

Innocent or guilty matters not to me

Death for hire
Mercenary machine
We'll bring you strife and misery

I pray for war to wake me
Demons in the daylight
Will kill today

Death for hire
Mercenary machine
Swift connection
Killing machine
