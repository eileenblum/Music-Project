Empty inside
With nowhere to hide
I could never tell you what part of me died
Despair never touches
The stone in my life
Black and white
The colors fade
Like the sun in my sky
My sky

The lock without a key
Vistim of my every sin
Left to dying eyes
Staring stright through me

Life without your love is life that fades to black
Empty days of time left waiting for my death
Begging for my end to this life without you
Finding my way back in your heart again

Betrayer of your love
Losing your trust
See the pain I put into your eyes
Will you forgive my betrayal this time
