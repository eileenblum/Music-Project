You will never know
The addiction to my passion
You will never know who I am
Moment to moment
Touching intensity
I will never stand in judgement

Nothing can prepare you
When the demon comes to rise
Consequence of choices made
With no one left to blame

You will never know the addiction to my passion
You will never know who I am
Moment to moment touching intensity
I will never stand in judgement to you

Finding love in a sacrifice
Reaching deep to find the divine
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down my soul
