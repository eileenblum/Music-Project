Though I feel no pain
Hurts in many ways
Same old story again
As I turn the page
All I have to say
While you walk away
A tragic destiny

I have fallen prey
I'm losing my faith

When everything has been betrayed
And nothing is ever the same
Burning out memories flame
Dying in your arms again

What did you do
When I needed you
Spit your venom in my face
Blind my eyes with your rage
