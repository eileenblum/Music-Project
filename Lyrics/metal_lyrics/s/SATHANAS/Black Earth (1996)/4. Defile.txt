Helm of darkness
Corrupting gods' souls
Evil has blessed
Satanic scrolls

Into the light
Gateway to hell
Lucifer cast black magic spells

Guardian arise
Your eyes of burning red
Ring the unholy bells
To awaken the undead!

Striking of the serpent
Poisoned minds combined
Troops that satan has sent
Mortals Terrorized!

Shadows from beyond
Summoned to destroy!
Archangel flies into the void
Locusts carry plagues
Scriptures that foretold
Unite the gods of death
Embrace the devil's soul!

Black prophecies of time
Spread across the land
Defle the religions
Beelzebub commands!
