Book of the black earth
Evil handed fourth
Forbidden seals aflame
Descend to forgotten lands

Hordes watch beyond
And wait for the gate to crack
Attack with satan's law
Perish the blood of man

The book was bound in flesh
Then was the sent from hell
Raging souls collide
Burning angels fell!

Dead shall live again
Rise from the depths of hell
Immortals breed hate
Christians meet their fate
