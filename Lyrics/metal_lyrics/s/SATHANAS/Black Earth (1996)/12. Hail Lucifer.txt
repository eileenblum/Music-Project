Sacrifice
Deadly night...
Candles melt
Burnign bright...
Crucify
time to die!

Beware the mark of the beast!
Don't break the seventh seal
On your blood we will feast!
Hell shall now appeal

Burning in hell's fire
Behold evil desire!
Black mass rules tonight
Virgin screams out in fright!

Hail prince of night!
Jesus has decieved you!
Unholy battle you must fight!
Lucifer will retrieve you!

Demonic faith grows stronger
Christianity lasts no longer!
Pray that god's desceased
Bring death to me!
