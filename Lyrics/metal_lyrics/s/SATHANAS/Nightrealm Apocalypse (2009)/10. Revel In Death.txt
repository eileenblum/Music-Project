The order of darkness
And the evil within us
Sent to the dark master
The soul now escapes the flesh

The order of lucifer
And the ancient forces
Call forth the empire
And cross the end of life

Summoning of the dark
Cast of moonlight to raise the dead
Baptized through the moons rays
Through darkness it shall be

Revel in death
Revel in death
