Raise the forces of evil
The reaper ascends through the night
Demonic fires burning
The blackest of hate will rise

Tyrants
Hail allegiance to the dark
Our will
To deliver the word of satan

Praise the forces of evil
The demons attack through the night
Smell the churches burning
A new age of satan will rise

Tyrants...

Black witching millenium

Warriors of darkness
Bring us the keys of death
The holy march
To cast out the devil one
Conjuring of satan
With all his impiety
Upon the wings of death
To set us free
