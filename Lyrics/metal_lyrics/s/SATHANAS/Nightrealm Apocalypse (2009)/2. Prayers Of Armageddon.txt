By the power of death
And the visions of beyond
Sentenced to die
As the immortal...
Raise the Sign!!!

By the smell of blood
I am one with the dark
And spoke the prayers of death
And sealed the tribulation!!!

In the name of his majesty - awakening

Powers of satan
Has reached the dawn demise
Fires have lighted
The prayers of armageddon!!!
