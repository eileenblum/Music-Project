Through the ancient lands
A battle of hatred approaches
To wield the blackened plague
And spawn the fires of death
Fires of death

I see the armies rise
Upon the shores of styx
From the lands beyond
Where demons thrive among the dead

Call forth the angels
That fell into the fire
Returned with black wings
Prophecies of evils to come

Call forth the demons
Of fire and blood
A sea of plagues rise
Prophecies of evils to come
