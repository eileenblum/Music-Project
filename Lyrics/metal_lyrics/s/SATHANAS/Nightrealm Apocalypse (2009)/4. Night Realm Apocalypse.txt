Visions of the nightrealm
With demons shrouded in black
The priest stands by the altar
The mass awaits new blood

Feeding on the moonlight
Send the forces of the dark
I have seen the reaper's eyes
Bring forth death!!

Visions of the kingdom
I see warriors of death
Demons grant my vengeance
As the priest stands in blood

Set the thosen on the altar
Cast away the holy light
The temple glows with sin
Beyond the realm of night

I've signed the rites of death
Under the seal of darkness
Nightrealm!!!
Apocalypse!!!
