Rise up satanas
Your legions are at hand
Thy world has fallen
Into the kingdom of the damned

Evil has risen
Satan has come to me
Defiling the christians
Rise up eternal empire

Kingdom of the damned

Behold satanas
Bring war and infamy
The weak now suffer
Throw them into the fire

Kingdom of the damned
