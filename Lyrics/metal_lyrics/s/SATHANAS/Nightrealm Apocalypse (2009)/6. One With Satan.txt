Disciples of the night
Have made a pact with satan
The prophecies shall follow
The holy is now forsaken

Sent from the voice of the dark
Command your legions and arise
I have the blessings of the dark
Now we have become one with satan

Legions call upon darkened master satan
The wicked all shall rise, the bestial creation

Sent from the voice of the dark
Command your legions and arise
I have the blessings of the dark
Now we have become one with satan
