Falling from the land of god
Reborn through damnation
His black wings will spread
Ever falling darkness!!!

Destending from the land of god
Dark revelations
Demons look upon
Ever falling darkness!!!

In the sign of evil
We shall make our part

Angels of the dark
Through the gates they emerge
With satan's rites
The dammed become the demons

In the sign o evil
We shall make our part

Angels of the dark...
