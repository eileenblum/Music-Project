Black arts from the dark
The cult draws the magic circle
In the name of virgin blood
Will entice the essence of evil

Tryptic spells to enchant
Lead us to the devil's path
I become immortal
Among the angels of darkness

Cult of blood - allegiance with satan
Cult of blood - in league with satan

Evil purifies my soul
My sings baptized in fire
I ask the fallen ones
To grant my worldly... Desires
