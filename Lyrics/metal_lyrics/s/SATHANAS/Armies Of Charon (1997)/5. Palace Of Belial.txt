Bodies die - bodies bleed
Cast to Hell - demons seed
For my sins - you will see
Cause your blood - drips from me
Endless fight - of the dead
Corpses fly - through the air
Plunging down - eyes of red
Now your faith - has gone to Hell
Sardonic wrath takes control
Defiled cries - start to rise
Underworld of death decay
As my soul slips away
Palace of Belial 
Demonic flesh binds my soul 
Eternal death I shall know
Legions fall upon the grave
Wrath unfolds - no one saved
Can you see the mortals
Praying for salvation
Bastard sons of mayhem
Serpent of the darkness
Palace of Belial
