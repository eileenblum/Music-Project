Into the shroud of darkness
Where the wolves roam as one  
Stand before the sigil sign
And seal the pact in blood!
Before the throne
Feel the power
Prince of darkness
Chosen disciples 
Children of the night
Into the shroud of darkness
Realm of the unholy one
Revel in delight
And join the orgy in blood
Before the throne
