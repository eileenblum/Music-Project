Sathanas' child 
Unleashed upon the earth 
Dark coven sings
And witness the unholy birth
Second coming
Bring forth the deicide
Revile against the cross
The diabolic race
Laughs at the holy loss
Skies of blood
Christ slips from the altar
As I grasp his soul
Take his will to live
I am in control
Now I rule this power
I, the chosen one
When the war is through
There shall remain none
Approach the seven gates 
Christ has lost his way
Evil force is one
For I am Satan' son
Armageddon
Now the earth is hell
Divine one standing tall 
Ring the infernal bell
Avenge for Satan's fall
