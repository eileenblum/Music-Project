Deceived the holy trinity
Rebelled against the laws of god
Bringer of deluded minds
Weakening the faith 
Conflight with the beast 
The demon in cast
To the depths of hell
With satan's wrath
Feel the desire - thrown into the fire
Releasing all antagonism
Reaching for the chalice of souls
Winds bring the beast
To incite all morals
Across the dawn of death
Comes the pry of infamy
Fallen angel - desolate one
Blasphemy - blackened soul
Decaying humans - seas of blood
Tribulation into darkness
