Chants of bewitchment
Under the moonlight
Her dark eyes gaze into the fire
She foresees the land of the dead
Under a blackened spell
Gather of witches for the ritual
Conjure of spirits
From beyond
Throw a curse from the ancient text
A chosen fate for I await
Dark forces surround me
They take me away!!
Throw a curse from the ancient text
A chosen fate for I await
She sends my soul there
I am cast!!
