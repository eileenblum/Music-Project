By the windâs of tribulation, delivering the signâs of evil
They possess the mark of the beast, these disciples that have fallen from Grace
Descent of the holy
I will see thy master upon the thrones of death
Perish into nocturnal flames
Angels of the fire
Descent of the holy
Falling into the abyss
Awake the angels of death
Judgement has been passed
Divine suffering
