Underworld sentencing the damned, for their past sinâs and blasphemies
Visions of a burning netherworld
Souls are falling to their final stage of death
In the circle - Gods of the dead take my side
In the circle - Before the throne I shall stand
In the circle - I am the one with wingâs of fire
In the circle of HELL!!
Prophecies of the burning skies, set ablaze hordes of the dark
Visions of a burning netherworld
Souls are falling to their final stage of death
