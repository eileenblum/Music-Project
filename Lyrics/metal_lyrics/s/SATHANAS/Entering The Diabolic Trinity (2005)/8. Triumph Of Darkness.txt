Rise up from the dark, bring forth the ones
To indulge in sin and curse the light
Triumph of darkness
Black immortals of hate, drinking the blood
Tasting the flesh of your saints
Triumph of darkness
I rule the world and I rule the dark
Invoking lust upon the whore
A world of death and a world of pain
I am the one they call evil
