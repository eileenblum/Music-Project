From the darkness
We are the children of the night, under moonlight
Desecrate all of your holy thoughts, for our legions are many
Smell of blood fills the air, wolves stalk before the dawn
Red eyes black shadows, they are here the dogs of war
They lurk in the darkness, the wolves among us!
I will not betray the fallen, I will not betray evil
Desecrate all your holy thoughts
For our legions are here!
They lurk in the darkness
The wolves among us
No mercy for the weak
Unleash the Wolves!!!
