Battles storm upon the land
The kingdom now flows with Blood
Warriorâs fight until their end
Engage into the onslaught
Mercenaryâs ride upon
A crusade of blood and hate
War has now been unleashed
Arrive the legionâs of death
We will destroy the pure
Under the oath of hell
We are a force of the dark spawn of abomination
Into the massacre
Our legions ride
Into the Massacre
On demonâs wind
Into the massacre
A world turning black
Into the massacre
Battles storm upon the land
The kingdom now stained with blood
Warriors fight until their end
Their remains turned to dust
