Appearing are the Black, Hordes of Damnation
Fallen Angelâs Become DIABOLIC
Descending from the Light, of Heavens Creation
Renouncing God to Become, DIABOLIC
Through pathâs that Iâve chose
I will follow the heraldâs of sin
In this wake Unchaste
I have entered this Wicked Land!
Into the dark
Reborn through hate
Defile the weak
Nightfall supreme
