I've wandered through the dark
For the blessed ways are behind me now
Faith turns to shadows in black
My eyes are open to death

Seeing the worlds death and torment
With no signs of god
Awaiting the messiah and his world
Darkness only gives me rapture

Torn from the book of god
Engraved in the book of death

Now set asidethis pact in blood and my soul
For this holy lie is not for me no longer
