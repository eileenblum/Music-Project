None shall befall this night
They walk along side of deaths grace
With the moon so bright

The beasts they found me now
My mortal life will cease
And pass through the gates twilight
Avail my dwelling

My wings they take me through
The night and unseen to this world
I shall become among the dead

My heartbeat has declined
My blood shall flow no more
Let darkness take me
I am of the beast

Nocturnal reign
