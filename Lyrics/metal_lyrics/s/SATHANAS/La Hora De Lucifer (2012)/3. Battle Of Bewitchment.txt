Feel the wrath 
As hell's gate opens
And wickedness unfolds
Hail death hail sathanas

Darkened symphony
Black with infamy
Crowd chants hail satan
Evoke the pentagram
Light the candles
And embrace the powers of darkness

Raise the chalice for the hour has come
To join the ritual

Battle of bewitchment

Force of evil 
And metal unite
Smell of leather
Praise the hordes
In blasphemy
And bang your head for satan
