My soul has been possessed
By evil and desire
Through the eyes of chaos
Foresee the dark messiah

My heart is filled with hate
And vengeance flows like blood
Through the pantheons of time
I've reached the stygian shores

War has brought endless disarray
Darkness shall be the final reign
I have seen signs of blood to come
My soul is damned
Forged in eternal fire
