From paths that lead to damnation
My soul is cleansed by hatred
Bring unto me the blood of thy enemy
For the blackness fills deaths void

This evil surge runs through my veins
For the taste of death I can't deny
Sent like spawning malediction
As the blackest of hate unwinds

My eyes are upon you
Your prayers have been denied
Heaven looks away
My abominations rise

Blackest hate
