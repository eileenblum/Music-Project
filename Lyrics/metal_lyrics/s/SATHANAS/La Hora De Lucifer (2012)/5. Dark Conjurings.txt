Voices say
Carve the dark rites
Into your flesh
We will take you to the death side of life

Ancient is the time
When sorcery rules the dark
Return to the age of witchcraft
And await the apparitions

These phantoms
And wraiths are tempting me
From the world beyond
Shall I follow thy path

Senses overwhelming
With black magic aura
Aware that I have fallen
Under their hex

The altar greets blood
Of the chosen
The gathering this night seals
Dark conjurings
