I cast a rain of fire
Unto your sacred
For those forsaken me beyond
I have awakened

World dies
Once the demons rise
Under the veil of darkness
La hora de lucifer

Graced with darkened wings
Shall carry me a throne
With staff in hand towards glory
To my destiny

Unleashed upon your world
Through your nightmares and dreams
You see my face
Through lust and sin eternal

Unleashed upon your world
Through your nightmares and dreams
You see my face
I shall endure, I shall prevail

World dies
Once the demons rise
Under the veil of darkness
La hora de lucifer
