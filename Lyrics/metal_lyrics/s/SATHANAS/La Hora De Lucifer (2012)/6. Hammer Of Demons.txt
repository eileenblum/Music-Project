This worlds wickedness
Has cast the demons into me
They guide the dagger onward

They know I'm weary
Of this life and want me to
Do their bidding
So shall be

Rites of darkness
Hammer of demons
None shall come before me
Hammer of demons

Unleash this fury
I hear the voices say to me
Take your life and join us
We await
