Hymns from the shadow land

Hear the horns of the Dark Age
Calling immortals from the gates
Eyes that follow me
Through the lands of blasphemy

Bringers of death
Enchant the spirits
Armageddon

Hymns from the shadow land

Demons sent from the darkness
Summoned to decimate
Kingdom of the infernal night
Raise the opus of Satan's rites

Bringers of death
Enchant the spirits
Armageddon

Hymns from the shadow land

Hear the horns of the Dark Age
Calling immortals from the gates
Eyes that follow me
Through the lands of blasphemy

Bringers of death
Enchant the spirits
Armageddon

Hymns from the shadow land
