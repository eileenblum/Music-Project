The armies of the dead
Fallen angels of hell will arrive
The beasts of the dark
The prophecies will come

One with the dark

The four horsemen ride
From the gates of hell to release
The demons of war
And the angels of death

Beneath the blood red moon

I have become
One with the night and evil
In praise of the dark
Unleash hell upon the world
