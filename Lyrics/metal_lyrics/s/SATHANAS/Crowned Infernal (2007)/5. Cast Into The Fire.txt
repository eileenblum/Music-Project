Thrown from the embrace of heaven's light
I will set the world on fire

Cast into the darkened void
Satan will reclaim the dark throne

The world under Satan
As the demons rise
From hell

We will rise from the depths
Sons of the fallen

I shall follow
For the saints have fallen to the dark side

Before I am dead, I will sign the book of death
