Burning torches through the wooded dark

Glorify the devil's reign
Onward to the sacrifice
The coven turns the cross... towards hell

Brought upon the altar
The blood is divine
Bring forth the Demons
Satan is starting to rise

I vow to appease thy master
Before the throws of death
Raise the chalice - Drink the blood
Before the witches sabbat

Burning torches through the wooded dark

The coven turns the cross... towards hell

I vow to appease thy master
