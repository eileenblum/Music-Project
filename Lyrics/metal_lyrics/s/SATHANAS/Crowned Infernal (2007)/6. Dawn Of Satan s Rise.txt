I am the morning star
I am the angel that fell
Speak my ways of Sodom
I am revealed as Satan

The seas have turned to blood
The signs of apocalypse
Demons carry me upon
The throne of the damned

The messengers of death
Appear before the dawn

Dawn of Satan's rise

The prophecy unfolds
We are the angels that fell
Destroy all gods creation
Holy tribulation

The messengers of death
Appear before the dawn

Dawn of Satan's rise

I am the morning star
I am the angel that fell
Speak my ways of Sodom
I am revealed as Satan

The messengers of death
Appear before the dawn
