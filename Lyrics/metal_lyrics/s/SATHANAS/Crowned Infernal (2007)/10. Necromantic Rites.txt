Enchant the night realm - with magic
Conjuration
See the wings - of the demons
Across the sky

I feel the force of darkness
Within my soul
From the burning cauldron
Necromantic rites

Blessing this night with evil
Through Satan
The oath of blood and sin
Has been passed

I feel the force of darkness
Within my soul
From the burning cauldron
Necromantic rites

Enchant the night realm - with magic
Conjuration
See the wings - of the demons
Across the sky

I feel the force of darkness
Within my soul
From the burning cauldron
Necromantic rites
