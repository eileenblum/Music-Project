Centuries spoke of the end
Battles emerge from the abyss

Beasts of war from the Styx
Forsake the Disciples of Christ

I will call the storms
As I fall from grace

Seas of blood and wrath
Have defiled god's grace

Bring the prophecy
Bring the beasts to me

I will call the storms
As I fall from grace

The beast of revelation

Black legions of hate
Are guarding Satan's gate

The abode of heaven
Shall be asunder

I will call the storms
As I fall from grace

The beast of revelation

Centuries spoke of the end
Battles emerge from the abyss

Beasts of war from the Styx
Forsake the Disciples of Christ

I will call the storms
As I fall from grace

The beast of revelation
