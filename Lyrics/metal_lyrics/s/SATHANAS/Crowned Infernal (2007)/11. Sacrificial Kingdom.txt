Seal their fate
And wear the mark of evil
666 upon their bodies
Fallen kingdom - shall rise again
New blood to appease the dark lord

Rise - Before the gates
The prophets of evil have taken my soul
Fire - To purify
Powers of Satan
And the fires of night

Seal their fate
And wear the mark of Satan
666 upon their bodies
Fallen kingdom - Sodom
Our blood shall - feed the demons

Rise - Before the gates
The prophets of evil have taken my soul
Fire - To purify
Powers of Satan
And the fires of night

Sacrificial Kingdom

Patron's of evil
Legions of darkness arise
Lead us into the fires of hell
And descend to the Promised Land

Sacrificial Kingdom
