I call upon the ancient ones
And the legions of the damned

I see the angels cry
As the darkness falls

Tyrants from beyond
Hear my call

We are the rulers of the dark
Damned with hate
We are the black angels of Satan's race

Before the darkness
The demons rise
I summon
The ancient hordes

I call upon the ancient ones
And the legions of the damned

I see the angels cry
As the darkness falls

Before the darkness
The demons rise
I summon
The ancient hordes
