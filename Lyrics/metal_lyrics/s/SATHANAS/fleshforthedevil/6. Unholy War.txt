Entering the suffering- Fallen angels rise
From the forces of Satanâs blood-We shall take command
Demons gather before the throne-At will to kill for Satan
From the Hordes of Hell-The Bells of Death will ring

Burn the Heavens in praise of the dark
Destroying the Alliance of God

Unholy one-Unholy son-Defile the ways of Christ
Battle upon the helm-to bring the sacrifice
Soldiers of Darkness-Apparitions in the mist
Forces gather in the name of Satan

Unholy War

Rise up in the name of the evil god
Into the darkness We shall endure
