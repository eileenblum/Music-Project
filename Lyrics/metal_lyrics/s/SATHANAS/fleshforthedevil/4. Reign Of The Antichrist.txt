Up from the Dark Kingdom
Up from the depths of Hell
Under Satanâs command
Fallen angels dwell

From the seven gates
Unleash the Souls of Hate

Up from the Darkness we rise
Up from the crypts of Death
We are Satanâs own
Dark one shall defy

From the fall of grace-I shall rise again
Avenging chosen one-Known as Satanâs son
Demons feed upon-Blood of the mortal man
Raise the devils sign-Reign of the Antichrist
