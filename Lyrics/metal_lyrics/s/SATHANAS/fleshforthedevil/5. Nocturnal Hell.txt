[originally by Slaughter]Into the dream world slowly I creep
Into the land that I go when I sleep
This time Iâm trapped &amp; cannot return
There are certain things a mortal can learn

Wildest fantasy first It feels good
Slowly things happen Not the way they should

Canât control &amp; ripped wide apart
Enter my nightmare, itâs only just a start

Jump out of bed fully awake
Feeling a tremor as the bed shakes
Realize it now muffle your scream
Awake in Hell we all know as

âThe Dreamâ........
