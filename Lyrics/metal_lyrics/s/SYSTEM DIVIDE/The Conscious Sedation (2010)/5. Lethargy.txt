Born of privilege, the prodigal son
Failed to succeed in life
Now the unworthy one
How can you not see clearly?
How can you not see the consequence?

How do you look yourself in a mirror?
Indifference - you're the sum of meaningless moments

A waste of life, culmination of your deeds
Just a demagogue
With all the people you feed on

Everyday, you will survive alone
Fading slower each passing day
And every night, you'll watch the world
Passing by with your shattered dream

You're self absorbed, a failure to perform
How can you not see clearly?
Blinded

A waste of breath, your refusal to persist
Just a demagogue
With all the people you feed on

Everyday, you will survive alone
Fading slower each passing day
And every night, you'll watch the world
Passing by with your shattered dream
When daylight breaks, you'll find yourself
Broken and empty with nothing left for you

Lethargy - insecurity - lethargy - fail to progress

Everyday, you will survive alone
Fading slower each passing day
And every night, you'll watch the world
Passing by with your shattered dream

When daylight breaks, you'll find yourself
Broken and empty with nothing left for you
