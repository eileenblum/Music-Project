Is this desperation, or a revelation?

Erratic actions, the means to an end
An abrupt chance to redefine
What we all expect
The more questions, the clearer the doubt
Though everything else seems clearer
Can you see the difference?
The attainable - the unreachable
Blurring the line, all decency denied

Hear the tongues of blackened silver
As your golden bonds start to break

I won't let you be divided
I won't let you be torn to shreds

A furtive twist nails the shackles to the ground
Confined to a corner we find ourselves crashing down
The more questions unanswered, the more we drown

Hear the tongues of blackened silver
As your golden bonds start to break

I won't let you be divided
I won't let you be torn to shreds
I won't let you fall apart on me
I won't let you be torn to shreds

See ahead in the distance
Just a bit of diffusion
On the rear view mirror
As you stare to the back of your mind
Which is the illusion?

Hear the tongues of blackened silver
As your golden bonds start to break

I won't let you be divided
I won't let you be torn to shreds
I won't let you fall apart on me
I won't let you be torn to shreds

What will become of all of this?
