This everlasting energy that drives us further to the end
It proves fatal, vital to be
Incomplete is to live and perfection is death
We are all marvhing martyrs in this hole called earth

We all crawl our way through life to live
Bred to consume and to breedm to bleed

Striving for a life of perfection
Unable to see what we really are
Convince ourselves that there is a point to breathe

A vision of salvation that keeps us striving for the cause
Is it pointless?
Devoid of hope
Incomplete is to die and perfection is life
Telling lies despite yourself is fodder for the weak

Striving for a life of perfection
Unable to see what we really are
Convince ourselves that there is a point to breathe

What is man but a self proclaimed evolved animal
Following pointless rules and fooling itself its own
Existence is of any relevance to this world, at all

Idiocracy, reality a self fulfilling prophecy
A recurring nightmare of goals you can't achieve

Striving for a life of perfection
Unable to see what we really are

Recurring nightmare of goals you can't achieve
Unable to see what we really are
Recurring nightmare of goals you can't achieve
