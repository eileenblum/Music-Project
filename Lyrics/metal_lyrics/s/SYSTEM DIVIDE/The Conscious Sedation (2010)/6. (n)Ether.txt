Dazed of effort
Formless, emotionless and flawed

We crawl back into the dark
Of a cold comfort, yet again we are withdrawn

We stand in line
Approaching the light that will change our lives
Yet we still crave things we cannot have
Overcome by greed until the bitter end

Was it too bright today?
Broke a window of opportunity?

Dazed of effort
Formless, emotionless and flawed

Did desire go to ravenous?
Still you're no step closer to tell us
Of your fabled times, left empty on the side

We stand in line
Approaching the light that will change our lives
Yet we still crave things we cannot have
Overcome by greed until the bitter end
All the weakness that comes before me
Forcing me to fall into the void
Left by our world

Into the (n)ether - we all fall
Into the (n)ether - into the void
Non existing ether - heaven forlorn
We all fall - into the void

Defied
We all fall - into the void
