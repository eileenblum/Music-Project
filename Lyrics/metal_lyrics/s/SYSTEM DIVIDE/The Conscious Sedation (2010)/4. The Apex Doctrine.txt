Brainwashed and programmed
Begging for approval, what approval?
We crave things out of reach
A vicious circle of social needs

My own enemy is me

Fate twisted by metal, my mind has been torn

A scorching reality, a twisted hate resides in me
Through gears and bone it grinds its way
The releasing of a plague - reality

Through compulsive urges, another man is born

Life has come crashing before my eyes
As the person deep within me dies
Transcending all

Fate twisted by metal, my mind has been torn

My own enemy is revealed
My own enemy is me

Debilitating reality, is there a point, am I even awake?
I am nonmipotent, am I poisoned beyond the point?

Now don't disappoin them and do what you're told
Like cattle to the slaughter, no will to oppose
Independence denied

Inside me, victim of a raging war
Inside me, the person I was before
Inside me, I am lost in this maze
Inside me, caught in a tragic phase
Within me, release myself from denial
I'm no longer begging for approval
Inside me, I am lost in this maze
Inside me, caught in a tragic phase
How do I release the rage?

Now don't disappoin them and do what you're told
Like cattle to the slaughter, no will to oppose
Into an emptier void

We crave things out of reach
A empty void of social needs
