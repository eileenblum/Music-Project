Lies will find you hiding behind
Your words so carefully chosen

Just as it was before
Elusive words
So hard to understand - can it be?
All is forgiven

You're suffering with your regrets
Unable to move on, your thoughts are ripped
Twist the knife for the sake of argument
Repent...forget
You're bathing in your remorse
Unable to breathe, on lies you choke
Twist the knife for the sake of lying
Repent...forget

Your guilt, it burns through you
It lives inside you through you
Your guilt, it cannot stop you
Repent...forget

It all ends where it starts

Apologies are near useless
Unable to care about the deeds done
Twist the knife for the sake of argument
Repent...forget
I'm sorry is not enough
Subtleties you leave unspoken
Twist the knife for the sake of trying
Repent...forget

Your guilt, it burns through you
It lives inside you through you
Your guilt, it cannot stop you
Repent...forget

Can I expect you to forgive?
Can I expect compassion?
Can I expect you to forget selfishness?
This self preservation
Repent for your actions
The self destruction
Is this the real you?

Your guilt, it burns through you
It lives inside you through you
Your guilt, it cannot stop you
Repent...forget

It ends where it starts
