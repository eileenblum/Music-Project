Perpetual limbo, our life, strung out by routine
Why are we cornered by choices we made?
Stagnant progression
Perpetual limbo, our pointless life
Stagnant progression

All we are - worthless stains prolonging existence
What we are - a cesspool of procreating misery

Start - stop - play - repeat
Slaves to the grind, slaves to our basic needs
Start - stop - play - repeat

We are infertile, we are rotting soil
We are pawns on this wretched coil

All we are - worthless stains prolonging existence
What we are - a cesspool of procreating misery

Break up the routine - in me
Break up the spiral of our defunct lives

Break up the routine - in me
Breaking the chains

Start - stop - play - repeat
Slaves to the grind, slaves to our basic needs
Start - stop - play - repeat

Mechanized to follow this pattern of abnegation
Robotized to fit the mold of our world, surrender

Break up the routine - in me
Break up the spiral of our defunct lives

Break up the routine - in me
Breaking the chains

Words are written and voices are heard
Big empty gestures, yet nothing turns
This is the epitomy of mankind
The height of consciousness
Breaking the chains

Start, stop, play, repeat
An endless loop celebrating our defeat
