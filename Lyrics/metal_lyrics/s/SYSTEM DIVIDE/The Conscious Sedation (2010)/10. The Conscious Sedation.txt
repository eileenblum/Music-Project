My mind struggles to resist
Frustration
The modern decay
A disease of societal dismay

Dismay and apathy

To the weak ignorance is bliss
Your choice not to choose
And the walls are closing in
Reality seems but a dark dream to me
The inevitable sting of an irrelevant life
Vanished in mediocrity
Banished by a lack of free thought or will

Just breathe above the thoughts you hide
And then, when it all comes to pass
The fear of confrontation will be
The end of your vow of silence

One mind, no thought
Give up all sense of control
My own body, no self preservation
Reality seems but a dark dream to me
The unbearable sting
The pendulum swings,
Void passing moments have been instilled

No sense to emote
Will you ever realise
Of what it is you have been deprived?
No sense to emote

Just breathe above the thoughts you hide
And then, when it all comes to pass
The fear of confrontation will be
The end of your vow of silence
Finally we are the ill fated, we are sedated
We are the ill fated
Consciously sedated

We are the ill fated
We are the faded
