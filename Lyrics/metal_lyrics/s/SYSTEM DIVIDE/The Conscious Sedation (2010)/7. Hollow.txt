Behind closed doors fear is present
Preventing man from speaking his mind
Wisper simple words and then apologize

Evade the truth that's in front of you
Resist and deny reality

Will you stand your ground?
Will you regain your pride?
Redemption from truth
Redemption from life

Without cause you're unable
To speak the truth that you hold close to you
Ruining lives, sacrificing it all for your lies

Evade the truth that's in front of you
Confession, progression with hope to see

Will you stand your ground?
Will you regain your pride?
Redemption from truth
Redemption from life

In this living nightmare

Trapped in a living nightmare
An eternal limbo
My personal hell
Self destruct one lie at a time

Are you afraid of life?
Are you afraid to breathe?
Are you afraid to live?

You will stand your ground
You will regain your pride
Salvation from lies
Salvation within
