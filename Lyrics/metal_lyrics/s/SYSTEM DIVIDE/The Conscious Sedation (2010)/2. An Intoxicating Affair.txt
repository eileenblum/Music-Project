There are bounds to your uniqueness
When I see you drown in the shallows
Mirror deep as the skin goes
No further glance you dare need
And the surface ripples with pleasure

No mind within the heart
No heart within the mind ever known

You have no hope of reality
Stuck inside your mirror world infinitely

Molded in your image of your fine cast
And robbed by the sense of self
Praising your godlike stature
Another reflection of your batyre
By greatness self-compelled

No mind within the heart
No heart within the mind ever known

You have no hope of reality
Stuck inside your mirror world infinitely

An intoxicating affair
An intoxicating affair - with yourself

You have no hope of reality
Stuck inside your mirror world infinitely

With every chance of escape, it pulls you back in
With no chance of regret, the addiction persists
You're in love with yourself
