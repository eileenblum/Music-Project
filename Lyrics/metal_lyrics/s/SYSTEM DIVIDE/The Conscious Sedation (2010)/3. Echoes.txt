One thought that changes it all
The decisions that fail, judgement unread
Progress unseen, muted caution
Risks are taken by the hands that bind
That spin the wheels right before your eyes

I feel the echoes
From a distant past
There is no progress
A redundant circle

It'll never leave you alone
One way to go, nowhere to turn
It's so deceiving, pulls you in
Into the space within

We are the echoes
From an irrelevant life
There is no progress
A redundant abomination

It'll never leave you alone
One way to go, nowhere to turn
It's so deceiving, pulls you in
Into the space within

Granted false peace, mock reassurance
Treacherous silence speaks clearly
Marvel - pour out empty
Until you're sick
Then you made it yours
Until you're sick
One thought destroys it all
No decisions are made, judgement unread
Progress unseen, elevated awareness
Risks are taken by the hands that bind
As they stab you in the back

Only the past decides
What's next to come - what's long-gone
Welcome to the place of your last regrets
Too late for amends

It'll never leave you alone
One way to go, nowhere to turn
It's so deceiving, pulls you in
Into the space within
Hanging on the edge of what is real
One way to go, nowhere to turn
It's so deceiving, pulls you in
Into the space within

We are only echoes
We are just echoes
