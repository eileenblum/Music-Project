In this life
An ephemera
A perversity destined to fail, destined to fall
The pertinent question of what we've been created for

Why are we forced to be under darkened skies
Such insignificant lives
Consumed by mistrust
We are the displeased
Relish in the chaos you created

A spec of dust
Crepuscular dusk
We are death wasting life with every breath
We are children of man
Consuming all
Destroying all

We went too far
We were given this world and tore it apart
Outliving our days as if we're eternal
We went too far, too far

A glorious celebration
Our livid desecration
Parasites of life
Devouring all
Consuming all
With nothing left for our future to hold
Corrupting all
With everything left for humanity to abhor

What are we trying to achieve?
We are nothing but a moment in time
A lapse of reality
What are we trying to perceive?
To pertain a certain importance
The portent of man

Illuminate me
Show me the way
Give me a reason what are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?

Desecrate
Our legacy is fornever

'And god forsake us all'
You will cry in the end when darkness falls
Prey turns to pray
The biggest farce of all
We will die in the end

The life we live is a burden
And death is our salvation
Our memories will last
With the dead you leave behind

Why are we forced to live a lie?
Is there no light?
Is there no light?

A glorious celebration
Our livid desecration
Parasites of life
Ending it all
Consuming all
Consuming all

With nothing left for our future to hold
Corrupting all
With everything left for humanity to destroy
