Fallen from grace
Into the fire
Nothing escapes the flame
Rise from the grave
Like a Messiah
Riddance from all the blame

Sinners and saints
Stripped of their power
Taken your name in vain
Dog on a chain
Beast on a wire
Crawling against the grain

Out of the silent sky
Receive your punishment
Vengeance is coming down
For your inglorious descent

Eye on the cross
Hand on the Bible
Freedom from all regret
Easy escape
Out of dishonor
Terminates all your debt

Die with the shame
Live in denial
Playing the game of lies
Bringer of death
Master Belial
Sees through the false disguise
