Falling through the atmosphere
Glowing like the sun
Millions of light-years I have gone
Flying at the speed of light
Starships led me here
Take me to the orb from where I've come

The decades I have lost
To endless darkness
The world is far ahead
Way out of reach

Past the sonic barrier
Massive wall of air
Surface of the earth is coming nearer

For ages I've been lost
Just flying weightless
I've fallen far behind
Can't close the breach

Break through the masses
Dark trail of ashes
Shrouded by fire
Silence the machines

The spaces I have crossed
To end this darkness
The world is closing in
Still out of reach

Break through the masses
Dark trail of ashes
Shrouded by fire
Shine through the blackness
Silence the machines
