Demonize
Firing eyes
True profanity never lies
Nothing worse
Swear and curse
Devil's thirst

Blinding night
Devil's might
Leads you on to the shadowside
Angels fell
Serving hell
Evil spell

Fallen deep
Killed asleep
Hunted down like an animal creep
Breaking out
Breathing loud
Spitting blood

Bodies bleed
Devilspeed
Desperation never sleeps
Seeing red
Running dead
Empty-bled

To the fires of the lost
True believers lost their trust
In the Trinity
In divinity
