The solemn spoken
Prosper on fear
The wrongly chosen
Pleading through the tears
The bloated on high
Sentence will call
The final order
Echoes through the hall

Dead forest fall
Red mountains call
We are the servants of the saint
In blood we're born
Black unicorn
Polluted funeral
Misanthropic burial

A black omen
Colours the sky
The witches coven
Gathers in the high
The evil thirteen
Praises and cries
Memento mori
There is no place to hide

A song remembering a time
When all was nothing
This somber melody of mine
Will never see sunshine
