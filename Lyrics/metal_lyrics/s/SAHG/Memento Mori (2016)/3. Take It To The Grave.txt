Before the rising sun
You hear the warning come
Walk into the shadows
Seek the dark
And when the day is done
You'll be the only one
Walk into the palace
Raise the chalice
Seize the night

Raised by the hands of the dark
A dead moonrise
The solitude of the lonely
Comes as no surprise

When we reach the grave
No one can be saved

In silence
We linger
Touch of sunlight
Wherever you are
Come torture
Bring terror
It finds you
Wherever you are

If I survive you
I won't give the end away
The day I die
I'm gonna take it to the grave

Remorseless
Our hunger
Cuts deeper
Perpetual scar
No fortune
No savior
Will find you
Wherever you are

If I survive you
I will keep the ending safe
The day I die
I'm gonna take it to the grave

Before the rising sun
You hear the warning come
Walk into the shadows
Seek the dark
And when the day is done
You'll be the only one
You can't cheat the gallows
Cease the night

When we reach the grave
No one can be saved

If I survive you
I won't give our doom away
The day I die
I'm gonna take it to the grave
