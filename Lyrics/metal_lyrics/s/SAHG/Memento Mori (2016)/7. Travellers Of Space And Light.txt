We're creatures of the night
Drawn towards the fire
Like moths to a flame
Travellers of space and light
Going from our senses
We're senseless insane

Fallen angels of our time
Dead and gone before
The darkness takes your mind
Saw the soulless draw the line
Close the iron door
And leave your faith behind

They're preaching to the blind
Who doesn't know the difference
The truth from the lie
Travellers of space and light
Seeing who the blind is
Depends on the eye

Last believers of their kind
Left alone before
The sun begins to shine
Saw the thoughtless call the blind
Burn your wings before
You leave your faith behind

Go beyond the Sun
Searching for the only one
Searching for the dead and gone
Go beyond the Sun
Searching for the holy one
Searching for the dead and gone

Fallen angels of our time
Dead and gone before
The sun begins to shine
Saw the soulless draw the line
Burn your wings before
You leave your faith behind
