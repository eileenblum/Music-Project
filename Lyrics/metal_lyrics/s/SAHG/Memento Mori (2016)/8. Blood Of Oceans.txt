I sail for the unreachable horizon
I quail upon the powers of the sea
I'll pay with life like those
Who sailed before me
I'll lay forever swallowed by the deep

Come to the ocean, my friend
Come to your savior
Come where your blood will descend
Come to your slayer

They say there is no bottom to this ocean
Awake unearthly creatures of the deep

Come to the ocean, my friend
Come to your savior
Come where your blood will descend
Come to your slayer

Colour the oceans red
They answer your prayer
Come to the ocean, my friend
Come to your savior
Come to your slayer

Det blir mÃ¸rkare
Stormen blir sterkare
Eit trugande brÃ¸l frÃ¥ eit frÃ¥dande hav
Kjenner kreftene
Trengjer seg nÃ¦rmare
Dei vil ta deg ned i di vÃ¥te grav
