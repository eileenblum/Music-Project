Wander into darker times
Under is where our fortune lies
Turn and be gone
Change the road you're on
This one will bring you down

Climb the hollow mountain
And soon you'll trample through
A bottomless hole with a shell of gold
You still believe it's true
It's true

Mindless
Hear them cry for help
Crisis
Save us from ourselves
