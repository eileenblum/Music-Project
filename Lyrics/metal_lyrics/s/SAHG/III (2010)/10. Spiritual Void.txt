Come along, come face the darkness
Shiver from the cold you breathe
Ramble through the fog regardless
Look for what the eye can't see

Gone before the morning rises
Song of bliss is all you hear
Sink into your toxic solace
Go before the smoke has cleared

Escape the spell you're under
Close the doors before you leave
The truth will break and sunder
Cross the verge of vanity

From your book of dark enchantment
Images before you heave
Stare into the dead and silent
Once you see it you'll believe

Rising out from the dead of the night
Comes the sinister creature that pulls you out
From your spiritual void
All your doubts are destroyed
It's the ghost that you never could avoid
