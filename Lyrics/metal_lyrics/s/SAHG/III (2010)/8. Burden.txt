Seems you've crossed the seventh border
Strive with the load on your back
Endless weight upon your shoulder
Stray from the chosen track

Fall off the edge in the blink of an eye
Tossed and thrown down the stony side
Trapped under stone and the weight on your mind
Walk with your burden
Toe the line

Time you lost your fierce debaucher
Tire aches in muscle and bone
Find someone to share the torture
Can't stand to bear this alone

Lost on the way
To where conscience will turn to stone
