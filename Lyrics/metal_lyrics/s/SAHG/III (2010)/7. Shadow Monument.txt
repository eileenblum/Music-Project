All this fear that you hide
In the darkest corners of your mind
Shadows reach, you're running blind
Searching for an exit you can't find

A shadow monument was raised upon this ground
Within its shadow you're forever bound

Wicked deeds, twisted mind
Your imagination's running wild
The greatest fear haunts the night
Run towards the crack of morning
Rescued by the force of light

A shadow monument was raised upon this ground
Under its fundament your fears are six feet down
Your trouble's gone away and never can be found
Within this shadow you forever will be bound

Where comes this horror from?
Imagination can do wrong
Did it descend through time
Remaining from another life?
It's in your mind
