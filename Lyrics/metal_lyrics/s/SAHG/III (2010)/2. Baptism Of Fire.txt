Dive head first into the blaze
Blistered and scorched by the flame
Breathe through the pyre and awe
Like it's the last breath you'll draw
Now is your moment of fate
Pass the trial or damnation will follow

This is the time and place
To cross the line
Suffer for your mistakes
Fate will decide
Here's your baptism of fire

The flame burned a hole in your mind
Cast your soul into the wild
It manifested your sins
Soon purgatory begins
You will belong from this time
By the flame with your sickness and sorrow

Conscience burning
Guilt's returning
Blame grows higher
Down on your knees
Chase this remorse away

Find no release nor escape
No more fire exits to take
So breathe through the pyre and awe
'Cos this is the last breath you'll draw
Now you belong for all time
To the flame with no hopes of tomorrow
