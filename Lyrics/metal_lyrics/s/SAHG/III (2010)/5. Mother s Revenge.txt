Stormclouds threaten from the sky
Flood is coming
Turn the the tide
Rolling thunder, lightning strikes
Earth is shaking
Ocean starts to rise

Mother's watching
Upon her children's vice
An age of devastation she's survived
Anger wakens
Her patience has run out
Children of the devolution
Watch her vengeance come about

She will let the stormwinds out
Swipe all this waste off the earth
Flames will set this world alight
She will hunt the children screaming
In the end they will be drowning
In the tears she cries

Taint the water
Defile the air she breathes
Fill her veins with poison and disease
Run for shelter
She'll set your homes aflame
Progeny of desecration
Only have yourselves to blame
