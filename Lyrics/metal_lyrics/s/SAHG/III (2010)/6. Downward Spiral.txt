Land of the blackened sun
End of the line
Reach point of no return
No place to hide
The chase is on
Nowhere left to run

Before the break of morning
Follow the sign
And let coincidence decide
The way you've come
You're the only one

Creeping, crawling
Break through falling ground
It's reaching for you now

Ride the downward spiral down
Head for the underground
Can't escape this remorseless ride
Don't believe in miracles
Into the void you'll fall
The last descent is on
Downfall's begun

Creeping, crawling
Break through falling ground
It's reaching for you now
