Point out the liar
Blood of your cross on his hands
Fuel to the fire
Too rigid to understand

Don't need your evidence
Wretched lies, vile offense
Word of the Trinity
Still will be plain for all to see

Blame of the denier
Blame of the denier

Careless to reason
Nails of conviction run deep
Lifetime of treason
Never accept your defeat

Traitors with bad intent
Infidels the Devil sent
For your profanity
You will be burned eternally

Blame of the denier
Blame of the denier

Don't need your evidence
Twisted lies, vile offense
For this profanity
You will be burned eternally

Blame of the denier
Blame of the denier
Justice will rise
Heaven decides
The limit between what's wrong and right
Blame of the denier
