A holy storm is on the rise
A mighty roar out of the skies
The wrath of God we must endure
Or suffer to The Devil

Thunder gives another warning
Before the lightning strikes
Unbounded leniency has run out
Will we see the dawn of morning
Or walk eternal night
A new beginning or boundless demise
A new beginning or boundless demise

Then from the bottomless abyss
The monstrous counterstrike begins
Angelic frost and hellish fire
Collide to reign forever

Thunder gives another warning
Before the lightning strikes
Unbounded leniency has run out
Will we see the dawn of morning
Or walk eternal night
A new beginning or boundless demise
A new beginning or boundless demise

Thunder gives a final warning
Before the lightning strikes
Unbounded leniency has run out
Will we see the dawn of morning
Or walk eternal night
A new beginning or boundless demise
A new beginning or boundless demise
