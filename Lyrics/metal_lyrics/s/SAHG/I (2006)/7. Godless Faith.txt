Through deserted lands I am doomed to walk
Black disgust evolves around me
I repress the fear as The Devil stalks
With the Hounds of Hell surrounding

So Satan rises before my eyes
In his presence my will gets feeble
Feel his demon inside of me come to life
Helplessly possessed by evil

[Chorus:]
I'm cursed with a Godless Faith
This unholy belief I'm bound to
I worship a Godless Faith
This unholy belief I vow to

Then The Devil speaks in his serpent tongue
More temptation for me to suffer
"You believe I have damned you, my son, you're wrong
Open up to the powers I offer"

[Chorus]

In my dreams the hellish rule must falter
Break away the curse and bring me back to life

[Chorus]
