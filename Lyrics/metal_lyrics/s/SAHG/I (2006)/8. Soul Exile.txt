Foul is the earth on which he crawls
Defiles decay upon us all
A vermin born on the breeze
Ravages all with his feral disease

Evil's rising
The end of all beginning
There's no hiding
From the embrace of Evil

Abide by the Devil inside
Exile our souls to the darkest night

Minds are so easily deceived
By the seductiveness of greed
He's taken hold of the key
Into the mind where God used to be

Darkness rising
He's fixed his eye upon you
So despising
And hopelessly seductive

Abide by the Devil inside
Exile our souls to the darkest night
Exile our souls to the darkest night

Evil's rising
The end of all beginning
There's no hiding
From the embrace of evil

Abide by the Devil inside
Exile our souls to the darkest night
Exile our souls to the darkest night
Exile our souls to the darkest night
