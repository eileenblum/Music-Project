I wander restlessly in shelter of the night
I hunt in solitude in hiding from the light

The Undead writhe among you
The Undead writhe among you

My quest is tireless in search for mortal souls
You have been chosen now your death you must behold

Dead spirits circle around you
Vultures of Hell surround you
They crave to feast upon your soul

River runs red
Blood will be shed
The Executioner Undead

I'm doomed to give you retribution for your sins
So beg for mercy now before the end begins

My death relies upon you
My death depends upon you
My fate demands you pay your toll

River runs red
Blood will be shed
The Executioner Undead

The Undead writhe among you
The Undead writhe among you
They crave to feast upon your soul

River runs red
Blood will be shed
The Executioner Undead
