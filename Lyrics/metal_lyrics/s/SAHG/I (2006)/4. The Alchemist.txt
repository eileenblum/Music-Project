Wander forth in silence
Always walks alone
Sworn his sole abidance
To the Holy Stone

Happiness surrounds him
Everywhere he goes
Joins Flame, Earth and Water
Worthless turns to gold

His gift's unwelcome
Let his soul go to waste
Set the magic ablaze
Set the magic ablaze

Scorn of alchemy

Sentenced to the gallows
And the golden robe
Ill-willed persecutors
Mercy they oppose

His gift's unwelcome
Let his soul go to waste
Set the magic ablaze
Set the magic ablaze

Scorn of alchemy

Scorn of alchemy
