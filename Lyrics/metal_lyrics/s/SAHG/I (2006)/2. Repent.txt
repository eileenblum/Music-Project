Slowly coming close to the end
Drawing close to the ever-lasting
All-enduring Flame
All approaching the end
Dawning of the end
Drawing close to the ever-lasting

Slowly coming close to the end
All approaching the end
Drawing close to the ever-lasting Flame

Don't try to purify me
Now and forever shall be
A time to sacrifice grace

Don't try to purify me
My spirit never shall be
Forced to sanctify itself

Fall from a crack in the sky
And fail to rise again
Caught by the blackened eye
Your alligience you'll repent

Don't try to purify me
I know there never shall be
An age of virtuous innocence

Gospel so mesmerizing
Drivingly sensitizing
It invalidates itself

Fall from a crack in the sky
And fail to rise again
Caught by the blackened eye
Your alligience you'll repent
