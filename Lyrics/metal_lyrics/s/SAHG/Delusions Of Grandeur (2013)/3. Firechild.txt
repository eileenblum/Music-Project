Firechild comes alive 
From ashes now reborn 
Lifeless lies the sacrifice 
Scattered by the storm 
From the shelter where you hide 
Smoldering fire now ignites 
Reckoning will soon begin 
And tables will revolve 

Turning of the tide 
Firechild's arrived 
From this day your soul is shaken 
Overthrow begins 
End of all that's been 
From this day your mind is taken 

Firechild throw aside 
Rebellion and revolt 
All have seen the reckoning 
The tables are revolved 

Turning of the tide 
Firechild's arrived 
From this day your soul is shaken 
Overthrow begins 
End of all that's been 
From this day your mind is taken 

Reach far beyond the lines of reason 
Take all your hands can hold 
Make slaves of those who held you under 
And weakness will unfold
