Master of Astropolis 
Verging on the black abyss 
Conquered all the eye can see 
Hunger rages endlessly 

Circle the night 
Devious satellite 
The ground beneath your feet 
Slowly sinking 
Slip off the edge of the universe 
Into the black beyond 
Thousand light-years gone 

Drifting through a cosmic sea 
Lost the force of gravity 
Reached too high and gone too far 
Grand delusion falls apart 

Circle the night 
Devious satellite 
The ground beneath your feet 
Slowly sinking 
Slip off the edge of the universe 
Into the black beyond 
Thousand light-years gone
