Catch a last impression of the Sun
Swallow the delusion and be gone, gone, gone
And the Earth is drifting on the tide
The trees, the sea, the sky
Lifted away from the forces that held me bound
All disappears below the clouds

Seal off and barricade the entrance to my secret hide
Fear that the hunters of the spiteful will arrive tonight
Leave for a place inside the haze where no one else can go
Fall to their knees and serve to please the master that they know

Escape through space and time
Beyond the speed of light
Into the afterlife
Where the illusion comes alive

The last escape
I pass the gate
To the galaxy
Through the gateway of the free

Speeding through a cosmic hallway
Labyrinth of endless space
Passing through a hundred doorways
Find no exit form this maze
Colors shift round every corner
Pitch black darkness, brilliant light
Meet your Maker and Destroyer
Let her lead you through this night

Tread the water falling down
Break the Earth and leave the ground
Cut the air that around me blows
Bound for somewhere no one knows
Trust in this darkness now

Swim to where the rivers flow
Fly to where the cold winds blow
Linger where the sun won't rise
Mesmerized

See my harbor far away
Pulls me on towards the day
Captured in magnetic flow
Vertigo
