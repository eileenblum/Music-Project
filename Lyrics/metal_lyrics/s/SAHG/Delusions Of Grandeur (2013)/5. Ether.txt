My aetheric throne
At the apex of the sky
Where the spirit goes
When it's numb and hypnotized
Neon sun explodes
With phosphoric glow
Drink the serum of the lotus tree

Breathe the toxic fume
Let it penetrate your mind
Cosmic gardens bloom
Pull the covers from your eyes

This is my realm
My cosmic kingdom
I hold the helm
I drink the venom
The world obeys from underneath
Buckles at my feet

I am the ruthless one
I rule the Moon and Sun
From blood, skin and bone
I led my spirit home
Ascendants rising from the sea
Bring them all to me

Sovereign
Overlord
Majesty
Emperor

Sovereign - none above
Overlord - feared and loved
Majesty - Heaven-sent
Bow to the omniscient
