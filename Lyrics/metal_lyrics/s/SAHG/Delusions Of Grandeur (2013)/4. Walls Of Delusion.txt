Don't speak before I have broken the silence
Breathing is all you're allowed to do here
I point the way for you to follow
Do as I say and there's nothing to fear

Stay in the shadows unless you are asked for
I am here for you to obey

I own the air you breathe
The ground beneath your feet
The things that make you be
They all belong to me

My walls surround you
Ten mountains tall
They rise around you
And never fall

You're guided by my hand
No harm will strike again
The darkest side of me
Will give you shelter from the Sun

Ask no questions 'cause no one will answer
Hold your tongue because no one will hear
