Carnivore is tamed
The killer found his hide
Walk among the sane
Forgot what dwells inside
Madness lightly sleeps
Soon may rise to wake
The wall of reason is about to break

My twisted self has lost its peace
Last drop and then wakens the beast

Silent lay the dead
Calm before the storm
Bathing in their blood
A monster has been born
Massacre complete
Time to pay the debts
Still the beast and suffer my regrets

My twisted self has lost its peace
Last drop and then wakens the beast

I cut the Earth and carve my stone
The torture won't be missed
This is the place I cross my bones
My own Necropolis

My twisted self has lost its peace
Last drop and then wakens the beast
