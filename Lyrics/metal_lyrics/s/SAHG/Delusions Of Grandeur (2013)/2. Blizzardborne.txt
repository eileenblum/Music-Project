At the hammer down
I'm awoken
The center of the storm
Drained of will and power
I was broken
Now I am reborn

Hear the thunder roll
It has fallen
The hammer of the gods
See the sky cracks open
And the blizzard coming down
Life me from the Earth

Struggle with nature's power
Caught in a battle of the gods
Facing the darkest hour
Enter the shadow of the Sun
Only the strength of fire
Could bring redemption to me now
If I keep climbing higher
Soon I will reach the ground

Hammer down
Fall on the mountain
Hear the thunder calls for you

Look for the lighted way
Wait for a sign of the day
And praise to the Sun

Blizzardborne
Crawl down the mountain
Crowning of the long lost king
Hammer down
Call of the mountain
Hear the thunder calls
Hear the hammer falls for you
