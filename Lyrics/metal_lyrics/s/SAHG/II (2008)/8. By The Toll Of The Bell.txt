When you walk through the cold wind and shadow
And you want to be free of it
Open your eyes
The veil breaks
Crushes all your hopes that you'll ever be free again

If you search for good signs of tomorrow
For an omen of hopefulness
See through the lies
Graves await
The ones who fall for the treachery
Lost forever

Thundering skies
Forces arise
Called by the toll of the bell
Wakens the wrath
Opens the path
Out of this morbid spell

When you're forced into slavery for evil
There's no way to break free of it
Hopeless desire
Hell reigns
To the point where all is malevolent
All shall suffer

[Chorus]

Victims of unholy intervention
Raise your spirits from the deep
Let this tyranny control your minds no more
Waken up from conscious sleep

[Chorus]
