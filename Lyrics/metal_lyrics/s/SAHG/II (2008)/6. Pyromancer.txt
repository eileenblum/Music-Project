Pyromancer
Give the answer
That we all have sought
Forge the flame with your witching hands
And let your word be taught

Pyromancer
Give the answer
That your mind withholds
Rumor tells of a wicked master
Whom you gave your soul

Rituals of clandestine
That no man has ever seen
Bring the truth into the light
This we all invoke

No one will believe
Your force of fire
Many will deceive
The imposed liar
Feed the flame of the Pyromancer

Pyromancer
Life enhancer
No one heeds your call
You forecast of a great disaster
As you've done before

[Chorus]
