Black as night
Pale as morning
Through the mist she soon appears
Moon is bright
Gives no warning
Of danger closing in

Out she strides
From the shadows
Mystic temptress warm and fair
Eyes alight
Stare so hollow
Bracing force that draws you near

Fall into the fire
Senses override
Infamy incarnate has arrived
So red and bright
The sirens of the dawn
Enclose the mind

Trapped inside
The midnight shadow
Soaring in a restless state
Paralyzed
Fixed by poison
Can't escape her warm embrace

[Chorus]

Swathed in darkness as she rides
Crimson eyes are shining bright
Wicked temptress in control
Burning power taking hold

[Chorus]
