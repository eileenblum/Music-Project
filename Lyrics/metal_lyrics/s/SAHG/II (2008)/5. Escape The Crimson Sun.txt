Astral arks
Float across the halls of the universe
The Odyssey of Man
Barren land
Withers in the shade of atomic night
Ashen desert sands

Lunar light
Guides the way as Jupiter's moons arise
Supernova surge
Crimson shine
Galaxies converge from afar and wide
Slowly they emerge

Fugitive from atomic storm
Escape the crimson Sun
And be reborn

Stars alight
To witness the return of terrestrial life
Witness our rebirth
Gather 'round
Children of the Earth
Join this cosmic ride back towards the Earth

Fugitive from atomic storm
Escape the crimson Sun
And be reborn
