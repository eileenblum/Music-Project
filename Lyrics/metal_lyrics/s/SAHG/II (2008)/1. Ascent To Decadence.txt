People have called him a liar
Since the beginning of time
Keeper of endless desire
Leading the way for the blind

He stands at the foot of the mountain
Dwells by the shore of the sea
Cries at the forces about him
Pleading to let him be free

Ascent to decadence
The punishment for sloth
When spirits rise
And they're denied
They fade and die
They die

Prosper on tarnished illusion
Taking the easy way out
Trust in a shallow solution
Add one more miss to the count

[Chorus]

Perilous quest for the timeless planet
Weight of the world on your back
Reach for the skies
Where your fortunes are kept
Don't let your demons betray you
And send you to demise

People have called him a liar
Since the beginning of time
Keeper of endless desire
Leading the way for the blind

[Chorus]
