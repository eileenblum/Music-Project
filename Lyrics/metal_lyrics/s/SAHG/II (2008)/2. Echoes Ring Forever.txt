Riders of thunder
Against the storm we fly
Force across the obstacles
On the mountain high

Gravely they ponder
The overlord decides
Pointing out directions
For our course of life

We are rebels lost in time
Our opponents are sublime
But the echoes ring forever
Through all time

Lords of conclusion
Alliance of the wise
Designate the better
Through a common eye

[Chorus]

Riders of thunder
Against the storm we fly
Force across the obstacles
On the mountain high

[Chorus]
