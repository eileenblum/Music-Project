Hide inside the gloom
When the wizards arrive
Demon's dance unfolds
In the flickering light

And the starlight choir
Echoes to the owls
Dancing 'round the fire
With the wolf they howl

Onward the moonlit trail they roam
Where the trees are tall and whispering their moan
Leaves coloured pale blue by the moon
When the wind relents, you hear them chant
"Time is coming soon"

And the starlight choir
Echoes to the owls
Dancing 'round the fire
With the wolf they howl

Then a light shines oh so bright
Blood runs cold and time stands frozen
Oh then a light shines up so bright
The long-awaited time has come now

Through the night
Flying higher
Take us to the darkest of desires
Kill the light
Quench the fire
Force of lust becomes so strong
Take our souls and we'll go on without
