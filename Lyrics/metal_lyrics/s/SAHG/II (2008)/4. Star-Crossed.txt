Gave up the Earth to a treacherous kind
Proven superior with relentless might
They quench their thirst on the blood of their likes
Who suffer worse and forever will in death or life

Enforce the whole world with a wisdom profound
Of how to tread one's fellow man down
Dishonest means lead the way to the crown
And though he pleads he'll forever ever be

One more in the hands of mankind
Ravage the world far and wide
More fall in the path of mankind
Conquer and burn 'till no more is left to defile

When every land is raped with war
And blood is shed on every shore
When every source of life runs poor

What more?

Inside this wicked world
Pursuing our own kind
It's in your blood, it's in your head
Turn to the universe
A thousand wars to fight
It's in our blood until the end
The end
Bloodquest never ends
