Meeting like sun and the moon,
felt bound beyond space and time,
but suddenly with no reason it crumbled

It all went down during bright noon,
when lustful moon was but still high,
it sealed their fate immer getrennt,
rise, hate, rise.

What were the eyes that only lie
destined to ask and with whom vie,
will remain a secret to a heart, to a soul
and the rest is silence.

Tall tales about celestial bodies
never seemed so real,
what if we are two
travelling our way?
Our paths could've never crossed
or we could have met
to crush into atomic phenomenon.

But we just frictured,
in the most delicate manner,
both felt something strong enough,
to never forget the great L eye.

Bodies scatter. One feels
motion, distance, longing, yearning.
Another feels hate, sickness.
