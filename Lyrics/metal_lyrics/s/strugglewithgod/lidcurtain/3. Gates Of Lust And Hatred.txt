At night comes howling
to take all strolling thoughts, to dream,
to live in a realm that is fixed,
bordered by heartless heart

wind is blowing

to hear the boldest statement
and see it turn completely untrue

rotten to the marrow
given hope - hollow

her lips were wet with venomous poison able to
open the gates of lust and hatred aimed at you
