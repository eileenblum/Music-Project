You will never break this wall
Too damn wide for you
Metal sound that stands so tall
You'll never break through

Bolted gates with iron bars
Each stone is a man
Fighters of immortal wars
Here you'll meet your end

[Solos]

Souls of brothers dressed in black
Musicians by name
We have reasons to come back
Feeding up the flame

Masterpieces to create
Showing what we play
Helping us rebuild our fate
And we are here to stay!

Flameâ¦ coming straight from me
Something you can't see
Gathered forces like a wall
Comeâ¦ face us if you can
Then you'll understand
These stones you'll never destroy

Darkstoned wall
Come to me
We're like one

Brothers by sound
Unity
We're like one

[Solos]

Flameâ¦ coming straight from me
Something you can't see
Gathered forces like a wall
Comeâ¦ face us if you can
Then you'll understand
These stones you'll never destroy

Flameâ¦ coming straight from me
Something you can't see
Gathered forces like a wall
Comeâ¦ face us if you can
Then you'll understand
