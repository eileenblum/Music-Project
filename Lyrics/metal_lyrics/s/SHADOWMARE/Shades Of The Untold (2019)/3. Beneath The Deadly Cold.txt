Swimming over seas, into clouds of deadly stray
Screaming loudly, "Please, don't let me die this way!"
Beneath the deadly cold I am, I will freeze to death

Arctic glass of doom, glacier field of wasteland
Death will be here soon, I can't feel my frozen hand
Beneath the deadly cold I am, I can't move no more

[Solo: Chris]

Plateau of disgrace, thousand miles of frozen bound
Terror without face, holding my feet to the ground
Beneath the deadly cold I am, free me from this pain

In this barren proof, lain to waste in scorched throat
Formless shadows move, into fading eyes of hope
Beneath the deadly cold I am, I will freeze to death

I amâ¦ the voiceâ¦ you are hearingâ¦ beneathâ¦ this
Deadlyâ¦ frozenâ¦ rotten landsâ¦ of cold death!
I amâ¦ the airâ¦ you are breathingâ¦ beneathâ¦ this
Deadlyâ¦ frozenâ¦ rotten landsâ¦ of cold death!

[Solo: Jorguius]

I amâ¦ the chillâ¦ you are fearingâ¦ beneathâ¦ this
Deadlyâ¦ frozenâ¦ rotten landsâ¦ of cold death!
I amâ¦ the endâ¦ you are seeingâ¦ beneathâ¦ this
Deadlyâ¦ frozenâ¦ rotten landsâ¦ of cold death!

[Solos]

I'm the voiceâ¦ I call you
I pull you down while you struggle to get out

I'm the airâ¦ you suffocate
I seize your breath so you can never shout

I'm the chillâ¦ that holds you tight
Suicide is some kind of a helping hand

I'm the endâ¦ you're turning stone
I'm telling, "It's over," to a dead manâ¦

Dead manâ¦
Dead manâ¦
Dead man!
