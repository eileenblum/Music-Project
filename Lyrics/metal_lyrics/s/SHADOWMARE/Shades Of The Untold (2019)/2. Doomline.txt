Scratching scream
Of a murder scene
Yelling everywhere
Killer's loose
Breaking news
Do you really care?

Corruption's ruling in this damn world
Hidden from us, spreading their own word

Corruption deceivers turning believers to shit
Taking money, taking freedom throw us in a pit

Showing scars
Of moving wars
Fallen dreams of youth
Freedom key
Or misery
Is this shit still true?

Corruption's ruling in this damn world
Hidden from us, spreading their own word

Corruption deceivers turning believers to shit
Taking money, taking freedom, throw us in a pit
Information tells us nothing, more lies daily shown
Through the screen box they control us, manipulation

Corruption deceivers turning believers to shit
Taking money, taking freedom, throw us in a pit
Information tells us nothing, more lies daily shown
Through the screen box they control us, manipulation

Faking
Lying
Hiding
Covering
Stealing
Taking
Grabbing
Fooling
