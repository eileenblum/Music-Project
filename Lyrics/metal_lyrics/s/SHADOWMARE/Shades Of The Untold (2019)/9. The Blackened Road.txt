Rising the dead on earth
Remaking our way back
On burning grounds we shall stand!

Road of a thousand years
Blood flows like million seas
Angels shall burn in our hands!

[Solo: George]

Planting back our seeds
We rise through this damn blight
We will make this ground shake!

Spreading the word like
A thousand piercing knives
Rise again my followersâ¦ we are back!

Weâ¦ soldiers of doom
We'll march
Throughâ¦ blackened road
We'll march
Joinâ¦ we shall stand tall
As one
Riseâ¦ blackened road
We'll march

[Solos]

Standing by our side to conquer all
We can't deny 'cause we are one
See through my eyes to take my hand
This road is ours and we shall stand

Weâ¦ soldiers of doom
We'll march
Throughâ¦ blackened road
We'll march
Joinâ¦ we shall stand tall
As one
Riseâ¦ blackened road
We'll march

March!
