Calling machine to this system
Calling a hymn overtaken by them
Making webs beneath this air
Nuclear warheads, science is a warfare

Hell, future of a vision rot and damned
Devils of aggression rising to burn
Will be a story to tell, marching to a future hell

Fear, sirens of a coming rain of fire
Fallout over nations turning wasteland
Will be a story to tell, marching to a future hell

Cities erased, future collected
Cultures erased, some errors detected
Twilight highways reaching nothing
Global decays, connections increasing

Hell, future of a vision rot and damned
Devils of aggression rising to burn
Will be a story to tell, marching to a future hell

Fear, sirens of a coming rain of fire
Fallout over nations turning wasteland
Will be a story to tell, marching to a future hell

Pride is a slave of war, slave of state
Ruling nothing, like ruling everything
They buy, they sell, they feed our own hell
Searching the cure for a plague they canât tell

[Solos]

Searching elsewhere, searching future
Finding despair, disintegrated in this world
Searching a light, searching a cure
Finding disease, step inside and see our future

Hell, future of a vision rot and damned
Devils of aggression rising to burn
Will be a story to tell, marching to a future hell
