I'm the shade
Hidden from the light
Visions fade
Like the shadow in the night

I'm in sightâ¦ but you cannot see me!

Breathing dark
Moving side by side
You're the mark
I will kill you on sight

Cannot hideâ¦ you can't hide from me!

Blend in darkness
Death awaits insideâ¦ helpless!

Cloaked in black
Nothing more to choose
Out of track
Step inside and you lose

I'm in sightâ¦ but you cannot see me!

Chilling spine
Frozen on the ground
Going blind
Screaming loud without a sound

Cannot hideâ¦ you can't hide from me!

Blend in darkness
Death awaits inside...

Blend in darkness
Inside shadows I roam free to kill

[Solos]

Blend in darkness
Death awaits insideâ¦
Dwell in madness
Death awaits insideâ¦ helpless!

Helpless!
