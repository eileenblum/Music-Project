Between remembrance and the cold hug of fate
There's no allegiance (of) what memory creates
(if) it serves me well, I remember a place
(but) there's no more to tell (of) the oblivion space

City undone, lost in time
Realms of oblivion

Lost, forgotten place
Pale faceless end
It shall not rise, to fall again
Wanderers gone
No one has told
What time forgot, lifeless and cold

Roof of the world at the cold edge of hell
There's no one there for a story to tell
Slaughter and death, the carnage eve
(if) you find the place, you can never leave

City undone, lost in time
Realms of oblivion

Lost, forgotten place
Pale faceless end
It shall not rise, to fall again
Wanderers gone
No one has told
What time forgot, lifeless and cold

[Solos]

Lost, forgotten place
Pale faceless end
It shall not rise, to fall again
Wanderers gone
No one has told
What time forgot, lifeless and cold

We are alone
Destroyed and gone, ruined youth unborn
Fate was not kept, ravaged and thorned
Shapeless figures, scorched structures
Time has forgot
