Welcome to the pyramidâ¦ top of the grid
Counting people, stealing voiceâ¦ freedom is no choice
Telling people what to takeâ¦ relentless snake
Without voice they all can speakâ¦ "showing who's weak"

Leaders of the ancient timesâ¦ superior minds
Knowledge past through ages goneâ¦ waiting so strong
Connecting the chains and dotsâ¦ through world-wide plots
Supremacy, it takes it allâ¦ where freedoms fall

Controlling the wealth and powerâ¦ tyrants they descend
There's no answers to the questionsâ¦ that you'll understand
They control the evolutionâ¦ populations fear
We are facing facts from false talesâ¦ new world order's here

Absolute order
Over our own lives
Dominant power
They generate lies

[Solo: Jorguius]

Renewing the matters of our doubts
Implanting the new thoughts in our 'cause
Vanquish the weak as once was told
A new world order in this hopeless world
Economy and politics crumble down
While few know how to endure and hold the ground
We'll never speak the language, we'll never trade the coin
Submission is out of question and we will never join!!

[Solo: Chris]

When the door shall open
The eye will set it all
Rite of passage began
And all we know shall fall

Elimination starts
While you're still amused
Numbers we have counted
Numbers to reduce
