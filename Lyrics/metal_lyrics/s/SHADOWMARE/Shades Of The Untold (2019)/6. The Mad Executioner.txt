Blood is the game, it's always the sameâ¦ adrenaline it starts
Seeing you run, I'll stab you for funâ¦ stabbing your cold heart

Don't need to waitâ¦ I am here

Joy in my head as blood is still redâ¦ I must have some fun
Walking crazy, went like frenzyâ¦ stabbing everyone

Don't need to waitâ¦ I am here for you

Insanity, wandering freeâ¦ through the madness wing
Step over here, no need to fearâ¦ you won't feel a thing

Don't need to waitâ¦ I am here

Look in my eyes, shake as you freezeâ¦ knowing what I mean
Sharpening steel, razors to killâ¦ some to strip your skin

Don't need to waitâ¦ I am here for you

Must feed my need from hunter's prey
I'll follow blood, drink while you bleed
You are my drugâ¦ myâ¦ need

[Solos]

Must feed my need from hunter's prey
I'll follow blood, drink while you bleed
You are my drugâ¦ my need

To wake me up, your flesh will do
I'll rip your heart out and limbs too
I'll follow blood, drink while you bleed
You are my drugâ¦ myâ¦ needâ¦

My need!
