We don't believe in nothing
Don't trust, rely in nothing
He was born through masturbation
Spit on the dealers of religion
High ambition and low moral
It is a vile combination
Religion = primitive!
I spit on the dealers of religion

God:
I refuse to prove my existence
The proofs deny the faith
Without faith I am nothing
I am nothing without faith

Shatter the icons
Prokill
Shatter the icons

Shatter the icons

Born with moral shackles
We are chained to the higher command
Gagged with plastic bags
Restricted from the cradle
Mandatory psychic injection
How to cleanse our filthy manifest?
Chaos = free will
I spit on the compulsive system

Shatter the icons
Prokill
Shatter the icons

Shatter the icons

God:
I refuse to prove my existence
The proofs deny the faith
Without faith I am nothing
I am nothing without faith
