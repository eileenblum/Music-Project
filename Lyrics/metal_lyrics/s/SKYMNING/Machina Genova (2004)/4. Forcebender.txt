The sound of tiny light steps from cold insect feet
Crawling backwards sweeping through a discordant evasion
A wormhole passed borders of time
The outer limits to our past
A sealed evolution
Senses forbidden
An organism stopped
I walk through the seven glitches
Glitches of nothingness
I walk through the seven glitches
Feeding on nothingness

Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend

Inhaling the essence in our souls
A void proposed, dismal
Juggling the reality
Spiral cloak
A fake nature
A black planet in disguise
A hidden section of life
Weave the fragments of our existence together
I walk through the seven glitches
Covered in nothingness
In nothingness

Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend
Forcebend

What is beyond the even horizon?
Another glitch, another loop?
It is the coroner of our time
Piercing the serpent omega

A sigh of redemption followed by a mourning star
