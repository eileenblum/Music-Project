Planet eater

What lurks behind our galaxy
In the corner of our time
Waiting, hiding, playing with its creation
A parallel circle, a piece of stretched time
A portal to Nebura divine dimension
Lunatic Pandora, a maniac's complex
Inhaled the atmosphere
A supreme element out of proportion

An atmospheric combustion of a tidal universe
Sessions divided into sections
Disguised membrane
Vital membrane
Vital tractions
Liquid assets deceased, decreased
Frozen ability some master blueprints
Aborted dreams soul absorption
Dwelling mind rot not easily detached

A ficted heaven truly it is hell
Moving cyclones rending new paths
A ficted heaven truly it is hell
Moving cyclones rending new paths
