Leader of worms
Dealer of shadows
Be bound with electrical tape
Great hand of tarmac
Filthy dispense
Wasting trust
Scattering debris
Darkening Zool environs entirety
A black halo
Creature of the void
Lingering splendor
A cosmic off beam
Tepid aroma still sprinkled silent

My present is here
Absent unsigned
Unseen posture of gloom

Troll technology
Troll technology
Troll technology
Troll technology

Creation of trolls
Universe, time and space linked into a sphere
Living distress orb
A theoretical beacon
Cloned intelligence
Composed beings
Aggressive technology
Miscalculated
Wait for the new race
The recent type by the highest being
Thy body is
Merely a vessel for the soul

My present is here
Absent unsigned unseen posture of gloom
We are no more the high breed
Are we devoted to our system?

Troll technology
