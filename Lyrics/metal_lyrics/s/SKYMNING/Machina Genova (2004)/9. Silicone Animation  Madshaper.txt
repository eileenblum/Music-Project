Filled with fake
Living your life like mannequins
You want to live like models, but live like excrement
Liquid standards powered into forms
You are ruined for perfection
Animated to fulfill pervert dreams

Silicone animation
Body parts designed compulsively
Silicone animation
Commercial appearance = molested

Produced in celebrity factories
Society's own little fake star
Playing the game of nothing
Like locust roaming the streets
Good for nothing
Ego pierced by the beholder
Good for nothing
An anomaly from life

Silicone animation
Body parts designed compulsively
Silicone animation
Commercial appearance = molested
