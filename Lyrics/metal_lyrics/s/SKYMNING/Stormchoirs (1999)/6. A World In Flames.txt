Fire - the flames reach higher
Fire - abomination fire
War - the one which will end all life

Through the misty forest
Smoke comes from the greatest fire
Fire between trees surrounds
The lake by the greatest battle

I would spread my wings and fly
If only I possessed the powers
Powers to get away from this
Evil world in flames forever

Through the misty forest

If only I possessed the powers

Fire - the flames reach higher
Fire - abomination fire
War - the one which will end all life
