Through all my life I have listened to the voices of those whispering sounds
I thought I had no choice between eternal flames or sacrificial life
I would never die!

Believe in the faith revealing the hate
Visions and dreams controlling the rage
Running through clouds a storm coming out
Fall from the grace shatter the maze

Lie!
It's in their
Eyes!
I hear the call!
Why?

As a cold breeze sweeps from the north
Like a frozen shadow I'm flying on my horse
I will defy those who have lied to me
I will torment their souls, their wounds will never heal

I've heard the roar, I've held the sword
I've felt the axe, I've seen the gore
I've witnessed the plagues, the pain
They have caused

Our shoreless lives will come to an end
Our forces will rise to the edge
Serpents and servants crusading our land
Are met by the knights of deny

Lie!
We can see it in our
Eyes!
We hear the call!
We know why

As a cold breeze sweeps from the north
Like a frozen shadow I'm flying on my horse
I will defy those powers who have lied to me
I will torment their souls, their wounds will never heal

As a cold breeze sweeps from the north
With burning heart we're pulling our swords
We will defy those powers who have lied to us
We will torment their souls, their wounds will never heal

As a cold breeze sweeps from the north
With the flame in our eyes, I'm flying on my horse
I want to feel the ice burning on my skin
Raising the banners together we will win!

As a cold breeze sweeps from the north
With burning hearts, we're pulling our swords
I will defy those powers, I can see it in their eyes
Everything lies
Everything dies
