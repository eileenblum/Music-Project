Just a man with killer instincts, just a man to history
Fooled by the words of reality
He couldn't overcome his fear
A man who couldn't handle the truth
But instead became insane
He couldn't see what meaning there was
To slave for others

He had to kill those unpure
So he could serve the immortality
One after one they fell for him as the
Knife got painted so shiny red
He had to kill to satisfy those in his head
And break out from the
Prison in their hell
He's just another who had to bet his
Soul to the burning eternity

Just another, just another - just another!
Just another, just another - just another!

The steel he's carrying in his hand
Which so many lives has taken
But who can blame him for what he's done
When mankind just shuts her eyes
Who wants to see a man go down
Who wants to look into his eyes
His soul is gone and his heart is petrified

When the pain caught his body and
He watched himself in the mirror
He got the courage to grab the knife
And take his own hated life
The voices are forever gone
His name people now take seriously
He's just another - he's just a serial killer

Just another, just another, just another - just another!
Just another, just another, just another - just another!
