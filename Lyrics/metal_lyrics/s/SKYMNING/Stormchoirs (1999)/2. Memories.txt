Look in my eyes
What can you see?

Memories keeps my hatred alive
Memories will never die
A man without a face
Calling out my name

I was blinded by beauty as I looked at her
But I was the chosen one to carry all the pain
Beyond all help, I was stuck in this world
With no return I stepped over the edge

My hopes were to be saved
But my hopes were slayed

Walking through the burning eternity
I realized I was marked until the world could sleep again

Memories keeps my hatred alive
Memories will never die
A man without a face
Calling out my name
