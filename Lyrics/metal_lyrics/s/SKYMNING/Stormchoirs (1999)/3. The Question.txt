When he came out through the mist
He was alone living on hope
That he would find what he had searched for
For all his time the answer of life

But no one cared for his question
And they wouldn't dare to tell him why
Didn't know that he had asked the forbidden question

He screamed for help, he begged for help
He broke apart, he cried for himself
He asked the women, he asked the men
But no one could help him to get the answer

But as cried this helpless man
This poor weak suffering man
He heard a voice, words of wisdom

An inner voice?
A voice from above?
A voice from below?
A voice from all around?

Sacrifice to get purified to realize
How to get the answer
Sacrifice to get purified to realize
The meaning of life

Now when he had this important clue
He asked for himself could it be true?
A matter of faith, trust and belief
At his inner mind how to achieve this height

This man had come to get the final answer
The only matter now was time
He had to make it before his sands of time ran out
And he would soon find out

An inner voice?
A voice from above?
A voice from below?
A voice from all around?

Sacrifice to get purified to realize
How to get the answer
Sacrifice to get purified to realize
The meaning of life

The time was out and he had got the answer
The meaning of life was to die
