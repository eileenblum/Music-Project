Feeling the ground shaking of chaos
Watching the skies turn red of pure anger

The dead warriors have risen
Sensing the war is here

Wolves, beasts and dark creatures gather!
Fight the unholy war together!

Darkness has arrived, for your lords fight!
Filling our veins with hate, exposing the fate
Day turns to night destroying the light
The slaughtering has begun!

I stand almighty over conquered lands
I've buried thousands of souls with my hands
Listening to the sound of war
Listening to the sound of the stormchoirs
