The dragon, the beast and the false prophet
They were the unholy trinity
They had to fight when the seventh seal was broken
And the sun turned black, and the time got frozen
At the fields of Megiddo, against the forces of God
They were fighting for the evil, as always one step behind

At the fields of Megiddo
At the fields of Megiddo
The fields of Megiddo
It's where the mightiest battle ever will be fought

Rise up from the sea so
Rise up through the ground
Now the two beasts are coming and
Now prepare for the gathering

The final fight between good and the evil
Was meant to be won by the other side
Now when chaos rules the suffering has begun
So it was written, and so it shall be done

At the fields of Megiddo
At the fields of Megiddo
The fields of Megiddo

Are haunted by the powers of war
