Electronic fire melting the concrete worlds
Manmade terminal storm blowing
Constructed to deconstruct
Constructed to shatter
Shatter the world

Electronic fire melting the concrete worlds
Manmade terminal storm blowing
Constructed to deconstruct
Constructed to shatter
Shatter the world

Hell did not exist
Until we created it

Shatter!!
Shatter!!
Shatter!!
Drop the Fatman!!
Drop the Fatman!!

Enter outer heaven
Move ground zero
Thermonuclear
Antigravity machinery
G-loc

Blinded by the light
Then comes the heat
Artificial supernova
Burning sky
Melting air

The time is nigh
It is sure to come
When all our sorrows
Will be washed away
Oxidated
Devoured by the fire beast

Inseminated with decease
Cloned in shape of me
Designed to delete
Rendered in my own image

An icon for generations
Generations to come
I will be worshipped as God
Future generations will hail
