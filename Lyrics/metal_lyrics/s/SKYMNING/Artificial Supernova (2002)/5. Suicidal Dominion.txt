See a reflection through the illusion
The black stone, evil machine, engine of chaos
A fatal error is creating our sin
Forced to act upon insanity
Blinded and guided puppets of destruction

The curse of mankind
Hollow, ego
All we know - the reality
Morbid, predisposed
Infected by sickness
Molested by hatred
Mastered by cruelty
Magnified suicidal dominion

All we know - the reality

Systematic shutdown
Misleading the influences
Systematic shutdown
Misleading the influences

So: stare through your shell
Machines and terror prevails
Blackstone fall
Machines and terror excels

Machines and terror prevails
Behold the magnified suicidal dominion
So, my god: fall!!!

Hollow, ego
All we know - the reality
Morbid, predisposed
Infected by sickness
Molested by hatred
Mastered by cruelty
Magnified suicidal dominion
