Synthetic visions and I say
Our visions take control
Humiliate humiliation
There is nothing we deserver
In this depending universe
Let me burn
Surround me with fire
Licking my wounds
Tasting my soul
There is nothing to regret
Just leave me in orgasm

Synthetic visions, plastic brain
Organic life, modified, bio enhanced
Synthetic visions, digital symbiosis
Living in lines to feed our genetic structure
Synthetic visions, synthetic birth
Digitally dissected, modified, metal surgery
I want to be left alone in my own world

Feed our genetic structure I say
Fear of moral in reality
There is no such thing as reality
We want satisfaction
Pleasure is our guide
Let me burn
Surround me with fire
Plasmatic gene pool
Sex with machines
The body is obsolete
Our bodies are obsolete

Synthetic visions, plastic brain
Organic life, modified, bio enhanced
Synthetic visions, digital symbiosis
Living in lines to feed our genetic structure
Synthetic visions, synthetic birth
Digitally dissected, modified, metal surgery
I want to be left alone in my own world

Fitted crops, synthetic
Obsolete bodies, synthetic
Unnecessary life, synthetic
Repulsively breeding, synthetic
