Lace is wet on your skin
Veins are pumping, showing his strength
Sweat on your breasts, touching
Creating your guilt, his hands on you

Forced life
Forced born
Shadowed
Evolved from hate
Forced life
Forced born
Shadowed
Remember the future

A stream of light in that hollow mind
A fetus growing inside the rot
A child of disgust genetics deformed
Bleeding your guilt, his hands are on you

Forced life
Forced born
Shadowed
Evolved from hate
Forced life
Forced born
Shadowed
Remember the future

Astral silver
You know what you are??
Astral silver
Cosmic dust
Astral silver
We know what you are!!
Astral silver
Useless

Astral silver
Parasites, eating ourselves

Forced life
Forced born
Shadowed
Evolved from hate
Forced life
Forced born
Shadowed
Remember the future
