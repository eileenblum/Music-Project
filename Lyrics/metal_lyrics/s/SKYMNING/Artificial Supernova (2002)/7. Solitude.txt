Rapidly rotting cities of man
Expanding pitch black shadow of decease
Genes mutating aggressively fast
Too late the insanity can't be stopped

Like a cornered beast, kill to survive
The line has been crossed, broken by greed
The future revealed, set long ago
Under the cloth our end is found

Move the hand of god
Feel a world in chaos
Move the hand of god
Turn his head away
Move the hand of god
Feel a world in chaos
Move the hand of god
Turn his head away

Ruins, vast horizon, veil of poison
Land scorched, molded putrid soil
Sand, nothing but sand and misery
Look, see, afraid: do not walk away

Like a cornered beast, kill to survive
The line has been crossed, broken by greed
The future revealed, set long ago
Under the cloth our end is found

Move the hand of god
Feel a world in chaos
Move the hand of god
Turn his head away
Move the hand of god
Feel a world in chaos
Move the hand of god
Turned his head away
