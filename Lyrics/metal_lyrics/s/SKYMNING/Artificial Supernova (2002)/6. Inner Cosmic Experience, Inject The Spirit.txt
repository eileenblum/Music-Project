Inject the spirit
Oh there is a rush
Flying above the mind and all the feelings
Misty visions is taking form
Dragging your soul to dreams of the past and the future
Everything is numb and weightless
Floating through spaces and places
A burning galaxy is closing

Inject the spirit
Flying high above your conscience
Inject the spirit
Welcome your new god
Inject the spirit
Reality has no effect now
Inject the spirit
Obey your new god

It looks safe and warm colors surrounds its appearance
This is far away from all fears and grieves
You feel like never going back
Reality have never existed here
Joy fills this: forever: your sanctuary

Inject the spirit
Flying high above your conscience
Inject the spirit
Welcome your new god
Inject the spirit
Reality has no effect now
Inject the spirit
Obey your new god

Inject the spirit

A strange unpleasant feeling is starting to grow
Something is happening
The colors are changing
Everything is changing
It is getting colder and brighter
You are going back out from this place
I know you think
Do not let me feel that cold reality again

Inject the spirit
Flying high above your conscience
Inject the spirit
Welcome your new god
Inject the spirit
Reality has no effect now
Inject the spirit
Obey your new god

Your fears and grieves are coming back again
You are not floating weightless anymore
Yourself and your memories are awakening
All you want is to get back in again

You know what to do
Inject the spirit
Inner cosmic experience
