Metal shores and seas of bronze, magic spirit heart of doom
Electric rain and rotting flesh, chiming bells of solid bone

Welcome to the festival - raising Cain
Sarcasm and scorn as the serpent uncoils
You've come to taste death and the sentence of stone

Iron chains and colossal chaos -  enslaving for the power of death
Evoke the evolution - now draped in sharp thorns of metal

Welcome to the festival - raising Cain
Sarcasm and scorn as the serpent uncoils
You've come to taste death and the sentence of stone

Unleash a will
To bring that venomous wind a heart of ist own
And to end
The dream spared from a haunting forse
Rip what's lionized
Speak with the tongue of pure abomination
Raise the fists
Nail the centre of the enemy's eye, O yeah!

You face the face of punishment - of fears unveiled by the end
We taste the wind by chaos cursed and watch the blades still their thirst

Sodomized and victimized
Postmortem tales - speak for the dead

Sodomized and victimized
Postmortem tales - speak for the dead
Living Cain - everreign
Postmortem place - blood's got to be shed
