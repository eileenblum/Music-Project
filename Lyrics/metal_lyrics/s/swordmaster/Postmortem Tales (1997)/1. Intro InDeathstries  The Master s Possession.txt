Black carnival omega - celebration of the
Manifestation
Fire, yeah fire fire - celebration of the creation

Prepare for the wail of the warring
The carnival has only begun
Souls, here we come
In times pure omened by death
Hunger, the hunger growa deep
Paramount position of power
Unleashed by the hand of iron
Grand feast of the ones
Sworn to the sword

Screaming in submission - blood runs down your
Epitaph
Watch the unleashed - face the wolverine
And you'll perish by the blade - so fade away
Force of fire
Here we come
We come as destroyers
Throne of bone
Bringing fright
Creating deep opression
So fear the night
And watch the obsession
The master's possession!

Black, the sky turns black
So the structures take form
Torn - we'll rent your body
Now free the powers of the force
Fire - the flames reach higher
Invasion - to still the redemption
Possess - we've come to possess
- Dream of flesh -
Rule and obsess!

Screaming in submission - blood runs down your
Epitaph
Watch the unleashed - face the wolverine
And you'll perish by the blade - so fade away

Supergrand - coronation
Arise - arrival - alive
Metalized - immortalized
Now await the eternal ride

Tatto the vault with a mark of stone
Engrave...
Recreate reality, explore the unexplored

Mondial marks
The end will come with fire
Burn...

Yeah, the carnival has only begun
