Crushed to dust
And the tales are spoken in postmortem ways
The hammering of horror
Yeah, now feed on the flame of the fear
Undivine intervention
Prepare for death you childs of time
The metal bells toll
No escape as the sentence falls
Forever severed from the bonds of flesh
Sanguin juice colls through soal and sand
Watch through the eyes of the damned
Reveal the lust
Then crush to dust

Revealed in lust
And the days are tokens of postmortem ways
So dream of Utopia
And see the dream of a destiny perish
Bond, snared to their hearts
With thousands of chains crossing the sky
Screaming to die
Enjoy the scene where the victims lie

Fantastic funerals brought from the tormentor
Iron reign
Red rain
Screaming in vain
Fantastic funerals brought from the destructor
Iron reign
Red rain
Screaming in vain
