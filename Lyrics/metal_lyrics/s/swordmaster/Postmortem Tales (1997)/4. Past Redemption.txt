Cascades of cold flesh
In a scenario of death
And powers pulsating
Strongly in the morbid sky
Soulless invaders
And the bloodless breed
Hearts drained on life yet alive

Nocturnal force, yeah rusty blades and withered veins
Force of destruction, decay and death!
Sensational wave of doom
Barbaric music opens bewitching
Captors of chaos, soul and steel
Thrilling release of wrath
No future no past
Finish the energy of souls
No beginning no end
Past redemption
No return from the Masters

Past redemption
Silver temple and the feast of flesh
Soulwine for the masses returning from their graves
Past redemption
Craving for pure paragon ways
Soulwine for the masses laughing in their graves

Watch the Night and taste the Whip
Watch the Thunder and taste the Terror
Hunger of the allied deepens to destruction
Day to year, yeah day to year to night forever

Past redemption
Silver temple and the feast of flesh
Soulwine for the masses returning from their graves
Past redemption
Craving for pure paragon ways
Soulwine for the masses laughing in their graves
