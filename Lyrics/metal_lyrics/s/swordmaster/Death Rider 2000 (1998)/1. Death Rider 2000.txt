No sleep at the mountains of madness
You will face the face of a fucked up race
Called the "Psycho Explorers" by those of mortal grace
Well, now scream:
"Ride the roads of the rider 2000"
- And you'll burn
Yeah, I promise you'll burn at this high level of fire
So scream yet higher:

Death Rider 2000
Jet black engine and blood octane
Death Rider 2000
Spitting fire in a murderous flame

Burning
In the skies
Dying, yeah, you'll die as you rise
Take a visit to the horrordome
Yeah, welcome to the death rider's home
Dying
In the night
Burning, yeah, you'll die as you rise
Take a visit to the horrordome
Yeah, welcome to the death rider's home

Burning
In the skies
Dying, yeah, you'll die as you rise
Take a visit to the horrordome
Yeah, welcome to the death rider's home
Dying
In the night
Burning, yeah, you'll die as you rise
Take a visit to the horrordome
Yeah, welcome to the death rider's home

A frequent vision of the freaks new mission
Pure soul exile!

Ever tried to fire bullets from the barrel of a dream
Ever been cut up in a dirty scene
Yeah, well you'll see, now see
This hideous tourbillion that moves with me
Your soul is your fee, what did you think?
That this ride was for free?
Commence your reign, cause you're now a psychonaut
So scream out in vain:

Death Rider 2000
Jet black engine and blood octane
Death Rider 2000
Spitting fire in a murderous flame

And what do you see, what do you see
As this hideous tourbillion moves with me?
"I see my name blow across this world"
Yeah, that's right, and you'll see it again and again
O' yeah goddamn!
