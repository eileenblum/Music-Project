Hey!
Well I got a time to kill and spines to chill
As you face that grave you must fill
No salvation can stand my frustration
Burning tough in a fiend aggression
So you say: "Is it your hate? You know it ain't too late"
But I guess you can't change your "fate"
It's sold, lost and foretold
So die my friend
Yeah, burn, baby, burn!

We're the aces reflecting death in dying faces
Raising Cain
Yeah, you know you're racing Cain
Heaven turns, explodes and burns
Come on it's Firefall!

Razor's race
Velocity of death and bloodstained wrath
Razor's race

Ever felt like a brick in a game?
Ever felt that everything turns out the same?
Ever felt that a bullet would take you through it?
That a fire would fit?
So lit it!
Ever seen your powers weakening to the end
And not give a damn?
Well, sometimes you just have to play with a bad hand
So turn to dust!
You're dust in this soulless land!

And soon came the days when the race unveiled its ways
So cold in its naked face
And eternity completed its grace
Closed was the gate, and sealed were their fate
Where the secret of death died
And the Soulless' ried became justified!

We're the aces reflecting death in dying faces
Raising Cain
Yeah, you know you're racing Cain
Heaven turns, explodes and burns
Come on it's Firefall!

Razor's race
Velocity of death and bloodstained wrath
Razor's race

And as the blood begins to leave you
Heaven turns, explodes and burns
"Yeah, you're just a player on the field"
And as death rises for you
No dream will ever save this souls from a cruel end
"No way, so die again my friend!"
Come on!
