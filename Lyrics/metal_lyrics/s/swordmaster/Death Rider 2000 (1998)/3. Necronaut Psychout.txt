Necronaut psychout
Hundred minds out on a soulcrushing tour
Mind transmission, it's the aces new mission
So tough in its kind
Yeah, you'll scream, now scream
Chemical astrodream of the team supreme
Away into ways in entombed waves
Why?
You'll see this death die!
Come on!

Fantastic wipeout
The killers are shouting out: "Come to the dome"
And you'll burn as a coppar soul of the midnight fireball
You say "Hey, no need to play" the master's gonna make you pay"
And it's your decision, and you'll better face this vision
Called the "Necronauts blood transmission"
Now listen:
Necronaut Psychout
The masters they are screaming out:
Necronaut Psychout!

Then you met this Necronauts saying:
"Yeah, death becomes you"
And your heart is lithium, your blood is blue
"Who's to score, churn venom to their core!"
And you stand as the monolithic man
Cursed in a monolithic land
O' yeah and you're among the damned!
