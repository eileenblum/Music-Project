Deepening nights seek across heaven's vaults
Now watch the scapes draped in Darkness
And with the new wind came fright to the lands
...Like a crying angel, devoured by poisonous clouds

...Under the brightening Pleiades gather
To haunt the penetralia of light and life
- An eternal journey in seasons of doom
- So arrive on monumental Death
....Under skies bleeding bloody juice
- The hunger for empyrean drew hearses
through the lands
Under the signs of times yet to come
Hear chanting cosmic songs

...And Pythonic powers reburn the everlasting wrath
In every spirit so hungry for flesh and Death
To structure the poison for heavens eyes
- Thrusting a serpents venom nexus to our rise

A wolf-herde's journey sworn since
superlansyne times
Draws near as the genesis of the structure opens
No palladium could ever bear the rage
Which burns as an allpowerful element of Evil here

Possessed by wrath, Obsessed by Death
New arts riding seasons of doom
Upon blood and ashes...darkness and fire
Under the flappering wings of ravens and vultures
- prepare for Death
