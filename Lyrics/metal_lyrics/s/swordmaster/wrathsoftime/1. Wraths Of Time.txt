...And the stars give only light to my eyes
Watching a quest within the trident's lines
To magically enrich my spirit with torment
And put the stones in the empire's throne
Fjelds towers aloft tall at my sides
- Enslaved in the dominion of damnation
The snow lies deep and i fight my path through...
...Damned fields and freezing works of doom

"Thou art superior - Death's Warrior...
You one begotten Son of Steel"

...Echoed once to me kingly voices
- The entombment and baptisal of my soul

"For in the prophecy of the eldest time it is written
In the very book of shadows"

...And ehereupon my rusty sword is drenced in tears and blood
- Bathed in the torment of thousands of souls

Midnight for years then years and again and again
tears to bring and bring from man
Hundred dark decades to wander, so many hundred more times
Times to wander within the Triad's lines
...Age after age in tragedies, Dominion

...And the towers of the kingdom seeks higher now
As Tragedies' Dominion's flag dances free
Witnessing in victory the fleeing race of centuries
Sorrow and the great perfection in death
Under icy metallic skies Satanic lands spreads
Darkness brings the deeds of hatred
And in these snowbathed and monumental reins
Triumphs return with an iron fist!

This torn page of death, a page from the Book of Shadows
Forever to be...
Under rapt eyes of baphomet
