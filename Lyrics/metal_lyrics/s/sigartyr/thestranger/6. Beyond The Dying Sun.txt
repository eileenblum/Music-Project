Feel the dark, cold winds blow across the seas of fate
Feel chaos wrap its loving arms around those who call

At Midgarth's end, the cycle of time stands still
As the frozen sky casts reflections of the barren lands below

A universe dies, yet a universe is born
For those who have become, beyond the dying sun

Released as a limited run of 100 pro-printed CD-Rs and inserts.
