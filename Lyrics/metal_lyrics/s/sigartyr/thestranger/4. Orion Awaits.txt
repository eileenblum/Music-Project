O through those thrice forgotten eyes
I see the gates of Now
A distant breath of yesteryears
Sealed with an ancient vow

Faded souls of unknown birth
Lie in wait before the gates
In dying throes, they enter forth
to be sealed in endless fate

But through those burning eyes I see
A key to eternal change
Chaos born, in void complete
Where destiny forged its name

In dormant sleep, yet seeing all
A shadow within steps forth
Orion awaits, its bastard child
To rise up in the North
