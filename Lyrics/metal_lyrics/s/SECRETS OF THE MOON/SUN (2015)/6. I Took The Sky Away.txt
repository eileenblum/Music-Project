Ineffable perception
one body unfold
the clean white
the shattered skin
now take the sky away

the moment you spoke out my name
you were too far away
now that I have written these songs for you
I can barely remember your face

your arms up in the mephitic air
out of reach on torrid chairs
you said the words you needed to say
but I lost your voice again

silence keeps burning your tongue
quicksand filling your vessels
you shall not forgive me this time
intoxicating possession

I took the sky away
welcome endless day

the moment you spoke out my name
you were too far away
now that I have sung this song for you
I can finally see your face
