I was given just one life
one heart
one soul
two hands
one hand to paint on canvas
one hand to stroke the skull

I was given just one chance to find the absent pieces
to clutch the blistering myriads of wounds
I was given just two hands
to turn the heavens upside down
now these are mountain summits to defeat
there is an end of joy
once the end leaps like a flame

Tu tâes perdu sur le chemin
Ta foi tâa menÃ© Ã  ta perte
Cesse de contrÃ´ler ton destin
Ta peur reflÃ¨te ton ignorance
Et la misÃ¨re de ta piteuse existence
Laisse toi aveugler par la LumiÃ¨re
Laisse toi gagner par les TÃ©nÃ¨bres
Laisse les voix pÃ©nÃ©trer ta chair
Il te faut perdre tes certitudes pour avoir accÃ¨s au Divin
Laisse toi gagner par la LumiÃ¨re

she gave me all that I promised to protect
here is the rood, here is the rose
here are the stones that hit you
from this day the clock hand is the scythe
and it cuts the mirth, the singing and the light
there is an end of joy
once the end leaps like a flame

draw
black charcoal
scythe
it cuts the mirth, the singing and the light

draw
black charcoal
scythe
no colours will ever reach the sky

I was not able to speak when my word was born
so I painted in colours until the colours were gone
