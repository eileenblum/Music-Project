The deepest hades
the mirror walls
like rolling thunder
this starving chaos

a rancid lair
a maze of ailments
so little did we know

blood sweeping cherub
stench from the mouth
the mouth of satan
here lies the sun with her children unseen

(invert) the living light
under the perished heaven dome remains the dawn of night
(pitch black) gaia divine
descend, the world needs you now â rewind

the darkest winter
black is the snow
black is the ocean
so little did we know

unaware of beauty
lambent in dust
it saw us die before

prayer and sermon
cut the silence
echoed in the distance
drowned in ascending storms

and as long as she alters the glare
she will be at my side
a revelation emerges
a holy lamp of the night

the slaves will be kings theyâll be
and from ivory towers they dive
to find life
to find eternity

here lies the sun with her children unseen
under the perished heaven dome
