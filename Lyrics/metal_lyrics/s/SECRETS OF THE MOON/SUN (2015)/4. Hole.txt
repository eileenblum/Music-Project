Fever now, start the cure
near and far, all is lost

angel with empty eye-sockets
the refined shall be your witness
from all the sounds that swing the universe
no oneâs ever gotten near you until now

gods and mortals
animal
itâs time to face the truth
there is no hope
give away yourself into the hole

church and temple
synagogue
itâs time to speak the truth
there is no hope
just wait and see right through

seven kings â on the seven tops of the world
throwing crowns into the void

four wounded angels â in the four corners of the world
holding daunting winds and let loose

now itâs time to bend me down on my knees
