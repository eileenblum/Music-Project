i breathe
so let me drown
i shall not rest
salvation pleases the soul

my work may be right

i am the heart
the snake is entwined
about the eternal core of the mind
by the corpse of nyx
i stand aside
my work may be right

i breathe
infinity in the spirit
i drown
like acid eats into steel
i rest
i shall not rest
i have found thee

the blood of the night starts dripping through your hands
and in fields of light you try to wash the stars away
be ever the trance of this tremulous throat
i have gone down o god into the abyss of the all

you have been given into the black shining waters
given to the night to the spirit of typhon
be still o my soul that the spell may dissolve
as the wands are upraised and the aeons revolve

my work may be right
my work may be right

i breathe
so let me drown
i shall not rest
salvation pleases the soul

rise o my snake
into brilliance of bloom
from the corpse of nyx
afloat in the tomb

reap and rejoice
there is no difference
i live through you

the blood of the night starts dripping through your hands
and in fields of light you try to wash the stars away
be ever the trance of this tremulous throat
i have gone down o god into the abyss of the all

you have been given into the black shining waters
given to the night to the spirit of typhon
be still o my soul that the spell may dissolve
as the wands are upraised and the aeons revolve

for I have found thee alike in the me and the thee
for I have found thee alike
