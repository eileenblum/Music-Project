like a black crib
enshrined in darkness
the egg shall be my grave

the temple beneath
the abyss above
witness chaos
and find peace in here

and then i see the all
when there is nothing left to see
when there is nothing left to fear
you are here

freedom is the serpent

night is forever
devour the tail
no walls will hide us
the mind is free

we are forever
no one else will ever be
and we see the nothing
when thereâs nothing left to see

freedom is the serpent

snake is king
serpent messiah

lifework in exile
a better world
poison in our eyes
kingdom in our veins

i can see with our own eyes
thereâs nothing in between
we are forever
no one else will ever be

freedom is the serpent
freedom is the serpent

snake is king
serpent messiah

snake is king
serpent messiah
