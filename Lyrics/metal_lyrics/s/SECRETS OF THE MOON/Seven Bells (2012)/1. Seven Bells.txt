o god forsaken universe
chaos from order
nuit is lost
once the first bell tolls

and you know nothing of him
and you know nothing of sin
rape the crystal statues of light
and it will kill you from inside

seven bells
they are the prophets
bringers of death

seven bells
enlighten our paths
to the glorious pits

seven bells
they are the all
and this is our conviction

seven bells
the holy saviors
eat their sacraments

the child will grow up
the naked splendour of nuit
come forth o children
this is the joy of the earth

for he is ever a sun
and she is ever a moon
and we are ever the stars
understand, understand
then sleep

seven bells
they are the prophets
bringers of death

seven bells
enlightening our paths
to the glorious pits

seven bells
they are the all
and this is our conviction

seven bells
the holy saviors
eat their sacraments

a new coming
