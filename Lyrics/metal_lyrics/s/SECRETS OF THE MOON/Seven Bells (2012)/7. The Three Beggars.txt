this world is coming to an end
the bells are tolling
calling for the devil send

you that have wandered far and wide
the church is open now
and all the stars are blind

itâs getting stronger
stronger than all words
itâs stronger than life
a genesis injection
this world ainât dead yet
this world ainât dead

this world ainât dead yet

this world - is coming to an end
the triumph lasts forever
the ultimate award

burning first
nothing left but ember
only we remember
only we remember

pain rise
grace falls
weâve been taught in pitch black chambers
the rise
the fall
the purest lucifer

satan
i am the three
and they are all in me
i never want to be free
servant
lets burn the tree
spit on the graves
take all the pain away

so dark
so everlasting
this malicious pulse
this thrilling sounds
when will it ever stop
when will it ever start again
there is no god that failed
when we will crawl to death

someone must die
when the three beggars arrive

pain rise
grace falls

the fall

this world is coming to an end
the bells are tolling
calling for the devil send

you that have wandered far and wide
the church is open now
and all the stars are blind
this world is coming to an end
this world is coming to an end

satan
i am the three
and they are all in me
i never want to be free
servant

lets burn the tree
spit on the graves
take all the pain away
letâs rebuild satans church
let him reign in here forever
let him roam through our corridors
let his time stand still
let him work for a thousand years
let him fulfil his paradise
let him kiss a thousand youngs
carried by the worlds supremacy

someone must die
when the three beggars arrive
