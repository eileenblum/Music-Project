the son
the holy word
worship and adore
bow down
the taker
takes the image of the self
now strike for freedom
youâre free at last

the demon
speaks forever
overdose
ecstacy and will
worship
now execute
grant me what you fear
i lead the swarm

black soil
the earth is shaking
a sinister sun
now burn the wings

sacred scorn
ravage through the womb
you are here now
youâre free at last

If the son therefore shall make you free,
you shall be free indeed

the mask is mine now
ways of the flesh
convoke the world
the hour is now

the mask is ours
praise the word
open the halls
youâre free at last

cold blood semen
spit through the halls
now enter lifetime
itâs what the image holds
burn the sun
a million years from now
conquest means victory
now speak the word

worship

every beast on the field
leave the beauty dying
now is the hour
the curtain falls

never surrender
never to return
towards a new sun
at the end of the world
