throw the stone
black apostle
ride the wings of death
the redeemer
the shunned lord
dive
into the deep

temptation
great sodomy
underworld draws near
the seed of death
the poisoned water
drink and eat
itâs all down there

turn blood into
wine
heartless
lifeless
crack

feel the scythe
the endless reign
we step upon a world aflame
breathe fire
stop breathing now
lick it
now kiss the flame

death
let kingdoms rise
through endless storms
the black owl flies
abomination
grand salvation
come on
rise!

turn blood into
wine
heartless
lifeless
crack

turn blood into
wine
what is this
that thou hast done?

kiss the flame
kiss the flame
kiss the flame
kiss the flame
kiss the flame

turn blood into wine
heartless
lifeless
crack
