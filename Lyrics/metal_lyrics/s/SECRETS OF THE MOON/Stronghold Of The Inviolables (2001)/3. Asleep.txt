There is no pain... no pain
You are in peace of mind and body
A peace entirely
Mind and body in a state of peace

Understand...understand... then sleep
...sleep...sleep

Your body losing all temptations
Your mind enveloped in darkness
Nothing can disturb you now
As you drift even deeper into darkness

And sleep...sleep

Do you hear me?
It's my voice
Are you asleep?

I'm asleep
