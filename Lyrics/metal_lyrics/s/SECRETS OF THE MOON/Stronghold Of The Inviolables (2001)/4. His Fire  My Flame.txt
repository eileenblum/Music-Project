Watched with the eyes of the ancient
When fire cleans the soul
The final constellation of stars
Slowly my flame erases

Add up the flame... until a new fire awakes

Memories... a final serenade
Traces between and below

When flames are past forever
A fire cannot burn
His fire... my ashes
Paradise in flames

Taste the hunger... taste the thirst
No final flame... a new rebirth

Add up the flames... until a new fire awakes

His fire... my flame
A final revenge... eternal pain

FOREVERNEVERMORE
