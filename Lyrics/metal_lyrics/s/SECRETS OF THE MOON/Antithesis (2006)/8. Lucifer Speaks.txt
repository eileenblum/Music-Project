They tried to speak with angel tongues
In vainglorious expressions
In absence they serve
Decline is long, dirty cold

In absence they serve
Decline is long, dirty, cold

This colossal darkness
Blackens the accused
For they stand alone
Anonymous
In chains

Lucifer speaks

You disperse the ground
With fragments of broken bones
They were not yours
You scatter a thousand deaths

Lucifer speaks

A new fire conceals the living
Similar to the ashes of the countenance
Apathetic they run the tunnels of blood

The darkness at the end of the tunnel
