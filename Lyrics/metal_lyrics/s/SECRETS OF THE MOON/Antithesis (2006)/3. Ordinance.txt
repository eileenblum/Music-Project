You cruel king
Did you mention that there are chosen ones
Who come forth

We wear the crown
God used to wear
This gruelling weight
It feels right

You cruel king
You cruel king

Maybe completed
Maybe divided in six
Accomplished by foreign hands
It is here
Where are you

It distorts the ambiguous
Feeds life with decay
Thirst and death
Immanent in ill-gotten souls
Is it here
Where are you
