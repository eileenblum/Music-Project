Today I washed my hands in ashes
I ate from the white doves
And yearned for Megiddo in excelsis

I feel that I breathe
I feel that he breathes
I feel that I breathe

I feel that he breathes

Yet Iâm punished
He is punished
Yet Iâm punished
Kick me down the stars
He is punished

God wears black today
While he steps out in the world
To carry the stillborn to the shore
And I strengthen him to throw us into the fire
His glint is a phenomenon
Eat your children cause they are yours
To see what they saw
To remember darkness
They are not what you wanted them to be
They are not what you wanted them to be

Today I drank the piss
The fruits of wisdom
And touched the children of the cross
I helped them up to let them fall again

I was â did you see the star fall
Aiwass â did you see the star fall
