A slim starved body
Rises to vast extents
This wrinkled tactful skin
From the head to the tip of the toe

Impeccable in nature and appearance
Pours in everlasting seven seas
The revolting ghost stirs through salvation
Lives on and studies the living

Darkness
Anonymous
Here
Bygone
Forever and now
When will I become

Darkness devours the bones of the descendant
They forgot to call the name of the lord
As the shadow discovered them
And turned them to beings

Characters failed in words of fury
He is deep
He afflicts

The ghost is me
The ghost is me

He expects men to adopt the spirit
To cry anxiously
To mark death with a cross
To stir through salvation

Salvation
