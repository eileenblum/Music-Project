Let my hands down
They are marrowless
Disquietly they search the way
They can not lead you anymore
They can not lead you anymore

Let them starve
They want to be lead by someone else
Life line guides death
Death guides up and deeper down

Still life fades
A prostration
Feet donât bear anymore

This is what we strive for
This is our will
Will is us
Versus

It is here
It is here

It is here
Graciously it sinks
Donât leave me now
Where is all the blood
When Iâm gone

Do not deride him
Is it that you strive for
We are nothing but men
Following the shadow
