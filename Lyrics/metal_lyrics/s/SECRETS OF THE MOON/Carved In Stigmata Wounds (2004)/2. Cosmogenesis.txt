Black clouds have masked her image
Filth enjoys her beauty
Her creations
Her mysteria

Infinity
Deformity
All hail the new aeon
Cosmogenesis

Hail stagnation!

In an art form
Too painful to feel
She let us feel her hatred
We are the scum
The manifestation of destruction

For they have never given much
For they have never
Expressed what they feel
In a world enlightened by scorn
They are the ones who fear

Minor divinity
Major pride

Commando nature
Collects its final weapons
With arrogance and ignorance
...riding!
