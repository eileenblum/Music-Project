Evolution valour admission
Conjuration of the next confession
Profound and deep but spiked with pain

Like a slot burned out on silent ground
Let her remember the logic of life
Let her share the fire

I want to die in hunger
Getting thinner and thinner
Until there's nothing left of me

Life

Con(in)fluences

Satan master

Salvation

Evolution valour admission
Profound and deep but spiked with pain
