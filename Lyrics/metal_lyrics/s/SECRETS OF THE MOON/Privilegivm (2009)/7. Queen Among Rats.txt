Self abandonment
The clock stops ticking
While I grasp into the blank

Don't let your feet loose the ground
While the rats underneath are crawling on all fours

I walk your path forever
Feeling your pulse forever
Cursing your god
Carrying your ash

Queen among rats
Touching your vein
Blessing your brow
Letting you go

Queen among rats
Sighing for death
Scare off the rats
Crowning your death

Holy congregation
The time has come
Let the rivers overrun
Her time is now

Black flame aspire
As above so below
Where are her wings now?
Where are her wings?

Holy modifier
Carrier of wings
Let her fly in splendor
Wrath shall clean my world

Black flame aspire
As above so below
Where are her wings now?
Where are her wings?

The light is here
I'll let it shine
To guide you through the pitch black
To guide your way home
Don't let your feet loose the ground
When the light falls down
While the earth is bleedingâ¨(die)
