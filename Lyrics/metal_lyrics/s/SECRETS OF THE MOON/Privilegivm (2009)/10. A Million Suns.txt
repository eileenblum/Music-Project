[1st Edition Digipak CD Bonus Track]For this do we pray
Bearer of light
For this do we pray
This heart-shaped sun is thine

Behold
Water to blood
Drink from the acid chalice
Invoke the glare
Encasing my star
Enlightening the one
A million suns

Our mother was there
To separate life from death
Rex versus servus
The love of the sun
Our mother was there
Raising the child
Watching it die
Her is the sun

For this do we pray
Bearer of light
For this do we pray
This heart-shaped sun is thine

I drenched thee
I crown
So vile
So detestable

I raped hearts
I sticked it in
So real
In love

I spanked her
i raped hearts
Bleeding
Let me in

This crown
It's mine
So vile
So detestable

Don't spurn my children's legacy
For their mothers cunt was bathed in faith
Don't spurn my children's legacy
For it bears the enragement of a million suns
