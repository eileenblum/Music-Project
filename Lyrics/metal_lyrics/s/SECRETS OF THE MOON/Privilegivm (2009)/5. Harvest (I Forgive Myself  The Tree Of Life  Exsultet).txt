"I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to believe that God existsâ¨
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to think that God existsâ¨
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to define love as God â¨
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to define prayer as Godâ¨
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to define hope as Godâ¨
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to separate myself from earthâ¨
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to separate myself from creationâ¨
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to separate myself from hereâ

We did not see the serpents moving
Underneath our feet
As they laid down eggs in our wound
The promised land starts now

Demur
Privilegivm
The tree of life is burning
Climb up and catch the serpents flame
A new Bethlehem covered in filth
We will be one with them

Demur
Privilegivm
"The earth is screamingâ¨Demanding for conviction
The earth is screaming
The promised land is hereâ¨â¨
The earth is screamingâ¨Demanding for convictionâ¨
The earth is screaming
The promised land starts nowââ¨
Serpentâ¨
Redeemerâ¨
Harvestâ¨
The tree of lifeâ¨
Trembling
Predator
Servant
Of stars and light
Motherâ¨
Sinisterâ¨
Harvest â¨
The tree of life
Dead
Leavesâ¨
Crucifyâ¨
Cut down â¨
The tree of life

The universe is open
As the tree reaches the sky
And we eat from wounds and apples
Slipping from the eggs of life

They'll be with you in paradise
They'll be with you in paradise
They'll be with you in paradise
They'll be with you in paradiseâ¨â¨
Demur
Privilegivmâ¨
Realize
God abandoned you
God fucked you
We don't need him

Of stars and light

Harvest â¨
The tree of life
Dead
Leavesâ¨
Crucifyâ¨
Cut down â¨
The tree of life
