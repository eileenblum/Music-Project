Here is salvation
Between vacant walls of sleep
An thus I carry the light
From the valleys of Sodom
To the Golgotha rise

Here is perdition
In front of wailing walls
I need its stench to breathe
Fucking all its sacred holes

Sulphur
Guide me through
These temples
Pulsing through

Lord
It burns
Throughout this darkness
The tender white
In endless black
It burns the world

Lord
Let them eat glass again
Let them chew it to tiny pieces
These are the greatest of all pains

Great Father
Thy maker
High Master
Breathe Sulphur

Lord
Let me be your Lazarus
There is so much to erase
When the flames
Are reaching higher

Lord
Grand your host
Your limb
Your blood
Endow belief
There is so much to reveal

Raise black
In dormant temples
Black incense black shroud
Salvation coming
Total death
Hear their wailing
Sew their hearts
Oh holy guardian angel
Abramelin without end
For what is worth
To resurrect
To live and breathe
A thousand year from now

Lord
It burns
Throughout this darkness
The tender white
In endless black
It burns the sun

Lord
Let me suck you
Expelled faith
Let me die to live
These are the
Greatest of all pains

Great Father

Great Father
A am yours to follow
Great Father
I am your to swallow
