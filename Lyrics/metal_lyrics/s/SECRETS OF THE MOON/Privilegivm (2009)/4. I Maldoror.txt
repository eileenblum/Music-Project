Come sinners
Begotten accomplished
So I delineate my atrocity
I rise upon your thronesâ¨
I

Come kings and queens
I received life like a wound
When did you see that all once abloom
Withered under my blessed wings

Come whore and punter
Punisher and slave
I stuck you mug way to rude
Into Pandora's box

I Maldoror
My name is not important
Black diamond shine on me
I Maldoror
View this gash
This dirty bastard
Kissing all your wrinkled feet

"I am the witness of my story
Judge and executioner
Through blood and flesh i crown my work
I never wanted it to dieâ¨
Four winged phoenix
Seven winged Lucifer
Seven winged phoenix
Four winged Lucifer"

I Maldoror
My name is not important
Black diamond shine on me

"There is no turning back
This life is so amazing
Have I told you lately that all you ever loved is dead?
Four winged Lucifer
Seven winged phoenix
I had a dream that all you ever loved is set aflame
Four winged phoenix
Seven winged Lucifer
Four winged phoenix
Seven winged Lucifer"â¨
