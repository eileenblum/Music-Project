These are the days of our lives
And into your hands
We commit our shit
Forgive them father
For they know not what they do

Solemn master
These temples are closed
What have I done to this world
While you're sucking cocks
In the gardens of delight

Darkness
Silent death

Trampling and spurring
Trough gardens grow numb

Burn these temples
Heaven cries out
This way at least
God will know your name

Darkness
Silent death
Discharge
Heaven wept

Solemn accuser
Black kingdom enchained
Soil the sacrosanct
Scum of the earth
God ain't watching you

Darkness
Silent death
For they know not

These are the days or our lives
And into your hands
We commit our shit
Forgive them father
For they know not what they do
