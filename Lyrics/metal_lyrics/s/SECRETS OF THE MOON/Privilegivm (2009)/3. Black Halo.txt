No way back
No matter what ascends
Beneath me
I am crawling back to start
A million plagues have drained me
Like a cross
Made of a thousand abors
It hits my flesh it rages me
Shine on through pestilence
Through torture by filth

Futile reverence
Debris of flesh and bone
I am the order
That carries your death
Defeat upon the Nihil
For I am

Deaf
Invincible
Blind
Dog

This Black Halo
Deify and destroy
Your kingdom come

This Black Halo
Light shall pass my world
In a kingdom gone

This Black Halo
Pretender to the throne

Mary where is fortitude
Let me puke on you
Let me choke the shit
Out of you
Your will be done
On earth as in heaven

Your kingdom come
Your kingdom come
My kingdom come
Our kingdom come

Lucifer
This darkness
Casts my light
Behold
The Unnamed rises
Welcome
The light in light
With seven trumpets
Seven snakes
Seven curtains
Seven bells
Seven angels
Kiss in shame
Seven beasts
For I am
