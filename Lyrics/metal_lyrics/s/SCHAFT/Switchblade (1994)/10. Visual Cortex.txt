Alive in the desert heat, the sun holds her heart
As it drains every breath and tears limbs apart

And no one to know
And no one to see (???)
And no one to hear
That final ghostly cry

Alive in the desert heat, the sun holds her heart
As it drains every breath and tears limbs apart

As night lays its shroud
She lies down to wait
And the moon cools her bones
As it seals her fate

And no one to know
And no one to see (???)
And no one to hear
That final ghostly cry
