With head cut open
I want to feed on what flows out from you...
Have you never felt the same?
I want to take you in through the mouth
Your cells
Your blood vessels
Your everything
Your memory
Your lifeblood itself

With head torn open
I want to drink on what flows out from you...
I have often felt this way
I want to make you mine completely
Your memory
Your life
Your everything
Your love
And the very core of you
The dream evaporates
Once more my usual self
Once more your usual self
Another day begins
Another uneventful day
