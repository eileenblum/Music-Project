He comes to me
The man with no face
A hero in a mask of raw flesh
He is a simple genius
Flower blood cells
The hero inside my brain

Oh, the burning sands, the greasy rope
Electric hands, my broken hope
My mind machine
I feel my stomach churn
[Bathsheba burns]
The blood red rain will stain your name
Behold the Lord of Pain

He speaks, I cannot hear
But I understand
He plugs me into his socket
I slip into his brain
Flower blood cells
The hero inside my brain

Yours is the mark
One hopeless dream
And comes your guilt
This sordid stream
My mind machine
I feel my stomach churn
[Bathsheba burns]
The blood red rain will stain your name
Behold the Lord of Pain

He comes to me
The man with no face
A hero in a mask of raw flesh
He is a simple genius
Flower blood cells
The hero inside my brain

Oh, the burning sands, the greasy rope
Electric hands, my broken hope
My mind machine
I feel my stomach churn
[Bathsheba burns]
The blood red rain will stain your name
Behold the Lord of Pain!
