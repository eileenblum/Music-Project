I could have got through anytime
Cold, lonely puritan
What are you fighting for?
It's not my security
It's just an old war
Not even a cold war

Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Just say it in broken English
Just say it in broken English

Lose your father, your husband
Your mother, your children
What are you fighting for?
It's not my reality
It's just an old war
It's not even a cold war

Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Just say it in broken English
Just say it in broken English

What are you fighting for?

I could have got through anytime
Cold, lonely puritan
What are you fighting for?
It's not my security
It's just an old war
It's not even a cold war

Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Just say it in broken English
Just say it in broken English

What are you fighting for?
