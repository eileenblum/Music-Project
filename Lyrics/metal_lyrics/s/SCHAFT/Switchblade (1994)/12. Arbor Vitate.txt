This is the good for my belief
This is the gun for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing
One is for fun... fun... FUN!

POW POW!
Easy come
POW POW POW!
Easy go
POW POW!
Easy come
POW POW POW!
Easy go
This is the good for my belief
This is the bullet for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing
One is for fun

I am the town that loves to lie
That shame passed by
This is the city where the windows weep
The only answer to my conceit
My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
This is the good for my belief
This is the bullet for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing
One is for fun

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I could kill someone tonight
Slip and slide to the hurt and high
Run around with a switchblade
Come with you in the morning light

My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight

This finger itches for the spike and soon
In this city where you weep
Into the womb that is your only tomb

My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight

You are the one I recognize
But in your warmth I could realize
I am the sum of all I despise
But I soon start to feel... ALIVE!

This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing
One is for fun
My god is good, my god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
