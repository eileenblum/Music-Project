Once, twice, sometimes thrice
I came for you with a Stanley knife
Once, twice
With a Stanley knife
Nicely, nicely, come on, excite me
I wanna feel your metal slice me
Feel, defile, oh so dumb
I see you hurt, now here I come
I'm silent, I'm violent
Lie still while I have my will
I'm soon hot, soon cold
A mismarriage of velvet, how I felt it

My skin aflame, my mind is lame
You twist this knot and feed my pain
My skin aflame, my mind is lame
You twist this knot and feed my pain
Slice, slice, here comes the knife
Slice, slice, here comes the knife
My skin aflame, my mind is lame
You twist this knot and feed my pain
Feed the fire on my funeral pyre

Your secret skin will spell my name
Your secret skin will shelter me
Your secret skin will smell of me
Your secret skin will hide this shame

You're the pearl, I'm the pain
You're the lesion, I'm the lesson
I hear a great big noise inside my head
A squinting eye, a squeezing finger
Bide the hurts with a chink of lead
There's a fear-filled blood red sea in my mind
A fount of lies is my legacy
Gimme the space and I'll show you the pace
You're the fish, I'm the foul meat in the middle
Turn up the fire, put the flesh on the griddle
You're the place that holds me in its spell
That holds me like the native place
To you I talk, walk, and stalk
The seaboard secret strikes the line
The land I burn is all that's mine
Burn your lover
Burn your shrine

Your secret skin will spell my name
Your secret skin will shelter me
Your secret skin will smell of me
Your secret skin will hide this shame

Fill my cup and bide my time
I'm the silent cyclone, the silent medicine
This killin' is fillin' my cup to the brim
You obey while I betray
I taste and die, heave and cry
Yearn for one more reddened eye
The tree, the flower, and the seed
Will separate and dry and bleed
