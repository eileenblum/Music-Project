I saw the local cable company
They came and dug up the road
They cut the roots and killed the tree
To give me information overload
They laid an optical vein with a heart of glass
So the rich infuse, but the poor are bypassed

No need to qualify distinction
Of any other creature if alive or in extinction
Somebody gifted with a scanner and a keypad
Can rustle up an animal in cyberspace and time dad
Can it be really real as Takarazuka?
A message that is subtle as a kiss from a bazooka
Come into the water, don't be scared of a verruca
Erase that from your mind, the bottom line is filthy lucre

They're going to give you information
They want to put in formation
Is it a cause for celebration?
A non-creative recreation?

If you're virtually hungry, eat a virtual meal
If you're virtually sick, then do you virtually heal?
With a virtual brain, invent a virtual wheel
You're a virtual slave, but the kneeling is real

We're going for a swim in someone else's stream of consciousness and I hope that we don't drown...

A change of perception
Under pain of deception
Latest stab into modernity
Chew the flavour of eternity
How does anybody else feel?
Who can tell me what's the real deal?
Will the glove and goggle free you?
Or put your consciousness in curfew?

No need to answer any question
The mass of information giving mental indigestion
Somebody lacking Internet without a modem
Is waiting for the chance of overrating what you show them
Can it be as really real as waking in a fever?
Asleep inside a dream that's advertising Unilever?
Come into the universe of corporate dementia
Where everybody swaps their teeth for permanent indenture
