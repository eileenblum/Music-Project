So why can I not smile now?
Unveil my eyes for beautiful dawning light!
Undress myself, all armour and shields!
Laying down my weapons to never need them again...

[chorus:]
Then free to throw down that mask
That mask of disgust

Thus it goes on and on and on
This useless reasoning of a meaning
So it's all gone it's gone, forever gone!
Who has the answer to "why?"
This riddle of life and death?

But God is not on my side anymore
All I ever earned is enemies in life

[chorus]

And then the voice is muted
Nothing and none - all in the end

When the question is answered
There is nothing but silence
And the voice is mute

[chorus]
