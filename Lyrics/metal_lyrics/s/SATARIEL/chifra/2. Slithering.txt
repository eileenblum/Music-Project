Hold on tight
There is no sunrise for us
Accept and come with me
Don't even try
The bother is all too great
For your mistake

[chorus:]
To be the one
The serpent in your spine
To lead them down
To worlds of cosmic cold
To be the one
Descended from ahigh
The one to make them blind

Care no more
For the ones that you saw fall
They never picked you up
It's OK to cry
The last thing you will do
As human

[chorus]

Head on forth
Who cares for delight
In this night
On this feast

[chorus]

Hold on tight
There is no sunrise for us
Accept and come with me
It's OK to cry
The last thing you will do
As human
