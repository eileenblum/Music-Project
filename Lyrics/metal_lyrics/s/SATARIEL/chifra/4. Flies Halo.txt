This place never looked so grim
The silence is so threatening
One can almost hear the continents move
In this hour so late

[prechorus:]
We are walking
Walking and walking in circles
With our hearts torn
With our hearts and our souls in our hands

[chorus]:

We are walking in circles
With our hearts in our hands
No hunger for nothing
Our souls fled away

[prechorus]
[chorus]

Flies halo over our heads
We have stopped breathing
Through all black windows stare
With last minutes to go

Till aeons go to ends
To perpetual cold night

[prechorus]
[chorus 3x]
