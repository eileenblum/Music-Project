Imagine to see it all burn down
Picture a worlds downfall
And how the weaklings would cry and beg
As war shatters the fragile safety of civilization 
Civilization!

[CHORUS:]
They're sheep to be slain
They're sheep...

The emanations of destruction unfolded
The wrath of Apophis the bane over it all 
The worthless people to be butchered
No tears for the lives of them running short

They're nothing but sheep to be slain 
They're nothing but sheep

The emanations of destruction unfolded
The wrath of Apophis the bane over it all 
The worthless people to be butchered
No tears for the lives of them running short

[CHORUS:]
They're sheep to be slain
They're sheep...

Hate breeds the magick strong
As the visionless flocks are unknowing 
There's no place left for these lives no more Only the herds there shall be

They're nothing but sheep to be slain 
They're nothing but sheep
