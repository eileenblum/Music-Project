The ancient blood runs in my veins,
and magick sleeps in my heart
For I am the god of the five spirits,
and I am of the blood of Kingu

I am the ruler of the serpent Kel
I am the lord of AWKACRP - the two-faced
I am the son set by the seed of Astaroth
I am the spawn from the womb of Hecate

I rule by Taphthartharath in cosmos,
and I explore it to feed this new mind in me I open it's eyes to watch and learn,
as I wander the eternal night of Kliffoth

The ancient blood runs in my veins,
and magick sleeps in my heart
For I am the god of the five spirits,
and I am of the blood of Kingu

Treasures of Dis I win
The love of Ishtar of Venus is mine
The light of Uddu lets me see
The Flesh of Tiamat reveils it's secrets for me

Tiriel of Nebo I am, for I am Zeez - the traveller of Bemm
Fot I am Nema-Tous, I am them all;
I am the first eye of the lord Phosphorus!
