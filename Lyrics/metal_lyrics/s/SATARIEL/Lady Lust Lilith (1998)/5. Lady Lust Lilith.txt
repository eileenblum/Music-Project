Soft skin - on this beautiful vicious lady
Must in - 'cause she keeps calling me till crazy

[CHORUS:]
Lady Lust Lilith
Lady of Luna

O, she's the dark side of the moon, 
the mother of demonic spawn
This night I await her coming soon, 
Oh, how shall I see another dawn

For her my serpens uncoil
Like hell her inside boils

O, you great lday of the blackened treasurous soil let your demon-daughters desires joy
So come, enter my dream and I'll enter yours -
you'll be my succubus and I'll be your incubus

Lady Lust Lilith
Lady of Luna

The aversity of Yesod, will you come and show me,
and let me see the dreaming Diana?
So come woman, be as much of a goddess that you can,
then I'll be the fire between your thighs...

For her my serpens uncoil
Like hell her inside boils

MARAG AMA LILITH
RIMOG SAMALO NAAMAH

[CHORUS:]
Lady Lust Lilith 
Lady of Luna
