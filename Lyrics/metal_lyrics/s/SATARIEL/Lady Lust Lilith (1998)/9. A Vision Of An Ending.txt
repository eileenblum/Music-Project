I haven't gone far, still i know it's all too far 
My salvation is lost, rejected somewhere back there

For a moment I stop to look back
All I see is the paths I could have chosen
In yesterday my history is written
And in yesterday the history ends

I've passed all choices and possibilities so quick
For here on the way heads down to hell To hell!

[CHORUS:]
This for sure is the path of Kliffoth This is where all hope was reaped
This is where illusions and dreams died
This is where the mirrors all cracked

It claimed my soul a long time ago
And soon it will take my life too, something tells

A nightmare filled with pain is all that remain
A shadow in me now reign, driving me insane

Before I close my eyes to never see again
A question awakes in me, demanding an answer;
May this be nothing but yet another dream?
May this be nothing but yet another dream?!

This for sure is the path of Kliffoth
This is where all hope was reaped
This is where illusions and dreams died This is where the mirrors all cracked

I awake, but it gives me no answer
Still I do not know whether I'm dead or alive 
... Dead or alive?!
