It is hidden in darkness now
It lost the glow as time went by
And now they know it is all over
I cannot say that we did wrong
After that they would call on us
In the search for a perfect beast
We would come, then take their wishes
Roped theirs necks and we saw them through

In true faith
And untamed strength

No one ever listened to us
This dream was nothing but a lie

Of the threats they could not shun
Erasing all that was left behind
And when they could not hold on no more
I would not harm and no one would die
So sharp, unavoidable
For years it spoke inside of them
My contempt for what they turned
It knew no ends

It is started all over again
Though you just don't know it yet
This is the cold time of the giants
And you gonna cut yourself
We find the scent first, then the way
All is done while you are sleeping
Cause you know it is all too late
And you cut yourself bad

In true faith
And untamed strength

No one ever listened to us
This dream was nothing but a lie

I'm all the terror and all the dread
And my actions will loudly speak
To destroy all in your might
Bit by bit, in heavens, on earth
Cannot continue this false peace
We have grown too far apart
Roars from the blackest abyss
Now march for war

When there were no allies to be found
And the enemies were surrounding you
It gave no reason to love you
I became this bloody beast

No one ever listened to us
This dream was nothing but a lie
