I never knew it before
Now it has changed
In the greater room here
The cosmos expands now
I never knew you before
Now I can see you clear
Deep inside my head
Where demons did dwell

This faith must have its fair share of doubt
If it has none, then be so sure - it is really not faith at all

Under a yellow sick moon
In my head where demons did dwell
Under a yellow sick moon
Within myself where demons did dwell

...the demons are gone

The things I carried in me
Corrupted the days
Shattered and battered myself
In nightmares and void
Provoked in a single thought
It could tear you apart
Whoever falls to that depth
To them with no names

Why would they not
Just kill us all
Darkness canât be contained
Nor portioned still sane
Inside of your soul
By rivers of blood
I will place no blame
On our feeble doubts

This faith must have its fair share of doubt
If it has none, then be so sure - it is really not faith at all

Under a yellow sick moon
In my heart all the demons they slept
Under a yellow sick moon
On my soul cold fingers were kept

The demons are gone!

Seems like something was missing
Something that left long ago
So when the fear starts to scare
It won`t let you go
And if the gods would allow
To never forget nor forgive
These old demons of man
Cursed damned doubts

This faith must have its fair share of doubt
If it has none, then be so sure - it is really not faith at all

Under a yellow sick moon
In my head where demons did dwell
Under a yellow sick moon
Within myself where demons did dwell
Under a yellow sick moon
For my mind may be freed of that hell
Under a yellow sick moon
All my torments were sealed in a shell

The demons are goneâ¦
