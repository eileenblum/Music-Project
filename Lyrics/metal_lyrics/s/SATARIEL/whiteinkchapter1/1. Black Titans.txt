Is it true what they say
To save ourselves you must be removed
It is the end of this damned world
When the darkness rises in our eyes
We come in silence and our weapons are drawn

We were trialed and tested
Patience pulled and stretched far too long
You know it must end - there is no time for words no more
You pushed us over the edge - we are now closing in on you

We come as wolves

And we will not go away
Until someone has bled
And we cannot leave this way
Til they are all dead

Here comes the hellfire
Weâll silence their cries
The walls fall down
A thousand hammers pound

The gun to your own head
We would not shed the slightest tear
But now the call to act, your gun is directed against us all
Only one thing that remains for us to do

And we will not go away
Until someone has bled
And we cannot leave this way
Til they are all dead

Here comes the hellfire
Weâll silence their cries
The walls fall down
A thousand hammers pound

Burning runes - now they scream
So that soon none can hear a thing
Rattling bones - there they fall
So they cannot be revoked - or undone

You know it must end - there is no time for words no more
You pushed us over the edge - we are now closing in on you

We come as wolves

And we will not go away
Until someone has bled
And we cannot leave this way
Til they are all dead

Here comes the hellfire
We'll silence their cries
The walls fall down
A thousand hammers pound
