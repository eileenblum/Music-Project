Coffin gateways are revealed
Through the holes of my scull
With the creeps and the worms
Crawl down deep the muddy earth

Here at times I feel my Gods presence
I am wrapped with godfear when near Him
By birth bound to Him by carnal flesh
If I would utter His name, beware

[Pre-chorus:]
By magick time and space will bend
For my rotten bones to heal and mend

[CHORUS:]
The king of death opened my eyes
Once again I moved in this flesh
Mortality missed its bite upon me
Only now through death I am truly free

The osmosis of life is but my toy
Vomit vermin and spite upon you all
By this world I cried and I died
I return in zombiewalk to stalk

[Pre-chorus]

[CHORUS]

[Repeat verse 1]

[Pre-chorus]

[CHORUS]
