Holding a fire and a thousand of sparks
An angel so forgetful of the manners thereof
Yearning to cannibalise a wicked world
Oh I swear, I hear him coming closer

Heed no longer but uncoil your spine
No one is damned in the love of our black titan
The promise of he who damns but your foe
Redemption is easy, redemption is cheap

Visionarie
Idolater
Occultist
Satanist
Agitator
and seer
Provocateur
Instigator

Their wishes do come true
The next evolution of woman and man still stand
The spiritually pitch black few
Carnivores ready to rule and tear their land

The righteous and definable tremble and shiver
As even the sun flicker at his breath
The beast rages on our gloomed globe
And mares seem to haunt life to exhaustion

Their wishes do come true
The next evolution of woman and man still stand
The spiritually pitch black few
Carnivores ready to rule and tear their land
