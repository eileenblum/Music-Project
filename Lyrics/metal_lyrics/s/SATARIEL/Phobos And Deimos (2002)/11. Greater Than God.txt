We are greater than God
We are greater than other people
We are not like those from God
We hate other people by right

An awful spawn we may seem
But we're truly blessed with beauty and grace
I excuse me not
For my blood values higher than yours

[CHORUS x2]
We want it all, and deserve even more
More real than God, so worship then rather us

[Repeat verse 1]

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
