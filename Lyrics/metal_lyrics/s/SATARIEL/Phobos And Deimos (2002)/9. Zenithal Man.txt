The rendevouz of triumphs
A vessel sprung open
And like bacteria the Genii spread out

[Pre-chorus:]
No longer part of mankind
Much stronger in heart and mind

[CHORUS:]
Seeing the lotus in bloom
As wings start to out grow
My flesh meets its doom
In a halo of glow

Vagabond a grand cosmos
Watching angels in hybris
Shaming the unpresent god
Shaming the unpresent god

[Pre-chorus]

[CHORUS]

In a hellward spiral, yet ascending
I A O
Beneath the surface, yet above yee all
I A O

[Repeat verse 1]

[Pre-chorus]

[CHORUS x2]
