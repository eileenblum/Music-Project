The vision pours of purple and red
And there she lay, bleeding in her bed
No regrets or prayers in her head
But she wonders what she now has fed

[Pre-chorus:]
Godfearing she loved her cross
A soul enwrapped with light
But flesh can be a demanding spirit
Bringing her down on all four

[CHORUS:]
In this holy trinity
Is she damned or is she free
In this holy trinity
Is she damned or free

And God he roars "Oh, you misled"
As she forgot all oaths unto him said
Through the flesh the Devil she wed
Is now her soul refused and dead

She ravishes herself, and forgets all about Heaven
She moans with God above, and Satan below

[Repeat verse 1]

[Pre-chorus]

[CHORUS x2]
