The world comes down on us
Strangling you speechless
And what you see can't be understood
We are dying fast, nothing will last

Bruised and beaten badly
Swollen, numb and blue
We shall kill ourselves
For we are an expandable breed

[CHORUS:]
Oh, stranger world
You are a dangers world
Oh, stranger world
I don't know you now

There's a breech in our covenant
For we found heaven to be empty
God was a split atom
We are left to die

We must kill ourselves
For we turned a sickened breed

[CHORUS]

The world is my enemy
Cleanse the universe from our spinning rock
We are a plague raging senseless
Thus I proclaim myself nemesis

[Repeat verse 1]

Bruised and beaten badly
Swollen, numb and blue
We do kill ourselves
Oh, what a blessed relief

[CHORUS]
