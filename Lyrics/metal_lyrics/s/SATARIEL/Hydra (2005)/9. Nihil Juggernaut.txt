[Lyrics: PÃ¤r Johansson]

Do I quest to choose the ending of life
Go I by the stars in my microcosmos

I believe in me
The I and You
I believe in Will
The atoms of God

Are we running downstairs
With gravity upside down

I believe in me
The I and You
I believe in Will
The atoms of God

When I kill either You or I
Will it hurricane, will it starve the world

When I make love to them
Am I then the dashboard of gods
Or is hope of change
But a sweet illusion

If I change, do I still remain no different
Twisting and burning in the House of Gods
Will they be set ablaze or remain their silent gaze
Is the stage already set for the labyrinth-running rat

I believe in me
The I and You
I believe in Will
The atoms of God
