[Lyrics: PÃ¤r Johansson]

When you beg and pray
Crawling and slithering in mud and clay
And you cry blood when you say
Why, where did I from thee stray

Do not stand alone
Come join our ranks

Surely no god is there for you
The universe is empty all through
For this riddle you lack a clue
In the fall there is nothing you can do

God seems to have left us
The world is ours thus

So rise up, o ye lost ones
As one we will claw the clouds
Rise up, the forsaken and dethroned
A legion wronged, to claw the clouds

When you beg and pray
Crawling and slithering in mud and clay
And you cry blood when you say
Why, where did I from thee stray

God seems to have left us
The world is ours thus

So rise up, o ye lost ones
As one we will claw the clouds
Rise up, the forsaken and dethroned
A legion wronged, to claw the clouds
