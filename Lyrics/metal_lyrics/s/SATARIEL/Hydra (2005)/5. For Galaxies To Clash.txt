[Lyrics: PÃ¤r Johansson]

In the minor of deeds
In the small gesture rather than the gods` pose
In the small choices
Not seen in those clad in grandeur

This is where our greatest battles either be won or lost
For as gods' we are, we do gods deeds by our every breath

For as gods we are willed to be
Lest ye reject a kingdom for a hell

Rise the crown on a straight back
See the lotus unfold for you
You may be amongst us
But never against us

We bring no salvation or heaven with us now
Only a choice of will, being not enemies, nor allies

For as gods we are willed to be
Lest ye reject a kingdom for a hell

This is where our greatest battles either be won or lost
For as gods we are, we do gods' deeds by our every breath

For as gods we are willed to be
Lest ye reject a kingdom for a hell
