[Lyrics: PÃ¤r Johansson]

There ain't no love in this heart
No love in this chest of cramp
Cramping caused by lack of breath

The horror of being alive in a world dead
The pain of all love turned into losses

When surrendering everything
Certain no god ever heard your prayers
A line was crossed

The horror of being alive in a world dead
The pain of all love turned into losses

Satan heard you well
He'll make a heaven out of your hell
One lone star to guide that path
The clandestine for but a few

The horror of being alive in a world dead
The pain of all love turned into losses


Thanks to fadman0 for correcting track #5 title.
