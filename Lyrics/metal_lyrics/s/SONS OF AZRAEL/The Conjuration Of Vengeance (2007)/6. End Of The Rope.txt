The man whom you knew before
Is just not here anymore
He has become imprisoned in his own mind
If things keep going this way
He'll surely wither away
He has become a shadow of his former self
He cannot wake up from this nightmare
An empty shell fixed beyond repair
The man whom you knew before
Lives out his life on the floor
He has become a blueprint of deaths design
There is no life in him now
No chance of coming around
He has become a walking corpse
Consulting his faith and finding no hope
His solution begins at the end of the rope
Take another it will numb the pain
Comatose another day just give up
There's no reason to stay
Suicide the only way
Dead
Dead inside
Behind his eyes there's nothing left
Nevermore, this is your life
Nevermore, I'm begging you
Nevermore, please wake up
Now
