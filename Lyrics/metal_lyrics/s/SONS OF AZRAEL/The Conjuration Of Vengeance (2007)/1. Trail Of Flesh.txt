Slave no more
When I needed you most
And you were all I had
You prepared a noose
And left me for dead
You sucked my veins dry
And raped me of pride
Now I am coming
For what is mine
For what is mine
This is 
This is 
This is my my revenge
You're a still life target
Stained with blood
Too late for apologies
After all the pain after I was betrayed
This will end with an axe in your face
And your bones in the dirt
Beg for mercy down on your knees
No sympathy
This will end with you as the disgrace
As you have run out of time
Beg for mercy down on your knees
No empathy
Plead with me and the empty sky
No sympathy
While I'm carving out your eyes
No apologies
You can run but you cant hide
For you will die tonight
Now I am coming
For what is mine
Your life
