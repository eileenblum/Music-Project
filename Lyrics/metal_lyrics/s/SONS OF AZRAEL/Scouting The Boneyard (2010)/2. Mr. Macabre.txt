You'd better be on your best behavior, or stay out of sight.
In the halls of this hospital, someone roams at night.
Late at night he comes, he comes into your room.
He'll perform his surgeries, and you'll meet your doom.

Better hope he doesn't choose you, pray to your god.
There's no chance you'll ever survive a visit from Mr. Macabre.
They call him Mr. Macabre.

He might remove your organs, or just take off your head.
If you fall asleep, you may wake up dead.
If you see him coming, you've sealed your fate.
He wants to taste your blood, and needs to operate.

He could take out your eyes with a turn of his wrist.
He could tear off your limbs or gut you like a fish.
He could take off your skin and wear it as his coat.
He could break all your bones or just slit your throat.

Better hope he doesn't choose you, pray to your god.
There's no chance you'll ever survive a visit from Mr. Macabre.
Mr. Macabre!
Better hope he doesn't choose you.
