I am god, god of my world.
This life is all up to me.
I donât need what you think is right.
I donât want your beliefs.
Keep your distance, keep your ways.
Your religion has nothing to say

Fuel this hatred, feel this wrath.
I follow the left hand path.
Keep your savior, king of shit.
He means nothing to me.
Keep your ignorance, your abstinence.
I would rather be free.

Live your life inside your head.
Praise a god, one that is dead.
Don't tell me I need to be saved.
I've fallen from grace.
Donât tell me I need a savior.
Donât tell me I need to be.

I am god, god of my world.
This life is all up to me.
I donât need what you think is right.
I donât want your beliefs.

I spit, at the corpse, the corpse of Christ.

There's no more you can say, you're already dead anyway!

Keep your savior, king of shit.
He means nothing to me.
Keep your ignorance, your abstinence.
I would rather be free.

Live your life inside your head.
Praise a god, one that is dead.
Don't tell me I need to be saved.
I've fallen from grace.

I am god, god of my world.
This life is all up to me.
I donât need what you think is right.
I donât want your beliefs.
Keep your distance, keep your ways.
Your religion has nothing to say

Fuel this hatred, feel this wrath.
I follow the left hand path.
