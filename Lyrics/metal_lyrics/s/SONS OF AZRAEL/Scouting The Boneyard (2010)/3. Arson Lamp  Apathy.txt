Without care for the cost or lives to be lost.
You lead us to a new low.
One that stains our memories and burns in our souls.

How can you close your eyes to fall asleep at night?
After poisoning us and ignoring our rights.

You won't be held responsible in a world that isnât fair.
You won't be held accountable for the damage we have to repair.

How can you shut your eyes to fall asleep at night?
Knowing what you know in your mind? In your time?
How can you ignore the fact that you cant take this back?
Those in need of help you choose to avoid, and all of the lives you helped to destroy.

Apathy doesnât work for me.

Youâll never wash off the blood on your hands.
Youâll never dry up the blood in the sand.
Youâll never undo your tragedy.
Youâll never forget your apathy.

Apathy won't work for me.
