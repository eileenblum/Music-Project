As soon as I tasted you, you swam in my blood.
Your touch was beautiful.
A numbing flood.
Yet now ill pay, for you were a mistake.
Unless I bury you, I can dig my own grave.

Its so deceiving.
I kept believing.
Until receiving.
This suffering that transforms me.

As I decompose, your strength only grows.
In conclusion, youâll never know.
To forever nest me in your control.

Once you had held me, you hollowed me out.
No longer a man, but a shadow of doubt.
The light on this test has shown me what's best.
To be rid of you, and lay you to rest.

Its so deceiving.
I kept believing.
Until receiving.
This suffering that transforms me.

Internally.
Profusely bleeding.
Thought to be clever, but you can never.. Kill me!

As I decompose, your strength only grows.
In conclusion, youâll never know.
To forever nest me in your control.

Painful as though this may be,
I can see what has happened to me.
Becoming the man I used to be.

After I'm through with you.
Bruised, bloodied, and alone.
Where the road leads, only time will know.
I'll keep walking, and hope to find home.
