Amidst the endless darkness and gloom, my eyes lock with her smile across the room.
The light it creates, is blinding to me.
Reflection of her fangs, is all I can see.

In her bite, I cant feel an ounce of pain.
I'm paralyzed, like the heroin hold on a numb vein.

Her leather wings, they seem to cover me.
They form a shield, and prevent me to bleed!

When she speaks I hear a ghoulish symphony!
It brings new life to this body of atrophy!


Once I was poisoned.
She nearly watched me die.
Through her bloody kisses, I am revived!

In her eyes, I can see this moment, frozen in time.
As well as the world we burned and left behind.

When she speaks I hear a ghoulish symphony!
It brings new life to this body of atrophy!

She takes me away, to a better place.
The glow in her eyes shows me the way.
We rise from the black, to a brand new day.

She takes my hand.
We walk away from the world as it burns.
Hand in hand we leave it behind.
She smiles at me and I look in her eyes.
I'm lost in this moment.
Frozen in time.
