Grieving mother sits beside her childâs casket.
Her little boy hacked up with a hatchet.
This pain she almost couldnât bare.
Doesnât this world seems so unfair?
How could this be?
An innocent child taken away, so easily!

A preacher man in your town, likes to dress up like a clown.
Invite all the kiddies in for a snack.
A shot of salvation in the ass!
He made them promise to never tell, or god would send them all to hell.
This is common all across the world.
Maybe your god likes little boys and girls!

If the preacher is gods example, this must be the reason for all these innocent victims
Fresh meat for holy semen!
While your children ascend to heaven and you cry for a while.
The pearly gates are wide open for the king of the pedophiles!

I have a simple solution, a justified execution, for all of you.
Maybe a bullet or six.
For god himself to suck.
To give him one last fix.
The time is coming, for us to go hunting!
Say a prayer or two!
