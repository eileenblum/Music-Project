Welcome to our world.
A godless world that you are lost in.
Let me take you on a tour of a world overshadowed by sin.

Welcome to your worst nightmare.
A world where your god doesn't care.
You may not think it's true, but he's abandoned you.

Forget your god because he has forgotten you.
Look within yourself to begin to find something true.

Forget all of the prophecies, theyâre nothing but lies.
Theyâre stories that were made up to keep you in line.
The good book is a fallacy that controls your life.
Take a good look around and open your eyes.
You need to face the fact, your god is never coming back.
Never coming back.

The world we live in, could bring you to your knees even if you beg and plead.
In the big picture you're only a number, no matter what you believe.

Forget all of the prophecies, theyâre nothing but lies.
Theyâre stories that were made up to keep you in line.
Your god has left you here alone.
WELCOME TO THE WORLD.
