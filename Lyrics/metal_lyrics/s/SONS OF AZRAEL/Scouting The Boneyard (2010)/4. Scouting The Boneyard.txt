Scouting the bone-yard,
Under cover of darkness.
I'm alone in a cloud of fog,
Lit by the moon.
Tonight I have a plan to exhume,
Those at rest.
To search for new treasures,
Within their tombs.

Armed with a shovel,
I begin to dig.
Now to have her casket,
Remove the lid...
Inside is a young girl,
Her corpse is fresh.
Carefully remove her,
I will bring her home,
So we can be alone.

Now back in the house,
I get her to bed,
No one to disturb us,
Everyone is dead.

I spray her with perfume,
To help mask the smell.
No matter what I do,
I know she'll never tell.

In her lifeless eyes...
She seems to say...
She loves me too...
In her own way.

Tonight I found her...

Now back in the house,

To help mask the smell.
No matter what I do ,
I know she'll never tell...

I know she'll never tell...
I know she'll never tell
Because they never do...
