As I stepped out of humanity
And into the ends of a dying Race
Staring down at My lifeless Corpse
I stood with scorn
Peering into the Face
Of Death's triple-edged Sword
Gearing down for retaliation
Once above, and now Below
Unrelenting skies
Whose heartbeats were maintained by the passing
Of their feeble screams and cries

And as always with Chainsaw Teeth
I dismembered the tree's fallen rotten Hell
To eternal Death's expiration
Dating back
To a Bleeding Necrorealm
And My Many Deaths before
That waxed and waned when the stars maligned
Into the Shadows of My wicked Mind
As My Blade stuck in god
A Nashmiron unleashed Her nightly Wings
Spreading Her deadly plague... to all!

Burnt as Fire, but as cold as Ice
As My Master's Wings in Nine
Summoned Euroclydon's icy Winds
Unto the Depths in Gloom
Through the clear and silent sky above
His tempest Gusts have roamed
Carrying Christian prayers, pleas, and hymns
Towards the unconditional Home of Hate

"Earthly hordes pledge their lives to me
Calling to their murdered lord
Darkness sat now on the throne, I claimed
As his throat upon My Sword
Immortal Death is My blessing
Loyal to those loyal to My Reign
Unbeknownst that their unpious deeds
Assures them a Baptism in Flame."

Charred with Ash
With their lives removed towards My Pantheon beneath
Staring down the wicked Jaws of Styx
Crushed by its Infernal Demon Teeth

By the power of Death and his shining Mutant Scythes
I have worshipped Him in the absence of life
Beneath unrelenting skies

Bearing down
On its essence
And attraction towards me
In becoming
An Electromagnetic Satanic Astronaut

"Earthly hordes pledge their lives to me
Calling to their murdered lord
Darkness sat now on the throne, I claimed
As his throat upon My Sword."

As I stepped into humanity
And towards a lowering of Infernal Hell
Becoming one with life isn't a swim through Styx
Thus My reasoning to sell
My Soul's pitious being
To the Lord below the Worlds and Stars combined
So that I may reconvene
With god's empty throne
As I did that Night
So many lives ago
In the only existence
I have known

With a vorpal slash and benighted Wings
Of My inner God's Monologue
Having attested to My coming Deaths
I commenced to-DEATHSAW
My jugulars in three
Spewing forth the Rivers lost in Doom
As My Sword became one, with me
In a shallow Reaver's Tomb
My Body lain in quite an Earthly Hole
As I initiated My Black Soul

"I was there at the end of all.
Foreseeing it in centuries gone.
Draining time as did (I) the oceans
In My Bloody Chalice Earth
Immortal Death is My blessing
Loyal to those loyal to My Reign
Unbeknownst that their unpious deeds
Assures them a Baptism in Flame."

Peering into Midnight's Desolation
I heard humanity's scream
Asking for their dear god's help
I ignored their calls and calls to Me

Gazing into Dark Unknown Rivers
I smelled the Smell of rotting Flesh
There I sensed one final life
That I gave and now can take
