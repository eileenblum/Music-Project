Property, property, property, the things I won are owning me
Energy, energy, en-ergy, my greatest ideas are haunting me
I know the leash is getting shorter
And Iâm on the wrong end
But Iâve never heard music
As loud as in my head
Iâve got visits from the king of pop
The kings of punk and the king of pain
The price of crowns is going down
Weâll all be king someday
Iâll be the self proclaimed king of keeping bad company
Good thing my rock and roll friends got nowhere to be
