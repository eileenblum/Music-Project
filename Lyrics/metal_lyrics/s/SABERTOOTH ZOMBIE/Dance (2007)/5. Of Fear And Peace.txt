On the street corner of my mind
Thereâs an apostle playing a harp
He says, âOn this soapbox, Iâve begun to find, thereâs so much peace in my heart.â
In the smoke-filled rooms of my mind
Thereâs a magician eager to start
He said, âIâm here to put the mystery back into death, there has never been fear in my heartâ
And Iâll piss on the walls of organization
Cold stare in the eyes of convention
I still yearn to be the gleam of self-destructive eyes
Singing deathwish blues but still afraid to die
The moon reflecting the sun greets me when Iâm out
Urges me to destroy, his friends all know my name
I follow them to the dam holding back a river of ire
He is the key inside of me that sets this world on fire.
