[originally by Wire]I'm tired of being told what to think
I'm tired of being told what to do
I'm sick of fucking phonies
Iâm sick of you
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
Take all of your money, and shove it up your ass
'Cause you think you understand, well it's a fucking farce
I'm sick of fucking phonies
That's right, I'm sick of you
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
And if you turn and walk out that door
And take your fucking money, let me tell you what it's for
I'm sick of fucking phonies
That's right, I'm sick of you
