Time in bondage, space in chains
Cripple the dance of ageless in ballrooms of fame
Time in bondage, Dark face sustain
Lie rest to elders in coffins of change
And, oh my friend, I watch you age like wine
And I see you age through rust colored eyes
Iâm going down, but not in any book
Iâm going down, Iâll see you in hell.
