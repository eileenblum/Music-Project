The flight of the phoenix has been grounded
Tried to rise up but got pounded
Shake up dust, move to the next town
Nights spent channeling this desperate sound
Alas, the phoenix reaches the sky
Threatened by the jets jetting by
Not an inch of earth left to solitude
Not a piece of luck to see us through
How long do weâve left to go?
