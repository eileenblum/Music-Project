The streetsweepers are out
here to cleanse my soul 
The streetlights are out
to hide the shadow of fear

I'm out of my body
I'm out of my mind
The dangerous beat
is easy to find

I could build a house of wood
I could build a house of bricks
All shelter will crumble
All will burn to the sticks

I'm out of my body
I'm out of my mind
the dangerous beat
is east to find
