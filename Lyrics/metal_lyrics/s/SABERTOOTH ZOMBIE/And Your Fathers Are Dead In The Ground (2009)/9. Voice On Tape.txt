Nihilism pours from my headphones
A voice on tape screams 'FUCK THE WORLD'
And I'm pouring their paper down main street
sucking the waves from their wires

This world holds you back
The dirt fills your shoes
The crust of the earth
is made of malice and pain

But I hope someday you find someone to love you
I hope hope someday you find peace in yourself
The earth is separate from the populous
And yourself isn't lost in the tides
