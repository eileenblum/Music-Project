I told the nighttime to wait
A few more hours a day
I hold arms too strong
arms hold arms too strong
I told the nightmare to wait
I told myself to behave
juggle oil and loyalty
with frail hands of clay

I told them to shut their mouths
but they wont miss the chance to feed
Violence stops them moving their chops
Spit half chewed eulogies for cops

I'm in a cleft stick
I'm in too thick
I'm up creek shit
I'm in a cleft stick
