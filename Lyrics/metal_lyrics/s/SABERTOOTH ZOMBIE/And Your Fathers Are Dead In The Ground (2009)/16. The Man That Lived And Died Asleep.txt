Your ignorance will outlive your body
Black stones will outline your grave
your children will learn to ignore
A father that lived
A father that died

A man that lived and died asleep

You put trust in those with loudmouths
None in those fell silent by the times
You dreamt of nothing in your deep sleep
and that's how you lived
and that's how you died

A man that lived and died asleep
A man that lived and died in his sleep
