Her fury rises as the sun rises
Her nerves set with the night
A myriad of malicious misers
keep their moons locked up tight

The night is police
poised to swat her patience she says
my bed my bed my bed my bed my bed's like a jail
The Morning Is a Freight train
barreling into the station she says
my mind my mind my mind jumped the tracks eye
lids to cover earth
like reaper hoods she says
I'll dig I'll dig I'll dig I'll dig to the center of conscious
eyes on fire like balls of napalm she says
my hell my hell my hell's on earth

Her fury rises as the sun rises
Her nerves set with the night
A myriad of malicious misers
keep their moons locked up tight

NOW I LAY ME DOWN TO SLEEP
