Big dumb leaves
scrape my head
I walk through trees
to cheer for the dead
Glossy paint and tinted windows
hot new cars for lunchtime widows

I see you hiding there
microscopic guiding hairs
stand attention on the back of my neck
GUIDE ME....

Guide me to the street
to discuss gods and masters
Guide me to the halls
to discuss death and taxes

WE ARE CONNECTED
