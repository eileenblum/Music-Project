Grave digger grave digger
call me a slave,call me a ditch digger
You grab my pant leg on your fall from grace
You're the face of human waste

Generations of apathetic drones
brought you solace to bury the bones
of a so called inferior race
You're the face of human waste

You built a kingdom
You wont let me in
You are a peddler
of human skin

FUCK YOU GRAVE DIGGER
