A drugged ex-marine
feeling low on himself
begs for change
on the corner of disillusion

His tattooed arms read 'fuck off'
above a shitty cross on fire
His tattered sign warns of a mothership
here to suck his brains

When they come for him his mind will be gone
Dead in an alley with shit in his pants
This is his maiden voyage and he's fighting alone
against spacemen and cops
He'll fight to his end
