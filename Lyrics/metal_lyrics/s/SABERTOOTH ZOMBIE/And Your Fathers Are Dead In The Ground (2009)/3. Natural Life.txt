Natural life is ancient
Natural life is strange

Wiping off eyes
I break blocks to feed
I beg for steps of tenor
and for words of my own

Natural life is distant
Natural life is strange

I'm beginning to hate talking
I'm beginning to hate walking
I can't find the words I've lost the way
I'm beginning to hate everything
