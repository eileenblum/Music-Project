I don't wanna be alone tonight
so I push my way into the hoi polloi
Float above them and burn bright
Hex sells!hex sells!but I'm giving my life

The great unwashed retch at my feet
I'm the witched witch red as meat
I push bones of dinosaurs into the sunbaked clay
I've learned more from tomorrow than you learned from today

I don't need time 
time needs me
