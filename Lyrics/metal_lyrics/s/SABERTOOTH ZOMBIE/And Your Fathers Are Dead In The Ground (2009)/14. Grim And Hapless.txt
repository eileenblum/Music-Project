leave your fruit outside
watch it rot to wine
leave slabs of flesh
watch it grow to insects
leave stays of water
watch them cloud the sky
no rain to fall
an earth that's cracked and dry

Lead your children to bomb
watch them cower in piss
Lead the monkey-fuckers to hell
watch them set fire to nests

Grim and Hapless
spent the night
riding winged
to salvation
Mr. Grim and Mr Hapless
made it to town
there they were slaughtered too

leave your flesh exposed 
drown in posies and ash
leave cancer to grow
bask in radiant light
Leave your shell malnourished
as rodents infect
in the year of the rat
with no brain to reflect

Let death sweep you in
take your vessel to rest
let these brothers be your council
Grim and hapless know best

Grim and hapless
spent the night
riding winged
to salvation
Mr. Grim and Mr. Hapless
made it to town
there they were slaughtered too
