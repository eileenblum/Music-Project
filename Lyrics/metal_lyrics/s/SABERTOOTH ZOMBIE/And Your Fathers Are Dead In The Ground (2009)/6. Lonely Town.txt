The shopkeeps's song goes fa la la
The lawnman behind sings follow the law
In the courtyard you could hear the church bells ring
In the backwoods you could hear the bluesman sing

But you cant eat applause for breakfast
and you'll starve if you can't find a way in
into the media tarpit into the right market
THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN DON'T SING NO MORE

Lonely town I'm a hungry man
Lonely town I'm wild with curiosity
Lonely town I've got generations of bad lives
vapid at my feet,oh,would you please save me
