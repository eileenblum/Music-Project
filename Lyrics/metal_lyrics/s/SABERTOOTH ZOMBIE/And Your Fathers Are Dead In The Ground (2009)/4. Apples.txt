I speak to the sky
with apples in my mouth
I look to the sky
god picks the stems from my mouth
I reach to the sky
monkey wrench in hand
I unfasten the sky
bright night to the land

I have sinned but no punishment awaits
The judge sits dead,dead on his bench

Dead deity deliver me

I wade through the sea 
as quick as cholera
History lies in the sea
I cover my tracks with death
