Old fools will rupture themselves
filling paychecks and cunts of wives
Feast of leaches and lacerations
halls with torches and portraits with eyes

He's a king,his castle is protected
Intruders kept from cunts of wives
Wafer thin and bulging with sex
Fences with wire and cameras like eyes

One nation under god
in the land of nod

Old tool your pervasive praxis
Like dank perfume stale cunts of wives
Old fools will define love as he and she
in the land of nod, under the blanket of god
