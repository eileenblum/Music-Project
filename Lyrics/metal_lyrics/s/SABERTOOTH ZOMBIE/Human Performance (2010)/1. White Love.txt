Iron teeth grind
Rooftops and spires
Souls and wires
And dust dust dust

The mouth on the wall
A spate of harsh words
Heartaches and lies
And trust trust trust

Give in to my thighs
Give me your money
Your cum and your hate
And lust lust lust

Raises and stakes
Parasites of fate
Pork bellies and rape
And cream and sugar
And gin and aspirin and death

WHITE LOVE WHITE MEN

A violent wave of violent days
Violence pays in this violent maze

Grandeur, profanity
Petty cash and vanity

Dilate my eyes
And drip risk through my holes
Dig marrow from my bones
And fill my caves with time
Age me, enrage me, cage me
Enslave me to the scores
When I die, when I die
Fix me help me and lie...

TELL THEM I WAS GREAT

My face lit up in ashes
Burning grinning death
Take with me 
An unknown legacy
Point my gaze to haze
Point back and mourn

Shrug the shoulders of god
And pile feints at his door
Mask my thoughts of stench
With the smell of success
Age me, enrage me, cage me
Enslave me to the scores
When I die, when I die
Fix me help me and lie...

The end can be found 
Obliterating
One's honesty
