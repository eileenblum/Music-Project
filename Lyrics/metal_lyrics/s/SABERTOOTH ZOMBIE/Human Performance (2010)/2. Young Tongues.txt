Words of a feather
Plucked from the breast
Of a man-eating crow
At a carnival show
Oh words of leather
Skinned and dried
Dead hides hide
Spoiled meat inside

Lend me your ears 
And I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing 
Words you don't understand
The lemmings are here
The words that spill from their dents
Are eating holes in history
Burning their young

With every breeze 
They weeze years of staled sentence

With every shouted, calculated threat
They watch their words run like shoplifters
Bad boys imbued; confuse and want

Crypts of grayed text
Lined with walls of electronic noise
Enter the house of giant teenage boys
Gospel and canned heat
Slogans and defeat
Kill your idols suicidal
With whips of dead meat
Lend me your hair
And I'll sing you a song
Of fury and cops
Pretend you understand
The lemmings in line
Have notes in their hands
Your landlord is outside
Go tell him to fuck off

The wasted seed
Swings tonight
From the soles
Of the unknown
He thinks of you
In response he says:

Cody,

Realize yourself
Your fosters of wealth
Come nest yourself
Your haunts of men
Punish yourself
Your red mask
Berate yourself
Your screaming mind
Please yourself
Your midnight walks
Commit yourself
Your striped suit
Defeat yourself
Your short breath
Lay down yourself
Your death trip
REFUSE SELF
Your black rope
Complete yourself
I can help
Complete yourself
I can help
Complete yourself
I can help
Compare yourself
To no one else
Hide yourself
Hide yourself in gauze
Repair yourself
Your not as old as I

We only age years at a time
We write our age over grave sites
We write our names over grave sites

Oh sweet life generic
This strange life to perish
