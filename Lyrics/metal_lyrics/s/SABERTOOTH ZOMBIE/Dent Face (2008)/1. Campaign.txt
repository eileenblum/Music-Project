When the downpour soaks your shoes
When your clothes tear from the street
Dry yourselves on the money I burn
Stitch yourselves on the lies I've strung
When your ribs poke through your shirt
When all your organs hurt
Nurse from my bountiful breast
Ease your pain with my drugs of youth

GIVE ME YOUR TIRED AND POOR
I'LL SEND THEM TO WAR
GIVE ME YOUR HUNGRY AND FRAIL
I'LL SEND THEM TO JAIL

I'LL SEND YOU TO WAR
