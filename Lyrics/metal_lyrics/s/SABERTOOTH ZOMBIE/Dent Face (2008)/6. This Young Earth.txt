Space fills it's lungs with drugs and dust
Breathing the extinction of man
Eating the bones of this young earth
Shoveling it's core

Refracted off times and trends
The blink of an eye scratches the lens.

I had a dream
Took me all night to turn seventeen
I yen for youth yet get yoked in years
OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME IS FUCKED
