My shadow has burned into ancient sediment
my soles peel from ten ton slabs of granite
flying up from city streets
toes tapping to the crooked beat
born to lose myself
born to lose myself

born to lose

flying up from city streets
toes taping to the crooked beat

LONG WHIP CARRY ME HOME
LONG WHIP CARRY ME HOME

My status symbol
is a middle finger
resisting existing
bury me in obscurity
