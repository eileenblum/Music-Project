My seat is fraying out
The cooks are selling out
California state of diet and drought
cuisine and clout

Los Angeles is burnt
Feed the ashes to the masses
Melt the sunglasses
And hope it passes FOR A MEAL

Northern California ice age
Gold hidden in ice
What's your advice
To survive the price OF A MEAL

Everything goes up but the wages
SLAVES
