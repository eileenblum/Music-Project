holding grudges loose change and private wars
force age on mothers to race hearts on kitchen floors
the things i loath fill my mouth with black, nothing's changed
looking into a third story window at jesus, elvis, and john wayne
i won't phone in my vote to uphold the american way
i won't let my brain die, drowned in TV waves
i'll spit this black from my mouth
at this world i dispise
i'll spit this midnight venom into your AMERICAN EYES FROM THE BACK OF MY SKULL TO THE BLACK OF MY MOUTH 
HATE FILLS MY HEAD, I CAN'T GET IT OUT.
