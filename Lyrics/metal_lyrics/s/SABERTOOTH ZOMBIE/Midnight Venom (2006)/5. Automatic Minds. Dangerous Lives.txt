contrast between life and war
birth and disease 
a father lies awake fighting his own sanity
raise a kid or battle brains
dawn a fucking cloak and rattle chains 
take your sickle with you when you go grocery shopping
forty strollers rust in a field of dead poppies
the difference between you and i is automatic minds and conditioned lives 
dangerous lives and and complacent lies 
lies lies lies lies lies lies.
six miles away past the opiate fields
the banker mortician dine on appropriate meals
of asyphixation and taxes they belch as they eat
the minute hands and maggots get stuck in their teeth
i'm walikng razor edges,
you're trading two by fours
i'm leaning over edges to catolog razor roars.
