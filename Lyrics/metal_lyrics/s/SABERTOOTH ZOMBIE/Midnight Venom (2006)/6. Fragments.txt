the lord of chaos died for your sins
good luck on life you didn't gain any friends
youth part two fuck a word of work
hood stapled to your head get back what they took
gloom and satire growing thin
high wire world on fire here we go again
99 generations on earth falling from this discrepit system since birth
THIS IS RADIO SMASH
hammer to waves
pants on backwards pisshole ass
this is what you saved?
i can learn from your blue fucking light
take these bandages from my eyes
the blue light turns to drops of blood
forcing down tragic lives.
