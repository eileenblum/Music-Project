we learned so much since 77
a new generation sought to change the world 
then we sold it to the mall for 19.95
now 1984 comes in 2009
DECAYED DECADE...
life in the toilet...
DECAYED DECADE...
we got the power to support it 
the age of distain has fucking passed...
so we'll burn a stack of history books to get back on track
