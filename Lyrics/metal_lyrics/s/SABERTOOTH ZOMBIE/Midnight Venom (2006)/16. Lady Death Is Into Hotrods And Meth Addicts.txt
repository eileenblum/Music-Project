two pounds of steel seated into his palm
four tons of steel seated under his balls
speeding tickets stuff his dash and box 
tires loud and bald like an old man that talks and talks
apocalyptic visions of erotic nihilism flood his fucking brain
a metal heart beats toxic blood through exploding veins
HE'S HAVING:
epic group sex with hallow tips exaust and meth
cumming on the disrobed chest of lusty lady death
pig's blood evaporate off blackened streets 
as the pussing corpses melt into vinyl seats
LADY DEATH, I WANT YOUR SEX.
LADY DEATH, I WANT YOUR SEX.
when you live a long way out 
you make your own fun
he's painting the town red
with a big block and a gun
the glass slices his body at the bottom of the cliffs
the blown speakers blast out orchestrated shit.
