the brightest things mean nothing to me
hard to find decency, hard to find frequency
cut the lights don't fucking touch my blaster 
we're born into darkness a species set to disaster
when it comes down to being true, i'd rather be with my headphones than to be with you
i feel like a shipwreck death at my back
sleep in my shoes and you'll miss the attack
