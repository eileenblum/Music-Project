the energy you're requiring i just don't got
iv'e been coming unplugged i got one foot in the grave
the battles imposed i surely fought
but my mind's a time bomb i got one foot in the grave
twenty three years of daily mental breakdowns
has taken it's toll i got one foot in the grave
society's a hangman at the gallows
the wind blows, the bell tolls i got one foot in the grave
ADOLESCENT PUNKS WITH NOTHING TO LOSE
PERCHED ATOP ROOFTOPS SINGING RHYTHM AND BLUES 
IN THE CITY OF DEAD, I'M A SHORT FUCKING FUSE
WE TRY TO BATLLE THESE ANCIENT WAYS.
