he crawls through a trail of blood
his salvation is in death
ten in the morning, he gets the call
he won't clean up this mess
no soul to rise from his body or shit...
no halo to send him to the heavens
he'll rot in shit till the pigs take him
till the sirens take him to the ground
LIVE IN HELL, ROT IN DIRT
just rotting matter that didn't matter.
