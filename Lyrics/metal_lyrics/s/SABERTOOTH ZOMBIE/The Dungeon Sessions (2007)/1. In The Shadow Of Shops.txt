I walk through the alley in
the shadow of shops
Corporate interest protected by cops
I pray, God bring death to us
Please bring death to us

My city's suffocating on shopping bags
My city's medicating on sale tags

Tears and oil pour from the sky
To lubricate every gold cuffed hand
Shoved up every silicone ass
Shit drips onto the lower class

Around here it's create or buy
