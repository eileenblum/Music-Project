The crack between the bookcase and the wall was the darkest line in the room
Until she cracks open her mouth, orates a vile epitaph to a nuclear scorched womb
The teenage babies are still birthed. Grey bearded fathers more blessed than cursed
The graveyard shift more poignant than ever, throw the bodies in the fire, bleed the blood to the sewer

Lady death spits bayonets into young men's necks
Into the gashes spills bodies and ashes
Young suburban heroes run and hide, alone in enemy soil
Conquer invisible foes, wade for freedom through a barrel of oil
Boorish nature devides the nation
