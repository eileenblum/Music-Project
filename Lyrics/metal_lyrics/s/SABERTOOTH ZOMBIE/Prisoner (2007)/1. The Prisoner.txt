I am the prisoner
I have been caught
Creature of habit
Patterns of thought
My mind flight light and dark like a television tube
Need now kids and quick-draw wallets
My mind flicks light and dark like a television tube
Believe be kids weâve been abused
Institutions brought be up straight and narrow
A dark tower to my grave
I think in their thoughts
I am the slave
Give me something more
