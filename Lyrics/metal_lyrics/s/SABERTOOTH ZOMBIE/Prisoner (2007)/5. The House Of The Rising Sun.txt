[originally by The Animals]There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a gamblin' man	
Down in New Orleans

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
