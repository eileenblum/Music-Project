They lie through their teeth
Bear their hooks
Explain mundane in twisted speech
The mus-ings of crooks 
A trained army of carnies
That misuse their ruse
Selling sex and selling death
To rethink love and replace rest
What happened to you?
Your inner-futurist masturbated
Shake hands with your tool
To feed this slut of a world
Purge the filth
Cook supper in bleach
Hoard the whores aboard 
The in-flight ministry of speech
