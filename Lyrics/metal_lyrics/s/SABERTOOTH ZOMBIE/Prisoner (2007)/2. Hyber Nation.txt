Yellow ribbons and gold teach and black lung and octane
Fell asleep on sunbeams
Woke up in a deep freeze
Who needs direction, when you got rejection
Who needs reflection, with this inspection
Another month of sitting alone
While the American dream has sex in the yard
The good thing about sitting at home
Is you never have to lay down your guard 
As your Venezuelan maidâs back is turned
Speak amongst yourselves as to not be heard
God bless the walls against immigration
God bless the doors of this hyber na-tion.
