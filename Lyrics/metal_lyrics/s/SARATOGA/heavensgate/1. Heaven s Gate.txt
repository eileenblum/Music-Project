Feel the liberty
Like the bird that comes back home
Search inside yourself
You can give life another colour
I'll open heaven's doors
I'll burn for you
I'll melt your ice with fire
I'll give you peace

You can show
The silence written on paper
You can guess
When you should simply shut up
Feel where you go
You freezed my heart
