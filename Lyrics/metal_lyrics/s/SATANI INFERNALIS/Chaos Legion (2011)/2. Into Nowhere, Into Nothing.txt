Charge the seals, and set the flames
Cleanse the air, and call the names
Crack the void, with a voice of thunder
Thrust open the gates, to pain and wonder

As shadows move, and things appear 
With scorching flesh, and icy breath they draw near
Cross the lines, between pleasure and pain
Suffering in silence, as madness remains 

[Bridge]

Crossing, the barrier 
Into Nowhere, Into Nothing
Bring forth, Hell on earth
And feel the dark, so exquisitely empty 

[Breakdown/Interlude]

Now emerge reborn, the soul is cleansed by fire
With vengeance burns, Infect the earth with unholy desire
Hell on earth, Tear the veil to reveal the lie
The suffering, For your ignorance you all shall die!

Crossing, the barrier 
Into Nowhere, Into Nothing
Bring forth, Hell on earth
And feel the dark, so exquisitely empty
