In this aeon of Hate, the Legion is born
Straight from the slumber of the womb it is torn
Awakened with the rage of misanthropy and scorn
Unleashed upon the earth, from the cunt of the devilish whore

The army of black souls risen up to cleanse the disease
Hellish suffering and torture brings them to their knees
The blood of the angels, stains the earth and the sky
Bringing unholy death to the holiest of lies

The Chaos Legion marches 
Destroy them all
Satan's Legion has come
To claim the damned human scum 

[Interlude]

Huddled in fear just like sheep as they pray
While their souls fall apart as we tear them away
All salvation is destroyed, for heaven is aflame
Suffering of human filth with themselves to blame

The army of black souls risen up to cleanse the disease
Hellish suffering and torture brings them to their knees
The blood of the angels, stains the earth and the sky
Bringing unholy death to the holiest of lies
