[Intro]

Blackened night, I descend into darkness
Evil I am, the priest of Satan
Rituals of hate, against the holy
Darkness falls, upon you all

As I walk among the Demons of shadows this night
I descend into Darkness, to misanthropy. 
My words upon the winds wrapped in unholy thunder
As I call out the names, to the black abyss
When Darkness Falls upon the night in austere silence
I call upon, our lord,  Satan!
I am the one, that brings forth the end 
Open the gates, to the ecstasy!!!

[Bridge - Riff]

Their curse of lies, shall end upon this night
The voices silenced, as souls are ripped apart
Spirits of death, Destroy the holy plague
As Darkness Falls, death upon you all


As I walk among the Demons of shadows this night
I descend into Darkness, to misanthropy. 
My words upon the winds wrapped in unholy thunder
As I call out the names, to the black abyss
When Darkness Falls upon the night in austere silence
I call upon, our lord,  Satan!
I am the one, that brings forth the end 
Open the gates, to the ecstasy!!!

[Outro]
