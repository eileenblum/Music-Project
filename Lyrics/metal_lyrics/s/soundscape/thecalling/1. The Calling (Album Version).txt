[Music &amp; lyrics: Krzysztof Siryk]

An apparent reason why I am here there must be. Fate? Luck? Or destiny?
There must be some kind of primal power That gets me try
New Life - New Plan - New Creation - New Me
Standing on the brink to measureless infinity Look up to see the new horizons
I feel a powerful urge to fly I can't resist This yearning never dies
New Life - New Plan - New Creation - New Me
"Rise and shine my friend Rise to create your infinity
Rise and shine my friend Rise and never mourn again"
