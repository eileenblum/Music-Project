You dwell by my hand
I am the God

The city skies illuminate your severed mind
I walk the night, I drain the light, I send you blind
This dead embrace, I am the blood red dawn
Your tortured face, you are the line I leave undrawn
I flood your soul with pain, the sweetness of decay
Temptation is my blood, and you shall feast this day
I find the fallen, these bones in bloodied hands
Your fear fulfilled, your chemical demands

[Chorus:]
Night of the serpent
Still of the sin
Scars of the mind exposed flowing on your skin
I am the Father
I am the Son
I am the Snake on high, the time worn chosen one

Serpens sum
Et nihil humanum
A me alienum puto
I am the God

Dreams like fires cauterise the city skies
The cries that claw your mind, be slave, be dead, arise
Become the hellion, become yourself no more
Scratch out your brittle eyes and cast yourself ashore
A myth to venerate, behold the fork-ed tongue
Into the wilderness, we shall unite as one
And walk into the flames, the open mouth of hell
I am the god, the snake, and in you I shall dwell.

[Chorus]
Night of the serpent
Still of the sin
Scars of the mind exposed flowing on your skin
I am the Father
I am the Son
I am the Snake on high, the time worn chosen one
