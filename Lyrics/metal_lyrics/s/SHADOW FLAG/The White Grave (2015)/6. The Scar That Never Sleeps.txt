Nothing scars yet nothing remains,
Nothing screams and nothing pains,
No one comes yet no one leaves,
No one turns when guile deceives,
Nothing tortures indigo mind,
No one stops you from going blind,
Nothing treads so carefully
Nothing bleeds or cares to be
Nothing lives inside this place
Except you
And me
And the human race.
