Cast you chains around these city skies
The imposition of all the broken lies
The vertebrate is torn, the body cries,
Nature taken, bloodless you will writhe.
Incandescent into this salvation
Prophecies have built unwanted nations,
Yet as they sleep, the lights shine undesired
And as they weep, their tears will feed the fires,
The hundred indistinguishable desires
That the unfulfilled infidel requires.
Stormcrow stands, impoverished and bold,
A fitful end as the truth unfolds.
Kill the lights, the broken arms of war,
Kill your brother as the Snake settles the score.
Worlds you weave, lives you wish youâd led
Guided by this greatest evil bled.
Personification, infiltration and remorse
Degradation, arbitration and loss,

Once you found a star upon a mind
Once you wept until it sent you blind.
Half a life imprisoned in a tomb,
Half a life condemned to blooded womb.

Stormcrow, open eyes, intoxicated signs,
This tribal brethren occupied by lies,
As the East wind blows, they take upon the wing,
The chants that flutter, the peace before the sting.
Stormcrow waits upon a lonely shore
As the Snakeâs eyes promise shall implore,
Connected to this existential farce
Forever implicated in these times that last.
Dawn was eaten, done, dissatisfied,
Broken twice, three eagles cross the sky.

Could we be impossible remains?
Could we be the last of the unnamed?
Could these words we utter silently
Be the finest effigies to death?
When they come, will you and I entwine?
Togetherness a symptom of the time?

Stormcrow waits upon a lonely shore
The songs of Stormcrow heard no moreâ¦..
