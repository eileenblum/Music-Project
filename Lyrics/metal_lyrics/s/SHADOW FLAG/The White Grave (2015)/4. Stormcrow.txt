See the Stormcrow child.
A ragged, feathered silhouette
Against the dusty sky.

She steps and shakes, twitch and stare,
Beneath a broken streetlight glare.
She is wrath, she is fear,
She is shaking, sobbing fury.
The nightâs firstborn
The howling worm within.

See the Stormcrow child.
She walks the dust-scabbed shadowlands
A home beneath the claw-scratched trees,
A walk that started nowhere, breathing in the light,
Facing crunching lonely blacktop miles.

See the Stormcrow child.
She spits the blood and feathers
Coughing up dirt-filled miles, amnesia
Neither here
Nor there
Born of oil and human hair.

See the Stormcrow child.
Twice more.
Once.
A bone-hung reminder
Of the moments you left behind.
