A child sits alone, in the remnants of the angels and the bones,
The wardens of the wild, in the mists of time, just breathe you broken child,
Winds coloured red, as the sunset howls, a promise on a thread,
The jawbone city skies, swaying in the heat, lost paradise.
Tranquilize tranquility
Anaesthetise necessity
Leave entropy

[Chorus:]
My screeching terrors
My laughing nightmares
My tattered joy
My deadened voice,
These wretched things
Deserve to die,
For all have left
My world a lie.

A child holds a gun, in his wounded eyes, a war has now begun
Two shots to come, but the outcome that remains is only one
A scream shall defy, as he raises dripping fist to bloodied sky

[Chorus]

Sinkâ¦..into the sand
Sowâ¦â¦defiant hand

A child lays his head, as the incandescent rains become his bed
A stain on the sand, and the future of the earth within a hand.
