Skies, burn across a nation
Lies, demon occupation
Sun dies, as night becomes eternal
Myths rise, hope becomes internal
Reality must dieâ¦â¦
Forever red inside, a fever of the soul
Never sworn to die, skins shall reap the cold

[Chorus:]
Deny your creation
The wolves are alive
Their teeth, the temptation
To the other side
Defy a revelation
The wolves are insane
As onward you hasten
Through the dark divide

Caged, demarked and defined
Chains, the spaces that you find
Spirits, slip amongst the shadows
Memories, burning through your eyes
Reality has diedâ¦..
Forever red inside, a fever of the soul
Never sworn to die, skins shall reap the cold

[Chorus]

Black metal disco section â maybe some whispered words indistinct yet present

Mortality, flow the darkest river
Wolf dies, taken by the light
Seven eyes, wait upon the sufferer
Petrified, he stares upon the end
Reality has diedâ¦.
Forever red inside, a fever of the soul
Never sworn to die, skins shall reap the cold

[Chorus]
