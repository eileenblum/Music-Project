My father told me of this place
He told me to come here.
The tales he weaved through smoke-filled black,
Intricately laced with jokes and strangulation.
His final words, written on the barrel of a gun
Unread and, as yet, unused.
They spoke of an ancient being
That would descend and instill
Amongst us, after he was gone.
Now it dwells within and, on each day that has passed,
It has become more real,
More real than the steady heartbeat of his ever present ghost.

Is this hell my life forever
Snake, you beckon the dark
Into hell confined forever
Night, you become our mask

The days of liquid thunder, the nights of unprecedented dangers,
Every sip tastes a little more like the end of time,
The closing of the act,
My final bow to humanity.
The knots begin to fray and my silence beckons,
I must speak up now
As the stage rots beneath me,
I must describe the worlds we have weaved
For their loss will be our salvation.
Is this hell a world we have made for ourselves?
Or is this hell our dwelling place for eternity?

Is this hell my life forever
Snake, you beckon the dark
Into hell confined forever
Night, you become our mask

Is this hell a world we have made for ourselves?
Or is this hell our dwelling place for eternity?
Only the Snake can intervene

Is this hell my life forever
Snake, you beckon the dark
Into hell confined forever
Night, you become our mask
