Desires for lives in flames
Lives that have no names
Eyes that play the darkest games
Twisted souls â a memory of remains
Rite to be heard
The sparks that fly
Chemical bliss
In the arms of a concrete night

They come to you

The night, unfolds, they follow
The crow, this cold, this hollow
The night, untied, will swallow
Your mind, unkind, tomorrow

The storms they breathe unfold
Banished from the outer world
Silence, without the cause
Dedicated to your loss
Insanity, depravity imposed
Those you hate, you fight to know

They come for you

The night, unfolds, they follow
The crow, this cold, this hollow
The night, untied, will swallow
Your mind, unkind, tomorrow

I am the blood cell
That courses through the veins of the city
I am the blood
That flows and trickles
And sticks to the walls.
I am the blood
That is smeared on the faces of the lost.
I am the blood that binds
Yet I will leave no trace.
I am the blood cell
And you are my face.
I am the blood cell
And you are my face.
I am the blood cell
And I leave no trace.
