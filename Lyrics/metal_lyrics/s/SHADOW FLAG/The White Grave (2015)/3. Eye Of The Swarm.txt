Pits
For the bones
Signs
On the stones

Take one sip from this glass
Let the years come flooding past

[Chorus:]
In the swarm we dwell
Above your world
As the winds expel
Visions of hell
In the swarm we dwell
Above your world
The last night fell
Visions of hell

Night
Of neon skies
Pray
For sunrise

Hear the myths I shall proclaim
And watch the words drive me insane

[Chorus]

Teeth
Like broken thorns
Blinded
My world is torn

You drive the thought into my brain
And leave my flesh to writhe in pain

[Chorus]
