This starving cold
That burns my eyes
This childlike soul
That claws my mind

Become the infiltration of all mankind
The revelation of another broken life
The Snake has taken that left behind
Illumination of another world untied

These warlike eyes
That took your life
Your spirit tied
He shall decide

Become the infiltration of all mankind
The revelation of another broken life
The Snake has taken that left behind
Illumination of another world untied

Hear your cries
Drink your lies

The river, Snakeâs disguise
The riverâs flowing lies
The river drinks your soul
The river flows in youâ¦.

Hear your cries
Drink your lies

The river, Snakeâs disguise
The riverâs flowing lies
The river drinks your soul
The river takes you homeâ¦.
