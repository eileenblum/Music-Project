The Bonefires burn tonight

Northern fires shall burn tonight
Rise, the voyage wings expire
Evil eyes can only spy
The Bonefire

As the poison drains away
Shall the shadows be their prey
Breeding lies inside their eyes
Frozen minds, the night disguised
The Bonefire

Broken fears expelled with haste
Reaching flames, demonic taste
Deadly night can only fear
The Bonefire

As the poison drains away
Shall the shadows be their prey
Breeding lies inside their eyes
Frozen minds, the night disguised
The Bonefire
The Wanderer walks
As the worker waits.
The indecisive watch growing grey and shrunken.
The Bonefire burns alone in the night.
Shield to the watchers and sword to the shades.
The comforter crawls in fading light.
A betraying voice calling,
Frail and poisoned.
This lone fire dies a little more each night,
Faith of the watchers and ghost to the shades.
Bones and tissue, slick with grease,
Wrenched and twisted, a bodyâs peace.
Sick, the stench, this reek. Defile.
Blackened, stinking
This corpse god-pile.
The vapours roll as the watcher waits
The revenant stand beyond, grey and waiting.

The Bonefires burn tonightâ¦â¦
