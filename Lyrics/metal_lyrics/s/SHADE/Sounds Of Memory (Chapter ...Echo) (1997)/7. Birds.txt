I'm turning of the look
From colours of reality
Penetrable, pleasant warmth
This one moment, while
Fly away from here
Touch a sun bean
Breath of wind

I see unblemished sky blue
And below mosaic of hue
Morning's stream of white
I'm penetrating these world by
sails
Only if like they are?
Maybe it's a sleep?!
But birds are swimming
continually
in underskys dance.
