Sin after sin
As you deny
Your great desire of been divine
You better wait... You better wait... You better wait
for all the secrets to grow again
Intoxication smoothed your lies
Seeking guidance to fight your crimes
You canât invade... You canât invade... You canât invade
My free will to glorify yourself

Take my demons convert them
To free your sins â consequences will come
Isolation to cure and bring once again
My confessions and scorn  

You Incompetent bastard
âCleaningâ my â darker side
Confusing and lying
To realize â you canât go back
Your filth and deceit - Get out of my way

Sin after Sin
Forcing mankind
Conceal your fraud in our lifeâs
You better wait ...You better wait... You better wait
As my weakness becomes your fear
A crawling vicious â comes within my
Intentions to break your greedy reward
You canât invade ... You canât invade ... You canât invade
My free will to glorify yourself
