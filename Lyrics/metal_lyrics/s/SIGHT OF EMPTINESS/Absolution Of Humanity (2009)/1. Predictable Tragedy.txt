TIME
So far away from my past
leaving all witness behind
stepping aside from remorse
forward the sun
Every time when I care about something
You collapse â showing your weakness
Wasting my faith for forgiveness
Bringing down all what we cared long ago

TIME
So far away from my past
Ruining yourself even more
Canât change what canât be undone
Losing control
Every time when I care about something
You collapse â showing your weakness
Wasting my faith for forgiveness
Bringing down all what we cared long ago

(Hereâs what makes me fall)
(K)now that youâre gone
Nothing will be like before
Can I forget?
Every mistake we created
Feels like a hole â eating my flesh so slow
(Miss every day â dreaming like never before)
Would you be there?
Once I die

TIME
So far away from my past
This is the end?  I hope not
Touching your soul with my words
Feeling so small
Every time when I care about something
You collapse â showing your weakness
Wasting my faith for forgiveness
Bringing down all what we cared long ago
