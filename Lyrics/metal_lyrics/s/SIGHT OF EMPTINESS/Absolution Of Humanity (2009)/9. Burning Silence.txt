Why this cold silence burns so much?

Ohhhhh, I try to be so cold
Knowing how it hurts your
Feelings and expectations
Feeding my thirst with so much pride
One day Iâll regret my mistakes and fake words
hiding within me
all I always want to say to you

Burning Silence Kills my Pride
This Burning Silence...kills my pride

Impossible for me
To unchain this mighty chaos
losing all I love
I cannot live â I cannot die
One day Iâll regret my mistakes and fake words
hiding within me
all I always want to say to you

Burning Silence Kills my Pride
This Burning Silence...kills my pride

âEmbrace me
Believe me
Come with me
Take me beyond this remorse
Follow meâ
