- This is a chapter of fucking hatred -

Turning the same page again
living on this world of lies
feeling like nothing is right
everything seems to be a fight

crushing my good will
To kill my rights
facing disorders
to watch them cry
assaulting mankind
to clean your land
a failure of epic results

- Take my hand â Face your pain â
Donât let your fear drive you apart from this empty hole
To die or survive
renew whatâs not right
fill my flesh with so much control in order
to fight this fucking nightmare
-- Downfall --

Building a new race â To show you my heart
Spreading my torment â Condemned you for life
Hopeless solution â To fade my own swarm
Slow executions â To clean this raw path

We are back â follow me and leave behind all your cries
certains things are nothing less than hidden lies
followers are nothing less than weak â lost men
great to see you broke the chains

HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE

Bring some light â In my life
Cure me and take me â To unknown places
Emerging and walking through virgin new lands
This is my place and Armageddon
