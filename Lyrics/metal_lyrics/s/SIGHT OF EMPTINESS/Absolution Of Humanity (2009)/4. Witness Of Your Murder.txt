Imagine once the people
Donât give a damn for others
Imagine all the chaos â We brought
In our lifes
Put it away
Think one more time
Enemies wonât die â Victims will die

Witness of your murder
Witness of my murder

âIf I ever die
Trying to survive
All this grief and torment
Youâll be my witness
Facing once again â shocking moments of death
CRIMINAL
Look what you become - run now!â

Struggle with rage
To clean your mess
You are the witness
...of my murder

We listen to them crying
and nothing seems to happen
a thousand excuses raising â for us
to hide from war
Itâs all a shame
Think one more time
Enemies wonât die â Victims will die

Witness of your murder
Witness of my murder
