âAwaking without knowing my way
living in a shapeless spaceâ

âFalling away from myself
losing control once againâ

So hard to breath within this shell
seems like I cant feel the same - weird sensations drag me down
"Rest in Peace" is what I heard from a voice that kills my soul
shaking all my buried flesh - turning this into a ghost
never turn my back on you - before I cant move no more

I might see the light soon - This is a Faceless Dream
Fear my urge for control - This is a Faceless Dream
- AWAKING - looking to meet you with rage - This is a Faceless Dream
- FADING - my skin collides holding my death - This is my Faceless Dream

Am I ready to survive?
Exit this path full of flames?
To spread all the poison away?
Deadly trails keep surrounding my space!
