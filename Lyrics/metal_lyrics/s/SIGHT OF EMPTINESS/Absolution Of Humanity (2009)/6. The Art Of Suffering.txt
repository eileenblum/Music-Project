Here comes my rage with fire!

Waiting for the
right time to discover my life
forcing myself to becoming â the one
who will make you pay your lies
soon Iâll start your end

Here comes my rage with!

All Hope
 is gone
die now

Canât be undone
your soul boiling in blood
destroy your world
is what Iâm looking for  

Beg...for mercy to cure your pain  
blame your attitude for your disgrace
suffering immerse yourself
endless nightmare to embrace your faith

Worthless screams for  
My comfort
Terror prevails
You collapse â Under my game
Feels so good â Itâs coming your end
Damnation
