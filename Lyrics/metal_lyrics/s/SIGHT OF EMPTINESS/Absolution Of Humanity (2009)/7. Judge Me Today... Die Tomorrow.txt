Everyday you get on my nerves
I give up â losing all my control
same mistakes â you calling again
for God sake â stop ruining my own world
sick and tired of playing little games â feels like you
reached your stupid goal
but my fury wonât let me die
let me show you how

JUDGE ME TODAY AND DIE TOMORROW
JUDGE ME TODAY AND DIE TOMORROW

Pull the trigger â and make sure you killed me
Cuz Iâm coming back
To destroy who you are
