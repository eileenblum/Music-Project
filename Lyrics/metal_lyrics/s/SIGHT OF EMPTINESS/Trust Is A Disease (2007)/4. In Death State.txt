My life once again i throw you away everytime that i can. Don't touch me again been tortured by you was enough for me. Enough for me! No, i don't want it, i don't want it no! To eradicate what is in my mind, your lies. Your crap... Killing me slowly is what you're doing desperate voices won't stop my crusade, and chaos will reign the shadows of darkness will tear you apart, and eat you alive suddenly by surprise you won't be the same, won't be the same no, i don't want it, i don't want it no! Terror will embrace you now a nasty feeling caught you by surprise and now you'll be condemned to suffer, by my side hallucinations drives you to collapse come feel my pain and try to survive here comes my rage step out of my mind finally you'll be out of my life no i don't want you, i don't want you no! no, i don't want you near of my face... fucking face!!!
