Try to keep my faith but, i just realized, soon i'll be surrender by the evil force within your heart... I fell suffocated today, I feel so fucking empty trying to change my intentions and don't be so hard oh take me to a place of no return save me from the claws of destiny follow me til the end of this confesion come to me without fears of my beliefs... don't be such a fool desolation whispers... desolation i just realized everything dies in your hand i just realized the knife you stick in my chest ruined my life oh be with me no more living on a limb trust me i will be the one you need dream with me lets be part of this endeavour help me to become your soul and pain... nothing will remain oh take me... trying to escape from this world and this indifference we became a solid mass of hate that destroys everything in our way not surprise you are already dead now you see the truth and you wonder if my heart is yours don't be stupid is the end of my life?
