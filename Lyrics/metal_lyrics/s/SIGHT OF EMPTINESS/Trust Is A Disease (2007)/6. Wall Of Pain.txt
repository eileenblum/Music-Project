I can't stand your pain no more i can't stand your... pain!! soon, my life will colapse piece by piece, like a glass indeed changing this cycle, chaos arrives blameless once again my desire to be there waiting for you to learn how silence it's void clear the path... Is set you demand for a place mankind isn't ready for what will become faithless wounds will fade suddenly you decay falling into an abyss of deathless souls claiming to have a place... inside trying to conquer my... style fighting for things... that, you won't have judge me and face the pain motherfucker! wall of pain ahhh, this is the end of your path nothing will keeo you alive slowly the pain will arise and you will be mine... wall of pain ahhh, a portrait of cruelty and blood confused by the voices of war visions of hate and remorse will force you to quit once for all
