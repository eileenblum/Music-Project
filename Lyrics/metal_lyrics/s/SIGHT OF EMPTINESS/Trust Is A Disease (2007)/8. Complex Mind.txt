Who I am? Who we are? Where I'm from? Do we have a soul? things that are unknown inundate my self strange sensations are part of me now i feel the end is near and you're coming with me immerse our minds on a state without fear no longer mine... My goal was to find out far beyond my control segments of my life, that I can't recognize. Became the obsession that keeps me alive!!! Your paradise... My hell prelude to death is what i can slemm is there something I need to know? Something that will save my soul!!! Frustration will erase it all... and I will be gone!!! Complex mind force blinded soul
I, I own all your sensations ecstasy sets me free the excitement will stand forever hypnotized by my words... Paranoia will eat me alive deadly terror... I cannot forget morbid thoughts come to my mind my purpose has reached and end.
