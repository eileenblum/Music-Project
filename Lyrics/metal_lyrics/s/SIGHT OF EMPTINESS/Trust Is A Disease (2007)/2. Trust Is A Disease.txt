Your lies make me wonder who i've been trusting  Your game it's almost over nothing will stop me Back stab your delight knew your intentions I can smell your lies I must bury you so deep now!! Jealous... of who i am... because you know what i stand for... can't trust anybody don't care anymore close your eyes i'll make you pay there's no way to escape... be witness of my rage your downfall is coming trust is a disease revenge will protect me and make me stronger my hate will destroy you you will crawl forever a nightmare will embrace you make me an offer nothing you can do now you'll be drown in your own blood trust is a disease
