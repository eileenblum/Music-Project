With a clear vision
non stop till the end
flying together
to take care of them

Flapping their feathers
singing through the day
planning a journey
staying up there

Time to leave the nest
fill your wings with air and rain
just follow the signs
to conquer the dawn and night

Passion, your reason
to remain awake

Reaching the limits
of your tiny heart
falling away
flying high to reach the sky

Time to leave the nest
fill your wings with air and rain
just follow the signs
to conquer the dawn and night

Passion, your reason
to remain awake

(-Wisdom grows over time!-)

Being locked in a cage...for no reason

NO
dying slowly now
NO
dying
slow

stealing my life once again
