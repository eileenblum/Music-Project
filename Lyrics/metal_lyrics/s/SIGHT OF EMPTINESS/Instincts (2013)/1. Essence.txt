Adapting their lifestyles - to become just as one
and accepting all the creatures they have found
just consuming what they need instead of waste
the resourses of a dying earth that needs the
help of everybody who wants to survive.

We should learn from them - the rules that reign
inside their head to comprehend
living a dream with nothing to worry about.

Stop pretendig you donÂ´t care
theyÂ´ll teach you how to - believe again

Searching for freedom
no longer suffer the pain
thousands of reasons
to seize - gain back their lands
rain and air to heal
the pain that they all went through

Living a dream with nothing to worry about

Stop pretendig you donÂ´t care
theyÂ´ll teach you how to - believe again

See them cry - scream the earth
loud and clear - collapse the world
lies all around - lies...
time to fight - the war ends now

Living a dream with nothing to worry about
