[Bonus Track]She was born 
As a shepeless lump 
Growing slow and evolves so strong 
And transforms using you as a host 
Holding a force 
That emerges from her soul 

She unfurls all her tones to absorb the control 
Cracking the shell seeking the way 
Hunger has come 

[CHORUS] 
She flies, away, alone 
To conquer her own world 
Demise 
Wonât come 
Until she finds the source 
Of joy 
Donât hide 
Again but blend within 
The grey sky 
Unfold your wings and rise 

Transition, defenceless 
Mouring will come 
Transition, defenceless 
Fear her controlâ¦ 
Transition, defenceless 
Mouring will come 
Transition, defenceless 
Fear her controlâ¦ 

She unfurls all her tones to absorb the control 
Cracking the shell seeking the way 
Hunger has come 

[CHORUS] 
She flies, away, alone 
To conquer her own world 
Demise 
Wonât come 
Until she finds the source 
Of joy 
Donât hide 
Again but blend within 
The grey sky 
Unfold your wings and rise 

Reflecting, her beauty 
She prefers to feel the pain 
Smelling the rain 
Here he comes to take away 

Her life, the light 
Getting close with no remorse 
Slowly she feels 
How her body crumbles 
Down has come the DAY 

To reborn in someone ELSE 
To reborn in someone 
To reborn in someone ELSE 
To reborn in someone
