Gave me your heart, gave me everything you had
When I was down and needed you the most
Showed me love when I knew not what love was
You shared your laughs and kissed away the tears
You're my life, you're the hand that leads me through
Forever, baby, I'll keep on loving you
I would crawl for a million miles, just to kiss the lips that made me smile
Oh, that made me smile
I was blind, I was on the run
The night has a thousand eyes, a heart but one, oh, the heart but one
I just melt when your eyes meet mine
Oh the thought of holding you, oh just the thought of

[Chorus:]
It's all your love (it's all your love) that keeps me hanging on (hangin' on)
I count the days without you by my side
It's all your love (it's all your love)
That keeps my dreams alive (dreams alive)
And girl I can't thank you enough
For all your love
Tell me, child, will you love me when I grow old
Will your tender touch be the same?
'Cause your heart means to me a world of gold
And without you, baby, I'd be lost and cold
You make me feel like a superman
I could take on the whole world with just one hand, oh, just one hand
Girl, you make me feel so alive
I could climb the highest mountain and touch the sky, oh, yes I can
I can't wait to make love tonight
Just the thought of holding you, oh just the thought of

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

It keeps me hangin', keeps me hangin' on
It's all your love that keeps me hangin' on
It's all your love (it's all your love) that keeps my dreams alive
And girl I can't thank you enough for all your love
