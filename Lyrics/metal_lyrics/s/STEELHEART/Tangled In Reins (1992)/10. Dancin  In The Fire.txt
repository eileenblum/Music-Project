Dancin' in the fire!
Sneaking around like a lost hungry hound
Shaking her love in the wrong place wrong time
She needs satisfaction
Yeah, she hides to be runnin' wild and free
But the ring on her finger is welded down to the bone
And it's driving her crazy
Oh honey child have your lost your mind, does your fantasy burn
The chair is slippin' your noose hangs tight, will you ever learn

[Chorus:]
Dancin' in the fire but the ice is melting slow
Holding on too tight and she just can't let it go
Heat is coming on, she could see it in his eyes
Dancin' in the fire
She hangs the key behind the back door light
So the dirty dog can slide in and out of her love
Little girl craves candy
Turns on her big brown eyes and little Mary cries
When her tongue twists and turns, the alibis run dry, a damn good liar
Oh hungry child, has it crossed your mind, what kind of life you've sown
Champagne on ice, the sugar and spice has lost your way back home

[Chorus]

Dancin' in the fire

[Solo]

Dancin' in the fire

[Chorus 2x]

Dancin' in the fire!
