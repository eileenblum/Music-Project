Call me black, call me white, call me anything you like
Just don't call me late for the party
Everybody's jammin', jacked up for a ride
The leather's breakin', skirts are shakin', we're feelin' good tonite
Over in the corner, standin' all alone
A sweet young lady, lookin' like she may be hungry for a bone
Yeah rockin' down the house, screamin' thru the halls
Everybody won't be happy 'til we're tearing down the walls
So come on, and hold on, the party's never, ever, gonna stop

[Chorus:]
Call me black, call me white, call me anything you like
Just don't call me late for the party
Keep it hard, keep it clean, chase it down with gasoline
And don't be late for the party
The band is crankin' louder, the guitars in my brain
The bass is thumpin', the drums are pumpin', it's drivin' me insane
I must be going crazy, my feet can't feel the floor
Gonna swan dive in the punch bowl, and go swimmin' for the door
Yeah burnin' down the house, screamin' thru the halls
Everybody won't be happy till this f**ker falls
So come on and hold on, the party's never, ever, gonna stop

[Chorus]

C'mum mum mum, kick it good, melt that sugar like a honey should
Work it in and out, slide it up and down, shake that sugar to the ground
Ow c'mumm mum mum little piece of pie, fill my cup till the well runs dry
Now c'mon, an' hold on, the party's never, ever, gonna stop

[Solo]

(Call me black, call me white, call me anything you like
Just don't call me late for the party)

[Chorus]

Yeah let your honey move ya, let your honey groove ya
Everybody, everybody shake
Call me black, call me white, call me anything you like
Just don't call me late for the party, yeah!
