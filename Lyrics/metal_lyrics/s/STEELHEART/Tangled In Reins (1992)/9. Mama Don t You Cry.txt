I fight the tears since you've been gone
And I stand in fear, can I make it on my own
Without your love to guide me thru my life
It's so cold at night without you here
And those gentle arms that held me close and dear
Oh we're all the same, we all live and die
You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry
You'll always live in my dreams, oh Mama don't you cry
Every night when I close my eyes
I see a light and shadows of your face
It's always there like an angel over me
So many frozen years hangin' on my wall
A thousand words, I can hear them call
Oh I tried so hard but I could never say goodbye
You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry
You'll always live in my dreams, oh Mama don't you cry
No one can kiss away the pain like you
No one like Mama, no one like you

[Solo]

You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry
You'll always live in my dreams, oh Mama don't you cry
(You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry - don't you cry)
(You'll always live in my dreams) in my dreams (Oh Mama don't you cry)
Oh Mama don't you cry
