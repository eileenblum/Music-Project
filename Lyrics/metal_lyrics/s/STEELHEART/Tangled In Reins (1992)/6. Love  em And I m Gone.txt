Sweet little thing you take the breath outa me
My heart of lust craving fantasy
Let's roll around in mud and play in the sand
A one night stand, yeah a dream come true
Skin on skin, feel my love for you
I'll spin you upside down, turn you inside out - yes
So baby don't fight it, don't hide it, you got it and I want it
We'll make them stockings run and punch for overtime (don't fight it)
When we make love deep inside the oven, we'll melt in honey (melt in honey)
Sweet little thing I ain't selling no lies
I'll make your dreams come alive
Rock me, hold me, love me, touch me, ooh yeah, I love 'em and I'm gone
Kissed me once, now kiss me twice
Cross your fingers and roll them dice
Well babe, (S.O.B.) (slide over bitch), your ass is mine
So soft and frail with a doubt in her eyes
I feel my blood pumpin' and my soul cries
Can't stop now 'til the cookins' done
Yeah baby don't fight it, don't hide it, you got it and I want it
(Don't fight it, don't hide it)
We'll burn rubber 'til your heels fall off
And then some, honey (then some, honey)
I'll slide on home, baby don't you cry
And when I'm done I'll hang you out to dry

[Chorus:]
Rock me, hold me, love me, touch me, ooh yeah, I love 'em and I'm gone
Take me, shake me, squeeze me, please me, ooh yeah, I love 'em and I'm gone
Well now boys, kick my ass!

[Solo]

Yeah just give me a little, a little, yeah I want it all, yeah that's it
Slow it down, baby, slow it down, I like it slow, like it real slow
Yeah, we gotta make it last
chorus
Come on little darlin', take me in your hands
We'll drown inside your world, I'll be your lovin' man
I'll do anything that you want me to... [to fade]
