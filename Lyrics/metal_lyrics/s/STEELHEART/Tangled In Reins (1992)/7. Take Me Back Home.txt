Every step we take is the hard way
We try to build an empire all in just one day
But if we take a breath, and take a look around
Are we missing things, are both feet planted on the ground
Sometimes we forget who we are
We take our chances much too far
Can I find the time to show this heart of mine (a little sunshine in the rain)
Oh, it's so hard to see, what we've grown to be
We fight this world alone, yeah, and turn a life to stone

[Chorus:]
Take me back home, the place where we belong
Where all our hearts still roam, now take me back home
The grass is always green on the other side
We climb the walls to find out to ourselves we lied
Oh we fight so hard to make a stand
We try and fit the world in the palms of our hands
Oh we're searching for a piece of mind
But the world has put money in your hands and made us blind
Will I reach the light, that leads me through my life
(Sometimes I hear the angels sing)
Will I find the road, to ease my heavy load
Make the right turn, yeah, not to crash and burn

[Chorus]

Yeah I still can remember, how we used to be
Just a couple of little crazy kids, runnin' through the streets
Now I can't change the future, I can only feel the pain
I'm holding on, breath by breath, hiding from the rain

[Solo]

[Chorus]
