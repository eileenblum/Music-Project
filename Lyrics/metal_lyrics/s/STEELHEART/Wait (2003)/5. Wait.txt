Ain't the world such a lonely place
All caught up, I fight the wait.
Am I the one that hides the pain, After all the fights the same.
Wait,
Wait, feel my heart it's slowing down
Wait,
I'm waiting for love cause I need you now.

Heaven must try to steer us right
and though it's sad, I lie,
the frozen sunshine and crowed rain, I switch reasons, 
here it comes again.
Wait,
I'm waiting, feel my heart it's slowing down
Wait,
I'm waiting for love cause I need you now
I need you now
(yes....so I reach for light......I feel.....nothing)
You know, You know love is hard to find, I don't let me go
I try, I try
Wait
I'm waiting, feel my heart it's slowing down
Wait,
I'm waiting for love, cause I need you now
I need you now
Oh, Oh, (feel my heart) It's slowing down
Oh yea, Oh yea, I'm waiting for love
I need you now
Wait
