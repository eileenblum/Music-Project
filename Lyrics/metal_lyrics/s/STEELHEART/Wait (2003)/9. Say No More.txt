Show me live my friend
You say you know it so well
You say it's easy, I'm just blind
And trust my life in faith

No no more, no more, say no more, say no more

Oh give me strength my friend
Oh give me hope, a hand yeah

Don't criticize me
Don't patronize me
Don't try to change things

You don't understand
Yeah sometimes I just sit back
And watch the whole damn world go by
I can see so many people scrambling
Just to stay alive
Worried about everyone else but themselves

No no more, ah no more,I say no more, I say no more
I say no more, I say no more.
