Well there's a girl, lives on my block, she got the rhythm, and likes to rock
Most everynight, she's out on the town, because she likes to move around
But when I'm lonely, she always got the time
I got the bottle, she salt and lime

'Cause Sheila, Sheila, Sheila likes tequila

Ol' Margarita is her friend and Senor Cuervos her lovin' man
When she needs some sympathy, she tends to see their company
When it all gets a bit too much, oh yeah, the lady needs the lovin' touch

Oh Sheila, oh Sheila, Sheila likes tequila
Yeah oh Sheila, oh Sheila, Sheila, yeah

[Solo]

She's quite a lady, oh she's quite a girl
Tonight she'll take me around the world
But in the mornin' I'll look in her eyes, and only see a cold sunrise
The bottle's dusty but the liquor's clean, yeah
Break out the O.J. and grenadine

'Cause Sheila, oh Sheila, Sheila likes tequila
Yeah oh Sheila, oh Sheila, Sheila, yeah

I try to give her all the love that I can, all the love that I can
For mister Cuervos, her lovin' man

Sheila, oh Sheila, Sheila
Sheila, oh Sheila, yeah

Sheila, oh Sheila, oh Sheila, oh!
