I remember the days when our lives were so complete
We had each other, love was all we would need
But now you have changed since the first day that we met
You found a new lover, it's me you want to forget
You tried to tell me our love was in vain
I'm a victim of your love babe, and you're to blame

[Chorus:]
You can't stop the rain from fallin', you can't stop the sun shining through
Cause I'll be there forever holdin', you can't stop me lovin' you

Now that you're gone, life is empty and cold
Oh how I miss having you to hold
My nights are sleepless, I'll never be the same
Living without you I'm going insane
And as I sit here wipin' tears from my eyes
How can I make you come to realize

[Chorus]

Well I'll be here, ready and waiting, waiting to love you
Everything that I do reminds me of you
You can't stop me from lovin' you

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]
