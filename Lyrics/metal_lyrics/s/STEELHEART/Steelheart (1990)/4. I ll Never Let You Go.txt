Angel eyes, you have angel eyes, such a smile that lights up my life
You're a dream come true, now I'm holding you
And I'll never, never let you go, I will never let you go!

First time I laid my eyes upon you, all my dreams were answered
First time I kissed your tender lips, my love to you I surrendered

I'll never let you go, you're always on my mind
You're the only one for me, you're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go

Angel eyes, my heart relies on the love you give to me
You never let me down, you're always by my side
And I'll never, never let you go, I will never let you go!

When my heart starts to crumble and the tears start to fall
You hold me close with tender lovin', and give me strength to carry on

I'll never let you go, you're always on my mind
You're the only one for me, you're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go

I'll never let you go, you're always on my mind
You're the only one for me, you're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go

And I'll never, never let you go
