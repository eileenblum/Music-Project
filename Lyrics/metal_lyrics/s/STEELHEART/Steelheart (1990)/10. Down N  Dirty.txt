Well I've been around the world, I've seen all kinds of girls
But not like the one I met last night
She said, "Boy I really like your style, forgive me if I appear too wild
But I want to mow you down like a freight train"

I jumped back, I saw the fire in her eyes
Well, I started shaking in my shoes
She said, "Relax babe, you're in good hands
Oh, tell me what have you got to lose"

Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more
Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more

Back seat, she was running hot, she said, "Baby, give me all you got
Time for dirty dog to come feed the kitty"
We were bumpin' and grindin' all night, hanging on with all my might
Rollin' 'til the train was running off the tracks

The smoke cleared, I looked into her lovin' eyes
Well, I knew my love was on the line
I said, "Girl, I'd be a fool to let you go"
She said, "Come on boy, stop wastin' time"

Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more
Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more

Oh baby, yeah that's it, that's it baby, a little lower, c'mon
Ah, no, no, no, no, not there, yeah, that's it, speed up now, c'mon

I'm goin' down, down, down, down, I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, oh down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more
Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more

Baby, c'mon baby, baby, b-b-b-b-b-baby
C'mon and shake me, shake me, shake

Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more

Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more
Get down n' dirty, lay it on the floor
Shake, shake it up, babe and shake it up some more

Get down n' dirty
