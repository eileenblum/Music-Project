Love ain't easy, love ain't easy for me

Oh baby, baby, you're driving me crazy, I can't take no more
Running around, breakin' me down, my head's down on the floor
I woke up this morning, my gun in your hand, the devil dancing in your eyes
You brush wet lace 'cross my face and love me till my well ran dry
You say you need me, but then you bleed me, oh what's a poor boy to do

[Chorus:]
Love ain't easy, love ain't easy, love ain't easy, love ain't easy for me

Oh honey, honey, you steal my money, take it to the candy store
You wine and dine them, then you blind them, when you're walking out the door
I'm wasted tonight, with a knife in my heart, I'll never make it out alive
You slide back in my world again and cry me a river of lies
Oh please have mercy, she said, hold me in your arms
Oh what's a poor boy to do

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]
