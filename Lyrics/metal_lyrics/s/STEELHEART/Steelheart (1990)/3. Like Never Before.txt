It ain't no crime, baby, oh that you're so fine
But for your love I'd walk the line
I don't want to hurt you baby, or break your heart
I don't wanna leave you lonely, or tear your world apart

[Chorus:]
I wanna love you like you've never loved before
I wanna love you, then come crawling back for more

Yeah I want more, like never before, yeah

Tell me all your troubles baby, I'll kiss away the tears
I'll hold you in my arms for a thousand years
Oh tell me all your dreams, I'll try to make 'em come true
Cause when it comes to lovin' honey, I'll live and die for you

[Chorus 2x]

[Solo]

Oh woman, I wanna love you, yeah I wanna love you

[Chorus repeats out]
