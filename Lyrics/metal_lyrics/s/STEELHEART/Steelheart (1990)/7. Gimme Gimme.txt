Silky skin, legs so long, lips as sweet as wine
Oh come on baby give me just one taste before I lose my mind
You make my blood run hot, I'm burning up inside
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't even think
Come on give it up, give it up, give it, go, go
Hold baby hold me, roll me down for a little while
I need your lovin' baby, come on be a sweet little child

[Chorus:]
Gimme gimme some good thing baby, give it up for me
Give me some sweet, sweet honey, oh girl I'm beggin' you please
Gimme some good thing baby, give it up for me
Give me some sweet, sweet honey

I'm down on my knees
What will it take for you to love me girl, make me your only man
Do you want my heart out on the floor, girl I just can't understand
I'm the one who'll give you what you need, if you give me half a chance
I'd do anything that you want me to
Come on give it up, get down, turn it around now
Push baby push, my lovin's knockin' down your door
I need your lovin' baby, and I can't wait no more

[Chorus]

Love me all night long, till I can't take no more, oh sweet, sweet honey
Love me till the morning comes, oh p-p-p-p-push

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Gimme gimme some good thing baby - gimme gimme, gimme gimme
Give me some sweet, sweet honey - oh, that sweet, sweet honey
Gimme some good thing baby - oh give it out to me
Give me some sweet, sweet honey - oh
Gimme that good thing, gimme that good good thing
Gimme gimme, gimme gimme, gimme gimme, oh gimme gimme
Oh, gimme that good thing, ooh!
