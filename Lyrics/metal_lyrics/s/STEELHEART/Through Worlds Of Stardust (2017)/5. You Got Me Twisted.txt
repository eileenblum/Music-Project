You got a hold on my
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted

How to love
When everyday I'm lost in denying
There's no forgiving world
You got it spinning

And tell me where to find
Little piece of my dying
While I keep loving you over and over
Or I'm dead

Girl, you got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Make me, got me twisted

And now you want more from me
But I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted

We're both dying on a light
But our love is fixated
Now I ... loving you ever again

Girl, you got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Make me, got me twisted

And now you want more from me
But I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted

Lost in a madness
I keep holding on
Wanted so freedom
And I'm gone

Girl, you got me twisted
You got me so twisted

And you want more from me
I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted

Got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Make me, got me twisted

And now you want more from me
But I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted

Girl, you got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
You got me twisted
Yeah, twisted

And now you want more from me
You take a life out of me
You got me twisted
