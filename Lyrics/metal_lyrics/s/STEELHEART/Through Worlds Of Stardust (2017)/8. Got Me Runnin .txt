Hang on if you like
I'm just calling you to say goodbye

'Cause all that you said
I got so angry and I left yesterday

Get drunk with teenies
And spelt with females
And now I know this hell to be paid

You got me running
You got me waiting
I'm lonely
I wanna come home
You got howling
And get so wasted
I'm roaming
Baby, let me come home

I found a little of a soul tonight
I've been so dazed and alone
Life came upon me like a deer in the lights

Another
I feel it be gone
Now I faced it to like on my own

You got me running
You got me waiting
I'm lonely
I wanna come home
You got howling
And get so wasted
I'm roaming
I wanna come home

You got me running
You got me waiting
I'm lonely
I wanna come home
You got
And get so wasted
I'm roaming
I wanna come home
