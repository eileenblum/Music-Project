You are my escape I am locked away from your presence No one to comfort me or hear my cries As I lie awake wondering why I remain I hear your voice calling my name now As I stare hopelessly at my cell wall I struggle to break free yet I still fail to suceed Its not you who put me in here But myself who instigated this pain I was determined to live a life of joy Through worldly means and petty gains But all that would amount to nothing As I approached this end So independent yet you still fail miserably WITHOUT YOU I AM WORTHLESS WITHOUT YOU I AM NOTHING Don't Let Go! Alone I can't suceed Don't let go Never let me go..
