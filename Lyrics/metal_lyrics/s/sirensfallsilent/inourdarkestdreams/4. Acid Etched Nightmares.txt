Your words are so frail your truth non-existent as you continue to speak to me For all those who have turned their backs on you Just another victim Of your vicious deceitful ways as you play innocent Yet you still spit on me I'm through with you My back has been turned on you Yes I'm through with you! A liar you remain! A coward you are A deceiver you shall be How dare you take me for a fool right now You preach your lies yet you seek no truth in it Can you walk the path you have set before me You sit back and have pity on me now You continue to speak your lies Instead of setting yourself free A coward you are A liar you remain You and this wretched society Contaminating us all. A Liar You Remain! REPENT YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS!
