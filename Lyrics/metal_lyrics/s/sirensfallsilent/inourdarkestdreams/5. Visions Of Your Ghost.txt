[feat. Alex Huffman]Trapped inside this paradox Of me and you I'm lost In the shattered remains of us Searching for my salvation I seek my answers to no avail Despite your feelings for Me I can't help to Still dream about you and Wanting to ignore the past. Feeling inclined to Tie up lose ends Despite the outcome I'm All in Despite the outcome I'm All in! What is real anymore!? No more pretending No more illusions What do you do when your soulmates Soulmate isn't it you? What do you do when your emotions are strangling you!? You are the curse The virus that's corrupted me Left in stasis You can not erase this An return to the graces of our master Where this is fleeting And chaos is king! Watching my life slipping away from me a tragedy And I can see your empathy Your angst for me Has set me free If I had all the tears I have shed for you Then I would drown you in them!
