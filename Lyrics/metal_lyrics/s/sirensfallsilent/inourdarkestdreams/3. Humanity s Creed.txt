A decaying world burns around me A hopeless sight for a dying soul Ruins of what use to be abound me I grasp on to all I know Inside a monastery of scarlet painted walls The embers devour all who've yet to fall And as I speak my one last breath I pray repentance overshadows death For we are the sick the poor and insane And we have become just another Pawn in lifes evil game This world has corrupted all we know and obey Perverted minds filled with ghastly thoughts Death and decay morbidity we sought We praised deception Evil and scorn We are the.. LOST we are the.. Insane We mock the ones who have lost their way in this life will we ever find what we wanted or will we perish And when we reap the seeds we sown reality grabs us closely And though we fight to live again will we suceed? How have we lost our way HUMANITY!!!!! Will we ever find our way back Or will we simply just Let it be done!?
