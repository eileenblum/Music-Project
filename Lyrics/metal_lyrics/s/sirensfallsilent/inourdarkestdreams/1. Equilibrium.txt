CONSUME ME! From the inside out I wage war with my demons Suppressing the urge To give into my dark side Faking every emotion to avoid suspicion Blood is my clarity Without this code I am lost.Temptation is taking over The darkness confronts me now Temptation is taking over Desperation sinks in The darkness confronts me now Exhausted from this double life Maybe its better to just be alone So here I stand here in solitude Temptation is taking over Desperation sinks in I hide in plain sight Unable to reach out Will I ever be free of this dark passenger Can I stop it Will I want too...
