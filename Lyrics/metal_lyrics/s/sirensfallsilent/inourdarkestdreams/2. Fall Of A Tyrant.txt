I AM A TARGET!!! Of your self deceiving ways. You Will Fall! Your Tyranny is over Yet you continue to thrive in this place You seek me out to fight your burdens now On my own To carry what your to weak to withstand Yet you still look down on me and refuse To lend me your hand when I am in need Your affliction haunts this world It spreads decay to all surrounding it Your goal is to weaken the strong To destroy the weary and build yourself up! Yet your weakness grows stronger every day (Make Haste) As you hopeless crawl upon your knees (Fix what you destroyed) You have fallen, Your power is void, The lies and deceit you spread to us all You have fallen Your power is void Why do I let you control me From this conformity I must abstain Your control over me has been broken.You will not break me down (I will overcome) You will not tear me down (I will defeat this) I will not be a host For your parasitic thirst Now fall upon the floor I will have the last laugh The Last Laugh!
