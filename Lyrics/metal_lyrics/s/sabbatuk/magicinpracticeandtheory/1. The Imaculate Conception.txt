Awakening now from my slumber beholding the glories of centuries past,
My souls destination my minds revelation revealed in my heart as it shatters
Crowning the king of an aeon that's dawning christened in tears of impotent fools
Avenging with sorrow the hearts that you've broken drained of devotion emotional ghouls,

Mocked and castrated emasculated
Ridiculed from my belief with my spirit now broken,
My threats are but token defiance,
At your years of unending deceit
No hope in believing a Saviour will come to redeem at last,
Raped and abused innocents used by corruption
Then empty are scattered like haff
Awakening now crowning the king mocked and castrated 

Declared a reluctant messiah Desiring a painess release on the cross,
With my kindness of passion so long out of fashion my celibate soul begs for paradise lost
Solomon reigning arrayed in his glory immaculate beauty conceived,
Let the prince be a fool yet the jester may rule when the tables are turned and the truth is revealed

Gentle jesu meek and mild pity thou this little child
You turn a blind eye as I weep but watch me for my soul to keep
I bow my head and close my eyes but beg you not to patronise
A Shame that such humility shall burn in hell eternally
Forever and ever and ever AMEN
