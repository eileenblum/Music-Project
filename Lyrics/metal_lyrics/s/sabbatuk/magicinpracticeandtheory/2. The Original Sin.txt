Once long ago I believed that salvation was mine
I worshipped apostles believing their gospels divine
Stunning all that's evil, I turned the other cheek
I prayed for my deliverance, always mild and meek,
I realise the folly of the noble, of I led
The day you give your soul to god tis better you were dead.

Prayed night and day for deliverance from all I despise,
But the preachers who teach us betrays my belief with all their lies
Till an anger grew within me, at my years of wasted words,
I tired of repentance, and of prayers that went unheard

Father if you love me as your gospels say you do,
Why have you betrayed me - Why do you make me endure hell?

Hell is the fate that awaits me the price that I pay
I fed no remorse - Let the fire take its course - Praise the day
That I give my soul to Satan to do with as he pleased
With my soul laid bare before me exposed for all to see,
