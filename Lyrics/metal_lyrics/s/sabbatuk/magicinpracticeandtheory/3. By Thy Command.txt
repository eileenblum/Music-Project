Reviled and rejected for the thoughts I resurrected,
For eternity I walk this twilight land
Defiantly prostrated to the lord thy god created,
In humanity now face to fate I stand

I have no fear of dying
But fear my soul is frying
On the pyres that I constructed in my life,
You can fell your body burning,
As the brimstone wheel keeps turning
Feeding off the heresy this night

Left alone and undefended unto him my soul is rendered
And swiftly I am dismembered by his hands tongues that damned me,
Now crucify and hang me upon
Torments, they can't hope to understand

Oh dark lord I abhor thee but I bow in fear before thee
I tremble like a child - A broken man,
Now for my death I draw my final breath
Now I know I live or die by thy command
