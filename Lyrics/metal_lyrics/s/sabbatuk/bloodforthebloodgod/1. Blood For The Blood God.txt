[1. The Nightmare Begins]

(The) once the mighty cities now crumbled and turned to sand
Here dwelt the Old Slann (the Masters)
Infinite wisdom (a god given right)
To these genetic scientists forming new life
Yet these powerful beings could never have known
Their seeds of destruction were already sown

See how the void gates that held back the Chaos foe
Shudder and shatter, an entropy overload
Spewing forth creatures, obscene machinations
Malicious entities warping creation
Shrouded in darkness they silently wait
Counting the days 'til the Blood God awakes

Armed with fury, cloaked by night
Mutations spawned by warpstone might
Shall now go forth, proliferate
To slay and conquer, dominate

[Chorus:]
From their holes and caverns deep
Ten million Orc and Goblin feet
With hungry hearts and sharpened knives
They come to take your worthless lives

[The Call To Arms]
"Blood for the Blood God!" [x2]

Die! â Chaos claims thee
Die! â Chaos maims thee
Die! â Chaos claims thee
Die - Chaos takes thy soul
Thy soul

Die! â Chaos claims thee
Die! â Chaos maims thee
Die! â Chaos claims thee
Die - Chaos takes thy soul

[2. Let Battle Commence]

Flee now in terror as darkness descends
The forces of nature relentlessly bend
Spreading the cancer, perverse permutations
Chaotic entropy, warped malformations
'Til where once was beauty lies chaos and war
And that which was lawful is lawful no more

Down below this sleeping city
Red eyes filled with rage, not pity
Stalk our dreams with tooth and claw
And crave for human flesh to gnaw

[Chorus:]
From their holes and caverns deep
Ten million Orc and Goblin feet
With hungry hearts and sharpened knives
They come to take your worthless lives

[The Call To Arms]
"Blood for the Blood God!" [x2]

Die - Chaos claims thee [x3]
Die - Chaos takes thy soul
Thy soul

Die - Chaos claims thee [3]
Die - Chaos takes thy soul

[Guitar solo]

[3. The Field Is Lost]

In tattered shreds our broken ranks
Are swept before this flood
Chaos creatures rend our flesh
And drink our blood

[The Blood God Arises]
"I am Khorne, I am Death
Fear my name, my icy breath
Feel the power, a deadly chill
When I say 'die' then die you will!"

See how the void gates that held back the Chaos foe
Shudder and shatter, an entropy overload
Spewing forth creatures, obscene machinations
Malicious entities warping creation
Shrouded in darkness they silently wait
Counting the days 'til the Blood God awakes

[Chorus:]
Armed with fury, cloaked by night
Mutations spawned by warpstone might
Shall now go forth, proliferate
To slay and conquer, dominate

From their holes and caverns deep
Ten million Orc and Goblin feet
With hungry hearts and sharpened knives
They come to take your worthless lives

[The Call To Arms]
"Blood for the Blood God!" [x2]

[4. The Despairing End]

Where are the heroes in this hour of need?
Stouthearted and brave men who never will concede
To the forces of Chaos, hold back their might?
Who dares to stand proud when the Warhammer strikes?
