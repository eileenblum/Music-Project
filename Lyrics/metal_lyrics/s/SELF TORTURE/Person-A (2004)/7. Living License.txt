I have the potential
To get a living license
If I can take my eyes off
Of this virtual violence

Under the surface
There is a cable mess
Always keeps you inside
And never gives access

I have the potential to get a living license
I can see the lights to pass
Don't think about future or past
That's it, no more, no less

Move beyond this cyber screen
Brand new eternal millennium sin
Your life sucks, my life sucks
And it's absorbing our pale skin

I have the potential to get a living license
Some people respect my orientation
Some of them still try education
Crawl down on the floor
Against our direction
