Amongst the crowd
A senseless search
Close enough to touch
Yet far enough to run

You know your hands
Better than your face
But no one will ever
See your hands first
Always in front of a mirror
To better describe yourself

Amongst the crowd
A senseless search
Close enough to touch

Person-A
Looking at you
Every minute of every day
The rules are carved into stone
You just have to play
Don't need your own reality
No way, no pray
Forget about pure inner-self
That's what I say

You know your hands
Better than your face

Guess who I am
