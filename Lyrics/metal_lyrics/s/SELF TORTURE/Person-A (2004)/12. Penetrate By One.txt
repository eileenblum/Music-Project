It's not past, it's not future
It's the present we're prisoned
God and Satan are in it together
One day you'll look back

The barrel on your face

Manipulate public freedom
Fascinated by what they've done
Congregate them in a cage
Penetrate one by one

There is only no heaven, there is no hell
There is only a planet where we live the present
God and Satan are in it together
One day you'll realize
That no plant grows with blood
