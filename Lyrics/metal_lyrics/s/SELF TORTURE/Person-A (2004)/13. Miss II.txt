In return of friendship
Offered none, gave little
Knew me how you chose
... easy to belittle

Forgiven everytime
Those let downs
Weren't a surprise
... smiles were frowns

Certain you would
Come to senses
Now it's late
... you'll find fences

Now you miss?
And it kills?
If you'll feel better
I miss II

Your priceless lies
Were only the truth
Because I made them so
Your ways were always loose
I was sincere and stupid
Why did you expect?
You were my friend
Why did you neglect?
I was bound to turn to stone
Just ask yourself
Now you miss?
I bet it hurts
If it means anything
I miss II
