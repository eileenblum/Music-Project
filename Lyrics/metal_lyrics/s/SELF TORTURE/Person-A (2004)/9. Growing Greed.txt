Are you hungry?
Or are you greedy?
Growing greed
Lots of pain

Recycled goodness
Becomes villainous
When you try to
Walk on a rope

Your balance is your hope
I respect your thought
Delay self knockout
It's a breathing wound

Making decisions instead of us
Injecting greed in

One thing you ought to see
One thing you must know
Growing greed
Lots of agony
