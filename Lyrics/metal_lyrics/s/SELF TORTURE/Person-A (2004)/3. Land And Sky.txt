When your heart starts to beat
And your lung takes it's first breath
The first time you open your eyes
You have been born into death

Life:

A place between land and sky

When your heartache begins
And your lung is out of breath
The first time your eye starts to tear
You have been born to live life

Death:

A place between land and sky
