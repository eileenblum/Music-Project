Deserving this
Throwing weight
On the shoulders
Failing on purpose

Finding defects
In nothing
That surrounds
Or thatâs involved

Plenty space now
Time paused
Not processed
Neglect on purpose

Uplift, forgive yourself
Your wrong, be right
You stopped, it's OK
Uplift, deserve yourself

Free from hate
Loose in thought
Cancelled effort
Insulting achievement
Not a peace
Only within
Consuming blood
To eat the air

Uplift, don't talk, do
Your wrong, repair
You stopped, that's fine
Uplift
