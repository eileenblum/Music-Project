And as we wind on down this road
See the ruins around us in dismay
Eternity stares, opens its mouth
And in its throat you hear the sound of judgement day
Don't fear the end as all must die
They come for us all, my last goodbye

All my life I tried to find the rhyme and reason of this ride
A flash before my eyes
(Reconciled) with the burning world that's left behind
We reached the point of no return
Lost and ready to crash and burn
Reveal the path that I must tread
To find the silence in my head
No more dwelling on the past
This is the great escape at last
We crawl
Total collapse, the imminent end of it all

For as I know, when I gaze upon your face
What precious and fragile mean in this forsaken place
And as I wind on down this road
See your shadow weep and follow me
My strides gain purpose, a wishful heart
Whenever I wander, set me free
We reached the point of no return
Lost and ready to crash and burn
Reveal the path that I must tread
To find the silence in my head
No more dwelling on the past
This is the great escape at last
We crawl
Total collapse, the imminent end of it all

All my life I tried to find the rhyme and reason of this ride
A flash before my eyes
(Reconciled) with the burning world that's left behind
We reached the point of no return
Lost and ready to crash and burn
Reveal the path that I must tread
To find the silence in my head
No more dwelling on the past
This is the great escape at last
We crawl
Total collapse, the imminent end of it all
We crawl [4x]
