Adrift along this mortal shore
The smell of death that fills the air
What is and was and what will be no more (no more)
Nothing will remain the same
Buried in the silence of our name
Like a thousand suns burst into the sky
The dead will live as all the living die
This is the end of the line
In darkness our world descends
Emptiness will fill the shrine
Red clouds, fire in the sky
So hard to realize
That even death may die
World of cruelty, sorrow fills the land
Juggling with the power in their hands
You can run but there is no way to hide
From those who are dead inside
Scarring the face of the planet with our progress
'Til there's nothing left to repress
Ashes to ashes, no one to trust
New world order, dust to dust
This is the end of the line
In darkness our world descends
Emptiness will fill the shrine
Red clouds, fire in the sky
So hard to realize
That even death may die
Climbing the ladder of technology
While we shape our own abduction
To confirm the god that's inside me
And march towards a mass destruction
This is a countdown
Our world will soon come to an end
So fuckinâ bow down
We warm our hands on the flames of a dying fire
It sounds so absurd, a dirge for a dead world
We leave this world and it won't take us higher
All that's left behind
The ashes of our, of our existence
This is a countdown
Our world will soon come to an end
So fuckinâ bow down
This is a countdown to nothingness
Reshape the earth, drain the sea
Bury the mountains and set me free
This is the end of the line
In darkness our world descends
Emptiness will fill the shrine
Red clouds, fire in the sky
So hard to realize
That even death may die
Climbing the ladder of technology
While we shape our own abduction
To confirm the god that's inside me
And march towards a mass destruction
March towards a mass destruction
