Staring at a callous world
Ignorant eyes with desire for freedom
To await the final hour
Without a choice, bound to be devoured without sin or shame
All of their lives, filled with pain
Ill-treated, turned into slaves
If they could drown us in our own disgrace
Unable to resist the hand of fate
Human greed grows equally with their weight
Never understanding when you hurt them with your hands
Crushing hearts made out of stone
Embodiment of the unknown
We are the voice, for those being left alone
We are the ones who will fight
Between the truth and the lies
We are ones in disguise
We are ones who can try
The past is overthrown
There is a long way, it is a long way home
I'll break your every bone
And send you straight to hell
Justice be done to overcome
A disgraceful life in me
Open up the sky and bleed

Compassion is blown away
Always willing to give but so easy to break
They try to find comfort in decay
Chosen to deceive by a vicious race
Killing for recreation
Built on a hard-grained foundation
Society goes down the drain
Can you image if oppression starts to reign?

Crushing hearts made out of stone
Embodiment of the unknown
We are the voice, for those being left alone
