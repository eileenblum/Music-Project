Awake
Shape dreams when you see them coming for real
As they bring you sight and salvation
Seize the day
This life runs out in the blink of eye
And hold it close, so you can hear the marvel of creation
The lines, they dissipate
Make way for your fate
Behold the strength, I shall reveal (Where truth is the fire)
My will to live, I shall endure
I will not stray âcause I am pure (That lights your way )
Finally there's a reason to remain
You won't hold back, no
There's a reason to remain
Forever in vain
Salvation, yours to obtain

Chakra alight, I travelled far
Sparkling immaculate star
Gather strength in the ancient dance of fate
Maze unfold, it's time to destinate
Behold the strength, I shall reveal
Defy my path, I shall endure
I will not stray, âcause I am pure
I am pure
Finally there's a reason to remain
You won't hold back, no
There's a reason to remain

Forever in vain
Salvation, yours to obtain
Finally there's a reason to remain
You won't hold back, no
There's a reason to remain

Forever in vain
Salvation, yours to obtain
