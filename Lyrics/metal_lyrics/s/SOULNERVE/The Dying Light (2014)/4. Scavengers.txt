Every single bloody day again the world pours in my mind
Cast away, gone astray, I wish I could be blind
There is no sanctuary, there is no place to hide
Worldâs corruption feeds their hunger
No one to blame, oblivious scornful pride

Youâre addicted to the life
Like a scavenger that feeds
The eternal pain will rise
Fly above the blood of me

Castaway, I'm on this ship to drift forevermore
There is no place to hide, will I ever find the shore?
Condemned to drift in an ocean of sorrow fed by tears
The ever growing eagerness transcends the cries that no one hears

Youâre addicted to the life
Like a scavenger that feeds
The eternal pain will rise
Fly above the blood of me
Like the dead they walk the earth
Left in their own hell
Eternal slumber, was it worth it?
Generous compassion, let them dwell
Block the path of hopeless dreams
A hollow gesture, diminished screams
Youâre addicted to the life
Like a scavenger that feeds
The eternal pain will rise
Fly above the blood of me

This world is naught but a feast for the scavenger crows [2x]
