Living my life in exile
And the only ally left has been worn out
I've questioned myself
What direction the cold wind will blow this time
It seems that hope is just a myth

My desire to be embraced
Light up this blackened world
Let my prayers be answered
They say that ignorance is bliss
Roll the dice for what it's worth
This lifeâs a gift and I won't play the final chord

Just canât find this peace of mind
There must be a way to stand the floods of tide

So this is my demise
I've gotta to face the facts no bold-faced lies
Try to break the chains in search for I
Then Iâll find the strength to rise
When this is my demise
I've gotta face the facts that I despise
Restore the balance that's corroded by life
Hopes and dreams won't fade in the sands of time

Just canât find this peace of mind
There must be a way to stand the floods of tide

So this is my demise
I've gotta to face the facts no bold-faced lies
Try to break the chains in search for I
Then Iâll find the strength to rise
When this is my demise
I've gotta face the facts that I despise
Restore the balance that's corroded by life
Hopes and dreams won't fade in the sands of time
