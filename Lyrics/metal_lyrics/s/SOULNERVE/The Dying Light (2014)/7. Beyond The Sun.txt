What's left behind while worlds collide
Horizons await
Holding the past and come with me
To fly beyond the sun (beyond the sun)
My mind it wanders, beyond the sun
Sometimes in silence reflecting about what we've done
Towards the sky we will live on (we will live on)
Beyond the sun we will carry on
What's left behind, our memories fade
Horizons await
Holding the past and fly with me
Go beyond the sun (towards the sun)
My mind it wanders, beyond the sun
Sometimes in silence reflecting about what we've done
Towards the sky we will live on (we will live on)
Beyond the sun we will carry on (we will carry on)
You'll never break these fucking chains (we will live on)
Beyond the sun
When my life is gone
Will my mind carry on?
When my life is gone
Will my mind carry on?
Towards the sky we will live on (we will live on)
Beyond the sun we will carry on (we will carry on)
You'll never break these fucking chains (we will live on)
Beyond the sun
