It is that time once more
To hide behind the mask
Rotten to its core
And ready for its task
To give them hope and make things right
Raging wars and genocide
Screaming the lies with dedication
For absolution and salvation
And now the time has come
To speak behind the veil
Corrupt and twist and numb, as dead men tell no tales
The treacherous dogmatic knife
It cuts another life
The mask we dread, the mask we wear
Wages of sin, kickin' the chair
Save your soul before it is too late
Denying the line of fate
Spreading the fear with dedication
For absolution and salvation
I am no one
Just a word, you must have heard
You know itâs true, you will believe
You canât deny you cannot leave
I am everywhere
A killing lie, a deadly stare
I am all around
Delirium, forever bound
It is nothing but a whisper in your ear
That digs into the conscience of mankind
The evil that comes from all you fear
To believe a lie
Will eradicate
Watch the world as we fall into the void
The blackened skies
Send us our fate
Watch the world but it's too late
I am no one
Just a word, you must have heard
You know itâs true, you will believe
You canât deny you cannot leave
I am everywhere
A killing lie, a deadly stare
I am all around
Delirium
I am no one
Treacherous are those who claim they know the way
No guaranties in life or death exist, no matter what they say
The thing that counts, the here and now as far as we will know
I can't live without a doubt, I can't go down on my knees
No more.
