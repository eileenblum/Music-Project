Long lost equilibrium of the earth
Onwards to a dreadful rebirth

We swallow deception
With catatonic digestion
In a hollow world full of empty shells
Where no one ever succeeds and misery sells
Can you hear the whispers in the night?
This is a requiem for the dying light

Breathing we suffocate
In a society that loves to hate
Buried by the lies
All for one and none for all
Until the final call

We can't find
What we're searching for inside our minds
Holding tightly to the light that dies
Because the truth will not unfold

The deathless pounding of a frozen heart
Like a terminal beat, the dye is cast
With the fading light all will break apart
A hopeless future, a shameful past
Can you hear the whispers in the night?
Forsaken creatures, mesmerized

In a hollow world full of empty shells
We claim we're alive
Where insanity reigns and the moral dwells
We claim that we thrive
Fear the whispers in the night
This is a requiem for the dying light
Breathing we suffocate
In a society that loves to hate
Buried by the lies
All for one and none for all
Until the final call

We can't find
What we're searching for inside our minds
Holding tightly to the light that dies
When the truth will be told

The light inside shines on
You wanna know
If the war inside will rage on
The light inside is gone
But the war inside will rage on

Breathing we suffocate
In a society that loves to hate | Buried by the lies
All for one and none for all
Choking we refuse to see
The lie that became you and me

We can't find
What we're searching for inside our minds
Holding tightly to the light that dies
Because the truth will not unfold
