[feat. Jake E]Dusty nights are scattering through my fingers
Trembling in a tortured, hopeless fight
You look away again with curbed anger
Not knowing you're hurting by holding them too tight

Fragile, small, you are
Your charming ignorance is drowned in grown-up memories
Yet again you look so far
Let me inside your childish world of games and scars

Hold on to me upon this cracking ground
But don't come near for I will topple you down
Feel my heartbeats piercing passionately
Don't touch me, I'm made of blades

A broken future lies within your tears
Drop the hopeful act, there's poison inside me
Live your life's sweetest years
Just want to spend them with you
Is this our destiny
Or stoppable suffering
Can we add a chapter of joy to our story?

Hold on to me upon this cracking ground
But don't come near for I will topple you down
Feel my heartbeats piercing passionately
Don't touch me, I'm made of blades

Roses have their thorns
And dreams are make-Â­believe
Yet you smile with screams
Let me inside your peaceful future of blades and scars

Hold on to me upon this cracking ground
But don't come near for I will topple you down
Feel my heartbeats piercing passionately
Don't touch me, I'm made of blades
