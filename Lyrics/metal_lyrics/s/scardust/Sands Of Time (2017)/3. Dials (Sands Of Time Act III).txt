Turning, burning, sands out of time
Scarring, forging, dust scatters, burns in time
Dials forever will turn

The skies fall apart, the skies fall down
The skies fall apart, the skies fall apart
I see a crystal ball, wondering, why oh why...

Open your eyes to a beautiful rebirth
Watch the sun go down to an endless sea
Open your heart to embrace the silent sky
Touch me, show me how you cry

One endeavor
Scarred forever

Screams of pain, roaring madness creeps inside of me
Scorching scars, I am begging you to let me be
Tainted clouds, how could I have seen the prophecy?
In my nightmare there are corridors I must not see

Fear of death, in a life of endless agony
A voice of hope in the sky of broken harmony
Reap the fruits, sip the poison from my memory
Sands of time, tell me why can I only
See an endless sea, of endless fire and misery

We all cling to the alter of time,
Ticking like bombs â we run for cover,
Fall down to our knees in fear sacrificed,
Scarred by the dials that forever turn

We're all slaves
To the dials that forever turn
We all burn
And the dials they forever turn
We're all slaves
To the dials that forever turn
We all burn
And the dials they forever turn

Forging scars forever
Turning time

Sea, oh endless sea, I seek the
Path to where I once belonged
There's a map engraved upon my soul

Voices fade, names forgotten underneath the sand
Silhouettes paint a portrait I don't understand
Sink your teeth, drown my haunted boat in ecstasy
Broken anchors leave one free to explore the sea

Oh, endless sea, I seek the
Path to where I once belonged
There's a map engraved upon my soul

By the dials that forever turn

We're all slaves
To the dials that forever turn
We all burn
And the dials they forever turn
We're all slaves
To the dials that forever turn
We all burn
And the dials they forever turn

Who can bear the light?
All is one smear
Who can bear the light?
Who can bring a start?
Small debris float in clouds of airy disarray
Butterflies

Take a small leap into one uncharted world
The stars will slowly gather to smile above your unfolding path
And the roots and the birds will trace
New prophecies in earth and skies
Our bodies, our hands, our minds, our look
Are the only instruments
The only map, the only guide
