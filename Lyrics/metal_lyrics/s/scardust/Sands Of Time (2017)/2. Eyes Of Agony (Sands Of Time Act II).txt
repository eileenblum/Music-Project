Another night has summoned demons from my past to wage a war
In my mind the endless tempest carries on
Another flashback to the scorching fire opens up a door
Long lost days are scars, engraved upon my soul

In the eyes of my agony
Memories are written in stone
How could I embrace them as my own?

Another night of lucid images deprives me of my sleep
Screams of pain, roaring madness creeps inside of me
Another tear, yet I am here to face the fear
And seek the answer in the eyes of my agony
Memories are written in stone
How could I embrace them as my own?

A stench of death fills my lungs with terror
Every night I burn in the sickening fire
Losing my youth in a fountain of tears
Scream as the flames grow higher
Look in my eyes, can't you see they're rotten?
Won't you have mercy?
Dare you leave my soul in this broken body?
So I kneel before your pedestal
Begging you to leave me be
Free me from this
Tragedy

My life has passed before my eyes each night since I can recall
Have I paid my debt, or must this hell go on?
I hear the reaper calling my name
Laughing madly as I fall again, in vain
Why is he blind to the pain in the eyes of my agony?
