Timeless glory is what you're running for
Even if I offer my eternal soul
I'm waiting for your mind to let you know:
Only your whole heart is what I'm aching for
I love it when you're looking with your eyes
Finding me alone I'm begging don't you go

Arrowhead pointed towards the sun
Up beyond the sky is where you're aiming
You don't know them, you don't know us.
What's the rush?
You're not even happy when it's raining
Tell me, will you ever look me in the eyes?
Save me from this nightmare.
Darling, don't you go

You broke the lock, went out our door
And watched me fall, watched me fall apart
You know it's not my fault so find your own answers
Stop blaming me and please take me home

Terrified with every step I take
Frightened with your every move
I can't go on
I've waited all this time and you ignore
Deep inside your heart you know I've done it just for you
So don't you dare to judge me now
Take your fancy arrowhead and please just go

You broke the lock...

Your arrowhead is pointed towards the sun
Up beyond the sky is where you're aiming, what's the rush
You broke the lock went out the door and ran
As you watched me fall apart so darling stop your
Arrowhead is pointed towards the sun
Up beyond the sky is where you're aiming, what's the rush
You broke the lock went out the door and ran
As you watched me fall apart so darling stop
Your arrowhead is pointed up,
Beyond the sky is where you're aiming, must
You break the lock run out the door
And watch me fall apart so stop

You broke the lockâ¦

Went out our door
And watched me fall, watched me fall apart
You know it's not my fault so find your own answers
Stop blaming me and please just go
You broke the lock, went out our door
And watched me fall, watched me fall apart
You know it's not my fault so find your own answers
Stop blaming me and please take me
