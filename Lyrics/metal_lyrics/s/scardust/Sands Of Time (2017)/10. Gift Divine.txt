You're sitting on the shore, listening to the waves
The magic of the world flowing in your veins
This is how it feels, this is how it sounds
Entirety of time and space speaks through the here and now

Let the breeze bring you ease, yes, I've come to save you
See the sea sets you free, spirits sing tonight
Serenity I bestow upon you
Take this gift, divine, see the sign

The sunrise over the desert finds your wretched, broken soul
Victim of existence, robbed by misfortune, longing to hear my call
The earth will give you power, the wind will cure your wounds, my dear
Your might shall stand much stronger, all will hear you loud and clear

Let the sun mend you, son, yes, I've come to save you
Feel the warmth flowing in your arms today
Strength I bestow upon you
Take this gift, divine, see the sign

The sky enter the twilight zone and so is your tired old being
Sitting by the ashes of your fire long gone, I know what you are seeking
The end is near, don't worry, son, I'll take you with me soon
That will be the time for you to sail on to the moon

Let death feel your breath, yes, I've come to save you
Come with me, now, come with me, eternity awaits
Peace I bestow upon you
Take this gift divine, see, the sun has set, the moon will shine,
Now you're the one to give the sign
