[feat. Kobi Farhi]An angel appeared unto the barren woman
Saying you shall conceive, the born one will be for god

I have faced his mighty demands with granted power
Yet I'm cursed with so many years of longing
From their side, she looked at me, captured my devotion
Blinded my heart, deluded my soul

Out of eater came food
Out of strong came sweetness

Wherein thy great strength lieth?
I pressed him until his soul was vexed to death
He told me all his heart

Out of eater came food
Out of strong came sweetness

We held him, took his eyes, and bound to the brass locks
Destroyer of our land, we'll mock you as you fall down!

I seduced him to sleep upon my knees
And had the seven locks of his head shaven off
Until his mighty strength went from him

Remember me and strengthen me now, Oh god I pray thee
That I may avenge my two eyes
"Let me die with the Philistines"
He bent with all might slaying more than he slew in his life

Out of eater came food
Out of strong came sweetness

We held him, took his eyes, and bound to the brass locks
Destroyer of our land, we'll mock you as you fall down!
