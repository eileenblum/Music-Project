Green fields now painted black,
I can't go on and I can't go back
Long lost days of the past
Have to go over there, can I go over there at last?

Love, Lust, things that I've lost
Running from shadows but at what cost?
Trace far, back to my life
What was before the rain, what was it like before the strife

In the eyes of my dream I can look deep
And cherish the memory
Meadows grow back embraced in my story....

Home, friends, things that I miss
Snow on the mountains and skies of bliss
Strange tears guiding my way
Could it be happiness?
Could it be really here to stay?

In the eyes of my agony memories are written in stone
Finally I embrace them as my own

Through fire and torches of pain
I am the one who made it through the rain
The echoes are songs in my ear
I am the one who rose above the fear
Through fire and torches in pain
I am the one who made it through the rain
Look up, the sky is now clear
I am the one who fought so hard and made it here

Slow, fast, scars that run deep
Grasped like a treasure for us to keep
Blood, sweat, just flesh and bone
All of my choices were not in vain
Now they're mine alone

In the eyes of my agony...
Through fire and torches of painâ¦

And though the reaper awaits and the clock towers chime
I see the fire put out by the sands of time
