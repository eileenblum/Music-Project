I wait for gravity to show me how I cannot move
There are some secrets to the voice that I hear in my
head...
I dream to reach the stars, but honestly I cannot prove
That I can fly

Afraid of heights
I wait for the sun
I wait for the sun to burn my precious wings
For I won't fly at night
Washing away my dreams with the tides
In feathers and wax
I reach for the skies
Secretly hoping to burn and die
For failure is not an option

Oh, why would I dare to try?

We waited for this day so long that our minds have gone
Beyond the towering skies beneath our dreaded home
Stumbling on ivory dreams, delusional fantasies where we fly on...
On to the open fields
Where they belong
Hearts drawn to the distance
Minds lost in misery

Afraid of heights
I wait for the sun
I wait for the sun to burn my precious wings
For I won't fly at night
Washing away my dreams with the tides
In feathers and wax
I reach for the skies
Secretly hoping to drown and die
For failure is not an option

Let the winds take you high
Lift your eyes to the sky
And though dawn will come soon
You can still touch the moon
