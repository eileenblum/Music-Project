Close your eyes
You will only hear the silence in your mind
Falling down
In an endless pit of fire and despair
Every night
Is a tempest of dark mysteries inside
Fall asleep
Never knowing if you'll wake up again
Steep corridors within your brain

Twist and turn
With the truth and lies in your lonely bed
Raging thunders
Screech a hunting torment, tuned to drive you mad
Every night
Is a hell on earth, torture with no end
Fall asleep
Never knowing if you'll wake up again
Steep corridors within your brain

And I wish I could rise
On the wings of a dream
Not to drown in my fears

Onto the fight
Into the night
Hearing a melody
Trying to comfort me
Darkness will fall
Demons will rise
Wish I could open my eyes

Trying to open my eyes
And see through the disguise
Hunting for the demon I despise
Is there a plan to devise
To delay my demise
Before hope dies
