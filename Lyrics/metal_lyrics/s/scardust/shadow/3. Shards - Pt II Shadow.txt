Edge of insanity
Merging reality
Drifting humanity
The sin of vanity
Shattered duality
(preparing to fall)
Verge of brutality
Unfolding travesty
The great calamity
(I'm losing control)
Edge of insanity
(eyes rise towards the sky)
Shards of reality
Denouncing gravity
(my final goodbye)
The sin of vanity

Shadow, oh shadow, I finally hear
A voice once forgotten Â­ now crystal clear
Memories of grief are lies I deny
Now I see us both try

Shadow, oh shadow, perhaps I was wrong
The means for my dream were here all along
Please teach me how birds fly because I
Can see us both
Conquer the sky and rise
Into a dream
Up to the challenge
And though it may seem
Impossible, I know it's plausible
That we will
Fly
(run away)
AÂ­
(pave a way)
Way
(fly away)
(far away)

On to the open sea
Where we belong
When the wind takes us higher
We're hovering above it all
Through the velvet clouds
Rising towards the sun
Hearts drawn to the distance
Deceiving victory

Edge of insanity
(preparing to fall)
Merging reality
Drifting humanity
(I'm losing control)
The sin of vanity
Shattered duality
(eyes rise towards the sky)
Verge of brutality
Unfolding travesty
(my final goodbye)
The great calamity

Shadow, oh shadow, I must not fear
Our path is unclear, dawn's hour draws near
The haven of darkness will soon disappear,
Yet a voice still says
Cloudy nights shelter frail wings from the sun
Under the moon dreams can still carry on
Oceans of sunlight await you tomorrow
So fly
(hold on tight)
ToÂ­
(fear the light)
Night
(take your flight)
(to the night)

On to the open sea
Where we belong
When the wind takes us higher
We're hovering above it all
Through the velvet clouds
Rising towards the sun
Hearts drawn to the distance
Deceiving victory

Shattered duality
(preparing to fall)
Verge of brutality
Unfolding travesty
(I'm losing control)
The great calamity
Edge of insanity
(eyes rise towards the sky)
Shards of reality
Denouncing gravity
(my final goodbye)
The sin of vanity

The sights you wish to see
Having, loving, running free
Everything you wish could
Become reality
The birds outside your window
Never wait for gravity
