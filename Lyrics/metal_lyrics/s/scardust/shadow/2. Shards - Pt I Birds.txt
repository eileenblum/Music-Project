What lies beyond the door?
Sights that I have seen before
Urges I've been searching for
Can't reach them anymore
And birds outside my window
Shards of childhood memories

Through the window on the wall
I look down, afraid to fall
The shadow lays there tall
Scared I'll lose my soul
And birds outside my window
Shards of childhood memories
Though I still wait for gravity to stop and set me free

I remember my mother's tears as she wept upon my bed
My child, she said to me, trouble lies ahead
Now that voice starts to dissipate, so hard to recognize
A silhouette of what once was dims before my weary eyes
And a voice calls to me from inside
Must I live this miserable life?

Mockingbird sings my lullaby and then flies to another land
Leaving me with teardrops and feathers in my hand
I see the sun and the ocean far away and shining bright
And make them a promise that someday I will take my flight
And a voice calls to me from inside
Must I live this miserable life?

Who's that tapping on my door?
Just a shadow on the floor
Where are you? I implore
Can't sense my soul no more
And birds outside my window
Shards of fading memories
Yet I still wait for gravity to stop and set me free
