When sky turns blood red it comes from the abyss
Evil creation focusing the weak
Eviscerating the bodies taking one by one
Fulfilling their fate feasting on their agony
You are looking at me waiting for death
Begging for my final stroke your eyes fade away
Your heart stops beating your mind lost control

Praying for a grace and mercy your soul is forgotten by god
Praying for mercy and blessing your soul is forgotten
Praying for a grace and mercy your soul is forgotten by god
Praying for mercy salvation your soul is forgotten
Pain hate grow in me fate death came to you
Pain and hate grow in me fate and death came to you
