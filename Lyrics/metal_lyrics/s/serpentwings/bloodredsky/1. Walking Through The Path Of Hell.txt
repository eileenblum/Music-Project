Walking through the paths of hell through the graves of ashes
Lifetaking fright everlasting empire rapes the smiles
Evil eternity in your hopeless eyes body stays untouched soul falls into pieces

Take the lead and free your mind
Social depravity the end of an era
Can you feel the pain in your filthy hands
Covered in rust of scars this is your last scream
