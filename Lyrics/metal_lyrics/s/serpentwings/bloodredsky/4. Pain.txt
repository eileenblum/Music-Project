[Bonus Track]My throat is screaming all the time.
My enemies are trying to break me now.
My brothers are blind
They do not see my growing pain.
They are blind, my pain is fear.

Clench your fists when life starts its fall.
Clench your fists take your fear and conquer it.
Clench your fists when the enemy is coming back.
Clench your fists you will always have to fight.
