[originally by Gotye]Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me but felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it is an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I will admit that I was glad that it was over

But you did not have to cut me off make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing I do not even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
You did not have to stoop so low have your friends collect your records
And then change your number I guess that I do not need that though
Now you are just somebody that I used to know
Somebody I used to know
Somebody now you are just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I had done
But I do not want to live that way reading into every word you say you said that you could let it go
And I would not catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
