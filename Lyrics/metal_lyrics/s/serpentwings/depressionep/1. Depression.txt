Destroying from the inside,
Devouring my bright side.
Feeling causing depression.
Pain is leading nowhere hate is blinding my eyes.
Pain is leading nowhere hate is blinding my eyes.

I cannot give its name,
It is always the same.
Destroying from the inside.
Pain is leading nowhere hate is blinding my eyes.
Pain is leading nowhere hate is blinding my eyes.

I have forsaken you in the darkest hour of my life.
If you planned this place to be
The best place to live then your plan has failed.

I do not want to hide anything inside.
Everything is given black on white.
Pain is leading nowhere hate is blinding my eyes.
Pain is leading nowhere hate is blinding my eyes.
If you want deep meanings,
If you want some subtexts,
Go look for it somewhere else.
