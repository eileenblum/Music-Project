Everyone despise and laugh at him I see snakes crawling out of their mouths.
I see their eyes narrowing there is only pain and ignorance.
I see evil crawling to me I feel death it is coming.

When your time will come you know it will.
There will be only you and your fear.
You fell from grace there is no escape from here.
Writhe as snake and wait for judgement day.

When life means nothing and to live means to die.
New age is coming it is pouring in.
Into peopleâs lives into their brains.
I can see death, as it is clinging to me.
Footless beast is sticking to my face.
