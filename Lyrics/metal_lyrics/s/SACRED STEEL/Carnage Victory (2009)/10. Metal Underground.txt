84 was magic"Hammer" ruledMy lifeOh so tragicYoung and doomedThen beyond the giantsThere I foundMetal's gems lay hiddenUnderground All I amAll I wasAll I'll beI owe to thee HailMetal undergroundTo the heavy metal soundI am bound Hail Metal undergroundTo the heavy metal soundWe are bound Yeah "Hail to England" conqueredMy black soul In love then with "Melissa"I swore the oathSpellbound now foreverLive undeadSworn to live for metalThrashing mad
