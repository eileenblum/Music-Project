Welcome to a neverland of tortureStand in line for moreAre you brave enough little soldierTo kill and die at war Die for godBleed for himDie for JesusHe is king Calling outMy saviour he is thereI believe in magicAnd in heaven's golden lairChosen oneI marchI fight for truth(For) victory (and) VaticanI have sold my youth Crawl to your deathbedMercenary lostScream in the bloodshedNow you realize your soul must pay the costMortally woundedDie for your godCrosses stained with blood Welcome to the law of the jungleWelcome to the land of the beastSooner than you think you're the huntedM.I.A.Deceased Six feet under rotNeath crosses stained with blood All you ever lovedEver lived forVanished in the hazeAll you ever fearedIt has come trueOne last prayer to waste
