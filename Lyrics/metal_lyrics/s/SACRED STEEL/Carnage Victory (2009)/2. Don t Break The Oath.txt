Hear the call
Recite the words of power
On this night
On the thirteenth hour
Cleanse the air
Speak thy one desire
I am the who tempted christ
The liar

Renew the pact with hell
Give praise to satan

Don't break the oath
No
Never
Don't break the oath
In league with hell forever

Curse the lord
Defy all that is holy
Hail the goat
Sodomize virgin Mary
Holy ghost
(Mind) torture for the blessed
Swear the oath
Eternal world without end

Glowing eyes
Black shape
Black skull
Black horns
You are mine
As well as I am yours
Point at me
A gesture so demanding
I agree
Withing flames neverending
