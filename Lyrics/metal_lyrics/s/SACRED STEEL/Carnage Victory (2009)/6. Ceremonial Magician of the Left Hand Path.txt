Burn eternallySinful soulsDamned to hellTo perish here forevermoreIn his flames we must dwell From lifeThere is no escapeNever tryTo dieJust a hope in vainSuicide I believe in the devilFor his kingdom is hereI believe in the devilFor we are his children and we suffer here Burn internallyFeel his flames in thy fleshThe curse of immortalityRebirth after death Forgive me notFor I have sinnedForgive me notI will sin and sin again SatanFatherLord of this world of hellI am thy blood and fleshHumanEnslaved to the devil Lies Ceremonial magician of the left hand pathSpeak thy wordsIncantationsProtect me from God's wrath
