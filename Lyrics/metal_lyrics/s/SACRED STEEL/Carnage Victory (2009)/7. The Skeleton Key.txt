Come my childFull of prideWe have been waiting hereNow come inside my dearDon't you seeIt's all realYou just have to believe BloodHairSulfurCandleChalk and circle EyesFour eyes Don't you cryCarolineSay goodbye CarolineIt's time It's no dreamInsanityIt is blasphemyYeahIt's blasphemyTurn the keyOn this sacred nightOur magic right It's in your mindLordIt's time for sacriiceNow you seeYou believeWhere did you think you'll goThis house in theirsYou knowDarlingSoonI am youUp in the attic hereYou've sealed your doom my dear
