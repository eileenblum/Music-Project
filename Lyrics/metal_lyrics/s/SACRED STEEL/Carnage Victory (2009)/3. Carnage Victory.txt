All I see are ruins and despairWhat a sight of killing peaceA peace in shameNot a life worth living forHail the saviourHail the beast All hail the saviour What do you cling toEverything has diedAll your glory and your pride All that you lived for now has died Alive in ruinsWhen dreams have turned to dustAnd hopes are buried somewhere in the pastA life in ruinsDestruction's all I seeIt's carnage victoryYeah Here at the end of all your dreamsOf your religionOf your reignYou pay salute to the colours of our flagBut our enemy you'll stay YesOur enemy you'll stayAnd for sure one day we'll pay Victorious in carnageYou envy those who've died What price to pay when a nation's on it's kneesSacrificed on battlefieldsWhat price to pay when the sound of cannons fadeWhen carnage turns to victory Again it's carnage victoryAll hail the saviourHail the beast Among the ruinsAn orphaned childPeace through genocide
