My soul I won't sell I am the black flame within you allGod is the anvil on which my hammer fallsWar is ragingFueled by sinsHell's gates are openWelcome within By my own desire I must burnBy thy own desire you must burn with me I am hanging on the Judas treeBurn with meWithout my soul there'll be no victory for Christianity Call me liarYou say I amForever scapegoatForever damnedI'll take you with meI won't let goCome on my childrenIt's time to know Denial of JudasHeaven betrayed You fools are mortalYou must dieNo pearly gates awaitNo paradiseDeny heaven and choose hellNow come my childrenBurn with the damned Burn with me JudasArchfoe of heavenHell is thy fateDon't heed the warning Kill godHeaven betrayed Hell is the home of the brave
