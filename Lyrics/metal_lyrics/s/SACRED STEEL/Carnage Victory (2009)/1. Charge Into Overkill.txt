Headlong into warSing with gleaming eyesHymns your fathers sungJust before they died Madmen in controlTargets now are setThe end will soon unfoldWrath with no regret MarchMarch for liesDeath will riseShow no fearHell is here Charge into overkill Onward into fireBaptized in the roarBorn to feed the pyresBurning on each shore More souls for the graveWe all soon shall fallNo one's to be savedWar devours us all Bombs of death like rainFall to maimDestroyYour life turns to painDon't cry soldier boy
