Ride into the storm
Into the light
Today again we fight
No regret
By sunrise we attack

With no remorse
Slay for the gods

Ride into the fray
Carnage rules today
I must die
So be it tonight

None shall remain
All be the slain

For the king
For the crown
For revenge

By vengeance and hatred we ride
Blood will be shed 'neath the sky
Fate here today will decide

Who'll live or die

Ride into their rows
Leave a feast for crows
Thrashed
Smashed
Skulls and helmets crashed

Ride for prey
It is killing day
You must die
(We'll) take your fuckin' lives

You can run but not hide
Now you'll die

Vengeance
Hatred
Rise
