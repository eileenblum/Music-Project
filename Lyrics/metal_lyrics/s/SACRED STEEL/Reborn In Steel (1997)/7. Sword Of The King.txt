With the dying Breath of the Blind Witch came the Prophecy 
From the Land of Myth and Dreams into Reality 
From the old Kingdom of Magic the Griffin descends 
To bring the Sword of the Elder to the Ruler of Man 
Oh, hear the Valkries sing 
Your Life or Death they bring 
Your Future held within 
To bring forth the Sword of the King 
The Heir to the Throne is the Child of the Damned 
He must be stopped and fall 
Black is his Mind, black is his Soul 
He has come to bind us all 
He is the Fiend of the Pureness of Light 
The ancient Tyrant Son 
The Heir to the Throne must be killed and denied 
Defeat the Chosen One 
Die by my Sword and die by my Hand 
I will be Lord and the Ruler of Man 
Give Light to the Blind 
The End of the Tyranny 
Your Soul and Mind 
Will never be free 
Warriors unite 
Into Battle for Destiny 
Metal is Life 
Into War for the King 
Take their Children, take their Wives 
Take their Cities, take their Lives 
Leave 'em broken, hear my Spell 
Life on Earth shall be your Hell 
The Sword of the King
