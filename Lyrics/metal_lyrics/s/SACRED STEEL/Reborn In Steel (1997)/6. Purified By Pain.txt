Come scream to me 
End a Life made of Pain 
Confess to be free 
Come die for me 
Free your Mind, go insane 
My Wrath you shall feel 
Die for my Sorrow 
Torture my Game 
Death is my Right 
I shall kill tonight 
With no Hope in sight 
Perish in the... 
Name of the Beast 
On you I shall feast 
Then you are at least 
Purified By Pain 
Come cry for me 
Drive me wild with your Screams 
Now you know me well 
Relief's what you seek 
Helpless red mass of Meat 
See I am your Hell 
Beaten and tortured and slain 
Raping again and again 
Know that your Cries are in vain
