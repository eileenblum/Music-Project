Strike the weak Deceiver 
Let him taste the Iron Fist 
The Truth of strong Believers 
Will crush the Enemy 
Kill the Deceiver 
Deceivers must be dead 
Death to those who kill the Truth 
Die by our Attack 
True Force of Iron Glory 
Crash course of righteous Hate 
You know we feel no sorry 
When bones of Sinners break 
Sacred Steel Warriors 
To fight until the End 
Our Fate to feel the Truth of Steel 
While others just pretend 
We'll never stop to fight for Truth 
Metal is our way 
Deceivers die while we stand high 
And revel in their Pain 
Death - We bring Death 
Death - We kill the Deceiver 
DIE !!!
