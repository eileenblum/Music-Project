Comrade come, prepare for War 
The Field of Battle calling 
Unfold our Banner, Time has come 
Our Eve of Victory dawning 
Come face our Might and meet your Doom 
Our Curse of Death is upon you 
Our Axes tearing through your Shield 
Our Sword brings Victory 
Attack of Rage 
Pure Steel can only win 
Come feel the Pain 
Where Metal Reigns Supreme 
True Battle drink our Blood 
In Honour we praise thee 
Metal is our Glory 
Metal Reigns Supreme 
Take our side heading for Slaughter 
With Power breaking through their lines 
Strong Armies never falter 
To conquer - Fight or you must die
