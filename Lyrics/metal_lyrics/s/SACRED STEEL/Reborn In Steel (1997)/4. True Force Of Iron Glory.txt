The Sound of True Metal 
Religion and Force 
The grinding of Immortal Steel 
Is taking your course 
Surrender to Power 
And fall to your knees 
This Sanctuary of Might 
Will kill the disease 
Scream, fall, cry 
Do not repent or deny 
All die 
No time to run, time to hide 
True Force of Iron 
Glory of Steel 
Bonded by Metal 
Metal is all that is real 
Deliver pure Violence 
Deliver pure Speed 
We are the Victor, the Glory is ours 
Our Call you take heed
