Born into Metal, born into Steel 
Deep in the Heart of Darkness 
Metal is revealed 
Out of the Blackness to rule and to kill 
Those weak and false shall perish 
Taste the Sacred Steel 
See the Light, feel the Steel 
The mighty Power of the Iron Gods to wield 
Defenders of Salvation, Enemies of Night 
Soldiers of Fortune, Guardians... 
United by the Power, united by the Will 
Our Hearts are filled with Metal 
For Metal we kill 
Make the Dream come true, let the War begin 
You losers step aside 
For Sacred Steel has come to win 
See the Light, feel the Steel 
The mighty Power of the Iron Gods to wield 
Defenders of Salvation, Enemies of Night 
Soldiers of Fortune, Guardians of Light 
Believe in Magic, believe in Truth 
Believe in yourself and conquer Doom 
Believe in Suffering and all will heal 
As we deliver Sacred Steel 
Head on Steel Commander 
Lead us into the Fight 
Lead us into our Destination 
Victory and Might 
We came to kill 
Sacred Steel 
With Iron Will 
Sacred Steel
