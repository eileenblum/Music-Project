Steel forged in Fire 
Baptized in Blood 
The Flame soaring higher 
Given birth the Metal God 
Doom falls silent, Death draws near 
Bring on Vengeance, Pain and Fear 
Assault of Metal, Death is real 
Kneel and praise the Gods of Steel 
You are born to suffer 
You are born to bleed 
Your time is over 
The False One to be killed 
Righteous Slaughter, no more lies 
Time for Truth, the time to die 
Metalheads born to the Light 
Sons of Steel will kill tonight 
We are Reborn in Steel 
Born to be Heir to the King 
Foretold to be Rulers of Heaven and Earth 
We are Reborn in Steel 
Sworn not to bow, not to kneel 
Forever to rule, witness our Rebirth
