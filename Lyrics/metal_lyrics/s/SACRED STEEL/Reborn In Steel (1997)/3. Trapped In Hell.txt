Preparing virgin Sacrifice 
She's lying awake, the Fear of dying in her Eyes 
Trapped In Hell - There's no Salvation 
Whispered Screams turning to Cries of deep frustration 
He will take your Mind 
Your Life is in his hands 
Now watch the Dagger rise 
Beginning of the End 
Altar stained with crimson Life 
Her Blood is spilled to call forth Lucifer to rise 
Drowning in Pain, Desperation 
Awaiting Death and everlasting hell damnation 
Priest of Evil 
Chanting Praise again 
Maiden victim 
Die by his Command 
Preparing virgin Sacrifice 
She's lying awake, the Fear of dying in her Eyes 
Drowning in Pain, Desperation 
Awaiting Death and everlasting hell damnation 
Dark and grim Nightmare 
This Vision seems so real 
In his demonic Lair 
You're in for the Kill 
Giving Holy Blood 
Killing helpless prey 
Satan is your God 
And Death the price to pay 
Priest of Evil 
Chanting Praise again 
Maiden victim 
Now she burns in Hell 
A Whore for those who dwell 
In the Flames of Hell 
A Bride for those who fell 
Maiden trapped in Hell
