From the Pits of Hell 
A Legion of Hatred 
To break the Holy Spell 
All that is sacred 
In the midst of confusion 
Heat of the Battle 
An Angel in Armour 
The Power of Metal 
Warrior of Steel 
To fight the Deceiver 
You're in for the Kill 
A non-believer 
Wings stained with Blood 
Sword deadly Metal 
Come fight if you dare 
The Angel in Battle 
Battle Angel 
Slay with Wrath Divine 
Battle Angel 
Feel his Rage and die 
Ascending with Power and Might 
Wielding his Sword of Revenge 
See the Fire of Truth in his Eyes 
Destined to fight - Battle Angel 
Taking to the Sky 
Guardian in Glory 
In Grace so Divine 
And pure Victory 
Celestial Fighter 
Defender, Leader 
The Armies of Heaven 
Crushed the Deceiver 
Saviour from the Sky 
Stand and deliver 
Fight and never die 
Reign on forever 
You who brought us Steel 
Blessed us with Metal 
Forever blessed be 
The Angel of Battle 
On Wings made of Steel 
He flies through the Heavens 
He's stronger than ever before 
If your Heart is evil 
And your Soul is false 
Prepare to meet him in War
