Born is the new Bible 
Wretched Sanctity 
Gather the Disciples 
Madness reigns supreme 
Take heed, the new Religion 
Spreading like Disease 
The Hunter now the Victim 
The Elder Ones break free 
Gods of Fire, Gods from Space 
Terminate the Human Race 
Mankind fallen far from Grace 
Meet your Maker face to face 
And scream... 
In the Mouth of Madness 
Your World it drowns in Blackness 
Now gone is your Reality 
Replaced by Insanity 
Born the new Messiah 
Prophet of their Hate 
Return with mad Desire 
On through the black Church Gate 
Unleashed the final Terror 
Evil killing spree 
Face the ultimate Horror 
Sadistic Deities 
And scream... 
In the Mouth of Madness 
Scream... 
In the Mouth of Madness 
Scream... 
In the Mouth of Madness 
Scream...
