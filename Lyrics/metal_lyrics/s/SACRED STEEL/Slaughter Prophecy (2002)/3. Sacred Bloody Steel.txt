Hellbent my course
I'll never care avout your cries
So strong my force
This passion never ever dies
Some say I'm false
Some say I'm true as hell can be
When my fate calls
Upright I'll meet my destiny

I am not weak
I chose to walk this path alone
With iron in my heart  and metal in my soul

Steel runing through my veins
A life of leather, spikes and chains
Devotion pure and real
Stand strong for my belief
That guides me leads me through my dream
Of sacred bloody steel

No need to change
I live my dream Iv'e found my way
No debt to pay
March on while posers fall astray
All hail to steel
Come live your dream
No compromise
Unbound and free
Community of metal rise

Your hell is my heaven
Damnation destiny
Hell is my heaven
In my damnation I am free
Hell is my heaven
Damnation destiny
Hell is my heaven
In my damnation I feel
