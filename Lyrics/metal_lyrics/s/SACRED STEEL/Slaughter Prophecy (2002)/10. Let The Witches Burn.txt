Nightfall
Retaliation
The hour to strike
Grin faces show resolution by candlelight
Dark figures
Hooded madman
Prepared to slay
The circle of the witches will soon fall prey

It is the night
The signs are here
It is the night
Come show no fear

Witches burn - witches cry
Witches burn - witches die

Strike with righteous fury
Extinguish the plague
End thier unspeakable blasphemies with christian hate
They have taken our children
Cursed us with spells
Come join us in the chase
Send them to hell

Burn - let the withches burn - burn the withches

Spare none
Be fast and deadly
Avoid their eyes
Eradicate their wanton deeds that shame our minds
Then trample down
The unpure ashes
Anoint this place
Where we have killed for our lord father
Build a church of praise - Amen

Show no fear - Shed no tear
