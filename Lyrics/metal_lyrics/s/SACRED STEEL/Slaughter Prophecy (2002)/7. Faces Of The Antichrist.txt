Faces of the antichrist

Judgement is nigh
Lord let me die
I wish for death and you know the reason why
Horrors veset a sanity wrecked
I can no longer stand the vile beasts attack

He's in my mind
He's in my dreams
Oh lord he's everywhere
Won't you hear my screams

Satan - in that is I see his eyes
Evil faces of the antichrist
Satan - all around his kingdom lies

Evil faces of the antichrist (all around me)

I'm bound to sin
Satan within
I need to flog myself before lord satan wins
Dare not to think
Dare not to act
Their lore of hell for sure's a curse I must reject

Have mercy - set me free - have mercy - leave me be

I know not joy
I know not peace
For everywhere I sense the labour of the beast
Forgive my sin
I've lost the fight
Nearer my god to thee
Bless my suicide
