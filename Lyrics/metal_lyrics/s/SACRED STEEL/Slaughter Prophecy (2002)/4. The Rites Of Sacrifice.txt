Rites of death
Slaughter bekoning
Hearken to the call
Promised carnage
Day of rekoning
Crush their heaten skulls
To sooth the bloodgod
Women,children
All their kin must die
I proclaim the bloodshed summoning
It's my sacred right (on this sacred night)

Terror
Torture
Murder
Praise the god by rites of sacrifice

Screams and moans
Break their boans
So much blood is spilled
Their faith defiled
None left alive
Bloodlust unfulfilled
Our eyes be freed from blindness
Our kin be spared from death
Lord XU'TUL grant us marcy
we feed your ancient wrath
