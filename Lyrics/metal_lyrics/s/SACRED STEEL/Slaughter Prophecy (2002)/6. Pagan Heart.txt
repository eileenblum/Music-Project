Demons of nature in my veins
The old gods dwell within my brain
My mind and flesh deny the cross
Yes for your horde my soul is lost

Come god
Bow before me
Come god
Suffer unto me

A servant I'm no more
A sinner like before
A son of light and dark
Pagan heart

I defy the words you teach
And I despise the lies you preach
Abjured your lore so long ago
A pagan heart a pagan soul

Well all I feel for you is hate
For all that's tru you desecrate
At one with life
At one with death
At one with metal every breath
