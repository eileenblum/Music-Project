See us ride like thunder, our troops of doom are on the march
Nothing left but ruins : your glory's gone, your earth is scortched
There is no tomorrow for you : we bring new gods and kings
Your children born as servants ; now see : you've lost everything

War crimes - Eye for an eye

It's your fate, now pay the prize the conquered pay - Alone you stand
There's no choice as to the victor go the spoils - And you are damned
It's your fate, now you must swallow all dismay - We rule the land
And you must bow beneath the iron hand

The cannons now are silent and all you hear is our victory song
Our laws enforced upon you : your rights, your pride now dead and gone
Deported to our deathmines or stuck into our prison cells
Hunger, pain is your life, you won't escape this living hell

War crimes - Eye for an eye

It's your fate, now pay the prize the conquered pay - Alone you stand
There's no choice as to the victor go the spoils - And you are damned
It's your fate, now you must swallow all dismay - We rule the land
And you must bow beneath the iron hand

Women, daughters forced to please
Your leaders broken on their knees
Your homeland is no more your land
Now die beneath the iron hand

Die! Die Die beneath the iron hand!
Die! Die Die beneath the iron hand!

You gather in the darkness, an army ready for the fight
To seek revenge for terror, to strike us down with hate tonight
This will be your last battle, yet you prefer to die like men
We'll slay you like your cattle, none shall survive to fight again

War crimes - Eye for an eye

It's your fate, now pay the prize the conquered pay - Alone you stand
There's no choice as to the victor go the spoils - And you are damned
It's your fate, now you must swallow all dismay - We rule the land
And you must bow beneath the iron hand

It's your fate, now pay the prize the conquered pay - Alone you stand!
There's no choice as to the victor go the spoils - And you are damned!
It's your fate, now you must swallow all dismay - We rule the land!
And you must bow beneath the iron hand!!
