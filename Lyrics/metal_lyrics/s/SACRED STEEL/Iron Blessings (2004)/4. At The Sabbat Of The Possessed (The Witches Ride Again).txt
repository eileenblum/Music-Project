The moon is cold and bright, it's the only light
A dark procession's marching through the night
In the dark they meet where the shadows creep
And the ghosts of midnight haunt the walls of sleep

It's the sacred night when the witches ride
Can't you hear the chanting moaning in the air?
It is time, confess! Ye are all possessed
Women, children, allies : come for he is there

Come for he is there! The master's there!
Come for he is there! Satan's there!

Join the sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Holy sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Join the sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Holy sabbat - It is time to confess

The ritual has began : they sing the holy song
Inverting all the rites the priests name holy
Cleanse the air by fire, light the hellish pyre
Nothing sacred left untouched, unburning
North, south, east and west, no, thou shall not rest
For the master has returned to judge thee
It is time confess! Thou art possessed
Women, children, allies : come for him

Come for he is there! The master's there!
Come for he is there! Satan's there!

Join the sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Holy sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Join the sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Holy sabbat - It is time to confess

Behold thy king - Of his glory sing

I am thy king - Rest beneath my wings

From the smoke arise - Ancient lord of flies
Bow before the shadows of the horns
In his eyes you see greatness, misery
And thy heart it stops now as he points at thee
Will you stand the test : it is life or death
Have you failed or are you worth of being
It is time, confess! No, thou shall not rest
All thy time you'll spend to serve his biding

Come for he is there! The master's there!
Come for he is there! Satan's there!

Join the sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Holy sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Join the sabbat - Sabbat of the possessed
Holy sabbat - It is time to confess
