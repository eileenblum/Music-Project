Welcome to your nightmare fools, I am your god insane
Now dance my toys like puppets that are hanging on a string
I am the answer to your prayers, the lord you love so deep
I am the fear in man, I feast upon the souls of sheep

I created heaven then I gave you Hell
Don't care about your pleas as long as you fools serve me well
I gave you pain but you won't see that my love is a lie
I rule in heaven while you long in vain for paradise

I have come for you again, I have come for you again

I am the truth you won't believe
I am the conqueror, come and worship me
I am the way to misery
I am the conqueror, come and worship me

Welcome to your nightmare fools, I am your god insane

I am the answer to your prayers, the lord you love so deep
I am the fear in man, I feast upon the souls of sheep

I created heaven then I gave you Hell
Don't care about your pleas as long as you fools serve me well
I gave you pain but you won't see that my love is a lie
I rule in heaven while you long in vain for paradise

I have come for you again, I have come for you again

I am the truth you won't believe
I am the conqueror, come and worship me
I am the way to misery
I am the conqueror, come and worship me

Come and worship me! You fools
Come and worship me! You're doomed
Come and worship me! My prey
Come and worship me!

I have come for you again, I have come for you again

I am the truth you won't believe
I am the conqueror, come and worship me
I am the way to misery
I am the conqueror, come and worship me

I am the way to misery
I am the conqueror, come and worship me
