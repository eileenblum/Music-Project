Heavy as fuck indeed - We're metal to the bone
Scourge of you hypocrites - United we stand strong
To tell you once again - Our spite you'll get for this
We are your hell on earth - Repay the Judas kiss

Don't you know what waits for you
The mirror shows the final truth

We die!
But we die fighting
We die!
But we die fighting
We die!
But we die fighting
We die! We fight and die!
But we die fighting

Your lies we shall deface - We'll show the world you're wrong
We'll face you once again in battle - Come along
And if we die, we know we fought for our belief
It is now all for one - In victory or defeat!

Don't you know what waits for you
The mirror shows the final truth

We die!
But we die fighting
We die!
But we die fighting
We die!
But we die fighting
We die! We fight and die!
We die fighting

In death you'll find the truth! In death you'll find the truth!

The end is drawing near - Our call to arms be heard
We'll stand and fight for truth - In heaven, Hell, on earth
Our weapon : sacred steel - Now taste the bloodred sword
Crushed by the battle axes - Blessed by the lords!

Don't you know what waits for you
The mirror shows the final truth

We die!
But we die fighting
We die!
But we die fighting
We die!
We die fighting
We die! We fight and die!
We die fighting! We die fighting! Die!!
