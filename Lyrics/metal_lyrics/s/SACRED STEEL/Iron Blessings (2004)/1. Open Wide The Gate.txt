Open wide the gate!!!

The final dawn - I am drawn into the storm
The black gates of the black abyss await
The smoke of burning is rising from the crypt
The cursed torch of my soul's damnation's lit
I am falling towards the onyx citadels
Towering above the sacred city hell
A pandemonium devoid of wretched light
Enjoy the cold embrace of neverending night

This is what shall come to be
Torment! Suffering!
In my vision doom's revealed
I rejoice in sin!

Guilty as charged, guilty as charged - On the left hand path I walked
Bound and damned, bound and damned - Sent to Hell by his command
I am free, yes I am free - Though I am burning endlessly
Seal my fate tyrant lord - Open wide the gate!
Open wide the gate!

The dark lord of the black abyss awaits
Chained by sorrow up in heaven sing
Still loyal angels hymns to god, their tyrant king
Decrepit leader - May you reign in your despair
You know the time has come to share your treasures fair
Your power's lost when the last soul won't repent
The golden age will rise of our world without end

This is what shall come to be
Torment! Suffering!
In my vision doom's revealed
I rejoice in sin!

Guilty as charged, guilty as charged - On the left hand path I walked
Bound and damned, bound and damned - Sent to Hell by his command
I am free, yes I am free - Though I am burning endlessly
Seal my fate tyrant lord - Open wide the... gate!
The gate!

They told me that you love me - All I feel is hate
Open wide the gate!

The dark lord of the black abyss awaits
Chained by sorrow up in heaven sing
Still loyal angels hymns to god, their tyrant king
Decrepit leader - May you reign in your despair
You know the time has come to share your treasures fair
Your power's lost when the last soul won't repent
The golden age will rise of our world without end

This is what shall come to be
Torment! Suffering!
In my vision doom's revealed
I rejoice in sin!

Guilty as charged, guilty as charged - On the left hand path I walked
Bound and damned, bound and damned - Sent to Hell by his command
I am free, yes I am free - Though I am burning endlessly
Seal my fate tyrant lord - Open wide the... gate!
