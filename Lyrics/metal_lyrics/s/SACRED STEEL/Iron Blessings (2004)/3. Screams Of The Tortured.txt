Screams, I hear screams... Everywhere!

Screams of the tortured haunt me night and day
There is no release, they just won't go away
Memories of these nights of hell always stay with me
God please take away the pain, all I hear is their screams

It was dark and cold back then in these cells of fear
No thought of sleep - Cacophony of cries and bloody tears
The moaning and the crying - Would I be the next they'll take?
I tried, but no : I just could not ignore the sounds of rape

All I hear is their screams
Screams of the tortured - I hear screams

Battered, bruised and beaten, I was lying on the floor
Listening to the voices yell beyond the prison door
I thought that I was doomed - I'd never leave this place alive
So many of my friends and inmates already had died

Can you imagine what it's like to be a helpless toy
Humiliated just for fun - Mistreated with joy
And all you see and all you hear is pain and agony
I bet you'll go just insane - Like the broken me

All I hear is their screams
Screams of the tortured - I hear screams

Give me strength oh god above, strength to make it through
I'll endure this torture, just to kill the pigs for you

Screams of the tortured haunt me night and day
There is no release, they just won't go away
Memories of these nights of hell always stay with me
God please take away the pain, all I hear is their screams

Can you imagine what it's like to be a helpless toy
Humiliated just for fun - Mistreated with joy
And all you see and all you hear is pain and agony
I bet you'll go just insane - Like the broken me

All I hear is their screams
Screams of the tortured - I hear screams
