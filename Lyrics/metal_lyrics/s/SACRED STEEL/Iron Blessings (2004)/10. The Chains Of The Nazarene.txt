[Part I: Divine Damnation]

[Vengeful Angel:]
I have come down from heaven, I bear the key to the pit
And with this great chain in my hand I shall lay hold on the dragon called Satan

[The Fallen Angel:]
Is this your justice? My divine damnation
If this is your wish then so be it, but my mind's still free
I'm still free

[Part II: Thorns Of Christ]

Wrath, pain and scorn, they rage within
I spoil your dreams of heaven with dreams of sin
So I was damned with hope betrayed
To crawl, repent and suffer - Yes, I was made

Thorns in my side, the thorns of the saviour's pain!

Won't you save me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
Won't you free me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
The chains of the Nazarene

Drag me down into the pit
For your self-destruction I must bleed
Churches of blood for crimson saints
My altar of damnation devoid of praise

Thorns in my side, the thorns of the saviour's pain!

Won't you save me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
Won't you free me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
The chains of the Nazarene

I am bound forever again
I am trapped to curse and fear your name
In a world of free will denied
Seeking for a cure to conquer Christ
I'll live when he has died

Nail the crown unto his head
Burn him at the cross to make sure he's dead
Ram in the spear, open his side
Lies of Hell and death fade with the crucified

Thorns in my side, the thorns of the saviour's pain!

Won't you save me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
Won't you free me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
The chains of the Nazarene
Won't you save me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
The chains of the Nazarene
Won't you free me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
Hell's chains!...
