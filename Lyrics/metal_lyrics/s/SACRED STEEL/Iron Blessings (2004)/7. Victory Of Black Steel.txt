Back from the dead - Out of Hell's gate
We are the force - We are the hate
Destiny calls - Onward to death
Fall to the sound - Wake up the dead

Torn from chaos - The horned god
Up from the grave - None shall be saved

A cult in steel reborn - Thou must hail
Our prophecy of slaughter did not fail
In bloodlust we have served the wargods' will
Blessings of iron forged the victory of black steel

Law of the blade - Wargods of hate
Crawl to your cross - Faith I have lost
It is my will - Fighting to kill
Damned by the black - Doomed to attack

Torn from chaos - The horned god
Up from the grave - None shall be saved

A cult in steel reborn - Thou must hail
Our prophecy of slaughter did not fail
In bloodlust we have served the wargods' will
Blessings of iron forged the victory of black steel

Crush the light - Breathe the dark
All ye children bear my mark
All your pain becomes my joy
Those who oppose we shall destroy!

Back from the dead - Out of Hell's gate
We are the force - We are the hate
Destiny calls - Onward to death
Fall to the sound - Wake up the dead

Torn from chaos - The horned god
Up from the grave - None shall be saved!!

A cult in steel reborn - Thou must hail
Our prophecy of slaughter did not fail
In bloodlust we have served the wargods' will
Blessings of iron forged the victory of black steel

A cult in steel reborn - Thou must hail
Our prophecy of slaughter did not fail
In bloodlust we have served the wargods' will
Blessings of iron forged the victory of black steel

Victory of black steel!
