Death and blood...
Blood and death...
Death and blood...
Blood and death...

Black steel is sacred, your faith it is not : how can you believe in the lie?
A doctrine all built on the slaughter of millions by fire and sword christianized
Through centuries of torture you twisted the truth, the mother of all you have raped
The laws of your god, sacrilege against nature, abolish your rules and your state
Exterminate!

Bloodshed! Anointed by bloodshed
Bloodshed! Death to lies
Bloodshed! Anointed by bloodshed
Bloodshed! Your plague dies

Death : the beginning of a new society without the threat of the cross
A new hope for all of the lost souls in search for the road to your paradise lost
You don't need a heaven, you don't need a purgatory : why waste your life on false guilt?
We all may be sinners - If sinners we are, with joy and with lust we will win
Come let us sin!

Bloodshed! Anointed by bloodshed
Bloodshed! Death to lies
Bloodshed! Anointed by bloodshed
Bloodshed! Your plague dies

Death and blood...
Blood and death...

Bloodshed! Anointed by bloodshed
Bloodshed! Death to lies
Bloodshed! Anointed by bloodshed
Bloodshed! Your plague dies
