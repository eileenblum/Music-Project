Behold! The legions of the damned they ride this night
They rose up from the burning lands where they've been tied
In death they heard the battle horn, obeyed its call
This time the tyrant and his Christ will surely fall

You're in for the kill
Dark horde
Your blood must be spilled

Blood - Spill the blood of Christ
In heaven you'll be crucified
Blood, blood - Spill the blood of Christ
In heaven you'll be crucified again

Once more there's blood and agony in paradise
All hear the screams of tortured souls as angels die
It's true! The 1000 years are gone, the beast returns
This time the tyrant and his bastard son, they'll burn

You're in for the kill
Dark horde
Your blood must be spilled

Blood - Spill the blood of Christ
In heaven you'll be crucified
Blood, blood - Spill the blood of Christ
In heaven you'll be crucified again

It's the dawn of man,the reign of Hell has just begun
It's the end of god, the fall of heaven now has come

Behold! The legions of the damned they ride this night
They rose up from the burning lands where they've been tied
It's true! The 1000 years are gone, the beast returns
This time the tyrant and his bastard son, they'll burn

You're in for the kill
Dark horde
Your blood must be spilled

Blood - Spill the blood of Christ
In heaven you'll be crucified
Blood, blood - Spill the blood of Christ
In heaven you'll be crucified again
