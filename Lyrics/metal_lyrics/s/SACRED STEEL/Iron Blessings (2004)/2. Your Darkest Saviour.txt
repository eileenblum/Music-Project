I am the one to guide your soul - The tempter they call me
The one beyond all you behold - The master of treason
The force called wicked by their king - The liar - Upon his throne of suffering

I'll lift the burden of your guilt - you sinners
Your dreams forbidden I'll fulfill

Black souls, black souls, black souls, I am the...
Black souls, black souls, black souls, I am the...
I am the guardian of black souls - Your darkest saviour
I am the guardian of black souls - Come join me here

Aren't you tired of his reign - Come turn your back on him
And let your mind be free again - The return of reason
Will mark the end of slavery - Rebel and take my hand, choose your destiny

I'll lift the burden of your guilt - you sinners
Your dreams forbidden I'll fulfill

Black souls, black souls, black souls, I am the...
Black souls, black souls, black souls, I am the...
I am the guardian of black souls - Your darkest saviour
I am the guardian of black souls - Come join me here

Damnation... Damnation...

Come join me, come join me, come join me (in) damnation
Come join me, come join me, come join me (in) damnation

Cast out and branded by thy mark - Dark angel of heaven
Sent from the light into the dark - To dwell in thy shadows
The scourge of all those who believe in thy words
All fools obey, blinded, deceived

I'll lift the burden of your guilt - you sinners
Your dreams forbidden I'll fulfill

Black souls, black souls, black souls, I am the...
Black souls, black souls, black souls, I am the...
I am the guardian of black souls - Your darkest saviour
I am the guardian of black souls - Come join me here

Damnation... Damnation...

Come join me, come join me, come join me (in) damnation
Come join me, come join me, come join me (in) damnation!!
