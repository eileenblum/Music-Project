To the shelter -Tonight it's said
More bombs will fall - Metal death from heaven
Better be quick when you hear the siren call
Just take what's needed
There's not much room
There's not much air
We will all be silent
Avoid the panic - We all are scared

Pray to heaven
All we can do when all our hope is lost
Pray to heaven
We'll not be buried here
Entombed in dust

When the siren calls - When the siren calls

In the shelter
You can feel safe
Just for a while
Stare into the darkness
Trick of the mind - You see the devil smile
Outside they're screaming
We've locked the door to where we hide
Ignore their knocking - Let no one in
Ignore their cried

Pray to heaven - These walls may hold
These walls may just stay strong
Pray to heaven
That one more day we'll see the rising sun

Let us pray - Let us pray as one
Let us pray for his kingdom come
Let us pray that this night won't be our last
Let us pray - Let us sing his song
Let us pray that this night of horror's passed
Let us pray - Let us pray
