Born into metal born into steel
deep in the heart of darkness
metal is revealed
out of the blackness to rule and to kill
those weak and false shall perish
taste the sacred steel

See the light feel the steel
the mighty power of the iron gods to wield
defenders of salvation enemies of night
soldiers of fortune guardians of light

United by the power united by the will
our hearts are filled with metal
for metal we kill
make the dream come true let the war begin
you losers step aside
for sacred steel has come to win

Believe in magic believe in truth
believe in yourself and conquer doom
believe in suffering and all will heal
as we deliver sacred steel

Head on steel commander
lead us into the fight
lead us into our destination
victory and might

We came to kill
sacred steel
with iron will
sacred steel
Sacred Steel Sacred Steel
