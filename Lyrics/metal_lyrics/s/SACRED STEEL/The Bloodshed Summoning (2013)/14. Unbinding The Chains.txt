Creatures of darkness - Beyond guiding light
SPawn of your fear and despair
Gathering strength - Prepare for the fight

And you feel it - We are near
This is the end of your world

Judgement awaits in the shadows
From judges spewn forth from hell
Ring the black bell of destruction
Unbiding the chains with my spell

The children of cain - Unbiding the chains
By fire and flame - Unbiding the chains

Soldiers of madness - Assassins of night
Preaching false gospels of hope
With love in their hearts but hate in their eyes

And the killing begins
And the suffering reigns
And the children are born into hell never known
When one tyranny falls and another one starts
Then terror is king
