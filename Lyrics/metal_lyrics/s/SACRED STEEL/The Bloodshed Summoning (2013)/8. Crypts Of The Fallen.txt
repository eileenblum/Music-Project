Here is no heaven - Here is no light
Here only darkness awaits

Jin us in darkness - Banned from the light
Here were the undead unwanted remain
Crypts of the fallen - Beyond grace and time
Forever immortal - Forgotten in shame

Crypts of the fallen - Welcome to hell
Crypts of the fallen - Where sinners dwell

Unborn - Aborted - Cast out from their minds
Your mothers and fathers - They deny your names
Children of heaven - You pay for their crimes
Eternal damnation i undying flames

Here is no heaven - Here is no light
Here in the darkness the fire awaits

Fall down into the crypts and burn with us
