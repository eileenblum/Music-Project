This is Hell on Earth
Demons of the fire given birth
fields of screaming pain
unto the future corpses falls the rain
death like hammerblows
leaving only flesh and mangled bones
Heaven has turned to red
march into the flames - no turning bac

where is your glory - life it turns to ash
hail of sharp metal - then comes the gas
where once was beauty - wasteland remains
war is your duty - die where fire reigns

Storm of fire
there is no escape from the real of firestorm
Storm of fire
there is no escape from the real of firestorm

One more friend is shot
stumble over corpses - over mud
kiss the boiling ground
Rise - Dance to the bullets' sound
'neath the blackened sun
cower to hide from the machine gun
throw your last grenade
as the world explodes you meet your fate

fire - fire - fire
into the realm of fire
into the realm of firestorm
