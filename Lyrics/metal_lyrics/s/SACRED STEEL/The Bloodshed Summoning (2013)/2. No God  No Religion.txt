You say I'm evil - From your point of view that's right
I praise Lord Satan while it's you who've seen the light
I'm bound to hell while heaven waits for you to come
And all I say won't change your mind 'cause I am wrong

I don't see what's my crime - I'm human just like you
I don't feel god inside and all I see is doom

I have my doubts but I am pretty sure there's not
Such splendid deity like your beloved god

I've tried to praise the father
Son and holy ghost
But then life taught me
That they do not love me most

No god no religion
I'm sorry but I don't believe

We were born - We will die
And there's no reason why
Keep your faith to yourself
Let me live my life in hell

Fuck off

No god - No god - No god and no religion

I've tried to praise the father - Son and holy ghost
I'd rather praise Lucifer's friend or Satan's host

I think that when I'm dead I'll just be dead again
I will return to where I've been before the pain
