His blood was shed for all your sins
Redeem you now from the power of Satan
Repent ye and believe the gospel
Let the wicked forsake his way in the end

I am the way
I am the truth
I am life

Perversions of the scriptures
Hail not the whore
Just bow to christ

Remember the lord's sacrifice
Oh precious lamb
From the cold grave he rose
Time is fulfilled
Behold his kingdom
Thou shalt be saved
The heathen soul
It is damned
