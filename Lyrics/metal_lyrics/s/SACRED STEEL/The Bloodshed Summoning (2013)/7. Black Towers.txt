White eyes of the devil stare at me
And I dream of black towers of steel
Underneath a bloodred sun my fate is sealed
And I see the bible burn for me

I bear thy sins in my flesh
I am a nail in the cross that points to black towers

Winged demons fly over black towers
Empty cathedrals and black towers
Priests of the cross bow to black towers
All hail the age of the beast

Witness the lambs of god become black sheep
All his flock converting to the beast
Led astray - The faith of lies no longer lives
On this day that nemesis besieged

Black towers

Receive the mark - Sign the pentagram
Disciple of love - Love under will
