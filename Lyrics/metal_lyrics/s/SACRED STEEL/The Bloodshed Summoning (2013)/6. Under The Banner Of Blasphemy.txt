Religion is the enemy - Unholy plague
As long as there is blind belief - Things will not change
How can you still believe in gods - Main cause for wars
Why don't really start to think - Deny what's false

Put an end to misery and render hope
To those infected by disease - Science enthroned
It's time for reason to arise - Put faith to death
Fight superstition with atheistic wrath

Brothers of disbelief unite
Under the banner of blasphemy to destroy heaven
Crush the holy - Rip the skies

It's time to rise - It's time to fight

Under the banner of blasphemy
Tear al icons down - Grind them to the ground
No more holy wars - No masters and no gods

Unite in blasphemy - Unite

To the death
