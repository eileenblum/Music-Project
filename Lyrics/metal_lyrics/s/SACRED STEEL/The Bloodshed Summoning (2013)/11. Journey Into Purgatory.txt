Into the void - I'm soaring higher
Tomb of blackness in my mind

I am alone - Here with my soul
Am I at home at last

Wherever this may lead me - Whatever I'll come to be
Fool reborn or laid to rest
Whomever shall remember - My passing each december
Recite for me the rites of death

I'm drifting on - To purgatory - To salvation I am blind

Send my soul to heaven - Or down to hell forever

Naked - SHivering - On the brink of eternity
Flesh torn with iron claws

I have done nothing wrong
God - Tell me what I've done
In here I don't belong at all
In darkest misery - I'm screaming
Set me free
Won't someone hear my desperate call

Wretched soul
Descending down into the night
Hell - It is a state of mind
With hellish powers reconciled
Purgatory's opened wide

Unrepentant - Here my path it ended
Tortured and tormented - SPeak to me

Here you are welcome - Sinner
With no regret within you
What you have sown
You shall reap
