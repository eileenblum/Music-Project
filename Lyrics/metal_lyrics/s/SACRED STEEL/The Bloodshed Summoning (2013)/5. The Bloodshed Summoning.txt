Lay your hands on me - Cure my brain's disease
Watch me speak in tongues - Command the enemy

And these signs shall follow them that believe
In my name cast out him - Be free from sin
And if you drink poison it shall not hurt
A ritual so sacred within our church

Quote from the book of luke and mark
Believe and you'll suffer no harm

Snake handling worshipper - Tread on serpents
Come sister - Don't fear now - Grab with both hands

Great miracles and wonders done
Pentecostals 'til kingdom come

Raise your hands up to the sky
Praise Lord Jesus way up high
Raise your hands up to the sky - Tonight

Rejoice and dance and sing - The Bloodshed Summoning

I embrace the serpent - More power unto thee
I trust in the holy spirit - Descend and intervene

Rejoice and dance and sing - The Bloodshed Summoning
Fear not their bite nor sting - The Bloodshed Summoning
