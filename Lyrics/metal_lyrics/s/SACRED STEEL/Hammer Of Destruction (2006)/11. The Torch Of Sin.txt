Born within the heart of Rock 'n Roll - Heaviness
Implanted in a horde of hungry souls - Starved to death
Torn out from the dark into the light - A force revealed
Torn apart the lies you've had inside - By black steel

It is done - The plague is unleashed
It is done - We broke the seal

We bear the torch - The torch of sin
As hymns of praise to steel we sing
We bear the torch - Black fires rage
The torch of sin - It burns to light our ways

Have you heard the voice of steel within - It is there
Have you ever felt the touch of sin - Tempting - Fair
Are you sure you have not seen the light - See it shine
The torch of sin is burning in the night - Heed the sign

[Solo: Jonas]

Does Satan hold the future of us all - I think not
Who pulls the strings - Are we doomed to fall - Damned by God
We don't care - We just do what we please - In this hell
Don't need a cure for what you call disease - Fuck yourself
