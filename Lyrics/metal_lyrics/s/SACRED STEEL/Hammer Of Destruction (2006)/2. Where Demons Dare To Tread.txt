Raging inside me - Demons of the past
I am a madman - spells can never last
Possessed by theythm - metal in my blood
No exorcism an heal me - in hell I will rot

You can not save me from my demons

There is no hope no more
Iâm more addicted than before
There is no hope no more

Music inside me - echoes of my dreams
I am forlorn - you know just what I mean
A lifetime of metal - I can - I will not change
Iâd do this all again - there is no other way

In hell I must pay for my demons

There is no hope no more
25 years of metal war
There is no hope no more

Demons haunt my soul - they speak to me
Spirits take control â donât set me free
Metal made me whole - it is my god
It is my soul - it is my blood
