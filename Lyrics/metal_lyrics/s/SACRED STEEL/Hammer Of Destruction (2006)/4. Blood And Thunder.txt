Trapped in hell and purified by pain
High above the witches ride again
By the wrath of the unborn we rise
Unfettered from the bindings of Christ

Victory of Black Steel - Iron Legions march
Open wide the brimstone gate
Break the Spell of death by blood and thunder

Blood is on my steel - for more I lust
My dark pagan heart blessed by the gods
When I fall then lay me to my grave
In life and death - master of my fate

Victory of Black Steel - Iron Legions march
Open wide the Gates of hell
Break the spell of death by blood and thunder

Crucified in heaven is their king
Pierced and torn by sacred bloody steel
Priests perform the rites of sacrifice
The oath of blood is sworn to let them die

Crush the holy - save the damned from hell
Carnage rules the battlefields itself
Dethrone the tyrant king who reigns supreme
You darkest saviourâs slaughter prophecy

Victory of black steel - Iron legions march
Open wide the brimstone gate
Break the Spell of death by blood and thunder
