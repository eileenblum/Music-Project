Each sinner a nail in the myth of the grail
I can not forget nor forgive â donât forgive
I spit on the lie - I spit on your Christ
If now I must burn - so be it

Black is the well - the black soul of hell
I hear them calling my name - come join us here
Enter the lair â theyâre waiting there
In this nocturnal domain

The Black Church - welcome neopythe
Become one with the night

Hell is my home - hell is my throne
I am a soul in the pit â donât forgive
Detached from God - I fell unto Satan
My pyre of damnation was lit

No need to bow - no need to repent
I roam in here with my friends
The fools of the grail - yes - they have failed
Their lord of hosts - nailed again

Aeterne rerum conditor, noctem diemque qui regis,
Et temporum das tempora, ut alleves fastidium

Hoc excitatus lucifer, solvit polum
