Behold the writing on the wall - sceptics watch in awe
Scriptures ancient and forbidden - unveiling the law

Itâs the dawn of fate - forever you are now enslaved
Itâs the dawn of fate - forever - you can not be saved

Mass destruction - Mind corruption
Architects of Death and Fear

Yield to hell - succumb to horror
For your soul - no tomorrow
Hail to them - spread the seed
Maniacs of power and speed

Signs of death - apocalypse - in doomâs face you stare
You can see them fast descending - the new gods are here

Arise - Merchans of Deceit
Arise - For the Gods you bleed
