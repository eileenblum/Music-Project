Sword and axes - Until we die

Striking force - Uncompromising steel
An entity born of conviction - Oh so real
An entity born out of dedication pure
Come watch us play - See what I mean for sure

You all shall be hacked or slain or torn
Submit to mutilation - In the carnage be reborn

Sword and axes - Raise the banner high
Sword and axes - Into the sky
Sword and axes - Let our banner fly
Sword and axes - Until we die

Metal horde - We are part of thee
We're all the same - Knights bound by blood and blasphemy
We're all the same - For in our hearts we bear the grail
Black grail of steel - Thy power we hail

Heart - Soul and mind - Hellbent for metal
Metal is life - Metal's alive
