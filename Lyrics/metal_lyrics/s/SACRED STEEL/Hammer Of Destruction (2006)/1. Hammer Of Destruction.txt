Axes - like Sirens - Slicing through the Air
You run for shelter - this hell you can not bear
Pounding Inferno - Pure Steel inside black veins
Where demons dare to thread - heavy metal reigns

Death falls from the Sky
Thereâs no escape - you die

Hammer of Death - Hammer of hate
Bloodhammer of destruction - pound to desecrate
Hammer of war - Hammer of Sin
Bloodhammer bring destruction - carnage victory

Obey the Law of the hammer of destruction

We are free to do just what we will
Our destiny - charge into overkill

This is the law - no compromise - no fucking way
Just truth - no lies â itâs judgement day
Now choose your side â thereâs just one way
From death comes live
Now bang your head and go fucking insane

Steel bolts of lightning shooting through your hearts
Impaled by metal â itâs that the burning starts
Enraged by anger you raise your fists to the sky
Bonded as brothers weâll remain - until the day we die

Obey the Law or the hammer - or the hammer - falls on you
