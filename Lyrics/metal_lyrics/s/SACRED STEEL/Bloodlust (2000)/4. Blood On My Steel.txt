[PART II OF THE 'TRILOGY OF BLOOD']

(The newborn Crimson King tangled in the Fangs of the most hideous Nightmare) 
([THE EMPEROR:] "A Vision is calling me ! Revealing the most sinister Dream within a Dream ! I love her since the Days of the Rising of the Three Suns, since the Birth of the Stars. She is my predestined Queen, my Priestess and Goddess. The sight is breathtaking !") 
"Red Fire... Shroud of Mist... Visions of Virgin Grace... (tears are streaming from her angelic Countenance !) 
My Dark Queen, force-taken (her Lips utter my Name !)... His foul breath on her Face !" 
"Every fibre of my Heart is screaming... (Release her and taste my Blade !) 
Stop the torture of a sad soul dreaming... (I am the helpless watcher in this sadistic game !) 
...And it's tearing me apart !!! (I shall rape and desecrate your Spirit forever !) 
Every fibre of my (now frost-bitter) Heart is bleeding !" 
"I see her... I feel her ! Enraged in mad Despair ! (This shall never be forgiven !!!) 
I'll find you ! I'll kill you ! To thee Revenge I swear !" 
(The holy Blood-Oath of the now insane God-King:) 
"You will die (a slow, tormenting, everlasting Death) !
BLOOD ON MY STEEL !
This night I'll enjoy your screams... (over and over again...) 
In the Rage of Battle I shall kill (I shall revel in the righteous Pleasure and grim Satisfaction of your Agony !) 
With BLOOD ON MY STEEL !" 
"You want me, leave her be ! I'm here so fight face to face ! (COWARD ! BASTARD ! LIAR !) 
I challenge thee ! Come wicked King ! Come dare to meet your Disgrace !" 
"BLOOD ON MY STEEL !
BLOOD ON MY STEEL !
BLOOD ON MY STEEL !
BLOOD ON MY STEEL !" 
("Then the Vision mercifully fades and leaves me broken and bleeding... and crying... thirsting for Revenge !")
