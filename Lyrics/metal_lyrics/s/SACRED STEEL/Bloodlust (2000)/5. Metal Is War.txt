[THE ARMY OF A'RYTH-RA:]

"Marching 'neath the Banner of the Bloodstained Sword
Warriors of the Oath unleash the Crimson Storm !
Disciples of the Horned God fear the Final War !
We (have) come to crush and desecrate, Metal is the Law !" 
"Metal is the Law
METAL IS WAR !" 
([THE EMPEROR:]
"My Blood be thine Force as my Flesh serve thine Will !
I who grant thee this life urge thee, grant me the kill !
This Oath it is sealed by Honour, Magic and Blood !
I swear not to fail but myself become God !!!") 
[THE ARMY OF A'RYTH-RA:]
"We've come to seal your fate, we've come with killing Hate
To crush and desecrate, METAL IS WAR !" 
([THE EMPEROR:] "What a splendid sight it is to see those Legions march ! How hungry they are for the Bloodshed !") 
[THE ORACLE OF A'RYTH-RA:]
"Follow him, the One, the Light where Darkness falls...
And sing the Songs of Battle where the Slaughter calls !
Hail the Sacred Conqueror, sworn to bring demise...
And when the Fog of Battle clears a new Kingdom will rise !" 
[THE ARMY OF A'RYTH-RA:]
"Beneath the Dragonsky, our Banner's flying high !
FACE US AND YOU'LL DIE !!!" 
"YOU SHALL DIE !!!" 
[THE EMPEROR:]
"I am in Command to soak the Killing Field with Blood
(I am the) High-King of my Warriors, the Dragonslayer-Lord
My Armour shining Steel, I wear the Sceptre, Sword and Ring
I am the Saviour prophesized and I reign supreme !"
