([THE EMPEROR:] "With a grin I remember 'STORMHAMMER' cutting through the body of the Tyrant like a knife tearing through linen ! His Death has not been glorious... I have skinned and maimed then decapitated the cursed corpse. Finally I have relieved myself on the mangled pile of remains to even more humiliate the now dead King ! But... in the end... I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED !!! CROM and XU have vanished, forgotten by the Race of Man, unworshipped and banished... and the ELDER GODS have chosen the TYRANT KING to reign as their master in the dark halls of Cythraul... not Glory, but Shame... impale me, Sword of the Gods...") 
([THE TYRANT KING:] "I close my eyes to leave this world of carnage... it is time to return to the Hall of Kings...") 
(The Journey's at an end. The Dreaming Dead Soul awakens) 
"The Hall of the Kings greet the Celestial Spawn...
The fortress of Moon-Power (is) shrouded in Light's golden dawn
A soul of light rising... I gain the dark seat of True Force
In Glory enthroned... (I am) the Successor of THE ELDER GODS !" 
"I am dreaming eternal...
In Death I am finally home
I am the Watcher Infernal on the Metal Throne !" 
("In my Mind THE ELDER GODS speak... !") 
[THE ELDER GODS:]
"LIGHT AND GLORY...
THE GODS OF THE EARTH ARE REBORN !
CELESTIAL SPAWN, THY KINGDOM HAS COME !
REIGN FROM THE THRONE OF METAL !" 
[THE WITCH:]
"Come to me Son of the Sun, Heathen Bane of dark XU !
The Light and the Glory of Cythraul is shining through you !" 
[THE TYRANT KING:]
"Oh DARK FORCES hear me proclaiming my predestined reign !
As all things repeat I have risen to Power again !" 
([THE ORACLE OF A'RYTH-RA:] "A Sword carving bone, a Spell breaking stone, a God's Death to mourn, a new God is born ! HE shall forever reign from the Throne !!!") 
[THE TYRANT KING:]
"(And the Souls of the fallen are an easy) Prey for my soul...
PREY FOR MY SOUL !
PREY FOR MY SOUL !
PREY FOR MY SOUL !" 
"I summon thee forth from the abysmal pits of the Damned ! (You, that I loved long before the Birth of A'RYTH-RA and doomed K'UR !) 
Beloved Enchantress of Heaven, dark Witch-Queen of hell !" 
"...so pale she is rising... her Spirit is one with my Soul...
Together in Death, bound by Iron and Metal. Forever now, WE TAKE THE THRONE !!!" 
("NOW, I AM THE DARK LORD OF CYTHRAUL !!! IMMORTAL !!! UNDEAD !!!")
