[PART I OF THE 'TRILOGY OF BLOOD']

[XU:]
"Descending from the Heavens, cloaked in Armour shining bright
The grim foretold Messiah, wielder of the Power and Might
The Punisher, the Oath-sworn King, the breaker of the Spell
The one to crush the Tyranny and send him back to Hell !" 
[THE EMPEROR:]
"I am the one, the Son of the Sun
Creator of Light where the Darkness prevails
Come True Ones, let Justice be done !
We'll banish the Darkness for he's bound to fail !" 
("The Choir of the Chosen enshrouds me in Glory Immortal !") 
[THE ARMY OF A'RYTH-RA:]
"HAIL ! HAIL ! HAIL ! HAIL ! HAIL ! HAIL !" 
([THE EMPEROR:] "The Voice of the Goddess flows through me !") 
[XU:]
"From now on call thee Emperor !
Scion of the Gods !
Gather the Chosen Ones there...
(Now swear) THE OATH OF BLOOD !
Lead them to Glory forever, Wielder of the Sword !" 
[THE ARMY OF A'RYTH-RA:]
"(We're) Building a Kingdom of Metal
All sworn by THE OATH OF BLOOD !" 
[THE EMPEROR:]
"Fight for your lives ! Be strong and survive !
The ending of Terror, his time is at hand
The Night will die and our Light will shine...
The coming of Judgement, the Tyranny's end..." 
"SATE MY STEEL WITH BLOOD ! FEED THE SLAUGHTERGOD !" 
"From now on call ME Emperor !
(I am the) Scion of the Gods !
(I've) Gathered the Chosen Ones here...
(We are bound - in Life and Death - by) THE OATH OF BLOOD !
I'll lead 'em to Glory forever ! (I am the) Wielder of the Sword !" 
"(We're) Building a Kingdom of Metal
All sworn by THE OATH OF BLOOD !"
