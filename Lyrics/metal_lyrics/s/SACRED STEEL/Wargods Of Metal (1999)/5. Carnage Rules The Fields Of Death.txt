Carnage rules the Fields of Death 
Where many died this Night 
I kneel within a pool of Blood 
In Victory and Might 
I hail the Gods above, oh bless me 
With Metal, Steel and Blood 
I swear to be your loyal Priest 
A Prophet of your Wrath 
Do what you will with me, I'm yours 
On the Fields of Death 
Carnage 
Carnage Rules The Fields Of Death 
Carnage 
Carnage Rules The Fields Of Death 
Carnage rules the Fields of Death 
And for more Death I pray 
Bless me with the Skills of War 
And in your name I'll slay 
I see Despair and Pain 
In his fearful Eyes 
As Blood spills, Slaughter rains 
Now the bastard dies 
Carnage rules the Fields of Death 
And Death rules Life once more 
I sacrifice my Soul to thee 
I swear to die at War
