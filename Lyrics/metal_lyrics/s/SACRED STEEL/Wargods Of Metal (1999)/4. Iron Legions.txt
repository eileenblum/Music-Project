Cadaver Rites reveal the sight 
Of Battles soon to come 
The Banshee cries, all must die 
The Witch can not be wrong 
Her Eyes ablaze, a hollow Gaze 
Her Face burnt by the Torch 
She feels no Pain, the Witch insane laughs 
Iron Legions march 
Burn them, destroy them 
Rape them, hack and slay 
Crush them, maim them 
Torture human prey 
Iron Legions march for Glory 
Iron Legions kill 
Iron Legions born for Slaughter 
Born to slay at Will 
In Metal Fights test your Might 
Feed the Earth with Blood 
Heed not their Cries, leave none alive 
Kill for Slaughtergod 
Ride them down into the Ground 
My Magic be your Shield 
None shall escape the Metal Rage 
The deadly Kiss of Steel
