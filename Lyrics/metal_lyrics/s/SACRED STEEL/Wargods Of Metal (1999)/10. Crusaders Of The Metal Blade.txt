As Dawn breaks the Battle begins 
Anew time to fight 
Again songs of Metal we sing 
They guide us with Might 
May Destiny lead us to Slaughter 
Our righteous Crusade 
To slay our Fiend and to conquer 
The bastards will pay 
Blessed by the Gods 
Gods of Metal reign 
Vengeance for the Dead 
A raging War insane 
Into the Fire 
Deceivers burn in Flames of Hate 
Feeding the Pyre 
Crusaders Of The Metal Blade 
Death to the Liar 
With Sacred Steel annihilate 
Kill with Desire 
Crusaders Of The Metal Blade 
A dark Fate in store for the Foe 
You'll pay for your lies 
Feel our Hatred, Bringer of Woe 
By Metal you'll die 
Enslaving the young and the old 
Your women fall prey 
Cutting your flesh to the bone 
No mercy, just pain
