Holy Battle, Holy War 
Destiny revealed 
We're so much stronger than before 
Conquerors of Steel 
We live for Metal, live for War 
Fighting for the Gods 
Come meet your Fate, taste our Blades 
Longing for your Blood 
As it was it now shall be 
Our Gods shall rule 
You who have dared to fuck with Steel 
Die a Death of fools 
By Steel We Rule 
By Steel We Rule 
Wargods of Metal 
We kill for you 
Another Slaughter of Battle calls 
Destiny fulfilled 
Never surrender, never fall 
'Til our Blood is spilled 
We'll die for Metal, die for War 
Glory of the Gods 
An endless Fight with all our Might 
Metal in our Blood 
Gods of Steel we rule 
By Power and Might 
Gods of Steel we rule 
Come join our Fight 
Sacred Steel - We rule 
Metal is the Truth
