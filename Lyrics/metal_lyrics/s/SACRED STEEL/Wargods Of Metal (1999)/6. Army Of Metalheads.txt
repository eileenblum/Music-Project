Come hold me close my dear Brother 
Now as I take my last Breath 
So many Souls I have taken 
Now it's the time for my Death 
I'll drink from the Skulls of the False Ones 
With my Comrades waiting beyond 
We'll fight 'til the End of Forever 
'Til the Final Battle is done 
Anoint me in Metal and Steel 
In Death I am King 
Metalheads 
Metalheads 
Metalheads 
Our Army of Vengeance is back from the Dead 
Metalheads 
Metalheads 
Metalheads 
Our Army of Vengeance is back from the Dead 
Reign from a Throne made of Thunder 
Wielding the Lightning of War 
Hunting the Posers forever 
In Life as in Death evermore 
Gathering Soldiers of Metal 
Undead, Immortal and True 
Leading them into the Battle 
An Army of Cold Iron Doom
