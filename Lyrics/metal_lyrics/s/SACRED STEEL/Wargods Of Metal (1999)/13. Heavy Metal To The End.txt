Come together for the Slaughter 
The Crows feast tonight 
Storm like Hell, bring on Terror 
We kill with pure Delight 
Fighting on for Power and Glory 
To gain the Metal Throne 
We clash with Iron Fury 
To terminate their Souls 
Kill for Steel and Blood 
Posers will die for the Gods 
Stand and fight with Sword in Hand 
Heavy Metal To The End 
Fight and die the Gods command 
Heavy Metal To The End 
Metal Blades sing songs of Carnage 
Death Hymns of sacred Gore 
Fast killing Steel of dark Rage 
Dance deadly Tools of War 
We charge in Praise of Metal 
We strike with Steelborn Force 
We kill as one forever 
There will be no remorse 
Heavy Metal To The End
