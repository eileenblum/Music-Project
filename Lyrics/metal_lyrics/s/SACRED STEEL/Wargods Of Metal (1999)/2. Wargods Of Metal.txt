WAR !! 
Reign in Blood, reign in Fire 
Masters of Eternity 
Born of Steel, born of Iron 
Immortal Metal Deities 
Give us War, give us Passion 
Soldiers under your Command 
We will fight for your Glory 
We will fight until the End 
Metalheads unite 
Now stand up and fight 
Wargods Of Metal 
Wargods Of Metal 
Wargods of Metal rule the Fight 
Wargods of Metal rule the Fight 
Die in Blood, die in Fire 
Archfiend of dark Misery 
Pay in guts, feed the Lion 
For the Griffin still is King 
Banners fly, Armour's clashing 
And the Wargods lead us on 
Into War, into Slaughter 
Now the Bloodshed has begun
