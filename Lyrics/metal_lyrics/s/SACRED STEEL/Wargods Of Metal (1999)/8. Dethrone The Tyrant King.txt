Seize the Throne 
The Wicked One is King 
Grind their bones 
Let bells of Freedom ring 
Wield your black Swords 
Castle now besieged 
Attack the Dark Lord 
Dethrone The Tyrant King 
Turn his Reign to ash 
Cremate the Dragon home 
Deliver Pain and Death 
To reap what you have sown 
Fire reigns and Death remains 
The End will now begin 
Slaughter grows and Blood now flows 
Dethrone The Tyrant King 
Ram their Gates 
Crush their weak Defense 
Break on through 
Kill with Sword and Lance 
Destroy with Anger 
Servants of the King 
For Slaughter's Glory 
This day of Bloodshed brings 
Slay the Guards 
Fight your bloody way 
Into the Throne room 
Where the Tyrant reigns 
A wicked laughter 
Echoes through the Hall 
He escaped - No 
War is yet to come 
Dethrone The Tyrant King 
Dethrone The Tyrant King 
Dethrone The Tyrant King...
