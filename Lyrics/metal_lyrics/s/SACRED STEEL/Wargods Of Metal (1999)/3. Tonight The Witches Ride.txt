A black Night, a cold Night 
What Evil may this Darkness bring 
A dark Storm upon us 
The Ceremony is soon to begin 
Their Master is waiting 
And the Goat is an impatient Lord 
A dark song the Wind sings 
Come ye Children of Satan's black horde 
Come to the Flame 
Creatures of Evil are meeting again 
Come to the Fire 
To summon the Devil, our Lord and Messiah 
Unholy Night 
Mankind filled with Fright 
Satan waits in Pride 
Tonight The Witches Ride 
A grim Night, a cursed Night 
All Demons are joining the Call 
Thee unborn, thee Hellspawn 
Gathered to bring Death to us all 
And I saw the Beasts of Earth 
Feast upon the Souls of Man 
And I saw their Son of God 
Die like Sinners, die in Pain
