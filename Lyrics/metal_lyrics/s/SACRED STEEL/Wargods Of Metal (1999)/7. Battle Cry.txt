Catch a fleeting glimpse 
Then be on your way 
Oh the End is near 
If we choose to stay 
This forsaken land 
Torn by Grief and Strife 
No it's not worth 
The value of your Life 
The Smell of Death 
Lingers everywhere 
Bloodstained bodies 
Scattered everywhere 
In the distance 
Thunder in the Sky 
See the Sorrow 
Hear the Battle Cry 
Battle Cry 
The Carnage races on 
Well into the Night 
As the Sun creeps up 
We see the morning Light 
On this Battlefield 
The Tragedy of Dawn 
Through the Crimson Tide 
We still carry on
