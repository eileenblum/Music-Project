The worst of times collide
The best is left behind
Things we shouldnât see
Taking liberties

Hung on every word
And some Iâve never heard
The love there was to be
This is killing me
This is killing me
This is killing me
This is killing me

Mistakes leap of faith
Thatâs fallen out of place
Disguised as unity
The unseen injury

The slamming of the door
That calls a dog to war
What is and what shall be
This is killing me
This is killing me
This is killing me
Weâve cut the skin to watch it bleed, but underneath
This is killing me

Before the system shuts us down
Emotions running underground
Letâs promise that we wonât look back on this

Thereâs never right and always wrong
Weâve fought for love for far too long
Lets free ourselves and lead our separate lives
Iâm gonna flyâ¦
Iâm gonna flyâ¦
Iâm gonna flyâ¦
