Thereâs nothing else alive to me
All I want is victory
Every second flashes on my brain

Adrenaline is turning red
The powers going to my head
The light is steady burning in my veins

I put my heavy foot down to the floor
Living on the line and wanting more
Iâm one with my machine
Bleeding gasoline
Kick the tires, light the fires
Letâs go!

Let seven thousand horses loose
Grab your gear and hit the juice
Then take a shot at making history

Itâs time to go, itâs do or die
A kamikaze lullaby
Is in my suicidal memory

I put my heavy foot down to the floor
Living on the line and wanting more
Iâm one with my machine
Bleeding gasoline
Kick the tires, light the fires
Letâs go!
