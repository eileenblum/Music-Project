We've got the bullet and the Bible we defend it with
You can believe what you've been told
No such thing as zombies of an alien apocalypse
We've got the matters in control

	can't find salvation in a candy coated letter bomb
No rights of passage are for free
We want till we need then we fight till we bleed
Then we walk till we crawl and we run till we fall
And cut our throats out socially

Even some angels are thrown in the fire
The demons inside me are ready for hire
Concealed in my mind is my darkest desire
All that is left is your burning empire

I'm king of the demolition
Justice is a new religion
Praise god for the ammunition
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

I'm king of the demolition
Justice is a new religion
Praise god for the ammunition
Get in back you can ride with the bullets
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

My retribution is without sincere apology
And every word is on a wire
We will stand till we die and we'll stare till we cry
And we'll live by he sword and the hands of the lord
Accounted for and justified

Even some angels are thrown in the fire
The demons inside me are ready for hire
Concealed in my mind is my darkest desire
All that is left is your burning empire

I'm king of the demolition
Justice is a new religion
Praise god for the ammunition
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

I'm king of the demolition
Justice is a new religion
Praise god for the ammunition
Get in back you can ride with the bullets
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

I'm king of the demolition
Justice is a new religion
Praise god for the ammunition
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

I'm king of the demolition
Justice is a new religion
Praise god for the ammunition
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

I'm king of the demolition
Justice is a new religion
Praise god for the ammunition
Get in back you can ride with the bullets
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

Get in back you can ride with the bullets
Get in back you can ride with the bullets
Get in back you can ride with the bullets

I'm king of the demolition
