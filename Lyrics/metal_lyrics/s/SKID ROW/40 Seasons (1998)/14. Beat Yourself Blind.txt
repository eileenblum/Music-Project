[Bach / Bolan / Hill / Snake]

Give me a minute 'cause I'm wrapped in superstition
Pour me a chemical to take away the edge
Don't make up anything that's breaking all your fingers
Just slap around a bit of what it takes to pledge

Carry out another stone as a slave
Ask general-know-it-all "Who's juggling the earth?"
Tease all the natives that will walk across your grave
And shove aside your nation all for what it's worth

Beat yourself blind [x6]
An open eyes and a closed mind

Look at the suit in suspended animation
A faded outline that used to be a man
A piece of paper that's fallen out a window
Has got a better chance to know where it will land

Beat yourself blind [x6]
An open eyes and a closed mind

To bleed in vain, to bleed in vain--under my eyes are painted skies
Down at the boneyard, they're diggin' up the relics
Handfuls of parasites thrown into machines
I got the phone call they're tearin' down the mission
The zombies had a ball, but don't know what it means

Beat yourself blind
