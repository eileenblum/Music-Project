[Bolan / Hill / Snake]

Remember when we were young
Just two kids on the run
With a fist full of dreams

Drinking wild playing cool
Stay out late cutting school
Lighting cigarettes like James Dean

In the backseat of my Chevrolet
Where the radio would play and play
And all the world would fade away

Together we stand
Well it's just you and me
So baby hold on and you'll see
Forever we stand
And we'll make it through
'Cause I know I can't live without you
No, no, no, no

They said we're growing up too fast
What we had would never last
So we left without goodbyes

And then some times, well, they got tough
The roads ahead looked kinda rough
And all we had was you and I

We prayed to God on those cool dark nights
And then we knew that it would be alright
We'd go through hell just to hold each other tight

Together we stand
Well it's just you and me
So baby hold on and you'll see
Forever we stand
And we'll make it through
'Cause I know I can't live without you

As long as the world keeps turning
As long as there's another day
Together forever we'll stay

In the backseat of my Chevrolet
Where the radio would play and play
And all the world would fade away

Yeah!

Together we stand
Well it's just you and me
So baby hold on and you'll see
Forever we stand
And we'll make it through
'Cause I know I can't live without you

Forever, forever, forever we stand
Forever, forever, forever we stand
