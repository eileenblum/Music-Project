[Snake]

What was it you once said
That there would be things in life that couldn't be
Not for a second did I believe you
Not for a minute did I believe that

Within your need you lie alone
This empty space you call your home

If you just let me in
I wouldn't let you break down
I'm breakin' down

As if you thought the rain could wash away the day
And could heal you
Not for a second did I believe it
Not for a minute did I believe that

Within your need you lie alone
This empty space you call your home

If you just let me in
I wouldn't let you break down
I'm breakin' down

What was it you once said
That there would be things in life that couldn't be
Not for a second did I believe you
Not for a minute did I believe that

If you just let me in
I wouldn't let you break down
I'm breakin' down
