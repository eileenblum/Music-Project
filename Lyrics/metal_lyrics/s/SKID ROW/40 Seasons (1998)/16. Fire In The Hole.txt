[Bolan / Hill]

Why not just skin me like a Yankee pig?
This neo-Nazi stuff just ain't my gig
Still ain't sure what you had in mind
I picked it from the stench you left behind
Steady drip of memory for my head
Bet you got jealousidal tendencies
Could I wind up dead

Something going around
Then there's fire in the hole
Cover me I'm going down
Then there's fire in the hole
Unlucky white kid didn't leave with the blues
Paint balls of fire
He had a ball with Dio
Give us love while we're covered in blood
Flying high but ain't sure which way is up
Crash landing in the submarines
Belly up to the enemy

Something going around
Then there's fire in the hole
Am I even sinking fast on the ship of souls
Cover me I'm going down
Then there's fire in the hole
There's something going around
Then there's fire in the hole
Cover me I'm going down
Then there's fire in the hole
Am I even sinking fast on the ship of souls
Cover me I'm going down
