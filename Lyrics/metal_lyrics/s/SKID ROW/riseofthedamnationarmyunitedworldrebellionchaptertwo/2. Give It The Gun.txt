Blood in the water that I'm wading in
They're rippin' the stacks
And counting all the deadly sins

A revolution in a little pill
Tell your story...once
Or then it's overkill

Breakdown, take down
Shanghai shakedown
Lock your mouth and
Watch how this is done
You got to Give It The Gun

Give It The Gun-
Number one,is get me outa here
Give It The Gun-
On two,do what you gotta do
Give It The Gun-
Count of three,jump in the drivers seat
Give It The Gun-
Ooh yeah

The second bullet is behind your back
So crank out a smile...quick
Before your cover cracks

Nobody knows where the road will end
The feeling tonight will go
Over and over again
And over again

Break it,take it
Some won't make it
Kill the lights cuz
It's too late to run
You got to Give It The Gun

Give It The Gun-
Number one,is get me outa here
Give It The Gun-
On two,do what you gotta do
Give It The Gun-
Count of three,jump in the drivers seat
Give It The Gun-
Ooh yeah

Blood in the water that I'm wading in
A revolution and the deadly sin
The second bullet is behind your back
So crank out a smile...quick or Give It The Gun

Give It The Gun-
Number one,is get me outa here
Give It The Gun-
On two,do what you gotta do
Give It The Gun-
Count of three,jump in the drivers seat
Give It The Gun-
Ooh yeah
Give It The Gun
