Lost in a dusting of vagabond saviors
Hung by the thumbs and left here to die
The schoolgirl assasins are calling in favors
Play that the wretched all choke
On their wine

Who are we to be free?
So damn the enemy
Here we stand
Side by side
They can try to take us down,
But never take our pride

Rebels we are
Hold togheter by scars
The Rise Of The Damnation Army

Freedom is ours
The bring down the powers
The Rise Of The Damnation Army 1-2-3-4

Running through minefields
With no hesitation
Far beyond winning comes
Our peace of mind
Flying the flag of a new generation
To lay down ideals is to be left behind

Destiny.To be free
So damn the enemy
Here we stand
Side by side
They can try to take us down,
But never take our pride

Rebels we are
Hold togheter by scars
The Rise Of The Damnation Army

Freedom is ours
The bring down the powers
The Rise Of The Damnation Army

REBELS RISE!!
