I know I love you,but rather hide behind it
Until I really find it in me
Before I tell you.I need to find the courage
And try to not discourage you

This is so much bigger
Than the both of us
So can we go the distance
Or will we fade away

Like an old song
That we sing until it's all done
If the sky falls down around us
I want you here with me

Don't wanna lose you
Or make you feel unwanted
It's from the ghosts that haunted my heart
When you touch me I stand
Up like a statue
And I will always Catch Your Fall

When we're alone together
We need no one else
Hide from the revolution
And watch it fade away

Like an old song
That we sing until it's all done
If the sky falls down around us
I want you here with me

I will be your shelter.
I will be your hero.
I will be your sanctuary.

I know I love you when the room is empty
And we can live through anything
Or fade away

Like an old song
That we sing until it's all done
Say goodbye to an old friend
And we'll drink until the worlds end
If the sky falls down around us
I want you here with me
I want you here with me
I need you here with me
