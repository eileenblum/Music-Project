Their eyes are looking down on us
The walls, they all have ears
Theres nothing sacred left except
Our hatred,love and tears

I know the person trapped behind
That seven mile stare
If only I could save you
Without kicking out the chair

Light me aflame before I freeze
Until I climb from my disease

Take the power back
Fight with all you will
Bleed for the cause
Eat what you kill

Us against the world
Live for what you say
We have gained control
We'll meet again on Zero Day

Has anybody out there been
Absolved of all their sins?
I'm juggling the hand grenades
And pulling all the pins

We've made a crooked circle
Back to the subway train
The poachers and the preachers
All circling the drain

I'd rather burn before I freeze
Or throw the fight than to appease

Take the power back
Fight with all you will
Bleed for the cause
Eat what you kill

Us against the world
Live for what you say
We have gained control
We'll meet again on Zero Day

We'll meet again on Zero Day
We'll meet again on Zero Day
We'll meet again on Zero Day

Take the power back
Fight with all you will
Bleed for the cause
Eat what you kill

Us against the world
Live for what you say
We have gained control

We'll meet again on Zero Day
