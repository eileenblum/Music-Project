Down between the steely grates
Beneath the sewer's smile
This city is our camouflage
The underbelly's bile

The night is choked with rosaries
Black air so thick with hate
This street belongs to us tonight
Lost souls attempting fate

This is not the war
That we're looking for
In our living hell
We raise our fists and yell

We are the strong
We are the weak
We are the burned
We are the freak

We are the wolf
We are the lamb
We are the lost
WE ARE THE DAMNED

Freedom is the coup d'etat
As sure there is the sky
Tonight we roam the underworld
Our brothers by our side

Beggars underneath the bridge
The fifty-gallon fire
The rebels are on 34th
Big brother's getting tired

As we live and breathe
Force fed what to believe
In our living hell
We raise our fists and yell

We are the strong
We are the weak
We are the burned
We are the freak

We are the wolf
We are the lamb
We are the lost
WE ARE THE DAMNED

We are the strong

We are the lamb
We are the lost
WE ARE THE DAMNED

We are the strong
We are the weak
We are the burned
We are the freak

We are the wolf
We are the lamb
We are the lost
WE ARE THE DAMNED

We are
We are
We are
We ARE THE DAMNED

We are (We are)
We are (We are)
We are (We are)
WE ARE THE DAMNED
