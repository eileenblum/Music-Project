[Bolan, Hill, Snake]

Shy a quarters headroom
I saw the
Half-moon was burning down
Play with your reflection 'cause
And infection is going around

Dive head-on into me, Dive head-on into me
Dive head-on into me, Dive head-on into me

Meet my neighbor's widow, a black and
Bluedoe, she's up a tree
Trip, the lightning spastic
Captain Fantastic. The nineteen seventies

Dive head-on into you, Dive head-on into you
Dive head-on into you, Dive head-on into you

Bury the news with the views from
behind
the door
Rattle the bones with the drones at the
Corner store--see them for myself

Commies, kinks and masochists
Weirdos, love and homicide
Witches, freaks and 45s
Kick a painted pony let the spinning wheel ride
