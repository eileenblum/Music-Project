[Bolan, Snake]

As I stare into the fire
All my thoughts go up in flames
Here I stare into the fire
I'll be waiting on the rain

The box I keep myself in, closes out my air
So I build a fire, so I can sit and stare

[Chorus]
Can it be I'm frozen
Can it be I'm frozen
Can it be I'm frozen
Can it be I'm frozen

As I stare into the weather
My eyes drying from the cold
As I stare into the weather
I sense my thoughts growing old

[Repeat Chorus]

I listen to the prophets predict the stem of tides
I stare into the weather that's keeping me inside

[Repeat Chorus]

As I stare into the fire
Will the prophets change my mind
While I stare into the fire
All the colors treat me kind

I'll dust away the fallings the winter leaves for me
I'll stare into the fire and set tomorrow free

[Repeat Chorus]
