[Bolan, Snake]

Is there a problem? The laugh of the rich man
Has got you crying poor
Are you as heavy as hell in a handbag
Or just a virgin whore?
If the weight of the world is on your shoulders
Then carry it for a day
Do you cry for peace or peace of mind;
Is reality in the way?

Enter the martyr out through the in door
The savior has arrived?
Is all your anger force of habit
And keeping you alive?
An empty shotgun shooting your mouth off
Something's on your mind
The cheap messiah of persecution
Is alive and doing fine

[Chorus]
I won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you say
If you're a new God let me see a miracle
I won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you say
I can't say that you're a fool,
but if you're a new God let me see a miracle.
