[Affuso, Bach, Bolan, Snake]

There are things we cannot see that hang
Within her sight
There are people we won't remember that
Dance with her at night

[Chorus]
Eileen's calling me
To sit awhile and talk to trees
Eileen can't you see
The songs you sing are scaring me

Eileen, Eileen

She romances with the moon
Full and alone
It's really a street light
It's something we all know

[Repeat Chorus]
