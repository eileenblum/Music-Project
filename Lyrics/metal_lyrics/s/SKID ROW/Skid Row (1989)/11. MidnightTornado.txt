[Fallon, Snake]

The night approaches, after dark you have no chance
Ooh, when moonlight takes the sky, you'll feel my dark romance

I'm on your footsteps and I wait behind your back
I spread like fire upon the streets I'm ready to attack

I'm the only thing you need
Upon your love I feed

When the clock strikes midnite
I'm on the prowl of love
When the clock strikes midnite
The time is right to call you out

When I'm feeling wicked and my blood is running hot
Electric is my touch baby you don't know what you've got

Only in the evening at night I come alive
So try to keep your passion deep I need it to survive

I'm the only thing you need
Upon your love I feed

When the clock strikes midnite
I'm on the prowl of love
When the clock strikes midnite
The time is right to call you out

When the clock strikes midnite
When the wicked moon starts to rise
When the clock strikes midnite
I'm alive

When the clock strikes midnite
I'm on the prowl of love
When the clock strikes midnite
The time is right to call you out

When the clock strikes midnite
When the wicked moon starts to rise
When the clock strikes midnite
I'm alive
