I say âitâs your love that keeps me aliveâ
But you drag me through the mud like a four wheel drive
Iâve give you the moon, Iâll give you my last beer
Iâd rather move too fast than be stuck in gear

Maybe thereâs something that I donât see
Are you in 3D?
Are you the devilâs seed or the devil in me

What you gonna do? I told you Iâd be true
You scream at me until youâre blue
Now shut up baby, I love you
Shut up baby, I love you
Now shut up baby, I love you

Itâs been so long since I knew whatâs real
Now my footâs on the floor and Iâm spinning my wheels
They say you left town with another man
Now Iâm off to Mississippi with a gun in my hand

Maybe thereâs something that I donât see
Are you in 3D?
Are you the devilâs seed or the devil in me

What you gonna do? I told you Iâd be true
You scream at me until youâre blue
Now shut up baby, I love you
Shut up baby, I love you
Now shut up baby, I love you

Are you the devilâs seed or the devil in me

What you gonna do? I told you Iâd be true
You scream at me until youâre blue
Now shut up baby, I love you
What you gonna do? I told you Iâd be true
You scream at me until youâre blue
Now shut up baby, I love you
Shut up baby, I love you
Shut up baby, I love you
Shut up baby, I love you
