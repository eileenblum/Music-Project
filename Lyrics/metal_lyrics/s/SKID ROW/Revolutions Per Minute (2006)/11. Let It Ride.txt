You never call to see me
Only when you want my love or something
I start to feel outnumbered
By you; my fear and the one youâre thinking of

When I dream that Iâm in hell
The devil bares your name
And every time I wake up
Youâre stuck inside my brain

Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride
Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride or let it go
Go

Stepping out a window
On the edge of Son of Sam or the Boogeyman
And your atomic future may kill us
But is never gonna change the man I am

When I dream that Iâm in hell
The devil calls your name
And every time I wake up
Youâre stuck inside my brain

Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride
Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride

It couldnât grow any darker
You made it burn forever more
You like to hate me with love in your eyes
Thereâs nothing gong on that I donât realize

Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride
Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride

Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride
Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride

Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride
Let it ride, let it go
Let it bleed, let it show
If you lie, let me know
Let it ride
