Iâm not the devil
But I can show my horns
All the things I did to you
Could have been in a porn
Then I heard the rumors
Now I know theyâre true
Some strange motherfucker
Is gonna do âem to you

I said I loved you but you didnât listen
I know thereâs another dick in the system
I said I loved you but you didnât listen
I know thereâs another dick in the system

Iâve lived with angels
Iâve laid with whores
I gave you nothing but honesty
Then I licked your sores
Iâm not the one to crucify
With blood, iron and wood
Youâre not the saviour to me anymore
Youâre damaged goodsâ¦ Yeah

I said I loved you but you didnât listen
I know thereâs another dick in the system
I said I loved you but you didnât listen
I know thereâs another dick in the system

I said I loved you but you didnât listen
I know thereâs another dick in the system
I said I loved you but you didnât listen
I know thereâs another dick in the system
Hey Hey
Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey
