Iâve fallen for and fought the wars with you
And held my breath until Iâm gray
I choke myself until my skin turn blue
On words I never got to say

Feed me, bleed me
I donât care

I canât keep what I donât want
A ghost needs a house to haunt
Black holes inside your head
Burns quick the turns to red
Close the lid, drive the nails
Bury me, âcause love is dead

No soul to sell, Iâve been through hell with you
Then left our love outside to freeze
Weâd die in bed then you threw dirt on me
And burn me out like a disease

Thrill me, kill me
I donât care

I canât keep what I donât want
A ghost needs a house to haunt
Black holes inside your head
Burns quick the turns to red
Close the lid, drive the nails
Bury me, âcause love is dead

I choke myself until my skin turn blue
On words I never got to say

Thrill me, kill me
I donât care

I canât keep what I donât want
A ghost needs a house to haunt
Black holes inside your head
Burns quick the turns to red
I canât keep what I donât want
A ghost needs a house to haunt
Black holes inside your head
Burns quick the turns to red
Close the lid, drive the nails
Bury me, âcause love is dead
