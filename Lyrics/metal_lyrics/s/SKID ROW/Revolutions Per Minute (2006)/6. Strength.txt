[The Alarm cover]

Give me love
Give me hope
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for

Who will light the fire
That I need to survive
Who will be the life blood
Coursing through my veins

Like a river flowing
That will never change
I need someone
I can depend on

'Cause I'm a man of emotions
Who can't hide the tears
I'm a man of feeling
Who can't hide the pain

I'm alone on the outskirts of town
Where no one knows my name
I'm at the point in my life
Where I need affection

Won't you
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for

Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for

I need it now
I need it now

Someone write me a letter
I need to know that I'm still alive
Someone give me a telephone call
I need to hear a human sound
Someone open up a door
And let me out of this place
I've been caged up for oh so long
I don't know if I'm living or dying

Someone better
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for

Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for

I walk alone across the outskirts of town
I can't control what I'm going through now
Will you light the fire that I need to survive
Will you donate the life blood
coursing through my veins
Will you open up the door &amp; let me out of this place

I've been caged up for oh so long
I don't know if I'm living or dying

Won't you
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for

Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone
Someone to live for
