I laid my soul in front of you
I tied myself to the railroad tracks
You refused my point of view
Then diluted all my facts

You won it, you broke it
You held it to choke it
Youâre pulling my heart
Out from under
You won it, you broke it
You held it to choke it
Youâre pulling my heart
Out from under me

I gave you all I had inside
And every chance to tell the truth
My faith in you has been denied
But forced a smile in spite of you

You won it, you broke it
You held it to choke it
Youâre pulling my heart
Out from under
You won it, you broke it
You held it to choke it
Youâre pulling my heart
Out from under me
Me. Me. Yeah out from under
Me. Me. Me. Yeah out from under

You won it, you broke it
You held it to choke it
Youâre pulling my heart
Out from under
You won it, you broke it
You held it to choke it
Youâre pulling my heart
Out from under
You won it, you broke it
You held it to choke it
Youâre pulling my heart
Out from under me
