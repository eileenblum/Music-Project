Have you looked at yourself lately
You see the lines of time?
Walking dead amongst the living
Chaos by design
Iâve seen you fall this far before
Iâve seen you disappear
Youâve thrown it all into the fire
Ashes in your tears

I felt your disease and now I think
Iâve had enough. Iâve had enough
I felt your disease and now I think
Iâve had enough. Iâve had enough

Youâve fallen on your sword again
So not to face the truth
Then ran head-on into whatâs real
And collided into you
Iâve heard you lying to yourself
Iâve watched you fade away
Your best laid plans are still born shadows
Promise in decay

I felt your disease and now I think
Iâve had enough. Iâve had enough
I felt your disease and now I think
Iâve had enough. Iâve had enough

I felt your disease and now I think
Iâve had enough. Iâve had enough

I felt your disease and now I think
Iâve had enough. Iâve had enough
I felt your disease and now I think
Iâve had enough. Iâve had enough
