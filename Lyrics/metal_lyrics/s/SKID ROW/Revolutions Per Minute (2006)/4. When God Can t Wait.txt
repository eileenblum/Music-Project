The kids are united, thatâs what we say
Sometimes youâve got to shovel shit
To make a little pay
When we hear the whistle we break the gate
To lead âem to freedom when God canât wait

God canât wait for sinners to come home
God canât wait for saints to stand alone
Fight the fight that fighters like to fight
Bleed to blood
That gets you through the night

We rebuilt the mission but broke the bell
The only way to heaven
Is straight through living hell
Someone phone a taxi to take us home
To our brothers and sisters and weâll live on

God canât wait for sinners to come home
God canât wait for saints to stand alone
Fight the fight that fighters like to fight
Bleed to blood
That gets you through the night

They think by shooting bullets
Itâll make us dance
Tell the fucking enemy
They stand no fucking chance
When we hear the whistle we break the gate
To lead âem to freedom when God canât wait
Lead âem to freedom when God canât wait
Lead âem to freedom when God canât wait
Lead âem to freedom, weâll lead âem to freedom
Lead âem to freedom, weâll lead âem to freedom
Lead âem to freedom, weâll lead âem to freedom
