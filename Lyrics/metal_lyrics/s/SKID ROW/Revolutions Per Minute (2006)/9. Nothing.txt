Houses on the hill
Looking down on all the little peopleâs lives
And wondering it Iâve been missing out
Growing up is hard, isnât that what Bowie sang
When he was young
Before he knew what growing up was like

Guess Iâll never know, so Iâll take it day by day
As it comes until thereâs something else to think about

If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing
If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing but you

Changing with the times
Looking back on all our oldest memories to realize
We havenât changed at all
Records in my room
Itâs still the place where we can go to get away
from real life and real agony

If we should disappear, we can take it day by day
As it comes until thereâs something else to talk about

If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing
If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing but you

If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing
If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing
If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing
If I want it all then Iâll get it all
Do I need it all? I need nothing but you
