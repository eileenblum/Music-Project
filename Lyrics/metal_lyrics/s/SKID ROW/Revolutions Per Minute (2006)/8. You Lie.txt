You lie to me a first time
Youâll lie to me again
You pushed me out the front door
While some strangerâs walking in
The way you say you love me is as ugly as sin
You lie, you lie, you lie

I waited up âtil morning just wondering what youâd say
You stumbled on your story âcause the truth got in the way
You choked on your confession, but thought you had it saved
While someone else was jumpinâ in my grave

You lie to me a first time
Youâll lie to me again
You pushed me out the front door
While some strangerâs walking in
The way you say you love me is as ugly as sin
You lie, you lie, you lie

Iâm counting on the future, forgetting âbout the past
Just knowing youâre not honest, well I knew it wouldnât last
Iâm trying to believe you but itâs such a fucking chore
You lyinâ, cheatinâ dirty little whore

You lie to me a first time
Youâll lie to me again
You pushed me out the front door
While some strangerâs walking in
The way you say you love me is as ugly as sin
You lie, you lie, you lie
You lie, you lie, you lie

You lie to me a first time
Youâll lie to me again
You pushed me out the front door
While some strangerâs walking in
The way you say you love me is as ugly as sin
You lie, you lie, you lie
You lie, you lie, you lie

You lie to me a first time
Youâll lie to me again
You pushed me out the front door
While some strangerâs walking in
The way you say you love me is as ugly as sin
You lie, you lie, you lie
You lie, you lie, you lie
You lyinâ motherfucker
