I never promised you the sunshine
You never handed me the moon
We're pulling threads out of our faded silver lining
We've grown out of our cocoon

The last train is leaving
There's nothing more than I can say
I didn't mean to bring you down
I guess i'll see you around

I left the best of my intentions
Took it one day at a time
It's not like all is lost or that the world is ending
We've just fallen from divine

The last train is leaving
There's nothing more than I can say
I didn't mean to bring you down
I guess i'll see you around
Will I see you around

Whatever direction we go
Rest assured the one thing we know
Things just didn't really go our way

It's not like all is lost or that the world is ending
We've just fallen from divine

The last train is leaving
There's nothing more than I can say
I didn't mean to bring you down

The last train is leaving
There's nothing more than I can say
I didn't mean to bring you down
I guess i'll see you around
Will I see you around
