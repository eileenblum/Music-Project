Building shrines to gods you'll never know
Ppraying for rain, settling for snow
Spinning out of times to beats impaired
Do you know your name?
Do you even care?

Can you live your life
staring at the lights
Naked on the ice?
If it comes too fast, will you get it back
when it all goes black?

Down
Goin' down
Goin' down from
Down from underground

Icons that you hail are all mechanical
Feeling the pull
lost in the fold
Digging through a hole of discontent
What did you learn?
Or did you forget?

Can you live your life
staring at the lights
Naked on the ice?
If it comes too fast, will you get it back
when it all goes black?

Down
Goin' down
Goin' down from
Down from underground

And just what should real life be
Why don't you show me, the fiction of reality
The so called life that I see
And just what real life should be
Can't be what you have shown me

If it comes too fast, will you get it back
when it all goes black?

Down
Goin' down
Goin' down from
Down from underground

Down
Goin' down
Goin' down from
Down from underground
