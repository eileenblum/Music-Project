I sold my soul for you
You cut my life in two
Nightmares from what I've seen and where I've been
Made me run from you again

Controlling, big brother's eye
Containment? I'd rather die

We're all part of a new generation
Sold our souls to the next temptation
Lead us not to our own damnation

I've seen what hatred brings
I've seen the flesh of kings
Blinded my eyes my mouth you've sewn it shut
Protecting me from fucking up!

Controlling, big brother's eye
Containment? I'd rather die

We're all part of a new generation
Sold our souls to the next temptation
Lead us not to our own damnation

We're all part of a new generation
Sold our souls to the next temptation
Lead us not to our own damnation

We're all part of a new generation
Sold our souls to the next temptation
Lead us not to our own damnation

We're all part of a new generation
Sold our souls to the next temptation
Lead us not to our own damnation

New generation
New generation
New generation
