You're testing my patience
I've got nothing but time
You'll never break down
The walls in my mind

Your fetishes are nothing more than a game
When I truly test your threshold of pain
Let me be in you ceremony
Burn me in your ritual
I can rise with you below me
We'll walk in time as we fall into the mouth of voodoo

Then we can shine, shine, shine
And I'm sure the sun won't mind
Then we can shine, shine, shine - oh yeah!

Your love is so blinding
My lust is a curse
It's painful to wonder but waiting is worse
You're sticking your pins now
It's taking it's toll
Crush and obsession leave scars on your soul

Let me be in you ceremony
Burn me in your ritual
I can rise with you below me
We'll walk in time as we fall into the mouth of voodoo

Then we can shine, shine, shine
And I'm sure the sun won't mind
Then we can shine, shine, shine - oh yeah!

[Solo]

Let me be in you ceremony
Burn me in your ritual
I can rise with you below me
We'll walk in time as we fall into the mouth of voodoo

Then we can shine, shine, shine
And I'm sure the sun won't mind
Then we can shine, shine, shine

Then we can shine, shine, shine
I'm sure the sun won't mind - yeah!
Then we can shine, shine, shine
Then we can shine, shine, shine - oh yeah!

Oh, oh, oh...
