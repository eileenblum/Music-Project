Peel me like dead skin
Hate to the bone
I drag you through my field of thorns
And drop you like a stone

Hold me under water
Kick me to the curb
All my wolves are at your door
Take me at my word

Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Look at me and you're seeing a monster
You ain't seen it all

If you're almighty
Holier than thou
Seems we've got a discrepancy
We should solve it now

I've built a bigger mountain
Now you want it gone
If you expect to beat me down
Brother bring it on

Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Look at me and you're seeing a monster
You ain't seen it all

Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Look at me and you're seeing a monster
You ain't seen it all

You want to wrestle with my morals
You think there's something I can learn
You toss me out like an abortion
And I'm the one that fucking burns?

Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Look at me and you're seeing a monster
You ain't seen it all

Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Look at me and you're seeing a monster
You ain't seen it all

Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall - yeah!
Hittin' a wall, we're hittin' a wall

Ahh!!!
