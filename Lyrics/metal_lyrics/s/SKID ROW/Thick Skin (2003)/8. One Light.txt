There's a sound in my head
Holy wine, breakin' bread
between time and what we said
drifts the innocence we've shed

In this moment there's a day
for a sad and broken babe
there's a fracture on this hallowed ground where we lay

One light burns, one light fades
Behind the door are better days
When the light shines on me
I'll know the world still turns
One light burns, one light burns

There's a prayer on the wall
One by one say them all
Why we run before we crawl
Stands the reason that we fall
In the flower there's a field
Sublime but so surreal
There's a fracture on this sacred ground to be healed

One light burns, one light fades
Behind the door are better days
When the light shines on me
I'll know the world still turns
One light burns, one light burns
One light burns

[Solo]

One light burns, one light fades
Behind the door are better days
When the light shines on me
I'll know the world still turns

One light burns, one light fades
Behind the door are better days
When the light shines on me
I'll know the world still turns

One light burns, one light fades
Behind the door are better days
When the light shines on me
I'll know the world still turns

One light burns (one light burns..)
One light burns (one light burns..)
One light burns (one light burns..)
One light burns (one light burns..)
