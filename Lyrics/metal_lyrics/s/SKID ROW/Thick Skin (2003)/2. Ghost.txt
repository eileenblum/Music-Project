I feel the things I said
But never said how I felt
I know I waited much too long
Could I get it in your head
Without a head full of doubt
Looking back it seems that I
Went about it all wrong

Lying alone in the bed we made
Watching headlights on the shades
The ghosts that sleeping by your side
Are my promises to you that died
To you that died

Wasn't long ago
when forever was our friend
But now freedom's what I feel inside
It hurts so much to let you go
To know we'll never touch again
When I walk if I fall down
Can I take it in stride

Lying alone in the bed we made
Watching headlights on the shades
The ghosts that sleeping by your side
Are my promises to you that died
To you that died

I might let you go, but i'll never go away
I might let you go, but i'll never go away...yeah

I feel the things I said
But never said how I felt
I know I waited much too long

Lying alone in the bed we made
Watching headlights on the shades
The ghosts that sleeping by your side
Are my promises that died

Lying alone in the bed we made
Watching headlights on the shades
The ghosts that sleeping by your side
Are my promises that died
To you that died
To you that died
