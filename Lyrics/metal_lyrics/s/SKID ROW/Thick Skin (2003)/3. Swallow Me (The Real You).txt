Everything's changed
All ties are strained...to say the least
Concepts deranged

It's just the way I see you
I only see the real you

You can't swallow me
I'm jagged as the pill you choke on
You can't swallow me
As long as I can see the real you

I can't be blamed
To feel this way no more
Everything's changed

It's just the way I see you
I only see the real you

You can't swallow me
I'm jagged as the pill you choke on
You can't swallow me
As long as I can see the real you
The real you
The real you

I won't let you pull me down
I got my shit together now
I won't let you pull me down
I got my shit together

It's just the way I see you
I only see the real you

You can't swallow me
I'm jagged as the pill you choke on
You can't swallow me
As long as I can see

Everything's changed
All ties are strained (to say the least)
Everything's change
