Eightball, hanging overhead
Flushed out like Frankenstein
One more, for the living dead
That's not, me this time

Knocked down, I've been down before
Yet still we bare the load
If I would, want it anymore
I just might explode

All your heroes have died and left you to
Rise from the ashes and live for today

Can you take it all
When we're standing tall
We don't need a wall, built around us
Jump into the flame
One and all the same
We won't feel the pain
Thick is the skin, thick is the skin - yeah!

Outside, still looking in
I'll keep what I've made mine
Timebomb strapped to my chin
Step down or fall in line

All your heroes have died and left you to
Rise from the ashes and live for today

Can you take it all
When we're standing tall
We don't need a wall, built around us
Jump into the flame
One and all the same
We won't feel the pain
Thick is the skin, thick is the skin - yeah!

Hey [x15]

[Solo]

Can you take it all
When we're standing tall
We don't need a wall, built around us
Jump into the flame
One and all the same
We won't feel the pain
Thick is the skin

Can you take it all
When we're standing tall
We don't need a wall, built around us
Jump into the flame
One and all the same
We won't feel the pain
Thick is the skin, thick is the skin
Thick is the skin, thick is the skin - yeah!

Hey [x15]
