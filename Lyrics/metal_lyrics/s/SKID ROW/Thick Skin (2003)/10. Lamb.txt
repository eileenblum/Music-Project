I have been here for so long
I've carried all the weight
'Til something pulls me underneath the tide
Climb to where the air is thin
so I can breathe again
Still it makes me wonder deep inside

Nothing's free
No one bleeds
We're all machines

Shadows of you sins are following you
When it sucks you in, it's swallowing you
King of the mountain, that's what I am
Everybody's someone else's sacrificial lamb

Space between the world and me defying gravity
'Til something pulls me closer to the ground
Drink the chemicals we spill
Our eye is on the kill
While hell is freezing over, over

Nothing's free
No one bleeds
We're all machines

Shadows of you sins are following you
When it sucks you in, it's swallowing you
King of the mountain, that's what I am
Everybody's someone else's sacrificial lamb

[Solo]

Shadows of you sins are following you
When it sucks you in, it's swallowing you
King of the mountain, that's what I am
Everybody's someone else's sacrificial..

Shadows of you sins are following you
When it sucks you in, it's swallowing you
King of the mountain, that's what I am
Everybody's someone else's sacrificial lamb

Lamb!!
Ahhh!!!!
