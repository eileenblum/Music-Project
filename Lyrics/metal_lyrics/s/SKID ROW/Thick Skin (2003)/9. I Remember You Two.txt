Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
But when you needed me I came through
And when you needed me I came through

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand?
Love letter's innocence - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, and every endless day
I wanna hear you say I remember you

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind but you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand?
Love letter's innocence - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, and every endless day
I wanna hear you say I remember you

We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand?
Love letter's innocence - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, and every endless day
I wanna hear you say I remember you

Remember you
Remember you
Remember you
Remember you
Remember you
Remember you
You you you you you
1 2 3 4!
