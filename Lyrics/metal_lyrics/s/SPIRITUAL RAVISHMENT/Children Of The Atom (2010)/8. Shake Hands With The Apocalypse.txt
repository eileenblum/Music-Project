Devilâs words that uphold the anger
Break these still for forgiven minds,
False emerging random savior
Revenous will need to die!
Wolves are running loose,
Lighting up the fuse.

Your rights denied,
Nowhere to hide,
They make me sickâ¦
Nuke the bastards while they sleep!

Strugling to breach the surface,
Blinded by fear 
And thou shalt serve my willâ¦

Trying to save the ammo,
One shot kill
You may fire at willâ¦

Fast increasing vermin hunger
Haunted by the bastardâs eyes,
Desperate lust for resolution 
I will feed your need to die!

And everytime we fight is time to bleed
Break you down!
