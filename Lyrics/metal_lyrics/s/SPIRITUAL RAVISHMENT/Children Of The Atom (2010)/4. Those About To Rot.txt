The underground solution,
While mother holds her child
Indoors survivors dwell now,
Hidden from the light!
Hidden from the light!

Abandoning all reason, 
Sinking in hollow ground,
Apocalypse came with a 
Deafening sound! 
Deafening sound.!

Wait, this strange anomally
Is talking to me, is talking to me
Wait, it sees inside of me
Messing with me, messing with me!
And If I got what it takes, 
Iâll whipe the blood off my face
The system, God and his son
Are at the point of a gunâ¦
Your eyes are filled with regret,
The terror comes from the depth,
The end is now coming near
Everything is burned down now!

I will go insane and I will take you with me!
Smell in the air, stench of despair
Iâll find a way, to make me insaneâ¦

I will go insane and I will take you with me!

The land of retribution, conquering us all
Finding no solution, waiting for the fall
Strange anomaly is talking to me 
Sees inside of me!

Iâm nothing more than a rotting piece of flesh!
