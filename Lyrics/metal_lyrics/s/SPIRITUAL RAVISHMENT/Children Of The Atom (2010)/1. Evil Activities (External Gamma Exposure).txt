Governed by disbelief,
Prepared to face the catastrophy,
The world is on its knees!
Itâs time for man with earth to collide.

This is the time when even brave men resign
The weak are tremblingâ¦
Itâs time for man with earth to collide.

Weâre baptised 
In your lies,
Beauty dies
Lit up skies.

Take the pill,
Ingestion,
The  birth of
Deception.
