The system cracks , genes of a killer
The great depression, nothing seems clearerâ¦
Driven by hate, blinded by greed,
Conforting causes to bury the truth.

Run for your life!
Horizon broken by a 
mushroom cloudâ¦
The bodies twist and turn,
Karma to burn!
Each man is on his own 
Chemistry won!

Defleshed and drained of hope,
They look at meâ¦
No god could win a war
Against humanity.

They show no regret, 
They just deliver,
Pushed into frenzyes,
Make you a believerâ¦

Covering all, descending fire
Salvation's at hand, as the bodies pile upâ¦

Killing my ownâ¦
Counting the losses, 
Wages of war,
The oceans start to boil
Blood painted soil!
Raviging all that's left  
The end for all!

Breathe in the fire
With every breath you take!
Viral desire
Of releasing the hateâ¦
