Your voice shows suffering,
Vital signs altering
In battle and deceit,
Your flesh is all I need!

This faith abandoned me - 
In painâ¦
Blood dripping down on me - 
Rainâ¦

You should ask yourself why
Did you deserve to dieâ¦
You should ask yourself what kind of god
Would set such carnage to a start.

Your voice shows suffering,
It bleeds me from within
You whore you should have runâ¦
The part that hurts has just begun.

Now!
Die, die!
Why the fuck arenât you willing to fight?!
Enraged out of sight, Iâll do some killing tonight
I swear I wonât just end your agony,
Your voice, your cries are just arousing me.
