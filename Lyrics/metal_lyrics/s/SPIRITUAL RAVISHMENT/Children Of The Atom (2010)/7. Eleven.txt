âThus I clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen forth of holy 
writ and seem a saint when most I play the devil!â
Come forth untold, you have no place to redeem
Face down, you are delivered to sin
Old men shake hand our aching heads,
The flesh you consume is devoured by Gods.

Nobody dies tonight, not without a fight!

Iâll show no proof of faith to you,
You know I will just keep pushing throughâ¦
Offensive stance our world demands,
The flesh you consume is devoured by Gods.

Nobody dies tonight, not without a fight!

Everything you know is about to changeâ¦
Falling back, fear still intact!
This enlighting thing that fills your chest is rage
Falling back, fear still intact!
