Still something's missing from this goddamned life of mine!

Even now with your god at my feet,
I canât find the payback that I seek
This burden will be forever mine to keep,
Even now with your god at my feet!

Let me be your graveâ¦
You promised that youâd die!
Carrier of the stainâ¦
You must be burned alive!

Opression, that is enforced by me
Upon your sick beingâ¦
Redemption, in your flesh I must find
Burry your face in time
Protection, against my own self,
Against my own hatred
Mutilation, breathening the stench 
That bypassed your defense.

Heâs here just to easen your weight, carry your burden
Itâs a shame that youâre going home, death is at hand now
Protection, against my own self,
Against my own hatred
Redemption, in your flesh I must find
Burry your face in time

So  you thought this might be the end,
But I wont be denied!
Before my fury youâll neverstand alive.

Even now with your god at my feet!
