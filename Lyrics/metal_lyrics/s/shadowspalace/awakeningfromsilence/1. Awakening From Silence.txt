From the darkness I'll be born again
So be aware the time is soon here at hand
Tell me how many miles I've walked to find this truth
You can bet I lost the best part of my youth

But I am here and I would die for mankind
Now this whisper set me free

When the spell of the night comes to me
This curse will go on and on
Now destiny is calling me to fight
The fool that I was has to fall

Have you seen the falling of our old world.
Only betrayals lies and cruelties.

But I am here and I would die for mankind
Now this whisper set me free

When the spell of the night comes to me
This curse will go on and on
Destiny is calling me to fight
The fool that I was has to fall

When the spell of the night comes to me
This curse will go on and on
Destiny is calling me to fight
The fool that I was is lost in the past
