They say
That once you're wounded

You can't do shit but bleed the same
As everyone would do
But you look like you wanted to

And then, again,
You scream you're hurt
So bad
And say things that
I can't forget...

You seem to find pleasure in this
Claiming you're hurt
By someone else's failure
I can't (I can't) I can't forget
How far you've gone
And when everything we've done
From the start

Will stand in front of us
You'll understand the reasons
Why this has come to an end...
And when everything we've done
From the start
Will stand in front of us...
Staring at the edge of the world

You're there, coming crawling
Staring at the edge of the world
I see
You're the fallen one
You're the fallen...
All your reasons are now falling to the floor
And all your reasons are falling to the fucking floor

Your time has come to fade away (fade away)
Your time has come to fade away
Fade...away...
If that's the price, I call it quits
If that's the price
I'm calling it quits
When everything we've done

Will all be left behind
Will you be there waiting for more?
You won't have chance to find me
I ain't coming back for more
Coming back for more

And I tell you this: this time I won't forget

When everything we've done

Will all be left behind
Will you be there waiting for more?
How the fuck could I forget?
