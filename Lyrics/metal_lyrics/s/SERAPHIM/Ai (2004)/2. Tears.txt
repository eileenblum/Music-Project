I forgot distress with a free mind
You never show me any hope between your eyes
Love, peel off gradually
Aspiration deeply!

I'm holding you but shivers pass through me
A mysterious riddle from my heart
I feel depressed in the darkness
The suspicion that intruded itself into my mind

Taste a sweet illusion, a revelation, sternly cool and unmoved
Witty day &amp; night with tender sentiments
I never know why I am walking into the trap?

The heart with joy &amp; sadness, suddenly sublime the tears of love for you!
Obscurity! Sleep will forget to part the love &amp; affection

Sit in a swing in the core of the night
I can't comprehend any true heartiness you have
Sea, dip down day by day
Profundity in memory!

Traces of tears in your eyes down to the earth's core, reflection of destiny
Turbulent and surging, flooded affection
Who's gonna shed the teardrops that fall in loneliness?
