Love in moonless night, reaching to the red sky
I don't care, sin &amp; desire, face to face, the sorrow of the world

Don't leave me now, I'm lost in thought, a swivel nightmare
Before the love , carry the chains, metamorphosis!
If you can't see my sorrow crying hardly
The burning heart in precipice never ends

The conceited dark lip, pecks at disheveled heart &amp; soul
It's hard to set me free for salvation, turn around dissolve in chaos

The earth, unprincipled with fear, dark night, overspread the thorns
Tears drop like cataclysm's fall, drifting in never ever lands...

Suddenly, light the red sun with a candle's flame, shine the future...
A guilty sleepless night with an unfree heart
Cheerlessly, walk through the distant gleam of eyes, To be gone...

Search for traceless high sky, even if I banish the right to love
It's you, makes my courage disappear
I can't recall before I was in love
