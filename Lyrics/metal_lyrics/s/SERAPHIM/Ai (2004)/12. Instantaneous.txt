An ignorant perplexing twist of the misted unreal
Under the seal of repentance, I don't know why?

Heartless cruel destiny made the soul helpless
Finally, can not be classified
The weakening spirits tremblingly walk on a perished paradise
Betrayal nihility comes after confusion

Ah! my ruthless mind can't find your lonely heart to become reality

I'm asking myself , is it hard to be in love?
The sad fascination, there's only-

Inner lids of your eyes, searching the old times
Even though riding in the sky
Across the storm wind in a snowy ice world &amp; deep black horizon
There's merely cleaving a wish, calmly facing the afterlife

Ah! degenerate lonely heart deepest inside, vanished in foretime

An instantaneous love's encroaching my heart
In the quietest time with lasting love &amp; affection
A cloudy sky comes with fading memory
The silence in my mind for passing time in remembrance

The day dawned calmly and the morning sun danced away
A soul returns the burning desire

The burning desire is flaming destiny in the end
Love heaps up to hate, the dying resentment
Forget the exhausting soul &amp; disconsolateness in midsummer night

A carefree mind was deep in thought beneath the sky
Long for love, a telling fell
I can see the glorious splendor around me
Breaking out of the transient eternity

Continuously in the world, aspired to a tough problem
Unbeknown limitless sky, break out, abyss

An instantaneous love's of contribution
Follows you revolves around your heart
The shinning starlight reborn to remember me
I inform my soul far away from terrestrial despair
