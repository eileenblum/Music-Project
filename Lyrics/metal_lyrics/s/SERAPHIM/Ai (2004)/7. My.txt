Let my mood into wander, misted alone
Draw my breaking heart out, torn apart
I'm stupefied when I look back, who will comprehend?
Searching losing foretime to remember

Unbeknown destiny's come, a blazing heart
Icebound this stolen world, back again

Despondency alone, drown into a fake forgotten tale
For my love, I'm unwilling to leave
Walk alone leisurely, don't let tears down before your eyes
I'm staring at you in a hush, there's only sadness

Sorrowful nightingale, into whisper
Painful nightmare of past time is drifting
I'm a hypocrite, I'm afraid to hide in dark corner
When can I change the memory of a lifetime

A slight frown between your eyes for separation
Despondent in this quiet lonely night

Despondency alone, I'm fading away &amp; follow your dream
For my love, stifling to exist
Walk alone leisurely, reach your hands touch my face slightly
Such an everlasting love, but I can't hold back

All the love &amp; affection has broken away
A mutter crying...
When I look at you
