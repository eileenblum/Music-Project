Rainy night, tears fall down all over the sky, listen to silence
Smoke around, the kind tenderness in the night, leaving daybreak sadly

Peaceful dreamland &amp; serene blue sea, reveal a hidden lonely heart
Come back again! infinite love

Desperate, meditate on a tough problem
It's an endless afterworld, searching the love in memory

I heard the sigh of sorrow, calm &amp; steady the bloody cold heart
Striking lofty body, standing in predicament
Spread your wings &amp; fly away, the rapacious eyes lost in nowhere
On the verge of death it will be peaceful, eternal stairway where will I go?

Under breath, intone the song of my mind for a crying spirit
Joyous heart, affection will soon disappear, where can I go for?

Suffer distress &amp; painful sorrow turn into a wild daydream
Wake me up, infinite love

Desperate, there's nothing to regret
No answer in the air, cherish yourself, night &amp; day

The evil dark night caresses, burn down to immortal memory
The cruel demon's sorcery, move on abyss of misery
Spread your wings &amp; fly away, the rapacious eyes lost in nowhere
On the verge of death it will be peaceful, eternal stairway where will I go?

Love, instigates in me deep and hard, contributes the naked gold shackle
