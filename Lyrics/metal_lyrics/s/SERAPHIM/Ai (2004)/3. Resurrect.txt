Time had faded away, passing through the vain world
I'm searching for a serious thought no matter who you are
your spirit reminds me again in the depth of my soul

Come alone, life &amp; death, the undying symbol

If you'll resurrect rise from our love
There's no wind, no fear before I die
Caprice of you like the rush of wind
Blow in a strange paradise

Chase the cloudiness, spread like wildfire gather the spirit eventually
A heap of stones into confusion, emotional pathway
Your lifeblood's engraved upon the seals of paradise

Night is complex, love &amp; hate, sleepless in the dark night

If I'll resurrect rise from our love
Waiting for the silence just let it go
Give me a fearlessly peaceful heart
Contribute yourself!
