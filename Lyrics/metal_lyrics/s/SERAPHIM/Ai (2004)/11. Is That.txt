Is that love ? I'm wondering... I inquire into unfriended me

Last caress before my eyes, the sorrow comes after me

The empty view of your back leaves me your handwriting
The writing on the wall engraved upon a lonely eternity
No dispel for yes or no, finally a fading memory
Just tell me is that love?

Is that love ? I suspect... there's no answer in the air

Unceasing searching, even though there's no end

Incomplete shades of me reflect my destiny
Our traces in those days, the heartless surge's invading me
No matter if it's right or wrong, there's no mean for contention
What I care is that love?

Now that our fate is destined but then such a kind of ending...
