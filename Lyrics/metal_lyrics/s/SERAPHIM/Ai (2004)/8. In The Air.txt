Windbreak, suddenly scatters away
Gloomy flood-tides keep rise and fall
Tread on ruthless human heart
Sunset in icy polar regions

Propoundly fate is teasing, insipid life's on the way

Love in confusion can't take away the truth, our love is in the air
Magnify the soul without trace, drag into the way of nonlife

A shiver down is cold &amp; fear
The star had slept in deep quiet sea
Windstorm breaks a dim memory
Vanished into a limitless dream

The wind conceals loneliness, drifts from town to town
An earnest rigidity!
Love is easily broken of stranger's fate
Is it right or wrong?

Stubborn, insist upon betrayal, dishearten me fast
Even makes my heartache, just breaking the chain

Agitating love turns round &amp; round again, our love is in the air
Monologue of love resplendently may disappear into the blue
