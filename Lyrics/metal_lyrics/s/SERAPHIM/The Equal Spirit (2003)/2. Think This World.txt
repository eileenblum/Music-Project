Dying people chase the fantasy, the satire of foolish mankind
Who is quizing the deceased? who will tread on revenant?

Affected body drunk and dissipate, A miserable life of sorrow
You'll be exposed in danger, therefore earth-shaking that you've made

Ah Think this world's brutality, back into darkness
The wreckage is burning!

Quit wishes to decease, calmity!
The devil in deep thought, chaoes!

Stay me in the end, live in death crisis
The deep meditation, finally stop the end

Distress will cure complete, passing through the sense of guilt
Cold and cruel alternation, treat your broken heart to infinity

Fire extinguished, far leave the deadline

Ah Think this world so dreary, immortal hurting
Disgusting old carcass
