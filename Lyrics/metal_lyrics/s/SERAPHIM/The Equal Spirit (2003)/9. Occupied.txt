Symbol of nature, overspread a pool of blood
Dark night painting canvas, crying the curtain falls

Despite windstorm in sphere, gloomy air-raid
I still intone alone on the verge of destiny

Daylights confide to sky, a passing of time limitless

Fractured shelf of stone, bedevilment capsized
Just like manacled handcuffs, return from the pain

Swivel over the corruption land, poison your heart dip down to edge
The promise in mirror lens, leave the bitter and sad tears
Heading for loathe purgatory, occupied in the unreal

Silence of the night, brewing the enmity and hope
Racing in new dawn, the soul evil debates

Even withered desire into flow of tears
The saddest echo in turn, fatality of grief

Destroy a rigid heart, ebullient fire from Hades

A greed of gain flash, fear of caducity
Devouring haggard secret, glory of ice cold
