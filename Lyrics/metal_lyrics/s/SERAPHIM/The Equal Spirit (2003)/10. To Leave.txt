Full of scary spindrift, leave me to the unbeknownst
Shining pass through window infinitely

Spatial finish end line, far away from madness
I just feel my wings melt in darkness

To leave, gathering sore reality
Crying constantly late at night
Intrepid, raise a shout
In rainstorm with quiet heart

Cut through dimly memory, purely build the guilty
Collect the painful scar and bad luck

Trembling bitter thin lip, cold wind in starless night
I just feel the ice snow coagulated

To leave, tide of dispirit sadness
A deep intense sigh in ambiguous
No regret but loneliness
Look back again so far away

Sin, indulged, overflows the grief
Bury quit to abyss, Interrupted in this world

Blue sea, a surge wave, sing a sad song of night
Starlit night, loneliness, deliberate night by night
