The hidden sky light, miserable crude abode
Remain in ancient, can't figure right or wrong?

The pallid hardness rest deeply
The tears in your eyes, invisibly disappear

My heart is dying, flash the light, shine the heat
Bitter sweet's rippling, forget to hate, there's no way in the end

The earth as hard as nails, a silent advice
The inflamed memory, completely despairs

A false god laughs at lust and greed
A dreaming passion burns in a dying fire

My heart is dying, there's no cold, there's no fear
Destroy bad screaming, take me away to lonesome paradise
