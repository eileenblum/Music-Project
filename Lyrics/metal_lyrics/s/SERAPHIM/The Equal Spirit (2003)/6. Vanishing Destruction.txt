Seize the peaceful moonlight, coronation of a pure soul
Nothing in this crazy world's easy to catch
Should I try to chase my destiny?

Sacred world, sorrow that I praise
Heavenly, the burning saint fire

Phantasmic magic's still remain
Embarrassed breathless to be a circle in the air
Intensive thoughts throwing down to hell
Widespread affliction, vanishing destruction!

Obscure innocent ages, betray your mind to remember
As if in the mystery, present and past
I wonder whether I can fly away

Fatality, the rainbow reflected
Dark clouds night, much more sadness

A puzzled face is fading away
Despair's tears cry out, there's no boundary in the end
Tears of blood never show again
Disseminate the plaint, vanishing destruction!
