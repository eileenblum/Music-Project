Memory dies in darkness, falling down teardrops in your eyes
Pass emotion in wandering, flow in heart of distress

Ah
The fall of serious thought

Suddenly defeatd, heartless regret wore out your fate
A fissure affection is passing away, entangle dying

Try harder, forget and forgive, a tragic destiny

Empty afflicted feeling, a torture of heart answered from hell
Unable to riddle out, cooling streaming hot mind

Ah
Nothing to depend upon

Passionate in a trice, love, hate, regret , a violent storm way
The dreaming illusion's time is passing by, no more attachment
