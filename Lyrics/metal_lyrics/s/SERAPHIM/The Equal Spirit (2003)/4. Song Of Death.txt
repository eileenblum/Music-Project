Evil crowd wicked gathering, dark stands still full of sorrow
Gorgon creeps aound a grave, hush of shadow piercingly cold

Marvel of love incompletely, moonlight cold as ice, ice cold painful
suffering
Separation, hidden heavenly bodies

Fetter the soul in the air, handcuff the mind back to hell
Sea of heartbreak, cuts like a knife, spirit withered strength
exhausted

I find the last euthanasia, a cloudy sky night, night sky has
confused me
Never ends, obsturct all creatures'sight

Sunset with burning fire till midnight, black sky at night, light in your
eyes
Imprison sparkle fade to darkness, gloomy devil die in the red
storm

Don't be sad
The soul will transmigrate, back again!
