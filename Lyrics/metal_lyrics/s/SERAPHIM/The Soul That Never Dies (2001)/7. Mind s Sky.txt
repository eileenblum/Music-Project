Search, endless way, stand alone, slow down footstep
Left alone, eyes pallid, then reveal infinite sadness
At a loss, hold my hands, the deep inside memories of mine

[Solo]

Invading thoughts of people at moment
A fierce storm destroy heart of mercy
Steal the peace and dispirit me away
Human selfish was exposed in night
Just throw disremember out to shoulder
Confession of mind turn to the end

[Chorus:]
Wake up the angel coming from outside's world before twilight
Just bringing back the blue blue sky spatter the world
Windfall phantom stirring, brilliant achievement of my mind's sky

Flesh desire's upside down, that is my shiver hands
A pain of jealousy, imprison all your charm
Engrave upon the moon, sincere repair
Throw on holy respect, look up the sky of mind

[Solo]

Suspect surround me, try hard sleepless
I await tomorrow, lead me peace and silence

[Chorus]
