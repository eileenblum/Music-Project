Hanging on, dazzle confound, The glorious metal wall
Look all around inwardly
Marvelous, strange reverie, mixing the fascination
Fallen and scattered

Remain attracting me, shining through the peaceful land
Out sail within my mind, free from anxiety

The surf is dumping fury, throw the frost away for long long time
The burning flame around me, immortal silence

Spiritless, misted way, dark cold night, cold as ice
Spirit closing
Stand alone, old skeleton, it will be melted your heart
Spread to forever

Dream embezzle myself, linking to the dark cold night
Shinning on wonderland, transmit from my heart

Profounded depths of your eyes, try to stop your footstep for a while
Try to find a way out, immortal silence

[Solo]

Remain attracting me...
