Stupidly, error too, wrongdoing don't forgive
Quit body, love and hate, tears will wash shameful blot
Fearless, pretend to moan, fate is sad

[Chorus:]
Suddenly, fire lotus just burning into darkness
That is over destroy being deadline mean to live forever

Being with loneliness quietly, obstinate take place
through the end of the way

[Solo]

Angry, stifle sigh, tear arms engrave apart
Through valley, pass river, across the rage of chute
Forget... devotion with tears, shape of return

The sea of cloud falling into diffusion, purity from sin
All my heart was lost beside the border
the evil surge brim Holding the terrible space of flame
Carry on the domain of peaceful silence

There's no limit in love or hate
It was easy destroying
No matter what encroached on us
Besiege my mind, nothing above...

[Solo]

[Chorus]
