Don't be wrath, close the age, go through Acheron
The innocent crowd on a line, gathered to the end

Avoid making promises, searching missing spirit
Entreated to win equal justice, but there's the fire from prison
I can't help myself for deadness

[Chorus:]
It's burning lifetime, vermilion of future
The soul that never dies turn into eternity

Bleeding at present, hang on the cruel wall
Expression of panic, straight down to Tartarus

Sorrow still can't let go, hard to keep and hard to leave

Nothing could tears apart, that's heartless or that's kind of true love
An everlasting soul, blowing to the unknown century

[Solo]

Cast off the false carcass, carry on hard shackle
Waiting for the truth is coming, although there is no deadline
I exclaim for precious belief

[Chorus]
