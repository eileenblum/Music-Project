Rusted faces, withered body, see the tears run down my dress
Heartless quiet peace, besiege the soul, decadence over my mind

Joyful heart and sadness, separation

[Chorus:]
My heart has fled away, crisis by me confused
Our fate has faded away, forget the withered dreamland

Silent regrets, conceal trembling, gentle whimper to cry out
Dried up expression, fearful danger, dispirit during nighttime

No matter what it may be, no more return

[Chorus]

Increase empty memory, emptiness
Cross the storm wind, there's no way in the end

[Solo]
