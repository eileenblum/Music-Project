Conceit in storm of heartless, empty danger illusion
Mentally stupefied of body exposed
The furious mind is callused with hatred
Pathetic heartbeat comes to an end
Terrible screaming at night close in the air

Cold cruel punishment, lonely endless night
I fell down to hell, dark night cover the earth
You beg for pity, the guilt is profound

[Chorus:]
Forever, altering your evil forever
Unstable consideration start to release
The ponderous eyes, regret to tire out
Extend to the other side may rest in peace

Tears just like cataclysm, crag sounds all over the skies
Blue-eyed fill full of pain, ennoble stately
Pray of piety and brightness of vanity
Midnight resounding voices fade away
Ferocious and cruel nightmare, will be exorcised

Overdraft boundless, foresee accurately
Night, dispose shallow beach, learn to know the great billow
Moon, unremitting sadness in drops

Forever, farewell to your pain forever
Overlooking your sorrow come cross the town
Time deceive itself, heavenly bodies
Realize to the other side may rest in peace

[Solo]

[Chorus]
