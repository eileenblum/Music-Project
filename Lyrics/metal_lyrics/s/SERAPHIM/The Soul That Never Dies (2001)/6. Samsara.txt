Turn into in great disorder, ascendancy reflect
Unreasonable wasteful without fear
Desire expends infinitely, no one can escape
All over bramble nearly abyss of Sheol

Turn over! The darkness give me new life
Tremble and conceit
Feel sorrow! night come with me to break out
just sink into the dead sea

Creature just like a wither tree, stupid and stubborn to posterity
Samsara circle around eternity, no eternal life

Criticize the evil sinner, despise the base soul
Hardships time is fleeting, I don't care
Tired of the unpeaceful life, detest obscuration
Die in under earth get reborn again

Creature just like a meditation with purity induce to comfort
Samsara soothe my heart and my soul, suddenly fade away

[Solo]

Red is dream of burning fire, praise to death and also praise life
light to fire those fierce torches, light of secret just so faraway

Turn over! The darkness gives me new life...
