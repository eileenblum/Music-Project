Tveimur jafnfljÃ³tum
Tiplar yfir sandinn
LandiÃ° suÃ°ur lokkar
TÃ­minn hÃ¡lfnaÃ°ur
SÃ¶muleiÃ°is vandinn
AndiÃ° svala okkar
Enginn Ã¾ekkir til
GjÃ¶rÃ°a eÃ°a gÃ¶ngu
Vona sinna valdur
GÃ¶mlu konunnar
Endur fyrir lÃ¶ngu
Kona vindur kaldur
SkÃ³rinn Gatslitinn
SkÃ¶rÃ° eru Ã­ kÃ¡pu
LÃ¦kir frosnir leka
Skemmir gÃ¶ngu meÃ°
SÃ¶gum eÃ°a drÃ¡pu
FlÃ¦kir Ã­sinn fleka
Reynslan Ãskune
RÃºÃ°i inn aÃ° skinni
Tapa laufin trjÃ¡num
RÃ­fur gÃ¶mul sÃ¡r
SlitrÃ³tt bernskuminni
Gapa klettar gjÃ¡num

[Chorus:]
ÃaÃ° var haust, viÃ° Ã¾Ã¶gÃ°um
Allt vort traust, viÃ° Ã¡ Ã¾ig lÃ¶gÃ°um
Endalaust en lÃ­tiÃ° sÃ¶gÃ°um
ÃaÃ° var haust, viÃ° Ã¾Ã¶Ã°um

FerÃ°ast einsÃ¶mul
FararskjÃ³tinn enginn
GjÃ¡num klettar gapa
FÃ©lagsskapurinn allur
Ãr sÃ©r genginn
TrjÃ¡num laufin tapa
Kaldur vindurinn
KlÃ³num sÃ­num sekkur
Fleka Ã­sinn flÃ¦kir

Leka frosnir lÃ¦kir
LiÃ°iÃ° sumariÃ°
LÃ¦kkar sÃ³l og dofnar
Kaldur vindur kona
Leggst Ã¾ar undir stein
Ãrmagna og sofnar
Valdur sinna vona
Leikur andlitiÃ°
LjÃ³srauÃ° morgunglÃ¦ta
Okkar svala andiÃ°
LÃ­kt og Brynhildar
GoÃ°in hennar gÃ¦ta
Lokkar suÃ°ur-landiÃ°

[Chorus:]
ÃaÃ° var haust, viÃ° Ã¾Ã¶gÃ°um
Allt vort traust, viÃ° Ã¡ Ã¾ig lÃ¶gÃ°um
Endalaust en lÃ­tiÃ° sÃ¶gÃ°um

Endalaust en lÃ­tiÃ° sÃ¶gÃ°um
ÃaÃ° var haust [2x], viÃ° Ã¾Ã¶gÃ°um

[English translation:]

Striding quick across the sands
The south, it calls us
Half our time and half our trouble stands
Fresh winds befall us
No-one knows where fate will chime
What your destiny holds
For the crone, once upon a time
Woman, wind so cold
Shoes worn, cape is frayed
Frozen streams are weeping
Foul path with rhymes is laid
Tangled floes are sweeping
Fields of innocence
No more than an ember
Trees will lose their awning
Old wounds opened by
What she will remember
Mountainâs wounds are yawning

Leaves they turned, no word spoken
Trust unearned, time unbroken
Silence learned, faith itâs token
Leaves they turned, no word spoken

Lonesome traveller, searches out her way
Mountainâs wounds are yawning
No-one next to her, nothing more to say
Trees will lose their awning
Wind-claws rend her flesh, silent is her scream
Tangled floes are sweeping
Blue hands trembling, drinking from a stream
Frozen streams are weeping
Summerâs day is gone, sun is sinking low
Woman, wind so cold
Lays down by a rock, sleeping in the snow
What your destiny holds
Red dawn strokes the face of a frozen sleeper
Fresh winds befall us
Just like Brynhildur, the Gods will be her keepers
The south, it calls us

Leaves they turned, no word spoken
Trust unearned, time unbroken
Silence learned, faith itâs token
Leaves they turned,
Leaves they turned, no word spoken
Leaves they turned, turned to cinder
Our trust burned, you the tinder
Silence learned, faith itâs token
Leaves they turned,
Leaves they turned, no word spoken
Leaves they turned, rocks their landing
Our trust spurned, you left standing
Silence learned, faith itâs token
Leaves they turned,
Leaves they turned, no word spoken
