Undan Loka Fenrir fÃ¦ddist,
fullur hroka vÃ­st var sagt.
Er var Ã¾oka Ã¾Ã¡ hann fÃ¦ddist,
Ã¾ungbÃ¦rt ok Ã¡ heiminn lagt.

NÃº var gaumur aÃ° Ã¾vÃ­ gefinn,
greri aumur hvolpur fljÃ³tt.
TÃ­minn naumur, enginn efinn,
Ã¡ hann tauminn Ã¾yrfti skjÃ³tt.

Fyrrstan LÃ¦Ã°ing fengu goÃ°in,
Fenri Ã¾rÃ¦Ã°i komu Ã¡.
Ãlfur skÃ¦Ã°ur, ljÃ³tur, loÃ°inn,
leikinn brÃ¦Ã°i sleit hann Ã¾Ã¡.

Ãegar DrÃ³mi Fenri festi
falskan dÃ³m Ã¾Ã¡ Ãºlfur hlaut.
ÃvÃ­ meÃ° klÃ³m og Ã¾rumubresti
Ã¾ennan frÃ³ma fjÃ¶tur braut.

Kattarins dynur, konunnar skegg,
kynngi mÃ­na yfir legg.
Bjarnarins sinar, bjargsins rÃ¦tur,
bÃ­Ã°um nÃº Ã­ skjÃ³li nÃ¦tur.
Fuglsins hrÃ¡ki, fisksins andi,
fyrir dverg er hÃ¦gur vandi.
MÃ¡nuÃ° gekk um margar gÃ¶tur,
mÃ©r aÃ° launum varÃ° sÃ¡ fjÃ¶tur.

FjÃ¶turinn er fjÃ¶trum grennri,
fÃ¡gÃ¦t, gÃ¶ldrÃ³tt dvergasmÃ­Ã°.
Ã Lyngva Ã¡Ã°ur lÃ¶gÃ°u Fenri,
laus hann veldur orrahrÃ­Ã°.

Hef Ã­ mÃ­num hÃ¶ndum Gleipni,
horfi mÃ³t glyrnum tveim.
Treysti Ã¡ ÃÃ°in, TÃ½ og Sleipni,
tak mig Ã¾ar og aftur heim.

SÃ¡ fjÃ¶tur er Ã¶Ã°rum fjÃ¶trum grennri,
fÃ¡gÃ¦t og gÃ¶ldrÃ³tt dvergasmÃ­Ã°.
Ã Lyngva Ã¾eir Ã¡Ã°ur lÃ¶gÃ°u Fenri,
laus hann nÃº veldur orrahrÃ­Ã°.

Hef Ã©g Ã­ minum hÃ¶ndum Gleipni,
horfi Ã¡ mÃ³ti glyrnum tveim.
Treysti Ã¡ ÃÃ°in, TÃ½ og Sleipni,
takiÃ° mig Ã¾ar og aftur heim.

[English translation:]

From Loki Fenrir was born
Full of arrogance it was said
The world was foggy when he was birthed
A heavy burden laid on the world

Now it was noticed that
The poor whelp grew fast
Time was scanty, doubt was none
Promptly leashed the beast should be

Firstly LÃ¦Ã°ing the gods were given
The leash was threaded round Fenrirâs neck
The wolf was forceful, ugly, hairy
With easy wrath the leash he broke.

When DrÃ³mi harnessed Fenrir
A false judgement upon the wolf.
With claws and a thundering crash
That honest leash the wolf tore.

The catâs footsteps, the womanâs beard,
My magic over this I lay.
The bearâs sinews, the mountainâs roots
Now we wait under the cover of shadow.
The birdâs spit, the fishâs breath,
Simple creation for a dwarf.
A month I wandered many streets,
My payment was that very leash.

The leash is thinner than all the others,
Rare and magical dwarfish construct.
To the island of Lyngvi Fenrir was taken,
Loose he causes much mischief.

Have in my hands the leash Gleipnir
Look into his evil eyes.
Trusting in ÃÃ°inn, TÃ½r and Sleipnir,
Theyâll take me there and back again.

The leash is thinner than all leashes,
A Rare and magical dwarfish construct.
Before they Fenrir to Lyngvi took
Loose he causes much mischief.

I have in my hands the leash Gleipnir.
Look into his evil eyes.
Trusting in ÃÃ°inn, TÃ½r and Sleipnir
Take me there and back again.
