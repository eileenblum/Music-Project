Narfa Ã©g hitti er nÃ³ttin var liÃ°in,
NiflheimahliÃ°in.
Kom hann Ã­ hnakki Ã¡ kolsvÃ¶rtum fola,
kÃ³lnaÃ°i gola.
StarÃ°i Ã¡ okkur meÃ° stingandi augum,
staÃ°urinn umkringdur vofum og draugum.
Ãrek hans var bÃºiÃ° og hugrekkiÃ° brostiÃ°,
beit okkur frostiÃ°.

Loki vill buga legg Ã¾inn og hug,
lÃ­tiÃ° Ã¾vÃ­ duga vopn og vÃ¶rn.
Hlusti nÃº hver sem heyrir Ã­ mÃ©r:
HÃ¦ttuleg eru Loka bÃ¶rn.

Hann Ã¾ekkir staÃ°inn sem hrÃ­mar og frystir,
Hel er hans systir.
SagÃ°i aÃ° nÃºna hann vildi mig vara
viÃ° Ã¾vÃ­ aÃ° fara
niÃ°ur til hennar sem Niflheimi stjÃ³rnar,
neyÃ°ir og pyntar og sveltir og fÃ³rnar.
BrÃ¡Ã°um Ã©g myndi svo bÃ¡gindum mÃ¦ta,
Brynhildi grÃ¦ta.

LÃ¦vÃ­s og slyng Ã¾au lÃ¦Ã°ast Ã­ hring,
lokka Ã¾ig kringum BÃ¦jartjÃ¶rn.
Hlusti nÃº hver sem heyrir Ã­ mÃ©r:
HÃ¦ttuleg eru Loka bÃ¶rn.

Vilja Ãºr leyni vinna Ã¾Ã©r mein,
villidÃ½r reynast hefnigjÃ¶rn.
Hlusti nÃº hver sem heyrir Ã­ mÃ©r:
HÃ¦ttuleg eru Loka bÃ¶rn.

Ãig vilja hryggja, Ã¾au eru stygg.
Ã¾agna mun Frigg og fÃ¶lna HÃ¶rn.
Hlusti nÃº hver sem heyrir Ã­ mÃ©r:
HÃttuleg eru Loka bÃ¶rn.

Loki vill buga legg Ã¾inn og hug,
lÃ­tiÃ° Ã¾vÃ­ duga vopn og vÃ¶rn.
Hlusti nÃº hver sem heyrir Ã­ mÃ©r:
HÃ¦ttuleg eru Loka bÃ¶rn.

[English translation:]

I met Narfi when the night was over,
by the gates of Niflheim.
He rode a pitch black horse,
the breeze grew colder.
He looked at us with piercing eyes,
the place was surrounded by spirits and ghosts.
His strength was spent and courage faltering,
the frost bit us.

Loki wants to crush your leg and your mind,
little help youâll get from your weapons and defenses.
Listen now, you who hear what I say:
Lokiâs children are dangerous.

He knows the place that ices over and freezes,
Hel6is his sister.
He said that he now wanted to warn me
against going
down to her who rules Niflheim,
forces and tortures and starves and sacrifices.
Soon I might meet such distress,
as to make Brynhildrcry.

Artful and clever they sneak around,
coax you around the BÃ¦jartjÃ¶rn.
Listen now, you who hear what I say:
Lokiâs children are dangerous.

They wish to harm you from a hiding place,
wild animals prove to be vengeful.
Listen now, you who hear what I say:
Lokiâs children are dangerous.

They want you to grieve, they are distrustful/loath.
Frigg will fall silent and HÃ¶rn will turn pale.
Listen now, you who hear what I say:
Lokiâs children are dangerous.

Loki wants to crush your leg and your mind,
little help youâll get from your weapons and defenses.
Listen now, you who hear what I say:
Lokiâs children are dangerous.
