"I've been washed away
By the waves of destiny,
Into an ocean of my own design.

Searching and seeking, hoping and praying.
Sewing and reaping, wandering, straying.

Why have these hands sought to destroy everything
When they should bring prosperity to the weak?

My lungs are heavy with demise as I climb
From the ashes, as a Phoenix. I will rise!
I will climb!
I will rise!

The rhetoric's been planted, the smallest seed.
In hopes that these words will bloom like leaves.

'As blind as we are to the wind, what else can we not see?
Will tainted honey ever taste as sweet?'
The question I've had, but lacked the courage to speak,
'Is it wrong to, just this once, dip our feet?'

Why have these hands sought to destroy everything
When they should bring prosperity to the weak?

Innovation is necessary, the outcome is revolutionary

With rhetoric that's planted, whose roots run deep,
My words now resound without deniability. 

'As blind as we are to the wind, what else can we not see?
Will tainted honey ever taste as sweet?'
The question I've had, but lacked the courage to speak,
'Is it wrong to, just this once, dip our feet?'
The faces reply with sheepish confirmation;
Eye-to-eye, we'll never meet. I stand above.

Lift up your chalice, and drink the honey.
Consume until you hear the tide in the glass;
And watch the dealings of a prophet unfold
Like petals of violet, drenched in royalty.

Innovation is necessary, the outcome is revolutionary."
