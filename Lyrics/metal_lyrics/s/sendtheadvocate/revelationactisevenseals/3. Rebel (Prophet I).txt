The weight of a crown can bend one's spine
Into the most grotesque shapes.
When the neck is burdened with heavy lies,
One sees the world in brand new ways.

I fear not men or beasts, nor the monsters of the sea;
Death by the coward's hand,
Or enslavement caused by wicked schemes.

Stringing together the clippings of a dying age,
The gaping fallacies beholden inside every page.
The truth lies inside the spacing a of white.
Those words hold no power, their weight is light. 

They say,
"Tame your tongue, bind your mouth.
You know He's listening."
But I say,
"Weigh your words, forget what you have heard,
Because I'm listening, there's fault in everything
He says."

I may lose the battle, but the fight will go ever on;
Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess.
The King calls me into His arms.

The weight of a crown can bend one's spine
Into the most grotesque shapes.
When the neck is burdened with heavy lies,
One sees the world in brand new ways.

Sharper than venom,
Darker than ravens,
He will tear the walls to the Kingdom to the ground.
Fabricating the need of His presence
To shatter the walls of his weak-minded peasants.

They say,
"Tame your tongue, bind your mouth.
You know He's listening."
But I say,
"Weigh your words, forget what you have heard,
Because I'm listening, there's fault in everything
He says."
