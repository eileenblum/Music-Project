"Run the seas dry, until they're cold and marrowless.
Let flame taste the rye; their filthy hands hold emptiness.
The true word is nigh, some will claim it's powerless.
They'll never see light through cylinders of faithlessness.

Do you recall all your fears?
Do you retain those insecurities?
What could crack stone so thick,
Or cause pure steel to corrode so quick?

I have constructed this kingdom,
On a foundation of moral perfection
This, I claim with the utmost conviction;
My passion and vigor will remain unwavered.

Listen to what the righteous say;
Where to work and where to play.
These fences keep you at bay.
Swear loyalty, how your head and pray.
Reach out your empty palms.
Feed yourself on empty psalms.
War and starvation will not heal contagion;
So, brothers and sisters, receive your salvation.

Do you recall all your fears?
Do you retain those insecurities?
What could crack stone so thick,
Or cause pure steel to corrode so quick?

I watched the crowd gather 'round.
Upon the head, they placed a crown.
Their cheers and praise began to mound.
I heard the choir roar,
'Make way! The Savior has come!
This is the day; the crusade has begun!'

Listen to what the righteous say;
Where to work and where to play.
These fences keep you at bay.
Swear loyalty, how your head and pray.
Reach out your empty palms.
Feed yourself on empty psalms.
War and starvation will not heal contagion;
So, brothers and sisters, I plea,
'Place your faith in me!'

'First they took our arms, next, came our rights,
To relinquish our free speech; our ability to fight.'

'Make way! The Savior has come!
This is the day; the crusade has begun!'
You're safe here!"
