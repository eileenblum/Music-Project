O, you fools!

How can you rely on these false prophecies?
You've fallen victim to the wiseacre's folly.

Your reign will one day wither, 
Just as a flower striving for light. 
Though it may not be my directive, 
Your bouquet sees naught but night.

By closing your eyes to wine
And turning from prophetic sight,
Or claiming to be Christ defined,
You'll drown in that honey that you hold so high.

Black days are upon us.
The equine quartet is nearer than we perceive.

I know that God will stand with me
Through every cry and every plea.
Hated and persecuted for my true beliefs
By the very nations that will bow on their knees.

I know, my God, you stand with me
I know you hear my every plea.

It's true, I have failed Him. God views me with beauty,
Though a grain of sand in the fingers of perfection.
This house is dark and cold, I've seen my demise.
In the wake of ruin, I've watched a child lead he fight.

(Though I am flawed, though I am weak,
Your face, forever, I will seek.
You make me humble, on my knees.
I will accept my destiny.
I reach my arms out, God.
I finally see you in my sight;
And I will stand behind the father,
He will lead the fight.)
