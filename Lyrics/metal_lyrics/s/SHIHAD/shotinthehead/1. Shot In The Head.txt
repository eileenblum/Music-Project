Will I be missed by this beautiful world?
Frozen in time
Too caught up in giving 'em hell
To know you're alive

And it's all right here
Will I be missed by this beautiful world?
And it's all right now

Like being shot in the head
Shot in the head
Shot into heaven
Shot into heaven

Well I've been hit by a dizzy spell
I want to make it alright
You know you had it in you
Wrong place, wrong time

And it's all right here
Will I be missed by this beautiful world?
And it's all right now

Like being shot in the head
Shot in the head
Shot into heaven
Shot into heaven

Without a hitch and when it goes
It's all you get to carry on
Because we can't go it alone
Go it alone
Go it alone
Nobody

Will I missed by this beautiful world?
Frozen in time
Life too short to live in hell
Fucking open your eyes

Like being shot in the head
Shot in the head
Shot into heaven
Shot into heaven

Shot in the head...
