Here's a song for all the lovers
All the prophets
All you conmen
Finally know the truth
Got a habit
You don't want it
Better grab it
Before it ends up over you
And I think that I finally understand
The truth is in your heart and in your hands
So pick yourself up and start again
This hell is freezing over

You can tell me all your problems
All your heartaches
Nothing changes
'Til you try something new
Though you want it
Can't afford it
Better grab it
Before it ends up over you

And I think that I finally understand
The truth is in your heart and in your hands
So pick yourself up and start again
So pick yourself up and start again
This hell is freezing over

This hell is freezing over
This hell is freezing over
This hell is freezing over
This hell is

And I think that I finally understand
The truth is in your heart and in your hands
So pick yourself up and start again
So pick yourself up and start again
This hell is freezing over
This hell is freezing over
