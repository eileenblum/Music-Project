Love is the new hate
And I don't care anymore
Whatever it takes
Got all the time in the world

It's not a game
So let the candle burn
Love is the new hate
It's time to turn and run

We're taking over
We're taking over

Love is the new hate
It's time turn and run

We're taking over

Love is the new hate
And I don't care anymore
Whatever it takes
Got all the time in the world

We're taking over
We're taking over
