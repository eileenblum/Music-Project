So now you hate the way you're feeling
But yesterday you had it all
Lets take it back to the beginning man
Before you hit a wall
You hit a wall

You got a cold heart on ya
Too much time on your own
But nobody saw

So worried about the outside
There's nothings going on in the inside
So worried about the outside
It's never gunna get you high

You think you've been mistreated
Now tell me who's responsible
You find out where you're needed
'til your ours
Nobody's own

You got a cold heart on ya
Too much time on your own
But nobody saw

So worried about the outside
There's nothings going on in the inside
So worried about the outside
It's never gunna get you high
No it's never gunna get you high
High yeah

Oh fuck that

So you say you've been mistreated
So you say you've been mistreated
So you say you've been mistreated
So you say you've been mistreated
So you say you've been cheated
