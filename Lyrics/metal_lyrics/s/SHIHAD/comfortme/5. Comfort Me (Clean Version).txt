Inside, I'm all twisted round
Feeling uptight and I can't come down
And I need someone to sell me
I'm safe again
And I need someone to tell me
That they really care

What have we become
Could you comfort me, comfort me
The whole world's come undone
Could you comfort me, comfort me

Back up, evolution here
All the sick ****s, being born to kill
They just need someone to sell them
They're safe again
They all need someone to tell them
That somebody cares

What have we become
Could you comfort me, comfort me
The whole world's come undone
Could you comfort me, comfort me

You're going to bring the world down
Bring the whole world down

What have we become
Could you comfort me, comfort me
The whole world's come undone
Could you comfort me, comfort me

What have we become
Could you comfort me, comfort me
The whole world's come undone
Could you comfort me, comfort me
