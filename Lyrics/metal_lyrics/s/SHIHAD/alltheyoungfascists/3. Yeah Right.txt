Never wanted to save the bait (yeah)
It was the fault of the CIA (yeah)
There's not a thing you can do about it (yeah)
Got a soul, you can live without it (yeah)

YEAH RIGHT!

Don't deserve an apology (yeah)
It all comes down to the DNA (yeah)
So do your duty and thank the lord (yeah)
Cos now it's the truth when we say it's so
And now it's the truth cos we say it's so

YEAH RIGHT!

It's just another distraction
Keep on moving the crowd
But all the alienation
I hope it's getting you down, yeah

Falling down the crack hoping things will get better
Falling down the crack everybody get, down
Falling down the crack hoping things will get better
Falling down the crack everybody get, get down
Go!
Go!
Everybody get down
