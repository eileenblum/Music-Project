Lay back
I'm gonna save the world and blow myself to pieces
Lay back
I'm gonna find a way to shut it down, this heart

The doctors say I'm displaying a lack of empathy
I've worked so hard to get it to where I can not feel anything

I'm a void
I'm a void
I'm a void
I'm a void

Patience
It's gonna take a while to pull it back together
Patience
It's like a puzzle where I don't have all the parts

I'm getting used to being confused
And it is something to be sure
I'm gonna take myself to a place 
Where I can't hear you anymore

I'm a void
I'm a void
I'm a void
I'm a void

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Came through nothing
And went through nothing
I'm a void
I'm a void
Came through nothing
And went through nothing
I'm a void
I'm a void
Came through nothing
And went through nothing
I'm a void
I'm a void
Came through nothing
And went through nothing
I'm a void
I'm a void

I'm a void
I'm a void
I'm a void (patience)
I'm a void (patience)

La, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la
