Day and nightThrough every eyeAlways see a different storySome are dark And some are lightWhile others itch to build an army I've figured out how to relateI found the answer in an auto-emailSaid settle down or dominateIt said, settle down or dominate It's good to see you're so fired up bareBut we're not gonna stop'Til you all you end up Claiming "I win" 'Cause in the futureWe will all be beautifulIn the futureWe will be unstoppable Was thinking I could make it rightBut realised that that's a folly So disappeared into the nightTo be continued by a different storyThey're breeding/brooding(?) dead to deviate(?)Make it back you might ignore the detail So settle down we'll dominateSo settle down while we dominate It's good to see you're so fired up bareBut we're not gonna stopTil you all you end up Claiming "I win" 'Cause in the futureWe will all be beautifulIn the futureWe will be unstoppable Gotta get out the wayKeep movingBalancing all the blameGotta get out the wayKeep movingBalancing all the blame Sinner, mother, liarDead end, dead end, dead endGet up, line up, fireSay it, say it, say itSinner, mother, liarDead end, dead end, dead endGet up, line up, fireSay it, say it, say it I've figured out to relateI found the answer in an auto-emailSaid settle down or dominateIt said, settle down or dominate In the futureWe will all be beautifulIn the futureWe will be unstoppable 'Cause in the futureWe will all be beautifulIn the futureWe will be unstoppable Gotta get out the wayKeep movingBalancing all the blameGotta get out the wayKeep movingBalancing all the blame In the futureWe will all be beautifulIn the futureWe will be unstoppable
