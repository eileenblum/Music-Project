This is no mistakeTurn to look to the futureHope it's not too lateFinally get it to go Did you forget yourself?There's always one hand feeding the otherAnd if there's nothing elseWell then there's nothing elseYou can forget yourself Stand up I am the fire in the airI'm in the cracks in the earthI am the final yearOf this universeThis universe Don't let it go to wasteYou know that some things have no solutionsAnd if there's no mistakesYou should forgive yourselfThat belongs to no-one else Stand up I am the fire in the airI'm in the cracks in the earthI am the final yearOf this universeThis universeThis universeThis universe This is no mistakeTurn to look to the futureHope it's not too lateFinally get it to go I am the fire in the airI'm the cracks in the earthI am the silence you hearFrom the universeThis universeThis universeThis universe
