This was you and me, a memoryWhat better place to startSomewhere in between the final sceneWe've fallen so farAnd you can't go fixing everything without a heartYou can run and hide but you can't stay where you are So hold on, you will meet your soul tonight'Cause nothing else can help you set it rightWith no one to hold your feet up to the fireYou're left waiting for the moment to ignite Life's bigger now, brighter nowThe past is dead and doneYou would work it outBut don't know how to tell anyoneYeah you hope and pleadYour questions screaming at the darkJust waiting for the answerWaiting for the answer So hold on, you will meet your soul tonight'Cause nothing else can help you set it rightWith no one to hold your feet up to the fireYou're left waiting for the momentWaiting for the momentYou're left waiting for the moment to arrive Everyone's in love with youAnd everybody caresIf every word you say is true is anybody's guessEveryone's in love with youAnd everybody staresAnd after all they've done for you there's still nobody thereEveryone's in love with youAnd everybody caresIf every word you say is true is anybody's guessEveryone's in love with youAnd everybody staresAnd after all they've done for you there's still nobody there So hold on you will meet your soul tonight'Cause nothing else can help you set it rightWith no one to hold your feet up to the fireYou're left waiting for the moment to ignite So hold on you will meet your soul tonight'Cause nothing else can help you set it rightWith no one to hold your feet up to the fireYou're left waiting for the momentWaiting for the momentYou're left waiting for the moment to ignite
