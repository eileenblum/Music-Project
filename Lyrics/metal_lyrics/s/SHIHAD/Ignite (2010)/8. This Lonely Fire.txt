There's a streetlight faded for the dayThere's a bombsite to be swept away I will take the day offI will take the day Let the worry dissolveGonna celebrateI will take the day offI will take the dayI will take the day off Because I've done everything you told me toThere's no need to act surprisedAll my life I've done what I was meant to doNever thought about asking why And your own desire will let you know that it's trueThere's a lonely fire replacing the old with the new Replacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the new As the city fills with light and noiseWhile the whole world waits to be destroyed I will take the day offI will take the day Let the worry dissolveGonna celebrateI will take the day offI will take the dayI will take the day off Because I've done everything you told me toThere's no need to act surprisedAll my life I've done what I was meant to doNever thought about asking why And your own desire will let you know that it's trueThere's a lonely fire replacing the old with the new Replacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the new I can't remember my own nameIt's been forever, now I'm back again And I cannot believe all the things we denyWaiting for others to make it rightEven when it was clear the dream wasn't trueWouldn't admit to the one thing left to do Replacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the new There's a streetlight faded for the dayThere's a bombsite to be swept away Because I've done everything you told me toThere's no need to act surprisedAll my life I've done what I was meant to doNever thought about asking why And your own desire will let you know that it's trueThere's a lonely fire replacing the old with the new Replacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the newReplacing the old with the new
