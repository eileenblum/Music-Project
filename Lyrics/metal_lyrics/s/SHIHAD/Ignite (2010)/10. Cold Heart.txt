And it's not about the way you're living
The future's ours and the past -- just let it go
If you're not happy with the clues that you're given
If you're not happy you should say so

Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight

And I don't have to care
Suddenly it's where you are
What happens over there
It's only for this cold heart

Getting high was a mistake
I know it hurt to make you feel something
But now you're gone, oh for Pete's sake
I wish I had the time you waste

Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight

And I don't have to care
Suddenly it's where you are
What happens over there
It's only from this heart
I thought it would've shown
Suddenly it's where you are
But you already know
It's only for this cold heart

It's a constant
Of whatever
Gotta wake up and pull it together
Have your mother kiss it better
It hurts 'cos it don't even matter
Yeah

Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight

And I don't have to care
Suddenly it's where you are
What happens over there
It's only from this heart
I thought it would've shown
Suddenly it's where you are
But you already know
It's only for this cold heart
