You could give 'em what you got
Or not at all

When you're hollow 
You won't even know
The view from here
Goes on and on, and on, and on

Everything was edit out(?)
I guess you won't engage
But your missed scene(?) is broken down
Sure that it was working yesterday
It was working yesterday

Your memory's become a cage
Ain't gonna ever be the same
Playtime is over now
Playtime is over now

So tell us
What you really know
'Cause you're perfect for the job
Or near enough
All around you people come and go
And these days keep dragging on and on and on

Everything was edit out(?)
I guess you won't engage
But your missed scene(?) is broken down
Sure that it was working yesterday
It was working yesterday

Your memory's become a cage
Ain't gonna ever be the same
It falls apart the more you think about it
Now you're left to re-engage
Playtime is over now
Playtime is over now

Got a secret
But you know that you won't keep it
Try and tell it but you know they won't believe
You'd give anything to make them understand how you're alone
Alone, alone, alone, yeah

Your memory's become a cage
Ain't gonna ever be the same
It falls apart the more you think about it
Now you're left to re-engage
Playtime is over now (playtime is over now)
Playtime is over now (playtime is over now)
Playtime is over now (playtime is over now)
Playtime is over now (playtime is, it's over now)
