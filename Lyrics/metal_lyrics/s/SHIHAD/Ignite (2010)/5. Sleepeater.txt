Balanced on the edge of a knifeSleepeater slowly turningBreak it down, set it alightHe's here to start it burning Waiting for you in the bedroomKnows when you're alone at nightWant to stay awake foreverHoping you can keep it tightEverything you ever valuedKnow that you will have to fightWanna stay awake forever And I will take you away from this emergencyAt the end of the day you're your own worst enemy Brothers take your sisters and hideWe see the storm clouds comingThe differences between you and IHave alreadyPrepared and started running Waiting for you in the bedroomKnows when you're alone at nightWant to stay awake forever  Hoping you can keep it tightEverything you ever valuedKnow that you will have to fightWanna stay awake forever And I will take you away from this emergencyAt the end of the day you're your own worst enemyAnd it can take you to heaven, put you through hellJust as long as you don't look downWe can do it together, into my armsKnow that nothing can hurt you now SleepSleepeaterSleep It can take you to heaven, put you through hellJust as long as you don't look downWe can do it together, into my armsKnow that nothing can hurt you now And I will take you away from this emergencyAt the end of the day you're your own worst enemyAnd it can take you to heaven, put you through hellJust as long as you don't look downWe can do it together, into my armsKnow that nothing can hurt you now
