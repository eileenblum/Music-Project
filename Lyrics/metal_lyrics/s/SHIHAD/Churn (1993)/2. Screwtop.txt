Should we debate significance
or would it leave us too small

'cause it could take some time to linger
-pushing us to a fall

pausing to initiate
around and around
in trance we heard a dirty word
in dance we scream the sound

let the selfish become selfless
ok, it's a start

worlds in worlds
not you at its heart

please could you just slow down
please just slow it down

i'm going to fast
i'm not built to last
around and around

screwtop

screwtop

it's the end of an age my friend
the end of an age

the struggle of millions pull - push back

twist and tiptoe
don't fall through a crack

once you heard the lie of life
there's no coming back

should we debate significance
or would it leave us too small

'cause it could take some time to linger
-pushing us to a fall

pausing to initiate
around and around
in trance we heard a dirty word
in dance we scream the sound

screwtop

screwtop

twist, twist, twist
from the head to the hand
from a palm to a fist
crawl, crawl without all
so we twist

gonna take it all apart
gonna take this piece away from me
your level-headed theories
your hot headed cries
head to toe
right me wrong
but just don't say no
wind me up
i'll be ready to go
but then who's face
yours of mine
gonna rip this fucker out
i'm gonna tear this piece away from me
i'm gonna bring it down to its knees

screwtop

screwtop
