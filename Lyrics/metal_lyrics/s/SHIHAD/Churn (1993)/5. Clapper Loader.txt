Borrowed reason
That taste stirs nothing in me
And the only way to get by
Is being built into this wall
Yeah, it's a copout
Standing still to please your doubt
And for years in a snare
We're so sorry, we left out your reason to crawl

So sit down, vacuum child
Get sucked in, desensitize, stand up
Direct feed in through your eyes
But now you're looking the wrong way
Why play, not wanting anymore
The first bite's the best
So you leave the rest
Lying face down like a razor
Lying

Good evening clapper loader
You should override the writer
Making stories fold
Because truths are told
In better ways than these
Believe me I could show you if I had something to show
But your history's been bound and gagged
And the pattern that's ingrained tells you to
Crawl into yourself
Safe inside your cage
Crawl into yourself
Safe inside your cage
Crawl into yourself
Safe inside your cage
