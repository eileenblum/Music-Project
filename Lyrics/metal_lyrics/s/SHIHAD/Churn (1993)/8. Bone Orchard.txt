Get the sinking feeling
You're behind my head again
And the more I weed, the more it grows
And here I am, hung by my toes
The time spent set in cement
Spent wasting my time
When I could have been pulling it down

It's my release
It's my release
It's my release

Held down, entangled
It's a web of my own making
This desolation shaking me apart
Build it up, paste it up, stick it up
Stuck up, fucked, such a shame
My defences have become my own restrictions

It's my release
It's my release
It's my release

My love
Talk to me
It's a bone orchard
You cast a shadow
An my heart
It's a bone orchard

My love
Talk to me
It's a bone orchard
You cast a shadow
An my heart
It's a bone orchard
