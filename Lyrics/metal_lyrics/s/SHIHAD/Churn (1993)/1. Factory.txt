(If you want a vision of the future
Imagine a boot standing on a human face)

Speed is our god
Speed
"The new canon of beauty"
Caught in static ecstasy
We climb

Keep moving onward
Keep moving forward
Keep moving onward
Down
Ideas left in torment
Ideas left to drown

Stuck
Stuck
Stuck
Stuck
Stuck in the factory
Stuck

Stuck
Stuck
Stuck in the factory
Stuck

Growth is our motto
Why?
Well the answer's in productivity
Gotta give up what's mine
Got to fall into line

Confused, pathetic and manic
Splintered &amp; entirety
Spear-like shard
Breaking hard
We should be breaking you

Stuck
Stuck
Stuck
Stuck
Stuck in the factory
Stuck

Stuck
Stuck
Stuck in the factory
Stuck

Keep moving onward
Keep moving forward
Keep moving onward
Keep moving down

Keep moving onward
Keep moving forward
Keep moving onward
Keep moving down

Keep moving onward
Keep moving forward
Keep moving onward
Keep moving down

Keep moving onward
Keep moving forward
Keep moving onward
Keep moving down
