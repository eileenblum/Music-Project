These stations are empty
So distant I just cant seem to touch them
Most of the time
You can find safety in the smooth clear surface
As cool as a breeze
As helpless as this vacant civilisation
And the air we breathe
In long, slow breaths
It got us picking up our power
We're free
Feeling free

Well I run out of eyes
And I run out of hands
And I'm moving through spaces I don't understand
But the last thing you feel before the end of your fall
Is the start of your new life

Show us how to feel
Got a fear of flying
Been failing for years
And now I'm sick of trying
Salvation's got a gun
No answers there for me
No sins left to pay
Let's blow this guilt away

Blow it away

As cool as a breeze
As helpless as this vacant civilisation
And the air we breathe
In long, slow breaths
It got us picking up
Picking up our power
We're free, yeah
Feeling free
