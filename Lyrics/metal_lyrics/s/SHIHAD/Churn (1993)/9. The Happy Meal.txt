What's yours dad?
Beef.
Yeah, but what's it called?
To join us and help work on god's plan to make the world a better place
For our families and future generations

Why aren't we be what they be?
Where's our sitcom family?
Where's the perfect boy or girl?
Where's our happy meal?
Where is our identity?
Your foot is in the door
What the hell, we don't care
We're safe in our four walls

What's happened to our spirit?
It's withered, sick and grey
Been scared into blind worship
I can't see any other way
But the problems, they keep arising
We're hurt, we're unfulfilled
"The peasants are getting restless"
We're sick of pushing shit uphill
When the substance of this system wears too thin
Let's kick it in
