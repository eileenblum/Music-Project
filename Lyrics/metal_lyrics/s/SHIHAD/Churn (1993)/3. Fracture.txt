All along the way
You been scratching your name deep in us
Now we're nothing save
Let's just say, distracted
When questioned it's delay or defuse
Beaten down again
It's nothing new
I'd bring you with me
If you were human too
But I'm face to face with this silicon wall

Hold truth like steel
Don't want to lose what I feel
When every breath seems real

Pump me full of happy medium
We want something more
We the brighter, faster, harder generation
Are coming knocking at your door
Hacking down your door

Hold truth like steel
Don't want to lose what I feel
When every breath seems real

I know we can make it
I know that if we try
They'll fall
I just can't take it anymore
Another, another with nothing apart

Come back along the way
Been erasing your name out of me
Now I'm not safe
Let's just say I'm free

Hold truth like steel
Don't want to lose what I feel
When every breath seems real

Mold our thoughts like clay
Then send us off on our way
And it's the price we pay for our fear
