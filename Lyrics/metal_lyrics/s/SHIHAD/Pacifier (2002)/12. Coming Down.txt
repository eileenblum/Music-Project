give me a place to shed my skin
there's no point waiting around to begin
cos the more it takes the more you feel
ain't got much but i know it's real
ain't got time to waste your life away

all the people around you, walls that surround you
are coming down
and the things that you feel, hearts that you steal
they'll be coming down for love
all the people around you, walls that surround you
are coming down
and the things that you hide, won't be denied
they'll be coming down, coming down for love

open up and let 'em in
love ain't something that you can win
cos the more it takes, the more you feel
ain't got much but we know it's real
ain't got time to waste your life away

all the people around you, walls that surround you
are coming down
and the things that you feel, hearts that you steal
they'll be coming down for love
all the people around you, walls that surround you
are coming down
and the things that you hide, won't be denied
they'll be coming down, coming down for love

now for every boy and every girl
with all the pain and joy in the world
we don't mean nothing without love

all the people around you, walls that surround you
are coming down
and the things that you feel, hearts that you steal
they'll be coming for love
all the people around you, walls that surround you
are coming down
and the things that you hide, won't be denied
they'll be coming down, coming down for love
coming down
