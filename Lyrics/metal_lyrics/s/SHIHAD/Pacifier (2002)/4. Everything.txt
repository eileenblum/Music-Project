you got a perfect girl
and it's a perfect world
you build a fortress around you
can see no reason not to continue

the things that you always dreamed about
you know that in time they'll be running out
stop turning around and round and round
everything you wanted will be falling down like castles in the sand
everything you needed in the world,
you're holding, holding in your hands

and if this comfortable life is your only passage through time
just make sure you can break through
the walls that you are building around you

the things you always dreamed about
you know that in time they'll be running out
stop turning around and round and round
everything you wanted will be coming down like castles in the sand
everything you needed in the world you're holding,
holding in your hands

wanna be part of the world
you gotta hand something over
wanna be part of the world

the things you always dreamed about
you know that in time they'll be running out
the things you always dreamed about
so turn it around and round and round
everything you wanted will be falling down like castles in the sand
everything you needed in the world you're holding,
holding in your hands

don't you want to hold it, hold it now
everything that you need
you're holding in your hands
