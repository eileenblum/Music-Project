(we say your an actor)
been searching for a reason
to make us change
(we say your an actor)
cos you've got the whole world listening
but you've got nothing to say

and as we gathered in the ashes
i said fire 'em up boys and let 'em go
they're making music for the masses
sliced up real thin for the radio

(we say your an actor)
all that you took for granted
has been replaced
(replaced by an actor)
now that your left with nothing
but more of the same

and as we gathered in the ashes
i said fire 'em up boys and let 'em go
they're making music for the masses
sliced up real thin for the radio

who do you think you are
who do you think you are
who do you think you are
we'll be climbing your way
we'll be climbing all the way
so who do you think you are
(who do you think you are)
who do you think you are
(who do you think you are)
who do you think you are
(who do you think you are)

and as we gathered in the ashes
i said fire 'em up boys and let 'em go
they're making music for the masses
sliced up real thin for the radio

you all sound the same
(we say your an actor)
with nothing to say
