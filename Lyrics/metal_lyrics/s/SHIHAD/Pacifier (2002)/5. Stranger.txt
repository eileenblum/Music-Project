the night goes on and on; it seems like it's forever
wish we were home instead of how it's turning out
there's something you cannot explain
the one thing that gets in the way

don't say the things you said
can't you see that way
i made a mistake
you've become a stranger to me now
you kept it all inside
instead of letting it come out

loved saying i'll be there
and knowing that you mean it
we could go anywhere and never be apart
there's something you cannot escape
there's one thing you can never fake

don't say the things you said
can't you see that way
i made a mistake
you've become a stranger to me now
you kept it all inside
instead of letting it come out

through all the lonely days
and all the times that i spent waiting
to finally be with you again
just to discover that you changed
and things will never be the same

you've become a stranger to me now
you kept it all inside
instead of letting it come out

yeah, it's gone too far this time
yeah, you let it slip away
yeah, we've gone too far this time
things will never be the same
