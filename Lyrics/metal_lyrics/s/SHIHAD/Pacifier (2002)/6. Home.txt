we can't always be together
you gotta pick it up, you gotta pick it up again
things can't always hang together
cos nobody knows, so let's give it a go

home
you'll be running all the way
back home
but nothing's gonna save
your soul
you'll be running all the way
back home
home

we can't always make things better
when it comes around
you gotta nail it down
this ain't gonna be forever
cos nobody knows
so let's give it a go

home
you'll be running all the way
back home
but nothing's gonna save
your soul
you'll be running all the way
back home
home

if there was some way to manage this space
between us
(some way to manage this space between us)
(i find it hard to reach) home
you'll be running all the way
back home
but nothing's gonna save
your soul
till you've finally found your peace
on your own
you'll be running all the way
because life is short
and getting shorter
and we don't do things that we oughta
life is short and
getting shorter
you in.....
and so......
