well i bought myself today
it's like they know what i'm thinking away
we'll make a meal of all the words they steal
and pin 'em up against a wall

and thanks for your concern
but i'll do my own facts and figures
finish off the deal by keeping our shit real
when your appointment was for all

you don't need a trademark to go your own way
(leave me alone i'm not for sale)
you don't need a trademark to blow 'em all way
(stand on your own or go to to hell)
you don't need a trademark to go your own way
(leave me alone i'm not for sale)
you don't need a trademark no matter who says
(stand on your own or go to hell)

so keep your shit away from me
cos i know where you've been
so keep your shit away from me
cos i know where you've been

and i would
with no effort
say that i'm free
to be me

you don't need a trademark
(leave me alone i'm not for sale)
you don't need a trademark
(stand on your own or go to to hell)
you don't need a trademark
(leave me alone i'm not for sale)
you don't need a trademark
(stand on your own or go to hell)
