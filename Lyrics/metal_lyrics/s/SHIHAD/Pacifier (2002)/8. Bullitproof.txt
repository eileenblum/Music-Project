i never thought we'd come this far
sit still, and wonder who you are
today, think
how much longer can we be apart
the same story, i know it off-by-heart
ok, it's just another day

caught, in a world that's bulletproof
i can't taste the truth
but it won't drag me down
and i'm caught in a world that's bulletproof
set me up to lose
but i won't let you down

who's gonna tell you what you're worth
roll over and expect to work your life away
why can't you realise today that you're...

caught, in a world that's bulletproof
i can't taste the truth
but it won't drag me down
and i'm caught in a world that's bulletproof
set me up to lose
but i won't let you down

there's an emptiness inside when we're apart
and when i'm far away from where you are
there's too much time for trouble in my heart
in my heart...

caught, in a world that's bulletproof
caught, in a world that's bulletproof

caught, in a world that's bulletproof
i can't taste the truth
but it won't drag me down
and i'm caught in a world that's bulletproof
set me up to lose
but i won't let you down

i won't let you down
caught in a world that's bulletproof
i won't let you down
caught in a world that's bulletproof
i won't let you down
caught in a world that's bulletproof
