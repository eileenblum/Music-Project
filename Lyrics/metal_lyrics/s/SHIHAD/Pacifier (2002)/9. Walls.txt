on your own today
lost with no direction
they took your dreams away
and stripped you of protection
but there's a light that won't burn out
when your heart is screaming out
is screaming

it doesn't matter where you are
there is life behind the walls around you
it doesn't matter where you start
won't be long, won't be long until
the walls around you are gone

on my own again
with open invitations and the world i'm in
is such a new sensation
but there's a light that won't burn out
if your heart begins to doubt

it doesn't matter where you are
there is life behind that walls around you
it doesn't matter where you start
it won't be long, won't be long until
the walls around you are gone

maybe a path to glory
it maybe a road to dust
it maybe there's one great story in all of us
in all of us, yeah

on your own today
lost with no direction
they took your dreams away
and stripped you of protection
but there's a light that won't burn out
when your heart is screaming out
is screaming

it doesn't matter where you are
there is life behind the walls around you
it doesn't matter where you start
it won't be long, won't be long until
the walls around you are gone

(cos when the walls are closing in)
(another day begins)
(as the last flame flickers out)
cos there's something good in us
(cos when the walls are closing in)
(another day begins)
(as the last flame flickers out)
cos there's something good in us
(cos when the walls are closing in)
(another day begins)
there must be something beautiful in us
cos there's something good in us
(cos when the walls are closing in)
(another day begins)
there must be something beautiful in us
