living it up inside a cloud of isolation
with all the people tryin' to be somebody else
(cut apart) an extra generation
(cut apart) forget yourself

stand up, stand up, stand up
fuck yeah
light up, light up, light up
fuck yeah
sitting in line, but you're all in your mind
you're too cool to touch

there's something inside you
where nobody goes and
there's something about you
that i used to know
and if the sun is still shining
you'd never tell, you're just a shadow

tied up in knots, lying tangled from the ceiling
with all the people wishing i was somewhere else
(looking good)
don't know what i'm feeling
(looking good) it's time to sell

when they get up, get up
(fuck yeah)
when they light up, light up
(fuck yeah)

setting the time trying to get you alive
i can't seem to touch

there's something inside you
where nobody goes and
there's something about you
that i used to know
and if your sun is still shining
you better tell, you're just a shadow
of somebody else, you're just a shadow

(let it go)
get up, get up, get up
(let it go)
stand up, stand up, stand up

there's something inside you
where nobody goes and
there's something about you
that i used to know
and if your sun is still shining
you better tell, you're just a shadow
of somebody else, just a shadow
