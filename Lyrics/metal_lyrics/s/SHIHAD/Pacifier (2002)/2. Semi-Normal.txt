got the right to ask a question
got the right to understand
got the right to choose your company
and speak from where you stand
all your pain is born inside out
right on time, wrong way round
we have come to tell what you are

i'm not fucking all right
i'm semi-normal
all bark and no bite
i'm semi-normal

got the right to build your freeway
got the right to force your plans
got the right to choose your destiny
and milk it while you can
all you mothers living in the clouds
look at you - you're upside down
we have come to step on your world

i'm not fucking all right
i'm semi-normal
all bark and no bite
i'm semi-normal

and the seed that has been sown
a dream you can't control
in the west where we know best
we're alone without them (yeah)

i'm not fucking all right
i'm semi-normal
all bark and no bite
i'm semi-normal
