You still act the same
Would have thought you got bored with your stupid games
Would have thought you got some sense into your brain
You think you still want out
C'mon and try it again

You must hate yourself
Getting down on other people for some spiritual wealth
Oh, I'd really love to burst your bubble
Why don't you test your luck on me
And nothing greets me more than a bullet
You never even got to know me but you put me through hell
Oh well

C'mon, c'mon
Do it, do it again
C'mon, c'mon
And got you ticking
C'mon, c'mon
Do it, do it again

So absurd
Yeah
You are

C'mon,c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon,c'mon
Do it, Do it again
C'mon,c'mon
Do it, Do it again
C'mon, c'mon
Do it, Do it again
C'mon,c'mon
Do it, Do it again
C'mon, c'mon
Do it, Do it again
C'mon,c'mon
Do it, Do it again
C'mon, c'mon
Do it, Do it again
