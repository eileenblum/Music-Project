The night speeds through at its breakneck pace
Gotta run to keep up, gotta keep on the case
And the people that you meet, well they're speeding too
I get up, I get in a cab
The driver says he loves his wife, she's in the slammer
He's got some advice 'cause I'm new here

We're in the land, we're in the land
The land of everything and nothing at all
Wait till it takes you by the hand
It's got it all, but it's got no soul
We're in the land, la la la land
The land of everything and nothing at all
I'm sorry, I do not understand

Finally get to the place where I'm supposed to be
I met a girl and a girl met me
And she's let me in on just how to see the light here
She says her life was in disarray
Till she found these pills that took the pain away
Wait a minute, something's not quite right
