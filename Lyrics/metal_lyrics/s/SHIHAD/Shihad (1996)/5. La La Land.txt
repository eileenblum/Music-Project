the night speeds though at its breakneck pace
gotta run to keep up, gotta keep on the case
and the people that you meet
well they're speeding too
i get up, i get in a cab
the driver says he loves his wife, she's in the slammer
he's got some advice 'cause i'm new here

we're in the land, We're in the land
the land of everything and nothing at all
Wait till it takes you by the hand
its got it all, but it's got no soul!
we're in the land, la la la land
the land of everything and nothing at all
i'm sorry, i do not understand
finally get to the place where i'm supposed to be
i met a girl and a girl met me
and she's lets me in on
just how to see the light here
she says her life was in disarray,
till she found these pills that took the pain away
wait a minute, something's not quite right
