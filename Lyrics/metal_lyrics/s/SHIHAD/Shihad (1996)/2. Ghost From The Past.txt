Met up with the ghost from the past
Who said...
I can't slow down, my minds moving too fast
And I don't like the things I'm thinking
I said brother, try to relax
It takes time for things to pass
He said fine and then he threw me out the door

Should of stayed
He was on the floor
So much pain
Could I have done more?
Saw a ghost from the past just the other day
His body still works but his soul flew away
Or sits somewhere inside behind locked doors
I said brother you should relax
You were better in times that past
He just smiled and looked straight through me

Ain't no way to get you back now...
