I look at you
You're a mystery
Sometimes you're just hell
All the same
It's no news to me
And we all fall down so typically
Intact

Attack
Me, like it's all that matters
Attack
And enclose me in your arms
What's that you said?
Oh, I'm history
Yeah, well I'm taking that as well
All the same
Only bruises me
And I get up with everything
Still intact
Our love
It's a battle
And it's worth fighting for
