All of us, connected
All of us on the same road home
And if one should fall or falter
Then we all reach down together as one
And we lift them up again

Only our world
Could we find some meaning
So we created our own
Still here today
I had a dream, I was lost at sea
All of you
Afloat on the same boat home
Please throw me a line
I think I'm drowning
So you all lent over
to pick me up
and we spent the rest of the night swimming

Nobody's falling apart
Don't need to know what your thinking
Kissed the world goodbye
And then we ran away
