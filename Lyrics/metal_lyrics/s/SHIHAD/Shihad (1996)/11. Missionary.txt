If you come knocking on my door
I'll make sure that i'm not there
It's no fun being alone but don't you phone
I'm running...

'Cause i know and i'll always remember
what you said

Got woken by a missionary
Who'd come to deliver a message of peace
I told her peace was what I had
Until I was woken by a missionary

But if you go
I promise i will remember what you said
