Worked so hard to get your credentials
So young, so hip, so experimental
But you'll play the game in the end
So young, so hip, so perfectly able
You got a major talent
For making foolish things seem perfectly balanced
You've got the right idea
The worlds full of suckers
So won't you come along...

Your head is a rock
and it's doing in mine
If there's somebody in there
Just leave me a sign?
No, no, your head is a rock
So young, so hip, so experimental
Worked so hard to get influential
But you'll play the game in the end
you just the same
and the time keeps on ticking'
you've developed a habit
for making foolish things
seem perfectly balanced
and you don't even know yourself
you the fool!

Behind that perfect smile
the hunger won't subside
The jaw stays open wide
Don't play me,
your not so young, so hip

We shall not cop out
