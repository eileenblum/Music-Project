You better run
as fast as you can
'cause this passenger's not a happy man
start running just as fast as you can

You say, you need a friend
hey, well so do I
but this passenger's just passing by
passenger is just passing by.

At your age and stage
you should understand
but you don't care, you got a master plan
fuck, fuck, fuck 'em all and take what you can

A freezing cold stare
and a flick in the eye
passengers just passing by
passengers just passing by
passengers just passing by

To walk on water you'd sink in the ice
To walk on water you'd sink in the ice
To walk on water you'd sink in the ice
To walk on water you'd sink in the ice

You're holding everything inside, you're holding everything inside
everything inside
Don't it feel good just to be alive still holding everything inside

You don't know what you want
so you take what you can
still don't make you a happy man
start running just as fast as you can

A freezing cold stare
and a flick in the eye
passengers just passing by
passengers just passing by

To walk on water you'd sink in the ice
To walk on water you'd sink in the ice
for all things gained there's a sacrifice
to walk on water you gotta sink in the ice

You're holding everything inside, you're holding everything inside
everything inside
and don't it feel good just to be alive,
don't it feel good just to be alive
you're still holding everything inside

And you don't know what you want, do ya?
know what you want?
do ya
know what you want
what you want?

You're holding everything inside, you're holding everything inside
everything inside
(You're still holding)
don't it feel good just to be alive
don't it feel good just to be alive
don't it feel good
you're still holding
Everything inside
Everything inside
