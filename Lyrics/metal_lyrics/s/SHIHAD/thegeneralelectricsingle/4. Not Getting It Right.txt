You're not getting it right
'til we're getting it right
You can't shout your free
Then follow the line
You're not getting it right
'til you keep getting falter
No we don't got the time

I need a reaction

Watching words run down your face gets pretty boring
I change in time and I'm up for it

I got one tenth of the time for your precious mind
and waiting round for you to react

You're not getting it right
'til we're getting it right
You're not getting it right
'til we're getting it
You're not getting it right
'til we're getting it
You're not getting it right

Well I got one tenth of the time for your precious mind
Still singing songs we used to find

I need a reaction
