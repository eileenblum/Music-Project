You
You didn't care about the ones you left behind
And now comes the time
I'll make you sick
I'll make the world a better place for ya now
For ya now

I'll make you sorry
I did it my way

Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
No doubt
When I get my chance

You
I don't care that I'm the one that you despise
Just close your eyes
I'll make you sick
I'll make the world a better place for ya now
For ya now

I'll make you sorry
I did it my way

Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
No doubt
When I get my chance

When I get my chance
I'll be invincible
Accelerate to where we need you all
And make it look easy

Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
No Doubt
When I get my chance

Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
It's not easy to do
Bring it back to you
No Doubt
Bring it back to you
Bring it back to you
No Doubt
When I get my chance
