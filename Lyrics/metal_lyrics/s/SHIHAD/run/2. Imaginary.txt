You're the light in the soul
A lifeline through it all
You connect me when I'm gone
Out on my own
I'm never alone
When I'm out of control

Cos' you will always remind me that,
That all of this is just imaginary and,
And you will always be there
When I need someone to show me
That I'll never be alone

Read the lines you said
Now you're on your knees again
But you're never alone
When you're out on your own
And out of control

Cos' you will always remind me that,
That all of this is just imaginary and,
And you will always be there
When I need someone to show me
That I'll never be alone

And I'm on my way, please believe it
Just another day where you are
Cos' you know that it's written in the stars

Cos' you will always remind me that,
That all of this is just imaginary and,
And you will always be there
When I need someone to show me
That I'll never be alone

And you will always remind me that (I'll never be alone)
And you will always remind me that (I'll never be alone)
And you will always remind me that (I'll never be alone)
And you will always remind me that
