I didn't know you were one of us
I didn't know that something meant so much
When you get home you're invisible
It's functional and minimal
There's nothing outside these four walls

You're just as shallow as the next man
You're just as shallow as the next man
We're safe in our little universe
So safe in our own little universe
We're safe in our little universe now

I thought the 80s had come and gone
But everything that I want out of life has got a price tag on
And it's anything but typical
Falling down on the wrong side of cynical
Where nothing's sacred anymore
That's for sure

You're just as shallow as the next man
You're just as shallow as the next man
We're safe in our little universe
So safe in our own little universe
We're safe in our little universe now

We're safe in our little universe
So safe in our own little universe
We're safe in our little universe now
In our universe now
In our universe now
In our universe now
In our universe

We're safe in our little universe
So safe in our own little universe
We're safe in our little universe now
In our universe now
We're safe in our little universe
So safe in our own little universe
We're safe in our little universe now

So safe, so safe in (in our universe now)
So safe, so safe in (in our universe now)
So safe, so safe in (in our universe now)
In our universe now
In our universe now
In our universe now
In our universe now
