On the rising tide
Roller coaster ride
As the truth descends
You chose not to ride again

So you run
Whatcha holding on, holding on to
Run
Life is going on
All around you
Run
Whatcha holding on, holding on to

You still love to dance
Love to take a chance
But something turned inside
And the dreams: they got left behind

So you run
Whatcha holding on, holding on to
Run
Life is going on
All around you
Run
Whatcha holding on, holding on to
Run
Look what's going on, all around you

Don't want to have to make a change
Wouldn't want to exaggerate the pain
Go running and back to the old ways

So you run
Whatcha holding on, holding on to
Run
Life is going on
All around you
Run
Life is going on
All around you
Run
