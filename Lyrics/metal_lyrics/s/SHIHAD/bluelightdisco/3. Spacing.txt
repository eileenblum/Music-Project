Well I'm sad but I'm not empty
'Cause today it's on the cards that I'm on the move
It's alright 'cause when I'm leaving
My mind draws me a picture to keep of you

Because I can, get a little lonely once in a while
Because I can, I've become a victim of your smile
But you know I can make it back from all those miles

I'm sore from the crash landing
But at least I made it back from my trip to the moon
And it's alright 'cause when I'm spacing
The thrill of anticipation gets me through
I've gotta get to you

Because I can, get a little lonely once in a while
Because I can, I've become a victim of your smile

Though it hurts sometimes remember
That the beauty lies in everything you do
And it's alright, I know you don't believe in love
But I believe in you
Oh yes I do
Yes I do

It's alright 'cause when I'm spacing
My mind draws in, and reaches out to you

Though it hurts sometimes remember
That the beauty lies in everything you do
And it's alright, I know you don't believe in love
But I believe in you
Oh yes I do
Yes I do
Oh yes I do
Yes I do
Yes I do
