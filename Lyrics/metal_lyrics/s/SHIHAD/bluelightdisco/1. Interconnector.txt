Tell me its the same
You canât win if you don't play the game
But your fake rebellion
Is just so fuckin' annoying
My big heroâs a garbage collector
A big hair, an interconnector
He not waiting for the next big thing
He got the class bullshit protector

Yeah, we got something to prove
Yeah, we got something thatâs true now
I hope youâre getting it too
Got nothing better to do

Then again, keeping kiddies safe
The false image of men
I just gotta tell ya
Shit from an interconnector
Iâm getting into the mini
D-d-d-driving away
Because me and my TV
Ran out of something to say
Whatâs to say?

Yeah, we got something to prove
Yeah, we got something thatâs true now
I hope youâre getting it too
Got nothing better to do

Yeah, we got something to prove
Yeah, we got something thatâs true now
I hope youâre getting it too
Got nothing better to do

Yeah, we got something to prove
Yeah, we got something thatâs true now
I hope youâre getting it too
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
Got nothing better to do
