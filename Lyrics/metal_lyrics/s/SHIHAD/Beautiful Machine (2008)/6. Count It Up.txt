Liars and murderers
Spit another out, so we can
Count it up
Count it up
Count it up
Not what you said you were
Another good man down, and we can
Count it up
Count it up
Count it up
You're gonna pay for your charade
Can't wait until you go away
Burnt flags and bloody rags
Buried underground where we can
Count it up
Count it up
Count it up
Nametags and body bags
They don't make a sound, but we can
Count it up
Count it up
Count it up
You're gonna pay for your charade
Can't wait until you go away
I hope it rains on your parade
Not gonna go through that again
You're gonna pay for your charade
Can't wait until you go away
I hope it rains on your parade
Not gonna go through that again
They're gonna pay you back in spades!
