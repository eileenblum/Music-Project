It's just us against the world
If only I believed
Though we're far from comfortable
Never wanted to be

Give you everything you want
It's not what you need
And I know it's not your fault
But you're so hard to please

So hard to please

After all we've said and done
There's still so much to see
Remember when we were young
Now we're bored and hungry

Sit back and face the world
What the morning gives me
You will always be the one
But you're so hard to please

So hard to please

I don't want to sink into denial
(We try to see right through it)
Carry us along til we decide
(Don't talk just get right to it)
Hiding all you feel behind a smile
(We try to see right through it)
Tell me what you think will make it right

What will make it right?

It's just us against the world
It's just us against the world
But you're so hard to please

So hard to please
So hard to please
So hard to please
