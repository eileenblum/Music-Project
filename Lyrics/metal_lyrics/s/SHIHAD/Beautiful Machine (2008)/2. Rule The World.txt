You rise in the morning, a machine
But something is missing, you will see

Hello, hello is anyone home?
We're in this together all alone

Get up, get up, you're getting it wrong
You won't tell the difference til it's gone

And you got nowhere to go
You just follow where it flows

Don't it break you up?
Can't feel your empty heart
Everything you are
You tear your world apart

You look through the window, just to see
They cut dow the forest for a tree

Hello, hello, is anyone home?
We're in this together all alone

Get up, get up, you're getting it wrong
You won't tell the difference til it's gone

And you got nowhere to go
You just follow where it flows

Don't it break you up?
Can't feel your empty heart
Everything you are

Don't it break you up?
You'll never have enough
Everything you are
You tear your world apart

I know you want to rule the world
But as it goes you can't buy love
Why's it such a mystery?
If I can't see you, you can't see me

And you got nowhere to go
You just follow where it flows

Don't it break you up?
Can't feel your empty heart
Everything you are

Don't it break you up?
You'll never have enough
Everything you are
You tear your world apart

You tear your world apart

You tear your world apart
