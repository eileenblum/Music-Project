You been living your life
Getting what you're after
Knowing you're not alone

If you cover you eyes
The world moves faster
We won't be here for long

And the lucky ones that make no sound
Until the cash machine's start breaking down
While the lunatics are waiting round for god

Head in the sky
The stars that you run round
Brightest before they fall

Bringing all our cities alight
For the final meltdown
It's only natural

And the lucky ones that make no sound
Until the cash machine's start breaking down
While the lunatics are waiting round for god

It's funny how we grow
No more, no less we know

It's funny how we grow
No more, no less we know

It's funny how we grow
No more, no less we know

It's funny how we grow
No more, no less we know
