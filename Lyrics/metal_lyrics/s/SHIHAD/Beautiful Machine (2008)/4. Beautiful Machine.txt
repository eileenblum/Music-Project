Something missing in our brains, yeah yeah
We all used to live in caves, yeah yeah
Build the world that's in our heads, yeah
And it's not over yet

(What's holding you back?)

We roll through space all looking up
(What's holding you back?)
To  fall like waves on sand
Beautiful Machine
Show me what you see

We're a million miles away, yeah yeah
From where we should all be today
There's a lot that we regret
That we should never forget

(What's holding you back?)

We roll through space all looking up
(What's hold you back?)
To fall like waves on sand
Beautiful Machine
Show me what you see

What were you thinking of?

Slowly drifting out in space
We all used to live in caves
We build the world that's in our heads
And it's not over yet.

(What's holding you back?)

We roll through space all looking up
(What's hold you back?)
To fall like waves on sand
Beautiful Machine
Show me what you see...

Beautiful Machine
Beautiful Machine

What's holding you back?
