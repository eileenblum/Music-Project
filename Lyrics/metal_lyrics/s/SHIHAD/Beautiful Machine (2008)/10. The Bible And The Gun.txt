Pray to your lonely gods
There's so many left to choose from
They all can't be wrong

Should take
You should take a breath
Because in the end your just the same as all the rest

And you're caught between the bible and the gun
When everybody claims their god's the one
One, The one, The one
One, The one

Break what is in your way
Nothing stands between us
Or nothing will remain

And you're caught between the bible and the gun
When everybody claims their god's the one
One, The one, The one [x2]
One, The one

What you feel is only real if it's written in your heart
The word's designed to keep us apart

When everybody claims their god's the one
One, The one, The one [x2]
One, The one

The One,
One, The one, The one [x3]
