Of all the empires left to sing about
You're on your way now, there can be no doubt
With the vampires, and the nobodies

You wander round
Don't know who you are
Undergroun

We'll leave em something they can talk about when it's over,
Time, it ain't over when it's over
Time, it ain't over

Treading landmines
Getting knocked about
All your allies have started thinning out
And you can't hide, getting older

You wander round
People come and go
You run aground like everyone you know
All the vampires, please leave

We'll leave em something they can talk about when it's over
Time, it ain't over when it's over
Time, it ain't over when it's over
Time, it ain't over when it's over
Time, it ain't over

You're on your way now, there can be no doubt
We'll leave em something they can talk about

Time, it ain't over when it's over
Time, it ain't over when it's over
Time, it ain't over when it's over
Time, it ain't over
