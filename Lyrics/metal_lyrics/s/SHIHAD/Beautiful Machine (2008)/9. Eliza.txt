Sheâs a tragedy, sheâs lost at sea
And we have to let her go
And so begins her search within
And mysteries to be solved

She donât care, says sheâs so over this place
And sheâs unaware, she want out of the rat race

Eliza says sheâs part of a new world
One that makes her feel like a new girl, new girlâ¦

Elizaâs leaving now
And sheâs so in love with her new crowd
Canât forget her

And though she canât see what it is to be
She can feel it taking hold
Through innocence and accidents
That cannot be resolved

Eliza says sheâs part of a new world
One that makes her feel like a new girl, new girlâ¦

Elizaâs leaving now
And sheâs so in love with her new crowd
Canât forget her

Elizaâs peaking now
Better leave her alone until she gets down
And remembers

Her lifeâs a river, rolling to the sea
Starting out a mystery
Itâs funny how we let it slip away
Slip away

Elizaâs leaving now
And sheâs so in love with her new crowd
Canât forget her

Elizaâs peaking now
Better leave her alone until she gets down
And remembers

She donât care, says sheâs so over this place
And sheâs unaware she want out of the rat raceâ¦
