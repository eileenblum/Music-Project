Here you are again
It's a lonely life
Puttng down a friend
But you know you're right
She don't want to think its an oversight
We don't come to see things overnight

I've been thinking about another life
You try anything to prove you're right
Illuminate it in another light
But we don't come to see things overnight

When you coming home?
