Time has a way of casting doubt
Life is a cage they let you out
So fly while you can...

So little time don't let it go to waste
Hold your ground don't throw it all away
And take a chance now

One will hear the other
One will heal the other
One will free the other
It's all the same. Same. Same

So talk. Let 'em know you feel this way
We all have got something good to say
Seek and you'll find...

So little time don't let it go to waste
Hold your ground don't throw it all away
And take a chance now

One will hear the other
One will heal the other
One will free the other
It's all the same. Same. Same

So little time don't let it go to waste
Hold your ground...
Don't throw it away.
