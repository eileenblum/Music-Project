Give us the enemy, the enemy, the enemy
We want the enemy, the enemy, the enemy

Gonna sit and say nothing?
Gonna sit and stay stoned?
Gonna sit there and suck it?

Real big future coming on...
Oh, On, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, On

When the enemy suffers
Then the enemy grows
When you sit and do nothing
Get back in your hole

Not gonna fade into the crowd
Know what the fuck that's all about
Not gonna wait 'til it falls down
No. Take it sideways

Can you feel it pumping through your bones?
'Cause tomorrow will get here and we've gotta go
