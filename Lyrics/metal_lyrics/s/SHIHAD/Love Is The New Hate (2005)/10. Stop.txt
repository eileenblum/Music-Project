Will we get what we begun?
Looking after number one
Never feel you have enough
And you can't do nothing for it
You can't do nothing for it just...

Stop!
The voice inside your head
Don't leave me for dead to you
Dead to you
Dead

Dead You gonna cave
in to your heart?
(Dead) Are we falling out of love?
(Dead) Another day, another ditch
(Dead) And you can't
do nothing for it
Can't do nothing for it just...

Stop!
The voice inside your head
Don't leave me for dead to you
Dead to you
Dead
