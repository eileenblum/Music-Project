for the flow
day will come, day will come
fodder for the show
day will come, day will come

The little Hitler
Shout
We'll send the boys in
to sort you out

and the whole worlds to blame
for not feeling the same
don't be stupid
it's not that simple

Your highness
there is no doubt
you liar, we want you
out, out, out

and the whole worlds to blame
for not feeling the same
don't be stupid
it's not that simple

one day it will all fall down

we fall over
we follow
