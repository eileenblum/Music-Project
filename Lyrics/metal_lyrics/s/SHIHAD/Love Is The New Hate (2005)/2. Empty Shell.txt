All the fables that you know
Light 'em up and watch 'em blow
So forget what you been told
Evolution calling
Bury the truth and bury it well

Empty shell
Explode
Empty shell
It's starting to show

All the damage that you sow
Is coming back so watch it grow
When you think you've had it all
Evolution calling
There is a secret that you'll never tell

Empty shell
Explode
Empty shell
It's starting to show

Hell is raining down upon you
Wait for the sky to fall
And life goes grinding on
Like a month of fucking Sundays

Empty shell [x4]
