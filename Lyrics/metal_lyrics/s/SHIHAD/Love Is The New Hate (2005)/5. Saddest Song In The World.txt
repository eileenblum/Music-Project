I'm drowning
It's over
We're growing
Unstable
Unable
To give in
Keep dreaming
Keep living

With your love I can feel more than anyone
In your heart I can see more than anyone
With your love I can feel more than anyone

I'm falling
Hungover
The world is
Unstable
Ungrateful
To fit in
I love you
But I'm sinking

Just like always...
Like always
Just like always...
Like always

With your love I can feel more than anyone
In your heart I can see more than anyone
With your love I can feel more than anyone

So hold on to it tight [x4]
