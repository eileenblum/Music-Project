Stand up or move down
But I will not live and die without a sound
'Cause the time is right
Got too much hate and emptiness inside

Sunset, sunrise
See the world changing right before your eyes
Go with it, it's a ride
You gotta live for everyday until you die

I'm giving up what holds me down
I'm gonna burn it to the ground
And everything left hanging round
I'm gonna burn it to the ground

I will start over
Start over
Start again tonight

Well I know what's right
But it's getting hard to face the world in these dark times
But I stick with it because I'm alive
And there's a fire in my heart that will not die

I'm giving up what holds me down
I'm gonna burn it to the ground
And everything left hanging round
I'm gonna burn it to the ground

I'm gonna burn it to the ground [x2]
I will start over
Start over
Start again tonight...
