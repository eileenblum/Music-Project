One more year where it just keeps you guessing
I can't forget any valuable lessons
We were all the way out, trying to find a way home.

But you can't forget when you know what you're missing
You can't forgive when you don't even listen
Talking about all the guts and the glory with you.

It's the same old deal what your eyes have been saying
I can't get by all the joy and the pain
We were all the way out, trying to find a way home.

But you can't forget when you know what you're missing
You can't forgive all the time

We were talking about all the guts and the glory
And seeing things out 'til the end of the story
Talking about all the guts and the glory with you.
