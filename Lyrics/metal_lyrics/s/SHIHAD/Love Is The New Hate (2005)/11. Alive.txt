Oaaah
Millionaire
Fuck!
I've got something exploding inside of my head
I will try to forget everything that you said

Royalty
Oaaah
Counterfeit
Whore!
I will try to forget everything that you said
I've got something exploding inside of my head

Oaaah
Wait for it
Oh
I've got all that I wanted in life
Got something you cannot buy
I've got all that I wanted in life
I just need a break I just need a break

I've got something exploding inside of my head
I will try to forget everything that you said

Alive
Alive, or dead
Alive
Alive, or dead

I got something exploding inside of my head
I got something exploding inside of my head

I just need a break
I just need a break
I just need a break
I just need a break

[7/4 instrumental]

Oaaah
Oaaah

Alive
Alive, or dead
Alive
Alive, or dead
Lest we forget
Alive
It's now or never
Alive
We'll burn again
Alive
We'll burn forever
Alive
We'll burn forever
