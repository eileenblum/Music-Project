No it's funeral time again
One last time with all your friends
Feeling fragile, geeling love
Feeling none of the above

Throwing water down the well
Can be heaven, can be hell
I feel stupid, I feel love
I'm feeling none of the above

And now we'll never understand
But things don't always go as planned
