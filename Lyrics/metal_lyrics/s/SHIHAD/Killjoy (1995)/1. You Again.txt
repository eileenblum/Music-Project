I hope I never see you again
I hope I never touch you again
Sometimes I wonder, what's fucked in my heart
Won't let your fingers tear us apart

It's all so simple, it's all over again
A lack of talent is caving you in
Sometimes I wonder what's fucked in your heart
We're losing grip now, now we're falling apart

The speaker speaks but the words sound haunted
So much it's falling out of your hands
Could you ever tell?

And it's there for me, there to see
And it's in full view
Why did I waste my time on you?
