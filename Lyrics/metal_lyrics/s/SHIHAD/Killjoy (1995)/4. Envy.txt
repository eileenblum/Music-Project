Falling - was it right?
Could you tell me - is it right
To envy
Your final escape

Well I spent all year packing on the make-up
Spent all year waiting for your call
And when it didn't come
I was nailed, I was nailed
And when it didn't come
It left me standing
Feet nailed to the floor

How were we
So out of sight
How could you think you were below envy
Was it right?
