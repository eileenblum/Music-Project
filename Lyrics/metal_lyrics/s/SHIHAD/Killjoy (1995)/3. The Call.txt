So nice of you to say
Plans laid out for the highway;
Delivering us to the truth
But that road ain't heading my way
And every suggestion
That finds it's way through the lines
Is it mine? Is it anybody else's
I leave it behind

Looks like we're falling over again
Looks like we're falling over
I feel it pull me under
Looks like we're falling over
The Call goes out and everybody moves
Here we go...

I of sound mind
Fetch me a fix of anaesthetic
Up front, Behind
It keeps me hanging on
Wait - here's the action
To take time, to break time
Hate - it's the function
And it keeps me pushing through
