[Headless Chickens Cover]

A blanket settles on my backyard
The silence makes me lazy
Electricity eats the bain
Fill my head with Novocaine
Red rage on a cool blue day and I had to fight to loose my way
Would you like to buy a flower?
Would you like to see me crawl?

In the penny arcade with the china cups
The waitress does not love me
She has no sympathy
She's been here since a quarter to three
Take away the bloody system
Take away the bloody sun
I'm gonna put a hook into the fish that spawned you
Watch it drowning in the twentieth century

Oh, do the headless chicken
Altogether nothing is clicking
We're not safe in mother's arms
Look out

You nearly missed me
You nearly missed the point
The summer of love is over
So get a job
Buy a car
Eat shit
Well I can't find the reasons for this dumb thing anymore
One of these days and it wont be long
It's gonna be easier to get things done

Tired
Of happy
Waste not
Want not
You could stay right here with me
You could stay right here with me
But you run back to mother's arms
Who knows what goes wrong?
Disgustingly
Dirty
Life's the party
That I could leave
You could stay right here with me
You could stay right here with me
But you run back to mother's arms
Who knows what goes wrong?

Red worm at the same old school
Always laughs at accidents
You see them everywhere
Punching bone with niggers and faggots
The gentleman leaves, wants to get to the world
I film to see them in the afternoon
Telling the rising sun
Violence in the law of the smoking mirror
And those boys who go through so much trouble
To be Rasputin's double
But look so queer behind the big guard dogs
With the girls in the mud you are weeping sores
You called and you found me out
You left a word of advice
Don't make fun of people with guns
Don't tell lies to people with knives

You nearly missed me
You nearly missed the point
Oh, do the headless chicken
Altogether nothing is clicking
You're not safe in mother's arms
Look out
