Sometimes
Feel at the edge of reason
I get strung out
Feel like I'm going nowhere
And then you wind me up
Just like you did before
Gotta thrill, gotta chill, gotta spill
So I can rise again

Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else

Sometimes,
Question mark, full-stop
This process is powerless
There's no way to the top
I get fucked up just to fill me up
Or so I tell myself
And this makes me wonder
Process to order

Every now and then
Right place, right time
I get going with the flow of things
And I'm feeling fine (it's alright)
Getting back to basics
Back to the common mind (it's alright)
I got a chance to rise above
I got a chance to be myself
Like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
