Well you can't work out who you're supposed to be
And you want something
Protection guarantee
When you lost the mystery in what you do
You stretch and aid yourself
Just to see it through

World around, mission reach the end
It's not gonna wait for you my friend
You gotta place your wicked heart
Get back that feeling again

Sometimes lay around for days
Feels like I got nothing left to say
I'm jaded and so cynical my god
I am a young man
With his own heart

When the worlds about to knock me down
Find a home, your angle brings me round
You gotta place your wicked heart
Get back that feeling again
You gotta place your wicket heart
Get back that feeling again

When the worlds about to knock me down
Find a home, your angle brings me round
You gotta place your wicked heart
Get back that feeling again

Jaded up and blown away
When you
Only have a story
