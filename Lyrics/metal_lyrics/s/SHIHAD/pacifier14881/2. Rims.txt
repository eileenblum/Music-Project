While it covers your eyes
Life keep on giving you the booby prize
Get to know ...(?)
While it covers your eyes

While it covers your heart
Can't wait to tear the place apart
Down state, back to start
While it covers your heart

And I, I, refuse to bleed about the
Cheap conspiracies
It's bigger than we
And I, I refuse to bleed about the
Cheap conspiracies
It's bigger than we

Then it's slowing it down
The silence's such a peaceful sound
Your noise, it don't bring me round
What's the state of your heart

Got that look in your eye
I know better but I'm still surprised
Going cold don't make it right
What's the state of your mind

And I, I, refuse to bleed about the
Cheap conspiracies
It's bigger than we
And I, I refuse to bleed about the
Cheap conspiracies
It's bigger than we
It's bigger than we
It's bigger than we are...
