Running round, raising your hand
we don't need reminding
too much honky man
must be the brain that you're not using
waiting for an excuse to lose it
you put the ice in paradise
true blue and sick in the head

The thin white line is such a waste of time
The thin white line, take it from behind

You're thinking that you're making a stand
by pulling out the welcome mat from no mans land
just don't forget where we come from honky
we fucked the world just like you fucking a donkey
new rules for animals
red-neck? I'd rather be dead

The thin white line is such a waste of time
you don't speak for me
don't even know what I see
you're thinking's so, so slow

And you don't know what you need to know
I hope you do in time, then we'll be feeling fine
do you know what I'm talking about?
do ya?

The thin white line is such a waste of time
you don't speak for me
don't even know what I see
you think its so, so slow
