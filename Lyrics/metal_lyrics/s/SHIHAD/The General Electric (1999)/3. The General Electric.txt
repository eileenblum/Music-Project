You better run
as fast as you can
'cause this passenger's not a happy man
start running just as fast as you can

You say, you need a friend
hey, well so do I
but this passenger's just passing by
passenger is just passing
bye.

At your age and stage
you should understand
but you don't care. you got a master plan
Fuck fuck fuck 'em all and take what you can

A freezing cold stare
and a flick in the eye
passengers just passing by
passengers just passing by
passengers just passing by

To walk on water you'd sink in the ice [x4]

You're holding everything inside, you're holding everything inside [x2]
Don't it feel good just to be alive still holding everything inside

You don't know what you want
so you take what you can
still don't make you a happy man
start running just as fast as you can

A freezing cold stare
and a flick in the eye
passengers just passing by
passengers just passing by

To walk on water you'd sink in the ice [x2]
For all things gained there's a sacrifice
to walk on water you gotta sink in the ice

You're holding everything inside, you're holding everything inside [x2]
and don't it feel good just to be alive,
don't it feel good just to be alive
you're still holding
everything inside

And you don't know what you want
do ya?
know what you want
do ya
know what you want
what you want

You're holding everything inside, you're holding everything inside
(You're still holding)
You're holding everything inside, you're holding everything inside
(You're still holding)
And don't it feel good just to be alive, don't it feel good just to be alive
Don't it feel good.
And you're still holding
Everything inside

Everything inside
