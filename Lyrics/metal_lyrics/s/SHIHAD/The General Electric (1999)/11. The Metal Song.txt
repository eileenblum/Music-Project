Sometimes I burn like a paper dog
but mostly, the thing I like doing is doing nothing at all
you're right, I'm going nowhere
I've got nowhere to go
and super-colour nightmare's got something of a hold

So we're slaves of destiny now, are we?
and it's always such an effort to believe
in what you want to be
believe in what you want to be

I take a leather pouch when I go out
there's no money in it
but boredom hits where it most counts
I've had my limit
well we will rise again and boredom ain't my friend

Don't turn your back. don't you be no slack jack. don't turn your back. [x2]

So we're slaves of destiny now, are we?
that's why it's gonna be such an effort to see...
that in a young country
we're free to be what we want to be
gotta ditch the distractions to create a reaction

Don't turn your back. don't you be no slack jack. don't turn your back. [x4]

so we're slaves of destiny now are we?
and it's always such an effort to believe
in what you want to be
believe in what you want to be
