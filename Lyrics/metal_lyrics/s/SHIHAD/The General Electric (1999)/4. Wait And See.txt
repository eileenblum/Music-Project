We could choose to disregard it
or have some fun and break it
since god has just departed
we could carry on or fake it
who has a better plan
whats the true nature of man
whats money to your soul
watch as money takes control

And is there space for every boy and girl
in a competitive, material world
I guess we'll have to wait and see
and I'm trying too hard too believe

Know when to draw the line
know there's a grand design
know there's a better way
I don't know and cannot say
when my respect for man
has taken all it can
the purchase of your soul
placate and we have lost control [x2]

Is it daddy's little boys and girls
become the acne on the face of the world
I guess we'll have to wait and see
and I'm trying too hard too believe

We could choose to disregard it [x2]
who has a better plan
whats the true nature of man
whats money to your soul
watch as money takes control

Is it daddy's little boys and girls
become the acne on the face of the world
I guess we'll have to wait and see
And is there space for every boy and girl
in a competitive, material world
