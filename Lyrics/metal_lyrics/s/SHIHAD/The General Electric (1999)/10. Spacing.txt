Well I'm sad but I'm not empty,
'cause today it's on the cards that I'm on the move
It's alright 'cause when I'm leaving,
my mind draws me a picture to keep of you

Because I can, get a little lonely once in a while
Because I can, I've become a victim of your smile
and you know I can, make it back from all those miles

I'm sore from crash landing,
but at least I made it back from my trip to the moon
And it's alright 'cause when I'm spacing,
the thrill of anticipation gets me through,
I've gotta get to you

Because I can, get a little lonely once in a while
Because I can, I've become a victim of your smile

Though it hurts sometimes remember,
that the beauty lies in everything you do
And it's alright, I know you don't believe in love,
but I believe in you, oh yes I do, yes I do

It's alright 'cause when I'm spacing,
my mind draws in, and reaches out to you

Though it hurts sometimes remember,
that the beauty lies in everything you do
And it's alright, I know you don't believe in love,
but I believe in you, oh yes I do, yes I do
Oh yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
