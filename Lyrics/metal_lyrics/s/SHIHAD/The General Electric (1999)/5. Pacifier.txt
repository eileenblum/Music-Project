You feeling good today
cause I got told that you were
smashed up on your own motorway
but it's O.K
the first upon the scene
a life support machine
but you still collapse as if you were an accidental star

Do you know what the time is
is it messing with your mind kid
are you hurting all the time
and you need a pacifier
come on, lets take a look outside

Don't look so worried you know
there ain't no hurry
cause life's supposed to ebb and flow
now you're all clear to go
and when you're out there
no, they can't catch you
precious star, you are the best at what you are

and do you know what the time is
is it messing with your mind kid
are you hurting all the time
and you need a pacifier
come on, lets take a look outside

come on, lets take a look outside
