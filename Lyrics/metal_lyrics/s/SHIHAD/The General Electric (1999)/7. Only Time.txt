Out on the search for something happening
I lose where I begin
now that something means nothing
a gone man set lose upon the street
moves on up to me
and says with feeling...

When you can't find the world
you can only find yourself
and you can't break away
'til you find your own way
but it takes time...

Gone man, I'm searching for a scene
for something to believe
but you make no sense to me
I've no time for words from an old man
he says "get 'em while you can
'cause life burns up and then it's gone"

When you can't find the world
you can only find yourself
and you can't break away
'til you find your own way
surround yourself with love but nothing else
then you can break away
when you find your own way

and it's only time...
