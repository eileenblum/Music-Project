Redefine your parameters
accelerate the shit you can give
your machine, your best friend
life in cars

And in a world of your own
licence to leave you alone
does tin can = a happy man?
life in cars

Start it up.
we're just along for the ride
how come you shaking inside?
we're just along for the ride

no one'll find out where you live
(life in cars)
you're like a cat with a honk for a hiss
(life in cars)
your machine, your best friend
(life in cars)

And in a world of your own
(life in cars)
your licence to leave you alone
(life in cars)
does tin can = a happy man?
(life in cars)

Start it up.
we're just along for the ride
how come you shaking inside?
we're just along for the ride

When you're caught in a jam
should've stayed in bed
excessive speed is screwing with my head
short click in time was all he said
just slow down, gonna wind up dead
slow down, gonna wind up dead!!!

Redefine your parameters
accelerate the shit you can give
does tin can = a happy man?

Thank your lucky stars for a life in cars
