Well, I trust the police and the government
suck down corporate sentiment
home for dinner, watch TV
caught in the middle of a shopping spree

my minds sedate [x8]

home entertainment and a boring car
(my minds sedate)
If I try to run, I wouldn't get that far
(my minds sedate)
extract the venom, spit it over the shoulder
(my minds sedate)
I'm a victim of a 'sally make-over'

my minds sedate [x8]

you cant run away
if you don't have a brain
deal with it

It's alright [x14]
Is it?

Well, I trust the police and the government
suck down corporate sentiment
home for dinner, watch TV
caught in the middle of a shopping spree

my minds sedate [x8]

you cant run away
if you don't have a brain
deal with it

you gotta deal with this
my minds sedate
