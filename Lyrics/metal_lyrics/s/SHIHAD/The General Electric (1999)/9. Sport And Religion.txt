Hey all you people in the shiny cars
who dug the trenches will reach the stars
we'll watch the funny program
what's it, show or tell?
if it's not what you're thinking
then you can go to hell

Or is it an illusion?
is it an illusion?

Sport and religion
what a game
you can call it progress
but what's the aim?
you can't fake the fantastic
no more, no more
we can't keep on hacking away
when no one knows the score

Or it's an illusion?
is it an illusion?

you've got to give to take away
