When you go against the grain
do you know just how beautiful you are
when there's nothing left to say
you're the brightest star

When there's nothing left to say
do you know just how beautiful you are
when you go against the grain
you're the brightest star

When you go against the grain
do you know just how beautiful you are
when there's nothing left to say
you're the brightest star

We're like the water at the edge of a wave
that gets left upon the shore
disappears into the sand
and was seen no more
