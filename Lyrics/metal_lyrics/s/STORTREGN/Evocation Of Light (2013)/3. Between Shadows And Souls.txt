Lurked are all the thoughts
Compassion is lost
The balance between boredom and sadness is dazed

Between the shadow and the soul
Entity is far away

Under the great light of Erebus
Emptiness is supreme
Your grotesque guise is undeniable

Between the shadow and the soul
Entity is lesser

The Call is coming
Closer and closer
A radical change for insanity
