There is no redemption hut only a perspective of being

This is the only elucidation for salvation
My Cimmerian side is the direction

This is my final road
Leave me alone

My future is hollow, My future is dark
My flesh is burning

Tonight, I will swallow the black flame

All the achievements
Genuine Abhorrence
My past is done, My past is none
My Mind is fading
'Ibis night, It will be it

The Oblivion ain't my fear
(No fright of the necrosis)
Take me in your arms
(Hold me in your arms)
Your angelic smile
(Your seraphic smile)
Your sight is warning,
My death's enunciation

I am no more...

It was the only elucidation for salvation
My Cimmerian side was the direction

It was my final road
Leave me alone
My future is hollow, My future is dark
My flesh is burning
In perpetuum, I'm swallowing the black flame
