Under the dome where the flesh rots
Along with lost souls
On the river bank covered
With wings of fallen angels, fading...

Let us descend together!

Slowly floating on its repulsive risings
On the river's current,
On the darkened waves
Letting myself drift, inside the stream
Where the spring perishes...

A new era is coming,
Swapping the minds of the lost ones

Under the dome
Where presence is vanishing
Along with the lost souls
On the river bank covered with wings
Of fallen angels, fading...

Ah! Calling Us Together!
