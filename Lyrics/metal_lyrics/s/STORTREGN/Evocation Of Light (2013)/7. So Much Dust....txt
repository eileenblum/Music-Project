Plain field, apocalyptic sunset,
This wind oh... so uncertain,

Corpses of animals lying on the floor
As I trampled over them to feel yet so alive...

Water has been intoxicated,
Leaving the aspect of nature far behind
The biosphere has been doomed...

As I, with fallen GaÃ¯a,
Stand alone with so much dust...
