I have seen the stone,
Used to mark your final resting place
I have smelt the stench,
Of the ground in which you remain,

Chained to life by fear,
Your vital organs now turn to sludge
Buried, beneath millions years of life

Realm of forms is now shatter
The chance to escape my bonds,
To corrupt matter

Illuminated I am, in the Light of Sophia!
