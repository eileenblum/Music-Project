By our absolute beings,
Judging our fate by misleading thinking
Toward our innocent mind

Together as one, Together as none
United for harmony, united for loss
Negate to reach answers beyond words

Apophatic chaos reveal the anti-cosmic path!

Apophatic theology

Seeing our acts
Through our never ending wars
Strengthen our minds
To transcend the I and affirm the Self
