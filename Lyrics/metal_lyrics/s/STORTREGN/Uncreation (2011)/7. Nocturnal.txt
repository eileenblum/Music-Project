When, my brain0s burning, into this night thanks to you.
When, my eye's shining into the dark, thanks to you.

Insane pill

Sometimes, you are so bad, so I fill in the nil.
Sometimes, I touch the sky, but the fall, is so hard.

Insane pill, you are so bad, but sometimes, you make me touch the sky.

When, my brain0s burning, into this night thanks to you.
When, my eye's shining into the dark, thanks to you.

Sometimes, you are so bad, so I fill in the nil.
Sometimes, I touch the sky, but the fall, is so hard.
