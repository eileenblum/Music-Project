Every time, around me, I see, the destruction of humanity
This human, disorder, makes me smile, again and again

The sentence, is near you, and none shall be spared
Spreads over the earth, and a cynical eye grows in me
Eye of judgement
Human Disorder

The sun, is burning, your Skin. I can smell your rotten flesh.
You turn, toward the eye, praying, to a god that doesn't exist.
