You've come to the dark side, and your soul is void.

Into you eyes I can see hatred, into your mind, I can feel the flames.
You are my path, but I'm not your slave, I wipe out my past, I erase my sins.

When, I see my face in the mirror, my eyes reflect death, and bloody tears flow.
You are the master, of my mind

When, my soul, my heart, breathe hatred and scorn, I stay, in eternal silence.
Let me live again, again...
