Wake up, keep quiet
Can you hear the screaming, too?
Don't move, just listen
To the Knocks of the cloven hoof

Watch out, they're coming
Looks have encircled you
Cold sweat keeps running
Inroad out of the blue

Wicked, evil, malicious
Messengers of eternal fear

Rats in the attic
Bats in the night
Born in the fire of hell
Sensitive to light
Rats in the attic
Claws just like knives
Rats in the attic
Bound to take your life

Your heart is beating
Like a drum on the battle-field
Don't think you're dreaming
The bite's reality

Satanic smile in the window
Your guardian angel's on the run

Rats in the attic...
