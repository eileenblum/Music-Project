Another sunset glow, another dusk
And I'm getting restless
There's a fire deep inside
I feel the curse's coming
True again, metamorphosis
My clothing gets so light

Foam stains the floor
I'm staggering to the door
The wolf's emerging more and more

Slave to moonlight, moonlight
Prowling in the blue night
Moonlight, moonlight
Sending out the spell
Straight out of hell

The forest's shadow is my
Only friend, when I scent
Sweet blood, hunting is a must
Start running, I'll get you
Nevertheless, I'm burning
With fever, rude animal lust

Damned to attack
Howling with the pack
The beast's not getting of my back

Slave to moonlight...

My conscience's been fading away
Like a flame in the mist
I bark at the pale orb
The curse is too strong to resist
When the morning comes
I know what I've done
When I'm lying naked in the sun
