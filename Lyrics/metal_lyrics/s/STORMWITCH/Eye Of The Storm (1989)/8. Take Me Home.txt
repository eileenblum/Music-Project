The light's going down,I'm lonely again
Between all the voices around me
Staring at you,I just try to catch
One single smile or one look.

Won't you take me in your arms
Won't you make this day a perfect one
Won't you hold me when the cold wind blows
Won't you take me home.

Dreams,I know they'll come true
I want to share them with you
So many eyes,that I have to feed
But the one pair I need's out of reach.

Won't you take me in your arms
Won't you make this day a perfect one
Won't you hold me when the cold wind blows
Won't you take me home.
