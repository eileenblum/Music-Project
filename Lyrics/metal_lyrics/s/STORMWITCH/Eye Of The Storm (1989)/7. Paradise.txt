Now the pain's getting weaker
The pressure's growing less
Soon the dusk hails the dark with a caress
When the shadows' getting longer
The hunter stalks his prey
By the light of the moon's silvery rays

When the night is falling
I can hear them calling
I can hear them calling me.

In the darkness I see paradise
In the night I find my way
In the darkness I see paradise
I don't want to face the day.

Since the dawning of mankind
People tried to hide
From the secrets and wonders of the night.
Please,believe me when I tell you
You should come to know
How it feels just to touch the magic glow

When the night is falling...
