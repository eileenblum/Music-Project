Starlight,high above the valley
Covered congress at the edge of town
Tonight,torches in the alley
Whispered secrets,signs all around.

No time,get your things together
Can't come back leave nothing behind
No time,you know it's now or never
I couldn't bear to lose you one of a kind.

Ooh,help me,take my hand I wanna stay
with you
Ooh,help me.

When we are away from each other
Time will never mend my heart
Each and every day we are growing
Just another world apart

Sunlight's,shining off the water
Memories burning,leaves a longing inside
I feel my will start to falter
On my way returning back to your side.
