Welcome,everybody,we are proud
To introduce the famous Doctor Stroud
He has come to bring your little town
His one and only "Potion Golden Crown"
You gotta take one,two,three sips of his brew
Within a day the miracle comes true.

Tarred and feathered (...is a risk we have to run)

What's your problem,what is your complaint?
Does your hrad ache,do your fields need rain?
We are here to give you health and luck
To compensate our costs,we nee some bucks.

Give us one,two,three,and you will see
Your life will run in peace and harmony.

Tarred and feathered (...is a risk we have to run)

We beg your pardon,sorry,but we have to leave
Another friendly city got another grief
We'd like to thank you for your hospitality
We'd like to thank you for your generosity
The Sherrif's right behind us with a pistol in his hand
Better keep running, better keep running,man!
