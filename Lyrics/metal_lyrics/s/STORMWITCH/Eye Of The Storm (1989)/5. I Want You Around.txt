I know I've hurt you,I've seen the teardrops in your eyes
I try to tell you: "I apologize..."
The things I've said and done
Were never quite the way I feel for you
All around me everything's so cold and bare
All I want is you to be right there
Each little thing I touch
Is just another memory of you

I want you around
I can't explain the pain that I've found
Like a blind man,like a child
I am searching for a sign from you to save me from the night.

Endless minutes while I'm waiting for a call
Your coloured picture is a shadow on the wall
I don't know how to stand the night
Without your soft and tender touch

I want you around
I can't explain the pain that I've found
Like a blind man,like a child
I am searching for a sign from you to save me from the night.

We have had enough of all their easy lies
We were sure to do it right
Since you've left I know we've lost the way
I'm begging you:Come back and Stay!
