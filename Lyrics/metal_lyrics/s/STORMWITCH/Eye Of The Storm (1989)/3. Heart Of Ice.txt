Dreams in white,in a pleasure dome
naked skin on a marble throne
A Roman statue,clear and bright
All alone in a crowded place
Paralyzed by a look in her face
Visions of an endless polar night.

Just like a snowflake on a glowing plate
I melt away with longing for you,my love
Don't forsake.
Heart of ice,in your eyes
I can see just frozen lies
Heart of Ice,I'm willing to flee your embrace.

I can feel the icy breeze
Just one touch is making me freeze
Cold eyes that kill,icicle stings
She's the queen of raging storm
There's no place to keep me warm
One winter night I will be king
