London,after midnight,in the streets
Shadows try to flee the light
While the fog is eating up your steps

Did you read the news today,so why
Don't you stay at home this night?
You just got one life to waste.

You know the warning
But you don't want to hear
Pray for the morning
To stupefy your fear.

Danger,deep in your heart
The nightmare's coming true
Strangers lurk in the dark
They're watching you.

You are dressed to kill,you're on the loose
round the corner,in the shade
They caress a moonlit blade.

Steel in the red light,there's mud on your face
Steel in the red light,there's blood o your lace.
