Breathless silence - danger's in the air
His friend, the storm wind - takes him everywhere
He whispers "Come on"
"I will take you - higher than the sky
Hear it, feel it - now the earth will die
Through me, you have won"
High above there rules the King of winds - and he's looking down and see the earth is quaking, shaking
Break in two
High above there rules the King of winds - and he's looking down and he thinks: weeping, creeping
Death awaits for you
Death by torture - Mother Earth is still
Her wounds - are bleeding she kills without her will
The lonely one dies

[Chorus]

I would wish you - a friend in need for you
That loves your live - you can rely onto
Together we'll rise
High above there rules the King of winds - and he's looking down and see the man are healing, feeling
All the same
High above there rules the king of winds - and he's looking down and he thinks: giving living
Let's play the newborn game
