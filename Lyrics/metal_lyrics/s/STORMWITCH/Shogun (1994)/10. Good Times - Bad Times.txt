We have sailed across the oceans
We have searched for secret lands
Stand at by, we shared emotions
We had the future in our hands
We lived eye to eye with dangers
Some of us had claimed the sea
Through the victims, no longer strangers
So we sweared: To be or not to be!
Now I'm standing here â around me old friends
I'm looking into faces â they're so strange to me
All they do disgusts me â nothing makes a sense
They sponge on another â they're no longer free
Why they've turned so bad?
I'm real sad, why they're so glad?
They're noisy like children â they're dancing and singing
They give themselves up â to live for joy
Without a leader, they nevermore winning
They're totally drunken, from mate to boy
Why they've turned so bad?
I'm real sad, why they're so glad?
You're bastards, I see â there's no way â together
Good times and bad times, we had
Wake up, stop it, wasting your time
You can't be so blind, to see the fact
Now look at me, to see the sign
Or else all will end, like a foolish act
Why they've turned so bad?
I'm real sad, why they're so glad?
You're bastards, I see â there's no way â together

[Chorus]

Start thinking for a change
Widen your old mind's range
Don't give way to stupid indifference
Living means learning â only that makes sense
Wake up, stop it, wasting your time
You can't be so blind, to see the fact
Now look at at me, to see the sign
Or else all will end, like a foolish act
Why they've turned so bad?
I'm real sad, why they're so glad?
You're bastards, I see â there's no way â together
