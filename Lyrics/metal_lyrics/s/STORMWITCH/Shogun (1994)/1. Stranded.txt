Everything he left behind
Familiar faces his own kind
All his friends he left to years
Turned off and left them to their tears
The sea took him with it's mighty hand
It was too late to turn around
Wrecked and lonely he was to be
A typhoon set his ship aground
And he cursed the cruel sea
The sea took him with it's mighty hand
Tossed him up, he's stranded in a unknown land
Stranded - in a foreign land!
Stranded - without people he could understand
He's a man, proud and strong
A man, with just one aim
A man, who never did any wrong
And he is not to blame
Stranded - in a foreign land!
Stranger in a very strange land
He met his old foes the priests again
He had no weapon in his hand
Against their might he stood one man
The sea took him with it's mighty hand
Tossed him up, he's stranded in a unknown land

[Chorus]

But in spite of being lonely
Still he didn't lose his pride
Struggling on and hoping only
He shook fear off with all his might
The sea took him with it's mighty hand
Tossed him up, he's stranded in a unknown land

[Chorus]
