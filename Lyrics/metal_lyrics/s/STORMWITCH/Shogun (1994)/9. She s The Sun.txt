Embracing shadows lie on me
The night shall stay
I don't wan to see
The righteous way
I know that she isn't free
She gave her word
Her life has to be
As a proud bird
In a royal cage, she lives her life
The fate forbids to be a wife
She's the sun and golden shines her light
She's the sun, her smile lights up the night
She's a queen - and out of reach to me
She's a queen - it hurts to set her free
I know, that she has to fight
Lend her hand
For her King, the right
And her land
In a royal cage, she lives her life
The fate forbids to be a wife

[Chorus]

The secret Gods - they pray for you
They save your life, me too
The secret ways - you have to go
You'll have to win, I know
