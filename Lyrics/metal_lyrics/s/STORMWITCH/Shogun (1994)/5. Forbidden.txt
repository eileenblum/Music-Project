In the lighted splendid hall
You can see them all
Waiting for their General and their Lord
Poorly dressed or in fine lace
From far off or near
The smile is frozen on each face
They're all in fear
Now he comes he's shining bright
Showing all his might
He decides who has to live and who's to die
Now he looks at John " Hey you!
Stranger, fast you'll learn
Choose your words true
Lie to me, and you will burn!"
"Yes we're trying to fight
For our land is occupied
We've got the only excuse there is - believe me"
"Forbidden almost everything that we need
Therefore we must fight, we will succeed"
With a laugh he watches him
That was the begin
Of a friendship, which was strange and sad
Lost are who commit the sin
By just giving in
Rule with your heart
And act out your part
"A new world, a new man
Live the new life you began
Keep your footsteps in my path, believe me!"

[Chorus]
