John feels the stare
He turns and he's there
In the middle of a lonely huge place
The priest speaks to him:
"You think you'll win"
With a sneering grin in his nice face
"You think that you're safe
For the King you are brave
But for me, you're a devil
You push with might just
Into the King's trust
You're quite on the level"
"Don't play the holy man
Your aims, I will shatter
I'll speak out the ban,
What happens, doesn't matter"
"I'm alright-for the fight!"
Answers John, because I'm doing fine"
Victory is mine
"Hurry up John
I wish you were gone
I don't want to be your enemy
I want you to live
More I can't give
It's not in the might of me"
"Don't trust in this land
They're head and shoulders above
First they take your hand
And then they cut it off"
"I'm alright - for the fight!"
Answers John, "because I'm doing fine"
Victory is mine
