Moonlight softly covered the garden
Picked out a silvery glittering stone
No breeze to ruffle grass and leaves
No sound from the village to disturb the peace
Yabu he's in meditation
And nearly banned his thought's at all
Finally he can hear the scream
"Scream, scream for my lust!"
Heat crept up to his loins
His breathing grew heavy
He pays attention to what they say
Dawn will break soon
In the garden of pain
Silvery shines the moon
In the garden of pain
The scent of the ocean filled the air
Disturbed by the smell of burning flesh
The victim screams and Yabu moans
Inside the house his virgin was waiting
He heard no he saw
The man boiling alive
Slowly dying for him

[Chorus 2x]

You can feel it too
In the garden of pain
