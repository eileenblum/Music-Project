Lonely the beach was lying
Golden fades the sun
All his dreams, all hope was gone
Since he saw her dying
He can't find no more
Peace of mind - a light behind the door
He looses off the string
And reads, without his heart
"I chose your life - that's my part
You want everything
But you can't see the signs"
He could read between the lines
Somewhere we'll meet again, I know
Somewhere, you'll take my hand
Somewhere we'll meet again, I know
Somewhere, far away, there is a land
"We've just borrowed time
Now listen, what I'll say
Live rejoicing every day
Fulfill the hope of mine
And go just your own way
We will meet again someday"

[Chorus]
