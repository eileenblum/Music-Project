The stars don't shine anymore, the son is appearing white
Storms are raging hard, the birds in the trees had died
The clouds near at hand, those still alive, live in fear
And mankind is past all hope, the time is near

At the end of the world, at the end of all times
Don't be afraid, I will save you from death
In the endless night, I will hold you tight
At the end of the world

Our future's out of hand, it's no use, wasting time
Leave everything behind, this is the seventh sign
Our trip to loneliness will keep us save and warm
The Gods will find us there after the storm
