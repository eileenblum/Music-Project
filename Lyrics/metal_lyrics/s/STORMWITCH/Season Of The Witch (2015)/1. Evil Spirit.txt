Poor fool, wih all this sweated lore
I stand no wiser than I was before
I know that ignorance is our fate

On crooked ways or straight
No dog would linger on like this
So I turn to the abyss

Evil spirit arise, I will join in your company
Evil spirit arise, you only know what I want to see
Evil spirit arise, tell me how everything ought to be
Evil spirit arise, to lose my soul is my destiny

Now, I know th emptiness of what I teach
That man's conversion is beyond my reach
I know dread spirit this is you
My heart is harrowed through

I don't care if I'm lost, this thing must be
Though life should be the cost
Than shall I see, with vision clear
The meaning of sacred sign
Mysterious spirit hovering near
Answer me, if now you hear
