I was born at the end of time
And experienced what know one knows
Now I'm here and in my prime
My mind no longer grows

I am praised with a special gift
For I'm a healer and a king
I'm not here to let things drift
I create when I sing

For I am Taliesin
My existence is in between
What is and what should be
Now look and you will see

For I am Taliesin
Nothing is unforeseen
I know your course of life
And also afterlife

I know how the world appears
When you see it with eagle-eyes
I'm a prey and know the fears
And a hunter in disguise

I have learnt what it's like to be
Living in a deep blue sea
I have changed my form need
I grew wiser with every deed
