When in rainy nights
The wind makes branches creak
And the silvery moon
Paints shadows in the streets

The gates of hell are opening for you
The messengers of doom are waiting too

In the season of the witch
You die in the last ditch
The servants of the end will roam the earth tonight

In the season of the witch
You die in the last ditch
The ladies of the dark give you a poisoned bite

When a clammy fog
Comes crawling from the sea
I can happen to you
That you will loose your way

You have gone a little step to far
And tomorrow no one knows where you are
