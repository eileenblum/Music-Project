We were beaten adn defeated a persecuted nation and I knew
That fighting would be senseless and their promises wouldn't be true
In misery and deep despair, I told it to my race
We parked our thins and set out soon and left our fireplace

For our trail of tears

The distance was much longer than anybody thought
We all suffered in silence like our fathers thought
We had nothing to eat and nothing to drink it was colder every night
The world lay muted as a stone whe nthe first child died

Our trail of tears
