We were five friends since childhood days
With no one else we shared our secret ways
We swear to ourselves
That we never care about anything else
Then our companion

We carved these words into a stone
We always sing these words forever on

True until the end
Here we stand
Against the world
In liberty

We were sixteen the world was on our side
And we never thought, that someone could die

We always sing these words forever on
We sing these words for the killed and the fallen ones

True until the end
Here we stand
Against the world
In liberty
