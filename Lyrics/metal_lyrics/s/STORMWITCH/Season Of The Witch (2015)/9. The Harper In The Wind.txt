Which of you had heard of him
Who had him ever seen
And which of you had talked to him
What does his message mean

We really didn't know his name
I fear, we are to blame
We confess that we have sinned

To the harper in the wind

Didn't fear him anyhow
When you meet him face to face
You have to be scared just only when
He plays his harp with grace
