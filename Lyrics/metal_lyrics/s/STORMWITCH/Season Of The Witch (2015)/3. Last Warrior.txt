We are the beginning, we are the end
We are your companion and your friend
Yes, we are always on your side
We fight for honor and your pride

We keep the promise that we made
Follow us don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

This war is good, this war is bad
It destroys the sluggish ones and the sad

We are the first, we are the last Warriors
We the first, the last Warriors

The hypocrite who breaks the truth
Your blood stained steel shows the proof

We are the first, we are the last Warriors
We the first, the last Warriors

Only war is good it destroys the sluggish ones and the hypocrites
It makes you stronger and steels your believe in blood
The false friend who breaks the faithfulness makes war evidently
Don't be afarid to die when it is for imortality and freedom
