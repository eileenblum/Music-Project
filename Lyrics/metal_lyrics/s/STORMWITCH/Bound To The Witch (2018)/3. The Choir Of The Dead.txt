We are the bigger army than the living
Our spirit of vengeance knows no forgiving
We plow the soil for murder and war
Pain and destruction we are rotten to the core

If you believe you would decide - You are a dumb silly soul
If you believe you would decide - You're a part of a higher control

The choir of the dead, speaks to you
We are so many fall down and pray
The choir of the dead, speaks to you
Honour and sacrifice you must obey

Life after death, just imagination
No need to argue or lamentation
Love truth and justice are your ideals
The world is broken and there is nothing that it heals

If you believe you would decide - You are a dumb silly soul
If you believe you would decide - You're a part of a higher control

The choir of the dead, speaks to you
We are so many fall down and pray
The choir of the dead, speaks to you
Honour and sacrifice you must obey

If you don't believe it - We condemn you pretty soon
Finally you'll lose your mind - And you will never be yourself anymore

The choir of the dead, speaks to you
We are so many fall down and pray
The choir of the dead, speaks to you
Honour and sacrifice you must obey
