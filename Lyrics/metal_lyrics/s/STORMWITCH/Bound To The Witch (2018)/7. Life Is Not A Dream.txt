Your mother
Has told you fairy tales
And kept everything from you
Your world was bright and clear

In your street
Were only houses with large gardens
Youâve learned to play the violin
Love was always near

Now you lie sad in my arms
I can not save you from the world

Life is not a dream
I know you have your deen
Life is a constant battle normally
Life is not dream
I know you have your deen
But you must grow up in the end finally

You say
All are mean to you
But defend yourself
This you have to learn

You must stop
Seeing yourself alone
You're no longer a child
No matter what you want or yearn
