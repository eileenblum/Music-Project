It was this faithful horrible moonless
Night as pale clouds drove over the sky
You didnât thought about something
When she walked by

Her spiteful eyes puts you into her spell
And a shiver runs down your neck
And it was clear to yourself - there is no turning back

You are bound - you never had a choice
You are bound - no escape from this
Deep dark voice we're all bound to the witch

She does with you everything that she wants
Her might is malicious and mean
She awakes in you the greed far
Power youâve never seen

For the last time you try to turn away
But you passion is to strong
You were to weak - and everything
Turned out wrong

You are bound - you never had a choice
You are bound - no escape from this
Deep dark voice we're all bound to the witch
