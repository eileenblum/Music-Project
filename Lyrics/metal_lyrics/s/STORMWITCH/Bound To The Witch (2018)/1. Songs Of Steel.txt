You were down, depressed and lonely
Since the day that you are born
Everything that exists around
You was unholy crushed and torn
You were looking for forgiveness
You were looking for some sense
But there is no place for freedom
You just find some faked romance

You can't find a way, life is hopeless anyway

Songs of steel - In the nights you feel insanity
Songs of steel - You are searching for the door
Songs of steel - Now the wind brings you this melody
Songs of steel - You are different than before

You roam restless through the night
You will find good company
Now you hear these sounds of thunder
Here there is the best place to be
Many thousands stand around
You now tonight you feel alive
And the band plays like a whirlwind
And the song tells of your life

You have find your way, life is glorious everyday
