Before hundreds of years
Lived men without any fears
They moved to the south in the war
The way was rough and far
They fought for their ancient gods
For the freedom of their thoughts
Paid no attention to their wounds
They trusted in their runes

It is tightened on you
Pull out your weapon do not remain
Hide your gold and belongings
Tell your children to meet again and again

We bring back the ancient times
We keep the spirit alive
We bring back the ancient times
We get up again

We will not let us sell
We will push them back to hell
Theyâre inferior to us now
We create it better somehow

It is tightened on you
Pull out your weapon do not remain
Hide your gold and belongings
Tell your children to meet again and again

We bring back the ancient times
We keep the spirit alive
We bring back the ancient times
We get up again
