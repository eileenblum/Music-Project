I lived in England, a son of the monarchy
My teachers taught me to rule the world
I was George the third, my life wrote history
Great things were happening
Great things youâve heard

But there was this rainy day
When I felt alone I smelled the
Poison and I froze to stone

I was open minded never thought of treason
Light come light go I saw no reason
However you do it, it leads to a bitter end
Life shows no mercy there is no friend

The last best hope went down on this morning
Because my lovers face showed me a warning

I was sold down any river that
You can think about
All of them will kill me there is no doubt
I hear them coming, they will arrest me
God help my soul, I wanna be me

I live in nowhere is there a somewhere
Is there an end of this or just black despair
