Have you heard of the missing child
Or of the woman who was strangled
And even from the bum stabbed wild
On the bench at the great lake
And the police can't find a felon
Not to mention missing people
I'm telling you this is the factory of an unreal being

The ghost of Mansfield Park
Roams through the dark
The ghost of Mansfield Park
Lurks on the wall
The ghost of Mansfield Park
Roams through the dark
The ghost of Mansfield Park
Will kill us all

You do not know the story certainly
But many old people it is known
Yes once there was an injust verdict
From this his hate was madly grown
Urged by the fury gaved the judge to an innocent was beheaded
He screamed for justice but the mob roared
And his blood comes over us now
