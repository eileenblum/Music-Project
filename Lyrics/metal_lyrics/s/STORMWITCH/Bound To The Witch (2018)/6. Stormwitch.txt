We sailed at morning from my home on this beautiful day
We were hoping for success and luck at the end of this difficult way
In the distance I could see you there on the cliff above the sea
Your hair was flickering round your face and I knew that you love me

The shore it slowly disappeared from our field of vision
A good wind even filled the sails on our favoured mission
Out of nowhere came a black cloud dangerous looming
In no time it covered the sky above us it was night

Lightning flashed in the deepest blackness garishly disastrous
A whirlwind whipped the water in our boat god save our soul

Stormwitch my everything
You are not like everyone
Stormwitch my happiness
Your life will go on and on and on

I drifted in the water an eternity
My hope for a fast salvation didn't recite me
The wind dropped and the waves calmed down and the sun came back
On me fate had given up its worst ever attack

Now I stand here and you tell me all my friends are missing
You will really tell me that my favorite was to blame
Your superstition is so shameful treacherous horrible
You turned her name to something evil isn't that enough
