Forests that stand in flames
Countries sink into the ocean
All things are in motion

The houses are in rubble
And in the streets screaming children
Through the night echoing gunfire
Mothers are shot from a rifleman

The poisoned waters spew their life from
The steppes is burned and starve their animals
Their animals

Odinâs ravens circling over land and sea
Odinâs ravens, their ears are willing to see
All and forever

And the ravens remember
Back to the times before 2001
Back than most countries bloom
No one reached for the golden throne

Blood and death, torture and hate everywhere
People who do not talk, but only kill - only kill
