Desire, born in the fire
I want to look into my future
No name, it's all the same
I know it's a horrible creature
That day, we seek the way
I hope that I will soon know more
Come now, he'll show you how
I will ask the magic mirror
The picture's flying by, rising higher and higher
Oh, tell me my Queen what I see now
Tell what I shall deem - talks in riddles
So say what you mean, he belongs to you
Hold on, my heart is gone
The magic has captured my soul
Free me, I can not see
He will find me in my hole
Her Majesty, she smiled, the magic's gone and left you
Oh, tell me my Queen.
