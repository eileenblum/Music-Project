Throw the ring inside, Theja it's just right
Throw the ring and be free
It's just a headache, what's got in you late
Throw the ring and be free
Just can't, it belongs to me
No I won't, no matter what you see
The final deed is in your hand
Time to get free now
Time to be free now
My friend do what's right, you must now win
The fight, it depends on you
Think about Xanteur, make no surrender
At the edge of the dark
Don't cry, undrestand
Without ring I can not stand
Without ring my life is at an end
Time.
There - who's creeping upon on me?
Who - swipes the ring? I can't see
On the crater walls they fought
The brave one tried to make this stop
The foe fell in the fire slot
Time.
