The time has come, the witches are ready tonight
on the hill, black sabbath, evil rite
they are descending on magical broomsticks
riding on he-goats through the night

Come nearer, come nearer
you can't resist their might
at walpurgis night

All around you can smell a nasty, strange scent
they are making oils from the bodies of murdered infants
they're dancing 'round a hot, flickering fire
mixing poison, singing cursed songs

Come nearer, come nearer
you can't resist their might
at walpurgis night

Warted feed are trembling the ground like and earthquake
they are making love, with broomsticks with rats and with snakes
holding crazy orgies with the devil
praying to the master of hell

Come nearer, come nearer
you can't resist their might
at walpurgis night
