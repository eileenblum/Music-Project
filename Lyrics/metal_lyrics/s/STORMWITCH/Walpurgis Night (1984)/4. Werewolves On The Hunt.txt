Deep in the misty forest
In nights when wind stops blowing
And when the moon hides its face

Spit out of evil darkness
Hell's infants, night's black agents
Then Satan starts a bloody race

Thick fog leads you astray
Watch out, you've lost your way
You're feeling cold, feeling ill

The mob of beasts are hungry
They scent your sweaty body
They're doomed to hunt, born to kill

Dont't look back, they follow your tracks
You can hear them growl and grunt
Start to run, the chase has just begun
There are werewolves on the hunt

You're staggering on the wood-ground
You're stumbling and you fall down
Thorny branches scratch your face

Get up and keep on running
Get up and keep on running
No chance to flee their cold embrace

Don't look back.....

Deep in the misty forest
In nights when wind stops blowing
And when the moon hides its face

The sound of crackin' bones
Echos through nightmare's home
You've lost your life at Satan's race

Don't look back.....
