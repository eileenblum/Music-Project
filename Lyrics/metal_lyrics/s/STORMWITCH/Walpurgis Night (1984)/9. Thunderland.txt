Metal nights in the city
can you feel the heat
the aching in your soul
silver chains and black leather
and you're breaking out
of your cage-losing control

Rock- Rock 'till the end

Come make a stand
in Thunderland
Come join the band
in Thunderland

Gimme sweat, gimme power
i want you to rock
come on, stand up and shout
stamp your feet, shake your body
do it all night long
we all like it hard and loud

Rock- Rock 'till the end

Come make a stand....

Reviews
What we have here is Stormwitch's first release, Walpurgis Night, and it's
also the beginning of what was still to come. For being a new band's first
album, WN is a really great album, but it still doesn't have the personal
and original seal of quality that featured the later recordings, so its
sound can be easily compared with many other bands of the time that were
starting these years, like Tyrant or Stranger. Still, WN features true
classics that were showing the start of a great and innovative sound, and
were destinated to shock every true metal fan, tracks like Priest of Evil,
Skull and Crossbones or Flour in the Wind already show that obscure and
mysterious sound which was going to be the Witch's trademark. Every song
filled with lyrics about ancient legends and terror tales, the album starts
with an excellent Cave of Steenfoll, which brings a great "powerful yet
melodic" sound that doesn't give up until the end, Thunderland, which is a
true metal hymn, followed by the fabulous instrumental Excalibur.
Definately a must for every metalhead who wants to hear the roots of
Stormwitch.
