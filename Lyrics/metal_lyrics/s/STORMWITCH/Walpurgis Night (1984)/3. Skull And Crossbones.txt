Caribbean sunrise
on the sea lighting rays
on the red horizon
ships appear with sails that seem to blaze
forty fearless outlaws
always ready to fight
they want gold and women
and a bottle of Jamaican rum each night

Try, try to flee
when you see
the flag of terror flying over you
Peaked grapnels crash
through your ship
they attack out of the blue

Skull and crossbones, blood in sight
burning sails light up the night
skull and crossbones, piracy
they're the tigers of the sea

Greed for pearls and diamonds
they are hellbent for gold
their notorious symbol
makes every decent sailors'blool run cold
like the mighty eagle
diving down on the lamb
pirates don't give mercy
when they fight and get the upper hand

Cold, blood-stained steel
can you feel
the boarding-axe being pressed against your chest
don't hesitate
fight don't wait
'till the bogy seals your fate

Skull and crossbones...
