On the top of a hill
where an icy wind's blowing
there is a hole in the ground
In the deep shadows
between moss-grown deep rocks
a demon is creeping around

A long time ago
a handful of brave men
arrested the beast in this cave
they blessed the prison
with clear holy water
from this time on the Earth was safe

'till now, the beast hasn't died
I know that hell's still alive
'till now, he lurks in the night
I know that hell's still alive

Since five hundred years
he's waiting impatient
for someone to open his cage
The demon is roaring
greedy for vengeance
his black soul is foaming with rage

'till now, the beast hasn't died
I know that hell's still alive
'till now, he lurks in the night
I know that hell's still alive

You hear a whispering voice
it confuses your brain
You're in a fever
the words nearly drive you insane
You're forced to climb onto the hill
of man's destiny
You're forced to desecrate the place
to set him free

'till now...
