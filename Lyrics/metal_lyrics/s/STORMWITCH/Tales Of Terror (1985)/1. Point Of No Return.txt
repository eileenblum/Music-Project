When the night's falling
and the dark's crawling
in the streets where the bats fly out to kill
When a wolf's howling
and the death's prowling
when the witches are dancing on the hill

Can you hear the madman shout?
Someone blows the candle out

Standing at the point of no return
the sky's on fire
now it's Satan's turn
the point of no return, no return

When an owl's crying
and a dog's dying
when the forces of evil rule the land
When the pane's breaking
and the ground's shaking
when the gods take revenge on every man

Spider webs stick to your face
Can you feel their tight embrace?

Standing at the point...
