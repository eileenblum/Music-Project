At one time lived in a small place by the coast
A founling that didnÂ´t had a name
The people in the town didnÂ´t take notice of that maid
The place was called "Moonfleet"
And thay called her the same

Moonfleet

No one cared about this little girl
Although she had a spezial gift
What she dreamed of, always come true
But that only knew

Moonfleet

"Hear my words - a flood will come
Hear my words - we all will drown then
Hear my words - please built a dyke"
So told them again and again

Moonfleet

They at last believed what the little girl said
And so everyone could be saved before the flood
And since that day erybody knows her name
The place was called "Moonfleet"

Moonfleet
