From the gate of the kings where the loud horn calls
The north wind rides and falls
What news from the north can you bring today
Who went that long and stony way

Move on - bring the message to my friend
Move on - until the war will end

Over fen and field where the long grass grows
The west wind comes and goes
What news from the west do you bring tonight
Have you seen the glorious fight

Move on - bring the message to my friend
Move on - until the war will end

From the endless sea where the goddes lives
The south wind moans and grieves
What from the south can you tell to me
How many passed the flowing sea

Move on - bring the message to my friend
Move on - until the war will end
