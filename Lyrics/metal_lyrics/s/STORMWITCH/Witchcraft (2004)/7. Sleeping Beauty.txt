In our childhood days
We played princess and prince
We followed our dreams
WeÂ´re decided ever since
I habe built you a castle with roses and thyme
And there I first kissed you
And so you always will be mine

You are my sleeping beauty
YouÂ´re all that I am
To call for your lovinÂ´
Is all that I can
You are my sleeping beauty
Wherever you are
Forever in me, if near or if far

We experienced the world
In our short years
As real as paradise
Without any tears
But in a single moment, all the passion died out
I lonely and thougtful IÂ´m wandering about

Still you are my sleeping beauty
