If you want to have a good time
Well, there is just one single way
Let us meet our old companions
That we have found along the way

Still our days and nights are endless
Still weÂ´re running wild and free
Still those women are temptation
Play the game like it used to be

Le us drink to the times that we had
The good and the bad
Until weÂ´re dead - hoi
Let us drink to the times that we had
The good and the bad
Until weÂ´re dead

DonÂ´t look back in anger
The old times still remain
Everything is changing
But somethingÂ´s still the same

With the years itÂ´s getting harder
To party all night long
But donÂ´t let them steal your power
To sing our finest song

Let us drink...
