In those days of the Roman emperors
Issued a decree that a census should be taken of the world
Joseph was one of the labourers
With Mary he went to Bethlehem, the town of David
You have something heard

While they were there, a child was born
The mother wrapped him in some clothes
And placed him in a manger by the inn

While they were there, a child was born
The shepherds watched their flocks at night
The Lord appeared and they were terrified
While they wer there, a child was born
DonÂ´t be afraid, heÂ´s in the world, heÂ´s born to you
The sinister child

The shepherds straight went to Bethlehem
To find the place to glorify and serve the child
And many were with them
Three kings had heard of the mystery
They were overjoyed to find him there
They worshiped him and praised their destiny

And a star was shining bright
The tidings spread out through the land
That through his birth a new time will arise

And a star was shining bright
But he birth it was not underfiled
And the demons danced untamed so free and wild
An a star was shining bright
DonÂ´t be afraid, heÂ´s in the word, heÂ´s born to you
The sinister child
