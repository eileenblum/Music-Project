I am standing by the sea wondering
See some birds fly over me wondering
So many things have passed my way wondering
I took it easy day by day wondering

But then came a day that changed my mind
And I stopped admiring what he said
And IÂ´ve recognized he isnÂ´t blind

Fallen from God
Now here I stay
I donÂ´t believe
Do not save me in the Judgement Day

IÂ´m just born to fade away thank you
I see cruelty in every way thank you
Mortal life kills to survive thank you
Praise the lord for this simple life thank you

Your creation is so wonderful
You looked at it and it was good
Please be gentle to the ones, that never understood

Fallen from God
Now here I stay
I donÂ´t believe
Do not save me in the Judgement Day
