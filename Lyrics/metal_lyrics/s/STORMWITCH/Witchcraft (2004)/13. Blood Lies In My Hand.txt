[Bonus Track]In my head, in my brain
There is something still remaining from the past
Was it "breaking the chains"
Was it destiny that was happening at lost

I have cried to my father, I have prayed at the moon
Is there anybody healing me so soon

It was always the same
There was something strage in the corner of my world
Never ending the game
Can I stand the power of the flame that burns my soul

I have prayed to my father
I have cried at the moon
Is there anybody healing me
Someone bring her back to me
I just want to see her smiling face

IÂ´ve given her my heart, IÂ´ve given her my soul
But the door it slammed and she has left me lonely
IÂ´ve given you my heart, IÂ´ve given you my word
But the darkness came and you have left me lonely
So lonely - and now your blood lies in my hand

IÂ´ve given you my heart IÂ´ve given you my word
But the door it slammed
And you have left me lonely
So lonely - and now your blood lies in my hand
