King Herod gave a banquet for all his leading man
They ate and drank and they were pleased
He called for his daughter, he loved her for her beauty
"Dance for me at this feast"

"Ask me for anything all that you want, an I will give it to you"

She smiled at him gently and thougt by herself
This day you will regret
No longer IÂ´m your daughter, I want to kiss that prophet
Or otherwise he will be dead

The night of the seven veils - she wants to seduce him
The night of the seven veils - she wants to confuse him
The night of the seven veils - he just let her feel his hate
The night of the seven veils - and so she wants his head onto a plate

Her dances were bewitching, she danced the seven veils
She was so passionate and pure
The guests and her fahter they cheere more and more
Her father promised her for sure

"Ask me for anything, all that you want, and I will give it to you"

"I love John the Baptist, but he wonÂ´t look at me
He just found words of disdain
All that I will ask for the head of John my lover
This is the pleasure for my pain"

The night of the seven veils...
