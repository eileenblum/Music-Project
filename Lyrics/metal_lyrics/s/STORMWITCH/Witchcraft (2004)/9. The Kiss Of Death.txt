When I saw you in that moonlit night
The sea mirrored your face
Your silhouette so angelic
I felt a deep disgrace

Yes, I know, I shouldnÂ´t do it
But I love your innocence
You will love it, when I give you
The kiss of death

Your parents died when you were young
Since then you lived alone
Your days grew on and on and on
IÂ´d foreseen it, then IÂ´d known

Yes, I know, I shouldnÂ´t do it
But I love your innocence
You will love it, when I give you
The kiss of death

I stole myself into your heart
I was your brother and friend
During all that time, I wished and longed
Desired the final end

Yes, I know, I shouldnÂ´t do it
But I love your innocence
You will love it, when I give you
The kiss of death
