So you're a stranger in our town we've got an offer
Please sit down, listen close to the words
Down by the river there's a mill, a haunted place
Where evil fills every rafter and stone

You just have to be strong one night long
Break the spell, you really got the might

You need to stay just for one night

A chest of silver will be yours if you dry up
The voodoo source, you got no time to lose
The haunting starts at twelve o'clock when every wall
Will start to rock to the yells and the screams

Yellow smoke from the beams, oh it seems
You're a toy in the hand of devil's breed

You need to stay just for one night

They scratch your face, they pull your hair, they sting and bite
But you've to dare the unending attack
The fainter moonlight's shining in the more
They make the welkin ring, at dawn they are gone

You just have to be strong one night long . . .

You need to stay just for one night
