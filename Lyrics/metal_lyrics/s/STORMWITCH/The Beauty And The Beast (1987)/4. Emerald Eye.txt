We've sailed across the ocean, through the storm and rain
We've come to find the jewel, we believe it was not in vain
Through dusty plains and deserts, we have searched so long
We feel the quest will end in the cold of this tropic dawn

Look the island is in sight, veiled in mist and golden light
Row the boat, let's go ashore, row more and more

The emerald eye, crystal fire's power takes me high
The emerald eye, like a torch in the night
Turning darkness to light, I'm reaching out for the sky
The emerald eye

Eternal youth and fortune, so the legends tell
Will be the finder's pay, let us start digging at a spell
Since forty hours we're working, without sleep and rest
But suddenly our spades strike the planks of a wooden chest

Pick the padlock, break the seal, let me be the first to feel
The almighty crystal stone, I wanna touch it alone

The emerald eye . . .

It is mine!

Storm and rain, now I know--I know it was not in vain
Crystal stone, I'm the one to rule--all alone
I will fight, get away or my bullet takes your life
I'm divine, it is mine!
