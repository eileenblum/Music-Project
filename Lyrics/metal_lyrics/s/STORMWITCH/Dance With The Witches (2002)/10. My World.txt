I remember very well
Even in my childhood days
There were times so dark and cold
And I felt lost and small

When there was no hope in sight
And there was no helping hand
I opened up a book
And so I opened up the door

To my world

I arrived in Transylvania
In the dead of the night
And since that I ever feared the daylight
But I could fly and became a seven lives

And I lived my phantasy
And it became reality

In my world

I was Merlin I was Cesar I was Mister Hyde
I became a werewolf by the moonlight
And I died in the arms of Julia

In my world
