In the ancestors times
When the world still was young
Man believed in what they called
The Gods of Light

Their image of God, was a circle of fire
And just their own dreams, satisfied their desire
At the end of the day, they met on the hill
The wind took their prayers, and carries them still

Follow the Knights of Light
And you will find
Pleasure like never before
Follow the Knights of Light
And you will find
They bring you to far distant shores

They said believe in yourself
In your strength and your will
And give freedom to others
So you find it yourself

Their image of god...

Follow the knights...
