Jeanne d' Arc the holy
The brave the devine
The saviour of our land
She was just a little girl
When she took her final stand
The rain felt on her
So help me God
She kneeled down
So help me God
She gave her prayer
So help me God
She gave her in his hand
Jeanne d' Arc the holy
The brave the devine
On a beautiful day in spring
When france proclaimed it's victory
She went beside the king
The bells sang it loud
You won the day
The people rejoiced
You won the day
The king said to her
You won the day
And gave her his ring

But fate was against her
Her enemies played tricks on her.
The good and the truth has failed.
Shemes and treason like often won.

Jeanne d' Arc the holy
The brave the devine
Her sun shone just a while
Condemned and abused they took her away
And brought her to the funeral pile
She stood strong
So help me God
All alone
So help me God
Her last words
So help me God
She died with a fearless smile
