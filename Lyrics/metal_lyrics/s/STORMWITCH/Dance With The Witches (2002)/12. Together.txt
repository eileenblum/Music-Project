We've lost sight of us
For many years
I know now we made mistakes
Now let's left those times behind us
Now let's make another try
Don't you believe in friendship
In our future
From now begins a better life

Since long ago
We shared the same dreams
We had the same goals in our mind
And your questions are
Still not answered till today
Still we love this day and night
We are united
We love this music through
All times and till the end

For as long as we're together
Lies the future in our hands
Standing side by side
One thing on our mind
Through ups and downs
Forever friends
