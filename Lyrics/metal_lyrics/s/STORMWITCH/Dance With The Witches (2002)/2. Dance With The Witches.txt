You know the story goes
Like worms we crawl out of the ground
They say we'll bring the pest
On this you can count

The devil is honouring us
In magical mystical nights
He turns us around and around
We're bound to his dark gloomy mights

Come and dance with the witches
Don't spare no pains get rid of your fear
Come and dance with the witches
Close season is over the witches are near

It's right we're sly and cruel
We come at night and steal your best off all
At least your innocence
And no one hears your call

The devil...

Come and...
