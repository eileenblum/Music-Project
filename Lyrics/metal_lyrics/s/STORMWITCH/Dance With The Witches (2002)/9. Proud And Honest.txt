At the maelstrom laid a land of glory
For there lived the daring Kelts
Many battles had written their great story
Their strongest weapon was their celts

They fought with power
Blue was their colour
Rome felt the danger
Their women fought like men
They believed in the elder gods

Proud and honest
The defended
Their right for freedom
Proud and honest
Banned and damned
No one knew where from
They came

From the mountains down into the valleys
You could hear their battle cries
They faced the death not one got on the galleys
Her legend rose in this wise
