Back in the year 1606
When the inquisition
Played with glowing sticks
Lived there in Cologne
A beauty truly known
All the people whispered
She's the devil's bride

She gave birth to a child
When she was 25
Her daughter looked like her
When she ended her live
She was free and wild
And died for her child
Many people whispered
She's the devil's bride
Here and now 2002
A girl is born
And she looks like her, too
Lives here in Cologne
A beauty truly known
But no one ever whispers
She's the devil's bride
