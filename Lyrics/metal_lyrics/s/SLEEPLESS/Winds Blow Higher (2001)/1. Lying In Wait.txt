Painted in black, our truths and the lies
But out lips and the body have lost control
Textures and patterns of those who defeat
The memory reminds my soul

So I'm standing now waiting for you
No, I'm lying in wait with nothing to do

Injured my flesh, the skin and the bones
But the nerves are right - or not - they're wrong
Pictures and sounds of those I would die from
Memories will make me strong

It's my hell
Shattered
Fall for me

Be with me this night, I'm lonely, it's so cold
Dream with me this night, I'm lonely growing old
Take the time and find your dark reality
Kil the lights inside and lose idenitity

Cold are my hands
Hot is my heart
Logic has crushed me
Right from the start

And for those of you
That light isn't true
The pain, the guilt
Vanishes, fades away and away...
