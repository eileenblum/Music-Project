So they're here, by my side
Gathered all, black and white
Toy soldiers, day and night

So we put them to war
As the allies roar
For the right to live
And the fight for the right to give

Do you remember when I come home?
That there's a battle I'm coming from?
Battle that I'm coming from...

Why do we choose the anger in this life?
We do we lose our tember - it's my strike
Tolerance could be the name
Patience would be the game

And again and again I say:

What do we need?
What do we breed?
What do we choose?
What do we lose?

Tolerance could be the name
Patience would be the game

Do you remember when I come home?
That there's a battle I'm coming from?
Battle that I'm coming from...

If you see me cry then understand me, try
As the pressure within, draws to it's lethal way
The plate which holds our promises is breaking
The ground which holds our future is shaking

Would you remember when I come home?
That there's a battle that I'm coming from?
Do you remember when?
