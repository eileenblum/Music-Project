The sand, the grains - a symbol of time
The sea, the waves - a song with a rhyme
A desert wind

Time - shattering the images above and healing wounds
A desert wind, a frying sun
A holy war handled by an angry gun
The night, the moon, the sky, the stars above us
The day, the sun, burning the mysterious thoughts
Inspiring an artist

Did you ever think, did you ever know, did you ever feel
That I was last to go?
Waiting at the gallows pole
There's a time when our dreams should be fulfilled

The screen of rays full of mist
A little child grown by the loving priest

There's a time when our dreams should be fulfilled
The day we come back from the landmine field
Distorted figure covered in black
Another soul is hidden away from you
Well what's the point?

The sand, the grains - a symbol of time
Well what's the point
If your ego is based on your success?
So the story goes on like a game of chess
