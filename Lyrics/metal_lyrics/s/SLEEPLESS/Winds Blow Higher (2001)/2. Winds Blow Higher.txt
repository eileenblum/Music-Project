And in the day and in the night
When I fear that's my fight
Winds blow higher (and the wind blows wild)
A thousand miles apart (tear me down, moonchild)
Today is the day of art

Shattered dreams, illusions in the night
Today I'm feeling right
Faith with me will always be
With ignorance in me, it's just a plea
For wisdom and technology
The faith with me

Time, prime time
Tomorrow we leave the sky
Time chasing time
There to see the future of my rhyme
There to see the future of my rhyme (with you)
Rhyme with you (to you)

Just a secret that has never been told
As the writing on the paper, it's bold
Break an entry, tear it down
Set it lose and turn it around

Take a chance to ask me a question
Far beyond your destiny
Collide your fear with your deepest depressions
It's too fatal for us to see

No matter what it turns, no matter how it burns
Turn the pages upside down
And let it go like a merry-go-round
(It's me you blame for, always me)

Where do you look for (you blame for)
Where do you search for (now I'm gone)
Winds blow higher, a thousand miles apart
Winds blow higher (and the wind blows wild)
A thousand miles apart
Moonchild
