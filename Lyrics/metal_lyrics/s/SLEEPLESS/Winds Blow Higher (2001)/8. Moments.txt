One second and I turn away
My shadow's gone and it turns to day
One moment and I go and pray
The light turns off and I sleep away
Did I ever believe you?
Did I ever forgive?
Did I ever obey?
Did I every betray?

A kiss from your lipstick
Will heal the scar you made
Held me up like a marionette
After I was laid

Can't feel your warmth
Can't feel your touch
Understanding so little
So much
Goodbye

We don't know the reason why
We try to leave the past behind
Still looking for some peace of mind

Hate how much you can rate
When you're feeling down, does it make you feel great?
Believe how much you can give
The door is open, you're welcome to leave
