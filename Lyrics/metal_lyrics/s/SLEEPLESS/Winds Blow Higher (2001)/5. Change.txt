It's funny how I missed a life
Funny how I missed a life
Happy cause I don't know why

So I say to myself
And I feel the change
Begging my rage
And I know it's a part of our nature
So hear my lecture

Come over, come inside
And let me see the things you hide
Come over, can't you see?
It's a part of reality

So I say to myself
And I feel the change
Begging my rage
And I know it's a part of our nature
So hear my lecture

Feelings are a part of the universe
So why do we change the course?

As white as clouds
As right as rain
A feeling that's right
A feeling of pain

Global is the issue
When they want you to pinpoint
This mortal way of life
Illusions of my knife
Global is the issue (is the issue)
Do you want me to pinpoint?
My mortal way of life
Illusions of the knife
