Blue blooded men and nobles
Addicted to richness and fame
No lies, we see through your mask
You're cruel, mean, bad to the bone

You sit on a throne of sorrow
Wearing the dark crown of hate
Worshipers of empty idols
Made of gold and precious stones

But today rebellion's raging wild
Like a burning flame

Royal tyrants, they are devils in disguise
Royal tyrants, on a mission from the gods of war

The ones who dare to oppose you
Are guilty and sentenced to death
The innocent in your dungeons
Feels the whip ripping his back

This mercilles gear keeps rolling
Fed by the corpses you've drained
We'll make you regret this direness
Too much blood stains on your hands

But today rebellion's raging wild
Like a burning flame

Royal tyrants, they are devils in disguise
Royal tyrants, on a mission from the gods of war
Royal tyrants, never trust their evil lies
Royal tyrants, domination is their final goal
