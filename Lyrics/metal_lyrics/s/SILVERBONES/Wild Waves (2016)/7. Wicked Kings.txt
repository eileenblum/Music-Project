Invisible bodies covered with black cloaks
Phantoms who refuse the light
Roaming the lands arouse frightening terror
They came from the empire of night

Doomed to obey the word of their master
Blind tools under his will
Long shining blades and spine chilling screams
They rule with shadow and steel

Corruption and war, the rise and fall of men
Like vultures they come, they slay and they hunt, beware!

Ride on black horses spreading their evil seed
Poison of treason has splattered the path of the wicked kings

A glorious past as great leaders of men
Fighting the armies of dark
The might of the old days turned evil and stronger
Cause greed was devouring their heart

[Repeat chorus]

Invisible bodies covered with black cloaks
Phantoms who refuse the light
Roaming the lands arouse frightening terror
They came from the empire of night

Corruption and war, the rise and fall of men
Like vultures they come, they slay and they hunt, beware!

Ride on black horses spreading their evil seed
Poison of treason has splattered the path of the wicked kings

Servants of darkness back from the underworld
Lifespan will run to the edges of time for the wicked kings
