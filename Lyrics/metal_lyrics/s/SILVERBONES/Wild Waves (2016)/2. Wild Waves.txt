Ropes in the hand, it's time to weigh anchor
And spread our sails to the wind
The hard wooden hull that slices the water
Rounding islands and reefs

Searching for gold we're back to the open sea

Like the thunder we strike who outrages our pride
Feel the cold raging wind blowing high on the sails
Our swords raised in fight, of the sea we're the knights
We are riding the wild waves of destiny

Rapacious eyes fix on the horizon
A wild shark seeking for preys
We're eager to hear the roar of the cannons
That blows the enemy away

Searching for gold we're back to the open sea

[Repeat chorus]

Never gave ear to the mendacious rulers
Outlaws! that is our brand
Daring our fate on the wings of the storm
Untamed we ride till the end

Searching for gold we're back to the open sea

[Repeat chorus]
