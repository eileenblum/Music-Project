Built in England in 1710, La Concorde was her name
300 tons of wood and steel, the frigate was ready to sail

Cruising through the Caribbean sea, there is no ship she could fear
The lookout screams, a flag on sight, a raging battle draws near
A mighty 30 guns man o' war, the Revenge could easily escape
But captain Teach was seeking for a chance to establish his name

Under the banner of piracy they fight!
Chasing for glory and freedom they shall die

Queen Anne's Revenge, the furious huntress is pounding the sea
Queen Anne's Revenge, avenging force sails proud to be free

The royal Scarborough starts the fire, getting close for the kill
The pirates stand in front of death, bravely facing its thrill
Board sides split the wooden planks, smoke is surrounding the scene
Blood red faces and dying screams, the fate of the weakest is sealed

Under the banner of piracy they fight!
Chasing for glory and freedom they shall die

Thunder and fire, bullets of lead
They bring the audacious men to death
Caught in wild fight into the storm
The gunners repeatedly shoot their load

The mariners cannot fight anymore
Defeated they try to withdraw
Teach's command has reached his goal
He takes the decision to let'em go away

The black flag raised in victory, honour was on the line
The captain's fame of bravery will clang till the end of all times

[Repeat chorus]
