Roaring, firewind blows 
Twisting the air, melting the stones 
Opened gates of hell 
A dark and dreadful spell 

The fallen god is here 
All living things are trembling with fear 
Evil hearts will burn 
No deal and no return 

He comes to steal your life away 
Gonna send your rotten soul to hell 
hell! 
hellblazer! 

Golden churches rise 
The mindless fools are feeding their lies 
Stealers, they claim the throne 
The truth is never shown 

Senseless wars of gain 
Self killing mankind struggles in pain 
Drowning down in flames 
Punished for his blames 

He comes to drive your mind insane 
Rampaging the world to raise some hell 
hell! 
hellblazer!
