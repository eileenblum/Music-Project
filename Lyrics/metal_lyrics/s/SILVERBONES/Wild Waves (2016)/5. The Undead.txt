The blackest nights have fallen, a cold wind fills the air
Walking down the empty streets, I fight my darkest fear
Rumors of an evil force awakened in the land
With knife and musket in my hands tonight I'll make my stand

Reflection of an ancient curse
That brought terror and pain
The greedy creature of the night
Has left his rest again

I'm rushing through the hamlet, the church is now in sight
Reaching the cemetery gate I find it open wide
Aware of something near to me, my torch lights up the dark
A black shape's lurking in the mist, I aim to shoot it down

Reflection of an ancient curse
That brought terror and pain
The greedy creature of the night
Has left his rest again

The undead
Has risen from his unholy grave
The undead
Is out for blood when the lights fade away

The crack was loud, the smoke is gone, the figure doesn't fall
A pale face keeps starring at me with eyes like living coals
Resurrected lord of night, his presence chilled my spine
Unstoppable he comes for me, I'm going to feel his bite

[Repeat chorus]
