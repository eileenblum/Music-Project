[Breaking through the crystal tide, hoisting up the flag of death ]
Sailors sworn to fight for freedom standing back to back
Daylightâs gone, night comes down and suddenly a ship appears
Load the cannons fast and be prepared for quick attack

They shall run for cover as weâre pounding the sea
We stand tight united as weâre riding the storm

Raiders of the new world
Terror from across the sea
Raiders of the new world
Whoa!

Hiding out in secret bays when our long journeys end
We keep accumulating gold and silver in our chests
Steal and kill is our way, brutal force the only law
We live and die by the sword like renegades at heart

They shall run for cover as weâre pounding the sea
We stand tight united as weâre riding the raging storm

They shall run for cover as weâre pounding the sea
We stand tight united as weâre riding the storm

Raiders of the new world
Terror from across the sea
Raiders of the new world
Whoa!

Surrender or fight!
