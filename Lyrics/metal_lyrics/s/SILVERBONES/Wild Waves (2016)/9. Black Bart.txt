Back in my old glorious days, weâve sailed the sea to hostile shores 
Captain Davis caught in trap was gunned down to his grave 
Tragic moment for us all, there was no other time to waste 
The new leader was elected then he took command 

Hail! Hail to 
Black Bart, skilled sailor born to be 
Black Bart, the ruthless devil of the sea 

Reluctant to piracy, he has been forced to join the crew 
Not a foolish common man, he prooved to be the best 
Planning out a blood revenge he gave the order to attack 
Saber, gun and cannon were prepared to giveâem hell 

Hail! Hail to 
Black Bart, skilled sailor born to be 
Black Bart, the ruthless devil of the sea 

After a week we sailed back to kill 
Governors had paid for their insolent trick 
Smoking ruins of the city were left 
The fire of anger has wiped it away 

Fulfilled our goal we got back to the ship 
Preparing ourself for the imminent trip 
Black Bart Knew it would come to an end 
Weâve followed him over the wild waves of destiny 

Strong willed and feared man, the last of his kind 
Bound to the sea and doomed to fade in history 

Hail! Hail to 
Black Bart, skilled sailor born to be 
Black Bart, the ruthless devil of the sea 
Black Bart, cleaver sailor born to lead 
Black Bart, the golden age of piracy
