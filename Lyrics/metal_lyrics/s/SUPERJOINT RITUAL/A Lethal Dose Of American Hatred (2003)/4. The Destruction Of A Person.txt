(you see) I had some friends once before,
whose not so much my friends anymore
I was very influential in their lives (so they say) , and when I lost my
Mind, they followed me though multiple deaths
[Chorus]
(Because) there we were on the floor, slumped over and
sliding downward, with syringes hanging out of our arms,
another night, anyway we could. I said TRUST ME
The Destruction of a Person builds character, invisible

Another group of so-called friends,
can't seem to get off the needle now again
Should I blame myself cause I introduced them to the devil?
Or realize the life in darkness and the lord of light
also works in mysterious ways.
