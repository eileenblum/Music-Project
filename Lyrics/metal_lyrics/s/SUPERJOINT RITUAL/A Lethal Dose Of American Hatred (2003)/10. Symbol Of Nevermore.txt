We'll never see, the light of Eyes, the twist of might, the
Loss of sight, contracted Gate, reward of hate, forgotten
Wisdom, the grinding flesh
My god beats the fuck out of your god
The father of plague, fallen from heaven
For war, the ultimate war, the ultimate transgression
Several times over, your safety compromised, the hated
Race, the simple Emotion.
