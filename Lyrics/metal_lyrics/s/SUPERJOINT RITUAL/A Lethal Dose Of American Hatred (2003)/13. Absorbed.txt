Reading what you write alone, the ever-present fucking phone,
Being what your not seeing, self centered in bad lighting
Near sighted to a fault, with every day a grain of salt
Rarely reliving it
Sculpting statues of yourself, empty brain and stolen wealth
Feeling sorry for yourself
[chorus]
Absorbed, in yourself, absorbed
Lowly creature, fighting vainly crumbling inward, no lights
Left to shine,
Absorbing will that's inside
Keep somewhat low until night
Then come back for more
Stay low
