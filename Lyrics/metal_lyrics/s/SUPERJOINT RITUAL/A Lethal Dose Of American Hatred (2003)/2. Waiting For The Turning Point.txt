Its inside, I felt it then, I feel it now, I feel it now
The turning point, waiting for it, a time bomb, I'm waiting for
the turning point, to lead my life from endless rage, to rip out
the page, expect the worst, you get the best, I'll wait out the rest,
the turning point. waiting. endless is waiting
It will be just for me, not her or him or them with hands out
Breaking free of the family, of the lawyers and the vampire
half wits - Waiting for the turning point...
Waiting for the turning point...
I'm waiting; I'm fucking waiting
Laid out, planned out, on my own it works out, frightful
desperate, unpredictably turns out. Desperate, frightful,
Laid out, planned out, on my own it works out, waiting for
the turning point to drive into me
