A blunt knife, kept out of sight, should be mandatory.
To end a life (that's) a waste of time, a murder in the making
Misunderstood, opposed to most, stock piling ammunition
Unplugged, media, and mass confusion,
that should keep us uninvolved
I'm asking, what you are asking, the pressure on you all
No balls, with out a soul, makes for no one,
You're a nobody; don't act like a somebody, like everybody.
A momma's boy, a fool's world,
no contribution, to a world ruled by ignorance
No drive
It's calling, it's falling, it's falling, it's falling on top of me
You broke your soul again.
You murdered your only friend., a speck in the
Atmosphere, killed and you'll never leave here
A Knife Rises up from hell
Come to my grave, and be saved, for I am the lord of the dad
Menstruated blood gives me live, awakened by occult abuse
