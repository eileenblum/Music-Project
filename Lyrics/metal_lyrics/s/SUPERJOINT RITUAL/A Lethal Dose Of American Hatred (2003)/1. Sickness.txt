Sweating, freezing, itching, bleeding, selfstyled, poison,
A Lethal meeting, face down, helpless in 48 hrs
SICKNESS
Revolting, distorting, and changing for worsend, no one will
recognize exactly whats wrong. You are denying and lying;
No truth - pull up - You've lost your old friends they'll never
return again, even when your senses return, again
Sickness, self desired, self assured, with staff infection
Nauseous and bloated, your best behind you now, irritate,
Amputate, four burning lines,
A blood coated ending to your life's story
SICKNESS
Paranoia, schizophrenia, resembling, a picture of disabled fear
the future is pestilence under your skin
SICKNESS
As gravity pulls you down and then under, the pain, it increases
with every step you're begging for the ending,
the dragon is sending you - messages from the frin reapers plans
Sweating, freezing, itching till bleeding, self styled poison
A lethal meeting, face down and helpless, terror engulfs us
The sickness that saves us is killing us now
