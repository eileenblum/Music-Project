Infamously marked by every generation known
Somehow they look like, the dicks from generations old -
But they're new!
[Chorus]
No one in here is trusted
To kill everyone is to love everyone, do what you can till your busted,
then keep the word, then keep the word...
*DRESS LIKE A TARGET*
Never to be trusted, to kill anyone is to love everyone,
Rise up and never be busted, so keep the word, so keep the word...
INFAMOUSLY
Infamously hated, kill every generation known, its stupid that
they look like, the generation fucking old, but they're new!
They're new because the media says so
They're new because the media likes it
They're new because the media sucks up
Grow your hair as long a a hippies
But we're not hippies
We're slippys!
Like the Manson family
Dress like a target, target us
With massive and sweating hands
Target us. 'Cause in your minds I'm afraid of you you don't exist
We're rising up
[Chorus]
