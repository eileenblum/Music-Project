Congregation hear this, know this, the time will come, when we must
Rise; we must be known. We're clearly heathens, not catholic, not
Christian, not communist, (we're) barbarians
and dangerous the absolute dark horse
Anti Jesus Christ, no more of the coward muhammeds, extermination of
The catholic guilty (thought suffocation),
taking no pity on the Jewish elitists
The calling, side ways, undetected, if might is truly right
Joint us, help us, create an army of to rival china, pagans,
Satanists, anarchists, and punks
A heathen's war lies up ahead.
