Incite the weak, prove tough, prove blunt
Bear gifts, that seize rewards - devout praise
Eradicate the will, deny resistance further
An undenying rhythm that's bad for it
I'll pass the bread I've poisoned with the hook worm

Drug your love

Restrain your hands, graft them to themselves
Piss high, down speed, the wisdom of the letch
Identified by the scars about the cock, balls, and ass
Make them kiss the bottom rung
Make them sorry for you and the fasting

Drug your love

So this is what it's grown into
It flowers, then it wraps around you
Eyes of Adam, teeth of Eve
It's natural in this progression
Spread your legs for your addiction
Spread your legs for your addiction...

...and be mystified

Mystified [x4]
