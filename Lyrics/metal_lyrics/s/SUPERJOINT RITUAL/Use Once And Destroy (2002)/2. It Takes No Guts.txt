There is no bright relation, refry this shitty life
Can you find it?  Can you feel it?  Can you hide it?  Can you fake it?
The promise of piss is here, and I've dug the filthy dredge
Can you find it?  Can you feel it?  Can you hide it?  Can you fake it?
There is no grace in waiting, there's only bastard baiting
Can you find it?  Can you feel it?  Can you hide it?  Can you fake it?

Raped by your father, where you hurt there?
Were you horny?  Were you horrified?

They were the first to revv up, they were the last to ride
Can you find it?  Can you feel it?  Can you hide it?  Can you fake it?

Taken by a blood relation-take that, love that
Given inches, given fortitude-take that, love that
Crying eyes, a man of forty-take that, love that
Taken back there, day to day
I feel, extreme, amped up

Kill the guilty
