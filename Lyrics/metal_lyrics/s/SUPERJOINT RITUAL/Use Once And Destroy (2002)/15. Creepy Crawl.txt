Countless hours, turning into, countless days
A doubtful outlook...

Digging from my grave, that's my home actually
Sick and angry for no reason
Falling into Manson's thrall...

Charlie's stare will draw you in
A god reborn? A total clown?
Now the truth...a five-six joke?
Or was he the one?
I can't change the exposed truth
God is gone, and never will, never was, never has been

Thoughts provoke, a disgusting sight
If this is real? Or a chemical life?

Digging from my grave, that's my home actually
Sick and angry for no reason
Falling into Manson's thrall...

Charlie's stare will draw you in
A god reborn? A total clown?
Now the truth...a five-six joke?
Or was he the one?
I can't change the exposed truth
God is gone, and never will, never was, never has been
