She's crap, she's scum - related to the gutter
She never looks behind her, for there sleeps ashen past

[chorus]
But it feels good, just like the way it should
The cord burns on and on and on and on...

Her mouth hangs wrong, cateract coloured eyes
She smells like gone from the give-up

[chorus]
But it feels good, just like the way it should
The cord burns on and on and on and on...

Ozena
Sex was meant to kill you

Lisp like a little kid, through split tongue seizures
sucking air sounds prevalent, it's a rebirth...

[chorus]
But it feels good, just like the way it should
The cord burns on and on and on and on...

Sex was meant to kill you
