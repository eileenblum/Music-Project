[Verse 1]
Follow long, lay that door.
I would kill, a pierce that priced me.
Slack in bed, slack and better.
Switch and clear, fill the void.[x2]

[Chorus]
Followed home, always fear.
Refill my prescription for Friday.

[Verse 2]
Follow long, lay that door.
I would kill, fill the void.

[Chorus]
Followed Home, always fear.
Refill my prescription for Friday.

[Verse 3]
What it is.
Fail on the outside,
and the great relief.
The ribbon on the half.

Dumb appolagy.
A Razor in your brain
A close missed attention,
For the road to mass creation.

Won, Dead.
