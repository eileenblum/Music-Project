Mind is a freeze, from me, from you, from shock
There is no sanctuary, I want to do you right now
Your blank look tells me, you're not to thrilled at all
To stand here face-to-face with me
You want to stab me, right now, not tomorrow
'Cause there's a fine line between me and them
Call it a rift

I can't just look you in the eye without just crying/laughing
I speak with death-threat tone...you and yours want to make a name
Pack it up and move on right now, no tomorrow
Can't take your best shot,
'Cause you're too chicken shit
You and yours want to make a name
Pack it up and move on right now
'Cause there's a fine line between me and them
Call it a...

I will decide

There's pressure, revolving, unloading, depreciated
Step on the foot of Excelcier, a net in the womb of the aftermath
The problem ahead is that "fine line" that keeps us apart
A fence there in the middle
Keeps us apart again
