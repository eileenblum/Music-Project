Celebrate your yellow eyes, no intention, self prevention
A horror tide, death for dead, borrowed time, a hallowed life
You're fucking dead...you're fucking dead

Hungry for the mother love, you instigate a situation
Half a head, half a body, baby rapist, dickless wonder
You're bought and sold, you're bought and sold

Crap full, not sure, my fears
The rain comes, like blood
Invented, for your amateur soul...

Kiss it goodbye
