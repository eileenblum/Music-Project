Through the beyond, the brain that creeps compulsion
Unrash decision, a battle pitched with lyric
Bastard world is swallowing and harvesting
A dense generation that's doomed to repeat over and over

[chorus]
Dischord, fear, psychosis, then the grave

Antifaith, a legion in the cerebellum
Kill the senses, dream of guilt, a blatant fraud
Abominations will maximize both death and danger

[chorus]
Dischord, fear, psychosis, then genocide

At one time, try it again and again
A grizzled down execution, your flesh at one with the dirt
No death king, no veil of martyrs, just red, raw, and gone
