Where were you?  When was it me?
A hollow paw, a quiet stare
Drain is slowly, the flow of birth
Eat the after(birth) and satiate the claw-rise

The dumb ones rise to salute the queer
Another dreary (outlook), people fearing
Dick the system, screw the city
Forget you were, forget you were
Die when you can do no more damage
