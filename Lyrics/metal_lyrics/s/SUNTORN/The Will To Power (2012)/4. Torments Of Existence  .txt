The animal depraved and led astray
Brainwashed to turn away from the face of nature
and feed the machine
You are the ever turning gear
shifting to keep the wheel rolling
Running like crazy just to stand still
Submit to the hand that feeds you
The man made god masked behind the cross
We've become so numb to the pains of existence
You've gone blind, stripped of your sense
numb to the pains of existence
Comfortable decaying in a pile of your own waste
