They abused it all
Left us dull with the urge to turn to stone
This flesh and bone has been separated
and detached from it's soul

Demons masked to keep in control
Empower the psychologically maimed sick man....

We all watch this world burn
Blindfolded by every dollar we earn
Until your home is burning it's not your concern

We dream all day in the Devil's playground
