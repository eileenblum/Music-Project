Submit humanity, scatter the roaches in the corners of the alleys
Flood streets with ignorance
Corrupt all that's innocent
Defile existence

What's the core of this ongoing problem?
That's the question
Open eyes see hope has shattered
All the answers....are carefully hidden deep inside
This....shell....nest

Fear filtered through your mind

Fear filtered through your mindÂ 
Shackled, can't unwind
Mechanical clockwork frames our time,
Becoming the countdown to our descent

We're slowly descending
Devolving with fear straight into submission

Humans drown in their own fears
Devolving and descending race
