Misery accumulating with every thought
Every day lived and every string pulled
is another fucking step towards suicide
Cultivating in the winter of my life
All that's been sodomized, laid to rest and victimized
in a world I'm leaving behind

The Sun condemned and hungÂ 
suspended to remind us of what is yet to fucking come
Don't dread the relief you can't escape
The pain will remind us of what is surely yet to come

In a world where there is nothing left for us to hang on to
but the dream and hate
Our minds have been crucifiedÂ
