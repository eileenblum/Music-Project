Swallowed and digested in the system

Fucking tired-defeated
Dwelling the lie of freedom

Existence isn't free so you fucking pay

Oppressing all the weak
Depression has reached us all
Oppressing all the weak - Oppression!
Oppressing all the weak
Depression has reached us all
Oppressing all the weak - Depression!

They keep your mind locked in a cage
Entrapping everything

They're the ones that stole knowledge belonging toÂ 
Mother Earth's youth
