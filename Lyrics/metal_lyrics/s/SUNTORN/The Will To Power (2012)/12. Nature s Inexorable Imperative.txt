[feat. Travis Ryan]Curious and cruel
Carried in an earthly womb
In the beginning you gave me life
and when time has had it's way
I will return to you
Once again we'll become one

Come down
My lungs are slashed, shred, and torn
I inhale all of your love,
and exhale all of humanity's shame

Give back to the nature
Give back to one's self

Come down
Once again we we'll become one

The Earth's our grave and nothing escapes it

The more humanity strays from it's origin
The more we deny our bond with nature

And when time has had it's way
I will return to you
Once again we'll become one

It will all end in the dirt again
Where the body will find peace and the mind can rest
I've been waiting too long to be dead
