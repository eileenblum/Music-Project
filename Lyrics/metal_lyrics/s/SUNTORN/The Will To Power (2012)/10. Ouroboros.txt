A destined triangle unified
Dreams entangled to be completed before we die
We've been brought forth to all go down in history

Keep ascending until we burn alive

Relieved of all sorrow
There's nothing to lose and peace to be found
I'm not looking towards tomorrow
The world is grey and the system is down
A Suntorn reflection of myself 6 feet deep in the ground

Keep ascending until we burn alive
