I have laid my misery to rest
In the soil, deep beneath the sands of time

Unraveling my nature in the presence of light

As the sorrow abandons this flesh of mine
I awake in a new form of life

Shedding negativity and cleansing my consciousness
A rising Phoenix among the ashes
Rebirth - my will to power

I have found my meaning in life
just as I was digging my grave
Engulfed in flames, the energy lives on

There is no end to this eternity
It's an endless cycle and this form of life is not the only one

My will to meaning
My will to truth
My will to survive
My will to power!

Extends into everlasting....

The face of Death shall only meet the flesh
There is no end....to this eternity....
