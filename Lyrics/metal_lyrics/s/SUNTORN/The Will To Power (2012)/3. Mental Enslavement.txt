Concealed misery starts the recourse of my depression
Kept alive by every single sick obsession

Nothing heals and nothing regenerates
in the state of mental enslavement

Demented and self-deceived
Pushing away from all I believed in myself to be
Imagination stretching wide as the sea
yet never reaching the Sun

Nothing heals - nothing regenerates

An abysmal perception unfolding among nature
consuming what's left of me

An abysmal perception unfolding among nature

Nothing heals and nothing regenerates
in the state of mental enslavement
