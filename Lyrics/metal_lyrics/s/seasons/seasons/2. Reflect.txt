the mirror shows images to me that don't exist
to which I bring my fists
so I sit and reflect

one time the sun set in my eyes 
and showed me the fire I built inside

you made me feel a little less alone
maybe if just for a while but it was never set in stone

maybe its meant to be
maybe this is for me
not letting go of anything

you made me hate the places I loved the most
so I'll just stay mad and never let go

my heart is racing steadily decreasing
