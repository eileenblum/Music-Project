we lie in paper boats
inviting the storm
bringing all our mates
to the ocean floor
we lie in words of rhyme
in hopes to someday find
our last chance or power inside

when your eyes meet mine
I feel a part inside me die
when your eyes meet mine
I die inside

say you won't forget me
to be alone this far down
say you won't forget me
it's the only thing i fear

cause everyday it feels like I'm the one out-numbered
and I won't be left at bay just like all the others were
I'm at the farthest depths
that you've never seen
raise the mast break out the oars
I won't lose this ship to the sea

say you won't forget me
to be alone this far down
say you won't forget me
it's the only thing I fear
