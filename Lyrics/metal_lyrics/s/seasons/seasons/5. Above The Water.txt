the wind will carry my words
and they will run by the dozens to heed my call

I dress this voice with purpose 
because it means so much to me

five years pass and here's my chance
so if you're falling under
keep your head above the water

sooner or later you will find
things will get so much better

why does this happen to me
my feelings you will not see
I keep them hidden deep inside of me

I fuckin hate this side of me
what did you help me create 
I will never be the same again

never the same again
