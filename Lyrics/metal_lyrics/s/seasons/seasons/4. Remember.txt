you make me regret many things
like giving you a second wing
why do people say "love is free"
love took the best part of me

I want to rip your heart to shreds
and make you take back the words you said
you say you're sorry 
I don't believe your words

in the end I hope you get what you deserve
buried six feet beneath the earth
