so the story goes
about a person who lost all hope
along with all the places that he could go
to find reassurance 
building bridges to nowhere

im chasing a memory saying "please erase me"

to me its dark outside
as dark as my insides
will ever, there be light
looks like not this time

say what you will but
mean what you say
stand behind your words
and make no mistake that
guys like me are few and far between
people like me are just what this world needs

crossing bridges 
hand in hand with
no one by my side
I know I'll die alone

I hate everything

and like a movie I've seen this all before

to me its dark outside
as dark as my insides
will ever, there be light
looks like not this time

I will fade out like the rest
I will fade unlike the best
