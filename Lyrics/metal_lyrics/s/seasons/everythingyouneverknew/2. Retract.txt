All the people that I've met
All the others they have left
Out of all the good things that I have
You're the one I'm glad I kept

But I wrote that line when I wanted you in my life
The things I've said and the places we've been
I want those memories erased from my head

I keep placing myself in these situations
It's happened three times before yet I keep on trying
I keep my head held high and they keep bashing me down
I keep my head high and they bash me

I keep placing myself in these situations
Sinking lower than the deepest of valleys
Finding myself in the darkest places

I've been in the dark so long that it feels like home
And I've come to realize I was born to be alone
To be alone
To be alone

Thick skin worn thin, I don't want to change
Thick skin worn thin, I just want to be appreciated

They say there'll be better days ahead
They say there'll be better days ahead

All the people that I've met
All the others they have left
Out of all the good things that I have
You're the one I'm glad I kept

I thought I made the right decision by keeping you around
But the moment I need you most you were nowhere
Nowhere to be found
