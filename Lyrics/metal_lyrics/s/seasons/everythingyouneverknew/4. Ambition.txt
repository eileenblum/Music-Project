What drives you to wake up everyday
With the same face, in the same place
And nothing ever changes
What drives you to wake up everyday
With the same face, in the same place
And nothing ever changes

And nothing ever changes
My life is on repeat
Every second, every moment
Time is my
Time is my only friend

What drives you to wake up everyday
With the same face, in the same place
And nothing ever changes

Time spent well is time spent sleeping
And what hope do I have
To wake up and still be breathing
Oh what aspirations
Time is my
Time is my only friend

If I died right now I'd have nothing to show for my life
My harsh thinking left me in the dark
This disease spread through the night
And there's nothing I can do

There's nothing I can do
I'm going nowhere in life
I need someone just to me breathe
Why am I
Why am I alive

I've got time
I've got time to spare
I've got time

I find shelter in the darkest places
And it's keeping me
And it's keeping me from sleep

I find shelter in the darkest places
And it's keeping me
And it's keeping me from sleep
