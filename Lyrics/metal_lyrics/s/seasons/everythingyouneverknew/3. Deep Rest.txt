Somewhere between the dark and the light
I lost what I thought was my point in life - and now
I need direction, a place to call home
Instead of feeling like I am a ghost, I don't exist
The days repeat and never change
And what difference will I ever make

What difference will I make
What difference will I make
With the changes that take place
Where do I stand
Where am I at
And how long will this last

The words I spill will never contain
Exactly how or why I feel this way
I will not share with you, what's wrong with me
Because you'd never understand anyway

Will you be the change that I need
Will you be the change that I need
Please affect me in any way
Please affect me in any way

At this point in my life I've found that I have nothing that I see
This is wasted time

Where has the time gone
All I ever seem to do is run
Bury me beneath the sun
With all that I've done wrong

Where has the time gone
All I ever seem to do is run
Bury me beneath the sun
With all that I've done wrong

Bury me beneath the sun
With all that I've done wrong
