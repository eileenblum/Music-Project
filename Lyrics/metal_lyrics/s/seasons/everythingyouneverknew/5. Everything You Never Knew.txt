As we near the end
We regret all we did
What did we do
With all the time we spent

For those like me
This is my song for you
And if you feel this way
Then I feel for you

Why despise the one thing I'm good at
Closing doors, shutting them out
You never stood a chance
Someone should have warned you
You never stood a chance

I don't belong here
I don't belong anywhere
I should just go back
To the place I came from
Just leave me be

Feeling the pressure
Wanting to be accepted
I may stand out but I go unnoticed

I don't belong here
I don't belong anywhere
I should just go back
To the place I came from
Just leave me be

No one accepts me
And no one deserves me
I don't wanna change
I'll hold your grudge til the end
I wish we never met
So many things I regret
But mostly you

The words you choke are burning your throat
You lies will never get you anywhere
Take a look at what you did

I don't belong here
I don't belong anywhere

As we near the end
We regret all we did
What did we do
With all the time we spent
