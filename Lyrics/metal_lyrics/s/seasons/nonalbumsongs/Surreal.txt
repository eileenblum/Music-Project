Of all things sought after to be great
My motivation
fueled by hate
Some things will never change
And some
things will never be the same
Choose your words
And how
far you will move

I will lead this room of shattered men
Cover their scars and their tattered skin
Once healed
and twice beaten

Life is a dead end
I have no
direction
Its not how I planned it
Its not how I planned it
its not how I planned it to be

Through my chest you
can see the carnage
My views always too harsh to harness

the things I see, the way I feel
it's all to me, so
surreal [x2]
