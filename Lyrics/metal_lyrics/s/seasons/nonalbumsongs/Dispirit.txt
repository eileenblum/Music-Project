[feat. Nick (Of Virtue)]

Wake up to pictures of where I was left
Take your time
I'm in no rush
Take your time I've nowhere to
run

On my back I lay the only bed I made
The only
place that's, MINE

I don't like being this
way
Something has taken over me
Taken, over me
I swear
it's not me, I swear it's not

something has
taken over me
and I swear to you its not me
taken, over
me
I swear its not me
I swear its not

[Nick (Of Virtue)]
I held this denial so close to my heart,
That I
actually started to believe
That there was something
better inside of me.
But I have found nothing. 
I have
found nothing
And I might never find anything

I have
learned the hard way
life will never turn out the way you
want it to be
alone again just like I've always
been
alone at dawn

[Nick (Of Virtue)]
I know I
wasn't born like this
[Trevor (Seasons)]
I don't
feel like I even exist
[Nick (Of Virtue)]
Was it me or the
world that beat me down to this
[Trevor (Seasons)]
Cause I
have nothing but scars on my bloody fists

I'm
depressed, lonely
My head aches I haven't slept in
days
To each their poison
And every release
