[Lyrics: Meth Roid, music: Surviving In A World]

you keep on suffering fool, keep on lying and faking under roof,
god won't be mocked, don't lie yourself, your life is falling through the groove.

I've been in darkness through this phase
was the yesterday like a long nightmare
I'm looking the mirror, looking the mirror
I'm seeing in the mirror who's got the blame

sober, be sober, get sober, yeah!
sober, be sober, get sober, now!

'cause every tree therefore that doesn't give fruit will be cut,
and will burn, set in fire now, like your sins uncover you as a liar

Threw this tunnel I found the light,
to explode words from bottom of my heart
I'm looking the mirror, looking the mirror
I'm seeing in the mirror who's got the blame

sober, be sober, get sober, yeah!
sober, be sober, get sober, now!

Spoken voice
actually fighting the shadows of blindness
we fall in tragedy of world's lies
look yourself, realize be sober,
freezed were my words on the past, I couldn't break this lost at last
