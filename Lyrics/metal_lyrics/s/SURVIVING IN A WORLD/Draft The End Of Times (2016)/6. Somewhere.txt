Somewhere the light shines.!

we're generation forged with fire,
today is our day,
when somewhere the sun shine more
through this darkest tunnel

somewhere the night will be starry,
starry as before
we're still waiting for truth,
from savior sun...

somewhere the truth we-can-realize
still through this doomsday
blinded eyes are opened wide
reaping what you've sown

no tomorrow eclipsing the sun
ascending electrified
ending finally has be gun
reaping what you've sown

millions of men, women and children, they lost their lives
some of us we refuse to kneel and die.
Some of us refuse to accept,their superficial apologies
when really we can realize and open wide our eyes

Now it's time to open your eyes
where somewhere light shines.

To go through the darkness use me god as a light
I know we're not angels, but we're able to fight damnation
