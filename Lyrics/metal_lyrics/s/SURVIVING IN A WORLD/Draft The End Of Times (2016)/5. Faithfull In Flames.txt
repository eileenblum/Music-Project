[Lyrics: Meth Roid, music: Surviving In A World]

why... from the dark side of mankind, god has been to their side forgiving
broken wings of faithful in flames

completely broken through this maze, while I remember the falling away
deleted and identified in the floor, screwed through the ground with no sun

'cause from the collapsed walls, the hunger hides
'cause from the poisoned hills, faithful is ashamed
'cause from dangerous caves, the tortured is blind
'cause in horrible days the believer is flames... is in f lames

aching all over, longing on for salvation
i can see tragic visions at the future
running paths of drowning sorrow
captivity from evil's eyeâ¦

always remember why you did it

faithful, remember, sacrificing

'cause from the collapsed walls, the hunger hides
'cause from the poisoned hills, faithful is ashamed
'cause from dangerous caves, the tortured is blind
'cause in horrible days the believer is in flames... is in flames
