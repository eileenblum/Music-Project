still we're sliding through the spiral, as should never be
this time decay is a cloud that fall down to kill slowly
nature today isn't merciful, we've sown earth,
now we're slaves, looking back to memories

let me hold your hand today if you still think that someday we'll be safe
("let me hold your hand now, if you still think, we'll reborn in his name" )
the feeble life into the storm,the faithful was screwed through the floor
the nature was raped again, the word was blasphemed again

storm begins to erase falling angels, just hold me now to be safe
I'm feeling the pain inside of survival, just hold me now to be safe

maybe we've to stay hidden And not receive the fruit of land,
but never you will sell soul although not survive, we belong from lightâ¦

let me hold your hand today if you still think that someday we'll be safe
(let me hold your hand now, if you still think, we'll reborn in his name)
the feeble life into the storm,the faithful was screwed through the floor
the nature was raped again, the word was blasphemed again

storm begins to erase falling angels, just hold me now to be safe
I'm feeling the pain inside of survival, just hold me now to be safe

on this time of the dragon ego,
time of lies and the hunger,
times of the apostasy and selfishness
still we're surviving against this...

then begin to fade all my hopes, when I begin to breath
Storm begins to erase fallen angels, just hold me now to be safe

storm begins to erase falling angels, just hold me now to be safe
I'm feeling the pain inside of survival, just hold me now to be safe
