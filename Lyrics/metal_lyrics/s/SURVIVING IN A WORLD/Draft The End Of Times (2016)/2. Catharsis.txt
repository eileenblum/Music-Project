his sweat was like blood drops falling down to earth, my soul is very sorrowful even unto death, and says abba father all things are possible unto thee...
'cause who wants save his life he will loose it, and who lose his life by my cause, he will find it!

cold, resistance, dueling
is all I could resist, but the gray cloud never leaves
anxiety, disturbance, swallowing of...
everything that pollutes me, and fills me with... unholy

(while) The abrupt renaissance of evil, remains in planet earth
all who we are faithful we'll give a welcome to sacrifice
don't be easily to move your mind, to not get into sin, to never sell our souls, never the mark of evil...

blankness, captive, faithfulness
I don't want see it, the falling walls between us
deception, an innocent, persecution
here I stand to pay with blood, I find myself fighting...(while)

(while) The abrupt rebirth of evil, it remains in planet earth
all who we are faithful we'll give a welcome to sacrifice
don't be easily to move your mind, to not get into sin, to never sell our souls,
that no one deceive you in anyway!...

...don't be easily to move your mind, to not get into sin,
to never sell our souls, never the mark of evil... never!...
