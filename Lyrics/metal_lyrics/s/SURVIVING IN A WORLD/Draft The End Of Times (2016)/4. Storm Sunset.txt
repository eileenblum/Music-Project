I washed now my skin with flames.
polluted for nasty mud.
created by pain and the world hate.
where evil creeps all to underworld.

but without consciousness.
I was created to fight this.
and lord has giving me vision just dreaming, one at one the revelation.

I'm been pushed through the fire,
I've been guilty to believe.
falling down in silence,
this anguish is the longer we've to wait.
we're waiting for holy fire,
understand what is his will.
come now, we need it,
this anguish is the longer we've to wait.

so the entire mankind,who groans between chains,
doesn't understand all truly words of one who died on the cross.

Fearless we must to go at war.
'Til first one and last one forever
Seals asking avenging our blood.
Flame burning holy fury through the stormâ¦

Fight the snakeâ¦ fight, fight, fight the snake through the storm!

I'm been pushed through the fire, I've been guilty to believe.
falling down in silence, this anguish is the longer we've to wait.

we're waiting for holy fire, understand what is his will.
come now, we need it, this anguish is the longer we've to wait.
