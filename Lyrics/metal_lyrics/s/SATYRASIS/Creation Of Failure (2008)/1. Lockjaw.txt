Disguised in oblivion, justice denied
Stock holders control the intelligent life
Freedom of speech, under Dominion

No cure insight for the vicious disease
Fear breeding silence, the moral misdeeds

Defining morality
A judgement of hypocrisy
Shroud motives in secrecy
The new demise of liberty

Constitutional sodomy, the powers unite
Homogenized commentary, the left and the right
Rape of our system - our backs always turned
The power of money - our lesson learned

Fuck all your rules to silence our lives
You're slitting our throats with star spangled knives
Commission so righteous - A boardroom conception
Censored by the callous deception
Decisions made beyond our control
Lies, the story forever untold
Destruction of truth - Blurred by greed
Conformist Ideal have planted their seed

Freedom's despair dwells in our minds
They've trampled our right with stickers and fines
Kept in the dark we search for he light
Mouths sewn shut - Jaws locked tight
