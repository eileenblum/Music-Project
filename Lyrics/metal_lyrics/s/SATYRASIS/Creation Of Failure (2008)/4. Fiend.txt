Woe is my life - Forever draped in night
The dragon's thirst, my curse
Despised by all is my downfall
I'm inhumanity at its worst
After dusk fades - my life betrayed
A scourge of god awaits
Blood of hte living slurped unforgiving
This casket dwellers fate

Born into darkness - Living for death
Amongst the shadows, where torment rests
Carnivorous thirst, draining mankind
Thy wretched nightmare poisons your mind
The fluid feast - strengthen the wicked
Nocturnal breathren thrive in the sickness
Burning forever - No ashes will fall
Driven to kill - I'll feed on you all

Centuries old - my story told
Portray the vile beast
The man I was had mortal flaws
Now guiltily I feast
Lonesome I walk - The fools I stalk
Forget that we remain
More human blood drips down my tongue
Prolong our violent reign

Let the blackened blood
Boil in my veins
Shroud my mind in hatred
Erase the stabbing pain
Wash away my failures
Create a demon true
Invoke the hellish monster
Let my plague ensue

Moonlight shines on cold dead skin
I feel the hunger rise from within
Wanting her beauty, needing her being
Ingesting her life - An unholy feeding
Glistening fangs enter her flesh
Sweet virgin blood - Despicably blessed
One crimson kiss - Destiny now secure
Immortal she lives - Alluring soul made impure

Union most foul - Spitefully bound
Two fallen souls enslaved
Lusting to crave
Together in grave
Our vicious curse embraced
