Hunger open eyes
Muscles sore and weak
Needles strewn upon the floor
Silence roars defeat
Wander through the urban mist
Screaming up my lungs
Sickness spills into the streets
I gasp and bite my tongue 

Weaving through the alleyways 
the wolves begin to chase
Vicious scores of raving mad seek human flesh to taste 
Eons starved of carnage
Beneath the boiling stars
Released upon the masses
Bearing grievous harm

Chaos fills the cities
Plague begins to thrive
Modern man returns to beast
Kill to stay alive

Revelations Prophesied
Hell unfold before my eyes 

Solace found in company 
A void of trust and apathy
Forced upon these desperate souls - fighting to survive
Imprisoned by the bloodthirsty
Await attack now constantly
Prayers for help in any form - on deaf ears they fall
Lost among the rotting ones
Humanity a setting sun
Listless hearts slay en masse - those who would consume
Splitting skin with dulling blades
Shattered skulls vomit brains
Faced with death as seconds pass - clinging to my gun 

Spit in the face of God
Promised future's grave slowly dug
Remnants of decadence
Lay twisted, soaking with blood
Erased by Evolution
To the viral beast, slowly fed
Arrogant few left to wander
Empires of the Walking Dead
