Thoughts of death beseige the mind
Reality the most rotten kind
I fight the need to give up every day
To fund the debts I'll never repay
Day and night blur into one
Meaningless, I lay here numb
Remind myself of why I'm here
Then mourn the death of all I hold dear

Turn the hourglass over again
I hear death calling 'round the bend
Buried by the falling sand
Because Time's all you ever had

Denial slowly gets us by
Reminds us all the paths we've tried
Pretend meaning gives life purpose
Then back to nothing, He returns us

Dead to you
Dead to me
I'm all I'll
Ever be
Fuck this life
Fuck this world
Reduced to dust
God's will unfurled
Ignorant bliss
We're running blind
Deception's course
Run through my mind
The fate ahead
Plauges mankind
Together we suffer
His plan divine

Time creeps up with a killer's intent
Can't help but wonder where the days went
Alone you wait - the coffin calls
Close the book on a life so small
