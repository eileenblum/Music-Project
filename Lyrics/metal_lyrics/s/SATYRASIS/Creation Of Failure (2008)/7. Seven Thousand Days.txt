Midnight whispers fade into fear
Terrified of what will be
Visions of the end pulse in my head
A desolate future I'll never see
The barren waste that is my life
Before me collapses
A living, decaying corpse
Now present in my abscence

Crying out to the sky
Empty soul in an emptier world
One more day to get by
Pretending life has a meaning for me
Seems the harder I try
The more dreams slowly slip from my grasp
Losing the race against time
Buried alive, corroding within

Seven thousand days I've bled
The crimson trail of nothing
My rotting heart sliced open
Filling the grail of regret

Each day I feel all hope is lost
Drowned in Time's abyss
Grave mistakes devour light
Serve my time in darkness
In idle hands my devil's conceived
A stagnant pool of waste
Fingers point beyond the man
Inside a soul disgraced

I don't want to be forgotten
And I don't want to die alone
I wish that I could go to heaven
But I know I probably won't
I know that I can't live forever
So until that fatal breath
I just can't help wonder
Is there more to life than death

Tearful, I wait for the thief in the night
A lonely, black death, my epitaph trite
Erase from the record no more will I be
This body will rot, now nothing is me
