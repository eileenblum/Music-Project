I can't escape this prison of contempt
Desperate people with malicious intent
Try to move forward - all the bridges are burned
Too many problems but no one is concerned

I can't do this anymore
My heart is heavy and my brain is sore
I'm tired of trying and all I can see
Is a blackened sun staring back at me

The pain of life has drained me
Beyond all that I am
Nothingness will consume me
World falls apart in my hands

Forget about living - Hands always tied
Everyday I think mass homicide
The stench of the earth withers my life
Collective humanity causes nothing but strife

This gauntlet we run mangles our head
Makes us think we're better off dead
But no matter what, I'm not going to quit
Because I hate my life and everything in it
