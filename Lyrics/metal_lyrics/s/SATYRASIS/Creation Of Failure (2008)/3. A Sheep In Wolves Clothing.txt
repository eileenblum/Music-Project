Bask in the beauty of wrath unspoiled
The strike of a snake once quiet and coiled
Every minute you live takes something from me
Now I'm happy, watching you bleed
A joyless being, forever wasting your days
Delusional part you were destined to play
Treading upon those closest and dear
Dissolving the love you unconsciously fear 

Infamous in your own mind
Misery is all I hope you will find
Withered inside - Sorrow withholding
You're just a sheep in wolves' clothing 

Friend means nothing to the selfish and cruel
Lost in your games, always playing the fool
The face you wear depends on the person you're with
Lay waste to the man to build up the myth 

A life of nothing you destined to spend
Defaulted design, the means to an end
Ignore reality, savor the past
Forget the weakness, your judgment's been cast
