a boy alone, so far from home,
endless rooftops from my window.
I felt the gloom of empty rooms
on rainy afternoons.
sometimes, in confusion,
I felt so lost and disillusioned,
innocence gave me confidence
to go up against reality.

all the same, we take our chances,
laughed at by time,
tricked by circumstances.
plus ca change,
plus c'est la meme chose.
the more that things change,
the more they stay the same.

now I've gained some understanding
of the only world that we see.
things that I once dreamed of
have become reality.
these walls that still surround me
still contain the same old me,
just one more who's searching for
a world that ought to be.
