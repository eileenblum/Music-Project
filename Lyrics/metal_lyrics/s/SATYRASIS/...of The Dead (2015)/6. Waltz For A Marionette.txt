return me to the gaze,
inspired and profane.
ideal face remains,
subdued by whims in chains.

take me from this place my dear
this mattress stained,
walls cracked and bare.
to lessons wrought with ecstasy,
a carnal sense nearer to thee.

constructed from a farce
beautifully lined with vacant hearts
poisoned by your beauty still
desire bathed in lupine swill.

I watched the dream turn to dust,
waited for the smoke to clear.
I never cared for that good girl much,
or smile you've been forced to wear.

obsess, regress
the path of gorgeous stains.
infest, abscess
plant seeds of rot in the brain.

confess, detest
epitomize the loathing beneath.
possess, deflesh
it is you, to myself I will keep.
the scent of sex intoxicates,
instants play you false.
through the cloth
you gasp for breath,
synapses turn to salt.
never thought we'd meet like this,
but I guess what's done is done.
the time has come for you to watch,
while I have all the fun.

welcome to your tomb my dear.
a mattress stained
with blood and tears.
lessons learned in agony.
marionette, I feast on thee.
