drained of all your meaning
virtue laid out in wake
modern serfdom propagated
workers stare with blinkered eyes
tacit subterfuge abysmal
shameless corporate profiteers
worth that's taken from you
lucre from the lowest man.

gleaning monies exponential
slaves of service, peasants dead
locked in greed subsistence
cash from death seems quite alright.
no right god to pray to
greenback idols fill the void
kill before the market leaves you
gild your scalps for all to see.

domineering, parasitic
scheming rich men live to take
grovel for the crumbs they give you
thank them for the chance to eat.
