heritage dooms another lot,
more history repeats.
the plight of man,
destroyed by men,
old instinct buried deep.
snuff the world at moment's thought,
the worth of life, opaque.
bayonet the conscious eye,
load all the treasure
you can take.

certain death awaits the ones
too slow to comprehend
that taking life, is right of birth,
whatever means do end.
when left to his devices,
man's no different from a beast,
whores for war, the killing tour,
where blood must matter least.

can glory claim,
such death in vain,
and like territories conquer?
those who seek to give the meek
existence without honor
burn the nerves of men who serve
distortion of the true.
violence spurred by useless worms
feed many to the few.

a segment of the phalanx,
a bowman's aiming eye,
cannon fodder dreamers,
contently born to die.
the musket ball retrievals,
and trench floor serenades.
kill the very part of us
we think we fight to save.

will glory claim all life in vain
defined by bitter nations?
those who strive to see men die
in civilized cessation.
hasten deaths to minuettes,
the Valkyrie's refrain.
placing bets with life and death,
we, choosers of the slain.
