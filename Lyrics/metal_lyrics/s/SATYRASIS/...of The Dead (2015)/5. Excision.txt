soaking in idolatry,
thrown upon the stage.
acting parts that never work,
just seem to fit the age.
recreation had its place,
when times lacked consequence.
infernal schemes
for drowning dreams
are primed with arrogance.

never will I wonder
what it's like to die.
mired in the woes of man,
too blind to be denied.
seduced by premonition,
an evil held so nigh.
another slave of substance,
essence priced to buy.

I've done my mother's
heart no good,
with sordid acquisitions.
a faulty cast,
entrenched in past
societal demolitions.
confined at times,
by hopeless lines,
dividing man from malice.
embracing all that shouldnât be,
find my arms have calloused.

another slave of substance,
essence priced to buy.
funny that I never wondered,
what it's like to die.
seduced by premonition,
an evil held so nigh.
too mired in the woes of man,
too blind to be denied.

lately, I have wondered
what it's like to die.
freedom from the woes of man,
a vision from outside.
seduced by only nothing,
the fear that's held so nigh.
a casualty of substance,
the peace you cannot buy.

gangrenous body and soul,
heart scarred from elation.
lie there rotting on the couch,
deadened by sensation.
paralyzed in static white,
flickered television.
succumbing to the lack of feel,
no lonelier excision.
