generations intersect,
force fed their own demise.
divide the worth, among the starved,
gorge upon the scythe.
demons flow through aged abode,
decrepit conscious home.
foundations set in concrete wet,
ground from babies' bones.

drain the contents of the skulls
with structure and possession.
the working hearts and rugged backs
lined up without question.
a righteous task, to give what's asked,
an ignorance so splendid.
dig two graves, with the will you've saved,
live a life that's ended.

lured by the promise of nothing
impaled on the spike of time

tried to defy, know reasons why,
the luck's always the same.
set out to show, make others know,
there's pleasure in the pain.
depths of mind, no truth is kind,
the laughter in your face.
drains the will, you're nothing still,
a bitter old disgrace.

dreading eyes in a dirtied mirror,
begging to relent.
the wealth of wisdom cherished so,
now is nearly spent.
what use is this, the gift of sight,
with nothing left to see?
squandered all that brought us here,
the book's too long to read.
