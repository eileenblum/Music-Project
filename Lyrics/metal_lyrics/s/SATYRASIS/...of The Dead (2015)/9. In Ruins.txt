in times of fashioned chaste,
silver raced towards the sky.
machines controlled our fate.
the wise don't question why.
temptation led to promise.
create the class of need.
consume to live, in fear of life,
bite not the hand that feeds.
short years to decades turn.
baptized in swamps of greed.
through grandeur's haze, we stumble on,
blighted paths that house our dreams.
forgone are the senescent ways,
figments of judgment collapsed.
nothing left but recognitive waste,
heirs to a legacy scrapped.
