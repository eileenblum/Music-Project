scholars lost in matters grey
adhere to scripture's law.
elated by the tendency
to see a man do wrong.
redundant studies paralyze
narrow foresight reigns,
when those who crave
to rape and kill are
slaves to human brains.

standing at the precipice
to feel the piercing thrill.
knowing that you couldn't stop
if you possessed the will.
murder for the joy of blood
and ease of simple gain.
craven opportunal lust,
a portrait of the sane.

atonement for the scum within
surrender those who'll do you in.
drawn into the sacrifice
bleeding out on the altar of vice.

jesters prance around the court
leaving dignity in tatters.
their foolish kings are set to judge
invoke a justice shattered.
solitude, my enemy
how cunning you've become.
closing cell doors rack my thoughts
my will, a knot undone.
daggered stares subsuming time
cycloptic slumber fate.
iniquity consuming me
the lightning surely waits.
theories suspect, conjured blind
beg to be impugned.
burden of my conscious mind
bleeding like his wounds.
standing on the cliffs again
in truth's abyss I plunge.
perverse the joke pulled on us all
own the guts I spill, for once.
