Life has grown stale
I can't relate
It's just futile
Why continue?
I contribute nothing
Will not be a part
Zero to be gained
I just can't be fucked
Just cast me out
I contribute nothing
Will not be a part
Zero to be gained
I just can't be fucked
I hate your twisted games
You're all fucking sick
I just want out
I'm not built for it
Won't have a bar of it
I will not compete
Keep your pissing contest
Just cast me out
