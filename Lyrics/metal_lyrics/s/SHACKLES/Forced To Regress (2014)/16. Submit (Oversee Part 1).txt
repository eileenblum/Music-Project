You're just a cog
You'll always be a
Slave to them
You're just a droid
Your just a pawn
You're just a cog
You think you serve your own will
But you only ever serve theirs
False sense of accomplishment
Unfounded sense of pride
Deluded thinking
You are free while your hands are tied
Time to be broken down
Just submit
Just give in
