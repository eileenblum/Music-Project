No ones watching
No one cares
No ones invested in your life
Cease now or struggle on, out come is always the same.
Don't me misled- the world will spin without you
Don't me misled- time will forget you
Don't me misled- your exploits will die with you
Don't me misled- it's only you who thinks you matter
No one cares
No ones invested in your life
