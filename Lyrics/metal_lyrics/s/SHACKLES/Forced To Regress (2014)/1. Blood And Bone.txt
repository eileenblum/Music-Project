You're dull as fuck
Just breezing by
You're dull as fuck
Proud of your life
Useless as a human being
Found
A purpose decomposing
A sharp stab
Spilling out
Hacked to chunks
Then ground down
Turned to mulch
(A) compost heap
The soil
(You) fertilise
Useless as a human being
Found a purpose decomposing
You're useful as last
Far more useful dead
