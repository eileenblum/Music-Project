They come in droves
There's hordes of them
Human Waste- I'm surrounded
Human Waste-Dirtying my spectrum
They come in droves
There's hordes of them
Human Scum- (I'm ) inundated
Human Scum-There's no escape
They won't stop breathing down my throat.
They won't cease
Can't shut them out
They'll never relinquish
