restless hour lay awake
I sense that there is more
curse of death hangs over me
I can't rest here no more

circle of five
defying the night
thunderous sound
at the unholy seance

blistered eyes has no disguise
bears witness to my fate
golden morning helps me thru
but may have come too late

burning up the midnight oil
it has to be complete
early hour ritual
preform the darkened deeds

roaming thru the old graveyards
I find parts I can use
brush away the blackened soil
the birth of something new

circle of five
defying the night
thunderous sound
now shaking the ground
night comes to dawn
born evil spawn
the unholy seance - shall gather again
