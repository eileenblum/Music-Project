chopped up and desecrated
severed and mutilated
bonegrinding and deathmachine
skinpeeled and left to bleed

skinless swim in gasoline
I crave the pain so sweet
chewing glass into a mash
I am but bleeding meat

I sold my soul
lying here with no control
reeking stench from innerwounds
death - can't come too soon

tied down and lacerated
slowly incinerated
pierced by a million nails
pounding the hammer hails
needles hacked into my limbs
I cannot think at all
screaming silence deafens me
how long shall this go on

rid my scourge
hallow core
all ripped up and torn
reduced to puss and gore
