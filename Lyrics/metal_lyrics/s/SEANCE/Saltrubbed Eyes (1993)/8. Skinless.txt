rise - satan
in the name of God
I regret my wrong doings
I shall confess it all

purify my actions
the innocence of sins
healing helpless victims
tearing skin from limb
I am the saviour
the messenger of God
promised to dine with Jesus
when my deed is done

you will be born
skinless
the price I pay to be reborn
holy - deed of scorn

bleed - slowly
caressed by the blade
close your eyes forever
don't be afraid

the child of Jesus Christ
will only live to die
send him to go beyond
join him when all my time is gone

in my own soul death now roam free
laceration my only need
holy orders guide to thee I now descend

holy absolution
wash my soul to white
I'll give you retribution
last minute confirmation
