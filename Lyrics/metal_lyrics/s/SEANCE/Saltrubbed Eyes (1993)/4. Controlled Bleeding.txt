summon your darkness, evil alone
with hate avoiding the light
abandon all the doctrines of christ
bloodshed on the altarstone
make my way thru masses of death
fear not, I welcome his lies
embrace him with a brotherly kiss
then send him on a journey thru time

sire - so old this
lie - my holy
life - I now despise heaven
burns - of hate and
pain - obey in
sane - controlled bleeding

gather around the young ones now
and lead them to insanity
caress their minds with the evil eye
and mark them for infinity

I believe in my bleeding-flow
set aside life's real meaning-bow

I close my eyes - blind
unseen, undisguised

dead dreams fly - thru out my mind
on wings - made out of pain and fear
enter my soul - oh Lord of flees

at last, I stand with blood on my hands
burning steaming hot
my laughter shatters the serentic air
as I follow him to meet my God
