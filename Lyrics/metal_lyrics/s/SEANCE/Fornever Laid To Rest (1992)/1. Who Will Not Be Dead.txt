Alone - I have been left
Contamination
Fear - of what's to wait
Global hesitation
My time is over - I'll breathe my final breath
Lying skinnaken - in the shadow of death
Who among us - believe in gods creation
So why do I cry - there is no salvation

Blind - you must be blind
Denying facts of fear
Time - you've seen the signs
Massdeath within years
Tied to lifesupport - the cables unwind
I'm living on time - that was never mine
Hard to think - thoughts they drown
Panic screams in my head - as drugs pull me down

I meet my doom - soon will I lay
In my tomb - oh join me pray

Lord in the sky - can't hear my cry
There's no god - alone I die

Dead - I will be dead
Tears roll down my face
Saved - who will be saved
Erased without a trace
My skin starts to peel - face to deform
Lungs ripped by cough - calm before this storm
Sadly you don't care - for me in this bed
But my name is yours - for who will not be dead
