Finale hour you will pay - for your love to mystics
Trembling, you kiss - your carved crucifix
This day will witness my unholy death
I smell the whispering angel's breath
Cold - feel - numb
Lord - where are thou

Blinded by the visions - why have thy come
Floating in the twilight of life and death

The unknown is rising and your faith starts to break
Denying you cry - for your salvation
This night will witness my spirit float
Oh yes, I have kissed the goat

Death - has won
God - begone

Float - levitized spirit - leave the corpse's bed
Sense - vaguely - graveclothes
In shreds haunted

I wish I'd never come here
The dead should be left in peace
