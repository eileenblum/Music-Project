Be thy will,
O mighty god of the earth, sky and sea
Risen have I, from below
And come forth unto thee

Undead resurrection dawns
Awake the slumbering powers calm
I rise up from hell

Darkened night, the barrid wastelands
Shake by my second birth
Circles meet, I am the one spoken of
In the ancient curse

Stars - falling down
The sun and moon now meet as one
Water - changing form
Like knifes of blood cut through land and stone

I, the lost son have
Willingly sold my souls to
Baal, the conqueror of
The weaker gods

Fade, shall the holy ghost
Disappear into the
Void, of forgotten gods
As the ancient ones laugh
Tear, angels from the sky
Fall burning as other
Wings, fill the flaming horizon

Ancient ones,
I have brought forth once forgotten pain
Dead silence, in the land of no dawn
I shall reign

Forfilled the prophecies of baal
Awake are the slumbering powers strong
