Burn, fire, burn - cleanse this place with flames
I despise thy faithful lie - alone you will live in shame
Tears fill my dying eyes - for innocence is what I seek
And I hear your soul sing - as you betray the meek
Weakness for flesh you claim another gain

Reincarnage

You follow the filthy path - blinded by thy lust
In state of fatal lunacy - you rape my sacred trust
Your hearts stained by evil - a spiral of lies
And you cry out to me - "Sigh, oh lord, sigh"
"The anger and the pain yet I sin again"

Dying with open eyes
Meeting death he realize
Chanting demons watch his bed
With tearfilled eyes he rest his head

Faithful - deceiver - burning - believer of all
Dangerous temptations - thrilling explorations
Lustres of the flesh - makes me wish for death

The angel of creation - falling black and stained
Screaming out for mercy - a fate you won't retain
Crushed you have the palace - the temple of my prayers
You have walked the ground - of where man shouldn't dare
Tearing my soul apart - you die in my blackened heart
