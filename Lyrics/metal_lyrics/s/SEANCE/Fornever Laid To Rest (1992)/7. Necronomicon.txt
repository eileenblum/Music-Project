The moon it burns - deeply in my eyes
As I peacefully lay - anxious to die

With every breath - I feel myself grow weak
The words escape me - when I try to speak
Unseen eyes watch me - the silence is alive

Unquestioned faith - I near the end
Old forbidden sights - the spirits descend
Wait, don't look around - not into this room
You know too well - you're not welcome in this tomb

Starless nights and burning signs
Leads me by the hand
Oh - dormant usurper
Grant me thy flaming land

I close my eyes - in the tower of baal
Knowing that I soon - shall leave you all

To rise again - as the long lost son
Soon all will be new - under the sun

Bound for death I sail the sea of pain
The walls they bleed and the shadows change
As one thousand needles pierce my soul
I lose touch with this world
And start to float

I'm leaving, I'm falling - I see you oh great master
Lord, catch my fall - and let me be yours for ever after
