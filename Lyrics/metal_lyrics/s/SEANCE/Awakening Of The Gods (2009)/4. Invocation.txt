I will summon the ghosts
The evil ghost
Is born to this world

Hordes of evil creation

Revels from the darkness
Will rip your flesh into the bones
And tear your soul apart

Hail to thee
Lord Luciferion
Bring to me
The sign of oblivion

Cleanse me
Unholy spirit take my soul
Seventh seal
Evil twisted death

I now summon the ghost
Bringer of damnation will smash your face
And send you straight to hell

Now the nightshade will fall
Moonspell
And the serpent will call
For you

I will sacrifice
