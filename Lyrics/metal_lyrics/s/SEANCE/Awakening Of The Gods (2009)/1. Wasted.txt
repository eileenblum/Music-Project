Lying here in my rotten grave
Thoughts play tricks to my head
Faithless words about your will to save (me)
Oh my god an I dead

Peeling out your eye and through it down

Bugs are eating upon my skull
Leeches crawl in my vein
Rats attacking my swelling limbs
My skin turns blue I'm insane

Marching unto the dead
Deeper into realms of Satan
Beyond the world you call life

Marching into the death
Bleeding
This will be your final breath
Fallen from the sky

Death surrounds me everywhere
Now I pay for my sins
Coughing dust in eternal time
My lifeless soul's not dead

Screaming voices in despair
Nocturnal demons rhymes
Echoes bouncing through the walls
Oh my god am I dead
