As I lay me down to sleep
I pray my soul is mine to keep
No life left for the dead
I will rise again
Yes I died before I woke

Breathing is no more
Screaming for some gore
Face down dead on the ground
Roll the dice again

My body ain't yet cold
Buried to be untold
Chills run upon my spin
I will walk again

Coldblooded
Insane
Murder
In the blink of an eye
Ruptured veins
I was supposed to die

Beyond the night I fall
Summoning my self to live
Came back as no one before
To slice again

Inside my blistered eyes
No control
No control brutal frenzy
Gushing blood torn intensive

Scream
Scream for the blood you stole from me
I'll take yours now

Die
Die for the sake of just being killed
I through your soul away
