Turn the key push the button
This will be my finest gift
I am terminating
All souls I tear apart

Tear apart

Black skies turn white
Overwhelming fear impales you
Mushroom clouds are forming
They will find you too

Reign of fire
Brighter than the sun
Hell is
Upon you
you know your time has come

Laughing demons
Surfing on nuclear shockwaves
Don't take your eyes off of them
They'll rip your soul apart

Soul apart

Vengeance overkill
Violent retribution
Massmurder terror
Doomsday is on its way

I am the night that will
Fornever lay to rest
I am the peace you search
For call it heaven sent
I am you death your hate
Your mind your soul I bent
I am your pain your hurt
Your prayers heaven sent
