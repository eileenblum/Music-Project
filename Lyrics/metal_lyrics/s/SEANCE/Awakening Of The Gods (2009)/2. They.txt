They passing through your mortal flesh
In hate and anger
They take your soul from you
Conquering your mind with pain

Wide open wounds you bleed
Violence is unleashed
Prepare to save your self beware

They pull you under the bed

Longing for the eternal death
There you can rest in peace

They hang you from a rotten tree

You wish you were buried in the blackest soil
Deep down below your fear

Pay the price that is on your soul
They hunt you down that is their goal

And as you turn to stone
Your flesh is ripped to the bone
Walls are stained with blood from you

Pandemonium ancient rites
Soul once again comes alive
Fallen angel ah I took you hand
Ripped through the flesh invoken the dark
My soul will burn again
Kill in the name of hate and fear
Reborn awake
My descending spirit will revenge
Mortal flee killing spree
Plagues of hell demons dwell
You never escape you die
Captured in my trauma
Crosses turn again to south
No more sleep to humankind
Feeling no more pain

Skinpeeled and gasping for breath
They hang you upside down
Blood splashing down the floor
They pull your fingers out
Opens up your chest
Mangled face death comes reborn
