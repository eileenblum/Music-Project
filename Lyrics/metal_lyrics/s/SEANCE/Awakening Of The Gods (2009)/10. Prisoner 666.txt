Ten long years I've been caged
Within these walls
I must be free I must break out
To ease my pain
Urge to kill and feast on human flesh
Step inside my cell now
You will five me birth again

I ran outside I'm free at last
Over the walls past the guard
And into the dark
I ran like hell found a house
And knocked the door
Sorry to disturb you
You will give me life again

Kill I'm worse than hell
Embraced by evil force
Chaos will rule again
The innocent is my prey

I slashed them up stole their car
To the nearest bar
I'm the bringer of hate no one escapes
This inevitable fate
I sealed the door, and pulled my 44
May I have your attention please
You will give me a soul again

My game of slaughter just started today
Do you want to come out and play
I am adapted to a diet of death
Stand still while I'm crushing your head

Who knows someday I'm coming your way
You better beware you better prepare
Lock you door

Sneaking up coming from the back
You will be the loser
You will give me death again
