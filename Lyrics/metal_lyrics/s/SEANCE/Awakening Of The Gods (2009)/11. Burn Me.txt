This place will kill me
It seems to feel my pain
Secretions of flesh
Reveals its final aim
Slowly approaching
Through the offensive stench
The cold controlled
Time has just run out

Uh hell imprinting my mind

Burn me, obey me
Defy me, invite me

Believe me now
Believe we leave this you have seen
The circle inside the tomb
You shall deny what you defy
Suffering is only for the weak and worthless

The silence is broken
The sphere is turning red
The words been spoken
Prepare to meet the dead
The hooks in flesh
Dragging me inside
Controlled with fire
I will wake up dead

Now burn you turn
Walk through the land of hate
Impaled with darkness
Will also be your fate
Come come closer
Bring forth your final day
Deal in pain
No life will remain
