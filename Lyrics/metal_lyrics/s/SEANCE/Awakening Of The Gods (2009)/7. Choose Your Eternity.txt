I'll send your soul to the other side
Your life will end today
Hell hounds are with me, and on the hunt
You will never catch your breath

Cold strikes when I begin to stroke your hair
You start to lose your mind
Changing shadows reaching out to tear
There's no help in prayers

Choose
Your eternity
Your flesh dies now
And you will be dead forever
Will be dead forever
Dead forever

Those who had received the mark of the beast
Or worshipped my image
Will be generals of gnawing the
Skulls of suffering sinners

Torment in fire
Everlasting punishment
Agony forever
Shame and everlasting contempt

Writhe in flames
Weeping and gnashing of teeth
Now it's the time
Raise your hand and join the beast

Hordes of demons
Souls from the beginning of time
In legions they gathered
Sound the horn of genocide

And now it starts ferocious and grim
Horizons in blood terror the bring

Choose choose choose

The war goes on from this day to the end
Fallen mortals you torments
Hell hounds are with you and on the hunt
They'll never catch their breath
