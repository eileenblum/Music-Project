The seal has been been broken, and the answer revealed
Truth will be spoken, the future is here

You ask for forgiveness, one last time
All these years, I have been deceived
We made a decision, to leave it alone
Now it is my time, to show that I can stand alone

You know why and what in my heart, but pieces of me just keeps falling apart
Time went by I just stand no clue, this lie and deception was all about you

I've led and misguided, for so many years
All the trust that I've had then, has now disappeared

You ask for forgiveness, one last time
All these years, I have been deceived
We made a decision, to leave it alone
Now it is my time to show that I can stand alone

You know why and what in my heart, but pieces of me just keeps falling apart
Time went by I just stand no clue, this lie and deception was all about you

[Solo]

You know why and what in my heart, but pieces of me just keeps falling apart
Time went by I just stand no clue, this lie and deception was all about you
