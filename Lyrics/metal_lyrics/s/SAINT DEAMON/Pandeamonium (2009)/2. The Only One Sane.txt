Screams, from the rhyme
Ripping and twisting my brain, feeding my soul
Assessing and turning inside

Caught in time, caught in space
Lost in the twilight. The vortex is open again.
From the book, of the damned
Voices are calling, am I the only one sane

Nowhere to go, I'm trapped in this void yet unknown
Something is here, feeding the souls of the dead

Caught in time, caught in space
Lost in the twilight. The vortex is open again.
From the book, of the damned
Voices are calling, am I the only one sane

[Solo]

Caught in time, caught in space
Lost in the twilight. The vortex is open again.
From the book, of the damned
Voices are calling, am I the only one sane

Caught in time, caught in space
Lost in the twilight. The vortex is open again.
Voices are calling, am I the only one sane
