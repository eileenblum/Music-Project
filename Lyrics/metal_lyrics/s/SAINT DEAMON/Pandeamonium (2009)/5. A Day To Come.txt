See my cold and express less face,
waiting here to leave this world
All alone I'm lying here, waiting for my day to come

I can't reveal my fate, no one even knows my pain
My life is over now and I must face the end

If I had one more chance in life, I would redeem
Salvation seems so far away, i close my eyes

Days go bye in agony, waiting to be free at last
Leave this world seems so easy,
it's killing me to know what I'll be missing now

I can't reveal my fate, no one even knows my pain
My life is over now and I must face the end

If I had one more chance in life, I would redeem
Salvation seems so far away, i close my eyes
If I had one more chance in life, I would redeem
Salvation seems so far away, i close my eyes
