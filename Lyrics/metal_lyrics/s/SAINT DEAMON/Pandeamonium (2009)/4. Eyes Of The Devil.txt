Gather all the people to stand in a ring
Submission and worship the ancient and forgotten
Idols and Images torture and pain
Stories of slavery, giving their blood

All in all they were chosen, from their lives they were taken
Hidden from the light, bleed to serve gods might
Hear the pain of it's evil, see the eyes of the devil
Never to have a life, born to be sacrificed

See all the people they're marching in line
Carrying pushing and obeying the whip
Impossible living and horrible dying
This fortune was build on the skulls of the dead

All in all they were chosen, from their lives they were taken
Hidden from the light, bleed to serve gods might
Hear the pain of it's evil, see the eyes of the devil
Never to have a life, born to be sacrificed
