It's written in words, the way of the world.
A selection of fate. Just pick one, and you'll be saved.

A lifetime of searching for reason and hope.
Living to serve different gods, we are lost.

Can this be? Will it end?
The fate of mankind will transcend. All we have is our beliefs.
But soon enough the truth reveals.
Will we stay or fade away.

Rebuilding in vain, the way of the world.
Destruction is here, but we will not stand aside.

A lifetime of searching for reason and hope.

Can this be? Will it end?
The fate of mankind will transcend.
All we have is our beliefs.
But soon enough the truth reveals.
Will we stay or fade away.

Can this be? Will it end?
The fate of mankind will transcend.
All we have is our beliefs.
But soon enough the truth reveals.
Will we stay or fade away.
