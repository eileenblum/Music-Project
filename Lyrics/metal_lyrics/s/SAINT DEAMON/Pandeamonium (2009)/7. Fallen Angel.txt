A paradise on earth, a sanctuary for my heart
It's a place were i can feel safe
All these years went by, and all I felt was misery
Even tough i kneel and pray I'll never heal

Torture and suffering is all that i know
The anguish inside of me is burning out
My worst enemy is feeling of hate
The chaos of cause and effect is the end of me

Spread your wings, fallen angel,
this is your time to be free again
Come with me fallen angel, I'll lead the way

So hard to stand here beside, solitude in me wont hide
There's a judgment hanging over me
Somehow i cannot give in, you are the only one i need
Can you help me find another way

Torture and suffering is all that i know
The anguish inside of me is burning out
My worst enemy is feeling of hate
The chaos of cause and effect is the end of me

Spread your wings, fallen angel,
this is your time to be free again
Come with me fallen angel, I'll lead the way
