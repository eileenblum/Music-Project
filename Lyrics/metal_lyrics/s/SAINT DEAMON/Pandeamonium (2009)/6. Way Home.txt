It is all clear to me now, i have found my way
Can you see me for what I've become, or will the past live on

Live as one on our own, fallout stand alone
Once an outcast a lowlife I'm finding my way home
Live as one on our own, fallout stand alone
Once an outcast a lowlife I'm finding my way home

All the people gathered around but too blind to see
Once I lived with rage in my mind, put the world aside

Live as one on our own, fallout stand alone
Once an outcast a lowlife I'm finding my way home

Live as one on our own, fallout stand alone
Once live as one on our own, fallout stand alone
Live as one on our own, fallout stand alone
Once an outcast a lowlife I'm finding my way home
an outcast a lowlife I'm finding my way home

OHH
I'm finding my way home
