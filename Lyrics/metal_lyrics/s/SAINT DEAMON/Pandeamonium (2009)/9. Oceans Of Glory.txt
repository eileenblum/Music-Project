Death to the lowlifes and misfits who stands in my way
The future in my hands this victory I will prevail
Let the thrill of danger catch my soul

Live to fight another day, a thousand strong we set our sail
Take the future in our hands, surrender or die today

And
All that we know is to follow our call
Oceans of glory our spirit cannot fall
With the wind in our sails, on this quest we cannot fail
Oceans of glory we'll stay alive

Loaded with armor and weapons, there's no turning back
For so many horrible years, this life's been my path
Let the thrill of danger catch my soul

Live to fight another day, a thousand strong we set our sail
Take the future in our hands, surrender or die today

And
All that we know is to follow our call
Oceans of glory our spirit cannot fall
With the wind in our sails, on this quest we cannot fail
Oceans of glory we'll stay alive

With the wind in our sails, on this quest we cannot fail
Oceans of glory we'll stay alive

And
All that we know is to follow our call
Oceans of glory our spirit cannot fall
With the wind in our sails, on this quest we cannot fail
Oceans of glory we'll stay alive
