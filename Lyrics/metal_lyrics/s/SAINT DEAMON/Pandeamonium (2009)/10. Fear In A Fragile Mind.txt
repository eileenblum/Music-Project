I found myself stranded, without any reason
I woke up around here with my memory gone
In my head I see glimpse and pieces
It's not enough just to kno who I am

I can't recall my sins its just emotions within,
keep searching for the meaning of my life
Live for one day at the time, is there a chance that I'll find,
ther meaning of my life

In this state of mind, I leave it behind, to conquer the
fear in a fragile mind
Transcended my soul, the secrets untold,
a sacrifice still in control

I'm trapped in this madness, dead but still breathing,
I'm waiting for answers, a way to stay alive
Did someone put me, here to be punished
All araound there arw walls, surrounding me

I can't recall my sins its just emotions within,
keep searching for the meaning of my life
Live for one day at the time, is there a chance that I'll find,
ther meaning of my life

In this state of mind, I leave it behind, to conquer the
fear in a fragile mind
Transcended my soul, the secrets untold,
a sacrifice still in control
