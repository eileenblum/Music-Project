Give me the list of targets, the enemy will be shut down
In the dark of the night, they wont even know I'm here
Become the prey of my hunt, one hit and the light will blow out
Sent here the carry out orders, leaving a trail of death

Deceiving the brothers we once knew, under command
there's no turning back
Silently I will control you in the darkness I attak

Feelings are burning inside of me, show me the
path were it ends
The souls of my victims are haunting me, i wish i was free
From the deamon within

They say that I am the evil, a man with no heart in his chest
Even the toughest would shiver, meeting the killing hand

Deceiving the brothers we once knew, under command
there's no turning back
Silently I will control you in the darkness I attack

Feelings are burning inside of me, show me the
path were it ends
The souls of my victings are haunting me, i wish i was free
From the deamon within
