Waking up from the darkest nightmare, feel the shivers fade away
The lights are dim and you try to rise up as you find there is something wrong

Is it the way that you feel, something inside
The dream that you had seems so real and you're left here questioning why

You see it you breathe it, it's all around you and you're scared
Will eventually drive you mad
It's a burden it drains you, to see the things that lies beyond
And the things that's yet to come

You are asking yourself the question, if you could would you change the past
Can your actions fight the future; make way in an altered life

Is it the way that you feel, something inside
The dream that you had seems so real and you're left here questioning why

You see it you breathe it, it's all around you and you're scared
Will eventually drive you mad
It's a burden it drains you, to see the things that lies beyond
And the things that's yet to come

Is it the way that you feel, something inside

You see it you breathe it, it's all around you and you're scared
Will eventually drive you mad
It's a burden it drains you, to see the things that lies beyond
And the things that's yet to come

You see it you breathe it, it's all around you and you're scared
Will eventually drive you mad
