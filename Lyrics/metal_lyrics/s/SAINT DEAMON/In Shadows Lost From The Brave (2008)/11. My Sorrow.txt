In my heart, there is an empty space you left me standing here
There used to be a meaning in my life

All alone I'm down on my knees and pray
My soul is torn apart and all the love has gone away
It's so hard for me to believe in someone even if I try
Too afraid once again break down and cry

When hope is gone
And no one else can save me
I live in lies
And life is just a failure
Painted in black
There's nothing left to live for
Where is my pride
I'm trapped inside this cold war

All alone I'm down on my knees and pray
My soul is torn apart and all the love has gone away
It's so hard for me to believe in someone even if I try
Too afraid once again break down and cry

I know you will always be my sorrow
And I will have to face tomorrow
Standing all alone I'm falling
I need to be strong
I'm holding on

I know you will always be my sorrow
And I will have to face tomorrow
Standing all alone I'm falling
I need to be strong

I know you will always be my sorrow
And I will have to face tomorrow
Standing all alone I'm falling
I need to be strong
I'm holding on
