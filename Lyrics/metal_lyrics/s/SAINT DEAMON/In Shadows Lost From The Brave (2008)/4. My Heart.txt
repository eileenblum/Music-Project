I'm falling down
I'm loosing ground tonight
The time is running out
I have to stop this endless fight

I've got myself to blame
But you should take the shame
Just like so many times before
Too many sleepless nights
It's time to say goodbye

My heart bleeds for you
My heart greed's the truth
Too much pain inside and it's all because of you
My heart sacrifice
My heart justifies
Love's gone broken and it's all because of you

This is the end
I can't defend any more
Feels like I've lost the war
Without being the one to fall

My heart bleeds for you
My heart greed's the truth
Too much pain inside and it's all because of you
My heart sacrifice
My heart justifies
Love's gone broken and it's all because of you

My heart bleeds for you
My heart greed's the truth
Too much pain inside and it's all because of you
My heart sacrifice
My heart justifies
Love's gone broken and it's all because of you
