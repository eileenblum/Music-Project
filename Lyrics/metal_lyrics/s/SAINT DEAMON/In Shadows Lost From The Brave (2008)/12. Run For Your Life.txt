The seals will break
One by one
Trials will rise
For all man kind

No one knows
What the future will bring
And who's got the key to our misery

But if we hold on
To what we believe
Together we will be strong
Write our own history

Run, run for your life
It comes a storm to ruin our lives
Prepare to fight all through the night
I see the lightning in the sky
Run, run for your life
The thunder of darkness is to come
I've seen a sign written in time
The judgement day will soon arise

An angel's voice
Whispered in my ear
Soon death and defeat
Will come by fear

But if we hold on
To what we believe
Together we will be strong
Write our own history

Run, run for your life
It comes a storm to ruin our lives
Prepare to fight all through the night
I see the lightning in the sky
Run, run for your life
The thunder of darkness is to come
I've seen a sign written in time
The judgement day will soon arise

Run, run for your life
It comes a storm to ruin our lives
Prepare to fight all through the night
I see the lightning in the sky
Run, run for your life
The thunder of darkness is to come
I've seen a sign written in time
The judgement day will soon arise
