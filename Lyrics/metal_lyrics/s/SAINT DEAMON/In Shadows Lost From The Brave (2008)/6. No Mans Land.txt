Walking alone in a desert of lies
Nobody knows
The truth in my eyes
Falling down deeper into the dark
And it's tearing my soul apart
Living in danger it's harder to breath
Trying to pray
Down on my knees
The devil is watching all that I do
And I can't hold him back he's breaking through

Is anyone out there?
Please hear my call
I can't wait no longer
Can somebody ease my fall?

All alone in no mans land
A stranger in a lost world
Up against my death I stand
Fighting for my freedom
All alone in no mans land
A stranger in a lost world
Try to get what I demand
Fighting for my freedom

No need to run cause I know I can't hide
All I can do is keep me alive
I wanna break free from the shackles I'm in
That I'm ready to stand up for my sins

Is anyone out there?
Please hear my call
I can't wait no longer
Can somebody ease my fall?

All alone in no mans land
A stranger in a lost world
Up against my death I stand
Fighting for my freedom
All alone in no mans land
A stranger in a lost world
Try to get what I demand
Fighting for my freedom

Savior hear me cry
I can't bear this burden
I have paid my price and begging you for mercy
I hate to be lost inside of this madness
Please show me the light that leads me to a brighter day

All alone in no mans land
A stranger in a lost world
Up against my death I stand
Fighting for my freedom
All alone in no mans land
A stranger in a lost world
Try to get what I demand
Fighting for my freedom
