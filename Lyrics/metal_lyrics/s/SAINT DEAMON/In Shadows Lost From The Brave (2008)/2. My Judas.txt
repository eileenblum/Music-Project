Something inside me is holding on
To what I believe in so you can't take my pride
You might be the winner of this fight
But time will tell that I'm right

My Judas

You're dragging me down with you
I'm trapped in a nightmare that I can't wake up from
You've taking my breath away
It feels like I'm drowning in the deepest sorrow

Your poison will bring me down
Down on my knees but I will always rise up
You turned our love to hate
But somehow I know that I will keep my strong fate

Something inside me is holding on
To what I believe in so you can't take my pride
You might be the winner of this fight
But time will tell that I'm right

All alone I'm falling deeper and deeper into sadness and hate
All alone I'm calling but no one seem to hear my cry for help
You betrayed my worn out soul with your lies

My Judas

After what's said and done
You will be defeated by your own stupidity
Nothing remains of you
What ever happened to the man I once knew
Your desperate tries will fail
Times running out before the final curtain fall
At last you will stand alone
Just like a fool knowing you could have had it all

Something inside me is holding on
To what I believe in so you can't take my pride
You might be the winner of this fight
But time will tell that I'm right

All alone I'm falling deeper and deeper into sadness and hate
All alone I'm calling but no one seem to hear my cry for help
You betrayed my worn out soul with your lies

All alone I'm falling deeper and deeper into sadness and hate
All alone I'm calling but no one seem to hear my cry for help

All alone I'm falling deeper and deeper into sadness and hate
All alone I'm calling but no one seem to hear my cry for help
You betrayed my worn out soul with your lies

You ripped out my heart with
The sharpest knife I've ever seen in my life
Who would have thought
That anyone ever could be so damn mean to me
