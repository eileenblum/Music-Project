Trapped in the dark where the sun don't shine
No one escape from these eyes
He's chasing you down
Until you surrender your soul

The riper has come from the land of death
To bring back his sadness to all
That somehow true believe
That goodness can heal
You inside

We stand against his demons now
So over come your fear
I've seen the sign the final fight is here

Oh!

My heart is aching forever
Evil is coming our way
Don't want to be bound here together
In shadows lost from the brave

If we're united we can proclaim
The victory over his troops
His insanity dies
A new day will soon arise

Yeah

We stand against his demons now
So over come your fear
I've seen the sign the final fight is here

My heart is aching forever
Evil is coming our way
Don't want to be bound here together
In shadows lost from the brave

I once was lost but now I found
My strength deep down in my past
And I believe eternity will come to those
That will play their part at last

We stand against his demons now
So over come your fear
I've seen the sign the final fight is here

Oh!

My heart is aching forever
Evil is coming our way
Don't want to be bound here together
In shadows lost...

My heart is aching forever
Evil is coming our way
Don't want to be bound here together
In shadows lost...
In shadows lost...
In shadows lost from the brave
