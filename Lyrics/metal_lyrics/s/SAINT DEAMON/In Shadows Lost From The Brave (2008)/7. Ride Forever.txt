A thunder will come
With fire and lightning
I'm riding with deamons
We're taking the road tonight

Surrounded by hate
From shadows we'll rise up
We won't show you mercy
There's no place to hide

Ride forever
Ride forevermore
Ride forever
You'll hear the power of the mighty roar

Our enemies will fall
Get ready for destruction
Out on the highway
We will be victorious

Inside a dream
Where I've seen the future
We won't show you mercy
There's no place to hide

Ride forever
Ride forevermore
Ride forever
You'll hear the power of the mighty roar

Ride forever
Ride forevermore
Ride forever
You'll hear the power of the mighty roar

Ride forever
Ride forevermore
Ride forever
You'll hear the power of the mighty roar

Ride forever
