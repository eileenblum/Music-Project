It's time to leave all our sorrows tonight
Travel without destination
Never look back we've got nothing to hide
Leaving the shore in the dawn

No one know
Where to go
Our fortune lies in the future
We're on board setting the course
The deamon ship will prevail

Far beyond the darkest horizon
Our ship got lost in the shadows
We're trapped inside of a dream
But still got power within
Far beyond the darkest horizon
Our legends destiny calling
Be strong and follow your heart
Take pride of being apart
Deamons

Nothing is holding us back but our thoughts
Hear the ocean is calling
Leaving my body I'm no longer caught
Now immortal and free

I don't know
Where to go
Our fortune lies in the future
We're on board setting the course
The deamon ship will prevail

Far beyond the darkest horizon
Our ship got lost in the shadows
We're trapped inside of a dream
But still got power within
Far beyond the darkest horizon
Our legends destiny calling
Be strong and follow your heart
Take pride of being apart
Deamons

Far beyond the darkest horizon
Our ship got lost in the shadows
We're trapped inside of a dream
But still got power within
Far beyond the darkest horizon
Our legends destiny calling
Be strong and follow your heart
Take pride of being apart
Deamons
