There is no light to guide your way
The terror of being hunted you feel it everyday
25 degrees below the point of zero
It's then you learn what it takes to be a hero

No time to think no time to feel
This is not a nightmare this is for real

You don't need to be fearless, embrace your pain don't run away
The brave never bleeds
And in this thrilling moment there's no need to be cold as ice

Can you hear the voices floating on the wind
Hiding in the darkness waiting out this scene
If this is the moment that you might get the chance
They are helpless your flawless your final night is near

No time to think no time to feel
This is not a nightmare this is for real

You don't need to be fearless, embrace your pain don't run away
The brave never bleeds
And in this thrilling moment there's no need to be cold as ice

Some people don't get to choose their own fate
And this time, the destiny choose you

You don't need to be fearless, embrace your pain don't run away
The brave never bleeds

You don't need to be fearless, embrace your pain don't run away
The brave never bleeds
And in this thrilling moment there's no need to be cold...
Cold as ice
