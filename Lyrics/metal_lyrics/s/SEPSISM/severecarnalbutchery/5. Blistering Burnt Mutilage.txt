Separated body limbs
Infested with swarms of maggots
Decomposing mangled stiffs
Inflamed with cluttered eyes
Ignite the festering corpses
Mutilated bodies are burning
The rotting flesh now blisters
Patches of skin are peeling
Bubbles burst with steaming pus
Cadavers are falling apart
Melting skin is dripping
Remnants withered and charred
Human features scorched
Burned beyond recognition
Pile of corpses collapses
Putrid incineration
