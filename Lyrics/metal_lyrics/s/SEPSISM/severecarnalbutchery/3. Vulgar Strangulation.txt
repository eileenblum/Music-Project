Ad I hold you down
You struggle to escape
I begin to remove your anus
Then rip into your face
Your mind is filled with fear
As you witness your mutilation
Tear off body parts
Death by separation
I must now consume your organs
Stomach is the first I eat
Drinking the warm excretions
Squeezed from out your bladder
No controlling my sadistic ways
I like to bring forth suffering
Your body lies face down in blood
This carcass I am now devouring
