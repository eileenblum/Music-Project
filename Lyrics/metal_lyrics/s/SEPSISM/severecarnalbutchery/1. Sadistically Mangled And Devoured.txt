A sickening craving builds within me
A craving for human flesh
This hunger my body cannot withstand
The urge to kill overpowers me
I have lost complete control
My mind is filled with visions of devouring mangled corpses
I can't resist my thirst for gore
To quench my vulgar urges...
I must kill
Now I search for my victim
An innocent and unsuspecting woman
Brutally I rape and abduct her
Then return to perform the gruesome task
Strangled to death
My victim's neck is crushed
Body convulses
My demented rush
Now with my blade
I begin to mutilate
Hacking up the body and consuming bloody chunks
Slowly I slice open the abdomen
Then viciously rip out the organs
Sinking my teeth into the entrails gives me disgusting ecstasy
Smashing my fist into the ribcage
The brittle bones crack and splinter
Tearing out the lungs and the heart
The last of the organs to devour
Stripped of flesh
Totally disemboweled
Nothing is left
But a skeletal carcass
