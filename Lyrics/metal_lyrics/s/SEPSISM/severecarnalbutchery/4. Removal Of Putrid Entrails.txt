Exhume the rotted petrified stiff
The shriveled corpse
Is ridden with carrion
An insane mortician
Breaks open the casket
Releasing the stench of purification
Carving out the abdomen
Reaching in the gaping hole
Slowly bringing out the entrails
Covered in decaying mold
The odor is unbearable
It control his psychotic mind
He stretches out the corpse's guts
Discharging clots of bloody pus
Crushing the bladder as it deteriorates
The digestive tract he now mutilates
Digging through the abdominal area
Taking out the stale kidneys
The brutal separation of organs
Accomplishes his morbid needs
Extraction of juices
The mortician's clothes are stained
Destroying the rectum
While stomach acids drain
Tear the liver
Spewing mass blood
He thrives on sickness
Ridden of the pancreas
Complete removal
Of intestines and waste
The sick bile mess
Is returned to the grave
