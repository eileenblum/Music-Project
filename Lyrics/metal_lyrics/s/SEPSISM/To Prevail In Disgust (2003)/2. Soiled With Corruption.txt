Weak minded followers
Brainwashed for me to mold
For sickening ways
Of living their feeble minds
Controlled my powers grow
Strong I've gained their trust
To kill for me
To satisfy my lust

Blasphemous deeds
Brutality perverted
Forced within my intentions
Inserted in their minds
I've implanted hate
Oblivious to my sickness
I strive to dominate

Merciless mind attack
My heart rotten and black
Sadistic to the core
I reign upon you whores
Sadistic to the core
My heart rotten and black
Hatred in my eyes
Mind attack

My aggression sets me free
Sick desire to see flesh bleed
Driven by the thought of death
Corrupting minds 'til nothings left
