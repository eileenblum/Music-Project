Look at me a horrible sight
Your stomach turns, disgust in your eyes
Banished from society
Mutant being in darkness I hide

To exist in society
Everyone must look like me
My existence a mystery
A hideous deformity

Filled with hate
A violence rage
Humanity will feel my pain
Suffering for many years
For fury unleashed I've gone insane

One by one I rip in to your faces
Permanent scars, from multiple lacerations
Severely inflicted
Living with a hideous deformation

Hideous..hideous...hideous deformity

Feel your face bleeding
As my nails are digging in punctured skin
In agony you scream
Battered until the damage is irreversible
The end results still
Remain unseen

Torn, twisted maimed, contorted eyeballs are crushed
Inverted blind to this horrid form
Scarred for life
