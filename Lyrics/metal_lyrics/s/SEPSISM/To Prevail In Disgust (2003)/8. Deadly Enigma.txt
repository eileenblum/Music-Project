Laid to rest in an open trench
Left exposed and emitting a putrid stench
Temporary resting ground
Undisturbed decomposing my kill was found

Parasites invading the body
Open wounds are simply inviting
Incubating insects breeding
On decay extensive feeding
With each death I leave you answers
Time erodes important factors
Complicating series of murders
Test your mind as more are discovered

Spilling blood again
It seems this game may never end
Fucking with your mind
For reasons you can't comprehend

Piece the clues together
Race to solve this deadly enigma
Prevent the next murder
Time elapsing...deadly enigma

I calculate every move
With absolute precision
No chance of survival
Fatal implications
Mutilating, strangling
Different means of murder
Evidence collected
Pointing to one killer
