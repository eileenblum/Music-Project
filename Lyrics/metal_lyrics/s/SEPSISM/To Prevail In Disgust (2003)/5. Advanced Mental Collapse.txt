Shreds of skin
Ripped flesh
Self inflicted razor
Blade lacerations
Far advanced brain
Disorder
Suffering frightening
Hallucinations

Maggots I envision
Disgusting creatures storm my body
Crawling on my skin
An eerie feeling overcomes me
Panicking I scrape away
Loss of skin maggots remain

Desperate I continue
Scratching at myself as they roam freely
Failed attempts to expel them
Slashing with razor blades
Bleeding profusely

Nothing seems to affect them
Visions of these pests remain
Finger nails embedded in my flesh
Ripping deep wounds
Writhing in pain
Burning of the skin
This scorching heat I can't sustain
Proceeding with their vile ways
I cannot win
Maggots remain

Gore is all I see
Destroyed by mind thoughts killing me
