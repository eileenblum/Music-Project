Beyond insanity
His warped reality of degradation
Torment bleeds pleasure
In this realm of flesh
He speaks language of pain and suffering

Far beyond the madness of the living
Severed from the rationale of humanity
Slaughtering motives of pure evil
Taking life is all he knows

Raped and beaten before the killing
Stabbed a hundred times

Beyond hate
Beyond pleasure
Beyond insanity

Sanity sanity
Not a question of sanity
Insanity insanity
Beyond insanity

Killing brings his soul sadistic
Peace kill them...kill them..kill them..kill them
