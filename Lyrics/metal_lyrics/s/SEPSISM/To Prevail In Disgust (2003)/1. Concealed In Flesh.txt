Adoption of new
Methods
For transporting
Drugs undetected
Extremely cruel
Methods
Achieved through sickness

Contemplation
A cold and callous plan
Conceived deception
Lured into the hands of thieves
Abduction-many children vanishing
Suffocation
Murdering to hit the greed
Cutting through their tender skin
Disemboweled embalmed and cleansed
Deprived of life and innocence
Hallowed corpse to hold the substance

Innocent lives taken
By the sickest minds in existence
Securing their own future
At a child expense

Stuffed with pounds of cocaine
Stitched up. drugs...
Concealed in flesh
Used as human luggage
Containing drugs
Concealed in flesh

Wrapped up inside a sheet
Giving a false impression
Carried as if still alive
Misleading their intentions

Stored within the walls of flesh

Tragic end for a short lived soul
Killed in vein by these criminals

Undetected deadly powder
A safely hidden human killer

An empty smell to hide the drug
Another stiff to reconstruct
