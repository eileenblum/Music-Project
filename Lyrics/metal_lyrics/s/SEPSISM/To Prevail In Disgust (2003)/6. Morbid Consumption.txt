I like to eat decaying corpses
After I remove them from the ground
Chewing on the decomposing flesh
Consuming liquids from the rotting bowels

Gnawing on intestines
Chewing on your heart
Chomping on your appendix
Tearing you apart

Eating away your insides
Smelling the pungent fumes
Gorging on the dead carcass
Ripped from out of it's tomb

Cut open your stomach
Reach deep within
Pull out greasy intestines
Feasting shall begin

Eating your guts
Chewing on your spleen
Drinking your bile
Smelling your stench
