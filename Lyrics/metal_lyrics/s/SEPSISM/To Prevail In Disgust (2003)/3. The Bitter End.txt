Razor blades open
The infection to a chemical obsession
Reality...disgust...life...hatred
Destroyed by inner loathing
The solution to end this suffering
Killing disembowelment
Rip them to pieces

Now you'll see the time has come
To take back what's mine
Driven by intoxication
I want them to die
I want you to...die

I want you to die in front of me
And beg for your life
I slice open your throat
You put up a fight
You never thought that it would come to this
After you are dead
Who's next on my shit list

I want you to die

Insane and addicted to hard alcohol
While shooting up smack
Snorting lines, PCP, acid tabs and smoking crack out for blood
Sick as fuck I dream to see you fucking bleed
Controlled by hate
That burns within me
Death to all who have deceived me

Lost control
Overwhelmed with hate
Drunk with power and the will to mutilate
In control of my victims fate
Fucking me over was you big mistake

Now you'll see the time has come
To take back what's mine
Driven by intoxication I want them to die
I want you to...

Die in front of me
And beg for your life
I slice open your throat
You put up a fight
You never thought that it would come to this
After you are dead
Who's next on my shit list
Bleed all over me
I'm watching you die
Laughing at the thought of of your demise
Your blood and guts will soon belong to me
Pounding on your face 'til life has ceased

I want you to die

Revenge!
