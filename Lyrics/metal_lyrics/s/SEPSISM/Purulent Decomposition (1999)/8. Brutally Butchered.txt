Placed Upon A Table
You Are Skinned Alive
Blood Runs Down Your Body
No Chance To Survive
Cutting Out Your Innards
Ripping Out Your Veins
Slicing Into Your Skull
Piercing Through Your Brain

Chopping Off Arms And Legs
Spurting Blood From Gashes
Eyeballs Fall To The Ground
Soon To Be A Carcass

Pulling Out Your Insides
Hacking Up Flesh And Meat
Nothing's Left Only Remains
Bloody Pile Of Human Meat
Sawing Bones Into Halves
Into Dust They Will Turn
End Of The Butchery
Corpse Is Left To Be Burned
