Your Chest Is Cut Open
While You're Still Alive
Pulling Out Bloody Organs
Consuming Your Insides

Tearing Out Your Spleen
Slicing Up Your Liver
Extracting Blood Soaked Tissue
Your Heart I Will Sever

Mutilate Your Inner Core
Grate Your Intestines Into Paste
As You Watch In Horror
I Expel The Remaining Waste

Extruding Out Your Eyes
Pushing Out The Sockets
Cutting Off Your Tongue
As I Watch You Suffer
Dissecting Your Brain
Cutting It Out Of The Cranium
You Are Left Brain Dead
Your Life Has Come To An End

Dissection
Mutilation
Amputation
Experimentation
