Looking Down, Starring At A Woman's Naked Corpse
I Touch Her Skin, It Feels So Cold Almost Frozen Stiff
Motionless, She Lay There Dead With Rotting Flesh
Filled With Stench Her Body Is A Bloated Mess

On Her Face There's No Expression, A Pale Complexion
I Lay Her Body On The Table For Dissection

Looking Down, Starring At A Woman's Naked Corpse
I Touch Her Skin, It Feels So Cold Almost Frozen Stiff
Searching For The Answers To The Cause Of Death
Trying To Find What Time She Took Her Final Breath

First Incision On Her Stomach
Cutting Up Towards Her Chest
Slow Removal Of Some Organs
A Procedure That Seems Grotesque

Studying The Uterus It's Strangely Bloated
Still Intact I Tear Inside It's Now Imploded

Stretch Open The Organ
Exposing What's Inside
Gruesome Observation
The Search Intensifies

I See A Figure Made Of Bones Inside Her Womb
No Skin, No Flesh, Just Small Remains Inside Entombed

A Carcass Of A Fetus
Resulting From Miscarriage
Never Taken From Her
Trapped Inside She Suffered

In Pieces Removed
The Horror Has Ceased
Two Bodies Detached
They Can Now Rest In Peace
