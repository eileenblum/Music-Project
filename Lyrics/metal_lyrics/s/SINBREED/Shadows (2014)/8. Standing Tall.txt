Standing on dunes
Watching the holy lands
Sun's a burning ball of fire
Behind my back
Lies the battlefield
All my brothers lie here bleeding
It all was part of the prophecy
Our fathers told us long ago
The 7th son of a 7th son
We followed him
Through the fire

Day or night?
Wrong or right?
Blind and numb
Time will tell
You've cast a spell

I have seen it has begun
Dark clouds covering the sun
Raise my head and I will
Never ever fall
You will feel my dying breath
My only comfort is in death
Till that day may come
I'll be standing tall

We got betrayed
He left us in the storm
Our saint's a hypocratic lier
He placed a curse
On his following
One by one into the darkness
All alone, sorrow in my heart
Our fathers warned us long ago
The 7th son of a 7th son
We followed him
Through the fire

Day or night?
Wrong or right?
Blind and numb
Time will tell
You've cast a spell

I have seen it has begun
Dark clouds covering the sun
Raise my head and I will
Never ever fall
You will feel my dying breath
My only comfort is in death
Till that day may come
I'll be standing tall

Time will tell
You've cast a spell

I have seen it has begun
Dark clouds covering the sun
Raise my head and I will
Never ever fall
You will feel my dying breath
My only comfort is in death
Till that day may come
I'll be standing tall

I have seen it has begun
Dark clouds covering the sun
Raise my head and I will
Never ever fall
You will feel my dying breath
My only comfort is in death
Till that day may come
I'll be standing tall
