Down in the darkest corner
Somewhere in your mind
If you look you may find
Some kind of deep desire
Slightly glowing spark
Your way out of the dark

Leave your troubling
Doubts behind
Step into the pack of hounds
Leave your quiet days behind
So you may stand all alone
Believe

With the darkness
The wolves coming closer
Count the seconds
No shelter in sight
Feel the madness
And fear coming closer
Truth's your weapon
Get ready to fight

Most of your days you're watching
And hoping that one day
All black is turning grey
Instead of moving on
You'd always step aside
Time to stand up with pride

Leave your troubling
Doubts behind
Step into the pack of hounds
Leave your quiet days behind
So you may stand all alone
Believe

With the darkness
The wolves coming closer
Count the seconds
No shelter in sight
Feel the madness
And fear coming closer
Truth's your weapon
Get ready to fight

The Right To Fight

Far too long you've been
Watching in silence
Far too long you've just
Been their pawn
Far too long you've been
Fleeing from violence
Far too long you're afraid
Of the storm

Leave your troubling
Doubts behind
Step into the pack of hounds
Leave your quiet days behind
So you may stand all alone
Believe

With the darkness
The wolves coming closer
Count the seconds
No shelter in sight
Feel the madness
And fear coming closer
Truth's your weapon
Get ready to fight
