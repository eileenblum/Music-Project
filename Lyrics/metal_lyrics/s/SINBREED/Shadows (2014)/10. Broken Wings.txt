A thunderstorm
Is raging through my head
It strikes my every
Single nerve
It shakes the ground
And crushes all that's real
Destructing everything
On earth

Wanna rage out
A blast of fury
Screaming out loud
No dawn in sight
What's it about
I have no clue here
Darkness around
Where's the light?

Will I spread
My broken wings and fly?
Will I ever again reach the sky?
There's no trust
Or belief anymore
With broken wings

I'm trapped inside
A maze of evil thoughts
Suppressing walls
Are all around
My mind is numb
There is no way to run
And no solution
To be found

Wanna rage out
A blast of fury
Screaming out loud
No dawn in sight

What's it about
I have no clue here
Darkness around
Where's the light?

Will I spread
My broken wings and fly?
Will I ever again reach the sky?
There's no trust
Or belief anymore
With broken wings

I won't get down
And neither won't get lost
My feet stand solid
On the ground
The seed is sawn
And it will grow up fast
It's harvest keeps me
Marching on

Wanna rage out
A blast of fury
Screaming out loud
No dawn in sight
What's it about
I have no clue here
Darkness around
Where's the light?

Will I spread
My broken wings and fly?
Will I ever again reach the sky?
There's no trust
Or belief anymore
With broken wings
