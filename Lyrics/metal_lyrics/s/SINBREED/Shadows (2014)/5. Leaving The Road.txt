Stand on the wayside
Cars passing by
Noonday's sun
Melting the streets
A life lies behind me
Another ahead
I'm happy I'm going astray
I'm out on my own
I follow the path
That leads from
Today to tomorrow
And when I return
Or better say if
I won't look back in sorrow

Each river is
Flowing down to sea

Thousands of streams
Cascading to one
Ten thousand streams
Go find on your own
Go find your own

The sun's guiding my way
I'm out on my search for the fire
Never mind what I may find
I'm feeling a burning desire
I'm leaving the road
To sail on my own

Each day step deeper
Into the unknown
I'm leaving the road
To find distant ways
A shadow behind
My only companion
And home is
Wherever I want to be

The sun's guiding my way
I'm out on my search for the fire
Never mind what I may find
I'm feeling a burning desire
I'm leaving the road
To sail on my own

Blistering sands
Under my feet
Blooming fields lying ahead
Behind my back
No footprints to find
The wind covers
My trail in silence
I hear a voice
From inside my heart
To live life
At my own discretion
I can lean on
Rely on my faith
That destiny's my own creation

Each river is
Flowing down to sea

Thousands of streams
Cascading to one
Ten thousand streams
Go find on your own
Go find your own

The sun's guiding my way
I'm out on my search for the fire
Never mind what I may find
I'm feeling a burning desire
I'm leaving the road
To sail on my own
