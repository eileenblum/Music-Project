I'm hiding in the shadows
Always by your side
In the dark of the night
Covering the light
As time decays I take control
Bring you to your knees
Now it's time the end is near
You know I am here

I lie to your face
But you must obey

Say do you remember
The day we first met?
You've been all on your own
Frightened to the bone
I was there to hold your hand
When no one else was there
By a thousand tongues I swear
I am everywhere

I lie to your face
But you must obey

A brand new black
A new kind of darkness
Reach from your mind
Into your soul
A shadow falls
Your life is in danger
And your whole world
Out of control
A brand new black
My new child of darkness
Caught in a trap
With no release
A shadow falls
The wings of a demon
You'll find no cure
For this disease

I'm hiding in the shadows
Always by your side
Drift into the twilight zone
Lost and all alone
Fading like a ray of light
Everything turns black
I am close you will see
The pure essence of me

I lie to your face
But you must obey

A brand new black
A new kind of darkness
Reach from your mind
Into your soul
A shadow falls
Your life is in danger
And your whole world
Out of control
A brand new black
My new child of darkness
Caught in a trap
With no release
A shadow falls
The wings of a demon
You'll find no cure
For this disease
