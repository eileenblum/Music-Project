We stand proud unbending
Troops march in surrounding us
Obsession in their eyes
We wonât fall, rebellion
All lined up on the wall
Weâre here to die

For a new age
We stand as one
And rise
Hear the call to arms
See the battle sign
Together we will ride or die
This must be the place
This is our time
Together we will spark the fire

You canât win, weâre legion
The will to fight day and night
Spreading the disease
We wonât fall rebellion
One by one, standing strong
Weâre here to die

For a new age
We stand as one
And rise
Hear the call to arms
See the battle sign
Together we will ride or die
This must be the place
This is our time
Together we will spark the fire

Hear the call to arms
See the battle sign
Together we will ride or die
This must be the place
This is our time
Together we will spark the fire

Hear the call to arms
See the battle sign
Together we will ride or die
This must be the place
This is our time
Together we will spark the fire
