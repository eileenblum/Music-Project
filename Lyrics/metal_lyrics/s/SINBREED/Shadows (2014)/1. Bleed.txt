So tired I live on the run
I need a place to stay
I left behind the ghosts of the past
Still got a bill to pay
My face adorning the streets
I am a wanted man
For a crime that I did commit
And never will regret

At night I hear the hounds - running wild and free
Once I was one of them - now they're hunting me

Trapped in fire burning rage - in a world of sin
Demons start to take control - let the games begin
Vengeance for what once befell - for your vicious deed
You can run but you can't hide - I will not rest till you bleed

This man all on his own
Was lost with empty hands
No one there to ask for the way
The shadows start to dance
In the sky and on his chest
A brightly shining star
It was the last for his eyes to see
This time he's gone too far

At night I hear the hounds - running wild and free
Once I was one of them - now they're hunting me

Trapped in fire, burning rage - in a world of sin
Demons start to take control - let the games begin
Vengeance for what once befell - for your vicious deed
You can run but you can't hide - I will not rest till you bleed

One by one night and day
Like a wolf to catch its prey
Feel the hounds behind my back
Get ready to attack
I can't stop I'll break the chain
I'll give you endless pain
A shiver running down my spine
Vengeance will be mine

One by One day and night
In the dark I steal your light
Whatever it will take to win
You'll pay for your sin
A burning heart and bleeding eyes
You're the devil in disguise
It's the last thing that I do
I'll be judging you

At night I hear the hounds - running wild and free
Once I was one of them - now they're hunting me

Trapped in fire burning rage - in a world of sin
Demons start to take control - let the games begin
Vengeance for what once befell - for your vicious deed
You can run but you can't hide - I will not rest till you bleed

Till you bleed
Till you bleed
Till you bleed
Till you bleed
