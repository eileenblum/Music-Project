Creep through the dead of night
Just like a ghost
The church bell sing a song
Of sorrow 'n pain
A cold wind from the north
Blowing in the streets
The funeral cortege
Makes it through the rain

Dead eyes
It's a trail of tears
Mad eyes
Feel the shiver of fear

Each night I'm trying to suppress
My endless hunger
Red sun is burning in my eyes
A futile fight
Each night I'm trying to resist
I'm going under
Each night again it takes control
The beast inside

I chase the light away
Pure evil yearn for the day
A shadow lives in my mind
The greatest fear of mankind

Who was the beggar and
Who was King?
I make no difference no
The dance of death
I'm counting down from ten
Go lock your door
The funeral cortege
Makes it through the rain

Dead eyes
It's a trail of tears
Mad eyes
Feel the shiver of fear

You feel my cold
Breath on your skin
If saint or sinner

You're all just
Candles in the wind
A fading light
You hide but shelter
Can't be found
I bring the winter
Each night again
It takes control
The beast inside

I chase the light away
Pure evil yearn for the day
A shadow lives in my mind
The greatest fear of mankind

The moon high in the sky
Wears black tonight
Shines down on twisted scenes
Of horror 'n pain
Still creeping through the
Dark just like a ghost
The funeral cortege makes it
Through the rain

Dead eyes
It's a trail of tears
Mad eyes
Feel the shiver of fear

I will go down in history
Years to remember
Make my way
Crossing land 'n sea
I search for blood
The century goes down in tears
No fame no splendor
The greatest plague a mystery
The wrath of god?

I chase the light away
Pure evil yearn for the day
A shadow lives in my mind
The greatest fear of mankind
