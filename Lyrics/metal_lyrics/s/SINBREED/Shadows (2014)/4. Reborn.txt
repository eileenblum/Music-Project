Too long I watched in silence
Watched my life passing by
Had faith in words
That once been said in vain
A kingdom of the heavens
Forgiveness of my sins
Such noble words
Been written in our past

Breaking out of my cage
My ears are deaf
To the pied pipers call
Find a new way to go
I break my agreement
And live on my own

Reborn in rage and ego
My chance has come at last
I'm burning down the bridges
To overrule my blinded past
Don't need no lord no master
I dump my crown of thorns
Never again I'll follow
Never again
I'm reborn

You see a world of darkness
Tell me to grow it out
By following
A bunch of hypocrites
But I see a light around me
And this is not divine
It's the power of the people
Who decide to live

Breaking out of my cage
My ears are deaf
To the pied pipers call
Find a new way to go
I break my agreement
And live on my own

Reborn in rage and ego
My chance has come at last
I'm burning down the bridges
To overrule my blinded past
Don't need no lord no master
I dump my crown of thorns
Never again I'll follow
Never again
I'm reborn

Breaking out of my cage
My ears are deaf
To the pied pipers tune
Find a new way to go
I break my agreement
And live on my own

Reborn in rage and ego
My chance has come at last
I'm burning down the bridges
To overrule my blinded past
Don't need no lord no master
I dump my crown of thorns
Never again I'll follow
Never again
I'm reborn
