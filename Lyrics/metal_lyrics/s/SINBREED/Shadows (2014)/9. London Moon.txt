London moon gives birth
To shadows on the street
A mural friend to meet
Or maybe not?
It's far too late, don't miss your
Departing train
I'm no good
Company tonight

My beauty is endlessly
No one can withstand
A picture to pay the price
No blood on my hands

My 'ol friend you want
To see inside my soul?
To many rumors
You just can't believe
Mysteries unveiled that scare
You to your bones
The devil looks
Straight to your eyes

My beauty is endlessly
No one can withstand
A picture to pay the price
No blood on my hands

You judged me unashamedly
It's not my fault
You've given birth, a sinner
Now face the sin

Good 'ol friend sit still
And see what you have done
Blood runs red
Just like the river Thames
London moon reflecting
The knife in my hand
My friend just see
What you've done

My beauty is endlessly
No one can withstand
A picture to pay the price
No blood on my hands

My beauty is endlessly
No one can withstand
A picture to pay the price
No blood on my hands
