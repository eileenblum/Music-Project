[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: T. NÃ¶ller, Flo Laurin]

I see a storm arise, I feel it in my veins.
My fate is calling me, and there's no place to hide.
Follow me, take my hand, I'm always by your side.
All together we will stand, we'll never step aside.
Behold the sky...

[Chorus:]
For all the world to see, the stars are rising high.
We see the worlds collide - we ain't gonna die (ain't gonna die).
The truth is written, you can run, but you can't hide.
You choose your destiny - we'll see when worlds collide.

I hear a thunder crash, the world around us dies.
Out of the battle rage a golden light appears.
Can't you see, choose your path, enlightened by the stars.
All together we will stand, when the worlds collide.
Behold the sky...

[Chorus:]
For all the world to see, the stars are rising high.
We see the worlds collide - we ain't gonna die (ain't gonna die).
The truth is written, you can run, but you can't hide.
You choose your destiny - we'll see when worlds collide.

Trapped inside, bound to flesh, we're waiting for the chance. (Revolution)
A sign of hope, out of the dark, that guides us on our way. (Guiding our way)
Behold! Awake! Did you see? The letters in the sky. (Revolution)
The place is here, when time has come. Judgement day is nigh. (Judgement day's nigh!)

[Chorus:]
For all the world to see, the stars are rising high.
We see the worlds collide - we ain't gonna die (ain't gonna die).
For all the world to see, the stars are rising high.
We see the worlds collide - we ain't gonna die (ain't gonna die).
The truth is written, you can run, but you can't hide.
You choose your destiny - we'll see when worlds collide.

When world's collide. When world's collide. When world's collide.
