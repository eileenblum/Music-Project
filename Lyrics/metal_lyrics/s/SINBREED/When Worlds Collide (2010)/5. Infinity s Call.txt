[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: T. NÃ¶ller, Flo Laurin]

Each day, when I awake, I'm longing for the night-time.
When darkness covers all the pain and horror we create.
Each night, when I'm asleep, I'm dreaming of a new day.
Dawn's rising sun reveals the surroundings we create.

[Bridge:]
Watching the sun go down and close my eyes to dream
I slip away - this dark blackened theme.

Is it you, are you there? You never gave an answer.
Too tired to explain. Don't you even give a care?
Each time, when I recall, I'm feeling so much stronger.
There's no one else to blame. I'll find the answers my own way.

[Bridge:]
Watching the sun go down and close my eyes to dream,
I slip away - this dark blackened theme.

[Chorus:]
A cold place - unsheltered - of bodies weak and half dead.
Crossing the borderline.
Infinity's calling.
The curtain - of the night - divides in choosing one side.
I'm feeling free to leave.
Infinity's call.

[Bridge:]
Watching the sun go down and close my eyes to dream,
I slip away - this dark blackened theme.

[Chorus:]
A cold place - unsheltered - of bodies weak and half dead.
Crossing the borderline.
Infinity's calling.
The curtain - of the night - divides in choosing one side.
I'm feeling free to leave.
Infinity's call.
