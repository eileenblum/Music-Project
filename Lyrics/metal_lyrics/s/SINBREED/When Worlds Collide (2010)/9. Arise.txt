[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: T. NÃ¶ller]

Watch the rising stars tonight
Illume the darkness, show the way out of this haze.
Today it's gonna be your day.
Come break your chains now.
Find your truth and shout it out.

Fly high to the sky.
Discover that you lived a lie (lived a lie).

[Chorus:]
Don't step aside.
The time has come tonight, fight hard to arise.
Truth is your guide.
You're strong enough to fight and bare the other side.
Arise!

Since the day that you are born you hear the voices
Calling for you every night.
Disarmed, you look back at your past and realize that
Ðll your effort's been in vain.

Fly high to the sky.
Discover that you lived a lie (lived a lie).

[Chorus:]
Don't step aside.
The time has come tonight, fight hard to arise.
Truth is your guide.
You're strong enough to fight and bare the other side.
Arise!

Fly high to the sky. Discover that you lived a lie (lived a lie).

[Chorus:]
Don't step aside.
The time has come tonight, fight hard to arise.
Truth is your guide.
You're strong enough to fight and bare the other side.
Arise!

[Chorus:]
Don't step aside.
The time has come tonight, fight hard to arise.
Truth is your guide.
You're strong enough to fight and bare the other side.
Arise!
