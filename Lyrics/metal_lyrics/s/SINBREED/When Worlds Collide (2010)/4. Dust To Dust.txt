[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: Flo Laurin, T. NÃ¶ller]

Below the surface of man vicious thoughts are rising within.
No matter who or what will involve you, at the end your recall's in vain.
You feel the scruples rising, dark shapes moving your feet.
A child alone, eyes deep like an ocean.
Your memories fading, frozen in time.

You're standing on a crossway, wondering where shall we go (...shall we go).
You're searching for the traces, guiding you on your way.

[Chorus:]
Dust to dust - it's the fate upon us all.
The life you have chosen, decide where to go.
Dust to dust - see the writing on the wall.
Behold, it's worth fighting, don't loose your belief.
Dust to dust - it's the fate upon us all.
It's your life, you better think twice.
Dust to dust...

You're scared of what will follow - burn in hell or the kingdom of light.
A secret world beyond all illusions.
You've build your own cage inside your soul.
You'll hide below the surface.
All of mankind's seed has been sown.
Harvest's kindness lies in your own hands.
Two empty streets, where will you go?

You are standing on a crossway, wondering where shall we go (...shall we go).
You are searching for the traces, guiding you on your way.

[Chorus:]
Dust to dust - it's the fate upon us all.
The life you have chosen, decide where to go.
Dust to dust - see the writing on the wall.
Behold, it's worth fighting, don't loose your belief.
Dust to dust - it's the fate upon us all.
It's your life, you better think twice.
Dust to dust...

This is the final call - a guidance's been unfold.
This is the final call - believe in what's been told.

You're standing on a crossway, wondering where shall we go (...shall we go).
You're searching for the traces, guiding you on your way.

[Chorus:]
Dust to dust - it's the fate upon us all.
The life you have chosen, decide where to go.
Dust to dust - see the writing on the wall.
Behold, it's worth fighting, don't loose your belief.
Dust to dust - it's the fate upon us all.
It's your life, you better think twice.
Dust to dust...
