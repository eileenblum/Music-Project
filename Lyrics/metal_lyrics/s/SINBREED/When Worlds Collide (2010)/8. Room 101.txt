[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: T. NÃ¶ller]

[Herbie]
You fear the thought.
Whenever the name is spoken,
Cold sweat runs down your neck.
One day, you're sure, they'll come for you
To take control of all your thoughts.

[Thomas]
All the hate - they always lead you.
Shown off the face for two minutes of hate.
You close your eyes and break up with them,
But the "televisor" never sleeps.

[Herbie]
On your way down the gait, emptiness fills your eyes.
The fear of the things to come, it's burning your mind.

[Thomas]
The darkness 'round you whispers, you never felt so lonely.
It's just one strike and all the truth will be there.
The door ahead is open.
The fear of thousands passing by.
And it gets you close - to Room 101. (To Room 1-0-1)

[Thomas]
Here they come - the party has send their.
Through control - to capture the felon.
The game has come to an early end.
You have lost the hide-and-seek.

[Herbie]
A cold cell - caught in a prison.
Didn't expect that this is the place...
That you've been dreaming of.
The place with no darkness...

[Thomas]
On your way down the gait, emptiness fills your eyes.
The fear of the things to come, it's burning your mind.

[Herbie]
The darkness 'round you whispers, you never felt so lonely.
It's just one strike and all the truth will be there.
The door ahead is open.
The fear of thousands passing by.
And it gets you close - to Room 101.

[Herbie &amp; Thomas]
On your way down the gait, emptiness fills your eyes.
The fear of the things to come, it's burning your mind.

[Chorus:]
The darkness 'round you whispers, you never felt so lonely.
It's just one strike and all the truth will be there.
The door ahead is open.
The fear of thousands passing by.
And it gets you close - to Room 101.

[Chorus:]
The darkness 'round you whispers, you never felt so lonely.
It's just one strike and all the truth will be there.
The door ahead is open.
The fear of thousands passing by.
And it gets you close - to Room 101
