[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: T. NÃ¶ller]

In the dark there is a place.
I'm hiding from the world to see.
The door is shut, sealed and locked,
So I'm trying to bury the key.

It's the dark side of the moon,
A shadow that no light can reach.
Behind the walls of sleep
I sometimes can take a look through the dark.

[Bridge:]
I'm afraid of what it seems to be.
I am lost inside this mystery.

[Chorus:]
A seed of evil is growing inside my mind.
The dark around me tells a tale of the night.
I slowly reach my self-built enemy line.
I raise my hand and I hope I can touch the light.

A ray of light is breaking through,
A sign of hope that warms my soul.
The shadows flee and once again
My mind is refilled by the light.

But sometimes it returns again,
I feel the darkness take control.
Lost inside this vicious curse,
An endless trip through the night.

[Bridge:]
I'm afraid of what it seems to be.
I am lost inside this mystery

[Chorus:]
A seed of evil is growing inside my mind.
The dark around me tells a tale of the night.
I slowly reach my self-buht.
I slowly reach my self-built enemy line.
I raise my hand and I hope I can touch the light.

[Chorus:]
A seed of evil is growing inside my mind.
The dark around me tells a tale of the night.
I slowly reach my self-built enemy line.
I raise my hand and I hope I can touch the light.
