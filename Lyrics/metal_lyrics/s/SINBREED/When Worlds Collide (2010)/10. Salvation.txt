[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: T. NÃ¶ller]

A call yells through the dark winter night, a burning desire.
Just one step and your home is in sight, a gently glowing fire.
With your smile the rising sun's breaking through, it's palming your face.
Since your return a golden light surrounds you, it lights up to the haze.

What is your secret?
What did you find outside?

[Chorus:]
Your eyes glow with a neoshine.
The exalted mien on your bright face is divine.
On your way you were searchinto find the core.

From the sky to the abyss of the sea,
Beyond the sun you have tried to find the key.
Far away, behind the frontiers of our mind,
You found salvation for mankind.

[Chorus:]
Your eyes glow with a neoshine.
The exalted mien on your bright face is divine.
On your way you were searching for the lore.
Always tried to find the core.

From the sky to the abyss of the sea,
Beyond the sun you have tried to find the key.
Far away, behind the frontiers of our mind,
You found salvation for mankind
