[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: Flo Laurin, T. NÃ¶ller]

Watch! Behold!
Sin's burning heart among the seeds of man.
Defenders of an unknown truth.
What is to come? All things undone? Never!
Many kings who came are gone, failing how to lead.
Blackened forecast has been told.
Thy conscience is clean? Sinner unseen? Never!

[Bridge:]
Reveal the fears and mysteries that fool your mind.
Don't wait to leave 'em all - the time has come.

[Chorus:]
We're heading North, are about to leave.
Come face your fear beneath.
A newborn tomorrow - starting from today.
We'll conquer all that lies ahead.
Won't regret the blood's been shed.
A newborn tomorrow - at the break of day.

None who is of woman born shall rule the life of man.
Bound in chains or free at will. Living a lie? All set do die? Never!
Time has come to raise thy head to overrule the past.
The chance is here, leave it all behind.
We will stand strong! Serve who has won! Prevail!

[Bridge:]
Reveal the fears and mysteries that fool your mind.
Don't wait to leave 'em all - the time has come.

[Chorus:]
We're heading North, are about to leave.
Come face your fear beneath.
A newborn tomorrow - starting from today.
We'll conquer all that lies ahead.
Won't regret the blood's been shed.
A newborn tomorrow - at the break of day.

[Bridge:]
Reveal the fears and mysteries that fool your mind.
Don't wait to leave 'em all - the time has come.

[Chorus:]
We're heading North, are about to leave.
Come face your fear beneath.
A newborn tomorrow - starting from today.
We'll conquer all that lies ahead.
Won't regret the blood's been shed.
A newborn tomorrow - at the break of day.

A newborn tomorrow - starting from today.
We'll conquer all that lies ahead.
Won't regret the blood's been shed.
A newborn tomorrow - at the break of day.

At the break of day... at the break of day.
