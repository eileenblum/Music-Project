[Music: Flo Laurin | Lyrics: T. NÃ¶ller, Flo Laurin]

Black is the night - you're on your own.
You're captured in a hollow cage.
Nowhere to run, the time stands still.
And your every dream has turned to dust.
What do you fear? You've been so strong!
No one could ever match with you.
Now feelings of guilt burn in your veins and shelter is nowhere in sight.

This unknown road you'll walk alone.

[Chorus:]
A golden light shines through the dark.
Make your step across the night.
The fear inside your soul, it's running through your veins.
Evil eye â never lie.
Face your fate, don't be afraid.
Finally you can't pretend to be someone else.

Alone at last there's no more fear.
Your life is flowing gently by.
You look to the sky, a shining star.
Your guide through the dark.

Lighter than air you leave your cage
To return into the holy light.
A part of the whole, you start the dance
To an endless melody.

This unknown road you'll walk alone.

[Chorus:]
A golden light shines through the dark.
Make your step across the night.
The fear inside your soul, it's running through your veins.
Evil eye â never lie.
Face your fate, don't be afraid.
Finally you can't pretend to be someone else.

This unknown road you'll walk alone.

[Chorus:]
A golden light shines through the dark.
Make your step across the night.
The fear inside your soul, it's running through your veins.
Evil eye â never lie.
Face your fate, don't be afraid.
Finally you can't pretend to be someone else.

[Chorus:]
A golden light shines through the dark.
Make your step across the night.
The fear inside your soul, it's running through your veins.
Evil eye â never lie.
Face your fate, don't be afraid.
Finally you can't pretend to be someone else.
