Time has come to leave my cave
Heading off to town
Left a flower at my father's grave
Waved the kids goodbye

Crossing night and day
To find our way

Conqueror - over land and see
Searching for a home
Where our people can be free
Go navigate - hoping we will find
Shelter and a place
Where we leave our past behind

Since the day that I was born
Always on the run
Made that promise to my only son:
You will live in peace

Crossing night and day
To find our way

Conqueror - over land and see
Searching for a home
Where our people can be free
Go navigate - hoping we will find
Shelter and a place
Where we leave our past behind

Conqueror - over land and see
Searching for a home
Where our people can be free
Go navigate - hoping we will find
Shelter and a place
Where we leave our past behind

Conqueror - over land and see
Searching for a home
Where our people can be free
Go navigate - hoping we will find
Shelter and a place
Where we leave our past behind
Where we leave our past behind
