To live on the edge of tomorrow
To live on the edge of tomorrow

The scene is set
You all know your role
An empty room - a shadow, almost dead

They all walked away
Left him all alone
It seems unfair - the bill he has to pay

They did lock the door
Blind eyes - cannot see
The nature of the son they loved before

What have I become?
I don't understand
A twist of fate - don't know what to do

A final breath and I will lay my weary head to rest
There is no time to mourn - It's all just for the best

See the creature fade away - Only memories remain
With the dawning of the day - Nothing ever stays the same
You will be free by today - To live on the edge of tomorrow

The tower clock strikes three
He found peace of mind
To free them from this curse and set them free

At the break of day
All the shadows flee
And with his soul all sorrow fades away

A final breath and I will lay my weary head to rest
There is no time to mourn - It's all just for the best

See the creature fade away - Only memories remain
With the dawning of the day - Nothing ever stays the same
You will be free by today - To live on the edge of tomorrow

See the creature fade away - Only memories remain
With the dawning of the day - Nothing ever stays the same
You will be free by today - To live on the edge of tomorrow
To live on the edge
