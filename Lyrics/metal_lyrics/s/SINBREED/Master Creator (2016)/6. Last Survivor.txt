At the stroke of midnight hour
A knocking broke the silence
Someone opened up the gate
A stranger came into our town
I watched it from my window
Feelin' that the end is nigh

I feel a shiver
Madness in your eyes
You want to burn
Our cities down - see blood red skies

You are the devil in disguise
Taking the world on and on
No witness - no survivor
You're on a killing spree
You are the devil in disguise
I won't look the other way
'til my final heartbeat
I will wait to see you pay
I'll fight for... Justice

Fragment of a broken dream
A life I once was living
Until he did cross my way
Pillars of smoke in the sky
My memories are fading
To me all white turned to black

I feel a shiver
Madness in your eyes
You want to burn
Our cities down - see blood red skies

You are the devil in disguise
Taking the world on and on
No witness - no survivor
You're on a killing spree
You are the devil in disguise
I won't look the other way
'til my final heartbeat
I will wait to see you pay
I'll fight for... Justice

You are the devil in disguise
Taking the world on and on
No witness - no survivor
You're on a killing spree
You are the devil in disguise
I won't look the other way
'til my final heartbeat
I will wait to see you pay
I'll fight for... Justice
Justice
