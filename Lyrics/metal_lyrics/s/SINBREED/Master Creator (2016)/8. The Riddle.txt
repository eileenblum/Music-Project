[The creature:]
Am I human, am I creature?
Am I made from flesh?
Am I crouching, am I crawling?
Faster than a flash?
Am I good or am I evil?
A child of the night?
Am I howling? Will I crush you
When you're in my sight?

[The victim:]
I can sense him in the dark, he is coming near
It paralyses all of me, I'm trembling in fear
Pestilence, it fills my lungs: The air that he just breathed
If only I could move again! If only I could leave!

[The creature:]
Do you wanna stay?
Come sit with me together, will you?
Do you wanna play?
A game of chance from ancient times
Come on and be brave
We will have fun together, trust me
You'll only risk your life
So would you tell me who I am

[The victim:]
Are you nameless, are you godless?
A coward of some sort?
You'll be punished for your deeds
By some higher force

[The victim:]
I can sense him in the dark, he is coming near
It paralyses all of me, I'm trembling in fear
Pestilence, it fills my lungs: the air that he just breathed
If only I could move again! If only I could leave!

[The creature:]
Do you wanna stay?
Come sit with me together, will you?
Do you wanna play?
A game of chance from ancient times
Come on and be brave
We will have fun together, trust me
You'll only risk your life
So would you tell me who I am

[The creature:]
Do I hunt down all your brothers?
Can I smell your fear?
Can I hear your heart beat wildly
Since you are so near?
Will I rip you into pieces
The second, that you turn?
Will I feast upon your bones
And make your soul burn?

[The victim:]
I can sense him in the dark, he is coming near
It paralyses all of me, I'm trembling in fear
Pestilence, it fills my lungs: the air that he just breathed
If only I could move again! If only I could leave!

[The creature:]
Do you wanna stay?
Come sit with me together, will you?
Do you wanna play?
A game of chance from ancient times
Come on and be brave
We will have fun together, trust me
You'll only risk your life
So would you tell me who I am
