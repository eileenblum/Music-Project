Hear the whispering in the air?
An icy wind fills the lair
A figure crouching on cold stone
Wounded, broken and left alone

Take my hand
Join me through this barren land
And leave, all your sorrows far behind
This final gate
Enter my realm and meet your fate

The creature tries to get back on its feet
Moving makes the wounds again start to bleed
The presence of something is here
A guardian angel or someone to fear?

It's coming closer, the air seems to compress
A gloomy portal appears
The world turns gray
The figure awakes and steps
Though torn inside - into the light

Take my hand
Join me through this barren land
And leave, all your sorrows far behind
This final gate
Enter my realm and meet your fate

Fly with me
Till the end of time
Eternity
Is within your reach just let your past life go
The price you have to pay is more than low

(Never look back and never return and)
(Never look back and never return and)
(Never look back and never return forever)
