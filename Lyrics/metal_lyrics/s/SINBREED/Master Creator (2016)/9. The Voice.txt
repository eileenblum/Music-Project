A red sun rises in the east
Before the purple sky turns blue
Signs of a bright day - it's easy living
The windy road below my feet
My teacher of a simple truth:
Simple things in life are those to share

Breaking out - aim higher
Set yourself on fire

I hear a voice in my head and in my heart
Getting louder day by day
It calls my name telling me to dare the start
To no longer stay a face in the crowd
I will stand for my beliefs - strong and proud

Never let the dreams of one
Other than yourself lead you
Never bow your head - fear no master
Deep inside you'll find the key
So all your wishes may come true
Don't betray yourself, find your own way

Breaking out - aim higher
Set yourself on fire

I hear a voice in my head and in my heart
Getting louder day by day
It calls my name telling me to dare the start
To no longer stay a face in the crowd
I will stand for my beliefs - strong and proud

With the final light of day
I hope that I stood strong and proud
More than just a face - in the crowd
'Til that day my good old friend
Let us be the ones who laugh
Let us be the giver, not the thief

Breaking out - aim higher
Set yourself on fire

I hear a voice in my head and in my heart
Getting louder day by day
It calls my name telling me to dare the start
To no longer stay a face in the crowd
I will stand for my beliefs - strong and proud
I will stand for my beliefs - strong and proud
I will stand for my beliefs - strong and proud
