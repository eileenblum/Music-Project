Another day was spend just counting time
Stealing the hours like a thief
I question everyone and everything
So why not start with your beliefs

Never free to let go
Never free of doubt
Hiding in the twilight
A silent shout

Wear your mask, hide your feelings
Sad clowns behind our painted smile
Wear your mask, hide your demons
Still a longing to find your way

Searching for meaning in this troubled times
Searching for signs or for your guide
The day is nigh when you will have to choose
The way to light or endless night

Never free to let go
Never free of doubt
Hiding in the twilight
A silent shout

Wear your mask, hide your feelings
Sad clowns behind our painted smile
Wear your mask, hide your demons
Still a longing to find your way
To find your way

Never free to let go
Never free of doubt
Hiding in the twilight
A silent shout

Wear your mask, hide your feelings
Sad clowns behind our painted smile
Wear your mask, hide your demons
Still a longing to find your way

The day is nigh when you will start to see
Discern the signs that guide you through
Maybe you find some place to rest your head
Some kind of home, but I have not

Never free to let go
Never free of doubt
Hiding in the twilight
A silent shout

Wear your mask, hide your feelings
Sad clowns behind our painted smile
Wear your mask, hide your demons
Still a longing to find your way
To find your way
