Since the day that you are born
Questions on your mind
A burning needle - terrifying
You stumble day and night

You will find truth in history
Close your eyes and start to see
One thing you need to know - it's a lie

Truth is all around
Truth is to be found
Sacrifice your life and hope one day you'll find
A truth that's worth to slave away
Truth is in the air
Truth is everywhere
Sacrifice your life to write it down and share
The truth that will light up your day

Are there answers to be found?
Guidance for your life?
A revelation - one belief?
It's cutting like a knife

You will find truth in history
Close your eyes and start to see
One thing you need to know - it's a lie

Truth is all around
Truth is to be found
Sacrifice your life and hope one day you'll find
A truth that's worth to slave away
Truth is in the air
Truth is everywhere
Sacrifice your life to write it down and share
The truth that will light up your day
