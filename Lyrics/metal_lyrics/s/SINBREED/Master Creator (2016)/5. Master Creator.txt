Trapped in this nightmare
Trapped in my mind
Hunted by ghosts of the night
A sound behind my back, scared to turn my head
The world turned upside down - alive or am I dead?

See the sunrise, see the dawn of day
Save from danger, chase the night away

You are the master creator
In your mind lies the power to create
A world where nothing can harm you
It is real you're the master of our fate

Vision unveiling
Visions that show
Shadows that flee from the light
A world in front of me, where I can rest my head
Nothing left to fear - the world of freedom's spread

See the sunrise, see the dawn of day
Save from danger, chase the night away

You are the master creator
In your mind lies the power to create
A world where nothing can harm you
It is real you're the master of our fate

See the sunrise, see the dawn of day
Save from danger, chase the night away

You are the master creator
In your mind lies the power to create
A world where nothing can harm you
It is real you're the master of our fate
You are the master
