A riot in the streets
We hold our freedom high
You never will succeed
And we never back down

Did you really think
We will buy your lies?
You brought us to the brink
We will never back down

Follow us my friend
We will make a change
For all the world to know
We will make a stand

We'll take you - no hiding
We'll break you - now the time is right

See the bridge that cracks the sky
Across the great divides
That are build inside your mind
Don't back down
You will have to choose a side
Humility or pride
Close your eyes and see the light
Don't back down

We turned it upside down
There's chaos in the air
The king has lost his crown
We will never back down

Stand with open arms
Shelter can be found
No hatred and no harms
'Cuz we never back down

We the people stand
As one and raise our voice
For all the world to know
This is our time

We'll take you - no hiding
We'll break you - now the time is right

See the bridge that cracks the sky
Across the great divides
That are build inside your mind
Don't back down
You will have to choose a side
Humility or pride
Close your eyes and see the light
Don't back down

The curtain is falling
Your drama comes to an end
The curtain is falling
It's time this tragedy ends tonight

We'll take you - no hiding
We'll break you - now the time is right

See the bridge that cracks the sky
Across the great divides
That are build inside your mind
Don't back down
You will have to choose a side
Humility or pride
Close your eyes and see the light
Don't back down
