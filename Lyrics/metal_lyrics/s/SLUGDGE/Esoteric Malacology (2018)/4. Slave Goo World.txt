Stygian minions of esteemed erudition
bear witness to the most abject human condition
staunch technicians of decomposition
breathing life into the lifeless animating his vision
all partake in occult calibration
realigning the ley-slime for the dark invocation
sing on high to the lords long unspoken
Reborn into the world through the minds of his chosen

Psychic virus from the vast outer reaches
marks the grand unification of science and religion
In the name of our brethren; the molluscs
lesser lifeforms prostrate before the horror of horrors
terrible vistas of a nihilistic future
the old cthonic scriptures; the new jurisprudence
to usher an era of grand cosmic culture
all nations and worlds under the sign of mollusca

Submit your soul, for it's no use to you where you go
Beyond the passage of time
Embrace the void in which all things were made and destroyed
we shall be one in his mind

Praise be the name of the dark incarnate
Great beast of the all-in-one
First of the gods from the formless chaos
Kindling the flame of the suns

His children most resplendent and pure
shall inherit the order of worlds
From the lowest dominion unto the mucus throne
that this kingdom might ever endure

cast off the flesh become one with the ooze
and through the god-mind what's broken is renewed
