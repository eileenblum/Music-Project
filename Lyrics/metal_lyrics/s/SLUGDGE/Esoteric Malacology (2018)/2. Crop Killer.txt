Is this how you want to live your lives?
inside the vultures circle
can you feel the talons in your neck?
Only the strong survive you say?
Just pray that prey you don't become
You've got no time for safety nets

There are no alpha wolves
Only those struggling to survive the state of nature
Domestic animals lost without the trappings of their civilization
You like to play armchair eugenicist, militant pessimist
An ivory tower that's built upon
the product of a million labors

Regression to the mean, repression of the weak
fraudulent pyramid scheme of human hierarchy

Do you ever wonder why you've been deprived
the wealth of nations?
do you feel the trickle down your leg?
Preoccupied with war against your own and your own home
How is it you're not already dead?

Another failed experiment
Evidence suggests you will not pass the last great filter
The soldiers won't defend the hive
when the queen neglects to satisfy the builders
You like to play the devil's advocate, passive and impotent
brood over fallen empires
That were built upon the bones of millions

Narrow minded sanctimonious
self-serving sophistry
Greed governing holiness?
Not in the version I have seen.

You will not see the stars
doomed to the tides
access denied, fated to die
