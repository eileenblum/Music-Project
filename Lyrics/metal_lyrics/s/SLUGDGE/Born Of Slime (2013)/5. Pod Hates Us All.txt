Space and time are open to he 
who has seen this entity 
jibbering gelatinous mass 
of puss and mucus from beyond the stars 
who feeds on chaos 

Sluglord of the deep, send your slime to me 

Slippery gateways to the darkest recesses 
of hell, accessed through the book of slugs 
Incantations summon a visage of the Greatfather 
Appeasable by human slaughter 

Slugs in eyes, Human lies, Everyone; a slug in disguise 

From the Garden known as Slish comes the harbinger of doom 
Oh great old slug of war, breaching his cocoon 

Fear and loathing will take hold, Behold the Lords of old 

Now you witness their true form 
For you know not what to do 
For in slime you were not born... 

Mollusks erupt from moonlit barrows 
Blighting the land; now rendered hollow 
There no stopping this evil 
Draping the world in endless shadow
