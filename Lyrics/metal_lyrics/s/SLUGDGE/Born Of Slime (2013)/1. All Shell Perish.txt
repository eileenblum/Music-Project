Beyond batrachian bulwarks, before the black gates 
The great one lies dormant, forever he waits 

Descend upon the cavern of the gods of sloth 
a tidal wave of blackened froth, beneath the permafrost 

Trapped in worlds of chaos long lost 
Bathing in our fear 

His festering hordes amass upon the spire of ick 
To break the will of human kind, condemn them to the pit 

Hunter of the shadow follow him into the deep 

Cursed fiends infiltrate your dreams 
Psychic screams from the world beneath 
Sweat and tears saturating your pain 
as the unholy father drains the blood from your veins 

Blighted king, low upon the mucus throne, underground
