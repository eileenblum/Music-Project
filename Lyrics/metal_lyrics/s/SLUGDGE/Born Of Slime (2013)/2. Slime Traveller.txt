Wasteland stretching endless miles 
What we've left behind. 
Nothing but the sound of solitary slithers. 
Born of slime. 

From the barren earth so deep 
They awakened beneath 
With their brethren infused 
Rivers flow with corrosive ooze 

Upon the path of the Greatfather 
He who dwells without a spine 
Follow in his viscous wake 
Back through time. 

Cowardly are they, the mollusks that dwell in shells 
For they hath not the father's grace 

Heretics and worms, they shall be cast down 
Into the compost where woodlice weap 
Slugs don't sleep, we walk forever over slime 
They will answer for their crimes
