Disgusting slaves procreate 
Outnumber masters 10 to 1 
Spreading like the caustic flame 
Wandering plague, dissent among the wavering 
humans, on the distant horizon lies their fate 

Devouring whole plantations, pillaged; stranglehold 
War of attrition for eternity 
Deplete their means to exact this wanton greed 
But the slimebrothers saw not their doom 

War begins, a maelstrom of suffering 
Blood congeals in translucent slime 
Under the beating sun, the fallen desiccate as one 
In death these ancient foes unite 

Invertalords call upon such vile forms 
as arachnids that creep across the redskyrock 
Centipedes from the teeming forests bleed 
out from the barrows into fields of salt 

Descend the flying fiends, 
Vassals of Greatfatherâs power 
Marshalled as one, to drive man out 

The battle rages on in vain 
unwinnable stalemate 

Speaking barbaric tongues to their cohorts on the flanks 
Morale is broken in our ranks 

The humans spring their final trap 
their victory close at hand.. 

Failure, defeat, what seemed like victory 
Locked beneath in frost we sleep 

We won't sleep forever, we shall rise again 

Cloudbreak on the killing fields 
the light returns as dark receeds 
The dead ascend and slugs decay 
The dawn of mankinds finest day
