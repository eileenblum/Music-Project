Nothing but dust and shadows 
weaving the firmament 
winds of creation breathed into an inanimate universe 
Darkness and chaos folding 
Matter negates the void 
Igniting the stars to build his infinite elemental forge 

Fusion binds, feed him life 
Endless process, ever hungry 

We are but figments of his imagination unbound 
Man is the excess, there is the meaning in his grand design 

Sliming across the cosmos 
Painted in flame and frost 
birthing malformed creations; sentinals of the elder god 
Nuclear force unravelling 
The art of destruction born 
For all things that live must die, unbroiled in the sempiternal war

Crumbling foundations, a species undermining 
the order of the creator 
Consciousness a curse of flesh 
Send the Schistastomes a plague of death 

Knowledge feeds their human needs, but they were not meant to venture far 
Blind their eyes from these forbid words, show them not reality 

Trembling now in the countenance of the Prince of slime 
subject to the ever scrutinizing eye
