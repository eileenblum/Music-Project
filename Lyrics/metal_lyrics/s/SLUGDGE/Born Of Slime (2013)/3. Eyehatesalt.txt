Cruel weapons of the human bastard 
sprinking death from up on high 
Eyestalks recoiling as my slime trail foams 
choking on the crystals in my pneumastome 

Bleak. 

Inhumane, dessicated and debased 
Baking in the scorching sun, their time will come 
Mucus glands, bubbling on the concrete slabs 
Eaten by domestic cats, but we'll be back 

Foolish mortals in the garden lay 
bathing in the shade we wait 
beady eyes emerge, focusing our wrath 
vengeance rides on slimey tracks 

Raining acid, caustic downpour on human skulls 
melting flesh from bones 

Ruthless minions, revolution in human culls 
venting hatred ages old 

And when the dawn of slime comes, they shall reap what they have sown
