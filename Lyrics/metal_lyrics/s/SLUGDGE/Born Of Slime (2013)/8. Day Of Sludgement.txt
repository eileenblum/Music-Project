Acrid scents arise from the foliage, blackest death 
From my window I gasp in awe as I gaze at them 

Under the blood green moon, discoloured, vile 
They assimilate into my nightmares 
Oh and as they slither across my mind 
they plant their seeds for our worlds domination 

The end is near, a trail of mucus laced with fear 
has slimed across the earth, heralding his rebirth 
The lord of plagues, this puss we spew has paved the way 
for the second coming of the one true Pod 

Hell hath no fury like a mollusk scorned, you've been warned 
Their jaws, shall open wide and devour this world, heed these words 

From the pits of Kak he rises and consumes 
The virgin's blood; upon the altar of shrooms 

Vociferus one, infernal god 
whose giant foot blackens the sun 

Into the black pools of the Ick, his supplicants descend 
To be born again, knowing life without end
