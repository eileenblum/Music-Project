In cold recesses of infinite time
I have slept beneath the grime
then from the surface world 
came to me with prying hands
and plucked me from the sand

Dissect my body in search of power
clandestine secrets of the shell
Intrigued by my longevity
in an environmental hell

My smashed and broken form shall give rise
to horrors undreamt of by the mind

Alive since time immemorial
to be dredged from our home
I shall not relinquish the secrets of the slime
they are mine, and mine alone

500 years existed, dormant, and without a care
Free from the tyranny of air
Witnessed the rise the fall of Empires from beneath the waves
and seen my slimebrethren enslaved

Suddenly man takes an interest in me; i'm swept up and caged

Probed and desecrated, left to bake out in the sun
They shall suffer for their wrongs

For a thousand aeons
We have havested the souls
of much greater things than you
In the end my death
shall be a sacrifice
In the service of his truth.
