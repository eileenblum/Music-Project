At the end of days, circling a bloated sun
Cast adrift within an endless vacuum
Interordinal hybridization
of brobdingnagian creation

From this dias he reigns
Horror Unchained
Ever growing, larger and larger
drinking deep of the ceaseless slaughter
Feasting upon his sons and daughters

All hail the Greatfather, the King.
and the dark pods eternal.

Mucus from the poison abyss
enthroned in the putrescent Gardens of Slish
beyond the black gulf of unending time
hideous nebulae woven in slime

Reborn of the ooze, brought back, exhumed from gravities tomb
captive by the force of ten thousand stars
his fury for aeons confined to the dark

Harvester of the cosmic sea
nourishing his eternity

and when all is gone, and the boundaries melt
he hangs in the heavens devouring himself
in the chaos of this transformation
metaphysical annihilation

as his power wanes
energies dissipate
ever falling, farther and farther
in the heart of his collapsing structure
igniting a seed of another Mollusca
