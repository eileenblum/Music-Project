Salt and copper, impenetrable walls
destined to drown in alcohol
forever endangered by dessication
He now bears witness to their indignation

Melding together, the fusing of flesh
A taste of the agony that awaits beyond death
eldritch monster, many now one
cellular mitosis enriched by the sun
a metamorphosis that cannot be undone

To overcome adversity sacrifices must be made
We adapt or we die, no escape, life is pain.

Not of this world, borne of black magic
from daemoniac realms

Hybrid mutation of sentient slime
defying the odds in a bid to survive.
