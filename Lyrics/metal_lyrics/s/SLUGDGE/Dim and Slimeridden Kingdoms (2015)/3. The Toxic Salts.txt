Maledictions spoken aloud from the slime-ridden scriptures
pages of abject text which eyes cannot decipher
strange visions appear in the poisonous fire

Payments paid in the blood of batrachian slaves cast into seering vats
Arise, luminous beings of vapour
now thralls in the servitude of the betrayer 

Kneeling in murky waters, the soul now clean
Baptised and reborn; his blood runs green

Sanity fades and reality melts away, before the gates of our lord
Tendrils emerge from an ocean of darkness, dragging his soul into the void

Take the ichor, the bitter taste of corruption
exist as an abomination
Until the death of the universe

A god amongst men all alone in his head
The same, yet alien, alone in the end, the king of the dead, the god amongst men

Elation marred by the realisation
Immortality has become a curse
a god desires nothing
for divinity is hell in the minds of the living

Once more into the breach; gazing deep beyond the tides of oblivion
where the fundaments dance to the tune of gargantuan tenebrous gods

Crystalline sprites now forming before him
attemping to show him the mind of Mollusca
all spectrums of light visible in the scrying
confounded by new found perspectives on dying.
