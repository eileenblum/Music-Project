Forgotten unconcious ghosts of aeons lay 
In chasms cold as the deepest grave 
A charnel cosmic wind, dispenses his judgement 
upon any and all who would dare to challenge fate 

An end as certain as the setting sun 
A desolation frozen in time 
For there is no everflowing stream 
Peasants rot beside their kings 

Lord Bothris; he who answers to no-one 
for in the end, his will alone shall be done 
His patience; as infinite as the stars 
The reaper of the harvest of the uncreated Pod 

Prince of death, I await the final test 
Grant me access to the fruits of Eden 

Bathe in the seas of Vlekt at the foot of the master 
Imbibe the slime, forever after 

The quest for knowledge, unquenchable thirst 
Praying for life eternal in this finite universe 

Raptured, are they who bask in his goo 
as their physical bodies are consumed 

Shifting through an ocean of the dead, amidst the skeletal remains 
carrion he devours to nenew his father's form 

From out of chaos comes a new order 
decomposer of the flesh, preparing for the end 
Recycled in the heavens as on earth 
a rebirth of the material world
