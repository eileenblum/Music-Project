"Civilisation", like locusts clad in suits they come 
with their manifests in hand, engineered to corrupt 
Machinations made to denude our mother's blood 
grow their spawn upon the graves 
where once our fallen brother's stood 

Idiotic selfish ambition of humanity 
Narcissistic notions of transcending mortality 
Far from K-selected, slaves to their defective prosencephalon 
subject to morbid obsession with armageddon 

Technopathic necromancers do their worst 
Nirate fixated posthuman filth of an abhorrent birth 
Sowing terror, they only see death in the dirt 
Ignorant to truth that it's the lifeblood of the earth 

Systematic violence, conspiracy of silence, a biocide 
Human interaction engineers disaster for all life 
desperate to escape the existential pain of their intellect 
Ready to eject and leave this place in search of death 

Learn to hear but not to look, to glimpse his mind is to self destruct 
The fruit is ripe but it tastes of ash, there are some questions you should never ask
