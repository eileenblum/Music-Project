Agrarian world bathed in blood from ages past 
Fixated and strangulated 
this twisted seed, a bastard breed 
Sewn for surplus 
Sustaining domination through extraction 
a policy of scorched earth, imitating wilderness 

In disgust we have judged the propagator of this disease 
Life undone, a broken trust, they've made a desert and called it peace 

Strangling hold, so called fields of gold 
as far as the eyes can see 
What you call life, I call blight, and it must end 
For earth to breathe 

Poisonous streams 
bathed in tears, cascade into an airless void 
Faded and irradiated 
feed death machines, such boundless greed 
Desalinated, a fool's gambit 
Their last defense is now removed 
The slow march of death begins 
This silence heralds the coming of their doom 

Trapped in a spiral of supply and demand 
Feeding new mouths to in time work this land 
at the crack of the whip they will dance to the tune 
of the lies made by the madmen who extract and consume 

Whose tombs are lined with their gold yet are buried in the sludge 
of a hewn and exploited world. 

Dark below where no light lies, shifting under iron hides 
final bastion of the deep, taken to extremes 

Without the sun, they can endure, devourers of flame and stone 
Mankind is weak; susceptible
