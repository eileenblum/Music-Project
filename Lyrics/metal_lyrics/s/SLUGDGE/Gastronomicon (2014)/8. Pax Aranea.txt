Mucus trail of viscous rime 
Into her woven halls 
Her children, cover the walls, 
Watched by ten thousand eyes. 

a vision of the second war 
Ancient Arch-Arachnid 
vengeance upon mankind 
born within silk and viscous slime 
she has foreseen the human's end 
within the web of space and time 
Darkened hordes coating cities 
feasting upon their feeble minds. 

Unfurling fangs that drip with toxic lust 
Reduce the body into dust 
Weaving window of reclusive dark 
Who stops the beating of your heart 

Sprinting forth upon ancient legs 
As though their prey has come 
Matriarch will hear the terms 
Word of a second war.. 

Mandibles clicking, omnivenom dripping.. 

Too long she's lingered within her silken bastille 
psychic screams of hate 
Echo across the universe.
