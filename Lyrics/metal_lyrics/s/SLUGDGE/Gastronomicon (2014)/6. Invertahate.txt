A dark, defiling spectre from the wastes 
Horrendous terror from the Tundras of Eurgh 
His fringe encrusted with adamantine plates 
A dripping maw of molten obsidian 

The Grand Vizier to the Sultan of slime 
Beholder of he whose face is the void 

His name; profane, the slug of revelation 
his radula swallowing galaxies whole 
Insane, derranged, personified negation 
Drags infidels into the blackest of holes 

Rhaexorog the lord of all protector of what lies beyond 
the greatest of the chosen ones, anointed of the netherslugs 
For us to see his glistening skin is to know true pain within the flames 
ejected from his pneumastome, defender of the Mucus Throne. 

For mortals cannot leave behind, their coils within this place confined 
A paradise you'll never know, for death is all the future holds 

The Great Attractor of outer dark 
Awaits beyond the light of the brightest stars 
For an eternity his hunger grows 
From spheres of chaos in the vast unknown 

For war, for plague, famine and death 

His tendrils stretched innumerable prongs 
that rip and tear apart the fabric of worlds 
depraved, his lust for annihilation 
reduce star systems into ashes and dust 

Voracious appetite for deconstruction 
Fear the shaker of foundations 

Harbinger of shadow show me the endless void 
where all is sorrow when there is nought left to destroy..
