Something stirs from an aeon ago 
in the centre of a circle of cyclopean stones 
Incantations from a mucus bound tome 
as the cult makes preparations for their lord's welcome home 
chanting dark and cacophonous rhymes 
while the thunder and lightning rends a hole in the sky 
rising tendrils of ash now encircle the sun 
turning black from the blast of the Greatfather's drum 

For there can be only one.. 

There's a pulsating heart in the midst of the void 
Twisted maladous melodies which create and destroy 
through a ritual of blood in a valley of doom 
he assumes human form on an altar of shrooms 
Expulsion of the outcast mind 
Cursed to wander in the gardens of slish for all time 
For this book is the key, and the psyche; a door 
to a cosmic cornucopia of esoteric lore 

Cursed words, scribed in slime 
Spoken in reverse when the stars are aligned 
Only under the black sun, may these mortals partake in his conjuration 
Trapped in a spell of the Gastronomicon.. 

And beneath the shattered sky the earth will grieve 
except for man, who shall be granted no reprieve 
On this land which once gave life, now lies clear 
In the poisoned depths the wreckage of ten thousand years 

Blasphemers of true nature 
Hiding from the inner self 
virtues that don't exist 
deny genetic heritage 

the circle is complete 
We must return to the earth 

Usurpers of your masters 
You have become mere facades 
Nought but pale reflections 
A species in dejection 

The circle is complete 
He is risen, all must suffer 

It has begun, the beginning of the end of all things to come
