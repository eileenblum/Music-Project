Starship Earth: five billion years 
Life support malfunction 
Wreckage adrift in outer space 
Population: zero 

Desecrate, contaminate, erase 
This twisted race 
Torture earth, kill the seas and poison space 
compelled by wretched faith 
remains, we pray for him to rise again 
and cleanse this land 
Humanity will pay for its sins.. 

Life remains, despite mankind 
In the seeping hollows 
Slithering through endless depths 
Dreaming dark designs. 

Swimming through the void, the netherslug observes 
and bides his time... 

Gazing over the pages of forbidden lore 
Speaking in ancient dead tongues 

Opening portals to realms beyond the conscious mind 
Unlocked through maddening songs
