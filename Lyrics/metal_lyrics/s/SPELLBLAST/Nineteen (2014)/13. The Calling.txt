The sound of the waves
Woke me up before it was too late
The moon shone,
And shadows laid down to me
Suddenly, a confused question
Got off to a frenzied cruel fight

It seems a door
A passage to another world
He's a slave
Bounded by invisible chains
A dark curse lays upon me
His brother's path
Will lead him to death

[BRIDGE]
Pulled up from his white past
I'll give him one more chance
Teaching him to fight
The Tower we'll reach

[CHORUS]
I don't shoot with my hand
My eyes take the right aim
'Cause I've not forgot my father's face

I don't kill with guns
But now I know
I kill with my heart

The second one
Has the fire inside
A flame that burns
Divided in two different parts
Two souls are sharing the same identity
Quite and wrath
There are two sides of the same dangerous coin

[BRIDGE]
Pulled up from her black past
I'll give her one more chance
Teaching her to fight
The Tower we'll reach

[CHORUS]
I don't shoot with my hand
My eyes take the right aim
'Cause I've not forgot my father's face

I don't kill with guns
But now I know
I kill with my heart

This I've learned
I don't shoot with my hand
My eyes take the right aim
'Cause I've not forgot his face

[Solo]

[CHORUS 2]
Vengeance has been found
Behind the third door
Justice has been done
A train like a bullet
Has put the end to his treacherous life
A new entity has revealed itself

This I've learned

[CHORUS]
I don't kill with my hand
My eyes take the right aim
'Cause I've not forgot my father's face

I don't kill with guns
But now I know
I kill with my heart
Of a gunslinger
