Blue coffin on their hands, mark of loyalty
To a king without crown
With terror and fear they rule,
Hunters with a plan
Buried deep in the ground

Puppet of the crimson king
Banished from his land
Seeking for his revenge,
Painful memories

[CHORUS]
Scourged by his own father
Marked for life in flash and soul
Taken the long way to West, he rode

A past that comes back,
Like a never ending curse,
Gnaw his destiny.
It's time to put an end to this,
Feeling of disgrace and claw back the honor

Puppet of the crimson king,
Banished from his land
Seeking for his revenge,
Painful memories

[CHORUS]
Scourged by his own father
Marked for life in flash and soul
Taken the long way to West he rode

[Solo]

[CHORUS]
You followed the train of exiled
Deserving to be a gunslinger,
Only a skillful mercenary man

You have made a deal with the witch
The dazed pink globe have to protect
In this blindfolding castle's game,
There will be no win
Just a pillar of flames that burns
Beneath the demon's moon
