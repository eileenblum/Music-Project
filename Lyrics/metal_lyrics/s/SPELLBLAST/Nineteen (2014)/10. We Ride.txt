We've planned to destroy
This golden cage
We have to rescue
The last surviving vector

A place fortified
Like an old time prison
Protected by
A garrison of freak creatures

A power fed by
Young kids'minds
Drained out their life
They turn into empty dumb shells

We've annihilated the mechanical horde
Now it's time to sweep them out

[CHORUS]
We ride towards,
The end of the worlds
Fire around us
Burns this bloody dawn
And cleanse their sins
Now carry on
This place will blow
Crimson king's menace
Will threaten this land no more

The last feeble string
That holds up our reality
Is going to be cut by
Blood red wicked blade

A silent cry from
A world that's moved on
Has summoned up
The last real knights

Taking the field
One more time
With a bad feeling

After this battle
Nothing will be the same
Void in our soul
We've answered the call

[CHORUS]
We ride towards,
The end of the worlds
Fire around us
Burns this bloody dawn
And cleanse their sins
Now carry on
This place will blow
Crimson king's menace
Will threaten this land no more

[Solo]

[BRIDGE]
Laying on the ground
His destiny he's found
The gunslinger on his knees
Has fallen for the last time

He's walking to the clearing
At the end of his path
He will wait us all over there

[CHORUS]
We ride towards,
The end of the worlds
Fire around us
Burns this bloody dawn
And cleanse their sins
Now carry on
This place will blow
Crimson king's menace
Will threaten this land no more

Now carry on
This place will blow
Crimson king's menace
Will threaten this land no more
