Finally I've come to the end
Tower's calling me
The sound of the horn filled the air
And suddenly there was silence

One step inside the great hall,
Nineteen to my birth,
Two dreadful eyes shine forever with hate

The crimson king has lost his final battle
We've won against his bombs
With blood and spittle
Erased from this land
Lost in the void
Exiled in space, between the out worlds

Now, the Tower is opening to me
Running after my past
I keep on repeating to myself
This is the end

All the sacrifices were done
Only to come to you
The dusk and the dawn of my life
Are only a gift for you

Thirty-eight rooms to the youth,
That's a so short time,
After that only a scent of death remains

The crimson king has lost his final battle
We've won against his bombs,
With blood and spittle
Erased from this land
Lost in the void
Exiled in space, between the out worlds

Now the Tower is opening to me
Running after my past
I keep on repeating to myself
This is the end

All the sacrifices were done
Only to come to you
The dusk and the dawn of my life
Are only a gift for you.

Now sunlight is leading my way
Up to the top
Tower, hear my voice well
I finally come

Last carved door has open wide
On my destiny
A new journey now will follow
This is not the end,
Not yet
