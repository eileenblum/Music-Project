World had moved on, hunt has begun
The wizard cross desert had fled
Another camp fire, may he expires
No other trace had left behind
Far on the horizon, no smoke is rising
My prey is cunning, that's sure
Hard is the soil, sharpen the wind
But nothing can drain my thirst of revenge

[CHORUS]
When sun goes down,
Demons come to life from devil-grass
Indulging memories,
While present slowly fades away

In the heart of the mountains,
The oracle's waiting
My body the prophecy has paid
Lust and illusion, my mind in confusion
The magic circle fades
On the iron way, with mutants we stay
A putrid dark glow in the night
A terrible choice, my fate is ahead
Other worlds wait in the dark

[CHORUS]
When sun goes down,
Demons come to life from devil-grass,
Indulging memories,
While present slowly fades away.

[Solo]

[CHORUS 2]
Years have gone,
The Tower waits for me somewhere to West
Lonely but not alone,
My journey will someday reach the end
