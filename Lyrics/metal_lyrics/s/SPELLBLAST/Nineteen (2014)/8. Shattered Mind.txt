Mistake or twist of fate?
A title you can't translate
"Please enter the code"
From afar terror runs,
Swallowing endless plains
"Re-enter the code"
Avoided the burning flames
Nineteen in his name
"Thanks for the code"
Jumped back to past time
The bookman must be fine
Dreaming the rose

[CHORUS]
Voices, flash across my head
And bounce into my mind
Running, lost in space and time
I search a shelter for my soul
Close to oblivion

Silver moon is shining bright
Four corpses lie aside
"please enter the code"
A voice from inside
Nineteen wasn't right
"Re-enter the code"
Countdown is going fast
Ninety-nine make me pass
"Thanks for the code"
Twenty-one eyes on the world
The knowledge it can afford
Betrayers are coming, above!

[CHORUS]
Voices, flash across my head
And bounce into my mind
Running, lost in space and time
I search a shelter for my soul
Close to oblivion

Three voices scream against the demon's one
Will of the mother's easily overcoming

Fragments of memories
Broken soul is trying to gain control
'Cross the dark halls of its conscience

Voices come lost in space and time
A shelter for my mind while sinkin' into oblivion
