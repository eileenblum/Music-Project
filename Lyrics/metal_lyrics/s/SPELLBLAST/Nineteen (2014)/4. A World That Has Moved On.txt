Ruled by the words of a god,
A loud beat command to spill blood.
His voice is coming from high,
Speakers tell it's time for sacrifice

Built by the ancients
When magic was called science

[CHORUS]
The world has moved on
Disease and mutations made it falling apart
Moved on
Now we go along the dark path of our doom
The dark Tower

Survived from a deadly ride
A crash has put an end to its life
Mr. Riddle has lost its fight
Its mechanical brain was not so bright

Built by the ancients
When magic was called science

[CHORUS]
The world has moved on
Disease and mutations made it falling apart
Moved on
Now we go along the dark path of our doom
The dark Tower

[BRIDGE:]
Vectors and guardians
Demons and guns

Vectors and guardians
Demons and guns

[CHORUS]
The world has moved on
Disease and mutations made it falling apart
Moved on
Now we go along the dark path of our doom

The world has moved on
Disease and mutations made it falling apart
Moved on
Now we go along the dark path of doom
The dark Tower
