Wearing it's the journey of your life
Pain and sacrifice came with you
Bloody tears and death collected
In your cold broken heart

You betrayed your beloved son's trust,
The one who was already dead once.
You also lied to yourself,
A quest that never ends

In your dreams
Red roses lay beneath
The shadow of the Tower
Touches your soul and heals your will.
For your sins
No chance to be forgiven
Just hope to find a deserved peace
In an endless sleep
But the sunlight is waking you.

Can't count the times you took the field
Two great old guns by your side
Restless fights weakened your tired limbs
Three fingers left on the sand

While consumed by a silent disease
You've never talked about it
Those weights have almost overwhelmed you,
Never thought about surrender

In your dreams
Red roses lay beneath
The shadow of the Tower
Touches your soul and heals your will
For your sins
No chance to be forgiven
Just hope to find a deserved peace
In an endless sleep
But the sunlight is waking you.

Take one step forward
It is heavier than before
That iced land was testing you
Keep walking hunted by your demon son.

An ambush in the night,
A brave sacrified his life.
Falling one by one for you
But you will not astray
Then history repeats itself

In your dreams
Red roses lay beneath
The shadow of the Tower
Touches your soul and heals your will
For your sins
No chance to be forgiven
Just hope to find a deserved peace
In an endless sleep
But the sunlight is wakingâ¦

In your dreams
Red roses lay beneath
The shadow of the Tower
Touches your soul and heals your will
But the sunlight is waking you
