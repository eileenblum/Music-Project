A severe test, a passing rite
That will mark my fate
I will deserve my father's guns
When the day comes
Under the gallows I have realized
What I will become
Not a horse-boy,
Not even a page,
Proud between those who have come first
The youngest gunslinger

[CHORUS]
Blind anger, savage madness
Have filled my heart
I need to escape
Before my mind is blown up
I'll begin my journey,
I won't forget my father's face

A bloody bite, a red sight drawn
On is white neck
Betrayal consumed with the master
Of the dark shadows
Unfaithful bondsman,
I'll hunt you down for my father's sake
With a hideous grin painted on my face
I will take on the final test
The youngest gunslinger

[CHORUS]
Blind anger, savage madness
Have filled my heart
I need to escape
Before my mind is blown up

Blind anger, savage madness
Have filled my heart
I swear that I will take his life

[Solo]

[CHORUS]
In the yard, the hawk at my side,
The fight has begun
A silent bullet straight to the head
Sacrifice and victory
Walking through the East gate
I'm the youngest gunslinger
The youngest gunslinger
