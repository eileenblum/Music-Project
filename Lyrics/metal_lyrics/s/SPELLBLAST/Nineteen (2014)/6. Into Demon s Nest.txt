A crossing point between two worlds
Frightening ford that leads to freedom
An exhausting trial for their will
The last chased hope to meet them up
On the Tower's path

A door is hidden in the ground
Protected by the devil-ray demon
The carved key will clear the way
While the girl's flesh traps the beast
The union is completed

[CHORUS]
The circle of destiny has been fulfilled
Finally the journey begins
To the field of the roses
For the sake of our father
Our lives we'll live as one

Now we enter into the demon's nest
A beast is waiting in the darkness
Ready to swallow its scared prey
A silver key is his only lifeline
Dragged to safety

[CHORUS]
The circle of destiny has been fulfilled
Finally the journey begins
To the field of the roses
For the sake of our father
Our lives we'll live as one

[Solo]

[CHORUS]
The circle of destiny has been fulfilled
Finally the journey begins
To the field of the roses
For the sake of our father
Our lives we'll live as one
