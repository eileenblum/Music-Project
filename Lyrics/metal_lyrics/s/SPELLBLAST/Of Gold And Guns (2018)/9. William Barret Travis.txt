A red flag waves in the wind
General Sant Anna's army is here
Their force exceeded ten times
Words have failed
We will try with cannon shots

Besieged by a rain of bombs
No one was killed, we're blessed by God
We are too few to succeed
But they'll remember the Alamo for sure

As united we soar
Our rifles will roar
The Mexican lead won't tear this wall
Side by side
With a dream in our heart
A newborn Republic will soon arise from us

Now they're trying to approach
Our requests for help were answered not
And we were left here alone
To fight a battle that we cannot tell

As united we soar

Victory or death
We know no retreat
The Texas Republic will soon be free
We've given our lives
Pierced by their swords
To remind us that blood is the price for freedom
