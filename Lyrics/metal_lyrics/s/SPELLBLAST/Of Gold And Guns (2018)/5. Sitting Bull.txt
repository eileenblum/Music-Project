We're the quiet flow of river
the deafening tumble of waterfall
the wisdom of the elder white owl
the enormous strength of the brown bear

We are the harmonious flight of the swallow
the implacable swoop of golden eagle
the crisp breeze that blows at dawn
the lashing storm that sweeps the plain

Dancing 'round the sacred tree
blood and sweat now soak the ground
We thank you for the gift of life
bless our people Thunderbird

We are the shared ceremonial stone pipe
the solemn smoke preluding war
the healing sand paintings of our tribe
the cold cutting of tomahawk

we are the nimble leap of the squirrel
the silent snake with deadly bite
the lone wolf howling at moon
the wild pack going on the prowl

Dancing 'round the sacred tree

Wearing white we please the spirits
tongues of fire bring ghosts to life
bless our people Thunderbird

Dancing 'round the sacred tree
