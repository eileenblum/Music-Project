He was born free, wild, among the trees
Washed by his father's blood
Fed with hate against the white man
Revenge at any cost

The Great Spirit has touched his fierce soul
Now he leads the clans
A scarlet shade soon will wet our lands
It's pale faces' end

Great thunder rides upon your face
From the high sky hailstone protects you

Hoka hey! The river will turn red
Fellows, today is a good day to die
Hoka hey! Let's fight without regrets,
The Great Spirit embraces us all

"My lands are where my dead lie buried"
In this you believed
Your spirit rides free like the wind
Without chains

A white owl is watching over you
Crazy horse the one who will be carved in stone

Hoka hey! The river will turn red
