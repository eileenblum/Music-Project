A stupid joke has dragged your life
Into a hunt and you were the prey
Hangin' you it was the plan
But first they had to catch you

An escape artist
Perhaps a steel cell can stop your run
Left-Handed Gun
An old picture has created a fake tale

Terror running down the streets
Of Lincoln's county
They call you Billy the Kid,
A bounty on your head
Terror running down the streets
Of Lincoln's county
They call you Billy the Kid,
A killer on the run

At that time, justice and law
Where so far to be synonymous
A bunch of cowboys grab their guns
Just a wrongdoing to face toward

A furious chase
Conducted along a paved road of hate
In vengeance's name
Righteous lives got blasted by your slugs

Terror running down the streets
Not afraid to die like a man
Fighting as I'm standing above snakes
I won't die while crying for my life
Crawling in the dust like a dog unarmed

Terror running down the streets
