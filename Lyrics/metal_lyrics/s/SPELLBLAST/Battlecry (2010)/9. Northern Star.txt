[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

This night the sea is waving my name
Time to sail towards Christians' lands
Shine, full moon lead me through black night
Soon our spears will engage the fight

Oh, Northern Star, glow with all your light
Warriors, our prayers have reached the skies
Above us, Valkyries are flying
To grab the soul of the one who's dying

The dusk now is coming, they re trying to escape
But tomorrow they'll face their fate
Burn, destroy, no one will survive
With our steel we'll end their lives

Against the wind, across mighty storms
Into the fire, over the waters, we're
Far from home, our destiny has come, it's time to kill
This epic battle will become our greatest war song

Oh please Gods, just set me free
Guide me to clear victory
Oh great Gods, please set us free
Guide us to bright victory

Now I'm here, alone in the field
Silence's around me, no more left alive
Everything's gone but a thing
The northern star's shining for me
