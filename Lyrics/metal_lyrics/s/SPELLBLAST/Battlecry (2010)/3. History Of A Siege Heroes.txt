[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

Knights of the king
Proud we stand
To defend this land of hope and dreams
Tears and pain are the price for the madness
That has fallen upon us
We ll fight against this obsessive dark

Swords and shields are been crushed for our rights
We ll lead to glory and peace
Blessed by hundred sparks of magic lights
We're riding through this endless night

Knights of the king
Proud we stand
To defend this land of hope and dreams
Tears and pain are the price for the madness
That has fallen upon us
We ll fight against this rotten world

We cut the wind and tear the seas apart
No one can outstand us
Only blood and dust
Are our reward now call us heroes
We are marching aligned, war hammers in the sky
Will lead to glory and peace
We re asking for no more, now cowards run
And call us heroes: yes we are

In the light my faithful we've found the true strength
To redeem the bastards that have raped our lands
Sweep them out, my friend
Well, it's time to act, to break the chain,
The chain of a ruined life, a rusty past, lost memories
A past made by strange thoughts
And wrong, wrong beliefs
Let the axe fall, slash grim enemies
For the sake of our families
Then wind screams a word: Victory
