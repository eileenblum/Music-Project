[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Ivan Gelpi]

Lead me to that forgotten place
Where no one dares to go, or even speak of it
My only savior, my spirit guide
You'll be my revelation to forbidden rhymes

Mysterious wine
Wisdom of ancient times

Fill my cup,
And drink with the gods!
Releasing the knowledge of all
To reveal the secrets of life
Now forget your past
A new life's begun!

Touch the sky,
And drink with the gods!
Releasing the knowledge of all
The Holy Water is flowing deep
Now forget your past
A new life's begun!

Sacred fluid, I can feel the taste
Denied to our race since the creation of the world
A sweet sense of omnipotence
Is growin' strong, soon I'll turn myself  in a mighty God

Fill the cup and drink with me
To reach the sky, a dream in the night
A spark in the dark to pierce my heart and tear it apart
Suddenly, I am falling down
Through the abyss of void, a sleep of oblivion
