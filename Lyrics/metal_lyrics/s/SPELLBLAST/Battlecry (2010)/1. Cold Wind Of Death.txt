[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

An angry laugh
Raise up from the battlefield
Where our brothers have fought
With honour glory and pride
Only crows are now praying
For their souls no endless peacefulness

Vultures fly
While the dusk is coming
No one will rest with the fallen
Darkness will embrace their flesh
There's no cross neither tombstone
Placed for the man who's dead

Only a cold wind of death
Screams where the blood
Is spreaded everywhere
Swords, spears, axes and maces lie
While the sun is escaping from this land of death

Only a cold wind of death
Screams where the blood
Is spreaded everywhere
Human race sooner or later will find the end
Due to the greed of other men

With fearless heart
We have faced our destiny
Now my life has reached the end
Forever in a legend I'll live
Now I'm gone but remember my name
Don't forget my epic tale
