[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi / Ivan Gelpi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

In the end of days
My father will die
Eaten by his wolf son Fenrir
The moon and the sun
Will disappear from the sky
Rainbow bridge will crumble away

A new world will arise
Mighty gods will rise again
Come back from the reign of death
A snake in the clouds
Has taken his flight
It will come the time
When I'll have again to fight

Earth will be shaken
Due to the cosmic tree
Loki will sail with hell's warship
While the white guardian god
Will blow in his horn
Valhalla's army will be forced to march

Battle will be so cruel
I will avenge my father's death
My great sword will pierce the wolf's heart
Then my brother will exhale his last tiring breath
While the fire is wasting the life in the world
'til the end
