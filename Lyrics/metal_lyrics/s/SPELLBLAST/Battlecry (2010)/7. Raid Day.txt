[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina / Claudio Arsuffi]

We will leave at first dawn's lights
When the sun will blind them
Dozen of ships will plough the sea
They will taste our payment
God of wind blow up our sails

Shout out! A day of glory for us,
You will run away
Now march across the enemy line,
You'll be swept away
Die! Die! your blood is on my shield,
Look into my eyes
Cry! Cry! And say your prayers,
Enjoin your end.
Fall down! Arrows are flying in the sky,
You will be pierced
Break in the hall of the throne, ravage this place
Face me! begging will not save your life,
Stand up and fight
Crawl worms! Leave your blades behind,
Escape from this hell

Now the battle is going to an end
The enemy ranks are scared to death
We ll rip your  war chest, where are your gods?
We are raising for Odin our sword

Far away is my dream of war, troops stand up! Sing out ours deeds!

We sweep across your land bringing doom
Burning all houses and spreading red scourge
Shedding Blood, where is your God?
We are here, listen, Odin is our war!
