[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

Today another battle's calling us,
Grab your spears and fight
Riding trough the plans side by side
No one will be left alive
Tomorrow will await without a sun
We're looking for some gold
Becoming a hero won't pay for sure
Slaughterers? Yes we are!

This kingdom needs a law
And my soldiers are here for that
With fire and steel our duty will be done
We're not afraid of death
Our rage will crash your soul

Coming from the wild north
A frozen land of death
Bringing the nightmare of a never ending winter
Standing out the castle
We build up our camp
Night now is coming we re ready for the siege

Heading to our death
With nothing to regret
Spitting blood over my hands

Before no one my knees I ll bend
A prayer to Odin in the end
In Valhalla we ll drink my friends

This kingdom needs a law
And my soldiers are here for that
With fire and steel our duty will be done
We're not afraid of death
Our rage is strong like our souls
