[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

On the sea, the moon is drawing
A path to guide me to
Fire is burning around me now
This will be my last travel

Oh glorious ship take me away
Over endless oceans
Take me away
Where I haven t ever wanted to be

Believe in my wise words:
"We will never return"
Bringin' our path
Far from our lands

In my sleeps
I can already see the foreign lands
In my dreams, agony
The curse of reality
The cold snow is falling now
Covering everything
On this land my name will be
Remembered throughout centuries
