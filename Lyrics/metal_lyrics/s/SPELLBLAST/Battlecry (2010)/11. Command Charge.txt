[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi / Ivan Gelpi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

Marching frozen between this mountains
We seek growlin' monsters
The cold embrace of this
Cursed island is tightening more and more

I can clearly feel the pain
Surrounded by the mist of mists
All our hopes are lost
Please Odin come to give us an hand

Thor's hammer crack the sky and shake the ground
Again, one more time we're standing by your side
We will serve the Lord who leads us to another war

And crouched in the snow we're waitin' now
Oh, my brothers hear the command: charge!

Cut their throats, while the sunset
Is coming on this bloody landscape and rape their women so our sons will become
The progeny of doom

Thor's hammer crack the sky and shake the ground
Again, one more time we're standing by your side
Another chance we had, we will fight
We will serve the Lord who leads us to another war

Thor's hammer crack the sky and shake the ground
Again, one more time we're standing by your side
Another chance we had, we will fight
We will serve the Lord who leads us to another war
Leads us to another war
Bring us to war
