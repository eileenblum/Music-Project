[Music: Luca Arzuffi / Claudio Arsuffi, Lyric: Daniele  Geno  Caravina]

Forged in a night without light
Pounded by a great iron hammer
Strong it was the blacksmith hand
The flames in the cave were burning high
Over than fifty thousand strikes
Were born to serve the proudest swordsman
His silent friend the only hope to survive
A shining cold steel harder than nothing before

Many warriors have beared me in battle
In the blood their destiny I've settled
Dark red skin cover my deadly sharpen blade
With their life the price has been paid

Blessed by gods destroyer of unfaithfuls
Held out in hand my life's now meaningful
Precious gift starved flash eater this is your fame
Now I call you Ulfberth, a mighty name

From the father to his beloved son
Binded by a seal made with blood
Tied up at belt scary symbol of pain
Judge and jury for the lawless foes
Thunder god, my declaration of faith
Take my soul, grant me an immortal life
In the pouring rain, hear my battle cry
While the lightning is tearing the skies apart
