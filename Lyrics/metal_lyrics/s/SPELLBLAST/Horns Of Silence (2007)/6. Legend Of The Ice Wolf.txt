A land of paradise, covered by snow
I'm still waiting for silence
To break, the sun will fall down
Just remember the Holy Scriptures

The Ice Wolf is coming
Hungry and mighty beast
Unleashing the power
Of this untamed wilds
Noble and fierce
It will bring an end
To this world
Of endless sufferance

By weeks under siege,
The enemy is fighting with magic
They'll choose the time
In which we'll be blind
Surrounded by cannons

And siege machines
Our garrison is prepared
For the final fight
Awaiting a sign...
Praying for him...

The Ice Wolf is coming
(Our souls' freedom has come)
Last moments of your life
The ice wolf is coming
(Our souls' freedom has come)
All was said and done

Fired out by the woods,
A lightning through plains
A white wolf is running
Possessed by the devil
The skyline turns to black,
Bringing the death
As it flies towards the moon...

The Ice Wolf is coming...
