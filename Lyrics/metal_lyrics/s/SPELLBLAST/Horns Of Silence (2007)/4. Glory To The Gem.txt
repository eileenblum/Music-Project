I was walking alone, deep in the forest
looking the only thing, that showed me, the way.
I was tired, and while I was falling,
an enchanted voice, called me from the sky.

Carry on this rock and take it to a cave, of your land
take care of it, the power inside
is boundless like your will,
on it the salvation of your Kingdom,
depends... depends...

[Solo: Luke]

The Skyland's lord felt that they were near
in the valley was growing the fear,
the Gem hidden the day before
people were waiting to adore.

Mystery in her light so shining
that gave us force to fight,
but the army of death, was going to break
the rite of mystical Queen of the night

We don't really want to lose our freedom denied
Oh, people we want to follow the breeze of the night

[CHORUS:]
Dragons fly, it's time to fight,
there's an order in our bridle mind,
in a cold higher flight glory's rocking our courage to ride
Dragons fly, it's time to fight,
there's a Gem that it's beating in our hearts,
the great land's waiting for an amazing dream,
swords are burning... at the battlefield

They were days of great tears of blood,
burned on this great Holy Land
army almost arrived, to conquer our soul
not our might

We don't really want to lose our freedom denied
Oh, people we want to follow the breeze of the night

[CHORUS]

[Solo: Luke]

We don't really want to lose our freedom denied
Oh, people we want to follow the breeze of the night

[CHORUS]

The last sword, into our last hope
Our destiny is in a word: "victory"
We'll call it, when a black cloud will
Take away these hangmen of nullity...
