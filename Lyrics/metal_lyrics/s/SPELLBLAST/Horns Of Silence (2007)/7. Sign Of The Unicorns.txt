I'll tell about my tale
And after I'll fade away
Wherever I'll stay
For the journey of light I'll pray
A long time ago there's
An unicorn, oh, so wild
With the spirit so blinded
Ready to let the Sign
From the twilight another arrived
Breathin' glory and hope
The third was a lightning
With venom in his mouth

We felt the spell it wasn't full
We needed to load
These minds fateful
The wrath was becoming
Reality for us
Now time's getting short
We'll eat the mass

The fourth spread his wings
When the magical wake reached him
The whirlwind of destruction
Was followed by the fifth
After a long ride
In the skies of no return
An ideal: the seal
Of the union in that time born

Pucks of (the) darkness,
Open the great doors!
We're coming to break
The ice of hate
In the bell of the temple
You can hear our force
We've got the golden key of fate

Temple Sky
Be our path
These whispers are really false
A rainbow rises
Hear its sons
Look at the Sign of the Unicorns

Another fight another scream
Another dream is in the air
And other warriors rise
And trample upon hills
The land of spirits' bare
Let the fear away
Follow the Sign into the marshes
Deep in you!
Silence, until you'll see
Hope, that it will be real

Temple Sky...
