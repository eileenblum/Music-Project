Back in a past time
Of heroes and brave dwells
Giants and evil ones
Were ruling the land

A dwarf grabs his great war hammer
With fearless heart is standing
He's fighting in the name of Odin
An archer follows him from distance
He's watching the proud soldier
They believe to break
The awful law

I hope that anyway...
Could happen
When spells and weapons
Will crush

Hear the sound of the war
Smash and fill the air... Hail!
When they'll be called to the fight
Only the strong will survive

We're ready to the battle
We've got the same dream
When we're under a mighty flag
Believe in the dream of your life

After the sunset
Completely defeated
To death condemned
By the grey iron sword
It sharpens evil bodies
The cold bloods quench my thirst
It's finally ended
Our land is now free!

Hear the sound of the war...
