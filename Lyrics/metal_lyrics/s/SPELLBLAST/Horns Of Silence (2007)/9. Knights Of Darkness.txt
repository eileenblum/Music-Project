Visions of doom
Are pervading in my eyes
A sense of danger,
An obsession in my mind
No, I'm not dreaming,
It's so close and real
This sensation of evil
So deepest and near

Wait! Now I feel them,
But there's something wrong
Oh there's still something
I cannot comprehend
I'm a powerful wizard
And you know it well
But against this evilness
I cannot do much

They're searching for me
They're hunting for thee
They're here Ooh - so near

Look behind...

It seems we're followed
By some Black Knights
The smell of death
Is approaching fatefully
There's no chance to escape
'Cause the black riders
Are on the way
This is the end of our lives

High in the sky
Winged horses they ride
To bring the destruction
On our beloved lands
In the fire we stand
With swords in our hands
Forget all your fears:
Righteousness is on our side!

It seems we're followed...

Lord of the Nine
In the darkness I saw your face
Icon of terror and blood
Your deadly knife waits in silence
Silence was broken by fear
But fear is a feeling of the weak
A hissin' came from the beyond
You were staring at me...
And then... you'd screamed!

Shining crown,
Unbearable light within the dark
Incredible source
Of spectral madness
The starlight's obscured
By eternal blindness
A terrible shadow's
Crossing my heart

Unbearable light within the dark
Incredible source
Of spectral madness
The starlight's obscured
By eternal blindness
A horrible vision inside my heart
Inside my heart
