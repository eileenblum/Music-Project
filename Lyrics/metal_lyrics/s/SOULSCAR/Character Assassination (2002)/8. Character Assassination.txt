These broken rhymes, these trying times
No common destiny? 'til death do us part
I detect a change of heart - a growing seed

Please, you're alone this time, my love
Bleeding, bleeding all alone, my love

Sacrificing everything to see it to an end
The character assassins cannot bury me
They can't kill me again

Many times I've wondered how they fucked my life
I'll never bow down to the bastards
Never again, never again
Plagued by the past - a resurrected shame
Questions returned - was it worth the pain?

Been crushed, trampled by the velvet lies
Truth set me free to be buried alive, buried alive
Delayed salvation on the screen - my fate
I have to wonder did redemption come too late?

Sacrificing everything to see it to an end
The character assassins cannot bury me
They can't kill me again
