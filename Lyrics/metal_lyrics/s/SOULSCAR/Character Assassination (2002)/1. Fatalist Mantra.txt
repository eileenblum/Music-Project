Light of faith lit every new dawn for him
Claws of the dark consumed his past
A crucible full of blood of angels
Drained down to hell, drained down to hell
A phantom summoned with each drop
Breathing oaths of deliverance
His will is waning into nothing
No hope for the hopeful, no more hope

There is no salvation for the wicked
The kingdom of heaven, it was a lie
Each tangent spilling the innocent blood
Forgive and forget ain't how he plays

"He had it coming" (had it coming)
"We all got it coming" (got it coming)
"He had it coming" (had it coming)
"We all got it coming" (got it coming)

Now resigned to evil out of necessity
Choked back his faith and accepted fate
Brutally metamorphosing into malevolence
No more hope

"He had it coming" (had it coming)
"We all got it coming" (got it coming)
"He had it coming" (had it coming)
"We all got it coming" (got it coming)
