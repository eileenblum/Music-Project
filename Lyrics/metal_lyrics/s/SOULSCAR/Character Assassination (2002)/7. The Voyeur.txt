He sits inside his castle
Watching through transparent walls
It keeps him safe, locked away
They can't get in but he can't escape
The growing glass becomes a crutch
Can't touch the ones who mean so much
Reflections of his panicked soul
He throws himself into the wall

Folly... falling, the images he's drinking in like wine
Affections so misguided, failure so sublime
If they only knew how hard it is to say
The walls are growing higher, he's slipping far away

He sat inside his castle
Watching through transparent walls
Kept alone, locked away
Safe inside but he couldn't escape
The growing glass became a crutch
Couldn't tough the one who meant so much
Reflections of his panicked soul
He threw himself into the wall

Folly...falling, desertion leads to jealousy, alone
He builds a newer castle, new castle out of stone
If they only knew how hard it is to say
The walls are growing higher, he's slipping far away
If they only knew how hard it is to say
The walls are growing higher, he's slipping far away
