My former life thrown away
Spent ages wandering, wandering to my fate
You say the bastard shadow, shadow's come to stay
You'll let me live if I can help you all to see another day

I know I've made my mistakes
Forced me into this role, anger I will slake
You say the bastard shadow, shadow's come to stay
You don't trust me, but you need me
This scorned messiah, fake

Locked up in the rain
I'll do this once for you, but when I'm on my way
It's not for resurrection, it's not for your affliction
To redemption will the interceptor ride

The demon rose, the demon came
He said there's "too much violence"
He said there's "too much pain"
"Just walk away..." there'll be an end to it
"Just walk away... there will be an end to the horror"

Locked up in the rain
I'll do this once for you, but then I'm on my way
It's not for resurrection; it's not for your affliction
To redemption will the interceptor ride
