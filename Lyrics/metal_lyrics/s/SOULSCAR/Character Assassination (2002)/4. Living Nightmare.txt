Demon seed - when I went to hell I laughed
Psycho need - so the devil sent me back for you

[Chorus:]
No? No? No? No?
Think twice before you answer
No! No! No! No fucking way I'll be denied this time

This is the living nightmare - it never stops
I am the living nightmare - ready to rock

Question me - I'm fine, you're the problem
Wrath to feel
Keep looking at me and I'll put you in the ground

[Chorus]

Can't duck, can't run, can't hide - no sanctuary
You lived by the sword, but now the sword is me

[Chorus]

This is the living nightmare - it just never stops
I am the living nightmare - ready to rock
