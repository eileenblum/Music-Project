Primed - murderous intentions veiled by lies
Crime - devil's dead ringer, he's corrupt to the bone

Shell - a tainted emblem above his heart
Hell - looking into a world of kaleidoscopic sin

On his lips his finger as he pulls the trigger
Sleep with one eye open
No sirens tonight
Does it make it right to take a wolf to catch a wolf?

Underhanded with the upper hand
'It takes a wolf to catch a wolf'

Blind - seduced into a villain's arms
Bind - sentenced by visions, virtue, disarray

Plight - he's written decrees on deviance
Fight - ideal synthesis for this thick sadistic mind

On his lips his finger as he pulls the trigger
Sleep with one eye open
No sirens tonight
Does it make it right to take a wolf to catch a wolf?
