A memory of you, frozen in time
Like cement in the hourglass
Can't leave you behind

Stumbling down this path, trying to find my way
Back to you - to your heart
I must lift myself, from these iron feet
As long as you're here, I'll never fall again

[Chorus:]
The tears will flow within, though this armor is this
I'm here for you (sacrifices)
Dying here for you (sacrifices)

Tap the roots of... of this vessel
Try to bleed what's since turned to lead
Words you spared echo and
Lull through my head
I've nothing to hide - my heart deep in you

[Chorus]

Promises plated silver
I won't let them rust
Your apparition
The only one I trust
