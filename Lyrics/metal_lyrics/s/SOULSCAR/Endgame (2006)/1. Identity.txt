Severance of life and the living
A notch in the blade
Headstone epitaph
All I know is what I'm after

No purpose or reason
Just instinct and fear

Severance of all that I've needed
Quickening life
I awake, I awaken
All I am is what I'm after

No purpose or reason
Just instinct and fear
Vision denied, running on sound
I breathe my own air

Carry on and don't say a word
Requiem for those who must follow
My burning trail
Flames shall light the way

Carry on and don't say a word
Requiem for those who must follow
My burning trail
Flames shall light the way
