The truths an injury, never healed
Every time you walked away the scab was torn
Leaving an open wound that I couldn't fend to
Despite my most desperate efforts

If there were something that I could've
Done to fix myself and regulate...regulate
To stabilize and smile, to shrug it off
And rid myself of this tightness In my chest
I would have done!

This vessel -- this soul
Appeared from a distance as strong
But there was little
Next to nothing
Holding it up

I dread to dream what without these words id be
Feel of the sun upon your wings

I dread to dream what without these words id be
Feel of the sun upon your wings
