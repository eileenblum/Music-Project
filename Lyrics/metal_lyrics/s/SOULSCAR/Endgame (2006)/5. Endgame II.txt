Heart of cold -- I can't just melt away
Locked in my heart you will forever stay until the end
Tears of gold -- they can't lead us away
Locked in my heart you will forever stay until the end

Feeling emptiness already fading -- finding reclamation in the eyes of a child
Feeling emptiness already fading -- finding reclamation in the eyes of a child
