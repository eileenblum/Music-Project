Savage wastelands lay before me
Shrouded in ashes -- I cross horizons

Every step burns with memories
Neglected earth cracked and decaying
Feeds on misery

[Chorus:]
Deliver me unto hell
My grave lies in the hurt plains
Deliver me from this hell
My grave lies in the hurt plains

Charred remains fall behind me
Shrouded in ashes -- I cross horizons

Every step burns with memories
Neglected earth cracked and decaying
Feeds on misery

[Chorus]
