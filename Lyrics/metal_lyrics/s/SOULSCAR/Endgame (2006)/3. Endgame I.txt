Will you stay locked in my heart until the end?

Cold heart, dying to melt away -- were wailing these dirges dust to day
Will you stay here locked in my empty heart until the end

Gold tears, leading us far away -- were crying these shadows dusk to day
Will you stay here locked in my empty heart until the end

My friend, oh my lover
Will you stay in my heart until the end?
My friend, oh my lover
Will you stay in my heart until the end?

We are father, we are mother we are blood
My friend, oh my lover -- we are one
