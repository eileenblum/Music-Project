The time has come to let these half-truths lie
Been sleeping with the enemy for too long
Be brave, don't be afraid of this grave you've made
Kiss the sky goodbye

Ill rest in peace when you are tucked in the deep
The light of day will dim. Cold pulls at your feet
Your god will forget you before you've gone to sleep
The water holds you now

Ghost winds won't whisper
Where you'll rest forever
Deep six six sixed into oblivion

drowned men tell no lies

Ghost winds won't whisper
Where you'll rest forever
Deep six six sixed into oblivion
