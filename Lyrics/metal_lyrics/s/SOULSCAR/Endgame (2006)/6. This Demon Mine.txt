Crawling on a midnight mission
This crutch of mine is such a vision
Crushing any former sense of pride
Enduring repetitions -- body guilt of sedition
Leaving all reality behind

Failure to delay immediate gratification
Wish I could believe it wasn't my decision

So tightly tied to a bleeding soulless bride
But I still can't bear to turn her away
The needles daring my soul to start preparing
The broken glass -- my pillow for tonight

Failure to delay immediate gratification
Wish I could believe it wasn't my decision -- my decision to make

Let it in and race to judgment
Drowning in it -- never satisfied
A sin to touch it yet you seem to love it
Marvel at this contradiction in my hand

Let it in and race to judgment
Drowning in it -- never satisfied
A sin to touch it yet you seem to love it
Marvel at this contradiction in my hand

Unwanted, unneeded? Yet it desecrates your soul
Descending, unending... give yourself to this demon mine
