I lived in a bad day when I was alone,
I can remember! I hear my name,
But Iâm alone and Iâm wondering now,
Never forget that voice in my mind.
Every day I pray that you open the door
So that you see a wonderful world,
But you donât understand what Iâm telling you,
Listen to me: a fantastic world.

Breathe tomorrow, I can breathe in my life
Live tomorrow in a dream of life.

When I stay about to fall, when I wake up, I still believe!
And when I stay about to fall I open my wings and fly.

Iâm not afraid and I want to go on,
He âs my salvation, I need to go,
Look with your eyes where is the truth
until the end I âll scream for you.

Breathe tomorrow, I can breathe in my life
Live tomorrow in a dream of life.

You are my life, I believe in your might,
Iâm reading on my heart the real dreams of my mind.
