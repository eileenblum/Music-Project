Once again a lie, can you see in the mirror?
If you know my mind, seems like a child in Time,
but you say goodbye start with your selection
And my evil side cuts you like a knife.
Every day I cry, you are my obsession
in the middle of the night and in my confessions.
In my memories only fantasy
With my dark wings I fly again

Sometimes I see you in the morning light
everything can change my life, everything is burnt inside.
Sometimes I see you across my eyes,
let me die tomorrow, but you leave me screaming here tonight.

Once again a lie, look into the mirror
look into the sky, the vanity of your eyes.
How can you see in all my directions?
every morning and every time waiting for salvation.
God save my love, God save my passion
keep me still my hands and I wonât be afraid.

Sometimes I see you in the morning light
everything can change my life, everything is burnt inside
Sometimes I see you across my eyes
Let me die tomorrow, but you leave me screaming here tonight.

Can you feel me cry or die? I Never sleep into my life!
Can you hear my screams?

Sometimes I see you in the morning light
Everything can change my life, everything is burnt inside
Sometimes I see you across my eyes
Let me die tomorrow, but you leave me screaming here tonight.

Sometimes I see you in the morning light
Everything can change my life, everything is burnt inside
Sometimes I see you across my eyes
Let me die tomorrow, but you leave me screaming here tonight.

Sometimes I see you in the morning light (See you in the morning light)
Sometimes I see you across my eyes (See you in the morning light)
