Looking good, something like spick-and-span
Well prepared to throw dust in our eyes
Sweet little dream of all mothers in law
Hiding well your real face behind a mask
Isn't it exhausting playing this part?
The every day try to impress
You're of no importance, you're nothing
Living in dependence on strange goodwill

You are one of this kind driving spikes in my mind
Staying with you for a while causes perpetual pain
You're unable to hear what I'm telling you
Only interested in what you want to say
Try so hard reaching an aim you will never reach
Will not be my mission to fill your head with brain
Having to be on visiting terms with you
Seems to be the reason that I am getting mad
