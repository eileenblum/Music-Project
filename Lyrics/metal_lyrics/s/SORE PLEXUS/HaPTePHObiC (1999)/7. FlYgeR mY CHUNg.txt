Primetime
come see us crying, in ecstasy crying
Sleep tight
You keep on dreaming, a world full of joy
Blindside
Words of redemption so sweet in your ear
Limelight
Melting like ice cream if you don't succeed

Tie yourself down to this dotted line
Appropriation of your innerself
Anticipation of heaven on earth
If you're pretty enough to endure yourself

"Yes I will do anything - my face on the screen
And when they pull my strings
entertainment defeats!"

Blindside
Words of redemption so sweet in my ear
Limelight
Melting like ice cream if I don't succeed

Crawled not so long ago when I was a pawn
Never thought I ever would be king
Now that I got all will you see me fall?
Built me up to see me fall again

From a corner of my mind
There's a tiny voice defiant
And the echo of decry makes my tragedy defile
And the pattern of decay is the guidance on "my way"
Will someone remember me
Or will I die on jealousy?
