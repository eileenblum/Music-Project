We call it "Kaizen" - it makes me laugh

You open your eyes it's another day
Exploiting yourself with a happy face

Oh, isn't it cute how you scratch and crawl
Do you really think you're indispensable?

Yes, we control your life with government flu
Don't feel so good today? Here's TV for you!

You will bleed right in our pocket
And you call it civic pride
Oh, this little flu we gave you
Gave us our power overnight

You feel so tired, can't concentrate
Better stay home, have a drink while you fade

Yaaaaaaaa!

Ich fÃ¼hle mich nur ein biÃchen mÃ¼de...

Are you still in the bed?
Wake up son, or you will be late!
Some coffee?

Sometimes it gets worse but don't be terrified
We will add some fun to your water supply
