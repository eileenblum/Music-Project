Name two persons you think you know so well
that you'll give a leg for their loyalty
if this lesson causes you some doubts my friend
welcome to the loss of all innocence

If it's not about money you can bet it's about sex
wherefore your best buddies soon forget...

...all these words of honour that echo in your head
flaming kiss of Judas touched again and again
while they rape for pleasure
and blame their broken homes
better leave their realm and come into your own

All the kings and queens of Alzheimers disease
are sucking the trust from your heart
leaving scars for life they relish little white lies
beware of the snake in the grass
All the kings and queens of Alzheimers disease
are fickle and mean in the...blood

Idle talk on you...the blood
prolix subterfuge...the blood

Name one person you think you know so well
that he'll give a damn for your loyalty
If this lesson causes you some stomach-ache
better stop your life for a coffee break

Idle talk on you...the blood
prolix subterfuge...the blood
