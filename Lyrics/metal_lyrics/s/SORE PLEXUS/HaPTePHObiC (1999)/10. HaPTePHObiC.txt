Have you ever felt like you
Were unable to cross a room
When words and faces made you suffocate

Conformity and ignorance
The chorus of your decadence
Sending shivers up and down my spine

Leave me alone you never felt
The pain of drills inside your head
I hate your bloody lemming attitude

Avoiding handshakes with the foe
Embarrassment from head to toe
Yours will never ever be my world
