And so you decided to be recognized
No time to play dead
No time for whipping flies
And soon in your world
The sun will ever shine
A past so pretend, a future so divine

The mask of a man worth of integrity
Just use to abuse is your philosophy
Trim your sails to the wind
And reach for plenitude
The king of intrigues will veil a trace of blood

Take a seat and all you can get
Derive profit from pain
Fake your moral neglect
And as your life is sweet as an ocean of wine
Be the shark in the pool
Swallow life and let die

An army of you defends your apathy
As long as you hide the inconsistency
And well, in your world
The sun pretends to shine
An image of man - the nature of a swine

"Isn't it a life fantastic up above all praise?"
"Hope it's not contagious to the dregs of Human race!"
