Nothing really nothing at all
Changed in all these years
Just a big traditional, bogus machinery

And this most intolerant,
All inhuman club
Still rules with blindfolded eyes
It's dumb flock of sheep

Talking so deceitful and smile
Threaten to control
Every well-known order of life
gently overthrown

"Thou shall not kill"
But the 'soldiers of faith'
Don't want abortions so they
Bomb and they maim
For a Pro Life campaign
Methods of madness appear

A - M -E - N
In the name of
Endless opulence - we'll feed them
Opium for the masses
Every tragedy on earth will
Stipulate our power
