Out on the beaches that hem them seven seas
There comes old Lady Luck wisping by the trees
Tells me a story that is heavy to my ears
Said wasted time is up boy, time to face them fears 

Looking back on this life it didn't mean a thing
Cos all I ever had were the wages of my sins
Never thought I'd see the day that it all went up
Good God in heaven am I really out of luck 

NO NO NO, WHERE THERE IS SMOKE
THERE'S A FIRE
YEAH YEAH YEAH, AND THOSE FLAMES
ARE RISING HIGHER 

Won't get no second chance, can't ride for free
And once you're done you know you're history
Down on the other side what will you say 

When thoughts of heaven go up burning in that flame
Thoughts of heaven go burning up in your flame
And thoughts of heaven are driving you insane 

NO NO NO, WHERE THERE IS SMOKE
THERE'S A FIRE
YEAH YEAH YEAH, AND THOSE FLAMES
ARE RISING HIGHER 

In the blinking of an eye
Crawling up to kiss the sky 

NO NO NO, WHERE THERE IS SMOKE
THERE'S A FIRE
YEAH YEAH YEAH, AND THOSE FLAMES
ARE RISING HIGHER
