Between the ebb and the flow
My mind gets twisted
With the touch and the go
My world gets wasted away

Between the rain and the snow
It's a blind illusion
At the end of the road
I'm hoping to find me again 

CRAWLING OUT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
WANTING TO MEET YOU 

ALL THE VOICES IN MY HEAD
WANTING TO BEAT YOU DOWN 

With the turn of the world
Tides are rising
With all that I know 

I'm crying for yesterday
With the ebb and the flow
Life is fading
And sooner than you would know
It's time to burn you away 

CRAWLING OUT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
WANTING TO MEET YOU 

ALL THE VOICES IN MY HEAD
WANTING TO BEAT YOU DOWN 

All life is destined to corode
The price we pay for sins our own
The blind don't wanna find their way
The world don't wanna be saved 

CRAWLING OUT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
THEY'RE COMING 

ALL THE VOICES IN MY HEAD
THEY'RE COMING 

TO BEAT YOU DOWN
TO BREAK YOU DOWN
