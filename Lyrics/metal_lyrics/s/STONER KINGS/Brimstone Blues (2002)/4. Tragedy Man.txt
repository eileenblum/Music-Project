The look on your face is giving you away
And any pretense you might have
Can't lie behind complacent eyes
Cus I can see what it meant 

Lost your life, lost your soul
Lost everything that you ever had owned
Down the hole with nothing close to anything
That'd put meat on the bone 

YOU WON'T LIVE TO TELL THE TALE
ABOUT A MAN WHO DIED 

SO SAD AND TRAGIC MAN
SO DAMN BEFORE YOUR TIME 

YOU'RE A TRAGEDY MAN

Now the feelings growing like an embryo
Heavy labour with fear
Feels like heaven has shut the door on everyone

And damnation is here
Man you'd live again if it would help you
And live your life like a saint
But damn, it's over and no one's gonna help you
In that firey lake 

YOU WON'T LIVE TO TELL THE TALE
ABOUT A MAN WHO DIED 

SO SAD AND TRAGIC MAN
SO DAMN BEFORE YOUR TIME 

YOU'RE A TRAGEDY MAN
