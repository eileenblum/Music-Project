It's a bad situation
That you just can't seem to lose
Damn the anticipation
The kind that feeds the blues 

I'VE COME AROUND THE SUN
I'VE BEEN AROUND THE MOON

AND I STILL CAN'T SHAKE
THOSE POSTMORTEM BLUES 

It's a crazy situation
My sky is falling down
Here's my resignation
Last train is leaving town 

I'VE COME AROUND THE SUN
I'VE BEEN AROUND THE MOON 

AND I STILL CAN'T SHAKE
THOSE POSTMORTEM BLUES 

Don't ever say I didn't warn you
Of the day you'd lose it all
There's millions of out there baby
Freezing in the cold 

I told you once, I told you twice
A thousand times and you still don't know
So now's the time to pay the price
You're dying twice and it cost your soul 

Postmortem comes for you
Postmortem Blues
You're not alone now baby
You're not alone
