Blind man can't see the sign of the cross
Just down the road
Poor man don't understand
That the cost is gonna be his soul
All his life he questions why
And takes the name of the Lord in vain 

You think by now he'd have realized
Why he's losing at the game
(Why he's losing at the game
And it's driving him insane) 

Rich man don't give a damn
About the beggars he turns away
All he owns is a sleight if hand
Saving up for his judgement day 

He'd be wise to realize
that his soul can still be saved
So thank God that you're still alive
And you've still got time today
(Yeah you still got time today
So don't throw it all away) 

IT'S ONE STOP DOWN THAT ROAD
JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW 

ONE STOP DOWN THAT ROAD
DOWN THAT COBBLESTONE ROAD 

Some dead men go to heaven
Most dead men go to hell
All dead men live forever
And this dead man never tells 

IT'S ONE STOP DOWN THAT ROAD
JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW 

ONE STOP DOWN THAT ROAD
DOWN THAT COBBLESTONE ROAD
