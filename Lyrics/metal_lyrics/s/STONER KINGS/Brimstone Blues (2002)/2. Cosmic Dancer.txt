She's calling back her summer
By the voice on the breeze
She told me summer's searching for her groom
Where all the rivers flow
Drowning her in the colors of her bloom 

You know that she really should have
Come around a little sooner
Cos the echos on the wind they tell
That you should know just as well
The chill that's in the air it knows
That my baby's kept the fires warm 

DON'T YOU KNOW
SHE'S MY COSMIC DANCER 

The short little ladies are telling me
The old man is coming
With a sickle in his hand
To take up all that grows 

Drowning her in the colors of her bloom
You know that she really should have
Come around a little sooner
Cos the echos on the wind they tell
That you should know just as well
The chill that's in the air it knows
That my baby's kept the fires warm 

DON'T YOU KNOW
SHE'S MY COSMIC DANCER 

The echos on the wind they tell
That all is really not that well
And you should know just as well
My baby don't kiss and tell 

DON'T YOU KNOW
SHE'S MY COSMIC DANCER
