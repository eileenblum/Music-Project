Out in the twilight hall
Where the wind begins to shine
Calling out the maiden voyage
Out on the brink of space and time
A solitary beacon stands 

For the ships a guiding light
All of those who strayed from home
Now await to get it right 

IF LIMBO DOES EXIST
WELL THEN I WANNA KNOW
WILL I BE HERE FOREVER

WON'T I PAY THE TOLL
IN MY LIMBONIC VOID
CALLING LIMBO 

Drifting to where no one knows
I just hope we'll make it fine
Asteriods and laser beams
Spread the view before our eyes 

If this here is all there is
Then I hope I'll lose my mind
Always chose the shades of grey
Now I'd die for black or white 

IF LIMBO DOES EXIST
WELL THEN I WANNA KNOW
WILL I BE HERE FOREVER 

WON'T I PAY THE TOLL
IN MY LIMBONIC VOID
CALLING LIMBO
