Damn, damn you Delilah
Little liar
I gave you my world and you left me 

You left me out in the cold
So don't come running to me
When the story's over
Cos you know that I'll be 

A little wiser and older
Hey, hey you Delilah
Devil's lyre
What will you say 

When you have got to pay the piper
He won't believe your lies
So leave them all behind
Cos you know I tried
I tried and now I'm telling you 

I DON'T WANNA SEE DELILAH IN MY DREAMS
I DON'T WANNA SEE DELILAH
I DON'T WANNA SEE THE LIAR IN MY DREAMS
BABY DON'T WANNA SEE YOU 

PROMISED ME YOUR ROSES
GAVE ME ONLY THORNS
WELL DAMN YOU DELILAH 

I DON'T WANNA SEE DELILAH IN MY DREAMS
COS BABY YOU'RE A LIAR
