Astral beings fly on telepathic highways
Am I blind?
Cos I can't see what you see
Your demons must've took you for a ride 

And all the times
That you've come and gone
You still don't seem to know
What's going on 

I'VE GOT THIS PREMONITION
AND IT JUST WON'T GO AWAY
I'VE BEEN CONFUSED FOR ALL MY LIFE
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH STONEHENGE ANYWAY? 

Your UFO just arrived with armies of small green men
Out of sight
Spirit travel's left you high and dry
With questions out of mind

And all the times
That you've come and gone
You still don't seem to know
What's going on 

I'VE GOT THIS PREMONITION
AND IT JUST WON'T GO AWAY
I'VE BEEN CONFUSED FOR ALL MY LIFE
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH STONEHENGE ANYWAY? 

You say you know Jesus Christ
Well I say you nothing about God
Your truth is out there
Somewhere between the heavens and the stars 

And all the times
That you've come and gone
You still don't seem to know
What's right and wrong 

I'VE GOT THIS PREMONITION
AND IT JUST WON'T GO AWAY
I'VE BEEN CONFUSED FOR ALL MY LIFE
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH STONEHENGE ANYWAY?
