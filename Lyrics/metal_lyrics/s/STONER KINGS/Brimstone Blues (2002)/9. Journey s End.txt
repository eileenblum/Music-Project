There came a misty morning
Out on the shores of time
And I heard the sirens calling 

There was nowhere left to hide
I never should've gone out this far
I never should have gone out at all 

OH YEAH, SO GLAD TO SEE HOW
YOU'VE COME AROUND THE BEND 

I TOLD YOU WE'D MEET NOW
AT THE JOURNEY'S END 

(How we'd meet in the end...)

Now treading the silent oceans
And the tides that seem to glow
With deadly premonition 

Telling us it's time to go
Never should've trusted the reaper
When he told me I could keep you 

OH YEAH, SO GLAD TO SEE HOW
YOU'VE COME AROUND THE BEND 

I TOLD YOU WE'D MEET NOW
AT THE JOURNEY'S END 

And if that you could leave 

I think you surely would
And if that you could see
I think you'd understood 

A face of silver lining
The season no one knows
The day we are approaching 

Will reckon to our souls
How many will lose in the end
How many will die in their sins 

OH YEAH, SO GLAD TO SEE HOW
YOU'VE COME AROUND THE BEND 

I TOLD YOU WE'D MEET NOW
AT THE JOURNEY'S END
