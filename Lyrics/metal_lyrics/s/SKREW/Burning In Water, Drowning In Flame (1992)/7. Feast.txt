Rise
Drowning in an
Ocean of black
Pulled by your powder
Over me
Suffocated, smothered
Martyred like the jesus son
Loved and despised
Put into the ground
Fuck you rise

I lay victim to the crimes of your desire

Your kisses are spears
That pierce my side
Your love is the thorns
That crown my head
Your lies are the lies
That poison my mind
In a whirlwind colorstorm
That drives me blind

I lay victim to the crimes of your desire

I look into
I see my god
Eating filth
I see my fear
I see my heart
Burning up
I see my soul
Sick and grey

I lay victim to the crimes of your desire

Broken and splintered
Like wood from the cross
My spirit lies broken
Covered in frost
Crucified by the love i most fear lost
I lay victim to the crimes of your desire
Martyred like the jesus son
Loved and despised

Put into the ground
Fuck you rise
Your lies are the lies
That poison my mind
In a whirlwind colorstorm
That drives me blind
