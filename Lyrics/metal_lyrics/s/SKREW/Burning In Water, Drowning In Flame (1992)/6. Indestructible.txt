Hate and ware and blind despair - tell me you love me
Tears and screams and unholy fears - tell me you love me
I want you to look at me - tell me you love me
Tell me you love me

We're not indestructible
We're not indestructible

Pride and lust and selfish greed
Bow your head and pray raw meat
Grind my soul on your city street
Black spine snake crack
Fetal facial moral plaque
Scientific mutilation diplomatic
Falsehood nation
Movie world horror king
Star of saviour play on pain
Instrumental souls insane, i want you to look at me
Tell me you love me

We're not indestructible
We're not indestructible

Hollow eyes with death mask grins
Twisted limbs and genital sins
Malevolent malformed procreates
I want you to look at me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me

We're not indestructible
We're not indestructible
