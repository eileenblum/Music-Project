Open throated shrieking nature
Living inside alone alive
Gold dusted broken beggar
Walking deserts of disgust

Praying through broken lips
Searching through blinded eyes
Gold dusted broken beggar
Living inside alone alive

Burning
In water
Drowning
In flame

Inside my house my home
Living on spiders time
Knowing life drive me blind
Ghost of solutions evade my mind

Angel dusted infected leper
Wandering streets of gold and lust
Making love to every healer
Every healer to destroy my trust

Burning
In water
Drowning
In flame

One silver bullet from god's own gun
Chemical equation for flying to the sun

Burning
In water
Drowning
In flame

Angel dusted infected leper
Wandering streets of gold and lust
Making love to every healer
Every healer to destroy my trust

Open throated shrieking nature
Living inside alone alive
Gold dusted broken beggar
Walking deserts of disgust

Burning
In water
Drowning
In flame
