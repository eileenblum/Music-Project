Big black dog bark
Swollen inside my head
Ears bleed cries of
A thousand years
Broken machine
Limp on and on and on
Infinite words choked
On subjugated flesh

You've sucked the life
From my raw red lung
Lost in a hole
Of useless lies
Seen through the eyes of
Eyes once alive
But all for breath now dead

Silver picture of sanity
Scratched on the side of my head
Forbidden truths now relative
To the tongues that speak them
And i cry out
While moonlight
Cuts my mouth

My bowels ache with the heat of your crime
Pound the pound of 2000 years time
Prayer wheel grindstone
Break my back
