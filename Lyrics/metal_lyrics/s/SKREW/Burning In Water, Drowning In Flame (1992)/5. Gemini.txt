I can see
Through my dandelion eye
Broken skin
Poison vein
Dandelion
I can see inside
Through my dandelion eye

No longer blind
Taste of life on top of my tongue
My cold grey brain
Burning like a gun
I can see ubsude through mt dandelion eye

Christian does
Just what he please
Disease has made him blind
Dandelion
I can see inside
Through my dandelion eye

Am i am i gemini

No longer blind
Taste of life on top of my tongue
My cold grey brain
Burning like a gun
I can see inside
Through my dandelion eye

Am i am i gemini

Run run home
Through green green grass
Warm blue eyes
Look into the mirror world
Past ugly golden lies
See what i see inside
Dandelion
In my eye

I can see
Through my dandelion eye

Broken skin
Poison vein
Dandelion
In my eye
I can see inside
Through my dandelion eye

Am i am i gemini
