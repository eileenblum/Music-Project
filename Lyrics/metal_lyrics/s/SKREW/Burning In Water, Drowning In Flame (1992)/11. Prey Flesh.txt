Scarred and innocent flesh
Benumbed and stratified
Pins and needles skin and bones

It comes between all my skin
It's never satisfied
Bleeding, breathing, seeking home

Reproduction, fascination
What it won't take from me
Take from you
Take from me
Take from me all my senses
No security
I raise my hands up to you

Pray now down on your knees
I have no feeling disease
Won't stop my feelings due
I raise my hands up to you
