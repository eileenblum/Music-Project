Falling - harder than I feel.
Realize - this pain is more than realcritisize - me for who I am.
Don't threaten me. don't run away.
I will forgive you for judging and not taking my hand.
Running - from myself.
Cowardly is what I am.
Sympathize - with my beliefs.
You don't give a damn.
Ostrasize - out of spite.
I don't want to fight
