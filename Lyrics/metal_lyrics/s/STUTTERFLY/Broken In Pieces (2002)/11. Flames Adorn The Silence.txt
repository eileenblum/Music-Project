Keep your lips up,
Hold your tongue,
Glimpe of hatred,
Eclipse the sun.
As you worship me,
What you love.
Yes I try now, to ignore.
Stare at another part of my eyes,
and your heart
Your a joke, now your dead.
Your so livid, as the epitome dies
Bleed on me,
This life a shell
and so its living hell
On your second chance,
Its time to take a stance now
Repetitions hold is a fire side
Does the competition take the part
Open your eyes,
For what I got
Sever the ties,
Erase my life
Take a look at yourself,
and put your heart upon the shelf,
It still bleeds, these wounds wont heal,
This pain inside is all thats real
Fall, As fire.
Fall as fire from
From the skies above
