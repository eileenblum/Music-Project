Shut up.
I can feel this anger, it fills me up inside.
The world is full of hatred, there's no place to hide.
Running no more.
Face it here, now, then, and forever.
Shut up - and listen.
Feel it - around you.
Rise up against this hate that surrounds us.
Righteous anger flowing through me spirit fall and fill me up now.
It's time to break this coldness.
It's time to change these feelings.
It's time to win this war.
It's time for peace and for the healing.
