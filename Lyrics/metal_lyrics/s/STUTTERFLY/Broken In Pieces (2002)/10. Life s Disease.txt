I feel so numb.
All I've become has fallen apart.
Hole in my heart,
Severed fragments of my being pieced together give life meaning.
Fragile quilt offaded memories torn apart by life's disease...
Again I will cry, all is a lie, that you must break, heal my heartache.
10.Flames Adorn The Silence
Fall as fire, from the sky.
