I feel frustration set in.
Temptation's too much to bare.
Fighting my own thoughts I've failed.
Finally, I don't care.
Give into what I've been fighting.
It brings me to my knees.
Using my own strength I've failed, please... pull me out of the mud.
Crawling and falling again.
Forgiven by the blood.
Over and over again.
Fall on my knees cause I want to feel you.
Break me right now.
All this pain that's pounding in my sick head.
Free me somehow.
Pull me out of the mud.
Realize that forgiveness starts with the blood.
