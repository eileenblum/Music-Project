Can't take my life without a fight.
Don't kill my soul, you have no right.
Please let me choose if I want to live.
Maybe some day I'll have solutions to give.
I feel the pain inside.
I see the tears in your eyes.
I want to see the light.
Mother I'll say good night.
You stole my life, ripped my body apart.
A silent scream from my lungs.
You stopped my beating heart.
I was alive, I had no choice.
I cried out loud, no one heard my voice.
I felt all the pain inside, I saw the tears in your eyes.
I wanted to see the light.
Mother I'll say goodbye.
