Violence in your soul.
Common sense you don't know.
Tired of being played.
Little boy you're just afraid.
I'm not your enemy.
I know you disagree.
You want to beat me down.
See me on the ground.
Close your eyes, see only hate.
Anger is a lonely state.
Pick on me because I'm weird.
Something that you feared.
