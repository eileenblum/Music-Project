Holding her down till she can't breath it's just a game, she's so naive.
You deceive her.
She believes you.
Then you rape her.
She can't fight you.
Sick pig.
She screams you smile sick pig, she's just a child.
You held her down.
Ripped her in two.
Look at the hell you put her through.
She begged you.
You didn't let go.
God have mercy on your soul.
This hell-sick.
You made-pig.
Just to-sick.
Get laid.
