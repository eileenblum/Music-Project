What, what was so bad?
What had he done to make you return, this time with a gun?

Intimidation growing bigger.
What the hell made you pull the trigger?

Spend a lifetime
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
Trying to understand.
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
Why you reason
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
With a gun in your hand?

Thought, thought this all through,
Thought it might be fun.
Shot in the head to show everyone.

Intimidation growing bigger.
What the hell made you pull the trigger?

Spend a lifetime
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
Trying to understand.
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
Why you reason
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
With a gun in your hand?

Held
In his friends arms.
Blood
On his face.
Hole
In his head.
Gripped
By deaths embrace.

In his embrace.

Spend a lifetime
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
Trying to understand.
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
Why you reason
(you want it, you got it, you feel it, gun in hand)
With a gun in your hand?
