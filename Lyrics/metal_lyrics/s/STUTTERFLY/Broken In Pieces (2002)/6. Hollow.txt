All this sickness hard to swallow.
Eats my insides until I'm hollow.
Indecision, fornication, condemnation, to damnation.
This world is a breeding ground.
Take a look at the bleeding ground.
Adoration, temptation, contemplation, to frustration.
You'll fall apart. don't drag me down.
You rule this world with a synthetic crown.
Kill each other for no reason to go against it, this is treason.
Action, reaction, action, reaction.
All this sickness forced to swallow.
Fills me inside, I must follow is this what you said for now?
Is this what you want to see?
This is going to piss me off, I will not agree
