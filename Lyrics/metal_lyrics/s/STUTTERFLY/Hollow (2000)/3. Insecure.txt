violence in your soul. common sense you don't know. tired of being played. little boy you're just afraid. I'm not your enemy. i know you disagree. you want to beat me down. see me on the ground. close your eyes, see only hate. anger is a lonely state. pick on me because I'm weird. something that you feared.
