all this sickness hard to swallow. eats my insides until I'm hollow. indecision, fornication, condemnation, to damnation. this world is a breeding ground. take a look at the bleeding ground. adoration, temptation, contemplation, to frustration. you'll fall apart. don't drag me down. you rule this world with a synthetic crown. kill each other for no reason to go against it, this is treason. action, reaction, action, reaction. all this sickness forced to swallow. fills me
inside, I must follow is this what you said for now? is this what you want to see? this is going to piss me off, i will not agree.
