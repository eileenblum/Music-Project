don't give in to...
...
turn your thoughts away
from what people say
it's time to go against
go against the flow
don't put on a show
stand for what's right
don't give up the fight
you will mock me
one day you'll see
in the world
wrong considered right
in society
don't has become life
go against the flow
don't put on a show
stand for what's right
don't give up the fight
you will mock me
one day you'll see
let's get this party started
bring out the alcohol
pop in the porno movies
we're going to have a ball
wake up with a hangover
don't remember what you've done
is this what you consider, consider having fun?
...
you've got to fight
and stand for what's right
you've got to go against the gray
You've got to
you're gonna pay
you've got to go against the gray
you've got to
you're gonna pay
