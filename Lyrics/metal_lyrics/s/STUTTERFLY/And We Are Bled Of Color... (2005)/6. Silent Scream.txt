Can't take my life, without a fight.
Don't kill my soul you have no right.

I feel the pain inside.
I see the tears in your eyes.
I want to see the light.
Mother I'll say good night.

You stole my life, ripped my body apart.

A silent scream from my lungs
You stopped my beating heart.

I feel the pain inside.
I see the tears in your eyes.
I want to see the light.
Mother I'll say good night.

Please let me choose if I want to live.
I was alive, i had no choice.
I cried out loud, no one heard my voice.

I felt all the pain inside,
I saw the tears in your eyes.
I wanted to see the light.
Mother I'll say goodbye.
