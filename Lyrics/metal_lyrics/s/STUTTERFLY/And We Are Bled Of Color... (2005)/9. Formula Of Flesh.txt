Starting at the silhouette of you
Sight unseen, your words speak the truth
Calculated infinite design
Educated equation benign

Failed from the start
Science breeds abuse
State of the art
Logic bending truth

Complicated formula of flesh
Contradicting transparent duress

Failed from the start
Science breeds abuse
State of the art
Logic bending truth

Faith in purposeful design
Leave coincidence behind
Theories sever what is beautiful

Failed from the start
Science breeds abuse
State of the art
Logic bending truth
