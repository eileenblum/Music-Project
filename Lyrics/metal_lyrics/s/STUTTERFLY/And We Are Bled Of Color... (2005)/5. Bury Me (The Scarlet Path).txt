I endure these ruptured thoughts
Heartsick forlorn waiting for the sin to rot
Decayed and torn

Walking down this path again
Will my heart ever mend

Bury me walk away
Thoughts unspoken
Bury me walk away
Fear is choking

Fall towards grace
Choose a path of innocence
Fell his Embrace

Walking down this path again
Will my heart ever mend

Bury me walk away
Thoughts unspoken
Bury me walk away
Fear is choking

Shattered life repaired

Bury me walk away
Thoughts unspoken
Bury me walk away
Fear is choking
