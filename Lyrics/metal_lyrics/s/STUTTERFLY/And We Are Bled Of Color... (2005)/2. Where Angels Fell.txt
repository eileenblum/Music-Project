I close my eyes
Feel Shadows swell

See prayers die
Where angels fell
I close my eyes
Feel shadows swell, in me

Hold me In your arms
As the tears flow
Promise me and say
I won't go I won't go

The new sun shone
The darkness gone

Fear is torn
Light is Reborn
The new sun shone
The darkness gone

Hold me In your arms
As the tears flow
Promise me and say
I won't go I won't go
