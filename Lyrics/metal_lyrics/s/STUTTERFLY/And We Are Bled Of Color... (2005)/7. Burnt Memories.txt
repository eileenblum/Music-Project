Porcelain like an infant's eyes
Glowing like a face on fire
Singing this lullaby
Painting a fatal goodbye

And we're bleeding colors of grey
Hear the screaming fade away

Burn these stains away
No memory, No memory of this
This pain these stains portray,
A memory, A memory from this

A canvas, your to beautify
Painting a peaceful goodbye

And we're bleeding colors of grey
Hear the screaming fade away

Burn these stains away
No memory, No memory of this
This pain these stains portray,
A memory, A memory of this

You'll hear the screaming fade away
White in place of black
I pray

Burn these stains away
No memory, No memory of this
This pain these stains portray,
A memory, A memory of this
