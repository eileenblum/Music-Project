Crying for the past
Is something we've all, done
Lying to, ourselves is a way
For us to run

We must die to
Ourselves to pull through

Watch as the sun bleeds red
It's far too real
Emotion's dead
The sun bleeds red

Dying to, ourselves is something
We must do
We must die to
Ourselves to pull through

Watch as the sun bleeds red
It's far too real
Emotion's dead
The sun bleeds red
