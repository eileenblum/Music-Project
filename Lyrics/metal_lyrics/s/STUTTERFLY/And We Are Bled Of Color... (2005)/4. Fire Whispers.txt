It's not who you are
It's not what you ask for
You're better than this
It'll be different

Fire burns inside
Fire and tears collide
Fire whispers
Fire

I am feeling so alone
Heart-strings pulled on broken bone
I am feeling so afraid
Bruised and bloody
Love betrayed

Nothing has changed
Wounds just grow deeper
With swollen eyes
Gather strength and leave

Fire burns inside
Fire and tears collide
Fire Whispers
Fire

I am feeling so alone
Heart-strings pulled on broken bone
I am feeling so afraid
Bruised and bloody
Love betrayed

It's not who you are
It's not who you are
It's not who you are

I am feeling
I am feeling so alone
Heart-strings pulled on broken bone
I am feeling so afraid
Bruised and bloody
Love betrayed

I am feeling so alone
Heart-strings pulled on broken bone
I am feeling so afraid
Bruised and bloody
Love betrayed
