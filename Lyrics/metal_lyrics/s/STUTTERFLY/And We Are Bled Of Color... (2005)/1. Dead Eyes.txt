Death Sweeps, across the place
Tombstones for eyes replaced
Lost child, unforgiven
Loathing for living

One Glance
Feel eyes fail left behind
Renounced

Forgive
The past hope will ring true
Don't wait for too long
Dead eyes will haunt you

It's taken its toll on you
Misshapen your soul's view
Feel dead while you're living
No one foreseeing

One Glance
Feel eyes fail left behind
Renounced

Forgive
The past hope will ring true
Don't wait for too long
Dead eyes will haunt you

Taken lives
Over hollow eyes
Hearts Breaking

Forgive
The past hope will ring true
Don't wait for too long
Dead eyes will haunt you
