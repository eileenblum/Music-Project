I feel so numb.
All I've become has fallen apart.
Hole in my heart,

Severed fragments of my being
Pieced together give life meaning
Fragile, quilt of faded memories
Torn apart by life's disease...

Again i will cry,
All is a lie,
That you must break, heal my heartache.

Severed fragments of my being
Pieced together give life meaning
Fragile, quilt of faded memories
Torn apart by life's disease...
