(SHALLOW!)
I will never open my heart
For fear it will break
Clinging desperately to the pieces
This is my mistake

It's my fault that I've shut you out
Darkness consumes the shadow of doubt

Broken pieces, shallow reasons

It's my fault that I've shut you out
Darkness consumes the shadow of doubt

Will I ever hold on to, you
Will I ever know what to do?

Don't weep for me it's my fault

It's my fault that I've shut you out
Darkness consumes the shadow of doubt
