Fire from ashes
You take flight
And enter darkness

Illuminate this life
Burn away the fear inside
Take away this pain and strife
Be purified

Fall, from above
So tired, of waiting and watching
Fill the lonely one
Ignite, forsaken souls

Laying dormant
Or so it seems,
So now awaken

Illuminate this life
Burn away the fear inside
Take away this pain and strife
Be purified

Fall, from above
So tired, of waiting and watching
Fill the lonely one
Ignite, forsaken souls

Be consumed by the breath of the ghost
Be consumed

Fall, from above
So tired, of waiting and watching
Fill the lonely one
Ignite, forsaken souls
