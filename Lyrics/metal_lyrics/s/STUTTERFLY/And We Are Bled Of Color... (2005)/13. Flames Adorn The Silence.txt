Keep your lips up,
Hold your tongue,
Glimpse of hatred,
Eclipse the sun.

As you worship me,
What you love?
Yes I try now, to ignore.
Stare at another part of my eyes,
and your heart
Your, a joke, now your dead.
Your, so livid, as the epitome dies

Bleed on me,
This life a shell
and so its living hell
On your second chance,
Its time to take a stance now

Repetitions hold is a fire side
Does the competition take the part?
Open your eyes,
For, what I got
Sever the ties,
Erase my life

Bleed on me,
This life a shell
and so its living hell
On your second chance,
Its time to take a stance now

Take a look at yourself,
and put your heart upon the shelf,
It still bleeds, these wounds wont heal,
This pain inside is all that's real

Fall, As fire.
Fall as fire from
From the skies above

Bleed on me,
This life a shell
and so its living hell
On your second chance,
Its time to take a stance now
