What, What was so bad?
What had he done?
To make you return,
This time with a gun?

Intimidation, Growing bigger
What the hell-
Made you pull the trigger.

Spend a lifetime (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
Trying to understand (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
Why you reason (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
With a gun in hand.

Thought, Thought this all through,
Thought it might be fun,
Shot in the head, To show everyone

Intimidation, Growing bigger,
What the hell,
Made you pull the trigger?

Spend a lifetime (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
Trying to understand (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
Why you reason (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
With a gun in hand.

Held in his friend's arm,
Blood on his face,
Hole in his head,
Gripped by death's embrace.

Blood in his friend's arms,
Blood streams down his face
(Held in his friend's arms)

Spend a lifetime (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
trying to understand (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
Why you reason (You want it, You got it, You feel it, Gun in hand)
With a gun in hand
