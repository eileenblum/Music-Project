Whenever darkness arises the shadow doesn't hide the traces of grief on
your face And though there's silence outside you can't begin a dream ... you waited far too long !

Flashing memories of warmth pretend a love that could once dry all the
tears in your eyes Now when he opens his arms what could it signify ... what do you feel ?

Hey, isn't it strange how feelings can change
Yes, love is a strange emotion ...
As time passes by you might realise - what a strange emotion

And on this Saturday night - the faint wind tries to hide the sound of
expectant quiet The shouting voices inside ... what do they signify - a silence far too long !

While flickering candles burn down and fake an atmosphere of peace and
romantic times Finally decide on your own - you leave him with a smile ... how do you feel ?

Hey, isn't it strange how feelings can change
Yes, love is a strange emotion ...
As time passes by you might realise - what a strange emotion

He thought your feelings last for long, for all his life
But now you proved him he was wrong â and you were right!
