Deep in my soul - fertile in sentiments â
gaining control, still subdued and hesitant
Thinking of peace for me, hoping my doubts might fade â
this is no game, I can't wait till it's much too late

I still believe, still keep our past alive
Just honesty or extraordinary lies ?

Deep in my mind raising continuously,
just fate might decide: future or history
Claiming to care for you, wondering if love can die â
fooling myself, don't I ? Or is it worth to fight ?

I still believe, still keep our past alive
Just honesty or extraordinary lies ?

I'm faking dreams - incessantly
It's build on lies - or justified ?
