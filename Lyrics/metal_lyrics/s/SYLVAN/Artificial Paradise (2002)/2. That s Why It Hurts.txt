I am searching for the silence, hear the sound of pouring rain
An insisting voice of nature as persistent as my pain

And I stare out of the window, see the rain clouds passing by
A continuous alternation as unstable as my life

It's this everlasting echo, it's this dreadful empty room
It surrounds me full of memories and frustration conquers soon

And why the hell I have to suffer when the wind speaks out your name
And in my egocentric vision - psychologically insane

I shed all my tears, alone in this world
but the longer I weep the more it burns

I whisper my pain, try to fill it with words
but you took them away, that's why it hurts

Read the last words that you left me 'cos there's nothing else to do
Seems as if I hear your voice so I look up, but where are you

Don't know how long I can stand this - still your perfume in our bed
God, this emptiness will kill me if I'm not already dead

When I think of bygone moments - yearning water in my eyes
Still a lot I'd like to tell you, but I can not turn back time

And why the hell I have to suffer in this cruel and unfair world
And when the sun comes out to warm me it's still cold and still it hurts

I shed all my tears, alone in this world
but the longer I weep the more it burns

I whisper my pain, try to fill it with words
but you took them away, that's why it hurts

Why did it slip away And in the end just memories
Why did those blooming days discolour so synthetically

How should I see with my eyes How should I know that all the things
might die How should I start to realise - now I know How should I feel
you'll leave me How should I know that I'm too blind to see How should
I know it's too deep - now I know !
