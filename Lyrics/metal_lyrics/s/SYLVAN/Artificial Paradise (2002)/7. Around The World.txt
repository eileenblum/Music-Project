When the streets wake up we open our eyes - in a dream
When the day replaces the night we get up and feel
This is our choice, this is our reason, this is how we live!

Well, we never thought of wasting our time, yes we know
Never ever show your feelings â that's how it goes
This is our deed, this is our reason, this is how we live!

Around the world â an industrious storm in a long evolution
Around the world â without space for our own individual illusions
Around the world â a new big global stream, thatÂ´s our modern solution

Around the world ... When we look around, indeed full of pride - donÂ´t
you feel? Did you ever realise in what we succeeded
This is our dream, this is our reason, this is how we live!

When the city sleeps we close our eyes and it's true
You can be a star or loser, that's up to you
This is our way, this is our reason, this is how we live!

Around the world â an industrious storm in a long evolution
Around the world â without space for own individual illusions
Around the world â a new big global stream, that's our modern solution
Around the world ...

Running around ...
