Did you ever fight? Did you ever fear that things go wrong?
Did you ever, did you ever loose though you always believed you're strong?
It's the moment that you open your eyes and see ...

I still remember all my cares and all my doubts - the relics of my past
I learned from you for all my life, but now that you are weak please
learn from me!
