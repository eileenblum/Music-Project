When I said I had no doubts while I tried to comfort you - did I tell
you that I lied ? When I gave you confidence though I feared the things
I knew â only secretly I cried Even when I felt so sad always tried to
keep my smile â still don't know if I was right But though my force was
fading away, even my tears they dried out some day ... finally I realised

And you gave me reasons forever
Did you feel the faith you brought into my life
And your timeless traces won't shatter
When you see the glint of hope deep in my eyes

Leave your worries behind, leave your sorrows behind you
Leave your worries behind, leave those troubles behind with a feeling of quiet

Did you ever realise that I couldn't show my care when I held your hand
in mine Far to near the consequence that I might have broken down â I
assure you that I tried Still I have those words in mind, still
remember all my tears when we had to say goodbye But all my pain has
faded away, even my sorrows dried out some day ... in the end I realised

And you gave me reasons forever
Did you feel the faith you brought into my life
And your timeless traces won't shatter
When you see the glint of hope deep in my eyes
