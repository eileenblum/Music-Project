I'm a crap crease,
Did I start to sleep?
Watch the clouds drift by...
Look out and I feel,
Small and so unreal,
I think of me
Sight's not clear, I am losing me,
I'm begging, please,
Who can hear me?

Flying to the stars, way down or far up?
Feel the time runs out...
Thinking of the past,
If this day's my last
Who'll think of me?

In my eyes
I fly a long way back in time...
And I fly
In the midst of bluish skies...
See me
As my flight comes to a close
See me
When I dared to let it go
In my eyes where the wind provokes my tears of shame
In my eyes where my memories take the fuel away

While I fly
See the man that I became
Losing height
As the pressure rises again
See me,
But I cannot understand
See me,
When the choice lay in my hands
In my eyes when the wind provokes my tears of shame
In my eyes where my memories take the fuel away
In my eyes rage the storms that make my landing fail
In my eyes see the shadows of my vapour trail

Then faces, in a sort of flashback
Hey the faces, don't you stare at me!
The faces mumble words... I lose track
And the faces whisper dazzlingly

The faces, how the hell they've found me?
But the faces know the answer well
The faces, quite a few that I see
What the faces round me try to tell?
All faces, in a kind of weird show
All these faces, I know them personally
But there's one face that I really don't know
And this lonely hollow face that's me!

Now that I flew back here... and here I cry
All this time
Felt my emptiness inside
See me
As my plane is falling low
See me
As the sight begins to grow
In my eyes when the wind provokes my tears of shame
In my eyes where my memories take the fuel away
In my eyes rage the storms that make my landing fail
In my eyes see the shadows of my vapour trail

Flying from my past, way up and above
Leave the time behind
Heading for the stars, for the ones I love,
I think of you
Do you dream or think of me?
I'm hoping please, can you hear me?
