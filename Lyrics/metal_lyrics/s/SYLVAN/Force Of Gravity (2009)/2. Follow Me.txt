Hear my call,
Me tempting my melody, let us talk
Feel my force,
Taste the new philosophy, take it all
Join my house
And enjoy the amnesty, don't let me down
Try it out,
Choose my toxicity, I'd be proud

Follow me, follow me, follow me
And profit from a risk you'll never fear financially
Follow me, follow me, follow me
And you can stuff yourself with money avariciously
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't give a damn on fuddy-duddy, stiff morality
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me...

Come and find,
Want a million, one, two, three?
Come and try
Here you sign,
Why to price complexity, and good-bye

Follow me, follow me, follow me
And profit from a risk you'll never fear financially
Follow me, follow me, follow me
And you can stuff yourself with money avariciously
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't give a damn on fuddy-duddy, stiff morality
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me...

Millions upfront... follow me now
Options and bonds... follow me now, follow me now
Swaptions and floors... follow me now
Caplets and more... follow me now, follow me now, follow me now
ABCP... follow me now
King SVP... follow me now, follow me now
Enquity shares... follow me now
CDO squares... follow me now... up and downs...

Hear my call,
Give a damn on bankruptcy, huge and not small
Crash and fall
With a bonus guaranteed, get it all

Follow me, follow me, follow me
And profit from a risk you'll never fear financially
Follow me, follow me, follow me
And you can stuff yourself with money avariciously
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't give a damn on fuddy-duddy, stiff morality
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
