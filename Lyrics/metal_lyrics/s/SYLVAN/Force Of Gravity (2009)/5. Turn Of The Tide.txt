Way up
In a second
Way down
And again back up
Somehow
It's a changeable, odd life
Break down
For a minute
Stand up
And sometimes back out
Somehow
It's a contradictory life

Hold on till the floods of tears have dried
Wait for a new turn of the tide

Give up
In dark hours
Fall down
While someone will rise
Face out,
Gain your power
Hear out
The disharmony of life

Hold on...
Hold on...
Hold on...
Hold on...

Hold on till the floods of tears have dried
Wait for a new turn of the tide
Hold on till the floods of tears have dried
Wait for a new turn of the tide

Love and glee and hate and grief and war and peace and chaos, chaos
Bombs and greed, proximity and contrary and chaos, chaos...
Bright and clear, in times you'll see
And bright and clear, in times you'll see
And bright and clear, in times you'll see
And bright and clear, in times you'll see and...
