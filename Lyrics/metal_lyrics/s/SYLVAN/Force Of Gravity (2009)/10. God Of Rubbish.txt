That's far too different
Too insignificant,
You know
What are those harmonies?
Progressive?
Useless complexity...

Watch out, I'll come!
Watch out, I'll show you!
Watch out my friend!
I should ignore you!
No frippery!
Please not artistic!
And not profound!
Keep it simplistic!
Airy-fairy tales...

I'm not sluggish, I'm the God of rubbish
I'm a crap creator, tickled pink gold saver
I am great, God knows it!
Kick it fast, compose shit!
I'm a billion brilliant billboard dream...

Come out and here!
Come out and listen!
My music sells!
So grasp my wisdom!
No symphony!
Just for the money!
King radio
Will kiss you, honey!
Airy-fairy tales...

I'm not sluggish, I'm the God of rubbish
I'm a crap creator, tickled pink gold saver
I am great, God knows it!
Kick it fast, compose shit!
I'm a billion brilliant billboard dream...

Interested in success?
Come baby, kiss my ass!
I'm not sluggish, I'm the God of rubbish
I'm a crap creator, tickled pink gold saver
I am great, God knows it!
Kick it fast, compose shit!
I'm a billion brilliant billboard dream...
I'm not sluggish, I'm the God of rubbish
