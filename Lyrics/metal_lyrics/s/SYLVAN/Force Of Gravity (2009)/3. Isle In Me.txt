When I greet the morning
With a smile you always loved
And I leave my bed,
Now empty and sometimes it breaks my heart
Then I pause a second,
Breathe the air you left for me,
Which fills my room with green,
Reminds me of our dreams
When I let the sun in
And the coffee warms me up
With a hint of sorrow
I dream of things we both were dreaming of
And I dream of mountains
Higher than the ache in me,
Catch water against the drought,
Where we'll meet beyond the clouds

Live for the dreams you shared with me
Live for the places where we'll meet
Live for our mystic scenery
Live for my isle we'll visit again

When I face the window,
See reflections of your face
And behind your eyes
The distance creates an image of our place
There I see the ocean,
Deeper than the pain I feel
Though endless miles apart
I will meet you in my heart

Live for the dreams you shared with me
Live for the places where we'll meet
Live for our mystic scenery
Live for my isle we'll visit again

Once we lived our life,
Then you were near and joy withstood the time
The places that we dreamt of,
The paintings that we draw
That no one could take us away,
That no one but us ever saw
Against the flow of time
I realized that only love survives
And you did never leave my life,
Still near mountains and oceans we hide
On my isle you stand by my side...
You're always by my side...

When I turn the light off,
Kiss your dreamly lips goodnight
Then I turn my head and start to sing my love a lullaby
When I close my eyes
A universe you offer me
Our universe this night
I dream now
And I smile
