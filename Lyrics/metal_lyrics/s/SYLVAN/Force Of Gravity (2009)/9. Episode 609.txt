I take my time
For the friends that I never had
And here I find
A world made for me
Everyday
With a family I chose instead
Hear the words I say
To my friends on the screen:

"Why do you cry?
Please don't sigh,
I'll be watching
I live your life,
Day and night,
I'll be there..."

In the end
I am sure I can ease the pain
With their tears
They cover up mine
Their mysteries,
With the credits they die away
But their sympathy
In my dreams they remain

"Why do you cry?
Please don't sigh,
I'll be watching
I live your life,
Day and night,
I'll be there...
Why do you cry?
Please don't sigh,
I'll be watching
I live your life,
Day and night,
I'll be there..."

Why isn't life as easy as it's meant to be?
And why isn't there a happy-end as on TV?
And why isn't life as easy as it's meant to be?
And why isn't there a happy-end as on TV?
And why...

Why isn't life as easy as it's meant to be?
And why isn't there a happy-end as on TV?
And why isn't life as easy as it's meant to be?
And why isn't there a happy-end as on TV?
Why isn't life as easy as it's meant to be?
And why isn't there a happy-end as on TV?
And why isn't life as easy as it's meant to be?
And why isn't there a happy-end as on TV?

I take my time
For my friends that I never had
And when I cry
I'm never alone

"Why do you cry?
Please don't sigh,
I'll be watching
I live your life,
Day and night,
I'll be there...
Why do you cry?
Please don't sigh,
I'll be watching
I live your life,
Day and night,
I'll be there..."

" Why do you cry?
Please don't sigh,
I'll be watching
I live your life,
Day and night,
I'll be there..."
