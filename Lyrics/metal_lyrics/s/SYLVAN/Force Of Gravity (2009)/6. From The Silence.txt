So it starts, grow microscopic
Tiny parts...
From the silence
Water blue, so scientific
Fast and new,
From the silence... after all...

Solid grounds, deterministic,
Walk around...
From the silence
Apes in gowns, now realistic,
Up from down...
From the silence... after all...

Come from the silence and the silence will come after all
Clair what you find and you will find you'll be to blame for it all

Cross-armed force, but nihilistic,
Time to walk...
From the silence
Holy right, perhaps symbolic,
Infinite...
From the silence... after all...

Come from the silence and the silence will come after all
Clair what you find and you will find you'll be to blame for it all
Come from the silence and the silence will come after all
Clair what you find and you will find you'll be to blame for it all

Huge black towns, quite fatalistic,
Endless sounds...
From the silence
Epilogue, somehow pathetic,
Out-of-vogue...
To the silence... after all...

Come from the silence and the silence will come after all
Clair what you find and you will find you'll be to blame for it all
Come from the silence and the silence will come after all
Come from the silence and the silence will come after all
