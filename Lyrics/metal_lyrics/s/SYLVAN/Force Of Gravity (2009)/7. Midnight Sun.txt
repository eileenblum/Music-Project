An ice crystal ocean
As far as the eye can see
And when I listen closely
The silence speaks
To me
And while I listen closely,
A peaceful majesty

An old scenic painting
From a time beyond the floes of ice
And when you watch it closely
A beauty takes the lead
And while you watch it closely,
It's sunken in the sea

But where to find?
But where to find?
Where is this ocean?
Where is this sea of ice?

A quiet distant ocean
Dressed in divine simplicity
And though I listen closely,
Where might it be?
And while I listen closely,
Quiet melancholy,
Starting to happen...

But where to find?
But where to find?
Guide me,
Oceans of ice
Don't you guide me,
Oceans of ice
Please don't you guide me,
Oceans of ice
Please don't you guide me

Ageless ice...
Pulling me under
To life...
