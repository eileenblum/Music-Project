Every day's a miraculous voyage for you
And each night an adventurous dream
And the secrets I'm lucky to unseal with you
Bliss in your eyes
That opened up mine

Embedded in you so deeply bound
Embedded in you so near
Embedded in you, a peace profound
Embedded in you,
Embedded in you

In your heart could be wizard or lover for you
Your companion in fabulous worlds
When a monster besieges your bed, be sure
I'm looking for you,
That's what I'll do

Embedded in you so deeply bound
Embedded in you so near
Embedded in you, a peace profound
Embedded in you,
Embedded in you

I'll be your knight,
Bravely fight against the dragons in your life,
By your side...
By your side...

Embedded in you so deeply bound
Embedded in you,
Embedded in you
Embedded in you so deeply bound
Embedded in you so near
Embedded in you, a peace profound
Embedded in you,
Embedded in you
