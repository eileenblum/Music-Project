Now they read 'bout things that they should know: of break-ups and divorce
Statistically the figures tend to grow, this article deplores

Virtually impossible, it seems, that couples coexist
Literally interpreted it means that dreams might not persist...

But our love, eternally, withstands and braves this storm with ease... for sure!

Logically..., this paragraph concludes, ...society bears the blame
Regrettably - and this is nothing new - a bitter taste remains...

But our love, our family will face this dare and finally succeed... oh, please!
And our confidence will hopefully prevail over tendencies... I know...

Lift me up and never let me down!
Lift me up where you can form the clouds with me!
And our castle we will shape here out of
these clouds will prove unshakable for me...

... and then they put them down... those scrapped articles that they have found...
... where the candle sends off light of doubt... they open the door, look back and blow it out...

When you wake I'll receive you, and that moment I'll greet you...
With my heart I will touch you... and that day we will shine!
