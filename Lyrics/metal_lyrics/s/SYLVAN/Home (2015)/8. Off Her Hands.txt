That day the clouds brought rain and it went viral in her head
She could not quite explain - was it due to what she read?
That's when her thoughts spread out and the wind raged above her...
Somehow the storm brought doubts - now they'll stay there...

What if you needed shelter, that I can't provide?
Could I always protect you from all that's outside?

Was she afraid to be vulnerable here? Just because she once knew it?
She got infected by threads and old fearsâ¦ got intrudedâ¦

What if you needed shelter, that I can't provide?
Could I always protect you from all that's outside?

Every night and every day, she's not immune, it won't go away
What's the price that we'll pay? Is it our punishment? Who's to say?
Battlefields of our life, the enemy's here and it waits inside
In our veins, that is where it will fight... so insatiably!

What if you needed shelter, that I can't provide?
Could I always protect you from all that's outside?
How should I ever love you with pain in my heart?
For the fear I could lose you would tear me apart!

That day the clouds brought rain and she plagued herself with dread
It did not wash away all these headlines in her head...
