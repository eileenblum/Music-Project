Thoughts, sometimes sad and sometimes bright, once conceived won't go away
With time, somehow cruel and volatile, they intensify
Somewhere they have reached her, unperceived, so faint, so quiet
And she is so fragile, like the vulnerable child that she keeps inside...

The paintings that you draw in your world, so easily they grace and they shine
A fancy from your childhood returned, but sometimes you just draw it black and white

Dreams, sometimes shaded, sometimes light,
once they're forged they fade away
At times, with a stroke of wing they fly off eternally...

The paintings that you draw in your world,
so easily they grace and they shine
A fancy from your childhood returned,
but sometimes you just draw it black and white

Stillness spreads out slowly, makes itself at home
In this house where she thrived, she now feels alone

Whispers from a foretime fill her heart with rain
Once somebody left here all the grief that never died away
