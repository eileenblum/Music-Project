In a corner of her head lies a known but dead-end place
Where the torments hunt her down since she found Pandora's case
In her hand she holds a note,
it was buried here all those painful years, all her life
... and it strikes her down!
As she sinks down on the floor, as she cries
just to deplore the disgrace with tears on her face:
What have you done? Why did you throw me away?

My dear, did I quite let you down?
And I thought I followed you through all these years...
My love, I was always around! I was the cold wind,
brought you shivers of fears!

In her mind the time stands
still and no sound can reach her ear
Singularity of sense... then the words just reappear
They were written long ago, soaked in tearfulness,
a bitter consequence... even now
... and it strikes her down!

All the relics of this world,
all the reasons they were kept in this case...
she screams in a rage
Mother, you lied!
How could you throw me away?

My dear, did I quite let you down?
And I thought I followed you through all these years...
My love, I was always around!
I was the cold wind, brought you shivers of fears!

Hold me, tight... enough for me now...
Lead me, right... enough for me now...
Know me, wise... enough for me now...
Show me, in sight...
