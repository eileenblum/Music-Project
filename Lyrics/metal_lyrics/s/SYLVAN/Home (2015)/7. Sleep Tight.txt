You, my dear, sleep tight! Leave the day behind you...
You, my love, sleep tight! Let me read out tonight...
I'll promise to soothe you, no danger will stray...
All worries that haunt you, I'll blow them away...

Swallowed the pill to fool you, nightmares gobbed distorted lies
Implicit trust that led to awakenings with bitter cries

Take it away from me... take it away!

So unscrupulous and pharmaceutically blasphemous
It kills a motherly happiness she once could feel...
And in her sleep relentlessly emerges an imagery that won't go away!

Am I asleep or awake? Is it night, is it day? I don't know ... don't know ...
But for god's sake, please blow it away!

I could not trust in you, how should you ever trust me? And I sleep...

You, my dear, sleep tight! Leave your past behind you...
You, my love, sleep tight! Let me blow out the light...
