Rockets waiting to traverse the iron wall
Threateningly towering above it all
Targeting a homeland that's about to change
Every house and every home is within range... and...

From those cold days soars a breath to touch her face
When, back here, she opens up the tempting case
What she reads unveils a feel she used to know
Bring back images from thirty years ago

Don't you let it out!

When she was a child she often felt alone
Without family and always without love, without home
And she often wondered where to find her source
That's when history was just about to take its course

In between those rockets she was not afraid
For there was no homeland to annihilate
When she puts the old article back inside
Once again she feels just like the orphaned child

Don't you let it out!

Soldiers waiting to invade and governments who escalate
When psychopaths can play the boss and no-one cares of human loss
Raving nuclear armament, huge flattops, anti-aircraft tanks
And I can't sort thing out, no, I can't sort it, I can't get it!

Troops intimidating us with wild testosteronic lust
And a child is sitting in between, my home, where deserts should be green
Will childhood innocence transform to something different?
How could I?

Nothing grows on wrong, nothing grows on right...
Nothing sees the day when it can not stand the night...

... and the situation starts to escalate...
... as bilateral tensions now exacerbate...
... diplomatic ties were broken off tonight...
... red alert proclaimed this morning nationwide...
