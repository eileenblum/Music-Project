Here... she sits down and cries...
With the case, in the flickering light, beside...

Now... it's time to decide...
and the breeze of her mother, with time, falls quiet...

And now, that they have brought to life
A treasure that has grown inside
Devoid of fears, beyond the past,
they realise it's worth at last

The case is gone, the wind has ceased, each day they value now with ease
And closer to the sky, it seems, they finally arrived...

When you wake I'll receive you, and that moment I'll greet you...
With a rose I will paint you... and today it will shine!
