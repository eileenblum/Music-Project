I got to shut them up... I got to rule it out...
I got to bring them down... and find a way somehow...
Speak to me every day... voices inside my head...
I must not take the charge... thatÂ´s what the voices said...
No time to hesitate... feel how it starts to burn...
Approach the final day... the point of no return...

ItÂ´s a breeze, you feast on dirt that you eat... just this youÂ´ll learn right here!
Disturbingly, get real, go down on your knees... the weakest have to bleed!

Over the cloud-covered sky... where sorrows unwind...
Here against the head wind I fly... and leave it behind...

Victimized, you bite the bullet and hide... oh boy, you are dead right!

Over the cloud-covered sky... where sorrows unwind...
Here against the head wind I fly... and leave it behind...
