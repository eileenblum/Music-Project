Worn and drained, innocent, so weak and faint
Huddled for us, now bled white in exchange for our life

Hear it's call... this is our last unicorn...
Wounded and displaced, unheard it will fall... then we will have lost it allâ¦

Exploited lands... depleted soil... feigned ignorance
Here, timidly... from dreams reborn... she draws the lonely unicorn...

With the eyes of a child, we'd trace it!
With the eyes of a child, we'd see!
We would cherish the world, full of roses!
And our last unicorn, it would live!

What a choice... will it be...
from where it came to me?
What on earth... our legacy...
can it live truly?
