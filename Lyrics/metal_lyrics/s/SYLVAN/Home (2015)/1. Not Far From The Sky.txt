Waitâ¦ approach them insideâ¦ jointly expectant and quiet, awhileâ¦
Hereâ¦ not far from the skyâ¦ with a case, in the flickering light, besideâ¦

Lovedâ¦ their seed inside, feel feather-lightâ¦ with faith in their clear eyesâ¦
A droughtâ¦ itâs passing byâ¦ just volatileâ¦ it followed them here and tonight

This onceâ¦ I feel this is my chanceâ¦ Iâm sure we are, no doubt, somehow at home now!
Deeplyâ¦ I sense that it grows in meâ¦ oh please let it, this time, be my cloud nine!

This is a magical and pure and an extraordinary time!
Here, full of candy-coloured garlands I can leave it all behind!
And in this land of milk and honey waits my natural paradise!
Where we can settle down forever, no matter what will wait outside!

Here... where prospects reside...
they're about to find out what the case could hide...
