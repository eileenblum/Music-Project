No-one ever dared believe
A deed that lay beyond their needs,
Although one could yet feel,
Although it was so near...
And no-one knew the consequence
Who should have known?
Who should have known?

The mess of regularity
It forced her unpredictably
Although she could yet feel
Departure was so near
Announcement never vocalised
Who should have known?
Who should have known?
