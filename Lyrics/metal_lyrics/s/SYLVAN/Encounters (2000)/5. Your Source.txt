Do you recall all the tears that she dried,
Every soothing care, she is your source
Your source, your source
Do you recall how she opened your mind,
Brightened up your life, she is your source
Your source, your source
Though far away you miss her
Never regret, never regret,
Never regret, never regret, never regret, never regret

Do you recall how the distance was clear
Friendship of your day, she is your source
Your source, your source
Do you recall something waiting out there,
So you went away, she is your source
Your source, your source
Your memories will burn forever,
Never forget, never forget,
Never forget, never forget, never forget, never forget

Darkness all around you,
Prophecy decided,
Darkness all around you,
Though once there was light,
Darkness all around you,
Destiny's first child...
Never regret, never regret, never forget, never forget,
Never regret, never regret, never forget, never forget,
Never regret

Do you recall fading sunsets of gold,
Still you smell your home, this is your source
Your source, your source
Do you recall how she gave you support,
Yes you know she'll stay always your source,
Your source, your source
