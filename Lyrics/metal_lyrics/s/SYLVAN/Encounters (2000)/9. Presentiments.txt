And they whisper soft, it's a breath of air and a sigh for future times
See the distant glint, almost powerful with a wave of cryptic signs
Now vibrating winds sprout so constantly, can you hear these sounds of joy?
Even oceans sing and their melodies prophecy the change of all that they knew before

The sky will shine...
The storm will spin...
Seas rage as once
They welcomed him
The lands might shake,
But time stands still,
Forgotten realms that you fulfill
The sky will shine...
The storm will spin...
Seas rage as once
They welcomed him
The lands might shake,
But time stands still,
Forgotten realms that you fulfill
That you fulfill
That you fulfill

Glimpse of moments,
Not yet concrete but clear,
Did you feel the breathe,
Drops will become a stream
Just one instant, far away but still near,
Did she speak to you:  this is your dream
Glimpse of moments,
Not yet concrete but clear,
Did you feel the breathe,
Drops will become a stream
