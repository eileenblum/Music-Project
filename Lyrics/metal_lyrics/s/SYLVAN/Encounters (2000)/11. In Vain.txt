You smile, you charm, you hold his sense
Bewilder everything
So hard to see, you can hardly keep back your tears
So innocent, you enchant the world,
But you don't care at all,
Seek something else
You're blinding,
You're hiding...

If you held out your hand, would it be such a dangerous deed?
Would you lose your dream?
If you held out your hand, you could hope that your prince's waiting near...
Should he wait in vain?

You give, you play a twinkling star,
But never close enough
And when you shine you hide how fragile you are
So differently, repulsive force
That's why you hesitate
But somehow more
You're blinding,
You're hiding...

If you held out your hand, would it be such a dangerous deed?
Would you lose your dream?
If you held out your hand, you could hope that your prince's waiting near...
Should he wait in vain?

It's silent all around,
A shattered trace...
The dim glow hesitates to light your face
Your ego smeared all that remains this night
A shadow on your face,
Should all this fade in emptiness?
Oh no!  Oh no!
Love should not be wasted in vain

If you held out your hand, would it be such a dangerous deed?
Would you lose your dream?
If you held out your hand, you could hope that your prince's waiting near...
Should he wait in vain?
