About to leave...
Cling to intimacy you used to feel
No-one ever blames you for your fears
It's nothing but your destiny
And though it's contradictory, you just leave
Leave...
Don't turn from separation desperately
Outgrow the sadness you can not conceal
A journey to an unknown land
A journey that might change it all
No matter who decides and so you leave!

You'll fill the gap between these worlds, you'll grab for destiny
You will pronounce unspoken words, a strange conspiracy
Open your eyes!

Oh yes, you will create chaotic rules, you'll change normality
You came from sun and air and moon, fulfill your prophecy
Open your eyes!
