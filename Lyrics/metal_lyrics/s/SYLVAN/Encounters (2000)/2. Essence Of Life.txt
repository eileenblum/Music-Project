Hey, did I ever tell
About the cute tick called Pete,
He lived his life quite well,
Though he was a complete freak
You should believe me,
He's the kind of tick you wanna meet
Led a lone life in peace,
Oh yeah he was quite tough... tick Pete
Oh sweet little Pete, that's your life...

Little Pete once was in a nasty mood and so he asked himself:
'What's the reason that I don't feel good?'
He had a feeling that was rather strange
And so Pete knew that all he needs was just a blood group change
Once someone told him of a place somewhere,
So he left home although he knew that it would be hard to get there
You see his planning was quite terrific,
That's why I told you our Pete was such a cool, tough tick

Walking away...
Walking away my friend...
Walking away...
Walking away my friend...
Walking away...

Life,
What does it mean to you?
However you get through,
Each has another real essence of life,
Who can make sense of it?
Some may think life's just shit
Some think that blood is the essence of life!

Travelling from host to host,
Always alone no matter the time it costs,
So far from home

When he got there,
It was like paradise, a new sensation,
You should have seen his eyes
And Pete was quite pleased,
Blood in variety, so he did not even see the impending tragedy

How should he know,
Just a stranger after all, but blood in Soho
May contain alcohol!

Most of his time Pete was in a sort of, let's say, delirium
He lost from time to time his style and equilibrium
You might conclude:  in a city, what a pity, but he will lose the day
But drugs create indifference,
So Pete doesn't care, anyway!

They fade away,
The pheromones of bygone days,
What's left to say...
Different priorities!

Drifting away...
Drifting away...
Drifting away...

Life,
What does it mean to you?
However you get through,
Each has another real essence of life,
Who can make sense of it?
Some may think life's just shit
Some think that blood is the essence of life!
Essence of life!
Essence of life!
Essence of life!

Life,
What does it mean to you?
However you get through,
Each has another real essence of life,
Who can make sense of it?
Some may think life's just shit
Some think that blood is the essence of life!
