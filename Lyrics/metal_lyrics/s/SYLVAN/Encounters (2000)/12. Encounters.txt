One decision,
One encounter of fate, on a threshold of dreams...
This is your, this is your, this is your, this is your dream

Strange reunion whether future or past
Yet a million times
Changed the flow of life, new life, new life
Other journeys,
Other lands will arise,
Start it once again, creating a new life!
New life, new life!

Don't be sorry,
Little girl don't be sad...
Though you lost this force,
Forever rest our source

No-one ever dares believe,
A deed that lies beyond their needs
Although one can yet feel...
