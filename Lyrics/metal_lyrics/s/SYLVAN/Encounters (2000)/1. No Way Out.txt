Thought I knew it would be hard to get through
How to know it hurts so miserably
You did not deserve the trust put in you
Even my dreams may fade to obscurity
If I could forget the things said and done
Yes I'd like to find the faith without doubt
Can't you see except you I have no one,
So even leaving you, that's not way out!
That's no way out!
That's no way out!
That's no way out!

Neither with you nor existence alone
Sadness lead me to confusion unknown
Am I blessed or am I at least just proud,
And leaving you, that's no way out!
That's no way out, no, no, no!
That's no way out!
That's no way out!

I am attempting to convince myself of liberty,
That even lovers do require certain space to feel free
But in the end I realise that we both can not change
I truly need you, there's no way out!

How should I sleep, how should I breathe, how should I face the truth
How should I choose without regrets, tell me,
That's no way out!
That's no way out!
That's no way out!
That's no way out!

I am attempting to convince myself of liberty,
That even lovers do require certain space to feel free
But in the end I realise that we both can not change
I truly need you, there's no way out!

That's no way out!
That's no way out!
That's no way out, that's no way!
That's no way!
That's no way out, yeah!
That's no way!
That's no way!
That's no way out, yeah!
That's no way!
That's no way!
That's no way out, yeah!

How should I sleep, how should I breathe, how should I face the truth
How should I choose without regrets, tell me, what should I do
