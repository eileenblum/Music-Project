Just a stranger of obscurity but you've finally arrived
Tell me, is it strength or is it weakness if one pushes you aside
But you found a place to stay apart from where he made his rules
While you wonder about your task, the prophecy might yet come true

You can feel that he is present but you never say his sight
Elemental discrepancy, he's made of earth and you of light
In his tight conservatism he is sure you'll never fit
Though rejecting your whole vision you embody all he missed

Would you feel better now, if things never changed?
Would it be better if just all stayed the same?
Would you feel better now, to leave and give in?
Or does it feel good somehow, to differ from him?

You feel a rush,
He's turning round and round
You changed too much,
This is his place that he first found
A huge repulsive force creates an atmosphere of turbulence and pain
Not yet so dangerous but who can judge if competition drives insane...

Did you come in vain?

Would you feel better now, if things never changed?
Would it be better if just all stayed the same?
Would you feel better now, to leave and give in?
Or does it feel good somehow, to differ from him?
Would you feel better now?
Would you feel better now?
Tell me would you feel better now?
Would you feel better now?

He's waiting in the shadow,
Watching you alone,
How should he approach you,
He should know
Sees your bright eyes shining
Pale and rather grey
Though not understanding.
He should know
He's waiting in the shadow,
Watching you alone,
How should he approach you,
He should know
Sees your bright eyes shining
Pale and rather grey
Though not understanding,
He should know, he should know

No-one could predict the time
Though future is so well defined
Now elements are close,
From difference they arose
But what could future signify?
We should know soon, we should know soon
