Heart, you bleed away... Day's, you're dyed in crimson
World, you left me pale and misunderstood

Home, where are you now? Face, I lost you in the
Crowd, a frozen place - will my heart survive?

Then a flamet flares up faintly
Touch my heart with just one smile!

Heart, you beat aloud... Dawn, a sanguine fire
World, I should walk out, pass on what I feel

Open up, step out ... a flame unfurled ... into a brand-new, once threatening world
I walk with a smile, this smile's my arm to shoot out a fire that causes no harm
I'll contaminate and strike a spark, an ardent desire to share my heart ...

Propagate my blood, let's spread it out, embrace the whole world and light the crowd
Explode, blazing fire, outshine the dark, please warm and revive my heart!
And now shine so bright ... please spread, my flame ... and fly ...

Heart, you last ... oh yes, you'll live on
World, you start to grow a new home for me
Face ... you ... please take my smile ...

Dark, where are you now?
World, so unfamilair ...
Please ... your little heart, will it wilt, my child?

Then an angel brings you heaven! Inflame your heart with just one smile!

Living in haze, living in fume, living in rage
Living in jealousy
Living in haste, living in need, living in time
Look, all the people next to me

Living in cold, living in ice ... Living in quest of sympathy
Living in hate, living in ash ... Look, all the people crave for care indeed

It is on you, comes from you ... hand it over

Living in glut, living in greed, living in void,
Living in vacuity ... Living in grief, living in pain
Living in lack of just a little heed ... Living in fear, living in urge
Living for respect, this is all they need

It is on you, comes from you ... hand it over

Love is the fountain, the fountain of glow
Where hearts can catch fire and passion can grow
Vibrant and truthful, a radiant flame
That creates with its power both pleaser and pain ...
