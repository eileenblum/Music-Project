Some light eventually invades in silence someone's dreams
Somewhere an apathy gets hold of someone's life
Somehow a melody has bitterly forced someone's tears
Sometimes it's hard to realize this someone's me

You are ...

Some days I think of all this brightness and some days I cry
Somehow I wonder why and don't know what to do
Sometimes there's something which so easily fills someoneâs eyes
And then I know somewhere someone waits for me too

You are ...

You are simply irreplaceable
You are my long awaited miracle
You are so near but still untraceable
You are...

And in this dream - Iâll never lose it
You kiss my cheeks and then you soothe me
You take my hand and then I come down
And simply know Iâm waiting all alone
