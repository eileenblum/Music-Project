With my thoughts astray I still hear you say that our fight is over
In credulity you played tricks on me - and it led us nowhere
What on earth you think made you sure again - and in fact so clean and
sober You suggested me - I cannot believe - it's not nearly over

All letdowns wear off in time and fade eventually

Was it ignorance, which hollowed out my strength - meaningless and empty?
Trust without a doubt that's what pulled me down and now it offends me

Treacherously, it seems to me so slippery in my eyes
Finally I can see so differently through my eyes

What enticed my mind - made me numb and blind - left me weak and broken?
I will not fulfill what you expect from me - this game is not nearly over

Used me, choked me, but never broke me
Shook me, disgraced me - never break me â¦ now
You leave me now â¦ alone I realize it's different through my eyes â¦

What enticed my mind made me numb and blind
Left me weak and broken?
I will not fulfill what you expect from me
This game is not nearly over
