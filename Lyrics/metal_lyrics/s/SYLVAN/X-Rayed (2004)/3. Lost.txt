Patient silence filled the air that day
So ominous but known
And as usual all those lovers just made their farewells
But then they never came back home

Lost salvation - never again
Tearing you apart
Lost salvation - you'll never forget
This scar inside your heart

Raging seas of flames around
And now that nothing stayed the same
Would you please tell me now why on earth could future shatter?
For you who're still waiting in vain

Still to hope they will come back
