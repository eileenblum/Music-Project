Today - I took it from you
Today - gave it back too late
Today I know I need you/face it without you
Today I threw it all away...

Spoken words from those days far behind echo through my head
Endless loops like a shivering sign show me to regret

I learned from you - lived for you - needed you always
I took from you - weakened you ... You

Feel a wave of your warmth that you gave and I lost it all
Now this emptiness is all that will stay - on a faceless wall
