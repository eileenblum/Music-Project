Try in vain to convince me, but I never felt as lonely as I do
Now I finally see that all the things I loved are so empty without you

When I dream you caress me, why it touches me like it never did before?
Though I pictured it painful - now there's no return and it hurts me so much more ...

More ... and it hurts me so much more ...

When the darkness surrounds me in an endless stream of memories all
alone Even harder to wake up and to find that all I lived for now has gone

Used to bring you just sorrows now I get them back and I can not fight
at all In those moments of weakness have to think of you and it hurts me so much

... it hurts me so much ...

Still miss you, still feel you, still leave you and then have to part
from you again ... Still see you, still weep for you still hear your whisper in my ear again ...

I could not even tell you how I need you so I'll keep it in my heart ...
