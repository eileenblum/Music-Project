In the quietness of his silent walls
Frail und sunken drops her pages down
While the sorrow like a moral guilt falls due
He released her, but he'll mourn for sure

In the deepness of his apathetic dream
How to notice - also his world turned
As the places that once told her life do wane
Darkened spaces - and only dust remains ...

Lost and forgotten at the dawn of the night
Naked of people and naked of light
We failed to notice to show her we tried
To keep her from falling, to safe this sole child ...
