Cold spreads out a chill of fear when the wind blows
Used to freeze and bind me here... and now it grows
Feel they will exploit my crude naivity
Things I will reveal to you - my diary

Put into words what I'm feeling
put into words my whole life...

In chains -
When will I freak out in chains?

Thoughts that are about to rise will be unbound
Doubts - I try to verbalize and write them down
Push the narrowness aside incessantly
It's just in you that I confide - my diary

Put into words what I'm feeling
put into words my whole life...

In chains -
When will I freak out in chains?

Searching, I'm searching the world in my head
Hoping, still hoping to find it somewhere
Traveled through landscapes in quest of this place
Where peacefully sugary roses await...

Mellowly in arms wide open - they comfort me in peace
Countless people notice me and listen honestly
Colorful but open-minded they tolerate me all
Wouldn't it be great if I can find this lost imaginary world...

There are times, when - through the haze - I find it hard to see
There are times, when I regret there's no-one here for me
There are times, when I'm alone, I'm crying desperatly
There are times, when I miss Daddy's hand that's guiding me ...

When do I quit the labyrinth of my life?
When do I quit the labyrinth inside?
When do I quit the labyrinth ... sometimes?
When will I quit the labyrinth of my life?

Find me - and I will take you on this trip with me
Guide me - you'd use my eyes to judge what I can see
Raise me - I'll show you all the things that worry me
Please help me - this is my SOS... my diary

In chains - when will I freak out in chains?
