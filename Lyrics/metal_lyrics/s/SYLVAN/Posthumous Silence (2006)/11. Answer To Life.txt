When they talk to me - I just shut my ears
When they shout at me - pretend not to hear
And they laugh at me - let they have their say
They're approaching me - and I turn away

At the border of sense - left a wasteland behind
I have built it alone - that's my answer to life
At the limit of strain - found the nature in me
I have put down my bags and I'll stay endlessly

Now my former friend - though you seem confused
Ceased to understand our old speech we used
Once you let me down, should have thought before
Now you fade away - don't exist no more

... this is the answer to life ...
