I'm staring into space, falling quietly, captured by her pages
In the corner of my eyes I note instinctively how my chamber changes

And the white leafs - moving slightly - they're caressing my hands
Look around me and it seems like all the colors have changed

Now that I'm broken at the end of the road
Naked of power and naked of hope
I'd give all my fortune to stop you tonight
To keep you from falling, to save you, my child ...
