Lying in my bed of tears, haunted by the eye of sorrow
Overloaded sceneries - living side by side
Voices from this mouth of screams tempted me with thousand faces
Lying in my room of fears hope to fall asleep

Once in times so long ago when I heard the breeze of laughter
Innocence so warm and neat like sunbeams through the pane of glass and
Now that all those years gone by - fading light replaced by sorrow
Wonder if this light was just a dream

Staring through the open hole, paralyzed and full of anger
All the people that I see since the world has changed
Visions of distorted lust - travesty of human nature
While this window silently suffocates my screams

Once in times so long ago when I heard the breeze of laughter
Innocence so warm and neat like sunbeams through the pane of glass and
Now that all those years gone by - fading light replaced by sorrow
Wonder if this light was just a dream

Pieces cut out elementary - Paranoia fades out gently
fade out, you lie - fade out and die

Staring at the flattened walls - thought I saw a trace of something
Lying in my room of dark, windowless but safe

[Guitar solo]

Woah ... Once in times so long ago when I heard the breeze of laughter
Innocence so warm and neat like sunbeams through the pane of glass and
Now that all those years gone by - fading light replaced by darkness
Wonder if this light was just a dream
