In the quietness of my silent walls
Where the shadows play the dance of you
All around me - where each part once told your life
Where the window still reflects your smile

Still I feel you, still I'm trapped within our time
Wondering vainly - why you left my child
When my fingers start to open your bequest
Clutching tightly the lifeless book you left
...for me
