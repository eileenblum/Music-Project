Each day I leave my realm, step out of my door - I breathe in carefully
Then from the black fa ades I watch the rain fall - and courage falls in me
I try to see the sky but I just see walls - they trap me silently

Some people shout at me and it's a known call: the city jeers at me

And I can not, I can not stand it all ...

It bruises all my life and all I lived for - unfurls so ruthlessly
Exists to vandalize, I hate it much more - it kills the child in me
And naturally surrounds me day in, day out, phagocytizes all
They call it just progress I call it breakdown - am I the only one?

And I can not, I can not stand it all ...

Scaffolds rising through the sky ... so threatening ...
They sprout and spill their concrete lies

If this is what you want to live through - just myopic curiosity
If this is what satisfies you - then I lost the faith I had in me

... Oh, you got to feel ...

False vows paired with false intentions - but they drown in all the other lies
But if there's something I believe in, then there has to be another side

It leads my away, it drags me away, it pulls my away, it drives me away

Each day I leave my realm, step out of my door - I breathe in carefully
Then from the black fa ades I watch the rain fall - and courage falls in me
I try to see the sun but I just see clouds - and people pass my way

So with a known disgust I quickly turn round - it's just a normal day
