Why does it change like an endless cycle
Where passion turns to request for an unconscious aggression
Hesitate to follow an inner compulsion
Fertilise weed to feed furious violence
Once silence eased my pain, now it tears me apart
And a melody comes back, I used to know by heart
How to judge a man whose sincere intentions are supposed to die?

Poisonous force deep in me drowning me unconsciously

Anxiety rouses apathy, paralysed by a well known crime
And emotions once called sympathy have left their bloody sign
I take a look at my hands and feel ashamed
Disgusted glance in the mirror and I cry in vain

Poisonous force deep in me drowning me unconsciously

Tears, a dried up source confessed
Blue sea of failing hopes,
I know I can't endure deceitfulness, no more
Now I hear it, deserted cries and loneliness again
Tell me how to leave this way, I can't

Behind the mist lies a memory
A flickering fire still remains
It could not avert their agony and all the suffering I left behind
But can it still heat up the cold?
Never again,
I approached too far, I know
Who can forgive me?
There's a voice appealing once more
Melodies that I've heard before can't resist those bewitching whores...

A thousand sounds in my head, they're promising so much
Deriding values and dreams and hope and trust
And I feel in me the power to destroy, just to destroy unrestrained emotions and joy
Miserable memories, miserable memories, miserable memories,
Miserable memories, miserable memories, dawn

Poisonous force deep in me drowning me unconsciously
Poisonous force deep in me drowning me unconsciously
