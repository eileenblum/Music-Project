There are birds above me,
Free of all, they're circling so high
I know I can't reach them,
But I wish that I could fly like a feather in the wind,
Just to float without care and I rush
Towards dreams to touch the sun
It's so near
Every time I feel this yearning I start to fly
Contented for a little while

So safe in an endless forest of quiet
No care ever finds a way
Under trees so old and wise
Every leaf soothes me till I have to say goodbye

Whenever I close my eyes
Spinning flames, a circus of mind
Every time in silent hours,
Voices tell me stories and I drift away in fantasy
Live the life of romantic heroes and the magic lives in me
It's so real
Every time I have a longing I enter life
Avalanche to break the ice

So safe in an endless forest of quiet
No care ever finds a way
Under trees so old and wise
Every leaf soothes me till I have to say goodbye

I'm safe in an endless forest of quiet
No care ever finds a way
Under trees so old and wise
Every leaf soothes me till I have to say goodbye
