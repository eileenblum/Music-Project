If you want to be the king of this land
Just close your eyes and see
Lay down and sleep
Won't you lay down and sleep
If you want to run faster than light
Then close your eyes and see
Lay down and sleep
Won't you lay down and sleep

All those secrets I once knew
Like a dream they passed away in time
All those secrets I once knew
Like a dream they passed away in time

If you want to fly like a bird
Just close your eyes and see
Lay down and sleep
Won't you lay down and sleep
If you want to swim like a fish
Then close your eyes and see
Lay down and sleep
Won't you lay down and sleep

All those secrets I once knew
Like a dream they passed away in time
All those secrets I once knew, I once knew
Like a dream they passed away in time
All those secrets I once knew, I once had
Like a dream they passed away in time my child
