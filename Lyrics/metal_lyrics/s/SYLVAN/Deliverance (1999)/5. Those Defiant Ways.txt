Those defiant ways
Those defiant ways
Yes, I followed them just to be back again
Those defiant ways
Realised too late
How they tempted my will
They enchanted my youth
Like a bored know-all child so naÃ¯ve to believe
That all my fucking dreams will come true

That's what I see no way to be the man that I ever wanted to be
Rebel by heart to break the chains,
To break the chains, to break the chains that keep me here
I'd like to breathe the air of a vivid endless city just to begin
Rebel by heart to break the chains,
To break the chains, to break the chains that keep me here

Refugee in the ocean of modern age

Endless city embrace me
Motivation runs through me...
Endless city embrace me
Motivation runs endless...

Ambitious, delicious, adventurous, contentious,
Exciting, inviting, I'm writing, I'm fighting for my dreams...

Oh, what a challenge to write
I work at day and by night
Can't find a minute to think
God knows I'm on the blink
Never there's silence around
Is this my dream that I found?

Got the time to breathe independently
Pressure lies beneath my own liberty
So I can't believe:  only empty sheets
Feel how time deceives, sacred dignity!

Dignity, liberty, sanity, mendacity
Dignity, liberty, sanity, mendacity
Dignity, sanity

Time...
Against all I could not keep pace
Where is my way
A shrine deserted without trace
How should I breathe,
How should I flee from claws that try to suppress me?
There was no sign along my way
No guide, no help and so I pray
No help and so I pray

All tears, all cries
Forgotten...
All lies
To leave...
It's no defeat
Just a detour
Makes you see
Embraced city, I have to go
It's not your fault
Now I know

Those defiant ways
Those defiant ways
Yes, I followed them just to be back again
Those defiant ways
Those defiant ways
Yes, I followed them
I followed them
Yes, I followed them
