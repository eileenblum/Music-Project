Shadows of twilight, like a sign of night,
Conquers greed for light
Vanguards wings,
Fading blinks of the day
Oppressive calmness
Reaching out for sure
Nervous hours once more and torn apart,
Bleeding heart long ago

It finds me, reminds me,
A glimpse of my past is behind me,
Obsessed me, as years went by
Abuses me, confuses me,
I don't know why it teases, why it hurts me,
And tell me how to forget this night

Nights, from deep in my mind
Thoughts, that try to accuse me
Nights, a trace left behind
Thoughts, that try to accuse me

Too blind for allusion, imploring eyes
Dad, I really didn't realise!
Irrevocable hopeless
Train of thoughts that I failed to see
Wasn't there when you needed me the most
This night when you went away to find your heart that you'd lost
Too blind for allusion, imploring eyes
Dad, I really didn't realise!

When she left your life, you needed me
You began to die, I didn't see
Just for me I cried, blame on me
Feel those seeking nights endlessly

Seeking nights, seeking nights
Seeking nights, seeking nights

Now it's near, every breathe is cool
I regret what I've done to you
If I could I would undo all seeking nights
