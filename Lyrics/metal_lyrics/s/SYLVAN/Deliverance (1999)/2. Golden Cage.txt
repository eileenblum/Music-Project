Mist is surrounding her cliff, I feel pain
It is caused by her voice, how could I try to escape, I can't move,
Move at all
Waves are crashing against her stone rocks
I see now her face, my greed glows
My only wish now is to be with her
Be forever

I remember such a lonely time, felt so lost
But somehow pleased to know
This time is so long ago
My memories they fade away, can't even think,
My brain is paralysed, my resistance crumbles now

There's no return, no escape
I'm a prisoner in her golden cage
There's no escape, no return
I'm a prisoner in her golden cage

It was just my own choice
To be her willing fool
So why do tears run down my face
She's so beautiful

Now, free me from your golden cage
Please release me from my pain
To be alone again
Now, free me from your golden cage
Please release me from my pain
To be alone again
Golden cage
Golden cage
Golden cage

I'm so alone
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
In a golden, golden, golden cage
