He can't sleep at night and he works all day
Tries to close his eyes, it won't go away
On his daily road, on a dead-end street
Has not lost the faith, he still feels...
And every break of dawn
For all these years
He hopes the burden falls...

Cold suns from a distance watch him fading away
Cold suns guide his paths and try to soothe his wounds but they fail
Cold suns shine on fields of hope he works for day after day

From a distant place one can feel his past
One can judge the weight since he lost his heart
Where he finds the strength against the wind that blows?
What the future brings, no one knows...
And every break of dawn
For all these years
He hopes the burden falls off now and...

Cold suns from a distance watch him fading away
Cold suns guide his paths and try to soothe his wounds but they fail
Cold suns shine on fields of hope he works for day after day
Day after day, day after day
Day after day, day after day
Day after day, day after day
Day after day

Day after day after day after day after day after day
Day after day after day after day after day after day
Cold suns from a distance watch him fading away
Cold suns guide his paths and try to soothe his wounds but they fail
Cold suns shine on fields of hope he works for day after day
Cold suns from a distance watch him fading away
Cold suns guide his paths and try to soothe his wounds but they fail
Cold suns shine on fields of hope he works for day after day

He can't sleep at night and he works all day
Tries to close his eyes
