Is it written in her face
Like a book she opened wide
Are you bothering at all?
Don't you hear it in her voice
Long ago her pride has broken?
Don't you care for her no more?

That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...

When she's giving you her hand
Out of habit you reply
Don't you feel you cause the pain?
She would build for you the world,
In your colours she would paint it
But she cried for you in vain...

That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...

When you used her,
Did you feel,
Did you need her?
When you squeezed her,
Did you see,
Did you please her?

When the day will fade to nothing
And the night will come in sight
When the lust has stopped to warm you,
You will freeze without her light
When the storm has ceased to touch you
And it leaves you on your own
When it's silence all around you,
You will face your life alone...
Alone...
Alone...
Alone...

Did you see it in her eyes?
Did you see her pride had broken?
Did you think of her at all?

That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...
That's your former life...
