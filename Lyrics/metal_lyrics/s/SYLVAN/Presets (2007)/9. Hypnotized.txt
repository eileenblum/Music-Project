Unavoidably sure,
Energized and full of life
Illuminate and persuade the souvenirs I have inside
It's immaturely pure,
It proselytized me to you
Mesmerized I close my eyes and dream of things I'd like to do
Believe me,
I can foresee it,
It is so easy
And now I feel it...

I'm hypnotized,
Never questioning my faith and I am hypnotized
I'm definitely right
I am hypnotized,
Never questioning my faith and I am hypnotized
Or arrogantly blind

Vigorously I'm strong
Perfect goals are never wrong
Faultlessly it's clear to me, the end does justify the means
It's philosophically true,
It explains all things I do
Elucidates the sense it makes, I never was this sure before
Believe me,
I can foresee it,
It is so easy
And now I feel it...

I'm hypnotized,
Never questioning my faith and I am hypnotized
I'm definitely right
I am hypnotized,
Never questioning my faith and I am hypnotized
Or arrogantly blind

Blind I trace my way,
Sign the words I say...
What a comfort!
What a comfort!
Try to verbalize
What I have inside...
What a comfort!
What a comfort!

Hypnotized,
Never questioning my faith and I am hypnotized
I'm definitely right
I am hypnotized,
Never questioning my faith and I am hypnotized
Or arrogantly blind
Hypnotized
Hypnotized
