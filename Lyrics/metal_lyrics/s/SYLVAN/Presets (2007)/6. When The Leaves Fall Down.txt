All we know for decades is spoken
Thousand promises have been broken
Rub out leaves of trials, empty lines
Feel that our force is mistaken
See how my future is shaken
Wipe it off our eyes, clear our minds

See now what we left behind passively
It was not enough we tried!
Why did we wait though we knew inside?
Did we fail? Did we fail?

Now, we always took it for granted
Start when it already has ended
Pour our lots of wine, crush the ice
Fields, our lands are gutted by fire
Miles of dirt and hatred grow higher
Drink our glass of wine, taste our lies

See now what we left behind passively
It was not enough we tried!
Why did we wait though we knew inside?
Did we fail? Did we fail?

Not eternal, not for sale,
Not a gift to throw away
And when the leaves fall down
Not our places, not our life,
Not our room to vandalize
When the leaves fall down
Not self-evident, not due,
Not a passing rendez-vous
And when the leaves fall down
Not a game and not so weak,
Irreplaceable unique
And when the leaves fall down...
And when the leaves fall down...
And when the leaves fall down...
And when the leaves fall down...
And when the leaves fall down...
