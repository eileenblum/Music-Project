You could be the air I breathe in
The flood that will stage the stones
You'd symbolize shelter for me
The stars like to shine on
You'd give me reasons to exist
And take away my pain... you would...

Heal all that time has failed to try
Be what it takes to comfort my life
And mean everything to me,
But future's not yet here for me

You'd turn every tear to pleasure
Caressing my eyes with rain
You'd calm down the storms of my life
Faith I can rely on
You'd fill all the clouds with daylight and
While chasing the night away... you would...

Heal all to me,
But future's not yet here for me

Would you teach me,
Would you guide me,
Would you show me,
Would you try?

Heal all that time has failed to try
Be what it takes to comfort my life
And mean everything to me,
But future's not yet here for me
