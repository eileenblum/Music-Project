My resistance is broken
I can not even lift my head
Left myself so wide open
Now I pull back myself instead
Is it true that although I'm numb it's burning?
Is it true that outside the world keeps turning?

And then it's you
You rouse in me the fire I need and it's true,
You show me how to put me at ease and when you soothe
You reach to pull me out from the deep, what a fool
Because you should be the one I relieve
For when you rise and carry on and take me one step beyond
You find the words that I'd never search for
You try to make me strong and take me one step beyond
You win the thoughts that I can not fight for

My resistance gets weaker
How to breathe when the air is gone?
Can one lose what one lived for?
How to end?
How to carry on?

And then it's you
You rouse in me the fire I need and it's true,
You show me how to put me at ease and when you soothe
You reach to pull me out from the deep, what a fool
Because you should be the one I relieve
For when you rise and carry on and take me one step beyond
You find the words that I'd never search for
You try to make me strong and take me one step beyond
You win the thoughts that I can not fight for

Soaking up the moonlight remorsefully
Picking up the dirt devotedly
How to keep on,
To keep on?
Exchanging a dime for misery
Relinquishing hopes reluctantly
How to keep on,
To keep on?

My resistance is broken
I can not even lift my head
Left myself too wide open
Now I pull back myself instead

And then it's you
You rouse in me the fire I need and it's true,
You show me how to put me at ease and when you soothe
You reach to pull me out from the deep, what a fool
Because you should be the one I relieve
For when you rise and carry on and take me one step beyond
You find the words that I'd never search for
You try to make me strong and take me one step beyond
You win the thoughts that I can not fight for
For when you rise and carry on and take me one step beyond
You find the words that I'd never search for
You try to make me strong and take me one step beyond
You win the thoughts that I can not fight for
For when you rise and carry on and take me one step beyond
You find the words that I'd never search for
You try to make me strong and...
