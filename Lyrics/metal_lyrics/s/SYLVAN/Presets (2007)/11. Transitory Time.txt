When the sleep at night missed our rendez-vous
Like an orphaned child I am watching you
When I lie awake and I bide my time
Through the cold you warm,
Through the dark you shine
Then I close my eyes and lose you
Think of days without you near
From this nightmare, cold and unsure
I verify that you're still here

Cover me
With calm tonight
To freeze these transitory times

When I wake at night from a restless sleep
And the mists of dreams loosen hold for me
For a second then fear to be alone
When I hear you breathe all my fears are gone
Then I close my eyes and lose you
Think how lonely it would be?
Can a dream just last forever?
You're such a precious gift to me...

Cover me
With calm tonight
To freeze these transitory times

Cover me
With calm tonight
To freeze these transitory times
