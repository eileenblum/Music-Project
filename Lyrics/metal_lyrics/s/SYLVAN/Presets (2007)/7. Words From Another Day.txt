Hear your words from another day
Hear your voice as from outside
Hear the sounds in a different way
And your words make my heart cry
You told me you will be there
Told me you'll always care
Told me I'll never be alone
But you were wrong,
I can't go on...

Feel your warmth from another day
Feel the cold that is outside
Feel the world in a different way
This emptiness makes my heart cry
You told me you'll never leave
Told me the words I'd need
Told me the world will be our home
But you are gone,
I can't go on...
