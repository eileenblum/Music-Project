I gave you truth,
You gave me nothing
I broke and you took advantage of it
I wrote the lines,
You never read them with me
Just spoke inside insidiously
I knew my fortune but believed my lies
A million reasons just to prove me right
I built it with you but without a doubt
You were never with me, now I found it out...

I signed my life away
And spilled the ink of trust I should have saved
I offered all my tears I used to hide
To blur the lines of truth I kept inside

If you'd asked for rainbows, would have brought them here
For in brightest colours would have shone for me
And a thousand treasures, would have searched for all
But the colours darkened, they will shine no more...

And I write it down inside...
And I fight
And I turn the page of sighs...
And I feel it here tonight...
Tonight...
And I cried
And I signed off my life...

I signed my life away
And spilled the ink of trust I should have saved
I offered all my tears I used to hide
To blur the lines of truth I kept inside
