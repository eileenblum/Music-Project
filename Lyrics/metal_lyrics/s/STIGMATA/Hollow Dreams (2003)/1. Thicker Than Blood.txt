I lay in a wasteland of confusion,
the world has cast me away,
Am I forced to reap your sorrow?
This burden I embrace.
I lay asleep in your rotting soul,
I walk only in your shadows,
I must break away from this void,
I must tear away from this shell

I burn, I wait,
Fate left me with your dust to taste
Sacrifice the coldness of my heart
All whatâs left is thicker than blood

I bathe in the fountains of retribution,
I fought for your empireâ¦
My castle in ashes,
Bullet through my skull,
Is there nothing left to say?
My reflection fades with the tears of the dying sun,
Broken on your fields of fire,
Nestled in societyâs little grave.
