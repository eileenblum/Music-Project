Bodies float in a sea of cold oblivion,
The blood red sky washes my scars away
I bite the seeds of chaos
Lost in a haze of hate, will this ever end?
Will this never end?

You tilled the soil only with bloodshed
Hope was just another blackening sunrise
The rain washes a withered dream
I am swallowed in pain, this does not end

Inside a grave of thorns
I fought to open my eyes
Inside a grave of thorns
I fought to open my eyes

The dying winter sleeps,
So silently she sleeps

Inside a grave of thorns
I fought to open my eyes
Inside a grave of thorns
I fought to open my eyes

The dying winter sleeps,
So silently she sleeps,
The dying winter sleeps,
Forever does she sleep
