The headless angel stole my passion,
When he took my breath away,
Drifting savior, you arouse my anger,
Why do you just stand and watch me fade?

You watched us drown,
Beneath the oceans,
You watched us being
Swallowed by the waves,
You watched us burn in fields of flames,
You watched us wallow in our shame

Like a desert like a storm,
It rises up my hate
The silence stars burn above,
Is it my sign of fate?

Sign of fate, sign of fate
