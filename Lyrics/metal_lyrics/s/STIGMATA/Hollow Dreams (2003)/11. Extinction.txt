The jaws of pure destruction are closing in on you
The tides of vast infection have entered into you
The darkness is embroidered in the fabric skies
The blood of wounded angels â rains throughout the night

Vengeance spreading swiftly,
The end is resurrecting
Vengeance spreading swiftly,
The end is resurrecting

The claws of Armageddon have enclosed unto thee
Youâre a perfect sinner in beneath the ruins
The ashes of creation lie beneath our feet
The final revelation of extinction fills the streets

Vengeance spreading swiftly,
The end is resurrecting
Vengeance spreading swiftly,
The end is resurrecting

All I see is a debrisâ¦. Extinction
All I feel is a debrisâ¦. extinction
All I see is a debrisâ¦. extinction
All thatâs left is a debrisâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦
