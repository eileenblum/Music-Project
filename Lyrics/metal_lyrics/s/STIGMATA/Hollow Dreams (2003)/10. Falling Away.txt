Find my salvation again,
To trace back these feelings Iâve lost
If I wear the crown that bears shame,
Sweet obscurity I trust

I am falling away to the place that Iâd search for my soul;
I am falling away from the darkness that binds these tears I mourn

Had the pain met my sadness again
Would I drown in this abyss of tears
Behind these locked doors must I wait
Forever in a prison of hate

Find my salvation again,
To trace back these feelings Iâve lost
If I wear the crown that bears shame,
I am twisting, I am burning,
I am fading, I am dying againâ¦
