I rest in a passionate embrace,
Forever in a web of perfect agony,
Under blood red skies the blackened moon offers me compassion,
While I slowly fade with my very own blood, my very own tears

Hath thorns composed a crown so rich?
Whilst Iâm pierced from both my hands and feet,
I weep as I surrender my soulâ¦my heart, my life, my all

I implored the archs of purpose,
I drowned in the blacked oceans,
Untwist confusion to unite me from sin,
So I could live with a newly redeemed hope inside of meâ¦

I am stigmatized,
Through the black of days and the dark of nights,
I am stigmatized with the heart of sin right under my skin
When would I be free from this world?
When would I be free from pain?

Under blood red skies, I reached out my hand,
To touch a heart so pure, in lakes of sandâ¦
And I watched your soul as in turned to dust,
You still bleed inside, as you are stigmatized
