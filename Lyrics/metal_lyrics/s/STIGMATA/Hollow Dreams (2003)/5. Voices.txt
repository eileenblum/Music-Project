The candleâs flame dies with a cold whisper,
Pandoraâs box itâs by her sideâ¦
Innocence portrayed, yet motionless she lies,
The voices keep calling her name,
No she would never feel the same

She says daddy, stop the voices theyâre calling me, calling me,
She said daddy, stop the voices in my soul
She says daddy stop the voices theyâre calling me, calling me,
Had I known, known

Let her go, set her free,
From the voices deep within
Let her go, set her free,
I know
Let her go, set her free,
From the demons in your soul,
Let her go, from the cracks of your apathy

Her world just changed,
Right before her eyes,
She paints her dreams in shades of black
All her nightmares are frozen in her mind,
The voices keep calling her name,
No she would never feel the same
