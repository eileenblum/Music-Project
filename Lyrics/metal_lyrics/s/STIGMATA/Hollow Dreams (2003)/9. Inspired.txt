Lost in a darkness,
Broken beyond hope,
Deny me all you want,
Though now I wander like a ghost

You inspire me to cut you into pieces,
You inspire me to do the things Iâve never done before
If I could see my self everytime I take a look at you,
I would crush this thing you call a heart,
Your only heart of stone
You run through my skin,
You burn my blood you scorched my veins
Subordinate to all your shameful ways
Even though I am blinded soon I will find it

I will find a way to your heart,
I would walk through the shadows of your soul
