Memories are dark winters,
Bent by a bleeding sun
Unmoved by eternal pain,
How I struggle to the surface
A slave to pandemonium,
I dream like a child,
Lost in a sacrifice of pain,
In utter isolation

The existing light keeps slipping away,
Always takes me to a darker place,
Within this dying womb must I caress,
All these hollow dreams?

Awake; from this drowning pool of nothingness
Awake; from this nighttide
Awake; from these hollow dreams
Awake; from this void

Memories are dark winters,
Bent by a bleeding sun
