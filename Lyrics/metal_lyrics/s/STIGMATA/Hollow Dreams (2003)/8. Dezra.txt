Where there is shelter, lies no pain
Blood stained tears are all that you possess
Dark dreams are pinned inside,
Feel your soul is crucified,
Subversive to this torture,
I travel to the wasteland in your mind

They took away everything
They took away the lonely ghost in you
They raped your innocence
Burnt your faith left you in a wilderness of endless pain

They demean you, they control your dissension
They block you like a shadow on your path
They tore your wings apart, the thorns are wrapped around your heart
They left you tattered, broken down and paralysed

They took away everything
They took away the lonely ghost in you
They raped your innocence
Burnt your faith left you in a wilderness of endless pain

Trapped in a labyrinth of memories,
I see the misery in your eyes,
You endure the shifting winds of sorrow,
You incinerated under dying starlightâ¦ No one heard your screams
