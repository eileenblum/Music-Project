So much for little
Ask not and still receive
Everything around me is rotting is decaying
What's inside is being eaten
Fathom my repose

Watching the parasites
Every prophecy coming true
Seeing another femine coming my way
seeing the pieces of a broken world, like shards of glass, like mounds of clay.

We've kissed and embraced our ruin
Tending to wounds that are forever closed
We are torn and still deceived
What's beautiful is ugly, what is ugly now is beautiful

Is that my sanity before my eyes..
I hold my life in guilty hands
Is that my future before my eyes...
All what is come now is dying

We've kissed and embraced our ruin
Tending to wounds that are forever closed
We are torn and still deceived
What's beautiful is ugly, what is ugly now is beautiful

Let the earth share its atrocities
Lucrative means to justify, apocalypse
Everything that's around me is frail, everything in fatigue
Whipping the skin off our souls
Always in control

We've kissed and embraced our ruin
Tending to wounds that are forever closed
We are torn and still deceived
What's beautiful is ugly, what is ugly now is beautiful
