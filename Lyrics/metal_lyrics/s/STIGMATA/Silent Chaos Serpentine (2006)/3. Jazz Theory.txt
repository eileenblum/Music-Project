They try to drown us in their flood,
In pools of blissful ignorance, poisoning our 
hearts

Lies are all you feed
Practice what you preach
We will not conformâ¦

Fools canât you see that there is nothing you can do 
that will change usâ¦

Or who we areâ¦

And the roots of our souls, they run too deep
Foreverâs dying, Foreverâs scarred
Although they claw out eyes, we still tread our path
Foreverâs dying, Foreverâs scarred

They try to crush us with their schemes,
Their mordant points of view, their political strain, 
their sheer disdain

Lies are all you breathe
Practice what you preach
We will never conformâ¦

Fools canât you see that there is nothing you can 
say that would change usâ¦

Or what we areâ¦

And the roots of our souls, they run too deep
Foreverâs dying, Foreverâs scarred
Although they claw out eyes, we still tread our path
Foreverâs died, Foreverâs scarred
