Foul mouthed, poisoned tongues
Travestiesâ¦youâll meet your godâ¦personify your 
maker

Shed your skin and shed your light
Silent chaos serpentineâ¦personify your maker

And the acerbic sigh shall fall

The boundary is torn reveal all I am
The palaces burn down, hear the bleeders sing their 
song

The boundary is torn, reveal all I am
The palaces burn downâ¦this plague is all I amâ¦

Smell my rags and taste my sores
You crippled, self righteous whores

Holy wars for holy swine,
Watch the blood run red like wineâ¦assimilate your 
maker
Writhe in faith and cast the stone
Lash their hides; your enmity knowsâ¦ praise be in 
the eyes of your maker

For the final life will fallâ¦

The boundary is torn reveal all I am
The palaces burn down, hear the bleeders sing their 
song
The boundary is torn, reveal all I am
The palaces burn downâ¦this plague is all I amâ¦

You are not my makerâ¦
You are not my makerâ¦
