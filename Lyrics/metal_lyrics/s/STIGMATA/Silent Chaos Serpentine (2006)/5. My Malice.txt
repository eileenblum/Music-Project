Peel the Flesh off my Bone
Slowly condone
So I may crumble away alone
Must I be denied?
Still Crucified
So forsake me nowâ¦ohâ¦

Why canât I renounce you and refuse you?
When you still bite the hand that feeds you?
I abhor you, how I loathe youâ¦
You rip open my wounds with a smileâ¦

I canât live to see this world alone
Must I breathe with the nails driven into my throat?
Every time I think about it, every while I gaze upon 
it
You induce me to slip into this concave holeâ¦

Peel the Flesh off my Bone
Slowly condone
So I may crumble away alone
Must I be denied?
Still Crucified
So forsake me nowâ¦ohâ¦

Why canât I deny you and despise you?
When you still bite the hand that feeds you?
How I trust you, and still soothe youâ¦
While you rip open my soul with a smileâ¦
