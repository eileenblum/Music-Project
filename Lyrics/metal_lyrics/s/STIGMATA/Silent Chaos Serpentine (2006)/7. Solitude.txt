Into the heart if a dying silence
Lost in a world, both dark and unkind
Now I seek the keeper of agony
Will I find the answers within?

Surely not nowâ¦behold my doubts have surfaced
My weakness is emphasized

By the shores of Misery
Tides of black wash the scarlet sun of its rage
By the shores of Solitude
Must I swim beneath my drowning?

Into the soul of a shattered illusion
I embrace the pain of memories
Isolation burns the pages of my life
Heal me once, and scar me twice

Surely not nowâ¦behold the truth has surfaced
My loneliness is glorified

By the shores of Misery
Tides of black wash the scarlet sun of its rage
By the shores of Solitude
Must I swim beneath my drowning?

And when I wanted you â you werenât there

And when I needed you â you werenât there

Majesty, comfort me
Spread your isolation deep within
Majesty, travesty
Spread your infiltration deep beneathâ¦my 
drowning

By the shores of Misery
Tides of black wash the scarlet sun of its rage
By the shores of Solitude
Must I swim beneath my drowning?
