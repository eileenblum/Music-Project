And when I thought you said goodbye
The wilted words trailed my fears
And when you kissed my heart goodnight
I couldnât hide my tears

Now the world has gone wrong
All this hatred grows strong
While I still lament these scars
Feelings shattered to shardsâ¦

I cannot survive here
Rotting now, within this cage
I will not relive this hurt
Memories writhe in dust and hate  

Why canât I fly away?
You only tore my wings for gain
Why canât I fly away?
You only clipped my wings for gain

Now, you stab me while I dream

Now, you burn my sanctuary 

Why canât I fly away?
You only tore my wings for gain
Why canât I fly away?
You only clipped my wings for gain
