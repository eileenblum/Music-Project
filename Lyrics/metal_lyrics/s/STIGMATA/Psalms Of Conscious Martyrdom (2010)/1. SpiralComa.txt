Sweetâ¦
Slithering Slumberâ¦
Silence was never golden â¦

The numbers and names
Shattered within this sphere
Memories and jaded dreams 
Like a spine that embraced a biting spear

So sleep like a child
Ride the lunar tide
Dream like a child
Awaken from your coma

The faces and their frowns 
Phantom sleep etched on your skin
Circus dance of spiral nightmares 
Like a blade that lacerates your fears

I cannot find you 
Your pain cannot heal you
I walk through the abyss of unnatural sleep
While angels waltz under peeling, wounded skies.
Tortured timeâ¦
Serenades butâ¦
You can never hide those facesâ¦
Hide those facesâ¦

So sleep like a child
Ride the lunar tide
Dream like a child
Awaken from your coma

Punish me - I am dreaming 
Punish me â I am feeding
And I wait for you
I will seek you
I will hunt you
I will break you
I will feast on you
There is nothing you can do

Sleep/ dream in pretty colors serene 
Sleep/ drown in a dearth black sky of flies
Sleep/ opalescent spirits pass me by
Sleep/ for lost innocence personified
