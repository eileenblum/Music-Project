This kingdom falls...

And life fell when time seduced my soul
the flocks of eyeless children cling to save their orphaned hope

I've watched the conscience kill the soul
The Summoning Cry of Aries
I've seen every vision blackened and torn
The Summoning Cry of Aries

I am grieved by my weakness
I am grieved by my promises to feed my rage
I am grieved by my failures
I am grieved by my promises to feed my pain

I've watched the conscience kill the soul
The Summoning Cry of Aries
I've seen every vision blackened and torn
The Summoning Cry of Aries

I will not be led astray
I won't let their future be my way
I will not be led astray
I won't let their future be my way

I will not die
destiny's spies
The Summoning Cry of Aries
I, I am denied thrice
destiny's spies
The Summoning Cry of Aries

I will find you, I despise you
I will hunt you, I will find you

I am grieved by my weakness
I am grieved by my promises to feed my hate
I am grieved by my failures
I am grieved by my promises to feed my pain

I've watched the conscience kill the soul
The Summoning Cry of Aries
I've seen every vision blackened and torn
The Summoning Cry of Aries

I will not be led astray
destiny's spies
The Summoning Cry of Aries
I, I am denied thrice
destiny's spies
The Summoning Cry of Aries

The Summoning Cries
see the orphan is blind
The Summoning Cries
I, The Summoning Cries
