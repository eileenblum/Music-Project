Shut your eyes for they will burn
The sun will spit its charring rays
Whike the hoards begin their march
Shut your ears; for their drums will burst
The shouts and screams of the multitudes, prepare yourself
For the worst

Daylight will fade
Memories erased
Nothing remains
Fading to grey

More plagues to silence your suffering
March of the Gods â The March of the Saints

Shield your skin for it shall peel
See the hungry jackals come to tear you limb by limb 
Burn the day, darkened light
Feed those thirst memories that come to haunt your life

Daylight will fade
Memories erased
Nothing remains
Fading to grey

More plagues to silence your suffering
March of the Gods â The March of the Saints

I will not be led astray again
I will not be led astray again

Come cast your shadow before me 
Isnât it flesh so unworthy?
Time and space have now betrayed me
Lost forever in a black hole reverie
