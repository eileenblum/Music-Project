Purer than you are
Colder than you'll ever be
broken while your burden's measured
failure to fulfill your prerequisite

Purpose never drove me
inspiration never choked my muse
valiant upheaval
Can you pacify the restless beast within?

Can't live up to your expectations
can't face up to your infatuations
why lament for your degradation?

deeper than the frozen snow
hungry like a thousand wolves
sinner cast your only stone
I am purer, more than you

Taste this aberration fool
silent will belligerent still
stoked to hear your martyr praised

My catharsis, my holy cage
my catharsis, my holy cage

I am purer, more than you

Deeper than the frozen snow
hungry like a thousand waves
sinner cast your only stone
I am purer, more than you

Broken, hanging savior
silent will belligerent still
stoked to hear your martyr praised

My catharsis, my holy cage
my catharsis, my holy cage

I am purer, how I shed you
Libera Nos A Malo
I am purer, how I breathe you
Libera Nos A Malo
