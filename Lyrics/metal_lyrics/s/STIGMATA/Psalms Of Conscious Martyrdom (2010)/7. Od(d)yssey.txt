Come, peer into the now
The futureâs here â the futureâs forever and never
Carry, your demons on your back
Apocalypse at hand my friend
Your passage of no return

The ritualistic voyage
Sacrosanct pilgrimage 
Enraptured by disaster
Humanityâs ultimate decay

Dreamweaver shatters the flood gates
Welcome dear nightmare 
Misery my vanity
Drowned in memories
Welcome to this, my humble abode

Step out of your shadow
Take this life back into your hands
Brothers of passions and sisters of solace
Echoes of eternity and their violent recourse

Dreamweaver shatters the flood gates
Welcome dear nightmare 
Misery my vanity
Drowned in memories
Welcome to this, my humble abode

Come, peer into the now
The presentâs here â the past is forgotten and buried
Carry, this cross upon your back
Judgment is at hand my friend
Your heaven is also your hell

Seasons of damnation
Thirst for obliteration
Enraptured by dementia
Humanityâs ultimate decay

Step out of your shadow
Take this life back into your hands
Brothers of passions and sisters of solace
Echoes of eternity and their violent recourse
