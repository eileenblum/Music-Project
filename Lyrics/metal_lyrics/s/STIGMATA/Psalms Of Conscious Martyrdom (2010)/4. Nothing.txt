Chase the precious cycle
Twisted narration indefinite notion
From silence to sound, sound to bedlam
Nothing is certainâ¦ Nothing ever is

Flyâ¦Driftâ¦Soarâ¦

The only certainties in life are the uncertainties 

Regenerate this non â reflective paralysis
Ramifications of this astral journey

Out of the body, into the outer cosmic sphere
Out of the body, into the celestial conscious sphere

Chase the sacred miracle 
Twisted illusion, subliminal delusion
From darkness to light, from light to sound
Nothing is certainâ¦ Nothing ever is

What are we becoming nothing
Peel the layers you will find something

Break your face to see the mirror 
Hope lies splintered but encumbered and alone
While these feelings slowly ebb and flow
The only certainties in life are the uncertainties

Nothing is certain
Nothing ever is
Nothing is certain
Nothing ever is
