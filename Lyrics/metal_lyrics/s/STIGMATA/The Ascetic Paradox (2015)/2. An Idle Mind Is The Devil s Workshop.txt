Look into my eyes, see a blackened tomorrow
A future in ashes, sweet chaos uninvited...

The forsaken cry for salvation
While the languid sit on their thrones
When will they learn?
When their souls burn?

Look into my heart, see a shattered mirror
Tears the face off my mask
Dancing blind in a vortex

The forsaken beg for salvation
While the monsters rule on their thrones
When will you learn? When your soul burns?

Look into my soul
See a bleeding future
Taste shadows of forever
The broken and the blessed...

The forsaken die for salvation
While the chosen reign on their thrones
When will I learn? When my soul burns?
