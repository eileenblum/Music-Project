I know your sorrow
Stars collide while the raven pecks your frozen tears.
I feel your sadness
Like winter frost burning dreams of blinded seers.
Thief of life, usurper of light.
Thief of knowledge, free will has a price.

Out of the hands / heart / soul of innocence / temperance / vehemence
The messenger torn in time
Into their raging tempest.
To be nestled by thy / in thy / in my calm

Fallen seraph unbroken.
Tearing a hole in a grey scarred universe.
Swim in a sea of shattered glass.
Like a dark lament, echoes of screaming silence stirs
Thief of life, usurper of light.
Thief of knowledge, free will has a price

I will bleed. A crashing star into an abyss
I will rise. A phoenix ascending within.
Eternity; sways in pale moonlight
Destiny; the messenger torn in time
