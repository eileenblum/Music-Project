Tell me how your conscience lies?
Do you trade all your virtues for vanity?
Tear those stitches from your eyes
The sky is burning red, the world is painted opaque

You! Sheep in wolves clothing
Are you a watcher of the damned?
You! Do you thirst for glory? Do you still search for your promised land?
I canât see with these nails driven in my eyes. I canât feel with the flesh flayed off my hide.

And now we shall bring them war
And now we shall quell their flame.
And now we shall bring them war and fight them till the end.

See your world is burning
See your world is fading
See your world is bleeding
Perfect darkness falling

Angels crash from burning skies
Drive the spear deep in my side
Angels fall from blackening skies
Crown of shame, I wear it all the time

You! Sheep in wolves clothing
Are you a watcher of the damned?
You! Do you crave for glory?
Do you still search for your promised land?
I can't be loyal having denied you thrice
I can't tame the beast within my mind.

Iâll baptize you in fire
Iâll bathe you in ice
Iâll engulf you in rapture and pluck the sun and the moon from the skies
Iâll baptize you in fire
Iâll bathe you in ice
Iâll engulf you in rapture and milk the darkness of its light.
