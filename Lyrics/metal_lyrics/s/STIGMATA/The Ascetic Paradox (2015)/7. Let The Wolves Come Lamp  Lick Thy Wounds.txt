Whisper to me oh my anaesthesia.
The meek shall inherit the earth today
Oh sing to me oh my blessed amnesia
What once was asunder is whole once again

Drifting in and drifting out, of consciousness of paramount.
Mediaâpower slave, welcome fameâhate the change.
Broke thy cage. Flew away
Trust Morpheus to tame your dreams
The more you burnâthe more you learn
Where echoes stirâthe nameless yearn
Hollow dreams cloud your mind
Fill the darkness with your light
Star of wonder star so bright
The blind lead their own to paradise
They shattered his iron resolve
They built him up just to tear him down
They crowned him king
When he was a young they stained his name till he was done
They stained his name till he was done

Let the wolves come lick and thy wounds

The howling wolves roar outside.
Raising black dust and grime
Riding on shapeless mist.
Snapping at Achilles' heels.
How they feast their sallow eyes.
Licking, snarling, bloody lips.
Will the world's chosen prey, possibly be still salvaged?
A serpentine, twisted life, fill the darkness with your light.
Star of wonder, star so bright.
Every conscious martyr is crucified.
They devoured her self esteem.
They fed her pride just to win her smile.
They crowned her queen
Then watched her sin.
Scarring thoughts in a broken mind.
Scarring thoughts in a broken mind.

Let the wolves come lick and thy wounds.
