Shadow play fantasy. Society on the brink of ruin.
The ornate puppets snap their delicate strings.
Bleed the soul of the mindless machine.
Shadow play reality. A monument built with blood and flesh.
The cognizant masses need their opiate milk and myrrh their daily bread.

Freedom fighterâfreedomâs captor
Heed the piper, lethal viper
Civilization Zeroâpoison for the chosen

Ash to ash, dust to dust, what is flesh if it loses its soul?
Watch you split the sheltering womb, wandering ghosts have no home
Are we (still) born again?

Where was I when then earth froze in blood and fire?
Where were you when the flames lashed out and reached even higher?
How I miss the oblivionâs kiss.
How I wish the bullet would not miss. How I watch it all burn down.
Building blocksâcrumbling down

How I scrub at scarlet stains
How I crave for the whipâs caress
How I confess all my immaculate sins.
Memories chained in the catacombs of flesh.

Freedom fighterâfreedomâs captor
Heed the piper, lethal viper

We die a little to live.
Are we (still) born again?
We live a little to die again.
Are we (still) born again?
