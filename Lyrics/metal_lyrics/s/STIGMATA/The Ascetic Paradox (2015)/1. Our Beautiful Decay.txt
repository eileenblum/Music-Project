Bleed for you, I will deny the truth, I will die for you, I will kill for you
I will fight for you. I will crawl for you. I will fall for you. I will hang for you.
Be buried alive for you. I will fight for you. I will lie for you.
Who is the hunter, who is the prey? Get on your knees humble slave!

Tear the chrysalis, let your wings come undone.
Apocryphal ritual, taste the fire on your tongue,
Just like Icarus fly high to the sun.
Behold your precious Eden bleeds black! Your tongue.
Welcome! My dear sweetest friend. To our beautiful decay.

Who is the hunter, who is the prey? Get on your knees humble slave!
Hey, are those ashes in your eyes?
Tell me what do you think we'll find?
Are you dancing with your shadows?
Hey, is that madness in your mind?
You milk the moon/stars and choke on its/ their light
Are you dancing in the shadows?

The world spins to chaos, angels shuck and demons jive
Dreams turn to nightmares, while the serpent swallows the light
Just like Prometheus
Let death be your bride.
Behold your sacred Eden burns black!
Welcome! My dear sweetest friend. To our beautiful decay.
Who is the hunter, who is the prey? Get on your knees humble slave!

I will lie for you. I will fight for you. I will crawl for you. I will fall for you. I will drown for you. I will burn for you.
I will hang for you. Be buried alive for you. I will lie for you. I will fight for you. I will crawl for you. I will fall for you. I will bleed for you. I will deny the truth, I will die for you. I will kill for you.

Lament of sorrow
For lives so hollow
Sacred alters, dystopian hymns
Burn with knowledge!
Burn with power!
