What is real?
What is true?
Taste your dreams, touch the sun,
Hear whispers of your deepest fears
Taste your dreams, touch the sun
Let the divine thief collect your hollow tears.
Ever after, now no more
Hear distant laughter, time moves too slow

Far sight birthright
The seer has turned to stone
A dove bleeding in stark white snow
Has soaked the earth to its cones
Silent night, chaos night.
The stranger you never really know
Time no more, fate no more
The oneâs who betray you the most are the ones that you know

Love is a wound you fill with glass
The archaic void that stained black class
As fragile dreams bleed into the sea
The winds carry sufferingâs cry, are we never free?

Light blinds the tortured night
Star shot eyes shine from yonder skies
Never after, forever more
Proverbial disaster
Silence is spun to gold

Never after, forever more
