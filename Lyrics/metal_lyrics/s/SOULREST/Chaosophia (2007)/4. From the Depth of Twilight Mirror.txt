I drown in the sea of Uncertainty 
As ritual wine flows through my veins 
Glimmering flames of candles 
Are dance in the cold breeze... 

Unknown hollowed voices 
Sing me strange alien rhymes 
Which echo in my subconsciouisness 
Like a hymn to the Ultimate Void... 

Magnetic spectral shadows 
Are dance before my eyes 
As dark mist like hideous serpent 
Crawls in my soul and my mind 

My heart is trembling like an autumn leaf 
As grim coldness descends like black ravenwing 
Mirrored Cryptogram is shinning 
Three symbols are burn like Draconian eyes... 

The Mirror between Reality and Dream 
Opens me the Gate to my own Black Ethyr!!! 

Through the icy starmist 
Through the dimensions and realms of Space 
Through the thousand roaring Abysses 
I fly to reach Eternity... 

No more human, no more mortal, 
Under the Sigh of 13 Globes 
I reach the board of all Entities 
And behold my fate which awaits me... 

Dark Vortex of Antimateria 
Covers me with the sinister shroud, 
Black Flame of Eternal Chaos 
Purifies my soul... 

The untrodden paths 
Unknown for the race of man 
Are eternally opened for me 
To reach Immortality... 

Where Nuclear Chaos roars, 
Where Nothingness shall be my beloved bride, 
I shall eternally dwell 
Beyond the Twilight Mirror...
