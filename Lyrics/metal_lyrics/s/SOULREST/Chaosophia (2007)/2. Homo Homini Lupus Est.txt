Pain and fear rule the world 
Where man devouring man 
Society divided to wolves and sheep 
And for mercy there's no place... 

Empty promises of love 
Empty promises of peace 
Just ruin your instinct of survival 
And turn you to the prey... 

In Eternal War mankind became 
great, 
In eternal peace mankind would die, 
Our history is the history of wars 
Skillfully written in blood... 

Don't listen to hypocritical bleating 
Of the ones telling you about love 
Their benevolence just a mask 
Which hides your worst enemy... 

Is it natural to love the enemies? 
When they'll beat you will you turn the other cheek? 
Kill or be killed is the law of nature 
So set your cruelty and aggression free 
And as the wolves amongst sheep we will hunt 
"Cause there's no middle state 
Predators need blood, 
HOMO HOMINI LUPUS EST !!!
