"What man knows Kadath? 
The Great City on four magnetic poles... 
For who shall know of that 
Which ever abides in strange time continuum 
Twix Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow..." 

"Lost amidst the Cold Waste 
An Onyx Castle stands 
Dark clouds shroud the mighty peak 
That gleams 'neath Ancient Stars... 

Cursed signs guard the Nighted Gate 
Carved by forgotten hands 
And woe to him who dare to pass 
Within those dreadful doors... 

Gods of the Earth are revel 
Where others once walked 
In Mystic Timeless Halls 
Which some have glimpst in sleeps 
Dim vault through strange 
And sightless eyes...
