Hark to the Voice of Eternal One, 
Hark to the Mournful Sigh of the Vortex, 
The mad rushing of the Ultimate Wind 
That swirls darkly amongst the Silent Stars... 

The Great Air-Elemental, 
Lord of the Outer Ones, 
Leader of N'gha-Kthun Hordes 
Ruler of the Dark Realm of Aldebaran... 

Hark to Him, who howls serpent-fanged 
Amid the bowels of Nether-Earth 
Hark to Him, whose ceaseless roaring ever fills 
The Timeless Skies of Hidden Leng... 

He tears the forests and crush the cities, 
But unknown (the) Hand that smites 
and Soul that destroys 
For Faceless and Foul walks the Accursed One 
His Form is unseen to man... 

Hark to His voice in Dark Hours 
And answer His Deadly Call 
Bow and pray at His Passing 
But speak not His Name aloud... 

...And by the Power of Yellow Sign 
Kneel before the Lord of Cosmic Destruction...
