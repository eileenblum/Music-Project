Night had came 
And nightmare starts again 
I feel They awake in me 
Another night of endurance 
That makes me sick... 

I hear Them calling my name 
They are roaming in my soul 
Their eerie voices twist my mind 
And shred it like a sharpest knife... 

...And They are calling me... 

Every night They torturing me 
Grimly mocking at my soul 
I feel I start to loose control 
I feel I'm going insane... 

My tortures grow stronger 
From night till night 
And They are calling me... 
They want to take me to Their Side... 

Will it ever ends? 
Will I ever escape from this horror? 
For now I know exactly 
Even Death can't give me rest... 

...And They still calling me... 

"Again and again I tell you 
never summon Those, 
on whom you have no power, 
'cause your soul and mind 
Shall be destroyed by Their Fearful Might..."
