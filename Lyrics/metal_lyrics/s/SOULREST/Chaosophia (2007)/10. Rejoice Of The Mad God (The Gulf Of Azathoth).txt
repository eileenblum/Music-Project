"I hear the Roar of Nuclear Chaos 
Which bubbles beyond the Angles of Dimensions..." 

Out in the Void beyond the Ordered Space 
There's only Blind Chaos without Form or Place... 

The maddened beating of vile drums, 
The monstrous howls of accursed flutes 
The waterfalls of blind idiocy 
Are mixed in formless and maddened gulf... 

Lord of Inconceivable Fears, 
Great Source of Unholiness 
Destroyer of worlds and Dimensions 
The Sultan of Those Without Names 
Creator of Nothingness 
Blind Horror of all the Voids 
In Ultimate Chaos He ravenously gnaws... 

Vile drooling Hordes 
Of Blind Idiot Gods 
Are shamble and gesture 
In the Gulf of Azathoth... 

Out in the Void beyond Time and Space 
Blind Chaos roaring in blasphemic rejoice... 

You, Whose Soul dwells in Yog-Sothoth, 
You, Whose Will is proclaimed by Nyarlathotep, 
You, Whose Image embodied in Xada-Hgla 
Once all the Worlds will behold Your Might!
