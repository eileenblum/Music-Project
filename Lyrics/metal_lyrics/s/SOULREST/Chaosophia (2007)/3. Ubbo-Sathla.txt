In the grey beginning of times, 
In steaming fens of Newmade Earth, 
Formless and loathsome mass 
Reposed amid slime and vapors... 

It sloughed from its oozy sides 
In a slow ceaseless wave 
The amoebic forms that were 
The archetypes of earthly life... 

Disgusting and loathsome 
Swarming formless source 
The Beginning and the End 
of all things... 

It was before Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth, 
It was before Hastur and Tsathoggua, 
It was before Yithians and Elders 
It was before all the Things... 

And all the forms of life as it told 
Shall go back at last 
Through the Great Circle of Time 
to Ubbo-Sathla...
