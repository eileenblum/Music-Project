(Some) Mysteries which hide 
'Neath the black waves of Uncertainty 
Bear the Sign of Cosmic Fear 
Unbearable for human mind... 

Strongholds of primordial horrors, 
The anxious visions of sickening madness 
For aeons are lying in the Sleep of Death 
Hidden in the Dark Corners of the Earth... 

Monstrous basaltic crypts 
Infested by the eerie fiends of the Deep 
Await in the darkened Voids 
Eternally hidden from human sight... 

And from enormous monoliths 
Covered with loathsome seaweeds 
The Call of the One is heard 
The One ruled before all legends of man... 

CTHULHU FHTAGN!!!!!!! 

Dark sickening visions 
From Unholy Aeons 
Monstrous and unreal 
R'lyeh Ascension... 

"That is Not Dead, which can eternally lie, 
Yet with Strange Aeons even Death may Die..." 

Thousand of loathsome throats 
Begin to chant the eerie hymn 
As Great Cthulhu rises from the Deadly Sleep 
Spreading the wings of Subterranean Darkness... 

"Ph'nglui Mglw'nafn Cthulhu R'lyeh Wgah'nagl Fhtagn" 

The era of man comes to an end 
Subterranean Horrors awoke from the Sleep 
Abhorrent and Loathsome 
Great Cthulhu shall rule where once ruled...
