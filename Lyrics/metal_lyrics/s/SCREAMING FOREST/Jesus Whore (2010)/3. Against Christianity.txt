Against amoral acts
Against putridity
Against all illusions
Our fury we send

Against christianity

Our tribe is numerous
Our flags are black
Our mind is furious
We have no turning back

Against rude invasion
Against all churches
Against your cross
Our revenge we send

Here we go!
Against all humanity
With drunk faces
And whore - smell dicks
