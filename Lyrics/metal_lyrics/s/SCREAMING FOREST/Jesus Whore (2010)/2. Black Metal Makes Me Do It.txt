Yuor church will be next
Fire is my sword
I'll cut the cross
I'll just take another life
Even stone I'll break
By my true hate
Only ash on the ground
Only fragments in the wind
Your church will be next
Fire is my axe

I'll cut the cross
I'll will destroy christians
Black metal is my minde
Black metal first of all
Black metal is my pride
Black metal - so cold

Black metal makes me do it
I set on fire this church
As evil as i can, I fight against christian world
Upturned cross on my breast - My manifesto to rotting humanity
I believe only in myself, I want to leave fucking world.
Black metal makes me do it, I poisoned purity of faith
With the ash of dead church, As evil as i can
I'll leave this fucking place, Shout in my mouth
Bullet will crack my head
I will be dead
