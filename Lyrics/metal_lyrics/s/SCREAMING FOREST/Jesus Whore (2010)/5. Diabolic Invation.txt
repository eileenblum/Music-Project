Ejaculation of satanic sperm. Defiling nations, violating the norm
Whatewer religion is, you shall die; When devil sees through your eyes -
Truth becomes lies. Truth become lies... Fear breeds anger. War against humanity
Hope is strangles. With the golden rod of vanity
There comes pride with his final kiss. Hammers is falling and it wan't miss.
Salvation's what you're longing for. But they always ask for more blood... More
Greed's like sickness. Infecting minds, infects the whole
Feeding on the weakness. Waits until you fall
Diabolic invasion. Total devastation
Lust for gold. Makes them kill, then take and flee
Your and old. In the lake of lechery
Diabolic invation
