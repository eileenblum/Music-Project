When the sun is dead
When stars open gates
Gates of unholy night
I see this creature of hate
With beautiful face and hair
But wild mind
Turn her into beast
Hole become so deep and hot
She is a object of my lust
Lust rules by me
I dream about her ugly cunt
My wicked mind will burn
Burn in ocean of bestial passion
I whisper
And unholy lust burns me from inside
Half-Girl, Half- Beast!
