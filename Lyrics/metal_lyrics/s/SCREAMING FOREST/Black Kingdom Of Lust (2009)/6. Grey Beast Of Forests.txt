So evil, So wild
So Hatefull inside
So many corpses after the battle
So mercyless your mind
Wolf... grey
Ash... grey
Servants... go!.. pray!
Forest - your grave
Wild looc, spirit of blood
To Mother Nature - Eternal glory
Mother gave a milk to you
Bloody milk for evil childe
Wolf... grey
Christ... false
Servants... go!.. prey!
Prey on your grave
Cold as ice evil look
Grey beast of forests
Forest - your only home
Hunting place, killing place
Hail Wolf!.. Hail Grey
Hail ash! Fuck the pray!
Hail, evil! Hail indestt
Hail screaming forest!
