If the only difference between man and animal is self-control,
then there is no such thing as man.
Where's the self-control?
We act like dogs, our brains are between our legs;
the desire is worse than any plague.
Where's our self-control?
The bonds of sex are being raped.
And it makes me so sick
I feel as if vomit is stuck deep down inside my throat,
I feel I could die from the puke on which I choke.
So it's only about bodies, eh?
Well you'll learn your lesson some day.
For this is more than what meets the eye,
this deals with hearts and minds,
not just what's in between our thighs.
Where's your self-control?
