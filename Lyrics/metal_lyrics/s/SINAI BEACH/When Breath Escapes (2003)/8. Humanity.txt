Man has been fooled by his own brain.
Man's been deceived.
He's gone insane.
He's given away his soul.
Exchanged the glory of the immortal for the self-indulgent lies of the 
futile.
So that fools might become wise in their foolish wisdom.
And the wise be made foolish in the fool's kingdom.
Man loves to think he knows all.
His religion of science.
I guess it's easier to understand when you make things up.
Can't shove a square into a circle anymore than a monkey into a man.
And the wise are made foolish.
Man loves to think that he knows all.
His religion of science.
I guess it's easier to understand when you make things up.
In serving a useless nonexistent cause,
to its useless nonexistent end.
Man became an infant and crawled back to the womb.
He's gone insane, fooled by his own.
