Now life has ended.
Played all the cards that have been handed.
And now eternity has a whole new meaning,
with its no end and no beginning.
A heart comes to its last ticking, its blood feels like its thickening.
And its mind can't stop thinking,
when life flashes before it, will it like what it sees.
Or will it wish to have done other things.
And the regret will only add more to the flame's pain.
As breath escapes, the heart beats slower.
Soon, the nightmare will be over, or will it just begin?
As once again eternity sinks in.
Life's last strength grips the deathbed below then digs itself in.
I guess the understanding of life after death comes with the absence of 
breath.
