I can feel your eyes on my face.
I can sense the laughter in this place.
I can see disgust in your eyes, as they stare straight back to mine.
I feel the prick of your fingers pointing at my back: "Worthless!"
I'll speak up, just not with my voice.
Time to talk back.
Crush all that I am, because all I am is not all you are.
And now all that's left of me is only what you've chosen to leave be.
So leave me in my ruins: just a mound of flesh.
So leave me in my ruins: my prison of flesh.
But I'm breaking free, and you're helping me.
My hand holds the gun, your hate pulls the trigger.
My life is over, it's about time I speak up.
Worthless.
