Do you kiss your mom with that mouth?
If she could only see you now.
If she could only hear you now.
Would she run to wash her cheek;
to wash the years of filth from her cheek?
Or would there be just too much to clean?
The perversion spewing from your mouth has gone too far,
so shut it up, she's worth much more.
And this time you've gone too far.
I'm not sure I could hold back anymore.
So if I hear your talk much more,
I might just nail your tongue to the bathroom floor;
where that feces belongs
