Can we discuss the things we use for the tricks we spring on people so 
trusting.
&gt;From up our sleeves, come tears of sadness and tears of joy.
Nothing too complicated for the hearts of liars.
Lies, careless words, for careless people.
Deceitfulness: a trait found only in hate.
And I wonder what defines a lie.
How do you define a lie?
Empty promises leave holes in hearts of many,
some with those intentions, some unintentionally.
The most untamed beast is the beast in our mouths, our tongues.
