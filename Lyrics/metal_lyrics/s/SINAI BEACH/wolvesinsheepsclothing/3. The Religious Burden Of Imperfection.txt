Why is man so easily fooled by the evil one?
Surely he cant use our own beliefs against us, can he?
Your soul is free, but your mind is chained to hell
You go on each day
And go to sleep each night
Guilt-ridden of the past and in fear of the future
From a humanistic etiquette:perfection
Your soul is free, but your mind isn't.
