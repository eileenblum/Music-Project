To the pharisees of the twenty-first century
To those who know only religious ceremonies
Crooked liars behind pedestals
Got Bibles in their hands but know nothing of what it holds
Stand on your stage, wave your fist in the air

Move your lips [3x]
Move your lips to speak of your own man made teachings
To grow to your own failure
And your death will come,
But your advise Gods gonna hate
Your own man made teachings

Age old traditions
Age old traditions
Are what holds close to your heart [6x]

Old teastament, old covenant is what you preach, is what you try
That broke when the body of Christ broke
Did you forget, or did you just skip through that part?
That most crucial part
The part that changed the course of history.
