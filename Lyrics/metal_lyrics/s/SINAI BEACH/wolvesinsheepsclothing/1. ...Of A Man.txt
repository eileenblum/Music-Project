Gone to bed, turned off the lights
Closed your eyes, does your emptiness come as a surprise?
Don't live a lie
Reach deep down and pull up your insides
Take a look at whats exposed
Look and ponder, is life too complicated for an answer?
You wonder what it would be like to be dead, as a million thoughts go running through your head
Living stagnant in this life just to endure another worlds longest night
He weighs heavy on your heart
Why is it so hard to understand God's glory surpasses the comprehension
Why is it so hard to understand God's glory surpasses the comprehension of a man?
