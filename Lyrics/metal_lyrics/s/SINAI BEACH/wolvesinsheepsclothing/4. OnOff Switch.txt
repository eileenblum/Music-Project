Like a pair of pants you treat my creator
Take him off one day and put him on another
Like a clock work you abuse the Savior
Just wait till the right hand strikes at the right time
Your faith is bipolar
Charismatic or ruined based on your pleasure
Why shoot yourself in the foot?
For the very things you run from are the very things you desire
The trails that you flee are the blessings that cold be
Your faith is bipolar
Charismatic or ruined based on your pleasure
Embrace God with your head in the clouds
Cloud nine is the one that you're on, but as soon as it rains you're gone
As soon as it rains your gone
Please stop playing teeter-totter on the cross of God
Please stop playing teter-totter on the cross of my savior
And the confusion you've caused is not welcome.
