I've been fooled.
I'm in hypnosis.
I'm a living lie.
Deceit has control.
I've blinded myself to see what I wanted as something holy,
But now I shed my skin and I strip the flesh.
Sanctification.

I'm being released from a condition
That sees my will as His decision.
From ash, dirt, and stone
He created the Human Race.
After years of searching amongst them,
I finally found my place.

In desire to rule, I find entrapment.
And in surrender, control.

I'm being released from a condition
That sees my will as His decision.
From ash, dirt, and stone
He created the Human Race.
After years of searching amongst them,
I finally found my place.

I swallow my pride, though it hurts as it slides down.
The pain will subside, but the call cannot be drowned.
Death to flesh and death to this place.
Freed from care and from disgrace.
