Best run. They come from all directions
For your identity, for your freedom,
To give the Mark of the Beast.
Rebel. They don't come in peace.
Believe, profess, and lose your head in the process,
Or bear the Mark and be theirs to possess.

I believe in the prophecies.
The future will bring tribulation.
The future will bring revelation.
I believe in the prophecies.

Revolt.
I will not bow to Antichrist.
Revolt.

I believe in the prophecies.
This is what is to come.
I pray I will not live to see what is to be.
For strength I also pray, if I do see such days.
Revolt.
