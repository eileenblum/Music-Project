Never before tonight did I think I could kill a man
And sink a knife deep into skin,
But I could kill you.
Surely I could wreck you,
Because you wrecked them.
You rapists, you abusers,
You thieves, you murderers.
I've taken my look around
And all I've seen leads me to believe
That if I was God,
Heaven would be nearly empty
And Hell would be overflowing.

So thank God that I'm not God,
And praise Him for being nothing like me.
I would have forsaken man.
So praise Him for being nothing like me,
'Cause I would have let this world burn.

If I was God, I would do unto you things unthinkable,
Far beyond cruel and unusual.

So thank God that I'm not God,
And praise Him for being nothing like me.
I would have forsaken man.
So praise Him for being nothing like me.

For those who ask,
He gives His grace kindly.
His forgiveness is beyond me.
I would have let this world burn.
And even to the most perverted man,
And even to the most wretched man,
His glory and mercy is given.
