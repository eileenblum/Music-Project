Lord, what more than little good has Your death done?
Lord, why did you give Your Son?
Surely You did it for more than this.

The world lives on in ignorance, filth, and arrogance.
Man wreaks havoc on his inheritance.
Surely You gave Your life.
Surely You gave Your blood,
And Your flesh for more than this.

Lord, what more than little good has Your death done?
Lord, why did you give Your Son?
Surely You did it for more than this.

Your covenant lies highly rejected.
Sadly, it is seldomly accepted.
Yes, to me it means everything,
But to most it means nothing.
Surely You gave Your life.
Surely You gave Your blood,
And Your flesh for more than this.
Surely You died for more than this.

The reason is I.
The reason is one.
You'd suffer and die all over again
For one single person.
And if that one should choose to reject You,
That is the very essence of You:
To give the chance to choose.
