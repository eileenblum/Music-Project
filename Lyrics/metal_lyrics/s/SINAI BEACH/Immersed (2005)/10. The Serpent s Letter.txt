I send this to Hell in the expression of the hate that is mine.
No forgiveness for your lies,
So take my two cents as I give you a piece of my mind.
And this is my letter to Hell.

Dear author of rape, vain, murder,
And greed, lust, lies, molest, and envy,
From me you get no sympathy.
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
From me you get no sympathy.

I send this to Hell in the expression of the hate that is mine.
No forgiveness for your lies,
So take my two cents as I give you a piece of my mind.
And this is my letter to Hell.

As they open up Hell's gates to eternally damn you,
I will be there to spit on you.
With all that I love, I hate you.
Dear author of rape, vain murder,
And greed, lust, lies, molest, and envy,
From me you get no sympathy.
I long to see your face of pain,
To see you flinch in the heat of the flame.
But one thing will cool you:
I'll piss on your tortured soul.

I send this to Hell in the expression of the hate that is mine.
No forgiveness for your lies.
You've infected the body,
So the body will treat you as an infection.
Dispose of the infliction.
I pray for Armageddon.
I'll piss on your tortured soul.
