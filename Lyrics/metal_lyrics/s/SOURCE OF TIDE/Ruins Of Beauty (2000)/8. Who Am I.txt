-The ether is the seduction;
"I envy your fate"
-The opportunity of reflection,
"Isn't for me to see"
-The philosophy is not for rejection,
"It appears too late"
-Trust is the last protection,
"Am I not to be?"

"Who am I to judge your dreams of eternity?"
"Who am I to judge your dreams of sanctification?"

Estimate your hegemony opposing to mine will
Give me the advantage of your limiting doom.

"Who am I to judge your belief of eternity?"
"Who am I to judge your belief of sanctification?"

As I soon will walk in the "valley of the dead",
When the spirit yearns without any hope,
Then my lack of fate envy your gods.

It is too late for me as I now am deceased.
There is no cause for regrets.
But I wish there will be a path after.
