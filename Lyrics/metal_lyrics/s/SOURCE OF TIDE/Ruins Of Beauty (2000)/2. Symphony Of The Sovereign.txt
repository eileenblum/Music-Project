Dark is the truth about mankind
Eradicated by its mind
Weak and enthralled
Was proclaimed king by the lodestar

The sovereign of gods' squalid kingdom
Ephemeral it will be
Darkness fills the earth,
And the second nemesis will end with war.

Crown of beauty is lost to
The shadows deep within.
I died with you.
All gone as one,
The last euthanasia

Your veins burst for the last time.
Left are the thoughts of
The philosophical warrior

Lineage of mankind has departed.
Quiet is nature's song.
Lithe harmony.
Beautiful entr'acte fills the dead angels.

Nature will choose her next escapade,
May she choose well.
A new servant, one who stays loyal
To the queen.
