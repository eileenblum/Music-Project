Winds from the north conceal me,
As I walk in the misty forests.
My thoughts for winter arrive
For soon to be.

Autumn leaves me empty, why?
Autumn leaf falls from upon high.

Dark shadows float around in circling mess.
My thoughts of dying summer, to soon become.

Lord of snow awakes after countless days.
Preparing his new arrival in bizarre ways.
Light of day fades quicker,
Just making the mighty darkness bigger.

Autumn leaves me crying.
Autumn leaf commenced dying.

Nor my conviction of winter or night
Frightens me into abnormal light.
