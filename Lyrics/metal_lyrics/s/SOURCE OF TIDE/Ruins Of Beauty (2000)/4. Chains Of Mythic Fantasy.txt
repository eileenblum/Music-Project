The past of creation and sub-reality
Howls from ancient myths and beliefs.
Time shows us the reality of comedy and tragedy,
Drama acts into the mighty kingdoms.

Fantasy makes no reality to you,
Nor fiction or law.
The creatures of drama
Make you feel locked into
This chains of mythic fantasy
Here was the knights and dragons created by the sub-
Division through thoughts of mankind.

Beautiful maidens and high elves
Do my history written in time.
Epic wonders of the other
Dimensions of your mind,
Your alter-ego melts into
Visions of the holly forests.

Fantasy makes no reality to you,
Nor fiction or law.
The creatures of drama
Make you feel locked into
This chains of mythic fantasy
