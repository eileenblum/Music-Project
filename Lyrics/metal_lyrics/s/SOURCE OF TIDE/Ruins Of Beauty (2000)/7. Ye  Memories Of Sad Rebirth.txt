As the time stood still, my ancient self was reflecting
The eternal centuries of me.
While the requiems of my eternal
Me were spoken, then the dusky rain drained out their
Tears.
For yet a while, my dreams were not.
And the silent streams to the one and only
Truth died.  Then she was finally laid to sleep.

As pain arose, pain was sacred.
The manifesto was now fulfilled as the truth.

When the time spoke again, her awakening was eternal.
So it was still perforating the cavity of my ether.
As the awakening of reflections concealed me
I cried to ye' memories of sad rebirth.
