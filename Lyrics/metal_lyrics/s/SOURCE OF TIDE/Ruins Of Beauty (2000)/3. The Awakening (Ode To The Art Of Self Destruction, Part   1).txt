Sources of truth are pointing
Towards sources of light.
The eternity is running ashore with
An irrevocable birth.
Darkness is the eternal perfection
But the light gives you a rope of belief.

Full-moon rising towards massive dark,
Nor the darkness itself
Shows us dark as light itself

As the shores of the northern sea
Crush the creation of men,
Just as the northern light surrounds
Your spirit of black. (it is yet to be discovered the
Creations of life itself.)

Full-moon rising towards massive dark,
Nor the darkness itself
Shows us dark as light itself
Shows the wholeness of darkness.
The true manifestation of darkness, 
Shows itself by source of tide.
