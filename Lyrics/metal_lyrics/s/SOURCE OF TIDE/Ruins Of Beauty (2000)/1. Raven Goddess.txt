Sacramental torment of my spirit
Tears me apart in my dreams
Frozen hymns of ancient years.
.Disharmony in your veins.
Dreams of reality make me scream.
Through darkness of the eternal beings,
Fills me up with majesty of wrath

Swords of magic whisper in the night.
Mighty sorceress of torment arrives.
The maiden of evil brutality,
The temptation of her flesh,
Directs me into the mighty raven madness

Death comes to me in disguise.
Ahzrael of other realms sings in love.
He whispers my ears full of sorrow,
And the lust of her flesh gives me.
.Agony.

Sails away - Into cosmic space.
Sails away - Where man is not.
Sails away - The eternal grief.
Raven goddess is surrounding me.

I do not see death, nor the mighty raven
Goddess on their journey to make me
Eternal soul, my words, nor
My writing is left behind
(As the mighty raven covers me)

Sails away - Into cosmic space.
Sails away - Where man is not.
Sails away - The eternal grief.
Raven goddess is surrounding me.
