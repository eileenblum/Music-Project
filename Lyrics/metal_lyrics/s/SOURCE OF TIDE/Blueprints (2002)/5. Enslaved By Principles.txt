Aftermath, nobody turn their pages.
Just wandering on, without renewal.
Who dares to step further into the future?
Nobody takes the step into the new world.

After zero, no murders appear.
After zero, no minds at ease.
After zero, pleasure's gone.

Future is futile.  What's beyond
Scare more than human stagnation.
We're enslaved by principles of the 
Present and past.  Stop your resistance
And walk beyond dignity.

After zero, no murders appear.
After zero, no minds at ease.
After zero, pleasure's gone.
