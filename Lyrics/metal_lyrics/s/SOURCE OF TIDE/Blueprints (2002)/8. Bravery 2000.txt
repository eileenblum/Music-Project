Dreams.a fatal error.
Just another plane to escape the sanity.
Trust.an icon that's fallen to ground.
Once again, self-esteem blocks in your
Mind.

Lies.denial of just.
Hereby a control of dreams,
And personality transformation.
This shall be the acceptance of
Our commonplace sins.

The mind: Just another dream.
The mind: Unreal trust.
The mind: Based upon lies.
Hence the intellect is our behaviour.
