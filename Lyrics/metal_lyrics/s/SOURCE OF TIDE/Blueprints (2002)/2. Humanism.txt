This knowledge of profound dignity.
These innocent thoughts.
This action of mercy.
.all in the name of conscience.

I am not a divine being.
I am not any god.
I am just another human.
I am an animal.

The world is what it appears.
The idolization of individuals.
Compassion has been terminated.
.in the name of conscience.

We are not divine beings.
We are not any gods.
We are just humans.
We are beasts.
