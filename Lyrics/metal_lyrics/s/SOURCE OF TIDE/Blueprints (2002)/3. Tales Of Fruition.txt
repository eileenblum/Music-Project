Once so proud, never to be
Other than dignity incarnated.
Wholeness of a universe not explored.
Shadows and fading beings.

Mountains increased.

Realization of time, worked in our
Minds, they came not along.
Clock was ticking,
While evolution expanded.

The choir's unity deceased.

Sometimes a blink behind
Increases a glimmering hope.
Some of us still are shining bright
But mostly never to be found.

Paranoia released.
