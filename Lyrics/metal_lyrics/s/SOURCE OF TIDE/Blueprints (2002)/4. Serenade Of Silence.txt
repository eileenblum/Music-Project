"Once this little cloud wandered our skies.
Not anybody noticed its existence.
It was not meant for the human eye to see,
There it floated so quiet.
It's path did not block the sun.  But anyway,
It was suppressing my mind.
I saw its hunger, the urge to rumble.
Once this little cloud's voyager continued
Far beyond."
