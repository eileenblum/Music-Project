Cross fading thoughts.
I am in will to change.
My reflections are just a subtle idea.
I feel I am changing into the infinity.

You are weak.  Not in control of your own
Me.
Another hour, another belief.
Descending into a new being.
The answers U have will be shattered.
All certainties will be lies in the end,
Mortal.

Expansion, evolvement
You never stay the same, human!
Your option is change, hence
You will always evolve, human!

Your stagnation is expansion,
All answers lie beyond the dawn of a new day.
You are bound to rebirth, mortal!
