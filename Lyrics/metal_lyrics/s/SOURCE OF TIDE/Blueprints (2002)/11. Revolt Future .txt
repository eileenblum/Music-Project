I am not as appearance; I am not.
Hence I am not forsaken; I don't claim
Deity.
Still crying out in pain, I cry in vain.
.and not present.

Despite my absence, future dies.
Despite my knowledge, present was.
My only resistance is the past.
No way to fight the future.

I am not as appearance; I was none.
Henceforth I was the fallen, maybe God?
I burst out in anger as instants leave 
Behind.
I will revolt the future.
