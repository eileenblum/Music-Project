Independence! The mature statement.
Do not enslave me into your principle.
I'm my own free will and I am ready to
Fight your prosperous future.

Bow down; kneel for me.
This is the declaration.

It's my goal to confront you.
My resistance grows stronger.
I will not let my sanity be drained.
I am willing to die for my denial.

Bow down; kneel for me.
This is the declaration.

I will crush your dogma.
I will cry out liberty.
I will not notify human existence
Along my way.

Losers die!.I died.
Bow down; kneel for me.
You're dead.
Hence, this is the final declaration.
