is your life as dark as mine
will you carry on
further down the line
it's all gone
do you bleed like me
do you bleed at all
how this turned out to be
one cold final call

shells of steel run right over me
the company of fools
in the end you'll walk right over me
one sad broken tool

is your screen as blank as mine
do the circuits scream
will your nightmares keep you safe
in the dome of dreams
clawing at the glass
the wires around your heart
how the hours come to pass
when you tear them apart
