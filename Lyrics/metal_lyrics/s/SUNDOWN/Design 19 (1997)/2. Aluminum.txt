reptile sleep
the fix runs deep
alone with mirrors - a blank reflection stains the glass
liquid eyes
late goodbyes
calling from a distant waste that you can't find

and now when all is said and done
nowhere left to run
bittersweet aluminum - the curtain falls
the time has come to end this game
never be the same
bittersweet aluminum - left in my mouth

diamond dreams
tainted past
it comes together - all together - it won't last
exiled waves
heartbeats lost
set the world on fire now at any cost
