your poison is like honey for my soul
that sweet sedative venom makes me whole
pale horizons coming down
nothing but a stranger in this...

lights keep shifting
floating patterns across my face
orbs still dripping
a salty cure for bitter days
slither slowly
pass the sadness across the room
slither gently
shaping god within the gloom

time keeps passing
like ashes riding on the storm
faith keeps failing
under siege of the locust swarm
lead is melting
slithers down my silver skin
hope is dying
it opens up what hides within
