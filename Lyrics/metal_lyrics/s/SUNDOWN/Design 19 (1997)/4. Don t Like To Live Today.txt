pale as ice - lost again
and no one sees me coming
now it's time to lose that grin and start anew
when i've been hiding
you were always there to find me
but this time - won't you let me be

and then death comes crawling
and you can't hear me breathe
it's alright now honey

right from the start
the chains of love tore us apart
oh my my - oh hey hey
well I don't like to live today
left me behind
in such a sorry state of mind

colder now - broken down
there's silence all around me
and that's all I wish there would ever be
now the end is coming
and you left me dry and lonely
and i'm freezing - out here on my own
