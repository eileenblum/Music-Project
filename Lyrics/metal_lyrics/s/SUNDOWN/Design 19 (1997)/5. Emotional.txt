hold on - time to deliver
that stare sends shivers down my spine
hold tight - 'cause now it's coming
that sweet taste for which i'm longing
lower - slower - come the time
in black devoured now
red sheets and a crimson sea
tried so hard to keep the razors away from me

and the blade won't bite
so let's die tonight
let's close our eyes and make everything alright
- tonight

hurts now - the fever's burning
close my eyes - the clock is turning back
ease now - slipping further
concentrate - let's take a minute to think about this
sharp edges and silk soft tissue
don't care about answers
'cause what's the issue now
right or wrong - stand or fall
- just the right time to get emotional
