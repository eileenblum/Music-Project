Intact - Insane
Let your children in on all the pain
Your thirst for war
Any odd few will even the score
Led to belive
That all is well and none shall deceive
No guilt - No shame
Clean those wounds in the sea of flames

Death is a virus
And you'll welcome the disease
Straight out of the 13th lab
Your brand new god
Stab [x3]

Not man nor child
My hallucination's running wild
Sharpen the blade
I'm the product - I am what you made
Kept in - Locked up
I'm the killer you will never stop
I'm Christ - Jor-El
I am heaven - I am fucking hell
