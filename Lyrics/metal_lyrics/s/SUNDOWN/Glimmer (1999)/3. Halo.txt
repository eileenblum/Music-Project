Your prime obsession
That glaze keeps hanging on
Dancefloor confessions
Just another hit and run
Cold winter's powder
Twist the mirrorball
The pain screams louder
For a way to end it all

This time ain't wrong
This time ain't right
Who is doing you tonight
Blinded by a flash for fantasy
[You'll see]

Your soul's discomfort
That feeling's nothing new
Your polished glamour
Let's you do the things you do
One disco biscuit
Two mascara tears
That makeup covers well
But won't keep in the fear
