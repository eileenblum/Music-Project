Tell it to the world - You're so worn out
All you wanna do is just scream and shout
Tell it to the world - It's over now
Whatever we had got lost somehow

But you don't feel that same way do you
Not this time around
If you could save us now then would you
Over and out
But you don't feel that same way do you
Not this time around
It all comes crashing down how could you
Over and out

Nothing in this world could ever change
Who you truely are and how it's all arranged
Nothing in this world could ever heal
All this fucking pain you made me feel
