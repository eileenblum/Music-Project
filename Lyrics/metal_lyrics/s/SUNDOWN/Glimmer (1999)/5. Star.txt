Come now - We got someplace to go
Candycanes and alot of tools on show
Sit straight /breath/ take in this place
Wrists tied down and a strap across your face
Cold burns - Needle to the nail
Liquid fire - Blazing vapor trails
Put out exihibition style
The lights are all over you
What's that traumatic smile

Twinkle little star
Love to see you swallow
Stay just where you are
Fake it 'til you're hollow

Held on no restriction line
It's all science-fiction in your mind
Slip tarp - Drugs and vaseline
I've seen you girl working wonders on the screen
One way - No time to abort
Lifeline cut off - There's no last resort
Endpoint - The pain becomes the fuel
Your life is so sad and the world's so crue
