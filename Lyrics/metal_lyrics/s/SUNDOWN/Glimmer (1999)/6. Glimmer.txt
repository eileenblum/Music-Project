Take a little trip now baby
Why don't you come on down
It's such a lonely town
We offer something quite unique
A one stop for the freaks
If I make you happy it can't be all that bad
It's just you that's kinda sad
No compassion from me
Won't feel - Won't touch
But I'll tell you this much

Your love's to ordinary
No time to care about this
It's over - Dead and buried
Nothing I am likely to miss

There goes another fallen rebel
Another billboard king
Feel the urban string
A blank utopic hidingplace
The legend's saving face
The psychodrama's creeping in
To end or to begin
Whatever was here dies with me
It's all so scary
