It's all blurred from where you stand
You're not all that high in demand
Would you want me more if I would lie
Can't love you girl - Won't even try

What you put on display is such a boring view

Rather you'd go away - I'm just so sick of you

So distant when you turn the dial
A constant haze of cold denial
You're only in it for the fame
Can't you just quit this fucking game
What you want me to be - You know I can't
Your Rocky Horror Superman
You're such a sweet little marionette
I drug myself just to forget
