A bottomless gulf is catching my eye
Wherever I go,  I feel the smell of burning!

Behind me is nothing
Before me - the gate
But why  I don't care about your oath?

In the darkest place, where I will spend my last day
Behind the mirror I hide my mind...

I look at my reflection
When the bloody axe
Cuts off my head!

Who had broken my wings?
Who blindfolds my eyes?
Who has killed my emotions?
Who has formed my life?
