Flowing reminders
From stinking face
And rotting teeth...
Dead sea and stinking world
Kill the poisoners!

Smoking chimneys are
Our future cemeteries!

World is like a huge shit
In which we have... to live!

All creatures are dying
Kids are born dead
Death is a guest
In our homes...

There's nothing to cry for
So let's shout:
Kill the poisoners!

World shown in a picture of our dreams
Is shown the other way
Creeping people and walking insects
Are all the same!

No changes...
