When the last day begins
And fire purifies this world
I want to stand proud
Before the death's glory!

When the last star disappears
And the sky blackens
Proprietor of sacrilege
Will fool on the altar!

Under the black sky
The shadows rising
Empty grave is waiting
For the fire from abyss!

All the people died
Death is everything's lord
Humanity is finished
You can cry now!
