Something's ending
Something's beginning
Your world is spinning
Faster and faster!

Get back - isn't too late?
Blind soldiers march
They want to sell
Your heart and soul!

It's time to know
To know the truth
Humanity ends
When you open your eyes!

Get back, isn't too late?
Holy butchers march
They want to divide
Your mind into quarters!

As the hunted wolf
You don't have a chance
On your way to salvation
Arise angel in black!

It's time to know...
