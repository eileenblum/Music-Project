Your soul cries for help
Your heart's bleeding
Your mind's screaming
For somebody's help...

Nobody and nothing can help you
Growling of pain explodes in your brain
Into deepest side of your soul
Into deepest side of your heart...

Helpless hand of friend
Hopeless friendship of human
You're alone
You're alone
You're really alone!

Your soul...

Your destiny is pain, fear and loneliness
Your way of life is empty
Nobody and nothing can help you
On your way to death!

Helpless hand...
