You're walking in darkness
You see graves around
You're bethinking
What will happen with you?

Dead rotting bodies
Lying in stinking ground
You really don't care
What will happen with you?

Neither god nor Satan
Only your mind and heart
You've got only one chance
For dignified life!

Like a cross on the grave
You consider the mystery
What is the purpose of life?
What do you expect after death?

Neither god...

You will lie in stinking ground
You will rot in grave
With no hope for better life
Without hope and chances!

Neither god...
