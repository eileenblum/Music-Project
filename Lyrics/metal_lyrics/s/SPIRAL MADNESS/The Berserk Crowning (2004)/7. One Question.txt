When sunshine will burn
Everything what is in my soul
Will become the emptiness of my heart
Will become the end of my thoughts!

I won't forget these moments of my life
Which we spend together
Where we have lived and died
When we prayed and cursed!

You'll never be free
You'll never be fair
World is condemned
You're dying!

Death is the only answer
To this question:
Why we have to live
On this fuckin' earth?!
