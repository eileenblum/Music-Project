Disgusting
My life's mystification
Existence without diagnosis
Come to me my dear friend!

My mission, my religion
Confession into declaration
Empire of free nation
My latest perfect incarnation!

Millions of worshippers are in my body
Thousands of guns are in my hand
My enemies are dead
Come to me my dear friend!

What do you think about life?
Are you happy?
Are you falling to the ground?
Come to me my dear friend!

Misery of merciless
In the darkest side of world
Without pain, without a dream
It is only I...

I am your last sister and brother
Forget about sorrow, forget about trouble
And come to me, take my hand
Come to me my dear friend!
