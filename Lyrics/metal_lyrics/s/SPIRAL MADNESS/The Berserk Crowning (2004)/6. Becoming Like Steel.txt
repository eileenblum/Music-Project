Fraud!
Millions of blind dummies
Lie!
Your life is not your life
Truth!
Is only an imitation
Pain!
...through our minds

I can't believe in prophecies
I can't believe in faith
Why I can't decide
What is wrong with my life?

Fraud!...

I hate this solitude
Everything what I see is dark
I am lying in my vomits
Will she come to me?

Fraud!...

I remember her cold fingers
My heart was in her hands
Now I want to vociferate
I can't live without you!

A decay of conclusion
The deformity's illusion
Deprivation of affection
The effect of dissension!
