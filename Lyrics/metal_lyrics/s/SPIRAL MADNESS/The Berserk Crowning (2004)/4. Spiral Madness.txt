Vision appears in my mind
Sick thoughts are draining consciousness...

Do I behave normally?
Fear and hope, despair and love
What is the truth?

Spiral madness is religion
Religion is fiction
Spiral madness - your denial!

Mystery of religion bleeds
God is fucked up in his mind
Body is helpless
Soul fights till the end
Spiral madness of man
Human is a reply?!
