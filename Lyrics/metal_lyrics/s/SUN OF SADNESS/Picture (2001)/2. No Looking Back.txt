No looking back to the live I once had 
It's passing by my eyes
None hears my lonely cries 

Through the dark and gloomy night 
The razor of my knife shines bright 
It's cutting up my lonely life 
Open the gate of a world into I dive 

With the floating blood of mine
I am dying but I fell so fine 
I fell the pleasure in my mind 
About the secrets I will find 

I pray for god and higher being 
But death and blood is all I am seeing 
With this knowledge I can't feel free 
It takes me to the edge of sanity 

I hate this world, my live is sad 
I hate this world, I can't forget 
I hate this world, where the sun won't shine 

I pray for god and higher being 
But death and blood is all I am seeing 
With this knowledge I can't feel free 
It takes me to the edge of sanity
