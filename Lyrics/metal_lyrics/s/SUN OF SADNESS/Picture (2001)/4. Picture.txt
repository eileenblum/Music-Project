"Goodbye" she said, kissed my lips
"I love you" spoke her eyes... to my face
All the time, years through years
"I love you" told her hips to my body 

Sitting here alone
Black like doubt
In front of myself
On falling pieces of the past 

Time marches emotionless
An interested watcher
Passes our face getting older
My soul follows secretly 

Spoken words passing by
Unheard all around
In her mind a picture
Of mine, just not myself 

Sitting here alone
In her room
She's loving a portrait
Of the times behind

Time marches emotionless
Fearsome hunter for body and soul
She moved....away
And I?
