Oh dark master, you have frozen my heart to stone
Friends have changed to enemies and my name has been forgotten
Blown into the world...like a ghost 

Great things will be done and to the dark towers we will run 

We let them shiver with our voices, our shape is horror
I am the first of the same, I am the naked fear of the world
But I am as lonely as a ghost can be 

Great things will be done and to the dark towers we will run
Oh dark lord send us through the night
Give us the power to win the fight 

I long for death but death is what I bring
I long for salvation from the heart of stone
Hate grows up in my heart, the hate for the living
A hate so big... 

He gave us power
He gave us might
To destroy the living
To destroy the light
Oh dark lord send us through the night
Give us the power to win the fight 

Let us spread death and fear, blood should flow
Souls disappear and my laughing tears up the night
