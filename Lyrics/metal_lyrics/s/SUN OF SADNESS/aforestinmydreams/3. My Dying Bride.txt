A fog on a day without night 
A day more like the dawn 
Without real darkness without real light 

Dead lies a girl more beautiful than a swan 
In her casket - her skin so pale 
In her heart is a deadly and bloody tear 
Her broken eyes tell us a dreadful tale 

In my arms lies the prettiest girl of the world 
She is my dying bride 
Oh lord why, why must she die? 

Down my checks running tears full of pain, since my love is dead 
Sometimes I remember her dead body on the plane 
I am quite and still I am sad 
What can I do dreadful life 
Tell it to me my friend, I am still loving her, cause she is dead
