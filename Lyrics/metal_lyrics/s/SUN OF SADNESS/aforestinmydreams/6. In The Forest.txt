So many times I am alone
In bitterness I try to live
So much time but no time to love

Lost in life failing situation

Shadows of my mind
My demons are made of love
An all consuming fire like a kind
Of a devil's circle

I went forth and my eyes are crying
I went forth and my smile is dying
I went forth but blame it all on you

Hidden by a mask of ice
But I have so much to give
Can you see beyond my eyes
Can you help me to live

I can't see beyond your mask
I can't see what is your mask
I can't see but blame it all on you

Feel the pain which you are bringing
Feel the pain and demons singing

Feel the forest is whispering
Feel the moonlight and the shadows
Only friend but still your enemy
The forest
