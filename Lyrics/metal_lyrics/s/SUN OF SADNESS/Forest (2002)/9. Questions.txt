What if there is noone to love?
What if there is noone to adore?
What can I do if I hate myself?
What if there is nothing to living for?

Can I live in a lie?
Can I do what is done?

Existence hurts

What if there is nothing to living for?
What if there is noone to adore?
What can I do if I hate myself?
What if there is noone to love?

Can I begin at the end?
Can I wake up people who are gone?

Existence hurts
