Within a human mind
Is the chaos of black and white
A labyrinth of pain deep inside
Within a human heart
Feelings a so far one only face
Branded by fire of hate

Crawling words of anger foreign in their fate
And search for the end of this endless tale
To bright to go through
To loud to hear the sound
Of the light of this everlasting peace

Dream oh brother dream my hope is fallen
Dream oh brother dream a new nightmare is born
