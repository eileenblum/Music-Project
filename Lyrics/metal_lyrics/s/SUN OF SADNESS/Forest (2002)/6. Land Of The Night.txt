Witherward with these days
Witherward with my tears
I cried for you when you left me
Through the walls of aspiration
Into the land of the night

Was it insanity that beat me
Was it destiny to loose you
I follow you as a star to protect you
But where are you
In the land of the night

Now is the time that I found you
I hold you in my arms
And the sun of sadness shines
Into the land of the night
