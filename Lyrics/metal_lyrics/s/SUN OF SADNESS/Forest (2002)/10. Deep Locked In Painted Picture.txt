You've painted a Picture 
There I saw you scream 
Smashed down by demons 
Caught in an endless dream 

Alone in the dark 
When they tried to catch you 
You cried an eternity 
And slowly your world disappeared 

They started to hurt you 
But you tried to escape 
And you started to whine 
When they stole your tears 

So you finally died... 

Locked in your world 
Will it always be like this 
Fading colours 
And a dying wish 

Please whisper a word 
And remember when you laughed
If you don't that's okay 
You don't need to be tough 

The memory plays a song
But where do you belong 
The melody lingers on 
And plays a silent song
