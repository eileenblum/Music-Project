Filled with human tears
And the essence of human fears
Forever lost

You gaze across the open sea
Ships will come but soon to leave
Like a kind of paradise
The sun will aways arise

In emptiness - this world I leave
In emptiness - I still believe

You die and you see
These oceans are reality
There the human souls are lost
It is the kingdom of eternal frost
