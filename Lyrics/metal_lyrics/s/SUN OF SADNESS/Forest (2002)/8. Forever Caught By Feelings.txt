Something is broken
Deep down inside me
It was buried a long time
But now it is set free

It follows my soul
Like the shadow of a plague
History or present
My future is black

Fading to death
I wish you were here
I remember yur face
I'm reminded of my fear

You have destroyed my life
But I can't forget
The good times of love
And the bad times we had

When angels fall down
We will meet again
I love you forever
Am I insane

You're right in my mind
Since we met first
Cause I love you
Until I burst
