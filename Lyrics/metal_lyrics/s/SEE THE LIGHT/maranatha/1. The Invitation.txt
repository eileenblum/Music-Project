Jesus, I'm calling for you. Jesus, I'm reaching for you.
So, come. So, come Father. We ask that you fill our hearts.
God, We want to breathe your air. We want to feel your love.
Jesus, I'm longing for you.
Jesus, oh how I need you. So, come.
God, oh God you are Worthy. You are worthy to be praised
We come with outstretched hands. We invite you Father.
We invite you to fill our hearts. Jesus, we're calling for you
Cause this is the invitation. Worthy, Worthy. Worthy to be praised.
I worship the Lord, Jesus Christ.
