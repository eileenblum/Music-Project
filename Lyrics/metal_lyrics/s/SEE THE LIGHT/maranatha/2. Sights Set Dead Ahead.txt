Caught up. Entangled in this repeated cycle. Searching, Searching.
The next best thing is what we're after. The quest for satisfaction in these earthly riches.
Conformed to this world. Open our eyes Lord. We long to see.

"Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you"
[Matthew 6:33]

You are my treasure
