This ship has reached the four corners and returned empty handed. Brave the seas.
Dark and sour, a line we lead. Expected ease. Heavy the hour, an arrow we need.
We expect such ease. Take hold this vessel, oh helmsman. This compass, in your hands.
Captain, take us to the ends. For we're with you, yes we can. Brave the seas.
Dark and sour, a line we lead. Heavy the hour, an arrow we need. We expect such ease.

For far to long I had to steer this ship alone.
For far to long I pushed through the raging storms.
I stood there empty and lost, I beckoned for direction and purpose.
But Father, Oh Father... I called your name.
God I've seen you move, I've seen you rescue the lost, and heal the lame.
Jesus, I want to know you. I lay my life before you.
Thank you for dying on the cross and washing away my sin.
I have nothing to offer but still you stand before me with open arms. Father, I believe.

I believe in your love.
I believe in your grace.
I believe in your unending love.
I believe in your amazing grace.
