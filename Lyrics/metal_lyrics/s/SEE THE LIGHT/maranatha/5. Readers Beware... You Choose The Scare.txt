Page by page we flip through
Our lives a story, ourselves the authors
This our attempt, our attempt to find meaning
We search for joy in these worldly offerings
This our attempt, our attempt to find meaning
Joy and happiness were never meant to be temporary
Are we ever satisfied?
Ever satisfied?
These pleasures they melt away
Page by page we flip through
Our lives a story, ourselves the authors
This our attempt to find meaning in this world
We search for joy in these worldly offerings
This our attempt to find meaning
These pleasures they melt away
But God we are tired of searching
We are tired of flipping through our lives page after page
We are weary, we are broken
And we are at Your feet
Jesus it is in You we find everlasting joy
It is in You we find everlasting pleasure
Lift His holy name
"He came that they might have life, and have it more abundantly"
Jesus, we thirst for You
You came for us Father
We will never forget
He came for us
We will never forget
