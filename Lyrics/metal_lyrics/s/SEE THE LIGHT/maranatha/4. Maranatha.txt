Behold our God
Soon comes the day when heaven stands open and the night fades away
Salvation and glory roaring from the skies
Faithful and true
Faithful and true
He approaches with blazing eyes
And the Lord said, "Look I am coming, I am coming soon
I am the Alpha and the Omega
The First and the Last
The First and the Last
The Beginning and the End
Look, I am coming soon
My reward is with me
And I will give to everyone according to what they have done
Cause I am the Alpha and the Omega
The First and the Last
The Beginning and the End"
Prepare for His return
Come!
Let those who hear say
Come!
Let those who are thirsty come
And let all who wish to take the free gift of the water of life
Prepare for His return
