I am the half-hearted. I am the sinful. I am weak. I am the unforgiving. I am the liar. I am the uncommitted. I am the shameful. I am the anger filled. I am the lustful. I am the undeserving. I am the idolater. I am the unsatisfied. I am the disrespectful. I am the coward. I am the miserable. I am the lifeless.
