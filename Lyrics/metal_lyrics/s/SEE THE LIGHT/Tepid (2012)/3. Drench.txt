A gift so unforgettable, forgot. How can the grace, the mercy, the blood so pure be absent. The mighty lamb. Slain. He's slain. A gift so unforgettable. How can the grace, the mercy, the blood so pure be absent. Absentmindedly tossing the love of Christ. Love of Christ. Disgusted. Fed up with my lack of. Lack of desire. Blood King, I cry out to you. Blood King. Help me remember. Red lamb. Drenched for our errors. Red lamb. Drenched for our errors. Disgusted. Disgusting. Remind me, force me to recall this sacrifice. You make life worthy. You make life worthy. I take a breath and hold it in and I can't let this world bring me down. [Drench] I close my eyes just to see it, a better sight that lies ahead. I take the time to collect my thoughts and dreams, in this world so perfect. I wrap myself around the ones that I truly love. Drench drench, now drench me in the freedom. Disgusted, disgusted. Fed up with my lack of desire. Blood King I cry out. I cry out. Lift us up. In your name. In the name of Jests Christ. Blood King, Red Lamb. Now drench me, drench me in the freedom. The freedom that you brought to us. The freedom that you held on the cross. The freedom of your undeserving grace that I forgot.
