Over and over. I'm let down with all I seek in my surroundings. This world doesn't satisfy. Enemy is creating moments of enjoyment, but they're only moments. Only thrills them chills of regret and hollow feelings. I choose the world. I choose this world. Why do I long for the serpent's lies if it continues to destroy, destroy. I'm ripping myself apart. I'm ripping myself apart. So tear, tear. The only satisfaction comes from the Father. I am let down with all I seek in my surroundings. My surroundings. The world, my surroundings. Build up a new path. Lord, Lord. This world, it doesn't satisfy. Over and over and over it doesn't satisfy. Only thrills them chills of regret and these hollow feelings, I choose this world, I choose this world, Over and over. Why do I long for serpent's lies if it continues to destroy me? I'm ripping myself apart, myself apart. This world, these false roads, tear them down. Serpent, you are unworthy. Unworthy. I'd rather listen to you. You, you tell your lies.
