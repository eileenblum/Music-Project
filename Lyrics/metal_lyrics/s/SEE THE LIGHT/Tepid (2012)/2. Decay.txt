Arise. Fresh start to a decayed body. Life offers new beginnings. Yet my mouth remains dry. Lukeworm and hating it. Filthy and tepid. Filthy and tepid. I feel hollow inside, this emptiness. This bad taste still remains. I crave rejuvenation. Holy Spirit, my lungs beg. Let this air be filled of you. Filled of you. Blow air, the wind of revival. Decay, decay. I'm rotting away. Peel this flesh away and make new. I don't want to wake us miserable anymore. I crave rejuvenation. Come and rejuvenate. Holy Spirit, my lungs beg. Holy Spirit, my lungs beg. Let this air be filled of you. Let this air be filled of you. Decay, decay. I'm rotting away. I'm rotting away. Peel this flesh away, flesh away. Blow, blow. Blow the air, the wind of revival, the wind of revival. I feel hollow inside. This emptiness it overtakes me. This flesh, this flesh it overtakes me. Decay, decay. I'm rotting away.
