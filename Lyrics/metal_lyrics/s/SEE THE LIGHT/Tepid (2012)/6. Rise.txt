How can everything we choose be favored over you? Yet I choose the wrong. Yet I choose the wrong. Yet I choose the wrong. Father, rid me of this sin. Father rid me of this sin for I am weak. I'm tired of putting you below all the rest. Rise, Rise. Be my all, my leader. Smash these idols. Rise Rise. Stand above all. Smash these idols. Rise Rise. Stand above all. How can everything we choose be favored over you? You stand tall, above all idols. You stand tall. Just look at how weak I am, hardly able to stand. I'm tired of putting you below all the rest. So i'm asking you to rise! Yet I choose the wrong. Yet I choose the wrong. Yet I choose the wrong. Father, rid me of this sin. Give me a reason to live. Give me, give me. Give me a reason to live. Put these distractions behind. I want to follow you above the all the rest. How can everything I choose be favored, be favored over you. You stand tall above all idols. Smash these idols.
