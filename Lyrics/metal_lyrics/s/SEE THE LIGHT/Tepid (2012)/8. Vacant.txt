Empty. Vacant. In my thoughts I command the presence. Spending days with no fraction, no fragment of love. No route. Did I really loose sight? My focus, the core of it all, clouded. I've pushed you far away. I despise my brain. This vacant jar. I despise myself. This blank implement. In my thoughts I command your holy being. Pour Pour. Fill this empty basin. Replenish. Saturate me with the Spirit. Overflow.
