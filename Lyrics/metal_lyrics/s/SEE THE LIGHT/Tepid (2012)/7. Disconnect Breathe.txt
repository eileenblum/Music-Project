Look at me. Shriveled up in my corner. I need something. I need anything. I need, I need. I need to be made whole. Destroyer, destroy destroy the shadow. It stands above me. Break me free. I long to stand, I long to run. Let me, chase the waters again. I am parched. I am dry. So breathe, breathe breathe oh mighty one. Let your spirit fall. We long for living God. We call for the kingdom's breath. So breathe. Oh mighty one, let your spirit fall. We long for the living God. We call for the kingdom's breathe. Oh mighty one!
