You've promised me everything. But all I feel is alone. I beg for the right words to say, just to make you take it all away. I feel certain in my heart of your loving kind. Why can't I be so sure? This love of mine is fastened into a weak and breaking soul. My flesh is weak, burn it away. My mind is weak, tear it away. My lungs, they beg for the air - which will lead me to that place. This tattered rag I call my life will slowly burn away. Leaving nothing behind but the ashes I was created from. Am I worthy? Am I the wanted? These things that separate me from the water and from the skies is only a dream. Someday soon that gap will be broken.
