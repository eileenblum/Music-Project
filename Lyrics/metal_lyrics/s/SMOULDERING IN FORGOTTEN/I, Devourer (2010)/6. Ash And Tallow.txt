Time stands still before the storm

Alive!

Alive, I have wakenedâ¦ all those years spent wilting to nothingâ¦ and now, my crowning moment
Enactment of the ritualâ¦ 
The blackest rite to fulfill the darkest pledge

Let the flames consume the mage of earthly flesh and bone
Let his ash, in candle light, by the winds be claimed and strewn

Let these words of power unlock the gate to Netherworld
âVash NaâRekht NarâGath
Vash NaâRath Kah Lhey Masâ
In the twilight hour let the prophecy unfold
âVash NaâRath Kah Lhey Mas
Vash NaâRul ArâGhaalâ

Reveling in my blood lust for the coming end to all things
Mankind will learn to

Woe the light
A glorious night
Woe the light
The end is nigh

Reveling in my blood lust for the coming end to all things
Behold the Gate slide open!
The winds claim the ashâ¦ 
Smouldering, forgottenâ¦ 
Smoke from the wick of a blackened tallow stump

Woe the light
A glorious night
Woe the light
The end is nigh
The end has arrived

Time stands still before the storm
The cycle ends now

I am preparedâ¦ ready for the astral journey into the gate to the world beneath where no corporal form may enter unscathed
I am preparedâ¦ and destiny awaits with open arms

Time stands still before the storm
