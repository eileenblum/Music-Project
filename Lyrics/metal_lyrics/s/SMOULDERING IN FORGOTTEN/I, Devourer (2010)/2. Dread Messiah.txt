Caked in ice-cold sweat as I wake
My spectral visitor fadesâ¦
His words cascade through sleepless dreams into a waking nightmare

Who was that man before me?
Not manâ¦ more devil or demonâ¦
or did my eyes deceive me?
Leaving my senses jarredâ¦

My sanity scarred!

Dark thoughts exude my being
Can his words go unheeded?
What is so precious in this life that merits kindness or mercy?

I might be righteous fury
I might be unjustified
The promise of sweet oblivion at the side of the Destroyer

I am tempted
And yet I am terrified
Will I descend into madness?
Or answer a higher calling?

Take your place
Dread Messiah!
Will I descend into madness or become the Dread Messiah?

In the warm dark of my cell where shadows rake at my mindâ¦ my nails tear at my flesh to let me know that Iâm still here

I might be righteous fury
I might be unjustified
Will I descend into madness?
Or answer a higher calling?

Take your place
Dread Messiah!
Will I descend into madness or become the Dread Messiah?

For gain
For my selfish gainâ¦ Will I be vilified?
Through pain, through manâs destructionâ¦ Will l be purified?

Am I the chosen one or am I the unwitting pawn?
The promise of sweet oblivion at the side Abaddon

Am I the chosen one or am I the unwitting pawn?
The promise of sweet oblivion at the side of the Destroyer

Who was that man before me?
My spectral visitor. Can his words go unheaded?
What in this life merits kindness or mercy?
Unwitting pawn?
I am the chosen one
