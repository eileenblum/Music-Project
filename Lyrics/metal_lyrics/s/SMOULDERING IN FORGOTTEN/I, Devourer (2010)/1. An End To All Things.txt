Arise from your mortal slumber
Hear the words of the Eater of Worlds
Obey the creed of the Great Devourer
Abbadon, chained to his iron throne

I, herald of ruinous ends
Serve the master of un-creation
Bring upon you a birthright to claim
O Prophet of the Void

Open your eyes
Your legacy's nigh

A pledge forged in blood, stone and ice
From the lord of the Stygian Depths
Adorn your breast with strength of his rage
Unleash it on the treacherous human race

As herald of ruinous ends
Serve the master of un-creation
Bring upon the human stain
A reckoningâ¦ an end to all things!

Behold
The prophecy unfolds
As the ancient scripts foretold
Apollyon reborn
Destroyer of all

Go Prophet of the void
Seek the gates to Netherworld
Break the spells of the stygian seals
Unleash almighty Abbadon!

Humanity has thrived
On the grace of borrowed time
While the master lays caged
Through the ages

No more!

The strength of his armies grows
The earth trembles with the drones
Of the locust horde's fervor
For the battle to come

And when all man has died
Your place by his side

Arise!

Awake from your half-life existence
Deny not mankind's unmaking
You are chaos-born, entropy, the hand of fate made flesh

O, herald of ruinous ends
Serve the master of un-creation
Bring upon the human stain
A reckoningâ¦ an end to all things

Behold
The prophecy unfolds
As the ancient scripts foretold
Apollyon reborn
Destroyer of all

Go Prophet of the void
Seek the gates to Netherworld
Break the spells of the stygian seals
Unleash almighty Abbadon!

Go Prophet of the void
Seek the gates to Netherworld
Break the spells of the stygian seals
Unleash Abbadon!

Arise!
