The night sky yields to the misty dawn
The birdsong surrenders to the clamor of a procession
That marches along a forest of tombstones 
To where the earth readily awaits to greet their dead

Mist wonât veil these tears
Whatâs left to fear?
I will mourn my love

Under the dim sky
How proud you lie
Sleep with calm, my love

Fate stole you from me
But your memory
Will live on, my love

Our bond ends not here
I know youâll be near
Iâll wait for you in my dreams

In my dreams

But
What comes after the night?
Will the day bring regrets?
What if tomorrow never comes?

Weâll know tomorrow
Weâll see tomorrow
Wonât grieve what might have been
If tomorrow never comes

But
Tomorrow
What comes after the night?
Weâll see tomorrow
Will the day bring regrets?
Wonât grieve what might have been
If tomorrow never comes

Mist wonât veil these tears
Whatâs left to fear?
I will not grieve
If tomorrow never comes

Our bond ends not here
I know youâll be near
Iâll see you in dreams
If tomorrow never comes

Tomorrow Never Comes
