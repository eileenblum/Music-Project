They led him through the desert to the gate of the Netherworld
The Magus and the Coven of Sixâ¦ disguised as loyal servants
Liars!

I followed close behind
This treachery will not go unanswered!... Thus Apollyon pledges!

Their arcane verses carried through the night
Their voices made the hairs of my neck rise
I saw their witchery seal the Gate
I stood there watchingâ¦
waiting for something
Waiting for a signal, for a sign

Abaddon!
Your true servant is here!

Hidden from the eyes of the betrayers
I witnessed the confinement of my master behind the stygian sealsâ¦ locked forever
Abaddon, give me a sign!

Abaddonâ¦ Masterâ¦ Hear my prayers... Abaddonâ¦ On bended kneesâ¦ I pledge myself to you

The hours turned to daysâ¦ the days to weeksâ¦ months... seven yearsâ¦ seen only by Sibu, Sahu and Sopdit... 
Prostrate in the sand before the gate, waiting for your word, your will, your blessing

Flail in hand I make thee offerings
Each strike rending flesh from my body
Each shred of fragile flesh falls in your name... Crimson the sandâ¦ sand stained with my blood

My blood!

Seven years, Abaddon, answer me!
Seven years, Abaddonâ¦ your loyal servant will set you free!
Seven years, Abaddon, answer me!
Seven years, Abaddonâ¦ grant me power, I beg of thee!

Flail in hand I make thee offeringsâ¦ each strike rending flesh from my bodyâ¦ each shred of fragile flesh falls in your nameâ¦ crimson the sandâ¦ sand stained with my own blood!

My blood!

My body bled dry, mutilated my flesh
Starved and blistered till nothing is left
But for you, my master, I would do this again, and again a thousand times!

Is there salvation or delusion in death?
Your voice in my head serves to quicken my breath
Your wrath and your hatred infuse me with strength to avenge you a thousand times!

The Magusâ¦ the covenâ¦ will answer for their crimes!
Avenged a thousand times!
