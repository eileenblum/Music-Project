Banished into the infernal dark for ages
Ten thousand years, I have burned in this cage

Once I was mortal, a sorcerer vile
High Necropriest to the gods of the Nile
Deathâs embrace could never take hold of one whose powers shook the pillars of the world!

I was as God!

Tragedy
By foul deceit betrayed
The Magus and his treacherous Coven of Six bound me!

I, devourer of souls
I, devourer of flesh
I, devourer of lives
I, devour mankind

Come forth and bow
Before your lord
For I have unleashed
My fury through disease
"To kill and to crush"
The words of my creed
None shall live
None shall breath
All will die!

All will die!

Ten thousand years
Imprisoned and weak
Released and unleashed
I'll shatter your world!

O, so long I've burned up inside
My rage and my wrath herald the end of your time

Ten thousand years
Of prayers and pleas
Will not save you from
The Armageddon to come!

Victory, greatest of victories!
The might of the Locust Horde
And my minions of the nether-depths rejoice in the fall of the world
Since man awoke in the valley of time, the hope in his eyes I have loathed
And now the final battle is wonâ¦ behold man's jaded eyes close

Now you know
The strength of your lord
For I have unleashed
My fury through disease
"To kill and to crush"
The words of my creed
None shall live
None shall breath
All will die!

I, devourer of souls
I, devourer of flesh
I, devourer of lives
I, devour mankind
