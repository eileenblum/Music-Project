Mists of the Nether enshroud me
Sever me from this empty husk
Unfurl this mortal coil
Lift me beyond my humanity
Carry me through the Stygian Depths
Take me to the Iron Throne
Where the master is chained to cold stone

Stonework unworn through the centuries
Carved with sigils of the Betrayer and his host... whoâs foulest of sorceries bind thee
But lo, I come on shadowed wings
Your servant to set you free
And bring the worms to their knees!

Behold the severed hands of the magus!
Witness, hordes of Abaddon, as I break the magic seals
Gaze upon the blood of man in rapture
The annals of Adamâs sons draw to a final close
Yet your soul weeps for them morose

No!
These are lies! Lies!
They all had to die!
Shades of my memories haunt my waking dreams
Be gone, blasphemous thoughts, I tire
As was decreed, I will rule supreme!
(So why canât you shut out their screams?

So it has been written
So it must be done

Whatâs done is done
(You are undone)
Whatâs done is done
(You are undone)
Whatâs done is done
(You are undone)
I am undone!

What have I done?
