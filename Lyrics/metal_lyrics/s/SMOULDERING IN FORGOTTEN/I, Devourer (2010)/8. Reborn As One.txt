The mystic chains are broken
His tethers finally severed
Behold his shriveled corpus
Stir on the iron throne
As your soul fills his body
You will come to be reborn as one with the swarm
We are the Locust Horde!

Our lord regains his vigor
Praised be his dark virulence
We are his tools of ruin
Weapons of manâs destruction
We are manâs fears embodied
We are the spawn of nightmares
We bear his seed of madness
Of plague and strife and bloodshed

War!
There will be war!

War!
Glory through countless battles
Plague!
Disease and rot will flourish
Death!
Slaughter the sons of Adam
Fear!
The onslaught of the swarm!

Last of reincarnatesâ¦ Apollyon
Your soul consumed by Abaddon
Now disincarnate, your consciousness extended to the hive mind
Giving life to the lord of death
