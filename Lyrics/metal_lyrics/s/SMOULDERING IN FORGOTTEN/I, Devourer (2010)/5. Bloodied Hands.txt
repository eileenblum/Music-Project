Vengeance meted through the assassination of the coven across time!

I stood before the Nethergateâ¦ my strength returned
Fortified by the voice in my head
Promising to forgive my failures 
Promising penance through righteous murder

Now I see what it was the herald meant
Now I see for what it is I was destined
Now I know what it is I must do
Now I know I must prepare for the fall of man

And with manâs fall
As the Herald foretold
I will be saved... redeemed

Forward through time
The eternal flow sweeps my mind
With the grim purpose
Of hundreds of lifetimes

In the many forms of Apollyon, we saw victory, we saw defeat
Now this sacred duty is mine to bear, I see six of seven seals
The one belongs to the Magus

Vengeance meted through the assassination of the coven across time!

To the streets, I took my knife, I tracked him down
Waited for the moment when he was alone
I, the predator, he the prey
I stuck it in his back when he least expected!

I felt no pity when his wounded body hit the floor
I pinned him with my knees and ran my blade across his jugular
I savored every moan, every jerk of his final death throes

I rolled him onto his backâ¦ I carved the flesh just above his wrists and hacked and broke through the bonesâ¦ his arms just stumps, I had both
Bloodied knife, bloodied hands

And with manâs fall, I will be redeemed

In the many forms of Apollyon
We saw victory, we saw defeat
Now this sacred duty is mine to bear 
I have claimed all seven seals and the Magusâ severed hands
