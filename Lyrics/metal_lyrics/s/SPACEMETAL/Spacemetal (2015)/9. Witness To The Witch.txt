Wife - would not die
Life - live a lie
No eyes no eyes no eyes for you to see through
sliced like flesh is the truth
I saw the flood
crash today
I saw willingness
to wash away
everything
I was a witness to the witch
forevermore
Child - after child
Wild - was it you?
No lies no lies no lies could suffice
Ice formed then we knew
I saw the flood
crash today
I saw willingness
to wash away
everything
I was a witness to the witch
forevermore
(Fast part)
Blood - black!
Path - track
Feed back now burning hell
Heed the fire of the witches spell
On and on - on and on
Crying man on the burning lawn
Made to raise 3 babies in a coven unholy
Save everything just to know it was sold - yeah
Paid a viper - made me write that I loved her
Never never never told you never sign the letter

I saw the flood
crash today
I saw willingness
to wash away
everything
I was a witness to the witch
