1000 legs, strength untold 
a single heart, growing old 
a carapace of majesty 
entomophobe begone; stand; behold 

Hear the cries 
don't defy 
set him free 
the millipede! 

break the chain 
take the rein 
aphids flee 
the millipede! 

I sees the star, the master's home 
so far away, the eco-dome 
humble servant, strength inside 
i call my master - now you know 

Hear the cries 
don't defy 
set him free 
the millipede 

to the sky 
don't ask why 
take the wing 
the millipede! 

gonopods - defy the odds - evolve - now a mystery 
endless sands - poisoned glands - evolve to become history 
segments divided 
moult in hiding 
a thousand stings 
a thousand wings 

To the cloud 
keep the vow 
hardened skin 
the millipede! 

the time is now 
to eat ant cow 
upon his shins 
the millipede 

now spawning fins 
the millipede
