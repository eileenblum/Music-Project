on the third moon of Platus
Disaster strikes and all is lost!
Hold on to a fistful of bullets
Help me load my mind
Deep down in a well of awareness
Enlightened by the sign
Stroll into a room full of elephants
trunks ready for lines so long
Bathroom is a maze for my matter
Reptile writes my song
Roast mutton!
Black Lord!
Strong tongue on the third moon of Platus
Disaster strikes and all is lost!
Woke up in a room full of anthills
They crawl up my mind
Bites cover my sixtieth brain stem
Queen starts to unwind
Drones walk in formation
tunnel deep down in the depth of my ego
Language escapes me
I hold the hand of my ant friend and we go
Proglutten!
Glastord!
Strong tongue on the third moon of Platus
Disaster strikes and all is lost!
