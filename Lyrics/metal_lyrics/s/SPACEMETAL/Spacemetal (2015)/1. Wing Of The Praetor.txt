On a twist - we exist - a blessing to the overlord 
In a line - we define - a word not spoken in an endless time 

Take a world - make a mist - firma for the wealthy 
Plant a sign - sun will shine - third time orbit winds go cut the cord 

Ride Ride Ride 
On the wing of the Praetor 
Ride Ride Ride 
The bones of the holy man 

Send a word - through the hole - worm makes it happen 
Wait a while - receive the file - words of the dead from a billion miles 

Ride Ride Ride 
On the wing of the Praetor 
Ride Ride Ride 
The bones of the holy man
