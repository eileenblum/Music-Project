shaved to pillage eleven homeless suns
pray I kill you with a mercy killing gun
wake up in the morning with a nanotube hanging wondering where it came from
lake of bodies every day's the same!
warrior from the future
touch my hand feel the power there
warrior from the future
hey hey hey hey
slaves and babies taken to the wall
waves come crashing when the star ships start to fall
wake up in the morning with a tachyon singing wondering where it came from
saved by the message sent to me it's from
warrior from the future
touched his hand felt the power there
warrior from the future
hey hey hey hey
does everyone remember
a morning in December
a time of day when the suns don't shine
would everyone say
a victim of the ray
a sorry persona from the future time
would anyone wonder
would anyone cry
would anyone line up to watch you die
would everyone climb
through the tachyon tunnel
running away from the lives and the lie?
warrior from the future
touch my hand feel the power there
warrior from the future
hey hey hey hey
