Jupiter
across
computer screen
slingshot
take me away
new dimensionality
Taurus
nebula
says to me
why are you?
there is no answering
why did you take
my spacesuit away
i hide my face
in my hands I decay
asphyxiation...
cold
death taking hold
gravity
only theory
now tested now told
toss aside
your theory in the black hole
destiny
you can call it that
talk to yourself
cause the world is flat
why did you take
my spacesuit away
i hide my face
in my hands I decay
asphyxiation...
cold
death taking hold
Strong tongue
Fallout in a fistful of whiskey
I'm out of my mind
Allotment of chemicals
You seek and I find
Mist covers my lily pad
Wistful memory of time gone wrong
Flowing down my chemical chamber
Reptile writes my song
No button!
No cord!
