Once, long ago, we had
a vision - and it was sad
sad like the wings of song
it took so long...
Spawned in hand, a star
growing, it seemed so far
far it seemed till yesterday
we turned away...
Touch this side for the last time
slowly, we cross the line
winds cold for one more day
We're taught to pray
Light, Light, Light, Light
Light burns the hands of the innocent
Night, Night, Night, Night
Night turns cold
Fight, Fight,
Fight for a handful of sand in the exodus
Lied to, undermined, controlled
Cower in the sight of a flower
Holding onto dreams that shower
Life and death combined
Conception intertwined
Power it was born without love
Hold on - we dream of
an end, mortality,
look at me, finality, bow!

sad like the wings of song
We were wrong...
