fast like a witch with a terra cat
cold like the hole of the blood bat
wild like fire in the lava field
rest now bitch gonna fit you with a plasma shield
weasel cryin' in the dust storm
broken wires on a rust farm
drydock, years now a 10 second lifetime
shocked by a corpse when I notice that it was mine
sold in the hall of the dung rats
slave to the blade wieldin' cyber-sats
cloaked by the sword of Katalifarinosteles
take my word - it's her - now you have to plant the seed
fire
burns higher
yearns for light
when the bite is acquired
fire
takes desire
foldin' time gettin' high
took the graft from the terra cat
fused with the shaft of the phalla-gnat
stem cell baby from the womb of the all-source
naked, cold, mad, raving, crazy from the life force
fire
burns higher
yearns for light
when the bite is acquired
fire
takes desire
foldin' time gettin' high
