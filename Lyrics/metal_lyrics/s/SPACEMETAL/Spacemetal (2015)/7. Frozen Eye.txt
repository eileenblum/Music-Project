Bracing for winter
Blood in the trees
Thaw by the atom
Now it is free
Readings begin to place more concrete importance on the findings
Intelligence, cold - uncompromised by emotion - define blindness
The signal is given - billions are driven from their minds in the blink of his eye
Single in consciousness - blessed to be alive I suppose I should lay down and die
It's the frozen eye
It's the frozen eye
Don't ask why the eye envelops the sky
It's the frozen eye
It's the frozen eye
Don't ask why the eye envelops the sky
What did he tell you?
What do you see?
It said Love is a concept
that is strange to me
Feelings begin when dark matter is thinned by the hybrid
The being that burned four thousand years of the learn-ed words are lies yeah
The signal is given - billions are driven from their minds in the blink of his eye
Single in consciousness - blessed to be alive I suppose I should lay down and die
It's the frozen eye
It's the frozen eye
Don't ask why the eye envelops the sky
It's the frozen eye
It's the frozen eye
Don't ask why the eye envelops the sky
They had a world
You know it
Rapture is hurled
below it
They learned to fly
away that night
through a hole in fabric of time
space and light
cries of the souls
were heard that day
existence, gone
with gravity
depravity was made cold that night
when the frozen eye took form and was given sight
it's the frozen eye
the frozen eye
the frozen eye
the frozen eye
Bracing for winter
Blood in the trees
Thaw by the atom
Now it is free
The sins of all those whose beliefs were imposed now divining
On poles in the valley of our dismembered woes now aligning
