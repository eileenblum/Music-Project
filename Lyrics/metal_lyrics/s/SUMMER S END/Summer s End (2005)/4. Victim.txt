devoured time with your story of fiction
caste into my flesh like a hook
through my lips that has kept me bonded
and remained silent with stitches
keep me bounded by your wonders
tied up and gagged by your curse
caress my dead sould with our wisdom 
for this is the last straw I am the victim
every sentence you have helped me supress
myhostility has grown with you
endure your near future with eternal agony
stabbed in the back with our own knife
your silence helped consume me
never to let the door be kicked in 
and to share my pain within myself
no one else
as this casked is closed over me
full of razors and nails
the screams of agony
through small cracks inside
