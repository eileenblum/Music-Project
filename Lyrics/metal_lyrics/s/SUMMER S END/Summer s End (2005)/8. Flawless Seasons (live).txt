closing my eyes sealed to the floor I can feel my temptation burning
hated by one constructs my anger this is for my flawless season
binary blood flowing fast with my hands tied tightly behind me
facing my others in sincerity this is for my flawless season
misconstrued acts of your fashinable anger attempting at my life's
sentence of fear
my binded hands wont be burned as a black sunrise darkens the vast plains
restrain me from the neck and above darkness blinds you from the dreams
demons control all thoughts of you this is for my flawless season
