held up along this tattered path
of your life and my death
and bury the sense of neglect 
and recover this condemned ghost
his book is covered in solid black
to hide the feelings inside
the silence is hidden in small print
im trapped in this motionless room
shattered into one million pieces
of memories and consequences
smoke and fog keeps you blinded by ignorance
where, in this grim forrest of sincerity
they've come to bury me in hollow ground
grantted your lust and dignity
