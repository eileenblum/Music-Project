[feat. Michael Graves, ex-Misfits]

seems a million miles away inside this twisted mind
thats warped in me the line advances into the onslaught
in the end they may all be dead but me
a bullet hits from the right side
the tracers drop from hell reign down on me
a head wound his brains come out all over me
we all stand down
Im accurate and im deadly
trained assasin cold blood pours through me
in the middle of fire fight I zero in and destroy all I see
the rocket hits on the right side
a tracers splash from hell reign down on me
a dark room a head wound his brains come down all over me
we all stand down
I cant die with all their eyes on me
must move theres something wrong with me.
