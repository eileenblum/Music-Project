blood splattered around the chamber like a shotgun suicide
expose my horrific ending without a tragic note
always cursed until this time I pulled the trigger
with the bullet came happiness without shame
my blood has drawn thick
through my narror tunnel washed away
killing the hope and compassion I once had for life
and all of the integrity in between
try to explain the feeling of being deceased
when you have died along with all feeling
shredding flesh out of anger to cover my wounds 
open and bound to infection of demise
terror does not begin to explain this feeling.
