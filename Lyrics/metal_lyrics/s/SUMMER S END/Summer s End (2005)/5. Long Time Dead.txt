the devils creation of a heartless soul
brought among us in familiar form
to resurrect all forms of greed
hated to death, yet in control of all
to pass in season is to die
killing every ounce of respect
bury all expectations
killing every ounce of you
bury with my hands
foreshadow and witness and end to fall
before I watch the reign shatter
every dream you have dreamt and
all hope you hold, falls down.
