In fading distant dreams you will return,
Until you are a whisper,
A ghost in my emotion.
Embrace your world and all it holds,
Keep your mindï¿½s false sanctuary,
Spread your wings and try to soar.

Cast love aside and look away,
A wake of pain trailing behind,
Follow the blind with open eyes.
Searching for your absolution,
Knowing it doesnï¿½t exist,
Self-given atonement, for self-made sins.

Your compassion strangely vacant,
A faï¿½ade to hide the hate,
Your sincere lies flow easily.
A feigned image of your soul,
Forgotten virtues long since dead,
Your voice haunts my dreams.

Stand back and watch me fall,
Clutch the air where I once stood.
The emptiness, just a reflection of your heart.

In fading distant dreams you still return,
Nothing more than a whisper,
A remnant of our love.
Cast love aside and look away,
A wake of pain trailing behind.

Stand back and watch me fall,
Clutch the air where I once stood.
The emptiness, just a reflection of your heart.

Stand back and watch me fall,
I spread my wings but I fail to soar,
Stand back and watch me fall.
Better dead than half alive,
Stand back and watch me fall.
