The lightest kiss of snow,
Hiding all the pain beneath,
Did you think my heart was stronger,
Than the ice you're standing on?

Frozen by your touch,
Yet sustained by your love,
Did you think I wouldn't crumble and fail,
Like the things you claimed to feel?

Deep in my soul,
Where I lie waiting,
I sit and pray for the dawn.
I said my prayers with no one to hear
The ease with which you failed me.

Here in your soul,
Where I lie aching
I sit and pray for the dawn.
I said my prayers with no one to see
The ease with which you failed me.

I hide my soiled hands,
Away from seeking eyes,
My trust betrayed, you walk away,
Holding my life in your hands.

Sometimes I wish you had died.

Vivid dreams of you still plague my sleep
My faith, not made of stronger things
You cast me into the fire,
And you left me there to burn

I am alone in my love
Finally, I can see that I meant nothing after all

All that matters to me is youï¿½
