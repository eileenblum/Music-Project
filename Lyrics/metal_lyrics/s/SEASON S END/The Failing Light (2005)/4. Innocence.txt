The euphoric age has now died,
Memories burn where they once shone.
The beauty of innocence,
Left forgotten in a dying day.

A kiss goodbye,
The past has faded away.
Love, inscribed deep in the wood,
Romantic words streamed like blood.

Trying to stare through the mists of the future,
Erase the bliss that once was the past.
Promises passed your lips with ease,
Only to whither in time.

My heart lost in the mire,
Paint this face a shade of misery.
