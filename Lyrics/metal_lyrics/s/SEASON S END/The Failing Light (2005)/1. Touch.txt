Shroud me in satin,
Cover me in dirt,
The grave swallows me.
Promises of eternal memory,
Buried deep in the cold, cold earth.

Shroud me in flowers,
Cover me in earth,
The grave swallows me.
Empty words of false piety,
Buried deep in the cold, cold earth.

Why has it been so long,
Since you said that you loved me?
Why has it been so long,
Since you put your arms around me?
Why has it been so long,
Since I felt loved?

Hollow words for an empty body,
Tears dripping over my headï¿½

Shroud me in flowers,
Cover me in earth,
The grave swallows me.
Empty words of your piety,
Buried deep in the cold, cold earth.

My soul flies awayï¿½

ï¿½Iï¿½ll shelter you with a long lost peace,
A kind heart in a fragile soul.
The kindest thing is to let you go,
But itï¿½s this that bores the hole inside.
How brave do I feel now,
Laying with you in the failing light?
How can I see your face,
Reflected in the shards of your shattered life?ï¿½

How long has it been,
Since you felt loved?
