In spite of all these things that I could never have,
Iï¿½ve seen a distant light insideï¿½

With eyes of hope Iï¿½ve drowned myself,
An angelï¿½s tear on my shoulder stained.
Othersï¿½ sorrows cut me deeper,
And yet my own laments leave me drained.

And in the waning light,
I saw my angel take first flight.
Dried up and entwined in my soul,
My life, the one thing that I canï¿½t control.

Lost in the fog of my fears,
My eyes welled up silver, I drowned in my tears.
Scarred with a pain that stems from my mind,
Ascensions to Heaven leave me behind.

She left me, left me in despair.
I can see Iï¿½m alone in here.

I cannot suffer a tortured life,
All I dared to love is dying.
 From a haunted sleep she calls to me,
And now I wake to find her gone.
My life a dream.

Stay with meï¿½
