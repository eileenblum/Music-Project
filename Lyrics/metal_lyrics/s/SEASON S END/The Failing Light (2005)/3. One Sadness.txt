You cannot hold me down here,
Your eyes stab at my back.
I hold my hands out to the light,
Another memory fades away.

More beautiful than a painted angel,
These porcelain masks we hide behind.
Your hatred and shame hidden by pride,
A mirror of everything you once denied.
Crushing my every hope with your love,
Unrelenting turmoil, your soul beyond repair.

My body is still frozen,
The pain still burns inside.
You held me down on a bed of glass,
And part of me has died.

The mask I wear betrays my fears,
Close your eyes to the pain I feel,
Iï¿½m screaming inside.
The chains that once were holding me,
Become forever my security,
My heart is weeping.

The dream has died,
I sink into the dark.
I see a glimmer of hope,
And yet it leaves me blind.

My body is still frozen,
The pain still burns inside.
You held me down on a bed of glass,
And part of me has died.
