[Tolkki-Matos]

Once we sailed together
Once we had a dream
The wind was gently touching our faces,
Safe in your arms...
Your rainbow colored eyes
Sunshine on your hair
We talked to the night, the sadness in your eyes,
I knew you had to go...

Alayna, the mystery
You were mine until the day was gone
I thought you were meant to be forever
Alayna, our souls were light
As I held you in my arms so tight
I saw God reflecting into your eyes,
My Angel...

Sometimes I wake in the night
Screaming out your name
The call of your heart won't let me be,
Your voice echoes in my heart...

Alayna, the mystery
You were mine until the day was gone
I thought you were meant to be forever
Alayna, our souls were light
As I held you in my arms so tight
I saw God reflecting into your eyes,
My Angel...

Watching the stars above,
The pond and the oak, the grass...
We made a promise, love is forever,
I never saw you again...

Alayna, the mystery
You were mine until the day was gone
I thought you were meant to be forever
Alayna, our souls were light
As I held you in my arms so tight
I saw God reflecting into your eyes,
My Angel...
