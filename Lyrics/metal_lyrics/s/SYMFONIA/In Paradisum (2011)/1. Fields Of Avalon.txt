[Tolkki-Matos]

Sometimes I feel I've got nowhere to go
Life gets to me and I don't want to know
Far, far away, I'm here to stay
I won't be led to astray

I turn my back and walk away
Cause I just have to find another way
Turning the page, leaving the cage
Having a new day to face

Fields Of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me... to Fields Of Avalon!

So now I left my past behind
So many things for me to find
Far, far away, I'm here to stay
Having a new day to face

Fields Of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me... to Fields Of Avalon!

Fields Of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me...

To Fields Of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me... to Fields Of Avalon!
