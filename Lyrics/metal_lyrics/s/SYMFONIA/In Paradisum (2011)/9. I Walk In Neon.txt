[Tolkki-Matos]

So many times, out in the dark
Visions of hope keep passing by
As in a trance, heading nowhere
Felt so lost in time

Though I still could see the light

Then came a day, you crossed my way
Wondering why life is insane
But nothing could change the blackness around
Night was endless then

I've been searching on and on
To find any answer to my prayers
There was just a glimpse that could light the way
That is why I walk in neon today

So many times, out in the night
Visions of hell keep coming by
Lost in a dream, time to wake up
Hidden from the dawn

I've been searching on and on
To find any balsam to my agony
There was just a spark left to guide the way
That is why I walk in neon today

I've been searching on and on
To find any balsam to my agony
There was just a spark left to guide the way
That is why I walk in neon today
