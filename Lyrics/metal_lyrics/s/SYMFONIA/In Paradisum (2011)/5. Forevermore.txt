[Tolkki-Matos]

You saw the future before your eyes,
You haven't known who you are
So many wrong steps you've walked,
But were they wrong at all?

Fate is a book written on your own
Pages you read in the dark
Don't be scared of the sight down below
When you lift off and fly, straight to the sun

Forevermore, we'll live a dream
Life is brighter than it seems
There's a place for you and me, forevermore!
And in the hardest days we'll sing
Like we've never sung before
All troubles fade away, forevermore

I have been wandering across the world
I have been looking for love
Somewhere I've driven insane
And there I left my soul

I found a motive inside your eyes
To stand up and recompose
Now we know, the time has arrived,
We'll tear down the skies, forevermore...

Forevermore, we'll live a dream
Life is brighter than it seems
There's a place for you and me, forevermore
And in the hardest days we'll sing
Like we've never sung before
All troubles fade away, forevermore

Forevermore, we'll live a dream
Life is brighter than it seems
There's a place for you and me, forevermore
And in the hardest days we'll sing
Like we've never sung before
All the troubles fade away, forevermore
