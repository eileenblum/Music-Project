[Tolkki-Matos]

Sun's setting down, shadows covering
One more day is gone
Wrapping our dreams in a winter snow
Hiding our fears, we must go!

Night time is calling my name,
We are spreading our wings, we must fly
To a brand new horizon we all must go

Come by the hills, we meet you there
Leave all your worries behind if you dare
By the hills, so much to share
We are gathering, so come by the hills!

New kinds of way we are looking for
Sailing towards the new shore
Courage and faith in our hearts, we go...
Finally free again!

Night time is calling my name,
We are spreading our wings, we must fly
To a brand new horizon we all must go

Come by the hills, we meet you there
Leave all your worries behind if you dare
By the hills, so much to share
We are gathering, so come by the hills!

Come by the hills, we meet you there
Leave all your worries behind if you dare
By the hills, so much to share
We are gathering...
