[Tolkki-Matos]

Another day
Far above, the winter sun
Has raised up, trying to melt the snow
You waste your life waiting for the others
To define what is right and what is wrong for you
Stand up, struggle!

Rhapsody in black, hit the shadows back
Find your destiny and never, never let it go
Rhapsody in black, you're ready to attack
Change your destiny and never regret anything

To be alive
Way larger than you've wondered
A shelter to protect you from the storm
What is a lie, but the reverse of a thunder?
Casting shadows over, roaming in eternity
Don't get stuck in there!

Rhapsody in black, hit the shadows back
Find your destiny and never, never let it go
Rhapsody in black, you're ready to attack
Change your destiny and never regret anything
Anything, anymore!

Rhapsody in black, hit the shadows back
Find your destiny and never, never let it go
Rhapsody in black, you're ready to attack
Change your destiny and never regret anything
Anything, anymore!

Rhapsody in black...
