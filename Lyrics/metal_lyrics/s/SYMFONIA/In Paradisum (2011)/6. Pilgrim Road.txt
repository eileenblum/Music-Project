[Tolkki-Matos]

Out in the mist, the rainbow behind
Above the mountains, a road to the sky
Screaming for mercy, spinning like fools
Everyone longs for the eternal soul

Not long ago
There were roses along the way
Trust and belief in the mystery
No one could make such a vision collapse
Until it fell...

There's a bridge across the land
For the few ones who intend to be
On a trip to the unknown
Walking down the Pilgrim Road

There's a bridge across the land
For the few ones who intend to be
On a trip to the unknown
Walking down the Pilgrim Road
