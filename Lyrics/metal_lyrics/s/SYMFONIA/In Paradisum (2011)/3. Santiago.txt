[Tolkki-Matos]

Follow the stream day after day
Pull your sekt behind
This Pilgrim Road extends away
Through the sands of time

We are craving to survive
Marching side by side
Spreading the word as we ride on

Carrying along misery and crime
Hidden by a sign
Almighty force shows no remorse
Fear made us blind

Shall we heal our scars at last?
Let go of the past?
Is someone out there when we cry out?

Santiago, cast a bless on us
Grant indulgence, wipe out our fears on earth
Lay your sword upon our heads
Before you we'll kneel, Santiago

Towers of sand fall in the end
Heaven was a lie
Arrows of hate tear down your heart
Love has been denied

We are craving to survive
Marching side by side
Is someone out there when we cry out?

Santiago, cast a bless on us
Grant indulgence, wipe out our fears on earth
Lay your sword upon our heads
Before you we'll kneel, Santiago

Santiago, cast a bless on us
Grant indulgence, wipe out our fears on earth
Lay your sword upon our heads
Before you we'll kneel, Santiago
