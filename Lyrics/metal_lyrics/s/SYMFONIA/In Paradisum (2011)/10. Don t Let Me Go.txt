[Tolkki-Matos]

So here I stand, towards the end
No more games and no pretend
Every now and then tears run down slow
Body hurts without a soul

I hear a voice across the wind
Can you recall all vows we made?
Is it easy then to let me go away
One more time?

Don't let me go, I'm here to stay
Enjoy the moment, live day by day
Don't let me go, united we stay
And in the morning, the pain is gone away
Don't let me go...
I'm back here to stay

When we were fools and our hearts young
There was a lesson yet to be learnt
Shall we let our dreams chill away the pride?
Can we believe the end is a start?

A single smile can change a day
But words of mercy are all in vain
I won't leave you now, don't let the sun go down
On our souls...

Don't let me go, I'm here to stay
Enjoy the moment, live day by day
Don't let me go, united we stay
And in the morning, the pain is gone away
Don't let me go...
I'm back here to stay
