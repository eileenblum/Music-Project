Today has just begun, another
Cycle to be spun, no further

I seem to freeze in time, unbending
Seem to be stuck in rhyme, unending

The way to go unclear, uncertain
No way to tell from here, disturbing

I seem to freeze in time, unbending
Seem to be stuck in rhyme, unending

Facing my unchanging time
Facing my unchanging mind

Unchanging memory
An image unrevised
And everywhere I look
A change is still denied

(I seem to freeze in time, unbending
Seem to be stuck in rhyme, unending) [2x]
