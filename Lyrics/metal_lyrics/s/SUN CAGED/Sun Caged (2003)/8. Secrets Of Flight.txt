Nothing to slow down the ride
Tripping down this illusive climb
Force fed for most of my life
Wings I had disappeared overnight
We slide down, to each his sin
Allowed, wasted everything

Amongst the waves to disappear
Beneath the surface we appear to be

So we've tried once again
Bleeding dry faith at end
Static remains. Dead at first sight
Never explained the secrets of flight

Nothing to slow down the ride
Tripping down this illusive climb
Still slide down, to each his sin
Allowed, wasted everything

So we've tried once again
Bleeding dry faith at end
Static remains. Dead at first sight
Never explained the secrets of...

So if we ray seek shelter from the pour
This acid rain that bleeds all our dreams
So if we stay a while to decrease the pain
Need this relieve to take the time to breath
Should I speak with no one to disagree
No one to reach, no one to see
Should I cling to nothing we hold so dear
Should I try to break this common fear

I play dead high upon my stage
Abandon you to disengage
Being here is more then I can bear
More then I can feel,
More then I can spare

I drink the water in which I drown
About to meet the sky
I taste the ground...

So we've tried once again
Bleeding dry faith at end
Static remains. Dead at first sight
Never explained the secrets of flight
