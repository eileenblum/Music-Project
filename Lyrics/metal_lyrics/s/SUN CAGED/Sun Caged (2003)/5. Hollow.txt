Whispered like a breeze,
Rote the sound relieves my pain.
Midst the machine.
Feed upon his stain.

Casted like a spell,
The need to feel has fled my will,
Still I can't tell
The emptiness to fill

Wasted lies to deny
This hollow space inside
Wasted time passes me by
Many times I've tried

Wasted lies to deny
This hollow space inside
Wasted time passes me by
Many times I've tried

Let light come in to taste
The glass evasive stare.
Like shifting tides the picture
Bands the many sides this story has.

Wasted lies to deny
This hollow space inside
Wasted time passes me by
Many times I've tried

Redefine, Redesign...
