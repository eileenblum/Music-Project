Mourn the death you celebrate
Love the ones you used to hate
Place of sorrow, guide our hand
Murdering the innocent

Break down to me
If all is wasted endlessly
Your loss and gain
Your smiles and pain
Among with all that will remain

Won't be long don't be afraid
To feel is just a passing state

Break down to me
If all is wasted endlessly
Your loss and gain
Your smiles and pain
Among with all that will remain

Throw your stones
Your sins all known

I'll take back that what I gave
Don't mind possessions that they save
(And)Until then in little waves
Deliver me the food I crave

Regardless of what they say,
Don't just let us drift away
Loneliness our smiles of gray,
Our solitude on the eighth day

Break down to me
If all is wasted endlessly
Your loss and gain
Your smiles and pain
Among with all that will remain
Nothing I'm afraid....
