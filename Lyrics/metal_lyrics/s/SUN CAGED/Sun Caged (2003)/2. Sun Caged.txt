Once the weight is lifted off
No burden clouds my mind
Shattered lies this broken chain
I put it out of sight

Eyes to the sun [2x]
Random and blind directions we run
Eyes to the sun [2x]
Caged from this one regret I have done

Sifted through the hands of time
One question still remains
Stated like a memory
And all that it contains

Eyes to the sun [2x]
Random and blind directions we run
Eyes to the sun [2x]
Caged from this one regret I have done

Forced into sleep,
These secrets that I keep from myself.
...from myself
Decide, I must remain to hide
All these lies so dear to me

Twice the weight is lifted off
One burden hurts my mind
Shattered still this broken chain
But not so hard to find

Eyes to the sun [2x]
Random and blind directions we run
Eyes to the sun [2x]
Caged from this one regret I have done
