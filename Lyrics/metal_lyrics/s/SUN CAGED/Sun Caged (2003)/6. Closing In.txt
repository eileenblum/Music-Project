Silent stars build this place
Sonic bars surrounded stage
Painted smiles the puny bait
Moving limbs to fascinate

Begin the dream I wake instead
On gold lined silver plates their heads

A smothering embrace
This tiny breathing space
I see our distance closing in

Speak to me your hunger
But reach for me no longer
Painted smiles the puny bait
Moving limbs to fascinate

Begin the dream I wake instead
On gold lined silver plates their heads

A smothering embrace
This tiny breathing space
I see our distance closing in

Awaited fall from grace
With drowned and netted face
I feel our limbs are growing thin

A smothering embrace
This tiny breathing space
I see our distance closing in
