Yesterday I saw the sun go down
And feast his rest
Without light I saw his touch the ground
And sleep at last

Together now we take this alone,
Never ever really leaving home

The speed we go amazes me,
Still slow the silent land
The distances we go to
Still spin circles in the end

Together now we take this alone,
Never ever really leaving home

It seems this hurt will never heal
Blessed and cursed the time we steal

Reason seems to hide deep inside of me
Questions never far behind,
Plague my mind

They say you hear, just don't reply
They grasp at straws and so do I

It seems this hurt will never heal
Blessed and cursed the time we steal

Reason seems to hide deep inside of me
Questions never far behind,
Plague my mind

The speed we go amazes me,
Still slow the silent land
The distances we go to
Still spin circles in the end

Together now we take this trip alone,
Never ever really leaving home
