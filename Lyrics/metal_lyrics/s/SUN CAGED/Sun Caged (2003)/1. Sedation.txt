Space and time all fall behind
Strange machines to soothe my mind

Resting this sensory sleep keeps me confined
Recalling a memory undefined

Repressive sedative restraint
The image of myself erased

Distant voices redicate
Colored screenshots will sedate

Following
Into this spiral descent, it is pulling me in
Salvation
Lies on the other side
Sedation
Whispering unfocused unaware memories
Stays with me
Singing its powerful sedative song to me

Silent witness set aside
Let all beauty pass me by

This solid liquid-live display
Surrounds me everywhere
Sedation keeping me at bay
Keeping me unaware...

Following
Into this spiral descent, it is pulling me in
Salvation
Lies on the other side
Sedation
Whispering unfocused unaware memories
Stays with me
Singing its powerful sedative song to me

Space and time all fall behind
Strange machines to soothe my mind
