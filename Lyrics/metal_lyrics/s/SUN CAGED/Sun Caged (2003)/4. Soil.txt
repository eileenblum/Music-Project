(Among the blind we need to see again
Rise from the ground.
The need to feel again
Faces paled as we begin to run
Outside this cage
That has kept us from the sun

Follow me road to infinity
The journey strange, imaginate
Slow the pace into reality
Shake the soil which you care) [2x]

Among the blind we need to see again
Rise from the ground.
The need to feel again
Faces paled as we begin to run
Outside this cage
That has kept us from the sun

Follow me road to infinity
The journey strange, imaginate
Slow the pace into reality
Shake the soil which you care
