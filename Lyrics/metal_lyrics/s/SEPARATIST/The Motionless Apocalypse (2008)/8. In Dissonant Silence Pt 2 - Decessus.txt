Here we stand, the wretched unsealed, alongside the dead and dying,
Resurrected from deep within death and hades,
Stricken with the irreversible darkness of our final judgement,
Those wretched pages have turned for the last time

Without even a negligible shade of our pass to ascension,
And now, in cold chaotic remembrance we are cast down into infinite ruin

Into the flames of our failure, our inhuman misery

With screams of desperation and despair,
We descend beyond recognition, our blasphemous hearts decay, we fall,
Further and further into the all consuming flames of our eternal damnation,
Burning, rotting alongside the blood-soaked spirits of death,
And in these final dissonant moments, it becomes clear,
I'm never going home, how have we fallen so far?
Why did we refuse to be saved?
What have we become?
