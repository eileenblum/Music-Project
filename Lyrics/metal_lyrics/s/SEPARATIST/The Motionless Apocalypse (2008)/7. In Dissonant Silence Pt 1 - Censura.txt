Here we stand,
Alongside the dead risen from the depths,
Alone amongst the masses, in silence screaming,
Deafening, how have we fallen so far?

What have we become?
Transfixed,
Apparitions lead me down into inevitable ruin,

I come undone,
As the hallowed pages turn,
In cold remembrance

I've fallen short of absolution,
How have we fallen so far?
Why did we refuse to be saved?
What have we become?

In these final dissonant moments,
It becomes breathtakingly transparent,
I'm never going homeâ¦
