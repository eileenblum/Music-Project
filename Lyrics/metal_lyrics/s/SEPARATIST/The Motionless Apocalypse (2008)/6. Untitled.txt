One by one, the seals are broken,
Step by diligent step we draw ever closer to the climatic revelation,
The motionless apocalypse

Broadcasting to us the way to final liberation,
With every volatile motion, the wretched horsemen,
The nameless advocates of the terminal holocaust ride forth

Pouring out their hateful designs,
Our purity dies tonight

The martyred souls of aeons past,
The spirits of the slain, arise with a desperate plea for vengeance,
The pain of their suffering at the hands of the earth
Coursing through their veins and their frail voices

The earth shakes beneath our cursed feet,
Our final sunrise turns black, a thick darkness,
Red like the blood of the martyrs, envelops the full moon

The stars that once lit our blackened sky fall like tears,
And with the devastating sound of the heavens above us shattering, receding, deafening,
The eternal promise of mankinds salvation revealed in a discordant apex,
For all of us who would receive,
Redemption was revealedâ¦
