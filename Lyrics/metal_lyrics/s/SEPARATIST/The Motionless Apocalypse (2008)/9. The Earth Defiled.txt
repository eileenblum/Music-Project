'Mystery, babylon the great,
Mother of prostitutes, and of the abominations of the earth.'
Reads her blasphemous title carved into her silken flesh

She, the wretched whore, who came to defile our chaotic earth,
Draped in shimmering scarlet like the coagulated blood of her slain

Her golden chalice overflows with filth and adultery,
The empty faces of all the earth, defiled, as she lay,
Drunk on the blood of the saints martyred at her calloused hands
All the earth and its desolate kings pray in a violent resonance for her demise,
They flock like moths to an unholy flickering of flame

She, the wretched whore, who came to defile our chaotic earth,
Draped in shimmering scarlet like the coagulated blood of her slain

In a volatile symphony of destruction,
Calling for vengeance,
Screaming for her blood to flow like rivers
Through our ulcerated landscapesâ¦
