Tyranny, vengeance and blasphemy,
The sickening marks of the unholy trinity,
Cast down upon this despicable existence to defile the unsealed

To wage war on the kingdom of heaven,
Screaming with a hematic asperity for the blood of the saints on his decrepit hands,
The infernal synthetic godhead sits on his vile throne,
As the flames descend from the skies to scorch this desolate earth

Blasphemous words seep forth like blood from his inimical lips,
Breathing prophecies of deceit and insolent acclaim for the one true falsehood

Birthing this depraved architecture of filth and heresy,
To wage war on the kingdom of heaven with a hematic asperity,
The anaclasis of reason, the spiralling apostasy of the unsealed populace,
And we, the unsealed, are defiled

Made abject by these infernal tyrants,
Forcefed blasphemy and ethereal disgust

The flames descend from the sky to scorch this desolate earth

The odious mark is etched in our rotten flesh,
Our damnation made true, carved into our wrists reads six-six-six,
Our eyes shift in and out of focus,
We are the unsealed, we are the ruined, we are the deceasedâ¦
