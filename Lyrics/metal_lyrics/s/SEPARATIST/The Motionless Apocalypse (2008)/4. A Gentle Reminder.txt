Whispering words of dissolution,
As compassion fails, atrophying sanctity,
We're losing faith, descending into suffocation,
A relapse into infinite desolation,
And so this hollow earth is defiled

Now all that remains, this memonic oracle,
A gentle reminder of our reverence lost,
Of the carnage converging on our wretched earth,
Foretelling the demise of salvation

Calling our names in desperation,
Transcending death, with admonitions of our ruin,
Our disregard sees us falling silently towards the end,
Fall, our deliberation drenched with spite for those who heeded that infernal warning,
Leaving us to rot in the vile stench of our own miseryâ¦
