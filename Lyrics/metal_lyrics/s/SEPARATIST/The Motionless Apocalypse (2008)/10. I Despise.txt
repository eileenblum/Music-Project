As i look into the decaying night sky,
I watch as our once flourishing earth is showered violently
With flames descending like bitter tears
Poured forth from the heavens

In slow motion drops of blood frozen like hailstones rip through our frail skin,
One third of our now deceased planet is cast silently down into eternal fire,
Poured forth from the heavens

The flooding rivers and spiralling oceans turn to blood
Like that of the saints martyred at our hands

We are drowning, the ocean calls us inwards,
All the while conspiring with our dissonant sun to drown us in within themselves,
As day turns prematurely to darkness,
We are consumed by the virulent night that surrounds us, suffocating,
Smothering, the stars have fallen silent,
The sun refuses to continue to shed its light,
I despise the dissolution, the hatred that we have allowed to pull us under,
Drowning us in the mercurial oceans of blood,
These scarlet stains will not wash clean,
Terminal reminders of what we have becomeâ¦
