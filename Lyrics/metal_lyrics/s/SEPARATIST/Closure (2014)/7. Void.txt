We stand, pierced, in unending anguish
Our futile invocation falls
As dissonant skies remain soundless and inanimate

Returning void to our listless bodies
Drenched in arterial nectar of the innocent
Covering our frail skin like the rain
We are filled with measureless despondency
We are as one with the dust of the ground

Silent hymns of absolution and regret spill from our open throats
Despite everything we remain encased in this empty shell of a world

Decaying in ethereal unison with the void
Left as lifeless shadows, wracked with pestilence

Lost within inhuman convulsions of undying misery
Forsaken and left to rot
Beneath this wretched empyrean

This nameless voiceless god
Insatiable, unattainable, hanging just out of reach
We are left as shadows
