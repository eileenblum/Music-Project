Breathless we awaken
As wretched monuments of human pestilence
Draped with sickness and defeat we stand in disbelief
Mere shadows of what used to be

This hollow eminence we once embodied
This frail Earth that stood beneath us
Now lies motionless as carrion
A relic laced with vacuity and despair
Inhaling a once limitless beauty

Drenched with flames in the wake of our own pitiful arrogance
Are we all thatâs left?
Are we the sole heirs of this grave we used to call a home?

This frail Earth that stood beneath us
A relic laced with vacuity and despair
Inhaling a once limitless beauty

Left to drown within this incalculable void
This scorched epitaph, transcending the limitless dawn

We stand transfixed in odious lamentation
An ocean of misery engulfs us

We are the endless
We are the end
We are the endless
We are the heirs
