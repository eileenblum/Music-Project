Confined within this desiccant husk
This godforsaken artefact of what once stood
A sutra of isolation and absence
We have become the thrall of famine and drought

The Earth that we once enslaved has fallen
Consumed by our own insatiable starvation

Our focus shifts
To ingest the weak and the inanimate
Those who cannot resist
We turn to our own fragile veins
Drinking deep the arterial libation
Dissecting the lesser among us

Spanning beyond this infinite horizon
Sustenance lies in deficit

Excise the feast locked within the flesh
Death of the weak to feed the strong
We are the scavengers of our own mortality

Isolation

Flocking like vultures to feed on our own skin
Where sustenance lies in deficit
We have become the thrall of absence
