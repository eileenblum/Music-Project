Lost inside these fractured circles of sleep
A dissonant and frail departure from this motionless void
This nebulous vacuity we called our home

An oracle of false hope is revealed to one among us
Before us he stands, weak at the knees
Preaching a hollow exhortation of forgiveness and paradise

In exchange for our repentance and divine exaltation
To the âAlpha and Omegaâ that left us to rot under this riven sky

That left us to succumb to the vile cessation that awaits us
We are given a second chance to turn to the Almighty One

To live forever in utopia
Entwined in our irrational gaze
This cursed gospel is unfurled
And we, the church
The unhearing progenies of human pestilence
Writhing in a mercurial hysteria
Arise as one body in rebellion

For this vitriolic sermon
You will die by our hands
Your words will catch in your throat as you hang
