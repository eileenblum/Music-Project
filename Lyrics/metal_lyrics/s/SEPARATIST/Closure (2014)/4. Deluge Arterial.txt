Terrifying visions coalesce before our eyes
Wraiths born from infernal sickness, consuming our flesh
We are disciples of insomnia and delusion

Our limitless thirst
Quenched only by this sanguine deluge
This arterial effusion spilled forth from beneath our frail skin

Saturated with disease and pestilence
Rationality, draped with hysteria
Turns to dust in our shaking hands
In harrowing seizures of lunacy we recoil

Convulsions of relapse into transcendent vehemence
Aversion to light and fear of the darkness engulf our minds

Plagued by nonexistence
Apparitions, hallucinations
Leading us down into a nauseating hostility
Inanimate we stand as shadows
As this sickness permeates our lifeless bodies

These motionless pillars of violence and obsession
These bodies are no longer our own

Whispers of vivid aberration
Spun forth through layers of wilting flesh and funereal despair
