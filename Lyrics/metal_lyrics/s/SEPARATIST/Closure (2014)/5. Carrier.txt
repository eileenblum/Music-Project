The emergence of an exquisite fallacy
Convulsing as it rises like smoke from the fire
From within our writhing multitude a new oracle is birthed
Drenched with delusion and desperation beyond measure
Ascending above our weary heads

A shattered discourse spewed forth from the lungs of divine
Prophecies of renewal and reconstruction

Born of undying delusion
Falling like rain upon our wretched ears
We stand debilitated beneath this endless torrent of divination

Stricken in a nauseating unison we follow like lambs to slaughter
Transfixed by every word
From the harrowing lips of delusion
Radiating like a plague of locusts
The carrier of our salvation, spewing forth a new doctrine
Lifting a wrenching threnody in worship to the endless sky

To deify the undying sky
A desperate sacrifice

From the harrowing lips of delusion
Radiating like a plague of locusts
In a tragic reverie of deliverance from this listless carrion we inhabit

Prayers for divine providence and redemption
Lifting from our desiccant tongues to the unhearing god of the skies
Our bodies, draped in famine and ash

Riddled with the unhealing scars of our thirst
Our inhuman futility raised in a vile offering
In our vain exertions of praise
We are worthless
