We have become one with this emptiness
The hollow image of limitless decay
Consumed with despair
Unfailing, unending hopelessness
Our desperate prayer and human sacrifice

Proved insufficient in the eyes of the silent sky
Hanging above our heads
Motionless, paralysed

Left in ruin on this empty shell
This husk, wretched and ethereal
In a soundless discord we stand desolate
This dead earth mourns beneath us

Trapped in this cursed isolation
Transfixing our lifeless souls
We will not survive

Our only hope for redemption lies in the cessation of man
The welkin hangs above our weary heads in endless silence
One final sacrifice to bring divine salvation

As the flames of this funeral pyre rise over our listless empty bodies
Our prayers, wracked with mortal despair, raised to the voiceless sky
Return to us unheard
