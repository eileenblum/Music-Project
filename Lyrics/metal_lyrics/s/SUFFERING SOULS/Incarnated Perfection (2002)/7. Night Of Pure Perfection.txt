Dream with me my crystal creature
Wings of sorrow, so far beyond

Approaching total chaos
All the tears you cry are a part of me
Blazing Skies - Endless nights
Suffer in purity, hiding in fantasy.

Painful pleasures in this nightly glam our
It spills the blood like rain
The moon turns blood red and demons reign
With strength and pride we burn.

For this night of Pure Perfection
Demons torn from spirit and angels torn apart
Walk my path mortal one
Now my Eden has a Queen.

Abstract design of brilliant light
Mythical- Magical broken
Spheres of atmospheric integrations
The paranoid disillusions mortify the flesh.

For this night of Pure Perfection
Demons torn from spirit and angels torn apart
Walk my path mortal one
Lust becomes the time of dawn.

Nocturnal hymns of blasphemy,
a dismal dream incarnate
This silence embrace my soul
Nocturnal mist believe my cry.

Welcome my demon bride, my eternal bleeding star
Welcome my crucified whore
Welcome to my palace of pain
Welcome to my night of perfection.
