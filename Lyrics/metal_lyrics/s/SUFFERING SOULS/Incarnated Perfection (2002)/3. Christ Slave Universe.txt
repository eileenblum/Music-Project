Into the midnight drama
I gaze into the flames
Hear the Screams
Of tormented pain.

The night is eternal
The night is black
As history turns the time
To create a century.

Eclipse is a terror world
To crucify my beloved
I turn back to where
I once unite the spirits.

I am wrapped in darkness
in my spirit world
From times in misery, I will come
When the heaven bleed eternal
The night of soulless chaos
A lightning rips the sky apart
Destroy the kingdom Christ.

Covered with the blood of angels
Covered with the silence of death
Through the heaven, red from blood
With pride my demons march.

Eclipse is a terror world
To crucify my beloved
Angel, slowly fade away
Dead by dawn, you shall be.

I am wrapped in darkness
In my spirit world
From times in misery, I will come
When the heavens bleed eternal
The night of soulless chaos
A lightning rips the sky apart
Destroy the kingdom Christ.

Covered with the blood of angels
Covered with the silence of death
Through the heaven, red from blood
With pride my demons march.

My legions are gathered
To crush the hordes of Christ.
War winds destroy the light
Under the banner of death we ride.

Damnation is our battlefield
I am pure destruction
Christ king shall fall
In his own blood
Heaven eternally burns
I am majesty, I am Antichrist
A war so fucking unholy.
