Feel the dead inside
Another object of my art
Lunatic dreams become monotony chaos
A masterpiece of dark delight
My soul forever, my faith to be
Glorification of Blasphemy
Diabolical son of hells creation
Gathered in black, massacre in red
Gathering days of destruction

Death is the beginning, life the end
Infiltrate dimension, hallucination
In the center of the universe
Through the gate, wrath of time.

Behind the light, across the silence
Broken by the spell, the darkest night arise
Domains of eternal night, like an angel of disillusion
Sterile and black air, so let me enter
Father of my soul, perform my own death.

Christ you bastard, fuck my new born soul

All the stars they shine for me
All the cryptic winds of death
My rebirth is heavens end
Born lifeless, world of souls

Uncreate- between dimensions of time, through the hell
Into my paradise of demonic incarnations
My soul is forever
I drink the spit the blood of Christ
Demons embrace me in my suffering paradise.
