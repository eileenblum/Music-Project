Into the sickening light
Into the heavenly fall
Soul of ice, parish at sleep
Covered with the sand of time.

Ashes to ashes
Taste of Death
Permanent Punishment
Is the awake

My Spirit lives eternal
Symbolical and Mystical

Apocalyptic Riders O see,
Surrounded by hate
The heaven will burn by apocalyptic fires.

Placed on the gates of hell
Waiting till the end has come.

Servility to my master
The One and Only King
Master of beautiful death
Master of painful visions.

Dark side endless pride
Behold the apocalypse.

Oh Satan hear my call
Let me be your servant
My heart pounds loud
Only for my majesty

We strike the earth
Set the legions free
Christian souls cry
My Tyrannous King.

Black flames burn
Mighty Hordes of Hate
Gather from Hell
In the name of Satan.

Oh Satan hear my call
Let me be your servant
My heart pounds loud
Only for my majesty.
