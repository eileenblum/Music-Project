Soulless empty minds, divide humankind
My heart is cold as a winters night

I am war, this is pain, forget your sorrow
I am the servant of suffering
I am the servant of death

Dying cunt, follow me on your final ride
I show you blood- In torment steeped.

My infernal supremacy
This sacrifice is for you
Sorrow and tears leave your life
The light does not shine for you.

Strangulated mortal body, tortured one
Fall into this demonstorm of torment, of hate and pain

Cold- In the phase of rigor mortise
Eyes- Staring empty through my flesh

Let me cut your rotten parts
Sophisticated torment
A blue eyed smiling corpse
For my king of hate and pain.

My infernal supremacy
This sacrifice is for you
Ornaments hacked in flesh
For the child of bastards son

My heart- cold as a winter night
Psychodrama is the symmetry of my soul.

Sophisticated torment
Sophisticated- So am I
