Legions from hell- a total eclipse
Frozen winds, I spread my wings
As darkness falls above
Midnight- An astral incarnation
Born to burn- Destructor within creator.

Transcending the rotten body
to reach a spiritual world
Through dimensions, cosmic veins
Black blood flow, for heavens fall
My whore of darkness
My whore- my innocent child
Feed my power &amp; my obsession
I am the lord of dark and evil spirits.

Legions From hell- A total eclipse
Frozen winds, I spread my wings
Empires fall by my cosmic wrath.

I rape the angels and drink the blood of Christ
I fuck the lambs of god
When the white hordes are slaughtered
I am the king of Hell.

My obsession with your destruction
Angel of wrath, lick my lips.

Dark Satanic Blasphemy
Beloved satanic witch
These moments are eternal
Under the moon before I die

Horrible screams break through the silence
I am not dead yet, but i am dying

I rape the angels and drink the blood of Christ
I fuck the lambs of god
When the white hordes are slaughtered
I will rise again.

Dark Satanic Blasphemy
Beloved satanic witch
I fuck the nuns and burn all priests
Blasphemy is my paradise.

Satanic dreams become dark reality
Blasphemic voices out of heaven
Scream, scream, scream my bleeding angel
Heaven will burn for me.

Dark Satanic Blasphemy
Beloved satanic witch
The funeral moon glows for us
The bleeding sky is ours.

Dark Satanic Blasphemy
Beloved satanic witch
We are united now
and the heaven is our hell.
