Moon falls behind the clouds
A  darkly splendid world
My queen of beauty, together we will walk
Through the time of dawn.

Penetrate the silence, where I rule
Spiritual revelations, embraced by mourners.

The void of a hellishly night
Reflect my endless pride
Cosmic forces still amaze me
By god, by the fallen.

A whisper, frozen in time
The eyes of the creatures
They burn with strength
My soul is poisoned from within.

The frozen stars i might reach
Obsessed by the power of the beast
Heartbeat- in absolute darkness
Reflected and began to transform

Mesmerized by the stars
I am the black where I began
The fire still burns in my soul
I scatter the ashes
For centuries-Unborn
Black clouds fill the sky
I am freezing, I am free

The frozen stars i might reach
Obsessed by the power of the beasts
Heartbeat-In absolute darkness
Reflected and began to transform

A Whisper, frozen in time
The eyes of the creatures
They burn with strength
My soul is a freezing blackness

Now some centuries later
I lay in my freezing sleep
