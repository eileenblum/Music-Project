Way into dark
For young dying soul
In your desire was to fly alone
Believe in a better life
You will learn lesson of your pride

Possession of material cover
Is your mistake of truly fevered mind
There will be pain. There won't be former power
And spirit's going to be deaf and blind

And you will ask for hope you will apologise
And at the end you will surrender
I want to be a man so powerful and wise
I know you'll understand me

You'll see life of the pariah
Go! Gate's open. It's your desire
Fly to the world penetrated by evil
Human life now is a foul river

Becoming older you'll forget thy essence
You'll lose all memories you've ever had
And to recall it you'll need witcher's lessons
We'll drone you by the whisper in thy head

And you will ask for hope you will apologise
And at the end you will surrender
I want to be a man so powerful and wise
I know you'll understand me!
