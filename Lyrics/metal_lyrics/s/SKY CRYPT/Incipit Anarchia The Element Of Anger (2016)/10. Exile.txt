World shed the blood to be safe
From the proud tyrant rise
All its force are in grave,
Made by storm of the dust

Rage has gone flown to sky
You can see only dirt
No more death, no more cries,
No more storm of the war

Built of remains, ashes and dust
New law of life, new worthy way
It cannot rot, it cannot rust
Strong we become passed over

Bloody hell. It cursed by Gods leading
All the men to ending in grave
For the souls, for every thy feeling
Fight with time to grow your own fame

Hide all the fear let it go
Find the light in thy heart
All the worst things you've done
Buried far, thrown apart

Built of remains, ashes and dust
New law of life, new worthy way
It cannot rot, it cannot rust
Strong we become passed over

Bloody hell. It cursed by Gods leading
All the men to ending in grave
For the souls, for every thy feeling
Fight with time to grow your own fame

Firestorm can come again if thy
Mind forget the time of shadows
Only will deserves to rule your life
Order's fall. Let make the chaos rise!
