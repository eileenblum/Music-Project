Dust, ashes and gravesâ¦
You cannot run from their unfair demands
Whom enemy prays?
It needs the blood. It eats the flesh by the flames

War, death, blood,
Fire and void,
Black storm cloudâ¦
You'll be destroyed!

Smoke lies on the ground, waits for the fight
Or is it enemy's mist?
Run out of the bounds, out of the sight
Choose evil could be the least

War's rising but you are farâ¦
Far from the blood and flames
Think and look at the stars
One day you'll see the ways

War, death, blood,
Fire and void,
Black storm cloudâ¦
You'll be destroyed!

War's rising but you are farâ¦
Far from the swords and flames
Think and look at the stars
One day they'll grant you grace
