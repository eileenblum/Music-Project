Drone of evil's drawing near
Swelling sound to suggest terror
World's awaking from the dream
Soon you'll see dawn of new era

Fear storm's dark, lightning
Grow thy might, strike fiend

Where is the sunlight? Brave is disappearing
And sign of weakness fire reveals
That storm ain't over till the fiend's living
In the heart of people trying to resist

Stay while fire's burning
Strengthened by wind
Perceive thy essence story

Idols falling on the ground
Changing man into weak prayer
Gods are killing growling loud
You shall know they are not fair

Thy bad blood's flowing
From pierced heart slowly

Where is the sunlight? Brave is disappearing
And sign of weakness fire reveals
That storm ain't over till the fiend's living
In the heart of people trying to resist

Flame inspires madness, grows the devastation
Warriors are falling losing their faith
Only those who're clear are worthy of salvation
Others deserve death!
