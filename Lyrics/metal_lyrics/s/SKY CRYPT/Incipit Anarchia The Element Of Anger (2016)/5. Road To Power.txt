Fear and worship God of war
Bathing hands in man blood
Be afraid of heavy storm
It devours their lives

Were your people resisting the rage
Or they were broken down by the fiend?
Some are prisoners rotting in cage
Many are dead

Sky can show the way
While the star's shining
Gods don't hear empty prayer
Get your own finding

Kill the strongest, fight with brave,
Use the silence power
Send thy Fiend to the grave
Don't indulge in sorrow

Sky can show the way
While the star's shining
Gods don't hear empty prayer
Get your own finding

Find the rest in the old witcher's hut
At the end of the world in a silence
There won't be any doubts in thy heart
Quiet all riots
