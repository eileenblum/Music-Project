You must hear the prophecy
From envoys of Universe
We'll say words without grief and sadness
Hark! There's something we could see
In thy future that is cursed
You shall pay the price for empty madness

You'll hear the cry of burning sky
It will be when you die
And all thy deeds now are just memories in flames
Which burn on world remains

See their rotten dying souls
In the bodies of alive
You can't save that world from ugly tyrants
They may live, destroy the walls
By a heavy nature strike
But again they'll sink in rage and violence

You'll hear the cry of burning sky
It will be when you die
And all thy deeds now are just memories in flames
Which burn on world remains

You can't inspire me with fear
And prophecy is just a kind of dream
I don't believe you ghostly seer
My way is strong I won't give in
