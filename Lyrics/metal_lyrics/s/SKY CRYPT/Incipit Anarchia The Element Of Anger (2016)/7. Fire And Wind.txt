Some time you saw black winter day
Home seized by fire and smoke in your heaven
Forces of fiend are far away,
Nature has come. Their volition is deadened

Element warriors fire and wind
Ruin intensions, shatter the will
Worship mysterious essence

Feel mighty darkness of heavy storm!
Listen to thunder, sense you the worm!
Nothing will show your presence!

Nature and war takes every life
Meeting the soul burning down till the ashes
All that remains as sharpened knife
Slice off the rot. Fiend's frightened and crashed

Element warriors fire and wind
Ruin intensions, shatter the will
Worship mysterious essence

Feel mighty darkness of heavy storm!
Listen to thunder, sense you the worm!
Nothing will show your presence!
