Fascinating moon leaving home lighting up the world
Was obeying to dirty sun and the dazzle cold
Play illusive time and destroy every spending life
Death will come for you and again split the soul above

Lie for the safety they will spell to thy mind
War, cries and shambles leaving on other side
Look! They are killing every thoughts to salvage
Lying again, leaving thy mind in cage

Raise perseverance! Evil's roaming near
Try to understand your ignorance. Death suggests the fear
Every single life thy dying trial's gathering in soul
Let them spread the lie while frail walls striving for the fall

Lie for the safety they will spell to thy mind
War, cries and shambles leaving on other side
Look! They are killing every thoughts to salvage
Lying again, leaving thy mind in empty cage
