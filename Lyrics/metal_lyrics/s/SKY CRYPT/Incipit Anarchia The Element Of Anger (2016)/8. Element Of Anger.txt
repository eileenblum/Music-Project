You saw the fire, you felt the wind
You know the weakness of bloody fiend
Destroy all lies by stone cold and dormant power of mind
The anger's coming with blackened clouds
In flame from depths of exhausted ground
They will remember scene of decaying ashes of life

Light - to raise the guiltless soul
Up in a heaven's rest
Until the ending rule of evil
Dark - to blind before the fall
Into the Devil's nest
For fiend's mind up to the healing

Feel element of anger!
Hide valour obey dark storm!
Thy efforts are vain here!
Light's burning the stone!

Where is the courage of fiend's force?
They're running out from nature curse
Unseeing eyes are opened harking to terror of war

Light - to raise the guiltless soul
Up in a heaven's rest
Until the ending rule of evil
Dark - to blind before the fall
Into the Devil's nest
For fiend's mind up to the healing

Feel element of anger!
Hide valour obey dark storm!
Thy efforts are vain here!
Light's burning the stone!

Never live being tyrant's slayer!
Let your mind be the light in a dark!
Take doubts away, don't be a helpless prayer
Thy artful death is not so far

Feel element of anger!
Hide valour obey dark storm!
Thy efforts are vain here!
I'm evil you've sworn!
