[lyrics: Ivan Franko]

Who dared to say that Thou art not a Goddess?
Where is the monster who was not entranced,
Who did not gaze upon Thee, rapt and wordless,
His heart unmoved by beauty's radiance?
Thou art the Queen of Heaven. I implore,
Look down upon me from Thine kingdom high!
I used to think that empty was the sky,
But Thee, oh Rose of Eden, I adore!
In gods and spirits men are free to doubt,
And tales of paradise and hell my flout.
But Thou art in our hearts, not tales, enthroned,
And come a day, the whole world will forget
All gods and spirits, and will genuflect
Before. Thy painted image, Thee alone!
