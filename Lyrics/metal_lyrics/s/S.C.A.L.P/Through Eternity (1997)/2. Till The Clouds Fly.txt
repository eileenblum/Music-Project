[lyrics: Alexey Kuznetsov]

Floating across the sky cloud
Hurrying by light wind
Flying far from the old lakes
Where was born their air life
Long flight too high
Excused from all the cares
Round is only sunlight
And the whistle of free wind
They're looking at green scopes
Of endless dark forests
They're reflecting in mirror waters
Of the virginly clean rivers...
So as the cloud fly
The sun will be shining
So till the cloud fly
The day will replace the night
And my eyes will see the sky
The tunes of my dreams will play
And only the bliss will reign everywhere
If only the clouds float
I'm lying on wet grass
I'm looking at blue sky
I'm seeing the floating clouds
And I'm dreaming to be them
I closed my eyes
I'm trying to fancy
My soul in way
To blissly land of Heaven
And I'm speaking with the clouds
And the clouds wrap me up
And I'm singing the sky song
And the clouds sing together with me
