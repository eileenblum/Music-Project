[lyrics: Fyodor Tyutchev]

Seal thou thy lips, to none impart
The thoughts and dreams that fill thy heart.
There they'll flare up, there sink and die
As do the stars up in the sky
When o'er the Earth night's shadows creep...
Take joy in them - and silent keep.
No secret of thy soul begot
With others canst thou share, for what
Are thoughts, once voiced, but common lies.
Churn up a stream, and silt will rise
And darken it... Drink, drink thou deep
Of waters clear - and silent keep
Live in the world of self - thy soul
Contains of magic thought a whole
Bright universe... The noise of day
Doth threaten it, and light... Essay
To banish these; if joy thou'd reap
Hear thy heart's song - and silent keep
