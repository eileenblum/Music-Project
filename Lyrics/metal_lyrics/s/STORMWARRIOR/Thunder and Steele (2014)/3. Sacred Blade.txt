Hallowed in the fires of the gods
We are the chosen warriors

Thunder is rising in my bloode
Sounds of war are blown afar

And still we praise the raging metal age ...

Ancient steele, blazing fyre
Feel the sacred blade
The iron gods ligh up the dark
Ancient steele, sons of fyre
Feel the sacred blade
And i bear a pounding metal heart ...

Tunes of the past still guide my way
Chorales of yore, the life in my veins

The masters call and still we praise the raging metal age ...

Ancient steele, blazing fyre
Feel the sacred blade
The iron gods ligh up the dark
Ancient steele, sons of fyre
Feel the sacred blade
And i bear a pounding metal heart ...

And still we praise the raging metal age ...

Ancient steele, blazing fyre
Feel the sacred blade
The iron gods ligh up the dark
Ancient steele, sons of fyre
Feel the sacred blade
And i bear a pounding metal heart ...

Ancient steele, blazing fyre
The iron gods ligh up the dark
Ancient steele, sons of fyre
And i bear a pounding metal heart ...

Ancient steele, sacred warrior, sons of fyre ...
