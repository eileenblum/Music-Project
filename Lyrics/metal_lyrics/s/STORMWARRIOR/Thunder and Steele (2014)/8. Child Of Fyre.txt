Standing in your way, never born to obey
I'm the pain inside your heart, I'm the one you need to hate
Rebellious and wild, still the unwanted child
A past too hard to bear, oh why am I still alive

Your lies made me fight, made me stronger every night
You could never ever break me
But I regard how much you tried
This life seemed to be war, from the day on I was born
Guess I need to stand in battle
And so I'm screaming for more

I don't believe you saw the light
And I'm not alone, see the warriors unite

Proud we will stand, together we'll fight
Children of fyre unite
Bound by the oath, foregather to strike
Until the last child of fyre will rise
Come and taste the flame...

Fearless and bold, the assembly is to hold
Never yield or kneel in combat, our victory is foretold
Exalted and grand, the rebellion is at hand
And if it's not inside your bloode
You will never understand...

I don't believe you saw the light
And I'm not alone, see the warriors unite

Proud we will stand, together we'll fight
Children of fyre unite
Bound by the oath, foregather to strike
Until the last child of fyre will rise
Come and taste the flame...

Proud we will stand, together we'll fight
Children of fyre unite
Bound by the oath, foregather to strike
Until the last child of fyre will rise
Proud we will stand, together we'll fight
Children of fyre unite
Bound by the oath, foregather to strike
Until the last child of fyre will rise
Will you taste the flame...
