Accursed and banished to death
A flaming blade in his hand
A prowling wolf on the run
Oh the metalized one

A thruster and servant of swords
The brave battle-deale of yore
He calls for the wild and the free
Oh the ravens to feed

And as a thunderstorm strikes the dark
I brandish the sacred sword
Feel the blade of revenge, bringer of war

I'm the metal avenger, enforcer of steele
The metal avenger, attacker of shields

Enhancer of warrior-rage
The outlaw is sealing their fate
A voice of bloode now will rise
The increaser of fight

And as a thunderstorm strikes the dark
I brandish the sacred sword
Feel the blade of revenge, bringer of war

I'm the metal avenger, enforcer of steele
The metal avenger, attacker of shields
