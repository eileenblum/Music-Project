Nighte is closing in, full moon will arise
Now thy rite begins, thy kinsmen side by side
Gathered at the glade, medieval tunes are played
Noble swords are raised, farewell at the olden way

Fires in the nighte - pyres are blazing bright
Fires in the nighte - (oh oh oh oh oh)
Fires in the nighte - the last farewell of thine
Fires in the nighte - (oh oh oh)

Chants of splendid tymes, breathing life into the dark
Mystic voices whine, they are calling from afar
Torches set aflame, the gates stand open wide
Waiting to embrace, the fallen ones tonight

Fires in the nighte - pyres are blazing bright
Fires in the nighte - (oh oh oh oh oh)
Fires in the nighte - the last farewell of thine
Fires in the nighte - (oh oh oh)
