Out of the twilight and into the fyre we ride
To find salvation
Purified power, bound to the hammer we rise
Metalize the nation

Iron and fyre, for metal they bleed
Iron and fyre, welcome the new breed

Ironborn, iron warrior
We will stand the fight
We will rise tonight out of the underground
We're ironborn

I'm the avenger and i came to conquer ye all
It's retaliation
Chastise the liars, a noble desire we own
Oh the metallization

Iron and fyre, for metal they bleed
Iron and fyre, welcome the new breed

Ironborn, iron warrior
We will stand the fight
We will rise tonight out of the underground

Ironborn, iron warrior
We will stand the fight
We will rise tonight out of the underground
We're ironborn

Faithful thou art, sincere and stable thy heart
Oh a true believers
Shameless, insane, impure and depraved
Oh he is the infamous deceiver

Iron and fyre, for metal they bleed
Iron and fyre, welcome the new breed

Ironborn, iron warrior
We will stand the fight
We will rise tonight out of the underground
Ironborn, iron warrior
We will stand the fight
We will rise tonight out of the underground
We're ironborn
