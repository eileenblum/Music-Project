I wear the gloves of metal, i fjght an iron war
I'm leather-clad in battle, i'm of the restless horde
I'm steel armored warfare, the underground ally
Oh here i am, thy nightmare, hail the cult of mine

Steelcrusader - i'm the creature of the dark
Steelcrusader - there's bravery in my heart
Steelcrusader - i am the last of a dying breed
Steelcrusader - and to no one i would ever kneel

I'm far away from home now, out on the prowl again
A true noble vision, to spread across the land
I come alive at nightmare, oh i'm a beast of prey
I am the fearless wild child, you shan't cross my way

Steelcrusader - i'm the creature of the dark
Steelcrusader - there's bravery in my heart
Steelcrusader - i am the last of a dying breed
Steelcrusader - and to no one i would ever kneel
