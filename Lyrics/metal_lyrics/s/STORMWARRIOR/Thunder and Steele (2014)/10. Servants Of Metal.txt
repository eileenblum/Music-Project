See our armies stand, together we defend
Unbreakable and strong, the shores where we belong
Now the time hath come, for us to carry on
The legacy of yore, can you hear the thunder roar

Into the fyre and into the storm
Out of steele we were born

Warrior - stand thy ground tonight
Warrior - raise our banners high
Warrior - hear my battle-cry, I am not afraid to die
Warrior - see thy brothers fight
Warrior - swear the oath tonight
Warrior - leave thy battle-cry, I am not afraid to die

We're servants of metal, servants of steele

Faithful unto death, I feel the ancient breath
Victories long gone, victories to come
I take the oath of bloode, I feed the flame of gods
The iron voices scream, and never shalt thou kneel

Into the fyre and into the storm
Out of steele we were born

Warrior - stand thy ground tonight
Warrior - raise our banners high
Warrior - hear my battle-cry, I am not afraid to die
Warrior - see thy brothers fight
Warrior - swear the oath tonight
Warrior - leave thy battle-cry, I am not afraid to die!

We will rise like a thunderstorm tonight
Smash their ground with pride
Hail the gods of war and raise the blazon high
We will fight together again, in union we stand
Vengeance will be on our side

Warrior - stand thy ground tonight
Warrior - raise our banners high
Warrior - hear my battle-cry, I am not afraid to die
Warrior - see thy brothers fight
Warrior - swear the oath tonight
Warrior - leave thy battle-cry, I am not afraid to die

We're
Servants of metal
Servants of steele
