Savage are the flames and noble is my path
The elder ravens fly, swords in our hands

Now hear the thunder call, oh branded in thy mind
Eternal are the spirits, the secret of our kind
I took the life out of the dying battle
Remember now the sound of crashing metals

Woe to thee, hel's baneful fellow
This flame of bloode is awaiting thy fall

Die by the hammer, die by the gods
Our wolven return, oh, and me at the fore
Die by the hammer, oh now they shall learn and
They shall regret ever invading the great olden northe

"Cattle die, kinsmen die, thyself (too) soon must die
fair fame of one who (hath) earned
one thing, i ween, (that) will never die"
The good name will live on, the glory of the dead
Great deeds, great battlelore, the wisdom of the past

Die by the hammer, die by the gods
Our wolven return, oh, and me at the fore
Die by the hammer, oh now they shall learn and
They shall regret ever invading the great olden northe

Proud we will stand, together we'll fight
Children of fyre unite
Bound by the oath, foregather to strike
Until the last child of fyre will rise
Come and taste the flame ...

Proud we will stand, together we'll fight
Children of fyre unite
Bound by the oath, foregather to strike
Until the last child of fyre will rise
Proud we will stand, together we'll fight
Children of fyre unite
Bound by the oath, foregather to strike
Until the last child of fyre will rise
Will you taste the flame ...
