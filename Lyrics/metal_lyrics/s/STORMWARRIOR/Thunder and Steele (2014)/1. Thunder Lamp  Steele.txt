The prayers of iron, barbaric ou steele
We break the chains tonight, our metal victory
Now rise the sword again, freedom, the cry in my bloode
I'm wielding the axe again, hear the call of the gods

Thunder &amp; steele - onward we ride
Thunder &amp; steele - together we fight
Thunder &amp; steele - the fyre's alive and we rise in the sign of
Thunder &amp; steele

Possessed by metal, spikes and leather we need
Defending the legacy, oh the great sons of steele
Hail to the thunderer, raise your fist to the sky
Oh pledge allegiance now, hail the gods up high

Thunder &amp; steele - onward we ride
Thunder &amp; steele - together we fight
Thunder &amp; steele - the fyre's alive and we rise ... oh oh oh
Thunder &amp; steele - onward we ride, together we strike
The fyre's alive and we rise in the sign of Thunder &amp; steele
