Tears of a sword now to bleed
We're striding atween ice and fire
Now that we call on thee, to rule the eternal fight
Sharpen the blade of the gods, raise a metalized row
Drown the rivals in bloode
Our triumph hath been foretold

And here we stand, swear the oath of vengeance
And here we defend our noble steele

And still we fight, and our swords still bite
Hear our battle-cry
One will fall tonight and one will survive
And our legions rise, let the foeman die
One will fall tonight and one will survive

The ale of the ravens to shed, fists of iron fly high
A rain of spears lies ahead, storms of metal arise
Doom of man, the fyre of bloode, a carrion-sea
Chant of weapons, congress of Oden, the ember of shields

And here we stand, swear the oath of vengeance
And here we defend our noble steele

And still we fight, and our swords still bite
Hear our battle-cry
One will fall tonight and one will survive
And our legions rise, let the foeman die
One will fall tonight and one will survive

And here we stand, swear the oath of vengeance
And here we defend our noble steele

And still we fight, and our swords still bite
Hear our battle-cry
One will fall tonight and one will survive
And our legions rise, let the foeman die
One will fall tonight and one will survive

And still we fight, and our swords still bite
One will fall tonight and one will survive
Hear our battle-cry, and our legions rise
One will fall tonight and one will survive

One will fall tonight and one will survive...
