[Ramcke, Reshoft]

Fivehundred gates and forty eke
Open the brighte golden halle
In Gladsheim where the one-eyed god
Welcomes the fallen ones

Only the bravest of all warriors
Shalle be selected by the valkyries

Valhalla
Glorious halle up highe
Home of the brave, open thy gates
Fearless we'll fighte
Valhalla

Spears tower highe on the roof
Shieldes brighten the walls
A wolfe hangs before the gateway
An eagle hovers above
Eighthundred Einheries will at once
Go from each gate
When the Fenriswolfe hath
To be foughte on the final day

Halfe of the fallen are chosen on fighte
Withe the Aesir at the twilighte of the gods

Valhalla
Glorious halle up highe
Home of the brave, open thy gates
Fearless we'll fighte
Valhalla
Glorious golden halle up highe
Halle of the brave, open thy gates
We fear not to die
Valhalla

[Solo: Both/Lars/Both]

Only the bravest of all warriors
Will fighte at the twilighte of the gods

Valhalla
Glorious halle up highe
Home of the brave, open thy gates
Fearless we'll fighte
Valhalla
Glorious golden halle up highe
Halle of the brave, open thy gates
We fear not to die
Valhalla
