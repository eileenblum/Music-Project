[Ramcke, Reshoft]

Thaw hath begun, worship the sun
The giants of ice leave the lande
The scent of the sea, the dashing of the waves
The winde hath broughte to the strande

Put to the sea the dragonships now shall be
Hoist up the sails
The kit is taken aboard
Ready to get throughe the gales

Man the boats, leave the shore far behinde
Raids lie aheade, wealth we shalle finde

Crossing the seas, riding the storms
Onward to loot foreign shores
On the wide open sea far away from home
We're storming across foreign shores

Beneath the star of the northern lande
A son of Odinn was borne
One-eyed father is my guide
For I passed the rite of the Ancient One
I followe the cult like my father did
My first course lies aheade
Now my sworde shalle prove
Whose descendant I am
The foeman's bloode will be shed

Fearless I'm on board
Leave the shore far behinde
Raids lie aheade, wealth  I shalle finde

Crossing the seas, riding the storms
Onward to loot foreign shores
On the wide open sea far away from home
We're storming across foreign shores

Behold the horizon, an island is in sighte
We're heading for the shore
Get ready to fighte
Arms are handed over the bloodthirsty horde
Hails shalle be called out
Onward to loot the foreign shore

[Solo: Dave]

Fearless I'm on board
Now leave the shore behinde
Raids lie aheade, wealth  we shalle finde

Crossing the seas, riding the storms
Onward to loot foreign shores
On the wide open sea far away from home
We're storming across foreign shores
