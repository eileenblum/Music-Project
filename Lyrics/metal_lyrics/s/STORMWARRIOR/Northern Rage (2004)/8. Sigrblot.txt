[Ramcke]

Three moons have passed
Since the midwinter's nighte
Summer is awaited, the time of lighte
Honour shalle be paid to thee
All father, bringer of Victory

The priest opens the sacrifice
To stregthen thee a horse is victimized
Bloode is shed upon thy sons
Binding us to the one-eyed god

Odinn, take this offering from us
Be our guidance in war
Let us not returne without victory

Above the fire, the sacrificed meat
A feaste is helde in troth of thee
Hails are called out, horns are raised
For powere thou shalt be praised

Lead thy followers into a life of pride

Odinn, take this offering from us
Be our guidance in war
Let us not returne without victory
Rather we'll die

[Solo: Lars/Both]

Greate deeds await us at foreign shores
Battlewolfe, lend thy spear to us
Greate father of war, accept our offeringe
Sende thy ravens as a signe, lead us into victory
And thy sons shalle returne in pride...

Odinn, take this offering from us
Be our guidance in war
Let us not returne without victory
Odinn, lend thy spear to us
Greate father of war
Let us not returne without victory
Rather we'll die
