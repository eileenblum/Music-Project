[Ramcke]

Thine twelventh winter hath gone
Thy time of manhoode hath come
Learne how to fighte

Embraced by Helm Bearer's host
Thy consecration to holde
Now wait for the nighte
(Get ready to fighte)

Marked by the spear and hanged thou shalt be
The secrets of the Highe One to see

Welcome thy rite
Embrace the cult of the Ancient One
Offer thyself and wise thou'll become
Welcome thy rite

Now thy rite lies aheade (Tonighte)
Thy vivid bloode will be shed
Fear not the blade

Pain and wrathe thou shalt feele
Ecstatic rage to reveale
Enter this state (Fear not the blade)

Careful they've been the secret to keepe
Helm Bearer's son thou shalt be

Welcome thy rite
Embrace the cult of the Ancient One
Offer thyself and wise thou'll become
Welcome thy rite

[Solo: Kai Hansen]

Marked by the spear and hanged thou shalt be
The secrets of the Highe One to see

Welcome thy rite
Embrace the cult of the Ancient One
Offer thyself and wise thou'll become
Welcome thy rite

Welcome thy rite
Welcome thy rite
