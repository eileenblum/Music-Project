[Ramcke, Reshoft]

Nighte hath gone
The lighte of dawne fills the lande
Warhordes appeare on the filde
The pounding of feete hammereth the grounde
Swords are struck on their shieldes

A spear is throwne into the foeman's horde
Sacrificing them all
May Odinnn fulfill our course
My son, hear my calle

If I'll die wounded by steele
Thy heir shalle be named after me

Faithfull I'll die like many before
When Odinn awaits me up highe
(Heroic Deathe)
I have foughte and yielde I did not
Steele ends a warrior-life
(Heroic Deathe)

The battle is raging
And father is struck by a sworde
Lying amidst gory leaves
I kneele at his side, I stare at his eyes
His final wordes I recieve
"Now my son, the time hath come
My laste breath I shalle take
Thy father end his life
And yonder he shalle awake"

My son, now I die but my name shalle live on
When a tree of fighte to thee hath been borne

Faithfull I'll die like many before
When Odinn awaits me up highe
(Heroic Deathe)
I have foughte and yielde I did not
Steele ends a warrior-life
(Heroic Deathe)

Now I die withe pride in my hearte
I've seen my son become a man
Fearless I stood, yielde I did not
The golden halle shalle await me
(Heroic Deathe)

[Kai:]
Across the fielde the valkyries ride
Carried up highe, the fallen one
Were Bifrost ends
Valhalla's gates shalle embrace
The northern son
