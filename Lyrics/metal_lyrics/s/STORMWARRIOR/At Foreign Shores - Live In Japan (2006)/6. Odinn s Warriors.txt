Dark, black as the nighte
The enemies'fighte
Strong warriors with a chest full of pride
Wrathe to be revealed in the foremost rank
Clad like bears they're marching
And they're resolute to fighte

Invulnerable to fire and iron
No sworde can bite me when I'm in battlerage

ï¿½ï¿½inn's Warriors
Fearless and proud we shalle strike
ï¿½ï¿½inn's Warriors
In victory we returne from the fighte

The spells are cast
Ferocious hides are clad
The bear's savage powere
Now runs throughe my veins
The foes are stormed
A spear is striking my arm
And I throwe it back without vestige of pain

Invulnerable to fire and iron
No sworde can bite me when I'm in battlerage

ï¿½ï¿½inn's Warriors
Fearless and proud we shalle strike
ï¿½ï¿½inn's Warriors
In victory we returne from the fighte

[Solo]

I'm invulnerable to fire and iron
No sworde can bite me when I'm in battlerage

ï¿½ï¿½inn's Warriors
Fearless and proud we shalle strike
ï¿½ï¿½inn's Warriors
In victory we returne from the fighte
