Pounding hooves of the buck-yoke's ride
A carriage rolls in the skye
Stormeclouds, barbaric winds
In the fieldes up highe
The mighty hammer leaveth its pride
Deepe inside this hearte of mine
Son of the wise sende strengthe to me
The roars of the storme will set me free

Glorious wargod, let the thunder roar
Son of Odin, thou stronge immortal god

Thor, Thunderer - The eternal oathe I swaer
Thor, Thunderer - A vow of worshipness to thee

Feele the will of this horde
Thunderer, be with us
Let Mjolnir strike across this lande
Let us see thine raging hande
Receive our hails and sende a signe
Guide this fighte we're not afraid to die
This hallow'd sworde I raise to thee
Lead thy sons into victory

[Bridge]

Thor, Thunderer - The eternal oathe I swear
Thor, Thunderer - A vow of worshipness to thee
Thor, Thunderer - Thou brave and honest god
Thor, Thunderer - In throth I kneele to thee

[Solo]

Hail Thor, the Thunderer

Feele the wrathe of the ancient northe arise
In this realm once fill'd withe pride
The hammer returneth pounding the skye
Faithful I stande, faithful I'll die
I won't surrender in this fighte
To the thunderous one I swear the oathe
This war is not foughte alone

[Bridge]

Thor, Thunderer - The eternal oathe I swear
Thor, Thunderer - A vow of worshipness to thee
Thor, Thunderer - Thou brave and honest god
Thor, Thunderer - In throth I kneele to thee

Hail Thor, the Thunderer
