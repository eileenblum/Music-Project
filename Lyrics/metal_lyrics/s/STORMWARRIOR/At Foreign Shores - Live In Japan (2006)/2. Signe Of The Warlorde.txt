Thunder roars, lightning strikes
A clash of steele shakes the grounde
Warcries, hordes collide
The raging battle, a mighty and glorious sounde

Deatheblows, fatal defiance
Free our clans form the siege
Fighte for the stronge alliance
Defende the ancient belife

Rise, stande the tyranny, pledge allegiance to this war
...beware the returne of our gods

In the signe of the warlorde we will ride
Delivering the faithe in honoure and pride
Hail to Odin, the farher of gods
Glory to thee, in the signe of the warlorde

Eyes of wrathe, heartes of vengeance
Descendants of the forefather's age
Marche for deliverance
Assailing withe furios rage

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

In the signe of the warlorde we will ride
Delivering the faithe in honoure and pride
Hail to Odin, the farher of gods
Glory to thee, in the signe of the warlorde
