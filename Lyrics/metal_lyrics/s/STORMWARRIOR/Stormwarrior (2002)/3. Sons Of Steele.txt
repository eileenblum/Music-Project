Back in the fieldes, the banner on our shieldes
We marche into the war
We stande our rights to claime
Unbreakabkle, we'll never falle
Fighte for survival
Fighte for the legacy of the fallen ones
Carry on the faithe of the elders
Never yielde and never crawle

We believe in the mighte
The powere of Metal tonighte
Brothers, stande up and fighte
Fighte for the fire of our lives

We're Sons of Steele

Keepe the fire burning
Swear the oathe, hail the Metalgods
Never forget what you foughte for in the paste
Bonded by faithe and religion
Studs and Leather and a strong beliefe
Revive the storme of the fathers
Defende the spirite oute in the fieldes

[Brigde]
[Chorus]

[Solo: Lars/both/Lars/both/both]

[Bridge]

We're Sons of Steele
