A longe time ago when we were borne
The gods had return'd in the nighte
They built up a fire of thunder and nighte
And raised their swordes to the skye
They swore to create proud warriors
Defending their kyngdome of steele
Metalians were borne to fighte for their realm
Saving the faithe we all feele

And more than hundred thousand warriors
Armed with leather, chains and spikes
An army of brave men standes to strike
Proude and stronge

Defenders of Metal

The winde of the false ones invaded our landes
Trying to burne our faithe
The enemy tries to break our backs
They rape our steele and betraye

No brotherbeliefe, no steele in the veins
Borne to kneele and die
The time hath come to burne in hell
Metal is stronger than lies

And more than hundred thousande warriors
Armed with leather, chains and spikes
An army of brave men stands to strike
Proude and stronge

Defenders of Metal

[Solo: Lars/both/both/Lars/both/both/both/Scott]

And more than hundred thousande warriors
Armed with leather, chains and spikes
An army of brave men stands to strike
Proude and stronge

Defenders of Metal
Never surrender
Defenders of Metal
Fighte for their realm
