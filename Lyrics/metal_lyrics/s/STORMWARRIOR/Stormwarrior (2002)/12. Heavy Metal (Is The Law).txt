[Digi Pack Bonustrack]

[-Lars :]
Fight hard
Live fast
[-Kai :]
Play loud
Step out of the crowd
[-Lars :]
Iron Rulin'
[-Kai :]
Steel bent
Foreber the faith will live on in our hearts

[-Lars :]
There's nothing else in all the world that will
[-Both :]
bring it down
[-Kai :]
We will play our wildest step
[-Both :]
to all around
We need it as a liquid in our veins
instead of blood

[-Lars :]
Power
Burnin'
[-Kai :]
Brains Out
United metallians are ready to strike
[-Lars :]
White heat
Red hot
[-Kai :]
Mayhem
If it's not in your blood you won't understand

[-Kai :]
There's nothing else in all the world that will
[-Both :]
bring it down
[-Lars :]
We will play our wildest step
[-Both :]
to all around
We need it as a liquid in our veins
instead of blood

Heavy Metal is the law that
keeps us all united free
A law that shatters earth and hell
Heavy Metal can't be beaten
by any dynasty
We're all wizards fightin'
with our spell

[Solo Lars/Both]

[Chorus]
