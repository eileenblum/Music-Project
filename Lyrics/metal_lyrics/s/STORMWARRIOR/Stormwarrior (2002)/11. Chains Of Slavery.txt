Trod as slaves by the tyrant canes
Laid in chains, scars and bloode
All the years I've suffered in paine

Forced by the guards to serve their lordes
Pride they can't afforde
Trapped in hell, the master's hande
Signes of justice, broken men

Fighte, stande proude, gather to strike
Rebellion of slaves, ye shall arise
Freedom in thy eyes, a hearte fill'd withe pride
We're breaking the chains of slavery
The tyrant falles tonighte

I won't cringe to the false
I hear the cries of my brothers
Heede the call of the fighte
Won't kneele again, rather die

[Solo: Kai]

Fighte, stande proude, gather to strike
Rebellion of slaves, ye shall arise
Freedom in thy eyes, a hearte fill'd with pride
We're breaking the chains of slavery
The tyrant falles tonighte

[Solo: Lars/both/Scott]

[Kai:]
Freedom, the cry in my bloode
I hear the calle of my gods
Brothers oute in the fieldes
Remember the whips that forced us to kneele
Raise your fists to the skye
Hail the gods up high
Swear the oathe of revenge, free our clans
And break the chains forever

[Kai/Lars:]
Slavery's chains will be broken
The irons will falle, falle downe to the grounde
Overwhelming the guards, tearing their weapons
Face to face withe the lordes, the tyrants are founde
Raising the sworde, wielding the axe
Hammers in handes, hailing the gods for our freedom
The masters will die, thes chains will be burned
Freeing the brothers, vengeance shall be done

[Solo: both/both]

[Lars:]
I won't cringe to the false
I hear the cries of my brothers
Heede the calle of the fighte
Won't kneele again, rather die
[Kai&amp;Lars:]
None shall crosse our pathe
Our freedom shall laste
The warrior comes forthe
Quarter and tomente the lorde

Fighte, stande proude, gather to strike
Rebellion of slaves, ye shall arise
Freedom in thy eyes, a hearte fill'd with pride
We're breaking the chains of slavery
Fighte, stande proude, gather to strike
Rebellion of slaves, ye shall arise
Freedom in thy eyes, a hearte fill'd with pride
We're breaking the chains of slavery
The tyrant falls tonighte
