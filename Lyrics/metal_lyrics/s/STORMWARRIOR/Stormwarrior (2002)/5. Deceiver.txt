A masquerade, hiding the truthe
The weapons of glory, preparing to shoot
Wearing steele withe a false beliefe
Supporting the wronge, no hearte for the scene
Push for the golde, payment's the lawe
Sold the soule to the commercial war
Creating newe heroes, buying their fame
Deceiving the paste, the faithe will be slayed

They are riding withe the winde of the false ones
They are fighting the proude and the brave

Deceiver
Die by the fire
Deceiver
Burne at the stake
Deceiver
Fearing the true

Wielding the sworde forged in the paste
They're unable to fighte, unworthy to laste
Values are loste, no bloode formed of steele
A lifetime to falter, a lifetime to kneele
They followe corruption, they followe their lies
Deceit and betrayal, their unholy life
The oathe of allegiance they never have sworn
Their falsified heartes ruled by evil force

They are lying withe the face of the false ones
Fallen warriors are crying in their graves

[Chorus]
