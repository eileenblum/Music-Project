Thunderroars atone
The iron fists fly highe
Warcries are heard tonighte
Studs are catching lighte
The rebels assemble
The foe's bloode will be shed
The mutineers raise highe the flag
Rebellion lies aheade

The iron gods now return
The iron flames forever burn
We're protecting the eternal fyre

I fought the liars and their false machinery
A conspiracy of evil and their sell-out industries
The true force stands stronger than ever before
We rise out of the underground and spread the iron law

The iron gods now return
The iron flames forever burn
We're protecting the eternal fyre
The iron gods now return
The iron flames forever burn
Forever we're saving the fyre

[Solo]

The iron gods now return
The iron flames forever burn
We're protecting the eternal fyre
The iron gods now return
The iron flames forever burn
Forever we're saving the fyre

[Solo]

The iron gods now return
The iron flames forever burn
We're the saviours of eternal fyre
The iron gods now return
The iron flames forever burn
Forever we're saving the fyre
