Kiss the blade
Drinke the mead from skull
Unleashing the hordes
Of the Spearmaster's signe

We have answer'd the call
(answer'd the call)
We have heeded the signs
(heeded the signs)
Now thy bloode on my blade
(bloode on my blade)
Newborne mighte shalle arise

Free the four windes that blowe
Hear the warcry atone

Here we stande, swordes in hande
Freedom's signs we'll defende
Still we fighte, side by side
To the battle we ride

It was carv'd once in stone
By the elders foretolde
Wide will open the doors
For the brave and the bolde

Wolf, eagle and bear
Fill my foes withe despair

Here we stande, swordes in hande
Freedom's signs we'll defende
Still we fighte, side by side
To the battle we ride

[Solo]

Here we stande, swordes in hande
Freedom's signs we'll defende
Still we fighte, side by side
To the battle we ride

Into the battle we ride
To the battle we ride
Into the battle we ride...
