At distant shores lie threescore of dragonboats
Awaiting the breake of dawne
Tyr by my side, the ravens cry up highe
To smother The Cruciform

Oh, hear the bells, the lies are crawling near
Invading our heathen homes
One final stande, a hundred suns from home
In the name of the elder ones

Turn to face the vengeance for our poisoned landes
Thy final blessing by this pagan hande

Ravens calling, Brothers falling
For the glory of Asa lande
Kings were blinded, my people dying
In the greate plains of Asa lande

Swift as arrows, running withe the wolves we'll fighte
Oh Yggdrasil, I will sense your pain
From far beyond the valkyries chant my name
Oh, by the gods, my blade won't fail

Oh, show the cross men from blacksteele we were forged
Now meet thy maker by my father's sworde

Ravens calling, Brothers falling
For the glory of Asa lande
Kings were blinded, my people dying
In the greate plains of Asa lande

[Solo]

Lowe downe your flags, leade thy army off fielde
And beg forgiveness for a thousande years
of rape, murder and tyranny

Ravens calling, Brothers falling
For the glory of Asa lande
Kings were blinded, my people dying
It's the greate revenge of the Asa lande
