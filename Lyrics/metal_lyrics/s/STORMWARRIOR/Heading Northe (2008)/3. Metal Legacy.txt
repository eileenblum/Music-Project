Fists fly highe punching throughe the nighte
Oh the gods are on revenge
It's the tyrant's fall tonighte
Chain clash asounds, rivets sparkle brighte
Oh the denim hordes appear
Now the undergrounds unite

Raging Steele
Sacred rites
Warcries heard tonighte
Metal Warriors assemble to strike
Thunderstorms
Iron gods
Lightning strikes up highe
Iron legions have gathered tonighte
For the Metal Legacy

Pounding the world withe the blessing of the gods
We're the saviours of our past, the defenders of a cult
Swear the oathe tonighte, fulfill the gods commande
If it's not inside your bloode, thou wilt never understande

Raging Steele
Sacred rites
Warcries heard tonighte
Metal Warriors assemble to strike
Thunderstorms
Iron gods
Lightning strikes up highe
Iron legions have gathered tonighte
For the Metal Legacy

[Solo]

Raging Steele
Sacred rites
Warcries heard tonighte
Metal Warriors assemble to strike
Thunderstorms
Iron gods
Lightning strikes up highe
Iron legions have gathered tonighte
For the Metal Legacy
