Borne to roame in the lands of ice
Rais'd to plunder the foreign isles
The brotherhoode of the Anciente One
Surviv'd a thousande souls
We've seen the abyss, embrac'd the darke
No demon lords tear us apart
We've met their swordes and devour'd their heartes
Oh the foes were all dethron'd

Ironborne
Proven in fighte
Untamable kinde
Sons from up highe

Oh oh,
Warrior, greate warrior, son of Asa lande
Hear the voice of the elder ones, the fallen ones
Remember the oathe
Oh oh oh,
Warrior,greate warrior, son of heathen lande
Lighte the torches of elder thrones
Let the horns atone
Remember the oathe

Reade the bloodtracks oh in the snow
Blaze the traile to the days of yore
The ice shalle cracke withe a hammerblow
Know'st thou the elder home
Now sweare allegiance to the Wanderer
Finde the pathe to sacred lore
Thy will, Valfather is drawing near
And we claime the iron throne

Ironborne
Proven in fighte
Untamable kinde
Sons from up highe

Oh oh,
Warrior, greate warrior, son of Asa lande
Hear the voice of the elder ones, the fallen ones
Remember the oathe
Oh oh oh,
Warrior,greate warrior, son of heathen lande
Lighte the torches of elder thrones
Let the horns atone
Remember the oathe

Oh oh oh,

Lighte the torches of elder thrones
