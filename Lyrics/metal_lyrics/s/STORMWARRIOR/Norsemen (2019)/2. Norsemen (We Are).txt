Born a warrior, I live to fight
I shall make my sword sing a ballad of blood
Blood to blood! To the death!
We shall answer them
Sword to sword, blade to blade
We shall sacrifice them all

A beast will rise out of the northern sea
The mighty dragon prows will sharpen their teeth

Swords and fire will rise
Odin's oath in my eyes
I am not afraid to die
Norsemen we are

The true sound of steel
The crushing of shields
We son't settle for peace
Norsemen we are

Set the sails, shove the oars
The great battle horns of war are blown
We outnumber them
There shall be blood at their shore

I've been a warrior for all of my life
If I die today, I'll die a man of pride

Swords and fire will rise
Odin's oath in my eyes
I am not afraid to die
Norsemen we are

The true sound of steel
The crushing of shields
We son't settle for peace
Norsemen we are

Can you feel the fire
The summons of the brace
Can you hear the thunder
Death is on its way
Can you feel the fire
Cold, the ocean's spray
Can you bear the thunder
Each must die someday

Odin awaits me up high

We're wolves of the north
(We're wolves of the north)
Descendants of the gods
Fly the raven banner high
(Fly the raven banner high)
I'm not afraid to die
The true sound of steel
(The true sound of steel)
We won't settle for peace
Swords and fire will rise
(Swords and fire will rise)
Odin's oath in my eyes

Norsemen we are
