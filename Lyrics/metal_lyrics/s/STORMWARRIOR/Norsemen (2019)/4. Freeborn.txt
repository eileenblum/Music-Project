We were the kings here once, boy
We were kings of all these lands
And we'll be kings again
Our forefathers took this land once
And it's strengthened by their blood
Their blood and bone

No, I will not beg
I will fall, oh, to my knees
For no man, no king, no Christian priest

Freeborn we are
We're the swords of northern lands
Freeborn we are
Our birthright to defend
Freeborn we are
In the shield wall may I die
Freeborn we are
But they'll never take my pride
Freeborn we are

Today, a day for warriors
A day to kill our enemies
Fight to death!
They do not know our swords yet
And they do not know our pride
They will pay in blood

Oh, the swords are drawn
I will fall, oh, to my knees
For no man, no Christian god or priest

Freeborn we are
The true heirs of these lands
Freeborn we are
Our birthright to defend
Freeborn we are
In the shield wall may I die
Freeborn we are
But they'll never take my pride
Freeborn we are

Oh, the swords are drawn
I will fall, oh, to my knees
For no man, no Christian god or priest

Freeborn we are
We're the swords of northern lands
Freeborn we are
Our birthright to defend
Freeborn we are
In the shield wall may I die
Freeborn we are
But they'll never take my pride
Freeborn we are

Freeborn (freeborn)
