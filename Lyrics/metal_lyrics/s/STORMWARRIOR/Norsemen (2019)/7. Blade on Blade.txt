Oh, the way of our gods
The true path of Odin
A hammer heart, my trust in the gods
Men will, a song will remain

You betrayed your kind, betrayed our future
Your heritage, in the name of a savior
Betrayed your sons, on all the gods
We shall be revenged

Blade on blade
Pay the blood price of treachery
Blade on blade
Closed forever, the golden gates

O, your oath to Odin
Now set at defiance
You baptized soul of a foreign god
Once pure in spirit and heart

The gods are here, feel their presence
They're watching us, watching betrayal
They left their halls, they know thy truth
By honour we live we die

Blade on blade
Pay the blood price of treachery
Blade on blade
Closed forever, the golden gates

Blade on blade
Pay the blood price of treachery
Blade on blade
Closed forever, the golden gates

Blade on blade
Pay the blood price of treachery
Blade on blade
Closed forever, the golden gates

Blade on blade
Pay the blood price of treachery
Blade on blade
Closed forever, the golden gates

Blade on blade
