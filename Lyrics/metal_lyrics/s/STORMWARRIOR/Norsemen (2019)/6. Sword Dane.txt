It's the path of the sword
I can die only once
A lord of war I was born
Not a whore to your god

Battle-blood, first in line
You won't leave here alive
I shall take what is mine
And like a Dane I will fight

I am a son of the ancient north
A warrior of Odin's great hall
The heir to the land of gods
Destiny is all

I am the Sword Dane
And I will spill your Saxon blood
First light they'll hear your last battle cry

We have nothing to fear
But the lies of a priest
I owe nothing to thee
Blood revenge shall I seek

I am a son of the ancient north
I am the warrior of Odin's great hall
I won't forget what you did to us
In the name of your god

I am the Sword Dane
And I will spill your Saxon blood
First light you'll die your last battle cry
I am the Sword Dane
I live by the ancient gods of thunder, wind and rain
And great battle-fame

I am the Sword Dane
I live by the ancient gods of thunder, wind and rain
And great battle-fame
I am the Sword Dane
I am true to the ancient gods of thunder, wind and rain
And great battle-fame

I am the Sword Dane
Thunder, wind and rain and great battle-fame

Battle-fame

I am a son of the ancient north
A warrior of Odin's golden hall
