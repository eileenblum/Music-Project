Whether we live or die today
Our life is in the hands of the gods
So fear not, my friend, fight well
It must live on from father to son

Every day the battle-slain
Are chosen by All-father's hands
May they join Odin's horde
For RagnarÃ¶k they prepare

Here I stand, sword in hand
A warrior all of my life
Never touched by the blade
But all my friends they have died

I raise my sword to Valhalla
To all the fallen warriors
And I raise my sword to Valhalla
May they feast with the gods in the golden hall

Sailed with kings for many years
Fought in battle to land and to sea
I am a swordsman, proved many times
And proud my father would be

Oh, we fight, it's how we win
And how we die, it's the warrior way
I am who I am and I won't change
Not for you, nor for any of them

Valhalla awaits me up high...

I raise my sword to Valhalla
To all the fallen warriors
And I raise my sword to Valhalla
May they until the twilight of the gods

And bright shine the gates of Valhalla

I raise my sword to Valhalla
To all the fallen warriors
And I raise my sword to Valhalla
May they feast with the gods in the hall up high

And I, I am not afraid to die...

I shall enter Odin's hall
Where I'll await my sons to join
I'll share the stories of my sword
With all the greatest warriors...

Tales of triumph shall be told
At the table high among the gods
Across the rainbow bridge I'll go
Oh, may the Valkyries take me home...

Valhalla
Valhalla

Vast and bright thy halls (vast and bright thy halls)
Embrace the fallen one (embrace the fallen one)
In the golden hall (in the golden hall)
Welcome the northern son (welcome the northern son)

Valhalla
Valhalla
Valhalla
