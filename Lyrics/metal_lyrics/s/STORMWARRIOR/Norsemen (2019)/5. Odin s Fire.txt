All hail to the gods
All hail to the Aesir and Vanir
All hail to Frey, Tyr and Heimdall
To Vali and Sif
To Lin, Mimir and NjÃ¶rd
Loki and Frigg, Balder and Freya

Hail might Thor
Slayer of the frost and fire
Odin all-father
Ancient one

To the spear of the wise
Hail to the hammer of thunder
To the earth and sea
Blood and iron

I see warriors fight
Warriors die
Warriors enter Valhall

Odin's fire
Hammer and sword
Odin's fire
The storm of the north
Odin's fire
The return of our gods
All hail the northern son
Odin's fire

Now swear the oath on your ring
Shine in battle to bring
Men like us fear not death
We're always set on revenge
Blow the horns
We shall attack
Beat the drums there is no turning black
Take this sword
Impress the gods
And drink the mead from the skull

I see warriors fight
Warriors die
Warriors enter Valhall

Odin's fire
Hammer and sword
Odin's fire
The storm of the north
Odin's fire
The return of our gods
All hail the northern son
Odin's fire
There is pride in my heart
Odin's fire
Feel the wrath of the gods
Odin's fire
The northern way ancient laws
Hail the northern son
Odin's fire

[Solo]

I see warriors fight
Warriors die
Warriors leaving Valhall
Now it's twilight of the gods
The rise of the north
And eight hundred man will march of each door

Odin's fire
Live by hammer and sword
Odin's fire
It's the storm of the north
Odin's fire
The return of our gods
All hail the northern son
Odin's fire
There is pride in my heart
Odin's fire
Feel the wrath of the gods
Odin's fire
The northern way ancient laws
Hail the northern son
Odin's fire

Odin's fire
