There is beauty to the fight
There is passion in my heart
I'll always have revenge
This is who we are

First in line we stand
Keep the shield wall tight
Look them in the eye
I am never more alive

A chance to shine in battle-fame
Oh, sweet sound of victory

I live to fight within the shield wall
The place where warrior heroes die
Songs of the blade rise in the shield wall
And all my fame will come to life

Shield wall!

Swords on broken shields
Screams of agony
Hear the battle sound
I will stand my ground

This is to the end
And this will be our song
I fight with no regrets
And gain the golden hall

A chance to shine in battle-fame
Oh, sweet sound of victory

I live to fight within the shield wall
Oh, where warrior poets die
Songs of the blade rise in the shield wall
And all my fame will come to life

Shield wall!

A chance to shine in battle-fame
Oh, sweet sound of victory

Songs of the blade rise in the shield wall
The place where warrior heroes die
Swords do not lie within the shield wall
And all my fame will come to life

I pledged my life all to the shield wall
Oh, where warrior poets die
I gave my life all to the shield wall
All-father, hear my battle cry

Shield wall!
