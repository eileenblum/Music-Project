Swords and spears, one defining war
The pathway to glory belongs to us
The greatest raid in our history
The greatest army these shores have ever seen

Battle cries, no fear of death
Sharpened blades riding through the air
Attack their walls, storm their gates
Conquer their world, fight well today

We are the storm of the north
Descendants of the gods
To land and sea we belong
We are the storm of the north
The thunder of the gods
And our storm hath only just begun...

Wealth we'll find, wealth we shall take
Form our lines! Shields up and advance!

Take your sword, the flame of gods
They've never seen men who fight like us
The sign of blood, a great sacrifice
The gods revealed, now, out time to fight

We are the storm of the north
Descendants of the gods
To land and sea we belong
We are the storm of the north
The thunder of the gods
And our storm hath only just begun...

To land and sea, oh, both we belong
I will not fail when my battle cometh

Now we march, refuse not my sword
We are the storm, the storm of the north

We are the storm of the north
Descendants of the gods
To land and sea we belong
We are the storm of the north
The thunder of the gods
And our storm hath only just begun...

We are the storm
We are the storm

The storm
