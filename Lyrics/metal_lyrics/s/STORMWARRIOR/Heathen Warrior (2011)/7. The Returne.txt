Heede the chante of the foreste, I feele his breathe in the wistful wynde
"Threefolde-three nights on the tree...", I seek his gaze in the well of Wyrd

Don't query the signes, don't question thy sanity
But knowe what thou wielde, compassion or steele, you'll threefolde receive...

We will returne to the culte of the Anciente One
We have awaken the Lorde of the Slaine
We will returne to the culte of the One-ey'd One
And our queste hath only just begun... We will returne

They tamper'd with places of powere, Usurper's shrine in our sacred hills
Unbroken we stande like the will of the lande, oh beware thy reckoninge...

Oh followe the trothe, the weave of our destiny
But knowe what thou wielde, compassion or steele, you'll threefolde recieve...

We will returne to the culte of the Anciente One
We have awaken the Lorde of the Slaine
There will be a seconde cominge of the elder waye
And our queste hath only just begun... We will returne

"Once more we shalle awaken his voice
And knowe it more truly than e'er before
Conqure the worlde from inside thyselfe
And his whisper becometh a thunderinge roar"
Threefolde-three worldes of the tree
Three for the Norns weavinge thy Wyrd
Threefold-three nights on the tree
Knowe what thou wielde, you threefolde receive...

We will returne to the culte of the Anciente One
We have awaken the Lorde of the Slaine
We will returne to the culte of the One-ey'd One
And our queste hath only just begun... We will returne
