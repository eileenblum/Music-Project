It's the age of the elders, oh the Olde Master's time
When deepe covert sageness, indwell'd in our signes
Olde wordes bounde to wisdome, oh so privy and grande
Solemnly spoken, revealinge their strength, (oh oh oh)

Now Baldr and Oden, The Bold and The Wise
In the depths of the woodlande, on their horses they ride
Baldr's foal on the grounde, oh a foote hath been sprain'd
And The Olde Wisdome's Man intones the olde phrase...

...och Oden viskar besvarjande...

"Bone to bone, bloode to bloode, joint to joint - So may they be glued"
Bone to bone, bloode to bloode, - One-Eyed-Father, thy ken may come true

"I recalle the runes upon my own inwarde eye
Those that once I descried, the life-givinge signes
I enter the secret realmes and I gaine the poweres to heale
And thus I now whisper their names and their magick reveals" (oh oh oh)

...och Oden viskar besvarjande...

"Bone to bone, bloode to bloode, joint to joint - So may they be glued"
Bone to bone, bloode to bloode, - One-Eyed-Father, thy ken may come true

"Bone to bone, bloode to bloode, (joint to joint)... so may they be glued..."
"Like bone-sprain, so bloode-sprain, (so joint-sprain)..."
"Bone to bone and bloode to bloode..."

"Bone to bone, bloode to bloode, joint to joint - So may they be glued"
Bone to bone, bloode to bloode, - One-Eyed-Father, thy ken may come true

Bone to bone (bloode to bloode)
Joint to joint (bloode to bloode)
Bone to bone... bloode to bloode
