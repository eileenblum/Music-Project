Ride on oute, rally the fore
Grante us strengthe and vigoure to protecte our native shores
Fireborne, like the stars, the moone and sun
Give us thy endurance, spare my brethren from the crosse

As sworn brothers we strike, to die in his name is to live againe
Hel Blinder - Oh guide us with your mighte of...

Fyre &amp; Ice - The charge of battle-dealers
Bloode red skies - We honoure the Slain-Receiver
Fyre &amp; Ice - The calle of Olde Believers
Let arrows fly - The fighte of deathe or glory in Fyre &amp; Ice

Oh like a thunderbolte oute of the yawninge voide
We defy the frozen wasteland to defende our heathen soule
Stormy shieldes, oh never yielde
Ride downe the enemy, run them backe into the sea

As sworn brothers we strike, to die in his name is to live againe
Hel Blinder - Oh guide us with your mighte of...

Fyre &amp; Ice - The charge of battle-dealers
Bloode red skies - We honoure the Slain-Receiver
Fyre &amp; Ice - The calle of Olde Believers
Let arrows fly - The fighte of deathe or glory in Fyre &amp; Ice

As sworn brothers oh we strike againe
Hel Blinder - Oh guide us with your mighte of...

Fyre &amp; Ice - The charge of battle-dealers
Bloode red skies - We honoure the Slain-Receiver
Fyre &amp; Ice - The calle of Olde Believers
Let arrows fly - The fighte of deathe or glory in Fyre &amp; Ice
