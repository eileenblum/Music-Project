Oh splenderous lande of thundere, where elder wordes outliv'd the times
And northern wyndes still raise, this aulde pagan hearte of mine

So afar from home, I've sail'd acrosse all seven seas
Many a battle was won, many a foe's last breathe I've seen
But here's the place where once this northern son was borne
And here's the place where (oh) this hearte of pagan line belonges

I will fighte, I'm a Heathen Warrior
Noble fame on my minde
Hail me nowe, I'm a Heathen Warrior
Avow'd to leade an epic life
I'm a Heathen Warrior

Oh many suns did passe since I had left aulde Asa lande
Forefathers' waye, nowe outlaw'd by foreigne hands
And I heare the blathering of "There is but one god ..."
But nevere was I borne to kneele before a strange foreigne crosse

I will fighte, I'm a Heathen Warrior
Noble prowesse on my minde
Hail me nowe, I'm a Heathen Warrior
Avow'd to leade an epic life

Be thou hail'd, Heathen Warrior
Noble prowesse on thy minde
Unconquer'd swordsman, Northern Warrior
Bold and brave be thy fighte

Hail me nowe, I'm a Heathen Warrior
Pagan glory I shall strive
Thou art not conquer'd as longe as thy hearte is free
Bolde and brave be my fighte
I'm a Heathen Warrior
