Thunderinge hooves
Carry me to my destiny
Vultures of carrion (summon me)
Summon me to the battlefielde

Bones in the hills
The valley echoes my battle cry
I savour my fury (withe the mighte)
Withe the mighte of Habrok I'm soaringe highe

Tyr marks my spear, like Gungnir I sweare
My wrathe shalle fly true

We were torn and bereav'd, outlaw'd and renegaded
But the lande has stay'd untam'd
And the northern steele remaineth...

Hous'd in the runes
Fiery wyndes of my heritage
Oh wisdome of ages
Hallowe and holde this holy-stead

We've been hunted and scatter'd
Now stormes are foreboding an age of deluge
The elder faithe was unshatter'd, my wrath shall fly true

We were torn and bereav'd, outlaw'd and renegaded
But the lande has stay'd untam'd
And the northern steele remaineth...

We were torn and bereav'd, outlaw'd and renegaded
But the lande has stay'd untam'd
The hills still calle oute my name
And the northern steele remaineth...
