Things will change now that Iâve found my solace
Brutal lives show how easy we fade
Bed of nails is what I chose to lay on
The sort of choice you would not want to make
No remorse for all things that have happened
Easier just to blame someone else
Lived in fear of a life of seclusion
Always spent too much time by myself

LIES
Tell me lies
And bleed for me
HATE
Give me hate
And bleed for me

Now I hide from a world that forgot me
Lost between all my rage and my lies
A blank face a I peer into windows
Guess Iâm lucky, canât see the distain
Now I want to sleep
Forever in a dream

TELL ME LIES
And bleed for me
HATE
Give me hate
And bleed for me

Now Iâm by myself again
afraid to get back on my own two feet again
too tired to face life again
itâs hard
to reach inside
take a bite
then rip out disgust
through their eyes
thatâs drenched in
LIES
LIES
LIES
LIES
