Read between the lines of all the stories we are told as children:
with a mind so young we are naive, easy to mould.
Not a chance to think for yourself. Scooped up in and instant
when you still find things hard to process our lifeâs impressionable.
Show any sign of expression or individuality,
you will taken aside and be beaten down to size
Seems to my hypocrisy is how the world is run
and if thereâs something unexplainable we blame it all on god

Why canât we just learn to take responsibility for ourselves?

How can life be cheapened
for not choosing a religion?
Does it matter when we have no care at all?
Divided by decisions of a life changing illusion.
A heretic.
Well you can call me what you want.

Take almighty God as an example of a lie.
Who will take the blame for all his wrongs?
And still you call me âevilâ for not bowing and obeying,
When all I do is live just how I want.

How can life be cheapened
for not choosing a religion?
Does it matter if we will not bow or fall?
Divided by decisions of a life changing illusion.
A Satanist.
Well you can call me what you want.

Whatâs left?
No argument will change my mind.
Persistent.
Well can you show me proof of lies?
Abusive.
Why can you not respect my choice
I donât care what you believe.
Why donât we go our separate ways?

Respect how I choose to live âcause I donât regret the things Iâve done,
But you still try to force your way of life down my throat, why?

Donât you think itâs time we took our heads out of the clouds
And did some thinking for ourselves.
For the better I can see this world will change.

How can life be cheapened
for not choosing a religion?
Does it matter when we have no care at all?
Divided by decisions of a life changing illusion.
A humanist.
Well you can call me what you want.
How can life be cheapened
for not choosing a religion?
Does it matter if we will not bow or fall?
Divided by decisions of a life changing illusion.
A Satanist.
Well you can call me what you want.
