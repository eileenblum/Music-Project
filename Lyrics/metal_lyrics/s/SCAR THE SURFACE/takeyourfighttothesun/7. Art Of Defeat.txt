Itâs one thing just to hate your life
But you make every moment bitter
Why all the hate towards yourself?
In time all your scars can heal

Why live life with so much regret?
Self pity seldom ever works
You havenât even got your pride
Defeat is all youâll ever know

Why is it that you hate yourself?
Think no ones life is just as hard?
Time to wake up and see the world
So drag yourself from your hole

All we look forward to in life
You still find yourself alone
It takes effort just to smile
So defeat is all youâve known
But it takes effort just to HATE

By now you should have realised
Itâs you that drags things down so low
Why do you choose to make your existence soâ¦
PATHETIC
SO USELESS
YOUâRE HELPLESS
BUT YOU WONâT RISE ABOVE IT
DESTRUCTION
OF SELF
YOUR ENDING
YOUâVE STOPPED BELIVING
YOUâRE WEAK
A FAILURE
TO YOURSELF
YOUâRE JUST AFRAID
TO FACE FACTS
ABOUT TRUTH
THAT YOU ARE
A COWARD

All we look forward to in life
You still find yourself alone
It takes effort just to smile
So defeat is all youâve known
But it takes effort just to hate

Even at your weakest time
Never stop believing
Your division of soul and mind
Can be overcome in time
Pent up aggression
Itâs your spiral to self destruction
Donât let go of your memories
If you want to climb out of your chasm

To see what comes from the start
Of our own life
Regrets make us fall apart
To see what comes from the start
Of our own life
Regrets make us fall apart
Does your chance to be heard
Make no difference?
You will wallow in defeat
Thatâs all
You give up on yourself
