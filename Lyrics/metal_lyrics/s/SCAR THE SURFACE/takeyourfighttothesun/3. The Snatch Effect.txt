Iâve been to hell and back.
Iâve been drowning in my shit.
But then Iâve come back smelling of roses.
Iâve been spat at and slapped.
Iâve been punched in the head.
But I always bounce right back again.

Canât take my breath away from me.
I know it can be so deceiving.
And you!
Canât take me down so easily.
My life is one that is worth living.
Do you live a life of pain?

You put me down and laugh
To hide the hate you have.
But Iâm the one whoâs laughing
Because I see right through you lies

Canât take my breath away from me.
I know it can be so deceiving.
And you!
Canât take me down so easily.
My life is one that is worth living.
Do you live a life of pain?

You don't get it.
You're not ready.
Not gonna give you anything that you want.
I mean it, I'm not stupid.
It's a side of life you're not ready to take.
I said it, it won't happen.
The same old fucking thing time and time and time again.
You've been the pain in my life.

Oh yeah.

Canât take my breath away from me.
I know it can be so deceiving.
And you!
Canât take me down so easily.
My life is one that is worth living.
Do you live a life of pain?
Canât take my breath away from me.
I know it can be so deceiving. So fucking deceiving.
And you!
Canât take me down so easily.
My life is one that is worth living.
Do you live a life of pain?
