A true test of our time is to take hold of life
And not give everything up for greed
Coming together as one is a fucking day dream
And like some I just donât give a shit
Try to take charge where chaos prevails
Is like holding acid in your hands
But youâll be living the dream once youâve cut through the shit
And youâll see it all worked in the end

Itâs a sweet victory when misery fails
And the bullshit is stopped in itâs tracks
Lets embrace what we have and live for ourselves
And not mourn what we choose to believe
Make your own choice you can hate if you want
But donât take you shit out on me
Weâll come together as one against what you want
Because weâre taking this fight to the sun

Weâre liars
Weâre haters
Deceivers
And killers
Weâre fakers
Believers
Weâre judges
And Demons
Weâre liars
Weâre haters
Deceivers
And killers
Weâre fakers
Believers
Weâre judges
And Demons
DEMONS
DEMONS

A true test of our time is to take hold of life
And not give everything up for greed
We came together as one against what you want
And still I just donât give a shit
Youâve tried to take charge where chaos prevails
Youâve held the acid in you hands
And youâve been burnt

If I could care less I would but I donât know how
You expect me to feel sympathy for someone I donât give a fuck about
If I could care less I would but I donât know how
You expect me to feel sympathy for something donât give a fuck about
