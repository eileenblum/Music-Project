And we will rise
From the graves you have dug
Youâve rendered us resigned
You should know
Not to write us off
Youâve just signed up for your demise
TIRED OF HATRED
SICK OF EXCUSES

Weep for the chosen few
Take part in progress
Or stand and shed a tear for those that have been shot down
Weâre here but overlooked
Weâre making progress
You all will count us out
Until we rise again

Blood tainted fists
Of those who forgot
Our hatred fuels our drive
You should know
Not to turn your back
On what you think is dead and gone
TIRED OF HATRED
SICK OF EXCUSES

Weep for the chosen few
Take part in progress
Or stand and shed a tear for those that have been shot down
Weâre here but overlooked
Weâre making progress
You all will count us out
Until we rise again

Now itâs time to take our pound of flesh
Make a stand and take back what is ours
Underestimated all our lives
Now itâs time for all of us to RISE

Weep for the chosen few
Take part in progress
Or stand and shed a tear for those that have been shot down
Weâre here but overlooked
Weâre making progress
You all will count us out
Until we rise again

(Those who we weep for are often forgotten)
Weep for the chosen few
Take part in progress
Or stand and shed a tear for those that have been shot down
(Those who we weep for are often forgotten)
Weâre here but overlooked
Weâre making progress
You all will count us out
Until we rise again

MY HEART BEATS FOR
MY HEART BLEEDS FORâ¦
THE OFTEN FORGOTTEN
