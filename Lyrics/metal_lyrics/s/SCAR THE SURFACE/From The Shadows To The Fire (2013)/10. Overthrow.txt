Fall to your knees
Fall to submission
You will surrender (your will)
And not question what I say
Fall to your knees
Prey for forgiveness
Deny your maker
I am how nightmares are made
I find you fascinating the way
You mould to the shapes we set
Itâs the prettiest picture: a smile on our face with a gun to your head
What we want
We just take
You will do
What we say

We will take control
Weâre watching you become
Numb to everything
We build you up to watch
You fall!
With the illusion that youâre free
Weâre pulling harder on your
Strings
To watch you crawl
You are just puppets to us!

Uprise

It seems
To me
That hypocrisy
Is still how the world is made
We canât
Give in
We should take up arms
To overthrow oppression

Standing tall against aggressors
Fascist kings and mind

Oppressors
Relinquishing what weâve
Been fed
Are we alive or just un-dead?
You hide yourself in ivory
Towers
And use us as your scapegoats
Now everything weâve built
For you
Itâs time to watch it crumble

When you lose control
Is there a power that we gain?
Or we donât know
I wonât buy you bullshit
Anymore!
If we live outside of fear
There is no end to achieved
Or what we dream
Or we will never dream at all!

When you lose control
Is there a power that we gain?
Or we donât know
I wonât buy you bullshit
Anymore!
If we live outside of fear
There is no end to achieved
Or what we dream
Or we will never dream at all!

Sifting through the broken
Pieces
Bitterness is pouring outward
Everything turns to ash in
Our mouths
Our ignorance brought us
Disorder
We built a brand new power
Structure
And now we are right back to
Where we started
Weâve become our own
Oppressors
