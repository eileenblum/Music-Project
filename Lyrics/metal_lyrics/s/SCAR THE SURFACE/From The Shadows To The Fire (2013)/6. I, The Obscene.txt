So Iâm nothing
But to you I am
Voices inside you that fester and scream
Am I conscience?
Does it matter?
The longer you hear me, the more I control
Every conflict
Every issue
For someone so pure your thoughts are obscene
Itâs my failure
Are your failure
When you take the shit and accept the abuse

Your deception means youâve already lost
Despite credibility, itâs your dignity gone

You hear me these voices in your head
(They) Twist and distort what you think
Your obsession sickening
Youâre bent on gore stained imagines
Guilt is ripping you in two
Iâm the stronger part of you
Set on breaking free again

Canât you take this any longer?
Why canât you just accept what you are?

Am I reason
To your impulse
The psychotic drama that plays in your head?
Can they hear me?
You can hear me
I am the persona that you want to be
Are you worthless?
Do you matter?
Are you so insecure that you need to be me?
I am madness
I am freedom
I am what you fear and I am the release

Separate yourself!

Heed the voices that read the warnings
That we have issued to
Make you realize that
All you need to do
Is embrace what you are
Youâre love â youâre hate
