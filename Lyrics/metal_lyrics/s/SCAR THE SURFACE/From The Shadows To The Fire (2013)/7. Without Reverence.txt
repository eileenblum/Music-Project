Lest we forget
When will we walk as one?

Lest we forget
What they gave their lives for
Now they were striving to set us free
Lest we forget
It was the war to end wars
But now theyâre faded memories
For the price that they paid
For the lives that they gave
And we canât stand still for one fucking minute?
For the love of a nation
For the safety of children
And now weâve nothing to show for that theyâve done

If we stand and we walk alone
On different sides we will fall
We should stand and walk as one
And we will be reborn
United in a war
And fought with all their heart
Now forgotten by us all

When you open your eyes
You should open your mind
And remember how they gave us what we have
Weâve grown tired of blind
Leading the blind
In the aftermath of wars that were fought
A respect that was earned
Is now a power thatâs bought
Donât forget the price they payed was death
They fought for substance not greed
Now we forget everything
They built a mountain
We tore down the sky

If we stand and we walk alone
On different sides we will fall
We should stand and walk as one
And we will be reborn
United in a war
And fought with all their heart
Now forgotten by us all

What are you fighting for now?

War

If we stand and we walk alone
On different sides we will fall
We should stand and walk as one
And we will be reborn
United in a war
And fought with all their heart
Now forgotten by us all

Are we not the ones?
That now have our freedom?
Because of what they
Have sacrificed!
