As a young boy I learnt
That life was not what it seemed
I saw the truth of human nature
And did what I need to survive
It all started one Sunday
When I was only five
My innocence was taken from me
Fear never got the best of me

Blind eyes, blame and your judgment

Primary school was a constant battle
Fight or hide
I knew that I could never back down
Or Iâd lose my self-respect
I never gave up, they never gave in
And my battles werenât won
But it only made me stronger
And I thought my wars were done

Reflecting
On what I could have been
Remember
I found the strength in me

So Iâm reflecting (It changed my life)
On what I have ignored (It changed me forever)
But can I finally put out the fires of hate?

It changed my life
It changed me forever
It changed my life
It changed me forever

I constantly used them when they thought they had used me
And I never tried to impress
Their hypocrisy fuelled the hate in me
But I could see through their masks

Reflecting
On what I have ignored
But can I finally put out the fires of hate?

Reflecting
On what I could have been
Remember
I found the strength in me

So Iâm reflecting (It changed my life)
On what I have ignored (It changed me forever)
But can I finally put out the fires of hate?
Itâs not an easy thing (It changed me forever)
To walk the path Iâve walked (It changed my life)
But can I let go of the pieces that Iâve kept?
It changed my life!
