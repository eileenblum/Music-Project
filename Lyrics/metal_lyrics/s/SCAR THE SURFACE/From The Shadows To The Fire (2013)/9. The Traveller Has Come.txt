We are
In a time of desperation
Living free to shattered lives
In the blind of an eye
Confiding in a liar
False hopes in a packaged illusion
All we see are the broken dreams
And the strain left behind
Now the strain of everything is choking more and more
The consequence of confidence has bitten the last time

And now
I see it all so clear
And for now
The nightmare is over
But the answers that we found all start to fade
Leaving questions that destroy all that weâve changed

By burning the bridges
New conflicts arise
We story each other
Along with our pride
Now the guilt of everything has clenched the fists of hate
The consequence of ignorance will be our last mistake

and now
I see it all so clear
And for now
The nightmare is over
But the answers that we found all start to fade
Leaving questions that destroy all that weâve changed

By burning the bridges
New conflicts arise
We story each other
Along with our pride

And now
I see it all so clear
And for now
The nightmare is over
But the answers that we found all start to fade
Leaving questions that destroy all that weâve changed
That weâve changed
