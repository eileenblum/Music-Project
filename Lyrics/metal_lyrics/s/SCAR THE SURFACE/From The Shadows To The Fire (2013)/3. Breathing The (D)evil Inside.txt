Caught in the middle of a conflict
And lost with a world
We stir the violence until it takes
Your soul
Disrupt the institutions
And savour every threat
The deal is done when you feel the
Devilâs breath
Our time of violence and chaos
Is coming
Best prepare your affairs
The day has come to change your
Fucking mind
Now choose your side

So did you ask yourself what
You could do for mankind or did
You fall?
Believing that you were the victim
And now your choice is made will
You embrace your new life to show
The world
The choice was in your hands?

Whatever happens now the deal is
Done my friend
Take a look around â what do you see?
You have the opportunity of a lifetime
So take it like a man and take it.
Take it!
The weight of the world had gone
From your shoulders

Take a deep breath and make your
New start
The problems of your past will soon
Be washed away
Never stand idol, your shit wonât
Change
All your life
You were the victim
All this time
You were helpless
Finally you can see your potential
Walk the path the now clear
You can see the beauty is chaos
What you see is not
What you think
Itâs easy to walk away
Fromm all the
Choices the you have made

So did you ask yourself what
You could do for mankind or did
You fall?
Believing that you were the victim
And now your choice is made will
You embrace your new life to show
The world
The choice was in your hands?
So did you ask yourself what
You could do for mankind or did
You fall?
Or was the choice there in your hands?
