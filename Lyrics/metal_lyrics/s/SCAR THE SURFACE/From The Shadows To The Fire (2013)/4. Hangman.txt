Iâm holding on this time. But does
It matter?
Caught in the hangmanâs noose
Black sheep not from your herd, I am
Condemned
To find my own through
A bleak existence and little reward
By end of days, gone mad
I seek no glory, no-one to envy
Another chapter through

I am the one thatâs seen and never heard
A distant memory in whispered words
And I too was once a broken man
But this change in me has not
Been easy

These dayâs I live for now
Are in my dreams
These words that one rang true
Are now infestedâ¦

We are a disease, a deadly outbreak
We are a plague called life
We are the force fed from open minds

Unless we break the hold
We not repent, we will not regret
In pain we scream their names
We wonât stop fighting, but I find
A reason
For those who died in vein.

Itâs the end of days

These dayâs I live for now
Are in my dreams
These words that one rang true
Are now infested with lies

With lies

Inside I am the broken dreams of man
I will deny an age of suffering
Destroy the foundations on which
You stand
I am the god you are waiting for

These dayâs I live for now
Are in my dreams
These words that one rang true
â¦Are now infested
With these lies!
