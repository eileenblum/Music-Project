This is the prelude for destructionâ¦

Iâve taken the longest road to reach my destiny
Crawled on my stomach through broken glass
Hoping that one day time will save me
Now things have changed
Gone astray
We will never be the same
Take a chance, take this life
Learn from whatâs been fucked before
We wonât die
We wonât change
Through our knowledge we will rise
But we still
Stay the same
All the work that weâve done
Hopeless
Soulless

Bring me to the life for the last time

We live another day to
Wash the pain
Weâre living through our strength
And soâ¦
We live to see again
We have nothing to fear
Right now!

Deconstruct the only things that gave us strength within our lives
Itâs in our nature to destroy it
The principals for what we have will betray all the things we save
By pressing on the nerves of failure
The only things that we have left are taken from our fucking hands
While holding us back from our success
And now the faults and past mistakes have come to haunt us once again
Isnât it time that we did something right?

We live another day to
Wash the pain
Weâre living through our strength
And soâ¦
We live to see again
We have nothing to fear
Right now!
