Iâm trading blow for blow
As I stand to witness
Reflections of the burden I've become
And yes I've come to know
All about this hell that I've
Brought onto myself I now call It home

I have kept (nothing)
Nothing for myself
Just to save this
From all I am

And Iâm just a broken man
Set on self-destruction
But I must learn to help myself
And earn my redemption
Blood for blood I wage this war
With all I've got
When I leave, itâs what I am
Not what Iâve lost

Keeping in what Iâve needed to get out
Nothing can control me now that I have nothing left
Holding back so that I can save myself
Iâll face my inner demons now that Iâve escaped my head

This tongue has bitten back a thousand times
I have been giving back since the day I died

I have kept
Nothing for myself
Just to save this
From all I am

Live and die on this day
Live and die on this day
Live and die on this day

Live, die
Live, die

I have kept
Nothing for myself
Just to save this
From all I am

(Thereâs not a shadow of doubt in this man that you see
I have risen from a war with meaningless
If time is the test then I surely have won
Now you despise the man that I have become)
