Oh how my hate is beckoning me to give into it
The stench of failure seeps through my skin
And takes me once again
With open eyes I look ahead to find my sanctity
But all I find is disappointment
How will my dreams begin?

With all but my mind
Closed over
Iâll break the hold from this agonising suffocation
That drags me down
They say that Iâve been catatonic
A fragment of a man
Now with the pieces I have now found
Will I be whole?

The choices Iâve made
Have brought me here
The choices I make
Will be my last chance

In times like these we see what has become of man dissolve
Our empathy is weaning and our formula life is wrong
Is wrong

Inside of me the battle rages on with no relief
My mind is ripe with indecision
Thereâs something more to this
So tell me what am I supposed to do with empathy?
These problems that I see before me are whatâs to come

I am hated and
I have suffered and
I have seen the truth for what Iâve become
I have denied and
I am denial and
I have severed ties with all that I know

The choices Iâve made
Have brought me here
The choices I make
Dissolve

The things we see inside are more true than we once realised,
Now we stand and hesitate.
The difference is that I've accepted what I've become.
Erased all I know. Stood on the outside.

Will I get one more chance to redeem myself for what Iâve done?

In times like these we see what has become of man dissolve
Our empathy is weaning and our formula life is wrong

In times like these we see what has become of man dissolve
(we see it all dissolve, we see it all)
Our empathy is weaning and our formula life is wrong
