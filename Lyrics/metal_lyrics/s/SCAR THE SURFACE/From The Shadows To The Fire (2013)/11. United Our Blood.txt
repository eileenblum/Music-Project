Am I the only one who can see
What weâve become?
With a futile path of resistance
And a cause we canât recall the
Meaning of
This stand we take
To fight our long lost cause
Is only to pass the time
Until we find what weâre
Searching for
So many thoughts of annihilation
Irrational rage that makes
Us blind
Now we are right back
At the start
Can we make it grow or fall apart?

Is there a soul
With the weight of the world
Carried upon their shoulders?
With our strength and our soul
Without wings we can fly
And rise above the defences
The truth of it all
Is we reap what we sew
And lose what we took
For granted
We need to look past
Our gender and race and creed
So it all has no meaning

Nowâs the time
We should fly
Nowâs the time
We forget all our hate
Now is the time
We should fly
Now is the time
We forgot all our hate

We need to get past our sorrow
And find what makes us love
We need to move past our difference
And unite our blood

And what weâre searching for
Will lead us through the lie
Lacking a depth in knowledge
Seething from inside
How can we entertain this
Prejudice without the question âwhy?â
Are we so empty that we canât decide?

Nowâs the time
We should fly
Nowâs the time
We forget all our hate
Now is the time
We should fly
Now is the time
We forgot all our hate

We need to get past our sorrow
And find what makes us love
We need to move past our difference
And unite our blood
Our blood.
