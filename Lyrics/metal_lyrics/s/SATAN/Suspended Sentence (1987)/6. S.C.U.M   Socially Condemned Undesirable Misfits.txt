They add to the litter on the streets
The problems mounting day by day.
You can tell by the way they lounge around.
They couldn't give a damn what "Joe" has to say

Still they beg for shelter, cry for a home
Then settle for a doorway, where they can drink alone
Dismissed by Society, treated like an enemy
They wonder why people scream "Go away"!

Socially Condemned Undesirable Misfits

They line the city streets in rags
In search for citizens to bleed
Preying on the kindest hearts
There's always someone who'll help a fool in need

Pleading for a little cash to save them from the cold
Promising never again, but you've heard it all before
Try to avoid them like the plague
Sick of the constant "Take Take Take!"
or is it just a form of snobbery to say - SCUM!
It takes all sorts to make the world go round.
Somehow Mr Average doesn't understand.
That some people choose, - some people lose
and become the ones that nobody wants - SCUM!

In good old London town you know they're always to be found
"Try your best to bring us down but like a family we are proud"
Where there lie benefits, that's where they'll always stand around.
"In our raggy Uniforms, We'll always stand our ground".

It doesn't matter what people say
on the pavements they take pride of place
What can the law say except "Come on now Move away!"
So when it comes to poverty. Ignorance is the best policy
Their home is the streets they roam, leave them alone.
