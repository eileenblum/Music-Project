Bound by Honour, dedicated to the cause
that will glorify his side
On Wings of Destiny he flies
This will be his first and his last mission
a crash course in suicide
He'll be smiling as he dies

Die with Honour,
To die is to Win
To fight for the cause
To Kill and be Killed

Fly to Freedom,
From out of the Sun
Attacking as one
They'll never stop until they've won

There'll be no surrender as they march on to Hell or Victory
A Whole Damned Nation that's too proud
Sworn to sacrifice, religion is their code of Chivalry
And failure would never be allowed

Noble Warriors, they'll fight 'till the end
As this war rages on
Die Victorious, or live with Defeat,
They'll be brave, They'll be strong.

To Die is to win, To fight for the cause.
To Kill and be Killed
To Die is the price, Your last sacrifice
You've released your last dice

Closing in, Target now in sight, enemy dead ahead
Too late for second thoughts, ablaze and going down
Nose diving, Screaming from the sky,
Collision any second now.
On Impact he knows he's won,

They'll be commended
Forever remembered
They Died with honour, To die is to win.
