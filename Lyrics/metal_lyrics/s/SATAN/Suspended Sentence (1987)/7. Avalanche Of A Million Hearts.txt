In the distance, a leader was screaming "I'll be Master"
"Our Nation will be perfect in every way
We laughed. We laughed.
Then came the day they led us away
His dreams were our nightmares to come
We were to suffer because of one political God
A madman with a burning soul.

The children cried for comfort
Confusion in their eyes
Awoken by the soldier
Blinded by his sire
We watched our houses burning
They took our Silver and our Gold
Our people were dying in millions
The young and the old
We were never told why -

Rounded up for the execution
Stripped of dignity and grace
I was part of the final solution
To make way for the master race

By these cold hearted leaders we will fall
No room for our people in their mighty war
So we must die
Dare not defy
Destroyed in the course of History

As time went by the hatred grew
And the light of mercy disappeared.
We were treated like the plague
His disciples had the cure

We tried to believe someone would come
And we would survive
We had to hold our heads up high
But we still died,
Our dreams denied
Destroyed in a Human Landside

Many heard the screams of a Million Hearts
Still no-one helped as they were torn apart

We still have memories,
Such painful dreams of when sentence was passed

Our hunt for the jury will always last
Revenge will come
Justice must be done
Our search will last forever
