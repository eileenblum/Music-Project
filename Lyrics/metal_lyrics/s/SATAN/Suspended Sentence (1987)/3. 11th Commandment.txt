Thou shalt disbelieve
Decide your own future
Carve your own pathway
You've got to live with reality, don't hide behind a faith
You're a fool to think your sins are forgiven
in this cruel world we live in

Don't take the bait, in this world Trapped in lied
Don't take the bait, in this world Drowning in greed

Poverty breeds more prayer
With hope of help from above
Hypnotized from the start of life
- Won't you ever understand?

Millions of people are dying from starvation
While Churches sit in riches and beg from the nation

Don't take the bait, this world's a plague called hate
Don't take. Just say no.

Everything comes to you just wait
You don't need a religious faith
Everything comes to you in the end
Good or bad, it's what fate sends

Too many people of different sects
Fight one another it makes no sense
No life after death, that's just fantasy
If you think you're immune, that's Insanity
