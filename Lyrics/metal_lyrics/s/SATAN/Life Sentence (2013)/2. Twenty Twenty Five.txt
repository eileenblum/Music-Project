So it came to pass in the ancient days of immortality
There would come a great flood such as the world had never seen
There was pandemonium in the cities and streets the whole world around
Men, women, and children were crushed in the race for higher ground

Fly together holy men and kings
Fly Godspeed on golden wings
But holy men and kings would die
In the year Twenty Twenty Five

At first the people laughed with scorn at the prophet's claim
Men of faith remained in wait for the rapture that never came
A rushing wall of water so high to cleanse the world of sin
For the few survivors there was little choice but to begin again

Fly together common men and kings
Fly full speed on frantic wings
But common men and kings they died
In the year Twenty Twenty Five

Fly together holy men and kings
Fly Godspeed on golden wings
Fly
But holy men and kings would die
Common men and kings they died
In the year Twenty Twenty Five
