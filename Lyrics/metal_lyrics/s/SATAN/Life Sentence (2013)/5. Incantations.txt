I feel the icy hand of fear, now I sense the time is near to pass into the next world
So as they ready me for salvation, there'll be spells and incantations to keep me safe from evil

Spells from the book of the dead. Words on the scroll
Written in pharaoh's blood. Sanctified
Incantations for my soul

Now as the sleep of death will rise and at last I close my eyes, Anubis waiting for my soul
So I'm delivered up to Ra. My final journey takes me for into the spirit world

Spells from the book of the dead. Words on the scroll
Written in pharaoh's blood. Sanctified
Incantations for my soul

It's in the valley of the kings
It's written in the sands of time
My secrets held within my tomb
A curse on those who break the seal

I felt the icy hand of fear when I sensed the time was near to pass into the next world
So as they readied me for salvation, there were spells and incantations to keep me safe from evil

Spells from the book of the dead. Words on the scroll
Written in pharaoh's blood. Sanctified
Incantations for my soul
Ra deliver me
Ra god of the sun
Ra deliver me
Ra god of the sun
