Why should I now play the Roman fool and die on my own sword
You made me into whatever I am, for every sin of mine the blame is yours
So bring it on do your worst my ex-friend, I'll surrender but only by force

I'll never yield, I'll never give in to you
I'll never yield, This siege mentality is all down to you

Well it was not so very long ago I was courted by your heads of state
You turned a blind eye to human rights just as long as I played your game
But now it suits you to have me removed, you think I'll simply walk away

I'll never yield, I'll never give in to you
I'll never yield, This siege mentality is all down to you

Siege Mentality
My armies will die for me
I laugh at your naivety
And sneer at your kind from within my confines

No matter how much the wind should howl, the mountain still cannot bow
You took my riches in exchange for arms, I'll use them against you now
So let the mother of all conflicts begin, I'll show the world and how

I'll never yield, I'll never give in to you
I'll never yield, This siege mentality is all down to you
I'll never yield, You'll never take me alive
I'll never yield, This siege mentality is how I survive
