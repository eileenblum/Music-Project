A powerful man you came to me to repent and confess your sin
A most solemn intention but barely a mention of the trouble you're in

So summon another lie, bleed your soul dry, carry on with your scheming
You better recognise, open up your eyes, your own personal demons are pulling you down
Down, demons are pulling you down. Down, demons are pulling you down
Pulling you under, ripping your mind asunder, you're ebbing away

You arrogant fool you claim such high moral ground to present your case
Selfishly seeking favour, like you were the saviour of the human race

So summon another lie, bleed your soul dry, carry on with your scheming
You better recognise, open up your eyes, your own personal demons are pulling you down
Down, demons are pulling you down. Down, demons are pulling you down
Pulling you under, ripping your mind asunder, you're ebbing away

Out of control, spinning and whirling around
Out of control, demons are pulling you down
Soul survival is ebbing away, soul survival is ebbing away
Soul survival is ebbing away, soul survival is ebbing away

The imminent taste of victory has turned to ashes upon your tongue
So much for your fable, your Tower of Babel has crumbled and gone

So summon another lie, bleed your soul dry, carry on with your scheming
You better recognise, open up your eyes, your own personal demons are pulling you down
Down, demons are pulling you down. Down, demons are pulling you down
Pulling you under, ripping your mind asunder, you're ebbing away
