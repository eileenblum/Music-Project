Father forgive them, they know not what they do
Self-obsessed generations without a clue
To the meaning of sacrifice, made by those gone before
Their legend inscribed on the Cenotaph wall

Bow your head for the glorious dead
We will remember
We will remember then
At the Cenotaph wall

They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old
Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember then

Mother don't weep for them, they gave their lives for a cause
Spilled out their lifeblood for you and me
The names of thousands have been etched in stone
Forever inscribed on the Cenotaph wall

Bow your head for the glorious dead
We will remember
We will remember then
At the Cenotaph wall
We will remember then
At the Cenotaph wall
