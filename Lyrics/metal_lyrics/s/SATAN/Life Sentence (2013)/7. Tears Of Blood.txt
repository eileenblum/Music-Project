Day of infamy. Heaven fell where the rivers meet
A new in history, The sky will burn at forty five degrees
Out of the morning sun came the new Armageddon
The Earth stood still as one and the angels in Heaven cried

Tears of blood. They cried tears of blood
For the innocent three thousand the angels cried tears of blood

Shock and disbelief. The world gazed at TV screens
All states united in grief. Diplomacy was ll too brief
Out of the western skies came a fierce retribution
A blood for blood reprise as again the angels cried

Tears of blood. They cried tears of blood
For the unavenged three thousand the angels cried tears of blood
Tears of black blood. They cried tears of black blood
As a nation's rage defined the new age with tears of black blood
Retribution

From the aftermath emerged tales of incredible rescue
Many heroes lost their lives, yet the surfing man survived
Out of the settling dust rose a defiant nation
Bonded by their loss and a thirst for reparation

Tears of blood. They cried tears of blood
For the unavenged three thousand the angels cried tears of blood
Tears of black blood. They cried tears of black blood
On that terrible day a price was paid in tears of black blood
Tears of black blood
