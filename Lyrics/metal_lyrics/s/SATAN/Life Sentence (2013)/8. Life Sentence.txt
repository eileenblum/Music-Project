Your wretched soul just one of the many
A life sentence bestowed upon you
A tolling hell has released you from your prison
Your living hell for a crime you did not do

Life sentence. It's been twenty eight long years
Life sentence. You almost gave up hope
You called my name and often I would hear you
Life sentence. We set you free you never gave up hope

The time is now, your wait is almost over
Rising up to regain the golden throne
We will be strong, our voices raised in chorus
Dead men's souls no longer cry and moan

Life sentence. It's been twenty eight long years
Life sentence. You almost gave up hope
You called my name and often I would hear you
Life sentence. We set you free you never gave up hope

Listen heard this is the sound of freedom
The dogs of hate will howl before they fall
We play our part standing strong together
We dare not fail, rise yuo and heed the call

Life sentence. Twenty eight long years
Life sentence. Together once again
We'll call your name and lead you from your darkness
Life sentence. With burning heart the sound begins again
