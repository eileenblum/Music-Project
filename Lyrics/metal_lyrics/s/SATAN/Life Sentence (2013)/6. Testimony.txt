No more subterfuge and no more pretence. There's not much to offer in my defence
I've gone off the path it's true but on this day, I have nothing to say

Nothing but the truth
The truth the whole truth
Nothing but the truth

These are my final words
And this is my one last testimony
I'll speak nothing but the truth this day

I have given all to plead my case. There's no lies written on my face
No more deception no games to play. I have nothing to say

These are my final words
And this is my one last testimony
I'll speak nothing but the truth this day

No more subterfuge and no more pretence. There's not much to offer in my defence
I've gone off the path it's true but on this day, I have nothing to say

Nothing but the truth
The truth the whole truth
Nothing but the truth

These are my final words
And this is my one last testimony
I'll speak nothing but the truth this day
