As flames devour this forest, all around as far as they eye can see
Perfect devastation, a life free zone for evermore it would seem
As seasons fly, a seed may bloom against the odds
Maybe so, in another life, another universe maybe
But nothing grows, nothing grows here

As flames devour this forest, all around as far as they eye can see
Perfect devastation, a life free zone for evermore it would seem

No more to live no more to endure, no more to give
I'll meet you in another life
No more to breathe, no more to feel, no more to speak
I'll meet you in another life

Another life, another universe
Another life, another universe

A pyroclastic cloud tears the life from everything in it's path
Blackens out of the sun, and in it's wake leaves only ash

No more to live no more to endure, no more to give
I'll meet you in another life
No more to breathe, no more to feel, no more to speak
I'll meet you in another life

Another life, another universe
Another life, another universe
