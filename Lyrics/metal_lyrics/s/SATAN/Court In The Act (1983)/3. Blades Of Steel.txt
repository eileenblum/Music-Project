The Vikings they were conquerors, they sought to rule the land,
Many peaceful villages were crushed beneath their hands,
Driven by the power of Lucifer and Thor,
They pillaged and they plundered, took women for their whores,
Blades of steel.

The Vikings sailed to foreign shores, with steel at their command,
Seeking warmth and shelter, they roamed across the land,
Zandor was their leader, there's none so fearless and brave,
He'd guide them through the coming months,
Through winter they'd be safe,
Blades of Steel.

Shining sun warms the earth, autumn time has come,
People gathered in the fields, the summer's almost gone,
By the fireside, they would laugh and dance and sing,
Prepared for anything the winter months would bring,
But soon they would fall by blades of steel.

Blades of steel, ripping through the town,
Blades of steel, tearing you all down,
Blades of steel, put terror in your hearts
Blades of steel, tear the world apart.
