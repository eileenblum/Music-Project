I've had enough of your backstabbing,
I'm getting tired of your lies,
Had enough of vicious rumours,
What you've seen with your own eyes.

[Chorus]
Be out of town before I come to get you,
Keep on running, I'll hunt you down,
Aint no time to settle my vengeance,
Don't start begging, I'll hunt you down,
Keep out of my sights, cos I'll hunt you down,
Get out of this place, I'm ready to blow,
Touch me, I'll explode in your face.

You hang around important people,
And worm your way into their lives,
They are happy cos they all trust you,
You are happy sleeping with their wives.

[Chorus]

Can't you see, that people love you face to face,
Behind your back, they take you down and mark your name,
I believe it's time, to put you in your place,
Win or lose, in the end it's all the same.

Your name is etched upon the bullet,
Assassins watch, they know you well,
Your time is up, your days are numbered,
Prepare yourself to burn in Hell.

[Chorus]
