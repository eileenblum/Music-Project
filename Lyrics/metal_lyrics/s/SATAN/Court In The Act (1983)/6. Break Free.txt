Out in the cold, you've got nowhere to run, but you're free again,
When you're alone you remember the day in your cell,
You were convicted and sentenced to life,
Your cries of "Injustice", unheard,
Locked inside, you planned your break,
Now you're free.

[Chorus]
So you've got to run again,
You've broken your chains,
Now you've got to run, run, run.

Gotta break free!

Now that you're out, you can look fot the ones who condemned you,
Show the world that you're not just a pawn in this game,
All of their faces you see in your mind,
Your memories build up into hate,
All you've been through, gonna put them through Hell,

[Chorus]

Break out and run, your escape has begun,
But the Law's on your ass once again,
Wanted and hunted, you know you can't hide,
So keep running as fast as you can,
You know you were innocent, you know they were wrong,
And now they've turned you into a killer,
Another wasted life now, just thrown it away,
So with their own lives you're gonna make them pay.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Gotta break free!
