Looking for a way to put me down,
I gotta stop your hanging around,
You're telling me I'm crazy, but I'm not a fool,
I don't live by the book, I don't want no rules.

Trying to make it through all the rough times,
All the way to the top, it's a tough ride,
They're all calling me mad, I've gotta prove them wrong,
I don't care what it takes, I can't wait too long.

[Chorus]
No turning back, can't stop me now,
No turning back, so don't put me down,
No turning back, cos I told you before
No turning back, no turning back, break down the door.

What's it like at the top, it's a tough ride,
You never know who's taking your side,
Jealous people who are are causing you pain,
And there's the days when it drives you insane,
No turning back, no time for dreaming,
I love this life, I feel like screaming,
You all should know, there's a lesson for learning,
Deep in my heart, there's a flame that is burning.

Gotta keep on trying when the going's tough,
Cos you can do anythin if you want it enough,
Believe in yourself, no-one else but you,
And if you've got the guts, you can make it through.

[Chorus]

No turning back!
