Now your time has come, you've got to travel away,
But where your path will lead, no man can say,
Look back on your life, hear the Mourners song,
Just your Innner Conscience betrays your wrongs,
Watch the road unfold before you,
Is this not what you thought you'd see?
Shrug away the chains that bound you,
You'll stand alone in the dark,
But still you don't feel free.

Sail away along the river,
Where the souls of dead-men moan,
Will your road go on forever,
Could they leave you here alone? ...No!

Through the white marble gates, down the dimly-lit path,
Looking over your shoulder, did you hear someone laugh?
See the bright lights ahead, they possess their own call,
Unaware that you're dead, got your back to the wall,
The Gates Of Justice now closed, hear the key in the lock,
Watch and your path will unfold, as you stand alone in the dark.

Trying to find a place to hide,
As from the bonds of life, you're freed,
Satan, laughing, creeps inside,
Attracted by your wealth and greed,
All at once, you see your jury,
All the bastards you have spurned,
The Judge's eyes ablaze with fury,
You stand alone now, feel the flames begin to burn.

You're gonna stand alone in the dark.
