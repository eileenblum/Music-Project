Earthly incarnation, a demon soul will rise
Two spirits in battle now, control of men they prize
The dawn of Lucifer, the reign of Christ,
And now the rise if one who holds us in his vice

Ahriman in human form
Ahriman control us all
Control us all

Materialistic teaching, the path of man0s decline
Blinded by science, abandoning our minds
The scene is set now, his influence is strong
Devours our need to question things we know are wrong

Ahriman in human form
Ahriman control us all

Tell me do you believe all you see in the papaers and on the TV (Sleight of hand)
Coocooned by the very technology that keeps you docile with your head in the sand (Ahriman)
Strangulation of the spiritual kind
Subjugation of the learned mind

Life and the universe won't be explained away
We think we're in control but soon we'll rue the day

Ahriman in human form
Ahriman control us all
Control us all
