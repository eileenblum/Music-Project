I am destined to be the last of my kind
And that day is drawing nearer
Fools still seek em our in their ignorance and pride
The final cost grows ever deaer

The winds of tomorrow bring us only ruination
Mass murder for vanity
A one way trip to extinction
Where will it end
What have they done
Won't someone help us
Ruination
Somebody save us
Ruination

Between the horns of cruel conscience and mortal
need, the hunter must kill to survive
For others down the line it's not life and death,
but greed
And on that principle they thrive

The black tide of sorrow brings us only ruination
Wiped out for a fallacy
Chosen for termination
Where will it end

What have they done
Won't someone help us
Ruination
Somebody save us
Ruination

Preservation unguaranteed
Find me shelter
The sole protection for me
Lies on paper
It's not too late
We can be saved
Oh hear my call
Hear my call

The black tide of sorrow brings us only ruination
Wiped out for a fallacy
Chosen for termination
Ruination
Ruination
Ruination
