They said it could happen any time
The Earth returned to flame
Designated Persephone
Our destruction has a name
A billion years of flight through the void
To meet her journey's end
As we play out the final hours
On a miracle we depend

Civilisation falls today
But it will rise again
Kneel to your Gods and pray
Pray for a new world to come

All hope is now extinguished
The losing battle fought
The planet's finest minds enlisted
But every plan fell short
Seventy miles of ice and stone
Bearing down at speed
As we await the final impact
May God have mercy please

Civilisation ends today
But we'll begin again
Kneel to your Gods and pray
For a new world to come

She was named after the queen of Hades
Her long lonely voyage through the universe brings
annihilation ever closer to Earth.
Helplessly, hopelessly, humanity awaits the fall of Persephone.
Across the globe billions fall of the their knees and beseech their God to save them from approaching doom.

Dear Lord help us
Please God save our souls
Dea Lord help us
Please God save our souls

See her looming ever larger in the sky
Her all consuming shadow means
the end for you and I
Point of impact in the Adriatic Sea
Ten thousand Hiroshimas it's the end for you and me
The end of humanity
The end of you and me
The fall of Persephone

See her looming in the sky
The end of you and I
Fall to your knees

The end of humanity
The fall of Persephone
