In the beginning God left the human race to evolve in our own time
But now the time is running low, where did evolution go, we crossed a line
Somehow we contrived to lose our soul, where did it go, where did it go

Goodbye, farewell evolution, a slow painful death, degeneration
Farewell, the end has begun, man's final breath, farewell evolution

Robot minds, independent thinking is dead, what do I see
I see non confidantes around me only slaves to the screen, slaves to conformity
The spirit of man has fallen in vain, fallen into shave, fallen into shame

Goodbye, farewell evolution, a slow painful death, degeneration
Farewell, the end has begun, man's final breath, farewell evolution

The race is over
Evolution is done
Our species over the hill
The downward spiral's begun
Darwin's theory took us so far
Now it's time to shut it down and fade into the dark

Withering hearts, compassion and forgiveness are gone what do I see
I see no empathy around me, only fear and jealousy, consuming me
And still we go on seeking someone to blame, someone to blame, someone to blame

Goodbye, farewell evolution, a slow painful death, degeneration
Farewell, the end has begun, man's final breath, farewell evolution
