Please be upstanding now the court will rise
For the eminent Justice Swift
No mercy or compassion in his eyes
Just a burning crimson mist
If you should testify
Never look him in the eye
Call his judgement into question and you'll be held
in contempt

Held in contempt
You'll be taken down below
Held in contempt
No escape

Draconian justice from another age
Yet he is older still
Do not object you'll only fuel his rage
He'll break you, bend you to his will
You hear the gavel band
Be silent or you'll hand
Don't interrupt him, he'll have you thrown into a cell

Held in contempt
You'll be taken down below
Held in contempt
Taken down

He is a servant of below
And we don't mean the cells
This is no Earthly court of law
You're at the gates of Hell

The demon points at you and grins
Your flesh starts to crawl
You're wishing as you recount your sins
That you had never been born

Your very life in his control
He's in contempt of your soul

Get on your feet, before this court you'll rise
For your judgement and your fate
Stares right through you with contempt in his eyes
And for you there's no escape
No escape
You're in contempt
You're in contempt
You're in contempt
