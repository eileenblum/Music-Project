You seem familiar to me
Yet I don't recall your name
Don't even know my own relations
Somehow the faces fade away
Atom by atom
Atom by atom

No drugs or medication
Can stop the march of this malaise
Slowly disintegrating
Headlong into the final phase
Atom by atom
Atom by atom
I'll forget you
Atom by atom
I'll reject you
Atom by atom

Everything here in my head is carved in sand
Who'll remember me when I'm dead
When I leave the land of the living
Atom by atom
Atom by atom

So much stolen from me
So little of me left inside
This shell is almost empty
This man has been vapourised
Atom by atom
Atom by atom
I'll forget you
Atom by atom
I'll reject you
Atom by atom
I'll delete you
Atom by atom
I'll forget you
Atom by atom
