I'm my own god, I broke the mould
Life's what I make it, now what I'm told
Make your own rules, lecture me not
Set sail your compass, it's a rough sea we've got

I am my own god
Made myself, broke the mould
Life is what I make it
I will not be told
I am my own god
My very own god

In the beginning shape and form evolved
Logic soon followed, the gene puzzle was solved
Is it nature or nature that made me this man
All I Know is if I think it, I can

I am my own god
Made myself, broke the mould
Life is what I make it
Not what I've been told
I am my own god
My very own god

So welcome to the 'I
See through the outer lie
I have self belief bur I'm no visionary
I am just a man with his own advocacy
My own god
