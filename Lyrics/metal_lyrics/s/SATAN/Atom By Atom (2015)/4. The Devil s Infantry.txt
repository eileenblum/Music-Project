Children of unrest come gather at my side
Pledge your allegiance and fate will decide
We'll give your purpose and meaning in your life
Fight
March
Obey
We are foot soldiers of evil
Soldiers waging an incendiary war
Follow us and fight with me
In the Devil's infantry
The Devil's infantry

Awaiting instruction we rise to his call
Unleashing Hellfire and death onto all
As martyr's we'll strike at our foe as we fall

Fight (or fall)
March (don't crawl)
Obey
We are fool soldiers of evil
Soldiers waging an incendiary war
Follow us and fight with me
In the Devil's infantry

How can they fight what they cannot see
Unholy war brings unholy victory
The god that they worship will not keep them safe
Let them pacify while we annihilate

The day of ascension to battle won't wait
If death should take us it's all down to fate
Together we'll reside in the kingdom of hate
Fight (or fall)
March (don't crawl)
Obey (and die)
We are fool soldiers of evil
Soldiers waging an incendiary war
Signed up for eternity
In the Devil's infantry
The Devil's infantry
Rise to his call
