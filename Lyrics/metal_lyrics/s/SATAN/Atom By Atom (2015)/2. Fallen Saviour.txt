An epitaph for a legend
The icon of his time
Guiding light of millions
Cut down in his prime
Oh how they wept
Oh how they prayed
That he's remain among them
Their fallen saviour
Fallen saviour, who will save you now

Struck down by his absence
The king's voice now unheard
Deafened by the silence
The echo od his words
How they still prayed
Some still believed
That he'd return to save them
Their fallen saviour
Fallen savour, who will save you now

The world upon his shoulders
Taken all too soon
A vision soaring skywards
Higher than the moon
What could have been
Where did he go
His spirit never left them
Fallen saviour
Fallen saviour
who will save you now
who will save you now

Fallen saviour
Fallen saviour
who will save you now
who will save you now
