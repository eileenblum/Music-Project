The more you live the more i die
The more you fade the more I thrive
The more you're freed the more I'm chained
Each loss to you becomes my gain
Make no mistake my friend
This is a fight to the end

We are bound in enmity
Mutual hate
Such bitter enmity
On one thing we relate
The need to annihilate

Your victory my deepest fear
To see me fail would make your year
Each word I hear of your success
Kills me inside I must confess
This war will never end until one of us is in the ground

We are bound in enmity
Mutual hate
Such bitter enmity
Of one thing we are sure
A full scale all our war

Don't come to me to call a truce
Just cause your neck is in the noose
Seems like I've nothing more to prove
See how I thwart your every move
Suddenly you counter attack and it all begins again

We are bound in enmity
Mutual hate
Such bitter enmity
On one thing we relate
The need to annihilate
On one thing we agree
We are bound in enmity
Bitter enmity
