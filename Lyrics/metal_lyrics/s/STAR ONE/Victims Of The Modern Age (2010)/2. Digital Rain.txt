[Dan SwanÃ¶:]Â 
Something is not right here
is racking my mind
it's all around me, I feel it inside
like I'm locked in some prisonÂ 
and my world is a lie
chills my emotion, blinding in my eyesÂ 

[Damian Wilson:]
Let go of your anger, empty your mind
return to your senses, accept what you find
you are here for a reason
cut through these lies
lives are in danger, open up your eyes!

[Russell Allen:]
Reach for the answer - digital rain
take your chances and taste the pain

[Russell Allen &amp; Floor Jansen]:
open up your mind
don't trust your senses
you have been blind - digital rain

[Russell Allen:]
Awaken the sleeper - digital rain
dig down deeper and break the chain

[Russell Allen &amp; Floor Jansen]:
let the truth flood in
tear down your fences
the search begins - digital rain

[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
I've entered the real world, I know what to do
the search is over, the prediction is true

[Damian Wilson:]
Many millions of people exploited like slavesÂ 
but you can release them
from their digital graves

[Damian Wilson:]
Let go of your anger
empty your mind
return to your senses
accept what you find
you are here for a reason

[Russell Allen:]
Open up your mind

[Damian Wilson:]
Cut through these lies

[Russell Allen:]
Don't trust your senses

[Damian Wilson:]
Lives are in danger

[Russell Allen:]
you have been blind

[Damian Wilson:]
Open up your eyes

[Russell Allen:]
digital rain

[Damian Wilson &amp; Dan SwanÃ¶]:
I've entered the real world

[Russell Allen:]
awaken the sleeper

[Damian Wilson:]
I know what to do

[Russell Allen:]
digital rain

[Damian Wilson &amp; Dan SwanÃ¶:]
the search is over

[Russell Allen:]
dig down deeper

[Damian Wilson &amp; Dan SwanÃ¶:]
the prediction is true

[Russell Allen:]
and break the chain

[Damian Wilson &amp; Dan SwanÃ¶:]
many millions of peopleÂ 

[Russell Allen &amp; Floor Jansen]:
let the truth flood in

[Damian Wilson &amp; Dan SwanÃ¶:]
exploited like slaves

[Russell Allen &amp; Floor Jansen]:
tear down your fences

[Damian Wilson &amp; Dan SwanÃ¶:]
can release them

[Russell Allen &amp; Floor Jansen]:
the search begins

[Damian Wilson &amp; Dan SwanÃ¶:]
from their digital graves

[Russell Allen:]
DIGITAL RAIN!
