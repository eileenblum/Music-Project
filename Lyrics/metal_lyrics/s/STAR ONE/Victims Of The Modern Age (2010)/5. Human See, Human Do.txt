[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Where do you come from, where is your tribe?
you should not be here, you can't be aliveÂ 
a vicious killer, you'll never be tamedÂ 
you belong in this cage

[Damian Wilson:]
Why do you fear me, what have I done?
I mean no harm, never hurt anyone
I'm not a liar, what proof do you need?Â 
how can I make you believe?

[Russell Allen:]
Drive him back, he must be the last
from beyond the zone
save our future, bury our past
it must never be known

[Floor Jansen:]
Beware the beast, there's danger in his eyesÂ 
I see the truth slipping through
beware the beast, don't believe his liesÂ 
human see, human do

[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Your proof is empty, conjecture at best
you're not superior, we're not impressedÂ 
go find your fate, the lot of mankind
you won't like what you findÂ 

[Damian Wilson:]
Your scrolls are lying, man was here first
we are superior, just like on earth
you know the secret, why can't you share?Â 
tell me why you're so scared!Â 

[Russell Allen:]Â 
Drive him back, he must be the last
from beyond the zone
save our future, bury our past
it must never be known

[Floor Jansen:]
Beware the beast, there's danger in his eyesÂ 
I see the truth slipping through
beware the beast, don't believe his liesÂ 
human see, human do

[Dan SwanÃ¶:]Â 
See no evil
hear no evil
speak no evil
do no evil

[Russell Allen:]Â 
Drive him back, he must be the last
from beyond the zone
save our future, bury our past
it must never be known

[Floor Jansen:]
Beware the beast, there's danger in his eyesÂ 
I see the truth slipping through
beware the beast, don't believe his liesÂ 
human see, human do
