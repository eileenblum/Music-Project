[Bonus Track][originally by Emerson, Lake and Palmer][Damian Wilson:]
Just a step cried the sad man
Take a look down at the madman
Hear the king's son
Silver wings fly beyond reason
From the plight of the seagull

[Damian Wilson and Arjen Lucassen:]
Come the spread claws of the eagle

[Damian Wilson:]
Only fear breaks the silence
As we all kneel pray for guidance

[Damian Wilson:]
Thread the rope cross the abyss
Take a look down at the madness
On the streets of the city
Only specters still have pity
Patient queues for the gallows

[Damian Wilson and Arjen Lucassen:]
Sing the praises of the hallowed

[Damian Wilson:]
Our machines feed the furnace
If they take us they will burn us

[Floor Jansen:]
Will you still know who you are
When you come to who you are?

[Russell Allen:]
When the flames have their season
Will you hold to your reason?
Loaded down with your talents
Can you still keep your balance?
Can you live on a knife-edge?
