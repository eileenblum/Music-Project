[Damian Wilson:]Â 
Mother Earth couldn't take no more
sucked dry by humanity
in the end she lost a fight
she was never going to win

we set out for distant shores
far across our galaxy
we're taking flight into the night
to the planets on the rim

a fire in the darkness
far away from the Earth that Was
a quest for freedom in the "Verse
seeking refuge from the earth

a fire in the darkness
a bright light on the edge of space
a desperate need to find our place
in the emptiness of space

[Damian Wilson:]

Out here on the fringe of spaceÂ 
the outskirts of society
we're suffering the aftermath
of a cataclysmic war

cast out by the human race
nine outlaw pioneers
making life in the outer worlds
running from the law

a fire in the darknessÂ 
far away from the Earth that Was
a quest for freedom in the "Verse
seeking refuge from the earth

a fire in the darkness
a bright light on the edge of space
a desperate need to find our place
in the emptiness of space

[Russell Allen:]Â 
I see a fire in the darkness
a ray of hope in a black forbidding night
I see a fire in the darkness
a spark of life in a cold and empty sky

A fire in the darknessÂ 
far away from the Earth that Was
a quest for freedom in the "Verse
seeking refuge from the earth

A fire in the darknessÂ 
a bright light on the edge of space
a desperate need to find our place
in the emptiness of space

A fire in the darknessÂ 
far away from the Earth that Was
a quest for freedom in the "Verse
seeking refuge from the earth

A fire in the darknessÂ 
a bright light on the edge of space
a desperate need to find our place
in the emptiness of space
