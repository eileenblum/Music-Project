[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Man is declining, man is dying out
generation of despair
man has no future, man is crying out
echoes in the empty air

[Russell Allen:]
Mother Nature's striking back, protecting her domainÂ 
the last generation fades away
[Floor Jansen:]
we're the generation of despairÂ 
[Damian Wilson:]
but we must not give up hope, for man can be revived
it's alive, she's alive, we're alive!Â 

[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Man surrenders, man is giving in
our world is breaking down
man has no tomorrow, man has died within
this is our final hour

[Russell Allen:]
Mother Nature's changing course, preserving her own homeÂ 
the last generation's on its ownÂ 
[Floor Jansen:]
we're the generation of despairÂ 
[Damian Wilson:]
but we can't give in to failure, man can still surviveÂ 
it's alive, she's alive, we're alive!
