[Bonus disc track]

[Arjen Lucassen]
No cold or hunger
No need to suffer
But you're just a number
In a human shell

Your every desire
And all you require
Still you grow tired
Of this earthly hell

A perfect balance in what seems a perfect home
A shadow looms over this crystal dome
The death of freedom is too high a price to pay
Enjoy your last day

You live for the moment (Carousel's a lie)
Your time is stolen (everybody dies)
The system is broken (now you realize)
There's no way out (dystopian utopia on Earth)

A perfect balance in what seems a perfect life
A shadow looms over this paradise
The death of freedom is too high a price to pay
Enjoy your last day
