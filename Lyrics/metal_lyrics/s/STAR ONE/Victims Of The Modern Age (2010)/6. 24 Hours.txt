[Damian Wilson:]Â 
A crime-ridden city
confined within these walls
a place without pity
a place of sin...

No rules apply here
among this desperate crowd
once you go in
you are never coming out

[Russell Allen:]
You've got 24 hoursÂ 
to change the course of history
just 24 hours, your time is running out!

You've got 24 hoursÂ 
to trace our man and set him free
our very last chance
our fate is in your hands!

[Damian Wilson:]
You're trapped on this islandÂ 
your life ticking away
this hotbed of violence
could be your grave...

you're on your own hereÂ 
no one to save your skin
you better give up
cos there is no way you can winÂ 

[Russell Allen:]Â 
You've got 24 hoursÂ 
to change the course of history
just 24 hours, your time is running out!

You've got 24 hoursÂ 
to trace our man and set him free
our very last chance
our fate is in your hands!

[Dan SwanÃ¶:]Â 
Too many died for an empty cause
too many died all in vain
too many died for your senseless laws
count me out, I will never be a part of this game

[Floor Jansen:]
Too many died for an empty cause
too many died all in vain
too many died for your senseless laws
count me out, I will never be a part of this game
