[Dan SwanÃ¶:]Â 
Lies - fictitious dreams - false illusions
[Russell Allen:]
living life with nothing to gain
[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Eyes - synthetic tears - hollow visionsÂ 
[Russell Allen:]
Moments lost, like tears in the rainÂ 
[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Life - a vacuous truth - a simulationÂ 
[Russell Allen:]
Watching dreams break down an decayÂ 
[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Survive - a desperate hope - strange desiresÂ 
[Russell Allen:]
Can't give up, there must be a wayÂ 

[Floor Jansen:]
I think therefore I am
am I more human than a man?Â 
I think therefore I am
but will they ever understand?

[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
Pain - living in fear - no compassion
[Russell Allen:]
facing death with nothing to lose
[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
sustain - future-less world - cold deceptionÂ 
[Russell Allen:]
no way out, whatever we do
[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
why? - meaningless words - empty promises
[Russell Allen:]
is this real or this is a lie?
[Dan SwanÃ¶:]
deny - darkening skies - twisted emotions
[Russell Allen:]
will I dream, or will I just die?

[Damian Wilson:]
four years slipped by too fast
four years, without a past
and a future we'll never know
four years is all we had
four years, no second chance
there is nowhere left to go

[Russell Allen:]
Living a life with nothing left to gain
moments are lost, like tears in the rain
watching my dreams break down and decay
I can't give up, there must be a way
facing death with nothing to lose
no way out, no matter what we try to do
is this real or this is a lie?
will I dream, or will I just die?

[Damian Wilson:]Â 
Four years, we were almost there
[Russell Allen:]
four years, no time to spare
[Floor Jansen:]
four years, beyond repair
[Damian &amp; Russell:]
is it wrong? does anyone care?

[Damian Wilson:]
Four years of living in fear
[Russell Allen:]
four years, death is near
[Floor Jansen:]
four years disappeared
[Damian and Russell]:
can't believe i all ends here
