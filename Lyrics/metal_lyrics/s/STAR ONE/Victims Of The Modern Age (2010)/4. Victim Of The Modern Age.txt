[Russell]:Â 
Prowling 'round the city slums, hungry for distraction
lashings of violence fire me up inside
A dose of nasty, some "social interaction'
cry out, have a laugh, never, ever holding back

[Russell]:
Ripping through the countryside, dying for some dangerÂ 
the sound of symphonies sends shivers up my spine
beat up some loser, harass some random stranger
fly high, feel no pain, I'm singing singing in the rain

[Damian]:
You're just a child who's lost his wayÂ 
[Dan]:
a wandering soul led astray
[Floor]:
but we all know what's right for you!
[Damian and Dan]:
You're just a child consumed by rageÂ 
[Dan]:
a victim of a modern age

[Damian]:
You're just a child who had no choiceÂ 
[Dan]:
a mindless pawn without a voiceÂ 
[Floor]:
but we all know what's right for you!
[Damian and Dan]:
a restless mind trapped in this cage
[Floor]:
a victim of a modern age

[Russell]:
I am not an evil man, I swear to you, my brothers
I've learned my lesson now, I have changed my ways
I was merely blinded by the treachery of others
hell yeah, now I am sure, I survived, I am cured!Â 

[Damian]:Â 
You're just a child who's lost his wayÂ 
[Dan]:
a wandering soul led astray
[Floor]:
but we all know what's right for you!
[Damian and Dan]:
You're just a child consumed by rageÂ 
[Dan]:
a victim of a modern age

[Damian]:
You're just a child who had no choiceÂ 
[Dan]:
a mindless pawn without a voiceÂ 
[Floor]:
but we all know what's right for you!
[Damian and Dan]:
a restless mind trapped in this cage
[Floor]:
a victim of a modern age

[Dan]:Â 
violence makes violence

[Damian]:Â 
You're just a child who's lost his way
[Dan]:
a wandering soul led astray
[Floor]:
but we all know what's right for you!
[Damian and Dan]:
You're just a child consumed by rage
[Dan]:
a victim of a modern age

[Damian]:Â 
You're just a child who had no choice
[Dan]:
a mindless pawn without a voice
[Floor]:
but we all know what's right for you!
[Damian and Dan]:
a restless mind trapped in this cage
[Floor]:
a victim of a modern age

[Russell]:Â 
I am not an evil man
I swear to you, my brothers
I'm still singing in the rain
and I'm singing in the rain
