[Russell Allen:]Â 
You are a beautiful woman in a beautiful world
but your world is gonna die
I have seen the human race
drop dead in the blink of an eye

[Floor Jansen:]
You created this dream out of bits and pieces
filed away in your mind
you're caught inside a fantasyÂ 
but we'll find the truth insideÂ 

[Russell Allen:]
You gotta hear me out, though you wouldn't understandÂ 
I came back to the past
I have come to save our world
time's up, so we better move fastÂ 

[Floor Jansen:]
I want to help you deal with the rage you feel
it's still not too lateÂ 
you created your own world
but it's starting to disintegrate!Â 

[Damian Wilson:]
Cassandra complex, everlasting scream
we can change the future but we can't change the pastÂ 
Cassandra complex, ever-changing dream
we can shape the present but we can't make it lastÂ 

[Russell Allen:]
I think you may be right, I'm insane after allÂ 
this is all in my mind
I just want to stay here with you
leave the bad dream behind

[Floor Jansen:]
No, I remember you now, guess I've always knownÂ 
yes, it was me in your dream
I won't accept that we cannot changeÂ 
the dark future you have seen!

[Damian Wilson:]
Cassandra complex, everlasting scream
we can change the future but we can't change the pastÂ 
Cassandra complex, ever-changing dream
we can shape the present but we can't make it lastÂ 

[Dan SwanÃ¶:]Â 
the planet is dying, pollution of sea and air
the people denying the death of the atmosphere
The planet is crying, the rape of ecologyÂ 
the people relying on the rise of technology
and now they have to die!

[Damian Wilson:]
Cassandra complex, everlasting scream
we can change the future but we can't change the pastÂ 
Cassandra complex, ever-changing dream
we can shape the present but we can't make it last
