[A. GATEWAY TO THE STARS]

[storyteller]
Far away in outer space
A traveller from another world left his dying race
He found our planet, full of life
In the body of a little boy he could survive

And Ra will live forever
He gains his powres from afar
And built a gateway to stars

[archaeologist]
I have finally found the key
To chart a course to the other side of the galaxy
I need to find the seventh sign
Carved into the cover stones of an ancient time

And Ra will live forever
He draws his powres from afar
And built a gateway to stars

[B. THE EYE OF RA]

[marine]
Unaware of our coming fate
We disappear through the ancient gate
We arrive in a desert land
And set up camp on the burning sand

Behold, a thousand slaves
Mining ores in the planetâs caves
They give us shelter from the storm
Then Ra appears in a human form

[native girl]
Ooh, up there in space
The eye of Ra is watching over us

[marine]
A tall ship descends from the sky
Lasers flare and many men die
A bloody battle has begun
We must destroy this âking of the sunâ

[native girl]
Ooh, up there in space
The eye of Ra is watching over us
Ooh, an alien space
The eye of Ra is watching over us

[C. THE SEVENTH SIGN]

[all]
We have found the seventh sign
Down in the catacombs
When the seven points align
They will lead us all back home
