[A. MASTER OF DARKNESS]

[apprentice]
Will you teach me the skills of the old ways
Lying dormant in me
Help me evolve and enter a new phase
Where my spirit runs free

[teacher]
I cannot teach you, I feel too much violence
And itâs clouding your view
Clear your mind, master the silence
Let it flow within you

[dark lord] I can feel a storm of passion raging deep inside you
[princess] Control your hate
[dark lord] Now itâs the time to yield to your aggression just like I do
[princess] Now choose your fate
[dark lord] And be a master of darkness

[apprentice]
Donât be afraid, I wonât stray down the dark path
My conviction is strong
Those whoâve sinned will answer to my wrath
I will right what is wrong

[teacher]
Thatâs not the way, the dark will absorb you
You should never attack
You will be lost like many before you
There will be no way back

[B. LASERFIGHT]

[apprentice] You cannot break me, Iâm not afraid of you
Donât think youâve already won
[dark lord] I am your destiny, you know it to be true
Donât make me kill you, my son

[apprentice] I donât believe your lies, I canât imagine this
How can you say that to me?
[dark lord] Youâve got to realize itâs useless to resist
Join me, weâll rule the galaxy
