[Crewmember 1:]
Out here in this spaceship
Things couldn't get much worse
Wiping out unstable planets
All across the universe

[Crewmember 2:]
Nothing seems to work right
The computer's going mad
All the systems are cracking up
And the ship's commander is dead

[Crew:]
Spaced-out, no doubt
We've all gone crazy
Spaced-out, what a crowd
We're all getting high

[Crewmember 1:]
I'm out here in this glass dome
Staring into space
Planets, stars and asteroids
Are lighting up my face

[Crewmember 2:]
I often dream of the golden beach
Where I used to spend my days
Taking out my surfing gear
And riding on the waves

[Computer:]
Emergency override

[Bomb:]
Information overload

[Computer:]
Data imprecise

[Bomb:]
But I was told to explode

[Computer:]
Emergency override

[Bomb:]
I will not comply

[Computer:]
Data imprecise

[Bomb:]
Let there be light!

[Crewmember 1:]
Out here in this galaxy
Things couldn't get much worse
Our remains are scattered
All across the universe

[Crewmember 2:]
I live my dreams of the golden beach
Where I used to spend my days
Out here on this space debris
I'm riding on the waves

[Crew:]
Spaced-out, no doubt
We've all gone crazy
Spaced-out, what a crowd
We're all getting high

Spaced-out, no doubt
Our future looks hazy
Spaced-out, I wanna shout
We're all gonna die
