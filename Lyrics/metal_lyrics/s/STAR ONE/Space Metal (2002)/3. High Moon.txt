Memories come back to me, itâs the 22nd century
Unthinkable events occur on the 3rd moon of Jupiter

[worker]
Iâd leave this hellhole if I could
The miningâs hard but the pay is good
There is only one way to survive
I take the drug to stay alive

[marshal]
The shuttlecraft has landed, the killers have arrived
I know Iâm alone here, there is no one on my side
Iâm ready for the showdown, so let the chase begin
I will not be defeated
I have made a solemn vow to leave here soon

[marshalâs wife]
High moon

[storyteller]
The company is trying to hide the higher rates of suicide
Thereâs no pain and much to gain,
But then the drug destroys their brain

[worker]
I gotta leave this evil place
I donât belong in outer space
Outside itâs zero atmosphere
The only way to get out of here

[storyteller]
He had to choose between his part in this machine
Or going back with her to Earth
He never had a choice, but when he heard her voice
He fought for all that he was worth

[marshal]
I had to choose, I could not lose
Had to get back to you
I had no choice, I heard your voice
I had to survive, had to stay alive
