[leader]
I have seen vision in a waking dream
I have seen places man has never seen
Am I the one to fulfill the prophecy
On the desert planet in our galaxy

[nomads]
Sandrider, stormfighter
Unlock the chains and set us free
Sandrider, uniter
Guide us the way and make us see

[leader]
I have seen navigators bridging space
I have seen the baron and his evil ways
Forging plans against the planetâs nomad tribes
And in this dream Iâve seen my father die

[nomad girl]
Drink the water of life
The sleeper comes alive
Drink the water of life
Only youâll survive

[leader]
I have seen the creatures in the desert sand
I have seen them yielding under my command
One day the universe will be cleansed
One day my fatherâs death will be avenged
