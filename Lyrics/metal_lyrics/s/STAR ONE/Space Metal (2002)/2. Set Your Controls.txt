[Russel]
Welcome aboard, let me draw you deep inside
The dark caves of my twisted mind
Welcome aboard, take a seat and dim the light

[Floor]
Empty your mind, sit back and hold on tight

[Russel]
Break away through the walls of reality
Enter the realm on the other side
Break away from the cold rationality
Now is the time to open up your mind

[Damian]
Set your controls
Enter a date and see what our future holds
What kind of fate awaits us there in the night
As we dissolve into the light

Set your controls
Enter a place and witness mysteries unfold
Dangers weâll face as our engines ignite
Blazing our way into the light

[Floor]
Set your controls

[Russel]
Throw the switch, get ready for some turbulence
Brace yourself with all your might
Throw the switch and tempt the laws of providence

[Floor]
Empty your mind, sit back and hold on tight

[Russel]
Turn the dials and watch the years go by
Light years away, far beyond our sun
Turn the dials, into the void we fly
Thereâs no way back once it has begun

[Dan]
The die is cast
You fade to black
Forget the past
Thereâs no way back
