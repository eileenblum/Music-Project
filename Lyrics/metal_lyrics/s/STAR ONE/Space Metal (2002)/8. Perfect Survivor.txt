[captain]
We wake up in our spaceship from a year in hypersleep. On our way back to our system we receive a message from an uncharted planet. We decide to go in. We see a giant spacecraft whose crew has been hideously killed.

[android]
Absolute perfection
I find it hard to escape its attraction
Its strength and genius unhampered by morality
My secret mission brings me back to reality
I have to bring it back alive

[third officer] Perfect survivor
[crew member] Of an alien hostile race
[third officer] Perfect survivor
[crew member] Of a human crew in outer space

[captain]
We return to our spaceship and break the quarantine. A strange unknown creature has invaded our ship and now itâs killing us slowly. Weâre dying one by one. There is no way to stop it. Most of us have given up all hope.

[android]
The ship is indefensible
You should know that you all are expendable
My sole objective is to offer it protection
I have been programmed to put you out of action
If Iâm to bring it back alive
