[MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE]

I am the creator of this universe
The wind of time is blowing through me
And it's all moving relative to me
It's all a figment of my mind

In a world that I've designed
I'm charged with cosmic energy
Has the world gone mad or is it me?

[SILVER MACHINE]

I got a silver machine - silver machine [4X]

[PSYCHEDELIC WARLORDS (Disappear In Smoke)]

We're sick of politicians harassment and laws
all we do is get screwed up by other people's flaws
World turned upside down, nothing else to do

But live in concrete jungles and they block up the view
And that ain't no joke, you can disappear in smoke
And that ain't no joke, you can disappear in smoke
I'm telling you, that it ain't no lie

You think you know the answers, we don't tell no lies
We can take you anyway through seven different highs
World turned upside down now, nothing else to do
but live in concrete jungles and they block up the view

[BRAINSTORM]

Standing on the runway waiting for takeoff
I wanna fly, wanna watch me flake off
I can't move 'cause the man has a rake off
you gotta help me, help me to shake off

This body of mine I wanna get out of this void
This body of mine and I don't wanna be destroyed
this body of mine I don't wanna turn android
This body of mine you gotta help me avoid that

Brainstorm here I go
Brainstorm flying low
Brianstorm I wanna miss it
Brianstorm you'd bet I'd kiss it

[ASSAULT AND BATTERY]

Lives of great men all remind us we may make our lives sublime
And departing leave behind us footprints in the sands of time
Of hewn stones the sacred circle where the wizened sages sat
Let us try to remember all the times where they were at.

So your thoughts they were expecting assault and battery on the human anatomy
Assault and battery on the human anatomy man.

[THE WAR I SURVIVED]

Death comes like a glacier from the peaks of all wars
reason and logic the generals cry "more"
bodies in gullies contortionist poses
fogged by the sent of mustard gas and roses

take me back to the war I survived
gather them all into slaughterhouse five

Take me back to the war I survived I can't live no more, this is
slaughterhouse five

[SPACE IS DEEP - instrumental riff]

Take me back to the war I survived I can't live no more, this is
slaughterhouse five

Take me back to the war I survived I can't live no more, this is
slaughterhouse five

There's only bombs, no one's left alive Take me back to the war I survived
These were people like you and I Take me back to the war I survived

[SPIRIT OF THE AGE]

Spirit of the age
It's the spirit of the age

[LOST CHRONICLES - instrumental outro]
