[science officer]
As we return to Earth, memories are haunting me
My strange rebirth, coming back to life
I remember the dark and how my friends set me free
I sacrificed my life so they could survive

[communications officer]
Thereâs something wrong on planet Earth
We can not reach our world
Some strange device slowly emerged
Can you hear the cries

Thereâs something wrong, what can we do?
We canât communicate
All systems fail, all power too
We canât reply

[science officer]
It must be unaware of the damage itâs creating
They are reaching out to the seven seas
Itâs not with man theyâre communicating
Weâre going back in time, back in history

[captain] We shape life, we travel space
But we donât know the words to the songs of the ocean
[doctor] We survived the âhuman raceâ
But we donât know the words to the songs of the ocean
