[Earthman:]
This is the end of bloodshed and wars
We finally found peace
Side by side we explore the stars
Then we came to know that we are not alone

Light years away in a fortress in space
A place we call home
We're at war with an alien race
Many men died in a blood-red sky

[Alien:]
Inseparable enemies, two sworn friends
Inseparable enemies, friends 'till the end

[Storyteller:]
Is this the end of their crusade
The dawning of a new day
The birth of a brand new age
The turning of a new page

[Earthman:]
We're all alone on this hostile planet

[Alien:]
I try to speak but you don't understand it

[Earthman:]
But you are trying to take my life

[Alien:]
I'm only trying to survive

[Earthman:]
We must find shelter from the storm

[Alien:]
Build a cabin to keep us warm

[Earthman:]
I can't do this on my own

[Alien + Earthman:]
You and me, we are not alone

[Earthman: Russell (+ad libs)]
[Alien: Damian]
[Storyteller: Floor]
