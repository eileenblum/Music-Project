Weâre on our way to a prison in space
Our last flight, the final phase
I was betrayed and now Iâve been caught
As the brains of a massive fraud

[idealist]
I canât remember, am I insane?
My mind is blank cos they emptied my brain
I will return, I will be back
I will unite us and we will attack

[loner]
I donât care about your plans and schemes
Donât give a damn âbout your righteous dreams
All that I do, I do for myself
I never cared for anyone else

[idealist]
We have to save them, we have to try
We canât just watch while the innocent die
Letâs steal this ship and start our crusade
Powerful allies will come to our aid

[loner] Seven fighters
[idealist] Navigators
[crew] Intergalactic space crusaders
[loner] Federation
[idealist] Dictators
[crew] No scruples, lethal traitors
[loner] Outriders
[idealist] Invaders
[crew] Intergalactic space crusaders
[loner] Domination
[idealist] Liberators
[crew] Fighting to survive

[loner]
Who on Earth do you think that you are
Without me you wouldnât get far
Iâve had enough of your private war
Why are we fighting, what is it all for

[idealist]
To right the wrong, to fight a good fight
Living like you just wouldnât be right
I am the leader, I have the skills
Either you leave or you yield to my will

[loner]
I canât believe you gave us away
Although it hurts, I will make you pay
Donât understand, canât figure out why
All I know, you have to die!

[idealist]
Our strong bond couldnât keep us apart
Iâve always trusted you right from the start
Youâve been deceived, theyâre telling you lies
Iâm still the same, Iâm on your side
