[A. One by Four by Nine]

[Messenger:]
Touch me now and feel my force
I will give you life
History will change its course
Man will survive
[Computer:]
Something's strange, I'm so confused, I don't know why
[Storyteller:] (secrets have not been told)
[Computer:]
I've been designed to tell the truth, I cannot lie
[Storyteller:] (when will the truth unfold?)
[Computer:]
I heard the news, a mystery, a strange device
[Storyteller:] (what does the future hold?)
[Computer:]
I'm so afraid, I just can't see through all these lies
[Storyteller:] (behold this alien messenger)
[Computer:]
is this a cosmic design?
[Storyteller:] (the bringer of a new day)
[Computer:]
one by four by nine
[Messenger:]
Reach out to me and seal your fate
A new phase is near
Come to me and cross the gate
No pain, no fear

[B. Starchild]

[Commander:]
A strange signal, beamed out in space
From the face of the moon
Harbinger of a new race
We'll be evolving soon
I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
Of the Starchild
I have entered another dimension
My perception expands
Transcending beyond comprehension
Evolution of man?

[C. A New Sun]

[Messenger:]
Time has come, a brand new sun
Shining down on you
The reign of peace has now begun
Dreams have come true
[Computer:]
I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
Of the Starchild
