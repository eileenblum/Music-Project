[Robert:]
Far away in outer space
A traveller from another world left his dying race
He found our planet, full of life
In the body of a little boy he could survive

And Ra will live forever
He gains his powers from afar
And built a gateway to the stars

[Damian:]
I have finally found the key
To chart a course to the other side of the galaxy
I need to find the seventh sign
Carved into the cover stones of an ancient time

And Ra will live forever
He draws his powers from afar
And built a gateway to the stars

[Russell:]
Unaware of our coming fate
We disappear through the ancient gate
We arrive in a desert land
And set up camp on the burning sand

[Floor:]
Behold!

[Russell:]
A thousand slaves
Mining ores in the planet's caves
They give us shelter from the storm
Then Ra appears in a human form

[Floor:]
Ooh, up there in space
The Eye of Ra is watching over us

[Russell:]
A tall ship descends from the sky
Lasers flare and many men die
A bloody battle has begun
We must destroy this 'king of the sun'

[Floor:]
Ooh, up there in space
The Eye of Ra is watching over us
Ooh, an alien race
The Eye of Ra is watching over us

[Floor:]
Ooh, up there in space
The Eye of Ra is watching over us
Ooh, an alien race
The Eye of Ra is watching over us

[All:]
We have found the seventh sign
Down in the catacombs
When the seven points align
They will lead us all back home

We have found the seventh sign
Down in the catacombs
When the seven points align
They will lead us all back home

We have found the seventh sign
Down in the catacombs
When the seven points align
They will lead us all back home

We have found the seventh sign
Down in the catacombs
When the seven points align
They will lead us all back home
