This is the voice of Merlin. listen well, for it concerns you. This chronicle commences in the year 2084 a.d. Mankind has virtually
destroyed itself. It's survival depends on 'the final experiment'. Let us go back to the dark ages...dark ages...dark ages...

[Russell:]
A cry in the silence
A shine in the dark
Like a rising star
The dream is coming 

Images of violence
A flight through time and space
It's such a lonely place
The dream has started 

[Russell and Floor:]
The smoke is rising
The vision's getting clearer
And words become a song

[Russell:]
In the dreamtime 

I've lost control
Marooned and cold
I suffer the fears
Of a future untold
I cannot change
The shape of things to come

[Russell and Floor:]
The smoke is rising
The vision's getting clearer
And words become a song

[Russell:]
In the dreamtime
