[Russell:]
Welcome aboard, let me draw you deep inside
The dark caves of my twisted mind
Welcome aboard, take a seat and dim the light

[Floor and Russell:]
Empty your mind, sit back and hold on tight

[Russell:]
Break away through the walls of reality
Enter the realm on the other side
Break away from the cold rationality
Now is the time to open up your mind

[Damian and Floor:]
Set your controls
Enter a date and see what our future holds
What kind of fate awaits us there in the night
As we dissolve into the light

Set your controls
Enter a place and witness mysteries unfold
Dangers we'll face as our engines ignite
Blazing our way into the light

[Floor:]
Set your controls

[Russell:]
Throw the switch, get ready for some turbulence
Brace yourself with all your might
Throw the switch and tempt the laws of providence

[Floor and Russell:]
Empty your mind, sit back and hold on tight

[Russell:]
Turn the dials and watch the years go by
Light years away, far beyond our sun
Turn the dials, into the void we fly
There's no way back once it has begun

[Damian and Floor:]
Set your controls
Enter a date and see what our future holds
What kind of fate awaits us there in the night
As we dissolve into the light

Set your controls
Enter a place and witness mysteries unfold
Dangers we'll face as our engines ignite
Blazing our way into the light

[Floor:]
Set your controls

[Robert:]
The die is cast
You fade to black
Forget the past
There's no way back
The die is cast
You fade to black
Forget the past
There's no way back

[Ad Libs Russell]

Blazing our way into the light
