[Robert:]
Cries from the grave resound in my ears
They hail from beyond my darkest fears
Faces of the past are etched in my brain
The women I raped, the men I've slain

[Robert and Floor:]
Shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
Demons dance in the castle hall

[Damian:]
I call upon the sword, the mighty Excalibur
Grant me the skill to fulfill my quest
I call upon my king and the knights of the table round
Grant me the courage to stand to this test

I call upon the seer, Merlin the sorcerer
Grant me the magic to end my pain
I call upon the spirit that lives in a noble heart
grant me the passion that's within my veins

[Damian and Floor:]
Shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
Demons dance in the castle hall

[Robert:]
Cries from the grave resound in my ears
They hail from beyond my darkest fears

[Damian:]
I call upon the seer, Merlin the sorcerer
Grant me the magic to end my pain
Faces of the past are etched in my brain
I call upon the spirit that lives in a noble heart
The women I raped, the men I've slain
grant me the passion that's within my veins

[Robert and Damian and Floor:]
Shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
Demons dance in the castle hall
