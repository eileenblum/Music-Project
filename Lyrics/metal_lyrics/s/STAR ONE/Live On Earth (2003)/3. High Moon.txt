[Robert:]
Memories come back to me, it's the 22nd century
Unthinkable events occur on the 3rd moon of Jupiter

[Russell:]
I'd leave this hellhole if I could
The mining's hard but the pay is good
There is only one way to survive
I take the drug to stay alive

[Damian:]
The shuttlecraft has landed, the killers have arrived
I know I'm alone here, there is no one on my side
I'm ready for the showdown, so let the chase begin
I will not be defeated
I have made a solemn vow to leave here soon

[Floor:]
High moon
High moon
High moon
High moon

[Robert:]
The company is trying to hide the higher rates of suicide
There's no pain and much to gain, but then the drug destroys their brain
[Russell:]
I gotta leave this evil place
I don't belong in outer space
Outside it's zero atmosphere
The only way to get out of here

[Damian:]
The shuttlecraft has landed, the killers have arrived
I know I'm alone here, there is no one on my side
I'm ready for the showdown, so let the chase begin
I will not be defeated
I have made a solemn vow to leave here soon

[Floor:]
High Moon 

[Robert:]
He had to choose between his part in this machine
Or going back with her to earth
He never had a choice, but when he heard her voice
He fought for all that he was worth
He had to choose between his part in this machine 

[Damian:]
I had to choose, I could not lose
Or going back with her to earth
Had to get back to you
He never had a choice, but when he heard her voice
I had no choice, I heard your voice
He fought for all that he was worth
I had to survive, had to stay alive

[Floor:]
High moon
High moon

[Ad libs Russell]

[Damian:]
The shuttlecraft has landed, the killers have arrived
I know I'm alone here, there is no one on my side
I'm ready for the showdown, so let the chase begin
I will not be defeated
I have made a solemn vow to leave here soon
