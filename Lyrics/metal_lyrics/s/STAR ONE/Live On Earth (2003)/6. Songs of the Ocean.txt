[Robert:]
As we return to earth, memories are haunting me
My strange rebirth, coming back to life
I remember the dark and how my friends set me free
I sacrificed my life so they could survive

[Floor:]
There's something wrong on planet Earth
We can not reach our world
Some strange device slowly emerged
Can you hear the cries?

There's something wrong, what can we do?
We can't communicate
All systems fail, all power too
We can't reply

[Robert:]
It must be unaware of the damage it's creating
They are reaching out to the seven seas
It's not with man they're communicating
We're going back in time, back in history

[Floor:]
There's something wrong, what can we do?
We can't communicate
All systems fail, all power too
We can't reply

[Russell and Damian:]
We shape life, we travel space
But we don't know the words to the songs of the ocean
We survived the 'human race'
But we don't know the words to the songs of the ocean

[Floor:]
There's something wrong on planet Earth
We can't reply

[Russell and Damian:]
We shape life, we travel space
But we don't know the words to the songs of the ocean
We survived the 'human race'
But we don't know the words to the songs of the ocean
