There is danger ahead, but do not be afraid for I am with you like like breath itself. Darkness will lead to light, colour will bleed
into the night- beautiful colours the like of which you have never seen. Let the dream of confusion lead you into the virgin light. Be
gone, be all-seeing, be brave... be gone...

[Robert:]
I'm looking 'round bewildered
Is this some dark and evil jest?
What brought me to this cursed keep
Perchance some crazy quest

God forbid I am no coward!
Pitted against monster, man or ghost
I'd wield my blade with crimson gusto
For I am the proud barbarian host!

[Arjen:]
Hey dude, you're so uncool
But hey, that's alright
Like there's no need to get uptight
My eyes reflect the stars
And a smile lights up my face
We're on an amazing flight in space

[Robert:]
I shook city walls and towers
Wreaking havoc in the streets
Burned palaces of cow'rdly kings
Not a one stood up to me (fools)

Bear bloody banners in blazing skies
Brandish battle-axe and broadsword
Let drums of glory sound like thunder!
Hail!! barbaric warlord!!

[Arjen:]
Hey dude, you're so uncool
But hey, that's alright
Like there's no need to get uptight
My eyes reflect the stars
And a smile lights up my face
We're on an amazing flight in space

[Robert:]
I rode my black stallion with grim determination
Carved out a kingdom where I chose to settle down
Righteous man would hang me, but I'd give 'em hell to pay
Cos nothing is as dangerous as a barbarian at bay
