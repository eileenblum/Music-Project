[Damian:]
I cannot see with these eyes
My world is dark
Like a cold eternal night

I could not tell you no lies
My words are lost
In a shroud of mystery

[Floor:]
Tell me what you see

[Damian:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time

[Floor:]
Tell me what you feel

[Damian:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind

[Floor:]
From the eyes of time

[Damian:]
I do not know where I am
I'm lost in time
Drifting in eternity

I cannot tell if it's real
Or fantasy
Or a view of things to come

[Floor:]
Tell me what you see

[Damian:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time

[Floor:]
Tell me what you feel

[Damian:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind

[Floor:]
From the eyes of time

[Robert:]
I'm still trying to understand
Why do I see the things I see
Could it be a future world
That's warning us through me
I'm still trying to understand
Why do I know the things I know
Does it mean I'm a god
Will nobody tell me so?

[Floor:]
Tell me what you see

[Damian:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time

[Floor:]
Tell me what you feel

[Damian:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind

[Floor:]
Tell me what you see

[Damian:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time

[Floor:]
Tell me what you feel

[Damian:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind
