[Damian:]
We're on our way to a prison in space
Our last flight, the final phase
I was betrayed and now I've been caught
As the brains of a massive fraud

[Russell:]
I can't remember, am I insane?
My mind is blank cos they emptied my brain
I will return, I will be back
I will unite us and we will attack

[Damian:]
I don't care about your plans and schemes
Don't give a damn 'bout your righteous dreams
All that I do, I do for myself
I never cared for anyone else

[Russell:]
We have to save them, we have to try
We can't just watch while the innocent die
Let's steal this ship and start our crusade
Powerful allies will come to our aid

[Damian:]
Who on earth do you think that you are
Without me you wouldn't get far
I've had enough of your private war
Why are we fighting, what is it all for?

[Russell:]
To right the wrong, to fight the good fight
Living like you just wouldn't be right
I am the leader, I have the skills
Either you leave or you yield to my will

I can't believe you gave us away
Although it hurts, I will make you pay
Don't understand, can't figure out why
All I know, you have to die!

[Russell:]
Our strong bond couldn't keep us apart
I've always trusted you right from the start
You've been deceived, they're telling you lies
I'm still the same, I'm on your side
