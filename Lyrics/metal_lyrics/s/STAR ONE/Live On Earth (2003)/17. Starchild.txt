[Robert:]
Touch me now and feel my force
I will give you life
History will change its course
Man will survive

[Russell:]
Something's strange, I'm so confused, I don't know why
I've been designed to tell the truth, I cannot lie
I heard the news, a mystery, a strange device
I'm so afraid, I just can't see through all these lies

[Floor:]
Behold this alien messenger

[Russell:]
Is this a cosmic design?

[Floor:]
The bringer of a new day

[Russell:]
One by four by nine

[Robert:]
Reach out to me and seal your fate
A new phase is near
Come to me and cross the gate
No pain, no fear

[Russell:]
Something's strange, I'm so confused, I don't know why

[Floor:]
Secrets have not been told

[Russell:]
I've been designed to tell the truth, I cannot lie

[Floor:]
When will the truth unfold?

[Russell:]
I heard the news, a mystery, a strange device

[Floor:]
What does the future hold?

[Russell:]
I'm so afraid, I just can't see through all these lies

[Floor:]
Behold this alien messenger

[Russell:]
Is this a cosmic design?

[Floor:]
The bringer of a new day

[Russell:]
One by four by nine

[Damian:]
A strange signal, beamed out in space
From the face of the moon
Harbinger of a new race
We'll be evolving soon

[Damian and Russell:]
I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
Of the Starchild
Starchild

[Damian:]
I have entered another dimension
My perception expands
Transcending beyond comprehension
Evolution of man?

[Damian and Russell:]
I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
Of the Starchild
Starchild

I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
Of the Starchild

[Robert:]
Time has come, a brand new sun
Shining down on you
The reign of peace has now begun
Dreams have come true

[Russell:]
I heard the news, a mystery, a strange device
I'm so afraid, I just can't see through all these lies

[Floor:]
Behold this alien messenger

[Russell:]
Is this a cosmic design?

[Floor:]
The bringer of a new day

[Russell:]
One by four by nine
One by four by nine
I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
Of the Starchild
Oh yeah
I see the world through the eyes
Of the Starchild

[Damian and Russell:]
I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
I see the future, a new star will rise
I see the world through the all-seeing eyes
Of the Starchild

[Dan Swano:]
Dreams have come true
Shining down on you
I give you life. Man will survive
