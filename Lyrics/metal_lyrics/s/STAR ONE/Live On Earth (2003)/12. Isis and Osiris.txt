[Russell:]
What heathen place is this that I've arrived in
Is now the time I pay for all my sins
I can't believe that this is God's creation
This realm was fashioned by the Deil's ane hand

[Floor:]
No it has been foretold, in our legends of old
Wake the spirit within, let the journey begin

[Russell:]
This quest you speak of is for redemption
How can we travel when our souls are lost
You think we find ourselves at gates of new salvation
When I can only sense the end is here

[Floor:]
No it has been foretold, in our legends of old
Wake the spirit within, let the journey begin

[Damian:]
We're at the gates of Avalon, the island of spirits
We're at the gates of Avalon, in search of the grail

[Robert:]
There's no way out, slaves for eternity
Down in the underworld, the jaws of Orcus
I call on Jupiter, ruler of the gods
Show us the way, from damnation to salvation

[Floor:]
The fields of Yaaru lie waiting for us all
Rejoice! the judges have ruled
We have been chosen to enter the great hall
Of Isis and Osiris

[Robert:]
No you're wrong, we're trapped here in darkness
Among departed souls, and mislaid spirits
I call on Mars, the ancient god of war
Grant me the power, to free me from this evil

[Floor:]
The fields of Yaaru lie waiting for us all
Rejoice! the judges have ruled
We have been chosen to enter the great hall
Of Isis and Osiris

[Ad lib Floor]
