Forced by suspicion the heartache is mine. I state my position, I'm losing my mind. Today is a sad day, torment, despair. My life in dismay, a tragic affair. When will it end? This heartache and pain. When will it end? Forever in shame. This empty feeling, the rain cold as ice. I stare at the ceiling with tears in my eyes. So this is misery I now know, I'm left in agony and sorrow. So this is misery, black shadow, I hear them calling me, oh God no. Down on your knees, pray for me, needles and pins. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, I'm so confused. Can't forgive, can't forget, so many many lies. Down on your knees, prey for me, enough, is enough. I live in isolation without reason, I'm living on the wire. Complete assassination, breakdown begun, body and mind entire. A morbid fascination you have undone, I feel it burning fire. All through my loneliness,, I think of you. With a trace of bitterness, I need to be with you. The bells of hell, I know them well, I can't forget. Look in my eyes, see all your lies, and my regret. This is the end, the light fading fast, I suffer alone, remember the past. Running beyond, you drift out of sight, my fear of the night, I can't fight. I see the door, in front of your face, I've lost the key, impossible case. Inside my head, so much delicate pain, again and again, it's insane. I need your help to get me out of here, I can't escape from this dark atmosphere. Suffocate under the edge of time, expectations leave me all behind. The bells of hell, I know them well. My darkest dawn, my crown of thorn, I'm tired and worn, my darkest dawn. It hurts down inside. So this is misery, I now know, I'm left in agony. So this is misery, black shadow, I hear them calling me. Help me find a way out.
