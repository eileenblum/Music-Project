Patience. This world will fall. Past the tree that is life.
Faithful sheep behold the divinity in all that is bound to fall apart.

Time will come for bearers of false witness, when their skin, serve as lining for coats.
Their tongues nailed to their doors. Their burning bodies illuminate high places.
The eradication of error is universal law.
