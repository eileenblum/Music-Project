Words trail down to crash to earth. Descending filth sun, proceed to fall.
Aeon day resolve endless night. In waste of time. In waste of life.
Scale of fate weigh what come to pass, on the stairway reaching furthest from "god".

In three counts of seven...
Erupt in disorder, illuminate the trinity, that anchors our fabric to existence.
When mountains rise within you, transcend to become all that will be.
Be loud, be slow, as the march of celestial time.
