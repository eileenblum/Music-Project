[Music: Berholtz, Dinsdale]
[Lyrics: Svensson]
[Cello: Hellgren]

A painful planet in disguise
on which I cannot breathe
Blinded by lies of light
alone in despair

Punished by my birth
slaughtered by my belief
The future is near
and with it a connected fear

Leave your sordid life
and join the dead I know

I am the god of non-divine
Drink my blood, thick of sin
Bound to my oppressed soul

Follow my hand
enter my pandemonium
to an otherwordly pain
Beyond good and evil
we will meet again
Beyond the gates of pain
