[Music: Berholtz, Dinsdale, Svensson]
[Lyrics: Svensson]

Crawling helpless through my scornful mind
looking upon my inner thoughts
Bless the stars my company in the night
Demoniaced, fettered in shackles of light

I feel rage for the disdainful burning sun
whose light makes me paralysed

Damned to live in the eternal darkness
Please just for once let me bear the sunset

A runaway in a world of sin
Alone I see the spirits fade away
Bless the stars my company in the night
Demoniaced, fettered in shackles of light

I feel rage for the disdainful burning sun
whose light makes me paralysed

The need for sorrow makes me weaker
Bring death into my heathen heartwhole soul
Unchain the shackles round my neck
Shackles that keep me fettered

Damned to live in eternal darkness
Please just for once let me bear the sunset

Bless the stars my company in the night
Demoniaced, fettered in shackles of light

Bless the stars my company in the night
Demoniaced, fettered, fettered in shackles of light...
