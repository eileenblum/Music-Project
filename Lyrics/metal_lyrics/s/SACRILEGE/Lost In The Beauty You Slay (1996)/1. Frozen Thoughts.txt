[Music: Berholtz, Dinsdale]
[Lyrics: Svensson]
[Cello: Hellgren]

Mystic night come encircle me
with your inimitable darkness
Drown me in agony and sombre thoughts

Come fourth your legions of unpurity
I'll bring myself under your domination

Just one of hundred million subjects
in your precious kingdom in the skies
Master of fire, earth, water and wind

Winter... a petrified nature in a frozen world
Silence... listen to the thunderstorm
A new star is born another's burning into oblivion

Frozen thoughts

Harden my soul
lord of north
with the frost as your sword
Just like in the mountains
where the never-melting snow is hiding the scars
of eternal torture within

[Repeat first]
