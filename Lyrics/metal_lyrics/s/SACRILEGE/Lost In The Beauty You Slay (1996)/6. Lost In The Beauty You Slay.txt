[Music: Berholtz, Dinsdale, Svensson]
[Lyrics: Dinsdale, Svensson]

Licked and seduced by cerulean waves
as I travel through millions of coloured skies
To watch and to touch the night that enslaves
and listen to choirs of tormented cries

Take me to the lake of dreams
where future turns to past
Let me taste its blood-red wine
the most intense I've ever seen

Poison me delightful wine of life
my bride in the darkest of the nights
Never again will the night turn to day
I'm lost in the beauty you slay

Lifted on tattered wings through the night
to venomous jaws of darkish delight
Never again will the night turn to day
I'm lost, I'm lost in the beauty you slay

[Repeat second-third and chorus]
