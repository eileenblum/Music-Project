[Music: Dinsdale, Svensson]

Rise, angel of night, in glamorous pride
and spread thy polluted wings
Destroy the fundamental conditions
for our existence beneath contempt

Feed me with thy blissful tears,
seduce me in nocturnal rapture
Oh, mannequin of darkness you are my immortal

Penetration in festering flesh so pale
Accompanied by orgiastic screams of ail
Together as one we deceiver the light
a sulphurous triumph for our despite

The souls that were lost will be missed by none

United in an act of endless pleasure
a sinful play of perversity
we enter the secret lotusland
where light's forever banned

Penetration in festering flesh so pale
Accompanied by orgiastic screams of ail
Together as one we deceiver the light
a sulphurous triumph for our despite
