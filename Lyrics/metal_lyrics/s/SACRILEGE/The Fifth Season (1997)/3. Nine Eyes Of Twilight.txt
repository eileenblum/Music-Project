[Music: Bergholtz, Dinsdale, Svensson]
[Lyrics: Dinsdale]

I've disarmed the weak for the lies to show
I've fought without mercy I've slain with my sword
I've stricken upon the ones who seek
and blood ahs been shed from the souls so meek

For my paradise was burned and my visions encaged
Soulless and dying, a slave to my rage

I've beared the relic for the stars to touch,
to envy the gods and cut through the skies
I've embraced what disgusts me from behind my facade,
completing the task from behind my mask

For my paradise was burned and my visions encaged
Soulless and dying, a shame to my race

Fear is the strongest dictator, ruler and king of all when set free
Infected me with this strange disease
Heartbroken fallen apart
Who will help me blind them,
nine eyes of twilight don't fail to see
With whom shall I put the observing to rest
With whom tell me...

Nine eyes of dreaded twilight, drain me my might
Nine eyes of dreaded twilight, feed on my fright

I'm the monsters in the seas you sail
I'm the torment in your mind so frail
I'm the plague that ravage your lands,
salvation out of hand

For my paradise was burned and my visions encaged
Soulless and dying, a slave to my rage

Fear is the strongest dictator, ruler and king of all when set free
Infected me with this strange disease
Heartbroken fallen apart
Who will help me blind them,
nine eyes of twilight don't fail to see
With whom shall I put the observing to rest
With whom tell me...

Nine eyes of dreaded twilight, drain me my might
Nine eyes of dreaded twilight, feed on my fright
