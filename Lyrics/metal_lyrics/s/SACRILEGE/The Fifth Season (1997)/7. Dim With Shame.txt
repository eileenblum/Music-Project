[Music: Bergholtz, Dinsdale, Svensson]
[Lyrics: Dinsdale, Svensson]

Farewell repulsive earth upon which I've wandered
Nevermore your grandeur I shall behold
Farewell, farewell oh sun and moon
A new age entered enchanted by its gloom

My bloodstained path concealed by lies
Deceit's door stood wide open and I entered

Welcome, welcome bearer of that midnight lamp
Enter the gates that I for you have unsealed

My bloodstained path concealed by lies
Deceit's door stood wide open and I entered

Lead me, oh frequent dreams of midnight hour
Guide me, to the night's shelter

My midnight lamp burn dim with shame
In heaven the moon is low
Betraying sharer of its secret flame arise and go

Dragging my feet through the heavy mist
Silent whispers from vague shapes emerged,
broke loose and howled

My midnight lamp burn dim with shame
In heaven the moon is low
Betraying sharer of its secret flame arise and go

Lead me, oh frequent dreams of midnight hour
Guide me, to the night's shelter

Come precious daybreak
Deliver me from the claws of merciless sleep
In this the dream I dreamt before
That's awaken me sore
