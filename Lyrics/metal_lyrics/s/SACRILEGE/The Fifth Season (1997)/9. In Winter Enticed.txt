[Lyrics: Dinsdale, Svensson]

She arrived in the coldest of winters,
to a slumbering world so white
Naked she came and with eyes so blue,
a monument of beauty she was

The white covered world was peaceful
and she arrived like the mist before dawn
A dreamlike shadeless goddess raised by the frost in the north

But behind her mask of glimmering goodness
a wicked smile appeared
A symbol of darkness in disguise
sent to haunt the light

She grabbed her sword and rode out in the night
to entice all the living and ravish their lives
Her voice was filled with tenderness
as it echoed throughout the land

Her concupiscence was strong
and lured creatures to their graves
Her heart was made of stone
she was starving for the dead

When day had passes and turned into night
she captured god's angels and fed on their fright
The land she had conquered laid empty and cold
Exhausted with grief their souls were sold

She ripped her mask of glimmering goodness
to unveil her blackened soul
A symbol of darkness in disgust
sent to crush the light

She grabbed her sword and rode out in the night
to entice all the living and ravish their lives
Her voice was filled with tenderness
as it echoed throughout the land

Her concupiscence was strong...

What peace for me in a star or moon
What solace in nightingale
They tell me of the lost and gone
and dawn completes the tale
