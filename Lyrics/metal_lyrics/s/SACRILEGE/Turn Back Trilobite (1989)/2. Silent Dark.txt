So when I close my eyes
I see the walls close in
And when the sunlight fades
That's when my pain begins
You take me further down
Into my own black hell
See all the strangers there
I thought I knew so well
Amongst the crowd, I'm alone with me
Amongst the crowd, I'm alone you see

Standing alone, in this a crowded room
Not thought the end would come so soon.
I can't explain that within you see
Such terror, these fears have brought to me.
This crime I'd not wish to commit
With those who fought and lost to it.
You seek confusion, but I not mine
I see not your laughter, my eyes now blind.

Amongst the crowd, I'm alone with me
Amongst the crowd, we're alone you see

You say I have no reason
For this my sense of loss.
You cry your tears of ignorance
Your laughter wisdom it is not.
I envy so your strength
For I know mine is none.
I touched the cold black dark
So now I seek the sun.
