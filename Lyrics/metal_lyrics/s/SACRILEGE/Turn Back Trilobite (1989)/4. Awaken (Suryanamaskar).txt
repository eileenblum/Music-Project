Seen the writing on the wall
Now I'm stronger than before.
All the love you gave to me
You take my pain and set me free.
The sun and moon, the dark defeats
My love is strong, sorrow retreats.
The sun and moon, sweet fantasy
My love is strong, now you let me be.

You came to me when I was poor
Gave me riches sweet and pure.
Touched my soul and gave me peace
In your warmth life's new release.

All the wealth that man has sold
Cannot touch love that's pure gold.
All the winters that war brings
Could, through love, be forever spring.
