Brighter than the golden, warmer than the sun
Lost in depths black murkey, as the warriors spirit gone
The eagle flies with sight so keen, the jewel it hopes to see
That is lost and can't be found, search for eternity
Old and wise the guru's pace long held solemnity
The preachers prayers are on deaf ears, myth or reality?
A crying child, no hope to calm, now vain all efforts be
That is lost and can't be found, search for eternity

Crowding every corner, with the prizes of knowledge
Creating lonely wastes, with empty ignorance
Filling time with reason, dismissing wonder endlessly
That is lost and can't be found, search for eternity

The sonata of the whale, music for the sailors dance
Hunter and the hunted, whose paths are crossed by chance
Lovers cries in ecstasy, as one they hope to be
that is lost and can't be found, search for eternity

Me the highest peaks must see, deepest waters they have drowned
Four corners of the earth, forever to go round
The empty void, so deep inside, our pain for all to see
That is lost and can't be found, search for eternity
