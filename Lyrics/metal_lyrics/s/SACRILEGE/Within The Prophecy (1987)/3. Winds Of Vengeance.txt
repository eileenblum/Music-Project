Deep in the abyss, for years entombed they have lain
Long through the timeless mists, they are like the ghosts of the slain
Engulfed by darkness, they have awaited to rise
above all is their laughter, as the world weeps and dies
Through chance after chance, more mistakes are made
Dormant in the wilderness, on our minds they have preyed
Now the cry from the darklands, burns down deep in our souls
Spirits crying for sanctuary as their evil takes hold

At the hour of the dawn, they eclipsed the sun
from a blackened sky, now both man and beast run
from their shadow no shelter from their anger no peace
From the heavens no mercy, on destruction they feast

Now the land that is left, it is polluted and drained
Trees bear no fruit now, the soil it yields no grain
With the beat of great wings, the wind it rages the earth
Now all evil is cleansed as we await the rebirth
