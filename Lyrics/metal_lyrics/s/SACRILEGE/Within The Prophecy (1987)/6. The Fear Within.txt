Thought, closes his mind, fear down deep within
Cold, hands of terror, time, now it begins
Tearing inside, as alive, but entombed

Hands, grasping his throat, choking, starting to drown
Screams, no-one can hear, reality, he's all alone

Tearing inside, as alive, but entombed

Breaking free from the grip, fear, annulled by the light
Usurper, now is denied, his eyes, it is only a respite
