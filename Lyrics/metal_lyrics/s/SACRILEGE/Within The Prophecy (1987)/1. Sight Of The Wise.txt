World in madness, doors shut tight
Blind oppression keeping out the light
Power twisted, throughout years of misuse
Seeds of our freedom waiting to take root
Buildings grey, as architects minds
Laughing children left far behind
Fields now gone, room only for schools
Learning is none with books mere rules
People in lines afraid to step out
Whisper of tongues, too tied to shout
Ticket to death, reaper at the wheel
Never to stop until we learn how to feel
World in madness, doors broken down
Sight of the wise throwing light all around
Power gives way to freedom of choice
Bound hands freed with mind and voice
