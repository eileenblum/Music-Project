Down the spiral staircase into darkness beyond
an endless web of hopelessness, a forlorn and lonely song
The vultures silent eyeing, for the first meal of the day
The mad ones tortured eyes from insanity never stray
In the dark recesses of the pit, walls are damp and cold
Prisoner stares deranged with fears both new and old
Brain has but one use now, to torment the captives mind
Body void of use now, it is like a vision to the blind

The soul if freed could flee the pit, and walk above the pain
And once again delight in warm sun and cooling rain
Reality away now, smile glances on sad lips
whilst glimpsing at the world before returning to the pit
