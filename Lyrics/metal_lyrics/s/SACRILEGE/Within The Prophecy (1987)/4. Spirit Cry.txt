World is spinning, down into decay
Light slowly fading, purple through to grey
Mother crying raindrops, sweet tears
The final judgement, we realize our fears
Children are crying, unborn babies scream
The nightmare we made, has finished off our dream
Oceans are calling, fertile lands now drown
Sun getting nearer, earth scorched black/brown

Smoke rising around us, senses searching for the light
We're loving each other, but now it's too late
Fire blinds our eyes, heat burns our minds
Singing the final song, that man has written for mankind
