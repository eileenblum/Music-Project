The new day is dawning they start counting the dead
The hard swollen bellies of the children not fed
Their land dry and parched still they pray for the rain
The massacre continues yet again and again
Year after year the lands ring death's bell
The children blind's eyes have a sad tale to tell
Their limbs bent and twisted, their minds hold no spark
Their crying in vain for no light breaks the dark

The land holds the hammer but mankind deals the blow
Economics and profit before compassion we show
Our excesses waste as the wealthy grow fat
Rather than give to the needy they'll let the food rot

At death's door they stand, only suffering they know
