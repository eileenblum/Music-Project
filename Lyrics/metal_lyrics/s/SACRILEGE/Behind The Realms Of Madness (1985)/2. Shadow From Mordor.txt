Like the shadow from Mordor, creeping slowly forward
Unleashed from it's sanctuary by the devil in man
The world thrown into torment by their uncaring greed
We stare into the face of death screaming to be freed
Their control is complete, we the voiceless have none
Beaten into defeat by the arm of the strong
Now the shadow gets darker for they've stolen the sun
And the sale of our earth has already begun

Like Durin's Bane, rising up from the deep
There is evil at work while the people do sleep
As they plunder the earth, still we sit back and watch
Their wrath consumes all that would stand in their path
