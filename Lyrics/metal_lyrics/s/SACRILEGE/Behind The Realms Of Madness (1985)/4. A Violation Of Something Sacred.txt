With blatant deception they rape the fields of life
With brutal destruction enforcing hatred and strife
They take beauty in their hands yet put back only pain
Their bigotry and greed has always been the same
With blind acceptance we swallow all their lies
Engulfed by their hatred we learn only to despise
They have nothing in their arrogance, their narrow-minded stance
But they won't open up their eyes to even give it just a chance
