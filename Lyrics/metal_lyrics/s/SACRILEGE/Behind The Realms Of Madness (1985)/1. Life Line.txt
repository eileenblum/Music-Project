Through innocent minds the knife glides in
Cutting the lifeline to sanity
Replacing lives with possessions and greed
Like blind children we search frantically
Our hands claw the air for peace and light
But we're offered just blackness and rage

A new life screams as it takes its first breath
Soon trapped in its ready-made cage
Its hands claw the air for peace and light
Yet it's offered just blackness and rage

Through innocent flesh the knife glides in
Cutting the life-line with ease
Replacing life with the foul stench of death
On the fresh blood they now start to feed
They've taken the earth as they now take the life
Cold concrete replaces warm soil
We sit in the corners, minds twisted with fear
For a world we shall soon see no more
