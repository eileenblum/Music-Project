Such a sorrowful scene, this sight for sore eyes
Emaciated bodies, another child dies
A sad symbol of the brotherhood of man
Out of sight out of mind in a faraway land
Begging for a morsel, bowl in hand
While the rich men talk of relief plans
Drawing up agreements of who gets what
But the bowl stays empty and the corpses rot

Such a sorrowful scene, a sight for sore eyes
The weapons pile up, the whole country dies
A sad symbol of the hatred of man
Out of sight out of mind in our own land

Begging for sanity, let reason prevail
The wise men talk, the efforts all fail
They make new agreements of who's got what
The stockpiles get higher the child is forgot
