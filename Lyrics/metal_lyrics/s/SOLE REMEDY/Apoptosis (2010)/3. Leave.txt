I confess my ignorance
I have no place left to hide
Remembrance I'll burn through time
Ignorant of what I've done

Why am I here?
What have I done?
To deserve this...?
Punishment...!

Free me of this sympathy...
Free me of this anarchy

This burden in me
I try to set free
Why should I care?
Just leave me here

I'm leaving my shame
Behind, atleast for now
The downward spiral
Will reach it's end someday

I see my shadow, is there hope for me?
This time I'll find out, I am comatosed

Free me of my sympathy!
Free me from this anarchyyyyyy!
Just leave!
