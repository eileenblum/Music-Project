I've seen so much,
I've had so much time to comprehend
This present darkness, I wander all alone
But after all, I'm here

I'm on the edge but only pushed aside!

Before the fall came
I saw my life come to an end
I had enough, the lethal dosage
But after all, I'm still here

The rain fell down on broken ground
The air was filled with empty hope
I was so afraid of future to come
It's winter now, the warmth is gone

The warmth is gone, the darkness falls
This soul deprived, my broken home
My hope is lost, am I awake?
Is there anyone here?

Still on the edge, the truth awaits!

And on that warm day I saw my life end
But after all, I'm still here
Still on the edge, the truth awaits
