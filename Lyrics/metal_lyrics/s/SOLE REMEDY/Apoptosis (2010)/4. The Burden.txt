Shattered within
Trying to fill the void
Living this lie
I'd rather live my life
Poison in me
Trying to rid disease
My eyes blinded
From what still lies beneath

I'm still caged
Wallowing in shame
So afraid
What I might become

Cold reflection
I might find you here...

Once I had more
Twice I gave more
Every word that you
Said cared less
At last I broke you.....free

This frame holds my future
As I gaze upon it I stand still
For a moment this is bliss
I see the truth.
I see myself..
