I've dealt with my past
Opened my eyes
Left my scars behind
To forgive and forget

Lost, hurt and broken
I walk along these roads
These scars still won't heal
I am a wounded soul

I see my shadow
Is there hope for me?
This time I'll find out
I am comatosed

As time goes by
I'm still lying alone
Will I heal my wounds?
Or will I find peace?

Caress your anger
I once heard you say
This time I'll fall apart
Why am I fighting?...........
