Remember this moment
Remember these words
Remember yesterday?
My decay , the years gone by?

This is my memory
This is what I recall
Torn apart, still breathing
Through the fog, I could not see

Remember yesteryears?
Remember the tears I've shed?
Remember to forget
What I was, the past is done

The past is done, I know
But I forgot how it was
Some day, somehow
I will see the truth

In this world, where I walk alone
Forgotten, not forgiven
These are not my final words
I bow my head to mark my shame

Some days I wish I had more strength
Still this frail soul keeps moving on
I may wonder what might become
I will burn this remembrance once more

Pushed aside by the truth
The one answer which lies within me
I've seen all bridges burn
The tidal waves of yesterday
These tides will wash away
The pain that holds me here
Let me rest one last time
Before these words wilt away

I've seen all bridges burn
The tidal waves of yesterday
These tides will wash away
The pain that holds me here
Let me rest one last time
Before these words wilt away
Before I go away, Remember
Just let me fade away
