Wolf in mans clothes waits to break free once more
Forever trapped in this travesty of a man
If he sees the daylight your hope will be gone

Lay down your burden
Your only desire
Is to forget the
Past within you

Forget your past
Forget your future
Lay down your burden
And be re-born

It never seems to amaze
The memories haunting you
He waits for the moment
To breath again

I see my world falling apart!
This world divided! Torn apart!

Someone once said 'Never forget who you truly are'
I never stopped to wonder why
Someone once said 'Never be afraid...
to show them who you truly are'
Don't let the past be your future
Just break the chain
Well here I am, still ashamed
Of what I've become.. a travesty of man

As I gaze upon the stars I see what life is for
My deeds have kept me in a point of no return
I liberated my madness to feel the fire burn
This empty soul now feels a bit fulfilled

The bridges I have burned I no longer remember
But I still need to live my ashen memories
Open the door, enter to a world unknown
This journey continues as I seek for solace
...Solace...
