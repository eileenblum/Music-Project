See what you have done
Your foundations have collapsed
You're on your own
And this time there's nothing left for you

You try to build a fence
So no one can reach you
You are pitiful
Too weary to understand at all
Why there's nothing left for you

You can try to change (if you take the time)
When everything is fading (fading)
This is not the end (if you seize the day)
Don't lose yourself

You seek a place in their head
Who left you all alone
Then maybe it keeps
You from wasting you

Will you ever change (dare to take a chance?)
Don't leave it be
Would you even see (can you even see?)
What lies beneath

You are on your own (you are all alone)
And there's nothing left for you (nothing left to waste)
Now you're under tow (and still going on)
You've lost yourself
