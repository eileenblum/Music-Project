It's in my head, the thoughts alive
This burden still by my side
I solely watch as the hunger dies

And the winter's gone, the dark withdraws
The light of these days won't help me
To understand this...

As days go by I follow the path
Which once led me to my home
But someone's still there

This separated mind - trying to find - solace
In this obscure puzzle - I'll try to collect the pieces back

This prize I paid for solitude
Was too much to bear for both of us
Is sickness within me?

The future still uncertain - like curtain's fall too soon
I have no place to hide - neither do you
You're inside me

The rain fell down on broken ground
The air was filled with empty hope
I was so afraid of future to come
The winter's gone, the dark withdraws

Like a memory of yesterday
I am collecting the pieces back
I have no place to hide, neither do you
You're inside me
We are but one mind, one body, one soul
The beast lives within me

Free me of this sympathy
Free me from this anarchy
