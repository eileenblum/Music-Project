Illumination comes with the sound of a familiar entity...
Resuming its rightful throne...
Emerging from the wreckage...
The regal soul survivor's collecting the faithful for a reintroduction to human brilliance...
Consuming all in the lifting song of immortality...
Awake all silent, take your place in reconstructing sound!..
Amass all broken, take your right to collect once more!..
Lift your head and sing the end!..
Sing the end again!..
Make glass of everything peripheral; Sing it to the ground!..
