To going out with a bang...
One for the history books...
As I make my last stand...
Euphoric; Gun in hand...
A soldier awaiting alarm to strike against their waking arms...
They will tear the wood from the wall like clockwork...
The perfect way to shatter nerves...
Death is nothing but a joke told by the will to live...
I'm laughing so give me the best you've go to give...
They'll have to kill me one thousand times to bleed my last drop of organic permanence...
