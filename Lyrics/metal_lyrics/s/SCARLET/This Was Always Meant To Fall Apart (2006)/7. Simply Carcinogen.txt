She's got you breathing hard...
You spring to life in a single touch...
She says the word and you work yourself to death...
At night you're in her bed lifeless as a doll...
The world is calm outside; Inside you shake the walls...
You are a monster...
Meaning is a memory...
She makes it hurt so bad...
It's impossible to speak of this disgrace you have...
Your only love is in the absence of light...
Give yourself away one more night...
