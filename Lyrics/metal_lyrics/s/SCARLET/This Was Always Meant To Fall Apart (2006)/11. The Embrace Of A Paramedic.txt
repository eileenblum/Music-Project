In a menacing stare, you're lost...
As I'm picking apart your intellect...
Layer by layer, room by room...
Undressing every inch of you...
I've taken over the hand of your youth, to expose it to the real world...
I will alleviate naivety...
And only when you survive will you thank me...
They way things really are can beat you into submission...
There is no youth, there is no innocence...
Back through the corners of your memory, what an overwhelming place to be...
