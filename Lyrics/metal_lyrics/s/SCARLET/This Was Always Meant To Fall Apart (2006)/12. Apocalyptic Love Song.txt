Caress depressed faces with one final word...
Feel it in the corners of your eyes...
I wait for the call to become your death...
You are in the arms of impending death...
You look so good with your blank stare...
Screaming all I need to see...
Silent, violence, begin to shiver and shake...
This is the end of you, I've got one word for you...
Run...
My masterpiece in mind...
All vivid, florid colors...
For one subject and none other...
Deceiver, you've ruined everything...
