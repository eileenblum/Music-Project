It was a night in fluorescent light...
A glow from a chemical high...
Enough to pierce through all opposed...
Despite how they resist and deny...
Indestructible things were uncontested and obeyed...
Not one would rush the gates to expose the fabrications made...
Reflections took the form of living legends...
Locking fists became a cure....
And from the halls came maniacal laughter, alive in the echo...
As eyes reveal from below...
The unbelievers hung from the rafters...
