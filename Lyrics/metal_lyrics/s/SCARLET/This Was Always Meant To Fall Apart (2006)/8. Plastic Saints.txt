Failure exists as a living face in the mirror.
Alive like all of us.
Living a lie.
It's the perfect crime with a witness beside you the whole time.
This is the modern day sale of indulgence, as the faithless try to bring heaven home.
The corrupt shall live by televised convulsions and the just shall live by faith alone.
God save these ravenous animals standing upright to early for their own good.
We all fail again.
