A day that's so silent you can hear a heart sing out its disgrace...
Such a violent machine...
A highly modified display of walking dark desire...
As the worlds lit up with dreams like a hail of gunfire...
The light of eyes fade as they believe in lies...
The ears of many will ring to commemorate the death of innocence...
Tears will fall with every body used and dollar spent...
Vaccines for dreams, born of what can make you scream...
Keep dreaming...
