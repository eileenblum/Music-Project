It is too bright today...
The faceless bodies will spin haunting webs...
White displays...
Stand tall, begin...
Life ends in sweat tonight, closed doors; find me...
Bow low and close your eyes...
No one should see...
Taming calypso, claiming to never let go...
Glass veined wire frames grow strong as they deliver...
"Look at me, look at me, keep your eyes on me,
You can run if you want but there's no escaping full cities have fell for you but I'm gonna make you come clean..."
Stripped down; Empty...
"Look at me, look at me, keep your eyes on me...
You can run if you want, but there's no escaping..."
"Look at me, look at me, keep your eyes on me...
Forget all that you know...
This could get ugly"
