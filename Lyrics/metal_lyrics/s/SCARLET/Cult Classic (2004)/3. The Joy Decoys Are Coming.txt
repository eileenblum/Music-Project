The joy decoys are coming. Dirty as a dollar and twice as numbing.
Backstabbing salesmen telling you ho to feel. Door to door gunpoint.
They are making you kneel. The rip off artists are coming.
Selling you flesh to the meat markets and running.
Sleazy used car salesmen telling you how to feel.

If you want love, you can buy love. Everyone is for sale.
Your devil in a three-piece suit is here.
His gun cocked to shoot who is near.

You are the money hungry prostitute swine.
Selling your soul one dollar at a time.
You are the money hungry prostitute swine.
Open your legs and recite these lines.
