Army ants living a little white lie. A slave to the wage and the nine to 
five.
I want the monotony. I need the anonymity.

My job defines who I am. It's my personal Jesus. It's the evolution of man.
My net worth tells me who I am. This is something you can't understand 
...anymore.
Take it all and beg for more.
We're all drugged monkeys. Content with our role.
We're all porn junkies. Looking for a hole.
