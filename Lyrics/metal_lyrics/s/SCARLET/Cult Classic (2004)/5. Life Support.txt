You need me and I need this illusion of safety.
I'm just too scared of being alone.
Without you my air supply is low. And my heart is going to explode.
Feed me a steady diet of resuscitator thrusts.
Look at the lonely people decayed and feeble.
And look at what it's doing to us.
So put me on our life support. My pulse is fading and my breath is short.

So put me on your life support. I'm damaged goods on your police report.
You were the adrenaline shot to my heart when euphoria and I just couldn't 
part.
Look at the lonely people, decayed and feeble
And look at what it's doing to us.
