Johnny, get your gun. I'm not afraid to die.
Johnny, get your gun. For a suicide pact tonight.
Burning out with the Hollywood hopefuls.

Johnny, I'm not your dying star.
Ultra violence. Wrapped in cellophane.

Bound and gagged in the back of my car.
That cardboard cut out icon was my swinging rope and skipping toes.
My world came crashing down.
