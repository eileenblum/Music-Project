Ms. Doe. I've been watching you outside your window.
Cutting myself to feel new. I want to tie you up and pin you down Ms. Doe.
You're my only muse. This blindfold and this gag, they're both for you.
I want to tie you up and pin you down.
I want to feel lost and feel found.

My nerves are shot and my wrists are slit.
I'm your stalker and you're my fix.
You're my fix. You're my fix. You're my fix.
