Welcome to the world of the manic depressed.
Hopped up on Valium and in cardiac arrest.
Hold me closer when this world ends.

We could share our endorphins.
We could sleep with loaded shotguns and trigger happy trends.
To become prosthetic and disinfect our friends.

For the panic attacked and the socially phobic.
The human pets neurotic and hopeless.
We're all hopeless tonight.

I don't need your therapy.
I don't want you telling me.
Everything will be alright.
