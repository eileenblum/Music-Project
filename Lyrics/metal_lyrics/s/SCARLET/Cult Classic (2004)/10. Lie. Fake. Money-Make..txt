This static hit the airwaves. This gimmick hit the big time.
We bought these masks in California where those plastic surgeons are the 
crime.
Liars and fakers are good moneymakers.
Two-faced, double crossed, and vacant.
We started a suicide cult today and killed ourselves for the clichÃ©.

Would you follow each other to the next big thing?
Of shooting yourself in the face.
Would you bleed yourself dry? Just to live out that lie?
And for one empty embrace. Bulimic and hostile.
Are you sedated? Are you the emaciated?
