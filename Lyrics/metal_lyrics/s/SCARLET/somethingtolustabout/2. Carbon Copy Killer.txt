Killing
Spree for the disposable moderns
Right now
You are the plastic dolls of today
Slowly dismembering yourselves
You
Are an army of decay
Killing
Time with flash and shine
And I know all your secrets [x2]
Cause I'm your carbon copy, cause I'm your carbon copy... killer
What's that stench behind your closed door?
Who's that corpse on your bathroom floor?
Killing
Spree for the disposable moderns
Right now
You are the plastic dolls of today
Your mirror loves you
Your vanity pimps you
Let me smear your make up
Let me break your porcelian face
