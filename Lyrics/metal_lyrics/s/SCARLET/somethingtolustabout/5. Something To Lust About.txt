I
Am the savior of rock and roll
I
Am your electric shock control
You feel me up
And you feel me out
I give you something to lust about
Deep sleep
Dirty and cheap
I'll make you flawed
Gonna make you - I'll make you weak
I'm so much larger than life [x2]
Let me seduce you
Let me reduce you
I
Am the savior of rock and roll
I
Am will take you where you need to go
You feel me up
And you feel me out
I give you something to lust about
