We are the morbid
and the abstract
We are the breeding
mammals with bad backs
Our messiah on the cover
of the magazines
Has a black lung
and an i.v. 
of nicotine
A.M. rendezvous with strung out ambulance driver's caffine blues [x2]
This is the life of... [x2]
The living dead
This is the revolver: blowing off my head
Blowing off my head...
These are the sedatives that keep me fed
All the lies and piss, has it come down to this? A junkies track of makeshift remiss [x2]
Felling the needles
The medics used
To stab their veins with double
doses by the twos
This is the life of the living dead
This is the revolver: blowing off my head
