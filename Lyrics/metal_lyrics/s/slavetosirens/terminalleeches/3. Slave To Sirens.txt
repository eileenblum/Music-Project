Low born and low dwelling species
Songless, peevish thing
You live not in the upper air
And you cannot tell the sound of singing
I shall sing my words
When my lips are burned with flames
We are yet an infected wave
Of an everlasting lust for hate
In our silence and our slumber we drag our chains
Low born dwelling species
Songless, peevish thing
You pray
You obey
Forever a slave
Stuck in this grave
You pray
You obey
Listen to the sound
Of a thousand screaming souls
Afraid
Betrayed
Waiting some time to be saved
Alone
Forgotten
Salt water smothers your face
Waiting to be saved
Water smothers your face

You try
To escape
No mercy shall ever
Be on your side
You try
To escape

But the gods foretold your arrival
And in our dreams we saw you sailing near where the sea hits the rocks
The clouds grew darker as the tides called us forth
And there we see you approaching your doom

We will lure you inside
Of our cave
Become a slave to sirens
Look into our eyes
Hell fires rage
Become a slave to sirens

Crumble down
Into dust
Oblivion shall become of you when you are crucified
And spitting blood
Demonized
Are the heart of us who enslave you now

You shall succumb
You will become
A slave to sirens now
