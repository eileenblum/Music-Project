Possess not a human
Obsess not over his flesh
For you shall be slave of time
Possess not a human
Obsess not over his flesh
For you shall be slave of time
Greed and hate is all that we know
A name written with blood and bones
Spiraling down into the dark abyss
They fill your head with lies
Ignorance, your ultimate demise
Race, so fragile so weak
Waiting for false salvation
Believe not in the trinkets of deceit
We are life's greatest
We are life's greatest abomination
Illiteracy is a dangerous thing
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring
There shallow drafts
Intoxicate the brain
And drink largely sobers us again
Mutant species
Endless diseases
We feed on war
Terminal leeches
Cruelty nits a snare
Spread its bate with care
We feed on war
Terminal leeches
Mutant species
Endless diseases
We feed on war
Terminal leeches
Absolute terror
Pleasure to kill
Reign in chaos
Terminal leeches
