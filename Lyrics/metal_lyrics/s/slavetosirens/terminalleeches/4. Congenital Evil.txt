Born from a filthy womb
Raped, scorned and abused
Contaminated blood fills the veins
And prepares unbridled lust for hate

Black is the flesh
Beyond hells door
Deep in your soul
Congenital evil
Dark are thy eyes
Forbidden from the light
I taste on your tongue
Congenital evil
Zero degrees of empathy
Heâs a merciless creature
Always feeding on your pain
Making you his toy
Why do you always have to obey?
Zero degrees of empathy forever coming your way

Empathy
Erosion he defines
Corrosive emotion
His utmost demise

Black is the flesh
Congenital evil
Congenital evil
