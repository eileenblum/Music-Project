Disgusting fallen creatures
Abnormal humanesticide
You crawl in unnoticed
And snatch the innocent lives

Aggression dominion
And hate are your ways
Prepare for the final scene
Where we end your game

Cold hearted and low
You are dead inside
Ridden of emotions
A serpent in disguise

Humanesticide
You cannot hide

In a moment
In a day
In this life you will decay
Unbind the shackles
Rewind the lock
These rusty bars will make you rot (rot)
For the innocent you will pay
Blood on your hands soul decay
Show them mercy (show them mercy)

Terribly exploited
Beaten and distorted
But all shall be reversed

The cold frost upon the skin
Tired and cold
Withered to dust

Tortured
Victims of the twisted man
Free yourself from his command
Exploited
Hunted down by the plague
Extinction will the turn page to man
(Human, human)
