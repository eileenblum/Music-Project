I want to drown in you and fill my lungs with your breath
An everlasting intertwinement
Who we are,
The flame in your eyes will make pale the radiant sun
Our truth will be revealed when our dreams become the breath of life
Who we are... we're endless...
Ever watch a flame burn I see your face
Every stare at the horizon line,
Like when you lay before me
You are... And I am... Endless
As we pass into eternal flame
