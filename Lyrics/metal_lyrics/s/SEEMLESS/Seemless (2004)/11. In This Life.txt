Watching the tide rise and fall reminds me... of our mortality.
Our days are few
So hold close to the time we have, in this life.
Into your hands... I commend myself
A sacrifice, a path of life that pacifies to reveal the beauty of this life.
Watching the sunrise and set fills me with realization... I want to do what's right.
I struggle, I want to say what's right, I struggle.
Everything you do comes back to you.
What have you done with the life that you've been given?
