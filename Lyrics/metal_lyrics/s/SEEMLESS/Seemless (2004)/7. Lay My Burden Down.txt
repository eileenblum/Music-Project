I work my fingers to the bone
And you know I'm slipping down so low
Getting down on my knees praying for release
Lord, wont you help me
And I feel the weight dragging down on me
There's redemption coming
That I seek,
I close my eyes
Close my eyes to see this is what it means to bleed
For what you love
So let me BLEED
So I lay my burden down...
