Brothers, can't u see something's going on?
There's another happening in front of your face,
But you can't see it
It's hard to know who's your friend and who's your enemy
When it comes down to the line,
Would you lay your life down for your freedom?
No one knows what lies in the heart of man
No one has the answers to the questions that we have
As we continue on the road less traveled on
Ill see you on the other side...
Sisters, can't u see something's going on?
There's another happening in front of your face,
But you can't see it
It's hard to know who's your friend and who's your enemy
When it comes down to the line,
Would you lay your life down for your freedom?
No one knows what lies in the heart of man
No one has the answers to the questions that we have
As we continue on the road less traveled on
Ill see you on the other side...
The lines have been drawn,
They' re asking which side your on
Too much corruption going on to see the truth behind the deception,
I will tell you, there's a war inside the soul from birth to death.
Life's unrest.
A balance of War &amp; Peace
Faith and disbelief, joy and grief, it's time to choose who you serve.
So I give back in word.
