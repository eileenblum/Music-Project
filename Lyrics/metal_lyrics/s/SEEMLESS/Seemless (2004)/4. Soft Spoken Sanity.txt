In your eyes, in disguise,
As you move so quickly.
Behind the lines, here in my tranquility
In this life, you will find when we unite internally
In your eyes, in disguise,
Humility can you see the way that we are falling apart
Can you see the way that we are moving way too fast
What's going on?
So many people acting so crazy,
Trying to find some piece of mind
Don't you know you gotta' slow things down
To find some sanity...
