In this struggle to maintain in this existence,
I try to make it on my own
But I fall astray, I feel so lost it brings me to my knees
Give me the strength I need when I'm feeling weak.
This is my time of need.
Give me the peace I need when I'm feeling restless.
I need you more than ever.
I know there will be a time when I have fallen.
Your hands will guide me out and purify my soul.
When I fall... you help me to rise again.
