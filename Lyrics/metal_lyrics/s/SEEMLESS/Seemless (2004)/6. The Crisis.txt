Walking in stillness
Spirits move beyond the flesh
Tortured soul in a cage of flesh
Meant to be broken
Running from the truth will set you free,
To see the real life,
Deaf to the voice of the spirit that sets you free
To see the crisis,
These eyes see life through death
Many are called but chosen are few.
