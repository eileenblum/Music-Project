The shadow that's lost carries a burden
Cursed to roam
There's a whispering in my mind
This road will lead you down
Into your heart,
Into your soul,
Your broken wings will lead u down
The shadow that is found can see the light within their soul
Bit there's a whispering in my mind
Saying' this road will lead you down
Follow the light
To lead you out,
Before you fall into the shadows
I am my worst enemy
Fell into the life of the wanderer
Searching for a way to drag you
Down...
