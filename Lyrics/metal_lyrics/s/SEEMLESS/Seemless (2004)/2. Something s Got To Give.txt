Something's really got to change
The ways we live are lives in disregard for one another
Can't we see it's time to change our perception?
Something's really got to give
How we live this way
So much pain and suffering
We must overcome
Love sweet love will sustain us
All your money and possessions,
They mean nothing in the span of time
Open your eyes
See the real life
We can make a difference if we try
Something's really got to change
The way we live our lives
In disregard for one another,
Can't we see it's time to change our perception?
Prisoners to our own mistakes,
We've got to wise up
Time to change our perception
Something's really got to give
How can we live this way?
So much pain and suffering
We must overcome
Love sweet love will sustain us
Take some time to recognize what false and part with it
Love sweet love will sustain us
Love will overcome
We'll be as one
Why are we so blind?
Why are we so cold?
I was to tear down these walls they've built around us
Something's got to change
