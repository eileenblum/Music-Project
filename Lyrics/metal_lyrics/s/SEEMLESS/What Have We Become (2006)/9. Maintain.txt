Tired eyes overshadowed with a gaze of frustration Contemplation of living under the knife
I maintain

Is your face lined with tension
Weary legs to carry that weight
Contemplation of salvation
We just got to get away

Your time will come you'll see the sun rising. Eternally
Your time will come you'll see the sun rising. So let it be
Your time will come you'll see the sun rising
Another day for living to maintain. I maintain
We're gonna survive

We suffer to experience to know
What it's life to be dragged down under
I won't lay down and die so don't lay down and die
We're gonna survive
