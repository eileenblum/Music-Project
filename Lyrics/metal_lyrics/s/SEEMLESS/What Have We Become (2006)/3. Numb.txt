Down forcing it down
I got no one to blame for the state that I'm in
Down forcing it down
I got to get away got I got to get out of this place

Searching for another way
No more trying to escape
Now I'm standing face to face with my pain

Down choking it down
Got no one to blame for this state that I'm in
Down choking it down
I got to get away got to get out of this place

Searching for another way
No more trying to escape
Now I'm standing face to face with my pain
Desperation has a way of making you crazy
