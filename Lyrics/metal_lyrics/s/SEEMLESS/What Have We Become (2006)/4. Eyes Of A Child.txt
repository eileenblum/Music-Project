Our foundation for the next generation
Tell them that life is in their hands
Our demonstrations will be salvation
Can't you see it in there eyes?

All my life it seemed to me that
Something ain't right with the world we live in
Don't you know we are the reason
A chance to change what we are seeing

How do we see the truth revealed in the course of time
I know that we teach by actions so live the life you know

All my years spent disbelieving
Nothing will change so what's the reason
To fight at all well don't you see that
We gotta chance to change what we are seeing

How do we see the truth revealed in the course of time
I know that we teach by actions so live the life you know

We gotta live the light
This is our time, this is our life
This is your chance to stand and fight
This is your chance to live right
