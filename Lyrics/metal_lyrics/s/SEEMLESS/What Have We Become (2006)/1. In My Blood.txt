Years pass and in the distance a dream will die or come alive.
So in time it leaves me restless I gotta make it right
So much time spent trying to find my place in life
All that I wanted was to be the voice in this eternal fight

I am alive so I live my life before I die
Stand my ground, won't compromise

Come out of darkness to find serenity within the light
All that I needed was to breathe the music that I bleed inside
So it goes there's a passion in every soul that shapes a mold
A time to grow to sustain, no one can take that away

I am alive so I live my life before I die
Stand my ground, won't compromise
