Here I stand again on the other end
Watching TV screens and all the magazines I see....
Something's wrong with what we've become we are so numb And why don't we see the real life instead of fame and all the money people make?
This is music from my soul don't care much product is sold

Don't you see the tragedy?
Don't you live the parody they're taking your sound away
Don't you see the tragedy?
Don't you live the parody when everyone just sounds the same

Got to break away from the same thing day to day
Corporate control on us
The media takes aim to get inside your brain
The rat race is never won so stand and do not run

Don't you see the tragedy?
Don't you live the parody they're taking your sound away
Don't you see the tragedy?
Don't you live the parody when everyone just sounds the same
