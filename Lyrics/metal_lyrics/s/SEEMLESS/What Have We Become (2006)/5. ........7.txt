You are the love I know will never go
I feel this time we will watch it grow
Living moments that speak right to my soul
Keep you inside no matter where I roam

Now I don't feel so alone
With fears of facing all the unknown
Live inside the moment knowing we can't hold it
Wouldn't change it if I could

Standing right here watching life unfold
Speaking this life until the story is told
Spreading our souls so we hit the road
Keep you inside no matter where I roam

if you ever needed me
You know I am here
I will never leave you
I am always here

Coming from the inside, speaking from the soul
Reaching out from all I know
This is how it's got to be, this is what I know
Life inside the music
