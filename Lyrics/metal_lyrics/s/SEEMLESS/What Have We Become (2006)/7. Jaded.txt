Move forward to a real progression
Mouths move quicker than a mind and perception
Self righteousness becomes a killer of the soul
You think you got it all - jaded fool you're bound to fall

Set me free let me be as I face this war inside

Move forward to a real progression
Don't let the past pull you down and suppress you
You think you got it all - jaded fool you're bound to fall

Set me free let me be as I face this war inside
Set me free so I can be the man I know I'm supposed to be now

Underneath scars and lies you'll find
Buried in a man that hides inside
The truth will burn before your eyes in time
Gotta learn to rise up
