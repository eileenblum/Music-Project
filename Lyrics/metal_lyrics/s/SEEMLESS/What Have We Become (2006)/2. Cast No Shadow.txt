You see the panic in my head
It won't stop until I rise
I'm casting shadows in the light

If you could see inside my head
You'd see darkness pain and lies
There's so much that i can't take it

I'm running in circles now
There's a prison in my mind
There's a chain and i can't break it

Don't worry a voice would say
You know your enemy
Don't worry 'cause things will change
But I see my shadow

If you could see inside my mind
I was lost and now I find
There is peace and i can feel it.

As I walk into the light
There's no more pain and strife
Believe me

Don't worry a voice would say
You know your enemy
Don't worry 'cause things will change
But I see my shadow

Only you can save me now
Only you can take away my pain...
