Standing here deep below
The beauty all around us
Can't we see our earth is dying
All of creation screams

We feed and we bleed off the life in the earth
We take and we rape all the life in the earth
With our human waste

Drifting here in a dream
Lost all our harmony
Can't we see that we are destroying
The air that gives us life?

All of earths' life is fragile
We have severed the balance
There is always consequences
Some day some way we reap what we sow

We feed and we bleed off the life in the earth
We take and we rape all the life in the earth
Gotta give back some of what we have taken
