Billy was a young man shot down in his prime
Jenny was the girl that Billy left behind
Lying in an alleyway, blood pouring down the drain
One for the cause, another link in the chain

Sad hollow faces lay Billy in the ground
Hearts full of hatred, the killers must be found
Eye for an eye now means two lives for one
There's only one way if you live by the gun

[Chorus:]
And the fight goes on, battle to survive
And the fight goes on only heroes die
They only die

Listen to the wind call vengeance on the streets tonight
Voices in the shadow drowned by a burst from an armelite
Heaven's full of heroes - loyal to the end
How many lives will it take to the bitter end, my friend?

[Chorus]
