Wasn't long ago I first met you
Didn't have nothing but a hole in your shoe oh yeah
Sat in your room, eyes turning green
Cutting out pictures from a rock and roll magazine yeah yeah

[Chorus:]
Now you're Front page news, an overnight sensation
Front page news today
Rave reviews, another living legend
Front page news today

You got lucky, got yourself a gig
You couldn't hardly play, but you gotta a hit oh yeah
You got there at any price
I still wonder if you sleep easy in your bed at night

[Chorus]

Pretty soon you'll see a face - Gonna take your place yeah - gonna take it

Front page news, an overnight sensation
