Oh, yeah

Don't shoot until you can see the whites of their eyes
Somehow you've got to douse the flame
Don't give up if the end ain't in sight
No matter how much pain

Take the bit between your teeth
Sink them into the lead
Gotta feel those nerves of steel
Ain't no point in playing dead
Gotta feel those nerves of steel
Ain't no point in playing dead

You gotta bite on the bullet, bite on the bullet real hard
Bite on the bullet, bite on the bullet real hard

You're gonna hurt unless you follow this rule
There's not much more you can do
Moving in for the kill, no suicide pill
It's the hard way out for you.

Put all other thoughts out of your mind
Somehow you gotta concentrate
Where there's a will, there's a way, so I'm told
So don't let your will break
Where there's a will, there's a way, so I'm told
So don't let your will break - no no

Bite on the bullet, bite on the bullet real hard [x4]

Bite on the bullet, bite on the bullet real hard
Bite on the bullet, bite it, you'll like it, bite it, you'll like it yeah

Where there's a will there is a way
