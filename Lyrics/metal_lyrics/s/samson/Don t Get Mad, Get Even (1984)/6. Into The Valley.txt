How much more can one man take
How many times can one heart break
Dark days left out in the cold

Taken for suckers, played for fools
Under submission we follow the rules
How long can one man carry that load?

[Chorus:]
Out on the streets young hearts running free
Fighting for you, calling to me
Into the valley, tear is the key
Nothing can stop young hearts - running free

Grind us down one by one
Hide the truth behind the gun
How much? How much can we stand?

Blinded with science, choked with lies
Can't see the wood for the wool in our eyes
Can't stand the blood upon our hands

Out on the streets young hearts running free
Fighting for you, calling to me
Into the valley, fear is the key
Nothing can stop young hearts - running free

How much more can one man take?
How many times can one heart break?
Dark days left out in the cold

Taken for suckers, played for fools
Oh yeah we follow those rules
How long can one man carry that had?

[Chorus]

Young hearts - running free - young hearts - running free - running free
running free (Yeah) - running free - running free - running free
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
