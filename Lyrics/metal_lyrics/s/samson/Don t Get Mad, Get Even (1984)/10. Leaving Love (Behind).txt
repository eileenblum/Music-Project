I've been to hell and back getting you off my mind
You put me on my back when you walked out this time
And underlined the fact by seeing a friend of mine - a friend of mine

Leaving love behind
Tables turned this time
Leaving love behind
It ain't no use to me I'm a leaving love behind yeah

You didn't stop to think what you were doing to me
Losing you this time killed all the love in me
Now all I've got is some kind of used to be - some kind of used to be

Leaving love behind
Tables turned this time
Leaving love behind
It ain't no use to me I'm a leaving love, I'm a leaving

Leaving love behind
Tables turned this time
Leaving love, leaving love, leaving love
It ain't no use to me, I'm a leaving love

Leaving love behind
Tables turned this time
Been to hell and back, hell and back, hell and back yeah
It ain't no use to me, I'm a leaving love behind, I'm a leaving love
