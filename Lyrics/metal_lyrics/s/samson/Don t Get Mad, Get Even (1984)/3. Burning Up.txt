In the darkness of the night
When the moon above is shining bright
When the fire starts to rise
Will you show me paradise?

Burning hunger for your love
Will you touch me 'till I can't hold on?
Will you take me deep inside
Through the endless night to light?

[Chorus:]
Feel I'm burning, burning up
I'm on fire every time we touch
Feel I'm burning, burning up
I'm on fire, I'm burning up

I am just a working man
Trying hard to do the best I can
Girl the loving that you bring
Make a working man a king

[Chorus x2]
