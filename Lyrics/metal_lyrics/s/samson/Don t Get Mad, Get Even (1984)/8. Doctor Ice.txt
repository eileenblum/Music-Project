Nerves of steel, a hand that never shakes
Iron will torture till you break
The time has come - you better run
The race is on to be number one

Doctor Ice [x2]

Senses chill as he comes to your place
Just a man - you'll never see his face
The time has come - you better run
The race is on from the lonely one

Doctor Ice [x4]

Feel his hands around your throat
Your breath is short - you begin to choke
Biting, fighting for your life
But you won't stop his grip of ice - good doctor

The time has come - so make a run

It's just begun - he's the lonely one
Doctor Ice Doctor Ice...
Come on now... Good God...
