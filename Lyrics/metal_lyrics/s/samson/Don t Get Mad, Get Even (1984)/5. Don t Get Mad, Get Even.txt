When all around you seem against you
You're a square peg in a round hole
Somebody trying to rope and fence you
Here's a bit of advice you should know
When I'm starting to boil - going out of my head
I remember the words my daddy said

[Chorus:]
Don't get mad - get even. It's the only game in town
Don't get mad - get even. Can't keep a good man
Keep a good man down
Down to the ground

When a lady tries to teach a lesson
Trying hard to make you look a fool
Shucking 'n' jiving an' messing
Try and remember - remember this rule
If you're getting tired of being a joke
Don't get all fired up - you're starting to choke

[Chorus]

Don't get mad - get even. It's the only game in town
Don't get mad - get even. Can't keep a good man
Keep a good man down
Can't keep him down

Don't play fair - play dirty
Where there's a will there's a way
Don't give in - don't show mercy
Every dog - every dog - every dog must have its day

Don't get mad - get even - don't get mad - get even [x2]
Get mad - get mad..........
