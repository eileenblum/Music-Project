You come knocking on my door
Looking like a promise of what's in store
Breezing in, how come so late?
Dress in a mess, hair in a state
Have mercy baby, you're putting this poor boy down
It ain't no good honey when you ain't around

Keep me dancing on a string
Driving me crazy for your lovin' thing
Then you turn off like I don't exist
Is there somebody new at the top of your list?
Have mercy baby, you're putting this poor boy down
It ain't no good honey when you ain't around.

Love hungry, love hungry, hungry for love [x2]

Keep me dancing on a string
Driving me crazy for your loving thing
Then you turn off like I don't exist
Well is there somebody new at the top of your list?
Have mercy baby, you're putting this poor boy down
It ain't no good, it ain't no good, ain't no, ain't no, ain't no good

Love hungry, love hungry, hungry for love [x2]
