Walking out on you [x2]

Easy chairs and an easy life
That's what I want from you
Just one rich bitch for an easy wife
Don't wanna do nothing new

Walking out on you [x2]

Loving you came so easily
When you laid your money down
Wouldn't bite the hand that was feeding me
Until you'd pay for my crown

[SOLO]

Living free came so easily
When you laid your body down
I led the way and you gave to me
Everything you ever had

Walking out on you [4x]
