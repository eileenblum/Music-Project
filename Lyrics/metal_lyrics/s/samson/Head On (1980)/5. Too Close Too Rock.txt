We had you trained to be so classical
Yes and you learned to play the guitar at school
But now we've caught you, you've been playing the fool
We don't think your musical taste is cool

[CHORUS:]
You were too close to rock and roll
I paid for the teacher so I own your soul

Move out of the house, you can't use the car
You spend your lectures just drinking in the college bar
You don't wanna get a job, you won't get far
Pretty soon you're gonna come home, gonna need your Ma and Pa

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO]

Too close to rock and roll
I paid for the man I own your soul
Leading me on you've been a bad bad boy
Betcha since you've been a kid, you've been a mama's toy

Aaaaaaaaaah!!!!

Too close to, too close to, too close to
Too close to rock and roll
