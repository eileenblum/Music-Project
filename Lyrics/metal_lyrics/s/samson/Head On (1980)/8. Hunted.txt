I'm the lion, king of the jungle
following my food home
Hunting around for some real life
Don't want to know where any fool knows

[CHORUS:]
Nobody understands me
Don't talk to me, I can't see
You're nailing my brain to a tree
Why can't you just let me be

If I wrote these words on paper
You would strangle them in your hands
Then sail on in your burning boats
into you promised land

[REPEAT CHORUS:]

[SOLO]

[REPEAT CHORUS (fade out)]
