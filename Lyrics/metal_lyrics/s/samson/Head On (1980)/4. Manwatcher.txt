Peeking at you, looking at you through the wall
Wanting you, your body looking so small
Teasing me, saying you are gonna do it
Touching me, loving me and lead me to it
Anytime, you wanna lay me, come and fetch it
Pretty tight, money maker never gets it

S-s-s-say you will, I'll welcome you to my place
Come inside, helping me to get it out
Open up, let me in I'm knocking for you
Looking out, no-one about to call for you
Get it up, walking out in early morning
Time to go, can I come again tomorrow?

[CHORUS:]
Hold tight, take the reins
Pushing harder feel the pain
Manwatcher, it's alright
Manwatcher , came tonight
Manwatcher , take the blame
Manwatcher , on the game

[SOLO]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
