Leading me on you've been a bad bad boy
Betcha since you've been a kid, you've been a mama's toy

I'm gonna teach you, you're gonna learn
Don't fool with me, I'm gonna make you burn

Little boy blue take off your shoe
Just come a little closer so my aim is true

But I don't wanna do it, gonna make you hop
It's hurting me, Is it hurting you?

[CHORUS:]
Take it like a man
Oh, gonna do it all I can
Take it like a man
Oh, gonna do it all I can
