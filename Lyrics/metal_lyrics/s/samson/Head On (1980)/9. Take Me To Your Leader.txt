Coming down to earth, and smiling cause you know I know
The mother ship has left you bleeding in the cold
I need a revelation open up and come with me
Take me to your leader, got a problem, want it solved

[CHORUS:]
Watcher of the skies
Look into my eyes
Watcher of the skies
Look into my eyes

I'm looking around and I wanna be up there [x2]

You taught me how to fly, I'm getting high I wanna cry
I can feel your saucer bur into my soul
I need a revelation open up and come with me
Take me to your leader, got a problem, want it solved

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I'm looking around and I wanna be up there [x2]

[SOLO]

Going home tonight, to bathe in everlasting light
The image in the starlight burns into my brain
I knew your astral plain was laying down the way for me
Take me to your leader, got a problem, want it solved

[REPEAT CHORUS (x2)]
