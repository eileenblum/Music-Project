Cold stove waiting for me when I get home 
No fire burns for me living on my own 
I could die in my sleep, nobody'd ever bother asking why 
Lying here, all alone listening to my soul cry 

I must be losing my grip 
I feel I'm slipping away 
Now the dawn's coming after me 
Lost another day 

Na na na na na... 

I was born in the middle of no time west of nowhere 
Looking for a saddle just to take my burden elsewhere 

I must be losing my grip 
I feel I'm slipping away 
Now the dawn's coming after me 
Lost another day 

Na na na na na... 

I must be losing my grip 
I feel I'm slipping away 
Now the dawn's coming after me 
Lost another day 

Na na na na na...
