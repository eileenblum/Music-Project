I'm running around from town to town
Playing the clown, cause it makes me happy
I doing alright, I've been drinking all night
I even had a fight, cause it makes me happy

But may be play my guitar
And end up as star
Just for Mr Rock`N`Roll

Playing so loud, I got my head in the clouds
Just to please the crowd, if it makes you happy
Blowing the fuse, just playing the blues
You know you just can lose, if it makes you happy

But may be play my guitar
And end up as star
Just for Mr Rock`N`Roll

Haven't you see
I want a steady feel
Just for Mr Rock`N`Roll

Mr Rock`N`Roll
Mr Rock`N`Roll
Mr Rock`N`Roll
Mr Rock`N`Roll

Playing so loud, I got my head in the clouds
Just to please the crowd, if it makes you happy
I doing alright, I've been drinking all night
I even had a fight, cause it makes me happy

But may be play my guitar
And end up as star
Just for Mr Rock`N`Roll

Haven't you see
I want a steady feel
Just for Mr Rock`N`Roll
