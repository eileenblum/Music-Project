I'm leavin', baby, leavin' you
I don't want nothing not from you
I'm sick and tired of hearing all of your lies
Nobody, baby, to dry your eyes

I'm leavin', baby, leavin' you
Don't even want you, no I'm sure
Don't even wanna making love to you

I tried to tell you once before,
That I was walking by at the door
How do you say that you don't going away
She's got opinion, baby, then she stay

I'm leavin', baby, leavin' you
Don't even want you, no I'm sure
Don't even wanna making love to you

I'm leavin', baby, leavin' you
I don't want nothing not from you
I'm sick and tired of hearing all of your lies
Nobody, baby, to dry your eyes

I'm leavin', baby, leavin' you
Don't even want you, no I'm sure
Don't even wanna making love to you

I'm leavin', baby, leavin'
