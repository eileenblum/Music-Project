You've been running since time began
But you're singing the same old thing
But don't worry, things will turn out right
Cause you'll see us in a different light
Now you're saying things don't seem so real
You're so dirty, so how does it feel
But don't worry, things will turn around
Cause you'll end up six feet under ground
