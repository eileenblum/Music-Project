You'll find us in the gutter
You pass us in the street
You really know us when you see us
You crush us with your feet
We're waiting, waiting for you

Big brother, he's coming through

We're biding, biding our time

Big brother, next in line
You'll find us in the future
When we are still alive
You know us when you see us
'Cause we're gonna survive
