Though you're far away
I know the feeling strong
No matter what they say
You can do no wrong
I'm caught in between the wrong side of time
Time again we asked
Would our love stay the same?
I check the post each day
There's nothing there again
I'm caught in between the wrong side of time
Lost inside a dream
That's how it all should be
Shake of reality
Now you're a part of me
You're a part of me
You're just a part of me
