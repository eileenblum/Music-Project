Can you hear me?
I ain't running away
Don't think you'd save me
Save me for a rainy day
You're just hanging on to a daydream

It's not as easy

It's not as easy as it seems
Would you take me
If I came back in a while
Or is your freedom
So much roll within a country mile
You're just drowning
In a river full of tear drops
I think it's high time
High time for those tears to stop
Stop, Stop !!!
