She likes to move the wrong way around
Feet in the air
Knees on the ground I can feel her coming
when she goes to town
Back to front and upside down
Everything she does is the wrong way around
She's inside out

She's inside out

She's inside out
Nose to the grind stone and into the ground
She was found and lost and lost and found
Close contact love, below and above
beyond and before, behind and what's more
She's inside out

She's inside out

She's inside out
Going the wrong way on a one way street
Sleeps with my head down by her feet
She don't need an incontinal sheet
Back to front that's how we meet
She's inside out

She's inside out

She's inside out
