[Samson / Aylmer]

Hey what's your name, what's that you're hiding?
Is that your car, you must be lying!!!
Pull in, hands up - so democratic...
If your face don't fit then there ain't nothing to it

Hey you, what's that you're doing?
Hey you, what's that you're saying?

Out on the streets, a social misfit
Now they retaliate with plastic bullets
Old scars of hate, so ultra modern
It's them or us who'll be downtrodden

Hey you, what's that you're doing?
'Cos this I gotta see...
Hey you, what's that you're saying?
Let's take the blood of the streets

I'd be fine if you'll just leave me alone
I'm giving you the truth
I've got one secret, a vision of two
I'll never be like you
