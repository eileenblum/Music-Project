[Samson]

It's been a while since I saw you
Do you still feel the same?
Your blues is always with me
Yes, I'm still in the game

Your stubborn pride and how you lied
It's still a problem to me
Your foolish ways, those happy days
All just a memory

It all comes back to you
You reap just what you sow
It all comes back to you
And brother, don't you know

Would you know me if you saw me?
Or do you even care?
Have you anybody out there?
What! Nobody nowhere?

You criticize, unsatisfied
That's how it seems to me
And all along, it's you who were wrong
It's there plain to see

It all comes back to you
You reap just what you sow
It all comes back to you
And brother, don't you know
