[Samson]

In the middle of nowhere
In the heart of time
I couldn't see beyond the walls around my mind
And between the motion
Swinging side to side
I should have looked into your eyes

I had a dream last night
And I was with you
I had a dream last night
Did you dream too?

When I saw your face
I couldn't stand the pain
I only knew I had to be with you again
Way beyond all reason
Against the march of time
This time I'm certain that I'm going to make you mine
