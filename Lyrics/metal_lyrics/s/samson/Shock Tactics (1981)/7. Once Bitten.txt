You don't move me
you don't stir me
You only cheat me
And I ain't gonna run around for you
You've got a bad reputation, I don't give a damn
You've got a bad reputation, I'm not a proud man
You've got a bad reputation, You've got a bad reputation
I've been bitten again, twice shy

I've been bitten again, twice shy

I've been bitten again, twice shy

I've been bitten again, twice shy
Always teasing at the end of the phone
I feel like a dog without a bone
You're talking dirty but I'm on my own
Coming on the end of the phone
