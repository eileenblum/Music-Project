[Bonus Track]Piston racing
Thunder tracing
Banshee wails in the desert
Take hold

Young boy falling
Young wives crying
Send a warning
Night is coming to the plains

Oh, little big man
Yeah little big man
Oh, little big man
You aren't so tall

Oh, little big man
Yeah little big man
Oh, little big man
You're gonna fall

Desert is bleeding
Vultures are eating
Send a fire
Light a fire in the sky

Young boys falling
Young wives crying
Send a warning
Night man coming over the hills

Oh, little big man
Yeah little big man
Oh, little big man
You aren't so tall

Oh, little big man
Yeah little big man
Oh, little big man
You're gonna fall

Did the devil take you when you were young, son?
Did the devil make you, take you for his own sweet lord?
Did the devil want you, want you for the ride?
Did the devil make you run a mile?
Run a mile for your soul?

Oh, little big man
Yeah little big man
Oh, little big man
You aren't so tall

Oh, little big man
Yeah, little big man
Yeah, little big man
You're gonna fall
