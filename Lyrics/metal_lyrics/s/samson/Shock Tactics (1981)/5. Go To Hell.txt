Get out, you're not my kind
Sleazy little lizzy thought you'd got another find
Yes I know you're big inside
Loud and proud, I know you're legs are open wide
Life can be so unkind

Bye, bye honey, lovely dovey, took you from behind

Maybe it's just as well

I took your body, blew your mind and told you Go to hell!
Filthy little female, who you married to?
Dirty little lady, I'm creeping up on you
Nice boy what you don't see
Your out of luck, you'll get no truck with me
Lousy little screamer played outside the rules
Took me for a dreamer but you were just a fool
Pretty male plaything made you feel alright
Took you for your money, now I'm off into the night
