A clock screams midnight
In the desperate heart of town
The same old nightmare
Something heavyâs going down

Shouting, screaming
Pain on every face
If you listen loud enough
You can hear it said
This ainât no fit place

The city sleeps within
Plans are laid for tonight
This calm is unstable
Just one little spark could ignite

Fire burning
Hate on every face
If you listen loud enough
You can hear it said
This ainât no fit place


Unheard warnings
Nothing heard, nothing seen, nothing done
You think itâs over
Stupid fool, itâs just begun

Shock, confusion
Shame on every face
If you listen loud enough
You can hear it said
This ainât no fit place
