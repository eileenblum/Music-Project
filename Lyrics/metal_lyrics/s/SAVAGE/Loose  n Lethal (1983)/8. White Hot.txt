Feel it rumbling
White hot and fit to burst
Hard rock fever
Burning up like some hell born curse
Rough cut allies
Lay low the chains of command
Endless power
Necessary for the demand

White hot, white hot rock
White hot, white hot rock

Red cells boiling
Ready for the axe attack
Silhouettes shaping
Like a dark light from out of the black
Light traces pulsing
A cold mist conceals the ground
Clenched fistâs raised up
Sway to the mood of the sound

White hot, white hot rock
White hot, white hot rock

Latent power
Force enough to make you bleed
Harder, faster
Raw to satiate their greed
Overshoot limits
Letâs take it to the point of abuse
Axe victims helpless
Crying out for mercy refused

White hot, white hot rock
White hot, white hot rock
White hot
White hot
White hot
