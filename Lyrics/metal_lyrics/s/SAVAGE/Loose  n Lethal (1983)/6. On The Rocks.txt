The cold shoulder 
And dirty black looks
Old well worn charm
Right down to the luck
This sad affair, who cares, just let it bleed
Two way exchange
Lost on a one way street

On the rocks
Let it bleed
On the rocks
Let it bleed

Pretty bad scene
Gotta get loose
Cause me and you girl
Weâre too bad news
Clean break, cut loose
A wolf left free to roam
Cause two into one
No it just donât go

On the rocks
Let it bleed
On the rocks
Let it bleed
Let it bleed
