See the opium warlords
Feuding in the golden states
Who wins takes the contracts
To feed the western tastes

On and on and on
From here to kingdom come
One slip, youâre hooked
One more fool on the China Run

From mountains deep in Asia
To the west, contraband by sea
Raw juice refined to addiction
Big bucks out in the streets

On and on and on
From here to kingdom come
One slip, youâre hooked
One more fool on the China Run


See the heroin dealer
Stealing off the kids getting high
On the edge, some kid slipping slowly
That final stepâs just a matter of time

On and on and on
From here to kingdom come
One slip, youâre hooked
One more fool on the China Run
