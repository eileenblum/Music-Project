Back street room near the subway line
Set the scene for this shady crime
A married man lays there compromised
Concealed the camera like a private eye

Somebodyâs playing dirty
And blackmailâs the name of this game
Set their sights on just one goal, cause
Dirty moneyâs their aim

Unmarked file contains the sight
Film so revealing from a previous night
Starts to shake, whatâs he gonna do
Whichever way heâll choose, heâs sure to lose

Somebodyâs playing dirty
And blackmailâs the name of this game
Set their sights on just one goal, cause
Dirty moneyâs their aim


Somebodyâs playing dirty
And blackmailâs the name of this game
Set their sights on just one goal, cause
Dirty moneyâs their aim

Midnight sidewalk in the bitter rain
To the ground he threw the burnt remains
Heâs paid the price so was this the end
Not a chance, poor little frightened man

Somebodyâs playing dirty
And blackmailâs the name of this game
Set their sights on just one goal, cause
Dirty moneyâs their aim
