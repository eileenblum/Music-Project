[Bonus Track]Trained to kill, paid to fight
No second thoughts if the price is right
Experience is what you need
A violent streak and a case of greed

When there's no
No cause to kill
Oh no no no
No cause to kill

Evil minds breed misdeeds
Their blind ambition is all they see
Hired killers hit hard and fast
Expect no mercy cause they're here to last

When there's no
No cause to kill
Oh no no no
No cause to kill

Bleeding hearts, too late again
Innocent dead lie among the flames
Hell on Earth, nowhere to go
Mercenaries out of control

When there's no
No cause to kill
Oh no no no
No cause to kill
