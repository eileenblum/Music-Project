[Bonus Track]You get your kicks fooling around
Lifting me up and turning me over and putting me down
You know I woudn't do that to you
Tell me woman, do you think I'm getting it through
Sold your soul so now what you gonna do
When the Devil, the Devil takes you

Late at night, getting uptight, sleeping alone
Turn on the light, somethings's not right, you didn't phone
You know I wouldn' do that to you
Tell me woman, do you think I'm getting through
Sold your soul so now what you gonna do
When the Devil, the Devil takes you

Devil may care, he's well aware you got no hope
Think you're alright but you're going out on that Hell bound slope
Tell me woman, just what you gonna do
Too late now, couldn't get right through to you
Sold your soul now there's nothing more to do
Now the Devil, the Devil's gonna take you
