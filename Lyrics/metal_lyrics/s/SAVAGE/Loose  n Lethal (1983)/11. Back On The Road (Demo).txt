[Bonus Track]Burned it out in Memphis
Was too long in L.A.
Felt so alone cause the one I miss
Oh she was too many miles away
So I'll keep right on fighting
Feelings true
Gotta get back on the road
On my way home to you

Played one nighters free for all
But still we made it pay
Ten thousand kids there all wanting more
But there's no way I'll stay
It's not I don't really care
But there's only one thing I wanna do
Gotta get back on the road
On my way home to you

There's two more nights in this city
Then it's all over for me
These one night stands been driving me crazy
You're all I want to see
So I'll keep right on fighting
Yes it's true
Gotta get back on the road
On my way home to you
