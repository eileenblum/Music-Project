Some say itâs easy
Like taking candy from a child
But still heâd hit the bottle
Like it was going out of style
He said heâd kicked the need
Holding a shot in his hand
But lifeâs plain indifference
Too much for this man

Gotta give it up
Heâs hooked on the stuff
Fooling no one but yourself
As you cry wolf
Pours out another cup
Well, Iâve seen enough
Fooling no one but yourself
Cry wolf

Got a taste for the hard stuff
His self respect hits the ground
Too much trust in the bottle
But the bottle leads down
Lost cry of the wasted
That nobody heard
Alcohol obituary
But nobody cared

Heâs gotta give it up
Heâs hooked on the stuff
Fooling no one but yourself
As you cry wolf
Pours out another cup
Well, Iâve seen enough
Fooling no one but yourself
As you cry wolf
