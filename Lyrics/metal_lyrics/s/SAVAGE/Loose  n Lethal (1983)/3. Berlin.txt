Itâs getting dark, too dark to see
The streets run cold with anarchy
Troopers came and all was lost
Mass slaughter, human holocaust

Fire over Berlin
Nobodyâs safe
No escape when metal rain starts falling
Berlin, itâs all too late

Thirty nine, machines of war
Cross frontier lines the eagle roars
Allied forces and Berlin falls
Razed to the ground, now the spoils

Fire over Berlin
Nobodyâs safe
No escape when metal rain starts falling
Berlin, itâs all too late


Too too much complacency
Too afraid to face reality
East to west the Berlin Wall
Thin red line from nuclear holocaust

Fire over Berlin
Nobodyâs safe
No escape when metal rain starts falling
Berlin, itâs all too late
Too late
