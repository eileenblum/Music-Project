Clipped my wings, they just wont let me fly
Leave me be or somethings gonna die
Sick inside I gotta get some space
Take a hike before I bust your face

I'm mad at the world
The rage within just grows
Tried so hard but I just can't
Let it go ... rage within
Let it go ... rage within
Just let it go ... rage within
Can't let it go ... rage within

Red mist falls, don't suffer fools no more
Light my fuse and watch me go to war
Count to ten but it ain't gonna pass
That ain't me cos good guys finish last

Who are you? To say life's a mess
Drives me wild to think that you know best
Take your rules, your schemes and good intent
Rage within, about to blow my vent
