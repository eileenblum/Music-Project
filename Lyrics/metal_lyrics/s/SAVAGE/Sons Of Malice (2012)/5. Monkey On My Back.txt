Don't think I've slept a wink in days
My world just fades into a haze
This lifes too much, I just can't stand
What can I do? I'm just a man

Sister says you're a mess, what'
Papa says discipline that's what you lack
Gotta monkey on your back
Monkey on your back, monkey on your back, monkey

Clarity's the bottom of a glass
Some pills and toke a little grass
Ain't no problem helps me cope
Hey fool that's why they call it dope

Mama says lost your way, please come back
Gotta monkey on your back
Brother says attitudes way off tack
Gotta monkey on your back
Monkey on your back, monkey on your back, monkey

Escape is just a state of mind
Care what you wish in case you find
Grace under pressure need a smoke
Lose self control and you're the joke

Friends say what the hell, need you find
Gotta monkey on your back
Boss says times are hard take up the slack
Gotta monkey on your back
Monkey on your back, monkey on your back
Monkey on your back, monkey on your back
Monkey on your back, monkey on your back,
Monkey on your back
