You are my enemy
Your end is guaranteed
I am a taker of souls
On wings of death I ride
All fear the samurai
For you the bell already tolls

War..........
I want it, I need it
I deal it, I breath it
Master of war
Master of war

Some weep as brother fall
In shame the cowards crawl
Honour those who fall
Upon the blade
My duty never ends
In time you'll comprehend
The warrior who stands the barricade

One mind as cold as ice
Resolved to sacrifice
I am soldier to the core
I am the warrior
Defined superior
I am a master of war
