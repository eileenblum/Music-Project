Gotta tale to tell
Gotta song to make you weep
Bout it a boy dragged through hell
A kid born the wrong side of the sheets
His mama passed early
Papa never gave a damn
Another hard luck story
Someday a wanted man

Jack went bad
Everyone could see
Now he runs
From the hangin' tree

What you want you gotta take ita
This kid would want it all
The die was cast lets face it
Always one step beyond the law
He rides like the wind
Got the taste and now greedy
Liquored up and bent on sin
A dozen men fell easy
