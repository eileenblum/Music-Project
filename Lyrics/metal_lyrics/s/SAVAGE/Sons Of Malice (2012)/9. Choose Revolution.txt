Times have changed
But its all just the same
Another jerk at the wheel
And were all gone in flames
Worlds getting smaller
And the rains coming hard
Go tell the man
We see through the facade

Where did it all go wrong?
We need solutions
Ain't got too long
So I choose revolution

Ain't about you
Cos its all about them
We gotta take to the streets
And loose a little mayhem
Worlds getting smaller
Running right outta space
Go tell the man
That its all gotta change

Gaia is dying
Have you not heard the news?
But the man keeps on smiling
As we choke on the fumes
Worlds getting smaller
And the airs getting thin
Go tell the man
We had enough of his spin
