Wasted my life
Wasted good times too
Wasted opportunities
In pursuit of you
Why collect my imperfections
Like there something to sell
Take a long hard look in the mirror
Take a look at your self

Look at yourself
You really so good
Look at yourself
Oh I think you should

Don't need your past
I don't need your pain
I don't need anybody
Driving me insane
Think you're so damn superior
Think you're so damn true
Think you're so damn indespensable
Well I got news for you

Who are you
Holding all the cards
WHat made you so negative
Don't know who you are
Why you so self destructive
Where's that gonna lead
Acting like you're judge and jury
Sentencing me
