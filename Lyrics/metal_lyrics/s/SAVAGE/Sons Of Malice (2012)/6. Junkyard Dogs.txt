More along, nothin here
What you see, ain't to share
This is my home, too much for some
Hell on earth, my kingdom come

You think you got got the stuff
Ya rough and tough enough
Made your peace with god?
Beware the junk yard dog
Junk yard dogs
Like a junk yard dog
Junk yard dogs

Let loos the dogs

Come the night, lockin down
Live in hope, none around
Beware the dog, read the sign
Cross my yard, cross a line

Beware the dog

Chew you up, spit you out
This dog bites, ain't no doubt
Mark my turf, no place to run
Dog eat dog, my will be done
