Midnight, and I'm in the road again
Had enough, when will this ever end?
Those who know, can never understand
What am I? Just what kind of man

What you do, it ain't cool
Ain't it true? Its all about you
I've been bruised, used and abused
Black 'n' blue

Here we go, what you do ain't what you say
Reason gone and the spirit just slips away
It ain't you, gotta hold over me
Push too far and someday you will see
