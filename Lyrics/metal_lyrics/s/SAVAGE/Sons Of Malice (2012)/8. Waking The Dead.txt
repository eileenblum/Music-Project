Wasted flesh, aching bones
Lost the will so you just stay at home
In a rut, out your prime
Take heart you still got the time

Make a point
Like you still really mean it
Scream out loud
Let them hear you still feel it
Hold that thought
While its still in your head
Shake it up, shake it out, shake a leg
Let's wake up the dead
Waking the dead
Waking the dead
Waking the dead

Autumn falls, slowing down,
Don't you stop till you're deep in the ground
Break some rules, take a chance
Don't give up gotta get out and dance

Here's a clue, seize the day
Life won't wait don't let it get in the way
Act your age, pay no mind
Celebrate this life while you're still alive

Rock 'n' roll grandad
