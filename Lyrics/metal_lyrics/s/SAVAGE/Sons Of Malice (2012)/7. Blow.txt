Come in, sit down
Take a load off, hang around
Good to meet you, step inside
You are welcome, for a while

Still you had to try and change me
You just couldn't let it be
I've been everything that you want
Everything but me

So pack up, take off
Shape up and ship out
Go home, back off
Cut loose and break out
Get out, get out, get out and stay out
Stay out; stay out, cos you're blown out ... blow

Say what? Get real
Let me tell you, here's the deal
I am what I am, that's a fact
But you knew this, from way back

Monkey see, monkey do
Did it all girl, just for you
But you've blown it, bottom line
Now its' my way, all the time
