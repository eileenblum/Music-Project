Look at us now
It's a good damn tragedy
Justice for all
Another white wash travesty

Out of spite, out of sight
Self absorbed and callous
Seek 'em her, seek 'em there
We seek those sons of malice

Pulling the strings
But always with impunity
Rolling the dice
Without care of humanity

Towers of gold
Built high on your apathy
Mammon is god
And he thrives on the enmity

Tear 'em down
