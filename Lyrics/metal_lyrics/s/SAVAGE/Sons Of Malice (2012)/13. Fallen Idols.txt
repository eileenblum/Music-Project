You're the one who sold your soul
To the demons of rock 'n' roll
In the end you sold us out
Big ideals all went south

Did you mean to fake it
Well that was suicidal, oh yeah
Crushed and burnt
But they never learn
Fallen idols

Like the worm you soon turned
Sold as seen no returns
Everything your heart desired
And screw those that you inspired

You can't fool all the people all of the time!
