Wasting my time, wasting my life
Thatâs what they say about my kind
But I ainât gonna shout, I ainât gonna fight
Just dance the night away

No need to lose your head, or lose control
You donât need no pocket full
Feel the rock ânâ roll, come on let go

Let the world go crazy
When the feeling is right
Throw your cares out of sight
Come on, let it go
Let the world go crazy
Come on, let it go

Time lingers on, timeâs getting hard
Iâm getting wize but Iâm older
But Iâve got my pride, timeâs my own
Though my money is long gone
Seems like the worldâs gone by, left me behind
It may be a substitute for a dream
God knows, Iâm gonna tell you
