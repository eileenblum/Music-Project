You glitter like gold
But I see through imitation
I canât be bought
With infra-red instead of sun

The video vamp
Cashing in on blind emotion
With your kinda smile
You are the tin God of them all

Theyâre screaming for your sweet talk
You sold a million more
You may be top slot
But youâre only girlâs talk

Innocence, your sweet pretence
Itâs all amiss thatâs what it is
A melody that ainât on my list

M.T.V.âs star
The hero of the cathode ray tube
Theyâll turn you on
When their mothers say they can

âCoz money is all
a million pennies make a fortune
with your hip shakinâ jive
you are the tin God of them all

They overkilled your airplay
You sold a million more
Whispers in the playground
Girls will talkâ¦

Somebodyâs got a crush on you
