Itâs all the same, does nothing change
So who could care, when itâs over there
A childâs at stake, for pityâs sake
How long can we, just let it be

Donât let the children cry
Sooner or later, mother nature
Bares the soul, we canât control
Brother nation, poor relation
We must relent, for the innocents
Father can you hear me
How far Jerusalem
Forgive me but did you say
As I recall, suffer the children
