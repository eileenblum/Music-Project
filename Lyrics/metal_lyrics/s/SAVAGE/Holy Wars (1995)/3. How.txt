Father
Told us of glories gone
Brother
You were my fatherâs son
Father
You said God was on our side
So if he was
Why in the name of God
Was my brother sacrificed ?

Tell me how the cause was won
Boys to men we march along
A heroâs still a motherâs son
Tell me how the cause was won

Mama
A sonâs the price you paid
Sister
Who will wipe your tears away
Mama
Will you take this to your grave ?
And did your heart burst ?
Your son placed in the dirt
Will we evre be the same again ?
