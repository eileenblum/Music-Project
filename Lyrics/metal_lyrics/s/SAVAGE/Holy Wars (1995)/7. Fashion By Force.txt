Crazies in the still of the night
Armed and ready looking for a life
They got the look that means no good
Out to satisfy a growing taste for blood

Itâs all the rage
The latest craze
Par for the course
Fashion by force

Jack heâs a real strange guy
Right out of the blue he blew his mind
Inside a demon crawls
Shark eyes, stone cold animal

Eastside first street and main
Sirens wail all too late again
These guys you canât foresee
No cause, somebodyâs history
