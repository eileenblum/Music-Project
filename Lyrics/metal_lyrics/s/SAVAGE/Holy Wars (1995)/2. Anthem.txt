Hey you with your head in the air
Get your feet on the ground
âCause thereâs nothing up there
Itâs sad, itâs bad, wize up â donât you know
Youâve been had
You boy with the grin on your face
Think you act real cool
But youâre such a disgrace
Inside, soft hide
Talk real fast but youâre still tongue tied

We can beat this thing together
This is your song, Anthem

Hey girl, why go with the flow
When the worldâs at your feet
And youâre in control
Your date, with fate, slips away if you hesitate
Young man, they got you all confused
Donât you pay no mind
You got nothinâ to lose
Say hey, no way, had enough now get outta  my way

We can beat this thing together
We are strong, Anthem

Hey you with your face in the dirt
You know itâs there for the taking
Still you act like a jerk
I tell you, true blue, stares you in the face
Still you havenât got a clue
Old man laid out in the dust
Got your gear change gone
And your main drives rust
Left cold, too old, donât you quit for that
line youâve been sold

We can beat this thing together
We are strong, Anthem
