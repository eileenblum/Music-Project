Brother, what colour ?
One nation, some dream
Still there are, those who
Would see it differently
But why can, one man
Choose anotherâs, destiny
Ainât I right, itâs your life
Resistance is the key

DÃ©tente breakdown, this means war
Their systemâs failing, the nations fall
Time out, canât stall
God damned, this means war

Leaders, mislead us
For their, greater glory
Hands tied, you take sides
But whoâs your, enemy
Wize up, get tough
Itâs there, plain to see
Total, power
Corrupts totally

Conflicts of interest
The same old story
One man has hunger
The next man jealousy
Put aside those old ties
Prejudice, pretty greed
One try in his life
We donât need this misery
