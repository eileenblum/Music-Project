Mama said step outta line
Theyâll put a rope on you
Iâve heard it all a thousand times
Oh mama if you only knew
Iâve been through Hell and back
The truth I have tasted
Mama gave such good advice
On me it was wasted

We are the glory boys
Bad boys, big noise
All for glory boys

Had enough, weâre outta school
Donât suit our style at all
Papa says your attitude
Will get you five down city hall
Preacher says the road to Hell
Takes my point of view
Well, God helps those who help themselves
Now would I lie to you
