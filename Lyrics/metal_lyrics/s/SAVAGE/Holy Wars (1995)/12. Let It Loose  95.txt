We wonât need to intimidate you
If we get a major breakthrough
So come on â let it loose

Youâve all seen this all before
So come on, get up and off of the floor
Letâs go â let it loose

Weâre not here to read your rights
Tonightâs the night you do what you like
Hey you there â let it loose

If itâs much too loud, well, we donât care
Are you ready â let it loose

Going crazy

Weâve the goods to appetise
Take it all, donât compromise
Let it loose

Forget tomorrow, weâre here today
Is it what you want, are you here to stay
What do you say â let it loose
