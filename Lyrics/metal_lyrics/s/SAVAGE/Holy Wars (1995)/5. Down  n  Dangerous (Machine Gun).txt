I donât look for trouble
He ainât no friend of mine
Got a nasty reputation
That suits my frame of mind
Child of the urban jungle
They planned as paradise
Tower blocks and human garbage
Genocide

When the going get rough
Get tough
When enough is enough
Make a fuss
Get d, d, d, down and dangerous

The street ainât got no pity
Not this here danger zone
Donât come looking for mercy
Compassion ainât at home
So if youâre lookinâ to rumble
Youâd better apologise
I say like you and whoâs army
kiss your as goodbye
