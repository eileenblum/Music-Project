Juvenile on the corner
Cuts up rough just to make ends meet
Users in the subway
Pumpinâ juice outta sight of the heat

The law of the jungle
Lightning strikes
Red light, fair warning
Danger signs, streets of fire

Streetgirl makinâ small change
Turning tricks for nickels and dimes
Some loser take the last fall
Swinging from the end of a line

Danger awaits you
Eyes in the shadows, you crawl
Something will waste you
Overdosed, blown away, street mauled
