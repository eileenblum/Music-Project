No one gets the jump on me
Iâm my own man
I donât bend too easily
Hot blood fits me hand in glove
The bottom line

First when push comes to shove
My patience is wearing thin
You know it donât last long
Donât pin no badge on me
Back off
Iâm headstrong

Loose lips, tact ainât my style
âCause talk is cheap
Action not compromise
Reckless, care ainât in my blood
If fools rush in
This fool canât get enough

Suits me, you take your own sweet time
âCause Iâll step in
I donât see no danger signs
Hot head keep your hands off me
Donât push your luck
âCause I need my liberty
