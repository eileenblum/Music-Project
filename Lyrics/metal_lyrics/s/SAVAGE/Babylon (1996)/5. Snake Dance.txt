Smile that Judas smile
Confident with a hint of style
Doctor spins you twists and lies
Manipulated, paralysed

Read the signs
Enter the realm of the fake
Hypnotized
Witness the dance of the snake

Money talks, the power game
Greace the wheels some gravy train
Kick backs and the slight of hand
Would conscience break a lesser man

Read the signs
Enter the realm of the fake
Hypnotized
Witness the dance of the snake

Beware the tabloid eye
Indiscrete, compromised
Scandal sheet a public face
Profumo, Watergate

Read the signs
Enter the realm of the fake
Hypnotized
Witness the dance of the snake
