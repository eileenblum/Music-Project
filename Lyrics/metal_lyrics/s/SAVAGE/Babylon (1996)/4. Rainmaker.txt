Like Cain and Abel
We are brothers
Now we alienate
By creed and colour

Rainmaker
Wash away the sun
Make it rain, we never learn
Naked we are one
Colour us gone

Paranoia fed
By new religion
Cycles of hate
Culture collision

Rainmaker
Wash away the sun
Make it rain, we never learn
Naked we are one
Colour us gone

Ignorance is mine
The guilty claim
Head down in the sand
Deflect the blame

Symptom of the past
The strong enslave
Lessons could be learned
We never change

Rainmaker
Wash away the sun
Make it rain, we never learn
Naked we are one
Rainmaker
Rainmaker
Rainmaker
Naked we are one
