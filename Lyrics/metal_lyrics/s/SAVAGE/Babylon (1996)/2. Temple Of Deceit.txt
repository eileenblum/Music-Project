Donât believe a word they preach
The agenda is deceit
With the grace of a righteous man
The persona hides the sham
Take a cultural warp by fear
And the lies donât seem so clear
They sit at godâs right hand
This ainât no promised land

The truth is no high priest
In the temple of deceit
Lies, hate, fear, faith

Just who are these pious few
To lay their guilt on you
With their lies of type and race
Tolerance fades to hate
From the right their factions draw
Bigotry, not holy war
The hypocrisy has no end
In their new Jerusalem

The truth is no high priest
In the temple of deceit
Lies, hate, fear, faith

Until thy kingdom come
The just whos will be done
Prophets of control
Justice without soul
Holy words should not repress
Liberty is no weakness
And where dogma has no sway
Thereâs no fear come judgement day

The truth is no high priest
In the temple of deceit
Lies, hate, fear, faith
