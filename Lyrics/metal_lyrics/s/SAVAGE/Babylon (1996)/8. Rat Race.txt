In too deep
Fail to keep in black
Hope to sleep cause
I ainât all right jack

To run the risk
Faced with this
I sympathise
Fail to find
Your peace of mind
No paradise
Hard way to learn
This time youâre gonna burn

Gotta get some money
Gimme lots of money

Keep you faith in
Your chance to win back
Game on time to
Take on those who lack
Can beat the rest
What they do best
Itâs do or die
Trust in fate
Retaliate
No suicide
Solution
Take the green and run

Gotta get some money
Gimme lots of money

Got enough green stuff
To make the world go round
Rat race, get a taste
Might just take you down, stick around
