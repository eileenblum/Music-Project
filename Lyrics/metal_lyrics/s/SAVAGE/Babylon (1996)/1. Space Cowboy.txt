Junk will break you
Shit it shakes you
On a trip to hell
Got to face it
You canât fake it
Like you did so well

Enough is enough, bye bye
Space cowboy, cosmic high
Shoot âem up, feel the rush
Think youâre cool, get serious

Cool is voodoo
Think youâre smooth too
Rollercoaster ride
Concept jaded
Blown and faded
Ainât no sixties child

Enough is enough, bye bye
Space cowboy, cosmic high
Shoot âem up, feel the rush
Think youâre cool, get serious

Acid take you
Complicates you
In a world of dreams
Marijuana
Fools nirvana
Got to blow this scene

Enough is enough, bye bye
Space cowboy, cosmic high
Shoot âem up, feel the rush
Think youâre cool, get serious
