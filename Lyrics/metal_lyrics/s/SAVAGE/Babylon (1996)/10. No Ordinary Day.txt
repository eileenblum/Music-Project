If I sleep I sleep the bed of nails
I dream to dream, reason fails me
If I could save the day, your pain is my pain
Chains and ties of a dying flame

This is 
No ordinary day
Try not to give myself away
No ordinary day
If I could fade away

Down the road, confusion as a friend
My faith in me questioned at the end
Sometimes we canât be all that we believe
Complicated, this wicked web we weave
But now I sleep so deep, I pray the better man
I dream the dream, hope I never can live again

No ordinary day
Try not to give myself away
No ordinary day
If I could fade away

No ordinary day
Try not to give myself away
No ordinary day
If I could fade away
I would

If I should die in my sleep
Will my soul go to the deep
While I live this I can tell
Guilt can be a living hell, burning, burning
