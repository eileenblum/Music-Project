Some guys greed create the danger
In the air we breathe choking mother nature
Acid rain, seas of emotion
Sails preen peace, drop in the ocean

One world in strife
What hope out tribe
If we speak in tongues
Welcome to Babylon
Babylon
Babylon

Rage, war, hate, cultural confusion
Fools, mass debate, final solutions
Urban decay, over populated
Fields of dead, religious hatred

One world in strife
What hope out tribe
If we speak in tongues
Welcome to Babylon
Babylon
Babylon

C.F.C.s bring global warming
Break the seals, revelation warning
Toxic waste, industial pollution
Ethnic cleansed, revolution

One world in strife
What hope out tribe
If we speak in tongues
Welcome to Babylon
Babylon
Babylon 
Babylon
Babylon
