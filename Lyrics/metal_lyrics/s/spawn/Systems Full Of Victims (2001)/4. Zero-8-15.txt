Where Are The Gods?
We Want To Know Them
Where Are The Laws?
We Want To Read Them
Where Are The Leaders?
We Want To See Them
Where Is The Hate?
We Want To Feel It

War Prayers Are Sent Guardian Angels
In Their Hands The Symbols For The Victory
But Nobody Can See Them
War Is Coming
The Time To Obey Our Leaders
To Control Strange Life
To Kill The Alleged Enemies
By Order Of Fairness?
We Hate This Inhuman Practise
