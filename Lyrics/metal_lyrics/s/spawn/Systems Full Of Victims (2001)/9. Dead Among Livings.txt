No Expectation
Isolation
No Redemption
Isolation
No Joining Hands
Isolation
No Circles Of Friends
Isolation

Life's Like Living In A Condemned Cell
Without Contact To External World
Into Be There Left Behind Alone
Isolation
Sad Sobering Down

The Bones And Skin Are Gnawed
Blessed With Isolation
The Eyes Are Hollowed
Blessed With Isolation
Rancid Smell All Over
Blessed With Isolation
In Dirty And Damp Environs
