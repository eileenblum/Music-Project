Whispers In Darkness
When The Night Comes Down
The Life Is In The Minority
Unholy Flames Of Desire
The World Another Hell

Where You Will Run To Now
Where Is The Friendly Smile
It`s So Sad To Be Alone
Body Terror

Help Me Make It Through The Night
Yesterday Is Dead
And Gone Tomorrow
Is Out Of Sight
Now It`s My Shakra Time

Body Terror
To Get The Fear
Who Can Decide
To Live Or Die
Sadistic Evil Toys
Are Playing With My Mind
The Evil....
Sucks My Dick
Virgin Come
Play With Me
Body Lust
Overcomes Me
I`m The Evil
The Evil You Fear
Enter Madness
Insanity
