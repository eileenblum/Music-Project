[Music by A. KovÃ¡cs, Ã. Fellegi, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

It's overrated magic
This fairy's such a liar
She's sleeping in your room
And flies with the colours of
This tragic absolution
Gotta purify with fire
Flirt with the crack of doom

Safe and calm we're in your sacred realm
Little sister of disaster
And bear no fear, we stay right here
Until the end of time and ever after

Bear no fear
We stay right here

She soaked herself in poison
This piece of meat is murder
Stimulation of this gloom
And show of the colours, but
It's accelerated so much
Can't take this thing any further
Crawl back into her womb

Safe and calm we're in your sacred realm
Little sister of disaster
And bear no fear, we stay right here
Until the end of time and ever after

Stiff - in bloom
Calm - in bloom
Safe - in bloom
Embalmed - in bloom

Bear no fear
We stay right here

Safe and calm we're in your sacred realm
Little sister of disaster
And bear no fear, we stay right here
Until the end of time and ever after
