[Music by Zs. SzentpÃ©teri, A. KovÃ¡cs, Ã. Fellegi, Lyrics by K. Derby, A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

I adore ya, I abhore ya

Obsession, possession, addiction, destruction

I drank her blood, she made me high
I'll never defy, my, my
Vampire girl, vampire girl, vampire girl, vampire girl

Come alive - obsession, possession, addiction, blood
Come alive - attraction, aggression, destruction, blood

Obsession, possession, addiction, destruction

She broke my heart, she stole my soul
She's out of control, out of control
Vampire girl, vampire girl, vampire girl, vampire girl

Come alive - obsession, possession, addiction, blood
Come alive - attraction, aggression, destruction, blood

I loathe ya, I want ya, I unclothe ya, oh Natasha

Come alive, come alive
Come alive - obsession, possession, addiction, blood
Come alive - attraction, aggression, destruction, blood
