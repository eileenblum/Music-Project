[Music by A. KovÃ¡cs, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Tied up, tied together
What's it like to need her?
Out of reach, yet here forever
Long gone, so what's with the fever?

Feeding on her breasts I'm bound to petrify
Anything just to break her
Drinking blood till we suck each other dry
Looking bright into the future

Grown up, grown together
What does it take to believe her?
Fresh start, yet another
Then gone so who's the deciever?

Feeding on her breasts I'm bound to petrify
Anything just to break her
Drinking blood till we suck each other dry
Looking bright into the future

Steal these souls, and do away with the questions
Heal these thoughts, and pray with open arms
