[Music by A. KovÃ¡cs, Ã. Fellegi, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

It's the state of the art or it's a cleaver
It's the end of the world or it's a line
While you're tolling all the bells and scare the people
Let it go, let it turn into dust to be divine

It's a blade, it's an axe, or it's the answer
It's the shape of things to come, or

It's the state of the art of it's a cleaver
It's the end of the world or it's a line
While you're tolling all the bells and scare the people
Let it go, let it turn into dust to be divine

It's a sabre, it's a knife, or it's a savior
It's the end of the world, or

It's the state of the art of it's a cleaver
It's the shape of things to come or just a line
While you're calling all your gods and torch your leader
Let it go, let it burn into ash to be divine

And it's a needle - reflection through the eyes
And it's a reason - shot of blood that this body denies

Is it the best rate - or a flat line
Or a second chance - or a bad time

Get it, do you get it?

State of the art of it's a cleaver
It's the end of the world or it's a line
While you're tolling all the bells and scare the people
Let it go, let it turn into dust to be divine
State of the art of it's a cleaver
It's the shape of things to come or just a line
While you're calling all your gods and torch your leader
Let it go, let it burn into ash to be divine
