[Music by A. KovÃ¡cs, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

The devil you run with - one you can call your own
Giants you fight with - ones that you call your own

To die for nothing cuts through the bone
Cry loud, it feels less alone

Say it ain't so
Say it ain't so

A demon you dance with - one you can call your own
A monster you sleep with - someone to call your own

To die for nothing cuts through the bone
Cry loud, it feels less alone

Say it ain't so
Say it ain't so
To die for nothing cuts through the bone
Cry loud, it feels less alone

One you can call your own
Someone to call your own

The devil you run with
Giants you fight with
Demons you dance with
Monsters you sleep with
