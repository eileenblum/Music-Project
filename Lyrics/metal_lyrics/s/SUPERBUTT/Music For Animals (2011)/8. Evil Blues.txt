[Music by T. PrÃ¡znek, A. KovÃ¡cs, Ã. Fellegi, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Look at me now, I might be talking to you then
Look at me now, it might as well be you
Just like a storm, you make it stop I know you can
Ease the life that this mysery's putting me through
All that it's putting me through

Look at me now how I'm ripping my heart out, this show will never be over
Look how the half eyed is leading the blind and their kingdom is sliding on water
Oh God denies - it's hurting but you need this don't you
Just love my scars, open up and my scars will love you too

Look at me now, I might be talking to you then
I'm firing at will and it might as well be you
Just like a flame, you make it glow I know you can
Burn this life that this mysery's putting me through
All that it's putting me through

Look at me now how I'm ripping my heart out, this show will never be over
Look how the half eyed is leading the blind and their kingdom is sliding on water
Oh God denies - it's hurting but you need this don't you
Just love my scars, open up and my scars will love you too

Open up, look at me now - my scars will love you too
Open up, look at me now - my scars will love you too

Look at me now how I'm ripping my heart out, this show will never be over
Look how the half eyed is leading the blind and their kingdom is sliding on water
Oh God denies - it's hurting but you need this don't you
Just love my scars, open up and my scars will love you too

Look at me now - my scars will love you too
Oh God denies - it's hurting but you need this don't you
Just love my scars - my scars will love you too
