[Music by A. KovÃ¡cs, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

And now we're spinning the tale
We set off this bomb, and watch trains derail
Have the spirit unveiled
Aim at the devil, and just keep shooting cause
Revolting kids never fail
Revolting kids never fail
Revolting kids never fail but today
Aim at the devil, and just keep shooting

Cause we're brothers, we're brothers
Till death will do us, till death will do apart
Burn the sign across the heart
Because we're brothers you see
And nothing could be, larger than this life
Loaded guns and pointed knives

And now we're spinning the tale
We set off this bomb, and watch trains derail
Have the spirit unveiled
Aim at the devil, and just keep shooting cause
Revolting kids never fail
Revolting kids never fail
Revolting kids never fail but today
Aim at the devil, and just keep shooting

Cause we're brothers, we're brothers
Aren't we brothers, till death will do her part
Burns the sign across the heart
Because we're destined you see
And together we'll be, larger than this life
With loaded guns and pointed knives

And now we're spinning the tale
We set off this bomb, and watch trains derail
Have the spirit unveiled
Aim at the devil, and just keep shooting cause
Revolting kids - can't fail
Revolting kids - can't fail
Revolting kids - can't fail
Revolting kids - can't fail
