[Music by A. KovÃ¡cs, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

One more hit and we break through the wall
One more punch and my hand fits through the hole
To tickle the void and to reach for the break and the fall

The break and the fall and the death of us all
And the end of control and the light set adrift on a ray
Hope gets up and walks away
A stuffed pig rears her head
Begs to differ till we swallow what she said

Do no wrong, do no wrong
Let her sleep while we're singing along
With our choir of angels and our souls to save
Oh, save'em all up for the dawn of a better day

One more hit and we break through the wall
One more punch and my hand fits through the hole
To reach for the break and the fall

The break and the fall and the death of us all
And the end of control and the light set adrift on a ray
Hope gets up and walks away
A stuffed pig rears her ugly head
No more to say, she gave us what she had

Do no wrong, do no wrong
Let her sleep while we're singing along
With our choir of angels and our souls to save
Oh, save'em all up for a better day
Do no wrong, do no wrong
Let her bleed while we're screaming along
With a cross to bear and our souls to save
Oh, save'em all up for the dawn of a better day

Adrift on a ray
Hope walks away
A pig rears her head
Begs to differ till we swallow what she said

Do no wrong, do no wrong
Let her sleep while we're singing along
With our choir of angels and our souls to save
Oh, save'em all up for a better day
Do no wrong, do no wrong
Let her bleed while we're screaming along
With a cross to bear and our souls to save
Oh, save'em all up for the dawn of a better day
