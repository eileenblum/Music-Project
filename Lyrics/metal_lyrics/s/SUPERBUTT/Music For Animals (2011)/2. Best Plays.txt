[Music by T. PrÃ¡znek, Ã. Fellegi, A. KovÃ¡cs, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Your head's sticking out - sideways
You've always been a shiner - use that flair
We leave no one out - of the best plays
Words of a clown and a reaper - it's all in there

Sweet flavour fill me up!

Sweet Jesus lead me on
Play this song on your radio
Lead me on and I'll go to hell
Could be worth it for all we know

Sweet Jesus lead me on!

Sweet savour fill me up
Colour my taste, make me glow
Fill me up, lead me to hell
Could be worth it for all we know

Your head's sticking out - sideways
You've always been a shiner - use that flair
We leave no one out - of the best plays
Words of a clown and a reaper - it's all in there

Sweet Jesus - sweet slayer
Fill me up - make me glow
Lead me on - straight to hell
Turn me up - make me know

Your head's sticking out - sideways
You've always been a shiner - use that flair
We leave no one out - of the best plays
Way to dig in deeper - it's all in there
