[Music by A. KovÃ¡cs, Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Will I ever learn to fly or I stay where I belong?
Dead spirits shake their bones to the rhythm
Will I ever learn to be more than a bitter song?
Will I ever stop searching everywhere?

Everywhere

Step aside, there's nothing to see here
Switch it off, there's nothing to hear
Turn around, there's no reason to be here
Stand down, disappear

Will I ever care to learn and find that I don't belong?
Dead hearts long to solve the riddle
Will I ever dare to be the one mighty and strong?
Will I ever stop searching everywhere

There's nothing there

Dead spirits - everywhere
Dead hearts - everywhere

"Una prostituta nunca debe cerrar los ojos"

Will I ever learn to fly or I stay where I belong?
Dead spirits shake their bones to the rhythm
Will I ever dare to be the one mighty and strong?
Will I ever stop searching everywhere

There's nothing there
