[Lyrics by K. Derby]

Rub a dub tub, two men in a tub
And who do you think theyâd be?
Osamo and Georgie laying down plans
To fuck-up you and me.

Georgie Pordgie, pudding and pie
Sent some bombs to make you die.
When your children couldnât play
Georgie Pordige whacked away.

Mother gooses me, mother gooses you
Lifeâs a nursery rhyme, so what else is new?
Youâre fucking me, Iâm fucking you
What else is new? What else is new?

Eenie meenie minie moe
Catch a martyr by his toe
If he pulls the pin youâll know
Youâve been fucked by Osamo.

Mother gooses me, mother gooses you
Lifeâs a nursery rhyme, so what else is new?
Youâre fucking me, Iâm fucking you
What else is new? What else is new?
