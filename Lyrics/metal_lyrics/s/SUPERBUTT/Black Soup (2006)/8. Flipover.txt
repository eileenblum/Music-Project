[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Shake it up sister, make this a good one, will ya
Kiss life, before it kills ya
Speak no truth just give me something that I like
Grab on my good will and hold on tight

Jump sister, get up and jump now
Before you would have to pay
Just do a flip for me and I let you get away

Shake it sister, make it good, will ya
Please life, before it kills ya
Throw your feet up show me something that I like
Grab on my ... an hold on tight

Jump sister, over the fence
Before your bill is out, and you'd have to pay
Just do a flip for me and I let you get away
