[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Hello! Cheer the leash that you chose!
Smile and say hello! Cheer the leash that you chose!

Stand still, blindfold, shake hands, connive
Young blood, step out, believe, strive
Pick your card, pick one out of five
Or if you feel, if you feel alive

Then take this town
And turn it around
Tear down and burn
Everything that you find

Hello! Cheer the leash that you chose!

Bitter, naked, cold sweat, shrive
New hope, fresh wound, anger, revive
Pick your card, pick five out of five
Or if you feel, if you feel alive

Then take this town
And turn it around
Tear down and burn
Everything that you find
