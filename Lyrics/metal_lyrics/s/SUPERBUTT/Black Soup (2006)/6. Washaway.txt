[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Read their lips and give them something to say
Read their minds and give'em a reason to pray
Be a friend of your demons today
Shake the hands of Mr. Disarray

Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!
Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!

Sit, and see how they spin
They fly in the air, gently touching your skin
Keep them in the house, fix' em with a pin
They will sweeten your drink and the poison within

Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!
Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!

Be a spark and light the hay
Be a flood and wash it away
Reveal the truth today
Wash it all away!

Read their lips and give them something to say
Read their minds and give'em a reason to pray
Be a friend of your demons today
Shake the hands of Mr. Disarray

Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!
Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!

Be a spark and light the hay
Be a flood and wash it away
Reveal the truth today
Wash it all away!
