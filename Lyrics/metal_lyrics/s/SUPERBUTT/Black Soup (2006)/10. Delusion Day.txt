[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

For a second I thought that I could
Possess the time and make it mine
Felt like it was only a dance
Steps back and forth across the line
I thought that a gun could fire itself
And innocently lead astray
And that a bullet could set its own course
And fly, wherever it may

Oh delusion day, rise!
Reach out for the pearl but it's behind glass
Oh delusion day, rise!
Reach out for the girl but it's just a dress
Oh delusion day, rise!

I can see through the bars, but I never pass...
