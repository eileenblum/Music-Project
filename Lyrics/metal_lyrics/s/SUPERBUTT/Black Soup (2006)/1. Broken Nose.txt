[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Hold it, just stop for a minute
You got it all wrong, now put that down 
Before the boogieman comes to get it
Stop that, hold on for a minute
You got that wrong, all the way long
It burns your hands, just drop it!

All sighs
God just turned off the lights
All the rights
Are reserved to the house, you're knocked out, and

Now your nose is bleeding
Drips on your innocent believing
Now your nose is bleeding
Too bad you get no compensation

Cut that, slow down for a minute
You know it's not right, just put that down
Before the boogieman comes to get it
Stay out, step aside for a minute
Pull it back, you're on the wrong track
Read the signs and stop it!

Too bad you won't gt anything in return
Look, you're bleeding, but you never learn
This trip of yours is nothing new
Too bad we all have to follow you
