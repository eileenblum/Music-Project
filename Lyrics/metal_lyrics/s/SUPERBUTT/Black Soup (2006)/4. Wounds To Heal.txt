[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

It's calm, oh so calm, nothing will hurt anymore
All harm done is way behind, just a scratchmark left on the door
It's all white, so white, scars distract me no more
It shines, oh so bright, it colors the blood on the floor

Oh God I miss the pain, a thing that is real
As I wait for the wounds to heal
I'd cut myself again, just to know I can still feel
I wait for the wounds to heal

It's quiet, oh so quiet, no one disturbs anymore
... speaks to me, but she says nothing, she's just a bore
It's white, oh so white - a flake of the peace that I found
Oh it falls, comes down on me, it covers the blood on the ground

Oh God I miss the pain, a thing that is real
As I wait for the wounds to heal
I'd cut myself again, just to know I can still feel
I wait for the wounds to heal
