[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Look, how incredibly strong I am
My shoulders hold a ton of weight
Trouble lives next door, we meet every day
It pushes me around, but I stand sraight
Look, how incredibly solid I am
I'm a concrete block, I'm a truckload of steel
Mysery drives down my street every day
But I block the road and I stop its wheel

I won't let you sink, come, swim in my lake
You can trust me, I'm fake!

Look, how incredibly resistant I am
I protect and I serve and I stand the pain
I die a hundred times every day
But I get up and I fight again
Look, how incredibly reliable I am
You can count on my words, whatever they mean
Turn me on, I'm here every day
My voice will keep you safe and clean

I won't let you sink, come, swim in my lake
You can trust me, I'm fake!

Get up on my back and relax, you're going to fly
I can make you do it, you just have to try
You can make a difference, why always comply?
Come after me and you'll learn how to lie

I won't let you sink, come, swim in my lake
You can trust me, I'm fake!
