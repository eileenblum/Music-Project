[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Let's make it last just a little bit longer
It's here and now and we never get older
I got freedom in a bag on my shoulder
It's here and now, go get some!

Get some of it, get some of it, baby
Break down your walls an run
Just the way you've dreamed of it, baby
Kick the motherfuckers, have some fun!

Doesn't it make y'all wanna go 'whoaooo'?
Isn't it the right time?

So let's make it last just a little bit longer
It's here and now and we never get older
I got freedom in a bag on my shoulder
It's here and now, go get some!
