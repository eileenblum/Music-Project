[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

You shall walk alone - stop seeing
Ghosts live on their own - give up believing

Man, you gotta rock the scene,
I can see it in your eyes, that you want to
Try hard, and be a better machine,
because the one that you are is a wreck and it won't do

You shall walk alone - give up believing

Man, you gotta build yourself up,
I can see it in your eyes, that you want to
Try hard, and be a better machine,
because the one that you are is a wreck and it won't do

You notoriously promise that you stop being a pain
But you keep coming back and you're just the same again

Man, you gotta use the force
I can see it in your eyes, that you want to
Try hard, and be a better machine,
because the one that you are is a wreck and it won't do

You notoriously promise that you stop being a pain
But you keep coming back and you're just the same again

You shall walk alone - give up believing

Man, you gotta save the world
I can see it in your eyes, that you want to
Try hard to be a better machine,
because the way that you are you're a wreck and you won't do

You notoriously promise that you stop being a pain
But you keep coming back and you're just the same again
