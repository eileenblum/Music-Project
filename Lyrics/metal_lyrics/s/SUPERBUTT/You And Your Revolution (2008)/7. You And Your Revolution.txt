[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

You got yourself a new haircut, brother
You take it the barricade
A brand new spirit and soul
A leather suitcase and a handgrenade
Why donât you take it to the barricade
Holy spirit and burning soul

You and your revolution
Bleeding hearts and the sweet smell of heresy
You and your revolution
Broken bars and chocolate flavoured ecstasy

You got yourself a new pair of shoes
You take it the barricade
A brand new spirit and soul
Burning wheel and a handgrenade
Why donât you take it to the barricade
Holy spirit and sacred soul

You and your revolution
Bleeding hearts and the sweet smell of heresy
You and your revolution
Broken bars and chocolate flavoured ecstasy
