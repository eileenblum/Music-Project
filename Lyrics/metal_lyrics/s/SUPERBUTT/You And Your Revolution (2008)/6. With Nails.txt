[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Hey, letâs say we learn a new word today
Hey, ainât it grand to play
To pretend that we mean it when we say unity
With lips full of love and charity

Hey, letâs say we blow a new wind today
Hey, ainât it grand to play
To pretend that we blow it and we bring clarity
With a mouth full of love and charity

But all we need is our own mysery
All that we are is a scream for therapy
Oh, cut deep suck the life out of me
With nails, with teeth, with charity

Hey, letâs say we give some false hope today
Hey, ainât it grand to play
To pretend that we give it and we show harmony
With a handful of love and charity

But all we need is our own mysery
All that we are is a scream for therapy
Oh, cut deep suck the life out of me
With nails, with teeth, with charity
