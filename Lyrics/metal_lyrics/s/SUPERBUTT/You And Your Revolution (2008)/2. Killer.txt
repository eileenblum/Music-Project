[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Oh, kick it, you gotta take another shot, killer
Oh, who knows, you might do better this time

Invoke your anger
Put her into play
Embrace the power
Then push it away

Oh, kick it, you gotta take another shot, killer
Oh, who knows, you might do better this time

I see your desperation sits here in the front row
You raised the flag high - now lay it low
I see your second thoughs, they sit here in the front row
You seized the day â now let it go

Oh, kick it, you gotta take another shot, killer
Oh, who knows, you might do better this time

Shout at your reasons
Ask them to stay
Embrace the fire
Then push her away

Oh, kick it, you gotta take another shot, killer
Oh, who knows, you might do better this time

I see your desperation sits here in the front row
You raised the flag high - now lay it low
I see your second thoughs, they sit here in the front row
You seized the day â now let go!
