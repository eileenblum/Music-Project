[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Now that I broke everything around me
I wonder if it brings me back alive
Fake a smile and cross the line, itâs easy
Fueled up to strive

Burns out fast and then it blisters
Get through to the end and read the sign
Here I am, the pleasureâs mine
Oh it fades out fast and then it wrinkles
Meet your end and read the sign
Here I am, the pleasureâs mine, argh

Read the sign
The pleasureâs mine

Now that youâve seen so much all about me
I wonder if youâre sharper than my knife
Fake a smile and cut the ties, itâs easy
All set for life

Burns out fast and then it blisters
Get through to the end and read the sign
Here I am, the pleasureâs mine
Oh it fades out fast and then it wrinkles
Meet your end and read the sign
Here I am, the pleasureâs mine, argh

Read the sign
The pleasureâs mine
