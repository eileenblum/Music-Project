[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Out to burn the city tonight, running after life, chasing better times
Out to blow this town up tonight, running after better times, chasing life
And turn this place around, running after life, chasing better times
Out to burn the city tonight, running after a free ride, chasing life

Chasing better times, life

Figure, figure it

Out to burn the city tonight, running after life, chasing better times
Out to blow this town up tonight, running after better times, chasing life

Given this trail to follow
We know thereâs no tomorrow
No thereâs no tomorrow
Figure, figure, figure, figure

Chasing better times, life

Figure, figure it

Out to burn the city tonight, running after life, chasing better times
Out to blow this town up tonight, running after better times, chasing life

Given this trail to follow
We know thereâs no tomorrow
No thereâs no tomorrow
Figure, figure, figure, figure

Down this road that we follow
No thereâs no tomorrow
On the shoulders of sorrow
Figure, figure, figure, figure, figure
