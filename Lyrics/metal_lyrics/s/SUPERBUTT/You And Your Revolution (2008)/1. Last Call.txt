[featuring Zak Tell of Clawfinger][Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

I push myself up against the wall
And I put my hands, where I can see them
Last call while itâs open for season
And up to my neck I stand there for you all

Let anyone roll, let anyone

Come have a bite, share a cup
And put your guts where I can see them
Last call while itâs open for season
I laugh at my wounds and I use them against you all

Let anyone roll, go on anyone

Iâd do anything to be you right now
And I know I could hurt myself so much more
Last call, Iâm bleeding everywhere
Last call, I take it
Iâd do anything to save myself right now
Cos I know Iâd be so much more
Last call, Iâm bleeding everywhere â ever Iâm taking that fall
