[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

Your spacecraft is calling it says that you are
Itâs calling your name and it says that you are
Bound to rise to show that you are
Chosen to be gone, gone far

Your stars are calling they say that you are
Theyâre calling your name and they say that you are
Bound to shine, to prove that you are
Chosen to be gone, gone too far

Chosen to be gone too far
Gone too far

So howâs that youâre still sitting here
Keepân yourself near
Why if itâs making you feel, feel so real
Feel, so fucking real
So howâs that youâre still sitting here
Chained by fear
