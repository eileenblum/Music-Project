[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

The pain goes away, but the scars remain
She said your head was a size of a freight train
She said itâs in your blood, so how about you cut a vein
How about you give it up, how about you come again?

You bounce back out, but the cracks remain
She said you hit it it with the speed of an aeroplane
She said itâs in your blood, so pick a blade and cut a vein
How about I keep it till you give it up and come again?

With a little more strength and a push â she said
Youâre still a drifter
Hang in there, wrpa your arms around
Like you could ever lift her
Does it read as a book of life or a
Sweat stained letter
Oh, well, what she said, she said you better
Get it together

How about you give it up, you give it up and come again
How about you give it up, cut a vein and come again
How about you give it up, you give it up and come again
So I can keep it till you give it up and come

With a little more strength and a push â she said
Youâre still a drifter
Hang in there, wrpa your arms around
Like you could ever lift her
Does it read as a book of life or a
Sweat stained letter
Oh, well, what she said, she said you better
Get it together
