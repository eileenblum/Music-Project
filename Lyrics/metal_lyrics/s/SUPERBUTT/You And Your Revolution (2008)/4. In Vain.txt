[Lyrics by A. VÃ¶rÃ¶s]

The sunâs sweating blood â weâre flying around the glow
Eyes looking far out â heavenâs there you know
Long for a better place â oh, weâre good to go
Being held in solitary

The stones are standing in the rain
Guarding forever till it all goes down the drain
Praise how we struggle in vain
Oh weâre beautiful

The stormâs pissing motherâs milk â a bitter taste to grow
Fingers pointing inwards â heavenâs there you know
Crave for a new start â howâd you stop the show
Being held in solitary

The stones are standing in the rain
Guarding forever till it all goes down the drain
Praise how we struggle in vain
Oh weâre beautiful
