[Lyrics - A. Alvarez]
[Music - O. Clorio &amp; J. Viterbo]

Intriguer mysteries horrifying the creed

[Pre-chorus 1]
Demanding an answer from the eternity
Sterling emotions raid the silence

Magic sights in lustful execrations
Creation of tomorrow or remembrance from yesterday?

[Pre-chorus 2]
Mazy mayhem slowly eternal
Loud cries for glory taking victory

[Pre-chorus 3]
Feeling power from the shadows
Absorbed from the graves
Reflection of subconscious
To find thy fated path

[Verse]
Thirteen planes of vital insanity
Oh almighty Yog-Sothoth

D.N.A. bleeds - crystallized thought
Traveling in cruel fear - crystallized flesh

D.N.A. bleeds - crystallized thought
Traveling in cruel fear - crystallized flesh

[Verse]
Thirteen planes of vital insanity
Oh almighty Yog-Sothoth

[Pre-chorus 1]
Demanding an answer from the eternity
Sterling emotions raid the silence

[Chorus]
Inside the labyrinth of illusion
Winedforth deadline
Beyond limit of confusion
Tranquility

[Chorus]
Inside the labyrinth of illusion
Winedforth deadline
Beyond limit of confusion
Tranquility

[Pre-chorus 2]
Mazy mayhem slowly eternal
Loud cries for glory taking victory

[Pre-chorus 3]
Feeling power from the shadows
Absorbed from the graves
Reflection of subconscious
To find thy fated path
