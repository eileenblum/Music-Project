[Lyrics - A, Alvarez]
[Music - J. Viterbo]

Underworld from outsides

Revelation of outer gods incarnant of rabid magic
Throughout all times overridden the prime abhorrence

[Verse 1]
As above, so below in the abyss
Pure evil breaks for!!, upon the dead!!

[Verse 2]
As above, so below in the abyss
Pure evil breaks for!!, mortal remains!!
Must be in..

Mayhemic winds between the heavens
Advice the presence utmost aboinable
They're the fires within the caverns
They're walking on terrible dimensions

[Chorus]
Legions from A B S U
Is the hour of the serpent

The least brightness has lost
Its immortal shade for twilight black earth

Crawling chaos from immortal space
Deathly great one, Azaghthot

Abyss legions reclaim their throne
Sepulchral sounds rejoice the doom
Undead fate causes a deathless coffin

Upon the earth we wish die, fallen souls through the gates
Lead us for ungodly maze

[Chorus]
Legions from A B S U
Is the hour of the serpent

Arise away with evil insanity
The wrath of the flames is emerging
Against a time, and the light
Will die without return

[Verse 3]
As above, so below in the abyss
The old ones are, the old ones were &amp; the old ones must be
"To rise &amp; devour the living..."
