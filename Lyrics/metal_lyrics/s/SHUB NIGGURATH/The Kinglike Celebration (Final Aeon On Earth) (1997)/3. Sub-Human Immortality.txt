[Lyrics - A. Alvarez]
[Music - J. Viterbo]

Throughout the existence my soul has ripped away
The empty empire to born in fire, to bolt out endlessly

[Pre-chorus]
I'll create so far an unmost chant!!

Faithful my future blasphemies and engenders a new realm
Far better massacring the holy fate far &amp; wide
Unking even now o ungodly divinity
Without redemption the holy meantime
has fallen in cryptic end
And the path between the worlds
Has inverted the eldest devoutness

[-Solo-]

[Chorus]
Weeping upon the earth and the lives
And the life below the lives
Are becoming the end to begining
Wherein all is naught

[Chorus]
Weeping upon the earth and the lives
And the life below the lives
Are becoming the end to begining
Wherein all is naught

It must summon to those evil spirits in haunted
Where the feeble gods are fogged out

[-Solo-]

This is the battle against degradation
All thought in depravity is reigning victorious

[-Solo-]

Left behind by main force
Netherworld chooses my course

[Pre-chorus]
I'll create so far an utmost chant!!

Total evil in my own world or under its
Without shadows that enlighten my eternal living

[Chorus]
Weeping upon the earth and the lives
And the life below the lives
Are becoming the end to begining
Wherein all is naught

Over &amp; inside my vital virtue
I'm the heaven of gods, I'm the hell of devil!!
