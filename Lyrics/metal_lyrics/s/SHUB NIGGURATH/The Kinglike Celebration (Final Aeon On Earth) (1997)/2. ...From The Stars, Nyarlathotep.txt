[Lyrics - A. Alvarez]
[Music - J. Viterbo]

By the zeal of the stars, thy will be done

Cryptically proud the omnipresence holds the secret

[Pre-chorus 1]
Grace for which scornfully the radiant light
Has been ceased to be converted in triumphal gloominess

Too late to deny the weak!! Jesux!!

[Pre-chorus 2]
Demigods wilt the solemn primal faith 'tilk never ever...
The goal is near like was doomed so first of worldly creation

With a will my being suddenly grasps demise!!

[Pre-chorus 1]
Grace for which scornfully the radiant light
Has been ceased to be converted in triumphal gloominess

Conqueror the unchaste gulf will arise
Troops of friends awating they are,
For the appeal of mistery
To achieve victory upon the earthly life
HAIL!! TO HELL AND BACK TO THY!!
O PRIME O PRIME ONES!!
O PRIME NIGHT OF CRY!!

[Chorus]
Dark seals from the stars
Virtula forces from the stars
Blackened shadows from the stars
Unusual whispers from the stars

[-Solo-]

First one cosmic leave me through
The tortuous ways of perdition

Shattering bells resound with disdain
And thirst for... NYARLATHOTEP

[Pre-chorus 2]
Demigods wilt the solemn primal faith 'tilk never ever...
The goal is near like was doomed so first of worldly creation
"In sinister kadath I've dreamt...
Thou wilt from within!!!"
