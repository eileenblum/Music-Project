[Lyrics - A. Alvarez]
[Music - J. Viterbo &amp; Oscar Clorio]

Supreme sidereal force of transcomic origin
Offensively wasting away nature limit of the mind
Breaking the fear &amp; sorrow for fleshly oldness
Thru martyrizer time promptly deserted &amp; forgotten

Imperial enjoyment

I have found the perfect road
Of my universe, in the heart of my spirit

[Verse 1 -solo-]
From the worlds of fant asy
Only one remains with eternal duality
From the worlds of true
Only one remains with eternal duality

Just the only true astral being
The only true/real astral being

[Verse 2 -solo-]
From the severe birth of death
Only one remains with eternal duality
From the sweet fall of time
Only one remains with eternal duality

Just the only one true astral being!!

Millenium is forming salow (it's time of the gods!!)
Triumphal cosmic domain (it's time of my god!!)

[Chorus]
Omen'll be completed for the earthly events
Obsessed by the power a whole race claims a change

[Chorus]
Omen'll be completed for the earthly events
Obsessed by the power a whole race claims a change

Severe punishment for the conscious of the mind
Horrible punishment for the hope of the soul

[Verse 3 -solo-]
From the perverse world of true
Only one remains with eternal duality
From the amazing reign of terror
Only one remains with infernal reality

Just the only true astral being
The only true/real astral being

Supreme sidereal force of transcomic origin
Offensively wasting away nature limit of the mind
Breaking the fear &amp; sorrow for fleshly oldness
Thru martyrizer time promptly deserted &amp; forgotten
