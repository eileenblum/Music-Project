[Lyrics - A tribute to an amazing version of NECROMOMICON / Music - J. Viterbo]

They are lying down the great old ones
The bolts are fallen, fastenings are placed
The crowds are quiet, people are quiet
Elder gods of the land, elder goddess of the land

Shamash ..sin .. Aded .. Ishtar

Have gone to sleep in heaven, they are not pronouncing judgements
They are not deciding decisions vailed is the night
The temple and the most holy places are quiet &amp; dark
The judge of truth, the father of the fatherless

SHAMASH

Has gone to this chamber
Oh ancient ones gods of the night

Azabua .. Iak Sakkak ..Kutulu ..
Ninnghizhidda

Oh bright one, G I B I L
Oh Warrior, I R R A

Seven stars of seven powers
Ever shining star of the north

Sirius ..Draconis ..Capriconis ..

Stand by the accept
This sacrifice I offer
(Must be) may it be acceptable
To the most ancient gods

Ia Mashmashti
Kakammu Selah!!
