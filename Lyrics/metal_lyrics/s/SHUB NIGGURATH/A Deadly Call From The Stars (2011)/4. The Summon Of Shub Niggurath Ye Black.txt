Mighty stones have been set up, Thou shalt call out to the great one and not he that knoweth the signs and uttereth the word all earthly pleasures shall be granted when the sun entereth the Sign of the Ram and the time of night is upon ye...

Turn thy face to the Northwind invincible evil power hears our calling, I summon you now!

Rise up I say from thy slumbers and come forth with a thousand more! Turn thy face to the Northwind and say this verse loud:

Iah! Shub-Niggurath! Great Black Goat of the woods, Great Old One... I call Thee forth!

Answer the cry of thy servant who knoweth the words of power, I make the sign, I speak the words that opened the door! Come forth I say, I turn the Key! Now, step upon the Earth once more!

Iah! Shub-Niggurath! Great Black Goat of the woods, Great Old One!

Cast the perfumes upon the coals, trace the sigil of Blaesu and pronounce the words of power:

ZARIATNATMIX, JANNA, ETITNAMUS, HAYRAS, FABELLERON, FUBENTRONTY, BRAZO, TABRASOL, NISA, VARF-SHUB-NIGGURATH!
