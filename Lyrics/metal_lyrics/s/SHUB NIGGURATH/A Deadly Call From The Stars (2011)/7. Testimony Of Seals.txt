In the time before time, before heaven and earth were put in their places, when the ancient ones were rulers of all that existed and did not exist, just a never-ending darkness... IA MASHMASHTI KAKAMMU SELAH IA MASHMASHTI KAKAMMU SELAH! Azabua Iak Sakkak Kutulu
Ninnghizhidda... No moons, no sun, no planets or stars, ancient ones were masters, no moons, no sun, no planets or stars, ancient ones were masters of spaces now unknown or forgotten and all was CHAOS! Be prepared to leave reality, shadows in a twilight sky, swallowed by universe, and deep with the death, they are laying down, the bolts are falling, the crowds are quiet, the elder gods of the land, have gone to lay down, they not pronounce judgements, not deciding decisions, the temple and holy places... In the time before time, before heaven and earth were put in their places, when the ancient ones were rulers of all that existed and did not exist, just a never-ending darkness... Sirius Draconis, MASHMASHTI KAKAMMU SELAH, Sirius Draconis, KAKAMMU SELAH
