Grace for which scornfully, has been ceased to convert in triumphal gloominess conqueror of the perfect road, of the universe, heart and spirit, race for the ones who offensively are wasting away nature limit of the mind, in triumphal gloominess conqueror of the perfect
road... Omen will be completed, TRIUMPHAL COSMIC DOMAIN... Omen will be sealed, TRIUMPHAL COSMIC DOMAIN. I born in fire to bolt out endlessly, breaking fear and sorrow for fleshly oldness, throughout the existence, My soul has ripped away... Grace for which scornfully
has been ceased to convert in triumphal gloominess conqueror of the perfect road
