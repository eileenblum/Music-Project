Oh spirit of the great planet! God of victory above the dark angels, lord of all the lands, son of Enki, master of magicians... Vanquisher of the ancient ones, the one who give the power to the stars

Lords of the worlds and spaces between, the first among the astral gods, in the name of the covenant sworn between thee and the race of men, from the gate of mighty Nergal, the sphere of the red planet, I call thee! Hearken and remember, I call thee! Hearken and remember, Marduk lord of fifty powers, open the gates to me! From the gates of the mighty Nergal, the sphere of the red planet, I call thee! Hearken and remember... gate of the great gods!

Gate of the god of the double-headed axe! Open the gates to me! Gate of the lord of the worlds! Gate of the conqueror of monsters of the sea! Gate of the golden city of Sagalla! Axxanngabannaxaxagannababillukuku!!
