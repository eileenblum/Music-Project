By the zeal of the stars, thy will be done
Cryptically proud, the omnipresence holds the secret

Grace from which scornfully the radiant light
Has been ceased to be converted in triumphal gloominess

Too late to deny the weak!!!

Demigods wilt the solemn primal faith âtil never ever
The goal is near like was doomed so first of worldly creation

With a will my being suddenly grasps demise!!!

Grace from which scornfully the radiant light
Has been ceased to be converted in triumphal gloominess

Conqueror of the unchaste gulf will arise
Troops of fiends, waiting they are
For the appeal of mystery
To achieve victory upon the earthly life

Hail to thy, oh prime ones!!!

First one cosmic leaves me through
The tortuous ways of perdition
Shattering bells resound with disdain
And thirst forâ¦ Nyarlathotep

Demigods wilt the solemn primal faith âtil never ever
The goal is near like was doomed so first of worldly creation

In sinister Kadath Iâve dreamt
Thou wilt from within!!!
