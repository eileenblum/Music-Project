Rising from the stars
An everlasting abomination
Vociferates a deathlike threat
In the deepest darkness so below

Eldritch contradiction
Thoughtful cosmic spawn
Summoned in Râlyeh
Controls thy dreams

Lying, the dormant awaits
Lying, the dormant prevails

Thrilling entity dimensionally plunging 
From world to world in a suspended animation

Descending in thou mind the spawn had awaked
To blaspheme &amp; lie through thyself with no mercy

Execrable dweller from immemorial ancient age
I can feel your realmâ¦ welcome to my dreams

Terrible desire has possessed thy curse
And turned thy fate upside towards âhimâ

The earth will shine
With the black light
As above to gather
His damned chosen ones

Eldritch contradiction
Thoughtful cosmic spawn
Summoned in Râlyeh
Controls thy dreams

Lying, the dormant awaits
Lying, Cthulhu reigns

Hail oh primordial one, show me the liberty, beyond eternity.
