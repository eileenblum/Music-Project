Decaying corpses come back from the grave
Hungry animals destroying thy fears
Twisted cannibals return from the dead
Lineage of sub-humans looking for revenge

Innocents falling for the zombieâs lust
Sanguinary wicked destroying thy race
Eating bodies, devouring souls
Morbidly enjoying the hellishness

For the unholy evil ones is only a pleasure
Where the holy rite of life
Is only masticated for the truth
This is a real chaos, but itâs the cruel end

To degenerate a rostrum without aspect
Contesting against the odious deceit 
To hallow the deadâs respect
Evoked forth Necronomicon

Hybrid race controlled from beyond
Reigning the hell on earth
Summons to engross a new dawn
Revulsion of necrobestiality

Decaying corpses come back from the grave
Hungry animals destroying thy fears
Twisted cannibals return from the dead
Lineage of sub-humans looking for revenge

Innocents falling for the zombieâs lust
Sanguinary wicked destroying thy race
Eating bodies, devouring souls
Morbidly enjoying the hellishness

For the unholy evil ones is only a pleasure
Where the holy rite of the life
Is only masticated for the truth
This is a real chaos, but itâs the cruel end.
