Human faults of unripe development
Feed and endow my sins with no limit

Iniquity, morbidity 
Depravity, satisfaction

Gladden my sojourn
Secular and degrading
I the present unprovided earth
Of the Arcanum freedom

But I own the malignant delights
To decipher the huge passions
Charmer! The sun shows fear
To witness and insurrection dispute
Revelation of perfection

Massacring the weakness
Worshipping the evilness

Hellishly the rebellion
Of virtue will commence
Vainly the despondent
Strength will survive

Hellishly the rebellion
Of virtue will commence
Vainly the despondent
Strength will survive

Blasphemy
Perversion (from within)
Involution (from within) 
Hail black earth!!!

Massacring the likeness
Worshipping the darkness!!!
