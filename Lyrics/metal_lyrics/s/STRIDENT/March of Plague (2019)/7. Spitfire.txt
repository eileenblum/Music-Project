This way we play the game, our aim destroying.
No hell will bring us down 'cause we enjoying.
We bring you down before you make an action.
You go to hell and wait for resurrection.

We bring them down,
We make them drown,
Let's start the fight,
We kill tonight
Spitfire.

Starting the battle with you, we fearing no death,
A shoot you miss and now you're out of breath,
You cry for death, we're pleased with this attraction,
Get slowly death and bring us satisfaction.
