Live one day, die another,
Pay your bills and go to jail,
You and me are like blood brothers,
We send blackmail to make a gain - of the world.

Thrash 'til death !

Back to life, kill each other,
Rule the world and suffocate,
Old school thrash, it makes us proud,
Kill on command, when we will shout - shout out loud.

We thrash you to death.
