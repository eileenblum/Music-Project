You bloody fool, scoptophobic,
It's time to meet yourself,
Yes, it's a scary thing, I will show you
Before you run away.

Now take my hand, hear me breathing,
See entire hell gets out of control,
Evil inside your head never sleeping,
Come on, take a sit, now you're at home.

It's time to talk you face to face,
Get over lies, stop to deface,
Eradicate me, take my place,
Eternal evil.
It's time to talk you face to face,
Get on your knees, cause you I chase,
Stop blaming me in your disgrace,
Primal evil.

No remorse to you, rotting human,
I'm dancing on your grave,
Stare at me again in the mirror,
Show me you are brave.
