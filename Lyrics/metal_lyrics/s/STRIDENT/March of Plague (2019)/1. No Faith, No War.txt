Personal choice, personal fear
Metal noise, war is near
Absolute dependence from society and belief system
Obedient and mindless nice material for priest scheme

No faith, no war
No faith, no war
Go and fuck you with your fucking faith
When you obey you will become a slave

Critical hit, you piece of meat
It seems you agree with pope's vile greed
Even after death pay for the place to bury corpse and soul
Without money, catch your fucking "bless" asshole

No faith, no war
No faith, no war
Don't be a brick without any name
Religious reign stands on dead bones and flame

Run and elude from dark holy gates
Still not too late, change doings that are made
Anarchy and chaos are the tools to do it right
Show to brainless sheep, your way through night

No faith, no war
No faith, no war
Go and fuck you with your fucking faith
When you pray, you will become a slave
Don't be a brick without any name
Religious throne made of dead bones and flame
