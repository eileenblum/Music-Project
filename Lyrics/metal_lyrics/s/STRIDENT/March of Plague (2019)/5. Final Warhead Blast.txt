Dark souls are rising from their graves,
Gathering our children in deep dark caves,
No use to hide, it's you they chase,
They smell the blood upon your face.

Ecstasy and lust,
Horror from the past,
Prophet's words written on the dust,
Wait for the final warhead blast.

Syria washed up by chemical rain,
U.N. has found the "dick" to blame,
Put humanity on a one way train,
To take a ride around the world again.

Evil ancient caste,
Wants you to burn fast,
Turn you into dust,
See the final warhead blast.

World covered in blood once again,
Enjoy raining blood, endless pain,
Is is too late, we took the train,
No one survives this bloody reign.
