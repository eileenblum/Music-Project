Flames of hell into your eyes,
Right and justice is your device,
You have passed through gates of hell,
Never born, never fell.

Live or die just know the reason you stand for it,
Take the chance, take your gun,
Sirens will remind us of your battle glory,
Rest in peace, you fallen one.

You shook the earth, you've made them cry,
No more fighting, for you only sky,
Full of hopes and full of pain,
Now it's your home and will remain.

Fought so hard, fought so well,
Or just eighteen alone in hell,
Don't be scared, life has gone,
You will never be alone.
