Lord, have mercy, on the streets of London,
We made mistakes and gonna die,
It came from far, and now dark curse is on me,
The world is dead, I'm asking why.

On the left beside you,
On the right beside me
March of plague
Came here to ruin you
March of plague
Wants you to die
March of plague,
Like hundreds of years before
March of plague
Funeral pile.

You die, I follow, set you dead forever,
Bring you death and send you hell,
Your life is mine, I eat you from your dishes,
Doors are locked, you start to yell.
