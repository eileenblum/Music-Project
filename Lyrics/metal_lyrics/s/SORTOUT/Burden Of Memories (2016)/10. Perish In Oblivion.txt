turn all the lights down
and let the beast grow
to destroy all we've ever had

the sunset's gone
on your cold throne
I am a drop in this deep dark sea

to fear you
I should know you
instead I wake up every night 
and fear the same

no compromise
I suffocate by the thought
you would never remember
the days pass by
I wonder why
this all feels like a dream

help me to forget everything
that cursed my life

as darkness grows
I clamp to pictures
of our golden times ago
and you should know me after all 
instead I perish in oblivion

don't give me nothing
for every word unsaid
to wash your guilt away
break off the scars
to feel the pain
you loved once now your life is gone

am I
still cursed 
can I get out of this darkness here

all hope is gone
the show is over
there 'll be no final hopeful call
the curtains fall
the lights are out
silence eats me alive
