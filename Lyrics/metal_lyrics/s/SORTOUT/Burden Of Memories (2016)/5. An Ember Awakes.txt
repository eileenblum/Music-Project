It makes no sense
to keep myself alive
an ember awakes
by killing fire

I am forever
I am an open scar
I've been forgotten
reborn in endless pain

We never see
all our possible ways
never see
blinded by me
I just gave up myself
I gave up myself

I burn
I'm burning deep inside
I hate being helpless

Forever
My ashes are here to remain
still blind
trying to find
this life
once again I will feel alive
suffering all alone

I'd be there for every soul
that burns with me
I'm too far away
I fall
