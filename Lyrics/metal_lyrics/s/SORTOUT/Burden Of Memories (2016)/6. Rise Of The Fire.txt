a perfect world
a perfect day
to live in this cage you call your life
a human aim
to be unseen
believing the voices of sorted men

borrowed decisions that ended in ruin
arrive in mystery
follow the pain
searching for answers
claws deep in my skin


was it worth it
to die for when everything
you have believed in
falls to dust
a sacrifice 
of reckless fate
through the hand of a liar

dying words
regret a mistake
so obvious to understand
I'm merciless
when weakness grows
a habit so easy to lead
the only way
to meet the truth
is walking on
when falling down

once again I speak
this was for the weak
