why?
why give up and try
try another way
crossroads stops our view
and all our faith is gone

they say I'll never pass this life
cause all our future dreams are lies

whenever the chance is there
grab your life to take the perfect way

tattoos of our hope
burnt inside our veins
no more chance to live
I'll save this life

decisions
no victim
awakened sounds of an ancient faith
decisions
no victim
endless ways
nothing to lose

a broken pride
anchor-less I ride
through a silent sea
there is no end in sight

I am a rock
in this storm
a silent scream
of hope

out of a fire I rise
through a storm I fall
into a new born world
I always carried inside

I am hope, I am faith
tears of the desperate
no pain anymore
no silent life at last
