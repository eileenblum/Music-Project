whisper in the silence
for all I've lost
can you hear me?
anyone?

The final words we say
turning the face
behind the truth
I'm hiding inside
the dreams that ain't my own
I swear 
I will
define my lines
and keep my will

I suffer inside 'til the day I'm gone
growing a nightmare created for you
through dust and bones I crawl to you
solutions are hidden in a deeper fate
betraying myself I have to stay

only you stop my pain
the things I said
going through my head
rather cry all alone
than share it with you

save me from this
I bury my secrets in graves
can you be mine?
the darkness is calling my name

turning my back to a truth I fear
smiling polite to a face so near
last chance, last way
I'll have to leave
no road to return

whenever I decide
whenever I decide
