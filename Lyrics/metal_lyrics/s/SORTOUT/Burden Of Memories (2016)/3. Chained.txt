broken and torn 
in shackles being held
the time has come to 
free myself from you

I'm done with being pushed
my actions will no longer
be unseen and 
I will
no longer be kept down

forces 
in my mind
confined by your commands

never feel too save
this will not be my end
I'll keep my head up
even if I'm chained 

there is no way
to calm the storm
history showed
every chain will break
I will remain
through dark and day
remember my name
remember
