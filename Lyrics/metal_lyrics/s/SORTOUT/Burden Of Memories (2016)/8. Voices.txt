a blast of my existence
keeping my head clean for pain
through all the days
and the nights I'm alone
finally I come home

destination
waste of patience
you are 
afraid of 
everything different than you

now I
I'm always alone
these voices shared my fear
from now
on always and ever
I keep my dreams inside

who am I now
will I ever find myself
right, wrong, now, then
don't tell me where to go

how can you say
this life is wrong for me
I will not fall
society will not break my life
and now the voices
break out
and cry 
to turn back in time
I can't deny
what's right or wrong
under my chest
celebrate
forget the rest
don't know why
I still try
to disappear with my social vest

now I
I'm always alone
these voices shared my fear
