liar
don't try to hide
this inner pain remains

in fact you have
to live with this
this silence will keep you awake

true colors
appear with agony
I'd give my final words for you
you'd never
do the same for me
now I'm helpless left behind

forgive me
I've been so blind
these are the words
I can't hear anymore
those were the days
you can't die for

forever you shall stay
in fire
you shouldn't dig a grave
with no return
my helping hand you can't
desire
may you live with
this fault eternally
