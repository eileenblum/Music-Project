now I
I wake up suffering in 
life-lies
created perfect for my 
low pride
for all the time I spent alone I
I'm a dying ember inside

forever agony
I have to beat my fear
into eternity
for all the pride I've left
left me alone to die
I have to kill what
is bleeding inside

on the edge of patience
outside my pain
I can see your face
full of lies
stop hiding me
to see what's left
stop hiding me

repressed emotions
hid too long
too deep inside
my sorrow
awakened
it has become too real

see who I never seem to be
never see who I need to be

you
borrowed
light in darkest nights
I buried
the lying pale shadows

no more
patience
break through this wall
into a world
a world painted black
created with dreams
I'll never forget
this is the sorrow I left
left for my sins, left for my stars
shining too bright
now I die
