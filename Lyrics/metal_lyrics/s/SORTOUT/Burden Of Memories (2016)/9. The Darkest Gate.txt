disdain words
dyes your liar tongue
the darkest gate's open
I have seen this vision
rewrote poems
a trip through bitter irony
you sold your soul
for a ride with the devil's slut

so far away
from my warning
believe me your dreams
are painted black

believe me I tried it
to show it so many times
it's hard to forget it
to watch it let you go
one moment in lifetime
but I had no idea
that sorrow will remain
because I let you go
forgive me now

And now I come home
home is a place
where my heart can stay
you show me how I never want to be
being myself was never enough
enough to return your broken soul

this is not the time
forgiveness must wait for me
cause I will never forget
my life, my love
dead and gone
I still breath the air that we've lost
why
