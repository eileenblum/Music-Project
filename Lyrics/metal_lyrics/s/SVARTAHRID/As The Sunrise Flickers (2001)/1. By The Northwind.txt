Haunted while sleeping.
Released from here and now by their ancestors.
Traditional ceremony once called archaic.
Found a true, deeper meaning.
New-born muses rise.....from Bolivian.

Eyes were open at last. 
Disguised by an athem.
Blown by the northwind.
A message was served them.
They were chosen to abandon.
Their present way of life.
Ordered to return.
Enter their "abinitioanimuses".
