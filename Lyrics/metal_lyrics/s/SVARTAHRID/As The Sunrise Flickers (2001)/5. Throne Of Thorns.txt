As the sunrise flickers and the angels fall.
I behold the rise of the northern star.
Draped in fire and ice, the resurrection.
Visions of a birth so long ago foreseen.

When the world crumbles and falls to dust.
In the ruins I will stand.

Let the icy light embrace you.
And the shining star guide you.
To my eternal kingdom of emptiness.
My beloved throne of thorns.

When the world crumbles and falls to dust.
In the ruins I will stand

Grant me your soul for one cold kiss.
Follow me, for I am the legion.
In fire I descend, for....

"I AM THE RESURRECTION"
