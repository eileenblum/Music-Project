In the north the mighty mountains 
reach relentlessly to the sky.
They have always been there, and will
always be while the time passes by.

Even when the world crumbles 
and falls to dust.
The north will stand proud and mighty
as the sign of Odin and glory.

We refuse to fall under the cross.
We'll fight to the last man has fallen.
Even then we will not give in.
We have chosen to live in eternal sin....

So let the Gods of our fathers in.
And guide you through the nets of lies.
So you may walk proudly in this world 
until the day of reckoning, when all men dies.
