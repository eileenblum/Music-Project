I am the son, the eternal one.
I walk the border, guards the faith behind the veil of time.
I am, and I will always be THERE.

In times of glory there came men...dressed in white.....
With no pride...
They talked about God and of sin.
And they slayed all who wouldn't believe. 
Their words of peace and forgiveness.
Forced upon them the God of emptiness.

Never to fall - Stand proud
Never to fall - Northern Gods

Now the time of change is here.
God have met the northern winter.

Now the time of change is here.
Rise from your graves o' lords.
