Peace of mind when light of day is whitening.
A solemn mist of melancholy rages.

An old man shadow-less he was.
With no need for a name. 
Beyond age he was.
Appeared in ominous omniscient.
His eyes were glimmering.
They revealed a pain.
A longing for an end.

The omniscient entering his sacristy.
In dark solemnity.
