Free as the wind i roam the mount ainside
Following the path of the chilling nortwind
We the brothers of the northern hammer
Are wielding our swords in eternal war

Raventhrone

Countless bodies lies scattered and torn
Death is granted to our hated friends
The fields of battle are drenched in blood
In the sky above the ravens cry

Raventhrone

Troughout times our legacy is handed
From father to son
So bow down to the northern spirit
And be the chosen one

Gather your brothers and call for war
That is what we're chosen for
Be the one to defy their god
Intruders of land, destroyers of faith
