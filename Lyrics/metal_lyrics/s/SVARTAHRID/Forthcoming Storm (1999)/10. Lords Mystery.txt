Into the abyss i see
The one embracing me
Lord, circle is complete
Light, will have it's defeat

Bless my eyes 
With all its beauty
My eyes are blind
To it's mystery

Dark shadows around me
Chills are all i feel
Shadows, it seems to be
The one is following me

Bless my eyes
With all it's beauty
All will be,
Dark when you die!!!
