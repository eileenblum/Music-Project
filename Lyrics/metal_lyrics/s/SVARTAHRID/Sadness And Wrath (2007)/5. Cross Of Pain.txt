In the night I have wandered
Upon the cross I've seen
I have seen the man there hanging
Hanging there for all my sins

Wish you could have been there with us
Seen what we all have seen
You would have taken that sculpture
Teared it limb from limb

I saw the man rise
We must bring him down
Into the night I will make you my own

With blood from crown of thorns
We gave up love for man
1000 souls of warriors he gathered
Ti win his final war!!!

Armageddon â the final war
Armageddon â god, meet the winter
