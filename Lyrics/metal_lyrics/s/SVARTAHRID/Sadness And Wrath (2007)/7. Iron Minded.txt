Beyond the bridge, between thoughts and terror

Morbidness descend into the abyss
Blackened pride you into glory ride

I have released them. I am master
Clarity gained by the sacrifice of sanity

The soul so cold, the thoughts so clear
A time of despair and confusion is over
I have seen my mountain. I have conquered. I am king

Reverence. I silently await the call for war

Iron minded
I have chosen the beauty of a blackened heart

Gathering shadows in the valley as the darkness rise

The sacrificial mountain of sanity
