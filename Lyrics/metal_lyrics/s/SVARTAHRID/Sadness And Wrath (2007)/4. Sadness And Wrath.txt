The sound of Odin's wisdom echoes through time
Guiding those who listen to the voice of the wind
With sadness and wrath he sees his word being tread on

His kingdom laid open for only a few
There was a time when his kingdom was held high
An army of Norsemen would die on his command

Now his beloved shores of Midgard
Is filled with weaklings and their white god of peace
Forgotten in his golden halls and philosophy of war
But he has his faith in those few men that still honours his name
