Pale figures, dancing decadence.
Ecstatic movement of pleasure.
All gathered at the coven...

In the night of the moon, shapeless figures
Dancing the dance of death,
More intensely now.
Stopped on signal that only they can hear

A fire is lit, nine witches appear
All with fire in their eyes.
Painted on body the marks of hell they bear.
Sabbath, summon the Crimson king.

Ancient rituals, unspoken wisdom
Hidden from those who cry.

Sabbath â summon the Crimson king
Sabbath â Dance macabre...
