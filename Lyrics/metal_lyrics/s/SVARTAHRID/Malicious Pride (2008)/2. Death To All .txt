Through the storm with one eye open
Stumbling on rocks in the path
The rain has my hate awoken
I feel nothing but wrath

The fire of the white one
Burns so bright
Disgusting light with no insight
Darkness embraces me,
Hide me out of site

Even in the heart of this storm,
I cannot escape the judgement of the one
Who is white as snow
Face my hate
I will shred you like paper
You are nothing compared to me

Purity is about to fall
Hear the enchanting call

Death to the weak
Death to the weak

Death to all!!!
