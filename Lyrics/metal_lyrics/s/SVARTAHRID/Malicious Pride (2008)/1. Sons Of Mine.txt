The one-eyed stands at the throne in the halls of a gold, proclaiming war upon man.

Time has come, long foretold...
Arise sons of mine

Sons of mine, tonight we will rise
Bring forth damnation and demise

Death and glory â sword and shield
Rage and hate â seek your destiny.
For you are sons of mine...

Victorious battle, forever glory.
Live in war eternally.
