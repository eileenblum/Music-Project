Dark clouds of freezing sorrow await their souls.

Forever two chains to a god, millenniums in blood.
All their life they blindly follow the step of others.

When their life cease to exist
Dark clouds of freezing sorrow.
When they finally realise
That the gates don't exist.

Hell awaits their souls.
Frightened by the threat of darkness
Threatened by beings possessed.

Freezing sorrow
