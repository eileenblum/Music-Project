A thousand candles lead the way through the mace of lice and deceit.
As I enter the kingdom of death I fall into the fire...

Fall from grace!

In the realm of hell, chaospawn.
Mighty sculptures ripped and torn.
I'm here for a thousand years
Waiting to be... Reborn!

Soaking up the ambiance of vengeance, violence
I'm hellbound. Revel in flesh.
Indulge in sin.
Death, disease, an eternity.

Blackwinged angels soars the sky.
Through the bloodstained mist
I see the path of fire.
