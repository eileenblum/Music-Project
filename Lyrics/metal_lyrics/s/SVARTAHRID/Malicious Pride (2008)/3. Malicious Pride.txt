A limping old warrior
Missing the swordwind
His sorrowful brows
Heavily bearing
The pain his pride felt
A longing for an end

Proudly met in battle
A bitter glow was growing
Tearing his warriorpride
While he was...
Fearless preparing
His hail to the ravengod
A glorious spear
Handed among kings
Placed to penetrate his longing heart

By the own white hands
In honour of Odin
The ravengod

At the field he was insurgent
Malicious pride...
Was his glow...
