Bliss, yeah bliss is found by those who wait
(as long as my hearts still beating, I am always, I could wait forever)
(as long as my hearts still beating, I could wait forever)
I find it hard to believe that this has found me now
A place where flowers won't grow unless you tell them so, grow

So grow
Because I told you so
I sold the memory of all I use to be
(We keep running from our own reflections)
I sold him for hope, I sold him for hope
(The hope of feeling a way I knew)
I found my way, reflections

(How can they stop us now)
How can they stop us now
This is unstoppable
It kind of makes you think
It kind of made me think
And then it made me think

Look at me
I'm faded, I'll shine again
Weary rose find the strength to pretend
I lost my best friend
And as the years have passed
It's getting harder to remember the person I use to be
Look at me
I'm faded, I'll shine again
Weary rose find the strength to pretend
I lost my best friend
And as the years have passed
It's getting harder to remember the person I use to be
Look at me
I'm faded, I'll shine again
Weary rose find the strength to pretend
I lost my best friend
And as the years have passed
It's getting harder to remember
Harder to remember

Don't look back, don't look back, don't look fucking back, yeah
(Don't look back)
Don't look back, don't look back, don't look fucking back
(Don't look back, go your own way)
Note to self: motherfucker, you're in the deep end
This is unstoppable
Weary rose find the strength to pretend
Find the strength to pretend
You're in the deep end

This is me in a bubble
This is unstoppable
'Cause I am blessed
'Cause I am blessed motherfucker
You can't stop us
'Cause I'm relentless
But if I let down my defences
Then I could be just like you
If this is me in a bubble
Then I am blessed
