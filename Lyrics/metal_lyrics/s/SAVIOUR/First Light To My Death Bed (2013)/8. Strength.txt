I am strong
I will live forever
But not like this
Forfeit the plan we had in mind
I'm on the road to be a better man

A thought to salvage
Just down the street

(These places keep getting older)
(Keep getting older)
But we ain't getting younger
(They keep getting older)
(These places keep getting older)
(Keep getting older)
(They keep getting older)
With these hands
I carved our paths
I prayed for mercy
I am strong

I'm gonna live
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna live
I'm gonna live forever
Forever

Cause we could sink like quick sand
(Or fly like fire flies)

Down this path
Are worlds where love can rest and prosper
There fucking better be
Tell your friends
I never meant for it to be like this
Please trust me now
Please trust me now
Please trust me
Please trust me now

(Please tell your friends it was never meant to be like this)
Cause I bled
I bled, I bled
Cause I bled for you
I fuckin bled for you
(Never meant to be like this, it was never meant to be)
Cause I bled
I bled
Cause I bled for you
Cause I bled for
So don't you dare say you don't care
Say you don't care
Don't you dare say you don't care
Say you don't care
(Never meant to be like this)
Don't you dare say you don't care
Say you don't care
So don't you dare say you don't
Cause I did this for you
I did this for us
Cause in this life
You only get one chance
You only get once chance
This is my last chance

This is for my friends
This is for my family
This is for my friends
This is for my family
This is who I am
And I will always be the same
This is for my friends
This is for my family
Yeah
