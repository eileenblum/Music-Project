Erase me
Erase the night you stay out late
And I wait, and I wait

Another night I wish was over
Another night on the frontline
And it's keeping me awake
And I can barely sleep
Don't remind me that the things you do are not make belief
'Cause I can barely sleep
Leave me in the mist

For in my head
This does not exist
This does not exist
This does not exist

See I'm a stupid fuck
She's a slut
Unconditionally in love
Like we don't give a fuck
But people always talk
You know I had the craziest dream
We broke the mould and felt better
Maybe we should change
Maybe we should change

(We broke the mould and felt better)
But then she said

You can't tell me what to be
What to do
What to see
What to choose
What to fear
What to lose
Or who to fuck
Or how to feel
'Cause this is my life I'll do what I want to do
You think you're fucking through?
Well we're fucking through
Yeah we're fucking through
Yeah we're fucking done
The door is open so run
Go have fun
Go have fun
This life is yours so do what you wanna do
So do what you wanna do
Go

Just the thought of us living our own lives
(My mercenary)
Just the thought of us living our own lives
(My mercenary)

(We've always stayed right by each other)
(Right by each other)
(Right by you)
We've always stayed right by each other
Don't give up

(Erase me from the world you dream of)
Don't forget the good times
We couldn't capture in a photograph
(Erase me from the world you dream of)
Don't forget the good times
We couldn't capture in a photograph
