I found you dear right here
Your hair was black
Your dress was blue
Your skin was cold

So can anybody build a time machine?
Or rewind time seventeen months
Just seventeen months
To before I met you

I would have never said hello
I would have let you go
I would have let you go

I would have never said hello
I would have let you go
I would have let you go

'Cause you deserve so much better than this

(Just breath in)
(Breath in now)
(Breath out, calm down)
(Just breath in)
(It's not your fault)
(It's not your fault)

Just breath in, yeah
Just breath in, yeah

I would have never said hello
I would have let you go
I would have let you go
(It's not your fault)
I would have never said hello
I would have let you go
I would have let you go
(It's not your fault)

Now the only thing left on my mind is that
I hope I chose the right flowers
(It's not your fault)
I hope I chose the right flowers
(It's not your fault)
I hope I chose the right flowers
(It's not your fault)
I hope I chose the right flowers
I hope I chose the right flowers
