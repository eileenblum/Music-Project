One day we'll laugh
At the people we once were
At the people we once were
Yeah we'll laugh
At the foolish thoughts we had when we were just children
Wake the fuck up

Oh, I felt the walls fall down
I found her fragile arms in pieces
Deep down you know the joy you feel is mortal
Deep down you know the joy you feel is mortal
She said
Fuck you
Fuck this
Fuck everything you've ever said
You just don't get it
You just, don't get it

There is nothing but a bitter taste here
I thought about all the things that I fear
I scratched the walls in search of some salvation
She said the monsters were parts of my creation
She said the world could not go on without you
The world goes on without you
You stupid fucking cunt

(It goes on)
It goes on
(With or without you)
It goes on and on and on
(It goes on)
It goes on
(With or without you)
It goes on

It goes on, like my stupid stories
It goes on, like your appetite
It goes on, like my stupid stories
It goes on, like your appetite

If there is nothing left here
Then why the fuck should I stay?
If there is nothing left here
Then why the fuck should I stay?
If there is nothing left here
Then why the fuck should I stay?
If there is nothing left here
Then why the fuck should I stay?
Then why the fuck should I stay?

(We all waste our lives in our own ways)
(We left it all in our sweet escape)
(I think it's too late to say you don't want to)
(I hope you feel me)

Before you leave this place
I just want you to know
I had the best time
So here's to moving forward
Or moving on
I just wanna thank you
For the best time
It's been nice to meet you
Yeah
Just wanna thank you
For the last time
It's been nice to meet you

(We all waste our lives in our own ways)
(We left it all in our sweet escape)
(I think it's too late to say you don't want to)
(I hope you feel me)
(We all waste our lives in our own ways)
(We left it all in our sweet escape)
(I think it's too late to say you don't want to)
(I hope you feel me)
