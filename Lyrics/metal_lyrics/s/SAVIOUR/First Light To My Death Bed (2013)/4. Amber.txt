Yesterday was so much, was so much brighter
I'm sure this will all be over soon
Don't forget that I am right here beside you, always
And just remember in case the world turns its back on you
You were never alone

Just remember
In case the world turns its back on you
You were never alone
You were never alone
Bring it

'Cause I am right here beside you
'Cause I am right here beside you
Beside you

We never left each other's side

We never left each other's side
We fucking talked for hours
Yeah

We never left each other's side
We fucking talked for hours
We gave our all

We never left each other's side
We fucking talked for hours
We stayed awake like owls
We gave our all
We never left each other's side
We fucking talked for hours
We stayed awake like owls
We gave our all

We never left each other's side
We fucking talked for hours
We stayed awake like owls
We gave our all
We never left each other's side
