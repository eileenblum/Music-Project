I've been waiting my whole life
To turn my days off repeat
To feel alive
To feel my heartbeat
I've been waiting my whole life
Just to feel the sun shine on my skin
And I know I don't deserve it's presence
But today I didn't burst into flames
I found a brand new life
I found a reason to wake up
I feel so undead
I'm so undead
Because of you
(I can feel your heartbeat)

(The way) The way
(You stared) I stared
(The words that were spoken)
(I'm already too broken)
(I'm already too broken)
And will try my best
I know I can fix you
I know I can fix you
I know it's true
(And the way) The way
(You cared) I cared
(The words that were spoken)
I know I can fix you
I've been waiting my whole life

I feel the sun shine on my skin
I feel undead
And I know I don't deserve it's presence
But today I didn't burst into flames
I found a brand new life
I found a reason to wake up
I feel undead
I feel so undead because of you
