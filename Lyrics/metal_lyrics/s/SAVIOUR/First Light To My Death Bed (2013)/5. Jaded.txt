We don't have to feel so jaded
We don't have to feel so
Bleak in my safest place
When morning comes I'll feel so cold
If morning comes I'll leave the light on

Illuminate my heart
The hardest part is feeling so damn close to the ground
And I'll admit that I'm afraid

So there you fucking go
Now you know
I'm afraid to let you go
Or let it show

So there you fucking go
Now you know
I'm afraid so let's keep running and running and running
Running and running, run

We don't have to feel so jaded now
I never meant to hurt you but as our summer fades
I see you slipping right through my fingers like sand
I'm afraid to face this alone

Or are we flawed forever?
I'll take the blame for your mistakes
Or are we flawed forever?
I'm afraid to face this alone

When I think about the good times
It takes me back to the day we first met
I never will let you go
We set our world on fire
So I'll be the spark to the fire
I'll set our world on fire

So burn like day one
We drenched our hearts in gasoline
And the view was serene
Like it mattered

Bleak in my safest place
When morning comes I'll stay the fuck in bed until it burns out

Because it burnt like my world was on fire
Like a bitch
Like a kid with a lighter
Like Joan of arc
Like a bomb
Like a mother fucking H-bomb
Like a firework
Like the falling sun
Like a gun

Chick-click-boom

Take me back to the day we first met
Cause I don't feel like waking up today
I am shaking
I am careless
I am jaded and alone
I am careless
I am here

I'm burning the leaves
Straight through the shadows
Planting the seeds
All on my own
I used to know you
I used to know you
