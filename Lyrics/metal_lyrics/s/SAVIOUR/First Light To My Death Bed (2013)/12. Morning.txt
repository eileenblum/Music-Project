I still pray
Six times a day
Just to reach you
And I don't even believe in God
But I still pray, pray, pray
And I hope you're trying to reach me to

Today I broke the window on our bedroom ceiling
Now I can feel the raindrops on my skin
The rain drops on my skin

I broke the window on our bedroom ceiling
Now I can feel the raindrops on my skin
Rain drops on my skin
It pours and I can't take it

If there's a place I could leave it all behind
I would have left it all there
It pours and I can't take it
I would have left it all there

We live with the mistakes we make
We wear them on our sleeves
For all to see
We live

We live with the mistakes we make

So still I pray
Six times a day
Just to hear you
And I don't even believe in God
But I still pray
And I don't know if you can hear me
But I'll just go on and say it
I'll just pretend you do
I'll just pretend you do

You were light by day
By night my shooting star
My chance to make a right
Shining bright like a good thought
Like the one to call your own
You were the backdrop
On my telephone
You're my sweet dreams at night
You were my precious memories those times
Infect my body like a time bomb
You were my cure to everything
You were my everything
You were my hope
My girl
My world
