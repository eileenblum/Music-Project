What if I said
That everybody's dead
And the voices in your head
Are just voices in your head
What if I said
That maybe we went wrong
And the times that we spent
Were wasted all along

What if I said
That everybody's dead
And the voices in your head
Are just voices in your head
What if I said
That maybe we went wrong
And the times that we spent
Were wasted all along

(I hear the whispers, I hear the whispers)
Maybe we went wrong
(I hear the whispers, I hear the whispers)
We went wrong
I hope that we melt as one, melt as one
Unified and pieced back together
So here's to wishful thinking

Maybe we were wrong
Maybe they're right
Maybe we were lost all along
Maybe we were wrong
Maybe we should move on
Maybe we should move on

I hate the world and every fucking body

What do you do or say
When everything has fallen to pieces?
To motherfucking pieces?
Please tell me
'Cause I'll try anything
To fucking free my mind

Dear God
Where the fuck are you now?
Where the fuck are you now?
When everything lays in pieces, yeah
Where the fuck are you now?
('Cause I'll try anything just to free my mind)
Where the fuck are you now?
('Cause I'll try anything, I'll try hard)
Where the fuck are you now?

What if I said
That everybody's dead
And the voices in your head
Are just voices in your head
What if I said
That maybe we went wrong
And the times that we spent
Were wasted all along

Fuck
Dear God
Where the fuck are you now?
Just where the fuck are you now?
When everything lays in pieces
All we have is each other
