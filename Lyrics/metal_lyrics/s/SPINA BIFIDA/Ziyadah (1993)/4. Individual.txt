I'll see the eyes, that looked in mine
Always hiding the truth from me
The spirit of the individual

Screaming with my mouth shut
Pretending nothing has happened
Cause there's no-one left to blame
Cruel images, clouding my vision
Am I what I planned to do
The haunt for contonent and mutual concessions
Or am I what I am competent of

Does life seem worth while to you
Looking for the dream that keeps coming back
The images of our desting oblivion
It should help me help myself
But my tortured brain tells me
I've reacked for the answers to soon

So don't follow me I'm lost too
The world expects a pose
I love a thousand yet none
One by one, alone in silence, we stand
In line
Screaming without making a sound
