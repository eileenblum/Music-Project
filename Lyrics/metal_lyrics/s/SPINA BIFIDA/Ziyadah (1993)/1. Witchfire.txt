There they go the last two hundred
The fire is waiting
Silent eyes, watch them
The flames of power knew no hatred

But still they dance
Around the witchfire
Around &amp; around, without fear
But fire comes ruining the truth

Love is the master of hate
The drums of death
Are soon to follow
They gave their blood for life

Burned, chased for holy reasons
Saving his people from evil

Where are the silent ones
Where are the traitors
Who told them lies
They saw the golden light
