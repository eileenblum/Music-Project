The human race existed
With the certain supposition
That his death as an individual
His mortal appearance
Was submitted to
The immortality
Of man as a specie
This changed with the opening

Of Pandora's Box
In Worldwar II
The validity of
The belief was withdrawn
We now live in borrowed time
The damaging of the opponent
Was restricted
Now ransom can be demanded

For earth's atmosphere
The most obvious clue
Of man's pathology
Is the opposition of
His unique
Technological mind
And his inability
To solve social problems
