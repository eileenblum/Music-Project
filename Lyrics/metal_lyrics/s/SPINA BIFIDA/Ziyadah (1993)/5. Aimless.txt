We'll never break the chain
Of cirkles from beginnings and ends
Who is wondering why
Scared by visions of chaos
Visions of the future and the past

Behind their eyes, you can see the hope
What you'll see is sickened or dead
Why ask why
An answer, brings a dozen other questions

Who is wondering why
Theories as weak as life
The truth known only as a mythe
Fact and fiction strangled together
Existence is the perfect victim of reality

Fantasising there's a connection
A connection between heaven, earth and hell
A wanted explanation of naÃ¯ve minds
Because there is no law for that
Why wonder why

Stuck with our conscious border
A body to body conversation
Of our innerselves
Humanity has no language for that

The Knowledge we'll never possess
Just another target to achieve
The spoken mind and reasons why
Are never obvious, a troubled portrait
