Manslaughter, frenzied action, lost desires
Thus sentenced, time's slowed down since you're here
Fugitive existence, made way for apathetic waiting
Thoughts cross your mind, adrenaline excreted

Death's collecting, your time is gone now you're on
Dementing scare rips the hope, useless anyway
Indigestion, bile is all you taste
Heart pounding, perspiring body, muscles trembling

Lights slithering along you, when you pass the hallway
The room approaching, life's still strong but doubtful soon
Arms are clasped, tighting straps, poison prepared
Immunity is a joke, or would you prefer some volts

The needle penetrating, unleashing evil in your blood
Scorching it's way to your brain
Muscles, contracting, spinning eyeball
Afflicting your body, 'till last convulsion has gone
