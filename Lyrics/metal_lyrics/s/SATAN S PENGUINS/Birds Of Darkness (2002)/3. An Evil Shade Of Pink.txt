In a cold naked cell
A lunatic stares at the empty walls
With a blank expression on his face
But with a smile on his rugged lips

His mind travels beyond this world
To a place created by his funny brain
There are trees in different values
In all the colors of the rainbow

Just like a stoned junkies dream
Where the grass is blue and the sky is green
With yellow elephants flying in the sky
Like when you smokepot and get really high
So many colorshat you almost go blind
All this created by a lunatics bizzare mind

Transformed to an image made of dreams
The lunatic ruins naked through the wilderness
With strange flowers springing in his footsteps
Followed by an evil shade of pink
Knowing not that it is his last day in life
