Out of the ashes
Of the destroying (smurf) village
One survivor rose
That day he swore not to rest
Until Gargamel was dead

While walking through the woods
A shadow emerged from behind the trees
Together they returned to the ruins of the village

The village was desolated
Smashed to pieces and burned down
The limbs of the poor smurfs
Scattered all over the ground
But their flesh was still warm

Together they decided to perform
The ancient smurf ritual of necromancy
In order to invoke the fallen ones
To create the army of undead smurfs

Under the sign of the blue mark
They marched towards Gargamels castle
The old sorcerer did not know
What horrible evil would strike upon him

He was paralyzed by the horrifying sight
When he saw the hideous army
Bursting out from the midnight fog
Crawling and trembling towards his home
He tried to escape, but they ate his toes
(took a bite of his ass, played golf with his balls)
And feasted upon the rest of his dismembered body

When it was down, they marched on
To spread terror all over the world
The superior race of rotten flesh
Blue and white with blood on their hats
