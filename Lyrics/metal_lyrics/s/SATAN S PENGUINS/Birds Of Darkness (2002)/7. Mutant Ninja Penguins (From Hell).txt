Trained by the ultimate masters
Possessing all the skills
Nuclear radiation from hell
Turned them into savage beasts

Beaks of the sharpest steel
Chainsaw blades instead of wings
Fear their tremendous rage

In the night they are running amok
Staining their steel with blood
Using the ancient arts
And melting humans with nuclear farts

There is no point praying to god
Because he is already dead
Buried deep in penguin shit
Slowly turning to dust
