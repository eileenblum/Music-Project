Sunset in Gotham city
The sky is red as blood
A dark gloom reigns the town
As if it knows what awaits

Late at night
A horde of creatures sneaks into town
Armed with razorsharp beaks
Certain that no one will get in their way

Sensing death in the air
Nobody even dares to go out
Soon the penguins will find Batman's cave
Proceeding with their cunning plan

After emptying the batmobiles tyres
They sneak back into the woods
Leaving no trace to be found
But a stench of death and decay
