Penguins
Arise
The day
has come

We will fly with the storm
And attack with the lightning
To extinct the human race
Before they extinct everything else

Sweeping across the countries
Destroying all we see
They don't deserve the gift of life
Make room for the new race

After desolating the face of the earth
We will layour eggs in the still warm ashes
And the fuzzy baby penguins
Will have human corpses for their first meal
