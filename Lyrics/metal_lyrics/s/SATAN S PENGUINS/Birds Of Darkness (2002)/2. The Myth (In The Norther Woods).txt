According to the legends
There is a creature
Hiding in the northern woods
His heart is cold as winter
And his hair is made of leaves

Where his name is mentioned
A cold wind bends the trees
For he's the one that fills our souls with fear
For he is Skogsmulle!

He lures children into the woods
And makes them become his disciples
There they are taught to live only on death cap
And to throw stones
On the people
Walking in the forest

In the northern woods
He is one with his surroundings
Every tree his castle walls
Every stone his throne

Where his name is mentioned
A cold wind bends the trees
For he's the one that fills our souls with fear
