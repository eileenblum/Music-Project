Broken dreams broken home nowhere to go 
Shattered life left without a reason why 
Void inside no one there to hear your cries 
Alone and cold no one there for you to hold... for you to hold 
Forgotten one the time has come 
To take control join with those forgotten too 
In this place a sense of worth is finally gained 
Take my hand together we'll forget the past 
Take the stand together we can change our lives... change our lives 
Forgotten one the time has come 
You... me... us 
The time has come to take control
