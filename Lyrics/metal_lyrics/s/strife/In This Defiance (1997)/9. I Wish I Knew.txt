Still hanging on the words from your lips 
Still trembling at my fingertips 
The end came sooner than expected 
It came without warning without mercy 
Believe in me you said... you said 
Trust in me you pled... you pled 
It's all misled 
Why did I believe 
How could I not see 
I wish I knew... so where do I go from here? 
Where do I belong? 
If not amongst you then with who? 
With who? 
I wish I knew... 
I wish I knew... 
I wish I knew... 
I wish I knew... 
With who
