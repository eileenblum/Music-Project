Resistance in a time of mass self-destruction 
Makes the few who walk the straight edge 
A growing force of change 
Committed through gripped by the plague of a nation 
Consumed by intoxication and confined by a crippling greed 
In...my...rage 
I walk the path of true change 
Commitment sworn in the name 
Of those who still walk the straight edge 
Convictions held to my grave
