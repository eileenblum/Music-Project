Because I stand in this defiance I wear the mark of those 
Who choose to refuse self-destructive points of view 
And with each day spent in self-perseverance 
My voice is strong against what's wrong forcing it to end 
Forcing it to end 
Standing in this defiance and wearing the mark of those 
We chose to refuse our system's defective views 
And with each day spent in our self-perseverance 
Our voices strong against what's wrong 
We're forcing it to end 
We're forcing it to an end
