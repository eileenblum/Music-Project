Emptiness again 
Left alone again 
Left to question all that's happened 
No one cares 
No one tries 
All that's left is the will to die 
Try... 
Try to hold on to what's left inside 
Empty (and this emptiness I'm left with) 
Searching (has me reaching for a reason) 
Lonely (this loneliness consuming)
Reaching (I'm searching for the answers) 
Will you do the same? 
Try... 
Try to find peace
