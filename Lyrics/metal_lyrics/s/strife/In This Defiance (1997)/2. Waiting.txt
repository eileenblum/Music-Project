Reach back and release the power held in each 
The tools of knowledge we have received 
Our youth removed stripped of verity 
But a voice is crying out and we'll take it back... 
We'll take it back 
Take back our hopes our dreams 
All within the reach of those who believe in what can be 
In faith I wait 
I'll do what it takes 
My voice is still crying out 
And we'll take it back... 
We'll take it back... 
Waiting... 
Waiting 
I'll fucking hope 
I'll fucking dream 
I'll fucking believe 
But I'm still...waiting 
Waiting 
I'll see the ascension of this disease 
Am I alone in my dream 
I'm still waiting 
Waiting 
Waiting 
I will wait
