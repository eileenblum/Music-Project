The fight for what's right does not lie in closed minds 
Search inside and you will find the answers lie within the reach of those who try...
to live their lives 
Free from hate 
It's time to break... chains that bind 
Hate confines 
Stand as one 
Standing strong 
Make the choice and make it clear 
A voice of one I've got to hear 
We've got to try... to live our lives 
Free from hate 
It's time to break... these chains.... stand as one 
Standing strong 
Standing strong 
Stand as one
