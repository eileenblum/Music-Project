Overthrow... attacks on one's own will only to defeat the whole 
The true fight lies against the ignorance of the outside world 
We cannot succumb to the conflicts of this inter-segregation 
The creation of something pure has been infected by a prejudice 
This movement can only survive with the committed support of all... 
Overthrow 
Overcome 
Rise above 
Rise as one... 
Restricted the advancement of this voice is stifled by itself 
When those who hold it in their grasp have become the enemy... 
I... cannot stand alone 
We must not accept this trend 
With hands held high and fist clenched tight to put an end to this infest 
End this dissension...
