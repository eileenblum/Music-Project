The future is dead for many of those who have fallen refusing to let it go 
Addiction we're victim of affliction 
We're choking these walls are caving in 
We keep pushing 
This world is bleeding 
Is this our destiny? 
We've built and constructed a false progression 
Is this our destiny? 
It's not just the fire pumping through our veins 
It's not just the cancer we inhale 
It's not just the poison we keep drinking... it's everyone 
It's you and me 
We keep pushing 
This world is bleeding 
Is this our destiny? 
We've built and constructed a false progression 
Is this our destiny? 
It's not just the actions of our hate 
It's not just the division we create 
It's not just the one sex, color or creed... it's everyone 
It's you and me 
Is this our destiny?
