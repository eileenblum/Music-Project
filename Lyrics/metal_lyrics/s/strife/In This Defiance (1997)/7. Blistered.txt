Blistered by a raging sun's flames 
Mankind sealed its fate in its haste 
Warning signs sent time after time 
We just sit back in all this waste 
All this waste 
And I will not wait 
I'll climb from this place 
I'll climb to the truth 
To the truth 
Blackened skies poisoned ashes cried 
Mankind sealed its fate in it's haste 
Warning signs sent time after time 
We just sit back ignore the waste 
All the waste 
An I cannot wait 
I'll climb from this place 
I'll climb to the truth 
To the truth 
To the truth 
Looking to the skies I can see the ashes falling 
Looking to the shy I can see it all coming down 
I can never give up 
I can never give up my fights right 
I can never give out 
I can never give out because mine is right 
My fight is truth 
My fight is truth
