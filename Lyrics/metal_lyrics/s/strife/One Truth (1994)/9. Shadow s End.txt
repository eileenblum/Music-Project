The shadow is taking over by acceptance...
The shadow is taking over.
The movement pulled below.
Stifled cries are thrown aside
but I am searching for hope once more.
Stagnation's end- rebirth, insurgence...
Confide in fear, locked inside here, alone but never lost.
Solitude is mine.
The answers to the questions that kills this will.
That boil in our blood...
The fate is never sealed.
