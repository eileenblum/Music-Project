Another day gone by with nothing said.
Another wish wasted, another thought dead.
Crying to myself am I the only one.
Trying within myself but what's done is done.
I once thought I knew a little bit, but now I know more about nothing...
Am I the only one?
Trying, trying not to lose what is gone.
Trying not to lose what is held dear- what is dear...
Trying, trying not to lose what is now gone.
Trying to avoid what I fear- what I fear...
Move a little closer, move a little further away from me.
Strip away what is held dear.
Move a little closer, move a little further away from me my friend.
Put me in this place you know I fear...
Am I the only one... YES.
