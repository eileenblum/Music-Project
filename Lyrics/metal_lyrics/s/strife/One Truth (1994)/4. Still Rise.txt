Stepping ground lost, fallen through the sands of time.
The security one know has been stripped back and exposed.
Strong hands which before expressed support have now faded from my sight.
Strong hands scorn my eyes to darken the light...
It just slips away... It burns in my heart...
I thought I knew what I was looling for.
I thought I knew what I would find.
I thought I knew what would become of me.
It feels like I knew nothing.
I figured out what went wrong.
It feels like I took too long... too long...
It burns in my heart
