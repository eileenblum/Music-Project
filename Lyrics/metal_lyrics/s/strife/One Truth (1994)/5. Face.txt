Imperfection seems to have gotten the best of me.
I beat myself down in this frustration.
In unreal aspiration- never allowing progression to begin- sights set so far ahead.
Missing the start I fall once more.
I must try one step at a time.
Facing this path alone, I will begin again.
I will begin again.
Obstacles come from within!
Sometimes so strong you must wait.
Take the time to catch your breath.
Face the path alone and begin again...Begin again.
Never let yourself go astray!
Making a change will take some time.
But you've got the time, you've got the time.
Face the path alone- Begin again!
Face what is there- what is there.
I must realize what is there, face, confront and never give in.
I must try one day at a time.
Facing the path alone, I won't let it win.
