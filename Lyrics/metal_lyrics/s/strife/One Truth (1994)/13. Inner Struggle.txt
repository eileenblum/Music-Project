You condemn me for this life I chose,
just look at yourself and all those afflicted by your views.
You continue to act as if so pure,
when you just add to the problem excluding the real cure- the real cure...
I don't need it anymore.
You try and act but really ignore.
The true battle lies inside my friend,
and you'll change nothing until the inner struggle end- inner struggle.
Now you attack me with your shots,
that's alright I've got more than what you've got.
You'll change nothing until that shit stops.
I said you'll change nothing until the inner struggle is fought
until it's fought...I won't succomb.
I'll keep myself above the hate, set myself apart.
