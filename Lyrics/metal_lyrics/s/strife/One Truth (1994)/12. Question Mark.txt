I lie in this bed of comfort so wide and so vast.
My fears and anxieties lead me to wonder, how long will it last...
Just ignore the problem, why don't we even care?
Never have felt the pain of poverty,
never have dealt with this reality.
Never given thanks or appreciation.
Never realized the wealth of my position... Never...
Question mark- Question mark in my head.
