What will remain of those days when it all meant something to you, the kid, and me.
It was more than just something, yes, but it's changed.
What will remain of those things that used to be?
Some say they're gone in me.
And I will remain to see those days again...
Like before when to me, it felt like something more.
It didn't die it's just been ignored,
what will remain of those days?
People change, time is rearranged,
lives and goals do not remain the same, nothing stays the same...
What will remain... I will remain
