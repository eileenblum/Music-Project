Sometimes I feel like I can't break away,
and I can ever get free from these chains...
It burns me up, it tears me up inside- inside...
My soul is forced to the ground, can the source ever be found...
Can I get free...
Struggling to calm the fire, with everyday it rises higher.
Face to face with my own hate, will it destroy me as it saves?
Calm the fire- can I calm this fire...
Now... Get Free!
