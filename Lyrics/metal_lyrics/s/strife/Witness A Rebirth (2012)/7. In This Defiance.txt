[feat. Marc Rizzo][Music / lyricsâAndrew Kline]

Why live if you have nothing
Nothing worth dying for
Why fight if you have nothing
Nothing worth fighting for

Defiant
Are we fighting a war we can't win?
Defiant
It's a war we can win

And in my mind I know what's right
And in my heart I know what's right

A voice for the voiceless
Together we'll cry out
Strength for those weakened
And those plagued by doubt

Defiant

And I'll fight
Fight for what's right
