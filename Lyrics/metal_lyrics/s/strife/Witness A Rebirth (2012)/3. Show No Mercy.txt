[Music / lyrics â Andrew Kline]

Itâs hard to survive
In this world of pain
Itâs hard to survive
In this world of hate
Sent here to die
But I won't close my eyes
Sent here to die
I won't go without a fight

And I
Will show no mercy

Show no mercy
Show no mercy

My spirit will not be destroyed
My will cannot be broken
Rise up for the innocent
And fightâfight for those betrayed

We must rise up
This worldâs against us

My spirit will not be destroyed
My will cannot be broken
Rise up for the innocent
And fight for those betrayed

We must rise up
And show no mercy

And I
Will show no mercy
