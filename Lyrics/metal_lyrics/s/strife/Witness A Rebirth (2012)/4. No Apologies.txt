[Music Todd Turnham / lyrics Andrew Kline]

Who can I trust?
When you all turn your back
When I let my guard down
When my heart is crushedâagain

For the path I chooseâno apologies
For this life I liveâno apologies

We all make mistakes
No regrets for the judged
The sinners become our saints
The past is undone
When I'm alone
With my thoughts
You can find me
Unashamed

Judge me
You won't bring me down

Judge me
You can't bring me down
