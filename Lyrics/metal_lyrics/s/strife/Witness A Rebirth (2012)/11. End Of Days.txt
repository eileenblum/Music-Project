[MusicâAndrew Kline / lyricsâRick Rodney]

I need no book
Preached by religious fools
To see the signs sent time and time again

They are all around
In the blood of children
We've drawn the line

It is time!

The war
The greed
The hate

End of days

In the blood of children
We've drawn the line
Force fed the doctrine
Now blinded
It is time
