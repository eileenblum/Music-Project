[feat. Scott Vogel][MusicâAndrew Kline / lyricsâScott Vogel]

Hating your own life
Pathetic fallacy
Afraid of true freedom
Lost in the machine

Keep your eyes off of me

What do you have now?
A life you can't believe
I live by my own rules
I have everything I need

Keep your eyes off of me

I'm nothing like you
I'm free
