[Music / lyrics â Andrew Kline]

Witness a rebirth
The new breed
Resurgence
The efforts we made are not lost

The blood, the honor, the truth
What it meant to me and you

Carry the torch
Bleed the new blood
Carry the torch
Breathe new breath

The young blood
Gives new hope
The heart will
Stay beating
Tradition will be carried on

The blood, the sweat, the tears
What it meant

Carry the torch
Bleed new blood
Carry the torch
Breathe new breath

If you believeâI still believe

Carry the torch
Bleed new blood
Breathe new breath
This world is yours
