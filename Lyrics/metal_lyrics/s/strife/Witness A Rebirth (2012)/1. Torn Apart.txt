[Music / lyrics â Andrew Kline]

Our fight - did it mean something?
I stood and watched it all fall apart but did nothing!

And I still have hope - I won't let you tear this
And I still believe - I won't let you tear this apart!

Take back what we believe in
Before this place self destructs we must rebuild!

And I still have hope - I won't let you tear this
And I still believe - I won't let you tear this apart!

A closed fist or an open mind
Time to break these chains that bind
Take back whatâs yours and mine
Stand together - free from hate

For what it means - I won't let you tear this apart
Through all Iâve seen - I won't let you tear this apart
To you, my friend - I won't let you tear this apart
Until the end - I won't let you tear this apart
