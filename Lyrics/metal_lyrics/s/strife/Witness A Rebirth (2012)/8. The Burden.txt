[MusicâAndrew Kline / lyricsâRick Rodney]

Where has it gone?
This love I felt so strong
That kept me moving on
That made me who I am
But also broke my heart
I've spent such precious time
Rewindingâreplaying
With all those thoughts still racing in my mind

The questions keep coming
But I can't find the answers
The burden unyielding
I can't find any peace

Where has it gone?
The fight I once knew
The belief I once shared
That held this weakened frame
The hands of a chosen few

I can't look back
I won't look back
The past is laid to rest
Step by step prepared again
I take this burden on

The questions keep coming
But I can't find the answers

The burden
Unyielding
I can't find any peace
