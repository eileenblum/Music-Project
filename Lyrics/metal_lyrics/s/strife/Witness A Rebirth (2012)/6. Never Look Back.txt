[feat. Billy Graziadei][Music / lyricsâAndrew Kline]

Never look back
Always move forward
My whole life
I never looked back
I alwaysâalways moved forward

They say that times have changed
I moved on but I haven't moved away
Won't forget all I've seen
And what made me who I am today

I can't escape my past
It's what made me who I am
My whole life, I never looked back
Because the memories won't last

The memories won't last

Life won't changed
But people do
Accept the fact that no one
Is who you thought you knew
Life won't wait
We can't be stuck in the past
We must move forward
Because the memories they won't last

Never look back
