[Music / lyricsâAndrew Kline]

It's so sad to see
All of our bonds start to fade
I point the finger at you
I know you're not to blame
And it makes me sick
To see how fast we turn our backs
So quick to judge
And now so much time has passed

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
This world has got the best of me
And I prayâ
And I pray
I pray that I can break free
There's a time
There's a place
I can't be blind to this
So Iâkeep holding on

In the back of my mind
I know it's not the end
We move forward in life
But I will always call you, my friends
And our differences
Are what make a friendship last
Let's break down these walls
It's timeâto forget the past

I will keep holding on
