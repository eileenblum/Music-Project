[Music / lyricsâAndrew Kline]

Under a pale grey sky I walk alone
I see the world come crashing down
Plagued by thoughts, fear, delusions
I cry for help but no one's around

Who can I trust?
Where can I turn?
Help meâlift this weight that's crushing me

Trapped in a fog
Drowning in pain
Can't see past the darkness surrounding me

Life or deathâthe choice is mine
When pain and hate are all I find
I can't let it stop me

Searching for hope I try to see through this confusion
The world's weight is too much for me
I gave my all
Expected nothing
Blinded by fear inside of me
Alone in my life
I need a sign
When thoughts of death run through my mind
Been lostâbeen down
Can't give up but I'm running out of time

I will survive
