[Music / lyricsâAndrew Kline]

Knocked down from a higher ground
But you can rise again
Look past what was lost and learn
Learn from your mistakes

Face your failures

Forced downâget back up
Refuse to be defeated
Confront the pastâclean the slate
And learnâlearn from your mistakes

Face your failures

When times are hard
When all is lost
Don't lose hope
Face your failures
To rise againâagain!
