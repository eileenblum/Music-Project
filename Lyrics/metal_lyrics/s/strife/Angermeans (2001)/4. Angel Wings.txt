Angel wings carry me
Show me the things I can't see
Why am I here at all
Angels sing
Comfort me
Help to end this suffering
Why am I here at all
In this place
I remain heavy with regret
Hear me screaming
My voice is giving out
Something has been lost
Can it ever be found
Is it in my head
Is it in my heart
This descent into emptiness
Is tearing me apart
Hear me screaming
My voice is giving out
Can't run
Can't hide from what it's about
Escape will take much more than I have got
But I will break these binding chains
I will overcome
Hear me
