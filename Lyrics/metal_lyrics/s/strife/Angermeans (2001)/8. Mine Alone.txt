No need
Theres no use
The past is gone
Can't look back
Forgive
Condemn
the choices made are mine alone
I won't back down from this
Can't turn back now
The future holds new found light
Strong enough for this fight
My hands are still reaching out
Taking hold of my own
I won't back down from this
Can't turn back now
And I keep telling myself
Next time around it's never going the same way that it was
this is something I cannot change
now that I am left all alone
