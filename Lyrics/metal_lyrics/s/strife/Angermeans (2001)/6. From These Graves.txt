How long can this go on
The tragic loss of life by the hands of our own questions
Keep coming
The answers seem so far
and now I'm loosing my faith
Can't you see the end is near
I try to keep some kind of hope
That someday we shall overcome this self destructive way of life
Can we be freed from the hate
It lies within our reach to rise from these graves weve laid
To create another way
We must somehow
The time has come right now before losing whats left
Were in the final days
I try to keep some kind of hope
That one day we shall overcome this self-destructive way of life
can we be free from all the hate
or do we choose to remain in these graves weve laid
Can't you see the end is near
