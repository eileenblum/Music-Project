Once more I find myself in this place
Can't find a way to get release
this grip I'm in is holding tight
No matter how I fight it gains more strength
With everyday
theres got to be some kind of peace from this constant state I'm in
Where has all the beauty gone
I can't keep holding on
Someone please won't you tell me
It willbe okay and someday it will finally change
Warm sunshine can take away the rain
All my life Ive waited for a key to unlock
The door that keeps me from so much more
There's got to be some kind of peace from this constant state I'm in
Where has all the beauty gone
I can't keep holding on
Someone please won't you tell me
and here it comes all over again
I can feel it calling me again
Theres nothing to loose
when it all seems lost
Theres nothing to gain when everythings stripped away
A simple plan to turn it around has now become the hardest thing I face
And here it comes all over again
I can feel it calling me again
Could the questions asked get answered real fast
I'm losing this fight my friend
