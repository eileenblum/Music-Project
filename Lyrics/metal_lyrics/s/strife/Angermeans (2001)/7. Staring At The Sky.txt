She's lying on her back
Staring at the sky
Over and over in her head she's asking herself why
Release me
Free me
Can't find out the reasons why
Can't find the will to try
everything seems so different now
The world is changing shape
everything seems so different now
The world is turning black
Why did it come to this
and where did it go wrong
can't find out the reasons why
it took so long
Release me
Free me
Can't find out the reasons why
Can't find the will to try
Release me
Free me
So everything can fade away
Can't take another day
I don't want to live this way
