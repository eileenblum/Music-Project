This world screams for release
War torn
New battles born
Day after day
Numbers rise
Life staine red
Close your eyes
Close your mind to the truth
Cut yourself from the outside
Ignore the signs
numbers rise
Life stained red
Climbing from the wreckage comes the new world order
Machines killing everything
Hand of fates
Disorder
Disorder
Stained red
Shut your eyes
Close your eyes
