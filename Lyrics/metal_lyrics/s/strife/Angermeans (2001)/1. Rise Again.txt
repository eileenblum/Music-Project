Broken and left for dead
I had to change my path
refuse to ever give in
I will not be defeated
I will rise form this place
Gainging strength
Rise from this pain
Rise to the truth
Acknowledge rebuild
closer to you
broken and left for dead
I had to change my path and I refuse to ever give in
I will not be defeated
I will rise from this place
Gaining strength
Rise from the pain
To the truth
Acknowledge
Rebuild
Closer to you
Closer to you
Rise from the pain
Rise again
