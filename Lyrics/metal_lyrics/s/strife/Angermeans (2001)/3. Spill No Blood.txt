Severed wrists can spill no blood
No regrets for the judged
Walk alone
Stand alone
I stand for more
Though I'm unsure
Never follow what you see
Believe in what can be
I am alone
I stand for more
Though I'm unsure
Never follow what you see
Believe in what could only hope
Left the voices
Leave the body scorned
Marked for life
Whether wrong or right
I can't be free
