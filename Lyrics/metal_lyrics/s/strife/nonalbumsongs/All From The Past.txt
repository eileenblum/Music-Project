So many thoughts in my mind,
I sometimes wonder are they worth the time.
But on these feelings should I dwell?
Because everyday I build my shell.
And I watch these lives.
I can't help help what I feel inside.
To me it seems so wrong to be so blind
but the life is theirs not mine.
Does this mean I shouldn't care?
Just shut my eyes, act unaware.
These people I feel so strongly towards
are pulled away because of my words.
But we'll spread the message and make it clear.
We'll spread the message for everyone to hear.
So come with us and let's all join hands.
To make hatred, prejudice, and drugs all from the past
