Unforeseen this realm gives way to me
A demon unlatched from it's keep
Why do they stalk me in the shadows of my fate
Hail the darkened shrine
Circumvented womb of cessation
Forsake the light
Inhale pestilence

I dissipate from the realm of luminescent demiurge
To a chamber of blackened light and tainted oxygen
Filling my lungs with the stench of death
Misery fails to outweigh my fear

Blackness personified
The plight emerges and invites me in
Lapse of control, a shallow breath in litany
Claustrophobic, the walls seem to be closing in
Inhaling pestilence

The library devours all who attest the divinity of it's ancient design
Inhale the pestilence, forsake the light

Silenced has forever been the light of day
Defy your desire and kneel to me
Find solace in the darkness, within the scars healing
For only demise will restore the feeling of life

Obsessive, possessive
Follow me and you'll find I'm entitled as fuck
And I'll take what is mine
If you've got what I want
Then get ready to fall
Because I'll leave you with nothing
I'm taking it all

Shroud of confusion surrounds me
Should I kill myself or everyone around me
Will I ever find the answer to my question?
Will I ever recognize my own reflection

I'm a walking contradiction made in flesh
A mere discrepancy
Blurring lines where the lies and the truths meet
Paranoid and fixated on my own death
No matter how much that I chase it still eludes me

Petrified and surrounded by demise
Immeasurable power even in infancy
Shall we be undone in the darkness
Such devastation corrupts my mind

The plight emerges and invites me in
Lapse of control, a shallow breath in litany
Claustrophobic, the walls seem to be closing in
Inhaling pestilence

Silenced has forever been the light of day
Defy your desire and kneel to me
Find solace in the darkness, within the scars healing
For only demise will restore the feeling of life

Hail the darkened shrine
Forsake the light
Let the pestilence consume you

Circumvented womb of cessation
A multitude of wraiths embodied
Shrouding the monolith

The spire ripe with condemned containment
Nevertheless the guarded crusade attained
Harnessing the power within
The doomed immortalized

Harnessing the power within
Inhale the pestilence
Forsake the light
