[feat. Alex Shikolai]A vessel within it's molding binds the path of life and death
Consumed relentlessly in vigorous sodomy
It's influence is infinite and so it's will 
Complete 

The gathering of all all
Assembled in flesh and in blood
He commands them
I dwell within his hollow mind
As he feeds on my memories
An orgasmic release

Like a flock of birds in the night
Succumbed to the stench of a corpse
I can taste the end
I'd hoped he'd never leave me
The warmth of rotting meat
Exfoliates my pores
Becoming one with his skin

I can't remember my name or my face
Engorging on the masses, and I fucking love the taste
I've never craved of mutilation in my wildest dreams
But I just can't escape the elation of their dying screams

I've felt memories slip from my grasp into the void
Internal condemnation, I feel it bleeding
Taunting the essence of my existence
Replaced are the memories of me
I've lost sight of it all

It's infamy scars the bones underneath my coat of flesh
The pain is seething, it dwells beneath this tourniquet
I'd hoped he'd never leave me
The warmth of rotting meat
Exfoliates my pores
Becoming one with his skin

I writhe in pleasure as the buzzards circle
The experience of hell, death and misery
In unimaginable pain screaming and gasping for air
Inside a tomb of the dead

Staring at the mirrored image paralyzed
Horrified at the shell of the man I have become

The gathering of all [2x]

Wisdom so unnatural, volumes it speaks
Encapsulated in his arms
To never be released

A mire of sorrow blankets the ring
Washing the purity from the face of sentience
Containment reeking of prosperity as it consumes hope and fear
Replaced I am
I've lost sight of it all
