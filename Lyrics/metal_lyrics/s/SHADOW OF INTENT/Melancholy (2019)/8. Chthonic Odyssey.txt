Deceiver in a darkened disguise
A familiar exterior unhallowed inside
As the figure dissipates from the gateway
Ignis fatuus
Calling from the abyss
Seek out my voice
Do not be afraid
Take my hand
I will show you the way
Revival of noumenon to this diadem
Essentia, with vigor I quell
Ascending the unascendable
For the bonds on my spirit have disenthralled
Life finds its way into the void until the veil is shut again
Breaking down all that we know until the veil is shut again
Where the darkness yields the plentiful
I shall prevail and will emerge as legend
The wretched possessor begins to show its true intentions
This is not the salvation that I seek
I long to be buried in the ground
Sinking deeper down
Yet I remain damned
The dreaded mystic abyss
The facade forever expands in this derelict dominion
In perpetuum I dwell
The harvest of innocence
To be ingested
The gaping mouth of judgement and creation absorbs
The dreaded mystic abyss
This is no longer the calm before the storm
In sheer denial of the situation, not responding
Pulse is quickened from the pain, I feel the blisters forming
The conflagration rising, panic stricken, fire storming
The malefactor makes its presence known, she lingers watching
The veil has been shut again
