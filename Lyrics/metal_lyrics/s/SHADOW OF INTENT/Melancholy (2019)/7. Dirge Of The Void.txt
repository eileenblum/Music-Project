Here I am on the other side
Surrounded by voices of those who have died
The sounds of their cries engulfing me
But a calling illusion cuts through them all
A goddess of shimmering light demands my faith
To the temptress I must oblige
It bores within
You cannot refuse her persuasion
She gives you the end to a broken heart that no one can mend
Agony seeps in, and I try to mend it
I canât take back the things Iâve done, this is my repentance
The time for reprisal has passed
Seduced by a cancer forever to last
She will consume whats left of you
The torment never ends
Sheâs in my ears
Sheâs in my mouth
Sheâs in my mind
Dirge Of The Void
Goddess of shimmering light
To the temptress, I must oblige
Sheâs in my ears
Sheâs in my mouth
Sheâs in my mind
