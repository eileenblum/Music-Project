What purpose have I, on this damnable path?
Captured in a nebulous gaze, longing to feel the sun once more
Total demise beneath its looming presence
What purpose have I, on this damnable path?
The unsealed abysmal creation ascends from below
Its thunderous march reverberates through the bones of the accursed
I took my life so that I could know rest
To die with the sins that were left unprofessed
A husk for the gods to molest
Oh, exiled lord of the unblessed
The darkest of idols, of power so divine
The damned, the ceasers of its thriving appetite
The doom of their dejected conscious imminent
Gulping gallons of blood, crushing their bones within its teeth
Incessant doxologization of trapped souls
Pie jesu domine, dona eis requiem
Before the process of disintegration, a sacrificial slaughtering of masses lining for decapitation
Single file at the behest of their demise
Embracing nocturnal damnation
Observer of perdition
As we near the subsequent torment unknown that awaits
Total demise beneath its looming presence
To the monarch umbra I am bound
To live as waste
To die as a slave
A fate most deserving, their debts shall be paid
Living as waste
Dying as slaves
A fate most deserving, their debts shall be paid
