The magnum opus of gods disdained
Like ants they burn under watchful eyes
I decide who lives or dies
Oh, how divine
Extinction of the human swine
In advancement to the final light
Demented sickness bred upon the earthly parasites
Their ashen anatomy scuds the blood soaked plains of eden
Admonition had been expressed but no longer obeyed
In the midst of the reckoning, they cower before the night
Nyctaphobic incantations swell within their hides
The astral intent of an irenic paradigm
Diminished of existence, a future so sublime
And so the bidding proceeds
The bidding proceeds
The unfurling torturous visions show, display, a calamitous mirror of pandemonium
The last of the suffering are failing to grip the rusting handles of control
Compelled by a higher power they sever each others heads
The perfect progression of mankind
A barren and breathless macrocosm
To the earth I give a clean slate, and I curse humanity in their cadaverous repugnancy
God-born, dead and left impaled, mangled posed in cruciform
Adorned with sores they sought to rid themselves of this karmic plague
Submit, lie in the grave you willfully dug yourself
No remorse for the creatures of the earth
At once you gathered to witness the wrath ever instilled upon the last of human greed
No remorse for the careless creatures of the earth
No remorse for the creatures of the earth
No remorse
