I awake troubled by what my eyes perceive
Is this heaven, or is this where the frail lay to rest what was left of their souls?
Where depravity sinks down the ever-growing hole?
Anguish in mockery, denied by creator
A fortune worse than damnation in hell
Dark surrounding me, black is all I see
This wonât contain me
Is this just a dream?
I canât feel a thing
This dark surrounding
Oh, I had sought for so long this delightful sensation of passage
For I did not know what lay beyond
Will I be released?
Marveled, enthralled within a tenebrous realm captivating desperate departures
Mortal become immortal
Your lust for the gospel had delivered your soul to torment
Yet my cries had been heard through the pain I had wrought
I dance towards the light for I have found what I sought
Piercing his words through my mortal shell
At last I have learned that this cannot be hell
Our worship was false
For he is the destroyer
You know him as god
As he creates, so he destroys
