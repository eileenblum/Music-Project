Deep inside the madness designed, you rot
Hear this foretelling of crepuscule doom most feral
The desolation of a human, an incarnate disgrace
Obliterate proceeds their fatal function; disease
Devastation is the antidote
Chanting for the anathema of grand dolor
Dishonoring fathers through shedding of blood
Environ the influence rising through all
Into the mouth of the maelstrom
Foretelling of crepuscule doom most feral
Environ the influence rising through all
All is lost
Falling into oblivion
It shall envelope all
Engulfed by fire and cast to the flame
Pure melancholy
They begin collapsing downward through the obscure godless chasm, plummeting an infinite depth inside the mind
Deep inside the madness designed looking outward awaiting their death
Behold!
Knowledge of life and power
That was not what they found
They did not choose to survive
A reason couldnât be found
It took their lives
