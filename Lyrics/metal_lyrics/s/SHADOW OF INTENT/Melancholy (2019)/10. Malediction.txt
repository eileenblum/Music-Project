I emerge alive
Regurgitated as a slave to the tests of time
I reject and do not rejoice my immortality
For there is nothing left of this place
Spawning unto desolation again
In shadows I slumber until I am but dust
Am I to live in nothingness?
In death I live to dwell the days away in fathomless dismay
Am I to roam forever gone?
To roam forever gone?
Festering memories of the past start to project
Then wither away inducing insanity on my behalf
We were led to believe the netherworld is of myth
But it dwells within and its nature so abstract, yet so very real
A most horrid fate
Ghastly rotting grave
Bloodshed and malice conjured the source of our decay
We wasted away
I am he who lives thrice begotten in bedlam against evanescent horizons
How melancholy
Time withers
The sun extinguished
And yet still, I remain
The age of man passes
My progress, struggles, and suffering a waste
