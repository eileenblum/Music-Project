The ether realm declares the world but a stage
A coldly calculated transformation to the grave
Onward we follow, herded as slaves
Collectively lapsing to the land of flame
Alas, the truth has been presented before my eyes
Iâve been unbound from the shackles of faith
No longer led to believe there is hope beyond this world, the rope starts to sway
The voices died one by one as they called my name
Wept until the body can no longer feel the pain
And naught a thing to blame
Trapped in a shell of excessive disdain
Under the moonlight I yield, for I am not enslaved, but one of many of those who kneel
The reasons, the answers, will follow me to the grave
Under the moonlight I yield
Venture beyond and prepare the final phase
Now I look beyond the black eclipse, the macrocosm of the divine
The sullen moon pulls at my soul, a beckoning for relinquishment
Like the tides under lunar influence, the urge is relentless
I venture beyond
The veil beyond cries my name
I have left behind all that I love, and all who commit
My soul in the hands of destiny
Briefly embracing the chill of Dimethyltryptamine
A struggle for many is the end of the few
A cancer that no mortal man can elude
I hang in my sorrow with no dispute, just know Iâm sorry
I swear to you
