Hail the night, and reject the sun
The raging fire blazing all mankind undone
I declare you the soon to be departed
Unspeakable atrocities shall come to light
You are all servants to ideals and stigmata
A curse most grim, the sirenâs hymn
Deliverance is a fairytale shared by all
Liberation, rebel, rise!
An ancient madness leaves their restless souls lingering
Urging to drink the fleshy chalice of vindication evolving throughout time
Vindictive, I am deific in origin
For I dwell beyond the walls of man
Amalgamation of chimera and permanence
I hold the power of all that is
By laws of nature, I am the fifth fundamental force
By laws of flesh never to be spawned
By loss of love, of cancer spewing forth
By loss of life, the climax of this decrepit world
