Four years after my return to the Ecumene, an arrangement was made between the two of me
That night, the fateful reunion would carve my beliefs with bloody daggers 
Arisen in the past, you all have the sudden lack of interest in which way they should be cast
How to explain my actions to the blinded peers among me? 
The universe is doomed don't you see? 
My perceptions are distorted from the rising madness 
The peaceful one is a war within itself 
Mendicant Bias' arrival set the trail ablaze
Work with me and we shall sip from the chalice of victory 

Eclipse the skies with white 
Cowering in the light
We'll give them one last fight
So suffers the youth of the age

I stare in anger as I enter my origin 
A separate path taken as my imprint awakens with my wife standing in his arms
Gazing, eyes fixated on me, profound betrayal by the one who swore to stand by my side 

Visions inside of my head drag my greatness to the depths of the dead 
The monstrosity consumes me 
Sweet and terrible like a madman's lullaby 

Seemingly unexplainable lack of knowledge plagues my peers 
Forcefully pried open eyes gaze unto the mantle's approach 
Igniting the soul of the galaxy's casket shall drain each world of their lives and replace them with mine

In desolation, I stare towards the precursor structure 
The thieving bastard from the shadows creeps up by my side 
The poor copy of myself has diverged from any source of wisdom 
Our mindset separated 

Visions inside of my head
Sinking into the depths of the dead

Before I secure my minions I must take your life, tear off your mask and crush your skull right where you fucking lie
Consume your body and your soul to keep forever as mine 
I'm terrified please help me; my mind is controlled by the Gravemind

The parasite encroaches on our last safe compound to infiltrate and annihilate the Lifeshaper and both the Didacts 
I fled the scene and took to orbit through the hail of falling lifeforms 
I shall halt your plot even if it leads me to death 

To prevent self-sustainment, plasmic molecules enforce containment

Iâve come to rid them all of life for a single purpose: Prometheans
I engage the gathering of human souls
Bathe in the light of the composer 
Feel my wrath 

She followed me back to my sanctuary 
The betrayal at last has come
From behind she grasps my life in her hands 
Into the Cryptum I shall go
