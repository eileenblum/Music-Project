I am the great thinker, the infallible speaker of our decimation, the prophet of Armageddon
The defilement of mankind's innocence is like all othersâ before it withers
Many before you have drowned in the abyss of ignorance and lies

Walking through ash and fire towards a casket of the transformed, my skin is peeling, my eyesight fading

My body has contorted before the monument of our sins
Our bodies will be brought forth to behold the great icon of angels holding scabbards to our throats

I tremble not, nor plead mercy from such punishable guilt, for I will gladly take my reward in the realm of brimstone and silt
This deed shall not be undone
Our armor will be crafted from your tissue

My body has contorted, but still I tremble not, nor plead mercy from such a punishable guilt, for I will gladly take my reward in the realm of brimstone and silt

The Didact has faced legions of the most evil of masses and discovered the secret of humanity for himself

In the end everything dies
There's no escape, no matter how hard you try
The beauty of death
Essence transcending flesh escaping entombment, released in its last breath
Organic convergence
The human form reshaped to resemble my image
They are reborn
A creature born into bondage

Infesting my delighted mind is the lullaby of mankind's own demise
Our plague leaves you scarred 
Oh, the horror for what we have done! 
Embrace the screaming ambiance of the wretched choir
We have murdered your fathers, and their blood blankets our attire

The ones we trust encircle us
Led by Faber he snatches me for himself, then jettisons me away
