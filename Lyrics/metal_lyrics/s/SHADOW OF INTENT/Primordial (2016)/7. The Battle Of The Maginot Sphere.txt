The Battle Of The Maginot, an atrocity of lesser madness to the events foreboding, 
Gather beyond the bridges of the stars and valiantly charge onward to intercept the beasts of Hell that dragged their fucking numbers here to push their way through in a blood red smear 

Necessary action taken to the Flood across the baseline, crippled as we're coming forth with annihilation preparations 
Blinding light erupts from the fleet of the cataclysm 
Decimation, extirpation, immolation
Hanging by a thread inside the only means for our survival, anxiety stabbing through my spine like a sewing needle
The pressure squeezes down to my bones 
Blood boiling at the obliteration of those trampling our masses as they're consumed under our final march, this is the battle of the Maginot Sphere 

Vermin, your corpse will be a display of my disaffection as its skin is stripped and the flesh is stretched
Your children died by my hands, and you soon shall too
Singing victory everlasting 

I spot the vile bastard at the center of his fleet
I plead; I beg, I scream aloud wishing for a fight on my feet, for I would flense the olive creature of all of his flesh 
The very bodies of my own would be free from his mesh 

Desire fills my mind with overwhelming vengeance with him to blame
My soul is now a void, my heart a freezing vacuum 
Trembling not in fear, I seek a means to an end 

Listen to the silence 
Ten million years of deep silence 
And now whimpers and cries, not of birth, this is what we bring 
A great crushing weight to push down youth and hope, taking the sphere 

This is the end, isn't it? 

We will never stop 
We will never die
The kingdom of the gods of death shadows over the Ark
