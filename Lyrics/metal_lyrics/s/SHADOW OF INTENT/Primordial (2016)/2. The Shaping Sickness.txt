Only maggots remember the mark you left in the dirt, crawling, swarming, gestating through your lifeless girth
Entombed in perdition, your blood begins to seep
Agonizing torture disregarded by the living you reap

Only memories of screams infect the brain
Forced to disregard the endless pain
The eternal fire commands your soul to torture

In the land of the damned, blood is the only moisture
Behold the demon flames cauterizing away their names

Fire seizing the day; bestowed below are those to blame
I'm sealed for an eternity in an unbreakable tomb force-feeding the excrement and vomit from a conglomerate mesh to the newborn

I've reclaimed my righted throne, resumed the bloodline, and claimed the hosts
To swallow all of time and space all known sentience shall be defaced
