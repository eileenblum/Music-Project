It came from the Magellanic cloud
Taking hosts, breaking bones into new forms, not death but something more
He swept us right off of our feet and caressed our worlds with crimson flame 
Taking hosts, breaking bones into new forms, not death but something more

When the sun withers and dies and the darkness takes whole 
When the reign of the wicked has overcome the toll 
The brainless ones and the souls of the righteous will burn our holy fucking Ecumene to the ground

Eviscerate the beast where he stands and sever each limb with precision 
Each system and its sentience will be ingested to construct new worlds for his deadened empire

We can keep this secret from you no more
The time has come for us to defend our stars, our branch of the Orion Arm, and all other life that exists among us

Rise, my Prometheans! 
It is time for us to wage war! 
Let us shatter their bones and let the skies rain coarse with their blood

Relish in the miasma, their rotting stench, and let the remnants of their singed bodies lie devoured by fire
For if we face defeat, this will just be the prelude of our bereavement
