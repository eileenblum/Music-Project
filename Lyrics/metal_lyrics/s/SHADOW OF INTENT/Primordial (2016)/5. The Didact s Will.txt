I came here unaware of the screams of the effigy, to seek out the higher entity, so righteously traitorous
The consequence macabre seals the essence; expiration before the monument crawling on hands and knees

Expulsions through the flesh as all their bones tilt their axis, blood draining from the body, evaporation through pores
Their king, a smoldering meat carcass devoid of purity

The buffet of a thousand tears to be served about the land, the pillaging of masses splits this earth to its core
The gaping hole is fed with bodies, hell cries out for more

No better nor worse than the Master Builder
Bound in stasis I would not be if not for his deceitful hegemony
Sucked into captivity

By the sentient tower of rotting corpses, I stand aware but paralyzed by fear
The sentient tower of rotting corpses, insight to the way we die 

I awake in the burn, an unknown system completely overthrown
Unable to cry for help, but mysteriously accompanied by allies in symmetrical forms

We are alone
Betrayed by the Master Builder, Ecumene's self-appointed leader
Replaced by my own imprinted clone
Yes, we are alone

That bastard betrayer! 
I shall exact my revenge and tell him of his wife and children
Bloody knowledge gained in the Primordial captivity
The galaxy will call to my imprint in a desperate plea
He gathers sources and an army to follow behind the other me so every last Promethean soul shall be absorbed to the digital realm. Through the guidance and the light of the composer, I shall defeat the flood

The effort is not enough
Resistance against infection, but the effort is not enough
Perhaps if the numbers were more in my favor? 
Or will this prove to be another of my failures? 

The answer lies in the enemy of my past

My sentence calls for annihilation, but once had been prohibited
No restraints, no leash, no ball and chain
It's time to reclaim my place

It's time to reclaim my name
It's time to reclaim my place 

In the name of the mantle, I stand before you on my mighty pedestal to bring acceptance of your fate to your minds
Encryption of your race shall be done in time

Thus I have chosen to commit my armory to what it is for all intents and purposes
The proverbial irresistible force
All that I have now is yours to do with as you please

Since my awakening from the Cryptum I've partially ignored the humans as a race, a monumental threat not only to us, but themselves

His slaves crawl on all fours as he rings the dinner bell 
I feel the outward pull of my membranes as they push to shatter my cells 
The buffet of a thousand tears to be served about the land, the pillaging of masses splits this earth to its core
The gaping hole is fed with bodies, hell cries out for more

I am the Didact, leader of the Forerunner's Ecumene warriors, and this is my will
Hell cries out for me
