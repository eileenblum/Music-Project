We descend through the fucking burning skies to search for intel on the surface of this overtaken world for decrepit, morbid parasites 
Fear clouds my mind 
As we touch the desolate grounds, purged of all its life 
The Didact himself stands upon his pedestal and with his might he pulls me forth 

Awakening from cryosleep I vomit forth the medication 
Proceeding to my throne, to oversee the devastation 
Upon arrival, I sensed something was wrong; the air was rotten with the stench of stagnant death 

Responding with force, elimination begins 
Slashing and stabbing their way into our bodies, tearing out our vocal chords and replacing our minds 
Handed over to the mind that binds 

Overtaken we are 
Proceeding to the vessel we had just arrived on 
The possession; unable to be broken free 
No time to figure out what is happening to me 

Struggling to scream 
Lungs itching from the strain; extreme agony 
Attempting to destroy the internal captor I press the blade to my throat 
My body has no reaction, I remain alive 
Failure in motion; paralyzed 

Their might cannot be triumphed 
Now we pay the price for letting them go it alone 

My body marches to the throne 
Actions present, mind vacant 
I sit surrounded by my crew 
They are twisted, contorted 
Their suffering; blatant 

Begin the exterimation 
The invoking 
The execution of worlds 

Me 
A mere manipular forced to fight 
Forced to face the horrors of our plight 
I can hear them 
Inside my head...their voices 
Me 
A speck of dirt on the tree of life 
A subject of the deepest known blight 
I can hear them 
Inside my head...their voices 

This world has been stripped of all its delicacies and purged of all its life 
Their might cannot be triumphed 
Execute the mandate 

The Invoking Of The Execution Of Worlds
