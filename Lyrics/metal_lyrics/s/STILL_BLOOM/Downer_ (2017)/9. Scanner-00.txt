They're in my head, they're in my lungs,
They're in my skin, in everything.
I feel them crawling, scratching at me from within.

Oh, Scanner, tell me what you mean,
I don't know what's real
What's happening?
I don't know how to feelâ¦ is this love or is this hate?
Am I just a slave to this game I play?
Itching, scratching, spinning and spinning
Nauseous blood flowing steady in my veins.
In my veins?
What the fuck?

Maybe I held the light too hard against my skin.
It burnt a hole, burnt out then let the madness inâ¦ it let the madness in.
Burnt up, it let the madness in
Itching scratching, what the fuck is happening?
What the fuck is happening?
Glitch in my mind, a virus in my thoughts whispering into my ear about all the life I've lost to the static.
To these bad habits.

Oh, Scanner, tell me what you mean,
I don't know what's real
What's happening?
I don't know how to feelâ¦ is this love or is this hate?
Am I just a slave to this game I play?
Itching, scratching, spinning and spinning
Nauseous blood flowing steady in my veins.
In my veinsâ¦ in my veins.
