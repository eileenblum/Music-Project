I feel the worms writhing in my bones, eating everything until they make my skull their home.
Burrow in and devour every thought, so I can't linger on everything I'm not.
I feel the worms writhing in my bones, eating everything until they make my skull their home.
Burrow in and devour every thought, so I can't linger on everything I'm not.

This existence is pain and my patience is gone, I built up these walls just to see them crumble down.
Self-destruction salvation, let the cold take over me.
Welcome me into darkness, make me one with the debris.
