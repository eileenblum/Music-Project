The gloom has numbed me to the feeling of the cold.
The ice and snow has saturated everything I've touched and everyone I know.
I just want the feeling back.

There's gotta be a deeper meaning to this winter in my soul, this crushing pain and nihilistic woe.
Frostbitten and drowned in sorrow,
Left for dead by my obsession with having no hope.
But I don't shake like I used to.
I don't shake like I used to but I feel the fucking weight.
It's like a ghost that hovering over me, pale in the face.
Pale in the face, hollow in the eyesâ¦ it looks a lot like me, oh how I hate my life.

Frostbitten and drowned in sorrow,
Left for dead by my obsession with having no hope.
There's gotta be a deeper meaning to this winter in my soul, this crushing pain and nihilistic woe.
Mortal disposition to self-destruction, constructing delusions of life- I don't think it's worth living.
I'm having issues painting the imageâ¦ I can't do this on my own, I lack the seeds to let happiness grow and I've succumbed to the idea that we all die alone.
We all die alone and I'm struggling to cope.
I lack the seeds to let happiness grow and I've succumbed to the idea that we all die alone.
