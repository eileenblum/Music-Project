I have this hole in my heart and as my head gets heavier, my world gets more dark.
'Til death do we starve.
We starve for attention and we starve for affection, and we starve for some meaning in this endless distraction.
My depression has been spurred with my endless obsession with the darkness
I'm lost in.
The more time I spend with you, the more it feels like I'm falling.

I'll find my way into my grave, while fucking mouthing the words that I'll engrave into my skin.
Into my heart.
Into everything that bears my mark.
The mark of the starving,
The mark of the depraved,
The mark of everyone that feels this way.

My depression has been spurred with my endless obsession with the darkness
I'm lost in.
The more time I spend with you, the more it feels like I'm falling and I can't stop it
There's nothing more to life than this pain that we suffer through.

I wish that this would all just fade away.
