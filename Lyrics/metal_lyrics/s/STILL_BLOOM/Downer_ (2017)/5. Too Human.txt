My skin cells shift incoherently, a slave to the static that surrounds everything.
My bones reinforce the idea that pain is all that's left for me in this placeâ¦
I have no idea why I stay.
I'm just another miserable face in this endless grey.
In this endless grey, end this pain.
I don't know why I stay, my bones reinforce the pain,
I sit here numb
Can't do anything.
Is this world really the right place for me?
Does this life mean anything? Anything at all?

I don't know why I stay, my bones reinforce the pain.
I don't know why I stay, is this world really the right place for me?

"Human.. All too human.. Human..
All too human."

I can see it in your face, as the colour drains,
Your will, your hopes, your dreams are fucking crumbling.
I can see it in your hands, they're trembling,
Anxiety
Just from existing.
Anxiety
It takes over me.
