[feat. Devin MacGillivray of YÃ¼th Forever]Knives in the dark
Suspicious from the start but I trusted your hand as I felt you carve and dig.
As you did, I felt you within and felt my sanity leave.
The more I felt your presence, your love became my obsession.
The more I clung to you, the more you looked like my perfect affliction
My fucking world.
Blood under your fingers
You grin at me, barring those beautiful teeth
(Coated with pieces of me).
Twisting and contorting in my vision...
This is the price I pay for giving my soul away.

Oxytocin, clouding my vision.
I've been dosed to the extreme, don't know what's left of me.

Don't know what's left of me without you.
You keep devouring and I can't stop you.
Feeding on my brain, I can't stop this painâ¦
I just keep reliving these moments I'll take to my grave as my happiest days.

Knives in the dark
Suspicious from the start but I trusted your hand as I felt you carve and dig.
I still feel you withinâ¦ I still feel you in my skinâ¦
