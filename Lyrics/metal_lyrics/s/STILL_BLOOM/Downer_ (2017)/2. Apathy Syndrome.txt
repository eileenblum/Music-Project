I can't feel, I can't hate.
I can't love, I can't escape.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.
This numbness has got its grip on me.
This alienation scares the hell out of me.
Spiraling and spiraling out of control, out of my mind.
These parallels don't add up, they're out of line.
All this this fixation on isolation has made me a hollow man, that can't get out of this hell.
I don't want out.
Maybe, I don't want outâ¦

I can't feel, I can't hate.
I can't love, I can't escape.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.
This numbness has got its grip on me.
This alienation scares the hell out of me.

All hail the suffering
The only god that makes me feel anything.
All hail the suffering!
