Does anyone hear me?
Does anyone see?
I'm suffocating and I can't breathe.
Slip, slip, slip, slip.
I'm slowly losing my grip.
A lone sailor on a sinking ship and I think I'm going down with it.
The pale void awaits meâ¦ The pail void awaitsâ¦
The pale void seeps into my lungs.
Tongues tied, gasping for air.
I feel the embrace of this despair.
I love the feeling of being alone, the only love I've ever known.
I can't believe that I can't breathe, I can't believe that this is happening.
Let the static infiltrate every sound.
I grasp at my throat, I've forgotten how to breathe.
The panic and stressâ¦ it's starting to get to me.
I scratch at my eyes, I've forgotten how to sleep.
The pale void calls out to me.
