Never thought i could kill a man
Raging for respect â new king â noble hearted
Still there's more i am longing for
Eastern world at war â conquest â invasion

So shall it be
Prepare for fight at break of dawn
I seek for blood
Power of an union

Fade away
Close teary eyes 
End of my life
So we rise and fall
The Empire's vast
It will not last â The Great Age Of Glory

No remorse and no sympathy
For the Persian crowd
The kingdom will fall

Babylon â it will rise today
Now the eye of the world
Dark times are close

The edge of time
Approaching without mercy
On a humble man
I'm falling into sleep

So desperate to leave
Your soul full of crimes
There's no way to believe
What you came to take â I will not cry

Hands of the gods, they will take care
Of  you and your men
Relief in the east â a new king reborn
A new world has come
My heart is at stake â for what is torn apart
