Pastime with good company
Iu love and shall untill i die
Grudge who lust, but none deny
So God be pleased, thus live will i
For my pastance, hunt, sing and dance
My heart is set
All goodly sport, for my comfort
Who shall me let? â Henry VIII

In a world of constant cruelty
Art and pleasure comfort all my senses
Game of thrones leading humanity
To lose the meaning of its existance

Love thyself last: love those hearts that hate thee
Corruption does not win more than honesty

When music plays its melody
Dancing made with majesty
Raise your stein of golden wine
We drink in the name of glory
But times are hard and man fall dead
If they betray off comes their head
Rejoice the bitter taste of crime
Legacy of Tudors

At the age of obscure ignorance
Education is a precious gift
When faith is preaching intolerance
A righteous life becomes so hard to live

Learn to know and to deceive minds of foes
A man of true heart shall never fear woes
