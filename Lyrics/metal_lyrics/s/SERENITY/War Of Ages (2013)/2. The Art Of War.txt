Ad gladios, Signa inferre
Ad gladios, Vae Victis
Ad gladios, Gloria Mundi
Ad gladios, Vae Victis
A statesman's heart must be placed in his head

I can remember all the days of violence
I can remember all the days they fought for rights
When men united all by fear and interest
I mastered them with hopeful promises i've broken

Almighty giver of all life
Sun you're my god, open my eyes,
I have to conquer; i am made to serve that aim

Do as i command,
You'll never stop a dreamer
Imagination rules the world
And i saw it grand
Fight at my side,
You'll never taste the failure
Courage is key â let me teach you so,
The Art Of War

I do not want bench covered with velvet,
I do not want a crown unless power goes with it
Religion i would use to serve ambition
Glory is fleeting, the obscure is forever
I have to conquer, no matter the pain, no matter the harm

I command for greater tomorrow,
Power is my reward.
Raise your head, fate will guide you now and forever
