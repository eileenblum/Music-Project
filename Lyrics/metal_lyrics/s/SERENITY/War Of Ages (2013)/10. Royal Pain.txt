If so royal is my nameÂ 
A blessing in disguiseÂ 
No more suffering- no pain- these daysÂ 

Waiting for my own golden crownÂ 
I can't feel a differenceÂ 
This low life ends without a tearÂ 
Don't say goodbyeÂ 

All I longed for feels like nothingÂ 
Of any meaning in my lifeÂ 
When the night fallsÂ 
My graceful heart heart showsÂ 
What it tried to hide from youÂ 
Fears of breakdown, safe appearanceÂ 
And I will never lose my faithÂ 
I'll rise even higherÂ 

No more count in this cold land- they're goneÂ 
Austrian empire they named- this reign of menÂ 

Bloodline will stay alive- my heirÂ 
I'm leaving somedayÂ 
No reason to turn down this emotion of miseryÂ 

All I longed for feels like nothingÂ 
Of any meaning in my lifeÂ 
When the night fallsÂ 
My graceful heart heart showsÂ 
What it tried to hide from youÂ 
Fears of breakdown, safe appearanceÂ 
And I will never lose my faithÂ 
I'll rise even higherÂ 

I belong to a historic reignÂ 
My legacy will be recalledÂ 
By all the people in this worldÂ 
I live onÂ 

All I wanted feels like nothing of worthÂ
