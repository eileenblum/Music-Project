My notes in the void,
Symphony for the quiet
Music is fading, my sanity with it

Muted is life
When  i open the window,
I can't catch a sound, can they hear me?

Twilight in my heart,
When all noises die with sorrow
But i still can hear the piano in my mind

I play for my soul
Harmonies of the past
Chase all the shadow away
At my dismay
No major chord can last
When choirs of fate deafen me

I sense distance,
Am i too far away?
Silence is closing all the lips on my way

But i still can feel the piano on the ground
