To my love,
The end has come
I'm sorry i'm not going home
Pain is gone but all i feel
Is the last blood in my veins to slowly running cold

Day after day, i fought so hard
Hoping to meet you once again
Orders obeyed, for a sacred aim
Do i need honor... am i left to die?

Don't loose your smile,
Love makes all good survive
You were my sunshine all the way
Don't close your eyes,
A new world is to rise
Forgive the wrongs we've done
For freedom's sake

Please my love
Survive this day,
I beg your heart to find a way
I shall be strong but i can't hide:
I don't know how to live without you by my side

I believed our war was right
But what a horrid waste reveals the light

Giving up the guns could change the game
Let's save the world from useless waves of pain

With dreams you dared to have now to live

Believe my heart
Though fate tore us apart
You were my angel all the way
Believe in men
To bring hate to an end
And never kill again
For freedom's sake
