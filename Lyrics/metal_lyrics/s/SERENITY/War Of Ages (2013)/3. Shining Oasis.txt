Unkown lands, their call ever strong
Then , my chance to set out for where i belong

Left my home and crossed the sea, dropped my old identity,
Found another way to live my life
Learned their language and their rites but had this dream in may nights
The one about the day when i return again

I will tell them of marvels my eyes have seen
Grandest of places where i've ever been
Shinig oasis, dream made of stone
My fate led me there where desert winds moon

Sunlight's glance is enchanting the place
Colours dance on walls hewn in far ancient days

Rose red city in the sand, true myth from an Eastern land
I am standing breathless, without words
Temples under deep blue skies unknown to European eyes,
Centuries they had slept here in desert's heart

In these lands illusions can fool you
In merciless light they glitter
Ancient wonders did reveal, the place i found is real
History will know my name
