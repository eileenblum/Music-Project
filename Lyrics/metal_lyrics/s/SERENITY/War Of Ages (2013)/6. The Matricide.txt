I can't stand a word from you,
I feed the darkness,
You keep sneaking into private affairs

I guess what i have to do,
For my own defense,
I must get my mother's voice
Reduced to silence

What an irony i witness,
Those not to trust: my family, can be the worse

Watch your back and the water in your wine, senators,
By the blade or the poison you will die, betrayers!
Don't forget that this empire is mine,
The Matricide to show: treason makes me pity no one

I show no remorse to Rome,
Weakness is a sin,
They shall never doubt my power to grow

When the walls no longer hide
Their conspiracy,
I find nothing else to say
âDead men tell no talesâ

You cannot hide your secrets
They turn into fear, you should better run away
Suspicion made your weary heart
Confuse the truth with the lies
Blinded by hatred from the start
You led your fate to your demise
