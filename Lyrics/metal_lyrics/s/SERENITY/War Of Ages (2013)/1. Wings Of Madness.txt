Out on the silent battlefield,
When the killing work is done and the crimson haze is gone,
Still lies the deadly sword i wield
And i am dreaming of your face, have begun to count the days

But i fear to face a dreadful fate
I am afraid to lose the one i cherish

No sun is shining in the sky
On wings of madness we will fly
We can't cross the distance
Away from reason
No sun is shining in your eyes
A shadow growing in disguise
I can't stand the slence
Embracing you at night

Here in the corner of my mind
Is a constant, longing scream, like an echo of a dream
Oh, there is always peace to be find
In a drop of blood that shines while a lonesome creature whines

Can i save you from a dreadful fate,
I am afraid to lose the one i cherish

I see you dancing with your demons
