Words from the heart
Like verse of angels passing by
Are etched in time
The stones can't speak
My fleeting soul and inner peace
They cannot lie
I didn't need this pain
I never thought it could rain so hard on me
Change
Is only good when it is mutual
This life's perpetual
I came through grief
And I feel you near to me
A constant memory
Sit by the window
Watching summer rain fall down
Like April snow
I didn't want this pain
I never thought it could rain so hard on me
ChangeIs only good when it is mutual
This life's perpetual
I didn't want this pain
I never thought it could rain
