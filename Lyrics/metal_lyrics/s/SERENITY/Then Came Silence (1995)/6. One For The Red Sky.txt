Your weakness it builds me
You follow so blindly
Your anger it stains me
I conquer sublimely
Your conscience it pains you
To see me defeat you
Here's one for the red sky
Ambitious man but so am I
Need success so deep it burns
Listen hard and you might learn
In my head, I am free
I'm just a little bitter me
In my mind, I am dead
Was it something that I said
Your genius astounds me
Wherever it may collar me
I feel it, divine me
The blood you bleed flows cleanly
The mark that taints you
I see clear through you
Here's one for the red sky
Ambitious man but so am I
Need success so deep it burns
Listen hard and you might learn
God like figure, you've been cursed
Stick the needle in for worse
In your mind, you are dead
Was it something that I said
The one that will not be
Is not the one that finds peace
Of mind and of body
In my head I like me
Do you too?, I wonder
You want to stay away
