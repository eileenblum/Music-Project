With purest soul of mine
I beg thee come to me
Emerald eyes like deepest sky
Enveloped in the darkness of your skin
With every breath, every thought I make
Just one touch would fill my empty days
They say things come to those who wait
If wait I must theb wait I will
And if lied well then I die
And then came silence
A fading memory falls apart
Feel like I've stopped before I start
Darkness rains down all over me
The lifes blood tastes so bitter sweet
With purest soul of mine
I beg thee come to me
Emerald eyes like deepest sky
Enveloped in the darkness of your skin
With every breath, every thought I make
And then came silence
