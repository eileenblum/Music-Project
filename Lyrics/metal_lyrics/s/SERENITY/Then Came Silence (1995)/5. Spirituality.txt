Walking through the wilderness
My thoughs are introspective
Can't find the thing I want
But then I know what I need
Pain is the consequence
From misuse of the mind
The truth never lies
Just hides itself for a while
How lives of insurrection
Lead to eternal depression
My heart grows weak and tired
The sky's a darker shade of black
My heart lies languishing
In the depths of the hell in my soul
The city's turn to dust
While the rich man turns away
Forgiveness is the key
To unlock your kept love
Spirituality,
To love is not enough
How lives of insurrection
Lead to eternal depression
My heart grows weak and tired
The sky's a darker shade of black
Yeah, come take my self, my soul,
My nightmares
I am the one who love you most
Look to me, look to me for freedom
Feel me inside
Thinking 'till the morning hours
Desolation sows the seeds of doubt
Inside minds of fortunate ones
Never stray, never yearning
Pain is the consequence
From misuse of the mind
The truth never lies
Just hides itself for a while
How lives of insurrection
Lead to eternal depression
My heart grows weak and tired
The sky's a darker shade of black
