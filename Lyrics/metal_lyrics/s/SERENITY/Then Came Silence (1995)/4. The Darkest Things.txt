I never said I believed in angels
They come to me in dreams
Unfold the secret of mind
The dull hold the screams
Mirage is my life inside
Beautiful and surreal
Image of my once full life
I wish I could so feel
Am I the one that looks into the fire
Who holds the flame
Am I the one that lives inside
I never said I believed in demons
They come to me in visions
Laugh and mock and breed self-pity
These vengeful apparitions
Live through hate, live in fear
I am, yet I am nothing
Compared to you, your sacred life
Your love I am not worthy
Empty life I do not wonder
Of what you left behind
Leave me be in purity
