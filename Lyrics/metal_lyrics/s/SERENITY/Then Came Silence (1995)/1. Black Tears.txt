All alone on this silent shore
Waves of loneliness surround me
Joy eludes me now as pain takes hold
Renew the sorrow that I feel
You hound my vision, I can no longer see
You shiel the truth, the truth so cruel to me
This growing fear, brings me to my knees
Soon to end, all hope is lost forever
Silent scream, they echo inside my head
Belief is gone, denial shattering me
Insanity calls, black tears to fall
This is my destiny, lost in my dreams
No backwards glance, you begin to fade
You stole my heart, hear my last plea
Soon to end, all hope is lost forever
Silent scream, they echo inside my head
Belief is gone, denial shattering me
Insanity calls, black tears to fall
