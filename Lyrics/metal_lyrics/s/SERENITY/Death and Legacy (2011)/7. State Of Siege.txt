It comes again
When the temples are shining in golden light
And day fades away
Deep inside
There's a feeling that i have not chosen well
My role in this play
All this time
I have been a good soldier whose will was strong
So i played my part
A painful song
Is the cry of a friend as they raise the knife
To cut out his heart

[bridge:]
I've never tasted fear but now i know
Fearful nights and days of woe
Our raging treasure hunt has ended here
What's the use of all gold when death is near?

[chorus:]
State of siege
A peaceful ending out of reach
Our vessels were burning on the beach
The general, he left us no choice but to die in this land

In their eyes
We were heralds of gods who would bring liberation
Far too late
They did realize what we bring is damnation

[bridge:]
I've never tasted fear but now i know
Fearful nights and days of woe
I've heard my promised piece of land's right here
I'll resign it, my friend, my death is near!

[chorus]

[canon, line 1:]
Hear me, god, i am a simple man who's praying for a chance to return home again
Oh i've shot so many men, i'm sick of killing, save my life, get me out of this land
[canon, line 2:]
Hear me, god, to stay alive
Hear me, god, i am a man who's praying for a chance to stay alive
[canon, line 3:]
Save my life, i'm sick of killing

[chorus 2x]
