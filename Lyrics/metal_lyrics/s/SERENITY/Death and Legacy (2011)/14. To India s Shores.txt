She wears a ruby necklace
She's got those emerald eyes
Her pace is graceful and her words are wise
Hoping my pleading could get the treaty signed
I tried so hard and failed again
Then something's changed her mind

[chorus:]
So my time has come
Nothing is impossible, it can be done
A course no navigator's sailed before
To india's shores

The conquest of granada
Impossible, they said
But she has courage no one's ever had
She proved them wrong and so will i
My dream will never die

[chorus:]
So my time has come
Nothing is impossible, it can be done!
I'll sail into the west and showing everyone
That nothing is impossible, i'll be the one
To find a course no navigator's sailed before
To india's shores

When i close my eyes
I see cities made of gold
In a land where nobody grows old

[chorus:]
So my time has come
Nothing is impossible, it can be done!
I'll sail into the west and showing everyone
That nothing is impossible, i'll be the one
To find a course no navigator's sailed before
To india's shores
