So ends the tale of a hero
with a true English heart
Of a man who knows pain and sorrow
and the fortunes in life
Villain, then hero, then scapegoat was I
Once I was knighted, now my star disappeared
in a darkening sky

[Chorus 1:]
Never feared the enemy
not on land, nor on sea
Beating loud inside me, I can't negate
I've been always fighting for,
for my Queen forevermore
the empire's blade for a changing fate

This news is too disappointing
to ignore it, Sir Drake!
Sunken ships and twelve thousand fallen,
a disastrous mistake!
You've been a daring, reliable man (I'm still that man!)
upright and loyal to his Queen and land
Now our union must end

[Chorus 2:]
Never feared the enemy
not on land, nor on sea
Beating loud inside me, I can't negate
We've been always fighting for
our land forevermore
The empire's blade for a changing fate

â¦ the island's fate forever
May England's people ever
know well our names and honour
our legacy â¦

Will now the overrun armada rise again?
Finally tide has turned
I fear the menace of invasion is at hand â¦
Hear me now, I have learned my lesson, please be gracious
I shall never fail anymore!

[Chorus 2 3x]
