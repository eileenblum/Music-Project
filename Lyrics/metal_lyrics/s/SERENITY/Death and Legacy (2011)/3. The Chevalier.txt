[Thomas Buchberger, Mario Hirzinger &amp; Georg Neuhauser]

When silence comes and I focus all on the inside
I take a look into my past
Full of wrongs, full of rights
The story of my life
So many different places
Enjoyed so many Nights
I dance with chances
I made my way
Until this present day

You are one I'd give my life for
You are the one who is haunting my dreams
(Haunting my dreams..)
Oh, how I long to be yours forevermore
For all time our love shall be prime

I still see you dancing...

That night in that shiny hall
The same old boring Gentry
Then you caught my eyes
You played your game
Used all your sweetest words
I was entertained,
But tell me are they true

Things they say about you
A mason and a spy
He knows all beds
Escaped the leads
Oh, Chevalier tell me another lie

You are one I'd give my life for
You are the one who is haunting my dreams
(Haunting my dreams..)
Oh, how I long to be yours forevermore
For all time our love shall be prime

Hold me
(How can I?)
A game
(like all your gambles?)
The only
(until this day is gone?)
Hold me
(How can I?)
A game
(like all your gambles?)
What can I do to change your mind?

You are one I'd give my life for
You are the one who is haunting my dreams
(Haunting my dreams..)
Oh, how I long to be yours forevermore
For all time our love shall be prime

I'll make this vow tonight

I see all lights are low
Show me I have to go
Venice can ease all my pain
Will do so once again
