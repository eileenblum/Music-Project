'Unbelievable' - that's what they say when I speak true
then they jeer at me like fools may do
So deplorable, this narrow-minded ignorance
I won't tell them how my story ends

[Bridge:]
Tell me why should I lie
as I'm going to die
All my memories are true, I swear

I remember them, the kingdoms of the rising sun
and I still hear the sound of silver chimes
Gold and ivory, precious gems and silken robes
marble palaces from sunken times

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Illusions, all troubles and tears?
Had I been dreaming my life for seventeen years?
So many wonders I've seen
roaming the far eastern lands beyond desert sands

My second life had begun
in the service of China's great Khan
As a respected and far-travelled man
I would see my dear homeland again

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2x]
