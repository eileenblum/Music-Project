We can't deny the signs clearly showing the times are changing
Floods rise and comets fly
Is this the end?
Is judgment night?

[Bridge:]
Drawing lines and colours true and fair
I create a mirrored universe

[Chorus:]
I see the world through different eyes,
that's the painter's soul and mind
My hands are guided by a force
some would call divine
A gifted man, but I know
there is still so much to learn
And in some dreams canvas starts to burn
when I touch it

I've been to foreign lands
in north and south where legends dwell
But perfect harmony
remains a mystery, hidden well

Drawing lines and colours true and fair
I create a mirrored universe

I see the world through different eyes,
that's the painter's soul and mind
My hands are guided by a force
some would call divine
A gifted man, but I know
there is still so much to learn
And in some dreams canvas starts to burn
when I touch it

Drawing lines and colours true and fair
I create a mirrored universe

I see the world through different eyes,
that's the painter's soul and mind
My hands are guided by a force
some would call divine

I see the world through different eyes,
that's the painter's soul and mind
My hands are guided by a force
some would call divine
A gifted man, but I know
there is still so much to learn
And in some dreams canvas starts to burn
when I touch it
