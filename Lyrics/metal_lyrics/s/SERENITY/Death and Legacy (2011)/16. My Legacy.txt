Light has gone
I'll never see the sun again
My days will be as dark as my nights
A question burning in my mind:
What is left to do for the observer when he's blind?

The telescope was my obsession
I longed to see the wonders of the sky
Moon and sun and jupiter's companions
The milky way in all its splendour, stars numbered high

[bridge 1:]
I know the key to the book of creation
Wandering a dark maze are those who don't know

[chorus:]
All those years in shame and in torture
Self denial has clouded my ways
Verity comes as time is passing
I'll fade away but my legacy stays

To illustrate all that surrounds us,
Unveil the glory of our maker's plan
This i thought to be my only mission
A different picture of the world, a blessing for mankind

[bridge 2:]
I tried to open their hearts and their eyes
A trial in rome swept my good hopes away

[chorus:]
Sight is gone
I'll never see the world again
My days will be as dark as my nights
Still a question in my mind:
What is left to do for me now, old of age and blind?

[bridge 1]

[chorus]
