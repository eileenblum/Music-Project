They could not control us and started to fear us
So our story had to end 

Almost two hundred years have passed
And it seems that I will be the last
Last of the masters, faithful and bold
Who's now tired and old

[Bridge:]
The templar cross is growing pale (growing pale)
We never thought our plans would fail (never fail)

[Chorus:]
A sacred ambition, a heavenly mission:
Liberate the Holy Land
Our power grew stronger, they tarry no longer
So our story has to end

Maybe we somehow lost our ways,
And have fallen from God's grace
But He'll remember our noble aims
When we'll die by the flames

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Oh Jesus forgive me, they made me lie
Be with me, watch over me when I die

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]
