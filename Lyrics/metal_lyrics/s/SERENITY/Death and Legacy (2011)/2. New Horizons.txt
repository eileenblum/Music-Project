Nova Albion, your haven we must leave
Find our way on a silent sea
Brave men did before with unshakable belief
Sailed around the world and so shall we

The war of crowns seems to be a tale so far away
This is the time to write my own tale

New horizons lie beyond the sunâs golden doors
Riding high on waves of fortune without fear
New horizons for this son of English shores
And the fire of the cannons light the way

Hundreds were lost in fifty days of storm
In all those endless fights and treachery
Sailing for the queen we are gambling with our lives
In many of her games Iâve been the key

The war of crowns seems to be a tale so far away
This is the time to write my own tale, I know that I wonât fail
I see the strongest ships and daring men in company
Seven seas here Iâm coming

An apprehension
Means inquisition
Faith collision
Leads to division

Give us just a reason, weâll be devilâs breed instead of men
Do not try to fool us as no one can
