Here â in my fortress
Defending the whole sacred land
Rage â for the bloodshed
The past will not happen again

Knights like we are
Fighting for freedom
Brave weâre living
Keep the heads held high

Welcome to the foreign land
Find your peace in blood and sand
For your cross raise sword and crown
These walls break them down

Meet â here on eye height
As prayers and soldiers combined
Give â all we have to
No mercy in this final fight

Call to arms for gods above
Why we canât stop, why we stay blind
Faith was send for peace and love
Leave the war behind

Welcome to the foreign land
Find your peace in blood and sand
For your cross raise sword and crown
These walls break them down

Welcome to the foreign land
Here we end in blood and sand
For our gods we keep this town
These walls wonât break down.
