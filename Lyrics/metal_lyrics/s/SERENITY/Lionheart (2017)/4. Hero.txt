Sailing now, to a better place
In my dreams, a place to stay
Conquering the fallen lands
Spreading all the higher sense
Justice is whatâs needed
There is no compromise

All disputes and arrogance
Found myself without a friend
After all my duties I will reach the sky

Now
Itâs not my time to die
I will be your hero
Keeping up what is ours
Now
Across the holy land
I will show my power
Rising my flags

Slave of my eternal grace
Trivial duke leave the crusade

Threaten me, hypocrisy
Messing up my destiny
Iâm the king of England and I will return

Now
Itâs not my time to die
I will be your hero
Keeping up what is ours
Now
Across the holy land
I will show my power
Iâll rise my flags to the sky

Lord, I swear
Iâm a pilgrim of this world
I will pursue it till the end
Here I stand
Sister, why did you forget?
Imprisoned â all plans failed

Now
Thereâs no time to die
Looking in the mirror
No, I wonât be devoured
Here
Across the seven seas
I will show my power
Rising my flags
I will rise up my flags and find the light.
