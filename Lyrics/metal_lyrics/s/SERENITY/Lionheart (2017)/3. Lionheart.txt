Darkness in my soul
Left inside of me
Thunder and lightning is
Everything I see

Try to forget all this cruel and pain
Forgiveness is all that I gain

Open your eyes, you will see
Jerusalem unites us against Saladin

Like a lion we fight
Together we will die
For the glory of our god
Justice on our side
This cross will lead the light
Follow Richard Lionheart

Salvation is my hope
At the holy grave
Through incense and candles Iâm
Praying on my knees

God will forgive me for all that Iâve done
To triumph the devilâs dark throne.
