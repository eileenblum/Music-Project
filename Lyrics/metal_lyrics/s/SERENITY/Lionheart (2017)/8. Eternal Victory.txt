We head out to sea
On our holy way
Raise the sails and conquer the day

Here we go again
Destiny will lead us
Headed by the one
By our king and our god

We keep the
Hearts burning
Defy resistance,
Conning straight through the storm

Come with me
The ocean will lead in waves
Gone with the winds
Dark, cold sea

This crusade
Will be our history
In the end
Eternal victory

Sailors on the sea
On their final way
To brave the unknown waters that day

Here we go again
Victory we seek for
Close to reach the shore
Close to enter the war.
