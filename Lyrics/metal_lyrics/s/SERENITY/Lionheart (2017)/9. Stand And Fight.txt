We will stand and fight
We will celebrate united
We shall aim the same
And carry on until the end
Freedom of our lands
We have always wished to reign
Marching side by side again
One and only king

Trust me, brothers
We wonât forgive him
In his name weâll never surrender
This illusion of loyalty brought us here
So letâs gather, no more retreating

Heâs the king
Showing all his power
Twenty thousand men
But we wonât wait â stand still

Trust me, mother
I will revenge you
I will set you free
Hereâs my promise
Lovely bride
I did not forget you
Your true king is claiming his title

Thereâs no chance
We will get what is ours
We will not give up
And wonât give in â brothers

We will stand and fight
There will be a new king tonight
Let us lift the grails.
