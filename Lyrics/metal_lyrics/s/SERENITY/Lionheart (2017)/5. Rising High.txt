Rising high
Sailing with desire
Loss of war
Mark of the crusade
Here we stand
We will feed the fire
Wo, oh oh ohâ¦

Stormy night of sorrow
How could I ever expect
I was with my brothers by my side
Suddenly I lost them
Are they gone? Will we then meet again?
No, I have no fear

There is a star in the sky
Shining and leading my way

I claim back what is mine!
Thereâs my bride, please let her go
I warn you, Isaac, hear my sigh
If you fight against us
I swear, you wonât see the light again
Not even a beam

There is a star in the sky
Shining and leading my way

Set them free
They will need a leader
We will put him in silver chains
My crusaders, sons of England
Conquerers of the world

Rising high
Sailing with desire
Loss of war
Mark of the crusade
Here we stand
We will feed the fire
Wo, oh oh ohâ¦
Rising high, fight the sky.
