Iâve been praying my Lord
Iâve been waiting for a sign
Where I can see the reasons of my mistakes

I hope this is tomorrow
Crawling to myself
Is there perdition for my soul?

They watch me
Will they sacrifice me?
I lay here now â and forever

Caged in this prison I
Will never see the light
Wicked fate, is this your treason?
Wake up on the other side
A place where angels live
I close my eyes, no more memories
I know that this is not my call!

Is this my fantasy?
Here in my mind, surrounded by four walls
Iâm still waiting for that sign (waiting for a sign)
Hear my inner silent cries

Is this my fantasy?
In my mind itâs â what I want to see
Godâs my only memory
Alone in this cold tower

I watch them
They wonât sacrifice me
Wonât lose my crown
No. never!

This is my fantasy
Here in my heart, caged in this dark hole
Iâm still waiting for that sign (waiting for a sign)
Hear my inner silent cries

Is this my fantasy?
In my mind itâs â what I want to see
Godâs my only memory
Alone in this cold tower.
