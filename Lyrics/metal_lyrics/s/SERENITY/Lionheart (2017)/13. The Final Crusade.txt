Let me write these final words and turn the page
Of a book that tells a story of crusades

For the cross I lived my life until the end
For the throne and all the memories I saved

Time â time has come
Time to die
Surrender all you have

Pray â before youâre gone
To your god
One last time

Angles come down tonight
Thereâs no longer a distance
Between heaven and my life
To the light they guide me

On my way to horizon
Itâs time to say goodbye
And justice was my aim
My Legacy wonât die

Tale a look back on my journey through this world
From the shores at home into the holy land

If I had to choose this path of life and pain
For my God I swear Iâll do it all again.
