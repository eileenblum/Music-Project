Alea iacta est
The time has come to fight
For blood and honour
Cause deus lo vult

Haunting shadows in the dark
We are creeping through the night
We believe in something leading our hearts

One last prayer to the stars
Till the morning sun will rise
Your reign will fall apart

We were waiting
God was calling
In our crusade we will rise, you will fall

Down at the gates
At the home of our god
We lay down our life
Let your empire trembling

Here at the crossroads
We will die for the throne
We will break the walls
United we are strong
Your empire falls

Call of justice, call of war
Crashing down the longtime foe
Show no mercy until we are finally home

We were waiting
God was calling
In our crusade we will rise, you will fall

Down at the gates
At the home of our god
We lay down our life
Let your empire trembling

Here at the crossroads
We will die for the throne
We will break the walls
United we are strong
Your empire falls

At the home of my god
I lay down my life
For the throne
For the empire.
