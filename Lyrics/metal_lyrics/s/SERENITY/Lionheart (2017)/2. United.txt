In the name of God
Marching to horizon
Beyond the morning sun
Forever in the light

Like a holy squad
Our empire is rising
Defending our world
We face the final fight

You wonât stem the tight no more
We follow the sign
To find the glorious way tonight

Wait for the dawn
Of justice will come
Down in the land they have taken

Weâll return to the days
Where our kingdom was endless and sacred
United, together till the end

All for one we fought
Bleeding, sacrificing
We set the world on fire
Crusading holy knights

Driven by the cross and Rome
In his name we shall file in
A battle of the gods
A fight on earth tonight.
