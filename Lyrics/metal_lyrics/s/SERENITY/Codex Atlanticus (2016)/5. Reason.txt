There was a time when I felt like to fall
What is left to do?
Seems I'm failing too?
But I will dedicate this to you
No one else could be
You will not betray

Struggles with all that rage
Will never be the same
Astonishing master plan
1,000 years of pain

Trust and see
You and me
In this life, don't we have a reason?
Trust and see
Mystery
Nothing will tear us apart

There's no way I will disappoint you
I will not refuse
A statement of hope
Your dedication will guide me through years
Years of decay
Human race in strain

An innocent will to know
How things are inside
But digging too deep we'll fall
Losing all our goals

Trust and see
You and me
In this life, don't we have a reason?
Trust and see
Mystery
Nothing will tear us apart

Trust in me
Don't you see?
Universe, enlighten hearts

Trust and see
You and me
In this life, don't we have a reason?
Trust and see
Mystery
Nothing will tear us apart
In this life we will have - enlighten hearts
