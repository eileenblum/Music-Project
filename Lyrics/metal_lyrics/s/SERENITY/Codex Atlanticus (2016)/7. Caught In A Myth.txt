Lost in a world beyond your mind
of beauty and strength
You won't believe in my faith of men
Opened a door, a look deep inside
I felt in my hands
that humans are made out of more
than gods intent

Calling disbelievers
Come here to see
Veins, blood and their meanings
Accept their real verity

Caught in this myth of ourselves long ago
It's time to break free
Split body and soul
The heart is no altar
The ribs are no dome
Just muscles and flesh
Down skin, up on bones

Dissections complete, I drew every line
I stucked, it payed well
Details in the humankind
Just burst in our shells
Deciphered the secrets, I'll bring them to light
In order to prove
now I have to start the age of science
Age of truth

Calling disbelievers
Come here to see
Veins, blood and their meanings
Accept their real verity

Caught in this myth of ourselves long ago
It's time to break free
Split body and soul
The heart is no altar
The ribs are no dome
I take this for granted

Escaping this myth we were caught long ago
We'll glean so much more
of our body and soul
Minds become priests,
we'll memorize all
destiny leads us

Just go
Don't hide
tell all your insight

Stay strong
DonÂ´t shy
join this new path
reface the world
