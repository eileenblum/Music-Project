Crawling to the darkness
Waiting for some hope
Can't remember where all the light's gone
I tried to force myself
Not to think about the past
Together we won't build up a future

I see your face everywhere
But there is a reason
to leave you alone
Can't find a way, a second time to return
I torn between two sides of me

I'm sorry
my world does a call
I altered to someone else
I can not deny it
I'm sorry
I beg you, don't cry
it's my fate to reach the sky
before our world has turned to grey

Looking though the window
Looking though the glass
even if it kills me I have to
set my sails to leave
Wrote this lines in tears
But I have to tell you "forgive me"

I see your face everywhere
But there is a reason
to leave you alone
Can't find a way, a second time to return
I torn between two sides of me

I'm sorry
my world does a call
I altered to someone else
I can not deny it
I'm sorry
I beg you, don't cry
it's my fate to reach the sky
before our world has turned

Sacrificed my only love
Castigate my heart so much
Seeking things so high above
the present time
Is it worth to change my life
Am I wrong or do I right
What if in the end I will fail

I'm sorry
my world does a call
I altered to someone else
I can not deny it
I'm sorry
I beg you, don't cry
it's my fate to reach the sky
before our world has turned
