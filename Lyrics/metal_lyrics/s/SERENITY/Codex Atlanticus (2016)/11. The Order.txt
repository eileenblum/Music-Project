I just remember it like yesterday
Been to a place somewhere else
So hard I tried to hide there all my secrets
Distraught I called for help
No brainer question, easy remedy
They trapped me to their own world
Became a part, contract my sanity
this time felt so well

But as I saw their true reality
My only wish was to escape
They start to fool, they start to betray
if you will leave the Orders' way

Here I stand alone
with my back to the wall
Shall I stand for more
or cause the downfall
Hunted high and low
forgot who I was before
I will pay the price
the Order holds myself forevermore

And so it's time to face what's left of me
to lead me straight out of hell
Within these doubts within my broken inside
I will remain until eternity

Again I feel their true reality
My only wish is to escape
They start to fool, they start to betray
if you will leave the Orders' way

Here I stand alone
with my back to the wall
Shall I stand for more
or cause the downfall
Hunted high and low
forgot who I was before
I will pay the price
the Order holds myself forevermore
