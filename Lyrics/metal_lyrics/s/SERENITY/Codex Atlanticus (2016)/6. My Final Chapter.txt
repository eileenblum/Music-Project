On the edge of life
It's time to step behind
Of all the things that you have done
The book with all my lines
the meanings you may find
Will change the world forever

Here I lay all alone
It's my final chapter
Time to leave
Time to die

My light starts fading out
Your magic I just found
You led me on my path of truth
As desperate grateful son
recalling dark years gone
while kneeling here so close to you

Here I lay all alone
It's my final chapter
Close to you
Close to reach the only one I ever loved
Your fields so green, your bluest sky
Beneath the deepest water
My everything
It's time to die

Lay all alone...

Lead my soul close to you
