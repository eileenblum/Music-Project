There is a painting I'm working on
It haunts my dreams when the day is gone
In glaring sunlight it is there in my heart and mind
Just simple orders again and again
Lady in splendour wealthy man
This one is special, far beyond any known kind

I got a sensation that my creation in a quite disturbing way
has come to life
Determines direction, cries for perfection,
there's no chance for me to stray
day by day

You're the sun in our skies
and the mother of all
(Your) silent grace never dies
while every kingdom must fall
Trust in me perfect woman,
I'll make you shine
for all time, ooh

Night becomes the day becomes tomorrow
He's trapped under her spell
Is it just painted wood or is it more?
He cannot ignore what he feels, creating her, giving her a face
mysterious in so many ways

I painted angels, saints in their light
the virgin Mary, gentle and bright
You will somehow outshine them all, this is my vow

You're the sun in our skies
and the mother of all
(Your) silent grace never dies
while every kingdom must fall
Trust in me perfect woman,
I'll make you shine
for all time, ooh
