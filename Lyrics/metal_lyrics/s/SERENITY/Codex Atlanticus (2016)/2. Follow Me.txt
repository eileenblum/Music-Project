That can't be a loss of time
I won't wait and see
The truth is just hiding
Bigotry hungry for power
But I will say no
Never lose my hope

Investigate, secrets revealed
My book of life's full of holes

Here I am, here I stand
Nothing left to say
My destiny will stay with me in sorrow
Here I am, here I stand
Redemption for my sins
Sign of the cross can't halt my way
Follow me

Rise up to a different sky
Leave the past behind
Aim for a future
Generation has been devoured
I won't fight alone
A silent leading flame

Working and praying not to obey
Creating a sentence for souls

Here I am, here I stand
Nothing left to say
My destiny will stay with me in sorrow
Here I am, here I stand
Redemption for my sins
Sign of the cross can't halt my way
Follow me

Investigate, secrets revealed
My book of life's full of holes

Here I am, here I stand
Nothing left to say
My destiny will stay with me in sorrow
Here I am, here I stand
Redemption for my sins
Sign of the cross can't halt my way
Follow me
