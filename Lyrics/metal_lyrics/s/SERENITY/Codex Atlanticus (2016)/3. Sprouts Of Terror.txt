Plans of conquering
Bringing sprouts of terror
There is fear, I know but no one will die
I will be the one holding back destruction
As my dreams become reality

No one wins
Everyone will fall
Bloody tears
Desecrate a thriving world

I'm lost in my thoughts again
I've spiraled down
It seems there's no way out
Start losing my faith again
Inside my void
This darkness will rise

The weight of war in my hands cold
Death will follow me now everywhere I go
Defend the home where I belong
Justify my skills and bring the light

Inside of my vivid dreams
ThereÂ´s no place for terror
I was doubting but now I can see the light
I will be the one bringing our cognition
And there's no reason to despair

No one wins
Everyone will fall
Bloody tears
Desecrate a thriving world

I'm lost in my thoughts again
I've spiraled down
It seems there's no way out
Start losing my faith again
Inside my void
This darkness will rise

The weight of war in my hands cold
Death will follow me now everywhere I go
Defend the home where I belong
And destruction will forever be forestalled
I won't be there if sorrow wins
Sacrifice, the only way to keep control
If they're in need, I will be there
Justify my skills and bring the light

I've opened my eyes again
Creating now
What I've been asked to shape
My thoughts are now clear again
Filling this void
Tormenting my soul

The weight of war in my hands cold
Death will follow me now everywhere I go
Defend the home where I belong
And destruction will forever be forestalled
I won't be there if sorrow wins
Sacrifice, the only way to keep control
If they're in need, I will be there
Justify my skills and bring the light
