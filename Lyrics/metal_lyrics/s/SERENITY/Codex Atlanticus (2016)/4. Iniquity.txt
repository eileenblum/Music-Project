Faces walking by
Voices just pretending
No one really tries
To seek the beauty inside

Their thoughts stuck in my mind
Their ignorance kept growing
The world is passing by
As darkness filling the light

Breathing in and calming down while nature's calling
And so I close my eyes to leave this all behind

Justice defines the truth and the lies
Where is the end to stop the fall
Seems hard to find our balance in life
With the sense of all
Iniquity rise, you cannot stay blind
Thoughtless while searching for the core
We can't deny our sacrifice
If we stop the fall

I wished I could escape
Fly like birds are flying
Find a better place
Find my peace and home

Breathing in and calming down while nature's calling
And so I close my eyes to leave this all behind

[3x]
Justice defines the truth and the lies
Where is the end to stop the fall
Seems hard to find our balance in life
With the sense of all
Iniquity rise, you cannot stay blind
Thoughtless while searching for the core
We can't deny our sacrifice
If we stop the fall
