Born in shadows of Renaissance
faith and new science collide
Revolutions and all we've seen
Beyond these great gates of unknown

Losing hopes of a new belief
forcing myself to go on

Now I see the light
My darkest views have disappeared
there's a sense that lays beyond this fate
I'll leave it all behind
Now I feel my life
I'll build a new tomorrow
Caged for all this time
finally free again
free again

A world made of hypocrisy
But my future starts are aligned
This inner feeling of ecstasy
Will lead me to grand discoveries

I've been raised to forget and pray
Nature is making my way

Now I see the light
My darkest views have disappeared
there's a sense that lays beyond this fate
I'll leave it all behind
Now I feel my life
I'll build a new tomorrow
Caged for all this time
finally free again

Do you see the light?
Is this the new tomorrow?
Finally I realize
The meaning of my fate
Now I feel my life
I'll build a new tomorrow
Caged for all this time
finally free (again)

Now I feel my life
I'll build a new tomorrow
Caged for all this endless time
Now I see the light
My darkest views have disappeared
there's a sense that lays beyond this fate
I'll leave it all behind
