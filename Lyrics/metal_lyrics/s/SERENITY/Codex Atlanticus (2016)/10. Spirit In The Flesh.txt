The candles are lighted, the blades lie there shining
soon they'll do their sacred work again
Covered in linen, fallen in eternal sleep,
a body prepared on the table

Now life is gone and the soul has fled to a place that's so far away

All the things I see given by the maker's hand
leave me humble and I stand lost in wonder
It's a perfect alchemy and the undeniable sign
of a spirit in the flesh, so divine (flesh so divine)

I met them all from infant to old man,
opened up their mortal frames so silent
Noble lady, crooked man, orphan child and centenerian
look all the same in the inside

Their life is gone and their souls have fled to a place that's so far away

All outstanding things I see given by the maker's hand
leave me humble and I stand lost in wonder
It's a perfect alchemy and the undeniable sign
of a spirit in the flesh, so divine
It's a perfect alchemy and the undeniable sign
of a spirit in the flesh, so divine (flesh so divine)

These studies, discoveries, will be my gift to mankind

All outstanding things I see given by the maker's hand
leave me humble and I stand lost in wonder
It's a perfect alchemy and the undeniable sign
of a spirit in the flesh, so divine
All outstanding things I see given by the maker's hand
leave me humble and I stand lost in wonder
It's a perfect alchemy and the undeniable sign
of a spirit in the flesh, so divine (flesh so divine)
