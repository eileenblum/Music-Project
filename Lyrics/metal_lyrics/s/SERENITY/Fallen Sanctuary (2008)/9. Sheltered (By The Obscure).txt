Here the trees have eyes
And the gloomy house mistaken for a shelter opens wide
To swallow you
You don't have to run
At the forest's edge you feel that this is where they hide
Observing you

[Chorus:]
We are your shelter in the night
Claws of cold will hold you tight
Oh so eerie is the world we belong

Where the headless ride
And the autumn world has sunken into twilight
You feel safe
You feel like home

[Chorus]

Far away from shallow minds
It's not too late to see the signs
The day will come when you return to the obscure
