There comes the princess on a ride
Her haughtiness, so cold and bright
A pleading voice calls from the side
To giant's daughter no delight

[Bridge:]
Her time will come
Her final doomsday

[Chorus:]
There's a shadow in her eyes
A token of her wicked ways
Her cold heart so hate-scarred
May the curse fulfill so flesh and blood and bone
Will turn to stone

A marble palace all in white
Dominate the mountainside
These riches fill her with delight
Deep in her soul, eternal night

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Filth on the marble tiles caused a rage
That was leading just straight to her end
Her little son strolled the woods, so it reads
To clean him with bread was the last of her deeds

[Chorus 2x]

Her time has been fading, her final doomsday's waiting
Her cold heart so hate-scarred
And her world falling down apart
