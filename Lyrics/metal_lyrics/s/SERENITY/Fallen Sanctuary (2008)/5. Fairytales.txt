Here I stand now alone to die
The empty space, no word from you
I cry
After all still loving you
Can't stop feeling this way
Sadness is a friend now
Dry my tears away

[Bridge:]
I'm not the man I used to be, I can't laugh anymore
My mind is dark, my blood is cold and lonely I will go

[Chorus:]
I don't believe in fairytales
After you anymore
See you standing with another man
I feel like never before
I don't believe in fairytales
Try to stop the darkfall
Fade away with an empty soul
The darkness I will call

[Schleret]
Please forgive what I've done to you
All my words so hard to say, I'm blue
Tried to find another way than losing the best man
But love is incalculable when there's no time to wait

[Bridge and chorus]
