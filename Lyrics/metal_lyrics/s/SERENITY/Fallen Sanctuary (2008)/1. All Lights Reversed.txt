[The Prisoner:]
At the edge of nowhere
I cannot sense a move in time anymore
This device I'm caught in
Holds the venom I'm waiting for
I'm all alone
And all is gone I ever lived for
What is left are memories
And they'll become a legacy

On these prison walls resound the voices in my head
Desperate voices crying my love is dead
Knowing her I realized what I was living for
I should have saved you, now I'm broken to the core

[Chorus:]
Darkness and coldness, all have passed living her way
Facing all fearless this blindness that leads us astray

I saw her wounds, I felt the pain that she was going through
I was right there but there was nothing I could do
They had their games
She died in flames
My world was dying deep into...

[Chorus]

[The Choir of Souls:]
She made us be
Made us see
A higher empathy
We are one
We are free
The cross is history

[Chorus 2x]
