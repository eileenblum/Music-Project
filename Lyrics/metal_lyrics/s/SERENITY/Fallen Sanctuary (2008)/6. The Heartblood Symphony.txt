I was always proud of being a part of you
My life in your house always seemed to good to be true
Your trust in me I paid it back with my loyalty
To die in your name has been the fate that waited for me

[Bridge:]
Here in a second life I am your servant (again)
I've sworn allegiance but I won't close my eyes

[Chorus:]
Give me a reason for ending my treason
I fear it's too late, games you have played leaving a bleeding heart
I long for the old times, I'm sick of your false rhymes
Turning the world to something never meant to be

I remember the very first day wearing your sign
The falcon eyes, the wings of red felt right to be mine

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

You were so close to me just like a family I never had
The brave lost in the past, the one I love obsessed
And there's no way to cure her twisted mind
...I still can't believe what you have done to me

[Chorus]
