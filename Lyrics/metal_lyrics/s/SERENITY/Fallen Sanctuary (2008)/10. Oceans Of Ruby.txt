We are the gods that you create
We're unifying love and hate
Your belief is tied to our existence
Still you can't see
How you disdain humanity
Devouring crimes to us, divine

[Chorus:]
Oceans of ruby
We never cried for pain
Lost in the dark sea
You sadly died in vain

How come you kill in our names
And drown your enemies in flames
Expecting great reward for this madness
Your life to come
No afterworld foreseen by some
Your paradise illusive lies

[Chorus x2]
