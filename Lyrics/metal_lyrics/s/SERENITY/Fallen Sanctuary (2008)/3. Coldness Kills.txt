Where have you been when the frost came in
Where did you spend your days in fading light
Where colors turn to grey in grey
Alone I roam these frozen lands
I fear your track is covered under snow
Your signs of life all lost and gone

[Chorus:]
Winter has come with mourning
Promised by fall one day
This coldness kills the flame inside
Life it ends in white

The sky is grey and northwinds blow
Sunlight hides behind a veil
That somehow blurs my sight, how can I ever find you?
Snowflakes like needles on my face
Pray for the wolves to go on their own ways
At least for one last time
Last time

[x2]
Winter has come with mourning
Promised by fall one day
This coldness kills the flame inside
And all is white

[Chorus 2x]

...This coldness kills what you could save
But you are all too far away
