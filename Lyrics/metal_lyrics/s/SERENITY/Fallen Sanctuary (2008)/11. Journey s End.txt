[Bonus track]

The wind is blowing fast, straight in his face
Another sunset has passed
The beauty of the sea, A spell to his mind
But deep inside he feels doubt

[Bridge:]
How many miles to go finding his dreams
How many years so slowly passed away
His will unbreakable. it keeps him alive
And always he screams

[Chorus:]
Nothing can stop my way
I'm gonna sail on till my very last day
Nothing, when God is my friend
I will finish my quest to the journey's end

To sail a unique ride to conquer the sea
Is the sailorman's pride
Shall his name live on?
His wish for immortality is strong
But often paid with death

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
