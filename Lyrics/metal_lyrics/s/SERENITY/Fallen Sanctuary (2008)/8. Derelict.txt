Oh mother sure it makes you cry
To see your only son like this
...Wherever you may be these days

It has been a year now that I can find no sleep
No matter what I try I fail
So I can see precisely how my body fades away
A skeleton to anyone, a symbol of decay

[Chorus:]
I live in hell
There's no other words for this place
I cannot tell
What turned my life into this maze - I'm left alone
On the whole
A derelict is what I am
A fallen soul
A wandering shadow of a man losing his mind

The ones who are against me fear them all around
What have I done what is their plan
Is it just paranoia, I don't know what's going on
A victim of conspiracy or haunted by a phantom?

[Chorus]
