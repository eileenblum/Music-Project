I wake you softly
Deep in your dreams lying here alone
Waiting for another day
Here I go now
Just find my choice in every word you say
Following the game we play

Time stands still when you touch my face again
The broken clouds become complete
(We will meet again)

Not only the image has remained, It's carved within my soul
There's a fire in you that glows just somewhere in the dark
A guiding light that will not cease until my dying day
A living shadow with your face engraved in lines of light

Through times you had been
Nothing less that the sense of life to me
And some things never change
Still you are here
From somewhere deep inside you speak to me
Using words that tear my heart

Time stands still when you touch my face again
The broken clouds become complete
(We will meet again)

Not only the image has remained, It's carved within my soul
There's a fire in you that glows just somewhere in the dark
A guiding light that will not cease until my dying day
A living shadow with your face engraved in lines of light
