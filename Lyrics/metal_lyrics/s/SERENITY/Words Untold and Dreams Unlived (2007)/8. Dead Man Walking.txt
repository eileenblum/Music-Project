Good morning friend, today is the day
A sleepless night is over now
The tower bells toll majestically
Strangle my fear, cold hands on my neck

Time's running out, it's all in vain
I can feel the pain

Here is the day I'll end
Blood is still on my hand
Remains from the shades of the past
God doesn't see me now
You cannot take this vow
There's only one thing I request
Walk my last way to its bitter end
Help me to die

I raise my head towards the threatened sky
Thank you my friend, my companion in life
I'm caught between hope and despair
I think today is a good day to die

Time's running out, it's all in vain
Think I go insane

Here is the day I'll end
Blood is still on my hand
Remains from the shades of the past
God doesn't see me now
You cannot take this vow
There's only one thing I request
Walk my last way to its bitter end
Help me to die

Now it's over, now it's done
No chance to repent all my lies
In my memories I can see the signs
The sign of pain and agony
The sign of might and glory

Time's running out, it's all in vain
Think I go insane

Here is the day I'll end
Blood is still on my hand
Remains from the shades of the past
God doesn't see me now
You cannot take this vow
There's only one thing I request
Walk my last way to its bitter end
Help me to die
