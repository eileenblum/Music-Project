I sit here all alone, watch the sun go down, leaving fiery ranges
My soul is set aflame, the daily fight is on, still pain ain't gone

A thriving land is what I see
No virgin wilderness could be
A home to us, some fertile ground is all we're asking for
We give our pain, twice our blood
One with the soil, one with the gods
Strongest faith is needed here, so fail the weak

Work to live. Another tear, another bleeding
Every day another price to pay. I pay and bleed
Therefore I consider leaving. But this land forces me to stay
Creating

The land has changed, the tribe has too
It's new gained wealth means loss of faith
That formed life, that was a guide to generations
Although the mountains still stand strong
The threat is here, it's been too long
We haven't thought this land could wither, could wither slowly

Work to live. Another tear, another bleeding
Every day another price to pay. I pay and bleed
Therefore I consider leaving. But this land forces me to stay
Creating

Creating thriven land
Nothing will be the same, can we rebuild this land again
Creating thriven land
Shining like a star, shining bright so far...

Work to live.
Another tear, another bleeding Every day another price to pay.
I pay and bleed. Therefore I consider leaving.
But this land forces me to stay. Infinite greed
Another heart, a different beating. That left the anguish of the past behind
Beloved lands. Now upon them vultures feeding
Not even one worth to be elder's heir
Creating
