Leave me alone, I won't give your any answers
Your poisoned words will not serve you anyway
Know this well, a twisted soul without a shelter
Is about to fail with a body only borrowed

Ways to go I know you'll never find
A heart that beats for me alone
My empty space a target for your lies
A part of me that slowly dies

Pain in my head, cut it out, I cannot stand it
Just take my blood, wash it clean, is this the cure
There's no blade that reaches deep enough
And my sanity just remains an illusion

Ways to go I know you'll never find
A heart that beats for me alone
My empty space a target for your lies
A part of me that slowly dies

What are the reasons for these unfair awful words you say to me
I'm nothing evil, I'm the helpful counter current in your veins
(United both in flesh and veins)
So many skills that you were gifted
Would they be yours without my command
I know, therefore I want you to go...
You will not stop me to flow

Ways to go I know you'll never find
A heart that beats for me alone
My empty space a target for your lies
A part of me that slowly dies
