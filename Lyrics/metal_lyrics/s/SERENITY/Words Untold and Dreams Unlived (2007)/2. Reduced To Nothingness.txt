I've just found my Tanelorn
My task is done, my quest complete
But some things seem strange, unreal
Dearest wish and clearest vision
Form the sea I navigate
I shun the cliffs of consciousness

In the deep where fire leaps up to become the shape of all that you fear
Know the gate to glorious fates never seen in this life.
So I fall...

...in other worlds on deeper plains
I'm coming through again
Forlorn in the never
When I rise (to awake)
And regain consciousness
Then all is reduced to nothingness

There are times I can't believe
I crossed the line because I see
These dreams of despair they are real

In the deep where fire leaps up to become the shape of all that you fear
Know the gate to glorious fates never seen in this life.
So I fall...

...in other worlds on deeper plains
I'm coming through again
Forlorn in the never
When I rise (to awake)
And regain consciousness
Then all is reduced to nothingness

Caught in the gravity of the non-dreaming world
I suffer from the incapacity to create a future that never was

Someone in the multiverse is dreaming your reality
Imagine he could be the one who lives your dreams.
Connecting, interacting on the field of possibilities
Figments of the mind behold divinity.

So I fall, unknown fates I see again
