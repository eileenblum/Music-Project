Here I stand
A fallen creature all alone
Never meant to rise again
Here I stand
Scarred by iron, fang and thorn
Can't believe that I returned
From where the dark is born

I've been roaming the ages
Have seen forces collide
Have been fighting on any side I know
The turning of pages
As many times as I've changed my name
Just left anything the same

From where I come is where I go
The game of life and death will lead my way
More scars to gain, more pain to grow
And I will walk again where the dark is born

A land lying in ashes
In a battle where dark light shone
I cannot say if lost or won
Sounding like lashes
Thousand killing machines marched on
Granting mercy to no one

From where I come is where I go
The game of life and death will lead my way
More scars to gain, more pain to grow
And I will walk again where the dark is born

See the space of time
That I thought was mine
I have given birth
a self made underworld
To where I come down once again
All time I was bearing the same
There is no escape, no relief till the end

From where I come is where I go
The game of life and death will lead my way
More scars to gain, more pain to grow
And I will walk again where the dark is born

From where I come is where I go
The game of life and death will lead my way
More scars to gain, more pain to grow
And I will walk again where the dark is born
