Far away you fly
Your soul is in the sky
There's nothing left that brings you back to me
You've reached out my mind
You've lost a painful fight
Now follow him into the underworld

I'm sad and down
Tears running down my face
I miss your touch and the sweet taste of your lips

I'm waiting every day but I know you'll never come
Forever your eyes will be closed
The endless fear has gone, after darkness comes the sun
Forever salvation has come
Forever you'll be gone

Afraid to call your name
I feel an endless pain
Together we were strong and full of pride
The snow is falling down
I've lost my golden crown
My kingdom is empty, dark and cold

I'm sad and down
Tears running down my face
I miss your touch and the sweet taste of your lips

I'm waiting every day but I know you'll never come
Forever your eyes will be closed
The endless fear has gone, after darkness comes the sun
Forever salvation has come
Forever you'll be gone

Standing at your grave on a sleeping bed of roses
Waiting for a little sign
I close my eyes, remember all the feelings
That I had lying in your arms

I'm sad and down
Tears running down my face
I miss your touch and the sweet taste of your lips

I'm waiting every day but I know you'll never come
Forever your eyes will be closed
The endless fear has gone, after darkness comes the sun
Forever salvation has come
Forever you'll be gone
