You've drawn
This line
One thousand times
This foe
But we'll fall alone
We're all
On a horse
Of our own
This road is red
These hearts
Are black
This horse
We led
To thay trough
Of wealth
And we drank
Til we felled
But when we awoke
Our steed was dry
Charred and steeped
Pearled and white
But we're all...
On a horse...
Of our own
