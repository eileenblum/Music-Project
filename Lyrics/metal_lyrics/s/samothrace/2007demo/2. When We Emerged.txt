Beneath sea
Elaborate flood
Sealung
Earthen Mass
Washed 
Away

Back to the sea
To see what we missed
When we emerged
Whene we emerged

Ancient wash
Tired force
Birthed life
Welcomed death

Back to the sea
To see what we missed
When we emerged
When we emerged
Too, live
to life
to love
Again
