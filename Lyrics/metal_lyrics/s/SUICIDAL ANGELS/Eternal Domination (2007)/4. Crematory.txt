Reckless hate, now I'm on a leash
Priest think deeply what you preach
Assemble the army, damnation to death
Oceans of blood, no way to forget
All your hopes are lost in time
Now it's time to pay your crime
Dark Lord has ordered to gather his knights
To shift through the heaven and kill by the night

Violent crematory brings pleasure in my mind
The ashtrays of crucifixion go to smoke up to the sky
Voices in the room screaming out His name
An army of sacred creatures stand in front of me bringing pain

Blood of Jesus flow on earth, resurrecting the undead
On the mountain of crucifixion, the castle of religion is approaching death

Reckless hate, now I'm on a leash
The ten commandments you can't teach
Rotten smell gush from the graves
Light gradually slips away
And as the sky turns to black
Night creatures strike back
Manipulating blackened minds
Leading Hell to final fight

Violent crematory brings pleasure in my mind
The ashtrays of crucifixion go to smoke up to the sky
Voices in the room screaming out His name
An army of sacred creatures stand in front of me bringing pain
