I call upon the unholy spirit
Fire is burning, tears still fall
The sky wide open
Welcomes your soul

Hot winds are blowing
Doom is at hand
Run you filthy bastards
As Satan takes command

Fire through the sky, thunder, power shakes the earth
Shadows siege the night, ancient spirits attack
Enforced, devastating, they hide
Life, like a candle it comes to its end
Only blood satisfies my Master's will

Among the fire, enforcing the Evil, the Beast appears
Attacking with hate, forces of Darkness, show me my fate

The cross is rising, you cry like a pig
I'll burn all the fools who call you a king
I'm drinking your blood, devouring your soul
I'll offer my Master your head in a bowl

Among the fire, enforcing the Evil, the Beast appears
Attacking with hate, forces of Darkness, show me my fate

Fire through the sky, thunder, power shakes the earth
Shadows siege the night, ancient spirits attack
Enforced, devastating, they hide
Life, like a candle it comes to its end
Only blood satisfies my Master's will

Among the fire, enforcing the Evil, the Beast appears
Attacking with hate, forces of Darkness, show me my fate

Evil attack!
