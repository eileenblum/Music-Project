Assaulting your mind
Destroying your thoughts
Unable to react from
Pieces of reality

The full moon is bleeding, this is my night
That terrible screams of homicide, bring me back to life
Unholy powers arm my hand
Frozen I'm waiting the final command
My salvation Christ destruction
Just to see him on his knees
Beg for mercy on the cross
Release the power upon Christianity

Satan my master lead me to victory
Demons my warriors come with me
I command you rise from your grave
I command you rise, attack, destroy and kill

Christians sacrificed, priest crucified
Jesus stands unable to save his own sheep
No more prayers to the God, no ceremonies in the church
Only screams of death surround you
