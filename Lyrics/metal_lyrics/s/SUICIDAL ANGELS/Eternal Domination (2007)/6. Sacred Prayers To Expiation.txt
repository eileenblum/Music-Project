In battle with the force of Light
Engaging with dark pride
Eternal battle lies ahead
The church of Christ will die
Christians lead a way of life
In lies and filth and greed
Repent, believe and you'll be saved
Their god forgives the weak
You'll be tormented in fire
Until you vomit your soul
It's an inward desire
To see you writhe 'till dawn
Attack from below
Sanctity to death
Fighting for survival
Fighting 'till the end

Satan, Master, Lord of Darkness lead us to the fight
Satan, Master, Lord of Darkness kill their god tonight

Searching for the sacred prayers that lead to expiation
Sadistic powers gathering above the sacrosanct hill
Taking vengeance on the vulnerable unholy crucifixion
The graves of all these thousand years the truth only reveal
