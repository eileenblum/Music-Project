Church will be on fire, nothing will be saved
Paying respect to nothingness to Hell you'll be a slave
Praise on your knees, priest prepare to die
Praise on your knees, Hell is ready now to strike
Riders of destruction, blinded by fire
The gates of Hell are open, pleasing His desire
The days of Christianity are ending very soon
From the smoke and dust appear under the light of the moon
Ready for the battle and they have to win
Torment all the happiness the best way to kill
Revenge is now a dead-end, there is no coming back
They're waiting through the end to slaughter them at once
The sun is rising but light has been lost
The wind is confused by all disastrous thoughts
Take a last view of the sky before your head is off
They laugh at you, now where is your God?

Slaughtering Christianity, church will be on fire
Slaughtering Christianity, priest prepare to die

Church will be on fire, nothing will be saved
Paying respect to nothingness to Hell you'll be a slave
Praise on your knees, priest prepare to die
Praise on your knees, Hell is ready now to strike
Riders of destruction, blinded by fire
The gates of Hell are open, pleasing His desire
The days of Christianity are ending very soon
From the smoke and dust appear under the light of the moon
