I see the hunger in your eyes
And bloody fires burn inside
I'll quench your thirst with Christian souls
Cut off the chains and let you go
You are my hellspawn sent to kill
Devouring souls, feasting on flesh
Unleash your fury to the sheep
Show them what really lies within
No heaven waits for all their lies
No fool of old will save their lives
No resurrection from the dead
Just me and my demons to be fed

I am the son who failed to serve
I will not follow, I will lead
I'm not the sheep, I am the wolf
Your god is dead, I'll give you proof

Your firebreaths will burn the sky
Into the night my demons fly
Into the night my soldiers strike
Christians burn, we'll make them fry
We'll cut you down and eat your hearts
You'll see the truth but it's too late
You choose to serve but Hell awaits
Your life will end, you'll die in vain
I see the hunger in your eyes
And bloody fires burn inside
I'll quench your thirst with Christian souls
Cut off the chains and let you go
