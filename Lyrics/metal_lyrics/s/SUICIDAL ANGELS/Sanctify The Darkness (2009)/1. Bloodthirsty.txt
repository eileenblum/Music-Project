Religion, obedience, the meaning of their life
Many die before them, a sacrifice to lies
Enforcing a new faith, spilling tons of blood
Of all those who denied serving their false God

An atheist, a sinner, I refuse to obey
I follow my own path, I will never pray
Divinity and Trinity, what a bunch of crap
They won't stand a chance, I elude their trap

[Chorus:]
Bloodthirsty Christianity, unholy tormentor
Condemning my soul
Bloodthirsty Christianity, I stand in contempt
Bloodthirsty Christianity, I will not bend

War and blood upon me, I have come to fight
I will give them hell, I will stand in pride
Misery and apathy will come at an end
They won't last a minute, I will see them dead

[Chorus]

The slaughtering of millions, I will not forget
Heathens turn or die, what else to expect?
I will burn your bloody Cross, I will never fall
I'll defend my freedom, I am standing tall

[Chorus]
