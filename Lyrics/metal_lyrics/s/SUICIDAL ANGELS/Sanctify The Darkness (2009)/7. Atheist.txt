Feel the atrocity, human decay
Religious damnation for all those who stray
Time to stand up, we'll set our mark
To lead a free life, we will attack

We rise against demons, we rise against God
There's nothing beyond us, it's only just us
We fight for our right to live without lies
We curse all the priests who play with our lives

[Chorus:]
Destroy your religion
Decide your own fate
United we are
To show them our hate

Feel the atrocity, human decay
Religious damnation for all those who stray
Time to stand up, we'll set our mark
To lead a free life, we will attack

[Chorus:]
Destroy your religion
Decide your own fate
United we are
To show them our hate
Nothing will break us
We will stand fast
The end of oppression
We're free at last
