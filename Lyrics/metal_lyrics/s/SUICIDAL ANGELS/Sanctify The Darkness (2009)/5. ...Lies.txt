Human weakness is divulged by the Gods that we create
Alters, churches, icons only aim to desecrate
Incarnate the Evil in the pleasures of flesh
To the virginity of Mary shall everybody pledge?

[Chorus:]
Jesus lies, Blood Religion of the past
Jesus lies, false impressions, they won't last

Silent prays and crying, when you lose all of your hopes
Faithful filthy servants offer you the rope
Listen to me bastard dogs, will you ever see the light?
Time has come for us, time to praise the Night
Your foolish words are empty, they're disgusting dust
Hopeless rotten victims to the altar of Lust

[Chorus]

Confession's entertainment, glad to relieve your pain?
Preachers gossiping your life, amusement's what they gain
You'll see there is no Heaven, you'll see there is no God
No hope for resurrection, Christianity is a fraud

[Chorus]
