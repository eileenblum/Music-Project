Shifting the Balance of Power
I am denying control
Fighting against their brutality
Fear is their weapon no more

[Bridge:]
I, your slave no more will I be
(I), my instincts and power are free
(I), denying your God and your lies
(I), beware when you look in my eyes

Controlling the masses forever
Refusing the freedom of will
Gathering flocks into Churches
Humans are turned into sheep

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Rise of the power of mind
No longer directed by Church
No longer restrained by your evil
I'm free and I spit in your face!

Frozen Souls
A relic of the years of permanent decay
All these lies condemned your life
Refuse to be a puppet in their play

[Chorus]
