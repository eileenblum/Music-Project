Your god is dead
Living condemned
Awaken to a life of shame
Chaos distrust
Torture and lust
Looks like a principle of game
Humiliation
Mortification
Corrupting every sign of life
They all were wrong
Wont come along
No one around when being thrown

Infants will die
Crucified
Following the bastard son
A sacrifice
To filthy lies
Future seems to be gone

[Chorus]

A guillotine
Under your skin
Chopping your veins in half
No life you own
Just serve the throne
Begging the air to gasp
Truth is revealed
Fate is sealed
Ending seems not to be far
You'll die despised
And brutalized
Your fathers left you alone 

[Chorus]
