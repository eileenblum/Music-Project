Sacred whispers of the praise
Echoes in my head
To arm my hand and kill at onceÂ 
Lead you to your grave
Blood is flowing in my mind
Reveal my evil side
Stick the needle in my vein
You'll find genocide

Bloodbath

BloodbathÂ 
Uncontrolled desire
Fall into eternal black
I walk the path of fire
Hypocrites betrayers
Laughing when I fall
I'll get you down in hell with me
Obey the final call
Hypnotized
Necrotized
Only living sign the movement of your eyes
Dead,you're feeling dead
You're sleeping dead
You're dead before you realizeÂ 

Bloodbath

Forced violated
Sodomized parts
Of just an empty corpse
No reason to be
SatisfiedÂ 
When blood is coming out in drops
Savage execution
Torture every captive
To beg for his reprieve
Vital organs floating
A lake of remnant blood
Thy servants need to feed

Until you die
