Don't you think you're gone see the devil in me
I don't want you to die
I want the pleasure for me to keep
Lead you to the other side
Taste the hate, live it as form of healing
The curse is burning inside
Siphon your breath to me as the final curtain falls
Destroyed hopeless leaving the world behind

[Chorus:]
Chaos,deserted people you follow blind
Chaos,of what's inside your mind

Vanquished meekly disciples you will turn to me
I am all what you want
Force fed prophecies I offer what you want to be
Worship the fallen one

[Chorus]

Close your eyes and dream a life you never had
Domination on the weak
Feeble destitute now beg for a piece of mercy
Beg for your life to keep
Taste the hate, live it as form of healing
The curse is burning inside
Siphon your breath to me as the final curtain falls
Destroyed hopeless leaving the world behind
