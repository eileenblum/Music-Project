[performed with Karl Willetts]Human demise
World in disaster
Rampage is taking control
Grown in to illusion
Of truth and devotion
Endlessly seeking to conquer all
The heavens are burning
Angels are falling
Reign in terror prevailed
What was expected
What was created
Falls in to pieces unvieled

Legacy of pain

The face of evil
Sarcastic submission
Unmasked in the book of lies
Blood on the earth
Irrigate infants
They're coming to terrorize
Sin after sin
Steps to damnation
Living a life in chains
Generate fear
Ending is near
Salvation is given to slaves

Legacy of pain

Ruins disaster
Lives burnt faster
Murders commited an altar of death
Oppression destruction
There is no reaction
Powerless even to take a breath
Truth agains lies
Black against white
Creation ensalved
A heritage slay

Legacy of pain
