Chaos destruction
Violent attraction
The battlefield is being prepared
Sweat mixed with blood
Savage attack
Your life is what you should care
Drum kit is beating
Killer in rythm
Cannons of fire in command
Forced in the pit
Noses will bleed
Going around and round till you're done

[Chorus]

Determination needed to pass it through
Jumping in the pit with the moshing crew

it starts like a drop
Portending the storm
Coming after a while
Mud in the air
You're feeling despair
All they are crazy and wild
Moshing like a maniac
Acting like a beast
Legions of thrashers attack
No way to stop them
Forbid or to force them
Even if the run otu of blood

[Chorus]

Chaos destruction
Violent attraction
The battlefield is being prepared
Sweat mixed with blood
Savage attack
Your life is what you should care
None can defy
Just try to survive
The crew will be bringing the fear
Take it or leave it
No time for retrieving
You need a hospital near

[Chorus]
