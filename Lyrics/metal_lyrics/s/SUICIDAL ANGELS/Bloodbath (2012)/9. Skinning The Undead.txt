Darkness fallen upon the earth
One more frightful night
No time to face reality
Illusions feel your sight
Deep inside your fears alive
Evil creates its form
Shadows hidden in your mind
You wish you're never born

Your life now seems meaningless
Soon you'll follow me 
Immersing in my darkest hopes
You;ll see divinity
Never will you see the light
Reveal your inner self
Sarcastic faces smiling while...

Skinning the undead

Come on priest and join them
There's pleasure in their pain
Pick up the knife and feel the blood
To cleanse your holy brain
They are so weak and fearful
Stagnant floating remnants
Now taste the holy blood

Your life now seems meaningless
Soon you'll follow me
Immersing in my darkest hopes
You'll see divinity 
Never will you see the light
Reveal your inner self
Sarcastic faces smiling while...
Skinning the undead
