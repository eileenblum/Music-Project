I see the world,it goes insane
Nothing's like before
The speech of truth falls apart
Violence I seek it more
There's no escape,there's no return
For victims caught in my rage
White turns to black light turns to dark
Benn sacrified in flames

[Chorus:]
Insanity serenity the scales of mind deaden
Bodily sedated shifting in to heaven
Feel the claws like burning blade to tear your flesh apart
Savagely your soul is raped before you spit your blood

Insanity serenity the scales of mind deaden
Bodily sedated shifting in to heaven
Feel the claws like burning blade to tear your flesh apart
Spit the face of God

Spit the face of God
The face of God
You'll lose your spine,passively
Where can you turn to now
You have no grip,mind slips
To which filthy god you bow
Invited to a set up game
Cold murder kids to die
One by one my enemies
Will face the coldest eyes

[Chorus]

Slavery,injustice,a role forced to play
Since the day you're born,in chains you live,the sins you have to pay
Peace and light,promised lies,adorn the steps you make
No promised land,a fallen lad,to deal with idols fake

[Chorus]
