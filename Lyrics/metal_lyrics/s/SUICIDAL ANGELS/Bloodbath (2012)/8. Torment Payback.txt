Sodomized you die
Filthy scum of earth
The light now fades
The felon cimes to birth
Manslaughter on reprisal
Deviating from the will of God
Hading in the Vatican
Protection of the holy word

Torment Payback

Torment is gonna be the payback
For the non believers
Blood is the priceless awars
For followers deceivers

Submission in disguise
A creature lives in curse
Converts in formss of evil
A life exposed in burst
A soulless piece of flesh
A beast that grows around you
To live of what you bless

[Chorus]
