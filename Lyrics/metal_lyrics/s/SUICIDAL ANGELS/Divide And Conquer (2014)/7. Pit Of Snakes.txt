Massive mentally infection
Poverty your life is gone
Semi humans infiltration
Opressed to feed the spawn

[bridge:]
A formless piece of life is born
Another piece of heven torn
Residues of the war were fake
In Pit of snakes

Destructive sorrowful damnation
Down into the pits of hell
No more lies to spread salvation
Inside your head the division bell
[bridge:]
A formless piece of life is born
Another piece of heven torn
Residues of the war were fake
In Pit of snakes

[chorus:]
In the Pit of Snakes

Intoxicated
A poisoned soul
One more step closer to the maker
Powerless on the ground you crawl
Intoxicated
A poisoned soul
Like acid burning my eyes
My hatred falls upon you all
[bridge:]
A formless piece of life is born
Another piece of heven torn
Residues of the war were fake
In Pit of snakes

[chorus:]
In the Pit of Snakes

Now you serve me motherfucker die
Falling on your knees tears fill your eyes
Now please me stupid useless dog
I'm holding the heads and the lives of your sons
You're sinners motherfuckers die
I am the one who commands your lives
I'm coming back for revenge
You'll see your infants thrown off the edge

[chorus:]
In the Pit of Snakes
