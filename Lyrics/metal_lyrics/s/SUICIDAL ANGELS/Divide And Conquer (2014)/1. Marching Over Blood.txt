A faceless creature comes to life
A spawn diseased by hate
Never faced or seen the light
Controlled by inner strength
What if you fall or rise again
Disfigured nightmare starts
To drive you through the steps of death
Before your eyes shut

[Chorus:]
I am marching over Blood

Trapped in the walls of suicide
There's no way to retreat
There's no way to change your life
Your freedom now submit
Over your blood I make my stand
I march before your death
I'm feeding on the aftermath
I'm living of your breath

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Marching over blood
I spit disease to the face of God
Marching over blood
Tear of your limps your time has come
Marching over blood
Before your eyes they rape your sons
Marching over blood
I spit disease to the face of God

Death's head is your destiny
Ferocity disguised
Somber, still and utterly
Pain drawn in through your eyes
What if you fall or rise again
Disfigured nightmare starts
To drive you through the steps of death
Before your eyes shut
