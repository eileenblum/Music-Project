A life spent in emptiness
Born to be a servant
Overwhelmed by senseless action
Crawling as a serpent
Living on regression
Born to be a slave
What can you do so to survive
Against a time of hate

[chorus:]
Seeking for your dignity
Absence from reality
A quest through your insanity
What I call reality
Fragments of lost dignity
Diversion of insanity

A faithful sequent of  the mass
Half of personality
Try to fill in the gaps
A quest for your reality
In need of something to believe
Which never has been yours
Never seek a reason
Motivation or a cause

[chorus:]
Seeking for your dignity
Absence from reality
A quest through your insanity
What I call reality
Fragments of lost dignity
Diversion of insanity

To live a life through false impression
You wished something to be
A permanent corruption
Your soul to set it free
To live a life through strangers eyes
Switching from as snake skin
Nothing more or nothing less
An empty person you sre within

[chorus:]
Seeking for your dignity
Absence from reality
A quest through your insanity
What I call reality
Fragments of lost dignity
Diversion of insanity
