Beg for your life
Infest sacrifice
Salvation is done
Kneel to gun

Substitude of human nature
I detest your stench of lies
Inbred swine you sting distrust
I send you dog in the afterlife

[chorus:]
Beg for your life
Infest sacrifice
Salavationm is done

Ultimate pretension
Permanent infection
You will be covered in blood
Kneel to the gun

My storm of hate upon you
This is your time of praise
My time of lust my time of payback
Here's the end there's no disgrace

[chorus:]
Beg for your life
Infest sacrifice
Salavationm is done

[bridge:]
Fold I mold I become a curse
Nightmare living blood on your chest
I find no reason for your offensive birth
There's no meaning to walk the face of earth

I breathe I siege I'm spreading disease
What's the meaning behind all these
Pressure is rising pumping your veins
Show some mercy I want you to say

[chorus:]
Beg for your life
Infest sacrifice
Salavationm is done
