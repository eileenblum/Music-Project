Across the borders of an empty life
You met the bottom line
Dive into obedience it's not controlled by mind
Sleepless nights and days of fear
An endless fire burns
Through a disguise of happiness
The end now makes sense

Down on the floor, right on the wall
even beneath the ground
Attempt to hide from all the pain
silence sounds so loud
Blurry brain and empty eyes
nothing can be clear
You hear the voice inside your soul
Welcome, he's near

[chorus:]
The White Wizzard
Beware the White Wizzard

Living in the truth of lies,
no walls to keep you in
Prison is the mind, slowly demised,
temptation and desire freak within
Watching life passing by,
like trapped inside a trench
Bombs of habit, blow inner self, racing against

[chorus:]
The White Wizzard
Beware the White Wizzard

High hopes, no return, this is a bitter end
Relentless, irrelevant, pain when you lay bend
A week of shadows, a shdowed day,
climbing on a thread
Coming back, nightmare ends, despise the undead

Back and forth from illusion to reality
Can't define any pieces of mortality
No more hope, no more dope to face the seeds of death
Light fades, life shades behold your final breath

[chorus:]
The White Wizzard
Beware the White Wizzard
