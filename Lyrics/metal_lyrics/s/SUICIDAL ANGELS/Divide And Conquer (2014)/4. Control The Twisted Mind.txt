Servant of two masters
A life split in half
Confusion comes out of the eyes of weakness
Etched to my face\A smile turns to evil
Consuming air till all is black

[chorus:]
Sleeping in illusion
Unable to react
There's no way to control
The twisted mind

Swallowed deep in to disaster
A brain torn apart
Force of sanity drilled out of blood
What is this place
Life of derange
Inoculating an evil command

[chorus:]
Sleeping in illusion
Unable to react
There's no way to control
The twisted mind

Mind fracturing collision
Nothing but cold black
Do I really live or I collapse
Before the dawn
One life is gone
Some more to go
so face the facts

[chorus:]
Sleeping in illusion
Unable to react
There's no way to control
The twisted mind
