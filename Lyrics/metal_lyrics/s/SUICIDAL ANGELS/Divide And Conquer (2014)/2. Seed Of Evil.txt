Insane
I hold your freedom tightly in chains
I cannot hear what you're saying
It's not a dream it's true
What's left that you can do 
Now bow
I want to see your head down on the ground
I want to hear you screaming out loud
Is this the end or not
The sound of the last shot

[chorus:]
Terror through my veins
Before creation now you shiver
What I am what I become
I am the seed of evil

I'm dead
I'm coming every dawn above your bed
And spreading the disease into your brain
Every second seems to be your last
Insanity grows fast
What's real
What can you feel
Can you believe
The hell that you are living in

[chorus:]
Terror through my veins
Before creation now you shiver
What I am what I become
I am the seed of evil

I'll be looking at you 
when you're laid on the ground
And as the 12 blows will be crashing down on your limps
I will climb up through your blood and sit beside you
I will look deep into your eyes and drop by drop
I will trickle my disgust into them like burning acid until finally you perish

[chorus:]
Terror through my veins
Before creation now you shiver
What I am what I become
I am the seed of evil
