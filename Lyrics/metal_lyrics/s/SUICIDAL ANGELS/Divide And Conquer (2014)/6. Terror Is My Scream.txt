Bodies lay on the ground
Sign of life cannot be found
Chopping heads the blood to flow
Hatred slowly starts to grow

[chorus:]
Die
Enemy in sight
Violence unseen
Terror is my scream

Born again in time of horror
Total luck of human sorrow
It seems that I was here before
To declare one more fatal war

[chorus:]
Die
Enemy in sight
Violence unseen
Terror is my scream

What is left of evil to resemble
Hate and fury to assemble
Erupting like a thunderstorm
upon the recent victims
Condemned you are, now start to shake,
abandon hope and living

[chorus:]
Die
Enemy in sight
Violence unseen
Terror is my scream
