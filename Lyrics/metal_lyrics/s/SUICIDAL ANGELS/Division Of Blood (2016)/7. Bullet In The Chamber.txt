Life denied
A great fall from the sky
Don't despise the life itself
Decapitated broken hopes arise
To feed the power of the beast

Bullet in the chamber

Don't you speak, just spit a word
Don't deny you're from this world
Don't fool me, play with my mind
I see you drowning in your own lies

The blackest rise
Of sun in to the blood
Leads the way into eternity
It's coming back
This sound of evil crawl
Distant echoes of divinity

Bullet in the chamber

Don't you speak, just spit a word
Don't deny you're from this world
Don't fool me, play with my mind
I see you drowning in your own lies

[Solo]

Pull the trigger, don't you hesitate it's lies
Fear of the sinner, look at me straight in to my eyes

[Solo]

Pull the trigger, don't you hesitate it's lies
Pull the trigger, look at me straight in to my eyes
Pull the trigger, the patch you choice is black to death
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger

Bullet in the chamber
