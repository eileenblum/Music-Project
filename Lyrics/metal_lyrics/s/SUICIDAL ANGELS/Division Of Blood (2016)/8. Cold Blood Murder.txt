Moral compass of control
There is no need to struggle
It doesn't lead to anywhere
It's time for you to suffer
I push the needle
Deep it goes
Liquid starts to flow
Cant control the dizziness
The last act of the show

The world of lies, the face of death
The world of lies, I need your flesh
The world of lies, your soul is mine
The world of lies, I am cursed divine

Cold blood murder

Coming back to rip your life
Sharpened blade mirrors your eyes
It's something that you need to see
Killing is my destiny

The world of lies, the face of death
The world of lies, I need your flesh
The world of lies, your soul is mine
The world of lies, I am cursed divine

Cold blood murder

Take 'em all! [4x]

[Solo]

It's burning as the fire
Hellish cross denial
He rises from the ashes
This is the great return

The world of lies, the face of death
The world of lies, I need your flesh
The world of lies, your soul is mine
The world of lies, I am cursed divine

Cold blood murder
