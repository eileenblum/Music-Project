Invasion from the air, striking from below
The orders strict beyond the realm
No prisoners to hold, blood is running cold
Attack into the night and dread the fear

We come as fire raging, deprive the right of aging
Children taken slaves to serve until their death
The youngest breaths enslaved, mothers' cry embrace
This is my welcome to the capital of war

Capital of war

Repeated waves of fire, unleashed before the dawn
Pushing in the frontline to withdraw
To hold it strong and safe and change your life's fate
Blood is to be spilled, don't play the shortest straw

Kill â the only word to hear,
Not a single step to take a breath
Back into the holes, do you life after all?
This is my welcome to the capital of war

Capital of war â machine gun fire raging
Capital of war â bring the eternal fire
Capital of war â welcome to the nightmare

Fire! [4x]

Jumping in the fire before the morning sun awakes
Rushing into blood and tears of shame
No turning back, or fall against the enemy
I save a bullet with your name

Fire!

The smell of death embraces your body as you turn to sleep
Frozen to the bone and sick
One more day â one more strike
Heading to the light of the eternity

Fire! [4x]
Welcome to the nightmare [3x]
Nightmare (nightmare)

Repeated waves of fire, unleashed before the dawn
Pushing in the frontline to withdraw
To hold it strong and safe and change your life's fate
Blood is to be spilled, don't play the shortest straw

Kill â unleashing the attack
Once you get into their way there is no turning back
The spit of wrath unknown â is this part of the game?
How can this be reality â slavery and shame!

Capital of war
Capital of war â machine gun fire raging
Capital of war â bring the eternal fire
Capital of war
