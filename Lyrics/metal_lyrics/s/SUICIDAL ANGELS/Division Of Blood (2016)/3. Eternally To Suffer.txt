Possessing nightmares
To feed the sickest dawn
The blackened holes of sickness
The raise up to the throne
What's left in to your brain
Is there a tomb to praise
A left forgotten idol
A last call scream to hail

Hail hail now be prepared to die

Chocked to the death
Eternally to suffer

Behold the glory of heavens
Behold the glorious light
Now watch your infants helpless
To fall under the knife
Walk among the trees of death
Your soul prepared to sail
A left forgotten idol
A last call scream to hail

Hail hail now be prepared to die

Chocked to the death
Eternally to suffer

Kneel before the sacred nation
Take your vows to loyal serve
Break the seals or face damnation
Live a life chocked to the death
Thrown in to the wolves, broken all the rules
This is the truth revealed, it's obvious you fool
This is the time now, don't you praise for after

Eternally to suffer
Be prepared to die
