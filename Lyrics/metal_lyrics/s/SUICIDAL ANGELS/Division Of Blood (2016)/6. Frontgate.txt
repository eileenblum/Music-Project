There's no regret
There is no fear
Walking through the valley of death
There is no space
For sympathy or tears
We are standing, we are marching
Till there is no breath
What's coming next
Waiting for the next wave
Damned condemned and the cursed
Will be the ones in our way
Prepare your fate
To meet your end
The laugh of the immortals
Will follow you stray

The last stand
Now meet your fate
The final fight
Onward to the front gate

Blood, is watering the heavens
Giving birth to flowers of immortality
The hell below, laughing on the sight
To your infant's head as it is free

The last stand
Now meet your fate
The final fight
Onward to the front gate [2x]

[Solo]

The last stand
Now meet your fate
The final fight
Onward to the front gate [2x]

Fires to the front gate
Onward to the front gate
