Eternal sentence in torture
Guarded by vulture
An unexpected nightmare as the mask of death is closing
A fire upon you
To cleanse the souls of sorrow
Faceless servants feed the bleeding in

Repent believe or die
Of thy shall bring the light

Behind the lies of the white preach
I see a black beast
An uncontrolled desire to control or kill
You follow the crown
I see you kneel down
Rage will be storming above you clowns

Repent believe or die
Of thy shall bring the light [2x]

Attack in the night
As flash of the light
Evil is rising in front of your sight
Abandon your life
A senseless fight
Of thy shall bring the light

[Solo]

Eternal sentence in torture
Guarded by vulture
An unexpected nightmare as the mask of death is closing
A fire upon you
To cleanse the souls of sorrow
Faceless servants feed the bleeding in

Repent believe or die
Of thy shall bring the light
