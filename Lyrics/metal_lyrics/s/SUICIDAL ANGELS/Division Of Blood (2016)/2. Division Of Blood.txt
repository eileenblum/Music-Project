Mother war is feeding me
Once again to survive
Throw down your guns, lay down your souls
What keeps you think you'll be alive
Do you believe your precious god
Will save you from the fire
I set the rules, you play the game
You little kid, you filthy liar

Death, fire, we are the division of blood
Death, delivering fire, we are the division of blood

I'm born and raised in the shadow dust
Let's play the seek and hide
I follow back your lithium smell
Dizzy brain can't hold it tight
You still believe your stupid god
Is here to save your life
I tell you a secret you're all alone
Kneel down you dog, I'm cursed divine

Death, fire, we are the division of blood
Death, delivering fire, we are the division of blood

Under blackened god
Division of blood
Raise the flag
Division of blood

[Solo]

Father god forgive me please
When death comes to me ripping
Can't stand this fight, no more this hell
To hear the clock that's ticking
Before the time has come to say
The last words of my prayers
Raise me in to the hands of doom
Relief me of the betrayers

Death, fire, we are the division of blood
Death, delivering fire, we are the division of blood

Under blackened god
Division of blood
Raise the flag
Division of blood
