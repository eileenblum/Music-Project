Join the forces to clear the path
One is the way no side loss just wrath
Enough all of them acting as mastera
Enough all of them performing disasters
We came here to make the first step
Take some heads machine to be fed

Smells like death
Set the cities on fire
This rotten breath
Set the cities on fire

Keep flames burning, until nothing's left
Victims to follow, survivors last breath
Brighten the night with souls damned to burn
The ashes of flesh, the ashes of shame
The ashes will be, the seed of new life
Fuck them, kill them, bury 'em inside
The signs of vengeance will rise again
The banners of hatred, the new flag of earth.

Smells like death
Set the cities on fire
This rotten breath
Set the cities on fire

Set the cities on fire

We will be rising on the first light's dawn
We will be heading to new life's morn
Nothing will be here chained to the past
Just smell of burned skin when everything's shut
Fuck them, kill them, bury 'em inside
The ashes will be the seed of new life
Getting a meaning in life is not to late
Burning the masters burning the slaves
