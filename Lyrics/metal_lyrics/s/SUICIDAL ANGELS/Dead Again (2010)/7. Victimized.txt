No god no words to say
Slavery and mind's decay
No more of false messiah
Replica of human's weakness shaped into fire
Mystic reasons attributed
To the prayers of lust
Silently increasing reverence
Sacred moment of the mass

Servants on your knees
Victimized
My inner wish to please
Victimized
On your skin my blade you feel
Victimized
Perpetual attempt to kill
Victimized

Host and chalice being shown
Proclaiming flesh and blood
Devoted faithful you will die
Despise the throne of god
Deign to look propitious
Serene and full of peace
A holy sacrifice
A spotless high priest

Servants on your knees
Victimized
My inner wish to please
Victimized
On your skin my blade you feel
Victimized
Perpetual attempt to kill
Victimized

Turn the page and face the truth
The fears you keep inside
So many years of nothingness
Of where to stand aside
You are a slave a filthy dog
You never act on will
Hatred growing day by day
Is not enough to feel

Maybe filled with every grace
Heaven's blessing and desire
But looking so pathetic
Your spirit growing higher

Servants on your knees
Victimized
My inner wish to please
Victimized
On your skin my blade you feel
Victimized
Perpetual attempt to kill
Victimized
