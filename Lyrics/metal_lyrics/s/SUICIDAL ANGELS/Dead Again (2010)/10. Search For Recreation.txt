Bloodless dissection
A life that was never meant to be
Certain death
Reality is just a distant memory
Saints of evil
A family of rats
To lead you through the life
Now pay the price
The future in the promised land
Is just a fading light

Dominate all corrupted sons
Eternal fire reaching out the dawn
No salvation souls submit
Master of illusion, fire, blood, disease

Come to life
Once you're born you will become
What you are my slave
Eyes shut
Obey the commandments
Or rot inside your grave
Heavenly betrayed
Faith and devotion
Transformed in apathy
The holy cross
A piece of wood on fire
To warm reality

Dominate all corrupted sons
Eternal fire reaching out the dawn
No salvation souls submit
Master of illusion, fire, blood, disease

Crushed one after another
Fiercely mutilated
Skeletal remains
Behind the holy blood
The afterlife promises
Disappeared in vain
Formless pile of bodies
Of humans sacrificed
Spilling tons of blood
Within the years of terror
Subnormal offerings
From the servants of the god
