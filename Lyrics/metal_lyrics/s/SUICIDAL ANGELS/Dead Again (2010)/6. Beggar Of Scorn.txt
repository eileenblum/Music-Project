The loss of all hope
In the heart of insanity
Beware of the evil
That leads to reality
A truth never told
Which leaves you no choice
A life dedicated to an invisible voice
The sign of the cross
Spreading the fire
A man who dominates
Every inner desire
A lifeless creature
Mourns for your soul
A white force leading you
Crashing your bones

Submission can't be ignored
Distinguished living form
Insane power of lord
Beggar of scorn

Walls closing upon you
As darkness fall
Shutting your eyes
Still feeling the call
Begging for mercy
Or sympathy to rest
Resting unconscious
In your misery's vest

Submission can't be ignored
Distinguished living form
Insane power of lord
Beggar of scorn
Submission can't be ignored
Distinguished living form
Insane power of lord
Beggar of scorn

Innocence is faint
Embedded in your mind
The roots of all evil
Portrayed before your eyes

Seeking for salvation
Searching for your god
To hide within his emptiness
Becoming his false lad
Innocence is faint
Embedded in your mind
The roots of all evil
Portrayed before your eyes

Submission can't be ignored
Distinguished living form
Insane power of lord
Beggar of scorn
Submission can't be ignored
Distinguished living form
Insane power of lord
Beggar of scorn
