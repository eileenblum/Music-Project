Signs of massive
Spread disease
No way of breaking
Through the siege
Turn your head
Up in to the sky
Name your god
As I watch you die

Let them burn
Let them die
Let them burn
Let them die

Bleeding holocaust
Bleeding holocaust

Veins been resected
Blood is running free
Conjoined with the madness
I am on killing spree
Prepare to face your maker
Bloodshed your soul will be
When coming to knees of god
To die in misery

Let them burn
Let them die
Let them burn
Let them die

Bleeding holocaust
Bleeding holocaust
Bleeding holocaust
Bleeding holocaust

Now you need survival
But I need your blood
Ferocious onslaught genocide
Speak the speech of fraud
On your chest a blade shining
Shivering you're gonna die
Slashing every inch of flesh
Of those who false deny

Bleeding holocaust
Bleeding holocaust
Bleeding holocaust
Bleeding holocaust
