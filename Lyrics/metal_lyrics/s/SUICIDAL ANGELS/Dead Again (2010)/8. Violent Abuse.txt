Degenerate the newborns
Before they face the light
Slaughtering one another
Just for me delight
With no emotion neither motive
Face the will to kill
Pathetic and bloodstained
Breath of death you feel

Imprisoned in the torture cell
Fear starts to flow
There's no escape no coming back
The powers from below

Apparently your time has come
It's not a kind of game
There is no key to break the chains
Your powers are restrained
Declaring weakness
You repent a permanent excuse
Violent abuse

Deriving from your ripping flesh
Your blood to wash my sins
Prolonged the use of violence
My instincts to be pleased
This living nightmare never ends
Eternally betrayed
Left alone abandoned
Facing the decay

Imprisoned in the torture cell
Fear starts to flow
There's no escape no coming back
The powers from below

Apparently your time has come
It's not a kind of game
There is no key to break the chains
Your powers are restrained
Declaring weakness
You repent a permanent excuse
Violent abuse
Apparently your time has come
It's not a kind of game
There is no key to break the chains
Your powers are restrained
Declaring weakness
You repent a permanent excuse
Violent abuse

Being like a mouse
Running scared inside the trap
All exits blocked
Where to hide from my wrath
Constantly the knife
Rips, rips your face
Disintegrate
You get what you deserve from this fucking race

Degenerate the newborns
Before they face the light
Slaughtering one another
Just for me delight
With no emotion neither motive
Face the will to kill
Pathetic and bloodstained
Breath of death you feel

Apparently your time has come
It's not a kind of game
There is no key to break the chains
Your powers are restrained
Declaring weakness
You repent a permanent excuse
Violent abuse
Apparently your time has come
It's not a kind of game
There is no key to break the chains
Your powers are restrained
Declaring weakness
You repent a permanent excuse
Violent abuse
