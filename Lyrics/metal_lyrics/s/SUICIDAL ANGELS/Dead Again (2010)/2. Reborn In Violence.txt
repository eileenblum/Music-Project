Born here died here
An unwanted child
Eyes of filth lust of greed
A sinful path of life
What will come, what will face
Unknown to humankind
Soon you have to see the truth
Before you see the light

I will be
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
I will be
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence

Born here died here
A soul that never rests
Living nightmare spawn disease
Spread upon your chest
What is coming from beyond
Boiling blood arise
Dissecting now my empty corpse
Before the sun comes

I will be
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
I will be
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence

Once I died my signs were left
In blood eternally
Burning souls, corrupting lives
Your time has come to bleed
No more your chains upon my life
The shackles more than useless
I return my coming back
Is more than just revenge

I am
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
Reborn in violence
