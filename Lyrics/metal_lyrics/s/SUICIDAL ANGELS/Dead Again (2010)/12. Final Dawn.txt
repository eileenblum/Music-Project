Heading south
On the very depths of hell
Ancient curse
An everlasting spell
Sleepless night
Echoes in the distance
Terrified
Insignificant the existence

Isolation suffocation a sorrowful demise
Feeble humans helpless creatures
Can you believe your eyes
You saw no truth you saw no light
On a trail a lifetime followed
Pile of dismembered corpses
Your own blood you swallow

Fiery torture
Depriving you of breath
Forging souls
Purifying eventual death
Fiery torture
Depriving you of breath
Forging souls
Purifying eventual death

Final dawn
Sun came out in blood
Final dawn
Seeking light through the dark
Final dawn
Sun came out in blood
Final dawn
Seeking light through the dark

Searching under flesh and blood
Some last remains to find
Desperate you realize
There are no vital signs
Your body starts to desiccate
Breeding horrendous odor
No option of survival
You all will die in sorrow

Final dawn
Sun came out in blood
Final dawn
Seeking light through the dark
Final dawn
Sun came out in blood
Final dawn
Seeking light through the dark
Final dawn
Sun came out in blood
Final dawn
Seeking light through the dark

Asphyxiated in the coffin initial decay
Stink of putrefaction bodies rot away
That's the way to the prospect of eternal life
Aborted from your own god
Behold the son of light

Sleeping in the dust of earth
Hearing the last call
Fallen angels standing by
Beyond your sins you fall
Perceiving that you lived a life
Serving just a lie
Aborted from your own god
Behold the son of light

It's the final dawn
