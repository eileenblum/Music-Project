How much to pay for salvation
What's the final price?
Free the souls locked in the graves
Let the spirits rise

Dead again
No sympathy, no mercy
There's no way to return
Dead again
The only path you follow
You end up dead again

Trapped in the commandments
A life without sense
Descent into chaos
Lies and no defense
Paralyzed victims
Sank below your hopes
Walking through the ruins
Of what you highly expected for

Dead again
No sympathy, no mercy
There's no way to return
Dead again
The only path you follow
You end up dead again
Dead again
No sympathy, no mercy
There's no way to return
Dead again
The only path you follow
You end up dead again

Dead again
Staring at the walls of life
Impaled corpse
Death to seek in every sigh

Confessor of the truth
Intending to degrade
Bloodstained the speech of purity
Living to be afraid
Incurable disease
Deforming humanoids
Evoking paranoia
Just listen to the voice
Vengeful starving
And envious for life
War to find in every corner
Death to seek in every sight

Dead again
No sympathy, no mercy
There's no way to return
Dead again
The only path you follow
You end up dead again
Dead again
No sympathy, no mercy
There's no way to return
Dead again
The only path you follow
You end up dead again
Dead, dead again
