A sinful path you chose in life
Your soul will not be free
You're dead before you realize
No future to foresee
A traitor demands your faith
And years of submission
All dreams all hopes all agonies
Go down in to extinction

There is no way to avert your death
A silent demise
Your prayers more than useless
A dreadful compromise
Eternally a slave you'll be
A human with no will
Anxiously awaiting
A sign to be fulfilled

Forever servants of a lie
The shepherd you must follow
Damnation of the afterlife
You know there's no tomorrow
Redemption forms in blessings
Conform the god you seek
Incantation on your life
In blood your destiny

There is no way to avert your death
A silent demise
Your prayers more than useless
A dreadful compromise
Eternally a slave you'll be
A human with no will
Anxiously awaiting
A sign to be fulfilled

The lies of resurrection
The lies of resurrection

A trade is growing as years passed
Your soul surrender, feel their lust
Go to church respect the cross
Name the prize they pay the cost
What you are what you were
Nothing but a scum
Now that you sleep undead
The plan of god is done

There is no way to avert your death
A silent demise
Your prayers more than useless
A dreadful compromise
Eternally a slave you'll be
A human with no will
Anxiously awaiting
A sign to be fulfilled

The lies of resurrection
The lies of resurrection

The lies of resurrection
The lies of resurrection
The lies of resurrection
The lies of resurrection
