Restrained suffocated
Your last time has arrived
Observing the reality
No chance you will survive
Dismembered victims all around
You are the last in tow
Can't keep the tears of fear
As watching the blood flow

Suicide, suicide, suicide solution

Screaming out what I've done
But echoes fill your ears
You get no verbal answer
Punishment draws near
You now receive the irony
In which you lived your life
I am your hand for your relief
With a sharpened knife

Suicide, suicide, suicide solution
Suicide, suicide, suicide solution

Describe me your emotions
Now you reached the end
How are you feeling?
As you lay bent
Reaching to the point
Of your last confession
I am your priest
Who offers you salvation

Standing now above your head
Walls are closing in
Colors fade away
Tormented from within
What is left to hope
What is left to seek
Moments of the past are gone
A glorious defeat

Restrained suffocated
Your last time has arrived
Observing the reality
No chance you will survive
Dismembered victims all around
You are the last in tow
Can't keep the tears of fear
As watching the blood flow

Suicide, suicide, suicide solution
Suicide, suicide, suicide solution

Suicide solution
