Foretaste of mortal agony, the broken antenatal
Enormous never-ending afflicts of encysted flesh
Carved through the uterus and slashed to the snips
They muss up recurved in saprogenic phlegm

Impregnaticide previous to pre-natal immolation
Seceded from mothers' bodies infants torn to shreds
Raw materials, left to die for the content of my lechery
Procreate with plenty of crincled and posseted meat

Copulative organs conversed into deformed snatches
I snap off pieces of corpulent softened brain
Envisage silent children gasping out their life
Fingering over amassement of avulsed genitals

Iterant raping of corpses smudged with faeces
Osteitic bones ingraine in broadened ureter
I gobble scalped ulcers and swallow up ichor
Inhale stinking exrements of incremated unborns

Lingual bones lugged out from perforated throats
Overrunning blood outwashes maggots from the guts
Knee-deep in blood, enraged i strip off the skin
Off stiffed disrupted children plunged in wormy pus

I feel the orgasm seeing infants covered with sword-cuts
Dabbling in condensable wrenched out oviducts,
Rip out with teeth the segments of damped meat
From coulter-minced gutted carcasses

Wails of children winced from pain make me mad
Continual cruel suffering, impossible to live through
I subsist with torture of harrowed oblations
Watching the skinless raped gory new-borns

I cum on remains of deformed and consumed torsos
Degust the intestines' knead imbrued with sperm
Chopped off split heads stow in pyramids
Mangled breastbones enfolded in pulled off derm

I get furious with steams of embalmed corpses
Flustered with depleting of paralytic humid flesh
Sloughing off holey scarf-skin indrawned and cockled
Inseminated mummies interblend with grumes
