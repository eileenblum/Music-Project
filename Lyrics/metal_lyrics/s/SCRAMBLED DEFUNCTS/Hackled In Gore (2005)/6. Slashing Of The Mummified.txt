The ply of mummified children reversed inside out
Grided gangrenous halved parts from whole
Multiocular rankled pasty mass of opened abscesses
Quickset of fractured gipped bodies chawed up

Infants defatted and glomerated harrowed by hardy
Overlying on stiffing congeries of damped entrails
Extensed fetor bowels exploding in the faeces
Exhausted devitalized bodies slowly ossifying

I put by crimped corpses putrefied with crawls
Fire-brand kidneys contractile in convulsions
Formation of frizzled anuses filled up with houghs
On cairns of burked and burnt crisped torsos

Bagged children abrupted with mighty millstones
Bate frets excoriated skin in huge pots
Blowflies subsist to heads impaled on the barlings
Exfoliated nipples stitched up with portal veins

Joggling infants hanging on crooks by jowles
Planed placentae parted into plies
Pylorus brew in reservoirs with blood
Picked off piecemeal meat hashed in a mess

Flatted inversed bodies exposed to intubation
Tumefacted ulcerous organs torn in two
Sliced scranched genitals interfused with gobbets
Implicated garbage furring in emetic slime

I watch the malposed fetuses broken in flinders
Footless evirated torsos stabbed with fibulae
Far and near blubbering eviscerated children
Hooved bellies growing together with hind-heads

Flensed with my whittle children tremble and twitch
Intestines unrooted from unpicked paunches
Undigested ordure eructating from esophaguses
Erupted cysts discharging stinking pus
