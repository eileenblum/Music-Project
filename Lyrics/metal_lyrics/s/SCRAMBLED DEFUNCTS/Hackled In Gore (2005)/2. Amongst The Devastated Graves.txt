I open the grave to free body locked inside
To become one with, to feel it's cold insides
Starting exhumation, my spade can't wait no more
Soon I'll feel with my skin all the dead's sores

And again the dead body starts feeding me
I almost feel it asks me to leave it alone
I'm unable to deprive myself of such a pleasure
My hands're trembling vigorously with impatience

The corpse is free and it can live it's life again
But it's another kind of life-existence full of pain
It's nothing but a helpless victim beside me
It sets all my nastiest passions free

Wildly slicing moveless body with my rusty blade
Making way for my cruel hands to penetrate
Leaving very deep scars I feel I can't stop
Until the flesh will turn into the deformed slop

Night silence devours all the sounds from the grave
The pile of rotten meat became my silent slave
My hands moving fast inside the tortured flesh
Searching the pieces of innards I pulling it's outside

Bowels lie around the grave mixed with soil
I gather it in a heap, wash it in a pool of blood
That rains from wounds of disfigured body
And put it onto the sharp spires of a grave fence

Possessed by thirst of destruction
I smash the eyeless head
Gather the crushed brains
Into the ripped out bladder

Ripped rotten flesh eclipse my mind
I'm one with the dead in inhuman ecstasy
Reaching the orgasm I tear the corpse apart
Enraged, throw it back into the desecrated pit
