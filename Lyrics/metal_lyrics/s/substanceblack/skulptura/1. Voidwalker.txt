Suddenly I found myself floating in some liquid while my eyes
Where taken away from me
I try to use my senses and find out why I'm not allowed to move
My arms, my legs my head

I've been attached to some machinery
It's been ripping out my spine
They are injecting me some kind of venom
I'm in state in which I'm

Mirror my life's neglection
Unparalleled escalation

Chords in me
Pins in me

Frequency depletion
To form a new combustion

Burning my
Traces of existence

The answer is revealed but question is not given to me at all
I try to understand why I

Mirror my life's neglection
Unparalleled escalation

Chords in me
Pins in me

Frequency depletion
To form a new combustion

Burning my
Traces of existence

I'm trapped between life and death
I didn't deserve this

Time doesn't know this place
But I'm still waiting

I'm still waiting...

Mirror my life's neglection
Unparalleled escalation

Chords in me
Pins in me

Frequency depletion
To form a new combustion

Burning my
Traces of existence
