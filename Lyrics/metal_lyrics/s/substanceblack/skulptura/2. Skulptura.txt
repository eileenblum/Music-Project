How manna slowly pours out of one's chest
So I in clockwise motion stir myself
Arms of groundlesness clutching my abidance
Now I seek consolation in manure of resentment

I waiver awkwardly
Postulating state
Staring rapidly

Constitution limpathically receding
Tamping on stones of omission

My halo encircled by repugnant worms
Their mammoth craniums throbbing
My nerves domiciliated mercury
Armatures of furtility indurated

Constitution limpathically receding
Tamping on stones of omission

Vast expanse of naught
Establish all
Grim sculpture of mortality
Vivifying malady son of mother compunction

Constitution limphatically receding
Tamping on stones of omission

Broken mind thriving backwards
Therein where demise consumes life
Again
