No matter what syringe is made off
It injects in sinews of our thoughts

To spray the perdition in this time
To concatenate to this god of complexion and subversion

So refuse
This perfid fiction that roots parameters of life's value in your mind
Condolences save
For memory on what was once known as freedom of movement and speech

Resist the masses
Which follow the word of cathode
Instead decide if fiction and lies are words you want to hear

A digital orifice
In cluster of delusion
Is what guides our own demise towards our will

Obsessed by information of wrong
We allow it to breed itself in us
So we stumble upon a wall of traitors

To choose the right from wrong
To stay aware and know the difference between

The stench of corruption and devotion
To extract the truth without reaching out for violence and death

For I deny
The very existence of one's
Will to crush the feet of few usurpers
For such patent
Never should have any components for assembling

Resist the masses
Which follow the word of cathode
Instead decide if fiction and lies are words you want to hear

A digital orifice
In cluster of delusion
Is what guides our own demise towards our will
