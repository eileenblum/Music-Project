Cryonic nightmares: a hibernating breed
Alone throuhg the light-years, left to bleed...

A quick turmoil in an ever-changing sea
We are carbon waste lifeforms by chance design
On wet rock our premature lungs are gasping for air
Sliding down, down, down this steep decline
And the gods won't tell us why
We are all left here to die

Our brains hunting for chemical relief
But this euphoria can't touch the desensitized
Sleepwalking through an endless dÃ©jÃ  vu
Sliding down, down, down this steep decline
And the gods won't tell us why
We are all left here to die

We scrape the filth off of our souls
Tear the flesh off of our bones
We've been rotting since we were born
Still the gods won't tell us why
We are all left here to die

In vessels designed for three decades of life
We are falling through time, holding on tight
Wondering why, why we must die
Even thousands of years down the line
And cancer will thrive on our bodies and minds
The tumors malign, but like maggots we're blind
So we're swarming like fles
To the last dying light
Though it's viciously burning our eyes

We are all left here to die witnessing
This slow degeneration of the last mutation
