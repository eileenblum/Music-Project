Reflections of the past
Observers of your present
Impossible to grasp like shadows, like ghosts
On the periphery of your cognition
We serve chilling epiphanies like shadows, like ghosts
Like whispers piercing through
The barriers built by the rational mind
Carrying signals through time

Harmonically dissonant patterns
Compose the matter that form our bones
Not entirely unlike you yet in tune with strange vibrations
We're only passing through like shadows, like ghosts
Ultra-dimensional inhabitants of foreign angles
Cold and uncomfortable like shadows, like ghosts
Like whispers piercing through
The barriers built by the rational mind
Carrying signals through time

Like shadows we move through your world
Like ghosts with voices unheard
Like gods you no longer serve
Like shadows we move through your world
Like ghosts with voices unheard
We touch, we see, we feel...

Like shadows we move through your world
Like ghosts with voices unheard

Reflections of the past
Observers of your present
Impossible to grasp like shadows, like ghosts
Like whispers piercing through
The barriers built by the rational mind
Carrying signals through time
Like shadows
Like ghosts
