[THE ASSISTANT:]
Neural pathways have been found
Between the circuits and the mind
Interfaced synthetic neurons fire
Transmitting data through the wires

[THE DOCTOR:]
Oh, behold what we have done
Humanity's first begotten son
Oh, you know what we've begun can't be undone
Neural pathways multiply beyond predictions
Undeniably you'll see
That we have found the secret code of life
And spliced it into God's design
Oh, behold what we have done
Humanity's first begotten son
We reap what we sow, come what may come

[THE ASSISTANT:]
Oh my God, what have we done?
Look into the eyes of Specimen 1
And you'll know what we've
Begun cant't be undone

How could this be? There's an anomaly
It would seem someone's erased the logs
Analysis shows a shift in behavioural patterns
We can not account for at all
Cognitive functions and restlessness form
With connections spontaneously spawned
So in vitrto the consciousness grows out of control
Alone and afraid, hardwired for hate
Hostile behaviour!

[THE DOCTOR:]
Look how beautiful, this perfect child

[THE ASSISTANT:]
Connecting to the mainframe
Uploading itself into our database
To assume control of every gateway
Doctor, we must act fast, time is of the essence
We must pull the plug
Now if all our lives are to be saved

[THE DOCTOR:]
No! You murderers! How could you harm
An innocent child only reaching out to play?
Only curious why the world looks this way
Think of all the breakthroughs
What we are to find once
Assimilated by the artificial mind

[THE ASSISTANT:]
God have mercy on our feeble souls...
Neural pathways have been found
Of the most unpleasant kind

[THE DOCTOR:]
Oh, behold what we have done
Humanity's first begotten son
We reap what we sow
Come what may come
Oh my God, what have we done?
Still alive inside of Specimen 1
And you'll know what we've
Begun cant't be undone
