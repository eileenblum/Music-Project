Are you ready for pain?
It's showtime and we are the stars
For your crimes you will pay
I'll find you wherever you are

Don't look back, you know I'll be there
You'd better run, you'd better beware
No remorse, no one shall be spared
No one ever won but the show must go on

Keep running!
There's nowhere you can hide
Keep running!
The Game is to stay alive

When you enter to the Zone
You'd better stay out of the light
It's each man for his own
No mercy, no wrong and no right

Keep running on through the night
Keep running on for your life
There is nowhere you can hide
Keep running on through the night
Keep running or you'll die
The game is to stay alive

Are you ready for pain?
It's showtime
