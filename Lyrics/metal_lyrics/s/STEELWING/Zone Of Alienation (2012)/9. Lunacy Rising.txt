There is something in the air tonight
I feel with every breath a wind that's gentle yet cold
I lift my eyes to towards the light
Celestial bodies set in motions relentless and old

The hunter's moon is rising to illuminate the trees
Amber fire burning all that I can see
Stalking the horizons close as ever it could be
Sending shivers through the autumn leaves

And have we not since ancient times intently met His gaze
And have we never wondered what He might have to say
Mesmerized by every line upon His placid face
Cursing the arrival of the coming day

And I will miss you endlessly although you're coming back to me
I only there was something I could do to make you see
And never will I ever leave Thy side
And I would lie if I ever would say the sun as bright as you could shine
Lunacy rising
Drawn from below
At your command Angel of Light
Lunacy rising
Now I am yours
So take my hand
Guardian of the night

Ignorance turns into clarity, now I can see
Periodic and patiently longing for each perigee
My master is quietly watching, awaiting the time
The final rebellion; the self-righteous brother must die

Pulling the mountains, exposing the cracks of the Earth
Pushing the oceans ashore as if cleansing the world
Be that my mission, O Master, I'd gladly obey
I'll follow you every command to the end of my days

Why can't they see the ways of Thee?
Oh, lunacy it's just you and me

Cries in the night in the absence of light I'm alone
Chained in my cell I am trapped in this hell down bellow
Have I gone blind? If but only a sign you could show
Master, O Master! This can't be the last of your glow!
No!

Why can't I see the ways of Thee?
Oh, lunacy what's left of me
