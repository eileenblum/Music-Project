Speeding through the night
Far beyond the light
Blasting cross the galaxy
Fading from your sight
Point of no return
The bridges have been burned
In the wake of fury no lesson will be learned
Way over the red line we find piece of mind
Pounding at the cracks of the Grand Design
Breaking every rule of the fools leading the fools
There's no end of what we can do

Push it to limit
Into overload
All Systems go
We are ready to explode

Full speed ahead!
Ready to attack, never looking back
We go full speed ahead
Full speed ahead!
Move in for the kill, shooting for the thrill
We go full speed ahead
Full speed ahead!

Hey! Out of the way!
There's nothing left to say
Better run for cover or be left in our trail
Eye for an aye for a final goodbye
Stand in our way and die

Full speed ahead!
Ready to attack, never looking back
We go full speed ahead
Full speed ahead!
Move in for the kill, shooting for the thrill
We go full speed ahead
Full speed ahead!
