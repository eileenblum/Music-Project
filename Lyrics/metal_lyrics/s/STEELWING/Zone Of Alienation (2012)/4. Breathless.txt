Skin tight leather suits you fine
I want to wear you like a trophy, want to make you mine
Forever is just a matter of time
High heeled strut-around heading down town
If passion is a crime we'll be doing our time together
You're as guilty as I am

Don't think for a second
That I would leave you here alone
I won't take your heart away
I'll just strip you to the bone
Leave you breathless

Come inside, taste the wine
I feel the shivers running down your precious little spine
Together at the end of the line
Lie down here and wipe your tears
Close your eyes and you will see all my intentions so clear
You're trembling, just let go all your fears

Don't think for a second
That I would leave alone tied to the floor 
You know that I won't take your heart away
I'll just strip you to the bone
Leave you breathless
