For years we have trained our bodies and minds
For the mission that's now underway
Our fears we have conquered, we're ready to die
The decision was easily made

And so we take to the skies
To honour the lands with our lives
Under the sunrise and over the winds
To the glorious death we will die

An empire in ashes, a desperate act
But courage will show us the way
And hellfire shall rain in this final attack
The divine wind will blow them away

Tokkotai! Tokkotai!
Sayonara, this is good bye
Tokkotai! Tokkotai!
A furious storm divine
Decided to win we ride with the wind
Determinated to kill without fail
Tokkotai! Tokkotai!
A furious storm divine

Man and machine unite
The Special Forces strike
We won't back down
Upon pacific shores
The coming of the storm
Will turn the tides of war

The spirit of old running strong in our veins
The red and the white bind us all
Long live the Emperor!
We lived to obey and as death form the heavens we fall
