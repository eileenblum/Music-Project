I am the one inside your mind 
A master of illusion in both space and time 
Throw me in chains and leave me to drown 
Still I'll break free and I will stand my ground 
These simple contraptions are no match for me 
I've been searching so long for a way to succeed 
Infernal visions of my rebirth 
From the man who shed light on the face of the earth 

An illusion 
Twisted confusion 
Only one thing on my mind an it drives me insane 
Untameable power 
Enter the hour 
The last chapter of my life will be written tonight 

No one shall stand in my way

I have found the key to illusions you can not conceive 
I'm not bound, I'm further ahead then you'll ever believe 

[Lead: Vega ]

Electrical madness, an infernal scream 
Unleashing the wrath of the monstrous machine 
Witness the power of my hellish device 
A stunning performance to the worlds eyes 
Memories of death they all reappear 
My heart it is pounding but I know no fear 
My last moments of sanity 
Wiped away by the power consuming what's me 

An illusion 
My execution 
Lightning burning inside my veins 
Electrical, thunder 
The worlds seventh wonder 
Lights out, I disappear and return 
I'm the man who's back from the dead!
