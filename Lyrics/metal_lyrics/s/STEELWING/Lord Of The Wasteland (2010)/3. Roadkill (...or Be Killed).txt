Cloud of dust in the desert sands 
Dogs of war at my command 
We are mobile brutality 
Propelled by our thunder machines 

In the roar of an engine 
You lost everything you knew 
Ant in a firestorm of fear 
You will burn as the dust now clears 

Your life no more worth to me 
Than a gallon of gasoline, you'll see 

Kill or be killed 
Lord of the Wasteland 
Kill or be killed 
King of the road 
Kill or be killed 
Maraud and disgrace 
Kill or be killed 
Stand true to the code of roadkill 

The scavengers soon will rule 
Waging war for a tank of fuel 
And as man will feed on man 
You may die by my hand 

Your life no more worth to me 
Than a gallon of gasoline, you'll see 

Kill or be killed 
Lord of the Wasteland 
Kill or be killed 
King of the road 
Kill or be killed 
Maraud and disgrace 
Kill or be killed 
Stand true to the code of roadkill 

Engines roaring 
Taste of sweat 
See me coming 
Face your death

Cloud of dust in the desert sands 
Dogs of war at my command 
We are mobile brutality 
Propelled by our thunder machines 

Your life no more worth to me 
Than a gallon of gasoline, you'll see 

Kill or be killed 
Lord of the Wasteland 
Kill or be killed 
King of the road 
Kill or be killed 
Maraud and disgrace 
Kill or be killed 
Stand true to the code of roadkill 

Kill or be killed 
Highways of death 
Kill or be killed 
White line nightmares as set in 
Kill or be killed 
Maraud and disgrace 
Kill or be killed 
Stand true to the code of roadkill 

Kill or be killed!
