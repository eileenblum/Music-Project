As night awakens and the day is put to sleep 
By dancing shadows on the wall 
The moon is glowing and the darkness starts to creep 
I must obey the masters call 

Never ever may I see the light of day 
Never darkness I'll betray 

O hear my cry, master 
Let it be known to all 
I am the nightwatcher 
The black is soon to 
Do be my guide, master 
Let it be known to all 
I am the nightwatcher 
The black is soon to fall fall 

I am the keeper of the mysteries of night 
The quiet beauty of what's thine 
I am the watcher and if men could share my sights 
They too would worship thee as I do 

Never ever would the sun rise in the east 
Never none disturb the peace 

O hear my cry, master 
Let it be known to all 
I am the nightwatcher 
The black is soon to 
Do be my guide, master 
Let it be known to all 
I am the nightwatcher 
The black is soon to fall fall 

By the twelve strikes of the clock 
All the wonders of night are unlocked 

Never ever may I see the light of day 
Never darkness I'll betray 

O hear my cry, master 
Let it be known to all 
I am the nightwatcher 
The black is soon to 
Do be my guide, master 
Let it be known to all 
I am the nightwatcher 
The black is soon to fall fall
