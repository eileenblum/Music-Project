Say have you seen that place where fireflies in great profusion come out to dance as evening falls 
Say have you heard the chattering whippoorwills cry out for you, son 
Or felt the strident bullfrogs call 

Far to the west across the stretch of marshland meadow where the road dips past the ancient bishop house 
Rises that mystic bulky hill no one would speak of where no answers come from asking why or how 

Though superstition it might be 
The elders know what they have seen 
And had you been there you would surely agree 
They say if you haven't 
Then you shouldn't go to Sentinel Hill 

[Lead: Vega ]

Atop the hill inside the ring of massive granite pillars 
And round the ghoulish table rock 
Though often attributed falsely to the native Indians 
Where found remains of mongrel stock 

Back in the days before the trials and persecution 
Some say witches used to gather here at night 
At devil's hop yard where they held their executions 
Still the moss may seem to glow with eerie light 

Though superstition it might be 
The elders know what they have seen 
And had you been there you would surely agree 
They say if you haven't 
Then you shouldn't go past the boundaries of sanity 
Up the the slanting trail to Sentinel Hill 
Ancient wisdom passed down through the bloodlines 
They say if you haven't 
Oh, God knows you shouldn't go to Sentinel Hill 

[Lead: Vega ]

They say if you haven't 
Then you shouldn't go to Sentinel Hill
