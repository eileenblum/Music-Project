From ancient times we came 
Moving silently 
Killing for the game 
Oh, you will fear me 

Are you the hunter 
Are you the prey 
If you don't strike first it will be your last mistake 
There's nowhere you can run to 

Gotta move fast 
No one can hide 
I must find the last 
The last one alive 
Doesn't matter if they're friend or foe 

Love is not for you 
Too many times you've lost 
When they see me coming 
It's time to count the cost 

In the shadows 
Wherever I go 
In the shadow of the blade 
Out of the darkness 
Obey the call 
I am the hunter you're the prey

Beware the nightfall 
Sharpen your mind 
Prepare for battle 
Draw your blade one final time 
Your fate is drawing nearer 

Raging thunder 
Fulfils the game 
I am the hunter 
Ant tonight my prize I'll claim 
Tonight you sleep in hell 

They are gone now 
Their souls belong to me 
They are all gone 
I set them free 

In the shadows 
Wherever I go 
In the shadow of the blade 
Out of the darkness 
Obey the call 
I am the hunter you're the prey 

I'm on a headhunt! 
Headhunt!
