Old man, tell us of the past before the wastelands: we must know at last 
Legends, stories we have heard but you lived when the mighty fires scorched the world 

Son, I remember, The elder said; A time of chaos, a time of dread 
In the east awoke the sleeping bear 
Its roar of anger reached where eagles dare 

Ideologies uncompromised became the seeds of hatred and despise 

We would do anything lest all we knew be destroyed 
We would do anything we could to avoid the clash 

Diplomatic tension, coiled up as a spring 
If unleashed would surely bring us to the brink of destruction 
So what lay ahead; our survival on a razors edge 

Naturally assured destruction seemed at last the only way peace could be guaranteed 

We would do anything lest all we knew be destroyed 
We would do anything we could to avoid the clash 

Two sides of the world, alliances formed dividing the earth for the oncoming storm 
An arms race like never before provided the tools of the ultimate war 

[Lead: Vega ]

No one knows who cast the first stone but surely the die had been thrown 
War waged at the highest of costs: all hope for the future was finally lost 

Elimination imminent all bridges burnt all chances spent 
Technology and wealth would cease for patriotic pride to please 
The cry of a billion souls as one 
The world as we knew it came undone
