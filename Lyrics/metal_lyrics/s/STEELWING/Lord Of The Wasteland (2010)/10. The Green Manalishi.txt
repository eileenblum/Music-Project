[Japanese Bonus Track]Now when the day goes to sleep
And the full Moon looks
And the night is so black
That the darkness cooks

And you come creeping around
Making me do things I don't want to do

I can't believe
That you need my love so bad
You're sneaking around
Trying to drive me mad

Busting in all my dreams
Making me see things I don't wanna see

'Cause you're the Green Manalishi
With the two pronged crown
All my trying is up
All your bringing us down

Just take my love and slip away
Leaving me here trying to keep from following you
