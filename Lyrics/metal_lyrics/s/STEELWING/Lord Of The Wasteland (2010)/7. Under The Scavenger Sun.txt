The journey goes on through this white hot sand 
Trapped as I am in these merciless lands 
Salvation is miles and miles away 
If ever alive I will reach the day 

I can hear them, I can see them 
Circling high above 
I can hear them, I can see them 
As this cruel relentless sun burns 

A god with the power to breed or kill 
My life to be given or taken at will 
Yet others might thrive at my death it seems 
So eager to the tone of their hungry screams 

I can hear them, I can see them 
Circling high above 
I can hear them, I can see them 
As this cruel relentless sun burns 

This cruel, relentless scavenger sun burns 

[Lead: Rockbag ]

At the toll of death's bells 
Come outcasts of hell 
To join in the feast of death 
They bid me farewell 

[Lead: Vega ]

I can hear them, I can see them 
Circling high above 
I can hear them, I can see them 
As this cruel relentless sun burns 

This cruel, relentless scavenger sun burns 

Transcending at last 
This realm I've surpassed 
Now bound to prowl under the scavenger sun 

Now I am bound under the scavenger sun
