Was I in mistake when I tried to know?
There was no intent to oust him from the throne. 
No, it was against worse ignorance
Ohh I just wanna raise my knowledge

I feel that I wanna reach God
And the fiend can now lead
My conscience to construe
I feel that I possess the sooth
Of this stairway to heaven
And I know
The damage is done!
Help me to build it
Help me to build the tower...

Let's go bring me there...

I know how
I feel that I wanna reach God
And the fiend can now lead
My conscience to construe
I feel that I possess the sooth
Of this stairway to heaven
And I know
The damage is done! Oh no!

and I feel that I'm going down
God now damned
my life for my crime
I feel that the ransom is close 
And this stairway to heaven
Hasn't kill
The chance to rise , I know!
