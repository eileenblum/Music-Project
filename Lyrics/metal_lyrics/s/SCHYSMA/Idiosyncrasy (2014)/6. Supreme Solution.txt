Just the hour when I said
Perchance in memory of my broken dreamsâ¦.âbut I should tryâ
Inwardly my spirit was betrayed
âcause I donât know if I can resistâ¦â¦.to this mind

Ehhhhhhhhhhhh
Now I feel like my broken doll
Itâs soon joined to my soul
Iâll remember to that hera, when I rest well on my own

Iâm homesick when really I live
Proud of the unassertive great world
Completely empty from any care

Itâs better die instead

I would say you to shut up now
What youâve said are only slick words
âcause Iâve fallen to the filthiest
And now I have not a real chance to float
So you can fuck up, or murdered yourself
I donât want to see a piece of shit like you
I can show you, what I promise
When the situation will be sunken like this

Genocide
Ethnic cleansing
Itâs all fuck need to you

The pesticide of propaganda
Parch all like a cancer throat, in the end
I can shake you like a piece of flash
At least nuke is the solution supreme 

Genocide
Ethnic cleasing
Itâs all fuck need to you

Now I feel like my broken head
Itâs soon joined to my soul
Iâll remember to that hera (Hera, like the goddess?) 

But thereâs nothing more to trust
No more possibility for the world
Do you hear me when I say

Nukeâem

Just the hour when I said
Perchance in memory of my broken dreamsâ¦.âbut I should tryââ¦..ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Inwardly spirit was betrayed
âcause I donât know if I can resistâ¦â¦.to this mind
