Now I feel like Iâve not got it...
So forlorn
So lonely
Sometimes I just desire to... go away
Cohabit with lust of success
Abrade me
Corrode me
Sometimes I can repose the maze

Damning slaves and masters
I follow again the wire in the maze
Goddamn itâs hard to get out
Say your prayer and wait

No flower from this stem are grows
So barren
So raw
Somehow get out this tricky clew
Reaching torpor and apathy
So quickly
So slowly
Sometimes I can repose the mazeâ¦..no way

May now weâve lost the way
Below my hopes
Iâve prayed 
But nobody has heard

Lost in the maze
Clash a dense wall of prospect
Falling in the deepest black
Sense of cruel useless
Lost in the maze
Clash a dense wall of prospect
Try to trudge painfully
Out the maze

May Now weâve lost the way
Below my hopes
Iâve prayed 
But nobodyâs heard

Lost in the maze
Clash a dense wall of prospect
Falling in the deepest blackest
Sense of cruel useless
Lost in the maze
Clash a dense wall of prospect
Try to trudge painfully
Out the maze

May now weâve lost the way
