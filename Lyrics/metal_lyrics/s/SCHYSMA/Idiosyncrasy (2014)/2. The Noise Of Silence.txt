Now Iâm feel like nobody
Lost My head
My soul begins to rot
Silence fills my sick mind
Want to scream
Nobody hears my pain

The sight of souls 
That I may not tell 

My empty spirit is now dead
Wounded vein
My body grips in suspense
My faded brain is now frozen
Please donât give 
Another chance to outlive
The sight of souls 
Grown so great in me 
Like I cannot reveal 
Condemned and prevailed 

And so far
So we slowly paced through the rain that fell
(no suspicion, have not suspicion)
Alone we are 
For human semblance in fire shade
(no suspicion, have not suspicion)
rain in my mind
Lack of trust
The noise of silence

Itâs beneath my notice
But memory fears to tell 
The sinners here contained 
In the sewers of Hell

And so far
So we slowly paced through the rain that fell 
(no suspicion, have not suspicion)
Alone we are 
For human semblance in fire shade 
(no suspicion, I have not suspicion)
rain in my mind
Lack of trust
the noise of silence

The noise of silence blocks one moment from mine eyes
That locked and sealed us from the world: we heard 
That locked and sealed us from the world: we heard 
The steps recede.
