And God looks down upon the Earth
Peering at violence
Observing hatred and he
Can hears the blasphemies spoken 
A small humanity does not deserve to exist

Lead the people through dust
Yet they seem to rove
Picking up ashes
Sign of a cross, salvation for each sinner but...
Everything now fades to... Dark!

All our faith falls apart
Roll of dies
Murdered hopes
And then He sent forth His Son
Guaranty of judgment for human race

Eyes of hell now on us
Don't give dispair
Don't be afraid
Only seven churches and seven stars
Now everything just fades to dark!

A masquerade, a fairytale is fading to dark.
A black sun is shining fears, raining tears of hundred milion pains
A black sun is shining fears, raining tears of hundred milion pains

Salvation for sinners but...
Everything now fades to... Dark!

A masquerade, a fairytale is fading to dark.
A fairytale where dark will claim a bloody moon.
A black sun is shining fears, raining tears of hundred milion pains
A black sun is shining fears, raining tears of hundred milion pains

Salvation for sinners... 

Salvation for sinners but...
Everything now fades to... Dark
