Lying awake every night
Feeling the emptiness inside
Anticipating what I cannot avoid

Sensing my sanity vanish
Slowly becoming unhinged
Secretly craving for this life to cease.

Regardless of our incessant search for meaning
Life's secrets won't be unfold.
Our weak minds fail to comprehend
Putting our existence on hold!

Myâ¦ worstâ¦ nightmare.
Hasâ¦ becomeâ¦ this life.

[Breno's lead]
[Murillo's lead]
[Juan's lead]

Lying awake every night
Hearing the voices within
Screaming out loud but no one seems to hear

Imprisoned inside my own mind
Trapped by my own frailty
Waiting for the end to set me free

Regardless of our incessant search for meaning
Life's secrets won't be unfold.
Our weak minds fail to comprehend
Putting our existence on hold!
