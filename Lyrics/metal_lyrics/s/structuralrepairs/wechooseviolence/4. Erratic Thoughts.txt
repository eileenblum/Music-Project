Marching alone
Towards obsolescence
A narrowing path
Which leads me to death

Though there's no room for me
In your superfluous world
This pain inside of my chest
Will fade away in a swirl

Time will take away
All that you love
You'll see in the end
There's no one above

No need to say thy prayers now
Betrayed by your beliefs is how you'll fall

Erratic
Thoughts cloud your mind
This glare you see
Reflects on death's (scythe)

Deceived
Since birth
Nothing
Is worth

[Breno's lead]

Marching alone
Towards obsolescence
A narrowing path
Which leads me to death
