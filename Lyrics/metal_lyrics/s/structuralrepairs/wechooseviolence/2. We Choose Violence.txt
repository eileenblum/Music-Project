We choose violence
Warpath; the blood runs down.
I feel its warmth streaming down my face.
Soaked in guts.
Remorseless, here I stand.
From this, I shall never repent.

Vengeanceâ¦ it tastes so sweet.
Your putrid soulâ¦ will rest in peaceâ¦ now.

Another vermin,
That now is gone.

(We choose violence)
Fuck your stupid peace talks. Hate is a language y'all understand.
(We choose violence)
You thought that you could do whatever pleased you; now you found out the price that you pay.
(We choose violence)
You crossed too many and fucked up so much; now no one will come to your aid.
(We choose violence)
I hope it all has been worth your while as you feel the cold touch of my blade.

Let's make a fucking example out of you and hope your death has not been in vain.

A new day comes
Now we can breathe
For now our mission is complete.
The scum that once
Walked on this earth
Now lies forever under six feet.
