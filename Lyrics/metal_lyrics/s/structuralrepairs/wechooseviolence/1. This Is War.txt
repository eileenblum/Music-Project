From the trenches screams of pain echo in the air
I can feel the steps from troops marching over my head
I keep my nose out of the mud, I can smell the blood
Just a peon torn apart on someone's game of chess
The stench of gas fills my nostrils and pollutes my lungs
Cold winds come down from the hills; I feel it in my bones
An endless nightmare, my agony is all there's left.
Who will survive this mess? Will I be the chosen one?

From the bullet wounds
My blood flows through
My life's drained with it; this is war!

The end is coming close for me; I know death's drawing near
Soon the pain and suffering all shall disappear
I gather strength and I stand tall, I pick my double-barrel
I'll die, but I'll take all I can straight with me to hell

My time has come
I feel life fading
But I'll take you with me; this is war

[Solo]

From the bullet wounds
My blood flows through
My life's drained with it; this is war!

My time has come
I feel life fading
But I'll take you with me; this is war
