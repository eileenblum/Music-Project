You have nothing that I want
Nothing that I need
And your bullshit trend lifestyle
Is meaningless to me

When confronted with your ignorance
I swallow back a sneer
Your uneducated opinion
Is not wanted here
You always had to cross
Every line I drew
And now you wonder why I turn
I turn on you

Walk away now
While you can
Above your lies
I will always rise

Ever heard of dignity?
A word that to you is empty
Just like responsibility
You'll never know integrity
You always had to cross
Every line I drew
And now you wonder why I turn
I turn on you

Walk away now
While you can
Above your lies
I will always rise

I will always rise. above your lies
