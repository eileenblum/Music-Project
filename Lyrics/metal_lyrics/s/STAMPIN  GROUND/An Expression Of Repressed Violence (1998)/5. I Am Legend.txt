I am one
Standing proud
I am one

I bled through every pore of my being
Automaton, unfeeling
Aurora borealis of agony
The white hot fires of misery

I am one
Standing alone 
I am one
Standing proud

I tasted your sweet tears 
Drank them down and spat them out 
And receiving your weak pity 
Threw back my head and laughed aloud

Defences stripped, fibre by fibre
Raw exposed oozing meat 
Slowly being cauterised 
By the salty lash
Of bitter defeat

I've been basted
On the spits of hell 
Like an angel
I rose and fell

I am one
Standing alone 
I am one
Standing proud
