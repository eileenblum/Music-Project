[Bonus Track][originally by One Way System]When we get back to Jerusalem
Everybody's gonna praise our name
When we get back to Jerusalem
Ain't nothing gonna be the same
When the system hits Jerusalem
All the waters gonna turn to beer
When we get back to Jerusalem
You won't never see us hanging round here

Jerusalem can't you feel the heat
Jerusalem dare you walk the streets
With everybody looking after number one
Your face ain't noticed till you're gone

The last time we went to Jerusalem
Everyone said we sounded fine
The last time we went to Jerusalem
Everybody had a real good time
The punks ain't punks in Jerusalem
They all think they know how to pose
Opinions don't matter in Jerusalem
As long as you wear the right clothes
