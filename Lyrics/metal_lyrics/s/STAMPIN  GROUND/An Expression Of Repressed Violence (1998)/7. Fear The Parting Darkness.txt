If you never rise how can you fall?
But once again i'm through the floor
I stare into the mirror and all I see
A shadow of what used to be
Worthy of nothing, going nowhere fast
No future, less of a past
Where you see truth I see only lies
Looking out from jaded eyes

Where you see love, I see only hate
Where you see truth, I see only lies

A lack of control lies in us all
The root of all evil lies in us all
Our capacity for violence, lack of control

In darkness my demons surface again
From their pit they call my name
My every failing made the cruellest flesh
Each one of them I must confess
First i'll hurt you then i'll hurt myself
Dragged screaming to my hell
Show you where I choose to dwell alone
Alienation, my home from home

Where you see love, I see only hate
Where you see truth, I see only lies

A lack of control lies in us all
The root of all evil lies in us all
Our capacity for violence, lack of control

How much hate can I contain?
How come it's always me to blame?
What's chaos to you I think sane
Where you feel pleasure I feel pain

A lack of control lies in us all
