The wail of sobbing loved ones
The echoes of the lies you told
The misery
That your ignorance has sown
The sum total of the drugs you sold

That noise like an approaching train
A bullet speeding from its chamber
Before exploding in your brain
All your life's worth?
The death you so deserve
You must stand trial for your crimes
At the hands of those maligned

Look away or kneel and pray

The death you deserve
The death you will be dealt
The death you deserve

You only offer false hope and peace
Deluding the naive
With your madness of reason
Feeding on the weak and vulnerable
Prince of lies, meet your judgment
The age of fire has arrived 
A ritual killing sacrifice

Look away or kneel and pray

The death you deserve
The death you will be dealt
The death you deserve

You must stand trial for your crimes 
At the hands of those maligned
Look away or kneel and 
 pray
But you will be dealt
The death you deserve
The age of fire has arrived 
A ritual killing sacrifice
