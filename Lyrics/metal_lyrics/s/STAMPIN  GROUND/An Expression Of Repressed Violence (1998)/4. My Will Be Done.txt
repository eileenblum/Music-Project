Try as you might you will never see 
All the depths I have in me
I've always tried to choose my words
But they always seem to sound absurd
All the futile causes that I backed
All the self belief that I lacked 
I do my best to find the way 
But it gets harder every single day

Mark my words
I will be heard

Drowning all that you hold dear 
In the flood of truth you always feared
As inevitable as death
Judgement comes unstoppable
My will be done

Nothing that you ever say about me
Can sum me up adequately
Like grabbing at dust with your fists
You won't find a label that really fits
Shield your eyes against the rays
As the sun in me starts to blaze
As this blood begins to boil 
Into your world like molten oil

Mark my words
I will be heard

Drowning all that you hold dear 
In the flood of truth you always feared
As inevitable as death
Judgement comes unstoppable
My will be done
