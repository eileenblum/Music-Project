Clinging to tragic tradition 
Shackled by inherited lies
The subliminal indoctrination
Of who is wrong and who is right

Even in this enlightened age
Equality's still a dirty word
And expectations still dictate
Time to feel

Who can speak and be heard

Even today

These remnants of a primitive culture
The forlorn cadence of recrimination
Learn to relent before intelligence
It's about time we got with the programme

Emasculate

Years now, it's time to learn
The wisdom of humility
Time to feel the primal strength
Of unchained femininity

Even today

These remnants of a primitive culture
The forlorn cadence of recrimination
Learn to relent before intelligence
It's about time we got with the programme
The primal strength
