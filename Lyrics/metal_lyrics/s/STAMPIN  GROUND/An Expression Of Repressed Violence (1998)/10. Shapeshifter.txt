So you fabricated lies
Your paper thin disguise
And seek out the affections
Of those you once scorned
We always knew you lied
Each time your lips tore apart
Venom and bile oozed out

And now
We know - The truth - Will out

You'll always reap what you sow
We have nothing to fear
You'd best look over your shoulder
Your angel of suffering's near

And now
We know - The truth - Will out

Were you even there?
Apparently you weren't
'Cos everything we said
You obviously never heard
Effortlessly changing your spots
Facelessly blending
Searching for some direction
Lacking any master plan

We know the truth will out
As surely as night follows day
We know the truth will out
As you crawl away
