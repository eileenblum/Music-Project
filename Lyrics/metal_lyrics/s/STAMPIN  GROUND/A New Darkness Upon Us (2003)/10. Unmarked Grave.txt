Killing their children wont bring back our dead
Since when's retaliation been a means to and end?
Don't believe all you read, don't get caught up in the hate
The truth is never black and white
Replace like for like then question why
All those people had to die for all the death you're creating
I hope your point's well worth making
As we become what we oppose
There's no such thing as friendly fire when you are the ones under fire...
If only our powers of empathy matched the might of our military display
Sit on the fence untill it burns
Another hard lesson learned
War is terror for the innocent
But when the fuck will we relent?
As we become what we oppose
There's no such thing
There's no such thing as friendly fire when you are the ones under fire...
