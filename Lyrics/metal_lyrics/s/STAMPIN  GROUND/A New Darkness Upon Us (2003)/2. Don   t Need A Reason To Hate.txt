I don't need a reason to hate you
The reasons you gave me are reason enough
Think that youv'e really got me sussed?
Are you sure just who you trust?
I don't know myself at all no more, they've always said that need's a must
I turned to see I'm not what I wanted to be
Fuck you, don't need you I don't need a reason to hate
I don't need anything you have to offer me
I don't value your opinion or company
If you want to make my life complete
Then just stop breathing in your sleep
Don't need reasons to hate
I don't need reason to hate
I want out of this, can't you see?
Hanging in by the skin of my teeth
The taste of you, it sickens me
I want out, I just want.... the setting sun, it burns me from the sky
It lights your face as I watch you die
That bridge you burnt has reappeared
Cross if you dare, but don't come back
Fuck you, don't need you
I don't need a reason to hate you
1001 deaths I wish upon you
And everyone, everything you love
Revenge is sweet and I know I should gloat
But negativity, sticks in my throat
Don't need reasons to hate
I don't need reasons to hate
Counting seconds as they pass by
Time enough for every fucking lie that you ever whispered in my ear
I won't forget this time, not again
I make a totem of your pain
Worship your enemies as gods
