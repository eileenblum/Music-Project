The day everything meant nothing and all the world's darkness poured into me
Bring on the hate in all its glory and let it do what it will with me
Nothing really lasts forever except the memory of betrayal, the ache of emotions severed, the lonely numbness of denial
So, welcome the pain
Thrive on it
The cruel chemistry
One man's heaven is another man's hell
Do not put your trust in anyone
Or watch it die like a flame
As love and blood soak the snow you wrestle with where to lay the blame
My life knocked a few words
Comfort from grief
Whispering to me of my mistakes
Pain is weakness leaving the body
We must take the bitter with the bitter
Even if we choke as we swallow
The most valuable lessons are always hardest
And as pain flees, new strength must follow
