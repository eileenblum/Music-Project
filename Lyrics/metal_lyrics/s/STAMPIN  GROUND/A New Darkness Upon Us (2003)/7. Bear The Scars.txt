Stabbed in the back by a memory
There's nothing left
I'm empty inside
I've lost my heart, my soul and all that's left is pride
I'd give my life to just turn back the clock
At the very least if I could make it stop
I am becoming death
How can I say what can't be said?
Yearn to be one with the fragrant dead
To bathe forever in the tears we shed
And if its my maker that I'm gonna meet then I will beg him to unmake me
Veil lifted from my eyes
I see myself for the first time
I still bear the scars of treachery
Buried deep within myself there hides the enemy
This coming of rage
A virus in me
I cling to my demons oh, so desperately
I am becoming death
How can I say what can't be said?
Yearn to be one with the fragrant dead
To bath forever in the tears we shed
And if it's my maker I'm gonna meet then I will beg him to unmake me
Bare the scars
