Be at one with the heretic that resides inside us all
Make your peace with the warmonger when you heed his call
2003 years of kissing ass
Tell them how much longer will this penance last?
No more acts of pure blind faith
It is time to test your god
A short time to live
A long time to wait
Your faith is so fragile
Handle with prayer
Turn your judgement inward and see what lies there
Reason gives way to bloodlust
We watch our world tear itself apart
We make our own homes our gallows
Chooking ourselves, serving time
A short time to live
A long time to wait
So do you honestly think that you've seen the light?
A thousand churches haunted by jesus christ
A world where madness and grief is commonplace
How can I blame you for clinging to your misplaced faith?
Do you honestly think that you've seen the light?
A thousand churches possessed by jesus christ
A world where madness is spread through our grace
How can I blame you for clinging to your misplaced faith?
A short time to live
A long time to wait
Faith has fled this place
Hanging its head in shame
Your lies are a disgrace
You seek to lay the blame
In search of redemption we tear ourselves apart
The answers we seek are in our own hearts
Behind the light
