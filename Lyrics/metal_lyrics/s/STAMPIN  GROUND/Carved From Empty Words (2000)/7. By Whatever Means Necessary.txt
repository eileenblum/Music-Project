Go your own way
Go your own way in life
And let me follow mine
And maybe our paths will cross again
In another place and another time

So confused by the bludgeon of bland routine
We resign our ambition to what might have been

If this is how it's meant to be
Who made these plans for you and me?
Who says that we cannot achieve
All the things that we believe?

There is no secret to inner strength
I need self-belief, and nothing else
I need some self-respect
Nothing less

Can you look at yourself and truly say
That you really acted for the best
That you carry yourself with true respect?

Pissing all over your ego's flame
I strive to do my own thing
An internal furnace fuels this dream
And only dead fish swim with the stream
