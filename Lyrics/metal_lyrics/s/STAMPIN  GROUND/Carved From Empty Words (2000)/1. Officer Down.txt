When reason dies behind closed doors
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
It's time to fear what we should respect
It's time to question cause and effect
Striking with impunity
Hiding behind flags of immunity

When corruption rears its ugly head
The force of law becomes a farce
Personal ambition usurps justice
The rich protected at the expense of the poor
Would you sit on the fence, take no chance?
As those batons fall, turn a blind eye

In an ideal world
There'd be no need for law
No need for police
But in a society so sick
So obsessed with blind greed
Someone has to protect
The old and the weak

Officer down

Can we really afford to be so selectively blind?
If we dig too deep what would we find?
At authority's heart beats a dollar sign
Under such a regime we're all doing time
Striking with impunity
Hiding behind flags of immunity

Never say, you weren't warned
When they come to drag you away
To silence the dissident hiding in us all
They clench the fist of ordained might
From which side of the barbed wire
Do you want to see your life pass by?

When reason dies behind closed doors
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
It's time to fear what we should respect
It's time to question
Cause and effect
Who teaches the teachers?
Who makes laws for lawmakers?
When they read us our rights
What about human rights?
