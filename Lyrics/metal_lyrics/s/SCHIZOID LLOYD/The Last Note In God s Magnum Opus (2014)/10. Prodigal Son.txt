I'm irrelevant
to your space and time
I am all the lonely people
you shot me into the stars
now I can't come down
your calls are answered by laughter
may we find our peace
yeah this life is all I have which I don't mind
though I wander about the river
old we grow instead
go back to the land and reclaim your fangs and horns
vengeance will be yours
it will be sweet
the storm is comin'
the storm is comin'
you will be the one walking on skulls
on a red carpet painted with their names in blood
go back to the land and reclaim your fangs and horns
