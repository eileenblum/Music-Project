in between love and living corpses
here I lay sacrificed
newborn on the river shore
the ferryman predicts a storm
one they've never seen before
new heights to explore
newborn has fangs and horns
parented by swindler whores
providing them with the enemy
uniting them with blasphemy
demon, poke it with a stick
give it a little kick
chain it and lock it up
how to tame the beast
go get the highest priest
to teach it some manners
Christmas eve it was lost and found
they said it was special
so now at the start everything falls apart
