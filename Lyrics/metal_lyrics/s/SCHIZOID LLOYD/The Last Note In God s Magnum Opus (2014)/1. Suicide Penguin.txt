hunger for knowledge
my life had just begun
but I discovered
I was born to be reincarnated into
dying echoes of the
last note in God's magnum opus
music for the clowns
hunger to separate me from the beasts
devoured dinner
I consumed to be evaporated into
dying echoes of the
last note in God's magnum opus
music for the hounds
I said goodbye to everyone but you
I say hello, hello my love
my unreasonable war
run me away
my echo will stay
for the zombies
we will never let you go
purgatorial cleansing of false habits
run me away
sever the brain for love
I will enslave you with these chains of freedom
Gloria hallelujah
baby baby I love you
baby baby I love you so
baby baby don't leave me
baby baby don't you dare to leave me
don't you leave me
don't you leave me
don't you ever leave me
because how in hell am I supposed to
dance to the shattered illusions
I'm a circumstantial being
these shackles kneel me to the sun
rise baby rise
gimme gimme gimme the light
oh baby burn burn
burn me alive
and if you go under
I'll be waiting for you all night long
I was feeding on a spark
now I'm starving in the dark
so I'm running to the edge of the world
I forgot my way back home
three magic mountains sirened me a song
I need to buy my way in
I need wings to fly my suicide penguin
the devil smiles while saving my ass
he says, father the son, gangnam style
I said goodbye to everyone but you
