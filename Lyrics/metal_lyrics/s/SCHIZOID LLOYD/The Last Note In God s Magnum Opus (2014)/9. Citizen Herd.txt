kneel to the citizen herd
let them fly to a chocolate world
keep the real one to yourself
squeal for a pretty girl
multiply her
infiltrate the barbarian horde
gobble down their consecrated wine
feed the turkey to your kids
corrupt the ones we love to go higher
peel our elephant skin and make us warm
abandon the ship to defend the ship
higher and higher
feel our elephant skin escape us
flying into silence
don't go too close to the sun
all aboard
destination overboard
and in the end we shine for those who we have blinded
just a little bit too late
they don't care
