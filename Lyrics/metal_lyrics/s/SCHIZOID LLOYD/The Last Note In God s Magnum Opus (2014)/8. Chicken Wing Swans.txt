a chicken on the assembly line feathers plucked and upside down
lived for what you wanted it to be so it could lay some eggs
from wreck Hope the parasite searches for a new host
a salary so ridiculously high it can afford your outcries
like God
receiving rituals so alien they leave Him cold
hunter, butcher, pacifist
chewing on chicken wings
fire, go back to the caves
what do we want, will we be saved
trying not to lose it but we are lit
an expectation to which we kneel and pray for liberation
dead ants in a jar of honey
the last soul still fixed on money
one color policy
true colors underneath
fire, go back to the caves
what do we want, will we be saved
trying not to lose it but we are lit
trying not to lose it in movies, in books and music
I'm lost in you
forgive me for what I have to say
all I ever knew was love
I am dead
crying over you
all I ever was was love
hunter, butcher, pacifist
chewing on chicken wings
