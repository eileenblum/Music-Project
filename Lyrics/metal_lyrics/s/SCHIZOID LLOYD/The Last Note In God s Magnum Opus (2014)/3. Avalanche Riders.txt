my flight is going down
I'm meek as a lamb
'cause it's all right
it's all right
my slipstream will swallow all
it's part of the plan
so it's all right
it's all right
babies born
inside of a deep rabbit hole
at the end of the rabbit soul
reinventing the wheel, then the wall
excuse this inconvenience
and so we shall summon the
contagious regulator
avalanche riders
roaming around the empty space
in our time
meaningless whys
avalanche riders
because we quantify
