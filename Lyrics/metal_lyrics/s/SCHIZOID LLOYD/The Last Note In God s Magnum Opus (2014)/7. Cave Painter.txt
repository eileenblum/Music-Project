there
beautiful life just passing by
no one knows
in it the universe implodes
the moment dissolves
filling an empty cup with time
we preserve best if we are not
there
all of the lifeboats passing by
no one knows
I am behind the waterfall
I am too high
this is where I will die
my love
I'll be on the walls
for someone that will end up in here
