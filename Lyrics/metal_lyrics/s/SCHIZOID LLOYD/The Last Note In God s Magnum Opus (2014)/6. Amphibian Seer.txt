your ass is a volcano
we are planet Pompeii
Apocalypse me
yes I'm a dreamer
but I'm not the only one
sailing the wreck Hope
you are the wolf tornado
we've built our house from straw and sticks
party till the dawn
I am a frog
why don't you turn the heat up
you sneeze the killer virus
we bless you by the God we made
Apocalypse me
see all the people living life in peace
sailing the wreck Hope
your sperm is a tsunami
we're sittin' on the dock of the bay
wasting time
party till the dawn
millions of frogs are falling from the sky
feed the streets with burning hell
in flames we're freed
His revolution will be answered to us
when we crawl away disabled
there's nothing out there
till we crawl away disabled
party until the dawn
until we all crawl ablaze
what have I done?
new school eschatology
its prophet is me
sailing the wreck Hope
machines are marching over the border
we are distorted
