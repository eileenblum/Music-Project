stuck in a movie
my character has been given to me
my abyss, ignorant bliss
milked dry oversold no string puppet show
the cliche choir singing hymns to the overflow
twice its capacity is only a formality
everybody listen to the self fulfilling prophecy
ants in a death mill,
trapped in a free will,
sight as a blind skill,
living on a suicide pill
waiting for the kill
waiting for the show to show the top of the bill
stuck in a freakshow
my character has been given to know
my abyss, ignorant bliss
we wear the worn out shoes of periphery guards
parading cash-cow can't-lose infinite war
drenched in the gut-wrench stench of repentance
revenge is the sentence
the stain is the core
I breathe in it's fumes
I spit it out in tunes about love and zombies
whatever the muse
before my back gives way under the weight of the skies
Atlas, my brother, don't you realize
are you still here or have you gone
give me a sign of me now
do I remember you or someone else
