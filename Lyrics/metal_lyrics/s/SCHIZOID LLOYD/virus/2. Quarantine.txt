Sad for all what's left behind 
Sad for all the buried minds 
Paying for the wasted trials 
Counting on each otherâs strength at our funeral 
Living alone with our fascination 
Our fascinating dreams 
Our fascinating memories so 
Now it is time for... 

Sad for all the waste of time 
Sad for our share in crime 
Wasting all the brilliant notions 
Needles filled with gold feed all the narcotic minds 
Living alone with our fascination 
Our fascinating dreams 
Our fascinating memories so 
Now it is time for a revolution 
Revolution

So now it is time for a... 

Drowning between our separation and despair 
Living with everlasting dreams tied up to a chair 
Begging for a single view as result of all that's gone 
So now it's time for a revolution 
So now it's time for a... 

Earning most wanted credits by raping each other's souls 
Laziness as ingredient for attention drawing fools 
Moving on batteries when the new world order arrives 
So now it's time for a revolution 
So now it's time for you
