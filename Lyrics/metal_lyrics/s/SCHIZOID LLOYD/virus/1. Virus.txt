Virus of 
Self-destruction 
Plundering 
Acquiring 
Possessing and 
Consuming land 
We came to make you sick 

Searching for truth 
Your lies are first in line 
Finding myself 
Comfortable and satisfied 
Cause i don't know is not good enough 

(Now I want more) 
even when I have quite enough 
(Now give me more) 
My past is lifting me up to the sun 
(I want to be on the top of a pyramid) 
We are building you a pyramid 

Tell them what to do 
Tell them how they can break through you 

Make me afraid 
And I want you to get rid of all their lies 
And what the hell, get rid of them aswell 
(I'll bring you war, I'm starting to get bored) 
The more for me the more for you 

Tell them what to do 
Tell them how they can break through you 

How? 
You will never fall
