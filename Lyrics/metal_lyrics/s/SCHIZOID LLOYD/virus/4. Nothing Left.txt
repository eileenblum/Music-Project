Take all you need, escape, and run away from me 
We want you, to make us strong 
A heavenly touch will force you to 
Leave your dying thoughts buried, buried in your home 
Shining futures, make a vow 
You're free to go you're free to shout 

Shining futures, make a vow 
You're free to go you're free to 
Dream about a pioneer and stories from his world 
Telling you; continue smiling till your mind is filled 
Fool of glory full of life 
Pushing you to make you move 
You have to live before you 

Go where the air is forcing you to breathe 
Run âcause the wind is blowing on your feet 

Heal yourself from your past 
A heavenly touch before youâre lost 
Fool of glory full of life 
Pushing you to make you fly 
You have to live before you die 

Thereâs nothing left just a peaceful death 
After years of wasting your time 
You have fought for a peaceful death 
Filled with empty bottles after years of wasting your time 
After years of wasting your time
