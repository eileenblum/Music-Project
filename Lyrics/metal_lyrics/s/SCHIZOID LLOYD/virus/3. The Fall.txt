Pieces of gold are flowing through your broken wings 
The past left you behind (we make you cry) begging orders down below 
Patched with million dollar plasters, bleeding to death 

You are what you're told, ambition, greed, get in control 
Youâre never realized (frozen in our headlights) bounded by the road 
A million dollar parachute but you donât feel like putting it on 

Youâre crying for a song, a song that takes you on, 
On a dream that lasts forever, heading for the sun 
You slowly flow away, away from your fate 
Circles are million parachutes too late 
Now let me take your fear, your fear to return, 
Your fear to forget everything you've learned 

Now I want you to jump, and say the birds goodbye, before it's too late, Before I will take your time 
(Iâm gonna jump, goodbye to you, Iâll be living one more time) 
Now let me take your fear, your fear to return, your fear to forget Everything you've learnt 
(Patched with million dollar plasters, bleeding to death) 

A million dollar parachute but, you donât feel like putting it on 

The past you left behind, causing one more to find 
Now let me take your fear, your fear to return, your fear to forget, Everything you've learned
