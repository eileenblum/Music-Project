Ordinary life ordinary people 
Every time you look outside 
Everything will stay this fucking way 
Until the day you die 

Nothing much to do in your little world 
Nobody's gonna rescue you 
Wandering each day 
Nothing to say 
There's only one escape 

Shame went down the drain 
Apathy wrapped around you 
Like a spider's web 
Becoming a piece of shit 
Yeah you would do anything 
For another hit 

The walls are closing in 
You don't want to get out 
Screw everyone 
Fuck every sin 
You're not listening 
Trying to make sure 
The moment comes again 

Every time a little more to reach the same height as before 

Reaching your goal 
Preaching the alcohol 
You'll see everything will be 
Spinning around the absence of your battered soul
