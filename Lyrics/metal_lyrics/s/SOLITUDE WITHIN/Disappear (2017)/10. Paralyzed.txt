I remember us dying
Slowly fading
Waiting to die
In my dreams you are so real
It's leaving me empty, lost and breathless
Can you feel me
'Cause I can feel you now
I can't take it
I have to heal somehow

You paralyze me
Tearing me up and dragging me down
Paralyze me
Killing me slowly
Dragging me down

I surrender, stop trying
Could you go now, leave me somehow?
I can't run, I cannot kill you
It's leaving me hopeless, cold and restless
Can you feel me
Because I can feel you now
I can't take it
I have to heal somehow
