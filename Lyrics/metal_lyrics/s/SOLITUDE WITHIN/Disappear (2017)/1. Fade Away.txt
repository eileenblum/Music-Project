How can evil be so close
How can your heart be so frozen
All they do is bring you down
Are we better off alone?
All I see are memories
Let them fade away
Same old story â agony
Let them fade away

How many times have you left me broken
How many tears did you make me cry
So many lies, many words unspoken
Fade away

I won't drown, I will not break
I'm alive, I am awake
You're so close I can feel you
Am I the only one seeing all these memories?
Let them fade away
Same old story â enemy
Let them fade away

How many times have you left me broken
How many tears did you make me cry
So many lies, many words unspoken
