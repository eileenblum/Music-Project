Running for her life
Gasping for air
Those times of despair
In the silence of the cold dark night
I'll gather the strength to keep me sane

Turn away
There's no escape
There's nothing left here
Turn away
Do I have to run or stay

Running for your life
Isn't this fair?
His eyes of despair
There's no silence in the cold dark night
I've gathered the strength to cause you pain

Turn away
There's no escape
There's nothing left here
Turn away
Do I have to run or stay
