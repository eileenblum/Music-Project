Speaking the words
Silently
Searching for answers you won't understand
Violently
You're pulling me down
There's nowhere to hide
To run from you, run from you
Under your spell
Burning in hell
Heaven please save me

I'm alone in the dark
Hiding from you
I'm alone in the dark
Fighting the truth

Silence again
I can't breathe
Searching for reasons no one understands
I can't leave
You're pulling me down
There's nowhere to hide
To run from you, run from you
Down on my knees
Still want to believe
Heaven please save me

I'm alone in the dark
Hiding from you
I'm alone in the dark
Fighting the truth

Speaking the words
Silently
Searching for answers you won't understand
Violently
You're pulling me down
There's nowhere to hide
To run from you, run from you
Under your spell
Burning in hell
Heaven please save me

I'm alone in the dark
Hiding from you
I'm alone in the dark
Fighting the truth
