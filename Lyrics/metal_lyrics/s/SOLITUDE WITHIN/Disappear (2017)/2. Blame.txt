We don't care
We won't change
It's in our blood, it's in our heart
Can't kill it
They can't tear it apart
So terribly violent
Calling names and using words
To hurt us
To let us know they're sublime

We're the others
We're more than you can see
We're the fighters
They won't bring us down

See the inside
Feel the pain
Escaping life and you're to blame
See the inside
Feel the pain
You're to blame

We won't hide
We won't break
They're all around but we are strong
Can't hurt us
They're no longer sublime
So terribly violent
Calling names and using words
To break us
To cross another line

We're the others
We're more than you can see
We're the fighters
They won't bring us down

See the inside
Feel the pain
Escaping life and you're to blame
See the inside
Feel the pain
You're to blame
