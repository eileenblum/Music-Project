Couldn't find a reason
Couldn't find you anywhere
Such a big decision
But nothing I can't bear
Never leave
I can't believe you are here to care
Always there, you're everywhere
You're around
And I'll

Fly
We'll never be broken again
Fly

I would search forever if I could find you there
No, I wish for nothing
Because nothing can compare to you
Nothing can compare
Never leave
I can't believe
You are here to care
Always there, you're everywhere
You're around
And I'll

Fly
We'll never be broken again
Fly


There's no other way
You must be in heaven
No reason to stay
I can't be alone

Fly
We'll never be broken again
Fly
