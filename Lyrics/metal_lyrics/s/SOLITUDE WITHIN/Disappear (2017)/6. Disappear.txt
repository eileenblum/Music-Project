Giving you a reason to believe in me
Maybe you look but you don't really see
I'm here without a reason
And when you go to bed
I will sing melodies and whisper in your head
I will be the pain inside

By stop loving me you made me disappear
Why don't you ever learn?
Sitting right here
Sitting next to you and you don't feel me near
You hurt me
You made me disappear

Told you I was coming for you
Now I'm here
You will have regret but it's too late my dear
I'm here to make you shiver
I'm here to let you know
I will be the pain inside

By stop loving me you made me disappear
Why don't you ever learn?
Sitting right here
Sitting next to you and you don't feel me near
You hurt me
You made me disappear
