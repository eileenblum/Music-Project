My soul burns
Think this is my doom
The devil turns
A candle lights up the room
My hands are getting cold
He was my friend
For one more day he gave me a soul a could lend
There was smoke I could smell
At the moment I knew my soul would fly to hell
Heaven or hell, is it different the same?
I have the light inside
It's my eternal flame

Will you be my light in the dark
Will you be my shadow in the sun
Will you be my guardian angel
Will you be my light in the dark
When I'm about to run
When I'm about to run

I could hear my footsteps when I was walking
Voices in my head intensively talking
So I felt less lonely, less deserted
You can no longer save me
There were two doors
One heaven, one hell
I followed the devil that went to the door where the smell was hiding
Behind the doors demons were still deciding
Heaven or hell, is it different the same?
I have the light inside
It's my eternal flame

Will you be my light in the dark
Will you be my shadow in the sun
Will you be my guardian angel
Will you be my light in the dark
When I'm about to run
When I'm about to run
