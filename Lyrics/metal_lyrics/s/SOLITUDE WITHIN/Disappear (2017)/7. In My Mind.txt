Feeling it all again
Living a lie, live in denial
We can't do this
We will fight
Beaten down on the ground
Are we too lost to be found?
We will stand and fight

In my mind
This can't go on
This can't be right
Ice cold tears
This can't go on
Stand up and fight

Trying to find myself
I'm not alive, not even trying
Have to end this
Bring the light again
Late at night you come home
And you're too lost to be found
Just another night

In my mind
This can't go on
This can't be right
Ice cold tears
This can't go on
Stand up and fight

Falling rising
On and on again
Promising breaking
This can't go on and on
Tried to make myself believe you'll change
No more pain
Bruises and colors
Denial seems so close again

In my mind
This can't go on
This can't be right
Ice cold tears
This can't go on
Stand up and fight
