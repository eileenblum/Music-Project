She is the darkness in disguise
She's deadly as she flies
Black raven with cold eyes
Tracking them down
No mercy, all the same
Remember this name

On your knees
The darkness hides and sees
All those lies
On your knees
The darkness hides and sees
All those lies

How could she ever forgive?
How could she let him live?
There was no sign of attraction
Only rejection
No mercy all the same
Remember this name

On your knees
The darkness hides and sees
All those lies
On your knees
The darkness hides and sees
All those lies

Thy shall lose the battle
Feeding on his soul
Shall never love again
In silence we will part
Forever in denial
For thy shall be forgotten
Doomed to live in solitude
The weakness revealed

On your knees
The darkness hides and sees
All those lies
On your knees
The darkness hides and sees
All those lies
