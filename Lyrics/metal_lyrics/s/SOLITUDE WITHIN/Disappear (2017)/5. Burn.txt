When darkness falls
And you're all alone
When screams won't be heard
I'll tear you apart
Under my spell you will whisper my name
You'll reach the ground
I will make you insane
You'll long for me
You'll worship me
You'll dream of me
You'll kneel for me

You will give up
If I let you down
You'll see my face, hear my voice all the time
I'll make you burn
I'll make you see
I am enough, no one's better than me

When daylight comes
And I won't be home
Your screams will be heard
You'll be on your own
Heaven won't save you
You'll drown in your tears
I long for the sound of your sorrow and pain
You'll long for me
You'll worship me
You'll dream of me
You'll kneel for me

You will give up
If I let you down
You'll see my face, hear my voice all the time
I'll make you burn
I'll make you see
I am enough, no one's better than me
