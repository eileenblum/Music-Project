Never again I'll walk this surface
Open your mind lights struck before
These eyes I'm finding my way through
Darkness and sunlight wherever you'll be
There's no need to hide your face

I'm gonna spread my wings
And let them carry me away

I might just lie there for a while
And for one moment touch the sky
And never see through darkened eyes
Never again

What can I do, the truth affects me
I'm leaving my mind, my final destiny
I'm falling asleep and I want you to sit
By my side lost in a world
Grace my eternity
