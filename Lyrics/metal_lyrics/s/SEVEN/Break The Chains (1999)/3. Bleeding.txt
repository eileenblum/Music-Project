I'm going through changes
But I felt the same way a long time ago
It's this time or never
I will make it stronger than ever before

Some are slaves behind their numbers
And some take shelter in their time
But I've got no time to spare

Bleeding... I kill myself to stay alive
Bleeding... out the poison in my veins
Bleeding... I kill myself to stay alive
Bleeding...

You're free to speak
Every word that may come to your mind
But I just don't care
Cause I'm not another invented disease

Many men were here before me
But I don't need to follow them
And I always stand in the end

I will carry on my way I won't follow any rules
And if the wind will catch our sails I won't be the one to complain
And I won't take any blame for following an easy ride
Cause I've been down this road before when all was a wasteland
