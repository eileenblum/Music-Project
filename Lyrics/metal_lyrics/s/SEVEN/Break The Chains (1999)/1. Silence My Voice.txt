Make my voice a crime - I will cry out louder
Silence my voice - I will create a new one
Make my signs a crime - I will hold them higher
Silence my voice - ten will raise to take my place

Silence my voice - but my words will live forever
Silence my voice - but my words will live forever

There comes a time to take back what was mine
When our colours're waving in the wind
I will never give in - we will never give in
We just play it out louder like many did before
And nothing can stop us, cause there comes many more
We just play it out louder like many did before
And nothing can stop us, cause there comes many more

Every day I seek ways to convince them
That it's still not too late to react
And I think to myself - what a wonderful day
When we'll throw them all away
