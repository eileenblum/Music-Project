In my own dreams I would live here forever
If I could make all I did undone
What can I say to those who stood by me
Well I can hardly see them again
I know it's too late for you to forgive me
Though I regret everything I did
I feel like I'm screaming but nobody hears me
They wouldn't care anyway

Was it worth all pain, I'm crying in the wind
I must answer myself everyday
Was it worth all pain, I'm crying in my sleep
And my conscience will never be clear

All of a sudden my eyes saw new places
Calling me now and I know it's time
To reach for tomorrow, and leave all behind me
A place so far away from myself
I open the gate to a whole new dimension
Finding my last call has to be made
Never again I'll live by their side
Building new strength not to stand in their line

I will always remember this day
Breaking their limits, no reason to stay
I'm leaving the place where I used to belong
And finally starting my journey home
