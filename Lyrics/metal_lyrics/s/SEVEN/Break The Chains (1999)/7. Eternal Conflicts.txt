And the eternal way of the world
Seems to be a neverending wheel of confrontations
There's always someone to rule the game
And taking shares from the ones who can't
Defend their landmarks

Now the world is still in motion
And the shores are open wide
There's always someone to fight them one by one
To conquer new lands, fulfilling their plans to rule forever

I don't think anyone in this world
Can be the judge of what is right or wrong in man's behavior
So don't come preaching, don't need your truth
It seems like conflicts always have been around since dawn of time

Still the world is spinning around
And the shores are burning bright
Time never changes, they're never turning back
Convincing new minds
That now is the time to rule eternally
