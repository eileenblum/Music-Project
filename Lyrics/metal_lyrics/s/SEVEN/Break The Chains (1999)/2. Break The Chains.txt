Hear the old songs in the night
With words you weren't allowed to hear
See pride returning to their faces
They're dancing their forbidden dance

To the sound of the drum
Beating feet to the ground
And each step is another nearer the end
They will change the world
When their voice will be heard
And they know it is time to do it now

Break the chains of silence - hear the drums in the night
No walls in the world can stop them
'Cause they're gonna make them fall

The ground is shaking to the sound
Of hundred men when morning comes
That morning I'll be one of them
And show the world who I am

If you tell me to wait like you've told me before
It will soon be too late
