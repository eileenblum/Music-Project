[Bonus Track]Little girl gives me the eye
I breathe a sigh
And change the course
Tears from the martyred sky
Along the path
Where grows a rose

Never settled my own score
All the thorns reach to the core

Girl in green averts her eyes
She breaths a sigh
Changes course
Tears from the martyred sky
Along the path
Where grows a rose

Never settled my own score
All the thorns reach to the core

[Ref.:]
Hands are torn
Like rags from a doll
And lips mourn
On coming winter's call
Endless path
There grows a rain-kissed rose
For each time
That my love was lost

Never settled my own score
All the thorns reach to the core

[Ref.]
