War within, this war inside
Never lets you touch the sky
Burn within and die without
Ever reaching from the fire

Never let it get out side
That's where the riddle lies
Something tears your mind
The war within you hide

War within and fear inside
Never leaves you for a while
Drown within and die without
Ever getting from the mire

Don't walk it by your side
Don't feed your inner lies
battle in your mind
The Jekyll and the Hyde

[Ref.:]
Never free to cry out
The gate always shut
There 're no words to pray
You lose and you win
Always plunder all within
There's nothing to gain

War within, this war inside
Never lets you touch the sky
Burn within and die without
Ever reaching from the fire

Never let it get outside
That's where the riddle lies
Something tears your mind
The war within you hide
