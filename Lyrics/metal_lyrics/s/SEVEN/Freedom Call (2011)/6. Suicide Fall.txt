Fall
From the rotten river bridge
See no sky, see no day, see no light
Fall
From the picture that you stitch
See no ground, see no dark, see no night

Fall
And sink like stone or lead
Can't be yours, can't be mine, failing tread
Fall
Stars shooting through my head
Can't believe, can't forget, I go mad

[Ref.:]
Falling
Slowly
Knowing
I'm never gonna fly
Never hear your cry
Falling
Lonely
Fading
You knew I couldn't stay
I wanna get away

Fall
And sink like stone or lead
Can't be yours, can't be mine, failing tread
Fall
Stars shooting through my head
Can't believe, can't forget, I go mad

[Ref.]

I've seen the sky fall down 
I never said you'll be mine... Yeaaaah!

[Ref. 2x]
