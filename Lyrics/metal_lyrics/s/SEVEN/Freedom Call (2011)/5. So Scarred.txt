You're so scarred
And still you're waiting
For things that won't come
No-one cared
You took the beating
Damage has been done

I am scarred
And pass upon you
All my pain and dread
No-one cared
When I was losing
Everything I had

[I Ref.:]
Cry my name!
There is nothing you can say
Cry my name!
All the scars forever stay

You're so scarred
And still you're waiting
For things that won't come
No-one cared
You took the beating
Damage has been done

[II Ref.:]
Cry my name!
Only children's tears remain
Cry my name!
It will start over again

Oooooh!
Oooooh! Yeah!
