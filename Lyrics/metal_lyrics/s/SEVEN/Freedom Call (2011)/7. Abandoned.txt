I can feel your hand in mine
When all faces just simply turned away
Hold me, for the scorn can hurt and maim

I can feel your, arms 'round mine
When I was left behind as blind and lame
Hold me now and nothing stays the same

All the countless rooms
Howling emptiness!

I can see your face near mine
When all favours just simply turned away
Hold me, for I'm full of deepest shame

I can see your eyes meet mine
When I was left behind - it was the same
Hold me now and don't forget my name
The deserted space
Yawning emptiness!

[Ref.:]
You are here, you 're here with me
In your eyes myself I see
You take my hand

You are here, you're here with me
In your eyes the world I see
You take a stand

The deserted space
Yawning emptiness!

[Ref. 2x]
