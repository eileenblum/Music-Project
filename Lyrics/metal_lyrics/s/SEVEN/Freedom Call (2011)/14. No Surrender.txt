[Bonus Track]Come the winter, come the flame
No more fear within
Memories get lost today
I never give in

I'm alive, I'm on my way
As the night gets old
No surrender, no dismay
Hands are growing cold

[Ref.:]
How much to pay it?
Lift your head and say
You live every day
Every day!

Come the winter, come the flame
No more fear within
Memories get lost today
I never give in

I'm alive, I'm on my way
As the night gets old
No surrender, no dismay
Hands are growing cold
