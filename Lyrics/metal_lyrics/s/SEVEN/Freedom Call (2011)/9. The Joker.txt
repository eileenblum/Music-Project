Let me see you gamble now
Never pray
Let me see your hollow sight
In the game

Let me play with your torn mind
Cannot say
If you're thirsty through the night
That's the game

[I Ref.:]
Gamble away
All your reason's way
Your own life and your own name
I can bet you'll stay

Let the hunger tear you down
Never pray
At the table feel my might
In the game

[II Ref.:]
Lose your way
You're ready to pay
The game is what you crave
The risk makes you frail
Don't apologize
You'll pay the price
As you know!

Don't apologize
Now you are the prize
Lost your pride, lost your shame
Lost your life and lost your worthless name
All the bets fail and all will end the same

[II Ref.:]
Lose your way
You're ready to pay!
The game is chat your crave
The risk makes you frail

Don't apologize
You'll pay the price
As you know!
