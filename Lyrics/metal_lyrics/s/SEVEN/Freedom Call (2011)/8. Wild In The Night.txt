No words to tell
See what's in the endless night
No words to tell
Glassy stars are shining bright

Now scream and yell
You know it's perfectly right
Now scream and yell
Free to laugh and free to fight

[Ref.:]
The wine and scent and sway
What you gonna say?
All the senses have gone wild
Until the morning light

Now all is well
We have the right to be wild
Now all is well
The hangover should be mild

[Ref.]

[Ref. 2x]
