See the nights fly like a crazy
All the time I had was left behind
I have always been lazy
I was left alone, I can't deny

[Ref.:]
Need no help
So you can go to hell
I can stand myself
I don't need any help!

Need no help you hear me say!
So you can go to hell
I can stand myself!

I won't be pushing up the daisies
Not any time soon, keep that on mind
Your tears and help I do not fancy
I can rise myself from the ground

[Ref. x2]
