The world is getting hazy
"and you know it's very late"
I'm just a little crazy
"so you think you'll get away"
Living in my brain
makes me feel so desperate
Eating up my brain
deep inside I'm never safe

Strap me to the table
"you can't kill me anyway"
Mentally unstable
"I'm the king of disarray"
Flowing in my veins
tiger who is never tame
Drinking from my veins
Life will never be the same

[Ref.:]
Hide away
I won't see another day
Made my plans to escape
So my pain could fade away
I ain't here to stay	.
I'm too weak to play your game
Made my plans to escape
so my soul can break away

Can't you hear me screaming
"no way because no one cares"
Hope I'm only dreaming
"you can't reach me anywhere"
I can't kill my twin
I'm the one who'll never win
My invisible twin
a brain eater that lives within

[Ref.:]
You'll never beat me, no
Cos I'm a part of you
You'll never beat me, no
Cos I'm a part of you
You'll never beat me, no
Cos I'm a part of you

Please come save me
Please come save me

The world is getting hazy
"and you know it's very late"
I'm just a little crazy
"so you think you'll get away"
Living in my brain
makes me feel so desperate
Eating up my brain
deep inside I'm never safe

[Ref.]
