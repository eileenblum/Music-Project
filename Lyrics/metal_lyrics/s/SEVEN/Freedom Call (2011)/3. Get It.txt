I See myself
Don't know what I've done
Eyes hurt badly
Gazing to the sun
I don't get it
I don't get it
Guilty all the same

I lost my sight
Don't know where to go
Heart beats fast
But the blood-flow's slow
Don't you get it?
Don't you get it?
Guilty all the way

Learn the hard way
After all I've done
Bones are frozen
The winter has come
I don't get it
I don't get it
Guilty all the same

Learn to feel
What others did feel
Cut and bleed
And suffer for real
Don't you get it?
Don't you get it?
Guilty all the way

[Ref.:]
Guilty thoughts won't go away
All that gets under their sway
Will lose the spin
I can't sleep and I can't think
Can't see sense in anything
Butterfly on a pin
What's my sin?

I lost myself
Don't know what to do
The Lane of Shame
That I'm running through
I don't get it
I don't get it
Guilty all the same

I see my hands
Don't know what to take
Limbs feel numb
Drowning in a lake
Don't you get it?
Don't you get it?
Guilty all the way

[Ref.]

[Ref. x2]

Learn to feel
What others did feel
Cut and bleed
And suffer for real
Don't you get it?
Don't you get it?
Guilty all the way
