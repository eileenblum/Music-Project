There is a secret hidden trail
The only hope to hide away
For thousand times you've been astray
Too scared to ever try...

So many times been walloped down
Biting the dust, face in the ground
Heard mocking laughter of the Death
Or seen their blood stained all around

[Ref.:]
When you hear the freedom call
all the tides just binding you more

Another batch of hollow pain
Remember of the hidden trail
Grab all the guts, oh, to reluct
Get on the way just if you dare

[Ref.:]
When you hear the freedom call
all the tides just binding you more

Save the time, quit the wail
Break the bounds and find the trail
No-one will see you pale, ooh

[Ref.:]
When you hear the freedom call
all the tides just binding you more
