See you here
See you there
You are gone
My bones bare

Can't forgive
Can't forfeit
You are gone
Love to hate

Broken teeth
Shattered smile
You are gone
Can't deny

I can't speak
I can't breathe
You are gone
How I'll live?

Dice is thrown
I can't scream
You are gone
That's no dream

Raspy voice
Feverish eyes
You are gone
With your lies

[I Ref.:]
You
Have gone astray
Now come what may
You steal my breath
Hey!
You've broken the scale
Can't get away
You steal my breath

See you here
See you there
You are gone
My bones bare

Can't forgive
Can't forfeit
You are gone
Love to hate

Broken teeth
Shattered smile
You are gone
Can't deny

[II Ref.:]
I
Have gone astray
I have to stay
You steal my breath
Hey!
I've broken the scale
You get away
You steal my breath

In every way
Gone astray
Make me stay
I've broken the scale
Please do stay
Stay today
