[Japanese bonus track]

In my eyes you're a giant,
The keeper of all the keys,
Different but compliant
A God for someone like me

Learned to read what you're thinking...
Suffering every moment left alone...
Tamed the beast deep within me...
Sleep in peace friend, cause I am guarding...

When I'm not howling at the bright new moon
The burning flame within, my own kin, and
Every night I hear something out there calling me
Reminding me, friend, to know, that I'm not your child...

I follow when you lead, and do what you command,
But there is something that is out of my hand
It's my own nature, appetite, I am a creature of the night

I am howling at the bright new moon...

Bright new moon, brings the light in my life
One more day and you must let me go...

Here I am howling at the bright new moon
The burning flame within, my own kin, and
Every night I heard something out here calling me
Reminding me, friend, to know, I'm not your child...

I am howling out there
At the bright new burning flame, within my heart
Every night I hear something out there,
Telling me I'm not your child
