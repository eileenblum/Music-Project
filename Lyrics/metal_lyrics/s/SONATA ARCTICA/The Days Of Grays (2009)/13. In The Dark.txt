[Bonus Track]I'm from where the magic is
I'll give you what I cannot take away with me
And the sunlit day and moon
I wanna have a silent kiss, I wanna make you mine,
I'm thinking how...
can't leave me now
Stay with me somehow

You come from where the fire is,
you give me what you couldn't burn the last time
One sunless day and moon
I wanna be so close to you,
see whatever scars you carry within your broken heart,
Mine's your missing part

Come with me, where the magic is,
there's more than light we could share
We could join the sun and moon if you want to

Be my lifeline for this lifetime, suffer in pleasure forever and ever
I'd like to see how the walls around your heart will fall apart...
Stop resisting, let the light in, suffer in pleasure forever and ever
...for this one lifetime

Let me take you where the magic is,
back in time,
Remember the light, of the cold December moon
I wanna have a silent kiss, I wanna make you mine,
I'm thinking you can't leave me now
Stay with me somehow
Stay with me somehow

Come with me where the magic is,
there is more than light we can share
We could own the sun and moon

Be my lifeline for this lifetime, suffer in pleasure forever and ever
I'd like to see how the walls around your heart will fall apart.
Stop resisting, let the light in, suffer in pleasure forever and ever
...for this one lifetime

(Be my lifeline for this lifetime, suffer in pleasure forever and ever
Stop resisting, let the light in... oh, oh... for this one lifetime)

I am feeling your face in the dark
I'm hearing you breathe in the dark
I am tasting your lips in the dark
I'm holding you close in the dark

I'll take you where the magic is
I'll give you everything I I only can offer
You can have my broken midnight moon
If you give me your broken heart
And I will give you something real and golden.
We can make this life the finest art...

I come from where the magic is
I'd give you what I could take away with me
And a sunlit day and moon
I wanna have a silent kiss I wanna make you mine,
I'm thinking you can't leave me now
Stay with me somehow

I am feeling your face in the dark
I'm hearing you breathe in the dark
I am tasting your lips in the dark
I'm holding you close in the dark
