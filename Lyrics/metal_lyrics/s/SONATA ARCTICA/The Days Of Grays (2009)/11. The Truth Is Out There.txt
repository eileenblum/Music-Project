Now I am crawling in (my crawling skin)
I can't wake up anymore (can't find the door)
I try to make a deal (with myself)
to avoid the blinding door... (once again)

The party's over, the flies are back,
Unexplained. Mean and bad.
The deepest wound, still no scab.

Full HD sci-fi scream,
The time is out, mind is clean, it's blank
I'm missing a little time...

I found a truth beneath the lie
Buried deep, explain me why
The world is upside down...
I do not know a soul in here,
But i can remember the faces
And the truth is in their eyes...

Everything's mixed with gray
Say g'nite and welcome the day
cannot see hues,
So that is why the grays wear green?

I don't like this state of mind...
I can see, but I can't find it,
Horrified to see what the following two days will bring

Can I trust my own eyes?
Is that me in disguise?
Is this bliss or am I insane?

Found the thin red line of madness
Far from the Skyland Mountain...

I found a truth beneath a lie
Buried deep, explain me why
The world is upside down...
I do not know a soul in here
But I can remember the faces...
The truth is in their eyes...

Don't really want to know...
Don't want to go out there...
I feel hypnotized...
The truth is somewhere...

Wake up, I only want to wake up
Don't wanna fall asleep, but
I'm already dreaming
I feel my skin is peeling off.
What I've been concealing?
Something underneath...

My crawling skin (my crawling skin)
I can't wake up anymore (not anymore)
I've seen how this will end... (oh it will end)
Don't want to soak anymore...

The truth is out there.
Somewhere between two fairy tales,
Caught somewhere deep between someone's truth and a lie

Another really rainy morning, it's a perfect day...
I'm too tired to be hypnotized now
It's all to real for me anyway

Wake up, I only want to wake up,
Don't wanna fall asleep, but
I'm already dreaming
I feel my skin is peeling off.
What I've been concealing?
Something underneath my crawling skin...
