I take my hat off, bow before the greatness
You're so much braver I give you credit for
Somehow the Grays create a harmony
And no color can add a flavor...
I've started to feel like...

Know the face, familiar stranger
I'm not a child, I feel misunderstood
I built a bridge, you use the tunnel... now...
- The rope we are pulling is slipping away from me
All this wasted time is killing me... and I've started to feel like...

[x2]
I can not control my life anymore
Feel a need to leave and breathe on my own
I remember all the broken songs of our life
Maybe one more wrong will make it all right...
I just really need to be alone now...
