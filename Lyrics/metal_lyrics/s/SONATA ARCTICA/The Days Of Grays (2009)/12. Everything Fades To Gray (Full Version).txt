Tonight my life will lack it's meaning
One final step before we're seeing...
For once I am happy my little friend
Cannot comprehend what we are seeing

No words are needed, only a gaze, embrace...
Contact the living, remember the dead...

There is always something to learn,
Repetition proves it's worth
Without those moments, we would not remember

It's not fair, it's not fair, there was a time now...
Kneeling down, take in the moment when
Everything becomes finally clear.
It's not fair to lose it,
And how... there was a time now
But Death is cheating us somehow

Come here now...

Can't walk away, nothing to say
no need to feel so afraid,
Colors last a lifetime and fade to gray...

It's not fair, it's not fair, there was a time now...
Kneeling down, take in the moment when
Everything becomes finally clear.
It's not fair to lose it,
And how... there as a time now
But Death is cheating us somehow
...And he's already here.

"When it all ends..."
When everything fades to gray,
We dive into the darkness
Some things are needless to say...

Somethings are needless to say,
We dive into the darkness
When everything fades to gray...
