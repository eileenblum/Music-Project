[Written by Tony Kakko]

I am a man
You fell down from that apple tree
The other day with me
And now
You ask me to apologise for slowly
Crawling up from the sea?

We never seem to find
The time to sit by the fire
Under the crescent moon,
Lead a meaningful life

You ever wonder, love
If you could one day board a flying contraption
And see the world?
Without me?
Leave me behind to solve all the puzzles you have
Drawn on these walls over time

What if I could somehow store
Good memories in clouds
And fly to touch the moon
And your hand at the same time

Here I stand and look at my life
Barren, cold and incomplete
A mirror smiles at me with teary disdain
Pointing out the faults in me

Memories of holidays with you
Will rain on me from time to time
We have the road within ourselves
To countless paradises
When there is a tunnel thereâs a light,
The thought is causing tremors
On the faultline between you and I

The clouds always trail the sun
And floods put out the fires
To flush away the signs of
The loves of our lives

Here I stand and look at my life
Barren, cold and incomplete
Mirror smiles at me with a teary disdain
Pointing out all faults in me

Memories of holidays with you
Will rain on me from time to time
We are the road, the paradise,
The broken wheel of fortune
When thereâs a tunnel thereâs a light,
The thought is causing tremors
On the fault line between you and I

When Iâm without you
Am I the only human here?

Dancing on this fault lineâ¦
