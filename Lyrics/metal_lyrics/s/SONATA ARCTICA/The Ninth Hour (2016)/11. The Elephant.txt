[Exclusive Japanese Bonus Track][Written by Tony Kakko]

I know, Iâve never been to a war
And hope I never have to
see my world go up in flames
with greed nor desire

All wars be a feast of death
And the truth goes by a bodyguard of lies
They feed on our fears,
Warâs a contagion

A tiny child learned to build a wall
He has built a wall
He has sealed the door
He has been to war
He will wage war

The shortest war in recorded history took place in 1896
when Zanzibar surrendered to Britain after 38 minutes.
The longest war was the so-called 100-year war
between Britain and France.
It actually lasted 116 years, ending in 1453.
One out of every two casualties of war
is a civilian caught in the crossfire.
There are 92 known cases of nuclear bombs lost at seas.
The doors that cover the US nuclear silos
weigh 748 tons and open in 19 seconds. Wow.
About 50% of arms exports
go to non-democratic regimes.
Since 1495, no 25-year period has been without war.
Since 1815 there have beenmore than 210 interstate wars.
The NATO attack on Serbia in 1999 during
the Kosovo war killed more animals than people.
The very first bomb the Allies dropped
on Berlin in World War II killed the only
elephant in the Berlin Zoo.

Killed the only elephant in Berlin Zoo
A victim of that madness
No war ends âtill the war is won
Our template of doom

They will kill the only elephant in your town too
Blue diamond, lifeless, formless
Little Boy Blue, like his papa once too
Blood will stay on the blade

Children will learn to destroy the things they canât build

Killed the only elephant in Berlin Zoo
A victim of that madness
No war ends 'till the war is won
Our template of doom

They will kill the only elephant in your town too
Blue diamond, lifeless, formless
Little Boy Blue, like his papa once too
Blood will stay on the blade

He will go to war
He will build a wall
He will seal the door
He will end all wars
