[Written by Tony Kakko]

Fly, navigate, communicate

You remember, still,
All the words Iâve chosen wrong
The hand of time, it seems to accelerate

My hour of wolf
Morning flight will slice the sky
I would like to stay but canât today

Talking is flaunting
Silence is so taunting
The word I donât say has its own gravity

Fly, navigate, communicate
If you dare.

I will abdicate
All rights to say when things feel wrong
The gateâs closed for the day, turn, go away

Passport in one handâ¦
Exit the strange land
Things you have not plannedâ¦
Words have their meaning, like salt in the sea

For once Iâm doing things right
I wonât communicate in turbulent times,
But will navigate and fly

Iâm trying to land in the sea, but the sea is on fire
Now we have to brace for the impact,
Weâll crash in the sea of bittersweet depravity

I canât fly
I canât navigate
Refuse to communicate
oh, I tried todayâ¦

We canât fly
We canât navigate
We fail to communicate
Weâre afraid to care
