[Written by Tony Kakko]

Life is an illusion
Time a mere delusion
The cage is a creation
Of someoneâs imagination
If life makes you glow, then glow like a star
Youâre the night, youâre the day
Own the sky, live in the clouds, defy gravity

A sign, an aberration, your road down to damnation
When a restroom illustration predicts the tribulation
Let the dreams give you hope, live in a dream
Let the music flow
With your eyes closed from the vast garden of stars

Sing one rhyme,
Wait for the punch line
The notes are blind
But they know when you sing and

Smile
Life is better alive
It is a dumb thing to say,
But the fact wonât wane away
Sing with someone today
When your team makes a game winning goal,
Get ready to sing

Lalalalaaâ¦.
With a friend whoâs right beside you
Lalalalaaâ¦
With the friends beside youâ¦

Time - every light on the blue sky night will beautify
Time - cast coins in the waterfall,
Two coins, one for each eye

Time - the icy tingle of empty vapour on your hand
Time - a tiny crackâs a grand canyon in its command

Just one line,
Sing with a feeling
Turn back time
Make all your stars align

The only thing you need, the vanity of happiness
When friends align
They sing in the key ofâ¦

Life
Life is better alive
It is a dumb thing to say,
But the fact wonât wane away
Smile at someone today
If the wall smiles back youâre alive, and ready to
Sing,
Life is better alive
It is a dumb thing to say,
But the fact wonât wane away
Sing with someone today
When your team makes a game winning goal,
Get ready to sing

Lalalalalalaaaâ¦.
With a friend whoâs right beside you
Lalalalalalaaaâ¦.
With the friend beside you

Lalalalalalaaaâ¦.
It is a dumb thing to say,
But the fact wonât wane away
Lalalalalalaaaâ¦.
Life is better alive
When your team makes a game winning goal,
Get ready to sing
It is a dumb thing to say,
But your life is better alive
Life is better aliveâ¦
