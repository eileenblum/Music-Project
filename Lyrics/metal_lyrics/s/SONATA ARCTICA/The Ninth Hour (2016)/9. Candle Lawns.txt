[Written by Tony Kakko]

We were like brothers
Lives entwined
Kids who grew up together
Dreaming of the world weâd get to see one time

I found a girl and you bought a car
Seemed like that summer was over in a minute
Now itâs a fading wedding card

And so life goes on, when childhoodâs gone
The times weâve had, no words can say
And all the things we do wonât fade away
A real friendâs like a shelter on a rainy day

Tear of a widow, a hermitâs plea
Swords of an Angel King
We got to see the world in flames
before the calm

Fought like an eagle
Waited for the dove
We were the best, never knew there was a limit
But now all hell has broken looseâ¦

Need you to
Give my son my purple heart
Brother, leave me, run, donât close my eyes
My last save pointâs getting out of reach
My game is over, let me fade away

And will you tell my son
âbout the purple heart
And what it means to have him keep it today
And that he knows I smile in the clouds above
Come see me at what he calls candle lawnsâ¦
