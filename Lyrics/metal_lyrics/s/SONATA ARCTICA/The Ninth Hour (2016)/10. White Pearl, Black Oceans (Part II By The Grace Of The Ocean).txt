[Written by Tony Kakko]

Once I felt the embrace of the sea
Loved me, held me,
Once I felt so despised by eternity
Fall upon meâ¦
Itâs upon meâ¦

The waves are high above me
Thisâd be my home
Deep in the sea

Oh pain, float like a flower
The darkest sea refusing meâ¦

Music of the seven gentle tides
Fade, in distance
Darkness was a friend, leaden the candle light
Slowly healing for a fortnight
Iâm aliveâ¦

Memories;
I used to have a home in the light
But the meaningâs still escaping me
All the joy was gone along the barque, with the nameâ¦
Thereâs a face, my story in the deep dark seaâ¦

Memories, he used to have a home in the light
The life he canât remember anymore
Every night he sees the white barque in a dream
Every night adds colours to the memoryâ¦

Guiding star above the shallow sea
The grave of angels
Beacon for the ones who need to seize the night
For the last time, all onboard the
White Pearlâ¦

All onboard for the very last time
Close your eyes, oh calamity
Feel their pain for the very first time
See myself in a dream

There was a lady who was saved from
Without a name to tell, afraid to stay,

she left, the leaves were umber
My only hope, sheâs the one I have dreamt of
Follow my feelings, in her wake

Iâve become a true blight
I huddle in the daylight
Banished by my townsmen
With blood in my hands

Gallop across the moorlands
On a branded steed Iâd stolen
Building my own gallows
Grave shallowed for a thief

Across the isle with the horse I ride
Close my eyes, oh calamity
Feel this pain for the very first time
I see her eyes, like a dream

I found the lady who was saved from the ocean
Without a name to tell, afraid to stay,
she left, the leaves were umber
I wonder, if sheâs the one I had dreamt ofâ¦
Feelings get stronger in her wake

Without names to tell, afraid to stay,
we left, in rain and thunder
We ponder, if our dreams weâre all handed
Only by the grace of the sea

Memories, I used to have a home in The Light
Now we keep the far-side of the sea
And the joy we knew is still alive, trees so green
A New Face, The Beauty and the brand new meâ¦

The music of my chosen gentle tideâ¦

Turned into a story on the other side
A lone note in a lone vial
âWe are aliveâ

THE END.
