[Written by Tony Kakko]

Vast were the storms, no hope for the dying
Home once so blue, a shade of grey in the dark

Then a well-lettered man saw a smile on a dolphin
It planted a thought with the eye of its mind

You could build a ship, sail the stars
Find a new home for all of us
Fare in the night
Find the light

We have sealed the fate of our kind
We have lost this fight
Fly in the dark, and find a warm, blue light
One to harbour life

A hope arise anew
Sailing forth, the Planet Blue will fill our needs
Weâll go in peace and ask them to
Take us to their leaders, my friend
And then weâll kill them all!
Enslave their poor!
And inflict fear,
bring the all seeing Eye of Providence down here

We found discarded beauty
These creatures hate their home?
The locals called this all Planet Earth

Close their curtains, like a soldier does
Youâre a hero for all of us!
Kneel as light
Rise a night

A new dawn of life for our kind
We will rise tonight
Woooâ¦
We will win this day,
Their leaders, knights
We control their minds

Sailed in the dark, and found their warm, blue light
Can still harbour life

Rise a nightâ¦
Rise a nightâ¦
Rise a nightâ¦
Rise a nightâ¦
