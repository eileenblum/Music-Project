[Tony Kakko]

We only have one candle
To burn down to the handle
No matter what they say
If you live like a man, You live in tales you tell

To rage and run like a fool
You need no brain, your best tool
Stay put and as they say
Live like a man, the only way you can

You let the phone line bring it home to you
The life, the lies, the dreams
You cannot see the real thing underneath
- Naked truth revealed

You type your name on one row
To get dosed-up tomorrow
You live in a CC dream, with your machine
It's your goal supreme

You think you have it all now
The wisdom, power, know-how
Can't even think you're wrong
This is the way the brain of a male is made

You let the phone line bring it home to you
The life, the lies, the dreams
You cannot see the real thing underneath
- Naked light revealed

If you live, you will die
You won't live forever stuck in time
Ebb and flow, push and tow
You must keep it real to find her

You let the phone line bring it home to you
The life, the lies, the dreams
Can't even see the real thing underneath
- Naked light revealed

If you live, you will die
You won't live forever stuck in time
Ebb and flow, push and tow
You must keep it real to find her

[Repeat Chorus]
