[Japanese version only]

Winter in here ain't as cold as they say
We have nature, yes, we know the way
Accommodation in the lap of the nature
Can give you a moving response,
If you have the time...

Violate the law of the wild, see her lose her temper
Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

Build the campfire in a place you know safe
And then see that you put it out right
Can you see trail of garbage in there
Maybe not, and that is a sign to follow

Violate the law of the wild, see her lose her temper
Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

You are still the number one
Wilderness, my soul
We may have or lose it all
Respect the wilderness, Respect the life
Save the nature for your unborn child

In the summertime we have night with no night
In the winter she will hide the light
Over the hills, hear the call of the wild
You have yearning to get there, Lapland, madness

Violate the law of the wild, see her lose her temper
Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

You are still the number one
Wilderness, my soul
We may have or lose it all
Respect the wilderness, Respect the life
Save the nature for your unborn child
