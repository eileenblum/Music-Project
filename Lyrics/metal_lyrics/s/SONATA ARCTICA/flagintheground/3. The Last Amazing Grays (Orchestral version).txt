The mystery of death before us
Soon every night can bring the light
And close my eyes
Sometimes life in here's too limited
Sometimes we don't care at all
Sometimes

Time will change the familiar face
Brightest colors fade to grey
The fear is real
One winters day brings the clarity

I feel the time is catching up with us
How many days until its hunger is satisfied
Living the final golden days
We are the last amazing grays
Hoping the young will lead the pack now

I can feel my heart is beating... still
I can see you with my eyes... I still see
But I can't run the way my children can
Can't accept the helping hand...
Leave me

You're the strong one, trust in me
You must lead instead of me, now
There's no time don't hesitate
Or you will also find your fate

I feel the time is catching up with us
How many days until its hunger is satisfied
Living the final golden days
We are the last amazing grays
Hoping the young will lead the pack now

In the eyes of every newborn
I see the future
Life is just a phase
I close my eyes
Deceiving all here beside me
The last amazing grays

In the eyes of every newborn
I see the past times
All familiar face
I close my eyes and see them
Waiting for me
Amongst the amazing grays

[Instrumental]

Mountain sings to me for this last time
Marking the moment
I have found my place
I close my eyes and join them
Guarding the young
Amongst the amazing grays
