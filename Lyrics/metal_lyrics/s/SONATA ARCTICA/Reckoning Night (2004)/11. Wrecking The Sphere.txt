[Japanese Bonus]

I see the landscape before me
So beautiful it makes me smile
Those whispering sounds in silence
Reaching for me, trying to warn me...once again.

Wake up to sense the violence
Right and wrong, clear and strong
Whispering sounds in the darkness
'The time will come to undo what you have done...'

'What if the seas can't save you
From the fires of this world...
You left no trees to keep you
on the surface, when the day comes...'

'The push that you gave derailed me
...on my knees, broken seals
Your vagary led to the silence...'
...I can't hear you.

'Please cast the die
Paint the horizon with the right shade of red
When the oceans rise
Mother cleans the slate and the cradle becomes
your grave...'

'What if the seas can't save you
From the fires of this world...
You left no trees to keep you
on the surface, the oceans rise...'

Under the sky...
we create our future
Towards the end we tend to forget
Is world such a bad place
Why are we wrecking the sphere...

Four seasons turn into two,
Two less seats in the ancient guild
The bond is now obsolete...
You gave us the roots and the wings,
the more you gave, the more we parted from you.
This day seems so infinite
We never learned to be afraid...

Pray no, you should not pray now
Must believe in yourself
All the choices you make
Will define you in the end
Truly, we're a lost cause
A tiny rhymless word
In the poem of time

What if the seas can't save you
From the fires of this world...
You left no trees to help you
back to surface, when the oceans rise...
