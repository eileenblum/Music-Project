You gave meâ¦ you gave me the key to this beautiful garden
The one that holds all the secrets
And I only smile, you waitâ¦ the moment is golden. Now.
Tomorrow may fail all the dreams,
But the moment's golden now, in a dream.

In a golden dreamâ¦.
I, I am alive in a dream, my loveâ¦

Now you gave me, you gave me a beautiful child, in a dream
And you smile when I tell you I think this is allâ¦
All just a dream

My lifeâ¦ my everything in a beautiful garden
Sunshine, friends, glass of wine
If this is a dream, my wish is to dream
Seven lifetimes Greed?

Well, maybe, but you cannot blame me
You gave this all to meâ¦ all to meâ¦

Dream, dream, dreamâ¦ oooâ¦
It's a dream â¦ it is all a dreamâ¦

If I wake upâ¦
I wish I will wake up with you, if I'm dreaming
In a garden under these beautiful stars, by your side

If we wake up, we wish we could wake up with you,
If we're dreaming
In a garden under this beautiful starlight,
By your side

When we grow older, the garden you gave me is filled with your smile and
Your sunshine
We open the gates to this beautiful garden for the faces that glow in the
Sunlight

Filling the garden with people we love, we see faces that glow in the
Sunshine
Smile with our friends in the garden of dreams, and see faces that glow in
The sunshine

You gave me the key to this beautiful garden with children and friends, in
The sunshine
