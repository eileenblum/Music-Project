[Japanese Bonus Track]You won't fall, you won't fall
I will break the chains you fear
I won't let you fall

You run away when things go wrong
And never know me when I am gone
And make me feel like I don't belong
What are friends forâ¦

A song to clear out all debris
A song to bring me clarity
To guide my way across the darkness

Climb the tower, ring the bell
To let the world know all's not well
The dreamcatcher's fallen
nightmare outbreak

I play a role of stupidity
It gives a certain leverage when
The vermin think the game is over

You, once a plague for the weak,
such a fake,
I could see through your frail shell in the sun
Still young and afraid, full of unaddressed hate
Somehow got all piled on me

Yet, I will still your trembling heart
I restore the broken parts
I will break the chains you fear
Help you find there, and disappear
You won't fall, you won't fall
I will see that you are safe
That's what friends are for

Now, evolved, I lead my life
I'm strong from punishment, vital ingredient
I distill your passages from the book of ignorance
For you to sing-a-long

The mighty Cult of Vanity
Somehow now pro-equality
Forget your guilt, I'm doing fine

I will still your trembling heart
I restore the broken parts
I will break the chains you fear
Help you find them and disappear
You won't fall, you won't fall
I will see you're not alone

When you have a trembling heart
I will deal you your new cards
I will break the chains you fear
Help you find peace, and if I
see you fall, I will fall
I will see that you are safe
You won't fall
