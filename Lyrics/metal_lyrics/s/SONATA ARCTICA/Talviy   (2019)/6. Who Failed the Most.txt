A man of his word, corrosive, like the promise, despicable
We are his pawns to lies about the gates of paradise
Closing on the new, irreplaceable
Behold, he's stacking his brick, like it's a wall

And now the world's on fire
And now the pyre draws those clouds on the sky
Staining a page of history
Walking the walk, killing the lights
The dawn of demise

You decide, who is the lord of the rings
The monster of puppets, burning the strings
Ask yourself, now, at the end of the day
Who failed the most

Draw a thin line to cross while making unnerving promises
Leaving a state of dystopia behind

You decide, who is the lord of the rings
The monster of puppets, burning the strings
Ask yourself, now, at the end of the day
Who failed the most

Yesterday, tomorrow seemed more like yesterday
Now we long for those by gone days
The known unknown is now far away

Yesterday,
How brief the moment, we once believed
The guiding hands of the ones who lead
Are big enough, like they were before,
Are now so smallâ¦

Building a maze of Penrose steps within your head
And lead by example from the ivory tower and golden bed

The long shadow of the money man
Tantrum fits the plan â The new law of the land

You decide, who is the lord of the rings
The monster of puppets, burning the strings
Ask yourself, now, at the end of the day
Who failed the most

You decide, who is the lord of the rings
The monster-like master, burning the strings
Ask yourself, when everything falls apart:
Who failed the most

Who failed me the most?
Who failed me the most?
Who failed me the most?
Who failed me the most?

You Failed Me
