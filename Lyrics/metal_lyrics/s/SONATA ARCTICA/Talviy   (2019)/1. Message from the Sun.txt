Winter's upon the northern lands,
Celestial battles ablaze
The goddess of dawn, the winds of sunrise
The arch in the sky leads the fallen to rest

Run across the fields of snow tonight
Tail held high and the sparks will fly

In the night,
Northern Lights will illuminate the sky
A part of the story, the circle of life
The Spirits, the remnants of time

Some see their gods dance in the night
Waltzing in the star dotted sky
A child is conceived under the Northern Lights
And a beautiful legend is born

Bringing you a message from the sun
Tail held high and the sparks will fly

In the night,
Northern Lights now illuminate in the sky
A part of the story, the circle of life
The spirits departed, the remnants of time

You seeâ¦ the swaying lace above you
In the sparkling air
So clear the answers glow
Breath them in your soul

Run across the fields of snow tonight
Tail held high and the sparks will fly
The stories galore from the books of time
When they come alive

With the wolves
Northern Lights now illuminate the sky
It is a part of the story, the circle of life
The future, far beyond time
Hear the wolves praise the moon
And the stars like a loved one
Run, sing like you have always done
See the massage from the sun

In the night,
Northern Lights come illuminate the sky
Glow, the meaning divine of the rhymes in the snowâ¦
