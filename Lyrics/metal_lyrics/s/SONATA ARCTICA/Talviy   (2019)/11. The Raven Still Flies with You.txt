Slowly snow is falling on black wings
Morning rays of light, Gray's Mountain is singin'

Winter morn' the dawn of spring
The sun, the light, the birth of things
The lair of grizzly Mountain King
The evergreen of trees, the living canvas

Cold, moon was so bright that night
When the wolver came
And he stole you away
From me

Where are you tonight, oh child
Can you hear the call
Will we see youâ¦

Do ravens still fly with you
Follow you, like in my dreams
I believe
Your raven still flies with you
Or without you
I hope you knowâ¦ I hope you knowâ¦

Years may pass like a flying raven
Can you see the stars above me
Alive in a cage, safe and fed, the Knowing,
Come render me painless
Even if I would never see you again

Raven, bring me my wish upon the starry sky
All the dreams my son's had in the strange world, in which
He's hidden
Paint the sky, draw the map of freedom, I close
My eyes, the brothers walk the path home side by sideâ¦

The wailing sounds in a chamber
Softer, no echoes remain
Bury your hopes and your prayers
If he is dead you have noneâ¦

Do ravens still fly with you
Follow you, like in my dreams
I believe
Your raven still flies with you
Above you, you feel the wind in your hair

Above youâ¦wind in your hair, in my dream
You run among the wolves now
The hills are glaced, the winter's veil
The beauty of the season close to sun

The ravens still flies with you
