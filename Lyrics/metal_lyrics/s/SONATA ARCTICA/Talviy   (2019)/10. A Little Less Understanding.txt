It's time to tell white lies
Time to feed your confidence
In yourself
It's time to make you fly

It's time to hold you down
Show the ropes around your life
So you can take control

Yes, you will be free, once you know what's good for thee
But tonight you really need a little less understanding
I know how it must feel, you're like a younger version of me

I don't wanna build
The enslaving bridge of vanities
Amenities

To lose you to the game
That only values glitter and fame
A foundation that is frail

Yes, you will be free, once you know what's good for thee
But tonight you really need a little less understanding
I know how it must feel, you're like a younger version of me

Yes, you will be free, you will decide what's good for thee
But like we all, you sometimes need a little less understanding
I know how you feel, you're like a younger version of me

I can feel the wrath of a cryin' child
As you crash the gates of your tiny life,
For the very first time in your life,
You would rather chew off your own tail

What you really want isn't what you need
Maybe one is enough, I'll feed your need
I only want the best for you
Your prison's like a mansion with a view

Yes, you will be free, once you know what's good for thee
But tonight you really need a little less understanding
I know how you feel, you're like a younger version of me

Yes, you will be free, you will decide what's good for thee
But like we all, you sometimes need a little less understanding
I know how you feel, you're like a younger version of me

Yes, you will be free to choose the walk of life you believe
Gives you everything you need, and little more understanding
The windowpane of life, you only see the stains in the sunlight
