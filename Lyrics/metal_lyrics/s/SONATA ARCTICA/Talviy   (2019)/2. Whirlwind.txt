Walking by my side
She leaned her head against my shoulder
Hand in hand the streets were even
Soon that day was over

The first day of the fall
I know there was no plan for us
But somehow it is easy to believe
A good thing will go on

Broken but alive
Missing a pieces, I know
My remedy is time
But now l need a new hope to break this fall

I saw you stand on the pier one night,
Drying tear drops in the wind
Walking away in the dark, leaving everything
Now you're gone and the leaves fall
Are dancing in the whirlwind

Like so many times
The way we seen to learn is to
Repeat and fall again
But will the falling make us stronger?

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the stars and moon
Hiding in the darkness waiting,
Mountain, please, come closer

I am still alive
Missing a few pieces, I know
My remedy is time
But now I need a new hope to break this fallâ¦

I saw her stand on the pier one night,
Drying tear drops in the wind
Walking away in the dark, leaving everything
Now she's gone, and the leaves of fall
Are dancing in the whirlwind

Now she's gone,
And the fallen leaves are dancing in the wind

I am still alive
Missing a few pieces, I know
My remedy, my time
But now I need a new hope to break this fall

I saw her stand on the pier one night,
Drying tear drops in the wind
Walking away in the dark, leaving everything
Now she's gone, and the fallen leaves
Are dancing in the whirlwind

I stand â in the whirlwind, life must deal me a better hand
Standing tall while the leaves of fall
Are dancing in the whirlwind

Twice upon a time, alone under the diamond skies
The Whirlwind and I
The fallen leaves still dance alone
After the wind has gone
When the Whirlwind has gone

Winter's veil, the leaves are gone
I see the snowflakes on the fields
So slowly dancing in the whirlwind

Spring, new life as winter's gone
I see the new leaves on the trees
Soon they are dancing with the whirlwindâ¦
