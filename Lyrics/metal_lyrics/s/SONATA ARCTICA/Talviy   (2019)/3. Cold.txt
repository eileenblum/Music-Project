Standing with my back against the wall
Standing with back against the wallâ¦ it's cold.
Cold.

Day, Night, fades to dawn
Now the fire breathing dragon
I have nursed by my side is turning cold

One night, blinding light,
Felt the necklace with a golden heart get cold
Against the wall, against the wall, it's cold

Why can't this make me warm on winters nights
Maybe your heart has stone cold gold inside

Dancing with my back against the wall
Dancing with my back against the wall
And again

Why can't you make me warm on winters nights
Maybe your heart has stone cold gold inside

Unless you feel the fire deep inside
A golden heart won't keep you warm at night

But when the memory has a face no more
And the days are getting longer
When all the words unspoken die away

Believe the wisdom written on the walls
Maybe the road ahead is golden
The white Thunderbird will drive away, fly away, fly away

Why can't you make me warm on winters' nights
Maybe your heart has stone cold gold inside
Unless you feed the fire deep inside
A golden heart won't keep you warm at night
Maybe your heart has stone cold gold inside
