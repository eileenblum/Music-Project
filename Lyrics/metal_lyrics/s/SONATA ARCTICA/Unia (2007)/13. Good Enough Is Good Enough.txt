[Tony Kakko]

It was not hard - to choose all the words that I should
put in your mouth
in my own play of shadows
Between lines, word for word, honey.

See who I am?
Out where nothing's forgiven
A small yet very loud part of me is still screaming after you...

Good enough was good enough for me
as it should always be
You would broke my heart when it was weak
Guess you were not meant for me...

I had a dream you broke - with your twisted ways
Still leaving me? Please take your time, but go away
Don't flash that light anymore, honey...

The seasons change...
I was the summer to your heart
the winter lured you away more than once, now I know:
I am free

Good enough was good enough for me
as it should always be
You broke my heart and still I grieve
How can you be over me?

I always thought we'd made it, found a way to live together
You saved the best for last and now it's too late
I count the hours of the day that
seems to last forever

Words through the door
a glance from a broken window
I found your key from the floor
and my heart, suddenly, cut off clean

Good enough was good enough for me
as it should always be
You would broke my heart and still I grieve,
How can you be over me?

Good enough was good enough for me
as it should always be
You spread a tale of lies about me
And I believed it, my heart's got a leak...
