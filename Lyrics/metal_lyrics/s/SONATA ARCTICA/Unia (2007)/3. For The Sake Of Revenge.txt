[Tony Kakko]

We have been stuck in here a day, seeking
Answers for all eternity, or something
Hear the meaning, speaking in me
Have faith in me, have faith in me...

I cannot say that I am fine
And take all you say at face value
I've talked to you more than I have...
Have faith in me, have faith in me...

I've talked too much today
You don't trust me
So I keep on talking in every way.

Across the sea I hear you calling me
For the sake of revenge you command me
This ain't over, no it's never over
'till the fat lady sings, you love me

I'm tired, yet I am swimming
You will not let go of me, you are drowning
As you're quietly pulling me under
We will never make it unless you let go...

There's no crime, yet I stand accused
And I... see the solution naked before me.
You reduced me to a weapon, unlike you
Have faith in me, have faith in me...

I cannot hear, though I incline my ear, why do I even try...
I've told you all 'bout what I am
Have faith in me, have faith in me...

I'm feeling weak today
Please, don't crush me

I keep on walking, far away.
I keep on crawling, all in vain

I am feeling slow today
So don't rush me

We live this wretched serenade
You keep me playing, anyway...

Across the sea I hear you calling me
For the sake of revenge you will command me
This ain't over, it's never over
'till the fat lady sings, you love me

I'm so tired, yet keep on swimming
You will not let go of me, you're drowning
Now you're quietly pulling me under
Oh so quietly pulling me under...
