[Tony Kakko]

I walk with the crowd, alone,
Unseen, or am I imagining?
it's easy keep hiding at home
Still healing

I teach myself how to stay calm
When they wish to behold me
They may, take and divide my time
The secret, no one told me...

Like creatures of the night, they follow...
Bearing the wrong side
Is hard for me sometimes

This need I still can recognize
To swim in the oceans of vanity
Some of us enjoy the rain
[Choir:] and thunder

For me all the shadows are bright
I'm burning in the starlight and I
Hope to feel light as a kite
And fly towards the twilight of my life

Like creatures of the night, they follow...
Bearing the wrong side
Is hard for me sometimes
And now they

have disappointed my broken heart
I'm dancing, they're demanding
The unknown and innocent days are gone
Taken without asking

Safe, further away,
I'll disappear like a mountain without a trace
They tied a knot on my life
It gets tighter when I try to hide.

"They live like the vultures, for a filthy anecdote
They go thru my bones to find just one odd note
I welcomed them kindly, thus they have the right
To leave me in darkness with my shattered heart"

A face of a newly wedded clown
Doesn't offer you the high
Now you're lower than the poor souls you feed

Built the walls out of silence
I will not be taken there anymore
What is wrong with your eyes?
Sad for the right reasons?
I'll show you the ashes of life

No empathy behind your eyes
Sleeping like an angel every night

I don't feel Safe,
Can't disappear without getting my last embrace
They tied a knot on my life
It gets tighter when I try to hide.

Safe, further away,
Can't disappear without getting my last embrace
Once the time finally comes
Will they dig me up from my unmarked grave?
