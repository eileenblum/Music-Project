[Tony Kakko]

I'm a doorman at my Death Row, you faceless foe of heart
An accent, a drop of darkest blood on snow, white feather in the tar....
a tearstain on your frozen face...
A life - in black and white

You slaughtered my soul again
Tried my best to be worth your two realities
You're breaking my heart again
To squeeze out a rhyme, I bid you farewell

Stupidity, ignorance, leave a light on for the blind

[Chorus:]
Now I will hit you where it hurts
Take what is rightfully mine, I need a sign
That you're worth fighting for
Winning or losing, alone
I am only a pawn

I'm tired of pleasing you
Discolored this emptiness, wrapped in a scheme
I... delayed my dreams to see
---Who blinded your eyes from things that are real...

For me, I believe in the taste of bitter sweet
Dying fountains full of stories untold
After a history of "losses" attained the victory where it occurred
Lips so cold, the final testing ground for beautiful words

Diving in the seas of sin, without knowing where lies the bottom
Idle moments spawned you idle people, no morality, no soul.

Sabotage or a fatal mistake?
Scandal born, a new race
Unauthorized use, not stealing?
We've no rights, just passion and rage...

People you know, on your side, touching concern
Stand on a chair and scream as the tables turn
Take a bow, take the blame, soon you'll wake up screaming your nightmare's name...

[Chorus]

People you know, on your side, touching concern
Stand on a chair and scream as the tables turn
Always a minute too late, now feel the burn
Wake up, friend, you're screaming the name of the

Doorman of my Death row, you faceless foe of the heart
An accent, a drop of darkest blood on snow, white feather in the tar....
Tearstains on my frozen face, follow the wicked trail if you
Wish you see the sum of all my fears in many shades of gray
You'll see...
Your dreams in Black and white...
Nightmares in Black and White...
Sweet dreams in Black and White..
Your life is Black and White...
