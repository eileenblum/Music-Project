[Japanese Bonus Track]What you are, and why today
all that's tragic, feels the same
There's no feeling, there's no pain, cold, rain

Cannot stay away from you, light
Cause you are my cyanide
If I can't feel, why is there pain?
give me my rest, cold, rain...

From the darkness, into the light
Face the demons, left and right
If there's no wrong, can there be right?
Only a thin, fading line

Now everything here seems so wonderful,
and different, and still
In the boot of a soldier a tiny red pill
has a purpose to fill
I am wasting my time, writing lines,
that will never see your light
Now my Dark Soul Distillery fills all the bottles,
the essence of life
Wow!
I am running my fingers through pages of...
insanity, hair
And I try to stay drunk as I walk back
and forth on the flickering line
I have lost all the ones and the twos,
I'd take fifteen, if I can choose
I can pass out and forget today
Or then go back in time, face the pain

Dream of me and let me go
I am still my own worst foe
Try to smile and face the light
My starry sky, burning night

When embers dance high in the air
My demons die without an heir
The sun I touch and do my share
why would you care, why would you care...

I answer my own silent query, unwillingly, with a tear
as I see the two ravens of yesterday
fly pass my window in fear
I should take down these curtains today,
they just seem to make things gray
I will clean all the stains but I don't want to know how
that window got smeared
Wow!
A new morning dawns, I am paralyzed,
I lie awake, dead
As that same stupid melody plays in my head,
not again, not again...
I'm a ghost of that once scared young man
Wake me up, please, if you can
It's a nightmare, it's sick, I confess
But I am needed, I clean up the mess

What are you, and why today,
all that's tragic, feels the same
There's no feeling, there's no pain,
cold, rain

From the darkness, into the light
Face the demons, left and right
If there's no wrong, can there be right?
Only a thin, fading line

Dream of me and let me go
I am still my own worst foe
Try to smile and face the light
My starry sky, burning night

When embers dance high in the air
My demons die without an heir
Maybe one day I'll make a means
And this song will make some sense
