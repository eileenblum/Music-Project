For every child there dawns the day,
They wonder from where they come
Why is the sky so pink tonight?
How fast do clouds fly by

And so you come up with stories you tell,
Eyes are open wide
When you tell them about the sky
All that beneath resides

There is a factory clouds are made in
They make 'em big and blue
The factory eats you,
It swallows you whole
It fills you with conceit
And never lets you leave
If you ever dream at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
There's no hook, no sinker, no line
And you will never leave the cloud factory

If you join the same brigade,
I did when I was young
You will never see beyond
The skyline of this town

Take my word, my son, and run!
While your dreams fly free!
Have them write my story down
Like silence breaking sound!

There is a factory clouds are made in
They make 'em big and blue
The factory eats you,
It swallows you whole
It fills you with conceit
And never lets you leave
If you ever dream at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
There's no hook, no sinker, no line
And you will never leave the cloud factory

It's sad if you never leave
You believe what you see
And you follow the lead (woo ooh)
But the eyes they deceive
There is nothing to see
But cloud factory creams
Ooh ooh!

But hey!
Isn't it fun at the end of the day
When everyone looks like me!
Swallowing pints of stale apathy
Having dreams where I would be without the factory!

If you ever dream, at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
There's no hook, no sinker, no line
And you will never leave the cloud factory

There is a factory clouds are made in
They make 'em big and blue
The factory eats you,
It swallows you whole
It fills you with conceit
And never lets you leave
If you ever dream at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
Irony shall be the justice you find
In case you never leave the cloud factory
