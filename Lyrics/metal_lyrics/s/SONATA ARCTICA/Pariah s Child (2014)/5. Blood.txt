At first you kindle life
You place it in a man
This man, he has a heart
That's filled with fire

The man will have a wife
The wife creates the home
They multiply and so
Their hearts are filled with fear

The man creates a wall
He arms, defends them all
This fear becomes his fall

"Blood is a bodily fluid in animals that
Delivers necessary substances such as
Nutrients and oxygen to the cells and
Transports metabolic waste products
Away from those same cells"

The color of life and arrow of fear made flow
Auburn rivers in the snow dance the death
Of fading peace of mind

Kept awake by the night
Of the twilightâs cold, sad weeps
What the child of Orion
Has sown his cubs will reap
The fire is out
And there's an ominous silence
But he can see them in the dark
Under the moon, the shadows find them

Wolf - stares in your eyes
Blink first and die
Beauty and fear, of wolves and of people

There's a cave on the hills,
In the woods not so far away
Never once had he seen the descent
Of majestic gray coming this way

Now he can see those blue eyes
Burning through the darkened night
"He knows the fur, he used to love her"

Ready or not, there will be blood!
Life is a gift you have no lease for anymore
There will be blood!
You will buy our blood with your own blood
You will buy our blood with your own blood
The last thing you'll see is a

Wolf - stares in your eyes
Blink first and die
Beauty and fear within

Who's more of a beast
A king or a priest
What do you believe?

Wolves or the people things we fear 
Wolves or the people
Wolves fear the fear of the people
Think, how one fearful man can destroy this world

At first you kindle life, you place it in a man
This man, he has a heart, that's filled with fire

The man will have a wife, the wife creates the home
They multiply and so, their hearts are filled with fear

Maybe men cannot live when their hearts are not
Filled with fire instead of love
For fear is a powerful thing
Maybe only the might and
The power of fear maintains our life
We function when it's controlled by denial

The wolf in your eyes blinks first and dies
Beauty and fear, the wolves and the people

Those hills have no eyes, but they hear your cries
Beauty and fear, the blood, the wolves and the people
