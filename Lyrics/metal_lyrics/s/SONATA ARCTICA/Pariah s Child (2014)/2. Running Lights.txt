The sunset will make the night,
He feels the road with his headlights
He's one of the wilder kind,
In his yellow and red skyline

Young man... and... his... fast car
Squeezing... the wheel...
Knuckles white

Speeding, turning, sliding, drifting
Deeper in his bucket seat,
Running all the lights with the girl of his dreams

And they enter the night when
The young ones need no sleep
Laughing at the lights they keep running
Becoming color of the night
When the song on the
Radio sings "Such a perfect day"
Tomorrow slowly fades away

The world only ends once in one life time
These nights of the young last forever
Around and around, with the clearing smoke
These days drift away altogether

The peak of the perfect times
The sunrise always ruins the night

Racing... for one... final kiss
Drifting... away... don't touch... the wheel!

Turn left slide right, initial G-feel
Deeper in the red line,
Screaming louder underneath

And they enter the night when
The young ones need no sleep
Laughing at the lights they keep running
Becoming color of the night
When the song on the
Radio sings "Such a perfect day"
Tomorrow slowly fades away

World only ends once in one life time
This night of the young lasts forever
Around and around, with the clearing smoke
These days drift away altogether

Once in a while night's a full lifetime
These nights of the young last forever
Around and around, with the clearing smoke
These days drift away in the shades of time
