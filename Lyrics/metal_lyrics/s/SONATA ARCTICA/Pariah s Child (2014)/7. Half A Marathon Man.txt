An 89 year old man learned how to run
And as he passed me by, he said, "Come on, son!"
I really thought my bones weighted a ton
As I dragged them up and down the block
Now a couple of weeks have passed
Gone are the makings of a lazy man

When I saw the usher of change
Her flaming hair in slow-mo
Gliding past my window
I had to trace her down
"You look like a really nice guy
But can you keep up with me?"
Away she ran

I'm doing everything I can
To be half of a marathon man
How many things can life conceal
Deep in the mist everything is unreal
If you believe in me, I can
Become your own half a marathon man
I am half of a marathon man
Yea-yeah

Good morning, somebody kill me right now
I've never felt this kind of a burning cold
I read it somewhere, running is like a drug
As for the second day, I can say it is not
It's bright white burning pain
Bring it on, baby!

10 miles and I feel hell-bent
I'm gonna make sure this rainbow has an end
I seem to have hit an invisible wall
Trying to find out if this here endless tunnel is really
A cave

So here I run between the fields
I am half of a marathon man
Follow the river down from the hills
If I can do it, then anyone can
Now her eyes reflect my skies
You can hear love in the 21 cries
Of half of a marathon man

[4x]
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day,
It's so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

[Solo]

So here I run between the fields
I am half of a marathon man
Follow the river down from the hills
If I can do it, then anyone can
Now her eyes reflect my skies
You can hear love in the 21 cries
Of half of a marathon man

[3x]
It's a beautiful
It's a beautiful
It's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful day
