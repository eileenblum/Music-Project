Oh I love the face you try to hide in your hands, we are in love
Oh I love the snow angels we make hand in hand, we are in love

Give me the stone you're hiding within
Shimmering, frozen, all it does is make me feel the cold
Rules don't apply, gravity lies
The moon gently smiles when we silently sway while I sing

How long have we been dancing?
You are all I see...

Oh I love the smile you try to hide in your hands, we are in love
Oh I love the sand angels we make hand in hand, we are in love

Summer in bloom, lovers in swoon
Never believed I also could walk in the air like a fool
The greatest of stories, heavenly bliss
Now and forever may sometimes end with no kiss

Now we wonder are we both crazy getting into this

Oh I love the face you try to hide in your hands, we are love
Love the way you get older with me day by day, we are in love
Oh I love the snow angels we make hand in hand, we are in love
And I love how this love makes us strong day by day, we are in love
