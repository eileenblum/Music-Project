[Tony Kakko]

[Japanese bonus track]

Mamas put your babies to sleep, story too cruelsome for
them this is. In Junior high she said goodbye to her parents and ran
away with a boy. She left her family warm and kind, all of her friends said
"you're out of your mind". Life of her own she would find,
it's monday and she's gotta grind.

A Job as a waitress she sure was to find, beautiful face,
mind of a child. Boy got her pregnant, Mary-Lou cried," For this I am
too young oh why did you lie" You said "it's okay if we do it today", I was
so scared that you would go away. "Despite all the papers been signed,
mama take me back be so kind".

Only a child, reckless and wild, needs to come
home again. He promised the moon but won't marry you.
Nothing to do, eating for two, he's goin' out with
someone new. Sunshine or rain, it's all the same, life isn't gray
oh Mary-Lou.

Mamas do your children still sleep, in the safe of their
cradles so sweet. Story I told you I have forseen, Your little angel ain't
always so clean. Days to come aren't easy to see, You can change 'em but
it isn't free. I see that you don't believe, ooo-oo, but you will see.
