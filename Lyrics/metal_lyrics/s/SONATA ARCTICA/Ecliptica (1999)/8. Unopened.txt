[Tony Kakko]

Another misspelled rhyme
written in the book of time
In one page I've spent all my life
Ink ain't even dry. I've been living in a lie?
How could I trust in someone of your kind?

And I got today another letter in the mail
I can't read it here, not today
And when years go by
the unopened letter meets my eye
I'm older and wiser, but still afraid

What if I read it and it is - full of love
How can I face it if I am wrong

Do you feel? Do you care about me?
Did you wait and love me all this time?

I am here, would you come and find me
does your writing guide me thru this all

Oh oh oh

What if you'll tell me that I am wrong

Do you feel? Do you care about me?
Did you wait and love me all this time?

I am here, would you come and find me
does your writing guide me thru this all

Do you feel? Do you care about me?
(...)
I am here, would you come and find me, yeah
Do you feel? Do you care about me?
Did you wait and love me all this time?

(enveloping) I am here, would you come and find me
does your writing guide me thru this all
Do you feel? Do you care about me?
Did you wait and love me all this time?
I am here, would you come and find me
does your writing guide me thru this all
