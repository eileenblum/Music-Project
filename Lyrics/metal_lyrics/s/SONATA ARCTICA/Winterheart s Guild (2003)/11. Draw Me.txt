Blessed with an eye to see things as they are, will you draw me?
Up there on the wall, looking down to us all, you never saw me.
I found a pen, and I outlined a life.
You've never cried, I think I saw a tear in your eye.

Your eyes tell the tale, I will not ask again.
Now I see what you've lost nothing is quite the same.
By the love of my heart, cut my drawing in half,
For I think I'm like you... should you draw me...

Waiting for my even flow.

Farewell, my passion, you slowly turn pale.
I will long for you warmth, made me feel safe.
I will not draw again, 'til I know it's my time.
I have lived a long life, should I draw me...

Morning's here, I must have... failed

Someone save me...
