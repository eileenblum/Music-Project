[Japanese Bonus Track]

I have no feelings, there is no more sunlight.
The darkest hour is now here.
I must have lost it for good, staying here without a fight.
Out in the cold and windy night.
Still waiting for a sign.

I know there is still a day for me.
One short moment is still enough for me.
Bring me life with your ray of light.
If only I found a small piece of the fallen sun...

I wait for the day that will come.
Wait for the sunlight, wait for the one.
You can do what you want with the sea, but the rest of the sun belongs to me.

The winter fell on me and ended my life.
The darkest hour is now here.
Yet one more frozen month, my Hell awaits me, out in the cold and windy night.
Still waiting for a sign.

I know there is still a day for me.
One short moment is still enough for me. Bring me life with your ray of light.
If only I found a small piece of the fallen sun...

I wait for the day that will come.
Wait for the sunlight, wait for the one.
You can do what you want with the sea, but the rest of the sun belongs to me.

I know there is still a day for me.
One short moment is still enough for me.
Bring me life with your ray of light.
If only I found a small piece of the fallen sun...

I wait for the day that will come.
Wait for the sunlight, wait for the one.
You can do what you want with the sea, but the rest of the sun belongs to me.

I wait for the day that will come.
Wait for the sunlight, wait for the one.
You can do what you want with the sea, but the rest of the sun belongs to me.
