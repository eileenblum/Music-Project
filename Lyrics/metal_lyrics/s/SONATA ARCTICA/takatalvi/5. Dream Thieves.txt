[Lyrics by: Tony Kakko]

Welcome, come in, yes this is me
I gave once too much and now
I can't get rid of thee
I can't be subtle, I can't be kind
Why I should be there for you, fuck off and get a life!!

Read a book unwritten, kill the poets dream unhidden
I wonder, did I love too much, cross the final line
Rip my life and spread the news,
cut my wings and make me choose I leave the fuckin' sword on the rock,
Feel hurt? Why I should give a damn.

I know I'm easy target, I'm sold on blackmarket
How would you feel if I stole what you need
I give everything to you.What will you do?
What makes you think you won't burn in hell?
You see a life but not mine
Read me a line from your torture guide
Download new lies on your scythe

This is my vision, this is one man's decision
Wise thinking from a fool
For twisted minds I'm a tool
I could be independent, but can I take the heat
Variety of thieves make my illusions obsolete

I know I'm easy target, I'm sold on blackmarket
How would you feel if I stole what you need
I give everything to you.What will you do?

What makes you think you won't burn in hell?
You see a life but not mine
Read me a line from your torture guide
Download new lies on your scythe

What makes you think my words burn in hell
..You see a life...
..Read me a line...
..Your diary lies...
..Please get a life...

What makes you think you won't burn in hell?
You see a life but not mine
Read me a line from your torture guide
Download new lies on your scythe
