[Lyrics by: Tony Kakko]

Back then it was only fun, something we'd always done
Smash it up, the then you run, all that without a gun
But something came up one day, some bills you couldn't pay
And you got carried away, oh so far away

They wanna use ya, they wanna lose ya
They make your father singing hallelujah
I wanna help ya, so let me help ya

I gotta ask you, buddy, where did you find the gun

I ask everybody have they seen ya
You tell 'em you are fine, and they believe ya
Gimme a call, and I see through ya, you wasted your life
Where did you find the gun

Holymans only son, your mother on iron lung
No money anyone, but now you've got the gun
Stick up on 2nd street, I heard your running feet
Lay down, get a seat, and beg them for mercy

They wanna use ya, they wanna lose ya
They make your father singing hallelujah
I wanna help ya, so let me help ya
I gotta ask you, buddy, where did you find the gun

I ask everybody have they seen ya
You tell 'em you are fine, and they believe ya
Gimme a call, and I see through ya, you wasted your life
Where did you find the gun

By an accident you find yourself
From the slammer with too much friends
You shot an officer, you shot him down
Now your young life is gone
You're older than you are, you're gone
Because you had the gun

I ask everybody have they seen ya
You tell 'em you are fine, and they believe ya
Gimme a call, and I see through ya, you wasted your life
Where did you find the gun

They try to make you pay and they will find ya
You try to hide away but they have seen ya
Rest while you can believe me now
You gotta run for your life
Where did you find the gun

...find the gun, where did you find the gun
