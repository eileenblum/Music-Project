Welcome to heaven, left from the lights, the number seven
You have it all now, now that you've come to see the light
Take it all in, an open mind
Now you wonder: What if your heaven
Was someone else's hell?

Heaven. What the hell would I do
In that place without you?
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone in heaven,
Alone in heaven...

Welcome to heaven! Can you believe the things you see there?!
Forever winter, summer of love, spring or fall
It doesn't matter anymore
Alone you wonder, can this be heaven if
My best friends burn in hell?

Heaven. What the hell would I do
In that place without you?
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone in heaven,
Alone in heaven...

I can't see you here. Where have you all gone now?
Don't know, but it hurts to be all alone
On the field where the stones grow dead names

I'll never leave you behind,
It's one for all, and all for life

Still I wonder,
Why go to heaven, when my
Best friends burn in hell?

Heaven. What the hell would I do
In that place without you?
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone in heaven,
Alone in heaven...

Heaven. What the hell would I do
In that place without you?
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone in heaven,
Alone in heaven...

I can't see you here. Where have you all gone now?
Don't know, but it hurts to be all alone
On the field where the stones grow dead names

Heaven,
What the hell would I do in
That place without you now?
What the hell would I do in
That place without you now?
