[Japanese Bonus Track]He said:
"Sit down and hear what I say, little prince"
I've taught you to live by the book ever since
you came here, one lifetime ago.
Your brothers and sisters are gone, they all knowâ¦"

They sang in both choirs, the sinners and saints
I told you how twisted a picture it paints
for us to behold, a disgrace.
When a new morning dawns, it spits on my face

One, two, free-fall,
down in the well with them all
I am not their slave anymore
Cut my leash, IÂ´m not gonna bow and adore
I will rave and plunder

Life in a dell, in my private little cell
I can see one face everywhere
Thank you for this hell.

Somethings you see will never go away
This is the shit I confront every day
We huffed while they bluffed their way in
The Good play fair even if the odds are thin

One, two, free-fall,
down in the well with it all
I am not their slave anymore
Cut my leash, IÂ´m not gonna bow and adore
I will let them drown there

I light you a candle and carry you away
from the walls of this little town today
I will not see the Light, it's a blight, if IÂ´m right
so tonight I will fight my way out of their sight

You think you built a fortress,Â 
that your life's a citadel.
But at the same time nowÂ 
there's something wrong with you
All your vivid dreams and nightmaresÂ 
will now fall down from the sky
When it hits you, the painless jump and fall

One, two, free-fall
