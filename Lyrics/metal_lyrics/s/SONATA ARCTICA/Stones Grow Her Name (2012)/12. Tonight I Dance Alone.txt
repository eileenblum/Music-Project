[Bonus Track]Sometimes we find things we're not looking for	
and we lose the sense of reason	

Sometimes we lose what we are caring for	
and then face the day without them	

My life, my home, my you	

Sometimes we fail to say how hurt we are	
When the word we fear speaks treason	

Don't wanna be there when my Cupid dies	
from a wound by his own arrow	

Here's to life, my home, my you	

I raise a glass 'n drown my sorrow	
When I'm on my own	
I dry my eyes on a shoulder	
But it's not my own	
I cannot hold you, my tears are made of stone	
I feel a tap on my shoulder, but... tonight I dance alone
