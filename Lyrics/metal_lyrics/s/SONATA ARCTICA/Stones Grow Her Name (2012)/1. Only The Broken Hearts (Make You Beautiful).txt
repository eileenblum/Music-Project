So life, your gilded leafs have turned
From "once upon a time" to "darkest hour"
Ember to inferno- the ending is stronger
I burned myself for a page of rhymes

Only the broken hearts make you beautiful
And one has got to be mine
Only a broken heart, turned cynical
Lights my final rhyme

Someone broke the frame and now my picture's gone
Remember what I look like?
You can keep my old umbrella
I'll have my rainy day, thank you for all the pain

That's all I wanted...

Only the broken hearts make you beautiful
And one has got to be mine
Only a broken heart, turned cynical
Love lost, a typical rhyme

Only the broken hearts make you beautiful
And one has got to be mine
Only a broken heart, turned cynical
Love lost, a typical rhyme

Only the broken hearts make you beautiful
And one has got to be mine
Only a broken heart, turned cynical
Love lost, a typical rhyme
