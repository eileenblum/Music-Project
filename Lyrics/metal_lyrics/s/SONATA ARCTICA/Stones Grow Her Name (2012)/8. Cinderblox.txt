If I one day found my way back home
One more ride for the hell of it

If I one day found my way back home
I would tell you how I love you so

One more time for the road tonight, honey
One more try just for the hell of it

Cinder blocks are keeping me inside
Wall so thick, cold yet benign

One more time for the road tonight, honey
One more try just for the hell of it

Can I stay away from you
If I get out of here soon?
Would the road be paved by my mistakes, by the law or by you?
Every wall in here is blue,
Every man here knows you too
We have seen your every curve,
The sole good purpose you serve

Yeah!

â¦I'm safe, I'm safe in here from you, I know
'cause you can't make me do things I would not otherwise do

One more time for the road tonight, honey
One more try just for the hell of it

When you're done with your wining and dining
You make a man do things that wind him up in jail
