Give me the right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything... I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

I have a right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything... I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

Father, thereâs a little flower
Beautiful and different, all alone... All alone...
Is it so, Dad? Iâm not supposed to
Make the world anew, and be like you? Am I you?

Give me the gift to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything... I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

I have a right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything... I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

...Right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be me...

You made it clear right from the start
I am to take your sour heart within, one sad day...
But I will never teach my son
Embittered history, tried and true, âcause Iâm not you...

I have a right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything... I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

I have a right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To have every gift... I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

Give me the eyes so I see,
Give me ears so I hear,
Give me love so I know what love is,
Give me the freedom to think,
To believe... in something

I have a right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

[Spoken:]
I have a special right to grow up,
and to develope physically and spiritually
in a healthy and normal way.
Free, and with dignity.
I have the right to love, and understanding.
My parents have special responsibilites
for my education and guidance.
I should be taught peace, understanding, tollerance,
and friendship among all people.

So give me the gift to hear, to see,
The love, the freedom to choose the things I feel,
To be right for the world youâll leave me...
Give something.

Give me the right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

I have a right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

Ohhhhhâ¦

Give me the right to be heard,
To be seen, to be loved, to be free,
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe, to believe... in something

Right to be heard, to be seen,
To be loved, to be free, to be everything,
I need to be heard, to be seen,
To be loved, to be free, to be everything,
I need to be heard, to be seen,
To be loved, to be free, to be everything,
I need to be heard...
