The siren's sounding, the screech is warning
all is ending
Night of nights, I'm a child of the world
now derailed
They found me crying in the dark
I'm not accepting
If I sleep I am there, yet I'm always too late

Seems to me I can do in a dream
almost anything
If only dreams were real

Losing my insanity
Would mean I'm losing everything
The dream where I can fly
I'm losing my insanity

I'm not awake, I'm not asleep
I'm filthy, dirty only in my dreams

When you can't see me
I'm standing on the hill and I'm the king
of this land in the palm of your hand
Dreams are deceiving
I arrive while I am leaving
I'm the bird in the sky, you are aiming at me

Seems to me I can do in a dream
almost anything
If only dreams were real

Losing my insanity
Would mean I'm losing everything
The dream where I can fly
I'm losing my insanity

Losing my insanity
Would mean I'm losing everything
The dream where I can fly
I'm losing my insanity

[Solos]

The imagination I feed every night
to be able to fly in the deep, blue skies
Up where the rivers are crystal clear

Losing my insanity
Would mean I'm losing everything
The dream where I can fly
I'm losing my insanity

Losing my insanity
Would mean I'm losing everything
The dream where I can fly
I'm losing my insanity

Losing my insanity
Would mean I'm losing everything
The dream where I can fly
I'm losing my insanity
