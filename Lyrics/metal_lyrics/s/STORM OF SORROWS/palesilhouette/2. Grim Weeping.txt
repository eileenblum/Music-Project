Skies so pale, horizonâs black, forever dead 
Into the dawn, into the dark, my fate is sealed 
Why should I want to stay? 

How senseless to obtain hope 
My tears are frozen and dead 
How senseless to obtain hope 
My life forever lost 

In times of pain I follow the tears weeping my life, drowning my love 
Iâm fallinâ to the ground 
Carved deep into stone my lament stays 
Dying dreams, Iâm shattered, so frail
