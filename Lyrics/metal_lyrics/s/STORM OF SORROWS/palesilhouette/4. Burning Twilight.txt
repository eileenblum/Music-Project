You donât know whatâs on, do you want to die? 
You donât know what to think, your lifeâs a lie! 
And when you think of your life, so whatâs to see? 
Veiled in hate â only misery 

Burning Twilight â the knife cuts deep 
Burning Twilight â restless sleep 

When you remind the ones you trusted in... 
Black figures without face â betrayed by sin 

Mean the times when life was strong 
See the signs... truly gone 
Now fade away - betrayed by loss 
Can you tell, whatâs the cost??
