Sorrowâs here, as a sea of tears 
Mourning starts, captured cries 

You pass away into the cold 
Your eyes are grey in grey 

The fall begins, dreams have died 
The oak of life: worn out 
No remains, nothing more 
Your eyes are closed 

Silence rules the void in my mind 
The seasons are grey and dim 
Centered I follow the signs of light 
Alone out there, a pale silhouette
