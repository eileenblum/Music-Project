Fate is punishing me with a kiss of death
It left it's marks on my broken soul
I was crucified with the nails of unlimited thirst
for supremacy

Life has left my body, funeral time
âround my grave the crows are gathering
Celebration of triumph, grotesque scenery
Wicked apostles they are - of a coming storm

... the smell of decay
... bait for the worms

final interment at the verge of ruin, resistance
failed

Corrupted standards of values, perversion of life
itself
