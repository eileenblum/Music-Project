Devoured by aching greed, devotees of all jealousy
exclusively follow the leads...

... of the ones who hold control by the power of
material possessions, blinded by a specious,
fragile illusion

Susceptible to vanish and to pass away, too positive
âbout the crossing of ice

Consumed with envy the devotees ran another path

The path of the wretched, of the aborted and pathetic
Misguided by the worst of all temptations

Misled by fallacies, they tried cheating death
But they failed...

... and were bound to dwell forever as slave
to the greed

Yielding to despair the devotees ran another path

The path of the wretched, of the aborted and pathetic
Misguided by the worst of all temptations

The devotees: LIFE... a perpetual screw

The path of the wretched, of the aborted and pathetic
Misguided by the worst of all temptations
