Chaos as prophet, sovereign and supreme
Unleashed it's demons, spread it's wings opened wide
Suffocation... lack of reason sanctified

The world's an open grave, constantly refilled
Aspire after rule of savagery insane

Kneel down insidious beings, worship subversive faith
This is the final warfare of a defective mankind

Instinct as impulse, extreme and dominant
Unchained it's power, merciless suicide
Invalidation... back of values innate

Support the lack of conscience, devote to enmity
This is the final downfall into depravity

Bow to indoctrination, despise morality
Hate seems so familiar, unspoiled sovereignty

Splendid is belief, deceptive and confined
Hate the answer, stunted faith, crippled life
Dissolution... back of logic resolved

The world's an open grave, constantly refilled
Aspire after rule of savagery insane

We're going down, the last chapter
We face the end with a desperate smile
