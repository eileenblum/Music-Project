Every soul has it's own sweet secrets
For these are carved into the core
veiled in shades, the shades of oblivion
Self denial, infected within

A virus, it's order is ruthless work
Spreading the lifeless, crawling through the veins
Source within every heart, mind and soul
Breeding devotion to the sweat secrets

Every heart has it's own sweet secrets
for these are written into the core
The flowing blood pushing corrosion
Inner strife, melting away

Ohhhh... sweet insomnia, master and servant
Dwelling in your arms, apathetic obedience

Your Sweet embrace, your venomous kiss of death
These sweet illusions are sour nightmares

A virus, it's order is ruthless work
Spreading the lifeless, crawling through the veins
Source within every heart, mind and soul
Breeding devotion to the sweet secrets

Everyone has it's own sweet secrets
For these are burned into the flesh
