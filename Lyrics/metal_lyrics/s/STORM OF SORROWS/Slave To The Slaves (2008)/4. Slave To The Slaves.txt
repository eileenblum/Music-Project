In dark holes so brave we're coming down to the world, a defective breeding
Born to serve as slave to the slaves, just a number without ID
Confined to our cages, fed with the nectar of lies
Blinded by the reflection of our defiled souls

We're going straight down the death-trap, the debris of our minds left behind
No room left for the free will, like obedient lambs led to slaughter

With closed eyes so brave we're following the blind leaders of a slave parade
Born to be the servant of servants, replaceable, empty shroud
Confined to an illusion, drunk with the nectar of lies
SCORNERS of individual existence

Cheap truth for the feeble minds

We're going straight down the death-trap, the debris of our minds left behind
No room left for the free will like obedient lambs led to slaughter

The knell is conducting the end, a malicious choir playing the last, the final elegy

We're going straight down the death-trap, the debris of our minds left behind
No room left for the free will like obedient lambs led to slaughter
