A life as slave to the liars in this world of
dreadful behavior
Ruled by vermin we are, forced to bleed for nothing

Pushed too far, no more acceptance
Sinister ascent of uniform minds

Regain salvation, leave the path of self denial
Absolve of death sanctified
Start the healing of the deepest wounds
Break off devotee's chains

A life as servant to the insects in this world of
prepaid belief
Suppressed by vermin we are, forced to die for nothing

Faked lectures of the fallen ones
Mendacious words in vain

Regain salvation, leave the path of self denial
Absolve of death sanctified
Start the healing of the deepest wounds
Break off devotee's chains

Pushed too far, no more acceptance
Sinister ascent of uniform minds

Regain salvation, leave the path of self denial
Absolve of death sanctified
Start the healing of the deepest wounds
Break off devotee's chains
