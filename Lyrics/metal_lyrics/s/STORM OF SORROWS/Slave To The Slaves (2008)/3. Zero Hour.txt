Zero hour... hell is unleashed... the fire burns...
ready to take us

At the gates of disbelief we, the lost, desperately
Cry the tears of regret

Desolate, despicable, constantly death is calling,
the ultimate purgatory burns

We've suffered the blight of a dying world
Now we've crossed the edge of insanity
We've sealed the loss of control
There's no turning back, death all over us

The scythe... the scythe is ready to chop the weed
And nature takes revenge

At the gates of disbelief we, the lost, desperately
Cry the tears of regret

Desolate, despicable, constantly death is calling,
the ultimate purgatory burns

... and purifies the sore wounds...

We've choked every try to save our souls
Now we've reached the end, final doomsday
We've lost, humanity's on death row
Soon we'll cease to be, finally quit the scene

The flames... the flames are ready to burn the world
The apocalypse unleashed

At the gates of disbelief we, the lost, desperately
Cry the tears of regret

Desolate, despicable, constantly death is calling,
the ultimate purgatory burns
