I share my life with sorrow and pain
In blackness of delight
I feel i've lost the stream of life
Black raven's cry

Sun will nevermore shine
My heart forever turned black
The demons gather around and drink my tears away

Black season, shatters within
Burning cries of pain
Whispering shadows lurking for souls
Vanishing tears aflame

I drown my life in sorrow and rain
The darkness at my side
I fell i've crossed the seas of life
Black raven's cry
