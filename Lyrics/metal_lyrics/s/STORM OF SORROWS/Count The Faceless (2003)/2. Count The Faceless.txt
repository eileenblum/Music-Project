Stand in line, waiting for a life
Without soul, faceless, haunted pride
On the shelf by the live you hate
Pang hunger for a new day

Take me out of this pain
The life is calling me
Let me die and be reborn
The time has come to be
Throw me down for another ride
Give me strength and give me pride
Change my shape and call me God

On the path of the weak
Side by side into pain
Follow the blind

Count the faceless
Waiting to drop in another life

Count the time, growing from the seed
Without heart, mindless, haunted breed
Far away from the fate you'd hate
Slow dying on this new way
