Timeâ¦the time is wasted
Scarsâ¦the scars are running deep
The deeper that you fall, the more you fall alone

And all scenes that you saw will return, hurt you more
With ravens you did fly, heard your own silent cry

Give me the pain of a thousand lies
I don't care if heaven dies
The hourglass still hunting time, ringing in the last goodbye
My art is pain!

Coreâ¦the core is rotten
Soilâ¦the soil is bloodred
Coldâ¦it makes you shiver
Fearâ¦you fear the mirror

Cry, cry my angel
Your soul is mine
Die, die my sweetheart
It's me, your old friend
Do you now see
My name is pain
