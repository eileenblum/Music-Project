When the old wounds bleed
Cause of lies you had to keep â forgotten pain
So the clock turns back
And the knife in your soul starts to hurt again

Shattered world, bitter life, more shadows
Twisted earth, empty eyes, more lies

Watch me now: where stars don't shine
I feel the pain of desire
And once more i burn in pain
Watch me now: my world is lost

When the old scars ache
Cause of truth you had to fake â forgotten shame
So your heart still mourns
And the shades in your mind start to rise again
