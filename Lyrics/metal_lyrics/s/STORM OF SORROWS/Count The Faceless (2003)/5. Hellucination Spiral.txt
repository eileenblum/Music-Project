Opressed emotions â the suffering
Depressed our senses â another world
Meanless living â time is out
Life in stasis â the idiot world

Deformed existence â the gathering
Defyed all ethics â another shame
Infracted borders â laughing stops
The glory is empty for the idiot world

Life is short and meant to fade
Our souls are closed to hellucinate
Embrace the spiral, forever lasting
Join with hate our dark parade

Destroyed resistance â a fading I
Beloved abhorrence â another sigh
Sinful dwelling â you are lost
Lies are ruling the idiot world

Prepared ignorance â a pestilence
Embraced illusions â weakened world
Depraved messiah in disguise
Blessed in rapture on the idiot world

Exist enhanced in a dying flame
Pressed into a coloured frame
Our will is taken, forever weak
Obedient watchers, black-eyed freaks

We shameful servants of non-exist gather our names on the chaos list
We pray for rescue from this cage, lying helpless in lifeless rage
