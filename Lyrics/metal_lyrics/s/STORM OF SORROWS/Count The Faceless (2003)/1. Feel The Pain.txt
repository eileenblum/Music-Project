Come to me, meet your master
Feel the pain, drown in your blood
Without connection, without sense
Heavenly bastards, rot in mind

In the dark, beyond all life â this ancient might evoked to life
So step back, enjoy the show â see the world go down to hell

Come to me, meet your master
Feel the flames burn out your life
Without your God, without help
Fucking losers, you shall die!

Weakened rotted angels standing before the gates of heaven
Burned to ashes!
