[originally by Jermaine Jackson]Like the sand can seep right through your fingers so can all your day
As those days go by you'll have me there to help you find the way
The way i feel with you i know it's got to last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And i will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall i'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all and everything will be alright

Time goes by so fast
You've got to have a dream
To just hold on
All my dreams of love began
With the reality of you
You and i believe
That all our dreams will last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And i will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall i'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all and everything will be alright

Though the sun may hide
We still can see
The light that shines for you and me

We'll be together all that we can be

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And i will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall i'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all and everything will be alright
And when the rain begins to fall
