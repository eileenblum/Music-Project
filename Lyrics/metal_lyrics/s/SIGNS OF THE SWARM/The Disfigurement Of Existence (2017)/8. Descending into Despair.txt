The unseen wrap their cloaks around me
Allowing me to only perceive
The hideous remnants of past misery
Misery, I see it all, vivid scenes consuming me
Lingering energy taunts me
Flooding my vision with unforgettable casualties
Hateful silhouettes curl their fingers
Dragging me into their direction where I'm forced
To be one with the damned
Leaving their markings on my skin
Reminding me I'll never be normal again
Eternally devoured

Descending into despair
Cold dead hands pry open my eyes
And burn the images of fear into my mind
Why have I been chosen
Why can't I fucking escape
Why can't I escape the sinister embrace
Descending into despair
Eyes roll back into my head
My body's paralyzed
Trying to scream
But only black smoke rises from my throat

Evil takes over me, torment and misery
Taunted by black shadows that have control of my deceived inner being
Evil takes over me, torment and misery
Taunted by black shadows that have control of my deceived inner being
Begging for a tragedy
Someone fucking help me

Begging for a tragedy
Someone fucking help me
