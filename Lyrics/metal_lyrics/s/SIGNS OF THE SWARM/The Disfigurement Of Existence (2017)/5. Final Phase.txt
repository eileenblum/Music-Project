[feat. Dickie Allen]Wipe the earth clean of its remains.
Tides of punishment come to sterilize a fucking disgusting place.
Exterminating the human race.

Condemned hopeless bastards lay waste in a bitter creation.
Cycling in excuse filled embarrassment.
An egotistic planet suffocates in laziness and corruption.

Too many years wasted on a hopeless universe.
A final phase of defacing the earth to sterilize and start new.
Ashamed, full of regret.
We've got nothing to be proud of.

Watch them turn to dust.

An ancient wrath demolishes everything in its way.
Making room for the new species to restart and rebuild.
Burning their families.
A plague of cruel disease completely cleansing the useless.

Blackened skies swallow the earth.
Red waves of blood penetrate all of the cities drowning the foolish creatures.
This is not the second coming, but a dark cleansing.

This is not the second coming, but a dark cleansing.
Watch them turn to dust.
Foolish bastards turned inside out, dismembered and separated at the torso to burn in their own embers.

Layers of flesh ripped open right before their eyes exposing their insides untangling and running down.
Their severed limbs disembowel, quickly rotting from the inside out, scabbed bubbling skin discharging disease sent by the plague.
Spines violently removed, choking on chunks of their esophagus, vomiting intestines.
A final phase.

An entire species turned inside out.
A wasteland of mangled bodies to burn for the new world.
Restart, rebuild temples made out of bone.
This is their new home.
Wipe the earth clean of its remains, tides of punishment have sterilized a fucking disgusting place
Extermination of the human race.

A hateful plague has destroyed all of humanity.
The new leaders plant new species on to what was once known as earth to restart and rebuild on the ashes of our executed families.
