The sound of bones cracking let me know that she's near
A hateful unwanted presence that feeds off of fear
A lost soul that never found light now lurks in the abyss of hatred
Crawl towards me, her pale mangled limbs are embedded in
The back of my eyes
An abused soul with no remorse seeks retribution
Within an innocent figure
My nightmares have become a reality
My eyes illuminate what the mind doesn't want to see
A sickening curse standing right in front of me

Shrill whispers constantly haunt my consciousness
Reminding me I'm nothing but a servant in the palms of malevolence
Stalker of the night deceiving the weak

Splintered nails drag down my back
Foul blackened eyes glare at me in disgust
A rotting odor overwhelms the room where shadows disfigure reality
A mangled cunt from hell stalks me

Her pale mangled limbs are embedded in
The back of my eyes
An abused soul with no remorse seeks retribution
Within an innocent figure

Foul hateful creature come and devour me
Rape what's left of my mind
Consume my sanity
Stalker of the night
Deceiving the weak

Stalker of the night
Deceiving the weak
