Sinner burning the book and dismantling the cross
A malcontent man who perceives himself as his own god
Embracing the adversary
Hailing with the clouded depraved
Subconsciously aware that you're just as much of a petrified slave
A coward, a lost unguided entity
Rebelling the commandments with aversion and disgust
The feeling of betrayal brought you on this path
Unanswered, begging for a savior alone
In the dust, full of resentment and anger
Give them a sign
Show them the way
This world is a mess because no one feels safe
We're all fucking crazy
And question what's next
Confused and scared
We are all mad at best
A terrible accident at the blink of an eye
His life is completely turned upside down
And is ticking away by the hour
Overcome with fear he prays to a higher power
The same higher power that left him alone
Confused and lost, but where else is he to go
We're all fucking crazy
And question the end
The fear of death constantly dances in our heads
We are all fucking crazy and question the end
The fear of death constantly dances in our heads
We're all fucking cowards and repent for our ways
When the cycle of life brings us our darkest day
