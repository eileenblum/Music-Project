trembling hands drag down tearing skin right from my face.
mangled spine, eyes back, I think I've found my place.
praying to be conquered by the images I think I see.
delusional, schizophrenic, mind controlled.
picking at flesh I'm loosing all my sanity, the reflection tells me that I'm condemned.
I'm drifting further from my normality as I watch the blackened figure in the room ascend.
grip me by the throat, nails lodged into my neck.
losing color from my eyes with weakness in my bones.
dragged to a familiar place, aroused, I'm eager to be home.
psychotic thoughts carved into blood drenched letters.
no more running, just accepting it's not fucking getting better.
I am my favorite enemy.
my own two hands will bury me.
I have been consumed.
I won't return.
the reality of dementia is enticing.
I'm at ease loosing all my sanity.
no return.
twisted torn up deranged mind fucked.
it's crawling in me, feast upon my eyes.
sudden flesh crave.
I've summoned dark skies.
I can't stop this torture frenzy.
screams so pleasuring.
slipping in your throat
spilt blood as your family kneels before me.
it's not my hands.
it's the work of the damned.
I violate as your skin turns cold.
I have become so disturbing.
reborn, never thought it'd come to this malevolence.
delusional.
schizophrenic.
mind controlled.
grip me by the throat, nails lodged into my neck.
loosing color from my eyes with weakness in my bones.
dragged to a familiar place, aroused, I'm eager to be home.
I have been consumed. I won't return.
the reality of dementia is enticing.
I'm at ease loosing all my sanity.
