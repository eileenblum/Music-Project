[feat. Chris Gonzalez]a life of deceit cycles its way back digging deep into me.
a hopeless act of innocence slithers past, forgetting the consequence.
this lingering bitterness emerges to reinfect the cleansed,
it's just a matter of time before these scars rip open.
this foul fucking taste in my mouth reminds me why I sewed my lips shut in the first place.
these sickening reminders of everything.
these sickening reminders of everything leave a foul fucking taste in my mouth.
now let it run its course.
feel myself sink lower drowning in misery I can't feel anything
a life of deceit cycles its way back digging deep into me.
a hopeless act of innocence slithers past, forgetting the consequence.
this lingering bitterness emerges to reinfect my life.
I've cleansed all ends yet it's fucking here again.

sick in the head, will this ever end?
