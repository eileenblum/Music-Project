hollow and numb abandon this useless fucking world.

I've taken all I can handle.
this is my breaking point.
I'll watch the earth burn around me and not give one single fuck.

take these cold hands, let me feel again.
I'm fucking hollow.

feeding off of the hatred around me forming a legion.
a chance to submit the oppressors of the world

extermination of the foolish
proving a point to these bastards

hollow and numb abandon this useless fucking world.

I've taken all I can handle.
this is my breaking point.
I'll watch the earth burn around me and not give one single fuck.

in the end there is no savior
like machines we will destroy our creator

we are just fucking machines
in this oppressive existence
driven to prove a point to the world
