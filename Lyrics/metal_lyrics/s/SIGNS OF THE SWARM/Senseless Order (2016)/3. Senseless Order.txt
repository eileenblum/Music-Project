Imprisonment of the mind corroding the innocent.

Subconscious wars battle in constant chaos. Overwhelmed by suppressing thoughts.

Weak minded victims of their own selves collapsing, blind to their descent from reality.

This foul latch of energy raping their consciousness. Trapped within the walls of derangement, obsessed to become one with subliminal tongues.

Obeying the orders.
Servant of the mind
Searching for solutions
Through misery

Tormented, misled malevolence. This hatred rips them apart, spiraling into their own hell.

No solution to this disturbance. Forced to believe the only thing left to do is destroy everything you fucking know

Exhausted
Mentally drained
Fucking worn out
You'll never escape these voices from hell

This is suffering

The voices consume and devour all energy
Staring at the hands of your annihilation.

Bring forth the end
Release this life of torment

Tormented, misled malevolence. This hatred rips them apart, spiraling into their own hell.

No solution to this disturbance. Forced to believe the only thing left to do is destroy this life you fucking dread

This noose choking tightly.
Ending this misery. Squirming, suffocating, setting this mind free.

Hanging lifeless and cold. We suffer all
Alone and we'll die alone.
