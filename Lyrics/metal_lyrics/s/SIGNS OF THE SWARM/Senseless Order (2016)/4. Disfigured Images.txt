behind these dark walls lies something barely human.
under this thick skin is empty blackened veins.

becoming disgusting, reborn into hate.
envisioning foul possibilities
disturbing images.

casualties all around.
bodies hanging.
mental masterpieces disfigure my
vision from seeing clear.

I see sickening scenes

try to see the world through my eyes
this is life with a sickening mind
visualizing your family's extinction
bodies collect in empty streets

becoming disgusting.
reborn into hate.
I can't seem to wake from this
nightmare, what's really in front of me?

what's really in front of me?

delusional
someone help me
just make it stop
what's in front of me?
