Disgorge your maker. Creating a false creator. Silence them. 

Collecting the children of god to display their own species falling from grace. A once sacred man burning scriptures, devoting his life to silence all pure. 

Placing their hands on a cold stone with carvings of the depths of hell. Beginning to speak in tongues they surrender, giving themselves to the beast. 

I was sent here to test your will. I was sent to rape you of faith 

These are the words of the prophets forcefully being taken and shoved back down their throats. A worthless creation of fabrication slithering through their teeth.
Choke them of their final gasps for air. 

Choke them, useless amongst men. 

The armies of abaddon vanquish god struck masses.
The orifice of hell swallows them whole. 

The only thing that they fear is their judgment, never a heart of morality. 
I can hear every unanswered calling being crushed right in front of me. 

They will see. 
Now they will see their savior is useless.
Screams blocked by lips sewn shut, silent prayers left in waste. Silencing the blessed. 

Every last sacred mouth has been suppressed. Their kingdom is falling. 
With their tongues in my hands they have realized that I am their new king. 

Bow before me understand there is no second coming. I was sent to rape you of faith. All hope is lost. I have been chosen. 

Every last sacred mouth has been suppressed. 

Every last sacred mouth has been suppressed. With their tongues in my hands they have realized that i am their new king, bow before me
