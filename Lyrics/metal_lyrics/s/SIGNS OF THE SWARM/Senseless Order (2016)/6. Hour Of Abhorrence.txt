we've ignored the signs of our termination for years constructing our own end.
The whole world is at war.
all authority has dissolved.
society has gone mad.
hiding our faces behind red hands,
we're all guilty of this putrefaction in front of us.
The riots spread from city to city,
crumbling from racism, greed, selfishness and injustice.

this is the end of all humanity.
each and every one of us is guilty.
so just sit back and realize we're all to blame.
watch our whole world rot.
we should all be ashamed.

we hold the debris of humanity in our fucking hands.
it's too late for this damned creation.

we brought the extermination of man upon ourselves.
we should be ashamed,
it's too fucking late for this mess.
the whole planet has gone up in flames.
total destruction and chaos, the end of days.

the atmosphere has been swallowed by darkness.
consumed in dead silence.
wiped clean of life.
a desolate vale burning to extinction.
