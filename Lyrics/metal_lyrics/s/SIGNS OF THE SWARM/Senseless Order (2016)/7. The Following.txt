something foul won't let go of me.
a sinister possessing watching my every move.

I hear its thoughts as it gets closer and closer peeling down each wall.
the corners spill dark veins as I await my abduction, horrified.

I can't escape it's forever with me designing my fatal outcome.
its clutch, its grasp,
I'm permanently victim to this mass that refuses to let me close my eyes.
I'm fucking terrified I'll never have peace of mind.

it's crawling under my skin.
I am haunted.

follow me into expiration, these walls are closing in.
I can't escape this paralyzed feeling.
it's crawling under my skin.

victimized by sinister manipulation I am but a slave to the puppeteer
controlling the thoughts inside of my fucking head.

this malignant fiend is following.
it's aroused by torturing me.

this malignant fiend is following.
it's aroused by watching me waste away.
forever fucked
