Hatred for society
What will it take for you to see?
It's nothing but a fallacy
Your fucked up reality

Souvereign authority
Can't tell me who the fuck to be
Already dead to me
Not even sorry

So go on making your rules your way
Throw the bullshit out of your way
Honesty it never pays
In a world that treats you like a stray

Setting me off when you're setting me up
And you're pointing fingers at me
Setting me off when you're setting me up
And you think you're better than me
Well you're not!

Shallow, empty
Puppets you aspire to be
Ignorance dominates
Followers accumulate

Feeling hostility
For your lame society
Obsolete identities
Force fed rules and false religions
Leaving me to rise

[solo]

Absolute majority
Disregard authority
Treat you like minority
Not for me to tolerate

Setting me off when you're setting me up
And you think you're better than me
Setting me off when you're setting me up
And you're pointing fingers at me
When I start

Flowing with insanity
Hatred goed inside of me
Searching through this maze
Chosen path I can not stray

Intervention gets to me
My position Final Plea
God won't forgive me
