Collapsing world, battle of humanity
Preach to me a better place
Innocence and your ignorant demands

Propaganda war machine
Spew the images forced to see
Infantry tragedy ends in casualties
Potesting accidental deaths

I am what I am, I am just one man

A cold reaction forced on me
Stiff resistance heresey
Bloody nightmare hear the pleas
Bolf face enemies slay the enemy

Human shields the captive slaves
Indicating set me free
Attack the front line take control
Slay the enemy, sanctions starve

Beating down the innocent
Nations break to sub-divisions
Media circus coming to your land

So disturbing, reporting news, endangering lives
Is it fame, fear or lack of virtue
Careless calls and fools make men die

I am just a man, so long as I live

A cold reaction forced on me
Stiff resistance heresey
Bloody nightmare hear the pleas
Bolf face enemies slay the enemy

Human shields the captive slaves
Indicating set me free
Attack the front line take control
Slay the enemy, no I'm not the enemy

Insighting forces murdering, murdering
No I'm not the enemy
Slaughtered souls, mass fatalities
No I'm not the enemy
Sadistic madman, murdering
No I'm not the enemy
Hear the tortured screams of agony

I won't save you, God won't save you
Execution now awaits you
Terror sets in panic stricken
Fear employs you, take your final breath

[solo]

A cold reaction forced on me
Stiff resistance heresey
Bloody nightmare hear the pleas
Bolf face enemies slay the enemy

Human shields the captive slaves
Indicating set me free
Attack the front line take control
Slay the enemy, no I'm not the enemy

Insighting forces murdering, murdering
No I'm not the enemy
Slaughtered souls, mass fatalities
No I'm not the enemy
Sadistic madman, murdering
No I'm not the enemy
Hear the tortured screams of agony
