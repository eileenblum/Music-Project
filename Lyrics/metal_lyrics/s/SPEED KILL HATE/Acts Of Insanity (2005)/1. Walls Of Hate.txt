Walls of hate
See them rise
Self-indulgent
Hear the calls
Every minute
Domination all that I've become

Superficial high
Self-destructive low
Purgatory
Tormenting me, torment my soul

Beyond this life I face
No comprimise
Beyond this life, my fate
We perish the life subsides
Beyond this life I take
From the devil I learn to sacrifice
Beyond this life, my faith
The power beyond the grave

Blood on blood
Eye to eye
Mass confusion goes through my head
Blurring vision
Violating all that I have known

Complicating one's mind
Unprotecting the soul
Desperate warnings
Begin to fear, I take control

Beyond this life I face
No comprimise
Beyond this life, my fate
We perish the life subsides
Beyond this life I take
From the devil I learn to sacrifice
Beyond this life, my faith
The power beyond the grave.
