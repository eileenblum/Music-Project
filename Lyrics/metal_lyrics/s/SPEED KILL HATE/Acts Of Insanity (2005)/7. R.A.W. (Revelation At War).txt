Exonerating prisoners
Condemned to an evil faith
Opinionated congregation
Causing larger separation
What denomination are you paying?

Gonna pay to believe today
Holy figures gone astray
Broken trust misconceptions
There's a revalation under way

There's no scrupulous conformity
Gone authorative deatee

I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in what I have become
A revelation at war

Superstition is undone
A revelation waits
Perpetuating disregard
For disciples of religion
Revelation at war
Advocating adaptation
To the god forsaken

Validating destruction
And the desecration
Of the false traditions
We're at war

It's because I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
Revelation at war

[solo]

I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
Revelation at war
Revelation at war
I believe in raw hate, lost faith, raw hate
Revelation at war
