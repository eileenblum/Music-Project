It's your own decision
To live your life with moderation
I don't need to follow
That way I never wanted to be

Now you want to make me brainwashed
Force ped, not for me
Keep your propaganda
World religions, far away from me

Don't need what's not for me
Won't be pressured to think
Like you or your beliefs

Hate me all you want to
Just because I'm being me
Showing independence
My individuality

There's no toleration
Denouncing your society
With determination
I will live for what is best for me

Don't need what's not for me
Won't be pressured to think
Like you or your beliefs

Hate to dominate, to violate
I feel the real need to hate
To dominate, to violate
I feel the real need to hate
To dominate, to violate
I feel the real need to hate

It's all for me

Cause me aggravation
White shirt, blue tie, 9 to 5
Each an imitation
Of someone who is deprived

Live in desparation
All the weak can not survive
Cause your own opression
Isolated from the world I'm free

Don't need what's not for me
Won't be pressured to think
Like you or your beliefs

Don't need what's not for me
Won't be pressured
With force fed rules that I hate

No, it's not for me
