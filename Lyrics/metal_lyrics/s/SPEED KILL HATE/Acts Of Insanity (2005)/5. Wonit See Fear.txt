Wasted minds
In a world of opportunity
Take a look at what it's done to us
Following trends that have no purity

Empty thoughts without security
From my past I cannot hide
Anxious to express my sympathy
For your fucked up world's society

It makes me strive
Can't deny
Builds your pride

Never did I think that this would ever become
So disturbing thinking this could ever be done

World keeps changing
Leaving room for next to none
All my fears subside
I know we will conform

You can't beat down our pride

You won't see fear in us
You won't see fear in us
You won't see fear in us
You won't fucking see fear in us

Rebirth - stand up for yourself
Rebirth - innovate your mind
Rebirth - stand up for yourself
Rebirth - see the fear in you
Rebirth - your mind is all you lose
Rebirth - stand up for yourself
Rebirth - as I sit and wait

It makes you rise
Lost your pride
And your mind

Never did I think that this would ever become
So disturbing thinking this could ever be done

World keeps changing
Leaving room for next to none
All my fears subside
I know we will conform

You can't beat down our pride

You won't see fear in us
You won't see fear in us
You won't see fear in us
You won't fucking see fear in us

[solo]

Never did I think that this would ever become
So disturbing thinking this could ever be done

World keeps changing
Leaving room for next to none
All my fears subside
I know we will conform

You can't beat down our pride

You won't see fear in us
You won't see fear in us
You won't see fear in us
You won't fucking see fear in us

Rebirth...
