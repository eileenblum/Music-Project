Clouds of black are drawing near
As the smell of death becomes clear
An overdose another day
No thanks to God that I was saved

I rode the horse years ago
Thinning blood addicted habits
Rot away rusty bones
Scrape off the scars

God can't be far away
I push the needle into my veins
My adrenalin begins to rise
All I need is more and more

Never once did I ask for you
To give me sone that I never could do
Tasting enough of this
Injecting deadly poison in my skin

Face the pain - won't need to
Face the pain - won't believe you
Face the pain - what I need
Give me what I crave, give me all I need

Face the pain - won't need to
Face the pain - won't believe you
Face the pain

Swollen heart in a battered brain
All the exits cause the drain
It's killing me this perfect friend
The living nightmare never ends

Like a leech you suck the scabs
Sucking blood without no care
I tear a hole whitin my s kin
I feel the poison setting in

Sedated state of mind
Loosing all counciousness
Breaking me down

Face the pain - won't need to
Face the pain - won't believe you
Face the pain - what I need
Give me what I crave, give me all I need

Face the pain - won't need to
Face the pain - won't believe you
Face the pain

[solo]

Now that I'm on my way
I feel the drug rush to my brain
Numbness comes over me
I feel the lost reality

Never once did I ask for you
To give me sone that I never could do
Tasting enough of this
Injecting deadly poison

Face the pain - won't need to
Face the pain - won't believe you
Face the pain - what I need
Give me what I crave, give me all I need

Face the pain - won't need to
Face the pain - won't believe you
Face the pain
