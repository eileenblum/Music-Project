Thoughs of depression
Flow through my brain
Matching me up
With the criminally insane
Not much left in this life
Total deception of advice

With no one to turn to
Left here to die
Panic and sorrow
Builds up inside
Decaying away from my pride
Nothing left but suicide

Repent - wash away the blood stained hands
Repent - death passes over me
Repent - having the choice I'd do it again
Repent - can't kill what's already dead

Repent - please god save me
Repent - from the world
Repent - you'll never change me
Repent

Thoughs of depression
Flow through my brain
Matching me up
With the criminally insane
Not much left in this life
Total deception of advice

With no one to turn to

Panic and sorrow
Builds up inside
Decaying away from my pride
Nothing left but suicide

Repent - wash away the blood stained hands
Repent - death passes over me
Repent - having the choice I'd do it again
Repent - can't kill what's already dead
