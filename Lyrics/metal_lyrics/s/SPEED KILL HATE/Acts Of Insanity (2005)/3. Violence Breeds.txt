In the days when kids were kids
Disputes were settled with out fists
Resolve was met with confrontation
Spilling blood was the solution

Violence breeds in everyone
The new breed virus has begun
Fists replaced with knifes and guns
What have we become

Generation frantic nation
Too scared to shed a little blood
Battered beings hiding souls
Wounded cowards breaking point

Coalitions lose control
Tolerations next to none
Indiscretions get to me
Infectious immorality

Weak minded souls
Get in line and stand face to face with me
No weapons needed here
Break all of your childish nightmares

Teach you ways to get revenge
Slug it out to the the bitter end
WIth pride we drive with force
Shedding blood with no remorse

Hey are you ready?
We can step in the pit and we can finish this shit
Hey are you ready?
Throw all of your weapons down to the ground and face life

[solo]

Use your mind with exhortation
Hand to hand with self persuasion
Poverty compelled decision
Instinctive fear of innovation

Violence breeds in everyone
A multitude infecting foce
Confrontation with no cause
What have we become

Alteration of munition
Fights fought with pure aggression
Leaving thoughts of desparation
This is time for adpromission

Determination humanity
Altercations follow me
In a second I'm ready to fight
No gun no knifes pure democracy

Hey are you ready?
We can step in the pit and we can finish this shit
Hey are you ready?
Throw all of your weapons down to the ground and face life
Hey are you ready?
Going punch for punch fighting one on one
Hey are you ready?
I'll show you horror and teach you integrity
