Why life always betray us
We will all die alone

This is the end you
This is the end of me

Can't you see the darkness is here
Open your eyes the doomsday is among us
Endless pain, trip to sorrow,
Bleeding fears for the unknown tomorrow

Nothing to lose and nothing to say
I will never bow for this, nothing to obey
You will pay, I destroy everything in front of me
There's nothing but decay

Die

What was gained countless lives, all were lost in vain
Freedom was never free in this kingdom of lies

Leave me or stay away
Who's the sinner?
Who's the saint?
No one knows
Leave me or stay away
Manifest it's decay

What was gained countless lives, all were lost in vain
The war of sins
Freedom was never free in this kingdom of lies
Freedom is just a word, it's the death multiples

Nothing to lose and nothing to say
I will never bow for this, nothing to obey
You will pay, I destroy everything in front of me
There's nothing but decay

What was gained countless lives, all were lost in vain
Freedom was never free in this kingdom of lies

Leave me or stay away
Who's the sinner?
Who's the saint?
No one knows
Leave me or stay away

I can see the end of this
Nothing will survive the havoc
Bloods will seep away
Like an endless reddish river
Crows will fill the skies
It will dim the light forever
Manifest, it's decay
