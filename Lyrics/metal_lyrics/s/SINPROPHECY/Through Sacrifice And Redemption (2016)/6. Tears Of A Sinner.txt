I carry with me, my anger and hate to kill and rape burn and destroy
Face to face with the Evil's eyes
Mass aggression and holy war,
Not knowing what I am fighting for?!
Unleash the beast of war

Hate and fear plague in my mind
Quest for power, seek to control
Soaked in blood of innocents
Lost in evil and lust

Ruler of darkness, father of lies
You blinded me, with your lies
With your envy, with your gluttony

Shame on me
Forgive me
Shame on me

Betrayed my friends and lead them to the ambush
I left everything I stood for, I don't deserve to live more .
I don't deserve to live more
I don't deserve it anymore

Dead eyes realize the lies
Disguised in corrupted creation
Martyrs of deception, victims of the lies
Lost in demise, in the war of sins
Deceived by my savior, I lost everything

Victims death yields, the fake sacrifice
Dark ravens are flying with their cursed sounds
On the land of dead which is full of rage
Full of hatred, full of corpses, full of blood

Forgive me god!

Pleasure of wickedness is offered unto me
An offer of sensual gain, blinded me.

Blinded me!

Is this the kingdom that you seek?!
