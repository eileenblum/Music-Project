As I walk in this green valley among flowers and butterflies
Smelling the fragrance of the spring remains embracing autumn

As I follow you in this gloomy forests just to see your beautiful face
Your innocent smile and your gentle touch, it makes me float away

Where are you?!
Where are you my angel?!
You left me alone
Alone in this world

Follow my voice, you have no other choice
Cause this is all what remains of me
Inside of you I will always be
A part of me you will always be

But one day I couldn't feel it,
Everything was taken away from me
You disappeared,
I rushed towards the woods, hoping I could find you

I'm following your voice
My dark angel
I'm following your voice

As I'm shocking from this smell, the smell of blood and metal,
Rotten bodies and smoke, mixed with pain and hatred

The ugly truth, and no one can deny
That we lost our beloveds in the war of sin

I'm fading,
Star gazing
Counting nights in your wait
I'm laying behind this cold barrier gate

As daylight dies, and fog swallows the rays of this suffocated sun,
As ravens chants the poem of death
As butterflies dances around the fallen
And mourn our everlasting misery

Astray within void in a dark cold space
Mourning your ruins, asking for grace
Where are you?!
I'm fading away
Counting the nights in your wait
Behind this cold barrier gate

Inside this frozen catatonic maze

Where are you?!
I'm fading away,
I'm falling

Everything is coming to an end
And Everything gone with the wind

I wither alone in this grief
Like an autumn fallen leaf
