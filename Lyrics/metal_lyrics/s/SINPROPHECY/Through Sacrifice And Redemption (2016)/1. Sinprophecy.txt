Too many years ago the story has been started
When the evil beguiled them and made them walk through the forbidden
They tasted the apple, and then we tasted toil

When the son killed his brother
When the seed of sin has been put in the pure soil
When honor became cheap and manners became worthless
When the tyrant became the ruler and the innocent became the slave

The roots of the seed still growing and filth is what we reap

The plague will spread as long we walk this earth

And time won't fix it or heal the wounds

To get our salvation, we should put and end for the tyrant
To cut this unwanted roots, and overcome the decay
The war shall begin, and make them pay

Everyone became ready and said farewell for their beloveds
and promised them they will come back with honor and victory

But the promise has been broken because of a traitor among them
and when he thought that he earned the kingdom that he seek
he tasted the enslavement and his own tears as the echoes of
their screams are thudding in his head.

And all this according to the prophecy

The seed of sin will always grow
It's written, it's all written.
