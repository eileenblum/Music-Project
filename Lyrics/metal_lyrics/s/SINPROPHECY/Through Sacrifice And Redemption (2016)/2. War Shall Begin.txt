Here is the story of filth and deception
Broken dreams and fallen souls
We've been through sacrifice and redemption
But yet prices and consequences were unfair!

In your perspective we are like sheep
You're slaughtering us, our lives are so cheap
Into darkness you will prevail
But my world is darker than you think....

War!

Exalted hate
Eternal pain
Hatred and fear
Innocent blood
Bloody shame
No one to blame for these fallen souls

Fear and pain breeds anger and hate
We share the same fate
Kneel for the glorious
The strength of your sins is worthless now [2x]

From dark age to another one
Darker on everyone
Extortion, torture, bloody justice
Revenge is rising to kill injustice
This is the irony of fate to face the wrath that you made
Say your final worthless prayer

Fear and pain breeds anger and hate
We share the same fate
Kneel for the glorious
The strength of your sins is worthless now [2x]

When you lose everything
You can do anything
You are blind and weak
You can't see the truth
I'll make you pray for the noose, just to escape my hell
No need for your invocation

Fear and pain breeds anger and hate
We share the same fate
Kneel for the glorious
The strength of your sins is worthless now [2x]

War shall begin!
