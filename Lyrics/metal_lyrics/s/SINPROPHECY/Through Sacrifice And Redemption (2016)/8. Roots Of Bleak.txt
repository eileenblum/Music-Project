I will go
And come back with honor and victory
Oh my son don't cry or fall
Don't cry for me and shed no tears... Remember!

Father

Father you told me that you will come back for me
Where are you now?!

You left me alone in this life drowning in hate and grief
Where are you now?!

I suffer everyday I remember your last words to me
Where are you now?!

You sacrificed yourself for a dream
You sacrificed yourself for illusions
You sacrificed yourself for deniers
You sacrificed yourself for nothing

I tried to shed a tear, but I couldn't
My mind and heart are filled with rage
No one with me

I tried to shed a tear
It's my endless nightmare
No one with me
No one but my shadow

I walk among thy dead memories
The loyal painful sacrifice

I wonder if you were right or not?!
It always thud in my head

The tale of sacrifice fantasy
Is it really the key to eternity?

I wonder if you were right or not?!
It always thud in my head

To eternity
Is it the real key
To eternity

Through this everlasting nightmare
Wall of these dead memories
Deceived by your saviors
Your sacrifice was lost in vain
Unmerciful destiny, hypocrite fate
I'm just blinded by hate

The wounds that you have left
Will be open for immortality
Farewell father...
