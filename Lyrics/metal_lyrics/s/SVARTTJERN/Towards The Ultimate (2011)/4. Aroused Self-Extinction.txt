Sense...Willing time... Does laughter roam? In forgotten time.

Pulsing skin shows no proves of existence.
Death carves through man, through reasons well.

For your eyes will never glance in to the open. It's grown thick and
way beyond for you too see. Natural growth eats around, but you,
you will never see.

Theatrical spectacle reveals what many believes, you believe,
and will never grow.

For such an aging time, one should think a man known more
about why leaves alwaays fall. With a stronghold growing
deeper for a servant so see, there is nothing in the way to
once, your seeds will grow more within me.
Slaves, you will never go through change.

For your softest spots I moist with spit. For so long discussed
confusion. This is you.

Satan! Again aroused for hearing what you know.
Analyze beyond the meaning can't be done through a pot of
soil, this again why you will never win. And always fail.
Wandering again without knowing you are sheep, you have
failed, you can never win.

I await notes of death.
I await your screams of final belief.
I await your recognition of faith.
I await your eternal silence.
I await your final darkness.
