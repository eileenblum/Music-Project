Still alone, swirling any conscious mind. A greater gift to behold, I see.
Power alone gives pleasure they know. Who dares to take the step
towards madness within.

Gain and see...
All hope lost, faced the wall, Two ancient signs show the way for
the Five to see. Clearing paths not first to walk.
They have a spiritual guide, at war within.

Exterminate, abominate, sensations, fever, lust. Granting will for
the other, only Threee commits, end at hold.

Two will never sacrifice within.

Gain to see signs of evil at hand, come forth demon rage.
Eight to decide upon the real.
It is mercy for the sin, on wealth and power. Pushed away.
Unspoken wisdom for the demon within.
I am the demon within.

Still alone, swirling any conscious mind. A greater gift to behold, I see.
Power alone gives pleasure they know. Who dares to take the step
towards madness within.
