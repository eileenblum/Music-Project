Fronting time, in a on going change. Breathing hard and slow,
capture life on the thinnest line.

Stimulate the roots. My eyes white stair.
Heated hand, who returns from sweat and lust.

Breathing power and moans of lust, I surround myself so delicately within.
Reaching for the sky I harvest upon the key. I am swirling upon the key.

Like a forcing bloom I repeat act. Performing... For an utter final.

I give to me the most sacred and holy. I give to Thee my own reflection.
As I see myself repeated inside out, there is no longer distance.
I hold the torch. I surround my hand, with fire.
Like a frocing bloom I repeated act.

Stimulate the roots. My eyes white stair.
Heated hand, who returns from sweat and lust.

Breathing power and moans of lust, I surround myself so delicately within.
Reaching for the sky I harvest upon the key. I am swirling upon the key.

For the the one gazing at the altar shall not see. This blood has not run far
till it's dry. When rising above in pleasure, I smear myself upon Thee.

In this foggy confusion. The whole image comes dear.

For this is the demon within me. Like a forcing bloom I repeated act.

Still swirling above and beneath the key, blue eyes stare.
Return to me with a conscious mind, I do behold the greater of gifts.

Breathing power and moans of lust, I surround myself so delicately within.
Reaching for the sky I harvest upon the key. I am swirling upon the key.

Like a forcing bloom I repeated act. I smear myself upon Thee.
