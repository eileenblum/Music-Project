There he goes towards lust again,beneath the shield lies a dying man.
Wisdom wide ,forever conscious innocent.
There is all but life in his way.

So proud he once stood,forever conscious innocent. Deep within.
Bent away the surface. In the distance the punishment.
Finally the soil shall breathe.

Shattered the sights of survival. The breath of the unknown.
Raise the demon,damn this race to an end. Survival of terror.
I do worship my lust from within. In the end I shall conquer,
my last words are you're last.

I am the demon. Given all to see. I am the demon.
Sights gone mad. For some. I do behold.
I am the secret.

So proud he once stood,forever conscious innocent. Deep within.
Bent away the surface. In the distance the punishment.
Finally the soil shall breathe.

There he goes towards lust agene, beneath the shield lies a dying man.
Wisdom wide,forever conscious innocent. There is all but life in his way.

I am the secret.
