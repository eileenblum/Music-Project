For a tired man never stare real.Exhaled, lost, confusion absorbs life.
Sacrificion enlight, the altar. Still the holiness within.

Sacrificion enlight the altar, Still the holiness within.
Religious knowlegde, turned from belief.

Come through demons rage, through me.
My Wish is the power, I give me to Thee.

I see dsitance shodaws, occult shapes of madness,
spasms deeply within. Twitching body on his knees.

Unholy is my pale reflection, based upon the real.
The blood in my veins, the child is my own.
The alter of my heart, I give myself to me.

I laugh when touched inside my glorious rage. Sickness I fill myself,
I wish for you nothing. Sense, 10, opposition. Behold my greater gift.
I leave you within your closed mind. For there has never been nothing.
I am God and eternity.

I am God and eternity.
