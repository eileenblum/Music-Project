Human search for answers beyond the mortal. Inside, alone and cold
facing daylights breath. Wind filling sails towards the next world.
They are dreams of confusion, why do you believe.

I have seen the terror shaping the God.
I have grown from the roots, alone above the others.
Unmasked misanthropic violation.
I hate your life.

Aroused by my own state and mind. I grow. I shape. I sink the earth.

Demon plague. Feasting creation. 10, 7, 9... Bleed on your knees,
row far. It's a mountain. Morningstar. Take the flame, awake your
suspicion, here is nothing to believe. Observing stones.

I have seen the terror shaping the God.
I have grown from the roots, alone above the others.
Unmasked misanthropic violation.
I hate your life.

I walk through this stench from life. Do you escape this life.

Regaining again myself . There is no shadow to see.
No pupils within. I gain what you were never willing to see.
