Long aged skin, through a partly human mind.
Child, I wish you never grew. Bloom forever.

For it is eternity,for it is all. Again I prove to me I am all
considered faith. My child,I wish you never fled. Forgot to learn.
I wish for you to see.

Demon walls. Protected rituals. You are free to see.

Long aged skin,I still to see the child. Through a partly human 
mind. Reach your goal. Apparently still to behold. Sacrifice.
Come through great gifts of power.

For it is mine,for it is all eternity. I do glance upon something
so surreal,the child has grown. Still with eyes to see.

For it is eternity,for it is all.
Again I'm proud,to me I am all considered faith.

Demon walls. Protected rituals. You are free to see.
The child has grown,still with eyes to see
