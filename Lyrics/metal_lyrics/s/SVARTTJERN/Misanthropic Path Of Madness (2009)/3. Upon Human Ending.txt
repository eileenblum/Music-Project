Open human, discover the journey
Pale alone, faith is hunger
No where joined, never real

Rising hell

Slow is death, heart is starving
Dark realms, you will never gain power!

Far away formed for honour. Filled with passion.
Possessed... No where... This journey... This journey!

Rising hell

Broken down, no resisting
Seedless beings, terror among you
Proud I am, alone, only one
Human, humanity, tied awaiting Satan

False nature fails, from witch I shape me
Possessions. Strong blood. Be the goat of will

Force, will, connection. I be I forever

Rising hell!
