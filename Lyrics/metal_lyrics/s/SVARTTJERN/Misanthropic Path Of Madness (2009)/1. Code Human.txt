Through these mind forcing fires
Falling towards soil beneath untouched signs.
They lay still by wisdom and age,
Nothing higher than time coming towards me.

Surrounding mist, do you suffer the illusion if this is all.
Untouchable this is, wondering you are. Day dreamer. This is it!

These distance born still to touch, beyond flames slaving through.
I search passion, in only. Shivering the last, erecting shells, dreamers down.
Mass moving, visions are born. far from birth, still this is so close. Enter away from structure

You have loved and died so many times
Still ages of ignoring survives
Who shall finally see what's covering, realising what is real?
This ending is the only survivor
Open your eyes!

Can you truly see? Can you truly feel?
Can you truly renounce the flesh of your existence?
Can you truly search? Can you truly grow?
Can you truly gain the wisdom within yourself?

Can you truly renounce the flesh of your existence?
Can you truly gain the wisdom within yourself?
