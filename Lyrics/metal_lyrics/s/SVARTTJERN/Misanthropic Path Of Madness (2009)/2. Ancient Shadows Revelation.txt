Raw mind
I am wisely shaped, upon your hunger
Triangle within the eye

As these shadows appear casting darkness beyond the limits
Seeking answers builds the structure of what only kings reveal.
Newborn telling are all, these lusts were never so clear
Open towards the only, beneath the dust of your remains

Rising glory upon this human hunger.
Sweeping the slaves, winds gain only wisdom

In the shadows of your forefathers graves, look what you have become
Punished dreamers, your scars will always tell
For my father I shall seek passion,
Trusting honour I shall serve the one

Time layers strike only out.
Through crawlers entering fears
Shapes you can scarcely imagine.
Travestying the power seeding in

Dessert eyed humans, you will never be the same.
The sand formed from stones. This mountain is for ever!
Slowly upraised starving. Their moving through blue.
Chasing wise within the numbers. I am forever!

A growing heart opens the raging instinct
The glory's uprising, this ending only once
Within the third, the blue, nothing numbers

Passion paths through, crushing desert domain
The truth collaring eyes.
