I seek not the answer for now, true times will show the rising dominance
From the fading light of your ongoing feast you shall behold the real
Satanic wounds, satanic flesh
You are all victims of Satan!

From spirit searching, unknown layers appear for the stronger
In wondering, shapes a cure for kings!
Echo screams of the deceased, the weak unwilling are left
Satanic wounds, satanic flesh
You are all victims of Satan!

Finally... Finally

I am worthy of your worship
My lusts have drained the black blood

Satanic wounds, satanic flesh
You are all victims of Satan!

From which my possessions, has led to sacrifice
Casting flesh towards the demons
Finally revealing shapes of the extreme
Falling for Satan, you are suffering the strongest rites!

Finally... finally... finally the world shall shape!
