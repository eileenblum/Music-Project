Closing towards the roots in height. Sensing the tracks, surreal the path.
Raw, sense, far the pupils depths gaze.
In to depths far beyond. Offer the will, what's embracing the sleep.
In chaos your mind wanders to what you may never see.

Do you open to the carved truth
Hearing the echo away from the knowledge.
Where are the depths to the man, this is what you never see.
In the shadows of what's ever created lies codes revealing the signs,
Till the end no man wanders the path.
The secrets within the force closes the dreams I open to me
Two stones I distance to the real.

Reaching for the one, believing towards cloudy sights
Where it lies, lies the hand
Exist of the smoke where is the eyes.
I see. The pulse filling the dream
This is all, all for still the most willing man
