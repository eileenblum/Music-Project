Ripping through flesh, the poison you are.
Above this secret tomb, lies life beyond.
A branch with roots and rotten leafs.
Come earn a token, the cripple you are.

Obey the mighty, surrender where you are.
Plastic views, through sand itself,
I do, not, hear...
...

It's been screaming out from nowhere.
At least for some there has been no place to enter. I do move you through this path, to enter the sounds, the clearing mist.

Awake now I see these tales of another day. Where do these drops return? Or do they absorb this earth.
A glance at you through your crystal dreams feeling satisfied as I return.

As simple once thought, for one an arrow.
Cripple manifest, lift your spirits high.
Absolute if seen to fly, crumble now you're bound to die.
To rot in this forest, you just can't be right.

Intruder, it's all you are to me.
I, do not, hear...
