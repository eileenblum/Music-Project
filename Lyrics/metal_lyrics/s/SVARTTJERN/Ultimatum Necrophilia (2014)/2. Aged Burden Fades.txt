Temptation, to reach beyond where strings attach.
Reasons dwell, one can care to open still to stare.
Enlighten, fought of carriers to bear his own.
Believes to be instead of him.

A mold to cease another's existence.

Temptation, to gasp the air others bleed.
Reasons dwell, stare to find the outer rings.
Enlighten, a burden has come through itself.
Believes to be instead of him.

A mold to cease another's existance.

Through temptation there are paths to follow, but there are ones to create.
Aging the maps causing man to dwell, there are secret beyond reason.
Changed still through the time, the northern star will know.
Believes to be instead of him.
A mold to cease another's existance.
