Come, ~frightened beyond ~the waves,
Accrued where all men rest.
Drowned dry air in flames, from your pulls pumping sighs.
I renounce your reluctant views on life.

Winds clearly push beneath the wings and time comes undone.

Reluctantly, obsessively, drawing sticks through the soil commencing tales of it all.
Assumingly, possessively, twigs in monumental feature still, no thoughts are even raised.

Cast, ~your glories - filled once dreams.
Frantic stimulation in despair.
Drowned dry air in flames, from your pulls pumping sighs.
I renounce your reluctant views on life.

Carving, thriving, awaking, denying
A glance at the other, for human, eternal.
Carving, thriving, awakening, denying.

Reluctantly, obsessively, drawing sticks through the soil commencing tales of it all.
Assumingly, possessively, twigs in monumental feature still a voice yet to be raised.

Come, ~frightened beyond ~the waves,
Accrued where all men rest.
Drowned dry air in flames, from your pulls pumping sighs.
I renounce your reluctant views on life.
