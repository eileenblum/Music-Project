From a hole in the dark, are shadows spots through total black?
Embraced and loved in a place with no eyes, it's what you hear, that you will always know.
Breaths go deep with nothing to fear, but themselves, through a hollow light.
Fascinated and disgusted you are, from enlightenment of others joining the feast.

Eating and serving your own lives.
You will never see the shades in black.
Continuously repeating time in time.
Sand goes nowhere but through itself.

Time will rapidly gain control and once more fail to exist.
When the eco fails to commit there is nowhere to go.
Still the feast moves toward glory in the absolute of darkness.
You wonder who to place as the rightful owner of madness.

In the era you create to strengthen your confession isolate you even more.

I hear your wounds, I hear your screams, as you tremble through the dark.
As the  enlightenment is refused to shine, there is nothing, but the dark.

Still you stay there screaming and awaiting the return of echo's reality.

I must laugh when watching you astray like sheep. I admire your heavy sleep.
Disgusted by your life I move past your shells. The created world you struggled to see is no more than a hole in the dark.

Pathetic dreamers, you don't realize who you are.

Whoring through your life. Try to capture a glance of it all. Only turning inwards,
I pity you miserable cunts.
