You will walk to the end and thousand more, mystically what you been hoping for.
As the eyes turn white and the spirit blooms, fascinated by the acts of death.
Your life will crumble in to pieces, and your tears will follow through.
It's the end for you no matter what you try to do.

Fascination of life will turn you to dust.

Try, to, see.
Life, dies, young.
Never, will, you.
See, beyond, you.

As your feet fall through, your soul will weep.
It's the only thing present for you.
In the crypt you see to praise.
The name will fade away.

Fascination of life will turn you to dust.

Try, to, see.
Life, dies, young.
Rot, away, human.
Scum, surround, your life.

Fascination of life, will turn you ~~ to dust.
Craving, walking, slowly moving. There is nothing there for you to praise.
Hurting, dissolving, slit your wrist,
You will never live through more than a dream.

You will walk to the end and thousand more, mystically what you been hoping for.
As the eyes turn white and the spirit blooms, fascinated by the acts of death.

Rot, away, human.
Scum, surround, your life.
Slit your wrist!
