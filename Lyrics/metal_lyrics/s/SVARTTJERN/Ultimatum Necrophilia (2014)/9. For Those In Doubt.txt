Beyond the stars I have searched. Turned roots to soil, from soil to stones, from stones to stars.
Throughout my time in depth. Turned seed to water, from water to life, from life to death.

I have felt the rain/ I have felt the hands/ Two I answer in fives glory.

So from the war of madness. Who will gain?

The only cycle. Lifeline presents for you.
Despondency. Pathetic lovers. Emotional chanting.
Your hopeless mirage.

While prints flourish to spring, settle in a new time. 
Dawn repeats itself, to subdue, completely.
While prints flourish to spring, settle in a new time.

Caress the after. Feel your sin. Embrace the submission. The wind whispering funeral tales.
((Hail the demon)). Scream his name. Spill your blood. A mask still stares for humankind.
Who repeated the cycle? What are sheep's astray? When emotions erect. As resin bleed, you're forced to open.

Beyond the stars I have searched. Turned roots to soil, from soil to stones, from stones to stars.
Throughout my time in depth. Turned seed to water, from water to life, from life to death.
As soft stem cracks, from the inside, withered and forgotten.
Behold the source of life!
