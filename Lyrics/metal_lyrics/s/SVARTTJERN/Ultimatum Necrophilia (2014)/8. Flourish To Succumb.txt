Seduced and thriving. Vigorously, I force the connection.
Time brought to life. From Satan's power I rise.
Anxiously of what to expect, why do I not dare to fall.
In the cover of darkness I have flourished from the dust.
In the air sensing heartbeats fading with the light. Come forth to me, come forth and pray.
Spells will punish you, with a soul decomposing.

I sentence you to die,
I sentence you to see your life.
I sentence you to see your life.

I pity your wounds, I pity your life.
When the flakes of your life crumble into pieces, when your wishes of life melts away like snow.
The fading harmony of your next of kin, falling leafs will obey!

To consume the life, digest the past.
To ride in storms, embrace the path.
Towards mountains eternal, acknowledge the king.
Absolute, seduction.
Satanic, sacrifice!

Take me! I have wandered now these forgotten paths!
Embrace me! All of humankind astray.
Leave me in eternal dwell

...But I awake. Forced back to the life. My mission now. To death!

My mission now. To death!
