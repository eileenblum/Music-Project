Finally I see what moves beneath your shallow life.
Powerless you are to see.

Consumed... so fearless... you preach and reach.
Believed to change an outcome, centuries weigh you down.
Change...
Honoring the signs!

Honoring the signs, from dust there has been so few.
I honor you my faithful one. Nowhere else... Nothing else.
Shifting shapes has now joined, in this majestic time to be.
Come to me...

In trance one sees, this gathering.
So distance, so surreal.
Wandering above, where is there to go?
Opening this disturbs your shallow waters.

Come to me now. Through your grief and sorrow. Dreams of purity shatter your consciousness.
Waves now coming from within, soil pushes through your empty shell.
Madness led to sanity when the water flowed to sea.
