Onwards till you die. Once wish comes dry when touched.
There are ways to flourish so far beyond, there are ways to die and travel on.

A secret, once told, and even more, believed.
There was a sheep, and a man, and a man, which cared.

Where goes this tale when two come apart, there are ways to come by and die all over.

Caring once said an elder and chosen,
There are ways to flourish, so far beyond,
There are ways to die
There are ways to die and travel on.

Through the words brought to mind, the journey came at hold.
How can one slaughter these prints of purpose?
Gave away four of the fruits, adore me now, now there is truth.

Adore me now.
This is submission.

Surrender in the dust, found himself too weak.
Though I have brought to light your own conclusion, you lay there weak.
There are ways to flourish so far beyond, there are ways to die and travel on.
There are ways to live and carry on.
