Long passed the reflected light
Stumbles a creature through the sea
In the time won by him alone
Six to return was never a thought

From corners of time
There was not only a second to come
A dawn to be, from the seeds, discovered
Bring forward the offering and he will grow

By this sacrifice of life
O hail Satan, he will grow

Now the altar bears the blood
And the offering accepted
He will guard upon this sacred seed
He tends to it as his own, my child

From corners of time
There was not only a second to come
A dawn to be, from the seeds, discovered
Bring forward the offering and he will grow

Now take this child and grow into its flesh!
Grow, grow, grow, grow into its flesh!

Now the altar bears the blood
And the offering accepted
He will guard upon this sacred seed
He tends to it as his own, my child
