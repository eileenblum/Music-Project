Out from a tunnel of flesh
With a mind of its own
Willingly you must forfeit from the battle of wits
There will be no more sorrow in this land of living

Lay down now
Your whispers and prayers

Growing, starving, depth

Lay down now
Your whispers and prayers
Wounds open once more
Your whispers and prayers
