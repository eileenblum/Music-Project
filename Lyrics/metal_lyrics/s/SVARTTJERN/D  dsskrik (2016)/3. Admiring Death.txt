Opened, searched, wizards grant thy will
Perfected pattern lay before an open door
Command strengths to force this return
Close down, hold the gate, you lie becoming fate

To many shooting stars
To many hopeful dreams
For long you have wished
Wished to be one of few

I see you now, I see you fade
For your dreams are forgotten, not buried, just never lit
For there was one with a thought
But there was so many else
Turn and see, you were never alone, never unique

Amusing it is to see
How you crave to be outstanding
But you are clipped and stripped
Giving me pleasuring thrills
I do admire your death

To many shooting stars
To many hopeful dreams
For long you have wished
Wished to be one of few
