Come forth, you're lying sin
Grasp and hold, a lie to win
You consume the dark whilst betrayed the light
Where plastic is soil, come enter the night

Chaos erupts in your mind
Confusion ties you to your path
Cloves have hardened the soil in time
So easy and possessive settling your wrath

Your wrath is the path to Satan!
Your wrath is the path to Satan!
Your wrath is the path to Hell!

All hail, all hail, all hail Satan!
All hail, all hail, all hail Satan!

Come forth, you're lying sin
Grasp and hold, a lie to win
You consume the dark whilst betrayed the light
Where plastic is soil, come enter the night

Soldiers will die in the fight with minds to enter the night

To stand in the battle, they are awake and alive
You are a game and a song, not dead or alive
Moved to conquer, moved and to be killed

Chaos erupts in your mind
Confusion ties you to your death
Cloves have hardened the soil in time
So easy and possessive settling your wrath

Your wrath is the path to Satan!
Your wrath is the path to Satan!
Your wrath is the path to Hell!

All hail, all hail, all hail Satan!
All hail, all hail, all hail Satan!

All hail Satan!
All hail, all hail, all hail Satan!
