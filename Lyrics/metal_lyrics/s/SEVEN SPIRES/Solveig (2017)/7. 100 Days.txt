Night falls
Light fades to shade
Lost to the sun's demise
He lies there alone
A cold, wandering soul
Lost in the stars in the sky

100 days of darkness
100 days of lonely bitter light
100 days of darkness
100 days of silence and peace

The cold sinks and settles in
Shivering in the dark he waits
For the lonely moon to rise
From the frozen earth he watches
Venus growing soft
Illuminating the night

A single spark is worth the fight.
