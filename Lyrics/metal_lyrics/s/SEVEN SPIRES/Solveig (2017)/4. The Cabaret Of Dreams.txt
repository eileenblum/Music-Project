Welcome to a state of dreams
Where everything's as real as you let it be
I will be your host this eve
So sit back, relax and I guarantee

If you take it, embrace it, succumb to the dark
Escape into a night where no one knows who you are
You crave it, awake it, the coeur bizarre
Lose yourself to the twisted art

Hey! Don't be afraid
Hey! You'll be amazed
Let your demons out
Let your spirit free
It's only gonna cost you your soul
The Cabaret of Dreams

Now we're in a waking dream
Subconscious reality
Monsieur have a drink and see
The dancers dance and the singers sing

If you take it, embrace it, succumb to the dark
Escape into a night where no one knows who you are
You crave it, awake it, the coeur bizarre
Lose yourself to the twisted art

Hey! Don't be afraid
Hey! You'll be amazed
Let your demons out
Let your spirit free
It's only gonna cost you your soul
The Cabaret of Dreams
Hey! Don't be afraid
Hey! You'll be amazed
Let your sanity go, it ain't yours to keep
It's only gonna cost you your soul
The Cabaret of Dreams

Damned is he who walks with these disenchanted souls
Damned are those lost and pitiless
Our freedom lies in the conflagrant morn
Bereft of hope, there is no escape

Seek out the light
Save us all
Or fall prey
Hear our cry
Save us all

Hey! Don't be afraid
Hey! You'll be amazed
You'll be back for more if you ever leave
It's only gonna cost you your soul
The Cabaret of Dreams
