Thereâs a certain look that lies
Behind your sunken eyes, I know
How shadows fall across your face

You breathed and gave them life
Didnât you wonder how they know
All your nightmares and your memories?

Wouldnât it be grand to never face the morning sun?
Donât you long to rest your weary head for good?
By the light of the crescent moon, Iâll pray your soul will keep
So close your eyes, close your eyes

When the sun slips down to dusk
Beneath the horizon where youâll be
All but enveloped by your sins,

Watch your body turn to dust
Tossed to the wind and scattered by
All your nightmares and your memories

Darling, Iâve got you now, donât you cry
The pain only lingers if you fight
Hush now, my dear, youâve nothing to fear
Itâs only the end come to take you to sleep
