Breath without living isn't truly life at all
You've been numb so long
Recall the chill of the night upon your skin
Let me show you nowâthere is so much more than this

Take my hand now
But remember
Should you leave, you won't return
A single ray of sunlight, and your soul will burn

Fear me and love me, that is all that I desire
Your soul for eternal bliss
Anything you require, any deepest dark desire
Will be satisfied, it will be my pleasure

Take my hand now
But remember
Should you leave, you won't return
A single ray of sunlight, and your soul will burn

You are weak, my dear, clear your mind
(Choose well or suffer til the end of your life)
Will you stay with me for all time?
(Would you trade your mortal life to be mine?)
Give up all you know to ease your pain
(The deepest black with no escape)
To be free of fear, what price would you pay?
(Nevermore to see the light of day)
