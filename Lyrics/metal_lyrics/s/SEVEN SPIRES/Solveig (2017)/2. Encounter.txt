Angel of your hell away from home
Wings of dusk to carry you wherever you may roam
Watching for your time

I am the Siren of the Eventide
To guide your lonely soul to shore

A loner born beneath a midnight star
Lost beneath the emerald waves, through hellish sun and frost, you're never far
From a place you don't belong

I am the Siren of the Eventide
To guide your lonely soul to shore
I am the needle still beneath your skin
Salvation from the ache that burns within
