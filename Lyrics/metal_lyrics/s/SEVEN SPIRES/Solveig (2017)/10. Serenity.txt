The abyss looked so cold tonight
as you stared into the depths more inviting than the light
And the mists curled like torn paper in the air
Celebrate the end of all pain and despair

Serenity, (be my guardian)
You're all I've left to hold
Agony, (give me purpose)
Your scarlet warms me in the cold
Ash, rain down (on me)
Let me hide in your grey
Storm, show your anger
Let me sink beneath these waves

Down into depths we dive
Searching for the numbness you traded for your life
Could you drown, become your demise?
Crush the air out of your lungs, but you will never die

I swore to give you all you'd need
I swore to fulfill every dream
Don't you fall into a sleep where I can't reach you
