The ocean took me in its arms and cradled
Held my heart so gently, calmed my soul, it seems
That I may never make my last return
Well, perhaps the night is where I'm meant to be

So cold and yet so warm
Numb and far away from harm
Distant lights a dancing glow so far from me

Could you forgive me, all I've said and done you wrong
Though I'm blind, beneath the surface I can see
A glow, though I cannot be sure it's you
Another time I would have strayed and let you
Burn my wings and let me fall
I'd worship you and give you all of me
I would have followed you wherever you'd lead

I will pledge my final breath to your name
Here at the end of my days
Pray you won't deny my chance to repay
Another time, another life

Another night the ocean was an emerald sea
That glitters in my mind from time to time
It's an old wound that remains a distant memory
Though not a day goes by that I don't think of
What has come to pass and how
A flame should never burn this long
And mine was gone the moment that I kissed those waves

I will pledge my final breath to your name
Here at the end of my days
Pray you won't deny my chance to repay
Another time, another life

I will pledge my final breath to your name
Here at the end of my days
Pray you won't deny my chance to repay
Another time, another life

I will pledge my final breath to your name
Here at the end of my days
Pray you won't deny my chance to repay
Another time, another life

Another time, another life
