Out of the darkness, a light shines bright alone
This broken dawn set me alight
No looking back now, I'll do this on my own
But would you let me go tonight
From the ashes we will rise
A burning pyre that brought us back to life
That tiny spark was worth the fight
No looking back now, I'll leave it all behind
I will remember you and rise
We'll rise

One last breath
Never again
One final goodbye
And from the ashes we will rise
