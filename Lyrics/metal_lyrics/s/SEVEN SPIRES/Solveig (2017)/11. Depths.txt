Cold and dark
Drift in empty space
Among the leaves and sand
Brush the current
I am blind
Dive into this reflection
(Welcome home)

Now I beg for dreamless sleep
I pray here that my soul will keep

Crushing silence fills up lungs
Ice preserve the skin and bone

Now I beg for dreamless sleep
I pray here that my soul will keep
An endless dream with time untold
I pray these waves a life will hold

Breathe, I can't inhale this fire
Lungs will rot and eyes grow darker
Beat, a heart that fails in water
I can see the surface and the sun

Now I beg for dreamless sleep
I pray here that my soul will keep
An endless dream with time untold
I pray these waves a life will hold
