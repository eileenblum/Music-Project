O Dormant, Hungry Fire of Morn
Heed your master's call
Consume the worthless, wretched lives
That plague your sacred hall

To fill the lungs and pierce the flesh
With rock and with sea and with smoke
Choke this land from existence
Hear the words your master spoke:

I, who guides the lonely souls to shore
And takes the lost to keep them warm
Chained here to ease our pain
Succumb to peace for a hundred days
I have found what I set out to find
A love to cut my binds, so
End this curse upon my soul
Let us bathe in flame, so we may
Burn

(A single spark to burn the night away)
Burn
(A beacon of dawn to turn the night to day)
Burn
(A single spark burning the night away)
Burn
(A beacon of dawn turning the night to sky)

Such is my will, thus the ultimate law
Eternity no longer bound
Rejoice, and mourn this sovereignty's fall
May our elegy forever resound
Now torment the seas and bring down the skies
Suffered creations, unmade
Bask in the ruin, consuming and bright
I welcome this terrible fate

I, who guides the lonely souls to shore
And takes the lost to keep them warm
Chained here to ease our pain
Succumb to peace for a hundred days
I have found what I set out to find
A love to cut my binds, so
End this curse upon my soul
Let us bathe in flame, so we may
Burn

(A single spark to burn the night away)
Burn
(A beacon of dawn to turn the night to day)
Burn

Take a step my dear, don't close your eyes
Don't regret your choice this time
We'll have one last dance before we say goodbye
Fare thee well, I bid you goodnight

All I have to offer is a memory
A song upon your tongue for you to hold
Deep in the ashes, would you bury me
And bear the wicked fire to walk alone?

Take my light in your hands and do not look back
Take my breath and build yourself anew
Renew my sentence, take my tears
Another thousand silent years
Just to see your smile light your face once more
Go now and live as you've never lived before
