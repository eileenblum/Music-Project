The chapter's done, the pages torn
The book's turned to dust
A lifetime of dreams and best intentions

Hunched shoulders and sheltering waves
Of copper and ivory and dusk
Shielded the empty sky pouring down

Take away everything I love about this pain
So it won't haunt me anymore
Cut me off, cut it out
So it won't haunt me anymore

Every heart craves closure
Each more difficult than the last
Else they grasp onto shreds of hope, the asphyxiated dead

The heavens split open, the day's undone
The earth wrenches apart
Every syllable gushing from a crumbling mind:

Take away everything I love about this pain
So it won't haunt me anymore
Cut me off, cut it out
So it won't haunt me anymore

Can you escape your destiny?
Do you control your own fate?
Temptation's suffocating
Do you know what you've become?
