Tear back the skin and carve my name in the bone
(In the bone)
I pray for water to wash away this hole
You can blind me and feed me to the wolf

I'll never get out alive

The last breath you take
I hope you're suffering
You'll never say my name
You'll never say my name
I'll turn my back and walk away
We'll never be the same
We'll never be the same

All right!
Yeah!

I climb your mountain to prove I'm still alive
(Still alive, still alive!)
So lets be honest we both have blood on our hands
(On our hands, on our hands!)
You wash yours off and I wear mine like a crown

I'll never get out alive

The last breath you take
I hope you're suffering
You'll never say my name
You'll never say my name
I'll turn my back and walk away
We'll never be the same
We'll never be the same

(We'll never be the same
You're never gonna change!)

I find it hard to say to you
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
It took so long for me to leave
You're never gonna change
You're never gonna change

The last breath you take
I hope you're suffering
You'll never say my name
You'll never say my name
I'll turn my back and walk away
We'll never be the same
We'll never be the same

I'll turn my back
I'll turn my back on you
(On you!)
