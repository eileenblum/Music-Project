I wake up spinning oh so selfishly
And I know this is all my fault
I toss and turn from all my restlessness
Don't you, don't you just disapprove

I missed the mark again
How could I shoot so blindly
I'm falling faster now
So please don't catch me

Lets all just stand around
While I'm ripping at the seams
It's getting closer now
As I'm fading patiently

I've watch you walking circles in my head
And I know yes I know just who you are
Its time for you to put your mask away
And let me, let me stare in your eyes

I missed the mark again
How could I shoot so blindly
I'm falling faster now
So please don't catch me

Lets all just stand around
While I'm ripping at the seams
It's getting closer now
As I'm fading patiently
I've watch them all rip right into me
Lets all just stand around
While I'm ripping at the seams

I won't let you make it up to me
I don't wanna
I don't wanna see you close your eyes
NO
I'll make you stare right back at me vacantly
You'll sink and I'll survive

I missed the mark again
I missed the mark again

Lets all just stand around
While I'm ripping at the seams
It's getting closer now
As I'm fading patiently
I've watch them all rip right into me
I've watch them all rip right into me
I've watch them all rip right into me
