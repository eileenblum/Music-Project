Flat on my back you watch me dry out my lungs
Remembering the days when I collected the sun
Isn't this all just a part of the process
Isn't this all just a part of it

Watch me fall underneath what you believe
I couldn't save you from killing me

Untie my hands so I can drink from your cup
I'm outta demands if I could just stand up
Isn't this all just a part of my process
Isn't this all just a part of it

You're killing me

Stared you in the eyes through the shadow of death
I prayed with all the sinners and I've felt no regrets
Swimming in water
Swallowing all the words

I cannot sink here anymore
I have to head straight for the shore
I will believe
