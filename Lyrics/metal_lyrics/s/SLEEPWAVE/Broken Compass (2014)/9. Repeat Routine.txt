The air is thinner where I breathe
It drains the life right out of me
I'm staring lifeless on my knees
Can someone please just rescue me

Can't get it right
It's all in my head
When will it end
A blinding light will guide my way
So I can start again

This vicious cycle never ends
Define the Line where it all begins
I've seen the darkness in the day
Remove rebuild get up and walk away

It's in my fucking head

I walked the sun and burnt my feet
I kissed the moon
Tasted defeat
Never again will I sink so fast
GET OUT

Get out
Just get out of my head
