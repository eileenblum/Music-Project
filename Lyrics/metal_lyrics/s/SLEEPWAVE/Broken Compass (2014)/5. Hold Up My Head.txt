Silence hit my ears for the first time
In this moment I'm all alone
The lights have blurred and I'm growing numb now
I barely feel the thorns rip through my hands

I've learned to watch them drown
Every last one of them could choke for all I care

I suffered at your hand and under your law
If I met your God I'd be at a loss with nothing to say

No I never ever thought it'd come to this
Now I'm the empty one with no one here left to hold up my head
You hold my head

There's no one left here to hold up my head
