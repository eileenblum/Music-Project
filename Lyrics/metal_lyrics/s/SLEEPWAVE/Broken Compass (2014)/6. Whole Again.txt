Lurking deep in our insides
There is something we were never supposed to find

I know that they could never find me
Inside we were always the ones who were empty
Its time to open up your eyes

They're coming against the burdens that I bear
When everything's lost and there's nowhere left for you to run
We are the answer
We are the end of all

My soul was sold before I could breathe in
They try to scratch out every feeling
You make me never wanna sleep

They're coming against the burdens that I bear
When everything's lost and there's nowhere left for you to run
We are the answer

I'll never save you
I'll only bring you down
I never gave you a chance

They're coming against the burdens that I bear
When everything's lost and there's nowhere left for you to run
We are the answer
