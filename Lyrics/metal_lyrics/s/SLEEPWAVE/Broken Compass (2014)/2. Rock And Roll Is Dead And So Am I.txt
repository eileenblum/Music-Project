Dove into the water
And give myself away
Here I can find my place
Here is where I stay
Didn't you see this coming, didn't I hear you say
That everything I ever was never mattered anyway

Falling in deeper you'll never save me
I hear the voices but no one hears me
I will just stay here till I don't feel safe
I don't expect you to fade away
Nothing is calm here and nothing feels right
We're all dying just on the inside

Head touch the surface
And see them reach in
There's something about the outside
Makes me sink again
Didn't you see this coming, didn't I hear you say
That everything I ever did never mattered anyway

Falling in deeper you'll never save me
I hear the voices but no one hears me
I will just stay here till I don't feel safe
I don't expect you to fade away
Nothing is calm here and nothing feels right
We're all dying just on the inside

Stare into the empty soul that I bear
I bear
Stare into the empty soul that I bear
I bear

I will just stay here till I don't feel safe
I don't expect you to fade away
Nothing is calm here and nothing feels right
We're all dying just on the inside

I will just stay here till I don't feel safe
I don't expect you to fade away
Nothing is calm here and nothing feels right
We're all dying just on the inside
