I can't believe in you
Just being honest
I'm never honest to you
The way the air feels now
Well I can taste it
I'll never taste you again

Remember when you were young
Be patient before you're all used up
There's not enough to tear the mask away

Just be patient

It's not the way it has to be
So cold and alone we left our skin behind
No it's not too late for you

So be patient

I'll take my own
No one will find me
Right here I will make my home
I'll step outside and breathe for the first time

Be patient because you're not alone
