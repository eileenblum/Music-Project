I'm sick of running circles in this place
I gotta get out while I'm still alive
If everything was raped and taken from my hands
I'd be just fine
I feel it hanging on the edge of you and I
So open wide

And I'll watch you fade away

So why don't you just fire me down
So what if you could fire me down

I'd rather be the one you lie about
Than the one you lie to
That's just the truth
So let me dive right into you
And make you whole again

And I'll watch you fade away

So why don't you just fire me down
So what if you could fire me down
I've been medicated for way too long
So please please why don't you fire

I cannot breathe 
I can't make a sound
I'm already sick of this town
If I count the days here till you're not around
I'm already sick

Just like paper planes
Torn up and thrown away

So please please why don't you fire me down
