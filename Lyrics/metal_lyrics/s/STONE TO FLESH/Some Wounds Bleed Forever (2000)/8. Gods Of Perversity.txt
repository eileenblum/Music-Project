He quote: "I drink this blood for you!"
And drunk the cup 'till last drop
He quote: "I eat this heart for you!!!"
And eternity wrote his words

Gods of perversity
Below from wizened hearts
Gods of perversity
Drunk of sweat, sperm and blood

Beyond the veil of voracius darkness
In the night of feasting of blood
He walk alone through valleys of fear
To smell the death and share the anguish

Gods of perversity
Below from wizened hearts
Gods of perversity
Drunk of sweat, sperm and blood

"I drink this blood for you!"
"I eat this heart for you!"
"I slay this whore for you!"
"I spill this sperm for you!"

And blood flushed on his face
And cum on wringgling body
And drunk the cup 'till last drop
And eternity wrote his words

He quote: "I slay this whore for you!"
And blood flushed on his face
He quite: "I spill this sperm for you!"
And cum on wringgling body

Gods of perversity
Below from wizened hearts
Gods of perversity
Drunk of sweat, sperm and blood

Gods of perversity
Below from wizened hearts
Gods of perversity
Drunk of sweat, sperm and blood

Gods of perversity
Gods of perversity
Gods of perversity
Gods of perversity
