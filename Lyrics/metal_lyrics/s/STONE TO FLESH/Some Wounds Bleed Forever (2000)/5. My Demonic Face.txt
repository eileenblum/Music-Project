Resurrection
See the fire throught the veil of night
The son of twilight
In the fields of anger evilized

My Demonic Face
My Demonic Face

Open the gates of the dark horizons
The blood is my only desire
Fill my flesh with Devil's power
And kill with me

Open the gates of the dark horizons
And trough my soul in fire
Wandering shadows broods trough my thoughts
Towards the relaims of the Dim.

I spill the blood in the face of the god
From lacerated laringies of angels
And chew their worm and tender hearts
Full of shining steam
While the storms wilding in my soul

I voim the selphur at the heavens gate
And share the death as a charity to humanity
And raise my sword above the corpses
And raise my sword in the name of honour
Of Blasphemic BLOOD
BLOOD!!!!

Resurrection
See the fire through the veil of night
The son of twilight
In the fields of anger evilized
Desecration
See the fire throuh the veil of night
Born to wander
Through areas of eternal DARK.
