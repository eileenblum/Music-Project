Spit on mankind with mouth full of the growling hate
And summon the howling winds of war
I dig the grave for the slaughtered world,
With hands 'till elbows in blood 

Recognize me in the raven,
Which rip the dismal sky,
I fight the battle that I am cursed on
Alone against all...

I believe in power of evil,
And ride under it's banner,
I fight the battle that I am cursed on
Alone against all...

...bleed forever...

The devil's looking through my eyes,
The devil is smith of my ravenous swords,
The devil squirming in my heart
And painting all my visions in red.

Some wounds bleed forever,
bleed forever 

Spit on mankind with mouth full of the growling hate 
And summon the howling winds of war
I dig the grave for the slaughtered world,
With hands 'till elbows in blood 

The devil's looking through my eyes,
The devil is smith of my ravenous swords,
The devil squirming in my heart
And painting all my visions in red.

Some wounds bleed Misanthropy.
