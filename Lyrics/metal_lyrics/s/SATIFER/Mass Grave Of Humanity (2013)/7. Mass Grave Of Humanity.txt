Break those chains , release my soul
carved in a cold stone
of iron will and iron star
transformed in a human mind

Made of hopes and dreams
a human soul
with courage of a god
just serving like a dog

Life
endless dying
inside mass grave of humanity

Blind hate and blind love
words glorifying the dead
rotten sound and rotten hearts
my veins are strings on your harp

You play death - you play life
songs of laughs and songs of cries
piercing human existance
like spears and...

Fears
a short existance
before mass grave of humanity

Before...endless...NOTHINGNESS!!!
what have you lived for?
for cheep words and cheaper deeds?
forever waiting, mourning, for release!!!
