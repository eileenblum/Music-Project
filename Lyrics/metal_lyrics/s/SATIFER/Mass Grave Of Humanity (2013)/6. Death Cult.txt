Rivers of feces 
Rivers of blood 
Nothing can stop us 
Nothing can stop us 

Worshiping darkness 
Worshiping dust 
Mountains of corpses 
Creating death cult 

Into the dust we shall all fall 
Nothing can save us 
Nothing can stop us 
No gallows are too high 
No grave that's too deep 
Creating death cult - everlasting dream 

Roads full of thorns 
Roads full of bones 
Nothing can stop us 
Nothing can stop us 

Worshiping shadows 
Worshiping dust 
Mountains of corpses 
Forever sleep 

Prolonging of shadows means falling of light 
Fall to the grave there is no way out 
Stumble in darkness sun will no longer rise 
Join mountains of corpses - death cult
