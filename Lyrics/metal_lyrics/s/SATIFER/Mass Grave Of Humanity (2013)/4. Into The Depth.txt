Cursed to search but never to find
closing the circle ending life
endless creation and total destruction
sands of time tear my skin

Blood flows down to signal the end
of lifes pleasures - to tear down the crown
as it whispers love into your ears
takes your life and binds you down
DEEP INTO THE GRAVE!

Deep enough to vanish me away
from this hollow world
away from this shallow life
far away to distant spheres

Blood flows down to signal the end
of lifeless pleasures (to tear down the crown)
as it whispers love into your ears
takes your life and binds you down

Between the stars and cosmos dust
where planets are born into everlasting darkness
space so full of breathtaking sights
Astral beings
Astral life

Astral death and rebirth - endless circle of life and death
