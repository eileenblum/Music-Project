You are all afraid of hell 
die with your sins if you dare 
it is mindless to feel fear 
life is your hell - you are here 
Hell is when your thoughts fly out 
and your soul screams through your mouth 
then is time to kill your self 
now is time to kill yourself 

You are all afraid of hell 
die with your sins if you dare 
it is mindless to feel fear 
life is your hell - you are here 
Time has come to end your life 
with a knife in single strife 
it is time to end your hell 
it is time to end your hell
