Emptiness is eating me,and my rotten heart
All I ever felt is hate toward human kind
Every day a brainwashed words - you need to push on with life
But no one can truly see - I AM NOT ALIVE!

I AM NOT ALIVE
EAT MY ROTTEN HEART
I AM NOT ALIVE
I AM DEAD INSIDE
(I AM!!!DEAD INSIDE!!!)

Everything is black and death is breathing down my spine
Everyday I rip some part of me and loose it with my mind
Till you vomit up your life and vomit up your faith
All I ever felt for you is pure and honest hate

I AM NOT ALIVE
EAT MY ROTTEN HEART
I AM NOT ALIVE
I AM DEAD INSIDE

I AM!!!DEAD INSIDE!!!
I AM NOT ALIVE
I AM!!!DEAD INSIDE!!!
I AM NOT ALIVE
I AM DEAD INSIDE
