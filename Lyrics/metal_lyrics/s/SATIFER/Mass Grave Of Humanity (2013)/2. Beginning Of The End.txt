Embraced by the darkest night 
deep depresion - end of life 
Suffering for 20 years 
no single smile just blood and tears 
Point where you can not take 
all that shit and people fake 
In my hand I'm holding gun 
tonight I end pointless life 

Betrayed by this wretched world 
disappointed by the scum 
Human lies and human games 
disappointment till the end 
Pictures of this pointless shit 
that we call existance 
There is nothing to live for 
I slowly walk into the night 

I am forever taken by night 
the only feeling- melancholy 
A deep depresion crushing my chests 
storming hate engulfing me
