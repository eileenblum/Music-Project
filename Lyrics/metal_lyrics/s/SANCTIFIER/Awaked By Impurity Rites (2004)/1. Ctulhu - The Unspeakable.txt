DRINK IN MY CHALICE - I AM CTULHU
CALLING MY NAME
IN THE VORTEX OF WATER I SHALL RISE
THE CARNAL PLEASURES I GIVE TO YOU
TO THE SIGN OF YOUR DEVOTION

I'M SHUB NIGGURATH - THE HORNED IMMORTAL
FOR THE MAD ARAB ABDUL I WISH "WAKE-UP"
IN AL-AZIF NOISES, YOU HEAR ME CALLING
I CAN SHOW TO THE WORLD MY WORDS AND MY HATE

IN R'YLEH I LIVE , IN YOUR WISHES I WISH
CALL THE SON OF MY BLASPHEMY
FROM THE HIGH OF ANCIENT TOWERS
CALL THE SON OF MY BLASPHEMY

WAKE UP !!! HELLSPAWN !!
MONSTROSITY !!! HELLSPAWN !!

THE ELDER SIGN PROTECT ME, CTHULU RAISE
THE ELDER SIGN CONSACRATE ME, CTHULU RAISE
IN DEVOTION?

DESECRATE, BLASPHEMATE, THE HOLYNESS
EXECRATE THE SYMBOLS OF THE FAITH
DESECRATE, BLASPHEMATE THE HOLYNESS
AWAKE THE IMPIOUS AND ABOMINATE

IN R'YLEH I LIVE , IN YOUR WISHES I WISH
CALL THE SON OF BLASPHEMY
FROM THE HIGH OF ANCIENT TOWERS
CALL THE SON OF BLASPHEMY

KILL THE GODS ! HELLSPAWN !
CONSACRATE THE BLOOD ! ABOMINATION !

THE ELDER SIGN PROTECT ME, CTHULU RAISE
THE ELDER SIGN CONSACRATE ME, CTHULU RAISE
IN DEVOTION?
