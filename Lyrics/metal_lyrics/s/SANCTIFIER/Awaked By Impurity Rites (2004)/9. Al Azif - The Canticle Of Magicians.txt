THE WORDS OF BLASPHEMY WAS SPOKEN
ANCIENT WORDS LOST IN THE OBNOXIOUS TIME

ECHOING IN THE COLD FIELDS
RAPING THE MILLENAR WALLS OF STONE

FLESH OF MY FLESH, BOOK OF THE DEAD
IMMEMORIAL COLD RITUALS
SACRIFICE, UNBORN SACRILEGE
SCREAMING THE WORDS OF DOOM

ECHOING IN THE COLD FIELDS
RAPING THE MILLENAR WALLS OF STONE

GATEWAYS TO THE ANNIHILATION
DESTROYED PITS OF CONSCIENCE
ENTERING THE CLOUDS OF MADNESS
HATE AND FEAR, SHADOWS AND DREAMS

BURIED GODS BY OLD ENCHANTMENTS
PAGES WRITTEN IN BLOOD
UNPURE SOUL IN A EXCTASY OF LIGHTS
AN ORGY OF WORDS AND DARK FEELINGS

AL AZIF
TEKELI-LI
IA
IA
TEKELI-LI
AL AZIF
IA
IA

I AM THE ONE
I AM THE OLDEST
MY SCREAMS ARE LOUD
CANTICLE OF MAGICIANS

[Music by Alexandre Emerson, Lyric by FÃ¡bio Brayner]
