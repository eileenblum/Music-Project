"THE LAVES THAT RESTLESSLY ROLL
THEIR SULPHUROUS CURRENTS DOWN
YAANEK, IN THE ULTIMATE CLIMES OF THE POLE
YAANEK, IN THE REALMS OF THE BOREAL POLE"
[H.P. Lovecraft]

NYARLATHOTEP RAISE, DARK ANGELS FLYING HIGH
UPON THE IMPIOUS DESERT , HUMAN FLESH EATERS
CTULHU IS COMING, DREAMING BUT NOT DEAD
FROM THE FIFTH DIMENSIONS OF RED CHAOS

ELDER SIGN - COLD SYMBOL FROM THE DEEPS
ELDER SIGN - GATES TO UNREAL DREAMS

LENG'S CREATURES OF MY HATEFUL MIND
INOMINABLE BEASTS OF ETHEREAL SPACE
FROM THE FIVE WORLDS WITHOUT WINDOWS
SPILLING THE FETID WATER OF THE UNREAL SWAMP

NYARLATHOTEP RAISE, DARK ANGELS FLYING HIGH
UPON THE IMPIOUS DESERT, HUMAN FLESH EATERS
CUTHULHU IS COMING, DREAMING BUT NOT DEAD
FROM THE FIFTH DIMENSION OF RED CHAOS

ABOMINATIONS
INFERNAL EMANATIONS OF A DARK DREAM
NO MERCY VOCIFERATIONS
BURNED WALL OF CONSCIOUSNESS

RULES OF LUST AND INFAMY
HORRORS BEYOND OUR SANITY

ABOMINATIONS RISE

[Music by Alexandre Emerson, Lyric by FÃ¡bio Brayner]
