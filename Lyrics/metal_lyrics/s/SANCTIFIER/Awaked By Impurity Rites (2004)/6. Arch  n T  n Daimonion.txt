I'M SEMYAZA ... MASTER OF GUARDIANS
I'M THE SOURGE OF ALL THE EVIL
I SPAWN THE MALIGN DESIRES
I BRING DOWN THE HOLY ORDERS
I'LL SIT DOWN ONTO THE MOUNTAIN
WHERE THE GODS FIND ITSELVES
I'LL RISE OVER THE CLOUDS
AND I'LL BE LIKE THE HIGHEST ONE
THE BENE HÃ-ELOHIM WILL FALL IN DISGRACE
OF LUST AND PRIDE, LEAVING THE
WEAK JESUS CHRIST
AND NOW I'LL SERVE TO THE EVIL MASTER
WHERE I'LL COMMAND THE MALIGN DESIRES

MERCY - HE'LL REQUEST
MERCY - HE'LL IMPLORE
MERCY - HE'LL SUPLICATE

IN MY ALTAR I PAINTED THE BLACK PENTAGRAM
I DRINK YOUR BLOOD ON THE CHALICE OF LIES
YOUR FOLLOWERS CRYING FOR MERCY
AND MY BATTLE AGAINST THE HOLY ORDERS IS ETERNAL
