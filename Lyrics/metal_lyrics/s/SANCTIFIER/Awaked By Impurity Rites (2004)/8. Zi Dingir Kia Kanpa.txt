BURIED IN THE SANDS OF IMMORALITY
BLASPHEMIES OCCULTED BY THE DARKNESS
PERVERSE MEMORIES, TOMBS REVEALED
ANCIENT SPIRITS OF MY STRANGE DREAMS

EMPTY PAGES - EXORCISM WORDS
BARRA EDIN NA ZU !!!
BOOK OF PERVERSION

ZI DINGIR KIA KANPA !!!
MY PRAYERS ARE STRONGEST
ZI DINGIR ANNA KANPA !!!
THE CIRCLE BELONGS TO ME

I FALL THE STEPS OF UNKNOWN
PILLARS OF ANCIENT STENCH
ETHEREAL ECHOES SCREAMING FEAR
ANNOUNCED MANIFESTATION

EMPTY PAGES - EXORCISM WORDS
BARRA EDIN NA ZU !!!
BOOK OF PERVERSION

ZI DINGIR KIA KANPA !!!
MY PRAYERS ARE STRONGEST
ZI DINGIR ANNA KANPA !!!
THE CIRCLE WAS WRITTED IN HUMAN BLOOD

REVENGE IS BASED IN THE COLD GUILTY
OF LIVE IN THE MISERY OF TRUE REALITY
LABYRINTHS OF CHAOS AND HORROR
DARKENED SCREAMS OF OUR OWN DEMONS

BURIED IN THE SANDS OF IMMORALITY
BLASPHEMIES OCCULTED BY THE DARKNESS
PERVERSE MEMORIES, TOMBS REVEALED
ANCIENT SPIRITS OF MY STRANGE DREAMS

[Music by Alexandre Emerson, Lyric by FÃ¡bio Brayner]
