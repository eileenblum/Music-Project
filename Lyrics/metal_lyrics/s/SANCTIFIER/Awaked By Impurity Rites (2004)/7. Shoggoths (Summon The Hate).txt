SHOGGOTHS - COMES UNTIL ME
COMES TO PROVE ITS DEVOTION
TAKES PLASMIC FORM
BURN THE SACRED LAND

SUMMON THE HATE

SHOGGOTHS - I SUMMON YOU
COMMANDS YOU ACQUIRING HUMAN FORM
FELL THE CARNAL PLEASURES
SMELL MY SIN

Y'AI 'NG'NGAH
YOG-SOTHOTH
H'EE-L'GEB
F'AI 'THRODOG
UAAAH

DRINK OF ALL PERVERSITIES
STUDIES ALL SCIENCES
DESTROY ALL THE SACRED SYMBOLS
PROFANATE THE HOLY TRINITY

OGTHROD AI'F
GEB'L - EE'H
YOG-SOTHOTH
'NGAH'NG AI'Y
ZHRO
