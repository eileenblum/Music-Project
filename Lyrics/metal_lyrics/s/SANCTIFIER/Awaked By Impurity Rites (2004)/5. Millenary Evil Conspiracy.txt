THROWING UP HATE OVER THE LAND
UNLEASHED FEAR UPON THE CHAPEL
CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HOLY LIES
CAPTIVE SOULS OF MALIGN SPELLS
DROWED INTO THE NIGHT

ABOMINATIONS - FEEL THE SENSATIONS
BORN IN BLASPHEMY - SCREAMS - ECSTASY

SLAVES OF DARKNESS - MILLENARY
STAND UP TO DESECRATE - EVIL
FIRE FROM BEYOND THE SPACE - CONSPIRACY
THE ABOMINATION IS COMING

MIASMATIC ANCIENT SMELL
INVADE THE PEACE OF CHRIST
AN OBSCENE CREEPING ENTITY
RISE FROM HIS MILLENARY GRAVE

MILLENARY EVIL CONSPIRACY

ABOMINATIONS - FEEL THE SENSATIONS
BORN IN BLASPHEMY - SCREAMS - ECSTASY

HAIL ALYAH VADAR !!!!!
DOWNFALL THE HOLY EMPIRE !!!
FOREVER !!!!

[Music by Alexandre Emerson, Lyric by FÃ¡bio Brayner &amp; Alexandre Emerson]
