LOST CITIES FROM THE ENTIRE EARTH
RESSURRECTED BY THE CALLING OF CTHULHU
UNHOLY ANCIENT MASTERS
AWAKED BY IMPURITY RITES
PROFANE SPELLS FROM NECRONOMICON
SECRET KNOWLEDGE TO INVOCATE THE EVIL
INTO THE CITY OF R'LYEH
FOLLOWERS CELEBRATE THE RETURN

NIGHTMARES CONTROL THE MINDS OF THE MORTALS
BESTIAL IMAGE OF AN OBSCURE ENTITY
TWIST THEIR SOULS AS THE TOWERS
OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM - RISE FROM THE WORLD ENTRAILS

BLACKNED PRIEST - OPEN THE GATE
RECEIVE THE LORD NOW...

THE RITUAL OF THE LOST CITIES NOW IS DONE
AT THE LAND A LEGION OF FREAKS RISE
THE SPAWN OF SHUBB NIGGURATH
THE GOAT OF THOUSAND YOUNGS

[Music by Kleberson Porpino, Alexandre Emerson, Marcos FlÃ¡vio, Victor FÃ¡bio and Luis Claudio, Lyric by Kleberson Porpino]
