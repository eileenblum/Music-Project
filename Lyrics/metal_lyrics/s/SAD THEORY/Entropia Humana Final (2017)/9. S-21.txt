[Between 1975 and 1979, Cambodia was ruled by Pol-Pot's Khmer Rouge. Under its policies, extrajudicial imprisonment and executions were widespread. One symbol of this period is Tuol Sleng, or S-21. This former school was converted to a detention and torture center. Perceived enemies of the regime were kept there and tortured until giving names of "co-conspirators", which were then also arrested and tortured, and then killed. One quarter of the whole nation's population (about 2 million people) perished in the Cambodian Genocide]

ClarÃ£o fustigante na mata cerrada
Rebentos zelosos de uma nova ordem
A essÃªncia do homem Ã© remodelada
OrdÃ¡lia brutal, malogros que eclodem

E busque-se e mate-se o nefelibata
Pois a redenÃ§Ã£o se darÃ¡ pela terra
Queime-se o sÃ¡bio, enterre-se a prata
Purifique-se o ar por meio da guerra

Um Ãªxodo urbano rumado ao abismo
Pilhas de corpos por todos os lados
E todas as formas de iluminismo
SÃ£o pontos de mÃ¡cula a ser expurgados

Selva adentro, tortura-se a todos
Sala de aula tornada em masmorra
Brasas, grilhÃµes, pÃ¡s e eletrodos
Entregue seus pares, definhe e morra

Fluxo imenso, manÃ¡ para as feras
Retratos de internos desesperados
Gritos de dor que ecoam por eras
Pelos corredores mal-assombrados

[English translation:]

Blinding flashlights in the dense jungle
Zealous offsprings of a new order
The essence of men is reshaped
Brutal ordeal, evils that blossom

Let the cloud-dwellers be found and killed
For redemption is achieved through the soil
Burn the wise man, bury the silver
Purify the air through war

An urban exodus headed towards the abyss
Piles of corpses everywhere
And all forms of enlightment
Are dirty spots demanding purge

In the heart of the jungle, all are tortured
Classrooms transformed into dungeons
Embers, shackles, paddles and electrodes
Turn your pairs in, wither and die

Immense flux of fodder to the beasts
Portraits of despaired inmates
Screams of pain that echo through the aeons
By the haunted corridors
