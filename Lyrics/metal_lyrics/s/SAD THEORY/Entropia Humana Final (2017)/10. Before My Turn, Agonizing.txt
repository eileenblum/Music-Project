[originally by Infernal]Free inside
Of a darkened room
Double side...
Free inside
Of an unforgettable mind

A burning star
King of death
The burning star
King of death
Give it to us
Kissing our heads

Who has been living here
Who has afraid of living...
They've learned how to breath despair
They will die to live there

Poor, epidemic civilization
The end is near
Continuous cycle of destruction
Becomes a thief
Of our own mass

Words in pieces
They'll be consumed
A collection of corpses
Pick up one of them
