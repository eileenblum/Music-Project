[Carlos / Juan]

I cannot see your eyes' color,
They are empty, who has stolen its brightness?
Your pale lips were so sweet over my mouth,
Where had your smile run to?
Weeps go warm when I touch your cold body,
I remember cheer days while holding you lifeless hand.
You have blinded me, I have illusions no longer!
Only a bitter feeling of sadness.

Doubtful sensations go through my flesh,
Confused, I let fear controlling my emotions.
I feel noir embracing me with its warming and lovely arm,
I belong to her as life belongs to light.
Touched, an angel heats me in his arms,
Pour over me all of his fault.
I am his pleasures' accomplice
Burgeon of your fester...
