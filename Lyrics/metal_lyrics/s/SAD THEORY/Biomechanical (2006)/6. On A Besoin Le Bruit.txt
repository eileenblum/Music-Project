[Based on Nietzsche's idea about music]

My spirit has always been lead by the sound.
The most subtle sounding harmony locked me up
And released myself in salt drops.
But, all of a sudden,
My senses ceased
I was sent to the weeping silence
Not even the summer breeze sounds in my flesh.

Remembrances...

The music lied on me
I hear it from the past,
Note by note, melody is a narrative.
Sewing a song
When images, smelling and touch break it.
All, but the sound, is heard by me now.

Paradox of necessity
Makes in me a mechanism of swalling from life
What is lucid.
The mouth image during the act of yelling,
The noiseless touch on the skin,
The taste of Sunday
Rape in me an unbreakable connotation of a thin drama,
Do major tragedy,
Sharp novels.

I am not unprotected!
