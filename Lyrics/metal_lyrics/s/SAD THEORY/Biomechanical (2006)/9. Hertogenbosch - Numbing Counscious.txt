[Based on the art of Bosch]

Numbing images swallow eyes of nonsense
Unbelievably stuck on break-through cells.
Chaotic structures of a perfect organization,
Dance, untying the whole, above perspective.

Passengers, take a seat to this new epoque
See the river going down, straight to upstairs,
See the existence invented by itself,
The already-made done into a crippled beauty.

Disbelief of tortuous epigenesis,
Profoundly surreal, engines the reality revisited
Taken life by some dizzying drops of paint:
Eccentric move of the ships of fool.

Grab the pleasure and put on the scenario,
Detach the weirdness from your low wall,
Celebrate the anxiety of the unique
And become the discoverer of the unconscious.
