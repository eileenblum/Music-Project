Decline the austere and static nondescript man.
Fragment them on pieces of illegible trails.
Embrace him the morsel counterpane:
The retail that throws you from the hard saddle.

It is never from the empty none
You stand for an ending relieve.
Breath the ingeniousness and hold the instinct,
For the whole is tangible into remounted parts.

Dance with a swaying encountered motion.
Sever the sheaves from the disgraced ones
Benumbing them on your own cloth.
Become, to that, essence of difference.

Where is the condition of being the very same?
I see the pallid sameness no longer.
Provide me the moment then I sparkle.
Swallow me the words then I sing.
Denote me the inalterated then I leave.
