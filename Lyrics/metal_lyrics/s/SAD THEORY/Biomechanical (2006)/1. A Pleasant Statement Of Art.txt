[Based on the film "Clockwork Orange"]

For I have never done the outrage
I've never seen the colour
I've never swallowed the song
This is just my pleasant statement of art!

Turn on the ode
Put on the hat
Take in the hand
End the white

The struggling part of me dwells in here
It awaits to go, it awaits to go
The spoilage done awakes my slight tranquility
It's always near by to harm them.

The melancholy sleeps aside the smell
Stab the ordinary see-through breath

Drink the liquor of this never-ending hours
Stains the human, be with the non-hearts.
I booze the cup of a terminating apathetic world

Dance, my friend, alone in water.
There is no time to dry the sweat, the sweat of all.
Behave the risk of becoming another,
Fake, a fake to the scene.

The melancholy sleeps aside the smell
Dry me the last succumbing drop.

Turn on the ode
Put on the hat
Take in the hand
End the white

Remorse? I feel it no longer
