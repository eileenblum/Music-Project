[Athos Maia / Claudio Rovel / Carlos Machado]

Pain poisons soul
Dissimulating effectiveness in shame
Hatred goes through my pride
Blinding my love and respect

Rancour burns drying tears on my face,
I am lost in unthankful and suffering memories
Remembrances I still have
Bring me only sadness and betrayal feelings.

I have despise raging my soul,
Leaving melancholy and tragedy.
All we said to each other was meaningless,
Only pale words made of empty promises.

Once again I'm alone
Once again happiness becomes loss.
I'm sick and tired of being the victim.
I do not want to be maculated by your fault
