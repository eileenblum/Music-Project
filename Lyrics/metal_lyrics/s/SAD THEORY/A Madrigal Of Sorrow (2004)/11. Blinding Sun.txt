[Carlos Machado / Leonardo Campoy]

Oh, love, I am under the colored sky
All my pride just fades away
It turns around and looks inside of me
Its vision goes far than places I can find

No one is there to heal me
A lament and its part
In a sense of suffering
The despair of figuring I am!

Existence goes on
Can't take this blinding sun

[Chorus:]
Keep my heart hollowed
With the brightening shadows

All this black makes me clever than ever
Although the loneliness isn't forgiveness

For the guilty that I stand
Intimacy: the way for the pain
Lighting the hate all over me
To burn without moving a string.
