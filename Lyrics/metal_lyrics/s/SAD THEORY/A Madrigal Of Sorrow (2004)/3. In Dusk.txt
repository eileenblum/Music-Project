[Lyrics: Carlos Machado / Athos Maia / OtÃ¡vio Lanner]
[Dedicated to AnnaBel Lee's Lover]

Falling for you...
My angry has gone
And dusk has come
Your wishes became my saddest theory

Why closing your eyes and going away?
I may never know.
But sure I am
That into this I feel.

Night tears embrace your cold and white body
Pale hours will never leave.

My being is drenched in dusk
While my soul feels its deepest loss
But let death holds me away.
I meet you once again.

My anger for its decision is quiet now
There is nothing I can do
But let death holds me away.
I meet you once again.
