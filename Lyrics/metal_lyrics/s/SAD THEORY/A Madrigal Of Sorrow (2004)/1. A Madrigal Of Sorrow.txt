[Based on Baudelaire's art]
[M: Carlos Machado / Juan Viacava. L: Carlos Machado]

Nothing is like the pain going with you...
Vanishing the breeze, licking the wind...

He asked you to be sad, to be beautiful.
Bring some tears along with the past,
I like you crying, and most when your wipe
Carries a loud, dense and tortured love.

Oh, dear ( my queen ), madrigal of sorrow
Share me all your sins and bring them down

We both know your darkened heart
Only sings verses of a lonely and damned poet,
Verses of laments, spleen, beauty in rudeness
Verses received from flowers, Fleurs du Mal.
