[Carlos Machado]

Her absence made me see
All the weakness I carry inside.
It gave me a bitter taste
Of what is continue with the tide...
Words are said,
Thoughts are spelled
Forward the noble end.
The purity of seeing no one there

Is the tranquility I found to be.
Nobody is around me, just a
Noir and sweet sensation of relieve.

"But why should I for others groan
When none will sigh for me?" [Childe Harold]
That is because you lay what I am on you.
