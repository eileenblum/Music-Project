[Carlos Machado / OtÃ¡vio Lanner]

Through her eyes
I could see her deepest thoughts on me
Her dreams and whishes
Seem so close
Like the ones I've got, too.

[Chorus:]
Why is she hassling me?
What isn't right between us?
Is it me or is it her?
I guess it's too soon to say

Everything started
Sometime ago
When we went out just to smoke
We started to talk
About things
Maybe we knew each other before

[Chorus:]
And then when everything
Seemed to take away
Came out the problems

And we started to talk
Less and less
Until none.

Until none we talked away
Less and less gathered the sand
