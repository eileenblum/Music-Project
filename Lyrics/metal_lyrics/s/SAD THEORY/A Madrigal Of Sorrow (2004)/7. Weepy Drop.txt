[Athos Maia / Carlos Machado]

Ask yourself,
What is the taste of an injured heart's weepy drop?
What fear corrupts the soul?
And caresses senses?

Brighter than your lip's blood
Is the veil that covers my lucidity.
Illusions you desire
Do not hide the crossed foolishness in your eyes.

Loneliness heals all sorrows,
Chromium Poison comforts disgrace.
It knows not to be charming nor wicked
Only unveils cruelty in love.

I look emptiness around me,
Lights are cold, and have no one to console me.
I put myself into a lifeless garden, no flowers, no autumn.

I listen to emptiness, fell the garden.

Pale and serene, I suffer your absence.
I get lost into memories of gone days.
The longing stagnated in poems...
Like bitter remembrances danced under the moon.

I look emptiness around me,
Lights are cold, and have no one to console me.
I put myself into a lifeless garden, no flowers, no autumn.
