[Athos Maia / Carlos Machado]

Your eyes spy the pale night
Uncommon shapes dance, naked, under the moonlight
Your perfume's smell numbs senses,
Opening scarves of a lost heart.

Desire, anger and disillusion...
What is the meaning of innocence?

Sometimes sincerity is our great weakness,
An infidel loneliness companion.

An hostile weeping suppresses the flaming sky,
Whisper, innocently, love and greed words.
Empty thoughts unveil you desires,
Confess the fear pain announces.

The last candle slightly agonizes, gentle and serene,
Exhaling a sweet orchid aroma.
Moving the sadness that burns in your breast away,
Letting alive remembrances traces behind...
