Make me alive
Make me dead
Do what you will
To my head

Take me over
Let me fall
Don't leave a trace
Take it all

Show me the way to hate like you
This will be my fate

Yeah turn me in
Crack my heart
Break my bones
Yeah push me down
Bust me up
Break my bones

Take the wheel
Drive me out
Till I'm a shadow
Of my own doubt

Sun never shined upon your face
So I deserve to die

Yeah turn me in
Crack my heart
Break my bones
Yeah push me down
Bust me up
Break my bones
