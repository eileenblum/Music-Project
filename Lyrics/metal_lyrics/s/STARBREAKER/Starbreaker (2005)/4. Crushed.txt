Hard to breathe, sinking deep
No more sleep without you
Empty soul, blood is cold
Here alone broke in two

I'm sick of love I'm sick of pain
But it's nothing I won't do again

I'm crushed, now I am torn
I'm overwhelmed, I am unborn
I'm lost, trying to get found
I am in pieces, crushed to the ground

Flash of sun, through this room
Blinds my eyes too soon
Wake up light, darkness fights
Endless thoughts of my doom

I'm sick of me I can't resist
But I would give my life for this

I'm crushed, now I am torn
I'm overwhelmed, I am unborn
I'm lost, trying to get found
I am in pieces, crushed to the ground

I'm crushed, now I am torn
I'm overwhelmed, I am unborn
I'm lost, trying to get found
I am in pieces, crushed to the ground
