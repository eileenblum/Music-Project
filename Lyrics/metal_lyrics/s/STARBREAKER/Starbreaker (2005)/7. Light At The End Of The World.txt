We are photographs in bodies-we are ghosts
And the flesh we wear is nothing but a hoax
So the deeper we dive the further we can swim
To the end of this line, and for infinity we'll shine

The light at the end of the world
Deny them the end of the world

We're the atmosphere, the fire and the earth
We are everything for all that it's worth
So the bigger we are the higher we can reach
Till the end of our time, and for infinity we'll shine

The light at the end of the world
Deny them the end of the world

Born as soldiers we must fight for what we know
To the end of this line and for infinity - oh we'll shine

The light at the end of the world
Deny them the end of the world
The light at the end of the world
We'll deny them the end of the world
