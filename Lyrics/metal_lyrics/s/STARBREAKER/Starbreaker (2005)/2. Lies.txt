Sorry, for all that we have done
For what we have become in our fear
Godless, though they claim to be
Blessed in their quest for security

Not so different me from you
They try to tell us it's not true
Justify the madness make us hate each other

Lies! On the TV screen
In the Magazines
Everything
Lies! On the radio
Everywhere we go
Don't you know?
Lies

Help me find a better way
We can be OK if we are one
Please try to look outside your world
And I will look out side of mine for you

Nothing's clear in black and white
Color is what makes it right
Can't you see they're taking all our dreams away with...

Lies! On the TV screen
In the Magazines
Everything
Lies! On the radio
Everywhere we go
Don't you know?
Lies!

Help me find a better way
We can be OK if we are one

Lies! On the TV screen
In the Magazines
Everything
Lies! On the radio
Everywhere we go
Don't you know?
Lies
