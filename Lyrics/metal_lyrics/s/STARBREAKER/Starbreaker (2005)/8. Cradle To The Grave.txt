Left me here alone
To carry all your weight
I can feel you standing on my brain
Long as I'm alive
The sky won't have to fall
I will laugh before I hit the wall

I was born to fight
From the cradle to the grave
I won't let your shadow be my shade
I won't be a victim or a slave

Dropped upon this world
Guess I needed to
Did you choose me or did I choose you?

And I'll take this ride
From the cradle to the grave
I won't let your shadow be my shade
I won't be a victim or a slave
Everything I am is what I've made
You don't have to worry bout me

If I can understand you, understand who I am
Open the door and let you in again, let you in

Yeah I was born to fight
And I will take this ride
From the cradle to the grave
I won't let your shadow be my shade
I won't be a victim or a slave
Everything I am is what I've made
You don't have to worry bout it
I won't let your shadow be my shade
I'll fight from the cradle to the grave
