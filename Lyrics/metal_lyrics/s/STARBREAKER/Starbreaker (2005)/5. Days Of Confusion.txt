The moment I believed in something
I saw my space open wide
To far too see, too soon to go there
But I could dream

Crossing over the shadows
And through my days of confusion,
I'm free - I am free - Yeah!

No looking back, no yesterdays, I'm
Right where I am
And so I know, what I know and
It's all I need

Riding straight to the mountain
and through my days fo confusion
I'm free - I am free -Oh yeah!

Now I can dream

Crossing over the shadows and through my days of confusion
I'm riding straight to the mountain cause now I am my illusion
I'm flying out on the highway I'm feeling all that I am and I'm free, I am free
