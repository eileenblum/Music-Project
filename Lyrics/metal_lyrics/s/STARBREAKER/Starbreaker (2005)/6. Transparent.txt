Underneath your words another voice speaks openly while you go on and
Give it all away

An overcoat of white that hides the blackness that is really what you are
Behind the mask that you display

Now it's over

You'd like to think that you're a god to all of us, but you're falling, falling
So transparent, and it took me this long to see you're nothing, nothing

Cowardly affair-this game you play with souls that trust that way you do and
Say is really true

We spin around the sun that feeds the dreams that come undone by fear and
Innocence is lost before it blooms

But it's over

In all your glory, you're exposed for what you are and you're falling, falling
So transparent, in my ever-waking world, and you're nothing, nothing

Can't you see the fog is lifting, in the light the world is shifting out of
What you tried to make it, into what you fear

You'd like to think that you're a god to all of us, but you're falling, falling
So transparent, and it took me this long to see you're nothing, nothing
