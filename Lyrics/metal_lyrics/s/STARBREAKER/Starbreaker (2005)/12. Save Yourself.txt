You won't feel a thing just turn off your mind and follow
And after it comes you'll just be hypnotized and hollow

If you behave they might let you out someday

In the end you've got to save yourself, save yourself
When they come you better save yourself again

You say you're afraid and there's nothing that can stop the pain
Well they've got a cure and it might just help you go insane

You don't have to deal with a world that's so very real

In the end you've got to save yourself, save yourself
When they come you better save yourself again
All they want to do is kill your soul, kill your soul
So when they come you better save yourself again, my friend

If you behave they might let you out someday
You don't have to deal with a world that's so very real

In the end you've got to save yourself, save yourself
When they come you better save yourself again
All they want to do is kill your soul, kill your soul
So when they come you better save yourself again, my friend
