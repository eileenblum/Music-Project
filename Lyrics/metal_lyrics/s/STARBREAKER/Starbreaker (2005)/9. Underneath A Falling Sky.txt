Disappearing through the doorway
One last time
A drop of light across the room
Wouldn't vanish with the memory
Of that day
Couldn't seem to let it go

It still holds onto me

Underneath a falling sky we surrender
No one wants to say goodbye

Time to close the space that keep us
Far away
Let the words fall from your lips
Years of dragging it around
Like a suitcase
Don't you want to let it go?

It still holds onto you

Underneath a falling sky we surrender
No one wants to say goodbye
And when the days come undone, it all comes back again
That we really are just one

Ooooh yeah, we are one, we are one in the end we are one

Underneath a falling sky we surrender
No one wants to say goodbye
And when the days come undone, it all comes back again
