What you think you are
What you think you know
What you want it all to be
What if something changed?
Everything was strange
In a new reality

And that giant wall was not so tall
And the enemy was you

Turn off your head
Turn it off now
Wake up your self
Don't let it in
Turn it off now
Break from your shell

What they're looking for
What they're running from
What they really want to do
What if it was here?
Everything was clear
Waiting in a different view

And that stupid pain was all in vain
There was really nothing wrong

Turn off your head
Turn it off now
Wake up your self
Don't let it in
Turn it off now
Break from your shell

You are what you think
You are not what they think you are

Turn off your head
Turn it off now
Wake up your self
Don't let it in
Turn it off now
Break from your shell
