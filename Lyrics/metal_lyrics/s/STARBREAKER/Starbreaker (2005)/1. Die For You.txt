You don't have to be an ass kisser
You don't have to say a thing
I don't need your damn approval
I just want to hear you scream

You don't have to love me long time
Never said you had to stay
Gotta feel what ya feel
In your own kinda way

Giving all I can to you
Even when I'm down, I'm always coming through
Feel it in my voice tonight, everything is real and I would die for you

You can follow me to heaven
We can blow it all to hell
We can push it to the edge
Till we know each other well

I don't need to feel ashamed now
I'm just doing what I know
If you like it come on over
If you love it steal the show

Giving all I can to you
Even when I'm down, I'm always coming through
Feel it in my voice tonight, everything is real and I would die for you

I would follow you to heaven
Let you take me down to hell
Can we push it to the edge
Till we know each other well
I don't need to feel ashamed now
I'm just doing what I know
If you like it come on over
If you love it steal the show

Giving all I can to you
Even when I'm down, I'm always coming through
Feel it in my voice tonight, everything is real and I would die for you
Giving all I can to you
Even when I'm down, I'm always coming through
Feel it in my voice tonight, everything is real and I would die for you
