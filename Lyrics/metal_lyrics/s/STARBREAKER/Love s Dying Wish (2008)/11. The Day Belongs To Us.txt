Never wake up, wake up
The only ones not dreaming are the dead...

Louder than love it screams through the airwaves and bleaches a dirty lie
Softer than butterfly kisses it whispers in code
Killing any thoughts you might have of believing in yourself
Fight for your life, keep your head in the clouds, we need you to feed us, we need you

Never wake up, (don't ever) wake up
The only ones not dreaming are the dead
They won't save us (no they won't) and which god should we trust?
In the fading light the day belongs to us

Nothing I hear but the music in my head, when you sing I can breathe
Takes me above it I love how it feels to be free from the sadness, the madness

Never wake up (don't ever) wake up
The only ones not dreaming are the dead
They won't save us (no they won't) and which god should we trust?
In the fading light the day belongs to us

We need you to feed us, we need you...

Never wake up, (don't ever) wake up
The only ones not dreaming are the dead
They won't save us (no they won't) and which god should we trust?
In the fading light the day belongs to us
