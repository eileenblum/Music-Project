Took a lot of hard knocks, big rocks hit him in the head when he was young
He was all he ever had; it wasn't bad in the sun
In and out of love again another friend lost when his roots were torn away
So he took a breath and never looked back again

Shining like an unknown superstar
Getting what he wants when he wants it, living large
Keeps a little sunshine in his heart, yeah yeah yeah
(He's come a long way)
Never made it out to Hollywood
Getting what he wants when he wants it, got it good
Just another unknown superstar, yeah

Now he's got a big life, appetite, love is all around him where he goes
Giving more than he can take he's not a fake and it shows
Running with a tough crowd, strong and loud, gonna change the world if he can
You don't know his name, not in it for fame, oh no

Shining like an unknown superstar
Getting what he wants when he wants it, living large
Keeps a little sunshine in his heart, yeah yeah yeah
(He's come a long way)
Never made it out to Hollywood
Getting what he wants when he wants it, got it good
Just another unknown superstar, yeah

Shining like an unknown superstar
Getting what he wants when he wants it, living large
Keeps a little sunshine in his heart, yeah yeah yeah
(He's come a long way)
Never made it out to Hollywood
Getting what he wants when he wants it, got it good
Just another unknown superstar, yeah
