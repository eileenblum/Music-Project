I've seen the sun rise at 3am
Temples bathed in neon light
Ever lost I let myself become
Going through the motions numb

I was afraid of letting go
Something inside would let me know
This was the worst that I could be
And every moment changes me

I've heard voices from another life
Trying somehow to get through
I was waiting for a revelation
To bring me back from where I'd gone

I was afraid of letting go
Something inside would let me know
That every moment changes me
This was the worst that I could be

Better days ahead and I'm getting out of bed alive
Nothing to regret, in time I'll be exactly who I am

I'm not afraid of letting go
Something they said had kept me low
That was the worst that I could be
'Cause every moment changes me
