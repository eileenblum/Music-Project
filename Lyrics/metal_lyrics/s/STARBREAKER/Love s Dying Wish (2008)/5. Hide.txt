We always fly alone
We don't remember what we've known
Pictures of moments flashing through the noise
Try but it's hard to see
All the good things underneath
Too many voices talking us to sleep

Maybe we hide as someone else
Till we decide to be ourselves
But we're lost if we believe that things can never change

After the scars are gone
Will you still be hanging on?
Driving the anger deep inside your bones

Maybe we hide as someone else
Till we decide to be ourselves
But we're lost if we believe that things can never change
Everyone sees through everyone
With x-ray eyes and radar guns
We shoot each other down into oblivion

Lay me down ah lay me out
Shine some faith upon me now
Turn me all the way around

Maybe we hide as someone else
Till we decide to be ourselves
But we're lost if we believe that things can never change
Everyone sees through everyone
With x-ray eyes and radar guns
Yeah, we shoot each other down into oblivion
Maybe we hide as someone else
Till we decide to be ourselves
Yeah, we're lost if we believe that things

We always fly alone
We don't remember what we've known
Pictures of moments flashing through the noise
