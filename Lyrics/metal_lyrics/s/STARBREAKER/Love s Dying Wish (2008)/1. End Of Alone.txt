Raise your eyes, find my face
Move the light above your grace
Bring yourself into view, let me drink you in
Lay your wings over me
I could die beautifully
With you here I'm more alive than I have ever been

Thought all the life in me was gone
In a place I'd never known
Could this be the end of alone?

Insulate you from pain
Make your sky never rain
Anything to see you dancing somewhere in the moon
Spread my love over you
Am I getting closer to
Making you feel more alive than you have ever been?

Thought all the life in me was gone
In a world I'd never known
Could this be the end of alone?
How can a soul just carry on?
Without a heart there is no home
Could this be the end of alone?

You're a long endless night
Block the day from my sight
Fill me up once again with the thing I need

Thought all the life in me was gone
In a world I'd never known
Could this be the end of alone?
How can a soul just carry on?
Without a heart there is no home
Could this be the end of alone?
