I can be the road underneath your wheels
I can be the one you lie to
I can be the wind you've been blowing in
I can be the room you walk through

I'm the mirror in your eyes; a tear that never cries, floods you inside

Drown me in the rain when nothing feels good
I will make it all evaporate

I can be the high when you're getting off
I can be the low you fall to
I can be a sign if you think you're lost
I can be the ghost that haunts you

Yeah, open up and bleed, whatever you need, spit it out and...

Drown me in the rain when nothing feels good
I will make it all evaporate
Take it out on me, there's nothing you could
Do to make my love evaporate

Yeah, swimming in your head leaves you feeling dead; scream it out and...

Drown me in the rain when nothing feels good
I will make it all evaporate
Take it out on me, I know that you could
Never make my love evaporate
