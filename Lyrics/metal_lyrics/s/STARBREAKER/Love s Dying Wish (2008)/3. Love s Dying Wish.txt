When there's no way out you become the one you are
Endless nights of sun that don't relieve the dark
And all I remember... the words that she said

In the laughter, find the answer
... Escape the abyss
Resurrect me, don't forget me
... Love's dying wish

The emptiness that comes when you know it's time to see
In all its glory, oh how the truth enlightens as it bleeds
The one thing we'd kill for has died in our arms

In the laughter, find the answer
... Escape the abyss
Resurrect me, don't forget me
... Love's dying wish

In a dream thought I heard love's dying wish
In a low velvet whisper she let go

In the laughter, find the answer
... Escape the abyss
Resurrect me, don't forget me
... Love's dying wish
