Don't listen to a word they say
Remember who you are
Push the rest away
There's nothing real about this place
Can't you understand that it's killing you?

One beautiful disaster
Slave to a shallow master
None of it will hold you after all
If I could reach inside you
Rip out the poison; hide you
For a hundred days until you find your way

Try for a moment to be still
If you indulge the noise
It'll make you ill
We're all addicted to the dream
You've been living in
It's not worth dying for

One beautiful disaster
Slave to a shallow master
None of it will hold you after all
If I could reach inside you
Rip out the poison; hide you
For a hundred days until you find your way

Don't listen to a word they say
Remember who you are...

One beautiful disaster
Slave to a shallow master
None of it will hold you after all
If I could reach inside you
Rip out the poison; hide you
For a hundred days until you find your way
