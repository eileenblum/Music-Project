Vaporize me, don't describe me
Throw my name from your mind if you can
No I'm not snowy white but you know what they say
If your house is made of glass then keep your stones away

Live your life
Find forgiveness
You need only yourself as a witness
Drop your knife
Live your life

Wash your hands in your own water
Don't use me to cover what you've done
Stare down your own reflection, might just do you well
I guess my name ignites the fame you need to sell

Live your life
Find forgiveness
You need only yourself as a witness
Drop your knife
Live your life

I saw the painting on the wall you left hanging out for me
I saw the vision in your mind that I know you really try to be
And through the haze, the empty days fed the coward's desperate rage
Got what he wanted, ate from his hand, and followed blindly into his plan

Live your life
Find forgiveness
You need only yourself as a witness
Drop your knife
(Oh...) Live your life
Find forgiveness
You need only yourself as a witness
Drop your knife
Live your life
