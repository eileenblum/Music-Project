Hello, are you listening, I was wondering if I could
Just have some of your attention for a moment, if I could?

You are me, I am you, on the edge, out of tune

Come on, come on
Look around
World's gone crazy
Feel the ground

Hello, do you hear me now on the telephone in my car?
I'd love to be talking right next to you, to be touching you under stars

Come on, come on
Look around
Stop and listen
To the sound
Come on, come on
I need you
Love is all we need to do

What is here when here is there and all we are is nowhere?

Come on, come on
Turn around
World's gone crazy
Feel the ground
Come on, come on
I need you
Love is all we need to do
