Come all you faithful, spread out your light
Into where nothing is right
Come all you marchers, put on your boots
Make it a future that we choose

When they say that it's going down
I believe them
Cause it all feels so different now
Don't you think?
We believe that we'll always be safe here but oh, we've never been this close

Voyeurs entranced in reality's glare
Turnstile fame till everyone's there
Novocain sunshine burning a hole
Down into sanity's soul

And when they say that it's going down
I believe them
Cause it all feels so different now
Don't you think?
We believe that we'll always be safe here but oh, we've never been this close

There's got to be a thousand more ways from Sunday
That we could make it out of here with our lives
Like maybe just listen to the other side
The only thing to make is love, love

And when they say that it's going down
I believe them
Cause it all feels so different now
Don't you think?
We believe that we'll always be safe here but oh, we've never been this close
