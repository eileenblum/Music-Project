All the lonely faces on the train
In a far away regret or pain
City worn they're twisted inside out
Longing for the love they do without, they do without

Well maybe I'm projecting
What I wish I could deny
Slowly disconnecting
Building up a wall to ease my mind
Ease my mind (building up a wall), ease my mind, but it won't let me be
My mind, It's a crime, I can't be blind, there's no hiding place left for me

All the shadows walking through the door
Every day is like the day before
Disappear with every compromise
Like a shell that sees through empty eyes, through empty eyes

Defeated I'm confessing
To my love I've been unkind
God is out of blessings
Building up a wall to ease my mind
Ease my mind (building up a wall), ease my mind, but it won't let me be
My mind, It's a crime, I can't be blind, there's no hiding place left for me

(Building up a wall)

Ease my mind, ease my mind
Cause it won't let me be
