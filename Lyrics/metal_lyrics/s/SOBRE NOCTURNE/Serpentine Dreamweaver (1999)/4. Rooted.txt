[music and lyrics: S. Lundgren]

Rooted into earth through
Love in hate we need
Rooted like a tree into earth
through hate in life we need

Shadowed feelings hides us
Along false glory
Justice as law,
break the order
Select your queen
(take the crown)
Select the leaf and let it fall
Into mud and dirt
Leave your child among the
dead bury it among your pain

Rooted into earth
through love
Love in hate we breed
Rooted like a tree
into earth through hate
On hate in life we feed

Leave your descendant
be your foe

Below your feet,
Lies something
you should defeat
Pain is your true friend,
pain makes you surface again

From mud alive,
it pushes you aside
Accept it as your true friend,
and to the very bottom descend
Rooted into earth through
Love in hate we need
Rooted like a tree into earth
through hate in life we need

Shadowed feelings hides us
Along false glory
Justice as law,
break the order
Select your queen
(take the crown)
Select the leaf and let it fall
Into mud and dirt
Leave your child among the
dead bury it among your pain
