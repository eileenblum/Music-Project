In the depth of dark abysses
Lies the ancient in wait
Under the water of history
In the twilight of mankind
Watch the sun of darkness
Rise above the border
of our destiny
When the seven kings
Once again will rule
the surface of earth

Somewhere under the surface water.
Rest's the realm of ancient might.
In the ruins of the temple.
Burn the torch of Promethean light

The fall and rise of Atlantis
Are seen in the horizon of the sea
Listen to the shadow-choir
And the celebration symphony

Hymn to the lost continent
An Atlantean ode
Over the seven kings
And their sunken abode

Before the great sea
Stand on the shore
And watch the rise
Of the land of before

The old serpent of the depth
Rise from the paradise lost
To coil through landscapes
Which no man
yet have crossed

The seven kings of Atlantis
Return from their
long Odyssey
To restore the lost continent Out
of the ocean of memory

Hymn to the lost continent
An Atlantean ode
Over the seven kings
And their sunken abode

Before the great sea
Stand on the shore
And watch the rise
Of the land of before
