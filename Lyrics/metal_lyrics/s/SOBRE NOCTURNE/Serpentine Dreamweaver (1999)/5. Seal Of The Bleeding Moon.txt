[music: S. Lundgren, lyrics: T. Karlsson]

The bell tolls twelve times
And I hear a crack in the sky
With the eyes of an augur
I see the black raven fly

The seal is breaking
And the birds are crying
When earth is shaking
And the moon is dying

The stars are falling
Cause the end is coming
The moon is bleeding
For the sign of longing

The shadow of the universe
Make my sight turn black
The reaping time has come
And the reaper is back

Never before has the stars
Shone so bright
And been so very near
As when earth ignite

The seal is breaking
And the birds are crying
When earth is shaking
And the moon is dying

The stars are falling
Cause the end is coming
The moon is bleeding
For the sign of longing

The sun becomes black
And the heart is ice
The lovers turn to stone
When the black raven cries
