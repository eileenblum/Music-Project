I take chances thinking of death
I really just wish for it
if it came today id kneel down and ask
would you take my sooul
away?

Take it away, would you takr my soul?
Take it away...

it comes down to this simple fact
life's not worth living when it seems like the end
it seems like the end every day
it seems like the end and i don't want to pray
for forgiveness or for strength
just gonna end this miserable life
it comes down to this simple fact
life's not worth living when it seems like the end

this suicide inside
this suicide
this suicide inside
this suicide
suicide inside
this suicide
this suicide inside
this
suicide

your intervening it made me beleive
that i'm alive i'm not better off dead
i'll take my chances
i'm gonna live
and turn the gun on you instead
