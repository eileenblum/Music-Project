the knife will cut into your flesh soon to be ripped
htrough
your screams fall on deaf ears, the pain surmounting
it now engulfs you, the terror it builds too the fear
of your own death,
a putrid dismemberment
pools of blood drip from your carcass
open wounds cleaned with your piss

in feces i drown you choke on the filth of you
your skin is smeared with shit the knife cuts into it
your screams fall on deaf ears, the pain surmounting
the fear of your own death, a putrid dismemberment
pools of blood drip from your carcass
open wounds cleaned with your piss

see the knife
cut your flesh
still alive
but decapitated

headless stump
buried deep
severed legs and arms
and pulled out teeth

fingers cut off
and toes too
left in water electrocute
from eye sockets blood does shoot
gangrene is fed to you

The nightmares have come true, a violent death is upon
you
the pigs will never find you
ill scatter the pieces of you
flesh and skin is removed
everybone, every bone in your body is smashed.
