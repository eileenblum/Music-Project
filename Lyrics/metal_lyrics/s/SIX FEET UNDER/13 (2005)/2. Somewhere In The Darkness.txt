somewhere in the darkness, another dies
somewhere in the darkness, a child cries
somewhere in the darkness, you scream in vain
somewhere in the darkness, it awaits
somewhere in the darkness, an empty grave
somewhere in the darkness, evil
somewhere in the darkness, the winds have changed
somewhere in the darkmess, the dead awake

from the grave
a spirits curse
the demonseed
is now unearthed

somewhere in the darkness, is the afterlife
somewhere in the darkness, someone holds a knife
somewhere in the darkness, the devil
somewhere in the darkness, evil

from the grave
a spirits curse
the demonseed
is now unearthed

somewhere in the darkness, another dies
somewhere in the darkness, a child cries
somewhere in the darkness, you scream in vain
somewhere in the darkness, it awaits
somewhere in the darkness, an empty grave
somewhere in the darkness, evil
somewhere in the darkness, the winds have changed
somewhere in the darkmess, the dead awake

from the grave
a spirits curse
the demonseed
is now unearthed

the demonseed is now unearthed
