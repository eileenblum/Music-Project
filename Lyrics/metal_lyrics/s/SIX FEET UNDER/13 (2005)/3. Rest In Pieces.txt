the hearse awaits to drive you to hell
the coffin opens, you're dead on the table
i prepare the pieces for burial
brain removed as i stick in the needle
to drain out the pus, blood, and bile
one eyeball missing, 6 teeth and four limbs
rope was used as the method to strangle
rats have eaten part of the genitals

oh my god not another dead body
the cadaver is cut up and cut up again
gutted and split up in two
to ferment in the grave
thrown six feet down one piece at a time
for the insects to find

rest in pieces
in the grave you're bleeding
rest in pieces
in the tomb of the mutilated

the hearse awaits to drive you to hell
the coffin opens you're dead on the table
i prepare the pieces for burial
brain removed as i stick in the needle
the bloody bodies have been probed and cut
a severed head hangs on a hook
cockroaches and ants invade the torso
everything below the waist has been cooked

res in pieces
in the grave you're bleeding
rest in pieces
in the tomb of the mutilated
