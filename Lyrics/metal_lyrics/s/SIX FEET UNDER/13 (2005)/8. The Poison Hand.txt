deadly to you
you'll just fade away
nothing left in your head

this is the touch of death

deadly to you
you'll just fade away
nothing left in your head

this is the touch of death

you're just fadin' away
to the grave
theres's no savin' you now

deadly to you
you'll just fade away
nothing left in your head

this is the touch of death
