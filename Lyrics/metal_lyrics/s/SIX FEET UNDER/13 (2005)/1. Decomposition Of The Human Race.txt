the hopeless, the terrified
you're petrified, its time to die
i vomit in the face of the faithful
the mislead, the ignorant
the ones who are truly dangerous

decomposition of the human race
a warning from beyond the grave
out of the ashes
and into the fucking flames

the souless, the unworthy
the undead
now walk the walk the earth in pain
to devour
to massacre you
to overtake this world
the mislead
the ignorant
the ones who are truly dangerous
its time to die

decomposition of the human race
a warning from beyond the grave
out of the ashes
and into the fucking flames

the image of men betrays that which distinguishes him
from other animals
his ability to observe himself
the decay of modern society, leads to doom
turn back the clock
retreat
into the essance of life
but its too late for you now
its too late for you now

decomposition of the human race
a warning from beyond the grave
out of the ashes
and into the fucking flames
varicose the heart is now closed
eyes still open, but soon you'll decompose
and its a bottomless pit.
