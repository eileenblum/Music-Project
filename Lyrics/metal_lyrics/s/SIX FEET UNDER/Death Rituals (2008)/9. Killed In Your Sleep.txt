Aspirated
Choked to death
Vomit now filling
Esophagus

Killed in your sleep
Murdered in your dreams
Nightmares are now real
Never to wake up again

Gasping for air
Lungs are now collapsing
Suffocating on
Putrefied excrement

Killed in your sleep
Murdered in your dreams
Nightmares are now real
Never to wake up again

Struggling to open your eyes

Death is a gateway
In dreams now you enter
Reality twisted
Incredible pleasure
Time is suspended
Into the void
Into the darkness
You suffer forever

Killed in your sleep
Death awaits you tonight
Killed in your sleep
Don't close your eyes
Death awaits
