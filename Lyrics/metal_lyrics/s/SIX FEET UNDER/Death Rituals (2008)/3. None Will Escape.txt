None will escape
You will be killed
And dissected
Internal organs putrefy
Upheaval of your life and everyday routine
Disturbed and torn to pieces
Psychotic, unforgiving dark energy devours
I am your fucking savior
Hunted down for the slaughter
We have become a shell of what we were
A shadow of a daydream
A bloated hog to kill
So I take my vengeance
And you all will pay
Debt for all your hate

None will escape

The beast of beasts
The evil within us all
Let go of the teachings of the lying faith
Controller of souls
The darkness awaits us all
Blood of the child
Screams of the virgin mother
