Dead flesh' re-animates

Bodies dead and mangled
Rotted flesh awakens
The coffins are now open
To spit free precious cargo

The heart starts to pump
Alive, but once dead
Dead flesh' re-animates
Necrotic arteries
Pus flows through my veins
As living victims die

An unburied body begins to convulse
The heart pumping blood, but without any pulse
The sky turned to black in the middle of day
A corpse of a mother, and father, now hunt
A dead child is seen, chewing a foot

Involuntary movement of dead flesh

The heart starts to pump
Alive, but once dead
Dead flesh' re-animates
Necrotic arteries
Pus flows through my veins
As living victims die

Dead flesh re-animates
