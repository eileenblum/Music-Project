You're dying slow
Suffering through
The torture and hideous abuse
The return to the grave is imminent and welcomed
You're dying slow

Can't take this
Not anymore
Against the wall
Guns pointed
Point blank range
Blindfolded
The thunder
The power
To never
Be whole again
My swan song
My departure
To another
Realm of madness
Of nightmares

Ten deadly plagues

Of humanity when will learn!
The sheep-like masses
Led to a slaughter
To kill the herd
That follow blindly

Can't take this
Not anymore
On the gallows now
With neck in noose
Hands cuffed at wrist
Legs tied tight
Floor drops below
The power
To never
Be whole again
My swan song
My departure
To another
Realm of madness
Six feet under

Ten deadly plagues

You're dying slow
Suffering through
The torture and hideous abuse
The return to the grave is imminent and welcomed
You're dying slow
