A shotgun blast to the fucking face
A broken skull from the high impact
Blunt force murder from the hated within
Each night I kill a new victim

Grey matter exits gaping wounds
In your head a gush of blood runs from you
As the fine red mist clears and falls like rain
To kill again and again
Shot in the head

A.22 to the back of the neck
13 shots to the cranium
Implosion of blood and brain and bone
Pull the trigger and watch the head explode
Explode!

Grey matter exits gaping wounds
In your head a gush of blood runs from you
As the fine red mist clears and falls like rain
To kill again and again
Shot in the head

A.22 to the back of the neck
A shotgun blast to the fucking face
A broken skull from the high impact
I plot to kill everyone on the planet
To kill again and again
To kill again and again
