Temptation to murder
My homicidal rampage begins
Psychosis sets in
The dead speak my name in dreams
I'm alive to kill at will
And I will devour souls
To rupture living flesh
To incinerate a human life
I hunt tonight

The broken, the dying, I release from misery
The hand of solace
A glance at peace unknown
So begins the slaughter
So starts a killing frenzy
Like a wild animal
Feeding on its prey

The demon within
Butchered people
Hacked off arms and legs, drained of pus
They turn cold and stiff and blue
A final breathe as your eyes roll back

Left to die

Addicted to murdering, and never plan to stopping
Addicted to murdering, a violent way of living

Temptation to murder
My homicidal rampage continues
Psychosis embraced
The dead speak my name in dreams
I'm alive to kill at will
And I will devour souls
To rupture living flesh
To incinerate a human life
I hunt tonight
