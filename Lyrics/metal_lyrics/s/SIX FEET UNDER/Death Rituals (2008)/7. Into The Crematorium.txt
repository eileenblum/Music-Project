Stick the needle in
Withdraw of blood begins
Injecting noxious liquid
Into the body of a victim
Lying on the table
A scalpel by my side
Slicing through intestine
Just to eat its contents

A sickening way of life

That has brought me pleasure
Dominating human beings
Experimenting on their bodies
Carving out their vital organs
Cutting off their faces
Burrowing through their tissues
Fucking them after death
I want to be inside you

A sickening way of life

Splitting human bone
The heart and lungs now removed
Cold and decomposing
Blood now black and clotting
The coroner controls and rapes you
Dead on the fucking table
And pieces scattered, once whole
Begin to dissolve and mold

The blood has been drained, the body disposed
into the crematorium
Reduced to your bones and crushed into dust
Flames burning through life and releasing
A spirit of evil will rise and remain
Indebted to me now forever enslaved
