Death by machete, torso chopped in half
Fucking brutal death, human dismemberment
I am here to kill, sever, hack, and chop
I want to hear you scream, I want to see your blood
A woman or a child, cut to pieces, mutilated

Death by machete, cut by the blade
A vicious attack to murder and maim
The blood and the innards soon will decay
A number of fingers and toes cut away
Chopping through arms, hacking through flesh
A dead body twitching, missing a head
A pile of bones, skin still attached
Half of a skull brutally smashed

The cause of all the pain
The cause of all the suffering
Mangled by the blade
Sacrifice to my rage
Another person slain
One more unmarked grave

I want to hear you scream, I want to see your blood
A woman or a child, cut to pieces, mutilated
Death by machete, torso chopped in half
Fucking brutal death, human dismemberment
I am here to kill, sever, hack, and chop
I want to hear you scream, I want to see your blood

Death by machete
