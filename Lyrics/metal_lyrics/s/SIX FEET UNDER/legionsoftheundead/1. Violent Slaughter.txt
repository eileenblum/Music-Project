You will die

Desecrated souls
Unwilling death
Helpless prey
Satan laughs
Demons of death
Hell is their home
They come out at night
Screaming alone

Brought on this world
Filled with hate
You will die it's too late
The chant of Gregorian
The dead will arise
Slaughtered in violence
You're eaten alive

Killing
Slaughtered
Carnal
Violence
Deadly
Killer
Mystical
Wonder

Killing for free
Stopping the plea
Leaving the dead
Bloody red
Killing for free
Stopping the plea
Leaving the dead

Lost in the powers of evil darkness
Trusted each move that we've made
Feeding on blood that brought us about
And we must never forsake
In the powers that moved us ahead
Brought on our lust for evil
Slaughtered in violence and lost with the dead
Never to stop us again
Clinging to that of which we have lost
Trapped in the cryptic sites
Feeding on blood that brought us about
And we must kill at night

Blood flows deep
Slaughtered by lust
The final call
To break the crust, up from the grave
We'll take your life
You will be lost, under the cross
Into this world you can't kill us all
There's too many
Now you must fall
Zombies have take the world that you know
Undead corpse devours you

Killing for free
Stopping the plea
Leaving the dead
Bloody red
Killing for free
Stopping the plea
Leaving the dead

Lost in the powers of evil darkness
Trusted each move that we've made
Feeding on blood that brought us about
And we must never forsake
In the powers that moved us ahead
Brought on our lust for evil
Slaughtered in violence and lost with the dead
Never to stop us again
Clinging to that of which we have lost
Trapped in the cryptic sites
Feeding on blood that brought us about
And we must kill at night

Killing for free
Stopping the plea
Leaving the dead

Lost in the powers of evil darkness
Trusted each move that we've made
Feeding on blood that brought us about
And we must never forsake
In the powers that moved us ahead
Brought on our lust for evil
Slaughtered in violence and lost with the dead
Never to stop us again
