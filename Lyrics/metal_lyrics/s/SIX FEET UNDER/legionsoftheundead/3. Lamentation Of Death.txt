Hell burns in their soul
Dark abyss they start to grow
Demons killing, loss of control
Master Satan, still below

Gates to hell
Where they dwell
You will die
For they must
Crush your hopes
Steal your dreams
Start to scream

You try to run
It's no good
Demons have you
In their grip
You can't break free
Now your done
Takes your soul
Now they must
Turn your life into dust
Drags your soul
Back to hell
Chants a verse
Raging sea
Drinks your blood
And rings the bell

There is no heaven
Of the glory light
Now your day of torment
To live the highest law
Forget your mortal sins
They have no might
Divine thyne undoing
Blessed are the strong

Kill
Destroy
Master in death
Live to live
Forget the rest
Terror
The world, destructs the weak
Kill
Destroy
Master in death
Live to live
Forget the rest
Terror
The world
Destroys the weak
Fallen angel
Destroys the weak

Hell burns in their soul
Dark abyss
They start to grow
Demons killing loss of control
Master Satan
Still below

Gates to hell
Where they dwell
You will die
For they must
Crush your hopes
Steal your dreams
Start to scream

You will die by his hand
To the west and to the sea
Satan in hell with the dead
Skull is tearing
Now you're dead

Gates to hell
Where they dwell
You will die
For they must
Crush your hopes
Steal your dreams
Start to scream

You try to run
It's no good
Demons have you
In their grip
You can't break free
Now your done
Takes your soul
Now they must
Turn your life into dust
Drags your soul
Back to hell
Chants a verse
Raging sea
Drinks your blood
And rings the bell
