Tyranny and hatred
Signs of one command
The ruler of the sea
There are three others
His three infernal brothers
Leviathan rules supreme
Stands for the power
Which we devour
Destructs the world that we see

From the water
He comes forth
Beast of hell
All hope is lost
You will discover
Almighty power
Evil is here

Leviathan
The beast from the water
Leviathan
Leads you into the slaughter
Leviathan
The battle must be won
Leviathan
Heaven's fallen son

He stands for death
Destructs the rest
Risen in trust
Into the deep where he lies
You here cries
The devil commands
The evil one
With desire
Prey for help
The time is lost
Destruction is now
You think he's done
He's just begun
Armies march forth
The power is his
It lies within
Hell's domain

The evil is near
It's time to fear
As demons come forth
Armies of death
Obey his command
They kill
On request
They start to wreak havoc
On the sacred
They march from the west

You will discover
Almighty power
The evil is here
From the water
He comes forth
Beast of Hell

Leviathan
The beast from the water
Leviathan
Leads you into the slaughter
Leviathan
The battle must be won
Leviathan
Heaven's fallen son
