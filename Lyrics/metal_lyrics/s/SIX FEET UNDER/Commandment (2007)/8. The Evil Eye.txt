you breathe to die desperate
when you speak your final words to me
caught between lines you live lies
in a broken world
a freshly dug grave is waiting
into the bottomless
as you walk alone I follow
with knife in hand
I stalk you to devour
your human soul
and bleeding broken body
soon to rot but you're living
as you bleed I'm watching
in your mind you're insane
I stalk you to devour
I hunt you to destroy
you look so ripe to kill
your body must suffer
a vengeance to murder
nine victims
I hunt to kill

when you speak your final words to me
caught between lines you live lies
in a broken world
a freshly dug grave is waiting
into the bottomless
as you walk alone I follow
with knife in hand
I stalk you to devour
your human soul
and bleeding broken body
soon to rot but you're living
as you bleed I'm watching
in your mind you're insane
I stalk you to devour
the murder of nine
the evil eye
