will you suffer? I think that its time
a weapon of god
this sins of the dying
keeper of souls
more hate than love
death my the sword
the fury of hell
legion of sickness
lord of misery
after my death I rise in immortality
unleashing the horror my words are infected
feast on my rot
I am resurrected

resurrection of the rotten

the demons of life have taken control
burn with me now its time to behold
the glory of death
a victim of my message
feast on my rot
I am resurrected

resurrection of the rotten
resurrection of the dead

the demons of life have taken control
burn with me now its time to behold
the glory of death
a victim of my message
feast on my rot
I am resurrected

resurrection of the rotten
resurrection of the dead

legion of sickness
lord of misery
after my death I rise in immortality
unleashing the horror my words are infected
feast on my rot
I am resurrected

resurrection of the rotten
resurrection of the dead
