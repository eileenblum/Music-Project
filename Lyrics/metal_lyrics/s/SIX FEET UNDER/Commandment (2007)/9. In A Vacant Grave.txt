open the grave and taste the smell of death
the body festers
from flesh to bone
we suffer

where we lie and calcify
the nonexistent after life
we're just born to die
we're just
born to die

termination
decomposition of human flesh
the brain it dies
the body fails
the coffin nail
a painful end to this life

in a vacant grave
the soul I desecrate
in your empty tomb
its too late for you

suffering
in constant pain
suicide
you cut your veins
to hide the lies
bleed out your life
suicide
I violate the dead

in a vacant grave
the soul I desecrate
in your empty tomb
its too late for you

open the grave and taste the smell of death
the body festers
from flesh to bone
eternity
we fusser
into a hole

where we lie and calcify
the nonexistent after life
we're just born to die
we're just
born to die

termination
decomposition of human flesh
the brain it dies
the body fails
the coffin nail
a painful end to this life

in a vacant grave
the soul I desecrate
in your empty tomb
its too late for you

suffering
in constant pain
suicide
you cut your veins
to hide the lies
bleed out your life
suicide
I violate the dead
