as the blade turns blood gushes forth
another murder to bag and number
ill kill forever
until I die
brutality
a way of life

as the blade turns
as the soul burns
as the blade turns
within the wound

another body beaten
cut and stabbed
ligature marks
discovered after you've died
coroner had a difficult time determining cause of death
another one left for the infects snakes and rats

as the blade turns the sould forgot
nine years of death left to rot
scattered dead from state to state
I cut and slash as I attack
a cornered victim soon to die
broken bones a punctured eye
into the morgue cold and dead
into the morgue
cold
and dead

as the blade turns
as the soul burns
as the blade turns
withing the wound

as the blade turns you scream in pain
torturing a piece of meat
take out my anger
take out my hate
psychotic rage flows through my veins
locked away
inside your skin
a body
cut to pieces
one more goes unsolied
as the blade turn within the wound

as the blade turns
as the soul burns
as the blade turns
withing the wound
