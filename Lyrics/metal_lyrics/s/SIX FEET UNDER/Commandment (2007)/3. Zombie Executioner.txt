chainsaw mutilation
zombie decapitation
cutting off the head spurting necks attached to torsos
twitching spasms involuntary
the heart is still beating even after death
a living dead body I kill and dissect
experimenting on dead bodies
torturing as I cut off extremities
blasting through genital cavities
cutting through its guts
eyes pulled out and skull sawed open
brain removed to electrically shock
burn the seizing flesh
just to watch you scream in pain

zombie executioner
experimenting on dead bodies
abuse of the corpse
strength through the flesh
the undead flesh enlightens me
zombie executioner

I kill with fervor lust and despise
tearing up flesh killing dead bodies
bleeding
the tongue has been ripped out
slaughtering
faces have been ripped off
awaken the dead just to kill them
I chant the ancient curse
this plague cant be reversed
the moon is bright and full
the chainsaw ripping through more victims
chewed up by my weapon I test inhuman practices
on the undead flesh a blood soaked body with
no legs or hands
screaming and drooling innards down its chin
a beginning to and end
of the human race

chainsaw mutilation
zombie decapitation
cutting off the head spurting necks attached to torsos
twitching spasms involuntary
the heart is still beating even after death
a living dead body I kill and dissect

zombie executioner
experimenting on dead bodies
