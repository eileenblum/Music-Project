[Swanson/Barnes]

Murder - I kill to create again
though I never stopped the carnage
Rotten core - drenched bodies disease
from massive loss of blood
Turning blue lack of oxygen
a starving dying brain stem
Spurting - sickness
Deep inside, burning pain and hate
Beaten to death - abducted to molest
Gaping holes now cut, hacked and sliced
into flesh well-worn from my beating
Dismembered body parts - rotten
Deep inside, burning pain and hate
Beaten to death - defenseless and innocent - victims
Chopping blood gushing arteries
drain onto blue and black skin
Twisting and cutting through human flesh
and the bone that holds you together
Crippled by the knife
Bloody - rotted - body
Deep inside, burning pain and hate
Beaten to death - the maggots will infest - you
In this life I crave to kill
my love of death will never end
Vicious - homicidal
internal organ removal
More pain to endure
the threat to kill more and more
Deep inside, burning pain and hate
Beaten to death - desecrate the dead
