[Butler/Gall/Barnes]

Carving up your flesh
Until I get to the bone
Murder all I can
True death still lives on
Open wounds in sickly skin
Gangrenous infected dead
I'll tear you up - and fuck the holes I cut into you
Murderer - I rape the dead
Torture killer
Crushing bone and skin
As I break a hole through your cranium
Mutilated death
Piles of decayed victims - brutalized
Torturing the human flesh
Sadistically perverse - necrophile
Terrified you live to die to rot - dead - in a shallow grave
Murderer - I rape the dead
Torture killer
Murderer - I rape the dead
Torture killer
Carving up your flesh
Until I get to the bone
Murder all I can
True death still lives on
Open wounds in sickly skin
Gangrenous infected dead
I'll tear you up - and fuck the holes I cut into you
Murderer - I rape the dead
One sick fuck
Torture killer
