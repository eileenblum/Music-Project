[Swanson/Barnes]

Butchered - born to bleed
No known cure for my disease
I'll start to slice and kill and maim
I'll pick up a hammer smash in your face
Torn up, I'll continue to kill you
I'll grab a knife and stick it in you
Your body mangled drenched in blood - blood
Pulverized, I'm on another attack
Don't turn your back, I bought my pick-axe
Look into my eyes, these eyes are dead
As I kill I still cum blood
Torn up, I'll continue to kill you
I'll grab a knife and stick it in you
Your body mangled drenched in blood - dead
Torture, unbearable - hallucinate to victimize
More killing under way, your flesh will bear my pain
Dislocated - reconnected, stitched together
Obscene pleasure, profane vision - hacked to pieces
Severed, worm-infested, dismembered in your coffin
I'll dig you up just to kill you again
I will violate you
Rot - rot - rot
Blister - the flesh will fester, boils explode pus
Suture dead parts together, decapitated headless neck
Gouging eyes of the partially decayed
Skull cracked open to expose your brain
Blood flows - hacked to pieces
Severed, worm-infested, dismembered in your coffin
I'll dig you up just to kill you again
I will violate you
Rot - rot - rot - rot - the body will rot
Cut the throat - you'll make the heart stop
Rot - the body will rot
Arteries harden - blood now clots
Severed, worm-infested, dismembered in your coffin
I'll dig you up just to kill you again
I will violate you
Rot - rot, your body will rot
Rot - rot, your body will rot
Rot - rot, your body will rot!
