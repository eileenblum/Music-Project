[Barnes]

Every one of us already plagued
Soon to wipe out the human race
A planet of life, infected since birth
Dominated by power, war and wealth
Over time accelerated
A vicious circle we have perpetuated
We will die before we wake
We'll never know it's too late
This graveyard earth
Time to bleed again and again
When it's all over we'll just be bones in the sand
Monuments built of stone and blood and skin
Decaying through the years and found by no one
Over time accelerated
A vicious circle we have perpetuated
We will die before we wake
We'll never know it's too late
This graveyard earth
We've got our own blood on our hands
We are all cursed
Our world is dead, another faded memory
Desolation - sacrificed for nothing
This graveyard earth
Our fate we create, but we still destroy
Murdering ourselves - time to dieâ¦we are all cursed
Every one of us already plagued
Soon to wipe out the human race
A planet of life, infected since birth
Dominated by power, war and wealth
Over time accelerated
A vicious circle we have perpetuated
We will die before we wake
We'll never know it's too late
This graveyard earth
