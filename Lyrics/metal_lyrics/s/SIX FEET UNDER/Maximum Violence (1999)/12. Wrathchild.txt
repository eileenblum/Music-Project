[Harris]

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
of dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen
my dad I'd never seen
I was never meant to be.
Now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found,
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching,
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel round
Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah I'm a wrathchild
Some say it shouldn't matter,
ain't nothing gonna alter the course of my destination
But I know I've gotta find some serious peace of mind
or I know I'll just go crazy.
