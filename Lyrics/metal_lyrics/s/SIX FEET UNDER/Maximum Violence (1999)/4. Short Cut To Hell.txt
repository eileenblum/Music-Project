[Butler/Gall/Barnes]

There is no end to this - no end at all
I've seen the visions, I've heard the call
The one from below, I'll soon be back
You saw the light and turned to black
The fires, they burn
In my memory
The day I return - bleed for me
The soul is black, this soul is free
Night everlasting, dwells within me
The evil you fear - curse of the ages
Impending doom, infecting the masses
The fires, they burn
In my memory
I feed on the pain - the misery
The fires, they burn
In my memory
One day I will return
Never-ending death - everlasting pain
Cruelty - darkness falls
Horrible, hopelessness
Never-ending death - everlasting pain
For the ones I hates
There is no escape
Cruelty - darkness falls
Horrible, hopelessness
There is no end to this - no end at all
I've seen the visions, I've heard the call
The one from below, I'll soon be back
You saw the light and turned to black
The soul is black, this soul is free
Night everlasting, dwells within me
I am the evil - the evil you fear
The fires, they burn
In my memory
I feed on the pain - the misery
The fires, they burn
In my memory
One day I will return
