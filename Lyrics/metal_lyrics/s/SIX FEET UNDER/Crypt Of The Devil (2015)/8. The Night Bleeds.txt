[Lead]

Frozen dead a hundred years now
In a dream state in your nightmare
Thereâs no trace of what was done there
Or the ones that have died

Slaughtered all throughout
The dark
Killing them randomly
Taker of souls and life
Chosen to execute

Killing
Killing
Killing
Killing

Dying
Diseased
Breathing
Living
Released
Upon
Your life

In the light
I await your soul to take

Deep into the netherworld
Deep into the heart of evil

In the light
I await your soul to take

Deep into the netherworld
Deep into the heart of evil now

[Lead]

Killing
To balance life
Dying
Souls pay the price
Beyond
Your realm of death
Life fading

The night
The shadows call to me
Blood of life flows through me
The night
The shadows call to me
The night
Bleeds

No trace of what was done there
Or the ones
Died
Frozen dead a hundred years now
In a dream state in your nightmare
Thereâs no trace of what was done there
Or the ones that have died
Slaughtered all throughout the darkness
This evil is now released
To take your life into the nowhere
