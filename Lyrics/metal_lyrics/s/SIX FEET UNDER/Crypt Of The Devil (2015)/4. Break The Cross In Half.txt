Apparition from another realm of death
Now walks among you here
A bloody corpse trapped in this world to feed
On the living on the sick the rotten human
Waste will be punished will suffer now for
Years of lies and treacherous ways

Break the cross
In half
Break the cross in half
Break the cross in half
Break the cross in half
Break the cross
In half
Break the cross in half
Break the cross in half
Religion canât save you
Or your life
It has betrayed
Open the grave
Open the grave
Your soul is enslaved
Your god cannot save
You!

On the living on the sick
The rotten human waste
Will be punished will suffer now for years of
Lies and treacherous ways

[Lead]

Break the cross
In Half
Break the cross in half
Break the cross
In half
Break the cross in half
Break the cross
In half
Break the cross
In half
Break the cross in half
Religion canât save you
Or your life
It has betrayed
Open the grave
Open the grave
Your soul is enslaved
Your god cannot save
You!
Life...
