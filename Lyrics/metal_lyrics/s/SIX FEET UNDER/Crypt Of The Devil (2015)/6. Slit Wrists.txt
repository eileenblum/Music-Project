Bring forth death from out of the dark
Begins my feeding
Left behind
Another seizure deep within
I feel my disease bleeding from me
In my mind numb inside my head
Brings my sickness now to life
Digging your grave long before youâre dead I stick a razor right through my arms to
Kill them inside you die to rotten this is your death now you die blood from the body
Blood from the body leaks blood from the body I feel no pulse blood from the body
Blood from the body leaks feed on the body I feel no pulse within your skin dead in
Your skin bones break skulls crack arms bleed slit wrists this knife these veins
This sickness has been growing inside of me
This rage my evil your fear
Near death
Violence
I slice through veins and rip through the soul to die

[Lead]

Blood from the body
Blood from the body -leaks
Blood from the body
At night I bleed disease...
I feel no pulse
Blood from the body
Feed on the body bleed
Blood from the body
Feed on the body and any of life within you
