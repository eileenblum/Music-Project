Now that youâre dead
You fight my
Torment
The struggle the pain overtakes you
Forever your spirit will suffer and never
Return you never return from deep in the
Grave the torture continues endlessly
Caught in this hell burial before youâve
Died-Pain --Pain!

Now that youâre dead
You fight my
Torment
The struggle the pain overtakes you
Forever your spirit will suffer
Burial
Before youâve died
Killed
Dead now inside dead
Before
Youâve died
Pain
Pain Pain

There is no escape from
There is no return
Never to be human
Never to see light
Eternal in darkness
Buried forever

[Lead]

There is no escape from
There is no return
Never to be human
Never to see light
Eternal in darkness
Buried forever in
Mid
Night

Now that youâre dead
You fight my
Torment
The struggle the pain overtakes you
Forever your spirit will suffer and never
Return you never return from deep in the
Grave the torture continues endlessly
