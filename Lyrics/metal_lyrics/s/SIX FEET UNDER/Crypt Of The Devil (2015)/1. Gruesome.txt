Screaming now I see you suffer
Blood is gushing from the slices
Eyes punctured Iâm blinding you
So you cannot see -me
Stabbing
Cutting
Hacking parts of you away
I explore your inner body
With this butchers knife I slice
Through the sickness deep inside
Ingest
Infest
A freshly ripened kill

Until youâre in pieces, in pieces another tomb to fill

Until youâre a twitching a twitching
A twitching pile of flesh

Until youâre a sickening
A sickening a sickening rotting head
A sickening rotting head

On me, your cold blood
Your brain
With this knife
Bleeding
With this knife
Everyoneâs dead

[Lead]

Along the roadside
Bones are found
A freshly cut off leg
And two infant arms
I hold on tightly to my catch
None escape my embrace of death

Screaming now I see you suffer
Blood is gushing from the slices
Eyes punctured Iâm blinding you
So you cannot see
Me kill!
Gruesome...
Itâs gruesome inside of you
