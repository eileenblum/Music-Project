Kill
I will crush your face
And I crack your skull
Watch the brain run out
As you suffocate

Dead
I see you expire blood seeps out your head
From empty eyes now torn out tortured
After death you die!

And I eat your decayed skin
Vomiting your life
There is no one there to save
Or to hear you cry
Forced to eat your own shit and your body
Parts cutting out your vile tongue I dig a shallow grave

Dead
Shallow grave dead and buried lost for-
Ever

Dead
Shallow grave
Dead and buried
Your existence

This is no nightmare
This is your death
I will dissect you I will infect

This is the torment
The blood runs
Blood, blood from fresh wounds
My knife inside
Dead
Flesh
Rots
Away

[Lead]

Dead
Flesh
Rots
Away

Lost
Lost remains
Lost remains
In the grave
Lost remains

Lost
Lost remains
Lost remains
In the grave
Lost remains
They decay
They decay
