Bleeding for me as you scream
Stalking your worthless life at night
Slipping a rope around your throat
Makes me laugh as you choke
Breaking bones and tearing off limbs
A plastic bag around your face
With this broken bottle I rape

Deep Deep
Deep inside your holes
Cutting
Carving
Bleed Bleed bleeding out your soul
Cutting
Carving
Raping
Killing

[Lead]

Feel
The glass rip
Shred
Your
Inner cavities now vomit
Guts from you
Feel
Life slip
Away
Now
I cut your eyes
I bind your arms
I pull the teeth from your face
Itâs bleeding from every hole and laceration
Leaking pus and drool

Bleeding for me as you scream
Stalking your worthless life at night
Slipping a rope around your throat
Makes me laugh as you choke
Breaking bones and tearing off limbs
A plastic bag around your face
With this broken bottle I rape

Deep Deep
Deep inside
Your holes
Cutting
Carving
Bleed Bleed
Bleeding out your soul
Cutting
Carving
Deep Deep
Deep inside
Your holes
Cutting
Carving
Bleed Bleed
Bleeding out your soul
Cutting
Carving
Raping
Killing
