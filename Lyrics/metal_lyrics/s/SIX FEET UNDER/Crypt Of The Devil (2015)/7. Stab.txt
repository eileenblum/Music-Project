Alone this night an empty street I hunt you like youâre dead already stripped
Of skin and innards... the carnage will begin Iâve got a knife I want to stab right
Through your face I cut your neck in half

And take out each eye from your head
With a screwdriver breaking through the back of the skull with each swing I take
I release my hate now unburied with each drop of blood I spill I will own your
Soul leaving you upside down hanging from dissected legs like a rotten animal
Stab wounds through your chest

Iâve got a knife
I want to stab right through your face
I cut your neck in half

And take out each eye from your head
With a screwdriver breaking through the back of the skull

You die!

Death to this body
Draining the empty rotting hole
Death to this body
And awaken the demon soul
Alone this deadly night
The last night that youâll breathe
I await the next fresh kill
The last night that your heart will ever beat

[Lead]

With each swing that I take I release my death
