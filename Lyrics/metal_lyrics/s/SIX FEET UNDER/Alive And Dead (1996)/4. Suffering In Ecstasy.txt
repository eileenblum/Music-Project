Suffer inside myself
There is no hope
In this grave
Bottomless
The deepest depths
An empty pit
No way to live
Dead
It's killing me
This deadly plague
Poisoned blood
Runs through my veins
Finding pleasure
Within the pain
I'm suffering
A step away
From the edge
One more rush
All I need is
A harder push
There is no cure
My infection is self inflicted
I'm suffering
In ecstasy
Slowly dying
Inside my body
Locked away
With no escape
Finding pleasure
Within the pain
A step away
From the adge
All I need is
A harder push
There is no cure
My infection is self inflicted
It's killing me
This deadly plague
Poisoned blood
Runs through my veins
Finding pleasure
Within the pain
I'm suffering
Suffer inside myself
There is no hope
In this grave
Bottomless
The deepest depths
An empty pit
No way to live
Dead
A step away
From the edge
One more rush
All I need is
A harder push
There is no cure
My infection is self inflicted
I'm suffering
In ecstasy
Slowly dying
Inside my body
Locked away
With no escape
Finding pleasure
Within the pain
