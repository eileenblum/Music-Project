Pulled down to the depths
I feel that I am going under
Swept away I struggle now
Gasping for my last breath
Choking me - I can not breathe
Liquid vision, all I see

Drifting - no sign of life
Floating dead
The tide carries me
Fluid fills my lungs, as my eyes open wide
I can't reach the surface - no sense of true direction
My body turns - violently
Cramping limbs - to weak to swim
Drifting - no signs of life
Floating dead
The tide carries me
Drowning too weak to swim
Floating dead - the tide carries me away
Submerged in this grave
My body set a drift
Skin is white and cold
Sinking to the depths
In this liquid terror
Dead and motionless
Drifting - no sign of life
floating dead the tide carries me
Drowning too weak to swim
Floating dead the tide carries me

Crushed by rocks and current
I float up to the surface
My body washed ashore - swollen from exposure
Black and blue, lifeless dead
Suffocation - in liquid

Drifting - no sign of life
Floating dead the tide carries me
Drowning too weak to swim
Floating dead the tide carries me - away
