My life, my soul
My thoughts are my own
I live to die
That's why I was born
Kill or be killed
The law of the land
Standing tall, I'm not running scared

Human target

Scared, beaten
My bones were broken
Bruised, mistreated
For what I believe in
Survive or die
Fear for your life
I grip the gun tight
Three shots to the chest
One to the head
Standing tall, I'm not running scared

living through the violence
I'm just surviving - there's no way to end
This
One more dead, one survives
Instinct to live
Living through the violence
I'm just surviving - there's no way to end
This
Living through the violence
I'm just surviving - there's no way to end
This
One more dead, one survives
Instinct to live
I won't - die

My life, my soul
My thoughts are my own
I live to die
That's why I was born
Kill or be killed
The law of the land
Standing tall, I'm not running scared
Survive or die
Fear for your life
I grip the gun tight

Human Target
