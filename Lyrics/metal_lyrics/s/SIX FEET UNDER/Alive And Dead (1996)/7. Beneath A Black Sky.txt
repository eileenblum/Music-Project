Look to the sky
It's turning black
No sun shining light
Day turns into night
No moon above
Lost in the shadows
Eclipsing the sun
Only darkness above

Beneath a black sky

All life will end
Infinite winter
Eternal darkness
Thunder cracks the silence
Emptiness
Above us only black
Frozen stiff
Nothing remains

Beneath a black sky

Look to the sky
It's turning black
No sun shining light
Day turns into night
Emptiness
Above us only black
Hollow horizon
No sun rising
