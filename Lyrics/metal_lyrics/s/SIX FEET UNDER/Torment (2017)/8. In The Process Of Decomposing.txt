Decomposing, body rotting
Bloated dead, this carcass
You'll never live again
You're still dead to me
Overdose
Suicide
Cut through your veins
Gun to your head
You've cone insane
You'll never live again
You're still dead to me
Overdose
Suicide
Decomposing, body rotting
Bloated dead, this carcass
Cut through your veins
Gun to your head
You've cone insane
Cut through your veins
Gun to your head
You've cone insane

Bubbling pus and bile
The corpse is hacked apart and butched after death
The skin leaks
The worms feed
The vultures circle your bones
In the process of decomposing

The skin leaks
The worms feed
The vultures circle your bones
In the process of decomposing
The flesh melts away
Eyes are burned and charred
Fincers grasp but nothing there
Blood past the point of clotting now
The flesh melts away
Eyes are burned and charred
Fincers grasp but nothing there
Blood past the point of clotting now
Cut through your veins
Gun to your head
You've cone insane

You'll never live again
You're still dead to me
Overdose
Suicide
Decompose
