No return
From darkness
And shadows
The beyond
In torment
Life rots away
The tourniquet breaks
You keep bleeding
The end gets closer
That crushing feeling
Of death upon you
You're just a
Skeleton
Skeleton

The pressure builds in me
The eradication of life
My true philosophy
I cant stand you and fucking lies I hate
You and your insanity
You're all that I despise
Of this slaughtered only bones are used
In this prison of the jagged wounds are cut
In thee slow stripping
Of human timber
Bleed you empty to dismember
Tore off the flesh
Exposed the spine disposed
Of the brain
And carved up your life
I'll kill again
To satisfy
The hunger grows
This lust of mine

The pressure builds in me
The bladication of life
My true philosophy
I cant stand you and fucking lies I hate
You and your insanity
You're all that I despise
Of this slaughtered only bones are used
In this prison of the jagged wounds are cut
In thee slow stripping
Of human timer
Bleed you empty to dismember
Tore off the flesh
Exposed the spine disposed
Of the brain
And carved up your life
I'll kill again
To satisfy
The hunger grows
This lust of mine

The tourniquet breaks
You keep bleeding
The end gets closer
That crushing feeling
Of death upon you
You're just a
Skeleton
Skeleton
