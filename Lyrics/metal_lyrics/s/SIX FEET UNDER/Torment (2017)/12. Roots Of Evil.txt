Roots of the evil
Of the evil
One inside
I pray my soul to keep
For an eternity
Through and for all time
I am bound to serve the devil
The strength within me
I vow my soul to you
Forever with

This blood I spill
This flesh I offer
The fire grows
Roots of evil [4x]

From your slumber
Awaken
From the darkness
Incarnated
Of the flesh
It returns
Of the dead
And tormented

Roots of evil [2x]

This blood I spill
This flesh I offer
The fire grows
Roots of evil [4x]

From your slumber
Awaken
From the darkness
Incarnated
Of the flesh
It returns
Of the dead
And tormented

Blood
Cult of the dead [8x]

This blood I spill
This flesh I offer
The fire grows
Roots of evil [3x]
