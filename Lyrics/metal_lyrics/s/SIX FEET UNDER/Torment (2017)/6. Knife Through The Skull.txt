Knife through the skull through your face through
Your brain and your eyes
Dead in your head in your heart in your soul and body
Cold to the touch all is still
All the screams and horror
I plunge the knife through the bones through your
Mind and spirit
Enter the night of your death of your life
To the end
Out pours the blood
Seeps the brain
There is no escape from this I see insides of your
Thoughts I've seen your nightmares now
I watched you fade away and die
The murder never ends
The torture never stops
I care nothing anymore but the killing of all
Life
Forever

Knife through the skull through your face through
Your brain and your eyes
Dead in your head in your heart in your soul and body
Cold to the touch all is still
All the screams and horror
I plunge the knife through the bones through your
Mind and spirit
Enter the night of your death of your life
To the end
Out pours the blood
Seeps the brain
There is no escape from this I see insides of your

Cut the scalp from the skull blood chokes out life
From you
Violently attacking the flesh
I viciously cut off the head
I butchered the remains for the pigs
I opened your skull for the brain

Knife through the skull
Knife through your skull

Cut the scalp from the skull blood chokes out life
From you
Violently attacking the flesh
I viciously cut off the head
I butchered the remains for the pigs
I opened your skull for the brain

Knife through the skull
Knife through your skull

Knife through the skull
Knife through the skull
