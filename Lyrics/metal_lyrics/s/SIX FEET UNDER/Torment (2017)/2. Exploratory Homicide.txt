Arteries and veins now open
To leak their sweet juices out
Please is slowing quickly inside
Breathing varies rapidly
Body loses consciousness now
Temperature begins to drop
Drifting into emptiness
Screams and blood that never clot
Over killing
Never-ending
Into nothing
Rage within me

Sutures ripping through flesh
Now is frayed body, bleeding,
Drifting into the grave excrement
Cuts off your breathing until you are dead

I'll cut you,
I'll cut you,
I'll make you pay
For your life,
Til your death and suffering

Arteries and veins now open
To leak their sweet juices out
Please is slowing quickly inside
Breathing varies rapidly
Body loses consciousness now
Temperature begins to drop
Drifting into emptiness
Screams and blood that never clot
Over killing
Never-ending
Into nothing
Rage within me

Sutures ripping through flesh,
Now is frayed body, bleeding,
Drifting into the grave excrement
Cuts off your breathing until you are dead

Unwrap the body,
It's bleeding out
Exploratory homicide,
I'm alive for you die
The dead and decayed
Are now my slaves
For the here and after
To forever torture
