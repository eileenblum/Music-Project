The light it fades away
The cold air chills the bone
The darkness
Black appears
To shadow all is shown
The terror struck again
The blood it now does again
There is no where that's
Safe when the sun goes down
Unprotected from attack
You submit to the fear
Seven wounds in your face
Your neck slit ear to ear
Now the light it fades away
Horror is unveiled

Obsidian
The dark fear within
Obsidian
The screaming never ends
A shape is taking form
From the hate I exude
And now it roams free on this world
To do harm
A force of evolution
Nature takes control
Unable to be stopped
This darkness shadows all

I kill in the night
All life
Hands raised in defense
Hacked off
Torn apart now
Slowly
So
That you can feel

Through your tragedy
My reality
You end violently
The black is all that you see

Through your tragedy
My reality
You end violently
The black is all that you see

Obsidian
Obsidian
Obsidian

Obsidian
Obsidian
Obsidian

Blood flows to end
The deepest red
A night of gore in darkness that will never end
And the sun will never rise again
A night of gore in darkness that will never end
