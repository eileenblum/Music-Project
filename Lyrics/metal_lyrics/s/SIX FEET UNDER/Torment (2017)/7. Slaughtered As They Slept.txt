Sweat on skin blood on sheets
Awoked by a knife repeatedly stabbing
To your throat and your face
By your side
Wife teed up
Your children already dad
Killed them in their beds and crib

I plunged my knife between her lips
I feel the tongue start to split
As I ripped through her nightgown
I hear you cry out loud
I cut her nose off
Bending back the neck now snapping
Cut through the spine and chest convulsing
Now you're all dead slaughtered as they slept

Waking the dead
Slaughtered as they slept
Killed in your beds
Waking the dead
Slaughtered as they slept
Killed in your beds

Bone structure collapses total bodily destruction
No reprise from your inevitable death
You are slowly tortured
Broken is your skull and face bleeding skinless limbs
I ate the flesh kill as you screamed and squirmed to live
I am in your mind deep in your soul dead
I am in your dreams in the night lost
I am the one to fear the thing to dread
Now you will never wake from this realm

Bone structure collapses total bodily destruction
No reprise from your inevitable death you are slowly
Tortured, tortured

Sweat on skin blood on sheets
Awoked by a knife repeatedly stabbing
To your throat and your face
By your side
Wife teed up
Your children, already dad
Killed them in their beds and crib
Your children, already dad
Killed them in their beds and crib

Waking the dead
Slaughtered as they slept
Killed in your beds
Waking the dead
Slaughtered as they sleep
Now you're all dead
