There is a feeling that prevails over all others
A slippery slope my mind slides down
Leading to your murder
Malformation of the human brain
Degradation entombed within a maze
For eternal time the infinite torment of souls
Unleashing thyne madness I slice through flesh to bone

Schizomaniac

An abomination of
The gods sent to earth
A rotten corpse with no
Arm or hand, tongue or guts
Malformation of the human brain
Degradation entombed within a maze

In my reality all has been revealed to me
The turbulence of my wake shatters fucking life away

Blood - blood, its warmth drains life
From your soul exposed
Blood - blood, its warmth drains life

From the root of your being
From the chain of my control
Do you believe in nightmares
You will see what lies beyond
From the root of your being
From the chain of my control
Do you believe in nightmares
You will see what lies beyond

Blood - blood, its warmth drains life
From your soul exposed
Blood - blood, its warmth drains life

An abomination of
The gods sent to earth

Schizomaniac
