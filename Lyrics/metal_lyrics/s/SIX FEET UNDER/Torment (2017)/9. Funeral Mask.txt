On this night the blood moon in the sky
A curse has been placed upon you
Thereâs no escape from the fate that awaits
You will die slow
Close you eyes stare into the black
The darkness blinds you
Blood seeps from the shadows of you
Before you die
A dying breath escapes from your
Carcass as the plaster sets in
I capture your fear and horror
In these works of art created
The pain of your existence is captured for eternity
Remove the funeral mask
The grave awaits you
Remove the funeral mask
And watch you die
Die, bleed, rot away
Die, bleed, rot away
Remove the funeral mask
The grave awaits you
Remove the funeral mask
And watch you die
Die, bleed, rot away
Die, bleed, rot away
A dying breath escapes from your
Carcass as the plaster sets in
I capture your fear and horror
In these works of art created
Die, bleed, rot away
Die, bleed, rot away

Blood seeps from the shadows
Blood seeps from the shadows
Blood seeps from the shadows of
Of your life
