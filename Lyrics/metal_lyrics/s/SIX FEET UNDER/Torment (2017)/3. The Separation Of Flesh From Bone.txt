For your blood
For your blood
A hunger for your blood for another kill
This is your final breath as blood explodes again

Another body hangs dead in the night still warm not rotted
Another fresh corpse to play with in it's grave soon to decay
Another victim tortured not long dead but now revived for

The separation of flesh from bone
The separation of mind from soul
Abomination of the human form
The termination of the life you've known
The separation of flesh from bone
The separation of mind from soul
Razor-sharp my machete as I hack apart the body
A grave is dug and ready after pleasure's gone
The separation of flesh from bone
The separation of mind soul
Abomination of the human form
The separation of flesh from bone

Another body hangs dead in night still warm not rotted
Another fresh corpse to play with in it's grave soon to decay

I watch you twitch and seizure bleeding from your guts
I hack and slice carve the nerves to experiment
Open up the cavity
I expose the lungs
Pounding nails in your spleen
I chew the aorta
I'll take your existence
I'll take each part of you
Offer no resistance relented
To your eates intentions
I'll take your existence
I'll take each part of you
Offer no resistance relented
To your eates intentions
One leg is de-fleshed
But the skin is left
Cut off all your fingers
Wrist only tendon
Veins are
Pulled from
Gently still every single inch of skin
Has been probed and molested
Gut
Off the head
From the shoulders up
Insert a spear to position the part
Off comes the skin from the back of the neck
Vertebrae exposed spinal cord is smashed

A hunger for your blood for another kill
This is your final breath as blood explodes again
The separation of flesh from bone
The separation of mind from soul
Abomination of the human form
The termination of the life you've known
The separation of flesh from bone
The separation of mind from soul
Razor-sharp my machete as I hack apart the body
A grave is dug and ready after pleasure's gone
The separation of flesh from bone
The separation of mind from soul
Abomination of the human form
The termination of the life you've known

Another fresh corpse to play with
In it's grave soon decay
Another victim tortured not long dead but now revived for
The separation of flesh from bone
