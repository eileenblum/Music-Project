A slight cut to your femoral
Artery, all it takes is a few minutes to die
I stalk my victims in the midnight
No protection from my slice
No remorse

A deep cut to your crushed wind pipe
All it takes to stop your frightened breathing quickly
Captured you for my sick pleasure
No escape I own you now
No return

Sentenced to the grave
All of you will die
No pity for your lives
The soul from flesh excised from you

Your arm cut off and left to bleed slowly
Superficial cuts carved in your face now expressionless
One eyeball has gone missing
Lips clipped off and both eyelids droop down
Off your face

The pieces of them thrown to the wild
I let the animals scatter your bones
And eat your genitalia
Nothing left to be found of you
Nothing left

Sentenced to the grave
All of you will die
No pity for your lives
The soul from flesh excised

The knife begins to stab
To stab with each thrust that I make
The guts they exit from you,
Human life I take
A knife stuck in your face
A bunch of holes in skin
Open up the body
For the gift within

Your beating heart
Your dying brain
To hear your screams
This lust of mine

The gouging of your flesh
A repeated stabbing sound
Of my sharpened weapon
Scrapes against your broken bones
I take great pride and pleasure
With each one I carve
You will be the next
Sacrificial kill

Sentenced to the grave
All of you will die
No pity for your lives
The soul from flesh excised from you

Sentenced to the grave
All of you will die
No pity for your lives
The soul from flesh excised from you
