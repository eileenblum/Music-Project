I'm not the only one
Who's been
Thinking the way I've been
Things got to change
If they don't we'll all be dead

We've got to watch, and listen
To those things we aren't told
Our lives seem dictated
By those who
We don't know of
I'm telling you
There's a cold wind coming soon

Break free
We've got to
Break free
Or else your life is ruined
Break free from the one that binds you
Break free from the dark
Break free from the one that confines you
Break free from the dark
I'm not the only one
Who's been
Thinking the way I've been
Things got to change
If they don't we'll all be dead
Break free.
