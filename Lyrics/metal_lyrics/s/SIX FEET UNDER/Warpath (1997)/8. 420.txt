Sit back and hold your breath, just let nature take effect
A warm glow inside my bones
The touch of velvet rubbed against my soul
Thoughts of things you've always known
Thoughts of things you've always known
Break through and listen, to yourself
To your Self

Let go of perception - enter true reality
I can see through my third eye...
Sit back and hold your breath, just let nature take effect
A warm glow inside my bones
The touch of velvet rubbed against my soul
Thoughts of things you've always known
Thoughts of things you've always known
Break through and listen, to yourself
To your Self

Let go of perception - enter true reality
A sea of green will set us free
Dank
Expand my inner being
Through what the Earth provides
I hear her voice aliing
The hour has arrived...

Sit back and hold your breath, just let nature take effect
A warm glow inside my bones
The touch of velvet rubbed against my soul
Thoughts of things you've always known
Thoughts of things you've always known
Break through and listen, to yourself
To your Self

Let go of perception - enter true reality
It's 4:20
