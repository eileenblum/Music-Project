Don't speak to me about freedom
Don't speak to me about being free
Don't speak to me about freedom
Don't speak to me about being free

My mind is mine.
Amputate my mind
You just want to
My mind is mine.
No one else's
Manipulation
Now it's too late
They're gonna take
Away my freedom
Amputate my mind
You just want to
My mind is mine.
No one else's
Manipulation

Don't speak to me about freedom
Don't speak to me about being free
Don't speak to me about freedom
Don't speak to me it's just a fucking lie!
