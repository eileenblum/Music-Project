[Lyrics: Finlay/Moti]

Death or glory

I've been so bored going nowhere
Pissed off with life
Don't want no girls to hold me
I only love my knife

When it's night
I'm out on my own in the streets

There's murder on my mind

Don't hate authority
You know I'm not all mad
Know that nobody loves me
Don't make me sad

Gonna stand up
To the one's who bring me down

I've got murder on my mind

I can feel it now
It grows stronger every day

And my hatred grows
More and more in every way

Sing a song of death or glory
Sing a song of spite
Sing a song of good and evil
Gonna win my fight

I just want to flush the shit from the street

Murder on my mind
