So many caged - caged and disgraced
Too many inside - need to be out
So many caged - caged and disgraced
For doing nothing but pleasing themselves
Freedom is strength
They want to take it too
I need a place where I can do
What I want to
Sent away - for being myself
Sent away - for being me
I just wanted to live - my own life
I just wanted to live
free

So many caged - caged and disgraced
Too many inside - need to be out
So many caged - caged and disgraced
For doing nothing but pleasing themselves
Freedom is strength
They want to take it too
I need a place where I can do
What I want to

How can you judge how another one lives?
It's victimless.
