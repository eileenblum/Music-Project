Those nightmares still keep me awake
I wish that I could just sleep
And when I open my eyes
Somehow I don't feel the same
Those visions tell me to kill
Fight my thoughts - my own thoughts
I can't tell wrong from right
They break me down - they break me down
I'm slipping away
Those visions tell me to kill
Night visions
Those visions tell me to kill
Night visions
Those nightmares still keep me awake
I wish that I could just sleep
And when I open my eyes
Somehow I don't feel the same
Fight my thoughts - my own thoughts
I can't tell wrong from right
They break me down - they break me down
I'm slipping away
Kill me before I wake
