My face shows no emotion
The mind of an animal
Behind human eyes
Restrained with a rope
Crudely tied to wrists and ankles
Eyes jellied from chemical injections
Devoid of all compassion
I place no value on human life
Body temperature drops rapidly
But death comes slow
Post-mortal muscle reflexes - repeatedly choked

Your torture brings me pleasure
I climax as I murder
A mass of empty flesh, chosen to die brutally
Not one has survived - my torture and abuse
Unbearable pain and cruelty
Hatred for all fucking life

Abducted, beaten and murdered
A slow, cold-blooded death
Bones have been boiled
And removed of all flesh
Your torture brings me pleasure
I climax as I murder

Tortured until your death
Loss of blood drains from you now
Out leaks the human soul

My face shows no emotion
The mind of an animal
Behind human eyes
Devoid of all compassion
I place no value on human life
Body temperature drops rapidly - but death comes slow
Post-mortal muscle reflexes - repeatedly choked

Your torture brings me pleasure
I climax as I murder

Burning - I'm burning your blood
