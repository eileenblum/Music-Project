Tortured - been bleeding so long, I'm hungry, for my death
To come now, waiting - hatred
Dreaming of life
False hope
Dying to live, waiting to die - alone in this world
Nausea - sickness, a lifeless living body barely alive
Just breathing, no feeling - none left, not for years
Alone now, waiting to die
Bastards
Don't let me die this way
Don't let me die

Suffer in this torture - too weak to take my life
Painful, no rest - a slow death, I can't sleep
Fear - anticipation - indulgence in my own thoughts
And pain - alone now, waiting to die
Bastards
Don't let me die this way
Don't let me die

Tortured - been bleeding so long, I'm hungry, for my death
To come now, waiting - hatred
Dreaming of life
False hope
Dying to live, waiting to die - alone in this world
Nausea - sickness, a lifeless living body barely alive
Just breathing, no feeling - none left, not for years
Alone now, waiting to die
Bastards
Don't let me die this way
Don't let me die
