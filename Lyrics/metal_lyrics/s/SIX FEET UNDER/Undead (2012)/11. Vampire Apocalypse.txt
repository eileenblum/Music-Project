I have become the evil I crave
Bleeding the juice of life I will drink
Of your dead flesh, on it I feast
The flames burn my soul
In darkness I dwell
Vampire apocalypse
Rotten bodies drained
Living victims slain
Cold and empty now
Rotten bodies drained
Living victims slain
Cold and empty now
The undead have risen
The gates to hell open
Awaken the bloodthirsty
Interned for an eternity
Half the planet is dead
The gates to hell open
Awaken the bloodthirsty
Interned for an eternity
Bleeding the juice
Of life I will drink
Of your dead flesh
On it I feast
Vampire apocalypse
Rotten bodies drained
Living victims slain
Cold and empty now
Rotten bodies drained
Living victims slain
Cold and empty now
The undead have risen
Half the planet is dead
The gates to hell open
Awaken the bloodthirsty
Interned for an eternity
Half the planet is dead
The gates to hell open
Awaken the bloodthirsty
Interned for an eternity
This world entombed in darkness
Shaded from lost horizons
The population withers
Anemic, weak and ashen
All we know dies forever
All we love rots away
All we know dies forever
All we love rots away
The pus rains down from heaven
From black coulds of decay
The pus rains down from heaven
From black clouds of decay

Vampire apocalypse
