Unmarked graves
You have decayed
Neck is slit open
You bleed to death
Temptation of the flesh
A victim for my passion to kill again
The unwary meet their hell tonight
Meet my knife blade
Deep inside
I'm reckless
I have kept it in for so long
Now
Is the time to let it all out
Yeah - let it all out
Reckless
And ready to kill
On the hunt now
The terror builds
Broken bones
And a fractured cranium
Disintegration of the mind to a
Numb state of derangement
On the hunt to kill another victim slowly
It's you motherfucker!
Deep inside
I'm reckless
I have kept it in for so long
Now
Is the time to let it all out
Yeah - let it all out
Reckless
Disintegration of the mind to a
Numb state of derangement
On the hunt to kill another victim slowly
I'm reckless
