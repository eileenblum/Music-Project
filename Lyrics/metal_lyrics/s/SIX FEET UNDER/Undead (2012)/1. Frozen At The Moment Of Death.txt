Frozen at the moment of death
The beginning of the end
The soul is caught in limbo
Unthawed alive, un-repent
The body icy cold
The mind paralyzed
In mid thought
A conscious brain is traumatized
Frost reaches the inner core
Of the root
Into your holes
Black as night
Eternal ice- eternal ice!
The warmth of life
Drained from you
The cold of death what you feel
Never will you bask in heat
Your frost bit heart will never beat
Frozen at the moment of death
Cryogenically re-animated
Awake after years to murder at random
Unthawed killer
Living terror
Has awaken

[Lead guitar solo]

Frozen at the moment of death
Cryogenically re-animated
Awake after years
To murder at random
The frigid, the undead
The frozen
The bloodshed
A life now reborn to
A world soon to be dead now
The frigid, the undead
The frozen
The bloodshed
A life now reborn to
A world soon to be dead now
A killer from the past alive to kill the future
Awake to kill again and hunt
The unsuspecting
In my grave I travel time
Suspended animation
Alive to kill again and murder in the future
Frozen at the moment of death
Cryogenically re-animated
Awake after years to murder at random
Frozen at the moment of death
The beginning of the end
The soul is caught in limbo
Now awake to kill again
