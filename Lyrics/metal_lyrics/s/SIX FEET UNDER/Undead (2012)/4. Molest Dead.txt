Open skulls with bodies severed
Bleeding gutted torso leaking
Out intestine
Out drains the blood in buckets
The still heart and lungs collapse now
The pain I bring, my intent is to
End your life and butcher your corpse
Over and over and over...
Terror this night will be the beginning
Praying for mercy will be your undoing
I tear and begin to cut into you
I rape your flesh, molest and then strangle you
Cold and dead and blue and still
Eyes white and dried with no life in you
Butchered dead
I copulate the armless carcass
Slice the neck
Then drain the flesh
Live butchered livestock
Hanging upside down, cold, somewhere dark
The stench of death and rotten flesh
Blood scabs on vomit
Feces and blood wiped on your
Skin so soft and gently
I filet the skin
From thee
No one hears your screams
Terror this night will be the beginning
Praying for mercy will be your undoing
I tear and begin to cut into you
I rape your flesh, molest and then strangle you
Cold and dead and blue and still
Eyes white and dried no life in you
Butchered dead
I copulate the armless carcass
Molest dead
Hanging bodies in a shed
Still alive and twitching dead
Soon to be cut to shreds
Only your bones have been left
Molester
Of the flesh
Most dead
Out drains your blood in buckets...
Cold and dead and blue and still
Eyes white and dried no life in you
Butchered dead
I copulate the armless carcass
Slice the neck
Cold and dead and blue and still
Eyes white and dried no life in you
Butchered dead
I copulate the armless carcass
Slice the neck
Open skulls with bodies severed
Bleeding gutted torso leaking
Out intestine
Molest dead
