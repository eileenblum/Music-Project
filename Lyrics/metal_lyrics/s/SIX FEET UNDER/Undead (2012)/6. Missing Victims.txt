I will drag you to the deepest fear
Within you
There is no way to escape the final moment
Of your life slipping away to infinity
An overdose of fucking brutality
Missing
Victims in the grave
Somewhere
Cold and alone
Missing
Bodies in the ground, rotten
One more dead body you will never find
One more of my victims to kill and hide
Each of them dies slowly over 7 days
My pen the shovel for your grave
One more dead body you will never find
One more of my victims to kill and hide
Missing victims
The screaming
The voices
The rage that builds
My hatred
My sickness
The screaming
The voices
A broken skull shattered
A brain left to die
A broken skull shattered
A brain left to die
My sickness
The voices
The screaming
Missing
Victims in the grave
Somewhere
Cold and all alone
Missing
Bodies in the ground, missing
Forever to feel your sorrow
Forever to feel this empty
Forever to search in vain
Forever to feel the pain
Missing victims
