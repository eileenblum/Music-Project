Among the empty graves
Among the dying
Pandemic autopsy
Engorged, the membrane
Neurologically decomposed
You're raped at knife point
A focused violent output
Cruelty unrelenting
Near death experience
The nightmares blind you
Post murder dismemberment
They can't defend you
The god above
The ones you love
They have left you
The god above
The ones you love
Your lord forsakes you...
