My life path is to the cemetery
I have known
It's all because
I can't get through it
Now
There is no way to deal with it
I have known
All my life
I've been put down, but now is my chance to
Rise above
Rise above
Rise above it all
Rise above
I can't let go, there is no way to
Bleed it out, even if I wanted to
Gasping with my neck slit, choking
Soon I will rotten
Those broken dreams have left me to become
Broken inside
That which is lost, is more than
What is gained from this life
There is no way to deal with it
I have known
All my life
I've been put down, but now is my chance to
Rise above
Rise above
Rise above it all
Rise above
Rise
Rise above
Rise above
Rise above it all
Rise above
Passing through life with
My eyes closed, I'm closed
My soul is empty, cold with no hope
At all
The scar
Has left its mark
Deep inside this broken heart
Buried dreams have left me empty
Broken inside, this is my life
A daydream turned into a nightmare
In the graveyard
Rise
