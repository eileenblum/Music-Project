In the flames
In fire
Flesh burning
The power of explosiom
Deviation from the normal
I was born to kill in the masses
I plot my evil

Terrorize
It's time to die
For my god, for my beliefs
A sacrifice for the beast
Souls to offer, blood to spill
Embrace the opportunity to kill
A thousand dead or more
Sifting through the body parts
Open your body bags
Genius or insane?
Baptism in flames

Terrorize
It's time to die
For my god, for my beliefs
A sacrifice for the beast
In the flames
In fire
Flesh burning
The power of explosion
The time is right to kill again
To ready you for the slaughter
Open eyes are somehow blind
The innocent are murdered

In the flames
In fire
Flesh burning
The power of explosion

Souls to offer, blood to spill
Embrace the opportunity to kill
A thousand dead or more

Terrorize
It's time to die
For my god, for my beliefs
A sacrifice for the beast
