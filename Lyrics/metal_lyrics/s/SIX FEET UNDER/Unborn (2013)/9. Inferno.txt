I set myself on fire
To burn my empty soul
A way to the inferno
Journey to the fire
The abyss, the darkness
The flames they light my way
A way to hell
The flames they purify my way
A way to hell
The flames they purify my life
The fire sets me free
From all my fucking pain
The flames they quench the dried up life I leave behind
A river of as deep all your empty fucking faith
That wave of love will never douse this one man's pain
The inferno - inferno
Combustible, the body is well soaked and primed
A sudden spark sets off a massive flesh bonfire
Imploding body parts on fire, spraying flames
And gore, and light, and ash
Of my life that remains
The inferno - inferno
Eternally in hell
I set myself on fire
To burn my empty soul
A way to the inferno
Journey to the fire
The abyss, the darkness
The flames they light my way
A way to hell
The flames they purify
