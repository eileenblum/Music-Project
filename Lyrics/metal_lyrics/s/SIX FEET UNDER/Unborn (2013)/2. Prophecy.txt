You think it's all about you but
My terror will explode soon
This horror that is now true
This black prophecy of doom

I'm never gonna to let them kill us
I'm never gonna to give fighting
I'm never gonna give in and listen
I'm never gonna to let them take it

Prophecy, of endless pain and suffering
The prophecy of endless suffering

Never gonna let them kill us
Never gonna give up fighting
Never gonna give in and listen

I'm never gonna to let them take it
You think it's all about you but
My terror will explode soon
This horror that is now true 
This black prophecy of doom

I'm never gonna let them kill us
I'm never gonna give up fighting
I'm never gonna give in and listen
I'm never gonna let them take it

Prophecy, of endless pain and suffering
The prophecy of endless suffering

Never gonna let them kill us
Never gonna give up fighting
Never gonna give in and listen
I'm never gonna to let them take it

Prophecy...
