Perversion, the sickness, it grows
Blisters they fester on skin now
Rotten, your genitals now bloat
Pus seeps from holes poked through dead flesh

Decapitate the dead awake
Decapitate your soul they'll take
Pus seeps from holes poked through dead flesh
Brain open, dissected and leaks
Organs of your corpse fall from you
Rigor mortis slowly sets in

Decapitate the dead awake
Decapitate your soul they'll take
Decapitate reanimate
Decapitate
The dead awake

The dead they feed
On life on souls
The dead they want your life
Your blood
The dead they feed
On life on souls
Your brain and bowels
Your life
Your bones

Decapitate the dead awake
Decapitate your soul they'll take
Decapitate reanimate
Decapitate
The dead awake
