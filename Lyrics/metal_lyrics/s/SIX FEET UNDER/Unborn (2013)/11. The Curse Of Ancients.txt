This world of emptiness has suffered long
The curse of ancients ones will infect us all
A plague now long forgot lost far beyond
The terror deep inside that you
cant escape from

The pain - the fight
The fear - of life
O death - to die
And rot - alive

To amputate I desecrate
The human mind
The empty grave
The last embrace
This twisted fate
The empty grave
The human mind

The rotten

The pain - the fight
The fear - of life
O death - to die
And rot - alive

This world of emptiness has suffered long
The curse of ancients ones will infect us all

The rotten

To amputate I desecrate
The human mind
The empty grave
The last embrace
This twisted fate
The empty grave
The human mind

The broken the dying
The rotten
The living
Your soul forever screaming
The fear to die and rot alive
Rot alive.....
