The killing, the brutal way
I take the life from the innocent
Of God, torture, and blood
I live for open sores on your body
To drain the pus
To feed
The blood, the bile
The bitterness
The sickness
The brain dies...
The blood, the bile
The bitterness
The sickness
Neruo osmosis
I bleed on the corpse
Let it bleed
The slow end to
The rebirth of
This wound in me, this wound in me
Neuro osmosis
Free from the pain, take the only way out
- it's the only way...
