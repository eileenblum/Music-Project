The pleasure pain unrelenting slowly tortured
The sinister craving
A trophy taken from her naked body mutilated
Composed of bone derived of flesh and blood bone
Flesh and blood
The bleeding vein it leaks for me now
The bleeding leaks for my thirst and hunger
I have a sinister craving for the blood that your heart pumps through you
I've got a hunger for your wounds
It's all I live for
It's all I am
My lust for blood grows inside
The sinister craving
The pleasure pain unrelenting slowly tortured
The sinister craving
A trophy taken from her naked body mutilated
Composed of bone derived of flesh and blood
