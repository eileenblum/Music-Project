Psychosis
An unknown psychosis self-induced, left uncured
Undying unwritten
Devotion to the devil
Psychosis
To murder
Psychosis an unknown death
Psychosis to murder
Psychosis
An unknown death

Eternally it waits to take this
Broken life
And unknown psychosis self-induced left uncured
Rage builds the
Waves of insanity
Daydreams now turn black
Again the evil enters me
This curse has slammed the door on my walking corpse
Psychosis to murder
Psychosis
An unknown death
Psychosis to murder
Psychosis
The voices - the twisted

Something in my mind
Something out to kill
Something in the night
Something out to kill

Psychosis
