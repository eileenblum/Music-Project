I sold my soul to the devil
But I would have burned in hell for free
I hunt to dismember
The body holds the treasure
Blood, they key to life
In death we return to light
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the birth of me
A new beginning
Every single orifice bleeding
Incision, deep down hurting
Unknown terror continuing
More dead victims accumulating
One more killed for the sacrifice
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the birth of me
A new beginning
Every single orifice bleeding
I'm the reason you're afraid of the dark
I'm the reason you scream inside
I'm the reason you close your eyes
I'm the thing that you fear at night
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the birth of me
A new beginning
Every single orifice bleeding
Incision
Incision, deep down hurting
Unknown terror continuing 
More dead victims accumulating
One more killed for the sacrifice 
I'm the reason you're afraid of the dark
I'm the reason you scream inside 
I'm the reason you close your eyes
I'm the thing that you fear at night
