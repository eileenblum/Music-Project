[Metallica cover]

Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling, hear them calling me

Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings, spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings

Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy, everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling, hear them calling me

Into ruin I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy, myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling, frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling, hear them calling me
