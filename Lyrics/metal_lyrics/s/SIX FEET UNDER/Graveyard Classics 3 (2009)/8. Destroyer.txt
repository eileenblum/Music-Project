[Twisted Sister cover]

He spent his life
A silent sentinel for all to fear
He walks, he talks
He thinks, he feels

But no dare go near, he takes in all he sees
Nothing escapes his gaze
And when he strikes he strikes for right
A glorious sight

Destroyer, destroyer, destroyer
He's in town

He came to be from a grand mistake
A mystical charade created to decide the good
And bring repercussive aid
As awareness filled his fame

He examined those who leered
Then he cleaved the air with his fiery stare
Rend all those there

Destroyer, destroyer, destroyer
He's in town
Destroyer, destroyer, destroyer
He's in town

A day will come
You'll be drawn into the center of your town
And come upon a mass of steel
That cracks the very ground

Prepare to meet your judge
Don't think to run away
Just pray your face
Holds no disgrace for the deadly ace

Destroyer, destroyer, destroyer
He's in
Destroyer, destroyer, destroyer
He's in town, oh, he's town

You'd better stay out of his way
He's gonna kick your ass, yeah, destroyer
