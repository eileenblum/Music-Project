[Ramones cover]

Psychotherapy, psychotherapy
Psychotherapy, that's what they wanna give me
Psychotherapy, psychotherapy
Psychotherapy, all they wanna give me

I am a teenage schizoid
The one your parents despise
Psychotherapy
Now I got glowing eyes

I am a teenage schizoid
Pranks and muggings are fun
Psychotherapy
Gonna kill someone

Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy

I like takin' Tuinal
It keeps me edgy and mean
I am a teenage schizoid
I am a teenage dope fiend

I am a kid in the nut house
I am a kid in the psycho zone
Psychotherapy
I'm gonna burglarize your home

Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy, psychotherapy, psychotherapy
Psychotherapy, that's what they wanna give me
Psychotherapy, psychotherapy
