Your death, your blood, your life, you re dead
To the death- slit your neck- dark, dark demons haunt
The death- in death, demons haunt
The heart pumps then it stops
Flow through your life then you drop
Blood- the blood- in blood, dark demons haunt
The very blood that runs through you
It's time to die when your skin turns blue
Your skin turned blue you breathed your last breath
Rotten in the crypt is your next step
Friend with the maggots in your head
Bleed again and again- die  you re dead
Feel it dripping- feel the drip, formaldehyde you re prepared for the crypt
But it's cold, in the grave, in my tomb
When skin turns blue you ll know your time is through
You re dead inside of you crawl back into the womb
God damn-you
God damn- my soul
God damn- you
God damn- all of you
