I gotta find my way outta hell- I gotta find my way alone
I see myself dead by suicide by a knife, gun, a blade- or hanging high
Will I be safe or will I die  can I stop the voices deep inside, my mind
Dead to me- you re dead to me- you re dead to me, all dead to me
Oh my fucking God!
I'm a victim I've lived through disaster- pushed too far this is a reaction
I hate your lies. I hate my life
Dead to me- you re dead to me- you re dead to me, all dead to me
Oh my fucking God!
I'm a victim I've lived through disaster- pushed too far this is a reaction- to you
I hate your lies. I hate my life
Hoping I ll find a way, a way to live, dead together
A way to hide my fears, a way to disappear
I can't take it- I won't make it, I ll just hate it- I can't take it
I won't make it- I just hate it, I can't take it
I can't change it- I can't take it- I can't take it, I won't make it
Dead to me- you re dead to me- you re dead to me, all dead to me
Dead  dead  you re soon to be dead
I put a 12-gauge under my chin
Dead to me- you re dead to me- you re dead to me, all dead to me
Oh my fucking God!
I'm a victim I've lived through disaster- pushed too far this is a reaction
 died a thousand times again and again-in my mind- I have died
I have slowly withered
