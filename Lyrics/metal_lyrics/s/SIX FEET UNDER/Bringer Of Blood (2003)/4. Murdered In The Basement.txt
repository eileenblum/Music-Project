Murdered in the basement, blood stains on cement
Murdered in the basement, a hammer to the head
Murdered in the basement, something's rotten in the cellar
Murdered in the basement, don't go down there!
I hate your fucking guts, your world makes me sick
Tell me what to do, I got a special place for you
Murdered in the basement, in  concrete grave
Murdered in the basement, an ice pick to the face
Murdered in the basement, something's rotten in the cellar
Murdered in the basement, don't go down there
I hate your fucking guts, your world makes me sick
Tell me what to do, I got a special place for you
Buried in a concrete grave after you re dismembered and raped
A skeletons hand shoved up your ass
Food for the worms and rats
Murdered in the basement, time to dig a hole
Murdered in the basement, lyme to cover the smell
Murdered in the basement, something's rotten in the cellar
Murdered in the basement, don't go down there
Murdered in the basement, an 8th hole in your head
Murdered in the basement, killing for revenge
Murdered in the basement, a knife stuck in my back
Murdered in the basement, food for the worms and rats
I hate your fucking guts, your world makes me sick
Tell me what to do, I got a special place for you
