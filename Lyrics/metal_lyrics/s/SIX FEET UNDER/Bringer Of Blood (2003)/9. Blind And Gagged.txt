Blind and gagged
Not gonna ask permission
Not gonna follow traditions- I am not your victim
So leave me the fuck alone- leave me the fuck alone
I die- you die- we die- we all fuckin  die!
Death is in front of me but life is behind me
I die- you die- we die- alive
I die- you die- we die- we re all fuckin  dead
It's not gonna break me
I'm not gonna break
I won't let it take me
It won't overtake
To after perception, is to after reality
I'd rather die than live in your fantasy- blind and gagged
Blind and gagged
Not gonna ask permission
Not gonna follow traditions- I am not your victim
So leave me the fuck alone- leave me the fuck alone
I die- you die- we die- alive
I die- you die- we die- we re already fuckin  dead
