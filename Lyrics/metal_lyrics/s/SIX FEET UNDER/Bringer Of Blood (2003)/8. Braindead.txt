Crack my skull inside my head once alive now braindead
Stick a needle in my skin- I can't feel a fucking thing
I can't control the way I have lived through the horror the terror the murders
Tap the vein and let it flow, slow
Inside my heart, cold and hollow
I feel no remorse
My heart beats but I think I'm deceased
Braindead time to pull the plug
Braindead I feel no love
Braindead you've stopped breathin
Braindead I'm hunting humans this season
