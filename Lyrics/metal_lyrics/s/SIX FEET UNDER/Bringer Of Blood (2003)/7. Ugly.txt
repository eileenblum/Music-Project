Ugly inside, ugly outside
I can't stand to hear their screams, it's all like some kind of terrible dream
I close my eyes and I start to drip in sweat
When the lights go out  I dream of death!
I wake up and see the blood, then I remember what I have done
I closed my eyes and then I kill- kill- kill
When I woke up they were all fucking dead!
You are so ugly you deserve to die- you deserved to die
Crawl inside that ugly brain of yours  and I ll get inside my ugly brain
A twist of fate a twist of the blade- the choices we make, we dig our own graves
A twist of fate a twist of the blade, beauty they say is only skin deep
We dig our own grave, a twist of the blade- I ll dig your grave
We re ugly inside- ugly outside
10 dead bodies just a rotting away- I got  em all propped up next to me, in my room
A chopped-off leg a popped-out eye  I hope you are the next to die!
I feel the ugliness- I hear your screams
