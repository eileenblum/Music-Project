I only kill when I can't keep them four days and then I sleep them-
To the grave  that's right bitch, uh huh
You ll know I'm there when I follow turn around I'm behind you
I'm in the shadows close, so close I've almost got you
Doomed to the end dead from the beginning
That's right hear what the fuck I'm saying
I can't think straight I'm gonna break, break down
You can't escape you re gonna die slow now
It's all a part of my master plan
Everyone ends up dead in the end
Hell yeah
What the fuck you gonna do now, huh?- pray to a God that isn't there? No
Fall to your knees and die for me- I have the cure for your Christian disease
I live this life to kill, homicidal
And now you lie dead with your Bible
Choke on your fucking cross motherfucker
I hope your soul is lost forever
Nothing will change in me- nothing will ever change
Nothing will change in you- nothing will ever change
We re surviving on hatred, we re surviving on hate
Nothing will ever change my hatred
