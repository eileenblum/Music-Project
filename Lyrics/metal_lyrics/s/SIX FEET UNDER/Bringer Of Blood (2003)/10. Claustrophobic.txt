I feel like the walls are closing in
I'm still alive but I might as well be dead
I feel like the walls are closing in
I feel like the walls are closing in on me
Imprisoned locked up like I'm in a skin coffin
Doubt about the thought will I ever taste freedom
Take away me body I feel empty as a victim
I cannot wait, I cannot wait- I cannot wait for dying
Caged like a rat and I'm gonna start a freaking
To die right now would be a real fucking treat
And compared to being in this fucking shithole where I'm treated like an animal
No an animal's protected from extinction
Locked up like I'm in a skin coffin
I'm in a jail in my soul
I know there's no escaping
I feel like the walls are slowly closing in on
Sometimes I wish the reaper would just come and take my body to the grave
Then I could just wait for you in your dreams
