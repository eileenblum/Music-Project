[Dead Kennedys]

I am Governor Jerry Brown
My aura smiles
And never frowns
Soon I will be president ...
Carter power will soon go away
I will be FÃ¼hrer one day
I will command all of you
Your kids will meditate in school

California Ãber Alles
Ãber Alles California

Zen fascists will control you
100% natural
You will jog for the master race
And always wear the happy face
Close your eyes, can't happen here
Big Bro' on white horse is near
The hippies won't come back you say
Mellow out or you will pay

California Ãber Alles
Ãber Alles California

Now it is 1984
Knock knock at your front door
It's the suede/denim secret police
They have come for your uncool neice
Come quietly to the camp
You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp
Don't you worry, it's only a shower
For your clothes here's a pretty flower...
DIE on organic poison gas
Serpent's egg's already hatched
You will creak, you little clown
When you mess with President Brown

California Ãber Alles
Ãber Alles California
