[Jimi Hendrix]

Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things just don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple Haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
What ever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no

Purple haze all in my eyes, uh
Don't know if its day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

Oh, no, oh
Oh, help me
Purple haze - Tell me, baby, tell me I can't go on like this
Purple haze - You're makin' me blow my mind...mama
Purple haze - n-no, no
Purple haze - No, its painful, baby
