Salvation - is a crippled bitch
Satisfaction - from murdering
Evil voices - made me do it
The devil - made me want it
The Priest - he had to die
So did that family of five
No way to stop what you cannot find
No way to kill - it never dies

EVIL

Push me too far - I might just snap
Blood shot ice - and a knife in my hand
Pissed off - at society
Sick of them - looking down at me
So I went - to school with a loaded uzi
And I made sure - that no one survived
No way to stop what you cannot find
No way to kill - it never dies

EVIL

It never dies
It's in us

EVIL
