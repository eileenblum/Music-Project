Severed ead - eyes gouged out
Knife jammed in your ass
Shotgun in your mouth
A thousand ways to kill
and I'd like to try them out
A rope around your neck
Or a razor through your wrist

It's all about to end - all
Soon you'll all be dead - all

Operation slow vivisection
Inner organs now removed from
Emptied ribcage, head smashed open
Deseased brain probed
Eyes wide open

It's all about to end - all
Soon you'll all be dead - all

I'll be your victim
Come on fuck me up
It won't be easy
We'll see if you can cut me up
Sick and Twisted
Let's fight a real fight
Let's duel until the death
I love the taste of blood that feeling of a dying breath
Sick and Twisted
I'll be your victim
Come on count me in
I cant't wait to fell the pain
It's something I believe in

Your blood runs down my face
Now your guts drool out my mouth
Try to scream your tongue's cut out
Heart tries to beat but blood's run out

It's all about to end - all
Soon you'll all be dead - all

Severed head - eyes gouged out
Knife jammed in your ass
Shotgun in your mouth
A thousand ways to kill
and I'd like to try them out
On you
