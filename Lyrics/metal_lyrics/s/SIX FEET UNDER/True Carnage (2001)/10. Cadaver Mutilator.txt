Cadaver Multilator, cadaver butchery
A love for truth of flesh
A love for purity
Purity of flesh now torn - torn from your live reborn
Mortal extermination
To kill repeatedly - your will not be found at all

Vomit spews from your mouth reeking of desease
And piss
Shit ran down - your leg at death
Taste the rot of human life, breathe
The stench of decayed blood
Missing teeth and lower jaws
Losing half

A foot and arm
Joined together different victims
Kiiping bones and human flesh
Frozen head and eyes on ice
Cutting off an ear to eat
Hoarding all the body parts
Genitals are cut from you
Rearranging human beings

Cadaver mutilator, cadaver butchery
A love for truth of flesh
A love for purity
Purity of flesh now torn -
torn from your life reborn
Mortal extermination
To kill repeatedly -
&amp;nsbpyou will not be found at all

Missing toes and several fingers
Foot and ankle joined together
Arms cut off and shoved into cunts
Jacked off at the hips
Nose sewn to an upper leg
Lips used to masturbate
Kill the next I see - freeze their injuries
Dismantling a human being
Reattach a frozen head
To another's rotten neck - turning
From the blood it lacks
I can smell the pain of death
I will taste the bleeding dead
Cadaver mutilator, cadaver butchery
Torn up all for my pleasure, torn up all for the meat
Cadaver mutilator, cadaver butchery
The body's sewn together
My work of art complete
