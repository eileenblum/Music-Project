She take you down easy
Going down to her knees
Going down to the devil
Down down to ninety degrees
She's blowing me crazy
Till my ammunition is dry

She's using her head again
She's using her head
She's using her head again

I'm just givin' the dog a bone

She's no Mona Lisa
She's no Playboy star
But she'll send you to heaven
Then explode you to Mars

She's using her head again
She's using her head
She's using her head again

I'm just givin' the dog a bone

She got the power of union
She only hits when it's hot
And if she likes what you're doing
She'll give you alot
(Given everything she got)

I've just given the dog a bone
