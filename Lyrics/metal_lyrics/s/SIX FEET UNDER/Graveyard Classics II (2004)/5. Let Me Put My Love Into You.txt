Flying on a free flight
Driving all night
With my machinery
'Cause I got the power
Any hour
To show the man in me
I got reputations
Blown to pieces
With my artillery
I'll be guided in
We'll be ridin'
given what you got to me

Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight

Like a fever
Burning faster
You spark the fire in me
Crazy feelings
Got me reeling
They got me raising steam

Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
Cause it's your turn tonight

Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife

Let me give it all to you
