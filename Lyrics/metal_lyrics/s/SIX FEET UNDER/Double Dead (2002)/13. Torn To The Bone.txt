Blood on skin, so pale
Stained and cold
there's something I've wanted
for so long

the taste of flesh
hunger for blood
sever the skin
torn to the bone

fresh blood bleeds
dripping from wounds
veins leak
as skin turns blue

the taste of flesh
hunger for blood
sever the skin
torn to the bone

Bodies ripped apart
skin begins to rot
injest the infection
of the dead

Blood on skin, so pale
stained and cold
this is something I've wanted
for so long

the taste of flesh
Hunger for blood
Sever the skin
torn to the bonÃ©
