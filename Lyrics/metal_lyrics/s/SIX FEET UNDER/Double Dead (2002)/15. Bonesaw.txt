[Butler/Gall/Barnes]

Bodies missing legs and arms
Head is crushed to a reddish pulp
Torso drained of blood and bile
Butchered rotted corpse defiled
Hand me the bonesaw
Time for dissection
Hand me the bonesaw
Begin the amputation
Dying slow and painfully
A gasping breath escapes from you
I rip the flesh and cut through bone
You are bleeding
Sawed your body parts away
Disgusting rotten stench surrounds
Gushing stumps are frayed and torn
Exposing cartilage and bone
Hand me the bonesaw
Time for dissection
Hand me the bonesaw
Begin the amputation
Dying slow and painfully
A gasping breath escapes from you
I rip the flesh and cut trough bone
Alive to watch your arms removed
Cutting - killing sawed to pieces
Jagged wounds in bodies naked
Scraping bone the marrow leaks
Mouth taped shut so you can't scream
Saw blade binding cranial
Separate, coagulate, ripped to shreds
Vivisect, operate
Hand me the bonesaw
Time for dissection
Hand me the bonesaw
Begin the amputation
