[Swanson/Barnes]

I can't take it anymore
Got me hiding from myself
They put me away long ago
Another P.O.W.
Lost my mind now twenty years
Let it slip - not too far gone
Can't go on another day
Freedom in this day and age
It's all just a fucking game
I'm not the criminal
I'm not the one to hate
Thrown away into the void
A victim of the paranoid
Victim of the paranoid - a victim of the paranoid
Victim of the paranoid - a victim of the paranoid
I feel like I'm living in another dimension
Misled minds keep on spreading confusion
Kill, kill, kill, I want to kill them all
And put an end to their fascist laws
Open - open your mind
Victim of the paranoid - a victim of the paranoid
Victim of the paranoid - a victim of the paranoid
It seems like such a waste of time
We all can't be this fucking blind
As I sit and wonder why
One more mind is locked inside
