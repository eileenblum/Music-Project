And the end begins
Slaughter
Time of humans end
Terminated
Enter bowls of hell
Curl up and die
Cowarding - controlled

You are nothing
You will fear thee
Pleague of zombies
Curse of the living

Lost a world of pleasure
Now here comes the torture
Murderers and killers
Once your friends
And neighbours

Rising from the grave
Writhing in pain
I want to eat your brain
We're rising from the grave

Burning fires
Homes and cities
Torn to shit from
War and poverty
Overcrowding led to killing
Decaying bodies left unburied
Crimson famine kept on spreading
Breeding Ignorance
Declining populace
The day the dead walked
Apocalypse
The day the dead walked
The armageddon
The day the dead walked
Apocalypse
The day the dead walked

Rising from the grave
Writhing in pain
I want to eat your brain
We're rising from the grave
