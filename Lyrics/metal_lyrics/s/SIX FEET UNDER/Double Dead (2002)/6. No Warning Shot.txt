[Butler/Gall/Barnes]

The end of all law
4 shots fired another body falls
I execute the guilty violently
Undercover killing spree - no warning shot
Die motherfucker, die, die
Die motherfucker, die, die
Die motherfucker, die, die
I'll put a bullet between your fucking eyes
Pull the trigger - cock the hammer back
5th shot to the back of your neck
You're not a threat, you're a fucking disease
Eradicate the enemy
Dead body - another crime scene
Blood-stained pavement, chalk outline
Bullet holes you're dead and cold
The end of all law - no warning shot
Die motherfucker, die, die
Die motherfucker, die, die
Die motherfucker, die, die
Die - I put the gun to the side of your head
Squeezing the trigger...
Powder burnt skin, breaking through cranial bone
Decayed brain tissue implodes
Just another life that you thought you could control
Just another pig - dead - with some extra holes
You better think again, before I kill again
You won't survive, when the bullets start to fly
Protect and serve yourself
Dug your own grave, now rot
In that hole decay
The murder will never stop - no warning shot
Die motherfucker, die, die
Die motherfucker, die, die
Die motherfucker, die, die
I'll put a bullet between your fucking eyes
Die...
