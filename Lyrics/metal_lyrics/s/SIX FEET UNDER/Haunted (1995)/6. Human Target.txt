My life, my soul
my thoughts are my own
I live to die
that's why I was born
kill or be killed
the law of the land
standing tall, I'm not running scared

Human target

Scarred, beaten
my bones were broken
bruised, mistreated
for what I believe in
Survive or die
fear for your life
I grip the gun tight
three shots to the chest
one to the head
Standing tall, I'm not running scared

living through the violence
I'm just surviving - there's no way to end this
one more dead, one survives
instinct to live
living through the violence
I'm just surviving - there's no way to end this
living through the violence
I'm just surviving - there's no way to end this
one more dead, one survives
instinct to live
I won't - die

My life, my soul
my thoughts are my own
I live to die
that's why I was born
kill or be killed
the law of the land
standing tall, I'm not running scared
survive or die
fear for your life
I grip the gun tight

Human Target
