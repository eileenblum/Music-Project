Premonition, I dreamt of horror
knowledge of the future
i've broken through the barrier

Transcend beyond my body
the spirits call to me
these nightmares are reality

Reflections - of another life
Reflections - in my eyes

Visions, victims
I've seen each death
murder, torture
I know the next - dead

Through shadows of the mind
Reaching for the light
I've seen them die
When I close my eyes

Reflections - of another life
Reflections - in my eyes

I've seen the dead
tomorrow's victim
I've told of places I've seen
but have never been

Terror, fear
as each life ends
Horror, dread
I've seen the next - dead
