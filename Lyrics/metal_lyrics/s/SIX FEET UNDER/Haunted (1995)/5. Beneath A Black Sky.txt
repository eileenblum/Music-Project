look to the sky
it's turning black
no sun shining light
day turns into night
no moon above
lost in the shadows
eclipsing the sun
only darkness above

beneath a black sky

All life will end
infinite winter
eternal darkness
thunder cracks the silence
emptiness
above us only black
frozen stiff
nothing remains

beneath a black sky

look to the sky
it's turning black
no sun shining light
day turns into night
emptiness
Above us only black
hollow horizon
No sun rising
