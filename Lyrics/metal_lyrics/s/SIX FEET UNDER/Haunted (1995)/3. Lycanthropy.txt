The blood of the wolf
Infects my body
in the night hear the howling
screaming, flesh chewed to the bone
bleeding, eternal horror

dying in the darkness
now one of us
bitten by the wolf
now one of us

When the moon is full
And the night comes down
Fear all unnatural sounds
Human beast, animal
Curse of the lycanthrope

dying in the darkness
Now one of us
bitten by the wolf
Now one of us

Carnivorous
lust for human flesh
legacy of blood
Another victim

Carnivorous
lust for human flesh
legacy of blood
infected dead

the blood of the wolf
infects my body
in the night hear the howling
screaming, flesh chewed to the bone
bleeding, eternal horror
When the moon is full
And the night comes down
Fear all unnatural sounds
Human beast, animal
Curse of the lycanthrope
