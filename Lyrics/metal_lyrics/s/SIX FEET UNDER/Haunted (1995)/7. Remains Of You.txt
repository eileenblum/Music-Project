You saw your life pass before your eyes
I watched your body twist in pain
Rotten bodies, dead
leaking pussing limbs
Separated heads
smell the rotting dead
degenerating flesh
mutilated after death
moulded decayed skin
decomposition
bodily disintegration

I took an axe to your head
chopping rotten flesh
brain is seeping from the cracks in your skull
blood drains from holes in your torso
I took your life from you

Collapsed organs now rot and corrode
Your empty body - bloated
Pus clots on discolored skin
lifeless abused remains
Remains of you
nothing remains of you
once alive
Now just pile of flesh
decomposition
bodily disintegration

I took an axe to your head
chopping rotten flesh
brain is seeping from the cracks in your skull
blood drains from holes in your torso
I took your life from you

I violate the rotten dead
bodies tortured, stiffened carnage
in my mind I need to kill
Amputate, cutting skin, through the bone
disfigured human flesh
leaking pussing limbs
separated heads
smell the rotting dead

I took an axe to your head
chopping rotten flesh
brain is seeping from the cracks in your skull
blood drains from holes in your torso
I took your life from you

I defile the rotten corpse
mutilated after death
moulded decayed dead
Your empty body - bloated
Pus clots on discolored skin
lifeless abused remains
Remains of you
nothing remains of you
