I hear screams, echoes of the dead
in the silence - screaming
Haunted by the dead
listen
they're calling me to join them

Rotting away
I'm decomposing
Rotting inside
Slow decay

I wake screaming in the middle of the night
burning inside
I'm turning cold

Rotting away
I'm decomposing
Rotting inside
Slow decay

Skin sweating, my heart skipped a beat
something behind me
something I can't see

Rotting away
I'm decomposing
Rotting inside
Slow decay

Haunted - haunted
haunted by the dead

Rotting away
I'm decomposing
Rotting inside
Slow decay

Silence the screaming has stopped
my body hangs dead, swinging from a rope
in the silence
listen
they're calling you to join them

Rotting away
I'm decomposing
Rotting inside
Slow decay
Rotting away
I'm decomposing
Rotting inside
