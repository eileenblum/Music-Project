It gained control of me
the dark side of my mind
this hollow shell
A body with no soul

Feeding on me, growing inside, this parasite
dormant within, now it's alive, it came to life
Feeding on me, growing inside, this parasite
dormant within, now it's alive, it came to life

With each breath I take
I feel the pain
It has a hold of me
the thoughts I think
deep within my body
eating me from inside
I can't control
this other self

The enemy, the enemy, the enemy inside of me

Feeding on me, growing inside, this parasite
dormant within, now it's alive, it came to life
Feeding on me, growing inside, this parasite
dormant within, now it's alive, it came to life

Separate from myself
Actions without thoughts
in constant agony
distortion of reality
Alternate emotions
now come to life
my soul asleep
unconscious, but awake

The enemy, the enemy, the enemy inside of me

Feeding on me, growing inside, this parasite
dormant within, now it's alive, it came to life
Feeding on me, growing inside, this parasite
dormant within, now it's alive, it came to life

It gained control of me
the dark side of my mind
this hollow shell
A body with no soul
With each breath I take
I feel the pain
It has a hold of me
the enemy inside
