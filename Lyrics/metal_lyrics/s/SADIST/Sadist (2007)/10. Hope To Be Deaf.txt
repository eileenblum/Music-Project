It happens sometimes you feel alive inside
your eyes would never want to open
all around, laughter become a sole sad sound

it raises and amplifies in your brain
into ears hoping to be deaf
noises are confused

it's difficult to recognize all the sounds
they are still laughing, apparently happy

hopeless, everything is gone
searching for an exit that does not exist
they push you somewhere in the middle
where all their eyes are laughing at you

It happens sometimes you feel alive inside
your eyes would never want to open
all around, laughter become a sole sad sound
