Here in front of what there is
there are not rows of really green grass
up there, on the hill, what's going on?
it's her white and ancient house

where is earth without life
grey hair tell and explain

because branches embracing us they howl
forms of life
draw the sky, I feel you, cursed man,
I know you are alive

who, alive, here, inside
tired man, creatures of the night
'cause crumbled walls are telling us
dry land will be, its corner where it works

I want to reach a loft where there is something

white man, it rains within
water, here comes the winter
because branches embracing us they howl
forms of life
draw the sky, I feel you, cursed man,
I know you are alive
