I lived my full life like a rainy river
I kissed the ground and all its brothers
I drank salt water, ate fishes and sand
today I'm a sailor of many seas
tomorrow a naked priest

my legs are friends that shared
one thousand journeys to Hell
my knees remember the way
one thousand journeys to Hell

I kissed unloved women and paid their naked bodies
I spat anger without a reason
and rested in an unlocked room
come inside my friend just stop and have a rest
here I am, the man of the earth
I saw everything I could

dark water runs and drags one thousand memories
dark water runs and drags one thousand memories of mine

I cried as a real man does
I whispered feelings at a low voice
by myself in front of the fire
a quiet life, free as the flight
of a bird which gives me its welcome
'till my beard turns white
I'm still thinking of you

dark water runs and drags one thousand memories
dark water runs and drags one thousand memories of mine
