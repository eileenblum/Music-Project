In the future there will be many other situations
perhaps better occasions
but right now I have to tell you
this morning I don't feel so good

it runs like the wind
that blows, I take a rest
you've gone far away
for a long trip through times
those thoughts take and drag away,
as strong as they were
I'm yours, I lay on the ground
you've won

you bring hidden hopes to me
and play with my feelings
a rucksack full of freshness
blind eyes 'cause of a sick sun

on my body, I feel you climb
reason to breathe, join that today

on my body, I feel you climb
reason to breathe, join that today
