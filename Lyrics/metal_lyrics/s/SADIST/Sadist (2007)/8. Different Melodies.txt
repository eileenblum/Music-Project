Narrow swimming to you in the puddle of blood
around the circle, us, bathed children
you look at me, your pity investigates my ferocity
hiding, you won't be able to escape

brother, claws, you don't have, long teeth, you don't have
brother, you don't have red eyes
my tongue winds around your fear
it trembles, you won't be able to stop me now

different melodies...howls of suffering

song number one...it's the pleasure
song number two...this is the pain

pouring the tear of sorrow, I'm here
how much contempt, you fool, you bow
over the wickedness, my hand will go where the beast would not even dare, sharp as the blade

different melodies...howls of suffering

song number one...it's the pleasure
song number two...this is the pain
