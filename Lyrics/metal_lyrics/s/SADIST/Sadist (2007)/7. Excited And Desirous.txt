My vision is the road of imagination
hope to see and lift the head
of light at night...the dreadful tides
in the lake they take form and die

conquer the beast...excited and desirous

I see the river, the waters are sick
I'd like to feel what I don't want

to grant their bodies will satisfy my desire
open the mouth that waits alone
stately and strong as the bull on the mount
in the lake they take form and die

conquer the beast...excited, desirous
