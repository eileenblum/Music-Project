Livin' this fuckin' moment, as if I'm not in myself
A wall of confusion is obscuring the mind
Tearing this ling life over, and in a sudden relapse
A dhrone of illusion is much stronger than lies

Down fallen grey... down fallen grey

Fog, without you, only blind demise
Fog the grey confusion, burned by delight

Feeling an empty wonder, it happens every day
I build up a meaning that is coming from stink

Down fallen grey... down fallen grey

Fog, without you, only blind demise
Fog the grey confusion, burned by delight
Fog, without you, only blind demise
Fog the grey confusion, burned by delight
