I want it, I want it to be mine
I want to take you down, down to extasy right now
I want it now, the latest bound
I want your lust, I want your fuckin' brain

And you beyond your inner instinct
Discovering that love you had
Despite your way of thinking
No judge, no question, no regret

Come here baby... don't you touch me
My sweet baby... don't you lick me
Come here darling... don't you eat me

I must

I want it, I want it to be mine
I want to take you down, down to extasy right now
I want to see, I want to feel your luxury
I want your mania, I want your fuckin' brain

Come here baby... don't you touch me
My sweet baby... don't you lick me
Come here darling... don't you eat me

I must

Come here baby... don't you touch me
My sweet baby... don't you lick me
Come here darling... don't you eat me
Come to me
