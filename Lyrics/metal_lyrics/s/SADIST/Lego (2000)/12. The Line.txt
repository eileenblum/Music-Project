Her realized dream is your loss, in such a nightmare twisted into form
Here come the voices, you can't resist, here comes the wrath, deliverance
Mindly united but splitted, as far as shapes of cruelty
An angel dressing a stolen dress, grinding blades with happiness

When feeling emptiness within one's eyes regret,
in hybrid shapes, we turn the page
It's time for new steps... It's time for new steps...
It's time for new steps... It's time for new steps...

Her realized dream is your loss, mindly united into a cross
You cannot hide your latest step, this is the moment to react
Angels and demons looking down, they tear your flesh and make you bow
Letting your body ling in the sand, there's nothing more you can demand

When feeling emptiness within one's eyes regret,
in hybrid shapes, we turn the page
It's time for new steps... It's time for new steps...
It's time for new steps... It's time for new steps...

It's time for a resolution, grind with passion
It's time for a resolution, grind with passion

Her realized dream is your loss, in such a nightmare twisted into form
Here come the voices, you can't resist, here comes the wrath, deliverance
Mindly united but splitted, as far as shapes of cruelty
An angel dressing a stolen dress, grinding blades with happiness

When feeling emptiness within one's eyes regret,
in hybrid shapes, we turn the page
It's time for new steps... It's time for new steps...
It's time for new steps... It's time for new steps...

It's time for a resolution, grind with passion
It's time for a resolution, grind with passion
