Once upon a time into the room of pain and joy a child asleep,
an old man dealing with his cream
Once upon a time the man who own the child was getting off with him,
crashing right into the sin

Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness
Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness

Once upon a time the child who got no right abused and used
by that man who told him bunch of lies
Once upon a time there was a world of kindly words and sweet desire,
today nobody is free from liars

Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness
Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness

Old man... Baby... Magic tender fable

Once upon a time the love the man the child both drifted by the rain,
the rain that wash your lust away
Once upon a time down to the hole of pain this
was a story of a man a child who falled in love

Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness
Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness

Old man... Baby... Magic tender fable

Here, here they are, big eyes to watch,
no fear big hands to touch
Here, here they are, big eyes to watch, no fear big hands to touch

Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness
Press your flying hands with strength, no remorse,
consciousness

Old man... Baby... Magic tender fable
