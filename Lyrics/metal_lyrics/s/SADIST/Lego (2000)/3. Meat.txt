I seek life... so don't you even try to get outside my reign
You run away... no matter where you go you know you shall be mine
I will listen... to the sound of your breath
My fast claws... they switch it to the death
While your meat... it's getting harder from the suffering

Let's dance on her again and then we crash on down without a fair
Unable to delay, my pain is running plenty by this game
It's dead meat now... I will show you how...
It's dead meat now... I will have it now

My footsteps are near, I tear away and bring again
The soul flies, they are inside, meat lacerated into your brain

I seek life... so don't you even try to get outside my reign
You run away... no matter where you go you know you shall be mine
I will listen... to the sound of your breath
My fast claws... they switch it to the death
While your meat... it's getting harder from the suffering

My footsteps are near, I tear away and bring again
The soul flies, they are inside, meat lacerated into your brain
My footsteps are near, I tear away and bring again
The soul flies, they are inside, meat lacerated into your brain
