Small inside like nobody else, a turn of clock perhaps two, three, who knows
Alone in the two thousand jungle, where they race happy monkeys
Alone as other times great, alone in the white forest
Where I travel in happiness, like nobody else
Alone but I have everything, where he calls he is made to feel
Where he gives pleasure to me, alone in the green forest
My life, bring me away with you, my life, bring me away with you
In front of one thousand people, never so small, tomorrow,
ooh tomorrow, out of the crystal hull
Shut up I say, shut up I say, shut up I say,
shut up I say, small great child
Where I look at the strength that you give to me,
and I feel the air, in which you can fly free
Alone before her side, never so great, where I look at,
where I look at, where I look at
My life, bring me away with you, my life, bring me away with you

In front of one thousand people, never so small, tomorrow,
ooh tomorrow, out of the crystal hull
Shut up I say, shut up I say, shut up I say, shut up I say
Shut up I say, shut up I say, shut up I say, shut up I say, small great child
