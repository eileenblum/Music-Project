Sad I look at my room, all flies on me
Forever him, red above everything
You sit on me, I was carried to you
He knows everything, he got the secrets of doom

Close your eyes... Stranger sound... Close your eyes... Stranger sound

Sit down my friend, lay down your hands, look at this dreams,
they're flying on me

Sad I look at my room, all flies on me
Forever him, red above everything
You sit on me and I know it's the time
Never speak, just let them flyin' away

Sit down my friend, lay down your hands, look at this dreams,
they're flying on me

Sit down my friend, lay down your hands, look at this dreams,
they're flying on me
