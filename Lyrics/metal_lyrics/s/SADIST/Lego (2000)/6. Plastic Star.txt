Hit the face, she puts make up on your body,
it turns the dark on light around you, ready is the mask
She listens out to the world, it is alone for you,
red, blue, yellow, gold, you turn on the night

Look at me gentleman, I'm all warm,
pick up me gentleman, I want to feel you anywhere
Look at me gentleman, I'm all warm,
pick up me gentleman, I want to feel you anywhere

Hit the face, she puts make up on your body,
warm public still wants you, you smile to the world
With your forms your plastic life, it begins the parade,
red, blue, yellow, gold, light at night

Look at me gentleman, I'm all warm,
pick up me gentleman, I want to feel you anywhere
Look at me gentleman, I'm all warm,
pick up me gentleman, I want to feel you anywhere

My queen, you come before and towards me,
plastic star, aloft your vanity
My queen, you come before and towards me,
plastic star, aloft your vanity

You look at the sex mask,
you look at the sex mask
She listens out to the world, it is alone for you,
red, blue, yellow, gold, light at night

Look at me gentleman, I'm all warm,
pick up me gentleman, I want to feel you anywhere
Look at me gentleman, I'm all warm,
pick up me gentleman, I want to feel you anywhere

My queen, you come before and towards me,
plastic star, aloft your vanity
My queen, you come before and towards me,
plastic star, aloft your vanity

Sex mask

My queen, you come before and towards me,
plastic star, aloft your vanity
My queen, you come before and towards me,
plastic star, aloft your vanity
