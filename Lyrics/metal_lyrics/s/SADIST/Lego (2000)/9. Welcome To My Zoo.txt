I can see you like this, the way I like it to be ooh yeah
Nothing is just that exciting, do it once more please

Your hands move like this, ooh upon him
Lips on his strong skin, what blind eyes cannot see

I can see you like this, the way I like it to be ooh yeah
Nothing is just that exciting, do it once more please

Throw your lust upon the four paws beast
Go on, take it along your side, closer

Welcome, there's no return, welcome listen to the song
Welcome, there's no return, welcome listen to the song

I touch you like this, the way I want it to be ooh yeah
Nothing is just that exciting, do it once more please

My sex is dancing on you, so fast
Take it, take them, my slave, respect your master!

Welcome, there's no return, welcome listen to the song
Welcome, there's no return, welcome listen to the song

I trust, you like this, the way I like it to be ooh yeah
I trust, you like this, the way I like it to be ooh yeah... go

Welcome, there's no return, welcome listen to the song
Welcome, there's no return, welcome listen to the song

Welcome... Welcome... welcome to my zoo
