Those lives - overblow
Particles in motion
Never lost in present time
Learning through another mind

Manipulated loves
Expect reward in Paradise
To those who always feared
Above the sleeping days

Subtly twisting cultures off
Fatherly the king prologs
Your pain...
And lies you down a nailed throne

Cubing promises and minded Gods
As a higher form of life
Moulders - in faithful eyes
They suck what's coming from within

Wherever it may hurt
Just let the silence go by...confused or not
Wherever it may hurt
Confused or not

Wherever it may hurt
Just let the silence go by...confused or not
Wherever it may hurt
Confused or not
