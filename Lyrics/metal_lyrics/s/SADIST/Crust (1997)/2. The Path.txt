Surviving gotta leave it now
My greed for flesh, my cruelty
I'll let them fall down like a block
On such an empty humanity

I'm sorry friends of mine
I'm sorry for the next dawn you
won't see again
No time for raving escapes

Last stop!

With bites your stomach I chop
Your skin my claws will make fall
I love to see the muddy ground
Takin' live from your blood

Last stop!

I'm here to take you far away
Up in the north - northern than here
In such a grotesque slaughter house
You are gonna be welcome

I'm sorry friends of mine
But you have to know
There won't be any new dawn
...again, never again

Last stop!

With bites your stomach I chop
Your skin my claws will make fall
I love to see the muddy ground
Takin' live from your blood

With bites your stomach I chop
Your skin my claws will make fall
I love to see the muddy ground
Takin' live from your blood

Last stop!
Here I come
