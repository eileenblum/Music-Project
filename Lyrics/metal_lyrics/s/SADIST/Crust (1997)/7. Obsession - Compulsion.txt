Compulsion - how I'm feeling you
Raped - temporary watch
Overblowing out a tear
In which you mind lights up you fear
Filthy crust of egoism
Glowing by one's greed

...greed...

Obsession - all colors seem to fade
Everlasting hesitation - sexual defeat

...sexual-defeat...

I cut you down
And you shall bow
Can't lie to me
Denying me

Compulsion - swallowing one's grace
Masturbating safely - to reward your soul
Overlowing out a tear
In which your mind lights up your fear
Filthy crust of egoism
Glowing by one's greed

...greed...

I cut you down
And you shall bow
Can't lie to me
Denying me

I cut you down
And you shall bow
Can't lie to me
Denying me
