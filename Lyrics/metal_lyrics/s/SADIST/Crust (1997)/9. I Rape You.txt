Fawning upon you bleeding lips
In which I drink my pain
I'm boundless while I lick you up
Moulding - tasting - touching - cutting

Swallow me
Swallow me

Do I please you - do I not?
Just let me burst in you
Please let me suck your hopes
And never question why

Swallow me
Swallow me

Physically I rape you
I despise your borrowed mind
Mentally I rape you
I deny your borrowed life
I rape you
I rape you

Swallow me as I burn
Or shall I let you undermine
What I got under control
Deriving pleasure from pain

Swallow me
Swallow me

Do I please you - do I not?
Just let me burst in you
Please let me suck your hopes
And never question why

Swallow me
Swallow me

Physically I rape you
I despise your borrowed mind
Mentally I rape you
I deny your borrowed life
I rape you
I rape you
