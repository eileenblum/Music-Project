Instinctive animal - I'm gonna be the master
My sex will dominate - biding you forever
I'm gonna touch you and then I'll scorn you
Yeah, I feel it and I must have it

And as I'll look into you eyes
No easy way out
And as I'll look into your eyes
Just violence and pain

I feel it's growing stronger
Deep inside of me
Forcing me to have it all
Well, I need it and I must have it

And as I'll look into you eyes
No easy way out
And as I'll look into your eyes
Just violence and pain

All resistances are over
Your body - your soul - I dominate them
Serpents of my desire
Are crawling on your skin!

And as I'll look into you eyes
No easy way out
And as I'll look into your eyes
Just violence and pain

Now your last is asking for some more
I've gotta tell you I had enough
You really cannot have it
I am the master
