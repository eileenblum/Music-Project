The world I dream is like me
At every corner - no purity
Single perversion spreads it's command
Nothing's forbidden - nothing at all

"Flowing man's white seed
Falling leaves on animals and women
The old man - the child
Over all whores of Medina"

My world - where there are no boundaries
For love - no boundaries for pleasure
To enjoy is to live
For men and animals

River, flow free
River, flow free

"Nobody will be saved
All children and whelps - it's time to learn
Sinners within - slowly
Over all whores of Medina"

River, flow free
River, flow free
