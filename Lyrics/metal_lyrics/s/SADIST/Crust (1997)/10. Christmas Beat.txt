I open my eyes - here's a new day
I wish my hands will turn red once again
I pant for your last breath - now is the time
As my brain will call I am going to dive

Crying, shouting
Is just a dhrone  in my mind
Here's my mercy
My razor - my distress

I wanna see you naked, touch you heavily
You should be glad, I had to choose

Crying, shouting
Is just a dhrone  in my mind
Here's my mercy
My razor - my distress

I keep on following your steps
But I won't leave the dhrone
It doesn't fit within
I'm going to stop your beat

I keep on following your steps
But I won't leave the dhrone
It doesn't fit within
I'm going to stop your...

I keep on following your steps
But I won't leave the dhrone
It doesn't fit within
I'm going to stop your beat
