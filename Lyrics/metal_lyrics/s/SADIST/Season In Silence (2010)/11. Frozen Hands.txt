Blue mental mood frightened by everything that surrounds me
Mentally killed by the noise of a leaf falling on ice
Confusion in my brain it's no use stopping the thinking engine
I listen to the silence fear lives inside me

There is no salvation in the winter day
Depression I flee from the invisible fear
I'm alone and there's no response I yell
I'm cold I got dry lips and frozen hands

On the night of the branch with amputated arms
Fallen to the ground under my eyes wide open

A river runs on the grey slippery stones
It's the end of a world drowned into icy waters
The wind speaks through the trees
It's the end of a world caught in the storm

I see an army of strong soldiers proudly covered by an heavy dress
They're still motionless but ready to battle
They're with me they obey my commands

Today your dirty trick will destroy my mind
And make cry tears of sorrow and outrage
But yes I stand up with them and I'll be here
I declare war on those who do not feel sensations

A river runs on the grey slippery stones
It's the end of a world drowned into icy waters
The wind speaks through the trees
It's the end of a world caught in the storm

Blue mental mood frightened by everything that surrounds me
Mentally killed by the noise of a leaf falling on ice
Confusion in my brain it's no use stopping the thinking engine
I listen to the silence fear lives inside me

There is no salvation in the winter day
Depression I flee from the invisible fear
I'm alone and there's no response I yell
I'm cold I got dry lips and frozen hands
