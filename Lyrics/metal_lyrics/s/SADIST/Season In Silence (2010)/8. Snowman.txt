A child his bed sleeping within the warm house
The dream the emotion of tomorrow soon will be Christmas And sleeping is not easy
Snow and cold cloud the place around
The door is closed not even shadows can penetrate
All seems buried white and silent nobody walks in the holy night
Souls, men, animals
It's dark blackness in the room only the colored lights take place
Happy but frightened by the night fear of sadness monsters of the mind
It's dark!!
There's you with your dead hands
Your cylindrical hat the sadistic smile
Your eyes without pupils black
By the path of frozen buried flowers
It will be the day of reindeers and of the white bearded man
Today is the great day of reindeers of the iceman that grins and greets
Big icy man fighting against happiness
Within my horror I want you like a bloodthirsty murderer
Blood at your feet the pool expands With my thoughts I will take you to knock next door
I do not know you the snowman smiling
Lifeless when there's light immortal during the night
Fierce like the beast in the jungle
It will be the day of reindeers and of the white bearded man
Today is the great day of reindeers of the iceman that grins and greets
