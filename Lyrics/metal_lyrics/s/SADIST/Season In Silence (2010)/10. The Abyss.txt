Abyss in the deep I want to see what happens

Under the trees reflected in the days of summer
Who's afraid of the dark lake doesn't have to follow me

Dead and resurrection on the day of ice
Down there where life forms are different
They are alive reborn stealing body and soul
From the water I can hear their voices they scream and waggle

On the bottom the sand is shacked Monstrous bodies disappear
Among the rooms of an ancient wooden ruin their faces are deformed

I lent my hands to the cold and frost I look around
In the frightening winter silence no form of moving life

Only the howl of the wind through the branches
Tells anyone the ugly story of a black lake
Some swim with strength other are carried like dead
I will devour you my friend

On the bottom the sand is shacked Monstrous bodies disappear
Among the rooms of an ancient wooden ruin their faces are deformed

I feel you like ultrasound while leaving the nature of this world
I can see you carrying out a massacre

I'm sitting on the cold and wet stone and I watch you dying
Come down from heaven white light powder
And reached the mystery of the lake
