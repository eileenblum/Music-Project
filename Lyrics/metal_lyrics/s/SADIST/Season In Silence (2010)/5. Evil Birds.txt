Inside a broken mirror I see myself
I reached the peace silence hello
what's your name old man
I do not know you laughing at my eyes
But I introduce you the aggressive beast
Here comes the beast lord
Laughing eyes the omen of death
Weeping sweat on his forehead
And moving hands how many years ago
Want to eat an innocent are you thirsty blood rushing
Want to rest your tired breath die now and forever
Here comes the beast lord
Laughing eyes the omen of death
Weeping sweat on his forehead
And moving hands
I like your house in the woods there are big trees around
And fireplace smoking and the windows without glasses
Screaming is the door like an evil bird
Crying tears of ice that reached hell
My friend is so bad he killed a tender girl's mind
Cut eat your heart and wash
your sins in the pool of blood
Want to eat an innocent are you thirsty blood rushing
Want to rest your tired breath die now and forever
