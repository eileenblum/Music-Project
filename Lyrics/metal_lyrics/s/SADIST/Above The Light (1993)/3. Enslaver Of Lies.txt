Lies on your lips
Cold in my eyes
Betrayed one more time
A gaze, to the wall
Lies, no more lies

Alarm, you have arrived
The breeze in the air
Alone, I hear you
To burst into tears
Lies, no more lies

Enslaver of lies
Enslaver of lies
Enslaver of lies
Enslaver of lies

I just want to die
Listen to your words

Depression inside me
Why? That's life
