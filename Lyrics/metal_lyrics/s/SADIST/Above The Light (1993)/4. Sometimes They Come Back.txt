How many times you felt to be invincible
With your logic and your mind
How many times you have messed and destroyed
Anyone you considered inferior

How many times you have abused of your power
Against people like us
Hey dude... beware... 'cause

Sometimes they come back

Full of hate, hungry for revenge, they will want justice
They will kill power, come done from your throne

Sometimes they come back

Ingnorance... Intolerance... Suffering... War

Your presumption will choke you
Your power will rape you

Sometimes they come back
