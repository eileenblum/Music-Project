Don't cry if your life seems so empty
We have given you stadium to enjoy
If you cannot walk it's not our fault
Civilization? Walls of solitude

Eyes of hate and compassion, people are able to give
One bed is what I need in the hospital of my town
What's the meaning of life if I can't to speak to you
Imagination? Buried by desperation

So normal, in your difference
So blind, in our reality
No solution until the money
Will prevail in our minds

No solution
