Life and death
Smiles and tears
Open your eyes, feel the power now
Just stop the time and run away with me

Evil
Evil

Love and hate
Delight and pain
Against the clock must keep to ride
And day by day you'll see me right

Evil
Evil

Don't touch my life
Need to see, need to fight
Don't touch my faith
Cannot win, cannot cry

Reflection of soul
Passion and fear
Indifference is near
Reaction of spirit
Take my goal
Take my way

Love and cries
Happiness and sorrow
Open your eyes, feel the power now
Just stop the time and run away with me

Evil
