Hell...

Strange visions into my mind
Suffering of a life without sense
Screams rebound in my void
Life in the limbo of unreal
Hell in myself is burning my brain again
...Why? ...again?

Who wants to destroy our hopes?
Who wants to control our thoughts?

Hell...

Madness is entering my soul
I can't escape from this trap
Claustrophoby of existence
Cage of power close my eyes

I'm alone against my breath

Silence breaks in the air,
Lights tell me I'm alive
Fear to live, no fear to die...
But if the sun should die?
