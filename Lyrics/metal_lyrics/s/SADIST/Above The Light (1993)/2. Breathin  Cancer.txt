People born to work
People born to die
Metropolis of smog
Metropolis of death
Livin' for the clock
Runnin' to the clock
Industriality... that's society

Hate rage and death
Hate rage and death

People born to work
People born to die
Metropolis of smog
Metropolis of death
Livin' for the clock
Runnin' to the clock
Industriality... that's society

Hate rage and death
Hate rage and death

Breathin' toxic... breathin' nuclear
Breathin' cancer... breathin' what?
Death...
Death...

Where is the sky?
Where is the sun?
I wanna escape... intoxication

Society, for consumism
Society... revolution

Breathin' your progress
We will die

Hate rage and death
Hate rage and...
Death
