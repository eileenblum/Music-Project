Searching path knowledge
Nothing but fear remains
Walking thru' nonsense
Where noone dares
Clutching reality, naked divinity
Escogido

To reach nowhere, a shadow
A step away from my left side
She follows me while she 's waiting
Where have you gone
Rationality and all my tidy
Thoughts?

Snare of emotions
Something's trying to get free
Something's trying to get free
Kicking out from my heart!

Escogido and afraid
How can my first enemy
Sweep away everything...like this?

[REPEAT 1st VERSE]

A way wiped out like this
Defiled warrior in an unknown land
Made out of dark presence&amp;feelings
A faultless path, and that fuckin fear
In front and all around me
