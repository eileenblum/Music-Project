Here they are again
Taken by an icy wind
They gently take place beside me

Winter days...once again
Winter nights...as it's always been
Winter days...this my time
Winter nights...as it's always been

Feel the cold, see the frost
Forgotten in my brain
Can you see the winter ghost?
Coming thru' the rain

Winter![X2]

Here they are again
Eager for my essence
Warriors, bearers of peace
Sinners and saints dressed in innocence

Winter days...this my time
Winter nights...let'em come to me
Winter days...once again
Winter nights...let'em come to me

[REPEAT 1st VERSE]

I am so scared
There's no disguise!

The spiral of winter
Do you think it's enough
To close a door?
The spiral of winter
To leave behind what is now!

Winter![X2]
