Last day
You can feel it coming
The liberating singing
This ever - waited moment
First and last scream
Surrounded by an icy earthquake
Of a nature sick of
Your challenge longing

Ragnarok...it's the day!
Ragnarok...now I know!

Rage is not enough
Hate is not enough
Fellings chained from the begining
What has been...
Nothing more matters

Winning is not enough
Killing is not enough
A triumph that erases all
Bleeding universe
Back to a silent nothingness
Shapeless chaos...while now...

Ragnarok...what a day!
Ragnarok..."finally has come"

...Everything burns!
