Finally close your eyes, body sinks
Increasing strenght of fantasy
Find yourself where
You don't want to be
Trapped in a net of images
Life and death explosion
Where you don't want to be

Icy roar of muddy waters
Steals your last breath

There's no way back
An endless search
Thirst for living, feed suffering
To come to nothing, nothing at all
In absolute, eternal pain

Body swept away by rapids
You can't command it anymore
It's dark on your soul
There's no way back
It's dark on your mind
There's no way back

Death calls...rebirth
Soul strenght blessed
In pain you feed
While I learn, to come to nothing

[REPEAT 1st VERSE]
