Peeing in the pool
A harsh way of a self-express
Screaming loud
That your art is the best

You got jailed when you were born
Live in a square world
Meet square people, eat square food
Oh, good!

And again one day
You feel fed with that bore
And want to brake free!
Let me do my piss thing!
Hey people!
Letâs roll down the street!

Stop the law and start the outlaw
Tear down the old world
Letâs rock and roll for the sake of our kind
Donât be a pussy! Burst out some chords!
