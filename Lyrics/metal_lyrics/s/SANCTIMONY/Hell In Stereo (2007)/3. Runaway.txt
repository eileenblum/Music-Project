You got me sucking on my thumb
You fed me pills of lost
You can hear them come, here they come
Riding through the solid wall

Iâve been flying many times
Iâve been oozing out of life
Gently stroking my own hair
I wish I could hug myself

Donât wanna go your way
No more accidents at all
The heroes forced on me
I take them on their final walk

Iâm a runaway for life
Getting a new glorious taste
Am I a shadow or a ghost?
Iâve got nothing to hide

Hey, me! Stop holding me down
Raise my eyebrows then hands
Take a step then a second one
Put myself in a state of fly
