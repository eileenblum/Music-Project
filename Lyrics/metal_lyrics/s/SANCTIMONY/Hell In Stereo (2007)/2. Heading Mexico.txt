Iâm riding a dirty truck made by Ford
Itâs fast though heavy as itâs loaded with booze
Heading fast to the hidden side road I know
I cut the lights and go on in the dark

Truckload of stolen booze
Thatâs the shit Iâm in
The plan was great but it didnât go that well
Damn man! Weâll all go to hell!

Faster, faster! No time at all.
Iâll hide the stuff and leave the town
If gangâs gonna get me... man!
Iâm dead â killed by Al himself
(Iâll be killed)

Leave the home, city, state.
Forget the country of U.S. of A.
Mexico Iâm embracing you, now
Sweet home has changed its place
