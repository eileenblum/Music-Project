Heart beating backwards
Iâve lost my sense for danger
Where am I running?
Who is this running?

Fast lane king of speed
Burning rubber, thatâs a need.
The lights turn black
But Iâm glowing as a bulb
In the seat of a smoking wreck

Turn me on,
Then switch me off
Iâm in your hands
I am your handy toy

On the run. Get a kick in the nuts.
Have some fun! Get yourself crashed.
On the run. Canât hold me back?
You turn me on. Turn me on! Come on!
