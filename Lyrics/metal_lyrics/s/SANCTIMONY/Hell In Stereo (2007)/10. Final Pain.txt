No, I do not believe myself
Nor do I trust your truth
To draw the curtains close
To shut the dreaming mouth

Thatâs the final pain
Pull-push the drug in vein
Stare... stare and retreat
Drifting away from the light

Betrayed my life
All the dreams and expectations
Jam-packed pleasure
It shoots me through the roof

No, I do not have the faith
A future day would be a disgrace
Seal the box and feed it into fire...
Swallowed by the flame of desire

Slow motion towards a conscious defeat
Intended and cherished in mind
Sucked and pumped throughout the life
No faith to carry on
