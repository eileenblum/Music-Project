Pulling the life to extremes
Control to control for no goal
Sedate and keep him close for all times
That child you have inside

Die, hell die
Beat down the hatred with lie
Though you know that others donât care
You have to have the biggest share

Unfold the truth and let those children be
Make those handy monsters flee
I free my mind...
For thereâs been light

Die, hell die
Beat down the hatred with lie
We choose to not know
And the pay day will come

Show the whole world your line
Step up the pedestal and shine
Though youâre suspicious that others donât care
You have to have the biggest share

Whoâs upon the throne for whom?
