I am a black- tied president of hell
Thatâs the scum plant I want to sell
I shall retire Iâve had enough
The process has been put on halt

Depressed leader
The world doesnât need
Cause it craves for better days
For faster cars and cheaper beer

They name me lord
What a foolish thought...
I just had the guts to go my way

They name me evil
What a loose opinion...
I just didnât want to kiss no ass

Iâm out of heaven â Iâm out of hell
Stand between two grinding stones

Yeah! Iâve pulled the plug
The worshiped hell runs no more
My die-hard fans hate me
The blessed ones still despise me

Devil â he does what he believes is right
