Here, come inside this merry tent
And ask for pleasure on money spent
You get everything painfully nice
Though mere watching costs twice

Hear those screams behind the cloth
Thereâs a birth of a new person close
Brake through to a blissful life
Welcome! Enjoy some ferocious night

We serve salt for wounds to pulse
We offer blinding pain... no nurse
We give you pleasure beyond belief
We make you a better man to be

Donât you want to love your life
To feel the bliss instead of a knife?
Want to see the greatness of a day
Enjoy music not havoc and dismay?

Here, come inside this merry tent
And ask for pleasure on money spent
You get everything painfully nice
Itâs guaranteed! No rolling of dice
