I can see the people of night
As I am standing near the light
Pain control and a sip of booze
I will wait till the minute I choose

So I wait and the cigarette is lit
Red glow on my right hand finger tips
Smell of burn and a bitter twist
I sip again and drown in mist

Zone out, zone out in drowsiness
Entrance on my shaded holiness
Find the ways to find me desired
Find the ways to dismiss others hired

I came from the people of night
They have sent me to ask 'bout life
Havenât they grasped the saying of grass
Being greener on the other side?

Now, looking from the other side
I work towards the moment of choice
Should the starving demons feed
Or should I feed upon their meat...
