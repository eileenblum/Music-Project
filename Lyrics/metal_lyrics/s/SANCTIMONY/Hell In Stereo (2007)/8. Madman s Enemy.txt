Is this a friend or an enemy?
The crazy person that stares at me
Oh, silver mirror thou shall see
Is this my friend or the enemy?

At the moment you blink
The madman kicks in
I like to push my pusher hard
Wonât get puzzled as I might be him

OK, don't be scared
Keep your head up when we meet
My meat lies deep within
I fume and fret... fume and fret

You are my friend and enemy
And silver halo pours out of me
You might dip your finger into my energy
But I brought my light as sanctity

Crash in red - now weâre a family
Fall and rise, slip and despise
This nice shellâs too much of dis-ease
Yeah, yeah â I invented demise

And I am laced with gold
Now Iâm on my own
I walk this light and bring the dark
Later Iâll come to get our vim
