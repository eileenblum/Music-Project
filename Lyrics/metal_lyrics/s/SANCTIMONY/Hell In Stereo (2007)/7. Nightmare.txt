Stupid and smiling faces around
Lifeâs so nice, everythingâs cool
Sun is shining and rainâs refreshing
Everythingâs well, it canât get better

Everyoneâs brother or sister or friend
Snacks are floating in the rivers of beer
You can build houses from promises only
Everythingâs well, it canât get better

It lasts for a while then friend becomes a dick
Mates and pals still busy with beer
Things once started â now unfinished works
Everythingâs fine still nothing happens

I awake all sweated, what the hell!?
That was just a nightmare, thanks Lord
Stupid and smiling faces around
Everythingâs cool, everythingâs fine
