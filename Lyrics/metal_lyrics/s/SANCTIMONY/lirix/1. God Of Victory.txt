Breath fear while watching the flames
By not believing God believe yourself
Breath fear while watching the skies
By not believing God believe in victory

No God in the skies
No God in the church
No God in the Bible
God is you

Brake down the crosses, the gates of your jail
Don't listen to angels weeping in sorrow
Wade through the slash of belief
Rising over faithfuls half-assed minds

No God in the skies
No God in the church
No God in the Bible
God is in victory upon yourself
