Dead thougts are wondering lonely
The empty starless sky
Darkness as morass sucking in
Dawn yet so far...
A moment to consider what happens arround
Hearing desperate, hollow dark
One comes into the world, for some it's time to pass
Morning won't come soon...
Maybe time has stopped
Maybe stars are extinct
Maybe morn is never to come
Maybe that's the best
Dead thoughts are wondering lonely
The empty lightless world
So horrid the dark
Lights yet so far
