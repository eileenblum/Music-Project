Sorrow like gardens of stone
Thoughts - more to wish for, more to hope
Left only one - the sense
Wild horses and meadows
Sorrow like faith
Faith to believe not in sorrow
Strain to understand
Efforts of sense
Sorrow like ice
Everything in and away
To love and to teach
Sorrow like hands
Giving no warmth to yours
Here take mine
Hands and the sun.
