The morning sun creates the Earth and the sea
All the silhouettes from the shadow are divided
The dream and the unknown in the darkness are sent
And the dark side of heaven is seen
There's only a word in a silence like the light in a darkness
Only in death there is life like true lies
Save us lord from sin
What is done in religions pressure

History's reflection of gods will
It between all the holy wars
Gods are as many as lies
But the truth is only one...
...And it is the sun
