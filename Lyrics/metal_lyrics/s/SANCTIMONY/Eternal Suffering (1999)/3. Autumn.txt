Fire burns down
Like in a dying scream
Flashes up brighter-
Another autumn enters the life
Without fire
Bring winds and vain
And Velins come in the evening
To look in the windows
How am I living or suffering
When the sky is dark, no breenk is seen
All dreams have flew so far away

Everything's so far, everything's away
Lame blackbird is all that's left
To pass away in wind
