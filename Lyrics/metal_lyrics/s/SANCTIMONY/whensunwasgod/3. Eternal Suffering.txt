Storm comes from heaven rumbling and crashing
Doomsday choir of angels is heard
Horrible spirits attack the king from all sides
Evil world sucks blood from his flesh
Lord terribly moans, but voice is lost in the storm
Endless rage and despair takes his soul
Fiery bolts comes out from the blood-filled eyes
Heads of the enemies fall from his sword in dark abyss
Taking revenge on blood, like in ancient times
Night approaches everlasting
And darkness rules the land
