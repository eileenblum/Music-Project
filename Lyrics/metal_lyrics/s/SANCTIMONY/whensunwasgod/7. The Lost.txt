In the sunbeams shining
Over fields trundle the ghosts
Bound in the bright iron
They carried truth on the crosses
Uninvited and unexpected
They opened all the gates
Strength and war ruse are brothers them
And bloodthirsty smile of superiority, too
Propagating something unknown
They shot the children of forest with arrows
With assistance of swiche and chains
They built castles of stone between the oaks
Fire made ashes from woods
Skies lost the sun
Stones hid under mosses
The blood it's our tears
Spirits of wood went to another wood
The clevers learnt to hide
Faith dressed into clothes
Hiding itself in ornaments and in laces
Rivers may find the sea
Winds know where to run
May the lost to live? There's silence in the forest, nobody can feel it

Sanctimony is:
Janis - voice
Viesturs - guitar
Janis - guitar
Viktors - bass
Karlis - drums
