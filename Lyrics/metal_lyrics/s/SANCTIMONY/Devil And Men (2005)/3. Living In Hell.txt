The master's apprentice I've been
For a dozen of years now
Have learned all the dos and don'ts
And the secret of adored hell
Well, hell is not a place where you can smile
And for sure you're gonna meet a friend of mine
Old Nick will treat you well
He'll keep you warm and give some space to dwell

Living in hell
We were living in hell
Our flaming daddy did well
I don't know... did we feel well?

I came so far
Now I'm standing down here on the crossroads
Left my hellish life back
I'm looking for the right way out
So damn far away from my home
Without any shelter in this blurred mind
On the crossroads
Starting all over and over again
