I'm gonna be the greatest
Just don't ask me why
I can eat the fire
Run and catch and fly
I'm the super hero
I guess I'll never die
And if you really want me
Then try me baby, try

Million miles to nowhere
I'm gonna fly around
Till I've got this feeling
I may sit back on the ground
Hey, pretty baby, look at me
As a star I'm coming down
I have come to get you
And explode with metal sound

And baby just remember
I'm not one of your toys
I just want to get you
With this metal noise
