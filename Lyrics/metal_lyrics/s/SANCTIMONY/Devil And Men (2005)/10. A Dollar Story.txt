Give me a dollar
I'll tell you your future
A fortune teller
Would never tell a lie

Till the morning light you are done
And your deeds won't be the fine ones
Till the morning light reveals your face
Better get some nice disguise

You strain the law, you pull the trigger
Two lawmen fall, your gun saves your life
And the bag with gold will score you out
But they won't find the man in disguise

Give me a dollar
I would never lie
Till the morning light
Riches are gonna get you

Till the morning light
Till the morning light
