Gone! When I'll be gone
You may kill my dog - kill my son
Your face, your stupid eyes say all
I know you hate me. That's all.

Gone! When I'll be gone
You are to lose your fun
Your crazy show shall close
I might name it the fine end.

Oh, Lord! Come set my mother free!
That's not her fate or point to reach!
Oh, holy Lord! Come get us clear!

The order of things is here to stay
No drunk nor junkie's gonna leave
Come make my mama clean
This is the order of come and leave
