Come on, you're gonna be mine
Yeah... I am of that kind
On my face will be your smile
You always set me high

Yeah...
We've got so many freaks in our world
One message I'll send
And you know - that's not the end!

You're my dream, you're my satisfaction
Go, go - always like that
Yeah, yeah! Now that's forever
We gotta be together

Hey, baby, I've got something to tell
I will always like your smell
And if we talk about sex
I will never be your ex
