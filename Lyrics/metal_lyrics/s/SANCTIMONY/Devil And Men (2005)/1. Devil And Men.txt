I'll burn your forests, spoil your ground
Drain all the waters to be found
Just then I'll reach to grab your soul
And you will ask me who I am

What can I say?
I came from hell
This world to sell

I see you people know what's fun
You turn your planet into dump
Men slay each other, chop apart
You lay your highways straight to hell

What can I say?
You know the way
Straight to hell

Those severe ways we go... hand in hand
Straight to hell
Devil and men
Hand in hand
