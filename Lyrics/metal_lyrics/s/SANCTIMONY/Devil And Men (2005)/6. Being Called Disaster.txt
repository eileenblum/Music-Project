Dark rebel night
No light in the sky
I grab my guns
And start the engine

Night rules, freedom taste
Wild and craving heart
And you blast everything for
Ideal nothing

Through the city on the run
Crash, blast, fight and fun
Got the people down?
Got them scream and shout!

Fear, fear, fear!
It's my air
And I demand it!
And I get it!

Here I come, fast as hell
My beast and I - we are as one
I won't think before and never after
The instincts lead to damage done

I've got my guns
And my monster hotrod car
I've got my fun to hunger for
I'm being called disaster
