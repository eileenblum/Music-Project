In the shadow of light
A shout at the top of your throat
A shot, birds fly over fields and sounds

But the time has come
And it doesn't matter -
Is there someone who will scream
Or has already screamed
Is snow white or it only appears

I like soil just ploughed
Snow just falling
It seams all will be better tomorrow
A shot, birds fly over fields and sounds

Just infinity around
There's nothing but everything
I'm breathing so deeply
There somewhere over me
Red light arise
