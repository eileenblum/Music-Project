I beckon to the souls of the desperate 
Gather your energies within the forgotten depths 
In the catacombs beneath unhallowed ground 
The Faceless shall now look upon you 
And none shall hinder your descent 
To the buried temple of the Old Gods, waiting to be found. 

Glimpse beyond the limited mortal perceptionsâ¦ 
To the nightmare that encircles the blind senses 
Unfathomed, the chaos of Astral conception 
As one we shatter the Elder Signâs defenses. 

Transmutation of reality in purest formâ¦ 
Whispers of madness undulate and resound from the Obeliskâ¦ 

Pantheons have fallen to appease this hunger 
So too must worlds fall as well 
Renounce your beliefs in the Great Ones at lastâ¦ 
The Nameless shall now be exhorted 
And none shall prevent their ascent 
To pick apart mankind in grisly repast.
