The Madness festersâ¦ more potent than ever before
Ancestorsâ¦ those I once adored
Bear witness to their sons!

The blasphemies I beheldâ¦the soil in which I dwell
The cradle burns as tinder to this Hell
And still they are blind to what they have doneâ¦

Once my fecundity was wisdom
But soon only tears filled my glade
Serenity no longer binds me
Iâve sprouted a cancer of blades.

Too long I have sleptâ¦dreaming of better days
Too long I have weptâ¦ while the world fell to decay

The blasphemies I beholdâ¦ False Gods poised to consume
An ocean of frozen souls â an eldritch doom

The earth pines for a Panacea to its misery.
All Mortals must perish before the prophecies come to beâ¦

This is your fate.
