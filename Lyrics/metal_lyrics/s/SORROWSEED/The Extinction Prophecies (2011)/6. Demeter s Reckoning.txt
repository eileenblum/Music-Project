Once upon a timeâ¦
When I seeped with wisdom
Nestled deep in your earth
Nurturing mankind from its birth
Your weeds have borne steel
And I weep for your hunger
As your forces grow stronger
It is I who remember your crimesâ¦

Ignorantâ¦
To the blasted fields and wilted air
Complacentâ¦
To a fallen future and a fate laid bare
And you would gouge your own Mother from within
To beget dust and skeletons.
I watch you betray yourselvesâ¦
And She is too withered to care.

Once upon a timeâ¦
They beseeched me for guidance
Groveled on their knees
For the wisdom of trees
Now I reap their disease!
Their pitiful defiance
These dregs of science
In sorrow and hatred entwinedâ¦

Decrepit crops unsought by mankind
Scarecrows laid bare for the starving soil.
You would choke willingly upon your Motherâs ashes
And rue in millennia of Reckoning
