It is a merciful blight to bring about their end 
For even vermin would not envy the world they have designed 
A Golden Age where men have become as herd beasts 
Festering meat bound in madness, side by side. 

Ignorance prevails, and they breed like insects 
A virus infecting the world 
Civilization spawned species of glutton 
Alone and weak, they prayâ¦ 

The Golden Plague of mankind 
Has stood firm for too long 
Their gods have fallen, 
And Oblivion shall swallow them whole in timeâ¦ 
(The time is now 
and the astral storm hungers for fleshâ¦) 

Wastelandâ¦scavenging souls 
We bring the cleansing pestilence 
They cower in terror beneath darkened skies 
As we converge upon our preyâ¦ 

I AM NO LONGER ONE OF YOU!
