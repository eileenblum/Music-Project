Millenia of systematic slaughter 
Bodies populating the outer crust of the scorched earth 
Cremation crusades sprayed ashes unto the water 
Tormented soldiers dread rebirth. 

Deliverance is a fragile dream 
The comfort of a fool 
Behemoths pull the war machines 
Lit by a molten core 
The mortal man is cruel 
With merciless designs for nevermore 
A self-contained genocide 
To condemn the slain to the other sideâ¦ 

Cosmic eyes watch with eternal patience 
The war to feed the ancients. 

The illusion of peace prevails 
A mask of sanity for a dying species 
Artillery fire rips through the veil 
Serrated blades draw blood to rid the disease. 

With each mortal shell that crumbles away 
One more soul is released 
Uncounted scores of fallen prey 
Languish at the gates of oblivion 
Outer gods and their servitors 
Prepare for a stygian feast 
The festering fabric of reality will split with a gaping incision.
