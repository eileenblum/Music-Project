Darkness descends from the firmament
Shredding winds sever the lifelines
Unbound in torment â these victims of sentience
They mourn the scattered fragments of their designs.

These are the remnants of a fragile civilization
Terror takes the reins in the fate of the stormâs manifestation.

Oh, see them wither in the wake of a carrion rain
Worms erupt from the soul to lay claim to the grains.

Corrosive waters fall to drown the vermin
Mortals perish alone in rusted enclosures
Sinking â the undertow begins
Such fallible creatures cannot hope to endure.

The stentorian call of thunder
Awakens me to the true nightmare
Cyclones harrow through the headstonesâ
Sundered cityscapes in despair

Long ago, they prayed to Her
To guard crops from malignant swarms
Now, wreathed in a cloud of locusts
I watch the defilers waste away in the famine storm.
The famine stormâ¦
