Born from the ancient void 
Spiritual Dementia 
Called by congregation 
Blinded by faith. 

Reverence and destruction 
Strife and mass production 
Bred for mass consumption 
The perfect raceâ¦ 

We are the ones to whom you have pledged yourselves 
Devotion to satiate an Eldritch Hunger! 
Prophecies foretell of the poison in the wishing well 
We manifest to rend the future asunderâ¦ 
(Born into flesh at last â The feast is at hand!) 

Ohâ¦and still they come 
Seeking answers to their fate 
At the mercy of the Circleâ¦ 
Hopelessâ¦and still they come 
Laying down their lives 
Willing to fight for nothing! 

Incursionâ¦ this world shall tremble and fall 
Just as all of the others beforeâ¦ 
I speak for the myriad maws and the flesh of the gods. 

Behold! Oblivion unfolds 
The howling throat of the vortex 
Brings the end to this ignorant age 
This is your fate.
