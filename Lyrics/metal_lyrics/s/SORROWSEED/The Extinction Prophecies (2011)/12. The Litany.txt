Once among the mortal men 
Now I traverse the realms beyond 
The material plane is but a crossroads 
The epicenter of a temporal abyss. 

Anchored by the webs of stasis 
Made brittle through the ignorant years 
At long last, I find passage 
To elucidate with chaos and fear. 

Once among the mortals, I elected to ascend 
To seek the truth and the answers 
At whatever the cost or end 

Now, beyond all sanity, Iâve come to realize 
That the aegis of morality 
Is just a seal of lies. 

Once abjured by the Great Ones, imprisoned and obscured 
Now driven by an eldritch hunger 
No longer interredâ¦ 

There is no natural cycle; no afterlife awaits 
The universe is ruled by mindless gods 
And you shall see themâ¦ when we emerge from the gates
