Surely they must know that the end is near
The locusts breed, infesting eyes and ears

Civilization lies in ruin beneath a cold sun
The tempest has torn through the world
And my harvest time has come.

Starvation is your fate
Your ignorance prevailed, and now itâs too late.
One last sacrifice for a withered womb
Her body shall be your tomb.

Extinction is on the rise
An offeringâ¦before the whole world dies.
One last genocide upon the Willowâs Edge
Upon the Willowâs Edgeâ¦

Come ever closer and be purified
Absolution is obtained through suicide.

Expiation to feed the fields
Coffins forged in factories of steel
(Your) senses too deadened to feel the pain I feelâ¦

My Harvest Time has comeâ¦
The world will come undoneâ¦
The reaping has begunâ¦
One last offering â let it be done!
So aloneâ¦ in my bleak eternity
So aloneâ¦ I must find serenity.

Itâs the end of all their dreams
They never heard their Motherâs screams
I bring an exit from this world, so obscene
As I reap this Sorrow Seed!

I grant the release from their sufferingâ¦ the suffering of ignorance.
I bring them back to the soilâ¦ back to innocenceâ¦

So aloneâ¦ in my bleak eternity
So aloneâ¦ There is no serenity
