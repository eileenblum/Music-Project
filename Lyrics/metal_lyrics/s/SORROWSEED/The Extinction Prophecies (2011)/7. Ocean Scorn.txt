Bathed in brine, drowned by time
A place where the titans submerged
Downtrodden seas, home to scores of debris
Where Motherâs nightmares converged.

Choked upon salt, embalmed in silt
Erosion gnaws at the shores
A maelstrom of tears where all hope disappears
Horrors from the gulfs belowâ¦

Sediment in the wind, corruption within
Vessels will sail to their deaths
Painted by oil, the wellspring despoiled
Devouring denizens of the depths.

When the waters reject your tongues
The famine will be complete
I will drink your remorse as your bones feed the shores
To nourish my cancerous roots and replenish the seedâ¦
