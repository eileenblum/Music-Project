Upon the carcass of the old god
We gather where the dread shadows walk.
We distort the wills of weak drones
Cathedrals built from the bones of the flock
Reapers stalk the charnel chantry
Where the wretched pray to the void
The championâs sunken eyes sewn shut
The Apostle Thrall is deployed.

[Chorus:]
Bow before the herald of despair
Evangelical deterioration
Follow and submit to the new conviction
Bound forever in eternal salvation.

Believe in the messenger of the blight
This scripture scarred upon the husk
The words speak of cataclysms to come
The extinctions and the storms of dust
The raw power sealed within
The blind eyes of the emissary Â 
Will be released upon the death of centuries
Your subversion is necessary.

[Repeat chorus]
