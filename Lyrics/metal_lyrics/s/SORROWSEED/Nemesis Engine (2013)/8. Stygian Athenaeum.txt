Enter into the forbidden realms of dire enlightenment
The tomes and scrolls sealed away by the ascendant gods
To stand upon the precipice of lore and derangement
Pierce through the barriers to the Athenaeum's facade.

[Chorus:]
Tendrils of elder monstrosities
Slither throughout this sanctum
Unearthly luminosity
Reveals the secrets beneath the stygian shroud.

Here, I peruse every codex, grimoire, and lexicon
That darkness itself condemned to obscurity
Malignant stars, astral horrors, and abyssal maelstroms
I reap the wisdom to arm against these threats and impurities.

[Repeat chorus]

I shall not suffer the visions of demented prophets
No dreaded gods or demons will deter my fate
I will reforge this world as a weapon of grand design
From the Stygian Athenaeum, I stand poised to annihilate.
