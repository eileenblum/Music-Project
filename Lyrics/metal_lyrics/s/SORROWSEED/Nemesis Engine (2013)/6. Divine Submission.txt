Crawl across the floor
Bound by shackles and leather hood
Approach slowly to your Goddess,
Seated on Her feathered Throne

Kneeling at My feet; encased in black sheaths of ecstasy
Fulfill your deepest desire to submit to Me

slave, drone, worm!

[Chorus]
you are nothing but scum
A worthless drone - a slave at My disposal
youâre here to be of service, and nothing more
your soul belongs to Me now
Forevermore

Slice your skin with sharpened heel
Blood flows forth to feed My hunger
your screaming heard throughout My chambers
your pain is My eternal pleasure

[Repeat chorus]

Filth, sloth, dog!

Return now to this steel cage, and take your place with the rest of My minions
your only purpose here is to please your Queen
Itâs what youâve always wanted in your darkest dreams

Kneeling at My feet; encased in black sheaths of ecstasy
Fulfill your deepest desire to submit to Me

Scum, waste, rat!

[Repeat chorus]
