(The stygian battery is primed to extinguishâ¦)
Artillery contrived through the pulse of the spirits
Claimed within the umbral webs
The coffin shells creep slowly across the battlefields
Bearing the noxious ammunition of incorporeal dead.

[Chorus:]
The art of virulent ballistics â the unseen hunger of dread phantoms
Eternal nightmares of the unfulfilled now fired in salvos as one.
Repurposed for siege and extinction â apparitions in untold supplies.
They echo the death of centuries as they disperse and bring your demise.

We harvest the wretched wastes of infinite despair Â 
The endless winds of the gray, dismal fields
The eidolons that wander in blind, quivering masses
Ensnared in recruitment to fuel the munitions we wield.

[Repeat chorus]

Destruction shall fall upon organic life
To feed the hunger of ravenous, spectral husks
The ordnance pervades through all resistance
Carrion cannons bring lethal release from existence.
