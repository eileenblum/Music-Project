Feeding the machine
Driven by morbid avarice
(your) weakness and fear
Replaced with valor for your Queen

It is with pleasure I extract your beating heart
your cowardice proves your inadequacy!
I consume your young and supple flesh
And your weak mind
your pleads of mercy echo through My courtyard

your pathetic soul
Joins the rest of My army!

[Chorus]
Feed the nemesis engine
your fragile minds replaced
With steel and fire
Weak and useless forms have been repurposed
The world has fallen to My power

Feeding the machine
Driven by morbid avarice
(your) weakness and fear
Replaced with valor for your Queen

In this plane of nightmare
your eternity is Mine to decide
Now, meet your gruesome fate!
Incineration as the cleansing process
This hungry earth engulfs you whole

Invictus; unconquered
Unmatched in sovereignty

[Repeat chorus]

your pathetic soul
Joins the rest of My army!

Fueling the Nemesis Engine
your obsolete minds
Replaced with steel and fire
Weak and useless forms have been repurposed
The world has fallen to My power
