Thanatotic designs upon the blacksmithâs altar
Enhanced implements of annihilation; fallen infantry equipped for war.

Behold: the Sepulcher Legionnaires! Â The frontline corps; the vile vanguard
Baneful eyes gleam in the darkness to hunt the living, mortal dissidents
Regiments crawl forth from the crypts to be recruited from near and far
Rituals of strength and binding cast upon their armaments

[Chorus:]
No mercy, no rest for superior soldiers
Desolation follows where they tread.
Dispatched to march against the world
These are the tactics of the dead.

Necromantic refineries produce the weaponry
Golems work the ebony ingots to carry out the killing decree.

Tremble before the Legionnaires â compelled to ravage and slay
Cannons fire upon the walls of the weak, dismal nations
To ensure their allegiance, they must perish and be made to obey
Through military might, the foundation is set for advanced creations.

[Repeat chorus]
