I got no illusions
I make no excuses
I mean what I say
When I say it
Now can you connect
When you're so damn correct?
Why are you wasting time
Why don't you say what's on you mind 

What's on you mind
What's on you mind
What's on you mind
What's on you mind 

Mind your manners, don't make waves
Don't want to hear what I say
Sure, I've got regret
That I can't forget
I'm just a human being
Not some straight-edge machine
You're to scared to speak
Or just to weak 

What's on you mind
What's on you mind
What's on you mind
What's on you mind 

Wasted - fucked up
Beat down - shut up
Screaming - Inside
Speak up - Time's out
