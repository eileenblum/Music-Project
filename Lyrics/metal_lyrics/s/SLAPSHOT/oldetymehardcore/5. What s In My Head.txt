I see you smile and I can't say a thing
Could we be friends but you don't call me
Might see you out somewhere but it's like I'm not there
I said I'd never do this again 

It's in my heart and in my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
It's in my heart and in my head 

It's in my heart and in my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
It's in my heart and in my head 

I just can't do this anymore
But you wouldn't stop till you evened the score
Dragged down, and laid to waste
So much hurt but here I wait 

It's in my heart and in my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
It's in my heart and in my head 

It's in my heart and in my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
It's in my heart and in my head 

There you are 3000 miles away
I only hope, I'll be there someday
Do you think you can wait for me?
Now I come back to reality 

It's in my heart and in my head
It's in my heart and in my head
It's in my heart and in my head
It's in my head
