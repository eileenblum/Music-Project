Think I'm joking about your smoking
Think it's fair to steal my air
You you you you you take my breath away
Don't cry freedom cause you've stolen mine
Smoke filled rooms make me blind
You you you you you take my breath away.
Leave odor on my clothes
Spread your venom up my nose
You you you you you take my breath away.
Right to smoke in it's place
Far away from anyone's face
You you you you you get it away.
Did you ask if I minded
For my eyes to be blinded
Make my lungs black
From your smoke attack
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare steal my air cause I care
