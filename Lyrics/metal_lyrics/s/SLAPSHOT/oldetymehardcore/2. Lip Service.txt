Peace in the pit, what a load of shit
They'll never get their shit together
Instead of unity only out for themselves 

Back on the map is a fucking joke
Since you came on the scene
You're so Hardcore, you're from the streets
I wish you would leave
Who give a fuck if you came from the hard side of town
'Cause all I see with your bullshit
Is you drag all you see down 

Lip service is all I hear
And nothing is ever made clear
Threats are made and blame is placed
Judgement drawn with no credibility 

Back on the map is a fucking joke
Since you came on the scene
You're so Hardcore, you're from the streets
I wish you would leave
Who give a fuck if you came from the hard side of town 

'Cause all I see with your bullshit
Is you drag all you see down 

Go ahead put the blame on me
You'll be O.K.? We'll just wait and see 

Go ahead put the blame on me
We'll just wait and see
