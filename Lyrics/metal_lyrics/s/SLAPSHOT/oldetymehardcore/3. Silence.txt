I want to know, what do you believe
I want to say but can I speak my mind
But you're gonna leave no matter what I say
Could you be real for once in your life 

Silence - is the weapon you use on me
Silence - I never take my own advice
Silence - should have gotten out when I could
Silence - and now I pay the price 

I want to know when did you have the time
I want to know does the punishment fit the crime
I'd like a chance but the plea has been denied
Break the silence there's no turning back 

Silence - is the weapon you use on me
Silence - another page in your history
Silence - did I have a chance
Silence - or was it made for me 

Once again, love takes a turn for the worst
I'll be O.K. it isn't the first
She just decided she'd rather be friends
That's O.K. I'll just do it again and again and again
