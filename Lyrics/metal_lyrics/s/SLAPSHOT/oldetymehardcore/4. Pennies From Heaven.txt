I don't seek god or inner peace
I won't chant prayers but I eat meat
Don't ask you to think like me
But I'm more straight-edge than you'll ever be 

Pennies from heaven is all they want to see
And all this religion is spreading like a fucking disease
Used up all the others now they're using the Hardcore scene
Hear the lies so often they've lost touch with reality 

I don't care if you want to get fucked up
I'll still call you my friend
And if someone claim they've got an answer
I'll tell you how it ends 

Say your prayers it's time for sleep
Kneel down with the other sheep
Change your sound to one that sells
Get us more money or go to hell
