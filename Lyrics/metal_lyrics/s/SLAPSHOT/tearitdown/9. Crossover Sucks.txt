You sing about such bullshit, like you're from the streets
Say "YO!" to your friends and everyone that you meet
Like you're from the city, I laugh at you all
Because you're from the suburbs and you work at the mall - Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Take your turntables and throw them away
Crossover sucks, crossover sucks
Hip Hop and Hardcore, that's so fucking gay
Crossover sucks, crossover sucks

Let's get with the trend and form a new band
Dig a big hole, stick your head in the sand
Think you'll get rich and smoke lots of grass?
While a big record label fucks you in the ass - Ha!

Kid Rock, Limp Biscuit. Suck on my dick
Crossover sucks, crossover sucks

All of this bullshit just makes me sick
Crossover sucks, crossover sucks

Seven Dust, Godsmack. That's all that you see
Crossover sucks, crossover sucks

Please somebody bomb MTV!

Crossover sucks
Crossover sucks

Crossover sucks
Crossover sucks

Crossover sucks
Crossover sucks

Crossover sucks
Crossover sucks

Crossover sucks
Crossover sucks

Crossover sucks
Crossover sucks
