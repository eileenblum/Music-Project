Use it for home protection
Use it to kill yourself
Columbine was just the beginning
When is it going to end?

Shoot Charlton Heston
Shoot Charlton Heston
Shoot Charlton Heston
Shoot Charlton Heston

Fuck the Second Amendment
It's not a constitutional right
To sit in the woods and get fucked up
And shoot everything in sight

Shoot Charlton Heston
Shoot Charlton Heston
Shoot Charlton Heston
Shoot Charlton Heston

Shoot Charlton Heston
Shoot him in the face
Shoot Charlton Heston
Blow his fucking brains out!
