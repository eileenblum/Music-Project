Terrorists are coming
They're going to take your life away
Got to keep everybody scared
In the name of the USA
Let's spread some fear
Let's spread some fear
Let's spread some fear
Let's spread some fear
Attack us from the Middle East
They want to kill us because we're free
It's time to die for a corporation
To take the fight to the enemy... enemy!
Let's spread some fear
Let's spread some fear
Let's spread some fear
Let's spread some fear
Fight for freedom when we're not free
Got some anthrax in your mail
A dirty bomb with your name on it
Speak your mind and end up in jail
