I wish I could find a piece of mind
[?]
And I wish there was something that mattered to me
But the end doesn't seem to have no piece
We are blameless
It's nobodies fault 

Blameless
Blameless 

You say that depression stuns the mind
That's what I do every time
And I always end up where I start
An angry f**k without a heart
You say you're blameless
Something in my past 

Blameless
Blameless - I'm the same as you
Blameless
Blameless
