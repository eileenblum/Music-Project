I got a bad bad feeling that I've got nothing to give
[?]

Call 911
You know I'm waiting
I said I waited
I said I waited
The policeman came and read me my rights
I went quietly, I didn't put up a fight
Someone find me a good lawyer
No need to worry
No need to worry 

I'm victimized - victimized
I'm victimized - victimized
I'm victimized - victimized 

I'm out on bail and I'm out of jail
And I'll say it's because the system failed
[?]
And I'll live it up before the trial
Before the trial
Before the trial
I'm high and wanted when I take the stand
The beers were getting sober out of hand
I'm glad he beat me senseless
And she hooked him
The lord help them 

I'm victimized - victimized
I'm victimized - victimized
I'm victimized - victimized 

Only served one year in a federal pen
And when I get out I can do it again
Just say that I was the victim
I was the victim
I was the victim
My right to bear arms is guaranteed
And I'll pay my lawyer with my royalties
The book deal and the movies made me wealthy
Yeah, I'm a rich man
Now I'm a rich man 

I'm victimized - victimized
I'm victimized - victimized
I'm victimized - victimized
