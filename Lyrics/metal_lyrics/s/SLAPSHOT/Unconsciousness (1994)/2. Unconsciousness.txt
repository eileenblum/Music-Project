You wish for me that I'll be your dream
But I'll only bring you down
I'll only bring you down
Make me a fool
And I'll bury you
I hope you find yourself
Cause I'm living in... 

Unconsciousness
Unconsciousness 

In like a sin
I've got nothing to give
You've gotta see through this
You've gotta see through this
If I seem fake
Well that's your mistake
Opportunity lies inside of me
As real as f**k 

Unconsciousness
Unconsciousness 

If you knew what I know
If you knew what I know
If you knew what I know
If you knew what I know
If you knew what I know 

What I know
What I know
What I know 

Come please and see
My reality
I got no ambition at all
Except to be with you
Just to give yourself
To somebody else
But it's gonna be your call
I just can't view 

Unconsciousness
Unconsciousness
