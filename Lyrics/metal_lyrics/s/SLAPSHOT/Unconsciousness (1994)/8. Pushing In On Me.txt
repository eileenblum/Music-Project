If I don't know
What I don't know
It'll kill me
It'll kill me 

What I can't see
WithÂ [?]
It frustrates me
It frustrates me 

If for 10 years
A lousy 10 years
And I'm still nothing
Yeah, I'm still nothing 

Maybe someday
I'll be working
And I'll still think nothing
Feels so boring 

Pushing in on me
Pushing
Pushing in on me
Pushing 

I hope I've got
Someone who loves me
Well at least she does
Yes she does
The older I get
The bitterer I get
I'm so angry
I'm so angry 

Pushing in on me
Pushing
Pushing in on me
Pushing 

If for 10 years
A lousy 10 years
And I'm still nothing
Yeah, I'm still nothing 

The older I get
the bitterer I get
I'm still so angry
I'm still so angry 

Pushing in on me
Pushing
Pushing in on me
Pushing 

Pushing in on me
Pushing
Pushing in on me
Pushing
