Someday we'll all get better
To many camps out in the streets
Try to make us into robots
We fight back, they'll get beat
Never speak our mind in public
You can call the police
They take away you're right to protest
They take away you're right to speak 

You've got the right
You've got the right
You've got the right - to remain violent 

Say there's too much violence in TV
All they get is friendly shows
I've never been much for violence
Now it seems it's the only way to go
All the kids just never listen
Unless someone hurt their cars
And you can hurt them good
If they don't obey the laws 

You've got the right
You've got the right
You've got the right - to remain violent 

You've got the right
You've got the right
You've got the right - to remain violent 

You've got the right
You've got the right
You've got the right - to remain violent
