There's just one place I'm looking for
There's something I will never find
And I'm afraid to stop
I'm goin' on and I mean what I say
Pictures of you all
Are on my mind's wall
I'll get back to you soon
Gimme the time to sto 

I won't be afraid no more
I'll sit down on the beach
And say what I think deep to my soul
Losin' myself into the end of the sky
I'll cry an' put my heart into the sea
Hope you will come down
To take my body away
Take my body away
Back to my friends
[?]

There's just one place I'm looking for
There's something I will never find
And I'm afraid to stop
I'm goin' on and I mean what I say
I'll cry an' put my heart into the sea
Hope you will come down
To take my body away
Take my body away
Back to my friends

I won't be afraid no more
I'll sit down on the beach
And say what I think deep to my soul, deep to my soul
Losin' myself into the end of the sky
I'll cry an' put my heart into the sea
Hope you will come down
To take my body away
Take my body away
Take my body away
Take my body away

Gimme the time to stop
