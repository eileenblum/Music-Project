If what I say
When I say, when I say, I can't take it
They're gonna take, gonna take,
Gonna take you away from me
If I'll be straight
Don't know, don't know, don't know if I can take it
Just can't let them take you away from me 

Cause if they take
If they keep you away from me
You know I won't leave you alone
If you take your love from me
Gonna be, gonna be a broken, broken man 

No I won't leave
Won't leave, won't leave, won't leave without you
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting across the street
Where have you been
Have you been, have you been, I know you've been
With someone
Just can't let them take you away from me 

Cause if they take
If they keep you away from me
You know I won't leave you alone
If you take your love from me
Gonna be, gonna be a broken, broken man 

I say I'm broken
I'm really broken
I say I'm broken
I'm really broken, broken, broken 

I say I'm broken
I'm really broken
I say I'm broken
I'm really broken, broken, broken a broken man
