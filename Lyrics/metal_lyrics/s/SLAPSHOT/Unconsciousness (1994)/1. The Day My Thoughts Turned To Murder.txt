I see a spider crawling - it's crawling down my wall
I want to cut you down - Just to watch you fall
There's people laughing at me - everywhere I go
I know they're all out to get me - but all I know is all I know 

My world falls apart
Knew it from the start
That's when all my thoughts turned to murder 

I see those peoples faces - they'll never learn about me
I feel so isolated - and so fucking angry
Wish I could be more friendly - and make allot of friends
I only get fucked over - and I have to play the game 

My world falls apart
Knew it from the start
That's when all my thoughts turned to murder 

My world falls apart
Knew it from the start
That's when all my thoughts turned to murder 

My world falls apart
Knew it from the start
That's when all my thoughts turned to murder
