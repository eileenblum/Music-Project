Save me
You want to save me from myself
And try ta take me
But I'm a man who can't be caged
And try to fail me
And you won't get a second chance

Don't know we're getting back

My friends
They say I should get some help
And you're friends
They wonder why you're still with him
You should tell them that I'm not that way with you
They should have pulled through
And I'll never a jerk
