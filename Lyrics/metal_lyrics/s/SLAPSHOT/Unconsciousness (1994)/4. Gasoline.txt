Poor little babe
A puppet on a string
I can't have gone by my own
I'm mad at you
Always a screw
That don't mean anyone 

I'm the one
I'm the man
Take me now
By the hand
You can see
All of me
Cut my wrists
And I bleed
Gasoline 

Don't pick my brain
You say I'm insane
Did you hear what you want
Left all alone
In my twilight zone
The lights are all turned off 

I'm the one
I'm the man
Take me now
By the hand
You can see
All of me
Cut my wrists
And I bleed
Gasoline 

If you should know
I might explode
I can't control myself
Don't pity me
'Cause I might agree
The truth is just too great 

I'm the one
I'm the man
Take me now
By the hand
You can see
All of me
Cut my wrists
And I bleed
Gasoline
