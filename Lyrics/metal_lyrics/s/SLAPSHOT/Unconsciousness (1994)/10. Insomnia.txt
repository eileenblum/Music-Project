Why can't I raise the dead
Empty eyes in my head
Now we know all your pain
Never see you again 

You said you had no regrets
How can I get her to regret
Both of you had nothing left to give
Then you lost the will to live 

Close my eyes and I see
Your face smiles in that gleam
Hard to know how you feel
Never believe this is real 

Haven't seen some friends in years
Didn't want to see you all in tears
I hope you finally get your peace
[?]
Insomnia 

You said you had no regrets
How can I get her to regret
Both of you had nothing left to give
Then you lost the will to live
