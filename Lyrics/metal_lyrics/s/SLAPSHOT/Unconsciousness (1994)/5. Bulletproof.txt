There's nothing that you can do to me
That hasn't been done before
Before
Before
Before

And I'm pathetic
You'll never know
How much I hate you
But I wish I did
But no I don't 

My skin is bulletproof
I get hurt by everything you say
That's why I'll always keep my guard up
And I'll never, never, never let it down
You'll always stub me
For what we've got
We have gotten everybody
Don't let em fight 

I might get crucified
But I can't never die
I made life eat on the floor
It always comes back for more, more, more, more
You can't keep a good man down
That's why I'll never rest
There may be something I've done
Something you may despise
