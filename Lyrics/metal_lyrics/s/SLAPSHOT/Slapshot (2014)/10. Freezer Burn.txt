I don't do drugs
But I'm more fucked up than you
Wish I knew why
You decided you were through with me
My heads on fire
But my heart is as cold as ice
I got my gun
And now I'm paying the price

Freezer burn - is all I get from you
Freezer burn - is all I get from you
Freezer burn - is all I get from you
Freezer burn - is all I get from you

So now we're friends
Do you really know what that means
Pick up the phone
Would you really be there for me
The thought is nice
Half of something is better than none
Have I got trust
Try to come at me with a loaded gun

Freezer burn - is all I get from you
Freezer burn - is all I get from you

Is all I get from you
Is all I get from you
Is all I get from you
Is all I get from you
