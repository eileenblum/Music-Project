It's only music get a fucking clue
Who gives a fuck if someone picks on you
What the fuck are all you fighting for?
This isn't what I make this music for
20 years of my life down the drain
If it wasn't so much fun I'd go insane
I made some music I made some friends
If I had the time I'd do it all again

I could have had my kids at 21
But then I couldn't have had so much fun
Every time I think I might be done
All this wasted time was so much fun

What's the point of growing old
With nothing to show for or stories told
And here I am still hanging tough
I've got my memories when times get rough
