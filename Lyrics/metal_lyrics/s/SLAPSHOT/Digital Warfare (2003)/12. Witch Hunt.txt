Say your prayers
Because the blood is on your hands
Destroy
Who'd you die for on that cross?
Evil
No place on this earth worth saving
Betrayed
Twelve friends had one that got you killed
Lord we need some saving
Please tell me what to do
Millions
Killed every year in your name
Virus
Spreading like the plague
Terror
Over land you've given to them
Hatred
Because they're different from me
There's no axis of evil
And there's no place that's good
When there's a child raping priest
In every neighborhood
Get a bomb strapped to me
Told from high above
God you see right through me
And I'm killing in your name
