United we win divided we fall
How much have we heard that call
All these years have we learned anything?
New bands form they shout and scream
For some unrealistic dream
It's every man for himself in this world
A thousand years have seen no change
But still you think you'll re-arrange
You'll never change society
Coming together is a good idea
But I haven't seen it happen here
I've just had it with unity
I've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
Unite and fight, unite and be strong
That shit's gone on for far too long
Don't you see that you will never win
Always looking for a fight
But still you stand and shout unite!
Hypocritical to the end
I've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
With all the shouting that you do
You'd think that all you say is true
But shouting never changed anything
Never do nothing and nothing gets done
All my hope has long since gone
But you'll be the first to say that you've won
I've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
We've had it with unity
