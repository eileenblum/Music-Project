I'm a person just like you
But I've got better things to do
Than sit around and fuck my head
Hang out with the living dead
Snort white shit up my nose
Pass out at the shows
I don't even think about speed
That's something I just don't need
I've got the Straight Edge
I'm a person just like you
But I've got better things to do
Than sit around and smoke dope
Because I know I can cope
Laugh at the thought of eating ludes
Laugh at the thought of sniffing glue
Never want to use a crutch
Always going to keep in touch
I've got the Straight Edge
I've got the Straight Edge
I've got the Straight Edge
I've got the Straight Edge
I've got the Straight Edge
I've got the Straight Edge
I've got the Straight Edge
