What the fuck are you angry for?
Got what you want and you want some more
You scream and you stomp you sure have some rage
I wish you'd just get off my fucking stage
All your bullshit is just so fake - Stupid fucking kids
You just take and you take and you take - Stupid fucking kids
Same old everybody has them tattoos
You dance like a moron and look like a fool
Act like a hard guy when you're such a nerd
Scream individual - follow the herd
Why did I ever waste time with this shit
The kids never care as they bash through the pit
It just a stage we all have to go through
Just one more clique with different rules
All your bullshit is just so fake - Stupid fucking kids
You just take and you take and you take - Stupid fucking kids
Hit all the right shows and follow right bands - Stupid fucking kids
Wear the right shirts wear the "X" on your hands - Stupid fucking kids
Some waste time some waste their whole lives - Stupid fucking kids
I've wasted time watching life pass me by - Stupid fucking kids
