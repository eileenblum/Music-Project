Guilty as sin
You did me in
Says that this is the way
Your view across
Grave you will toss
Your life and mine
Spike in your arm
Just adds to your charm
Or so you do think
The trend you got caught in
For sure will do you in
[Bloody] razor in the sink
Your singular focus
Tears the world apart
Communication breakdown
From your head to your heart
Overzealous focus
You will break before you bend
Explosives strapped to your chest
Your mission's at its end
Easy as pie
Easy as lies
Coming from your head
Say what you will
I've had my fill
Caught too many times
Your singular focus
Tears the world apart
Communication breakdown
From your head to your heart
Overzealous focus
You will break before you bend
Explosives strapped to your chest
Your mission's at its end
Such a bitter pill
Such a test of wills
A razor to your wrist
Have you had your fill?
Guilty without appeal
And that's the way you feel
Says that this is the way
And I've just got to deal
Your singular focus
Tears the world apart
Communication breakdown
From your head to your heart
Overzealous focus
You will break before you bend
Explosives strapped to your chest
Your mission's at its end
