Who are you? What's that under your skin?
The truth has got to be there
Who am I? Am I kidding myself
That the pain is too much to bear
Who are we? Is it my time to look
At your lies That are plain in sight
Can you see? What this is doing to me
It was dark but it's now in the light
What's your identity?
Is it what we can see
What's your identity?
What do you want from me?
Who are you? Have I ever known you?
You've been someone else from the start
Who am I? when will I know the truth?
I've been telling you from the heart
Who are we? Have you ever been real?
Is there anyone living inside
Can you see? that I want to break out
But you keep taking me for a ride
What's your identity?
Is it what we can see
What's your identity?
What do you want from me?
Identity
Identity
Identity
Identity
Identity - Get the fuck away from me
Identity - It's time to set me free
