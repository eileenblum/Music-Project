History isn't honest
It doesn't tell the tale of how things used to be in "the day"
Now everyone keeps trying to recapture a feeling
That's long since gone
Time to move along
Spirit of '81 - Time to get it back
Spirit of '81 - It flew off the track
Spirit of '81 - Time to resurrect
Spirit of '81 - It's better off dead
The new kids talk about the old days
As if it was some kind of perfect scene for us
Big deal - So I was there - It was only luck that I was born before you
Take your shitty bands - saying they were great
Believe me, nobody cares
So I'm old and cranky - But at least I'm right
Sure the old days were great but lets move on
Spirit of '81 - Time to get it back
Spirit of '81 - It flew off the track
Spirit of '81 - Time to resurrect
Spirit of '81 - It's better off dead
Spirit of '81 - Time to get it back
Spirit of '81 - It flew off the track
Spirit of '81 - Time to resurrect
Spirit of '81 - It's better off dead
