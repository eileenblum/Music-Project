Brought me into this world now I take you out
You've been in control my entire life
Now I'm the one that's in control
And I'll give you something to cry about
Say your prayers it's time to die
Plead and beg let's hear you cry
You never wanted me that's what you said
A better life for you if I was dead
Now that I'm the one that's in control
With a gun right at your skull let's make a hole
Say your prayers it's time to die
Plead and beg let's hear you cry
If I believed
Everything you ever said
I would have gone to the edge
And jumped right to my death
But now the tables
Have turned on my old friend
For years and years and years
I've wished that you were dead
Kill your parents
Kill your parents
Kill your parents
Kill your parents
