Transmission - Suspicion who's got it find out no doubt
Transmission - Eradication, search and destroy 

We've got to wipe out 

Transmission - One million infected no more
Transmission - Precaution be careful or you get what's coming to you

Don't throw away the life you've built
Don't be another name left on the quilt
You keep it up and you'll end up dead
You've got a loaded gun at your head
You use the needle that the others use
Just pull the trigger and find out you lose
So now you're waiting for the end to come
Don't look back now, cause what's done is 

Transmission - Incubation - Seven years later, good bye world
Transmission - Retribution God punish you - Well that's bullshit 

Transmission - Redication keeps em alive to infect more
Transmission - Replication again and again and again and again and again

Now you come down with a positive test
You know you're dead but you'll do your best
Keep your hopes up that's what you told
You live in fear of the common cold
You never told you family
Obituary says H.I.V.
You'll never know what you've put them through
You've got to end the things you do
