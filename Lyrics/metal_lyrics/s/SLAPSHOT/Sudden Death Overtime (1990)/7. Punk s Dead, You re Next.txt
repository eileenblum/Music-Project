You talk about acceptance but just look at you
Now you can join the mainstream
When you look the way you do
You talk about anarchy well I'll show you some
You won't last one minute if the real thing comes 

Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next 

You want to worship Wattie that not the way to be
You think your looks don't matter well we'll just wait and see
You'll end up like the other's all fucked up or dead
Taking shit from people or get kicked in the head 

Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next 

Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next
Punk's dead, you're next 

Who's next?
