I see the violence on the TV screen
A man doused himself with gasoline
He lit a match went up in flames
I think this world is totally deranged
Read about a murder every day
You cannot hide cannot get away
Armageddon will be our fate
I think we're living in a nation of... 

Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate 

I hate him and he hates me
over who has the greatest scene
he shouts at me with idle threats
I won't be happy til I see him dead
See them on Phil Donahue
Geraldo's face is black and blue
The KKK and the JDL
I think we're all going to go to hell 

Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate 

Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate 

Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate 

Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate
Nation of hate
