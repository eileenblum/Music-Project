Eight of us hit NYC - we're gonna have ourselves some fun
We do everything we want but then we've got to run 

Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here 

We've hit Peepland, we've hit Famous Ray's, we've been hanging out in St. Marks square
But we've got to get out of this stinking place, even though we have fun down here. 

Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here 

Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
Take me away, I can't stay, get me out of here
