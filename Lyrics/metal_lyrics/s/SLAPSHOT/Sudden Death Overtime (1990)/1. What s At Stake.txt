Stick the needle into your arm
Do anything that does you harm
I see you falling down on the floor
I see you staggering out the door 

You tried it and you liked it and you thought that
You could take it
Until you realized you couldn't escape it
How far you fall you don't know
Until you're at the bottom with a nose full of blow
You don't know what you're to me
To see you laying there so helplessly
Get yourself together, before it's too late
Or a life of pain will be your fate 

You don't care about anyone
Just so long as you've had your fun
But not until you get your fix
And now you're taking a deep six 

You tried it and you liked it and you thought that
You could take it
Until you realized you couldn't escape it
How far you fall you don't know
Until you're at the bottom with a nose full of blow
You don't know what you're to me
To see you laying there so helplessly
Get yourself together, before it's too late
Or a life of pain will be your fate 

You tried it and you liked it and you thought that
You could take it
Until you realized you couldn't escape it
How far you fall you don't know
Until you're at the bottom with a nose full of blow
You don't know what you're to me
To see you laying there so helplessly
Get yourself together, before it's too late
Or a life of pain will be your fate 

What's at stake
What's at stake
What's at stake
