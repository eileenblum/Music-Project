We're fighting a war we can't win
But it's a war we can't afford to lose
Corrupt officials play the game
And America's habit is to blame

Another judge cut down today
Cartel's hit squad, here to stay
Motherfuckers don't deserve to live
If they give violence that's what we'll give

Casual user snorting lies
While another innocent person dies
Cheap thrills blood spills
It's a no-win-war and we foot the bill

But there's no way to stop the flow
Watch your children's habit grow

Intimidation is the game.
Cut them down they're all the same
Send them all to hell...
