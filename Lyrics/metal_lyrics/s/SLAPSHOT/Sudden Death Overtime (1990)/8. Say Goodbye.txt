Say goodbye not goodnight
Half a bottle should be right
No trouble no more pain
Throw your life down the drain
But what about the people left behind
The lifeless body that your mother finds
You won't be happy til the deed is done
You've lost your battle but you still won 

You say your friends hate you
Still they came to see you
Now you're gone but pain stays
Their friends gone - we remain 

But what about the people left behind
The lifeless body that your mother finds
You won't be happy til the deed is done
You've lost your battle but you still won 

But what about the people left behind
The lifeless body that your mother finds
You won't be happy til the deed is done
You've lost your battle but you still won 

But what about the people left behind
The lifeless body that your mother finds
You won't be happy til the deed is done
You've lost your battle but you still won
