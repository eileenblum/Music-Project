[Intro:] Yeah, I'd just wanted to how Youth of Today ripped Jack of and why he hates Bold so much. And my number in the US is [distorted phone-number] and I'm just wondering why you're so negative and violent towards, you know, people that don't have the same believes as you. If you could answer my questions I'd be great. 

You think you've got the baddest scene
But you don't know what the baddest means
So don't tell stories that aren't true
'Cause when we come around you'll have something to prove 

Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove! 

You keep on bragging about your so-called crew
But we don't see anything you do
You tell old tales that never were
Inventing a scene you'll never have 

Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove! 

Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove
Something to prove!
