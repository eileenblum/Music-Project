You're dealing with pennies
You're dealing with lies
That you've turned on us is no surprise
You're dealing with pennies
You're dealing with greed
The life you've been leading isn't all that you need
Your true colors come shining through
And you'll feel the pain for the things you do
Your true colors come shining through
Is a couple of bucks so important to you? 

We once called you brother
We called you a friend
But you fucked us over
Again and again
Who cares about old times
Who cares anymore
We'll wait for the right time
To even the score 

Your true colors come shining through
And you'll feel the pain for the things you do
Your true colors come shining through
Is a couple of bucks so important to you? 

Your true colors come shining through
And you'll feel the pain for the things you do
Your true colors come shining through
Is a couple of bucks so important to you? 

Your true colors come shining through
And you'll feel the pain for the things you do
Your true colors come shining through
Is a couple of bucks so important to you?
