[originally by Jefferson Airplane]One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice, when she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar 
Has given you the call
And call Alice, when she was just small

When the men on the chessboard 
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice, I think she'll know

When logic and proportion 
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the white knight is talking backwards
And the red queen's off with her head
Remember what the dormouse said
Feed your head, feed your head 

One pill makes you nervous
And one pill makes you fall
And the ones that you've been taking
Won't do you any good at all
Go ask Alice, she just hit the floor

Now, you say you could take it
Yeah, you'd say anything
But when your habbit does all the talking
Yeah, you'd say anything
You could ask Alice, but I think she's gone

Now, you've just lost all your money
And you've been thrown out of your home
But for one more gram of cocaine
You'd sell you very soul
Go ask Alice, well, now she knows

She's living in a dreamworld
[?]
But you'd better pull yourself together
'Cause this is reality
But I think that you'd might be better off dead
Use your head
Use your head
Use your head
