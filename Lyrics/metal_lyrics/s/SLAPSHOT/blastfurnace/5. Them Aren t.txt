Don't need any more hate I hate enough already
I don't need any more grief I got all I can stand
Don't need any more homeless I've given all I can
I can't wait to shed all my loneliness
I've felt alone mt entire life but I'm not
I'm already dead
Don't need any more friends
I've been hurt to many time before
I don't need religion
The church is more corrupt than me
I don't need television but I still watch it endlessly
I can't deal with people
Cause they see right through me
But I'm not
I'm already dead
