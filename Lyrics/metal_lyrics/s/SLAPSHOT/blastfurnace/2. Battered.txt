Beat her into submission
Beat her out of her love
I didn't want to but you made me
Clean up this f**king mess
Beat her she didn't do the dishes
Smash her across the face
Oh now honey I love you madly
But get down and suck on my dick right now
You only married me for my money you worthless piece of shit
Shut those kids up or you'll get my belt across the back of you thigh 

Don't ever ever talk back to me
Cause if it wasn't for me you'd be on the streets
Do the dishes or maybe I won't knock out your f**king teeth
Walk in the room
It's three am he's passed out cold
Cross over to the bed and tie him to it
Seven years of living hell
It's time he got what he deserves
Cut his dick of and watch him bleed to death
