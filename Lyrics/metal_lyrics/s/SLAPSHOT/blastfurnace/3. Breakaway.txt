Can't climb any mountains can't climb any seas
I think all your friends hate me
They treat me like I got some f**king disease 

Breakaway
Breakaway 

I don't think much of myself
You could say I got low self esteem
But my heart breaks just like anyones
Although to most that's not how it seems 

Breakaway
Breakaway 

It's a form of mindcontrol
And it's taking my very soul
I don't make friends just enemies
And I'll never know what you see in me 

Breakaway
Breakaway
