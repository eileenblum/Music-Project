I'm gonna get it back
Get back what we had
We're gonna fight to make it right
You know we'll use our might
We're gonna take it to the start
We know we use our heart
We're gonna fight to get it back
You know we'll be back on the map

Back on the map
Back on the map
Back on the map
Back on the map

It's time for us to run
You know we'll never fall
We're take back what is ours
Gonna take it all
But I know we'll get it back
We'll get back all we had
And you'll see us when we're there
Back on the map

Back on the map
Back on the map
Back on the map
Back on the map

Back on the map
Back on the map
Back on the map
Back on the map 

Back on the map
