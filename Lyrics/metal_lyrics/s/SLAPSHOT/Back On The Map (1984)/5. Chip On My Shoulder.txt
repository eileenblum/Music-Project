Walking around and all I see
Druggies and alkies all around me
Blowing their smoke in my face
Talking to me from outer space
Go to the square and they ask me
To buy for them or smoke some weed
Tell them to fuck off - go away
They say I've got a problem
Yeah, I got a chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Hanging around of a Friday night
Shithead always getting into fights
I'm fed up with all of you
But there's nothing I can do
Go to the square and they ask me
To buy for them or smoke some weed
Tell them to fuck off - go away
They say I've got a problem
Yeah, I got a chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Walking around and all I see
Druggies and alkies all around me
Blowing their smoke in my face
Talking to me from outer space
Go to the square and they ask me
To buy for them or smoke some weed
Tell them to fuck off - go away
They say I've got a problem
Yeah, I got a chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Chip on my shoulder
Chip on my shoulder 

Knock it off!
