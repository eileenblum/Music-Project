Riots in the streets - it's happening today
Torture, Murder, Death - it's happening today
Starvation everywhere - it's happening today
People running scared - it's happening today 

Close your eyes
Don't ask why
Don't you try
It's out of sight, it's out of... 

Give the streets command - it's happening today
Poisons kill the land - it's happening today
Acid from the sky - it's happening today
Rivers running dry - it's happening today 

Don't look back
We're on crack
The future's black
You can turn your back
And you get stabbed 

It's happening today
It's happening today
It's happening today
It's happening today 

Close your eyes
Don't ask why
Don't you try
It's out of sight, it's out of mind
