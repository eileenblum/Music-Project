Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this tropic port aboard this tiny ship
The mate with the mighty sailor man
A skipper brave and sure
But passengers that sail the day
A three hour tour
A three hour tour 

The weather started getting rough
The tiny ship was tossed
If not for the courage of the fearless crew
The Minnow would be lost
The Minnow would be lost 

The ship ran ashore of this uncharted isle
With Gilligan
The skipper too
The millionaire and his wife
The movie star
Professor and Mary-Anne
Here on Gilligan's Isle
