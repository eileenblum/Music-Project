You hide behind every reason, behind a pack of lies
You think we all buy what you sell
So the way you live your life isn't everything you want
So you make up the life you want to tell 

Moment of truth
Moment of truth
Moment of truth 

You make up lots of stories
You make up lots of tales
But you don't know what through these angry eyes
Just once in your life, can you tell what is what
Instead of handing us the lies 

Moment of truth
Moment of truth
Moment of truth
Moment of truth 

Moment of truth
Moment of truth
Moment of truth
Moment of truth 

Moment
Moment
Moment
Moment... of truth!
