Why is everybody on my back
Better leave me be or I'll attack
Always giving giving giving crap
Push me more and I'm gonna snap
We're a powder keg that's gonna blow
If you don't want to die you'd better go
Why doesn't just everybody just leave me alone
Before this place becomes a combat zone 

Where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's smoke there's fire 

Head is smoking but a fire's near
Putting out isn't what I fear
What is when the flame spread
Don't like ideas inside my head
What we say is what we do
When the fire comes down on you
Don't start what you can't end
I'd be nice but I can't pretend 

Where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's smoke there's fire 

Where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's smoke there's fire 

Where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's smoke there's fire 

Where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's smoke there's fire 

There is fire... There is fire... There is fire
