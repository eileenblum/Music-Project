It was summertime
Just another day
Could have been October as the cold wind hit the bay
You couldn't know
What you meant to me
The feeling felt so close, I couldn't let you see
But now you're a stranger
Your eyes seem so cold
This is the time to break what couldn't be sold 

What we said we made brothers
But still, the end would come
But the end wasn't the finish
What we said wasn't done 

Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost 

This winter time goes on and on and on
This killing frost is deep inside of me
What to say
Does it have to mean this much
Or can we just shrug and laugh it off
Laughing time
They wipe away the wounds
But time will never remove the scars 

What we said we made brothers
But still, the end would come
But the end wasn't the finish
What we said wasn't done 

Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost - Is all that's left 

What we said we made brothers
But still, the end would come
But the end wasn't the finish
What we said wasn't done 

Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost
Killing frost
