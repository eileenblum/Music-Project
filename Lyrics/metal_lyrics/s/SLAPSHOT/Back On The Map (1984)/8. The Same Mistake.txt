Tried to get it right
Tried to get it right
But I made the same mistake
I made the same mistake
Tried to get it right
Tried to get it right
But I made the same mistake
I made the same mistake
Everything I say
And everything I do
Comes out wrong in the end
Wrong in the end
Everything I say
And everything I do
Comes out wrong in the end
Wrong in the end
I don't know what to do
Cause I can't get over you 

Tried to get it right
Tried to get it right
But I made the same mistake
I made the same mistake
Tried to get it right
Tried to get it right
But I made the same mistake
I made the same mistake
Everything I say
And everything I do
Comes out wrong in the end
Wrong in the end
Everything I say
And everything I do
Comes out wrong in the end
Wrong in the end
I don't know what to do
Cause I can't get over you 

I don't know what to do
Cause I can't get over you
