You can take your ideas and throw them out the door
'Cause we don't give a shit, who they're fuckin for
We like our ideas and we put them in your head
And if you don't like it, you're gonna wind up dead 

It's me, let's be
That's right, let's fight
Might makes right
Might makes right 

It's me, let's be
That's right, let's fight
Might makes right
Might makes right
