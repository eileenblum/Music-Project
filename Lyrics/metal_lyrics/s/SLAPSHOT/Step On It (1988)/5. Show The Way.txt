We've gotta show the way to fight them
Gotta show the way show we're strong
Show the way live our lives
Show the way
Won't belong - no! 

You don't have to hear us
You could miss the point
You don't have to be there
You could watch it go on
You don't have to listen
But if you you I'll be there 

We gotta show the way keep our minds
Gotta show the way to live right
Show the way staying free
Show the way it's in sight - yes! 

You don't have to hear us
You could miss the point
You don't have to be there
You could watch it go on
You don't have to listen
But if you you I'll be there 

Show the way
