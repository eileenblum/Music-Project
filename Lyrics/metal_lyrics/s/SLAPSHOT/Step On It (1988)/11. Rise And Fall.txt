You were cool a second ago
But now the water turns to steam
The lowered voice you had before
Has risen to a scream
But now the water turns to ice
And you walk away from us
One minute your as calm as can be
But the next you make a fuss 

You don't know what you do
You don't know what you say
You don't know how to keep
Your emotions at bay 

You don't know what you do
You don't know what you say
You don't know how to keep
Your emotions at bay 

Your moods are always swinging
From the left to the right
One minute out of nowhere
You try to start a fight
You'd better get your acts together
Or you'll be out of luck
Sitting around and fuming
Is where you'll be stuck 

You don't know what you do
You don't know what you say
You don't know how to keep
Your emotions at bay 

You don't know what you do
You don't know what you say
You don't know how to keep
Your emotions at bay 

Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall 

You don't know what you do
You don't know what you say
You don't know how to keep
Your emotions at bay 

You don't know what you do
You don't know what you say
You don't know how to keep
Your emotions at bay 

Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
