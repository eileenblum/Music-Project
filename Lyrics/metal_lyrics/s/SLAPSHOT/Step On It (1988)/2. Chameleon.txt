Chameleon - what's your color today
Chameleon - this ain't your color to stay
Chameleon - blows the way the wind blows
Chameleon - goes where everyone goes

Is it because your weak
Is it acceptance you seek
You don't have to be a freak
Freak 

Chameleon - what's the look right now
Chameleon - I know you'll change somehow
Chameleon - I didn't recognize you
Chameleon - because you look like a fool 

What's the new thing this week
Is it because your weak
Is it acceptance you seek
You don't have to be a freak
Freak 

What's the new thing this week

You don't have to be a freak
