When we're on the road we can't be stopped
We're gonna go until we drop
Only twohundred miles to go
Step on it we can't be slow 

Step on it
Step on it
Step on it
Step on it 

Third stop now we are right on time
Wake up Hank we're of the line
Twelve hours gone we can't be late
Twelve hours more to another state 

Step on it
Step on it
Step on it
Step on it 

Step on it
Step on it
Step on it
Step on it
