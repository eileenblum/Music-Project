Time I hear the tick of the clock, tick tock
You watch the hours go by
No way it's that time already
Too late - see how time flies 

Time I hear the tick of the clock, tick tock
You watch the hours go by
No way it's that time already
Too late - see how time flies 

No time left
No time left
No time left
There's no time
Left for you
Left for me
There's no time left
There's no time left 

How did things get by me
Now I'm to old to start
But what can I do about it
When can I play a part 

No time left
No time left
No time left
There's no time
Left for you
Left for me
There's no time left
There's no time left 

No time left
No time left
No time left
There's no time
Left for you
Left for me
There's no time left
There's no time left 

Left for you
Left for me
There's no time left
None at all
