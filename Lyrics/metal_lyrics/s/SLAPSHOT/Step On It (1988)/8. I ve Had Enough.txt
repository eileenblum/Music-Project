I've had enough of purple hair and all the freaks I see
I've had enough of the dirty looks that everyone gives to me
I've had enough of the attitudes of everyone in the scene
I've had enough of the angry kids who won't say what they mean 

I've had enough
I've had enough 

I've had enough of lousy clubs who won't give bands a chance
I've had enough of lazy kids who won't take a stance
I've had enough of strength through Oi and the kids who follow that
I've had enough of straight-edge kids who drink behind my back 

I've had enough
I've had enough
I've had enough
I've had enough 

I've had enough of hangers on
I've had enough I've had enough
I've had enough of this and that
I've had enough I've had enough
I've had enough of stupid kids
I've had enough I've had enough
I've had enough of smoke and drink
I've had enough I've had enough 

I've had enough
I've had enough
I've had enough
I've had enough 

Enough
Enough
I've had enough
