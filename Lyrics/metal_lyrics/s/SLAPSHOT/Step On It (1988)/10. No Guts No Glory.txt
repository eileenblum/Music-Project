You live by the sword you're gonna die by the sword
It's kill or be killed as everyone's told
You've gotta go for broke to be on top
If you hold back there's no reward 

No guts no glory
No guts no glory
No guts no glory
No guts no glory 

It's the guy who shouts the loudest who gets all the fame
Be the baddest man that's the name of the game
Never be a coward you'll be stuck in a hole
You'll never be the leader if you don't fit the mold 

No guts no glory
No guts no glory
No guts no glory
No guts no glory 

No guts no glory
No guts no glory
No guts no glory
No guts no glory
