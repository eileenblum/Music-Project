Live without fear - could it be
Takin out hate - could it be
Seeking no violence - could it be
Is it near - could it be 

Will we live without the pain
Or will we have to fight again
See it end or battle on
Could it be? 

There is never an easy way
But must it always end that way
Live our lives the way we see
Could it be?
