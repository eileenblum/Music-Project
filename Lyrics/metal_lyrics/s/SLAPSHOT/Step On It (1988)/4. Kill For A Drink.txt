You'd sell your soul for a drink right now
You've got no money so you don't know how
You've lost your wife and you want her back
But the bottle's there is no turning back 

You've lost your mind
You've lost your pride
You've lost your strength
You've lost your wife
You've lost your car
You've lost your job
You've lost your life
But you'd still kill for drink right now 

You try to work but it is always there
On your coffee break you grab a beer
You want to stop but you want it more
Look what your children see you for 

You've lost your mind
You've lost your pride
You've lost your strength
You've lost your wife
You've lost your car
You've lost your job
You've lost your life
But you'd still kill for drink right now
