15 years and this is all you've got
You didn't listen to a word we said
All your talk is bullshit it's obvious to me
I look around and see our scene is dead 

I'm not on some nostalgia trip
The old school means shit to me
Don't try to compare what you've got now
To anything I live 

1995 there's nothing new
It's been the same since 1982
Stage diving everywhere I turn
I've been screaming 13 years I'll never learn 

Nothing like we've had before
You worship assholes from New York
Little crews with smaller minds
Why should I waste my time 

I don't want it you can have it!
I got a new name for you it's L.O.S.E.R. 

I don't want it you can have it!
I got a new name for you it's L.O.S.E.R. 

I'm not on some nostalgia trip
The old school means shit to me
Little crews with smaller minds
Why should I waste my time
