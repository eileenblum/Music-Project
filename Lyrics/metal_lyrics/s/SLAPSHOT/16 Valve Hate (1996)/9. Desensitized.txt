Susan Smith sank her car
And murdered her two kids
The real pathetic thing is that
I could give a shit
It's not that I'm so heartless
But you see this every day
I'd like to have some feelings
But they've been beaten all away 

I see their eyes I see their smiles
You cannot hide there's no disguise
I see the truth I see the lies
I see right through - desensitized 

Violence, sex and crime
Are beamed on my t.v.
Kids are killing kids
Everyone's the enemy
Parents know the reason
No one has the cure
They point the finger
Get more policemen in our school - desensitized 

I see their eyes I see their smiles
You cannot hide there's no disguise
I see the truth I see the lies
I see right through - desensitized 

I see right through - desensitized 

I see right through - desensitized 

I see right through - desensitized
