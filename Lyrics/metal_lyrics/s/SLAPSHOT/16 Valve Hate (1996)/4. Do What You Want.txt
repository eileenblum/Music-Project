You want to drink till you can't see
You want to latch on for sympathy
You want to fight with people you know
You want to go where the assholes go 

Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want 

You're on the run, you're on a roll
You can kill yourself, don't think I'd stop you
You can do anything, just don't involved me 

You can take drugs, act like you're free
You want to destroy others property
You want to steal from all your friends
Do that shit again and again 

Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want 

You've hit a new low, now you're on a roll
You think I care, what you do?
You can do what you want,
but I won't clean up when you are through 

Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want but don't you do it to me
Do what you want
