My head is burning
To many sleepless nights
I can't stop dreaming
Turn out my lights
I'm always angry
No apparent reason
Try to make excuses
There aren't any 

I'd like to run but I gotta wait
For my 16 valve hate
I wanna go but I've got a date
With my 16 valve hate 

I lose to an explosion
I take it out on myself
Sick of all these bruises
Can't deal with frustration
And now I wonder
Why no one calls me
It's so depressing
So fucking lonely 

I'd like to run but I gotta wait
For my 16 valve hate
I wanna go buy I've got a date
With my 16 valve hate
