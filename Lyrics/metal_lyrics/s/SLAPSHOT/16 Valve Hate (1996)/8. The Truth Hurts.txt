How much
I think you made it clear
That you were through with me
And I kept trying
To keep a friendship going
That was obvious
You didn't care about 

Do I move on
Now now hope's gone
I feel the same
I guess the truth hurts 

Why do I bother
'Cause you're not worth the time
You blew me off
Now once but many times
And now I see you smile and you're so nice to me
I know you don't care 

Do I move on
Now now hope's gone
I feel the same
I guess the truth hurts 

Do I move on
Now now hope's gone
I feel the same 

Do I move on
Now now hope's gone
I feel the same 

I guess the truth hurts
