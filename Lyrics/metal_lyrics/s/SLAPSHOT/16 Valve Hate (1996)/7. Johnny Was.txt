Johnny was a good boy
But got messed up by the wrong crowd
Everybody liked him
And he made his mother proud
But Johnny had a habit
And it wasn't smoking crack
In the wrong place at the wrong time
He took a bullet in the back 

Johnny was
Johnny was 

Johnny was a gangster
Just 13 with a 45
He was living in a neighborhood where you fight to stay alive
Johnny wouldn't listen
He was told to get away
Now he's learned his lesson
Look what happens when you stay 

Johnny was
Johnny was
Johnny was
Johnny was
