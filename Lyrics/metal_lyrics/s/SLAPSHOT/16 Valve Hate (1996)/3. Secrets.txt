I know all your secrets
But I didn't let you know
Could I ever make you happy
With your self esteem so low
And now lets run into the bathroom
And shove out fingers down our throat
I loved you, but you clammed up
You never let your feelings show 

Secrets secrets you never let them show
Secrets so many secrets how could I have known 

I know I wasn't perfect
And I'll admit this every time
I wanted to be with you
But we had to live our lives
1000 miles stretched between us
And we're both dealing with our past
Insecure and to angry
So I know it wouldn't last 

Secrets secrets you never let them show
Secrets so many secrets how could I have known
And now we've moved on and gone our separate ways
And now I realize I may never see you again 

I tried so hard to get you to talk to me
I begged, and I pleaded
Would have gotten on my knees
The last times we were together
You treated me like shit
So once again I trusted love
And love shoved my face in it 

Secrets secrets you never let them show
Secrets so many secrets how could I have known
And now we've moved on and gone our separate ways
And now I realize I may never see you again
