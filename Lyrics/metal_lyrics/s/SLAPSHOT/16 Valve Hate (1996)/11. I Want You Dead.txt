I really tried to get my head in gear
I lost the only thing that matters to me
And now I'm all alone again
All I think about is getting revenge 

What's the difference
What's the point
You've got your life now
And all I got is shit 

I fall in love but it never works
I always ending up treating her like dirt
I explode I can't control my rage
A starving cat inside a tiny cage 

What's the difference
What's the point
You've got your life now
And all I got is shit 

What's the difference
What's the point
You've got your life now
And all I got is shit 

What's the difference
What's the fucking point
You've got your life now
And now I want you dead 

I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead 

I want you dead
I want you dead
I want you dead
