I've never been fucked up before
But I'm more fucked up than you'll ever dream
Paranoid and insecure
With no escape from all this pain I feel 

Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed 

Seems now no one hears my cries
I fail at everything I try
Nothing ever comes out right
And I haven't got the will to fight 

Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed 

I don't want your sympathy
Love is what is killing me
I don't want your sympathy
Never thought I'd break free 

Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
Watch me bleed 

I've never been fucked up before
But I'm more fucked up than you'll ever dream
Paranoid and insecure
With no escape from all this pain I feel
