Hit me dad, hit me again, hit me with all your might
I can take it, hit me hard, and I won't put up a fight
12 years of your abuse has turned me into a killing machine
I beat my wife, I beat my kids, I'm teaching them what they need 

Teach me to kill, teach me with every beating I receive
Teach me to kill, teach me with everything you that you believe
Teach me to kill, teach me with every beating I receive
Teach me violence, and I'll show it to all I see 

Tried to put my past behind me but it always comes back again
I know the reason but I can't do anything
How can I love when I wasn't shown how to feel
I learned my lesson well, I was taught to kill 

Teach me to kill, teach me with every beating I receive
Teach me to kill, teach me with everything you that you believe
Teach me to kill, teach me with every beating I receive
Teach me violence, and I'll show it to all I see 

These vision paralyze me
You kneeling beside me
I open up my eyes I see you there 

I'm looking straight ahead
There, my kids are dead
This isn't just a dream this is real 

Put me on my knees
Made me beg and plead
But I came back and took your life 

Left all hurt inside
There's no place to hide
Shove my hands into the flame 

Hit me dad, hit me again, hit me with all your might
I can take it, hit me hard, and I won't put up a fight
12 years of your abuse has turned me into a killing machine
I beat my wife, I beat my kids, I'm teaching them what they need 

Teach me to kill, teach me with every beating I receive
Teach me to kill, teach me with everything you that you believe
Teach me to kill, teach me with every beating I receive
Teach me violence, and I'll show it to all I see
