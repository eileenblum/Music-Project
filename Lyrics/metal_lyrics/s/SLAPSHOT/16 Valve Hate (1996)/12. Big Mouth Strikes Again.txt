Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said I'd like to smash every tooth in your head 

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said by rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed 

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt...
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt as the flames rose to her roman nose and her Walkman started to melt 

Bigmouth, bigmouth, bigmouth strikes again and I've got no right to take my place with the human race 

Bigmouth, bigmouth, bigmouth strikes again and I've got no right to take my place with the human race 

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt...
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt as the flames rose to her roman nose and her hearing aid started to melt 

Bigmouth, bigmouth, bigmouth strikes again and I've got no right to take my place with the human race 

Bigmouth, bigmouth, bigmouth strikes again and I've got no right to take my place with the human race 

Bigmouth, bigmouth, bigmouth strikes again and I've got no right to take my place with the human race 

Bigmouth, bigmouth, bigmouth strikes again and I've got no right to take my place with the human race
