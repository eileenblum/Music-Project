See you with that phoney smile
Love to wipe it of your face
Talk so much shit behind my back
I'm not as stupid as you think 

Pardon me, have I been wrong
Or are you just a fake
Please tell me, I'd like to know
How much can I take 

Come to me with your face all read
A bottle of wine has dulled all sense
Talk your bullshit, then stagger away
Then laugh at me cause I'm straight-edge 

Be a friend! what a waste of time
Can't stand anymore heart break
You hate me now, buddy get in line
How much can I take 

Pardon me, have I been wrong
Or are you just a fake
Please tell me, I'd like to know
How much can I take
