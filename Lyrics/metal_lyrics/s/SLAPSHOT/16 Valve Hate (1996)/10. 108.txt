You sing about the straight-edge
Why do you think you're a part of that
When you're god, controls your mind
Weak willed - why don't you take control
Cause the meek will inherit nothing 

You think you've seen the light
You think you've seen the might
Lost inside a fake
Never wide awake
Open up your eyes
Look and see the lie
What's your greatest fear
Where do you go from here 

How much I hate this 108
Turning kids to chanting fools
Hey Ray, why don't you get some self respect
Your religion has got you more f**ked up
Than any drug can ever do
I don't hate you just what you do 

You think you've seen the light
You think you've seen the might
Lost inside a fake
Never wide awake
Open up your eyes
Look and see the lie
What's your greatest fear
Where do you go from here 

You think you've seen the light
You think you've seen the might
Lost inside a fake
Never wide awake
Open up your eyes
Look and see the lie
What's your greatest fear
Where do you go from here
