Every time I shut my eyes
I see that haunting face in my mind
Why do you torment my soul
See I'm trapped all alone
Is Jacob the chosen one
Angel of mercy
Living on, on the run

Shifting dreams that hypnotize
Despairing glances from his eyes
Spins the present to the past
Feeling every breath will be my last
Icy fingers feel so real
Touching my soul
He's me, I know

These haunting dreams
Never end
Tormenting nightly voice from the dead
These haunting dreams
Never end
Burned deep inside, inside my head
