Time calls to fight for their lives
We'll make a change in the world
The spirits alive
Take them, take them away
Far from this shame
Through years they've been led astray

Year of the witch
Darkness will fall
Year of the witch
Heroes will crawl

Sadness, sadness through lies
Twisting, tormenting
Blinding their eyes

Free them, unlock the chains
The steel that binds them
So helpless in pain

Can you hear them calling
Can you see them falling
I hear you calling
I see them falling
