Looking for a sign
Of how this all unfurls
Trying to do what's right
In this crazy world
Searching for the truth
Hiding from the pain
I know the answer's there
It's calling out my name

Can't find my way
Can't find

Traveling the unknown
Days becoming one
Endless nights fill my soul
Farewell rising sun
Just coincidence
Or just meant to be
Shadows of my past
If I could only see

Is it faith where I belong
All I can do is carry on
Endless journeys, the same old song
Choosing paths either right or wrong
