Judas Priest, The Maiden Band
Brought us to the promised land

Led Balloon, the Sabbath Boys
Cranked it up with metal toys

Thin Lizzy, Diamond Head
Ripped so hard it woke the dead

Metal Asylum

Motorhead, Slayer too
Paved the way for a Motley Crue

Ronnie James, and the Ozz
And the words for the world to see

Uriah Heep, Rose Tattoo,
The God Of Thunder, we fire for you.

It's heaven and hell, in this Metal Asylum,
you're under the spell
Metal Asylum

Scream for me Long Beach!
We love you all!
Does anyone remember that song?
Look at all the people out here tonight!

[Solo]

Dirty Deeds, B-O-C
Gave us all society

Highway Star, Creeping Death, Quiet Riot
Bang your head!

It's heaven and hell, in this Metal Asylum,
you're under the spell
Metal Asylum

It's heaven and hell, in this Metal Asylum,
you're under the spell
Metal Asylum

Asylum, asylum, asylum, asylum!
