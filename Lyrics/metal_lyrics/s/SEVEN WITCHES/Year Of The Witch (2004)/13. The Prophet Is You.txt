He's the one you dreamed of
A child with stoned face
Visions of clueness
Dreams of endless days
He's the one you've searched for
The one who holds the key
An angel of mercy you thought you'd never be

Now I see it was only me
Back then
Now I see it was only me

Dark sense that told you
His face was seen before
Connections of the past
Through every passing door
In terror yet content
You swallow what is true
Knowing who's the chosen
The prophet is you

Now I see it was only me
Back then
Now I see it was only me
I can see it's only me again
I can see it's only me
