I'm be deviled by the task that's laid before me
Gazing on it's beauty and what might have been
Path of repentance, walk in the line with the righteous ones
Is it forgiveness, betrayal or a sin??

In the garden two creatures by the bulrushes
Standing naked, lovemaking without shame
Damn the heavens, for I wish I could have cherished them
Now forsaken, they're pawns inside my game

I am false, you are ripe to be defiled

The tempter plots your doom
Beware her foolish pride
The seeds of hell will bloom upon your paradise

The serpent beckons with praise
Poison drips from it's forsaken tongue
In the realm of the wretched place
Temptation's hymn is sung

Seduced by knowledge and power
Enchanted by the two-faced lies
The innocence deflowered
Perfection destroyed with a bite
He now must mirror her fate
Vowing never to love another
Damnation her must taste
To be forever one with his lover

Wounded from below
Tortured eyes they cry at the cost
Nature sighs in woe
Your blessed world is lost

Cloud of fire
Unleash your scorching rays
Burning higher
Bring the end of days

Now, on cursed ground you will be bound
To live in pain, less than man you will remain
