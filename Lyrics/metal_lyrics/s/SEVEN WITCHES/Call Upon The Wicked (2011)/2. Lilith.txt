A serpent's heart beneath her smile
Under the veil, Medusa's eyes
A siren's song she sings at night
Seducing all good men to die.

Poison lips, they hypnotize
The widow spins hear web of lies

An evil witch, the fallen one
A demon's kiss with a forked tongue
The fabled whore of paradise
She sucks my breath, she takes my life

Fly(fly), Lilith fly(fly high), to the sky(sky)
Save my soul, Tormentor
