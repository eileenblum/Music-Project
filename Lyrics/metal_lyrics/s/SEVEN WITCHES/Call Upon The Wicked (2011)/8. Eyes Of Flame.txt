From the mist evil speaks
From the past voices call
Hatred in my eyes
In shadows I wait for prey
Emptiness, no remorse
In my stare demise

Black and blue
Blue and black
In my eyes of flame
Eyes of flame

Standing alone in darkness
Footsteps heard in black of night
Closing in on you
Such laughter to see you in fear
The look in your eyes that I crave
Oh my, deja vu

Black and blue
Blue and black
In my eyes of flame

When I look in your eyes
What do I see staring at me
I'm removing your soul
Turning to black, I'm in control
