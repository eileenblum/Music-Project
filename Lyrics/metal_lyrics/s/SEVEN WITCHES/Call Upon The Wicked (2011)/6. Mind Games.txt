You say it's love, I say it's lust
Dying in pain
You think we're one, I feel it's none
It's a mind game

That smiling face, like Judas' kiss
Burn you in flames
Heart of stone, blood is so cold
It's a mind game

They say forever, it should be never
Drive you insane
She sucks your breath controls your life
It's a mind game

Torment and lies between her thighs
It's a bloody shame
Hatred and sorrow is what she borrows
It's a mind game

Stop fuckin
Stop fuckin with
Stop fuckin with my head

See ya next Tuesday
