[Bonus Track]Weâre taking back the metal!

He decapitates the night
Resilient power, burning bright
Itâs coming round, you canât see
Metal tyrant slashing free
Kill, mowing down the line
For crying out loud of all mankind
Itâs time to mess with your mind
Shake you around, toss you aside

I know you feel it
And I feel it coming around
You do what you want to
But do what you say

Total destruction left behind
Spreading depris for miles around
Living heavy breathing man
Smiling, laughing so obscene
Searching for that heavy grind
Bang your head all in time
Growing army roaming free
A true flowing trapestry

I know you feel it
And I feel it coming around
You do what you want to
But do what you say

Metal tyrant, metal god, metal tyrant
Metal tyrant, metal god, metal tyrant
Metal tyrant, metal god
Metal tyrant, metal god, metal tyrant
Save yourself

Save yourself if you want to
Save yourself or simply fade away

I know you feel it
And I feel it coming around
You do what you want to
But do what you say

Metal tyrant, metal god, metal tyrant
Metal tyrant, metal god, metal tyrant
Metal tyrant, metal god
Metal tyrant, metal god, metal tyrant
Save yourself

Got to to save yourself
Got to to save yourself
Got to to save yourself
For godâs sakes, save your metal self!!
