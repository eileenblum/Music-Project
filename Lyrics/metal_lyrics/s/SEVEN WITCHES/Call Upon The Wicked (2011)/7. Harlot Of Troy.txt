Hiding inside the great place
Inside the thick wails of stone
We bring the vengeance and malice
To vanquish the queen and her thrown

Oh, hear our cry, she must die, swords on
high

Hey! We are! Silent assassins
Hey! We are! Silent assassins
Death to the Harlot of Troy

Demoness of the Agean
Soaking the blood from her hands
One thousand ships in harbor
To behead her on Trojan sand

Oh, hear our cry, she must die, swords on
high

Hey! We are! Silent assassins
Hey! We are! Silent assassins
Death to the Harlot of Troy

Inside this wood horse we all gather now
Let no man rest till she's found
Poseidon shall bless us, his trident will
strike
Straight to the heart as they sleep this
night

Burning the city to ashes
Apollo can not save them now
Helen, you'll suffer by stoning and lashes
Bringing your death we are bound

Hey! We are! Silent assassins
Hey! We are! Silent assassins
Death to the Harlot of Troy
