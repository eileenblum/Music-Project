Everyday you ignore the lies
Everyday, a fool in our eyes
Looking back on what used to be
Shattered dreams, shattered fantasies

Call upon the wicked
If it takes you high
Call upon the wicked
If it makes you higher

Twisting pain burning deep inside
Crucified behind your pride
Can't you see it's time to let it go
Can't you see it's time to end the show

Call upon the wicked
If it takes you high
Call upon the wicked
If it makes you higher
