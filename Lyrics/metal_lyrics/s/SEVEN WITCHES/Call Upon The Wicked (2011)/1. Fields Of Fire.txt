The rage is on
Atrocities to make a stand
Pain lives on
Why must they die to claim a land

Hear them calling
Hear them pray

Fields of fire, Fields on fire
Fields on fire
Watch them fall
Watch them die

They cry for peace
Blood of heroes has drenched the sand
Who pays the price
Who washes the blood from their hands

Hear them calling
Hear them pray

Fields of fire, Fields on fire
Fields on fire
Watch them fall
Watch them die

Fields of war, blood and Gore
Casualities of war
Reminisce, brothers missed
Death kiss

Kings and queens decide their fate
Death marching parade
From blood spilling masquerade
History is made

Fields of fire, Fields on fire
Fields on fire
Watch them fall
Watch them die
