And out of the darkness cometh
The snow and the FROST!
A season to tremble all the earth
A winter's scorn

Cities are torn asunder
As they light up the skies
In the unholy thunder
A goddess dies

See the scourge of the nothern land,
Ragnarok
Twilight of the Gods at hand, Ragnarok
See the dead lying by the shore, Ragnarok
The sands of time exist no more,
Ragna, Raganrok

The wolf is breaking from his bands
The serpent awakes
Loki joins with the wretched ones
To kill and forsake
Over the rainbow bridge they ride
For the frozen seas
To battle the gods of Valhalla
Blood and destiny

See the scourge of the nothern land,
Ragnarok
Twilight of the Gods at hand, Ragnarok
See the dead lying by the shore, Ragnarok
The sands of time exist no more, Ragnarok
Raganrok
