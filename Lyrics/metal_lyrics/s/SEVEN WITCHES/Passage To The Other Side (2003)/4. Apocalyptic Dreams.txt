[music: Jack Frost, lyrics: James Rivera]

Nightmares are creeping into my sleep
Showing the future becoming obsolete
Events predicted the coming tide
Prepare yourself to take one hell of a ride
Maddened, malicious march in the streets
Annihilate each other, no one defeats
Pushing the buttons, there goes the atmosphere
Apocalypse is waiting, it's all so clear

Natural catastrophies, starvation in the streets
Global warfare, world leaders will compete
Polar caps melt, planets collide in space
Another Ice Age wipes out the human race
Desolated planes, radiated lands
Rubble buried nations, blood in the sands
Blackened silence is all that remains
Wakering they see there is nothing gained

I see the stars are falling from the sky
I see the moon crumbling say goodbye

It's time to say goodbye, it's time to say goodbye
Say goodbye, it's time to say goodbye
Say goodbye, it's time to say goodbye
Say goodbye, it's time to say goodbye

I see the stars falling from the sky
I see the moon crumbling say goodbye
I see the sun fading, going black
The light of day is never coming back

It's never coming back, it's never coming back
It's never coming back
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world
