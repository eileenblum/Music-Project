[music: Joey Vera, lyrics: Jack Frost]

Take a gun and kill them all
Watch the pain inside them when they fall
Have no fear, you are God
Johnny controls the tornment for one and all

I'm the one you dream of
Dark hatred that they scream of
The one you want to be now
I'm alive inside you

Hey Johnny, ha ha ha ha

Taste the blood that's on your hands
Now your soul will reach the promised land
Denied the future, relinquish the past
Johnny's finally your master here at last

I'm the one you dream of
Dark hatred that they scream of
The one you want to be now
I'm alive inside you

Run run for your life now
Hide until the sun
Run, run from the night now
Until the morning comes

I'm the one you dream of
Dark hatred that they scream of
The one you want to be now
I'm alive inside you

Run run for your life now
Hide until the sun
Run, run from the night now
Until the morning comes
Run run for your life now
Hide until the sun
Run, run from the night now
Until the morning comes
Run run for your life now
Hide until the sun
Run, run from the night now
Until the morning comes
