[music: Joey Vera, Jack Frost, lyrics: James Rivera]

Rumbling in earth's core is a hellish revenge
River of fire flowing to burn and singe
As the fear runs through your heart
You see your world ripped apart

700 years of standing still
Activity pulse the fiery spill
A walking furnance, nothing stands in it's way
Scorching the earth, it's judgement day

Running and leaping from the jaws of death
No escaping from the fiery breath
Black mass hovers, everywhere in sight
Every living soul is filled with fright

700 years of standing still
Activity pulse the fiery spill
A walking furnance, nothing stands in it's way
Scorching the earth, it's judgement day

Terror striking your every path
Nowhere to turn from nature's wrath
Thanks to evil that men do
Hell's horizon welcomes you

700 years of standing still
Activity pulse the fiery spill
A walking furnance, nothing stands in it's way
Scorching the earth, it's judgement day

Terror striking your every path
Nowhere to turn from nature's wrath
Thanks to evil that men do
Hell's horizon welcomes you

Black mass hovers everywhere
Terrorizing in despair
In despair, in despair
In despair, in despair
