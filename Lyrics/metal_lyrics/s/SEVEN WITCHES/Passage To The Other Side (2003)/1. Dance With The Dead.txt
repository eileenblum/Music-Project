[music: Joey Vera, lyrics: James Rivera]

You have a heart of steel and a soul of fire
A distorted point of view
You were chasing a dream reaching for the stars
But you never followed through

Prepare yourself to take the fall
You'll feel the pain, you'll feel it all
You've slammed yourself against the wall
You made the choise, you made the call

Now you're running in circles, recalling what you had
It's enough to drive you mad
Your world has crumbled into unfit pieces
Delirious nomad

Prepare yourself to take the fall
You'll feel the pain, you'll feel it all
You've slammed yourself against the wall
You made the choise, you made the call

Dance with the dead
Lost in your head
Dance with the dead
Lost in your head

Put yourself on a road to a dead end
Put yourself where your voice was never heard
Put yourself where the walls are closing in
Your voice was never heard

Drowning in sorrow from time that you borrowed
No longer on your side
The spirit that moved you now at a stand still
Lost, the flame finally died

Prepare yourself to take the fall
You'll feel the pain, you'll feel it all
You've slammed yourself against the wall
You made the choise, you made the call

Dance with the dead
Lost in your head
Dance with the dead
Lost in your head

Put yourself on a road to a dead end
Put yourself where your voice was never heard
Put yourself where the walls are closing in
Your voice was never heard
