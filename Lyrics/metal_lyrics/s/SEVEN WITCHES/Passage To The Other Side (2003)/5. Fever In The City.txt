[music: Joey Vera, lyrics: James Rivera]

A calling came on that cold black day
That brought the plague that took their hopes away
Creeping through the streets gnawing mankind
A trail of death was all it left behind
Horrid eyes watched it bring their fate
Fever spreading it was much too late
Crying for salvation, the suffering had just began

Nothing could stop the killing disease
Nothing, no one can answer their please

Chaos, the madness, the sadness, despair
A bell is ringing in the village square
Smell of carcass from piles they made
Infected were laid to waste

Black death, the plague brought their demise
Screams of mercy hurled up to the skies

Pain was lingering around
Fever in the city
Heard the echoed moaning sounds
The Gods would show no pitty
Death was airbone everywhere
Fever in the city
It's a living nightmare
The Gods would show no pitty

Deadly infection, contamination
Deterioration of their lives

All of those who did not suffer fled in terror
As they watched loved ones slowly die, ending an era

Horrid eyes watched it bring their fate
Fever spreading it was much too late
Crying for salvation, the suffering was over and done

Nothing could stop the killing disease
Nothing, no one could answer their please

Pain was lingering around
Fever in the city
Heard the echoed moaning sounds
The Gods would show no pitty
Death was airbone everywhere
Fever in the city
It's a living nightmare
The Gods would show no pitty
