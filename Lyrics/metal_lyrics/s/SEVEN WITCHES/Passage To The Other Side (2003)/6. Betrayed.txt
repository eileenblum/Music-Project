[music: Jack Frost, lyrics: Brian Craig, Jack Frost]

My blood it turns to cold
As I open my eyes
I can see for the very first time
Your vast ocean of lies
I've given all
In a blind leap of faith
But hope is contricting
Your truths are restricting

My time's coming around

Dark eyes they burn me
As promise deserts
As I hang on for every word
Finally starting to learn
Eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
As vengeance fulfills me
Your lies they have ruled me, yeah

My time's coming around
You'll be going down

Betrayed like a wave on the ocean
And a knife in your back
Betrayed like love and devotion
And the Judas kiss
Betrayed like a wave on the ocean
And a knife in your back
Betrayed like love and devotion
And the Judas kiss
Betrayed

Betrayed like a wave on the ocean
And a knife in your back
Betrayed like love and devotion
And the Judas kiss
Betrayed like a wave on the ocean
And a knife in your back
Betrayed like love and devotion
And the Judas kiss
Betrayed, betrayed
