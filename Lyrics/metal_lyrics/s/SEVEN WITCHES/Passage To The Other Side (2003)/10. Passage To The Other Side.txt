[music and lyrics: Jack Frost]

Looking staring facing the world beyond
Seeking, searching where your soul has gone
I want to know where we go
When our bodies leave our soul
I wanna see what you see when you're staring back at me

Memories left behind seem to touch me everyday
Wondering what you're doing when you're gazing down on me
What do you see from above and the clouds overhead?
How do you feel when you see your life has faded away?

Why'd you have to go away?
I want you here today

Passage to the other side
Passage to the other side
Passage to...

You are the chosen the one to reach the stars so high
Peter's the angel on my side
Love and laughter is what you burned so deep in me
Friends and our family will always be a part of me

Now you've passed the final test
Now your heart and soul can rest

Passage to the other side

Trust and honor will always rule the road ahead
Your lust for life was one of your best qualities
No hatred, but forgiveness is how you lived your days and nights
The way you touched me made a better man out of me

I want to know where people go
When they cross the other side
Do you see what they must see
When they glance down at me?

Passage to the other side

I want to know where people go
When they cross the other side
Do you see what they must see
When they glance down at me?

Passage to the other side
Passage to the other side
Passage to the other side
Don't go, don't go
Passage to the other side
Why did you have to leave?
Don't go, don't go, don't go
