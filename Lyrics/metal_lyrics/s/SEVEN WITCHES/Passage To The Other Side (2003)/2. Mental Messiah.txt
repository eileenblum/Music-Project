[music: Jack Frost, lyrics: James Rivera, Jack Frost]

God, God in his own mind
Savior, savior he's not
Lord, Lord of corruption
Fools follow his plot
False prophet among us
Master of deceivers
Spawning his tormentors
Blind, his true believers

Wickedly desiring torture never seen before

Mind, mind controller
World dominator
Human exterminator
Evil is this dictator

Wickedly desiring torture never seen
Cleverly inspiring to carry out his scheme

Mental Messiah, Father of liars
Mental Messiah is creeping in your mind
Mental Messiah, one who conspires
Mental Messiah, evil so divine

Killing, destroying, laughing inside
Plotting, corrupting, a mastermind
Twisting, molding, recruiting the damned
Fiendish, planning, an unholy man

God, God in his own mind
Savior, savior he's not
False prophet among us
Fools follow his plot

Wickedly desiring torture never seen
Cleverly inspiring to carry out his scheme

Mental Messiah, Father of liars
Mental Messiah is creeping in your mind
Mental Messiah, one who conspires
Mental Messiah, evil so divine
Mental, mental, mental, mental
Mental Messiah
