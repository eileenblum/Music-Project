[music: Jack Frost, Joey Vera, lyrics: James Rivera, Jack Frost]

The great beyond will call on you when time is drawing near
It all seems just like a dream, your final days are here
The final chapter's written, the story has to end
You see your saga passing by, is this where it begins?

The great beyond has welcomed you into the unknown void
Where no one has come back to tell the secrecy employed
A master of the universe has written it this way
To fear our final chapter we live with day by day

Now close your eyes, soar through the night
The last horizon
Gripping your heart, what do you feel?
The last horizon
Taking your soul, what do you see?
The last horizon
I'd like to know, where do we go?
The last horizon

Now close your eyes, soar through the night
The last horizon
Gripping your heart, what do you feel?
The last horizon
Taking your soul, what do you see?
The last horizon
I'd like to know, where do we go?
The last horizon
