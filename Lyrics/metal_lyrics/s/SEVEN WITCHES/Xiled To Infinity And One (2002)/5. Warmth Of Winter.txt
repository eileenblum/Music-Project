The winds are blowing a change in time
Another season passing by
True test of who will stay or die
So cold but still life inside

You feel her
Sheâs crawling nearer
The warmth of winter
Sheâs creeping
Youâre lost within her
The warmth of winter, yeah

The constellations majestic course
Stargazing watching cosmic dance
Another season passing by
So cold but still life inside

You feel her
Sheâs crawling nearer
The warmth of winter
Sheâs creeping
Youâre lost within her
The warmth of winter, yeah

Can you feel it?
Yea, yea, the warmth of winter

The warmth of winter
Yes, the warmth of winter

You feel her
Sheâs crawling nearer
The warmth of winter
Sheâs creeping
Youâre lost within her
The warmth of winter, yeah

Can you feel it?
Yea, yea, the warmth of winter
