[Grim Reaper cover]

See you in Hell!!

Can I make you an offer
You can't refuse
I kept my eyes on you
Cause I tell you that you lose
And you can come with me
To a place you'll know so well
I will take you
To the very gates of Hell

See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell

Your choice's up then
How many sins can be yours
At my kingdom the final choice
Is yours!
You can take it any time that you need
Next thing I'll borrow
All you've got to do is bleed

See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
I'll see you in Hell

Come with me, I will take you to the very depths of your soul
And I'll make you burn

See you...see you in Hell
See you...see you in Hell

See you in hell!!

Can I make you an offer
You can't refuse
I keep my eyes on you
Cause I told you that you lose
You can come with me
To a place you'll know so well
Like I told you
At the very gates of Hell

See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
See you in Hell, my friend
I'll see you in Hell

Iâll see you in Hell
