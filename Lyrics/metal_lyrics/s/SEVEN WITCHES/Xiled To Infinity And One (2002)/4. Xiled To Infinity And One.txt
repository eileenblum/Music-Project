Now youâre walking by the lake
Thinking of the millions who are crying
For heavenâs sakes
Now youâre exiled to infinity

Canât you feel the tension
As it burns me up inside
Itâs just a feeling
That I have to scream out loud

Youâre banished from your country
Youâre banished from your family
Kicked out of religion
And your holy land

Awakened giant fearâs for real
Now youâll get it, mass appeal
Thereâs nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
And now youâre exiled to infinity

What you fear as it eats you up inside
To look over your shoulder
No matter where you go

Youâre banished from your country
Youâre banished from your family
Youâre kicked out of religion
And your holy land

Awakened giant fearâs for real
Now youâll get it, mass appeal
Thereâs nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
And now youâre exiled
Awakened giant fearâs for real
Now youâll get it, mass appeal
Thereâs nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
And now youâre exiled
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one

Now youâre standing alone
Watching the future turn into the past
Thereâs no turning back
Now youâre exiled to infinity and one

Awakened giant fearâs for real
Now youâll get it, mass appeal
Thereâs nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
And now youâre exiled
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
Exiled to infinity and one
