Part of your hatred that looms today
Little pieces of yesterday
Of what youâd like wished away
Little bits of yesterday
The haunting spirits caress
Feeling, clawing, rips your flesh
Of what you lost gone away
The little bits of yesterday
Little bits of yesterday

Youâre knocking on angerâs door
What are you looking for
Catastrophe surrounds us all
Venerable for a fall

The innocent bleed how long
Heading for a fall
Of what you lost, gone away
Little bits of yesterday
Revolution is calling, canât you hear
Guerrilla warfare spreading fear
Parts of your life blown away
Little bits of yesterday
Little bits of yesterday

Youâre knocking on angerâs door
What are you looking for
Catastrophe surrounds us all
Venerable for a fall

The innocent bleed how long
Heading for a fall
Of what you lost, gone away
Little bits of yesterday

Youâre knocking on angerâs door
What are you looking for
Catastrophe surrounds us all
Venerable for a fall

The innocent bleed how long
Heading for a fall
Of what you lost, gone away
Little bits of yesterday

Knocking, knocking on anger
Knocking on angerâs door
Knocking, knocking on anger
Knocking on angerâs door
Knocking, knocking on anger
Knocking on angerâs door
Knocking, knocking on anger
Knocking on angerâs door
