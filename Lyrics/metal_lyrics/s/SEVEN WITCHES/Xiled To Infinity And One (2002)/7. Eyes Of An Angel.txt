When you set your soul apart
Is it something that you canât go without, go without
Take a chance, a chance to see
Where life will lead a mystery, a mystery

Never rush, someday love will find you
Itâs in her heart and youâre looking for an angel
Eyes of an angel, with the fire down below
Eyes of an angel, with the wings of a dove

Make your life what you want
Preceed what otherâs say about or talk about
In your eyes I see a dream
Of what is and what will be, eternity

Never rush, someday love will find you
Itâs in her heart and youâre looking for an angel
Eyes of an angel, with the fire down below
Eyes of an angel, with the wings of a dove

Eyes of an angel, with the fire down below
Eyes of an angel, with the wings of a dove
