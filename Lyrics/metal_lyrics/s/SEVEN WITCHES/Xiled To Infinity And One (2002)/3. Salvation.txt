What is your salvation
What keeps you alive
Is it good intentions
That get tossed aside

Rise up lazareth miracles believe
That say that Jesus saves
But he hasnât gotten to me
Prize to the Nazarene
Godsent only son
Hung for all to see
Bleeding just for me

Bleed upon the Sabbath day
Rediculed by all
Born upon the Sabbath day
Head filled crown of thorns

Roosterâs crow, Judas kiss
Six pence to the pilot
Sent savior now taken down
To the hallowed ground
Prize to the Nazarene
Godsent only son
Hung for all to see
Bleeding just for me

Bleed upon the Sabbath day
Rediculed by all
Born upon the Sabbath day
Head filled crown of thorns
Bleed upon the Sabbath day
Rediculed by all
Born upon the Sabbath day
Head filled crown of thorns

What is your salvation
What keeps you alive
Is it good intentions
That get tossed aside
Do you speak in riddles
Of the dark and light
Or are you just here now
Begging for your life?
