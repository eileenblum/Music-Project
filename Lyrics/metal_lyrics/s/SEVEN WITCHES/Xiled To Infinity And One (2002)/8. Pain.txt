All you feel, you feel it, itâs all around
Watching you faulter, the eyes you burn
Said what you want, you said your peace
I donât want to hear it

The pain that you feel
Hope itâs bringing you down
The pain that you feel

What you want, I want it, give it to me now
Thatâs your problem, take care of yourself
You hypocrite, telling me to quit
Time and time again

The pain that you feel
Hope itâs bringing you down
The pain that you feel

I told you you were gonna feel pain

The pain that you feel
Hope itâs bringing you down
The pain that you feel
