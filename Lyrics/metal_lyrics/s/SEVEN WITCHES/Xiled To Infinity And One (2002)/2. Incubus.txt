Voices of the ages
Tempting minions of the night
The dark fortress rises above
Casting shadows to overcome

Haunted by the shadows
Of the lost souls who cry tonight
Begging for forgiveness
To be set free from these chains that bind them now

Deadly rapture condescending
In the veins of the chosen ones
Taking over good to evil
Fading faster dusk to dawn

Voices of the ages
Tempting minions of the night
The dark fortress rises above
Casting shadows to overcome

I see a dark fortress rising
Black plague for all to see
Hate more than the other
That thatâs your destiny
I can see a dark fortress rising
Black death for all to see
Kill more than the other
Then thatâs just blasphemy

Ride of your life
Taking you higher
As far as you want to go
Higher, higher
As far as you want to go
Higher and higher
As far as you want to go
Higher, higher
As far as you want to go

I see a dark fortress rising
Black plague for all to see
Hate more than the other
That thatâs your destiny
I can see a dark fortress rising
Black death for all to see
Kill more than just the other
Then thatâs just blasphemy

Take the ride of your life
Taking you higher
Where you want to go
Higher and higher
As far as you want to go
Higher and higher
Taking you higher
