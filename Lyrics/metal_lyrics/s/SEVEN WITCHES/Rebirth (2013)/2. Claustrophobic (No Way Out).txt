Trapped Inside A Room That's
Getting Smaller
Fighting To Control My Sanity
The Walls Begin To Close In
They Surround Me
In A Place I Don't Wanna Be
I Hear The Call Of The Voice Of Reason
But It Doesn't Ever Say A Word To Me

Paranoia Now My New Companion
Following Me Wherever I Go
Fear Of Suffocation Steals Another Breath
Something The Darkness Wants My Soul

The Fear Is Closing In (Hard To Breathe)
The Lights Are Going Dim (I Can't See)
The World Is Going Black (Scream And Shout)
It's Breathing Down My Neck ( No Way Out)

There's No Escape
Consumed By My Condition
Won't Someone Please Just Set Me Free
My Circumstance
A Mental Contradiction
My Fear Just Will Not Leave Me Be

There's No Escape
Consumed By My Condition
Won't Someone Please Just Set Me Free
My Circumstance
A Mental Contradiction
My Fear Just Will Not Leave Me Be

Help Me (Hard To Breathe)
Help Me (No Way Out)
