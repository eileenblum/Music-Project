Paralyzed
Staring Down At Bloodstained
Hands
Shadowing The Murdered Man
Mesmerized
In This Reality Happening
Can This Be Reality

There You Stand - All Alone

Solitude
There Is None To Be Found
In A Broken Mind
Like Shattered Glass
Shards Of Past Mistakes
Better Left Behind

There You Stand - All Alone
Forever Waiting
For The End To Come

Memories Seem Like Dreams
Noting Is What It Seems
You Stand The One Accused
Everything Points To You

Reaching Out
Looking For A Hope
But You're Running Out Of Rope

There You Stand - All Alone

Hang 'Em High
Your Paralyzed
Staring Down At Bloodstained
Hands
Shadowing The Murdered Man
There You Stand All Alone
Your Memories Are Not Your Own

Hang 'Em High [Repeat to end]
