We Are The Shadows Of This World
We Never Stops And We Will Never
Die
Are We Blessed Or The Cursed
A Million Lifetimes We Have Left
Behind

Soundlessly Moving Through
The Night
The Moon Is Rising And Hunger Calls
Wait For The Moment I Will Strike
I Feel The Crimson Flow Before You
Fall...

Under The Spell
That Takes You Ever Higher
Into A New Eternity
One Final Kiss
Succumb To My Desire
Embracing Immortality

Into The Night - My Thirst Is Rising
Ready To Strike When You Are Near
Hide From The Light - To Keep From
Dying
Your Flesh Grows Sweeter With Your
Fear

Under The Spell
I'll Take You Ever Higher
Into A New Eternity
One Final Kiss
Succumb To My Desire
Embracing Immortality
Immortality
In Noctem - Siti Mea Surgentem
Paratus Ferit Te Videri
Lux Latere - Ne Moriantur
Dulcescit Timore Tuo Carnes Tuas
