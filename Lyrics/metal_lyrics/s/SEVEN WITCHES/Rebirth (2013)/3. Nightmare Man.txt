Just Close My Eyes
You're Trembling In Fear
Your Courage Dies
When Darkness Brings Him Near

In Pools Of Sweat
You Lie Awake Again
Shaking Your Soul
The Nightmare Closes In
The Shadows Fall
And Terror Takes Its Toll
As Madness Works
Taking Control

They Come To Life
Each Time You Close Your Eyes
They Never Die
Just Fade At Mornings Light

Are You Missing Pieces Of Your Sleep
You'll Find Them In His Hands
Do You Pray The Lord Your Soul To Keep
Waiting In The Corner Of Your Dreams
You'll Find The Nightmare Man
You Give Life To Him With Every
Scream In The Night

Waiting In The Corner Of Your Dreams
You'll Find The Nightmare Man
You Give Life To Him With Every
Scream In The Night

(Here Comes The) - Nightmare Man
[4x]
