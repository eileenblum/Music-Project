Riding In A Dream
Hell Bent Upon Their Course
Charging Steeds Appear In
Blackest Night
Death And Suffering
A Bringing Of Despair
Slaying Every Victim Unaware...
Unaware

Messengers Of Doom
Called By The Seventh Seal
Shadows Bringing Panic When
They're Near
A Hurricane Of Hate
That's Spread Throughout The Land
In Darkness Unblessed Souls Bring
Only Fear

Famine Leave You In Dismay
Sickness Sucks Your Life Away
Blood The Price You Pay For War
Death The Final Score
Here Forever More
As His Hollow Eyes
Watch Your Spirit Die

The Horsemen (Ride Ride)
Four Riders (Ride Ride)
Denying (Ride Ride)
Your Future (Ride Ride)
Huh!

Famine Leave You In Dismay
Sickness Sucks Your Life Away
Blood The Price You Pay For War
Death The Final Score
Here Forever More
As His Hollow Eyes
Watch Your Spirit Die

Now Ride They Ride Now Ride [2x]
