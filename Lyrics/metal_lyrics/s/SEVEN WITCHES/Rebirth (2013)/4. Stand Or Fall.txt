If We Run Of Tomorrow
When Our Time Has Finally Passed
Are Your Memories Full Of Sorrow
Looking Back Upon Your Life Is It
Only Regrets

Stand Or Fall
Stand Or Fall

All Your Life Will Remember
Things That No One Should Forget
On Your Torch No One Should Forget
From The Pain Down Deep Inside
An Un-Payable Debt

Stand Or Fall
Stand Or Fall

Stand
Fight
Only Death Will Bring The End
Sand
Blood
All You'll Find

Soldiers Marching Off To War
Some Will Stand And Some Will Fall
But What Are They Fighting For
Now In Death They'll Be Remembered Forever
