Looking Away
As The World Falls To Ruin
Led To Believe
Hope Is Waiting Up Ahead
And Time Is The Thief
We Are Forever Fighting

Pushed Ti The Edge
Of Our Simple Understanding
While Our History
Is Repeating All The Lies

The Earth Is Slowly Dying
The Sky Forever Crying
Black Clouds Loom Overhead

Head First
Into The Jaws Of Damnation
Head First
Into The Belly Of The Beast

The Earth Is Slowly Dying
The Sky Forever Crying
Save Yourself
Save Yourself
Save Yourself
Before It's Too Late

Head First
Into The Jaws Of Damnation
Head First
Into The Belly Of The Beast
Head First
There's No Hope For Salvation
Head First
Into The Fires Of Hell

Head First
Into The Belly Of The Beast
Head First
Into The Fires Of Hell
