I believe that it's each to their own
Except when honor killings are the norm
Can't convince me
That offing your sister ain't wrong
Or your wife, or your mom
That's the point of this song
Inhumane tribal custom
I bid you so long

Even allegations are enough
For a man to commit murder
If a woman's accused of bringing dishonor
To the family name ï¿½ it must be restored
What a joke ï¿½ I would laugh but I'm full of rancor

Dishonor killings go unreported
Archaic, cruel and completely sordid

You bring disgrace ten fold of your family name

Dishonor killings go unreported
Archaic, cruel and completely sordid
