Alone...

When it's all good on your horizon
Seems you could never lose your tomorrows

Born into this world the same as you are now
Alone and crying
Squirming and sorrow

For you I grieve
Widows and orphans
I beg you, believe
Life's not always so wanton

Alone...

For you I grieve
Widows and orphans
I beg you, believe
Life's not always so wanton

I wish I could just hit return
And make your pain go away today
