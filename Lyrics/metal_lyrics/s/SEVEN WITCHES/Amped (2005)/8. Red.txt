Angel ï¿½ draped in crimson head to toe
Demon ï¿½ but you simply do not know

How long will your sad charade go on?
Realize you are the key to end it all
Hell boy, your destiny is just two locks away

Do it today
I beheld you and in your right hand:
The key to the bottomless pit

Red, red

Do it today
I beheld you and in your right hand:
The key to the bottomless pit

Hellboy...
