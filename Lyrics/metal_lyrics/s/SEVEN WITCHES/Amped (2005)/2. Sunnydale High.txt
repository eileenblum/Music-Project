You know the moon is full tonight
I'm guided onward by it's light
Down to Sunnydale
Because the hell mouth calls to me
It's god a pull you can't believe
Here begins my tale

And nothing's gonna stop my reign

I've got to take the slayer out
Burn her down without a doubt
She alone defiles
Because the world will end tonight
But not without a bloody fight
Listen to my lies

And now I'm getting high on death
Intoxicated with the thought of your last breath
And if you want to live your life in endless night
Just follow me on down to Sunnydale High

The gears of hate are turning
Forces of good are learning
That the end is near

So if you want to live your life in endless night
Just follow me on down to Sunnydale High

But best laid plans go oft away
And now I know I'm gonna die
Caught within her snare
So resurrect my darkened shape
And all the earth I'll surely rape
Chosen one beware

Sunnydale High, Sunnydale High
