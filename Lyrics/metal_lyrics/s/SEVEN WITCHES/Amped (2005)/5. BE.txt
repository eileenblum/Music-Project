Funny how the best thing in your life
Can be right in front of your eyes
Yet you are blind

Seems it was just a matter of time
Of fate and of surprise
For our hearts and minds

BE all, my end all, it's for you that I fall
BE, all that you are, my sunlight my shining star

Just when I had set sail on my own
You made yourself known
Look how we've grown

It shows you never know, when the window
Will open for two hearts, to make a new start

BE all, my end all, it's for you that I fall
BE, all that you are, my sunlight my shining star

Our love flows and grows
But I never saw it coming

Our love flows and grows
But I never saw it coming
