You've got a name that's grown
Beyond the person that you are
It's so big it swells your head
So big it gets you off

I used to have such blind faith
In the justice system here
But with each fame
Filled trial I see, I feel a growing fear
The facts should make it obvious
But juries stare star ï¿½ struck
I stare in disbelief, dumbfounded and awestruck

Fame

I'm not impressed by anyone
No not anymore
When Mr.Orange Juice can rush one
Last yard out the door
Jacko jackin' children off is just beyond belief
Acquit him just like Mr.Blake
Set filth loose on the streets

Fame gets you off
The fame gets you off

Fame gets you off
The fame gets you off

So high on yourself ï¿½ you float above the law
