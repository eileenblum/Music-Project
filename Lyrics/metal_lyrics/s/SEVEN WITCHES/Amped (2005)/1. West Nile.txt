Uganda 1937
First brought to light
West Nile ï¿½ our vengeance from the heavens
Death soon takes flight

Sending millions of Minions of terrorism
Spread the infection

In the path of god they fly out
Headed for the west
Infected blood destroys the godless
Right in their nests

Sending millions of Minions of terrorism
Spread the infection

Meningitis
Encephalitis
Spinal chords and brains swell
Kill every last infidel

Sending millions of Minions of terrorism
Spread the infection

West Nile...
