It's getting closer to the point where I might hide myself away
It's getting deeper, this wound you've
inflicted upon me
Poison memories among scarlet tears
The blood runs cold now as I face my
fears

You - You told me once before that I
was the world to you
But now - Now you've proven to me
there's nothing left to do

Burned - I've been burned alive by
your torture and your hate
Sin - The only sin I fear must now
become your fate

Torn - I've been torn apart so long now
I must act
Death - Now only death becomes my
tool
To send you back

Why must I do this thing?
Why can't you see I'm...

Getting closer to the point where I
might hide away
Getting deeper this wound you've
inflicted upon me
