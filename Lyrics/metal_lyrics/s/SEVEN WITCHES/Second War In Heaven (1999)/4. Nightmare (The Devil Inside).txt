I've got this feeling and it just won't go Some dark intention in my mind you know
I walk these streets with madness on my mind
Stay far away and don't you look behind

Cold dreary morning got no stars in my eyes
Strayed from the pack now hear the hungry wolf cry
Just passing through you'd better step aside
Because if you don't you will be taken for a ride

[Chorus:]
Nightmare - trapped inside
Nightmare - Look into my eyes
Nightmare - Hear the children cry
Nightmare - Got the devil, got the devil inside

As I take you by the hand
I'm sure that you'll understand
Come child I've got something for you
You'll see the world and more before we're through

[Chorus]
