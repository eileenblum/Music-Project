In an age of wonder where magic was so real
Knights stood brave with honor
brandishing their steel
As we heed our call to arms the
message comes so clear
To protect the land we love we must
never fear

[Chorus:]
Searching for a place for us to right all our wrongs
Courage, honor, bravery have made us
all so strong
Now we feel the power as we ride into
the night
Nothing that can stop us we will
forever fight for Camelot

Now we heed the battle cry we let our
freedom ring
Fighting for the truth and light and the
one who would be king
As he drew the sword from stone they
fell unto their knees
To purge the land of dragons fire and
destroy evil and greed

[Chorus]

Welcome to Camelot evil will rule us
not welcome to Camelot
Fighting, Killing, Raging, Attacking,
Destroying, Defending the land
love
called Camelot

Welcome to Camelot evil will rule us
not welcome to Camelot, welcome,
welcome, welcome my friend to Camelot
