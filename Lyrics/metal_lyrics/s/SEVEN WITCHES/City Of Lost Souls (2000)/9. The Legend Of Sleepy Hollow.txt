He rides the night like a shadowy bat
He seeks his next victim a crazed maniac
His steed is a demon equine made of hate
When you hear his gallop it shall be too late!

Beware! Beware the headless man!
Take care! Protect your neck my friend!

Through the fog you now approach your doom
The headless rider as cold as the tomb
You were warned not to travel this path
Now it's your turn to feel his wrath!

Beware! You are part of his plan!
Take care! Soon you shall meet your end!

Run run for your life - soon the blade lifts to strike
The death bell starts to toll - you must protect your soul!

The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
A tale told to chill your bones
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
your head will soon be his own

Through the doors you run now in vain
In pursuit is the rider insane
His blade held high shine sin the moonlight
Your head comes off and then rolls out of sight!

Run run for your life
Beware, beware the night...
