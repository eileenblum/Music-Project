Where is it that our souls are laid to rest?
Is there life after death, an afterlife, where we reunite with our family and friends?
Do we go to a place far better than where we are now?
Do we meet the One who created the flesh and bone that was to become each and every one of of us, the One who breathed life into veins?
Do we live in peace with the ones we love and the ones who love us?
These are the questions we ask ourselves.
We pray that these beliefs become truths, and that we may finally know...
