We are the ones that you come to discover
You shall witness the truth
Bathed in moonlight we praise the earth mother
Soon you shall have your proof

We are the ones who rejoice the earth's power
Nature is our true friend
Our deeds of flesh will excite one another
We reach an orgasmic end

Feel the time start to slip away
To the ancient ones we will pray
Feel the power of the night as you join our Coven
Raise your face to the midnight sun
Now the ritual has begun
Taste the elixir of life as your enter the Coven

We are the ones who give praise to the moonlight
We embrace the night wind
We speak the tongue of the Old Ones before us
We are void of all sin

We sing praise with the Ancient Ones mantras
To them we owe a true debt
To learn the ways of the Magic Ones powers
How could we ever forget

We are pure we are natures force
Timeless souls void of all sin
We are Seven and our souls unite
Timeless spirits void of ills

We are the Coven
Born of the Seven
We are the Coven
We shall never fall
