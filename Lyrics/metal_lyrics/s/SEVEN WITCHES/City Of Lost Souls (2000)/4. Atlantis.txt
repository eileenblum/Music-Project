Deep within the oceans depths lies a sight
you must behold
Time and time again the tale is told
A super race of human kind light years beyond us all
then disaster made the greatest city fall

See them racing towards the end
For them the sun won't shine again

Once this place was paradise before the great flood came
Man and beast in harmony the same
Waters edge now rises high, the time to flee is here
All their lives it's what they've learned to fear

Oceans of time will call into the night sky dying
Now hear the spirits cry, the great Atlantis rising
Oceans of time will fall into the black depths crying
Now feel the spirits fly - the great Atlantis rising!

Many seek the city lost to see if it was true
Not just some bedtime tale once told to you
A massive grave beneath the sea is all that now remains
An Atlantean escape was made that day

See Atlantis rising
See Atlantis rising
See Atlantis rising - rising!
