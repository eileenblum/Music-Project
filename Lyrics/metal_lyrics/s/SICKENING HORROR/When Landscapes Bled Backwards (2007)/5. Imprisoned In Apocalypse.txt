Do you have the courage?  The courage to ask the unborn
if they ever want to enter the devilish hell disguised as this world
And with nauseating demons surround each other
and simply refered as 'humans'

Restrain the outbreak of these thoughts
This game is fake therefore has failed

To confront eternity in ecstatic solitude
helpless and weak where you only can
create a god, hate the god, erase the god
and drown deep into oblivion

Restrain the outbreak of these thoughts
This game is fake therefore has failed

Pray for the day earthly eyes will collapse

The saviours will bleed one thousand deaths
and the wolves will be cheated by lambs
The random observers searching for signs
will demolish the statues of faith
