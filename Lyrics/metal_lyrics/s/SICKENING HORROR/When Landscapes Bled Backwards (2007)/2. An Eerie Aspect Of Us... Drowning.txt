It's staring at you with an expression far from natural
But could you expect something less than a sick sense of irony?

Breathe the years where only art could be abstract
Shred the fears to slit the ocean filled with sores
It was that time of June when suddenly screamed the velvet waters

Words of grace were swimming in a lake of hate
Play not vain and hold on to a life deranged
Oh sweet sickness in me explain my tragedy, prevent my madness

I'll share with you my dead sentimental bodies
An eerie aspect of us... drowning

I could wish for a brighter sun,
but that would be the curse to my reprisal

It always feels like a deathly song
without stars, without chances to regret
It always sings like a silent crow
The blackest wings to embrace our trivial lives

Breathe the years where only art could be abstract
Shred the fears to slit the ocean filled with sores
It was that time of June when suddenly screamed the velvet waters

I'll share with you my dead sentimental bodies
An eerie aspect of us... drowning

I could wish for a brighter sun,
but that would be the curse to my reprisal
