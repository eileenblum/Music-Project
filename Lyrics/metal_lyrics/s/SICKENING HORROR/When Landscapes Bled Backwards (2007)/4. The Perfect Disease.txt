Is this all you ever dreams?  A wicked swan?
Is this all you ever asked?  A perfect disease?

So you compromise to the jester's demands
As the wise man predicted the places invert
Retrieve the essence with the grace of a lunatic
It's terrifying even for the oldest tree

Is this all you ever raped?  Beside your own life?
Is this all you ever wanted to heal?

So you compromise to the jester's demands
As the wise man predicted the places invert
Retrieve the essence with the grace of a lunatic
It's terrifying even for the oldest tree

You fool!  You miserable fool!
Look at you!  You're made of hatred!

How did it cross your mind that
someone would care about this virus?
How did it cross your mind that
someone would greed such emptiness?

So you compromise to the jester's demands
As the wise man predicted the places invert
Retrieve the essence with the grace of a lunatic
It's terrifying even for the oldest tree
