Observe anything that's real and watch them bleeding
A delicate request only to make me safe
What a shivering attempt!  I'll try again if it kills me
Is this everything supposed to be what really is?

Just another loss, just another fade
To match the pieces and complete my grave
Just another drop, just another break
To mix the senses and deceive their pain

Forsake my thoughts, forsake my life, forsake my eternal bleeding
Once I believed there was time exposed in maelstrom
Forsake my thoughts, forsake my life, forsake my eternal bleeding
Once I conceived the prevention of this dead zone

Just another loss, just another fade
To match the pieces and complete my grave
Just another drop, just another break
To mix the senses and deceive their pain

Observe anything that's real and watch them bleeding
A delicate request only to make me safe
What a shivering attempt!  I'll try again if it kills me
Is this everything supposed to be what really is?

Forsake my thoughts, forsake my life, forsake my eternal bleeding
Once I believed there was time exposed in maelstrom
Forsake my thoughts, forsake my life, forsake my eternal bleeding
Once I conceived the prevention of this dead zone
