Dusted sickness to unlock the box of deranged
minds, that died in their own wrong reflections
Abyssal senses rotate within their minds
Decomposing skin-walls surround the vast embrace
of delicate misthoughts entering the crypts
where nauseating creatures reveal the sight of death

Dark one surreality - Transmit serenity
Cursed to return and heal this rotted vacancy
Dark one surreality - Diseased complicity
Cursed to return and feel the streaming energy

As I behold the cosmic graveyard filled with hate and decay
from all the sickened souls that haunt the dead,
I watch the spiral suns turning black and grim
to set the universe under surveillance
