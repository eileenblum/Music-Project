Another dead, who's dead?  I guess I never know,
into the maze of this neurotic biochemical device

Drowning in the midst of creativity - Excess of hate
A disguise to impress all the distracted - Six failed attempts
Decimal transfer of schematic hologrammes to prevent contempt
Grey scenes to display which memories crept

Graves - For each process that ended in monstrosities
Graves - To drain this waste for the subconscious to relish
Explore this wasteland to release the joy of those tragedies
Explore this swamp to regain obscure emotions

Subjective memories of loss buried
in the cryptic chasm of all the pictures
rotting in this flooded chamber,
fabulous in its dramatic dismay

Keep rotting in this flooded chamber,
fabulous in its dramatic dismay

Graves - For each process that ended in monstrosities
Graves - To drain this waste for the subconscious to relish
Explore this wasteland to release the joy of those tragedies
Explore this swamp to regain obscure emotions
