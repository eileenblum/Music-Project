Death is not as scary as the abyss itself
Face the riddle with visions of disharmony

What is concrete? Nothing . Chaos and infinity
sound so sickening and they end in horror
where the absolute nothing prevails

Searching for the end, a star is decomposing
a constellation bleeds , all dimensions turn black
The Deathness overwhelming, this awful noise
engraves the universe
