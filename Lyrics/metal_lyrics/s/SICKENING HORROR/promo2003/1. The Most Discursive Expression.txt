Strain as result of sickness
leads pain to a final end
This introvert scar unexisting pretends

Burn this place down never to
remind us terrible memories
From which our previous times of death
say nothing, moving in reverse

Observing unwelcome, uglifying signs
throughout the exterior of a universe
so distorted that overcame its collapse

What seems to be an everlasting suffering
feeds from creations cursed to discriminate
and despise the ones they greed

Desperate thoughts they dwell and feed
like parasites. Invalid sense for nobody to taste

Proverbs of certain dislikes canât describe
the nameless shame of such decay
