Ignorance surrounds the darkest
of all fates to come
Just like the taste of a snowless winter
in Hateâs frozen land

All the dreams were covering this life
could not forget those countless times
of emotional decay

Disabled to terminate the side-to-side
walk across the bridge of sanity and insanity

Madness arrives slithering in pain
Only despise remains to expand self-hate

Are you sick of this? Itâs interrupted while
conscience recovers from abnormal urge
in which revives
The smell of sadness is so cold
Ever since I last tried to understand
Inside me there is nothing you can see
