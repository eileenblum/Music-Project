The star was fading
Its planets slowly degraded to dust
The lurking black hole was ravenlously
consuming all of the system's life forms

For the first time in centuries
After millions of lightyears
The chief commander faced the abyss within the abyss
He beheld the end of the cycle

The mothership went full speed ahead
Grasping this last chance to take the huge leap into the ancient portal
This final chance to reverse the flow of time and transform the end to a beginning

The coordinates were accurate
The willpower was strong
The training was finally about to pay off
That loop was completed
The sound of phasing inverse was vast like a hundred supernovas

The star was reborn anew to live again!
The crew cheered in joy to celebrate the evasion of the great void!
A new circle opened

Flowing into eternity
Flowing above and below
