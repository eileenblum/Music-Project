It has become a monster many times
The road once followed led to point blank
Doubted, questioned, only to keep wondering and wondering again

The hardest part was to balance
now that the waterfall has run dry

What virtue would it take for the true rays of sunshine
to cast their omnipotent presence in a simple context of desire?

To become what someone is not
To break through the limitations of the vessel acquired
Even though it is not the vessel, but the cascade within
that drives the possibilities of becoming

Of becoming the lives that were never lived
That will never be lived
It was never too late but as late as ever
Time was never the issue

What virtue would it take for the true rays of sunshine
to cast their omnipotent presence in a simple context of desire?
