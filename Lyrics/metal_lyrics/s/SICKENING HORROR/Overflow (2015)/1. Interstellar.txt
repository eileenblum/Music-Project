We came from the stars
We shall return to the stars
The in between time we call life
And what if we were to take life beyond the stars?
What if we are already beyond the stars?

Imperceptible bliss
Across an empty universe
A paradise lies obscure

As soon as the bridge is discovered
Within and without the illusion
The seer awakes in redemption
In a place where now is forever
Where matter, matters no more

In the cosmic ocean of eternal present
We drowned the future
We buried the past
And what a glorious time it was!
The highest task to unveil the highest
Self

Interstellar dreamers unite and gather
Enraptured from beyond
Interstellar destination
Ever to be returned to

Interstellar dreamers unite and gather
