It happened again
The wanderer, the lost, the demented
all gathered once more to contemplate upon the loop of patterns

All the vectors were there
The numbers and figures kept marching on and on
To pave the way for the eternal flow
To give form to it all

The maze kept repeating itself perpetually
That they had forgotten how they had even entered in the first place
But the breach was still there somewhere

Was there any chance that this could be a limbo after all?
Most definitely not
This relentless spiral repetition resembled only hell

Fractal maze - a passage to a life beyond
Fractal maze - is lurking concealed
Fractal maze - enchanting travelers
Fractal maze - through tunnels of dreams

The breach was still there somewhere

Fractal maze - a passage to a life beyond
Fractal maze - is lurking concealed
Fractal maze - enchanting travelers
Fractal maze - through tunnels of dreams

The breach was still there somewhere
