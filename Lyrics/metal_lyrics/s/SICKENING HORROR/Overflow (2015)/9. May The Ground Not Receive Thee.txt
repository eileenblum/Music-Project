And I beheld the gate of the final release
But how could infinity end?
Endless years I walked the line within the twilight
Where time was never conceived (nor space)

The ladder is as ever was
The ship floats as ever did
The key is long discovered now to be applied

May the ground not receive thee
May the ground not receive thee

The serpent roared, long awakened, in glorious manifestation
The walls of the worlds were crashed and rebuilt
To bind the imprints of the soul forever

Nowhere to be found was the fear of the unknown
Overflowing was the lust to dream, to dream eternally
