The day the worms became kings
A sign of a world imploding

The day the worms became kings
A glimpse of a world collapsed

From day one the purpose was clear
Survival of the fittest would be the whole of the law
and that equilibrium would last throughout the millennia

Bring forth the flood to wash away this plague
Reveal the way to conjure the form of reason

No one could foresee that the tables would turn
Abominable pieces of low-life claiming the throne
For when humans try to play god is loathed
but when gods try to play human is the worst scripture of mockery

Bring forth the flood to wash away this plague
Reveal the way to conjure the form of reason

From day one the purpose was clear
Survival of the fittest would be the whole of the law
and that equilibrium would last throughout the millennia
