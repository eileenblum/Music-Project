The play was set perfectly
All the actors were there
With their fancy little costumes
and their fancy little minds
A flawless paradise

The stage was immense
A cage without end

Though your average viewer
would only focus on the field of a sand grain
and clap his hands in ignorant bliss

The stage was immense
A cage without end

Still, there is time for a choice to be made of life and death
Red or blue? Choose wisely and the curtain falls

Then the real world comes straight into experience
Red or blue? Choose wisely and the curtain falls
