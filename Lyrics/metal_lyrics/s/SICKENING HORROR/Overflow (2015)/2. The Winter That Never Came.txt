The lighthouse shed its light for so long
through storms and mists and tempests and maelstroms
The lava of agony devoured the last resorts of sanity
but the winter of deliverance never came

Waiting in shores uncharted through the swirls of time
Casting the spells of dis to evade the great divide

That winter never came...
That winter never came...

All seemed lost
The challenge of acceptance of fate was harsh
Not knowing if it would last a moment or an eternity
Not knowing that it was the same all along

Waiting in shores uncharted through the swirls of time
Casting the spells of dis to evade the great divide

That winter never came...
That winter never came...

At the utmost moment of surrender
In the final throes of admitting defeat
Enlightenment stroke like a cyclone from beyond
That winter never came because that winter was always here
