At last the time was near
I've felt my head exploding one thousand time
I've heard the universe within roaring and vibrating relentlessly

I grabbed my hand to pull me out
Floated through these concrete walls
Ascended to the roof top
Stared down the void
And jumped without hasitation

Vertigo is peaking
It's time to leave the body

Flying through the night sky
With tremendous speed

Vertigo is peaking
It's time to leave the body

The anchor was not there at all
There was only a point infinite

I was on my way to the golden age
To the time where the night of magic happened
When joy flooded the awareness of it all
