24 Januaries
24 triumps in madness

Gathering all the segments of wrath to project the circle of pride
on a wall of lustful, discreet emptiness and slothful distractions

Reveal the dreadful acts of essence redefined

24 Januaries
24 triumphs in sorrow

Always face the most relentless judges in my very own court
I sentenced myself to death so many times that I became immortal

Possess the crest to rejoice in continual rest
Regress never aged, rotate to reform infinite rage
Replace the waste with modes of internal arrays
Progress in the maze to behold the infernal shapeless

The gates of chaos opened wide, the infinite stairs above
the cries of the undeserving, the crimson destination
shall manifest the collapse, shall manifest the ascension

Possess the crest to rejoice in continual rest
Regress never aged, rotate to reform infinite rage
Replace the waste with modes of internal arrays
Progress in the maze to behold the infernal shapeless
