They were born on the feast of the weak
They revealed the repulsion of things
They were spread like a deadly disease
They corrupted the chambers within

It was foretold, it was imminent
that tragic deaths would be held for them
They were the children of the swamp
Their sickness would be ceased
They had no place to run
Their resources had been sealed

They were trapped in the fields of deceit
They were fooled by a marvelous treat
They were slaughtered with bestial conceit
Their cadavers were burnt underneath

Sane existence, sane collapse

It was foretold, it was imminent
that tragic deaths would be held for them
They were the children of the swamp
Their sickness would be ceased
They had no place to run
Their resources had been sealed

Sane existence, sane collapse
Their remembrance has withered
Their extinction was not mourned
