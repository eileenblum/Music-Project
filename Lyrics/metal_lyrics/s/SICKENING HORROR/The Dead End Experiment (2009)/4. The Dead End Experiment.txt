Once I tried to arrest the shievering screams of the mind
Paralysed with fear, devoted to promising acts so blind

Dramatize all this flowing lust, reach the depths of splendor
Ever-enchanting corridors spilling beauty in our dreams

All of a sudden the scenery drowned into
a lake of astral worms to claim their alchemy
Regardless the consequences of tresspassing their resorts,
we sing our putrid hymns to flatter their decay

Driven through the scent of scars once defeated
On the smell of sadness' frost still addicted
Searching for the way to crawl through the nailed eyes
Entering the cells of drones

Once I tried to arrest the shivering screams of the mind

I watched seas of myself devouring the waves of life, terrified
I stepped out of what seemed to be the right reflection in the mirror

All of a sudden the scenery drowned into

Driven through the scent of scars once defeated
