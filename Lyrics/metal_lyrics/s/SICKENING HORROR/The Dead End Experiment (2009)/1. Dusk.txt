The end for day has come, the night arrives it's dusk
Right in between we dig our way outside
To achieve the perfect match of black and white in mind
Forever we're unleashed in disguise

Vortex-skies rip out the sun
Out of nothingness, here before and ever after
Cosmic tides flooding the wise old significance
Here before and ever after

We are the sleepless ones
The secrets of the seal in blackness we reveal
Through balance we eytinguish all fear

Vortex-skies rip out the sun
Out of nothingness, here before and ever after
Cosmic tides flooding the wise old significance
Here before and ever after

When the dream has overcome
the limitations of space
a blink becomes eternity
The wishes for the sea rain inside to be drained,
reversed and spread upon infinity
The vault beyond is no more a doorway-shut, sharing the above
