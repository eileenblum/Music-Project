Every time I scream, ever time I dream, the expression is the same
All the things I've seen, all the scenes I've killed, re-appear in shapeless being
To explore this scheme, to exceed in need, the reaction to fulfill
As I'm drowning deep, as I reach the peak of the crystal surface

That thing is there, watching
Perceptive eyes, staring

I have seen the rivers of a raging paradise
where the waters fall relentlessly and shatter the demise
to the endless possibilities we're trying to perceive
and observe the universal noise shedding into dreams

Surrounded by infinite voices, but no faces
And they speak of pain and they scream in vain
They are dreaming in their graves
It is time to leave, it is time to feel the internal impulse

Abysmal truths, rising
The cosmic gates, showing

I have seen the rivers of a raging paradise
where the waters fall relentlessly and shatter the demise
to the endless possibilities we're trying to perceive
and observe the universal noise shedding into dreams
