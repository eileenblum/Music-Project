Everything slowly becomes a tortured parody over-depraved
A canvas of quilt with no artist to paint the colors of dread
The scary abstract themes return to feed the need
To render the face of a boundless, incipient void

Cease the silence of streaming, obscene mediocrity
Eavesdrop the murdered silence
Bleed the silence of hateful, erosive conformity
Behold the murdered silence

Fractals rise to swirl and devour all the blank seeds
Mind flows strive and burst into the orbital fields of nil

Why the teardrops anyway?
Why the subway signs?
Why resisting heredity?
Why exposing the relevance?
