There's a line
There's a line getting crossed
Getting crossed really often
And sometimes that's fine
And sometimes that's sick
And sometimes death gets dressed
fancier than a little boy

Set for unspeakable frights
Draped in dark delights
Twisted reverence
Rise to unthinkable heights
Feed this crazed abyss
Twisted elegance

Dressed in madness
Sheer awareness

Set for unspeakable frights
Draped in dark delights
Twisted reverence
Rise to unthinkable heights
Feed this crazed abyss
Twisted elegance

Did you see my clothes?
To keep them clean would betry my rats in the cage
But to drench them im madness...
is something my grey little friends would approve

Dressed in madness
Sheer awareness

Step inside the fragments of eternity
Without regrets without compassion
Fade the beams of disgusting compromise
Zero the restraint in the shivering dream time
