It's another glimpse, another echo in the background
where oblivion equals death, remembrance equals life
Lucid awareness conducts this orchestra of dreams
that surround and drill the cortex of existence

Mirrors reflect only dead bodies
When was the last time you saw a god over it?
Mirrors reflect only dead bodies
It is my fantasy, it is your reality

When heavens' light has ended, the time is perfect for the march
When darkness reigns in silence, the burst of life reveals the sight
When pools of blood are empty, the elevation has begun

Underground is the source, buried deep, yet so close
And everything soulless flows in the sea of eternal loss
The never ending descent to the sweetest void inside the coil,
extends this bitter walk in the cold

Mirrors reflect only dead bodies
When was the last time you saw a god over it?
Mirrors reflect only dead bodies
It is my fantasy, it is your reality
