Waiting... Standing... Revealing me keys from my past
With hands deadly cold and frequencies yet unborn

I stare infinity, in a vast abyss I draw all hatred
I seek the purity of thought in vails of sickness
I dream the lands of dark mater in a restless sleep
I feed the beast with senses inconceived

Wailing... Creating... Preventing emotional murder
To crash and merge misery and bliss

I stare infinity, in a vast abyss I draw all hatred
I seek the purity of thought in vails of sickness
I dream the lands of dark mater in a restless sleep
I feed the beast with senses inconceived

Watch them, they're trapped in the cage of their own fake corpses
Blessed not, condemned to relive their loathsome delusions
Flesh seems to dominate with monarchy, although it greets decay, it yearns to fade away
In constant visions of burial, bring dust inside the cage, bring dust inside the cage
