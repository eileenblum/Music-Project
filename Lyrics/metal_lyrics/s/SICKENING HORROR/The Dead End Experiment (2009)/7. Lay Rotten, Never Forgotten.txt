You thought you killed all the screaming birds
It's true, the guard pushed them deep in their graves
After all these years of noise effects
it came collapsing everything to silence

Still there is this charm,
cast from the tombs of memory repulsions

In this abyss of obituaries,
I can't help but rejoice in bliss
If it was not for these massive deaths,
the brightest star would never get to shine

Still there is this charm,
cast from the tombs of memory repulsions

Suffer all the way â Retrieve the spectrum of decay
Suffer all the way â Where the deepest mountain lies
Desensitize and carbonize the fragments of a thousand cries
Desensitize and carbonize with utter ease and power supreme
