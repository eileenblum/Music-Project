Is the clouds of gray
In the realm of sea
Lies a mourning forest
Crysten fade in gray

It's dweller's had lifted
No birds chirp in it's clouds 
The whispering roars of the wind
Had left it no sound

Well these years gone by
The forest fell asleep
Remembering elder days
The sewers driven deep

When the sky wasn't gray
And the sun was black
But it's time to face the truth
Those days will never come back

Over the centuries
The forest passed away
The well callen roads survived
To rise when times would change
