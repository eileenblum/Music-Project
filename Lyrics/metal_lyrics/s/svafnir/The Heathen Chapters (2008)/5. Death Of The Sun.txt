Silence, before the storm,
The lest someoneâs to shine,
A killing burst
Into the cold.
Each black fight.
A doomed
Shall rise upon
In this forsaken world.
Death will rule us all - 
The force of the Cold
Humanity is lost and gone
This barrowed world is fake. 
As those Sun will rise again
Earth and no Sun,
There was a chaos.
