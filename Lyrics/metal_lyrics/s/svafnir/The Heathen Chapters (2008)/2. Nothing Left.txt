Oh, youâve left me,
Out in the cold,
Oh, God, I see,
So, near, I am in the down,
Staring in to the void.
I see a light at the end
Of atonement so near

Oh, a cold us left a soul,
I seek the light.

Whatever if, I fly the light
Now I see.

I awake, to replace unknown,
Rounded by the light,
Far away I have the life.
