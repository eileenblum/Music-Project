[The Divine Speaker:]
We've come through this journey
to find out the truth...
But it's inside us the Evil
we must destroy!
So let us find in our heart
the God we are searching

[The Unknown Spirit:]
But how can we find
what has been lost for so long?

[The Divine Speaker:]
Ah...Ah...The answer you are looking for,
you will find...
In the Dragon's Secrets!
