[Lady Of The Light:]
White Warrior?

[White Warrior:]
Yeah, I'm here!

[White Warrior:]
This is the time to realize
This is the way to go
Riding The Ivory Stormwind
I will penetrate the fog

[The Divine Gladiators:]
We'll never find the answers
To the eternal fire
The wizard knocks to my heart

[White Warrior:]
'Cause I just want to meet some angels
'Cause we don't want to lose the truth

Captured by the dark
The Battle is going to start
Don't you be afraid? We stay among the stars

So trust in me and you will see, over the
rainbow, our God can fill our dreams
The Cross will sign the prophecy while we are
fighting among the clouds

[White Warrior:]
I want to know the Holy Ghost
I'll stick to my magic gun
Music is guiding my adventure
Mankind is needing God

[The Divine Gladiators:]
We really want to do it
It will be so easy
This melody is a winner

[White Warrior:]
This is the last day in which we find
The Endless power of our love
