[White Warrior:]
In the darkest night I see the Heaven is falling.
In the darkest night
I'll raise my flag over me
In the darkest night I'll walk the path of our
glory. In the darkest
night there is a fire that burns with my dreams

[The Divine Gladiators:]
In the darkest night (x4)

[White Warrior:]
I see the time has come
Will you possess the truth?
I will fight for our glory!
My heart is ready to explode...

[White Warrior:]
Northern world is next to Hell, the Assassin of
the Darkness now is ready to come back

[The Unkown Spirit:]
My Crystal Sword is ready yet. I really seem to
find what Mankind are looking for

[White Warrior:]
I would like to draw a line who bring us the
True Heaven and Erase the Devil Lies
In this night of Fantasy. The madness will possess
you there's no other way to run.

I guess the time is right reflecting on the
future, in my thoughts and in my dreams...

[The Divine Gladiators:]
I guess the time is right

[White Warrior:]
My mind will spring and come....
The is no other way...

[The Divine Gladiators:]
We wll protect the World

[White Warrior:]
Somebody's crying tonight. Heaven is Hell for
a while...Insanity is the truth. It's time to
look around us. I'm sailing to the North

[The Divine Gladiators:]
Somebody's crying tonight. Heaven is Hell for
a while...

[White Warrior:]
Insanity is the truth, It's time to look around us.

[The Divine Gladiators:]
We're sailing to the North

[White Warrior:]
If our God will reign in
Hell, we find the Golden Cross and our hopes
will fade away! Angels please come back to me
or Lucifer will get our Planet and our love

I guess the time is right we ride the wings of
Heaven, in my thoughts and in my dreams...

My soul will drive my mind on the longest
road of Heaven, in my thoughts
and in my dreams...

[The Divine Gladiators:]
Somebody's crying, somebody's crying...[x3]

[White Warrior:]
There is no other place to run!
My heart is dying all alone!
Please, bring me back my God!!
