Another day has come to start, but Belzebu have just conquered the Earth.
Another flame so warm aqnd Dark, evil creatures keep on falling down or rising fast from the ground.

This is the last time when I can sing this song for you, this is the last step to hell.
I'm not the last man to keep on playing this song for you, but I'm the only one to be followed.

I will cry tonight, I will cry tonight, and my hands we cannot stop this crime.
I will cry tonight, I will cry tonight, and my sword has lost the eternal fight.

Another war so cruel and Dark, we needn't to fight anymore we have lost and we go...

This is the last time when I can sing this song for you, this is the last step to hell.
I'm not the last man to keep on playing this song for you, but I'm the only one to be followed.

I will cry tonight, I will cry tonight...

This is the last time when I can sing this song for you, this is the last step to hell.
I'm not the last man to keep on playing this song for you, but I'm the only one to be followed.

I will cry tonight, I will cry tonight, and my hands we cannot stop this crime.
I will cry tonight, I will cry tonight, I don't know if I can come back home.

Cry tonight, cry tonight, cry tonight.
