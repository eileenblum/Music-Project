You decide to betray me to kill me and sell my soul. 
But even if you are proud of it you have to stay alone in the Reign of Satan the World will always be.
So only the pure warriors can hold their strong beliefs.

I will die Betray by you, but you can't get the truth!

White Warrior... (DIE) nothing is left for me.
White Warrior... (DIE) nothing I can keep, now.

The Assassin of the Darkness is creating what you need.
I drove my soul on fire but now I'll rest in peace.
There are no other chances, there is no oter way...
just one more night, just one more day to pray.

From my grave my soul will rise and I'll let you die!

White Warrior... (DIE) nothing is left for me.
White Warrior... (DIE) nothing I can keep, now. 
White Warrior... (DIE) I'm your dream inside.
White Warrior... (DIE) and I will let you die.
White Warrior... (DIE) you will bledd for me.
White Warrior... (DIE) I will always be, there.

Surrounding by the rainbow but now my time has come,
with iced tears of terror the world will be alone.
There is no way to change it these silent Evil Blood:
My story ends, your story can... go... on...

No way White Warrior!
The Earth is mine, and this is just my Day.
Hahahaha...
