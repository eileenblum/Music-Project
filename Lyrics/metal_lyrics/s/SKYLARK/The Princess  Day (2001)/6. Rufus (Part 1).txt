You are fighting, memories in my brain; you are crying, while I'm going insane...
Justify, for the fault of my soul; in your eyes, I can lose my control.

I want to search for my sign together, I don't want to spill my blood... anymore.
With my guide I will take you straight to heaven; but we will keep on searching for Rufus.

We are searching for Rufus, we are priests of Mankind, we are living to follow the sign.
We are searching for Rufus walking along our way and when the time has come it's O.K.

You are running, to a different World; you are crying, 'cause you don't find right words.
Don't deny me, but lay your weapons down, try to fight: don't fall down on the ground.

I want to come in this battle together, we are walking on the same road
'Cause your soul is a door of the heaven, have no fear, follow the trace of Rufus.

We are searching for Rufus...

We want to find the time in which our God can help me, we really whish to die: we are fighting for Mankind.

I want to search for my sign together, I don't want to spill my blood... anymore.
With my guide I will take you straight to heaven; but we will keep on searching for Rufus.

We are searching for Rufus...
