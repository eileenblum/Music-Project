Young Girl comes, as a messenger of love. We have to go, just before our God will fall.

In this night I'll pray to get my answers; in this night I'll pray: do it for me.
Walking on the edge of broken senses, I'm leaving the World.

I start my journey through the fire, far from the Earth so blind and from the Lucifer's eyes.
On this trip will fight the liars, several souls will burn on me.

Young girls comes (on a winged horse) to protect me by the Lord (I know you can).

Black Dark Lord (is the Son of Satan) now he won and hold the wrold (don't give up).
But this night is giving a solution, with my princess I'll built a new world.
We are not constricted by an illusion... we are saving our souls.

I start my journey through the fire...

Men have decided to die but there are some heores.
We have to save the souls clean from Evil blades.
Princess is our guide, our deepest concience.
We lost this war but we're never alone until her star keep us shining on.

In this night I'll pray to get my answers; in this night I'll pray you do it for me.
Walking on the edge of bronken senses, I'm leaving the World.

I start my journey through the fire...
