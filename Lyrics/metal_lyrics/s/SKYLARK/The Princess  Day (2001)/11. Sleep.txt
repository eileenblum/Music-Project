Hey there you
Way out there in the distance
Can you hear me?
Are you there?

I know it's late 
So please forgive my persistence
But i'm hanging
Do you care?

So lay back
Call off the attack
'Cause if you look deep
Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
And I would let the whole thing keep
If I could just sleep

Hey there you
Way out there could you show me?
Just a signal
Or a sign
That after all
All these years that you know me
And I'm not just
Killing time

So lay back
Call off the attack
'Cause if you lok deep
Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
And I would let the whole thing keep
If I could just sleep

And as I lay there at night
Building castles in the air
Out of alibis and all those little lies
And then I look inside
And pray that I don't care

I don't care

I don't care
