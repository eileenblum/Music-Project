Our Time Has Come White Warrior, I'm Coming Back To You.

Time has Come 'cause we need somebody, someone who can show us the way.
Change our blaze in this final battle, stop me crying don't forget to pray!
I can guide you in the Darkest hour, I can take all your fears away.
I don't want to protect this fire, our flame will resolve the game.

Come to open this empty space, now I really can see your face.

Time has come, and I don't want to stay, but I'll be back to see the Princess Day.
Take my heart, and I will fly away, wake uo your mind to appreciate this day: the Princess Day.

I'm alive just to see the legend, I'm no blind and I can go on.
I will give all my natural weapons, I just can let her fight alone.
Please com to me Queen of Mankind, you are the Star come and stop this crime!

Now I can win this lottery, in the end of our agony.

Time has come, and I don't want to stay...

[Princess Of The Snow]
I'm your guide, I'm your soul inside. Merge your aim with my silent cries.

Time has come, and I don't want to stay...

Time has come, and I don't want to stay, but I'll be back to see the Princess Day.
Take my heart, and I will fly away, wake uo your mind to appreciate this day: the Princess Day.
