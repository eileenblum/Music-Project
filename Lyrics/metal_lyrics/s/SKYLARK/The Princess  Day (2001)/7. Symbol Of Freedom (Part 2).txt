Into my crystal ball I bring my future down, above the Crystal Lake I breathe this magic sound.
Now all my energy are running through my veins, and all my enemies don't really seem the same.

Rufus is like a way home; Rufus is what we looked for... so.
Rufus is comething that push you to do it well. Rufus is energy to be the best.
Rufus is lightning that run without thunder and we strongly can hold the key 'cause now...
We have finally found Rufus.

Don't you look back please don't waste all your time, try to wake up run away.
Take just this chance so it will let you fly 'cause tonight... we have the right to stay, here.

Above the iron wings I'll sign the final hour, out of the Victory we still can hold the power.
Around the old Cathedral some black birds are flying, symbol of freedom Rufus now is rising.

Rufus is all that you need, Rufus is what you believe, Rufus is energy without the limits and if you fight it: you have to die.
Rufus is freedom for innocent people and he van give them the right key to go on the Crystal Wings of Rufus.

Don't you look back please don't waste all your time, try to wake up run away.
Take just this chance so it will let you fly 'cause tonight... we have the right to be alive.

[Princess Of The Snow]
Don't you look back please don't waste all your time, try to wake up run away.
Take just this chance so it will let you fly 'cause tonight... we have the right to stay...

Don't you look back please don't waste all your time, try to wake up run away.
Take just this chance so it will let you fly 'cause tonight... we have the right to stay...
Don't you look back please don't waste all your time, try to wake up run away.
Take just this chance so it will let you fly 'cause tonight... we have the right to trust in Rufus.
