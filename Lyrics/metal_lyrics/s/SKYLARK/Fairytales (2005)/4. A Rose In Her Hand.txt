Help me: nothing left for me to say
While the World around me seems to fade away.
Help me: nothing left for me to live for
While I see nothing around me, nothing but despair.

Help me, save me, 'cause I'm talking to you
I've got nothing in my hand, nothing but a Rose.
Help me, I'm asking just for comprehension
While the World around me rolls and goes so wrong.

For a Girl, with a Rose in her hand
For a Girl, trying to explain what is wrong
Into this life that is turning into Hell
Tell me what will remain for a Girl with a Rose in her hand.
