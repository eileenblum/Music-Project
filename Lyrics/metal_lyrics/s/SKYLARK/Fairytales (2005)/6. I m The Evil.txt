I'll come to you, dark as night cold as snow.
After long fights blood anguish my memories.
I'll come to you, I breathe your silence I fill your gaps.
To make you cry.

You'll eat my flesh in this luxury banquet
I'll eat your soul, day by day
I'm the Evil that consumes you
I'm the Evil that corrupts you.

I'll come to you, like a pill inside your throat.
It Makes you better,,, make the worst that you can do.
I'll come to you, Lord of darkness, Lord of life.
But not yours.
