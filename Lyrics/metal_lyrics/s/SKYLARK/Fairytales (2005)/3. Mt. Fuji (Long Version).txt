[Japanese Bonus Track]

Time I need Time, to forgive what my pride left behind
But Time will never come.
Time, I need Time to forget what my soul can't rewind
But Time won't be so long.
And I've lost my soul.

In the land of blood and fire, in this night of Fantasy
Sky is dark the Storm is higher it's my Destiny.
I see something that can scare you, you don't wanna meet his eyes,
Walking back the snow surrounds you like a sacrifice.

Above you, I'm gonna recall my
childhood clue, so I can survive.

Like a God above his reign, he can freeze you with his face
You are there to play the game in this shining place.
Only men who live with honor, agony and ecstasy,
can look at the magic mountain where they spread their dreams.

I'm down there with my emotions
Just down there to feel like I'm flying.

Mountain Fuji is the Key to find your heart
Mountain Fuji is a spark beneath the Stars
Mountain Fuji is the Castle of the Dawn
Home for a innocent soul.

There's no need to face, what my mind can't get to know,
There's no path and place, where my soul can find the love,
Apart from you...

Shining and sparkling your peak is so bright,
You look like a preacher a guide for Mankind
Your shape is something so close to an Angel with innocent eyes...

Sometimes you scare us.

Look at the top of the mountain...feel in your veins what is wrong
Symbol of boldness and friendship...it's a light for us all.
