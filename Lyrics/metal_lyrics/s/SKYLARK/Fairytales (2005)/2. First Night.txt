Don't ya think, let it be...
We'll fly another time for this I don't regret,
All that had been broken.
Don't ya think, let it be...
We used to be pals now there's nothing and no one.
Never made us so damned close.

Power of Love, Power of Lunacy,
All now is clearer, all now is gloomier.

My first night without you must fall.
Coming to the North
My first night without you must fall.
Coming to the North, pushed against the Wall
Floating in the air, my heart still wanders in the Storm.

Don't ya think...It's not right
There's nothing you can do but now you have to see...
That we've been given a gift.
Don't ya think... It's not right
Staying side but side is like a falling star.
Much too close and much too far.

But now I feel the dark behind me
And now, I'm gonna trust my soul...
