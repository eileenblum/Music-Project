[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

[The unknown spirit:] Into the night.
[White Warrior:] Priests come to show me the road to my pride.
[The divine gladiators:] We'll never find the strength to kill these evil lies.
[The unknown spirit:] Out of my sight.
[White Warrior:] Demons are searching (for) the way to my life.
[The divine gladiators:] We'll never find the way to make this evil blind.

[Pre-chorus] 
[White Warrior:]  Never tell me, what have they done? On this night in Hell... 
Never squeeze me, stick to your gun, during next night I'll be there

[Chorus] 
[The divine gladiators:]   White Warrior:  
Belzebu!   Where I can find you? 
Belzebu!  What have you done? 
Belzebu!  In my desire. 
Belzebu!  'Cause you are running away... BELZEBU 

[The unknown spirit:] Into the night.
[White Warrior:] You are the witness of the devil cries.
[The divine gladiators:] We'll never find the strength to kill these evil lies.
[The unknown spirit:] Stay by my side.
[White Warrior:] Would you mind take me to the eternal flight?
[The divine gladiators:] We'll never find the way to make this evil blind.

[Pre-chorus] 
[White Warrior:]  Never tell me, what have they done? On this night in Hell... 
Never squeeze me, stick to your gun, during next night I'll be there

[Chorus]
[The divine gladiators:]   White Warrior:  
Belzebu!   Where I can find you? 
Belzebu!  What have you done? 
Belzebu!  In my desire. 
Belzebu!  'Cause you are running away... BELZEBU 

[Dark bridge]
[The divine gladiators:]  No where to run, no where to go. 
Phantom of devil, will be reborn.

Please come with me, I'll let you see the final nightmare of mankind disease.

[White Warrior:]  I'm the Warrior White my mission is to save the world! 
God give me your hand before I fall.

Through this darkest tunnel 'cause my enemy is you... What can I do?

[Creatures of the universe:] BELZEBU!!!

[BELZEBU:]  But when the night is coming, darkness will rule the world. 
No way to escape... for nobody! 
I'm the lord of the abyss, the only hope for human race. 
Trust in me or I will guide you to die!! 

[2nd pre-chorus]
[White Warrior:]  Never touch me, what have we done? Blow this wind of Hell. 
Running, screaming, knife kills the gun but I will create your farewell.

[Chorus] 
[The divine gladiators:]   White Warrior:  
Belzebu!   Where I can find you? 
Belzebu!  What have you done? 
Belzebu!  In my desire. 
Belzebu!  'Cause you are running away... BELZEBU 

[BELZEBU:] No man was born able to find me, 
you'd better understand White Warrior! 
Your journey is coming to an end so don't you dare to challenge me 
or my rage will destroy everythimg!!! 
There is no way to save the world 
because the world is already mine and no hope for humanity corrupted 
and so blind! And no hope to see the light, 
no hope to see the day, no hope, no hope!!!!! 
There is no hope for victory, you'll die White Warrior, 
DIE, and burn inside my Hell for eternity... 
your soul belongs to me since the beginning of it all, 
surrender now, surrender or uselessly fight me... 
so you'll soon know what's the difference between you, man, and me... 
Belzebu!!!
