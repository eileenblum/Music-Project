[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

[The guardian angel:]
Tonight I wanna be so kind, behind the saddest steps of love.
Tonight there's no love around, but the answers will come.
Tonight I get a malice wild, inside the ancient wing of love.
Tonight the space will meet our life until the answers will come.

[Chorus]
I wanna lay my spirit dying, I wanna infiltrate my soul (it's a part of me).
There's no way to take the time 'cause I can't find some love tonight.

[Repeat chorus]

But I can't find some love.
