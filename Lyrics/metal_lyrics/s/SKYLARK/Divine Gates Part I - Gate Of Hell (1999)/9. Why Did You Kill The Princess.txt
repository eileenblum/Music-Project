[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

[The guardian angel:]
Why did you kill the Princess? Why did you cross the dark sea?
Why did you stop me cryin'?... Just blow me away...
[White Warrior:]
Why did you take me higher? Spending this night of fire.
Why did you call me again? Until the Princess is so far away.
[The guardian angel:]
Why did you change this madness? Into this night of sadness.
Why did you start the game? It's now or never.
[White Warrior:] Now or never.

[Pre-chorus]
[White Warrior:]
Walking in a land where old spirits and shadows guide me to escape from the law.
Feeling the rainbow inside my sad pleasure, now I just want (to) face this war!

[Chorus]
[The guardian angel:] The Princess now has gone!
[White Warrior:] Can you look at yourself till I'm still waiting here?
[The guardian angel:] Princess now has gone...
[White Warrior:] I'll remember the dark I'll forget myold fears.
The Princess now has gone... The Princess now has gone.

[Brigde]
[Lady of the Light:]
So many reasons I will keep them on my side.
So many days I will share to know some lies.
But my time is always near.
[White Warrior:]
Don't turn away from this hell, give me a sign and I'll be there.
[The divine spirit:]
Don't turn away from this hell, give me a sign and I'll be there.
[White Warrior:]
The Princess must go to another good world, Princess must rule on that world.
[The divine spirit:] The Princess must give us the strenght to go over...
[White Warrior:] So now I just want (to) face this war.
Now I really want... to face this war.

[The guardian angel:]
Why did you kill the Princess? Why did you cross the dark sea?
Why did you stop me cryin'?... Just blow me away...
[White Warrior:]
Why did you take me higher? Spending this night of fire.
Why did you call me again? Until the Princess is so far away.
[The guardian angel:]
Why did you change this madness? Into this night of sadness.
Why did you start the game? It's now or never.
[White Warrior:] Now or never.

[Pre-chorus]
[White Warrior:]
Walking in a land where old spirits and shadows guide me to escape from the law.
Feeling the rainbow inside my sad pleasure, now I just want (to) face this war!

[Chorus]
[The guardian angel:] The Princess now has gone!
[White Warrior:] Can you look at yourself till I'm still waiting here?
[The guardian angel:] Princess now has gone...
[White Warrior:] I'll remember the dark I'll forget myold fears.
The Princess now has gone... The Princess now has gone.

[The guardian angel:]
Why did you kill the Princess? When you left the morning light, 
without showing me the way.
[White Warrior:]
Why did you kill the Princess? When you left the morning light, 
wouuld you showing me the way?
[The guardian angel:]
Come to show me the way...
