[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

[The divine gladiators:] Into my world, into my thoughts.
[White Warrior:] My soul will rise again.
[The divine gladiators:] Into my heart, please let me start.
[White Warrior:]  This is the trip of pain. 
Somewhere in the desert, something in the sky, 
I'll climb the iced mountain, I'm the Warrior White! 

[The divine gladiators:] Into my world, into my thoughts.
[White Warrior:] My mind is here to fight again!
[The divine gladiators:] Into my heart, please let me start.
[White Warrior:]  I want to find my way. 
Somewhere in the desert, something in the sky, 
I'll climb the iced mountain, whit destiny behind. 
Nothing from the darkness, hear the final call, 
I'm the Warrior White: I will save the world! 

[White Warrior:]  Into my world, into my thoughts, 
I really want to save the world tonight.

[The divine gladiators:] I see my life, into yor eyes.
[White Warrior:]  This is the welcome of the eternal fight. 
No where to run, no where to go, the evil steps are signing the right day.

Come back to me, my deepest dream or I will lose my way. 

[Bridge] 
This is time to realise, to justify, to erase my pain. 
Dragon's sword is by my side and I'll be back in the judgement day. 
I will need the final answers, I will hear the final call! 
Just on me depends the world. 

[Pre-chorus] 
So many days: I'll try to change it.  
So many miles from home...  
And I know the time will get better for me and my time has come!! 

[Chorus]
[Lady of the Light:] So kill the devil, do it for me; 
let me realise all my dreams.
[White Warrior:] I'll kill the devil to be proud of me, 
but my desires are dying!

[Pre-chorus] 
[So many days:] I'll try to change it.  
So many miles from home...  
And I know the time will get better for me and my time has come!! 

[Chorus]
[Lady of the Light:] So kill the devil, do it for me; 
let me realise all my dreams.
[White Warrior:] I'll kill the devil to be proud of me, 
but my desires are dying!

[The divine gladiators:] The world desires are dying!
