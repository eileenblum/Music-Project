[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

[The guardian angel:]
When Heaven and earth collide tonight, and the answers 
and questions could become the same behind me,
I'm so afraid to see the light but I know time will get better...
The deepest dark would be so right, the endless candle 
by his flame will light the air around me,
I'll ride the winter breeze tonight, 'cause I know life starts again.

I want to stay where love can guide my way: my last question is here. 

The time has come my Warrior White, Belzebu is waiting: 
you have to start the final challenge.
The eternal flame will shine tonight, yes I know, time will get better...

I want to know where love can guide my way: my last question is here.
