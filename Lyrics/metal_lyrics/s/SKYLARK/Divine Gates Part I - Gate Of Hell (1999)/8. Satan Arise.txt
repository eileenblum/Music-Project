[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

[White Warrior:]
Last night in Heaven, ride down to this Hell: 
I've been caught from cries and sorrow.
Think about all the people you killed: I don't want to die by your hand.
Living in the dark in a sign of the priest, I can't feel my body drifting.
I'll never return in this age of the beast, all I here is desperation.

[Chorus]
[[White Warrior:] Break the time of neverland.
[The divine gladiators:] Satan will come, Satan will get you!
[White Warrior:] Reality is behind... then Satan arise.

[White Warrior:]
Crossing the shadows of the Lucifer's shoulders, 
sea of pain is near to catch you.
Blowing the energy to the evil lady: All my dreams are trying to fade.

[Chorus]
[White Warrior:] Break the time of neverland.
[The divine gladiators:] Satan will come, Satan will get you!
[White Warrior:] Reality is behind... then Satan arise.

The cross will make you blind!

[Satan:] I'm Satan.
