[The Guardian of the third Gate:]
I thought it was different, I thought it was mine.
[Princess of the Snow:]
I thought it was Fire, I think I was blind.

[The Guardian of the third Gate:]
The Sky that surrounds us is turning to Gray.
[Princess of the Snow:]
We've wasted our time, there is no mistake.

[The Guardian of the third Gate:] Sometimes Wrong
[Princess of the Snow:] Deep inside my evil thoughts
[The Guardian of the third Gate:] Something wrong
[Princess of the Snow:] All around the Holy Cross
[The Guardian of the third Gate:] Yes so Wrong
[Princess of the Snow:] Yes, so wrong and my soul can't bear too long
[The Guardian of the third Gate:] All is Wrong.

[Princess of the Snow:] This is the Gate of nowhere, it's not a way to follow.
[The Guardian of the third Gate:] It's not a door to erase our pain.
[Princess of the Snow:] This is the end of feelings, these are the evil ceilings.
[The Guardian of the third Gate:] And we won't travel back this path.

[The Guardian of the third Gate:] Take away, my wounded Soul
[Princess of the Snow:] cause behind the curtain falls.
[The Guardian of the third Gate:] Once againâ¦hope!
[Princess of the Snow:] Hope!

[Princess of the Snow:] That Something grabs our life, something still inside, stronger than our Love.
[The Guardian of the third Gate:] Something for the Pain, everlasting blame, try to stop our fall,
[Together:] But All is Wrong.
