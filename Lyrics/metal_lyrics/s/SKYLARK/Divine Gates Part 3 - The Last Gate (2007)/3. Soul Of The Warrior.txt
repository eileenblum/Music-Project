[Princess of the Snow:]
In a sweet world
I fight just for finding your hand
In your sweet mind
I don't know what's left to understand
Take me away now
I know we can still find a way
Take my pain now
I know I will never forget

[Spirit of the White Warrior and Princess of the Snow:]
Into this night I will fight for the answers
Invisible knight of fire
Riding the symbol, a magic adventure
With pleasure, sweet pain and my heart

[Princess of the Snow:] Take my hand tonight
Spirit of the White Warrior: My warrior
[Princess of the Snow:] Show me when you cry
Spirit of the White Warrior: With my sorrow
[Princess of the Snow:] Eternal fight is the only solution we don't find the meaning of love

[Princess of the Snow:]
In this sweet world
My warrior you're fighting tonight
In your sweet mind
I know now the way to go there
Take me away now
Please save me from sorrow and pain
Take my pain now
I know I will never regret

Come to me, save my soul

Take my soul tonight
