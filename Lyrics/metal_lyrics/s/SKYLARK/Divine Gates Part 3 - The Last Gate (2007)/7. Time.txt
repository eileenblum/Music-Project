[Princess of the Snow and the Oracle:]
Walking through the place where I belong
Listening to the heartbeat of my soul
Screaming like a bat out in the light
There a senseless fight around my life

It's time to go, looking for a better world
It's time to go, is the night to sing the song
It's time to go, far way from what I've done
It's time to go, it's time to pray, it's time to go

[Princess of the Snow and the Oracle:]
Choosing better cards and better lies
Running to another sweeter sound
Glancing at the Sky above your head
Catching the last chances that I met
