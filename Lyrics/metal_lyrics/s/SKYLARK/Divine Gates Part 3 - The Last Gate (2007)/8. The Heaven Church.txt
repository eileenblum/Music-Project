[Princess of the Snow:]
The last night falls on my mind, I see Devil steps are behind
I'm feeling sure, in the arms of the church.
I want to escape from your gaze, I want to light our blaze
To warm my heart and to burn my old fears, â¦strong.

But now the Star is rising, we trust in more and more.
My Lord will light our fire, until we carry on.
There is a magic spirit that open up the gale:
This is the reason why I'll find my way.

The cross will sign the end of our darkness
Black spirits come inside the Heaven Church.
My sword can snatch the heart of the Black Angel
A hope can start we praise the Heaven Church.

The last night falls on my mind, the Devil's arms are behind:
I really want to protect our world.
Under the sweet Princess gaze, only a hope can remainâ¦
All my desires will get our way, now.

So now the star is rising, I will follow his breeze
My Lord will light our fire to cure our black disease.
There is a simple prayer that we will cry along,
So now my voice is writing one more song.

The cross will sign the way to Paradise
My spirit goes to cure the Jesus soul.
There is no way to throw away our pleasure
We breathe, we love... into the Heaven Church.
