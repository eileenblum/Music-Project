[Princess of the Snow:]
Runaway because the time has come
and I just want to scream inside my deepest terror
Runaway because the plot has done and all is left to do is Dying Inside.

I don't know what is the way to take what is the God to pray
What is the dream to follow
I just know that fantasy has turned that innocence has gone
To another World.

Runaway, because the world has changed
Because there's nothing here to risk your life and honor.
Use your brain, try to protect your soul, try to forget the sword, just Die Inside

When the World's falling down, when the Dark takes this town
You can scream or cry.
When your Shade grabs the light, there is no compromise
You can say goodbye.
There is nothing to lose or to gain, there is nothing to save here tonight
When you're Dying Inside

[Captain of the Warriors:]
Runaway because the time has come
and I just want to scream inside my deepest terror

[Princess of the Snow and the Warriors together:]
Runaway because the plot has done and all is left to do is Dying Inside.
