[Princess of the Snow and Captain of the Warriors together:]
Fantasy, is just a word to fall in love.
Agony is what today affects our soul.

[Princess of the Snow:]
There's no White Warrior on our side, there are no chances to survive
We have just opened the Last Gate.

Not a Knight but just an evil disciple.
Not so White but Black as much as Belzebu.

[The Warriors:]
Run because it's coming Belzebu

[Princess of the Snow:]
He made a pact for vanity, searching the glory just for him,
this what is hidden in the Gate. So...

I scream for more, to change this day,
but now my time has come and gone,
and we can't win the game.
I scream for more, to stop this fall,
but now the evil seats so close and we can't free our soul,
so I scream alone.

We have fought in a battle with nothing to win,
and White Warrior, our Symbol, was only a dream.
Now the path that we are walking might lead to nowhere,
Only time can tell.

[Princess of the Snow and Captain of the Warriors together:]
Fantasy, is just a word to fall in love.
Agony is what today affects our soul.

[Princess of the Snow:]
Now we will sing so loud this song, but we don't know what we look for,
Making a step beyond the Gate. So...
