Dancing through the countryside and wandering in a land
A falling star in front of me is a way to understand
The smoke around the casttle is fading
But I've got the strength just to make... the same mistake
The sun is staring at my eyes and I don't want to go
The rainbow doesn't want to fly so I can't let it go
A whisper on my fairytale is something that I wanted to break

The same mistake, the same old game, the same I know

The falling star is passing by but I don't wanna fall
The power of a feeling blind can push me against the wall
I'm wondering if I'm alive, I'm honestly so ready to make: the same mistake

Sometimes I want to shot through myself
Sometimes I want to be somebody else, I'm still alive but I'm not O.K.
Out in the sunlight, out in the sunlight to make:

The same mistake, the same old game, the same I know
Always the same, inside my brain, maybe it's too late

While by while I cross that line to change my aim inside
for the tears I couldn't cry, for what I left behind
Just one step, another word, I'm living this again
Just one step, another breathe and I will be so ready to make:

The same mistake, the same old game, the same I know
All my mistake, I have to make, that's me you know

But I will fly to find the rainbow in the dark, I will fly so high, my vision
And I will fly to find my rainbow in the dark, and I'll control... my life

Amazing sensation moves on my mind, exciting vibration I'm feeling fine
Oneiric radiation posses my home, warriors of iron are not so strong

Another day, another dawn, some other air to breathe
Another road, another town, so proud, so fool and ready to make: the same mistake
