Darkness, don't ever change your way before the night
Nothing else can drive my soul insane, cause I'm dead
Sunlight, I can't escape this day where demons dancing
From the evil wings that close my arms so wide, so strong

I,m fly over your world again, before the sunlight
I'm a simple sign of what remains in your heart
Never I won't come back someday, becouse it's over
But your fantasy can still survive inside your mind

Northwinds, slipping, inside my old bones
Firestorm, sparkling, over my home
I will sign to you a song for my youth gone
I'm singing last SKYLARK song

White warrior
I'm walking around off this darkness
I'm singing the last saddest song
I'm trading my life with the death souls
Come back White warrior
This end is a meaning of boldness
But I think I throw it away
with just one mistake, just an error
No way White warrior
My princess is guiding the adventure
The angels are shining again
But I'm not the man who they meant
And now I have to take who I am
A loser but maybe a rainbow on witch mankind will fly someday
It's your choice between white and grey
I'm just White warrior
The truth now we know and we'll never be alone
The red sun is shining for us all
The rainbow will guide us where the eagles teach the art of love
And the SKYLARK won't play anymore
