In a corner of the world the rainbow signs some spires
In this corner I can get enough
With my crystal life I touch, I send my feelings higher
In my crystal eyes to hide my soul

You can run away, you'll try but I can't guide your answers
You can't slam the door, you shouldn't cry
If you take this chance again, the rainbow will surround you
Try to open up your heart and soul

I'm what you looked for, your ego, your world
I'm your solution, the door of the wall

But the summer of 2001, was the time of our fire
Cause summer of 2001, was a rebel reborn...
Backon the dawn, to the summer of 2001

In the century of the kings, we had to swallow nightmares
In this year we live, we spread our dreams
In the time blood and fire, the knights ride on their power
2001 was just a year to live

Ther's no solution, to unwind these chains
You are the only one who force your defence

But the summer of 2001, was the Mystical trial
And the summer of 2001, was a mission unknown
Cause summer of 2001, was a road to fly higher
So back to the dawn, to the summer of 2001
