[viola solo]

Since the rainbow has gone behind me
I'm lost in my fantasy
I can't go away, I can't wake up there
I can't clear this agony

As I think about past time
I can't stop my cries anymore
it's so hard this truth from my mind
I cannot believe in love

[pre-chorus:]
So the answers are too far to come to me
so this fire is too strong to disappear

[instrumental chorus / viola solo]

Where are you? is my sad question
I tell myself more and more
with no strenght, with no intention
but I have to believe in me 

[pre-chorus:]
'Cos my pride's next to fall down on my knees but my life needs something to believe in

[instrumental chorus / viola solo]

[twin guitar solo]

Future is a dark room closed
without windows, without lights
soul is lost heart is stolen,
but I'm really fighting

[final-chorus:]
'Cos I've lost the answers,
Fight alone,   (the answers),
You're alone,   (the answers),
Of the world,
The answers will not come!
Will not come!!
