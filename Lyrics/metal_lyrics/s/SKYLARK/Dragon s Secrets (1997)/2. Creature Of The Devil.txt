[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

Walking in the fire, murder is desire
she would like to stop the sound of time
bringing back the life, sign of silent cries
she would like to call the priest to her.

[bridge:]   She wanna fight, she wants to kill

Visions in the fever ancient wing of evil
she would like to burn face of the cross
luxury in her eyes, creature of our life
she would like to rule and guide the world

[bridge:]   We have to fight, we have to kill

[1st pre-chorus:]
But now I know that inside her heart
something can keep love and pain apart
so you've got the chance to try
'cause we want to survive!

[chorus:] 
She's a creature of the devil,
she's a creature of the fight
she's the creature with the scythe
she's a creature of the night

Staring at the horizon, praying for the sun
don't let Satan kill the golden bold
glancing at the desert,
raise your hands to roll
spirit of the sand rise to be hold

[bridge:]   And they will be lost, will not return!

[2nd pre-chorus:]
But now I know that our time has come
then we have to believe in love
and so we can destroy the night
in our chance to survive!

[chorus:] She's a creature of the devil,
she's a creature of the fight
she's the creature with the scythe
she's a creature of the night

[guitar solo]

Kill her soul with your blood and the holy gold cross

[in the forest:] I've been walking in the forest, step by step this is my life
I've been followed by the creature,
but I'm not ready to die
[celstial bridge:] I'm waiting for the last trip, 'cause I can feel her above
can you hear my final answer?
but the creature is so strong.

[chorus:] 
She's a creature of the devil,
she's a creature of the fight
she's the creature with the scythe
she's a creature of the night
