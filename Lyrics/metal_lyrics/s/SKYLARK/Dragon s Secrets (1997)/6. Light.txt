[ACT 1]

[The mission]
[Musica: Eddy Antonini]
[Testi: Eddy Antonini e Giovanni De Giorgi]

[Oracle:]
A prophecy was made that someday the time will come in which darkness 
will take hold of the world.
But it is also written that one man will stand out and proudly fight 
against evil, violence and hatred and bring back the light.....

Walking in the dark above our head
young people are passing through the wall
listening to the call of the wild land
they live and fight to take the light back home

They have to run away in a travel to the space
they have to start a game this could be the final race

But the time I know will come
if you put your heart in trouble
time in which the sky'll meet the world
time right will come
there's a light laid down beside you
fight on thunder of love

[lead piano]

Staring at red eyes of the guardian
they can see the whicked arise
they would forget but they have to save their love
raise your hands before the last hopes fall

They have to save our life taking back our guiding light
they're trying to change the sign and the evil will be blind

But the time I know will come
if you put your heart in trouble
time in which the sky'll meet the world
time right will come
there's a light laid down beside you
fight on thunder of love

There's a light in the sky,

fighting to win another time 

Fight until the end because I need it

Show us what you think because I need it
