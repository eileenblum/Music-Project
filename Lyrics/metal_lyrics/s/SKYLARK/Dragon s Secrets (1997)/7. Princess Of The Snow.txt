[Testi: Eddy Antonini]

[Goblin and Troll:] Thoughts are crying out from your mind tonight

But you keep on getting out of my eyes 

[Goblin and Troll:] Tears are rolling down on your face tonight

But you keep on burning my soul inside
'cause you keep on burning my spirit and 
I'm yearning that time don't get over my home

[instrumental part]

[Goblin and Troll:] Sun is crossing, the light of day

But you will not give us our chance to pray

[Goblin and Troll:] Planets are fighting in the Milky Way

But you're trying to take my soul away
'cause you're trying to break these Evil Chains
to take us in the World of the Snow.

[Cyclops:] ... The Princess...
Princess of the Snow   [twice]

[guitar &amp; flute solo / lead part (guitar &amp; flute) / guitar solo / twin guitar solo]

[1st bridge:]
Please show me the way tonight
please guide our soul tonight
Princess of the Snow   [twice]

[chorus:]
You keep on burning my soul is yearning
I won't forget your world
(Princess of the Snow)
My time is ending would you mind lend me
the power of your world

[2nd bridge:]
Walking in the land where the Princess was born
I will survive running straight to the North
I'm feeling the witch coming knock on my door ([Witch:] I'm on my way)
jump on my ship to the Land of the Snow

Symposium
[Goblin:] Have you seen the princess?
[Witch and Ogre:] We killed the princess
[Oracle:] What have you done?
[Ogre:] So now I own the world!
[Angels:] She'll never die!

[Cyclops:] ... The Princess...
Princess of the Snow

[chorus:]
My time is ending would you mind lend me
the power of your world
(Princess of the Snow)
You keep on burning my soul is yearning
I won't forget your world
(Princess of the Snow)
My time is ending would you mind lend me
the power of your world

The Princess of the Snow!
