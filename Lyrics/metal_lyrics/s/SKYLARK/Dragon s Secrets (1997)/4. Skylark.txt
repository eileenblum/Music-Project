[Musica e testi: Eddy Antonini]

[cello solo / lead bass / violin solo / flute solo]

The shining skylarks are coming to this town
to understand what people desire
to ride the rainbow, to find a simple life
come and play with us this song tonight

[pre-chorus:]
Now that time has come you can't go away
now that your soul is strong,
you'll fly alone someday
raise your sword to sun! (raise your sword to sun)
raise your sword to us! (don't think of losing)
raise your sword and the sun is coming down
raise your sword tonight

[chorus:]
Skylarks are back in town
skylarks are falling down
upon your head, near to your eyes
I'm not afraid to die
skylarks are here for you
skylars are running to
to a better place, to a better life
come with skylarks to survive

[1st bridge:]
Here I go, I don't want to fall
skylarks are so near
no this time, 'cause we won't crawl
ride the sun of fear!

[twin guitar solo / violin solo / instrumental part]

[2nd bridge:]
Raise your glory   don't you worry
raise your thoughts   don't sleep too much
raise your eyes   don't say goodbye
Follow the skylark
won't you leave it   don't you leave it
indipendent   this is your chance
got a time   it isn't a crime
Looking for skylark

[2nd guitar solo: Max Ferri]

[pre-chorus:]
Now that time has come you can't go away
now that your soul is strong,
you'll fly alone someday
raise your sword to sun! (raise your sword to sun)
raise your sword to us! (don't think of losing)
raise your sword and the sun is coming down
raise your sword tonight

[chorus:]
Skylarks are back in town
skylarks are falling down
upon your head, near to your eyes
come with skylarks to survive!
