When the Horizon and Desert will be blind
When the Fire burns an empty World
Nothing from the darkness:...are you alone?

You have to capture your strength
Erase all the fears from your mind

Knife and Blood...you must die

Dark and Cries...end of life
Ride the Thunder...is the lance chance so we start: The Escape from the Dark.

Like an arrow you have to run alone.
Look behind: a moment of life before.

You have break this high wall.
Fight hard: the enemy is near.
You'd better take a ticket with me for this Escape from the Dark

Now can you imagine the Light?
Maybe you have a reason to try.
Come on, take a ticket with me for this Escape for the Dark.
