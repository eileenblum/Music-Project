Eagles upon the Lake. Land of Fantasy.
I couldn't believe. Far from human mind.

Look at the land of the Bright Angels.
Nothing is here, except our souls.
Fight to be free in the darkness...tomorrow we are right as the Sun.

Come with your questions to Crystal Lake.
Land of our love and our peace.
Lay your sweet body on the Broom of the Witch
And the Sign will be right for you.

Follow the Albatros...Find this unbelievable Lake.
