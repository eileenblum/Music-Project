Just a little Star, now you are walking through the Light
Searching for a Dream, Fire in your Eyes.

Little but so sweet is what you look like
Jumping on my back when you see me
Never I'll forget your insistence
Just to find a place to ride on

Never I'll betray your affection
You'll have always lived in my dreams
Without you my nights will be different
Hoping you can run only to be free.

Now the Star has gone I'll remember your name,
Never to much to say, it's a low of the Day.
Music of the Darkness, images from the light
Just your soul remains, your are riding free tonight.
...Flying free...
