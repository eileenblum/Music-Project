Is twilight in the morning or in the night?
the waves, I mean, the ocean just keeps leading me outside,
the mist it gives me kisses in the sun,
and I'm sorry to say it but I think the mourning's won.

If I fell in love with the mourning sun would you cry,
or would you color your dry eyes,
like the blackest night or the darkest star in the sky
no, you're not my white night but my dark angel.

I'm so much more than you could ever know
just driving down the road to see the sands of time
We look outside the ocean overflows
with chances that reject this broken heart of mine.

Singing' la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love, oooh, ooh.
singing' la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love, oooh, ooh.
If I fell in love with the mourning sun would you cry?
