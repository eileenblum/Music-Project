[Princess of the Snow:]
It's not a crime to lock the door, it's not a crime to fall in love,
It's not a crime to step behind, it's not a crime, it's not a crime.

It's not a crime to play a game, it's not a crime to light a flame,
it's not a choice to break the line, it's not a Hell it's not a crime.

But I, I can't share the tears in your Eyes. And I, I can't see the Sun cause I'm blind.

It's not a crime to have some fun, It's not a crime to leave the gun,
It's not a crime to change your mind, it's not a crime it's not a crime.

Help me, Leave me, Touch me, Kill me softly in this darkest night.

Cause I, I can't move myself in this Town,
Cause I, I am I looking for something around, if there's nothing real to find,
If there is no Dawn in my sight, But the Heaven maybe is mine.

Cause I, yes I don't believe in Love, on a drop that starts its fall,
On a tear to lift me higher, when our walking seems on fire, I carry on.

It's not a crime to fight alone, to hold a dream that won't go on,
and if you can't control your mood, it's not so bad, it's not so good.

Hold me, Find me, Lead me, Guide me, strongly all along this Path.
Help me, Feel me, Love me, Heal me, Touch me just to wake me up.

Cause I, I can't leave my heart in this Town.
But I, I can't search for the way to get out, if there's nothing real to find,
If there is no goal in my mind, lost in the Shade of the blind.

Cause I, yes I don't believe in Love, on a drop that starts its fall,
On a tear to lift me higher, when our walking seems on fire, I carry on.
I, yes I don't believe in Love, I wont' answer to this call,
I locked up my worst obsession, in a box with my sensations, to carry on.

I don't know why the Stars don't want to fall,
I don't know why the Sun don't wanna shine.
All I want is one more reason like a warning,
God, Just give me one more try. God, please give me one more try.
