Surfing the land of the cries, I'm falling.
Flying above the blue sky, I'm cruising.
Starting a fire tonight, I'm leaving.
Just one more spark in the night, surrender!

No one more song for my pride, no one more bullet to ride.
No one more song, inside my soul, I won't fall.

On the wings of the Typhoon I've forgotten my name
On the wings of the Typhoon I don't know what to say
On the wings of the Typhoon I know who's to pray.
On the wings of the Typhoon I'm choosing my life
On the wings of the Typhoon I'm ready to die
On the wings of the TyphoonI know when I cry.
