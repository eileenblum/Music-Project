Drops of mankind, falling behind, along the path to the night.
Don't waste your time, give me a sign, into the tunnel of life.

Take my hand tonight, walking by my side.
I will drive you through the darkness I will find a way to cry.

If things happen, happen for a reason,
if things happen, happen for a why.
Wake me up don't follow your decision
face again the mystery of the night.

Just one word, move on to the next season
raise your hands and try to win the fight
only god can build another prision.
But we'll solve the mystery of the night.
