[Japanese Bonus Track]Dark mystery in my mind, I wanna escape.
Eyes gone so blind looking for lights...
I'm lost in the shade of the night...
I.......in the sky, I'....... I'll touch the stars.

Lights cross my mind, I turn to smile, like a smile of the Sun.
I'm trying to change the pace of my life, I'll fly away in the sky.
I....... in the sky, I'...... I'l ride the stars.

Take your wings and fly, grab a star in the sky.
The horizon will open up your eyes.
The hand of an angel, will drive you away.
It's time to fly... follow your dreams (Follow your dreams).

When the darkness obscures your mind, and your dreams might be ready to die
Spread your wings flying high tonight, meet the rainbow and the angels somewhere in the sky.
