Tell me "your tears are dying?" tell me just who you are?
Tell me a lie to find you, how do we get so much far?

Walking the path of darkness, walking the road of life.
Rolling the tears behind you, rolling the dice of survive.

You will control your senses, you have the right to stay
Tears will bring out the answers, they'll turn to diamonds today.

Try to find a way to ride the night, try to fight for one more day.
Try to find a way to send a sign, just to take all your tears far away.
