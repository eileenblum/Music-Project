And She cried to the Moon and She died on the day She couldn't shine
and th Moon took a flight to another distant sky.

In the light of the Moon she just cried to the horizon left behind,
to the Moon, then She lied to herself and to her life.

She won't be screaming, She wouldn't fight
She won't be stealing the Moon and her light
She wouldn't sufferthe loss of the night
and I... I lied.

She used to fly from the dawn of the dusk
She used to float in the river of love
She used to challenge the Moon and the Sun
the Sun, so high.
