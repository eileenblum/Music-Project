This is not a love song, this is not the time.
This is not the day to change your mind.
This is not a love song, let the good times roll.
This is just a message from my soul.

Love song, I cannot write again, cause my answers are so blind.
Love song, is what I meant to say, but my time is no more right.

My way, your way I'm walking to the past 'cause I've the right to see
My way, your way, directly to my chest, just one more night and I will be in my dreams.

Love song, I cannot play again, but the night is still so young.
Love song, nothing has left to say, and this scream will touch the Sun.
