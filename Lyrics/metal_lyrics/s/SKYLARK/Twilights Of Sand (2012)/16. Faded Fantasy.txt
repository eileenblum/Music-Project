[Japanese Bonus Track]Look at my face, I feel the darkness
I'll stop and prey, I feel the crime
Into the silence, forever nightmare
Love is not brave, I'll make you cry

Living this day, inside the town
I long for the past, please come around
I feel my soul away, trapped in the dark room
Boosting your last mistake, to make you cry...

Passion in dying, my soul is crying, BELZEBU
Love is not fire, is not desire, BELZEBU is here... for you!

Look at my face, my desperation
Don't stop and prey, your tears are ice
Throw away your last dream that you betrayed
I feel the cold, I'm gonna cry
