She didn't believe him, did not fall in love again with him.
She didn't believe him and light one more flame he wants for him.

In your eyes, in your eyes, you will never return to start up one more fight.
In your eyes, in your eyes, you will never posses all the answers you like.
And he died, he died one more time.

He'll never forgive you. He'll never take back the love you've got.
But he cannot surrender, and walking without you by his side.

In your eyes, in your eyes, he can't see what he needs to fulfill his desires.
In your eyes, in your eyes, he can't see all the bright stars that sparkle and shine and you lied... lied one more time.

Tonight, he'll light a flame for him.

Leaving the road to hell and fight for all we've done for
walking the road from hell and fight for what we've done.
Leaving the road to hell and fight for all we've done for
cause We'll fly tonight, getting back our pride till we found the road to heaven.

Give just a sign, leave the past behind, show me where to find my heaven.

She didn't believe him, and put the time back when love was all
she didn't believe him, an drive the main road to a waterfall.

Will be wrong? Will be right? There's no answer around to discover tonight
will be wrong? Will be right? There's no need to forget what has benn left behind
cause they died, they both died hard that night.

Tonight the flame will cry again.
