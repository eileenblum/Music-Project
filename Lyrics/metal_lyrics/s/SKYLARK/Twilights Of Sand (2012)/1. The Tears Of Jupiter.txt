Through the heat of the desert, far away from the sky
alone in the night, alone in the dark just few sparks can lead the way.
The tears of Jupiter.

Hold me now, I won't be there tomorrow, take my hand and try
to see where love has gone.
I won't leave behind, my passion and my sorrow
there's no time to fly, too late to fall in love.

The tears of Jupiter will rise above, the darkest sky will shine to carry on.
I'm not the one supposed to stop this fall, another night... the planet will be gone.
