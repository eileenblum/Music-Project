Give me the power, his flame burns alone
give me the weapons to capture the Sun
show me his shelter and I will be there
don't waste your time, evil runs everywhere.

The princess is coming, the princess returns.
The princess is mourning, the princess will kill BelzebÃº.

I'm coming back on the wings of the night
I'll be controlled by the scent of my pride
no Satan's pawn can escape my commend
would you be there to sentence my revenge?

The princess is coming, the princess returns.
The princess is mourning, the princess will kill BelzebÃº.

Wildest desire, eternal fire, He'll be the one to die.
He's not a stranger, demon not angel He's just a threat for us
rage and affection, starting an action to overthrow this Hell.
