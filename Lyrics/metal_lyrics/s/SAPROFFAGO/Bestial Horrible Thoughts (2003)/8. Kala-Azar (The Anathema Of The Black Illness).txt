Kala-azar... the anathema of the black illness
Kala-azar... kala-azar !!!

In the Indian forest, the black illness is hidden,
surrounding in the environment!!!
Infecting the children, the venom in their blood,
feeling a fucking pain!!!
The colour of their faces is totally lost,
but they are still alive!!!

Nobody suspicious... it is a lethal virus
Fucking them with diarrhoea... intestinal decay
Dying in abeyance... looking into the abyss
