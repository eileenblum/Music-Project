Open your eyes after a long dream
Look around surgeons equipped with instruments
Something in your organism is eating you slowly
Your rancid guts eared meal for worms

Worms in your flesh... let me vomit in your face
Worms in your flesh... let me vomit in your breast
Worms in your flesh... let me vomit in your lips
Belch dying, beseech in your bed!!!

Open your eyes, look at the meadow
Look around shadows, disgorging your flesh
Worms crawling, in your leprosy skin
Abscess in your legs, where the worms stay

Worms in your flesh... let me vomit in your face
Worms in your flesh... let me vomit in your breast
Worms in your flesh... let me vomit in your lips
Stinking flesh, rotten brain,
your pussy is putrid... putrid and bleeding [x4]
Worms in your flesh...
let me vomit in your face, worms in your flesh [x2]
Worms... in... your... belch... dying... beseech
...worms... go... out... the... whore... is sick

[Solo bass]

Worms go out... from your pores worms go out... from your throat
Worms go out... from your thorn the whore is sick
...is rotten and bleeding [x2]
