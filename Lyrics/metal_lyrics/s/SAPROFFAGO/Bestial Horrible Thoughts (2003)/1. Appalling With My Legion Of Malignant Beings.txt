The beast forehead... The beast haywire
I've already been infected... and I'll strew my hate

I'm convulsing black water, I have an internal bleeding
I cannot scream but I express my pain with a groan,
And my mouth is bleeding

I'm fighting... against some hungry zombies
While my faith... is dying, I'm in the swamp
But the beast... feels my presence and wants my flesh
And my lids... are bleeding almost frozen and white

Now I'm a zombie, a repulsive beast
I'm looking for the beast, he must die
Rotten... fluids... gushing... from my throat

Now I'm a damned beast... appalling
Breeding a new legion... of servants
But the other beast has... fierce zombies
We have brutal plans... to domain
It will be total gore...
Armageddon!!! Armageddon!!!

Emerging from the sewage of kill
Desecrating graves looking for adepts
We have been damned forever
And I'll strew the brutalism vengeance
...I'm vile
and the beast has been killed by my hand

Die... devoured
Die... in my jaws
Die... in your neck
Die... dethroned

We have been damned forever
And I'll strew the brutalism vengeance

Die... devoured
Die... in my jaws
Die... in your neck (by my jaws)
Die... dethroned

Devoured, devoured, devoured, devoured
