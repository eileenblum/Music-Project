Scavenger dwellers
I saw among the shadows, some zombies bellowing
I have been ambushed, for several black vultures
The valley of the filthiness, has a smell of corpse
There are ruthless vampires, thirsty and ravenous...roar

I'm running for my life, when they will kill me?
I'm gonna lose the knowledge, but I need to be alive
I have been whacked again, gutted almost cripple
There are zombies behind me, emerging from their crypts

Devouring a corpse... a naked little girl
She was trisected... a zombie foams in her pussy
Trapped in a town... it is a nightmare
I cannot see... everything is turning black... black!!!

Hideous mutants, eating putrid flesh
I'm dying slowly, my blood is turning black
I have some wounds, suppurating pus
I'm defaced and doused, with my blood

Bloodthirsty zombies, bloodthirsty vampires,
hideous mutants, waiting for fresh blood,
with its fucking jaws, they are gonna bleed me,
but I refuse, I' m still alive...alive!!!

Hideous mutants, eating putrid flesh
I'm dying slowly, my blood is turning black
I have some wounds, suppurating pus
I'm defaced and doused, with my blood

[Lead guitar]

I was looking for a way to escape,
but I fell in a septic pool...
exactly in a pile of corpses
