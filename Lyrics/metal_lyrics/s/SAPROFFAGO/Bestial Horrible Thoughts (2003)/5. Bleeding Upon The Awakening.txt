Bleeding upon the awakening!!!
Femurs carved in pieces, collecting bones and skulls
You are a sadist man, killing children and women
Cutting out their embryos, to make them part of the
Gallery of the murder, and the most unfair... for the human mind

It shatters you the mind, thinking with will be
The rebirth of you dreads, you will be the heir
You are among people, and waiting for killing
In the same way, that your father did it
You will be... just like him... pathologically... proved

Who is your next victim, can you know it?
Maybe a pregnant woman or a little girl
Preparing your knife, to fuck a child
A child is crying while, is fucked with a knife

Can you hear?.. A loud scream...
pathologically proved... they are going to die

With inhuman force, you have been endowed
Waiting for your victim, to cut his throat
To sort pulling out the skin, to extract the dorsal thorn
To scatter the skull to stabs, to draw off teeth with pliers

You are a shapeless seed
You collect blood from your victims
You are a brutal butcher
Killing children and women
Cutting out their embryos
To make them part of the
Gallery of the murder
And the most unfair...
for the human mind... mind... mind... mind...
to make part of the...
Bleeding upon the awakening!!!

Bleeding upon the awakening!!!

Femurs carved in pieces, collecting bones and skulls
You are a sadist man, killing children and women
Cutting out their embryos, to make them part of the
Gallery of the murder, and the most unfair...
for the human mind... mind!!!
