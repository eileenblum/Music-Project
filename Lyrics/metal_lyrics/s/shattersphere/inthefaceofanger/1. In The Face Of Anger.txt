I'll never back down in the face of anger

I always live in a world of fear
It's in my mind, but it has brought me here

Invoking feelings, hating
Mind and body, separating
I'll fight till my last breath, but only to take yours away

You'll never breathe again
You'll never see the light of day
That's the price you pay

Repel it all away from me,
In your mind I define transparency
