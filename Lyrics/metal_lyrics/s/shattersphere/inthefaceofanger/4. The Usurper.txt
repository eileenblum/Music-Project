Take my rights, right with my mind
Now enslave me
Bending backwards, in a bind
The rain still hates me

I have risen in this time of need
A false icon indeed

To take my life back for me
Take away all I have to say

To take my life back for me
Take it away, take it away, and

Don't deny me
You'll never find the way

Every reason needs a cause
Silent screaming
For no reason I have fought
Still believing

Wrinkles in Time, take back what's mine
