And on into the eternal nether,
I forever bare witness,
To forgotten and stricken souls.
Calling forth from the endless abyss,
Guide us,
Lead us from this realm, of neither heaven nor hell.

Long ago forgotten, all of those they left behind,
have long since turned to dust.
Faded out of living memory, no one left to care.
Forgotten and Stricken souls, have since turned to despair.

They have not, found themselves in heaven, hell or purgatory.
Simply the eternal nether of non-existence.
I am the Opiate of the blind, catalyst for the ignorant.
In this role I lead an endless, ethereal life.

All their lives they were lied to,
Forced to believe in a god that doesn't exist,
Now they have witnessed, what truly lies beyond.
Knowing they never shall rest they wander aimlessly,
Sol shall lead them,
To their final, unconscious rest.

I have lead many souls to rest,
But rest for me, never shall come.
I submit to a life in limbo,
To help those who cannot help-themselves.

This is my solace, this is my redemption.
I sacrifice myself, I have no remorse.
I have found peace, this is my epitaph.

There is nothing, why do you linger here.
Follow me, I shall guide you to eternal
Unconscious rest, and peace.

In this Haven of ineptitude I gaze beyond the void.
And from this sanctuary I travel beyond the grasp of God.
Beyond this eternal nether of non existence I shall lead,
And offer them all to follow me to final unconscious rest.
