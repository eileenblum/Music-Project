Was I so blind to see
That I had been mislead
That worshiping your god
Iâd lead a life of regret

So I reject your teachings
And carve my own path
Through true satanic preachingâs
His will I do exact

Serve Satan in this life
Do not believe the lies
Indulge yourself as you please

In hell this is not a sin
But actively encouraged
Without and from within

Better to reign in hell
Than serve in heaven
Do not fear the lake of fire

That fate is reserved, for Christian fools
You have given into sin, do not despair
You have simply done, Satanâs will
And shall be rewarded in hell
