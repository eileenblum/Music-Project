Of the infernal legion of hell
Shall beckon forth, winds of pestilence
So you shall know of its arrival
In its wake none can withstand

God musters his army of angels
To do battle, with Satan once again
How naÃ¯ve to think hell dormant
Angels shall, fall, again, from-grace

His ever watchful gaze
Cast firmly on the realm of god
Always watching, waiting
His time will come
And I pray for the day, that I shall stand
And bear witness
Unto the destruction, of this world
And from the ashes, shall rise a new power

The vengeance of Lucifer is at hand
The infernal legion of hell he does command
Before, this terrible army
Not even, god can withstand
The world will be plunged into chaos
Fire-scorns this holy land
We hear their cries, they beg for mercy
But we delight, from the terror, in their eyes

Delight from the terror in their eyes

Why don't they see
That what they believe
Means nothing to me
They are a disease

Of the infernal legion of hell
Shall ravage forth
And rape the world with pride
As we torch their holy places
Watch, as, they flee and hide

The tide of battle has begun to sway
Watch, the holy, flee in fear
Only now it becomes clear
The world, is now, a burning sphere

Finally on this day
Of total devastation and war
I stand by the side of my lord
And bear witness
Unto the glorious apocalypse
And watch as he smiles grimly
At the death of they
Who hath imprisoned him
And would have seen it so forever more
Freed from his icy prison
The world shall know a new order

Why don't they see
That what they believe
Means nothing to me
They are a disease
