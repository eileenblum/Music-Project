This rending feeling inside me
Of if he should return
There is only one solution
The saviourâs tomb must burn
Burn down the tomb in which Jesus lies
His resurrected flesh he cannot hide
Accordingly I have spoken
His body must be broken
Find the bastard son
The true lordâs work is done

The second coming of Christ
Must not come to pass
You want to know my name
I am the cursed Judas
On the highest rise of hell
As witnessed by Dante
I am tortured where I lie
I shall return one day

I am come, go now a cleanse this land
We shall eradicate them with a brutal hand
No mercy for fools, they had their chance
Watch them beg for their repentance
