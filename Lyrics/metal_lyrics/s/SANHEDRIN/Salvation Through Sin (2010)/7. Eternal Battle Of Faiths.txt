A hopeless assault on our enemy lines
Never give up on our unholy fight
Death to these fools that stand in our way
With weapon in hand our foes we do slay
They hold the fort but we hold the key
10,000 strong, they all obey me
With weapon in hand I order attack
A volley of death rains down on their back

As we charge their lines
We see their hateful eyes
Never looking back
This day we do attack

Their defences be smashed
Their necks will be slashed
We gash out their eyes
And spill out their brains

After all this death, we look on, in horror
As we realise, this was but, the first,
Line of their defence, I rally, my men
And prepare to fight on, and on, and on
Prepare to fight on

Finally, after a long and bloody-fight
We penetrate, their-force-at-night
I see my brothers mutilated
War is a terrible thing I hate it
Terrible vengeance fills out hearts
An eye for an eye, it must be done
To satiate our terrible hate

Their defences be smashed
Their necks will be slashed
We gash out their eyes
And spill out their brains

I have their general in my sight
His fate is sealed, on this night
A thousand times I hack his face
This entire war is a disgrace
But still with compulsion we fight more
To bring an end this tyrannical war
To my children I pray more and more
That you will not have to know war
