In holy Gethsemane,
Where the bastard son doth walk
His time in this world, is coming to an end
His lies have been revealed
30 pieces of silver
Is all it takes, to condemn the holy son

Acta Sanctorum
The deed of the saints

Judas, the betrayer, has proven, his worth
Make way, for the true lord, the die, is cast

Acta Sanctorum
The deed of the saints

The false, prophet, has been found
Preaching, to, the last
On bended knee, asking-father-for-guidance

In the gardens of Gethsemane
He must be seized, his lies shall cease
Brutally beaten, he offers no resistance
Before the mighty, sons of Satan

Dragged bleeding from the holy garden
Oh, how the weakling disciples wept
They stood by watching
As their lord was taken
But us in hell, will await his crossing
