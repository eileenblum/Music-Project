How do you expect us
To listen or to follow
Your words hold no meaning
And your promises are hollow

Maybe instead of praying
I should stop pretending
Iâll take this knife, intending
And kill you unrelenting

How will you react
To see your body, not-intact
This is the price of your lying
Your Godâs not prevented you dying

I am the one
Who will enlighten us from
The blasphemy upon
Satanâs deluded sons

My unholy blade
Has finally cut through
The truth about your lies 
You are judged in Satanâs eyes 

Thou art the liar
Now, I see the truth 
Thou art the liar
Lying through your teeth
Thou art the liar
Now I see the truth
I have found my path

These lies you tell
As far as lies go
Are an atrocity to man
You had failed once you began

No longer do we listen
None of us now follow
Your words have lost their meaning
Your faith is truly hollow

Now instead of praying 
I act upon my will
Itâs you who will come begging
In Satan's name I kill

How will you, react
To see your body, not-intact
This is the price of your lying
Your Godâs not prevented you dying
