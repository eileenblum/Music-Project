Jesus
I sold your soul and then sold mine
In this field filled with blood
First with yours and now with mine
Repentant will I ever-be
This place is paid for with your life
Akeldama

A servant no more
Under the shadow of you
I shall live no more
Through this act of betrayal
I shall carve out my own place in history

30 pieces of silver
Is all it takes, to condemn the holy son
Acta Sanctorum, the deed of the saints
That is what, they shall say of me

King of the Jews, but not king over me
Betrayed by his own, betrayed, by me
King of the Jews, but not king over me
Betrayed by his own, betrayed, by me

The lord is dead
Oh God, what have I done
Take back this blood money
And let me live out my days
In years of silent sorrow
Why

I can know no peace in this world
There is only one release
From my conscience
I take this rope
And offer myself unto-thee
Akeldama
My body and my life, I pay as my sacrifice
Akelama
In these fields paid for by my crime
I shall hang
