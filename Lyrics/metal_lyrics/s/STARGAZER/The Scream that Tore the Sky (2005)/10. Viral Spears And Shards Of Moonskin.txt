Swill crystalline waters
From the daughters that haunt the mountains
Weaving their skin over the sun

The reflection was stunning

Trees hum their lustrous songs
Wish to ride the greenest leaves
When rains bring the rainbows and earth's energies collide

A dawn of reckoning
Language will reassume splendidity

Deepest oceans will teem with abyssic beings
Escaped the sharded glaciers

Truths will be foreseen

Exchanging solemn bows to the fiery hearted goblins
At peace, the earth rises to greet me
