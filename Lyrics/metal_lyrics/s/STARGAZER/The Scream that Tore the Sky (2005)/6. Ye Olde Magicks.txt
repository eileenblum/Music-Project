harbringer, carrying thy holy burdenUn-worked stones of time The grass tall on the hollow hillsSorrowed faeries ceased to fastHis circles and symbols, attracted the spiritsOf whom thought lost His prayers to them and summonsDrew the moisture from the ground around himThe lids of each his eyes, malformed to his forefingers, left and rightHis voices, a parody of gibberish The catalysis began with the rising of the seasWhen the powers made the material descentHis melting torso showered the childrenWith conditional understanding Creatures that dwelt in the clayUpheaved the ocean floor in cloudsBillowing red sand They have awakened to cleanseAnd heal the spiraling worlds Claimed long forgooten ages agoHe spoke of nightmarish malice, but the beauty Incomparable, these aliens brought this planet lifePurifying in graceful slaughter
