I interviolate law, through the starExecrate to a sanctuary aside coresOf immaterial nebulaeSwarming and bloated with crystallis Obscure thrushes sufferedReside on opiate dreamsDream besidePlant of dawning kabalah Infected inside out with hormonous tarReject into demons of the bleeding tattoosFor there, the alien artifactsHold secrets, encompassed in un-oxidized membrace Chaotic, undefined proverbial guidanceBy which all prophets dieBy which all written lawsFalter in presence Learn thus; order is pettyThe sane exit throughTheir will and ownHated expectation
