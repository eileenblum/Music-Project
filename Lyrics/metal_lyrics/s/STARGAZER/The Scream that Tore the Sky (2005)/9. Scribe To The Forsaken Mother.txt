Airing art tranquil bells
Stand, turn, gaze upon oceans adrift
Within, uplifted to the breast of the sphinx

The mediation of day to nightfall
Casts a crimson phenomenate

Unrest, broke stirrings
Of whose death agonized from extinction

A transition to nature
Nor even the dead at peace

Poetic words of shrouds and hearts
Riding fantastic deities
As was truth afar from saviourists teachings

Thee god-spoken 
Will fall prey
To the mothering figurehead

A transition to nature
