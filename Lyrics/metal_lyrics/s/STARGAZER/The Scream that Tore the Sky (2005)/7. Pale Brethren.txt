Meajsty, broke the bread in twoEtched in it a caricature smiling wickednessFrothing vulture leering from the fire Miscarriage of phoenix!Rises on pallid wingsPray be the air that taketh it Divorced from beyond, spun from siltFoul breath, stringentBe cast and dispel Lest distraught the blooming fieldsMay thy bowels rot Poison what is left of thy insipid fetishThe burning smoke of itRaise me to the outer Circle the moon and be forever in search of the true brethrenMy trail, ashen in wake, a path for all to seeReturn will I, my cycle is tenfoldYet to be seen here They are to comeDispatch thy monarchBurn thy altarsWe are, they are...
