The bronze star of sin
Cried in years amass blackened twine
Light bane
Steroid driven glimpse
Intense millenium

Alien pulse riding the skies

Marred by the tranquil
Yield to the endless swamp
Fit for mystic mules
The waking is yore

The sullen diamond masks
Mirage despoling the madness
In which we will be
Ultimately consumed

Mirage
Despoling the madness...
