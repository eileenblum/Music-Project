[performed by StarGazer]I now bleed in my mortal sleep
Stains everywhere in
Sign to the sun wrecked morning
Unending pain I suffer to the paranormal misgiving

A final orgasm forecloses the undead energy
To evolve and mature
My necro-animalian psychos
Simplified self being initiates thoughts impure

We hatefuck your struggling soul
Filth, mud, blood, surge down putrid walls
Bones still animate, cum in your skull
With thorn encrusted cock, my shaft chews remains

Reinstated colostomical, trashing
Our intelligence extrovergence messing

Indulge, resolve the ploy
Slay the true gods, eat astral loin

Clock of coagulated toad slops chimes
Bow heads in remembrance of the human cries

Safe in this demi-plane
Alive in heart and sinning with bestial pride
