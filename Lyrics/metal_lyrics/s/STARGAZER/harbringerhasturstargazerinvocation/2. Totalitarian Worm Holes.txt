[performed by StarGazer]This is my divinity
It hath the smell of my blood
Churning universal hatred
Threaten and lament for the stricken

Tainted impulses - bursting free the purple womb
Scorn ultimatum - impartial affair between mind and
flesh obscene
Mighty blacked oak scars me for eternity
Its silhouette burning recesses untouched

Ever burning deity
Yet the arctic winds blow archaic chaos 
Autumnic rains
Boil the steaming dirt

Graves swell with loathing
Plunging my arms in - retrieving the immortalists
I pact and reunite, "Our Bodies Are One"...

Abominative fumes ignite
Screaming to the five winds of Sodom
Of which now is resurrect

Of its shameless prismatic spheres
