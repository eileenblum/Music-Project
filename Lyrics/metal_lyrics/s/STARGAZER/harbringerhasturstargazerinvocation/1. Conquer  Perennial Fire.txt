[performed by StarGazer]The ruling is nigh...

Behold this sceptre -
Adorned with ruin

Mediator on our impetuous flight of carrion
Searing hearts envision war
Possessed with undead rage and
Knowledge from surpassed times
Taking to arms, vanquishing with immolative fury

Foes of whom foolish to stare our faces - petrify
Thrive on the essence of their fear - for our power

Savage trolls derelict in light
Embodied in flesh drawn from this Earth
Our collective minds foaming spite
Smeared by truth

Conquer, Purify...

We shall thrive in our polished castles
The weak will claw at the walls
