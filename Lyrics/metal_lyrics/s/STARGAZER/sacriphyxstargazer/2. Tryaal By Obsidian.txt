Black sire of polarities

Twin pyramids, mirroring my anti-christ
Twin pyramids, a beacon to my Christ

Black sire of polarities
Quantum Man of Mer

Twin pyramids, mirroring my anti-christ
Twin pyramids, a beacon to my Christ

Frozen images, glaring gibbous from the hewn and cut womb
Primality transmogrified
Hypnotized

The conscious streaming into celestite vortice
A tap to the absolution
Quantum Man of Mer

Hydras locked in a trivial orbit
Lonesome Hydrae
Enveloped in Infinite
And ignorant of the All
But it is mortality restored to ignorance
We chose before the Fall

Lonesome Hydrae
Enveloped in Finite
Quantum Man in black
Quantum Man of Mer
