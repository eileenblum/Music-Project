I am of infinitesimal cellsIn each lies a worldMy bloodA swirling vortex of space Through it,Life moves at constantsGreater than minds conceiveKing of the WorldBanish this spirit,And those of my brothersOf demons and hexes Black eyes demonsWho speak and actThrough the ghastlyDeeds of manGlib tongued demonsAfoul, afoot Carve them unto my heartA devic libationAt the sculpted fountainGlaring and powerfulAbove the entranceTo the monastery of my selves Father DragonFather GnosisFather ForeFather Wise
