Heir to us trust oh highestGods &amp; forevermore speakIn the coloured serpent dialectOf first flock and watery origins Stirreth clay to broil andBreathe bountiful angels To never, tread stale waters &amp;Scavenge among buzzardIs righteous; foremost toProper exultationExalt in the heavenThe earth &amp; the just Conciliate the primevalPact in hornsSprint alike fevered,Demented beastsOnto rusty, shodden gatesBehind which hide wightsBrandishing ignorant evils So the tempered fury eruptsWith swirling moons to crushTsunami warmongers saluteThe sun &amp; submergeElliptical floods purify &amp; purge Red redemptionContorts a vastnessA fatal creatrix swallows the skySmokey talons smiteVicarious Inner gongs pealIn maddened pitch Affluent in all highestThe wraith of wrathful lightsStreams into the fore
