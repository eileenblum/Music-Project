Sail the vast and great under-keep
Immaculate citadel
Spills a steady seep
Psychic dark,
Thick as wine a starry weep

Faceless purveyors
From golden angles
Steal into within
Formless composite, unreal

A stolen glance brings fever, distress
Lunatic choir, glow-eyed marionettes
Lost to abandon and a wild jig

Inter-dimensional carrion birds prey
Ablative skins out of time
Pray for my spirit out of time!
Re-animate through
Dead orgone pulses
This vortex spun weaves of
Chaotic, negative force
A new pantheon takes shape
In sulphur scented shadows!

Undead lords on high
Wreak rotting intrigue
Monsters of Delta-Time

I ran hard, I rode pale
Those creatures in myth
They were to hunt me now
But my escape,
Would they haunt me ever, over?
They haunt me ever, over...
