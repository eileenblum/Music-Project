Shrunken rune
They called God-sent
Drags irreverently in tow
Their hisses draw close,
Stop &amp; turn
Dematerialized again!

I know the secret path,
They could not follow
Searing chord
Umbilical to me, and this...

Where is the sign?
Damn the Scripts
This mud so thick

A stone wound in the marsh,
Here it ends

The watery concave
Cut in granite
Into which I dive, psychic sight,
awash in waves

Blind serpents clasp my form
The water speaks; I scream
Serpent song

Vile curtain luminous
Bore down against the axis
Portrait in magnetic hues

Now sung
The white being aborted
Ancestors, it says
Takes my hands
Three hearts
Unsung drown
