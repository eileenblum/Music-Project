Mass atop, to below
A tower of cities
Aground upon, a barren abyss
Unseemly, yet once almighty

Glyphs traced in the
Salty stone, history
Of flourishing gnome
Aborted, crucified and conquered
In momentary glory,
Now varnished in occult, in verse
Colossal splendor, plummeting

With flickering lantern in hand
I descend into the earth
Passing stone to sun
They shall witness I Martyr
United with our world

Choke the sulphur
It blackens my face, my tears

Sightless, yet the know me
Hate me
