When the world sharedA dream of deathsThe elderly tugged atThe sleeves of childrenBegging opulentEnlightenment andFaraway redemption In a form, young, and castBy the sun of a new ageThose whom live theRenewed continuum The first breathOf the newbornSweetest, dense inSapience, in purityA prize vapor storedA grail alchemically adored Hear me, people of wiresOf device, machinationsThe division growsWidened to an horrific gulf Commit ye to Man, the beastOr drown nakedThe infallible pandemoniumThat runs course fromWounds, of the World'sAnd thy own dissipating auraThe Way of the WorldIs thy Way Refractive convex continuum
