Slit wings of despondency
Simian strings in woe
The hushed choir that insist
Horn-white demons
Behold they slough

Vista steeped in Chitauri luster
Interrupts my angel and heart
In that palpitating bliss
True life was, remiss

Who would raise this
Shell from the granite slab
Faithless vultures circle slowly,
Madly in this stark,
Stony desert
One could forget, humanity

Creepers blanket and shadow
As thick black lichen
Store my fats
Black magikkians pass
Libate partly unto
Sorrow and horror
Fearing the weep
Incensed by the presence of
Their parent demons

Purge flesh, of the serpent's kiss
Urge flesh and splintered child
From its aeons embrace
