The oceans of Leviathan
Bathed in permanance
Drowned in the formaldehyde
He exists in the deep un-fathomed light

I am sworn to incubate the messiash
Of the final transgression

Enslaved in glacial bonds
Though delivered, to taxiderm
The conclusive race
First and last creation

Pursuing the trivial ageing in pre-meditation

Poltergeist spawn on the tree of life
Scars will aflame, stiches will bust
As physical holocaust is rehearsed

Lord of the everglade
Reogniroro will hatch
Hierarchy and scum will end

The ultimate knowledge is death
Infinite is existence, until reached, is this
