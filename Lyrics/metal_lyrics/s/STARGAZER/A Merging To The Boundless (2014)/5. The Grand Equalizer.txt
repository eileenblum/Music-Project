His slovenly lordship, spits phlegmy ages
Yawns the weary aches
Of Death, from his bones
An evil olde sol was he

Woe a black skull ensconced in bones
Insinuating One
He who hammers myth hard on the forge

Woe the ages, so many weary moons
Petrified him, inside to out
Insidiously

From one church, through temples
A winding trail
Gloriou gold paved roads
So many sacrifices

All love became sand
Outside the hourglass
Poured into the palm
Slips surely through frail fingers

That blazing sun under my lids, behind my teeth
Lay dead on the precipice of the abyss

Creeping up to engulf mine eye
To steal my vision complete
To steal all colours
One by one
