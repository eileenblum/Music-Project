The man's wizened stance
And his knotted thunder staff
Reducing man and beast to naught
Magick that diseases steel
For be (and they) cannot return

A vacuum only prime man sees
A universal war left us stranded by decree
In fear of reprisals, we hallowed this earth
A geocentric kiss, a taint of our deepest skin

The Greyed swords, bejewelled in two black orbs
Those gods in turning fires
You partook of their essence

An oblivion and chaos rife, flesh in turmoil
A bond in whoredom, man
Whoredom by the hands of these
Emblazoned mastery, flyers of the Wheel

Serpent sigil aloft on stolen wings
They dare speak unto us as gods
Draw us from the earth in droves
Our minds bent back wards
