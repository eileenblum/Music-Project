I play for them
A sermon
To summon

Lurch through planes
Folding spatial time

They saith I play with passions unbound
Voyce thy silent choir,
Alien harmonies I'll not hear, here
Lest they will it, in slumber, in trance
And tumult have.

Parasites, dictates, ghostly masons
Coalesce in corners of this abode
Swirling, deepening, downewards, darknesse
Night weary shadows

Darknesse!

Sing to me
I learn, I scribe
Belated realisation of
Concealed magick!

Bless me, ye!
Secretion of lack, and light
To tame the wild
Ghostly traffick!
