Perched on bones of dissent
Interloper from the Fourth
Sate, desire to sicken
Dissonance
Corruption
Born of the Source

Faith weighs a blade
Segregating the human congregate

Masked, sallow, His face
Waxes and wanes
Flaxen and feign

All our wayward have truly lost their way
Suffer the lost, the procured children
All prayers to the Lord, retract them now
The Lord is one mask
Masque of Gammon!
