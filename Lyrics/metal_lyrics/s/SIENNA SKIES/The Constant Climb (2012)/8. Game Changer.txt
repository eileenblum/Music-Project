I see through the clouds and I see through the fog
The view from above just isn't enough

Now I see
Now I'm hearing
Now I feel
No insecurity

Once there was doubt that I would not get here
But I believed and you believed no fear
I held no fear, I held a feeling
Now take notice of this human being

So times have changed and I can honestly say that I want you to tell me
Why you won't put faith in me
And after everything it seemed to take forever
I dare you to tell me
That you won't put faith in me

Take notice of this human being, I will be the light you're seeing
It's time to take notice!

So times have changed and I can honestly say that I want you to tell me
Why you won't put faith in me
And after everything it seemed to take forever
I dare you to tell me
That you won't put faith in me

And slowly as you take it in
The faith you hold in hand is something that will always be doubted
And when you choose to say that you don't believe in me
What is it you don't believe in?
What is it that you don't hold faith in?
What is it, I'll prove it
I'll show that I am worth it
