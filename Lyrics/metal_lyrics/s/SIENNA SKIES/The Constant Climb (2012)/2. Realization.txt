I don't know what I am doing but my intentions were high
Even when I'm confident my mind is filled with doubt
Even when I'm struggling you know what I'm about
Because my mind is taking over me and my heart's no longer guiding me

Heavy heart is what was weighing me down, Heavy Heart

No matter where I look, No matter where I go my spirit seems dampened
I know with doubt in my mind I will survive and achieve what I've set out to do

So here and now my heart pulls me under deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper

Feels like my life has no guidance
I know that I'll find it, I'll know when I've found it
Searching for something that I truly need and I know that it's out there
And I know that it's coming

No matter where I look, No matter where I go my spirit seems dampened
I know with doubt in my mind I will survive and achieve what I've set out to do

I'm filled with doubt here and now
I need something, I need someone

I'm needing guidance to help me through this
To help me through this
My doubt is consuming me, It's swallowing me whole

It is consuming me and I am falling to my knees
Someone help me please
Help me please
I need to find a way out of this mess
