As I look out across the crowd I see so many faces
And now I'm here I still see many faces
Faces that judged, faces of non believers
And when you asked I told you I'd achieve this

There was some doubt in my mind
But I was determined to prove all of you so wrong
There was some space in my head
But I was determined to prove to you all I'm the one

And when it came down to it the proof was there and clear
I was determined to prove to you that I'm the one just to make it clear

I need to make it clearer cause you can't seem to see it
You thought I was a dreamer, Maybe I was a dreamer
But im the one who changed things, changed them all for the better
And when you tried to judge me I showed you I was better

And when it came down to it the proof was there and clear
I was determined to prove to you that I'm the one just to make it clear

In the shadows you hid from everything you tried to judge
And that's including what I've done

I know what I've accomplished and that is more than you expected
And you expected nothing

I know what I accomplished
I know
I'm proud of what I accomplished
I'm proud
What do you have to say now?
