I've come so far without a compass
You lighten darkened paths
When I was lost, you were there and you helped lead the way

You gave me strength with actions
You gave me strength with words
You show that there's a way that show that dreams come true

I'm taking steps through this enchanted place
You light up foot paths with all of your grace
I know that you are there with me through this
You know that you helped pave the way for us

I was about to give up but you gave me the strength to find my way

I'm taking steps through this enchanted place
You light up foot paths with all of your grace
I know that you are there with me through this
You know that you helped pave the way for us

I have new found strength
You were my compass and you helped lead the way
