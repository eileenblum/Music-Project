The time has come to take my steps up to the top
The time has come to make sure I secure my spot
And now I'm here I know that I will conquer
And now I'm here the wait won't be much longer

Now the time has come to leave footprints and prove that this worlds mine
It's my time
I will take my steps up to the top of this world
This worlds mine, It's my time

Now that I'm staring back at the path I chose
I know that I have destroyed these roads
So I know that I'm the only one who could make this journey

And when it comes to everything I've done I know now that I'm the only one
The one runs things, The one who shuns things

It is my time

Now that I'm staring back at the path I chose
I know that I have destroyed these roads
So I know that I'm the only one who could make this journey

And when it comes to showing them
Showing the undeservers, Showing I really am
I am on top of the world

And now that I've made it my life's slowly changing
