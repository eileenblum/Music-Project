Overwhelmed by the thought of whats in front of me
Overwhelmed that I've been given my chance to show the world
I know that I will find the strength to conquer
I know that I have the will to accomplish

I've wasted days watching undeserving beings carried
I know that I will show that I'm deserving

I know that I will show the world that I'm deserving

And when the judging eyes are set to cast right over me
I will show them all just why I've been given this opportunity

I've proven myself time and time again
To be given a chance to show that I'm deserving

I've wasted days watching undeserving beings carried
I know that I will show that I'm deserving
And when it comes to being judged I know that I'm deserving
And when they say I'm not enough I know that I'm deserving

And when it comes to being judged I know that I'm deserving
And when they say I'm not enough I know that I'm deserving

And now I can show you just what I'm going to do
And that is show the world, Show them that I'm deserving
I will show at first glance that these my fixations
I've been given a chance to stand on strong foundations
