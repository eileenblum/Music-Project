I will pose a question whether I am good enough to face this scary world
I know that if I find a way through this I will just prevail and be shown the way
But maybe not as my own worst enemy's myself
And I know my strengths and weaknesses alike
All I can do is attempt and I can do is try

But my strength can also be my worst weakness

I keep on running and running in circles always trying to find my feet
Stand up tall and strong
I don't know if I needed guidance or if I really have the strength
To take on everything

I am struggling to find a reason why I can prevail as I can't explain it to myself
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can beat this
I don't know if I can achieve this
I don't know if I am right for this

But my strength can also be my worst weakness

I keep on running and running in circles always trying to find my feet
Stand up tall and strong
I don't know if I needed guidance or if I really have the strength
To take on everything

I don't know my strength, I know my weakness

There's no way that I can do this
There's no way I can face this on my own
I know that I can't do this
But I will use this chance I've been given

I don't think that I can do this
I don't think that I have the confidence
I do not have the strength or anything I need to keep moving on

I know that there's a chance that they see something that I don't
But I don't have the strength to take on everything I know
I don't know if I can do this
I don't think that I have the confidence
But maybe they see something
Maybe they believe in me
