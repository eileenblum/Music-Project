Working tirelessly to prove to them that I am worth something
No matter what I do I always go unseen
No matter what I do I'm always overlooked

How can you seem to be ahead of them yet always seem to be last in line
I see this day to day but I can't change their ways
How can so much work be overlooked

It's sad to see so much reward for feet that don't make prints
How can a man achieve so much yet always seem to be overlooked

How can you seem to be ahead of them yet always seem to be last in line
I see this day to day but I can't change their ways
How can so much work be overlooked

This is my triumph, my chance to show of just how much it took to let you know
I know within myself that I am now a better man
A stronger person, I took my chance
And now I've found myself!
