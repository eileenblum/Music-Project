I will keep on climbing, I am almost there
I will keep on fighting against the feelings of corruption

There was once a time where I was down in the dumps
And now my chances are limitless, I have the chance to take it further

Fighting against temptations of corruption
Try to let go, let go of all the demons

I need to stop reaching higher before it ends up taking me
Drowning me in deeper water I need to set myself free
I need to let go of the demons, I need to be content
And now I have my chance I'll show that I'm the best

Fighting against temptations of corruption
Try to let go, let go of all the demons

Sooner or later this may just take me in
I known that I can be stronger, I may just need my friends

I will need the ones I love to help keep me grounded
I won't just float away if you can keep me grounded

Sooner or later this may consume me
I know that I am stronger if you can just help me

I know I won't float away so please just hear the words I say
I will need the ones I love
I know I will stay grounded
