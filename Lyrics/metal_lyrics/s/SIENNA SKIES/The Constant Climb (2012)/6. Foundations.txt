I found strength where I never thought I'd find
I've found my way here and I know it's right this time
You doubt me but I know where I will be
I found my way here and I'm never looking back

I'm still standing

When my hand was out for help you were nowhere to be found
Give me a reason why that recognition should go to you

I standing on foundations that I built my own surroundings
This is my reason
These are my reasons I'm here
And I have my eyes set on the path that is ahead of
These are my reasons

And I'm standing on foundations that I've built and I won't budge
These are my reasons I lead myself and my eyes are set on the future

I'm standing on solid foundations
And I've told you once and I've told you twice and I'll tell you three times
You never helped me so don't claim that you did
And I can't believe that you ever doubted me

I standing on foundations that I built my own surroundings
This is my reason
These are my reasons I'm here
And I have my eyes set on the path that is ahead of me
These are my reasons

These are my reasons I lead myself
My own foundations are strong enough
I will never take, never take any steps back
I will always have my eyes set on the future, forget the past
Forget it
