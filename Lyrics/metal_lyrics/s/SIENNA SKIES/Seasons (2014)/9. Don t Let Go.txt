So you know I'm always there and I'm going nowhere.
Don't let go of anything we're sharing.
Nothing could ever beat the happiness I'm feeling.
I really hope this lasts forever.
Sometimes there's distance between us,
Other times we're side by side.
No matter what we have something special.
Something we hope lasts forever.
This feeling is better than anything I've felt before.
This feeling is better than anything at all.
So you know, I'm always there and I'm going no where.
Don't let go of anything we're sharing.
Nothing could ever beat the happiness I'm feeling.
I really hope this lasts forever.
No matter what I will be there with you through everything.
When I say this believe me I mean it,
I'll be with you through it all.
You and me against everything in sight.
You and me, our future is so bright.
Looking forward with you by my side.
Looking forward I'd give my life for this.
In heart and spirit I'll always be there.
Looking forward I'd give my life for this.
