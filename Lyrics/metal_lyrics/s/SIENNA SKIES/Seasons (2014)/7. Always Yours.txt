I knew the day I met you that things would change forever.
And I knew that things were turning up just when I had given up.
You gave me reasons to love in such a loveless world.
So here we are growing stronger together.
And we know that we belong together.
You and me work like harmonies. I'm always yours.
I must have done something right in my life to be so lucky to strike gold.
I just want you to know that we are one until we grow old.
You gave me reasons to love in such a loveless world.
So here we are growing stronger together.
And we know that we belong together.
You and me we work like harmonies, I'm always yours.
I understand the meaning of this four letter word.
I have no shame in saying you're my entire world.
These words I speak, I speak the truth.
This heart that beats, It beats for you.
