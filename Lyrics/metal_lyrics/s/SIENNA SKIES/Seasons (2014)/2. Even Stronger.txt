Road blocks in every direction.
You were the one always there to set them.
Deep down you hoped I would fail.
You never thought that I would prevail.
I hope it hurts you to see what I have done.
You run your mouth and you tried to stop me but I stood strong.
You pulled me down but I kept on fighting, I'm refusing to give in.
I came, I saw, I conquered and threw it in your face.
Even when you're trying to kill me I came back even stronger.
Even when I kept on moving you kept on stopping me.
I'll do this just to prove you wrong, you were wrong about this.
I'll prove to you that I am strong, much stronger than this.
Breaking through against all the odds, showing you this is what I'm made for.
Even though you try to fight it I still keep proving you wrong.
Even though you can't deny it I still keep proving you wrong.
Bring it on, I'll continue to take it.
I will use it as fuel until I make it.
Even when you're trying to kill me I came back even stronger.
Even when I kept on moving you kept on stopping me.
I'll do this just to prove you wrong, you were wrong about this.
I'll prove to you that I am strong, much stronger than this.
I can feel it, I can sense it,
You tried to kill me but I'm not dead yet.
Even when you're trying to kill me I came back even stronger.
Even when I kept on moving you kept on stopping me.
I'll do this just to prove you wrong, you were wrong about this.
I'll prove to you that I am strong, much stronger than this.
