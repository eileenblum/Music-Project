There's just so much to say
About what's going on
In this game
There's just so much wrong

I've tried so hard to ignore
What is around me
But it's so evident
And it's my heart it's stealing

[Chorus:]
I've tried so hard
To turn a blind eye to this
But I can't hide
That my heart for this was stolen
In my bones
I still can feel the passion
Breaking through
At least I feel it somewhere

You're just so blinded
Because you're so involved
What ever happened to being legitimate
Time takes its toll

[Chorus:]
I've tried so hard
To turn a blind eye to this
But I can't hide
That my heart for this was stolen
In my bones
I still can feel the passion
Breaking through
At least I feel it somewhere

I feel it in my bones
I sure as Hell
Have to feel it somewhere
Because I don't have a heart
My heart for this was stolen

Pushing on
I can't ignore
Everything that's happening
And now my heart it's stealing

[Chorus:]
I've tried so hard
To turn a blind eye to this
But I can't hide
That my heart for this was stolen
In my bones
I still can feel the passion
Breaking through
At least I feel it somewhere

Why can't you realise
What you're doing
Where's the passion
Where's the feeling
You think that
You make a difference
All you're doing
Is destroying
Everything I ever wanted
