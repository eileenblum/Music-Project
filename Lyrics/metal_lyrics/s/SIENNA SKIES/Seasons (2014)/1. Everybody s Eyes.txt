Another wasted hour of a wasted day
Sitting around with not much to say
Of the time I spent
The years that I wasted
And all the bitterness I've tasted

Disappointment is all I show
Disappointing the ones
That surround me
No matter how hard I try
The disappointment
Is always surrounding me

I'm sorry
That I couldn't live up
To the expectations set
I'm sorry that I disappointed

I've tried to run
I've tried to hide
From the disappointment in everybody's
Everybody's eyes
And I apologise
For everything I've
Everything I've done
Now it's time to face my fears
Or turn around and run

Frustrated
That I'm not meeting expectations
I keep on trying
But nothing will please them
I applaud the ones who achieve
It's just not in my blood to succeed

Succeed

I'm sorry
That I couldn't live up
To the expectations set
I'm sorry that I disappointed

I've tried to run
I've tried to hide
From the disappointment in everybody's
Everybody's eyes
And I apologise
For everything I've
Everything I've done
Now it's time to face my fears
Or turn around and run

I'm trying to convince myself
To face these demons
I know I've disappointed
It's up to me to change it
I know I did not live up
To expectations set for me

I know that I frustrated
And for that I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I promise I will do my best
To face everything
But until then
I'll live with my demons
