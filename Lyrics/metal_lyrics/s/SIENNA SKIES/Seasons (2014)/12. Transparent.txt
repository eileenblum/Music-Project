Staying strong against all the hatred
I will throw it all back in their faces
Hypocrites always surround me
Enough of this, I am surviving

I am stronger than you think
I've put up with this for years
I am stronger than you think
I will survive this

All the hatred that you spread
Really shows that you're insecure
Who do you think you are?
You're nothing to no one, you're fake and you know it

Throw everything you have in my direction
Nothing you say will break my spirits

Rising above the persecution that is out there
Rising above everything that has been thrown at me
I'll always be living the life that I want to live
I'll always be in high spirits

Throw everything you have in my direction
Nothing you say will break my spirits
I can see right through you
You will forever be transparent

Say what you think, I will rise above
Say what you think, I will rise above
I'll rise above everything you've got to throw
Right at me, you're transparent

Throw everything you have in my direction
Nothing you say will break my spirits
I can see right through you
You will forever be transparent

You will never break my spirits
You will forever be transparent
