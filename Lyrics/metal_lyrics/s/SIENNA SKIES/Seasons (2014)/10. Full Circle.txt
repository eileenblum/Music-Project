I have no sympathy for what has happened.
Look in the mirror to see who caused these problems.
You made your bed, it's time to sleep in it.

No sympathy for what has happened.
You've got no one to blame.
You've kept on getting far too many chances.
You've got no one to blame.

Chances were all you ever had.
Failure is all you came to be.
Liar is all you ever were.
Failure is all you'll ever be.
You had a lot of chances to make things right.
You made your bed, it's time to sleep in it.

You tried to hide from all the things you've done.
A bitter taste of failure will be forever on your tongue.
Run away from all the problems that you caused.
Be afraid cause it will run its course.
Running from your problems trying to hide from them.
Running from your problems trying to hide.
