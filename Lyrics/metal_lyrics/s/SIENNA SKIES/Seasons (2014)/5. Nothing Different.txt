What has happened to the world we know?
If you could see the things I've seen
You'd learn some things about letting go
Where were you when we learnt what we know?
People like you always seem to come and go
Leading on like they know more than they know

I've seen it and I've heard it all before
Where were you when we learnt it all?

People like you always seem to come and go so quickly
Coming in like you know
Everything about anything and anyone
I've seen your type before, you're nothing different

Trying to push against the grain
Just to try and make a name for yourself
By talking down on others when we have strength in numbers
You'll never break our stride so never ever try, don't try

People like you always seem to come and go so quickly
Coming in like you know
Everything about anything and anyone
I've seen your type before, you're nothing different

When I grew up loyalty was more than a statement
Over the years it's changed and I done my best to maintain it
Fair weather, you will come and go
Over the years I've seen it, trust me, you're nothing different
