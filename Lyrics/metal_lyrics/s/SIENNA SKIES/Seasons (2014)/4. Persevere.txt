Fighting
Always fighting against the world
At least it feels that way
Now I'm going to say what I am feeling
This could make you
Feel that something's fading in you
You know and I know
That if we keep on screaming
Someone will listen

[Chorus:]
It's hard feeling this way
Like everything is coming down
On my chest and on my shoulders
This weight of the world
And this hollow feeling
This may just be the death of me
Unless I keep fighting

I'm here and I
Always will feel something like this
Be strong, hold on
If you just keep on fighting
You will survive this
I know it seems hard
But believe in yourself

Scratch off the rust
Wipe off the dust
Surviving's a must
Just keep pushing on

[Chorus:]
It's hard feeling this way
Like everything is coming down
On my chest and on my shoulders
This weight of the world
And this hollow feeling
This may just be the death of me
Unless I keep fighting

I've tried
And I've tried
And I've tried
To see a positive side
But I just can't see it
There's nothing to see but darkness
Wait, what is that?
A light at the end?
Maybe there's hope?
Maybe I see it?
I see it
