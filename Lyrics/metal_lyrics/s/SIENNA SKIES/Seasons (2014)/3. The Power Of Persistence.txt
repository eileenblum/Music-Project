Rebellion at its finest
Let's leave the past behind us
Move forward away from all this
Let's take a step towards our freedom
Future plans
To take the world on by ourselves
We don't need you or your lies
To block our eyes from the real world

[Chorus:]
Watching our worlds fall to pieces
We put them back together
Sometimes things change
They change for the better

We don't deserve this
To be mistreated for so long
How dare you take any credit
We did this on our own

[Chorus:]
Watching our worlds fall to pieces
We put them back together
Sometimes things change
They change for the better

[x2:]
We tried to say
We tried to tell you
You didn't listen
We had to show you

[x2:]
We have the power of persistence
We did this on our own

On our own
