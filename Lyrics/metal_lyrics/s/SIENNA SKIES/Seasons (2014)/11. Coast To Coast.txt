Putting pins into a map
For the places I've been
There's still so much space
So many places unseen
But I will keep my eye on the prize
Continue to strive
Cause at the end of the day
This keeps me alive

I will do this
I will do this 'till I'm dead

[Chorus:]
This is what I choose to do
And I will always do this
There's so much back and forward
When I am heading coast to coast
Back and forward
In planes or on the highways
Ups and downs
But I will always do this

The first time I hit the road
I fell in love
There's still so much
To be seen and done

I will do this
I will do this 'till I'm dead

[Chorus:]
This is what I choose to do
And I will always do this
There's so much back and forward
When I am heading coast to coast
Back and forward
In planes or on the highways
Ups and downs
But I will always do this

After all these years
All this time spent away from home
Of all the things I could've chose
What can I say
I'm just addicted to the road

To the road

[Chorus:]
This is what I choose to do
And I will always do this
There's so much back and forward
When I am heading coast to coast
Back and forward
In planes or on the highways
Ups and downs
But I will always do this
I will always do this
I will do this till I'm dead
