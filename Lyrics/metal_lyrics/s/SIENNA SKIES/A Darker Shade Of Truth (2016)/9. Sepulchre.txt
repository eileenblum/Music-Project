Bless me, for what's under my skin,
Fear me, for what it's given to me.

I fear I'll come home a broken man
The madness means nothing if you know the purpose,
What's shed from the smoke and dust?
Discomfort, chokes at my every thought.
And I'll bleed out all I can
But I'm leaving, I'm leaving a broken man.

Bless me, for what's under my skin,
Fear me, for what it's given to me
I've been cheated, I've been mislead
An identity I can't live with
The war inside of my head keeps waging on

I'll never know regret,
Regret from what I never said
Can you feel it?
The false lies you chose to spread
Run around and around in my head
Like clockwork it follows me round til my death
Never knowing a fucking thing,
I'll keep on searching but never discovering
Where I stand or choose to fit in
This world and my word will be the death of me
And as I listen to the seconds go by, I'm broken inside
In half the man I was last time.

Bless me, for what's under my skin,
Fear me, for what it's given to me
I've been cheated, I've been mislead
An identity I can't live with
The war inside of my head keeps waging on

Oh god please help me
I'm sick of loosing sleep,
So sick I cannot eat
I'm sick of breathing
So sick of counting the bodies of my dead friends in my eyelids
Oh god, oh god please help me
