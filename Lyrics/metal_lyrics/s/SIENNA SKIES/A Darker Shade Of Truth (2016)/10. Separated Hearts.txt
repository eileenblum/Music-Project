[feat. JT Woodruff]Hey, are you still awake?
I just woke up in Vancouver, but I haven't slept in days. 
Hey, are you still awake? 
It's 3AM, and I can't seem to shake the smile from my face.
I know that I've been missing home, but I don't remember where that was, 
And one thing that I promise you, is that I'll be home soon

These traveller nights don't feel so alone, when I'm waking up to the sound of the phone.
We're minutes away yet miles apart,
This is the sound of the separated heart. 

Hey there, are you still awake
I'm still miles from Ohio
And it seems like years away. 
The years have slowly ticked on by, with another overtired drive. 
But I'm still sitting here thinking.
Of being by your side. 

These traveller nights don't feel so alone, when I'm waking up to the sound of the phone.
We're minutes away yet miles apart,
This is the sound of the separated heart.

As all this time slips away, with all I've done on the road while you wait
I'm stuck feeling like I've got no place to go
I know the time zones will change, with all I've done on the road while you wait
I'm stuck feeling like I've got no place to go

These traveller nights don't feel so alone, when I'm waking up to the sound of the phone.
We're minutes away yet miles apart,
This is the sound of the separated heart.
