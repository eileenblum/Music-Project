Where we last cast off felt like a place of change,
To where the face was a face that we believed would mend,
The burning crosses and dead souls that died for amendment
Running riot in a town that bigots fail to mention. 
If the regulations
Meant you can get away with this
Then the people cant help 
Can't help but feel used and cheated

Now you stand on your pedestal begging all to hear
While your followers reduce to reproducing fear. 

Left in the heart of man. 
From the vultures and leeches and snakes in the grass. 
Left in the heart of man. 
From the vultures and leeches and snakes in the grass.

You say the heavens have sent you to fix this mess
Now you're counting the dollars and never making sense.
The world won't stay blind forever.
The broken backs and calloused hands will strangle the throat, that left the poor to beg, 
But for the last time we stand tall with heads high,
When we're left broke. 

But you still stand on your pedestal begging all to hear
While your followers reduce to reproduce fear. 

Left in the heart of man. 
From the vultures and leeches and snakes in the grass. 
Left in the heart of man. 
From the vultures and leeches and snakes in the grass.

I've got, no fucking respect for you
Your story can't convince me to join you.
With all my demons, and insecurities
Peace in my head will fucking kill me.

So here is the church. 
Here is the steeple,
Open it up and fucking rescue the people
Left in the heart of man. 
From the vultures and leeches and snakes in the grass.
