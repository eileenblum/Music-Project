I've been chasing snow for as long as I can remember.
My whole life.
And it makes me shiver. 
But as the cold wind blows it reminds me,
I like the smell of summer rain better.
Following a sober belief that where I end up will always be right for me.

If I can't come home, 
And I can't be told, 
Where does that leave me in this world alone.
There's just no.

And I'll try to sing, sing the songs that remind me that I'm someone.
But they don't quite make it. 
And when I let it all sink in, when I let it all sink in,
I'll realise where I've just run from.

If I can't come home, 
And I can't be told, 
Where does that leave me in this world alone.

And I know I'm wrong, 
For the things I've done, 
I'm sorry I left you, in this world alone.

But I can't come home, 
Cause of what I've done, 
But will you believe me, when I'm all alone.
