As I listen to, my brother speak,
Of the hell inside his head,
I wonder if it's in me to. In me too.
And too often I'm thinking the same thing,
My indecision is my own.
But he proved me wrong, these words run deeper.
The imperfections and differences of our skin, only mean one thing.
The hell in me is the same hell in him

The dead are alive, and I can't help but sit back and wonder if something is wasted,
Something is wasted
Because you and I are fighting the fight. 

We are divided
We woke from a dream where we once were united
We are divided
And we're kept awake hoping you can unite us.

I'll walk through hell and back.
Cold blood streaming through my eyes
I'm sick of walking in circles.
I'm killing myself just to prove to you I am alive

The dead are alive, and I can't help but sit back and wonder if something is wasted, something is wasted
Because you and I are fighting the same fight and it's time you know, I won't leave you here to fight alone.
