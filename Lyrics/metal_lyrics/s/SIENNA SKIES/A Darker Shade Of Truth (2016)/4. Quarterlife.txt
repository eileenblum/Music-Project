I've got a lot to say, but who knows how much time I've got left to say it.
'Cause this right here,
These open doors and ticking clocks, could end at any minute. 
Blinded by what I'm told to believe,
I'm longing for that one thing I can't see.
Standing here, watching the whole world slip away, following our heads and our pockets and leaving our heart to waste. 

I've been beaten and beaten.
And after that I will never say never again. 

Start staring through the horizon, through the tyrant of age, seeing everything in it's truest of value.
I hope you can all say.
The world is bigger than me. 
This worlds not built on fact or reason.
The truth is what you believe in.

I've been beaten and beaten.
And after that I will never say never again. 

I've got nothing to show, I'll never let go, these memories I've made for me
I've seen the world, I'm 25 and I've got nothing to show,
But the memories I've made for me. 
And I'll never let go.
