I'm loosing a generation,
And it's taken
Ninety plus years but deaths finally made a new friend. 
Welcomed with open arms like he'd always intended
And I saw the black hood
And it whispered my name.

If I hold your hand a little tighter,
Will you stay here one more day. 
If sing your name a little louder,
Will you still remember me

Memories of a hospital bed, as my family stand around, they're quoting the dead.
The cold touch of my hand on your chest,
Watch your sleeping smile
Knowing you gave nothing less than it all for your family to live and survive in a world
That death has finally said it's time
That you departed, for

Where fathers meet mothers
And brothers meet brothers

If I hold your hand a little tighter,
Will you stay here one more day. 
If sing your name a little louder,
Will you still remember me
And I'm loosing a generation, but I'll be OK.
