Roll on
To where the mountains breach. 
To where the rate of humanity starts to sink into the years you spent,
Hiding behind your own fucking pretense. 
And as the walls burn around you
Where will you hide tonight?
We're breathing comfortable tonight. 

I won't be left here to choke on your mistakes
The wind and sun will prove their worth in the end
My skin and whats left underneath will turn the page to fight again.

Point the finger of the corporate glove
To figure out who's to blame
Throwing it back and forward
But the problem, the problem stays the same.
The problem stays the same,
But by the time it seemed so obvious, it'll be too late to save your name.
I'll stand on industry, looking back
I know this place ain't right for me

I won't be left here to choke on your mistakes
The wind and sun will prove their worth in the end
My skin and whats left underneath will turn the page to fight again.

I was born to believe that a man could wear his heart on his sleeve.
And as a man I'm proud to be, my fathers son, from the way he raised me. 
And mother, you'll always be dear to me. 
And I wanna thank you for making sure that
I was born to believe that a man could wear his heart on his sleeve.
And as a man I'm proud to be, my fathers son, from the way he raised me. 
And mother, you'll always be dear to me. 
Please don't blame me for causing this tragedy.

I won't be left here to choke on your mistakes
The wind and sun will prove their worth in the end
My skin and whats left underneath will turn the page to fight again.

So roll on to where the mountain meets man, to show you the worst of his master plan.
