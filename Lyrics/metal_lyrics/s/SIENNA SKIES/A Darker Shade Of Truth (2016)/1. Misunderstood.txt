So tell me how
How many people, have tried to get the better of you?
Told you you'll never amount to one single thing?
Drowned you with a fist full of words that you could never understand?
Told you the mask you wear, just isn't welcome?

So sick of being told we're just no fucking good.
So sick of proving that we're just no fucking good.
So sick of being told we're just no fucking good.
Proving the point that you never understood.

And I was told maybe, I'll start a fire,
Watch it burning down all of the hatred, standing among us.
Maybe I'll start a fire,
Watch it burning down all of the hatred,
Leave no wall standing.

You choose to follow that line,
The path you're choosing's fucking blowing my mind.
Saying it's yours like it was never stolen.
Cheats and lies, blaming faith, contorted.

Not a day goes by, where I haven't thought of jumping from the sea to sky.
But we are all sick of flying alone and blind.

And I was told maybe, I'll start a fire,
Watch it burning down all of the hatred, standing among us.
Maybe I'll start a fire,
Watch it burning down all of the hatred,
Leave no wall standing.

This place is burning in my lungs,
The cold takes over and makes me numb
(Not a day goes by, where I haven't thought of jumping from the sea to sky.
But we're all so sick of flying alone and blind)
