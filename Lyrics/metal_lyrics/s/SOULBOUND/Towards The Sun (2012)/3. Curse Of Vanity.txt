You think of yourself that the moon
The sun, the stars all rise and set on you
In fact your favourite topic of conversation is you
All I see is emptiness in your inside
You are the only one who matters for you
I hate deep
Down inside
I hate you
Deep down inside
My spirit you cannot break
Realize that you will fail
Iâm taking back control
Itâs the curse of vanity
That you have changed in many ways
Only truth will set you free
Your soul is petrified of yourself
Disrespect you have given to To
Everyone who was standing next to you
All what you will earn is non-observance
No one really matters for you
The curse of vanity
