Moonlight
Awakes the beast in me
It casts
A damning light on me
Itâs time
To reveal the truth
And soon
It quietly dwells in me:
You always knew that I would be unsure
That is what I am
Here comes the cruel break of dawn again
So face the truth
Itâs another lie â You canât tell me that
Itâs another lie, so let it all out
Weâre another lie â You canât tell me that
Weâre another lie, let it all out
Towards the sun
I try to never be afraid
Tried to warn you against myself
Have you ever felt betrayed
You trust me and now youâre aiming for the stars
Too late
Too late to compromise
This time
The day of reckoning
Will rise
Annihilate your fate
Youâve got
Youâve got to change the side
