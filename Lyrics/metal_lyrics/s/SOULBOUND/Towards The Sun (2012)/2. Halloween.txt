You only see my mask
Thatâs not what I find in the mirror
Disguise is a cushy task
Itâs the only time I see clearer
Disconnected from my reality
Itâs the time for sensuality
Now face it
Be honest
Show whatâs behind the mirror
My real faces
So let it out
I have no doubt
That is what I am
What I feel could just be on Halloween
Iâm just feeling free
Only on Halloween
Freaking out loud
Act myself out
Shouting out loud
I take myself out
Itâs my time in the year
An easy way to escape from low times
Iâll get freedom from my fear
The only day I can act in my prime
Disconnected from my normal life
Itâs time for my intestine strife
