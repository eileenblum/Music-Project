Seems like it was yesterday
When you just walked away
You had no time to loose
And made your own fucking choice
Back off of me and get away
Save your breath, I will not hear
Letâs compare scars, yours and mine
What the fuck do you want from me?
Try to kill whatâs on my mind
What the hell did bring me down
The way alone I could not find
What the hell did bring me down
Itâs your way to be upright
That is just what brought me down
But I will save myself tonight
Let me take you right to
To the point where you will see
Thereâs nothing left to give
Everything has changed in me
You denied
A second chance and you just left
You left me in broken pieces
What the fuck do you want from me
