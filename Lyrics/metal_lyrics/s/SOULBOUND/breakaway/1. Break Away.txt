Standing the rules
Work like a machine
I know that you
Are tired and want to sleep
So take my hand
leave everything behind
And let the journey begin now

We are here, breaking away
Let us infect the world today
A new time without delay

Fighting all times
To power up the wall
We know that you
Feel drained by daily grind
Raise your head (and) scent
the smell of liberty
So let us start this journey now

We are here, breaking away
Let us infect the world today
A new time without delay
Bind your souls for this decay

Break away

We are here, breaking away
Let us infect the world today
A new time without delay
Bind your souls for this decay
