I invite you all to the pigslaughtering feast
all possible specialities are being served
enjoy sausages
the intestines come from our landlord
beautiful rashes of bacon
is from body of the fat neighbour

Let's prepare an excellent soup
the eyes and brain is
of children who have played on the yard

Taste the liver fried on onion
that female didn't booze at all
the excellent ham is made of ass
of our skillful mailman

I together with my dad
we preces everything
we flavour and prepare
only join us and bring something for a drink

We have taste and choosy apetite
we won't content ourselves with anything

We'll laugh and booze
we'll bury the bones in forest
or we'll throw them away
and the dogs'll feed on them
