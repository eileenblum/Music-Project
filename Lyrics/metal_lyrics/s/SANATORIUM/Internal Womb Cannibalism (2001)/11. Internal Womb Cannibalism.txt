Profligate life and
its consequences
multiple fecundation
of different sperms
intrauterine disorder
with unforeseeable course
multiple fecundation creation
of several fetuses

Mutual devourment
among embryos
inhalation of somebody
else's parts
genetic explosion
perinatal cannibalism

Within the uterus
cobweb made
of umblical cords
suffocated embryos
devoured by siblings
