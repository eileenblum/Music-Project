Stalking the night
leaving no stone unturned
my desire for meat
Makes my blood boil
I need to run

Eating the corpse
feeling remorse but why do I kill
in my sleep

Seeking to be stopped in my own weird way
leaving clues to lead you to me
getting more twisted with every murder
getting excited by the smell of the chase

Total chaos brings absolute pleasure
death gets me high
feeling intoxicated
by the stench of the dead

[lyric by Matt Bishop (Lividity)]
