Growing erection caressing her pale and shaking patterns of skin
Held down to the ground, vaginal tunnel wide open, blood pumping
Gagged by filthy and reeking hands, vomitous, disgorging between
Fingers of her murderer, fist pulverising jaw, disfigured and crying
Removed from the scene of crime, blood and remants removed by the rain
Buried in an unmarked grave, headless with her head between her tits

"Kill me, please, just kill me"

Desecrated...
Decapitated...

In the next room, blood covered the walls and ceiling
Three female bodies with hooks impaling their throats
Hanging from rusty chains, their bodies showed signs of bitemarks
And inside the wounds, old semen and maggots festering

Down in the cellar, bodies buried inside the walls
Stench was hideous, bloody handprints on the cement walls
Here some of the sickest things, took place, his intercourses
Rotting carcass, chopped up bodies, meathook penetrating flesh...

Exhuming bowels...
Decaying torsos...
The murderer...
Nowhere to be found
