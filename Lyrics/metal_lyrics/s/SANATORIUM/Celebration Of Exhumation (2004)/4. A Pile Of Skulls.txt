Take the heads from the cemetery, the headless bodies are buried
No use for the spine or meat, cut off the hands and feet...
The axe hacks through the head, total
desecration of the dead
Corpses decapitated in their sleep, taken
from it's cold and safe keep

Put them in a pile...
Deep down in my home...
A pile of skulls...

Skinning the head from the skin, slicing the flesh really thin
Cleaning blood from the skull, the water is red of blood
I want perfection in my collection, the teeth must shine
Empty skull from vital organs, another piece for my pile...

Deep and dark holes that was once filled with joy...
Pointing out the eyes, give them away as a toy...
Stench is hideous from the pile of skulls that is so old...
Collected by a man that is so cold...
