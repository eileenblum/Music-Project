Inside the womb of a dead woman, the fetus is growing and breeding
Raped by the undead, she took the maggotfilled seed
Arms and legs are torn off, the eyes was ripped and carved
Rotting meat giving the fetus decay, fetus is swimming in pus and cum...

Maggots, cockroaches, worms and vermin...
They feast on the rotting remains of the whore...
Maggots, cockroaches, worms and vermin...
The rectum is sticky from diarrhea...

Crawling out of the corpse, open the eyes to the world
Hideous screams from the fetus, echoing through the wastelands

Lusting for the meat, to drink blood that is so sweet...
Eating a rotting carcass, raping his dead mother rotting ass...
He loves her so dearly, he wants her to stay with him
So he devours the corpse...

He follows the way of his fathers
He rapes new women to create life
Ripping of their heads and limbs
Leaving the corpses for the fetus to eat...
