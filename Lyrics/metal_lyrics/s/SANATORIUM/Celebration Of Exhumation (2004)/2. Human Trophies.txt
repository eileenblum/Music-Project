Rope around his throat and his limbs
Sharpen the tools that will seal his fate
Bloodsoaked serenades are ready to be celebrated
Death shall bring one more to his collection...

Convulsion through every vein of his body, the knife slips deeper within
Mouth agape, guttural noise, the beginning of brutal genocide, hunted through the woods
Eating dirt, head torn off, blood gushing, covering the soil...
Eating dirt, head torn off, blood gushing, covering the soil...

Human Trophies

Strip the skin, rinse the bone, polish the surface...
Gouge the eyes, ripe the spine, collecting trophies...
One more on the shelf, next to a hundred of heads...
