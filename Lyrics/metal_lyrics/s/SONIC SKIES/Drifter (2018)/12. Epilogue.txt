This is an endless conflict
And we're all involved, you and I
Old mistakes in future days
We celebrate our fall

Where hate surrounds us
The wolves are at our door
Where death surrounds us
The wolves are at our door

The wolves are at our door
Society will prove its worth
When hope falls apart

You bring the fire
We carry the gasoline

We trade bullets for our souls
Trade poverty for oil
Old mistakes in future days
We celebrate our fall

With open wounds and broken bones
No button for reset
I said it once and I say it again
This place is dead

So it begins
Under a darkened sky the fields of hope are set on fire
We are the witness of this worlds final days
We are the witness when all is washed away
