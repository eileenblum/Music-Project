I've heard this shit a thousand times before
Spare your words, 'cause I get bored!
I'm so sick of this entertainment
These false ambitions that you are standing for
Your kind infection
Of weaker minds
The one eyed will be king
Among the blind

Pray for forgiveness
Pray for release
Pray for forgiveness
This heart can not be tamed
Pray for forgiveness
Pray for relief
Pray for forgiveness
A heart you can not break

One second to change everything
One bullet to change everything

Pray for forgiveness
Pray for relief
Pray for forgiveness
