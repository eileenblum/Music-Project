Pathetic pictures
Made to confuse and to control
Glorious anthems
By the voices of corruption

They try to fill our hearts
With the flavour of despair
Mass production
Mass consumption
Sowing doubts to reap our fear

We sold our self-determination
Abandoned every piece of mind
Every piece of mind
And nothing will be left to save
As time goes by

As time goes by

Another gear in this machine
Because to decide
Never was an option
We are the gears in this machine
They never tried
To keep our souls alive

They try to fill our hearts
With the flavour of despair
Mass production
Mass consumption
Sowing doubts to reap our fear

We gave our self-determination
'Til all falls down

Another gear in this machine
Because to decide
Never was an option
We are the gears in this machine
They never tried
To keep our souls alive
