I am dreamer
But I'm a liar
In the blink of an eye
The world is set on fire
I am of strong faith
I'm a seducer
No strings attached
No slave to a master

In the distance someone calls me
In the distance I still hear these words

Ikarus
Beware of the sun!
Escape from damage because the damage is already done
Ikarus
This is far to high
This is far to high
Ikarus
With melting wings towards the sun
This is a metaphor of what we have become

I feel the warm embrace
I feel the light attracting me
I feel my burning skin
I feel my burning skin

I am pathetic
But I'm an optimist
Remove the cowards
Weakness does not exist
I am a rebel
Against my nature
Augmenting myself
Straight into future

Ikarus
Beware of the sun!
Escape from damage because the damage is already done
Ikarus. This is far to high.
This is far to high
Ikarus
With melting wings towards the sun
This is a metaphor of what we have become
