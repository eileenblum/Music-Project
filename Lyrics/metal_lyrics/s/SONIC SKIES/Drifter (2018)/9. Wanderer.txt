If god is on our side, then who is with them?
Divinity of purpose, to fight the demons within
Prayers of the dumb, the deaf to lead the blind
We slip through space and time, already lost our grip.

Wanderer
If only we could see the world through your eyes
Wanderer
If only we could see the world through your eyes

Abandoned life
Abandoned hope
Abandoned hearts
Slowly die

Feed the inner demons to keep the doubts alive
Infected hearts will reclaim faith to keep their hopes alive

If god is on our side, then who is with them?
