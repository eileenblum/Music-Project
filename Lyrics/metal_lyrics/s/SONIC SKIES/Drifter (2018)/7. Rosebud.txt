Piece by piece I deconstruct my soul
Erase my eyes
To rebuild my live and rise up from the ashes

After black comes grey and everything turns back to black
I've been through this a thousand times so I take what I get

Burn it down
Clean it up
Then repeat the process
Crush it down
Keep the shards
To build a better self

Piece by piece I deconstruct my soul
Rebuild my live and rise up from the ashes

I smash my face against the wall
The storm, the flood, the calm
It takes some time to resurrect
To make me feel alive
Through heaven
And purgatory
It takes some time to resurrect
Again I feel alive

Conformity
The great collective everyone as one
It was never build for me

Burn it down
Clean it up
Then repeat the process
Crush it down
Keep the shards
And rise up from the ashes

I smash my face against the wall
The storm, the flood, the calm
It takes some time to resurrect
To make me feel alive
Through heaven
And purgatory
It takes some time to resurrect
Again I feel alive
