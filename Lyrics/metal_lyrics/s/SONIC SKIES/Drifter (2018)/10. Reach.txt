Everyone is connected 24/7
Living life through a phone line
The digital heaven
Became a social hell
Zeroes an ones don't fit us well

Sinking deeper
Into the rabbit hole
We are all connected
Caught in the undertow
Sinking deeper
Trough the undertow

Fibers and wires
Good friends are so hard to find
We boost our reach
Only to loose ourselves
We loose ourselves

Binary impulses
Watch the lives behind glass
Pretenders
Lies through a looking glass

It's time to disconnect
Reclaim your live

Fibers and wires
Good friends are so hard to find
We boost our reach
Only to loose ourselves
We loose ourselves
Digital demons
We worship the addiction
