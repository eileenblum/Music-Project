Do you remember
The chances we're given?
We chose who we are
Every minute is driven by all our decisions
Seconds run fast
So we made every moment count

Did we made every moment count?

One night one night
One night can change it all
It's cold in September
One night one night
And darkness has taken its toll
But still I remember you

No steps back
Time just runs in one direction

No steps back
Clocks ticking in one direction

Time runs fast
So we have to live faster

Daydreamer
What do you see when your eyes are closed
Your thoughts exposed
Nothing can bring back these moments again
Seconds run fast
Now I make every moment count

One night one night
One night can change it all
It's cold in September
One night one night
And darkness has taken its toll
Still I remember

One night one night
One night can change it all
It's dark in September
One night one night
And darkness has taken its toll
Still I remember you
