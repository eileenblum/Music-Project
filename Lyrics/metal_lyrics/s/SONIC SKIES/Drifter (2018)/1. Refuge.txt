Our feet are burning
But still a lot of miles to go
So many oceans crossed
Our lungs collapsed but we still move
The reaper watching our souls
Deciding who to choose

Dead heart
There is no promised land
Dead heart
Our dreams and hopes are built on sand
There is no promised land
Our dreams and hopes are built on sand
The tyrants we run from they live in ourselves

The wolves are hunting us
Their hearts are double-crossed
The wolves are hunting us
Their hearts are double-crossed

Tracing our footsteps
Erasing them from the soil

We're reaping what you sow

Black heart
There is no promised land
Black heart
Our dreams and hopes are built on sand
There is no promised land
Our dreams and hopes are built on sand
The tyrants we run from they live in ourselves

No one will run from home
If there would be any hope left
One world one refuge
Our hearts are double-crossed

The wolves are hunting us
Their hearts are double-crossed
The wolves are hunting us
Their hearts are double-crossed
