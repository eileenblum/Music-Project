When we were kids
We had the world at our feet
With wooden swords
And without fear
The knights of kingdom gone
Nothing was safe
Nothing secure
It was just us against them all
Just us against the world

Burning

This burning fire
Has kept us alive
Through all the dark times
It helped us survive

Our past has brought us here
Once in a life time
We have it in our hearts
And no one tears it apart
Our past has brought us here
Unwritten guidelines
We keep it in our hearts
And nothing tears it apart

We were just kids
We made a lot of mistakes
But we've never seen the darkness
The brave and the bold
Nothing was safe
Nothing secure
It was just us against them all
Against them all
