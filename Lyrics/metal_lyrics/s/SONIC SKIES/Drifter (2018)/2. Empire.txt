We are slaves
To a broken system
To build up sorrows our hearts are drowned in fear
Praise the consumption
Receive redemption by selling souls and paralyzing minds
Spread the corruption
Receive redemption by selling souls and paralyzing minds
Mesmerizing

You are the virus
We are the antidote
Man-made eradication
We are the antidote
Craving for salvation

Clutch at your master
Self-absorbed but loyal to the end
Clutch at your master
Self-absorbed but loyal to the end
Loyal to the end

In this golden cage made of bones
And made of dreams
And long forgotten hopes
We all are slaves
To a broken system
An empire to be only skin and bones
Skin an bones

You are the virus
We are the antidote
Man-made eradication
We are the antidote
Craving for salvation

No walls
No borders
Maybe we stumble but we won't fall
No rules
No orders
No slaves
And no fucking masters
