Lost in the void
Perished and cold
Chasing the origins
By relic codes

Give me a shotgun
And the smell of doom
The taste of iron
I will travel soon

The wings are broken
Lifeless... grey...
Birth of destruction
Chaos leading the way

Escaping towards the rain
Through the passage of Oldarhiah!
