Forming the shadows into lions
To wake up a sleeping machine
Jaws of death are eating their way
Into the soul of silence

Falling stars in the universe
Cutting through heavy skies
Eyes wathing a yellow half moon
As they swallow the silver blades

The burning flame of triumph
Is dying deep within the well
A limp scavenger is feeding
In the ashes of what is left

Vast land of forgtten memories
Desert black nothingness
A colourless rainbow marks the loss
The loss to a novel dawn
