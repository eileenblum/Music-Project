Scattered colour
White turns red
Creator of life
Bringer of death

Energy drain
Oblivion devours
Consume and decay
Increase and entropy

No one to bury the last
No one to remember

Vaporize pain
Burns to nothing
Unites with fire
All becomes one

Release of wrath
Anger till the end
Infernal core
A newborn rage

Incineration in the orion arm
Burning of the monoliths

History erased
Silenced forever
Perished in flames
Consumed by time

Red turned white
Infinite peace
Barren landscape
Lifeless fields
