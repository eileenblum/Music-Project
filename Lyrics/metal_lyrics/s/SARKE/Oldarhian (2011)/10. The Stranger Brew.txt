No feeling for life
Blur the days
Reckless behaviour
In the void, infected veins

No stranger to the brew
Complete the horizon
The sun has no power
Through ÑÐ½e fog of flamboyant paths

Your ideas, out of focus
Shivering slug upon the "throne"
Inhale the stench of the mighty brew
And taste the freedom of death

Arriving on time
The night of sin
Imitation of life
Freaks of the full moon
