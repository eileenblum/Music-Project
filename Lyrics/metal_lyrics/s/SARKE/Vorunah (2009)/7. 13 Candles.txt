In the cornerA brown ChesterfieldOn the floorA carpet of human hair Four statues in bronzeHand craftedFrom ancient timesHolding a wooden table Thirteen carved holesIn a wolf's spineA candelabrumTo hold the candles 13 candles are burningIn the memoryOf the two soulsThat was never there
