Ripping, drippingDrooling on my bootsYou're on me like a uniformLike a snake entwines its prey Even though I hate youYou're on me like an old man's dog Unleash the anger in meThen Vorunah will seeHow cruel I can be My skin is crawling in filthI will never be cleanFrom your aching stenchCause you are me AbsorbingMy lifeLike a kissFrom Dracul
