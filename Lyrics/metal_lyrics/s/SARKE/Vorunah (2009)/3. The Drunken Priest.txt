Laid out before himA book of old psalmsHis eyes are blindedBy the darkest shades His mouth is dry like sandThe voice is rustySpeaks about death and sorrowAnd how to save your soul The drunken priestOn his alter throneDrowning in wineAnd endless funerals Aroma of wine and vomitInfects the airWearing the hammerheadSaved by the iron bell
