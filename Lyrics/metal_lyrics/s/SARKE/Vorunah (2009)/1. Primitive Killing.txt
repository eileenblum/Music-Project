The moon is leading my pathIn my hand a knife of boneIn the other a ropeFor strangulation, to end it Prey in sightBlood will be shed this night A moment unpreparedA spear through the neckFalling to the freezing groundShivering, cold, dead Instinct of the livingPrimal huntingDeath is lifePrimitive killing
