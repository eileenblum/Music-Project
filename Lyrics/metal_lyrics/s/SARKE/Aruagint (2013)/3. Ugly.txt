Flee from the beastly
And never look back
Try to find shelter
And hide in the cracks

Cause I'm ugly
Ugly as Hell

The face of disaster
A surface of grief
The horrid is coming
So get on your knees

The untamed is howling
They all are afraid
Born in a jug
Of whiskey and ale
