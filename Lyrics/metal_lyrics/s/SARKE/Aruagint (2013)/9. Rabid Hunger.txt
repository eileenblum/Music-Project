Running madly
To taste the bloodshed
Squeezing the blade
With foaming hatred

Eating mortal scraps
From the carcass landfill
Like a human vulture
Growing into a mammoth

Disturbed
The chains are broken
Disturbed
Out in rabid hunger

Flee from confusion
To feed Frankenstein
Scent of blood and liberation
Procreate the barbarian in me
