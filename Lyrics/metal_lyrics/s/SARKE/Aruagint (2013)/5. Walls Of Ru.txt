Under the walls of Ru
Cold reign turns to rust
Exude the bronze mist
Carving the voodoo symbols

Ashes laying thick and black
As the side of a battleship
Two canon deck high
Like a monster grave

Sinking slowly
In the pool of death
Creating sounds of fear
On the path to red

Grabbing the roots of old
From once a fierce rival
Now to be torn down
And brought back to grey
