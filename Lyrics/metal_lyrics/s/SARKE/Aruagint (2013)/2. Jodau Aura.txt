Down on my knees
With my fingers crossed
The face is numb from coldness
My head is lost

Walk in silence
With ghost behavior
Walk in trauma
Inhaling jodau aura

Blinded by the chaos
My eyes are shut
Crawling round in circles
Vision is crushed

Dragging shattered remains
Into a godlike realm
Throwing spirits of light
Upon the advanced genesis
