Deathlike forest
Decomposing trees
A growing footpath
Suffocating haze
To the aphotic tarn
Fronting the demise

Shadows falling hard
Intruding black water
Drowning the deceit
In cold skeleton sand

Consuming the field of flames
Riding a dead horse

Wooden portal
Pillars rising deadly
Visible icons
Swallowed by the wind
The insect ground
Murdering the escape
