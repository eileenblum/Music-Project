Tracking down the gray haired
To reveal the script
Solve the eye labyrinth
From primeval fragments

Rowing the wooden boat
Pass the lake, to the island
Walking on rotten leafs
Jaunt of the obsession

Slowly opening the half broken door
To find the carrion
Drag it up to the grave
By the moss grown ruins

Find the pig head
Rise it up on a stake
Bury the dead
The first fall moonrise
