A swarm of mosquitoes
Blocking the sight
Iron built circles
Constructing a sonic light

Waking the sleeping demons
Wolfish madmen
Hunting for my guts
To destroy my existence

Strange pungent odyssey

Hiding on a passing train
Escaping the past
Black snow covers the landscape
At the end of the ride

Hordes of demons are coming
In a river of remains
Jaws from ancient bones
Chewing their way through
