Rising, from torment I'm reborn
Outrage, spewing flames of rot
Anger - an old obsessive itch
Redemption - a life force fed on scorn

Ruins, erase the feeble womb
Retaliate, dogmas will succumb
Reaping, feeding on the guilt
Death throes, unholy venomous tongue

Unorthodox dimension
Philosophy that reeks
Display my hate agenda
Provoke humanity

Cryptids, crossbreed man and goat
Torment, feel the cloven hoof
Release - of demons I possess
Torture, atonement growing sour

Sickness, avant-garde decay
Vigilante - a vengeful raging attack
Versus, ride the chagrin drift
Dominance, the world is at my feet
