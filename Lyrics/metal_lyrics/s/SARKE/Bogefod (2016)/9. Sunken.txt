A final grave
The watery marsh
The peaty soil
That hides the harsh

Drowned is the creature
The roaring has ceased
Sunken the frightful
Unspeakable beast

A final grave
That keeps him still
Done is his final
Horrid kill

Drowned the tormentor
Deep in the bog
Forever the marshland
Will cover his corpse

Ashes to ashes to mud
