Those things you said when you were running, running through my head... running
through my head. How long have I been like this, so blind, so far from
everything. Iâve come to realize, my life isnât really about my sins in the
past, thatâs not my lifeâs purpose.... Iâve been taking a look on all of the
past years, and it doesnât make any sense. What have you gotten from this? Take
a look at yourself in the mirror, youâll be surprised what you find about
yourself. Another day gone by, how did we ever get this far? Letâs go.... Fix
all your problems, only me to blame. So perfect, never let it go... never let
it go.... Take a look at yourself in the mirror, youâll be surprised what you
find about yourself. Another day gone by, how did we ever get this far? Those
things you said when you were running... running through my head... Youâre
running through my head. Youâre running through my head.
