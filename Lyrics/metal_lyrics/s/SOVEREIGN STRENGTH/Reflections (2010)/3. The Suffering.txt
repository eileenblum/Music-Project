I have lost everything, nothing left to lose, Iâm all alone. God, please save
us now! Fire of God fell from the sky and burned up everything. Iâm the only
one who has escaped to tell you this... to tell you this. And when you feel you
canât go on, keep your hands to the skies... to the skies.... The Lord gave,
and has taken away. May the name of the Lord be praised.
