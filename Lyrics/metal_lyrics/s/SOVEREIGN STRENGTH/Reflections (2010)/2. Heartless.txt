Heartless, you are so heartless to me, Iâll bury you. Heartless, you are so
heartless to me, Iâll bury you.... Lead astray in a whirlwind of lies, only to
believe but one truth, I will not fall again. Uncover the veil from my eyes,
let the dead bury the dead. Let the dead bury the dead.... Heartless, you are
so heartless to me, Iâll bury you.... I know youâre better than this, but your
arrogance is endless. There ainât no stoppinâ me, just say youâre through. You
left me for dead... dead... dead.
