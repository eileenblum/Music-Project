As we watch the weight of this world, itâs coming crumbling down on its way to
crush you. I pray to God that you make it, for you will suffer. Your endless
cycle, your empty words, your selfishness will fall on you. Your endless cycle,
your empty words, your selfishness will fall on you... will fall on you.... All
the words youâve been saying, all the pain you have caused, you will never see
those lives that you have stained... Your words are poison! Your words are
poison! Your words are poison! Your words are poison!.... I see right through
you, you never struggled, why would you have to? You only fight for your gain,
the blame is yours so... Live In Shame.
