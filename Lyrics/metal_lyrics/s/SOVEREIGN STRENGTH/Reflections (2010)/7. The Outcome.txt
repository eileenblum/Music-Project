I will never be another number. We will stand, against the grain. There is
nothing you can do or say that will ever make me change my ways. Forget about
yesterday and we will live the outcome.... we will live the outcome. You choose
to live blindly, I see through it all. You walk in the shadows, Iâm here in the
light... here in the light.... God hear my cry!... God hear my cry!... You
listen close, but your eyes are closed. Always looking for any way to choke the
faith that I hold so close to my heart. You canât take from me what you have
lost.
