What have we done to deserve this? What would you do when they turn on you?...
Nothing can heal your wounds, your injury is fatal. We rise our hands at your
fall. And Iâll keep screaming until this world hears my plea, I wonât fall on
deaf ears. War on this world! This world is ours! This world is mine! Weâre
taking over! Iâm taking over! And you canât stop us! You canât stop me!.... I
will destroy the images and cast out idols that are in your temples of your
god. Your endless cruelty has won gain on you... on you...on you... on you...on
you....
