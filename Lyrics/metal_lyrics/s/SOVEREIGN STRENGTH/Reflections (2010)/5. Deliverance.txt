We build these walls up, and pray for a Savior. When we will realize that weâre
blocking out our senses. We build these walls up, and pray for a Savior. When
we will realize that weâre blocking out our senses. Now weâre stuck, nowhere to
go. How can we overcome this, when we are the problem? We will never rise
above.... How can we overcome this, when we are the problem? I will defy the
ways of this world. No longer will I be held back by your lies. I will defy the
ways of this world. No longer will I be held back by your lies.... We will live
for whatâs in our hearts. We will never be afraid... never.... And the walls of
religion will come crashing down. This is the sound of the walls coming
down.... Your judgment only keeps you further, the life you lead is the wall of
deception.
