All massive tumors, all around the beer bong and tap, feeding ignorance that
has been passed, from generation to generation, that this is living well.
Youâre all the living dead, consume and consume. Soon youâll eat your own
limbs. You tried the true American way to drink out your senses. We wonder
where love went, the same place your drink did. You tried the true American way
to drink out your senses. We wonder where the love went, the same place your
drink did.The pisser, you numbed yourself. I listen to my heart, you canât even
think. I can feel everything, I feel everything. My strength, my heart, my
hope, my life. You tried the true American way to drink out your senses. We
wonder where love went, the same place your drink did. You tried the true
American way to drink out your senses. We wonder where the love went, the same
place your drink did. My strength, my heart, my hope, my life.... Liberated!
