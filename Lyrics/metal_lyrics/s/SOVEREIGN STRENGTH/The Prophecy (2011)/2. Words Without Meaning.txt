When will the words we say
Have the strength and power
As the meaning it holds
Are our words just a cycle
Thats pleasing to our ears

Can we find a new way
To proclaim our love
Can we find a new song
Or are these words not enough

I want my words to live
To captivate my hearts voice
I will not be a vacant sound

I wont speak of death any longer
These serpants cant betray me

The only barrier is me

Beyond the invisible the silence must be heard
