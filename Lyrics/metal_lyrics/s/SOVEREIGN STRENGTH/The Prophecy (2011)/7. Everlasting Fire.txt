Everlasting fire
Never ending love
Consume my heart
Consume my soul

Everlasting fire
Burn down all my sins

You heard my cry for mercy. The cords of death entangled me,
The anguish of the grave came over me
I was overcome by distress but you always saw me through
Never forsaken, never again lost

What did you see in me?
You Throw out the years I spit on your name

You always gave me hope
I will praise your name til I turn into ashes
