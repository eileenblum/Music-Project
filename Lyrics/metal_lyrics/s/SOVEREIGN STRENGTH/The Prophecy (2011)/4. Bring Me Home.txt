Bring me me home
Where I can see your face for so long ive been lost and serching

Where I can hear your voice for so long I have been bound and broken

Where I can feel your grace With open arms send your love down

I will never be the same
For all your grace has given to me
I will never be the same
The end of suffering

I will never walk away
Your presence has me still
I could never walk away
Your love keeps pulling me back

This is our breath
Our everlasting peace

This love is never ending
It gave its all to Rescue me
