Keep your head up high, raise your hands to the sky, I wont be pushed aside and watch the world pass me by

There is more to life then this, take your life back repent your sins. There is more to life the. This take your life back

Give me the strength to move on, every single day, arm my body and mind
Give me the will to move on every single day, arm my body and mind

Take your life back and live

There is more to life then this take your life back repent your sins, there is more to life then this take your life back

Repent

Oh God, king of kings
Save me from this man I have came to be

There is more to life then this take your life back repent your sins, there is more to life then this take your life back and live
