The time is now
Don't sit around and wait for revival

I can not sit around and wait for someone else, to do what God has called me to do myself

You can turn off the sun
But I'm still gonna shine
Until there's nothing left

I can not sit around and wait for someone else to do what God has called me to do myself

You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine until there is nothing left

When the world denies and I'm cast aside, I still see your beauty
When I stand alone my heart will know you still see my beauty
