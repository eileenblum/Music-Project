No blood shed, This was a war we were made for, and I'm not going to sit this one out. Send me, to the ones who will persecute me.
No blood shed before you stand, as if it ment nothing at all. I am the only one whose breathing.
I wanna go where nobodies been. Across the land and the deepest darkest sin. Rules out around the world who the hell are you?
I wanna live my life through love. Scream until my lungs collapse, do everything I can, this is who I am.
I will live as a monster, dont think your better then me, I am running on short
No blood shed before you stand, as if it ment nothing at all. I am the only one whose living.
This was a war we were made for and I'm not going to sit this one out, send me, send me.
Your not the answer, there's no getting better. Make me suffer
