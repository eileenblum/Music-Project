Your love grows cold of your wickedness
that plagues your heart, the weak will fall

You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see that you are not alarmed. Dont be afraid

Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

The weak will turn away from faith
they will betray there own.

the sun will be filled with darkness
the stars will fall from the sky,

the heavenly bodies will turn away
