I look in the mirror and see for I am not what I have wanted to become. I pick myself up and wipe my hands clean. There is nothing you can't be.
I encourage you to drop everything and give your life to something if not to anything.
Get on your feet, pick yourself up, wipe the dust off, and be reborn.
Destroy all you sins and all your lies. To kill what's killing you
