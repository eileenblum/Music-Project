Inch by inch
I sell my self short
To the being
I've always despised

Looking to everyone &amp; everything
To fill this hole in my life
We were ment to live
Ment to live for glory
To my savior
The one who built me up
But I always know
How to tear myself down

Full of regret
Full of guilt
I will never break this cycle
I push myself to a new low

Will I ever be more
Then what I claim to be
I want to be more then a label
More then an image for the world to see
