For so long we have been cast down
In This world that has always had the upper hand
They want to lead you to death
To disolve your innocence
Oppressor, you wont get the best of me

Destroy the sin that cripples you
Be built on faith &amp; not by site
Destroy the sin that cripples you
We will not be pushed aside

Where, O death, is your victory?
Not in me
Will this death live in me?
Never again

We will no longer suffer
By your grace im delivered
We will no longer suffer
Never

He gives us victory
When we were ment for loss
Let nothing move us
your labor not be in vain.

Hope for the hopeless
Strength for the weak
