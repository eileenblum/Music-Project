Wicked complications as the prophecy arrives,
Sudden loss of consciousness remains,
Twisted long predictions of the final confrontation,
Twitching far beneath the horror bleeding from the heavens!

Premature assemblage of insidious reprise,
Thunder rolls like bones in the night,
Losing all semblance of a natural demise,
The acrid air around us reeks like certain death!

Gaze towards the sky - Feel the black, let it saturate you!
Release your grasp - Feel your faith slip through your fingers!

We liberate you - We defy as we set you free!
We emancipate you - Emerging from the shadows, we commit our final blasphemy!

Deafened by the silence for in here the words run thin,
Balancing along the bloody line,
Invasion and the conquering of the human heart,
Deconstruction of the faith buried deep inside!

Cultivate the hatred and reap the seeds of lies,
We wander blindly down with treachery,
Slaughtering the clergy nothing asked but something gained,
Demonic violation the masses watch with apathy!

This gashtly throng - The scions of a conquering race!
Impious eminence - Begotten from an ancient line!

De Opresso Liber - Resemblance of unholier times!
De Opresso Liber - Twisting Black Penetration Simplifies!

Washed in clarity, the blinders removed as the smoke drifts away,
Grasping at what remains of sanity!
Quickly shed the contradiction,
Curse the infraction at once realign,
Descend down the passage, out into the clear moonlight!

Reject the lies - Release and simplify!
Reclaim the night - Venture forth and embrace your amnesty!

We liberate you - Embrace your amnesty!
