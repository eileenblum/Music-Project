Breathing deeply the stench of desperation,
Crestfallen reprobate imprisoned in self deception,
The breadth of ignorance spanning abysmal canyons,
Aeons of treachery, all traces of faith abandoned!

Imprisoned alive in this wretched hive,
Infected inside impetuous putrefaction,
Divine excision igniting derision,
With deadly precision hunting the ancient lie!

The dappled shadows - The waiting gallows,
The inverted hallows - Open and festering,
Facing the dead with courage insteadm
Infection has spread into the embodiment of life!

In this place they gather the lies from which they'll never revive,
The hopes that they will survive assassination!

Descending wholly into the void - Enflaming passions destroyed!
All hopes of mercy deployed into extinction!

Imprisoned alive in this wretched hive,
Infected inside impetuous putrefaction,
Divine excision igniting derision,
With deadly precision hunting the ancient lie!

Blackness precludes dreams of escape - Encountered legions of hate,
Inside eternally wait for redemption!

Blind, invalidation, branded, fallen,
Twisted contradiction, blind invalidation of life!

Ageless strangers infect with fallacy,
Treachery self evident definite policy,
Gaping infliction open and festering,
Devious putrefaction poisoning this richly salted lie!
