The cold disconnection remains,
Far beneath what the secret retains,
Shrouded by darkness in the abyss,
Suffocated by ignorant bliss!

Unclean, unseen, nefarious and obscene,
Blackened and from the inside out,
Spawning hatred killing hope, swinging from the gallow's rope,
Thirty pieces silver lying at your feet!

Beware the dark con of man,
Speaking words that run thin,
Puncture wounds of the forked tongue,
Weeping putrid viscous, blacker than sin!

Chaos reigned, now restored anarachy forevermore,
Light dies fading into the night,
Depredated mourning of the untold code now,
Frozen beneath the immortal crippling cold!

Suffocated by hatred and choking on rage,
Descending down into this unhallowed age,
Pell back the flesh and see what remains,
Insidious madness runs through my veins!

Liar - offender - beguiler, would you dare my rage?
cheater - deceiver, we disengage!
Embrace of deceit - A stab in the back!
Unrepentant - prepare for attack!

Hungry concenctrations on the plight,
In the darkness of the failing light,
Standing b(l)ack against the wall,
Perpetrate the third and final wall!

Fight for pride - Fight for man - Never fail to understand,
Vengeance shall be mine,
Is there nothing sacred to the brother of lies? NO!
Suffer in Hell 'til the end of time!
