Fading into madness,
Clutching onto life,
Blinded by the ghastly darkness,
Thirsting for the fading light,
Imprisoned by an insane universe,
Where God has clearly died!

Crippled by the sadness,
Mourning the astral light,
A ghost of it's formal self,
A beacon dying from the fading light,
Alternating shutters of moonlight and black,
Slowly fading into despair!

Rising from the blackness,
For the last time - never again!
Casting horror upon the ones
That fear to speak it's name!
Cultivating the soils of sorrow,
The tides life still and lifeless
On the sands of blackened shores!

No rays of light can penetrate
This veritable nightmare!
Lost forever in the labyrinth
Of night and silence!

And the world darkened underneath,
A shroud of cursed blackness,
Forever we plummet now
Into the pits of myth and madness!

Cresting the black horizon,
Our could hears filled with dread!
They won't see what lies ahead,
Once the sun has faded and the moon is dead!
Out into blackness,
Towards whatever awaits us there,
One last wretched funeral,
Mourn the lunar descent!
