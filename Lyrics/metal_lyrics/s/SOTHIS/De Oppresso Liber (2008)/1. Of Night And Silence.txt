We are creatures of a lone existence,
Unholy walkers of the line,
Stalking 'tween every lonely shadow,
Lurking neath the fabric of time.

We constitute of a bastard nation,
Mass descendant of an ancient line,
Disinters of the lame society,
And now we rise against your lies!

We are reapers of the silent harvest,
Uncontrollable and poisoned minds,
Creatures of the absent watcher,
Born and raised outside the hive!

Blind - Inflicted with cryptic visions
Deaf - Muted by ancestral legends
Dumb - Silenced by tainted guidance
Cry - Echoes of night and silence

We come from the earth underneath the trees,
We follow every secret, every path underneath,
We offer no apologies, we enter no pleas,
We swing from the very gallows that they begged us to bring!

Emerging in the moonlight the heat chills our skin,
Blanketed in silence the night bathes our sins,
Creatures of existence congregate the hive,
Children of tomorrow learning how to be alive.

Unfaltering the cursed weakness sanctimonious lives entwined,
Degradation of the mortal coil perpetrators of the altered crime.

Exhortations uttered under moonlight propaganda of the wretched one,
Dwelling blindly through mystic visions, incantations from a cryptic unknown tongue.

Blind - Inflicted with cryptic visions
Deaf - Muted by ancestral legends
Dumb - Silenced by tainted guidance
Cry - Echoes of night and silence
