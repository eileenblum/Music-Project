Welcome my sorrow back to this edgy nightmare once again,
Hollow and absent the thoughts of fury screaming in the night,
Ripped down from the darkened skies,
Haunted by visions exhumed from memories unnaturally,
Dripping from sockets torn from the moments lost unfaltering,
Out from the horrifying light!

Feel the sorrow clutch you from below, perpetual this anguished fright,
Feel the hammer smash down once again, falling victim to eternal night!

Suffer in silence into the ceiling vortex up above,
Grasping at empty air as the floor, it grips you from below,
Unfaltering the black stained cries,
Unclean and desperate, anguished ceremony under fire,
Hissing of vitriol, buried premature under alive!
Treacherous misshapen hive!

Feel the anguish clutch you from below, perpetual as the light,
Feel the hammer smash down once again, shadows running deep into the night!

Unearthly solitudes joining memories forgotten,
Unholy beckonings calling from memories unawnsered,
Inside out again calling from memories unfaltered,
Leaped from the bounds of life shadowed by eternal light!

Perpetual and eternal and infernal!

Discordia alight, blacker than homemade sin,
Ablaze with the light of a hundred thousand fires burning,
Inside out again, enslaved by eternal light,
Tearing and unraveling the fabric of sanity!

Perpetual and eternal and infernal!

Filling the hollow spaces of my conscience once again,
Radiating outward and back into the psyche deep inside,
Enshrouded by the vacant light,
Praying for the silence and for the tortured visions to subside,
Sinking down, deeper perpetual the nightmare carries on,
and on, and on, it never ends!

Feel the horror clutch you from below, perpetual the funeral pyre,
Feel the hammer smash down once again,
Losing all the semblance of regular light!
