Pain a flash of light a glimmer of steel,
The crimson viscious starts to flow,
Releasing my victims from life,
Echoes of a thousand cries,
Carried on the winds of time,
And then there's war!

Hammering down my crippling blow forever more,
Passing my judgement ; no mercy is shown,
Sitting on the throne of crippled madness,
Deaf to all the cries of pity and sadness,
No, not immortal I am flesh and bone,
Silently perched on my Obsidian Throne!

I stand the test of time,
I claim this throne of mine,
I am salvation, creation, liberation of the bleeding kind!

I can feel it in the air a black convulsion of despair,
The memory unprepared all cower beneath my cold hard stare,
I carry on the ancient line and champion the test of time,
Carry on Black Heart of mine and never shall they stand against me!

Mother of Ravens - Father of Lies,
Brother of Hatred, weeping blood from the crimson skies,
Sister of Mercy - Daughter of Death,
Son of the Serpents - Venomous 'til my last breath!

Gather one last time, my congregation,
Suffer the devine black fascination,
Conquer and proclaim ancestral nation,
Wicked and profane this population,
Marching one last time to claim my kingdom on this black unholy land!
