The Clouds rain hatred on all that weep,
And the soil runs red with a raw condensation
Within the depths of desperation!

And the pain will soon end,
As will all,
And the silence shall run deep
Far beneath the crawl!

Beneath the black and boiling sky,
The wretched minions writhe and weep below,
Crying out to a mad, faceless god,
And now he ignores the call!

Beneath the black and boiling sky,
All shadows have dissapeared,
The end of our suffering soon draws near,
And we await the end with bated breath!

All is forgotten in the landscapes of the dead,
Where the traitors have met their end,
These are the lands of rape and ruin,
Where the wretched spiders spin their death,
The lost remains of the ancients litter the earth like desperation,
Leaving nothing but pain and fear,
And hatred and wretched memories!

Beneath the black boiling sky, above damnation,
The shadows escape us and the birds fall silent,
The glories we cherished so proud and everlasting,
Now extinct were wading knee deep in filth and hatred!

I'm screaming at the sky - I'm writhing in my lost salvation!
Unfaltering decry - I'm twisting in the last goodbye!
Stagnation - Temptation - Starvation of the famished ones!
I'm drowning in the vacuous translation,
And the hope that one day soon we will all be dead!
