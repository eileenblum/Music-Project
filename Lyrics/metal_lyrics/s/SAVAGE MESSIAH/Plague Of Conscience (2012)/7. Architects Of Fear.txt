[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

At the zenith of ambition unobstructed
Lays a curse upon mankind
De-populate through massive agenda
In accordance with the guide

Architecture of fear intertwines
Reason the enemy
Imprison the mind
Instilled in the young
To eradicate
Trivializing
Life by mandate

And to the ones that wish you gone
Without a flickers of remorse
In their elitist paradise
In judgment they will sacrifice

And as a monument to sadist machinations
Incremental paradigm
These ten commandments of wickedness unrivaled
Pave the way for our demise

Architecture of fear intertwines
Reason the enemy
Imprison the mind
Instilled in the young
To eradicate
Trivializing
Life by mandate
