[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

Your conceited doctrines burned, all your principles you spurned
Because in truth they were not their, another costume that you wear

The bitterness burns at you
But a lie is never the truth

A supercilious facade to hide the weakness thatâs at heart
In spite the reason that belies the wretched traits you die to hide

The servant was born to betray as the light is sure to face

All at once it crashes down
In this mire you will drown
To the sound of your own voice
Six feet under the gun
All the bridges that you burned
Opportunities you spurned
All come crashing down on you
Six feet under the gun
Such a tangled web we weave
In the practice of deceit
For too long we were ensnared
Six feet under the gun
As it unravels âfore your eyes
Only silence nullifies
Sanctimonious denial
Six feet under the gun

Your burning need to hold the floor, to perpetrate the caricature
And in sarcastic false riposte malfunction in senseless loss

The fantasy swallows you
When youâve bitten off more than you can chew

All at once it crashes down
In this mire you will drown
To the sound of your own voice
Six feet under the gun
All the bridges that you burned
Opportunities you spurned
All come crashing down on you
Six feet under the gun
Such a tangled web we weave
In the practice of deceit
For too long we were ensnared
Six feet under the gun
As it unravels âfor your eyes
Only silence nullifies
Sanctimonious denial
Six feet under the gun
