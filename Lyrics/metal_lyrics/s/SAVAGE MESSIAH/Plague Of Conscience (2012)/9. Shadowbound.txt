[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

Trade the lives of the powerless for the sport of mortal men
Blackened wisdom hails their cries for uniformed repent
Greed is the drug, the addiction is power
Afflicting the throng for the profit of empire

Enact the rites of hypocrisy for the scourge of relevance
Set in motion worlds apart all the herds of mindless men
Like cattle the herd are sent to their slaughter
The failure of freedom to counter the order

Without reason torn apart
As the faceless play their part
Another face to sell the score
Another mask to hide the cause

Face the shadowbound
Working underground
Decide without a sound
How our lives unravel

Trade the lives of the ignorant a collateral in blood
Falsify this paradigm to render all the brain dead
Soulless inaction the root of the cause
The fallout of judgment that sense the fall

Thereâs only worth if you believe
The only valueâs what you see
Yet things get lost behind a price
Of superficial edifice

Face the shadowbound
Working underground
Decide without a sound
How our lives unravel
