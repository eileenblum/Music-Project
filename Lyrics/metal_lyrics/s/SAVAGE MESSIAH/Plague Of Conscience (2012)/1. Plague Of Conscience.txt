[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

Accept the laws of destiny, mirage of a twisted fantasy
To realize what came before, was just the passing of a cause
So with rapture burning, indignation churning
Leaves an acerbic state of mind
All in your mind

Purge the hypocrites that are your enemies
Masquerade of faith sucking dry on the bones of wisdom

Caustic words are your defense to justify incompetence
How it must smart when youâre alone and face the trust youâve always known
Ingratiate yourself, save face and nothing else
When itâs over vilify
Hands to the sky

Purge the hypocrites that are your enemies
Masquerade of faith sucking dry on the bones of wisdom

So one and the same
Devoid of dignity
In plague of conscience now
Propagate their fantasy and fail

Exact the caustic tyranny, chalice of human misery
In weak defense of hopeless cause, but lethargy was all you brought
Malign through scorn abundance
Youâve always been the hunted
Now your sentence takes its toll
Into the void

Purge the hypocrites that are your enemies
Masquerade of faith sucking dry on the bones of wisdom

So one and the same
Devoid of dignity
In plague of conscience now
Propagate their fantasy and fail
