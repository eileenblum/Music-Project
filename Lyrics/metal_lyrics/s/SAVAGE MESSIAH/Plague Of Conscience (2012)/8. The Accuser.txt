[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

Affliction seething, from the recesses of life
Born out of solitude and cast into the light

Shadows burning scars in the cross
Another penance, another loss
Surrounding vacuum forms
Forcing all to conform

Eternal emptiness, the death of shallow life
A looking at the curse a changing in reverse

Shadows burning scars in the cross
Another penance, another loss
Surrounding vacuum forms
Forcing all to conform

In the purge of heavens law
Un-saintly dirge contorts
Souls scream in agony
And die in heresy

Signs of dismay
Paid fortune, all the same

Storm bringing darkness wakes the souls of enmity
The sorrow pacifies all those that should not be

Shadows burning scars in the cross
Another penance, another loss
Surrounding vacuum forms
Forcing all to conform

In the purge of heavens law
Un-saintly dirge contorts
Souls scream in agony
And die in heresy
