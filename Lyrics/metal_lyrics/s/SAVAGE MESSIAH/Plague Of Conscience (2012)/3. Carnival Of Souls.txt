[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

Indentured now as servants trapped beneath the weight
Bone crushing reality that snared the hand of fate
Saviours to soldiers all are perilous in mind
To starve a nation yet and pander to its pride

Concealed within
Apathy routine
And yet we preach

Can you believe that people never thought of asking?
What more do we forfeit when scared of the unmasking

Concealed within
Apathy routine
And yet we preach

Dead as the prophets warning
Drowned in the same mire
In carnival of souls
We march to expire

Broken the wreckage points to constant self renewal
So treat the symptoms once more, blind to the fall

Concealed within
Apathy routine
And yet we preach

Dead as the prophets warning
Drowned in the same mire
In carnival of souls
We march to expire
And through the degradation
Passed by a single cause
This through control is reason
Enslaved forevermore
