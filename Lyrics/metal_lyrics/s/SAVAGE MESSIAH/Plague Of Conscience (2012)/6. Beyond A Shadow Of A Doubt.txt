[Music: Dave Silver &amp; Stefano Selvatico, Lyrics: Dave Silver]

In the void between conscious thought
Where susceptible your mind is bought

And through the web of conscience
The perpetrators slip
In freedom from the known
Youâll see the truth

Beyond a shadow of a doubt
And as the light creates the dark you fear
These perceptions have to be adhered

The timeless sense of logic
That breaks wicked cause
It seems has been forgotten
Inertia trade

Beyond a shadow of a doubt...

And in the vacuous pursuit of self
Where ego burns the truth in stealth

And through the web of conscience
The perpetrators slip
In freedom from the known
Youâll see the truth

Beyond a shadow of a doubt...
