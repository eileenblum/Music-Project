[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

You speak more than you think
And think less than anyone believes
Inert futility
This numbing paradox that screams
Where is sympathy
You spat in the face of opportunity
Then with bold audacity
Pointed the finger right at me

The coward in you runs
So spineless afraid of all you see
Infant stupidity
Concealing shallowness to hide
Lost in apathy
Or left in the dust of mediocrity
Faced with cold reality
Another slave to cast away

Now wonder why
As you reach for the sky
On a wave of your own self importance you ride
Beg for forgiveness to those that you scorn
The all seeing I has you down to the core
To the core

You speak more than you think
And think less than many will perceive
Attest misanthropy
This numbing apathy that breeds
Where is sympathy
You spat in the face of opportunity
Then with bold audacity
Pointed the finger right at me

Pointed the finger right at me

Now wonder why
As you reach for the sky
On a wave of your own self importance you ride
Beg for forgiveness to those that you scorn
The all seeing I has you down to the core
To the core
