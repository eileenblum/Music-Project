[Music &amp; lyrics: Dave Silver]

Drift in darkness
Whispering of light
Afraid of reason
You hold to whatâs in sight
Holding the cross we bare
Striking us unaware
Losing faith all over
Selling the score

At first light theyâre coming
To reap the unrewarding
All will bow unquestioned
To shelter the harbinger

Soul lies, evermore
War in the sanctuary
Soul tires, marching on
Resistance in thought alone

In thought alone
In thought alone

Thinking aloud
Denouncing deceit
Cynical logic
Refutes the truth I speak
Holding the cross we bare
Striking us unaware
Losing faith all over
Selling the score

At first light theyâre coming
To reap the unrewarding
All will bow unquestioned
To shelter the harbinger

Soul lies, evermore
War in the sanctuary
Soul tires, marching on
Resistance in thought alone

In thought alone
In thought alone
