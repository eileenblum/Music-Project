Forced from reason and carved into stone
A shrine to sorrow that stand alone

Our leaders from future to past
From the wreckage, Forced to last

It's of the mark, The fateful dark
The cries of all
It's of the mark, The fateful dark
Behold the fall

The fateful dark

Seeking refuge the hurt lingers on
Repel to suffer, And shatter the void

Our leaders of future and past
From the holy, Bereft of class

It's of the mark, The fateful dark
The cries of all
It's of the mark, The fateful dark
Behold the fall

Soul shatters, To mirror the void
The cracks that splinter, Awaken the evermore

It's of the mark, The fateful dark
The cries of all
It's of the mark, The fateful dark
Behold the fall

The fateful dark
