Hold on to nothing, There's nothing holding you
No chains of self-restriction, Cutting right through you
Until you're backed in a corner, Caught in apathy's grip
Not willing to motivate, Unwilling to let it slip

Born into judgement, Outside of grace
Open hostility, Found in every place

Faith unto loathing, Of loathing twisting you
Four walls of isolation, Bearing down on you
And now the cost of attrition, propaganda the the script
Continue to circulate, Unseeing damned like fate

Born into judgement, Outside of grace
Open hostility, Found in every place

ICONOCAUST - Destroyed by fear
ICONOCAUST - Defaced martyr of the insincere
ICONOCAUST - Destroyed by fear
ICONOCAUST - Sacrificed to the new frontier
One by one you'll fall

Rise
Forged from our broken pride
Rise
Denounce the hypocrites and fight

Burning sedition, defeatist hold on you
All pawn to sacrificial, Penance haunting you
And all that's left is derision, Locked internal belief
Senseless to paradox, Beholden unto grief

Born into judgement, Outside of grace
Open hostility, Found in every place

ICONOCAUST - Destroyed by fear
ICONOCAUST - Defaced martyr of the insincere
ICONOCAUST - Destroyed by fear
ICONOCAUST - Sacrificed to the new frontier
One by one you'll fall
