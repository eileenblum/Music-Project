Through the darkness and the din
Hope's the fading light that flickers in the distance

When all minds align
Conspire in time
Faced with the fallen divide

So live as one, Already dead
Face your fears
Betray the dread
Live as one, One already dead

I see a world that's losing hope
Empty prayers of lives evoke
The setting down, To watch it fade away

So live as one, Already dead
Face your fears
Betray the dread
Live as one, One already dead

Already dead

Into the face of falling
Lost by the false cries calling

So live as one, Already dead
Face your fears
Betray the dread
Live as one, One already dead

Already dead
