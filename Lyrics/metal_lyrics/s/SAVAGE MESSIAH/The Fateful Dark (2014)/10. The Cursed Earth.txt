The enemy lines, Distorted by time
Division of life breeding crime
Wicked distrust and power they lust
Oppression of will stamped to dust
The outstretched hand, Beckoning forth
Calling the weak ones that fall
Into their graves, Open as wounds
Shield the spectres to mourn

Shadows of loss
Remain to count the cost
Welcome to

The cursed earth

Social divides, Enacted by lies
Built on enforced suicide
Separate lives, Now intertwined
Imprison the captives like swine
Protection the veil, the only way out
The fight to exist doomed to fail
Collectivist hell, Expression denies
The weakening failure is fought

Shadows of loss
Remain to count the cost
Welcome to

The cursed earth

The nemesis hides, Corrupted by time
Desolate wastelands decay
As poverty claims, The stricken assault
The crushing defeat brings to halt
Dystopian march, Consuming the earth
Surveillance of life brought unheard
Soldiers are brought, Humanity stripped
Broken and scarred they submit

Shadows of loss
Remain to count the cost
Welcome to

The cursed earth
