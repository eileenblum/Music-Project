Sanctified unholy dreams
Death premature
Vindicated memories
Caught evermore

Time will tell
Guilt repel
Primitive
Born in hell

Vilified, Ungodly force
Defiling grace
Blackened misery dictates
Enforced arms race

Time will tell
Guilt repel
Primitive
Born in hell

SCAVENGERS - of Mercy
SCAVENGERS - of Mercy
SCAVENGERS - of Mercy
SCAVENGERS - of Mercy

ALL FOR ONE - SLAVE TO PAIN

Agony, Self-loathing hordes
Bestowing fate
Parasitic suffering
Baring on hate

Time will tell
Guilt repel
Primitive
Born in hell

SCAVENGERS - of Mercy
SCAVENGERS - of Mercy
SCAVENGERS - of Mercy
SCAVENGERS - of Mercy
