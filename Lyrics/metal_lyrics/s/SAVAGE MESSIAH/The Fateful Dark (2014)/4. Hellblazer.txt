Awoken into suicide
To rid the demons from your mind
Condemning into certitude
Of death's inferno awaiting you

Heading out on a road to loss
Cynical, You must bear the cross
Keep the balance at eternal cost
Until deeds redeem your soul

Rejected pleas are crucified
Unto this servant now abide
There is no breaking down these walls
Accept your fate without recourse

Heading out on a road to loss
Cynical, You must bear the cross
Keep the balance at eternal cost
Until deeds redeem your soul
