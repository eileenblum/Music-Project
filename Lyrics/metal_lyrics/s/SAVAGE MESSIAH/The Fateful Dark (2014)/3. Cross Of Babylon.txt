Caught in the crossfire, Sentenced to faith
Coercive deliverance, A despotic fate
Shouldering burdens from one to the next
No hour of penance can lay you to rest
Forgo saturated establishment lies
The proliferation of truth they disguise
From out of the darkness of hope it is lost

In belief you are trapped like the open deceiver
To be heard you must plead like the weakened disciple's run
On your knees you are taught to beseech you deliverer
Only time that is lost as the darkness encroaches

Cross of babylon - Burning skies of blackened wisdom
Cross of babylon - Secrecy and mass derision
Cross of babylon - Harbinger imagination
Cross of babylon - Soldier of annihilation

Forced euphemistic perversion of truth
Engendered malignance no hope of rebuke
Trapped confrontation, Insidiously
Killing for peace in the land of the free
Judgement abundance, Provoking consent
The failures of greed not the failures of man
In wounds of sorrow, Or pitiless death
Beyond sight of mercy,and bold existence

In deceit you are sworn like the brutal dictator
To be seen you must plead to the prejudice seeker's gun
On your feet you are taught to destroy your ideals
Only life that is lost as the darkness approaches

Cross of babylon - Burning skies of blackened wisdom
Cross of babylon - Secrecy and mass derision
Cross of babylon - Harbinger imagination
Cross of babylon - Soldier of annihilation
