Resistant to anger, The cutting blade of truth
The sound of seperate lives entwined
The race is for order, The sacrament is damned
Get on your knees and play the part

Find a liberating cause, In the vacuum of remorse
As the puppets sway like lost forgotten dreams

This vengeance is weakness, the many fall like rain
A shower of bullets keeps them down
There is no constitution that will save you now
Raise your hands and count as one

Find a liberating cause, In the vacuum of remorse
As the puppets sway like lost forgotten dreams

Minority of one
Cuts you down in fear
Minority of one
Ideas drown
Sold beyond the sun

Minority of one
Cuts you down in fear
Minority of one
Ideas drown
Sold beyond the sun
