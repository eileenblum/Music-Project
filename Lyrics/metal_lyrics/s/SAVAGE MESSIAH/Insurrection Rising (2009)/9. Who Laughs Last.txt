[Music &amp; lyrics: Silver]

Bound to turmoil, driven by the need
Antipathy and the strength to see

Rising through scores of the dead
Determined to reap what is said

Further now to what Iâve never known
No lies in silence the storm has grown

Fight!
Into eternity fall
Fight!
Obscured delusion contorts

Forsaking final agony
To remove total disparity

Into new seclusion
Born out of resurrection
To smote my only enemy
And so he who laughs last
Becomes the vindicated
Eradicates the fallacy

[Solo: Dave]

[Guitar theme: Sy &amp; Dave together]

Sanctified desecrated dreams
Foiled temptations mask the damaged scene

Destiny rides through the smoke
To sharpen the axis of hope

Insipid homage to duplicity
Vacuous and mind destroying leach

Fight!
Into eternity fall
Fight!
Obscured delusion contorts

Forsaking final agony
To remove total disparity

Into new seclusion
Born out of resurrection
To smote my only enemy
And so he who laughs last
Becomes the vindicated
Eradicates the fallacy
