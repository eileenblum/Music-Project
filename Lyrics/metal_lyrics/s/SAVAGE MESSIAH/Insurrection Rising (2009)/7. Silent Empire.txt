[Music: Taplin, Silver, Lyrics: Silver]

To build a silent empire
Mired by disgrace
The vacant shadows raise your throne
To mitigate your soul

They scream my name over again
They are invisible and ingrained

[Solo: Dave]

Cold horizons vanquished
In selfish lustful gaze
Destroyed perceptions scar the script
Capricious impulse drift

They scream my name over again
They are invisible and ingrained

[Solo: Sy]

They scream my name over again
They are invisible and ingrained
They scream my name over again
They are invisible and ingrained
They scream my name over again
They are invisible!
