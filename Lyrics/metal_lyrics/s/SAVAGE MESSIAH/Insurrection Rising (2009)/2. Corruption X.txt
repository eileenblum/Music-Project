[Music: Taplin, Silver, Lyrics: Taplin]

You swear your life upon the cross
False idols, you would believe
Defiler of the truth
Come forth to me

Corruption
Starting to erupt
Corruption

So bow your hear upon me
I will grant your solitude
Doomed by greed and pestilence
Forsaken

Corruption
Starting to erupt
Corruption

Igniting your path
Bestowing the light

[Solo: Dave]
[Solo: Sy]

Your grief will pay by all
Victims in despair
Pay in blood
Son of sin

Corruption
Starting to erupt
Corruption
