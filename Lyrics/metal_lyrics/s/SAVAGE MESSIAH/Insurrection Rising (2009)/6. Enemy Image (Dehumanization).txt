[Music &amp; lyrics: Silver]

Create the enemy to blind society
Trap with fear, suffocate
Then free thoughts eradicate

The veil of sanctity to blind certainty
Repetition mantra, hypnotize
To imprison and deride

Masters of elimination
Killers of control
Theyâre bred in violence
Death in their soul and with its instigation
Propagandaâs heart
Strength born from severance
Now fear dehumanize

[Solo I: Dave) ]
[Solo II: Sy]

Blind hatred magnetize for agenda energized
Divide and conquer, massacre
From ignorance genocide

Masters of elimination
Killers of control
Theyâre bred in violence
Death in their soul and with its instigation
Propagandaâs heart
Strength born from severance
Now fear dehumanize

Masters of elimination
Dehumanize
Masters of elimination
Dehumanize
Masters of elimination
Dehumanize
Masters of elimination
Dehumanize
