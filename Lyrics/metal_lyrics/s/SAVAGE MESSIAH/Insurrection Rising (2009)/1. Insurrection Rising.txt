[Music: Silver, Cron, Lyrics: Silver]

Parasites have lauded victory
Scorching permeations blaze to seize the day
Felt like an eternity, penance has been paid
So here it is for all to see, your judgment now is scathed

Judgment now is scathed!

Nevermore the demonâs piety
Shadows grow inside my soul I pray to be free
The bleakness of your future now must haunt your every move
As victory for what itâs worth was never in the script

Never in the script!

Never mind the black horizon
Never mind the approaching storm
No regard for losing pace
No sympathy this time

Fight!
Unite!
Unmitigated fury
Rise!
Despise!
Vindication as the insurrection rise

[Solo: Dave]

Devastating now without mercy
Cast into the fire with your negativity
These shackles threatened everything, I couldnât walk away
With rapture now my hatred sacrificed another day

Sacrificed again!

Never mind the black horizon
Never mind the approaching storm
No regard for losing pace
No sympathy this time

Fight!
Unite!
Unmitigated fury
Rise!
Despise!
Vindication as the insurrection rise
