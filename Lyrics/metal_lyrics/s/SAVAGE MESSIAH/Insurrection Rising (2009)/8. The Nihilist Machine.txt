[Music &amp; lyrics: Silver]

Rising through the land of the blind
To serve the one-eyed king
Subordination of your subconsciousness
Enslaved by culture and pursuit of success

Wreathed in sadness soulless prevail
Wisdom conceived in lies

The nihilist machine is here
The nihilist
Burn!

Conform to the hypocrisy
Sell your soul for the coin
Obliterate without mercy for the minor gain
Institutions commence and the shackles remain

Wreathed in sadness soulless prevail
Wisdom conceived in lies

The nihilist machine is here
The nihilist
Burn!

[Solo I: Dave]
[Solo II: Sy]

Rising through the land of the blind
To serve the one-eyed king
Subordination of your subconsciousness
Enslaved by culture and pursuit of success

Wreathed in sadness soulless prevail
Wisdom conceived in lies

The nihilist machine is here
The nihilist
Burn!
