[Music &amp; lyrics: Silver]

Obscured acuity
Distorting clarity
Malfeasance divine
Shattering the soul

Freedom is now abstract
Imposed by those who act
And so oblivious
The war machine is raised

Wrath and perdition directed by wisdom
Now forced to your knees to reap basic needs
Whatâs right or wrong? Itâs just a vision
Mankind created just like your prison cell

The serpentâs kiss
(The serpentâs kiss)
Anoints the sick

Vicariously now
Remove the human blame
Dispose validity
Render all slaves blind

Death and submission
The serpentâs religion
Dementia divine
Reaping in time

Control delusion
To raise institution
Reform bereft
Slavery incepted now

The serpentâs kiss
(The serpentâs kiss)
Anoints the sick
(Divinity)
The serpentâs kiss!

[Solo: Dave]

To strike the demon down
Decapitate its crown
To liberate its throne
Immortal blood now flows

Wrath and perdition directed by wisdom
Now forced to your knees to reap basic needs
Whatâs right or wrong? Itâs just a vision
Mankind created just like your prison cell

The serpentâs kiss
(The serpentâs kiss)
Anoints the sick
(Divinity)
The serpentâs kiss!

The serpentâs kiss!
