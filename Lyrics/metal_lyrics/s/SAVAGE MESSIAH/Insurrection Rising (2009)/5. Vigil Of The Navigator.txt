[Music: Taplin, Silver, Lyrics: Silver]

Through observation I have built a mental wall
To shield the tyranny that festers in us all

To see the damned returning and face the disconcerting
Reveals within
The key to self-destruction born out of blind instruction
Distorting true

Vigil!
Through time
Navigate
Martyr!
Your mind

When disillusion beckons consumes the will to fight
An exodus of longing surrenders to your plight

Distort with deep deception create a false perception
You are undone
Too blind to be convinced and too weak to resist it
Temptationâs fool

Vigil!
Through time
Navigate
Martyr!
Your mind

[Solo I: Dave]
[Solo II: Sy]

Vigil!
Through time
Navigate
Martyr!
Your mind

Vigil!
Through time
Navigate
Martyr!
Your mind

Vigil!
Vigil!
Vigil!
Vigil!
