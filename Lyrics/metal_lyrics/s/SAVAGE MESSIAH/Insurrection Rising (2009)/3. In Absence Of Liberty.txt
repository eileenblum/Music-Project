[Music &amp; lyrics: Silver]

Forced allegiance sheltering weak minds
Breed complacency to subjugate life
Brainwashed puppets to spur the machine
A black tomorrow is the utopian dream

None more enslaved than those who trust that they are free
False preconceptions destroying identity
To take authority as unquestioned truth
Forsaking liberty for archaic sanctuary

Our leaders trapped us in despair
Whatâs inside no longer cares
As the forced religions rupture into war
Whatâs left now is humanity
But humane it ceased to be
As our liberty distorted by their lies

A world held hostage to its god
Ever searching for reprieve
Expendable to the machine
Trapped completely cannot leave

[Soloâs I &amp; II: Dave]

Broken now, the system is flawed
Only those with power see the reward
Majority who slave away
Just wait in vain and pray for a better day

Our leaders trapped us in despair
Whatâs inside no longer cares
As the forced religions rupture into war
Whatâs left now is humanity
But humane it ceased to be
As our liberty distorted by their lies
