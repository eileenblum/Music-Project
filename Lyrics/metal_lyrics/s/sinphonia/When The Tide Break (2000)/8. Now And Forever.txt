Side by side we walked in silence always together
The two of its were not to break
Only death could us separate
Until now where you poor soul wanders lost in reverie
There was no way out of it
The dark path was decided
You forsake me

I don't mind following you
I won't sigh if I could be with you
Tell me where you are I am coming to be with you

The terrible thoughts in your mind
Caught and locked in ignorance
What is going to happen when you are alone?
Where are you now?
I think it's a ghastly place where you are the only one

I don't mind following you
I won't sigh if I could be with you
Tell me where you are I am coming to be with you

I am coming to be with you
Now and forever
