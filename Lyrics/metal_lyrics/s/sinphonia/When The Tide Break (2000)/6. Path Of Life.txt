She walks in silence
Alone - only with him in her thoughts
The path of life wasn't what she dreamed of

She has lost the will to love
Which came from an unknown place
Where is it now?

It's too late to save the lost
Maybe one last word would heal a bit?
She cries out hoping that he is listening

Wherever he is, she feels it
She can't stand thinking if him
So she buries him with her power to push it away

It's too late to save the lost
Maybe one last word would heal a bit?
She cries out hoping that he is listening

The words are gone
Now he is gone forever
Never in her thoughts again
Only when time says it's time
The will to love will be rebuilt
She can have peace in her heart
- and see light of the path of life
