The moon emits magic energies
The night knows my mind
I walk into the night's scary jungle
With hidden strange creatures

But when the moon shines through
Take care of your soul
Strange moods fighting for the power in my mind
Oh moon - you old magician
Without you my life would be empty
You give me strength in life
Oh moon - you and I have known each other for many years
But it's far from all I understand

I change form - an invard animal treaten forward
I feel the lust for life and blood
The night and the hunt flood my mind
I am bound by the power of the moon

Oh moon - you old magician
Without you my life would be empty
You give me strength in life
Oh moon - you and I have known each other for many years
But it's far from all I understand

Oh moon - you old magician
Without you my life would be empty
You give me strength in life
Oh moon - you and I have known each other for many years
But it's far from all I understand
