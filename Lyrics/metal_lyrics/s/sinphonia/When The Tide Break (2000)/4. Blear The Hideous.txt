Deep in yourself
Phenomenons are fighting
Blaspheming slowly and quietly
Something has betrayed
Deep inside yourself
The pain is ravaging
Don't know what to do
The grief is remarkable
Look inside you
Look into the eyes of pain
Then you blear the hideous
And the sadness will be moribund

Then you blear...
Sadness - so strong and morbid
The heart of pain is weak
Unite with it

Cry it out - scream it out
Open your mind - listen to the feelings
Something will change and
Strong you will be
Then you blear the hideous
And the Sadness will be moribund

Then you blear...
Then you blear the hideous
And the sadness will be moribund
Then you blear...
