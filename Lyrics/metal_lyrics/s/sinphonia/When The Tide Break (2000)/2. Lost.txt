The lost feelings hurt
The empty room must be filled with courage
I want to make my dreams come true

Everything is sad and indifferent
There must be a way out of here

I believe in the unattainable
It will always succeed

Give me space so I can fight for myself
Give me strength so I can win back what I have lost

I won't give up - won't listen to anyone
I don't wanna bleed knowing that I didn't fight

I won't lose anything
Cause I have already lost everything

Give me space so I can fight for myself
Give me strength so I can win back what I have lost

Give me space so I can fight for myself
Give me strength so I can win back what I have lost
