[GODS:] She believes she is embrancing infinite truth. One feeble spirit touch 
and She will catch the first glimpse of disharmony.

[SHE:]

Resting from my godly gift
Shades of formless visit my dreams
A vague voice, a grinding graze
Exposing me to myself

[Chorus:]
How can this be?
The world I perceive has to be me
Are these dimensions out of reach?

An absent-minded, anxious god
Twisting the lives in a mortal shell
Let me dissolve into the formless world

[Chorus]

Even he almighty are intended to fall
