[GODS:] Like all non-divine, finite beings, She is a book upon an endless 
shelf. Her words are writtem ny us to be acted by her, as they are for evey 
other mortal being. She will have to see that we are, and that we are what 
She can never be.

[SHE:]

Shadows of ever fulfil me
Within me they talk to me

GODS:

"You are nothing but a comedy
A note in the divine symphony"

[GODS:]

"Accepting will be your remedy"
"To continue next act of your play"
"We are within every comedy"
"We are the blue brightness you craved"

[SHE:]

(I will not accept)
(I am more than a play)
(I am the brightness)

[GODS:]
"We are..."
