[GODS:] Harmony must be seen before disharmony can be felt. Let her feel and 
form all fragments of the material world. She will seem to be a goddess, 
without knowing that she is an actress.

[SHE:]

Struck to the ground, senses are unbound
My red hands, burning into the earth
Every spect of dust radiates from me

[Chorus:]
Colour of all matter
Turns red in me
And I shine upon all life
I desecrate chaos of my mind
Seeing through a simple world
Bodies built of dust, not soul

The sleeper, the reflective, all the lost people
They are sleepwalkers in my dream
I am a goddess, I inhaled harmony
I exhale and the world gives in on me

[Chorus]

We are all without soul
