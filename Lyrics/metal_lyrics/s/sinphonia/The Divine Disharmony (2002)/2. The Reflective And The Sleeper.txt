[GODS:] She claims to withhold wisdom, while She misleads her sleepers with a 
self-inflicted truth. Yet, she is but the core of another comedy, another 
character in the divine disharmony. Our next act will define the doubt in 
her mind.

[SHE:]

Float numb in the water
Wait for the end of your strength
Rest your ears beneath the surface
And focus your eyes in the grar sky

You're a shadow in a shadowland
Insensible, indistinct
Drifting with the breeze
Allowing the sleep to set in

I despise you, the sleepers, for not being me

[Chorus:]
We all have to choose
Between the reflective and the sleeper
Between too much or nothing at all

Now look at me
I've ley red light into my eyes
I have risen from the water
Opened my eyes to the mirrors

I'm a mirror in a mirrorland
Insensible, indistinct

[Chorus]

I despise myself for not being you
