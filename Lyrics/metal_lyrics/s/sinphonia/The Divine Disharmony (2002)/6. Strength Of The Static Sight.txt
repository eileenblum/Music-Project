[GODS:] Before knowledge is unveiled there must be awareness of the veil. And 
so the strength of her static sight shall wane in the light of the why. Let 
spirits overflow her stage, and She will see. She is still deprived of her 
beloved harmony.

[SPIRITS:]

As time entered our forever
She came out of the never
The ravishing queen of perception
Her red static soul absorbed our sight
We are all lost people
We want you to unveil our will
The truth of our deprived and deranged souls
We scream

[Chorus:]
Wake us from this timeless dream
We need knowledge to measure our misery

Your presence creates chaos
We are blessed with
Harmony, disharmony
In infinity without memory
We have become aware
We have become aware of...

Your world of bright memory
Somehow you need to increase our part in eternity
The truth of our deprived and deranged souls
Who, whn and why?

[Chorus]

[SHE:]

Bury my mind in my memory
When did I wonder?
Where is the true harmony
I need the truth an angel can give
Still I am nothing
I can't tell you anything of my deranged soul
I now see

[Chorus:]
I was never a god in your timeless dream
I need knowledge to measure your misey
