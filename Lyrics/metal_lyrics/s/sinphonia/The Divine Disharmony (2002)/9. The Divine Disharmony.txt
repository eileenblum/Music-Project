[GODS:] To be born is to be without infinity. Still She believes eternal 
harmony is within her reach. That is why She shall be reborn in the world of 
perishable matter. With inhuman knowledge inside a human shell. This is the 
fall She has always been searching for.

[SHE:]

Behind my closed eyes
I fear the endless sky
I cannot stand their light in this world
The gods spoke to me

[GODS:]

[Chorus:]
We leave you to your mortal mind
Leave you on the path we defined

[SHE:]

A soul of dust caught by the wind
Into the never
My will's confined to my human why
I am bound by memory

[GODS:]

[Chorus]

[SHE:]

I sought the insight of infinity
To heal my wounded vanity
But now I roam this earth
Without will to wonder why

[GODS:]

[Chorus]

We leave you to your
Mortal mind
Leave the truth behind

Divine disharmony
In every comedy
The very script you speak
Lack the value you seek

Divine disharmony
Flows through all you see
Pierces all you feel
-Only gods can be gods
