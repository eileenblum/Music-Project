[GODS:] It is time for her to spread her will into the shapeless dimension. 
Through memory She will gain divinty, and by dreams, desires and wishes She 
will rulr. Let her become the stage and the drama upon which the entire 
spirit world will gaze.

[SHE:]

I leave my body behind
And dissolve into the new stream
All life disappears for my eyes
Spirits reappear for my soul
Perception, memory and I
Reborn elements in this spirit world

And I feel the formless change
Their fragments swirl in the light of the self
In my brightness, their souls I shape
I dream, desire and wish a newborn world

[Chorus:]
Within my red divine
They imbue me for a while
Within my red divine
I imbue them for a while
I mesmorize their minds, hypnotize as I shine
Reality follows me, as I feel

Countless souls without memory
Timeless and senseless
I seek out essence for my desire
Revealing time and memory
I force their feelings in me
I reflect all, I am infinity

And I feel the formless change
Their fragments swirl in the light of the self
In my brightness, their souls I shape
I dream, desire and wish a newborn world

[Chorus]
