[GODS:] Characters search for meaning within the script. But the script is 
what they seek, yet will never be able to see. She now knows, and thus She 
will never again deceive.

[SHE:]
Sleepers
Close your eyes to me
I hold the knowledge you seek
My wisdom can't lead you
Will is nothing to
The divine disharmony

Sinphonia is:
Monika Pedersen-vocals
Henrik Rangsrup-guitars
Thor Jeppesen-bass
Peter Jensen-keyboards
Dennis Buhl-drums
