Following an ashen trail, I am led into the end of the day
Into the silence to understand this betrayal
Within a moment I flick through his book again
Only to see it rewrite itself before my very eyes

The toss of the book scatters pages, shatters words
Letters start dancing, reshaping, mating into a blur
Titles fade away, books evaporate
Until silence has left me but one cover to unveil

With the divided sun watching me
I realize what I still did not read

Do I need what the last cover conceals?
Do I need it, if nothing is revealed?
Do I need what the last cover conceals?
