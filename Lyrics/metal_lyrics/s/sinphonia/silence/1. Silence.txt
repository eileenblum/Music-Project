Silence, what seems to be silence, silence
In the distance, the undefined distance
Found between two forevers
Soulless sea and shapeless sky
In this dimension untold
Soulless sea and shapeless sky

In this dimension untold
Behold a world mirror unfolds

Clarity, clarity takes shape here
In silence, in silence
Clarity, clarity finds sound here
In silence, in silence
Silence

Silence, what seems to be silence, silence
In the distance, the undefined distance
Found between two worlds forgotten
The sea and sky of mind and eye
In this dimension untold
The sea and sky, mind and eye

In this dimension untold
Behold a world mirror unfolds

Silence

Clarity, clarity takes shape here
In silence, in silence
Clarity, clarity finds sound here
In silence, in silence
Silence, silence

Clarity, clarity takes shape here
In silence, in silence
Clarity, clarity finds sound here
In silence, in silence
Silence

Infinity mates with infinity
A bright flash of the split sun
