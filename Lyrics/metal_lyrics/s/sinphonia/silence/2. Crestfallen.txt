Outside, away from the words I never wrote
An ocean breeze, to refresh my faith in me
A breeze full of silence - sighs, whispers, voices
Words dance with the wind, the untold screams at me

I am crestfallen
I am crestfallen

A subconscious rush pulls me back in me

Without hope now, I lay crestfallen, I lay crestfallen
Without words in pale sand and sea, I lay crestfallen, I lay crestfallen
In fading light, bringing me behind reality, bringing me behind
In fading light, I am crestfallen

A subconscious rush pulls me back in me

The stories, I never told, still insist to unfold
I must detach my nerves from the core of my soul
Reattach them to light, and wait for the sun to set

A subconscious rush pulls me back in me

Without hope now, I lay crestfallen, I lay crestfallen
Without words in pale sand and sea, I lay crestfallen, I lay crestfallen
In fading light, bringing me behind reality, bringing me behind
In fading light, I am crestfallen

But in the split of my last second
A flash from a divided sun, grabs me through my stare
Bringing me behind reality
Bringing me behind reality
Bringing me behind reality
Behind reality

Without hope now, I lay crestfallen, I lay crestfallen
Without words in pale sand and sea, I lay crestfallen, I lay crestfallen
In fading light, bringing me behind reality, bringing me behind
In fading light, I am crestfallen
