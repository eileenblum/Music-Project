I can't imagine what did you felt at that timeÂ 
you just slept with painsÂ 
can't breath well, can't consummate anythingÂ 
all you need just injected to your bodyÂ 

miserable cover up his senseÂ 
cover up his mind, cover up his soulÂ 

horrority, deplerable, desprerateÂ 
rise up him selfÂ 
desire, be able, concentratedÂ 
hope for a miracleÂ 
forvented yourselfÂ 
breath.. please breathÂ 

and your body can't make a moreÂ 
prostated with clap eyes offÂ 
your breath more and more frailedÂ 
and your goneÂ 

now he's breath offÂ 
gone foreverÂ 
flying higherÂ 
lead to other realmÂ 

now he's breath offÂ 
gone foreverÂ 
flying higherÂ 
never returnÂ 
can't be togetherÂ 
now you renounce me ...Â 

I'm standed with dopeyÂ 
contend with this ordealÂ 
my mind fly awayÂ 
seek all remembranceÂ 
with you ..Â 

lives becoming demiseÂ 
demise becoming livesÂ 
I pray for youÂ 
glisten by tears, eye cry ..
