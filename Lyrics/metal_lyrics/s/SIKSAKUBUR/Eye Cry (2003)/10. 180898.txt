I never assumed before
I would got the star
that will brightening my life
I kept the star on my heart
to beautify my silent night
lives became ruptured
cause of radiance illuminate my way
day by day passed away
I'm still walked on the same way

but line not always straight
the ordeal accosted me
my this happened to me ??

perforced to pick up the pieces
pulverized all promises
but I can't to loose you
echoes the whisper of my voice
saying your name

I try to not give up
to kept my blither on my side
my hope .. my dream .. my savior ..

now the star become my angel
obstacle .. burden
grow into a better way
obstacle .. burden
vanished by gyrate of time
obstacle .. burden
becoming my sweetest dream

recline over
on my shoulder
make you warm when life grows colder
fly me over
bring me higher
say you're gonna stay forever

every moment I'm awake
the further I'm away
