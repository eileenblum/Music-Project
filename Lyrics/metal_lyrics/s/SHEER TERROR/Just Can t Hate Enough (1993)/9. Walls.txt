Walks in the park, kissing in the dark. It was all a lark- another sad old joke. I should've known- it's happened before. Those days of yore have taught me nothing. Leading myself around like a little boy lost in the city of lights. From teacher to student, Helena to Prudence. Nights crying to my cat. Lie on my bed of thorns, rest my head on a rock And watch my walls turn black. Maybe raise my empty glass to propose a toast. Ha- the spirits gone. Don't look back and I won't look ahead. I've always favored the things I dread. Glutton for punishment- that's my line. We all have our crosses to bear. I've tried- I've cried- don't bother me. I've strived- I've lied- I don't want to see. I've cheapened- I've weakened- my tanks are low. Every failure of my life exposed.
