Listen can you hear it too? Or were you only passing through? Deafening loud enough not to hear. It's not there, but it's here. Missed through the drafts going under the door The closest I've been was lying on the floor. But it keeps on slipping, It keeps on slipping it keeps on slipping away. Wake up alone twisting and turning in bed, It's been like this forever. Someone put out that light so I can get some rest at night. I'm blacking out, I'm blacking out, I'm blacking out I'm blacking out, I'm blacking out. Bathed in caffeine, cradled in nicotine, bedded in barbed-wire. Does anyone here know any lullabies? Wake up alone in a pool of sweat. I've got a knife in my brain. Twisting and turning. Dry heaves, I can't breathe. I can't close my eyes. I jam my fingers right down my throat. Twisting and turning, I find the door, just like before. But like before, there's no way out.
