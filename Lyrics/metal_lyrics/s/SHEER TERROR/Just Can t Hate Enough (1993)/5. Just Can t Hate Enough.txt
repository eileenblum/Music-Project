Enough of your shit, I've had it up to here. It's time I made my intentions clear. I don't give a fuck about your skinhead pride And I couldn't care less about the lower east side. I'm just a working class slob who's tired of getting the short end of the stick. It ain't my problem if I'm not like you And I'm not sucking Uncle Sam's dick. You call that negative- you think I'm out of touch. I can't stand living, I can't stand you, and I just can't hate enough. You say my hatred has blinded me where I can't see as far as I could spit. But that's where you're wrong 'cause I could see quite clear And I could see that you're full of shit.
