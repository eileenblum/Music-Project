Four fucking years we've been burning our time, We're at the back of the line and we're still waiting. All of the times of putting up with shit and now we're wading through it And we're still hating. This was never meant to be a garden of roses, or elitist poses, but you've forgotten. Now it's all about who's making the loot, This big basket of fruit has now gone rotten. Day by day you pave the way. If that's what you want, then you've got it. Everybody's talking about this and that About tit for tat. Well what's the story? Unity and justice is where you build your pride and you're choosing sides well where's the glory? Walking so tall with your head held high. You're in the public eye with cool things to say. I don't have the time to deal with fools like you. I've got work to do. I've got bills to pay Before you get up and tell them that I'm wrong Why don't you shut up and listen to the fucking song. And if you don't like it, it's just too bad. We'll shout it strong, shout it loud. We are the ugly and proud and if you don't like hat we say then you pay us no mind. And stop wasting my time, Like it or not we are here to stay.
