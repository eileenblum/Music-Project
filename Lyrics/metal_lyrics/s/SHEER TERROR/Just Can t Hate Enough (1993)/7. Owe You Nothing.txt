Degradation- not again. Explanation- not once more. It was a first and last something I didn't need. I won't apologize. I won't accept your lies. I don't give a fuck (about) how much you need. I will have it my way, or I won't have it at all. I would piss on your grave- and I'll laugh when you fall. I've got my own life, I've got my own gripes, I don't really give a fuck about your pain. You are my enemy- you are my blasphemy I would rather kill you than hear you complain. I'd pour salt in your wounds, the pleasure it would bring. Get it through your thick skull, I don't owe you a thing. When will you fucking realize that I don't owe you a thing. When will you just fucking understand that I don't owe you a thing.
