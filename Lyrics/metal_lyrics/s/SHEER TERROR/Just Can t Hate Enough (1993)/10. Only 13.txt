I once knew a girl, she had the mind of a child. Now I hear them saying; "Hey, that girl is wild." I had to see it myself before I believe what I heard And when I did my jaw hit the floor, And I couldn't speak a word. She goes out on the weekends and she pops her V's and ludes. She's only thirteen years old and she's in her mother's shoes. She's a Friday night dream and a Saturday night scream. From Barbie dolls to tuinols, a vision so obscene. I know you. You know me. What did they do? You're only thirteen. Memories aren't worth the tears she may cry. Emotions are only little extras that she may buy to feel for such a soul would be an unfunny joke. To think that she was the girl next door, It makes me choke.
