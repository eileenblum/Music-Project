As you poured your heart out, I poured myself another drink. Too calous to give a damn, too callous to even think. You felt electricity, I only felt a draft. Your cried when the hero died, I couldn't help but laugh. And Lulu Roman sang of Jesus and the Lord, you felt the whole thing "too bizzare", I was only bored. Now you're talking birthstones, I'm thinking headstones. Anything just to agree, "would you go to bed with me?". Tell me what you want to hear, I'll tell you what you know. I found my soul, but lost my heart many years ago. 'You wanna see me angry? Do you wanna see me cry? Just so you can tell your friends that I'm a helluva guy? And Lulu Roman sang of Jesus and the Lord. You felt the whole thing "too bizzare", I was only bored. I'm looking for an ashtray, you're looking for your shoes. We started off with so much to gain, but even more to lose. You wanna make some coffee, I wish that you'd make tracks. We both had good intentions, but they just fell between the cracks. And in the morning, when you remember me, you'll hate me as you did before this ever came to be. And Lulu Roman sang of Jesus and the Lord. You felt the whole thing "too bizzare", I was only bored.
