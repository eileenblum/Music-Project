Come along baby, and take a little trip, to where the world stops spinning at the slip of a lip. It's where the angels fear to tread, and devils drop dead. It's just around the corner, and upside your head. It's where I'm bound to have a good time, and it's where I'm bound to blow your mind. It's always good fun when it first begins, but it's always big tears when it finally ends. I'll show you where I rest my tired old bones, and "blow angel trumpets and devil trombones". Howlin' at the moon like an ol' bulldo, or sniffin' 'round the bayou like an ol' wart hog. It's where I'm bound to have a good time, and it's where I'm bound to blow your mind. It's always good fun when it first begins, but it's always big tears when it finally ends. Tumblin' down - let me throw you up against the wall. Tumblin' down - you hurt me, baby, no watch me fall. Tumblin' down - you lose your face, you lose your place, you can't help from wondering... "What went wrong?". It wasn't supposed to be this way. Tumblin' down. I thought things would get better. Tumblin' down. We've all had such high hopes for you. Tumblin' down. I coulda been a contender....
