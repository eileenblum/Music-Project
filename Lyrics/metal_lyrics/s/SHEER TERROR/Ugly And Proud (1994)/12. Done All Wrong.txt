If it's over, then leave it at that. Don't tell me that I might stand a chance at something that I've held on to for so long, and you easily throw away. I feel no shame for myself, of the things that I've done. But you, you're the one that makes me feel like I've done it all wrong. Don't look at me with those eyes. You can't make me feel any worse than I do right now. If I break down, it won't be the first, and if I break down it won't make you stay, and when I break down...... when I break down please just go away. I feel no shame for myself, or the things that I've done. But you, you're the one that makes me feel like I've done it all wrong. I don't want you're sympathy. Don't you fucking dare to patronize me. How could I want to be your friend, when you've raped me of my dignity? I don't know how much it meant to you, but it meant the fucking world to me. Once I bore the thorns of guilt, now I drive the nails of spite.
