Now you're thinking that I'm cracked, but how's a man to react? Something that I thought was real, was something you could never feel. Anxiously I paced the floor, and you walked out the fucking door. I begged, I pleaded, I even cried. You cheated me, you fucking lied. HOW LONG DID YOU STRING ME ALONG? HOW LONG DID YOU PLAN ON KEEPING THIS FROM ME? WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU WAITING FOR? AN INVITATION TO MY PRIVATE WAR? Your family think's it's best for the best - pull the plug, put me to rest. You've got the world supporting you, is that the best that you can do? You show concern about my health, your only worry is yourself. Pound my fists into your car, we've taken this a bit too far. WELL THAT WAS THEN, AND THIS IS NOW. HOW CAN YOU BEAR TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF? HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW THAT YOU'VE KILLED A MAN LONG BEFORE HIS TIME? OF THIS YOUR ARE GUILTY, AND THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT TO FIT THIS CRIME. OUT OF VENGEANCE I TELL THE WORLD WHAT YOU TOOK FROM ME. IT DOESN'T MAKE ME HAPPY, BUT AT LEAST IT SETS ME FREE. Everything's been said and done the battles over, just, who won? I could never wish you all the best, you're the one I now detest. This is the final chapter of this story, relics of a faded glory, I only hope and pray, one day, someone deals you out this way. THERE, I'VE SAID IT AT LAST. WHATEVER'S PAST IS PAST. YOU'RE ONLY A LOUSY MEMORY, AND MEMORIES DON'T MEAN A FUCKING THING TO ME.
