When your only defense is an expense or taken to task by the fools at hand. What price would you pay the piper? You struck up the band, so you gotta dance. Who's eyes do you see the world through? Which book do you consider as good? Are you ready to die for your country? Or die trying in your own neighborhood? Sin - Of Pride. The sin of pride is a heavy fee. Sin of Pride. Become a slave to what's keeping you free. Sin of Pride. Take back what you've been denied. Sin of Pride. I'm no talking creed or race, it's not an issue that I'd planned to attack. And I'm not trying to rationalize between a handshake and a knife in the back. If pride is a sin, then none of us win. Black and white, gentile and jew. Purge yourself in the flames of "right". The sin of pride, what's it done for you?
