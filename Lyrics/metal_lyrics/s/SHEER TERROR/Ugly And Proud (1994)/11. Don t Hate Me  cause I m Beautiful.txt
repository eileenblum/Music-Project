Silence is golden, but I'm gonna scream and shout. Wallow in the muck and mire like a howlin' drunken lout. Make room for daddy boy, poppa's got a brand new kick. Fly the flag and toss the shit. Some of it's just gotta stick. It don't matter what ya like, pack your shit and take a hike! Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful, but hate me all the more. Standing soaked in angels' piss, I drink the blood of your false gods. Maybe I will burn down in hell, but I'll be damned if you're not. You've ruined all the good times with your swiss cheese philosophies. Go and fuck your priests and temples, and I'll do just what I please. And if I've hurt your pompous pride, we can take this all outside. I ain't trying to be no tough guy, but I ain't no faggot altar boy. Take your cults and politics and stick 'em up your big fat ass. If I wanted to get religion, hell I woulda gone to sunday mass. DON'T HATE ME 'CAUSE I'M BEAUTIFUL, BUT HATE ME ALL THE MORE. I THOUGHT PUNK WAS GOOD TIME JUNK, NOT THE SEEDS OF HOLY WAR. YOU GET MY GOAT WHEN YOU WANT MY VOTE FOR SOME DUMB HICK STRAIGHT OFF THE BOAT, GOIN' FAR OFF ABOUT KARL OR ADOLF OR FARRAKAHN'S NEW KU KLUX KLAN.
