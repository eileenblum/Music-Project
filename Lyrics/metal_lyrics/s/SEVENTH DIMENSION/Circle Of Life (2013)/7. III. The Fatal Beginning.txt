Every living creation will reach a point
Where theyâll be introduced to the night
After living on the edge of paradise
The night will fall down and create
An unfamiliar and chocking change in life
Things can change in a way
You would never desire
It will leave a boy paralyzed
By the chock of finding his world upside down

("The night fell down")
("And the mirror revealed")
("Its true reflection")
("Then suddenly")
("Two horrifying sounds")
("Screaming, shooting")
("Blackened")

The mirrors dirt is vanished
Paradise is turning to hell
The sun goes down (First wave of)
Darkness has arrived
A new reflection
Revealed the evil surrounding me
How could this be?
What did I do wrong?

Is hope consumed?
How could this be?
How could this tragedy
Fall upon me?
By the thunder outside
I wake up in the night
To witness another
Dramatic scene

Why?
Help me understand
Why did this
Beautiful chapter in my life
Run out of hand?
How?
Could this perfect world
How could it turn all around?
Now where shall I go?

I feel lost in myself
I have to deal with this pain
I'm forced to fill my life with fear
I try to save the past in vain
Running away from a tragic memory
With nothing more to gain
After years in paradise
The evil has locked me in chains

And I run
And I never stop
But I'm blind
In this evil game

No
Get away from me
There's memories of beauty
Inside of me
No
I won't believe it no more
The mirror it lied
Reflection denied

Why?
Help me understand
Why did this
Beautiful chapter in my life
Run out of hand
How?
Could this perfect world
How could it turn all around?
Now where shall I go?

Run out of hand?
Don't
Don't try to take me back
I don't want to be a part
Of this world full of lies
