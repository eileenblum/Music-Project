As the first sun rises
To celebrate the joy of birth
A boy is born and begins his walk
Through the endless circle
Starting on the bright side of the symbol
He experiences the will to live
And born to loving parents
That would love him forever
He feels safe in his personal paradise
The only side of life that he knows

***

I've awakened, I'm alive
I can finally see the light
The vanished darkness and
Their smiles so bright
I've awaited, I've arrived
To my first paradise
That I'm living in advance

I'm guided away
To the land where I belong
I'm taken to a house
To a new dawn

I open my eyes and wake up
From a dream reflecting reality
This constant feeling
Of immortality
Running down the stairs
Without any fear
What should I fear
When love stands beside me?

A perfect life
High in this sky
I know I can fly
In this ethereal sky

A perfect life
High in this sky
I know I can fly
In this ethereal sky

And everything seems
Will last forever
This perfect life
Will it remain?
