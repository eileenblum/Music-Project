There was no time to think
Alternative solutions
The sound of emptiness
Runs through my head
There is no time to cry out
My inner delusions
No more excuses with
You to share

I hear the cries
The silent emptiness
Behind my eyes
Tears me apart again
I feel the ice
Melting apart as I
Stand right here
Beyond what I believed

A dream out on the ocean
Reflecting on the past
Forgiveness in the future
Time wonât last
Until the leaves have fallen
Weâll forget their pain
Time will make you crawling
Back to your past

There is a place
Where self-pity is vanished
A place located
Far beyond the time
The only reason for
This inner fear to rise up
Is when you expect that
Everything must end

I hear the lies
The empty words you hide
Behind those eyes
Tears you apart again
You fear the time
When it arrives
What will you do?
What will you do?

A dream out on the ocean
Reflecting on the past
Forgiveness in the future
Time wonât last
Until the leaves have fallen
Weâll forget their pain
Time will make you crawling
Back to your past

A dream out on the ocean
Reflecting on the past
Forgiveness in the future
Time wonât last
Now the leaves have fallen
And now you feel their pain
Time now made you crawling
Back to your past
