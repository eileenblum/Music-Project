When the light reaches
The dawn of a new birth
A dark and empty place will shine
'Cause of a miracle
Of existence called "life"
But the life of a boy
Would already be decided
Even though the events of his life
Will never be foretold
He will be given the same symbol of life
The eight through day and night
Just like everybody else
