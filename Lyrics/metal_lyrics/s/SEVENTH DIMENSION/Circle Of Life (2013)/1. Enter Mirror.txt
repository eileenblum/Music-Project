(âReflecting on our fearsâ)
(âReflecting on our fearsâ)

This shattered dust reveals a mist
A reflection of your fear
Cursing this very day
When your shadows learned to emerge
Denying too much failure
Regret forever more
Instead of leave behind
Instead of carry on
A corruption of your mind

A trembling phobia
Afraid of what is wrong and right
Always easier to run
From your withering mind
Expecting all to understand
The choices that youâve done
Instead of killing thoughts
Using human willâs gun

We'll contain shards of evil
And thoughts of pain
Is this freedom
The goal you want to attain?
Afraid to cast it away
We'll receive shards of hatred
Passed by our fears
Powerful enough
To break both you and me
Afraid to cast them away
You enter the mirror

(âWe all have some evil insideâ)

(Its rise) Surprising
(The fear of) Leaving it
Wanting nothing but
Freedom from regret
(The darker thoughts) Fading out
(When you) Believe in
The power to banish it all
âBut what if Iâm to weak?â
âWhat if it keeps control?â
Then go and let it
Bring sin to your soul

A misleading phobia
Afraid of what is wrong and right
Always easier to run
Instead of losing the fight
Expecting all to accept
These choices that youâve done
âI try to kill these thoughtsâ
âPlease, just make them be goneâ

Cries avoided, when you feel
Them to depend on you
To dry them
Is a choice way to cruel
But inside, the wish to
Abandon who you're now
Try it once for all
And fight it back to the grave

(âIt's feeded by our fearsâ)

We'll contain shards of evil
And thoughts of pain
Is this freedom
The goal you want to attain?
Afraid to cast it away
We'll receive shards of hatred
Passed by our fears
Powerful enough
To break both you and me
Afraid to cast them away
You enter the mirror
You go, enter the mirror
