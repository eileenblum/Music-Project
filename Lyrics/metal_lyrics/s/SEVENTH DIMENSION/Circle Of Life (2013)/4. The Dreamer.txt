It's been decades since I lost you
Every nights repeated pain
I was told there was a way
To reunite with you again
A mysterious solution
To fall in dreams without awakes
Into a place where I could find you
A place where you could grab my hand

Take and guide me away
To the land of my dreams
I will dare to take
This last chance to see her again
I will fade to the notes
Away from this life
An empty cold time
Play me the song, make me fall
Into a reflection of my dream

Black fades to white
All alone, among all light
But then, from the white mist she came
The only one I longed to see again
Touched by her hand
On my face, staring blind
Through her eyes I could see
A lost soul now staring back at me

Now help me remain
In the land of my dreams
I'll dare to throw away
My life sacrificed
I faded to the notes
Away from that life
That empty cold time
Playing the song made me fall
Into a reflection of my dream

Asking for no guidance
Of how to come back home
This dream taken for granted
My life forever gone
But the circle kept on spinning
And the dream became a curse
Her spirit now standing by
This corrupted lullaby

Take and guide me away
From the land of my dreams
I can now understand
What I have done wrong
I won't fade to the notes
Away from that life, my reality
Playing that song nevermore
Take me away from this black dream
