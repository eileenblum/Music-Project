After a long time passed
Within the circle of reflection
A man realizes the system of life
The picture of the circle of life
Receives the final missing piece
Brought by a mans belief in hope
The decision of believing
In that familiar voice
Finally brings the full picture
After years passed in emptiness

***

The voice under the moonlight
Now made me realize
The fear is slowly fading
And the hope is on the rise
Years after years, I tried to let go
Those memories of the past
But all those things, both good and bad
Those times will always last

Into the eight
The mark of eternity
We're all running
So endlessly
A turn beside the night
A turn beside the day
Until we all start drifting
Until it's time for us to fade

Our perfect lives
And all of our cries
Are sides of a dice
In this circle of life

I've witnessed both the two sides
The hell and paradise
I thought that it was possible
To never pay a price
Inside that house where I grew up
Both love and evil passed
But that's all part of this strange life
Where time flows too fast

Into the eight
The mark of eternity
We're all running
So endlessly
A turn beside the night
A turn beside the day
Until we all start drifting
Until it's time for us to fade

Our perfect lives
And all of our cries
Are sides of a dice
In this circle of life

In the past
I wanted to believe
That all good in my life
Would last forever
But today
I've finally realized
That the circle of life
Runs through both day and night

The power we need
The only thing we need
Is only to believe
That everything will be fine
The will to live
The will to love
Its magic, it is true
And even though
The sky seems gray
You'll see, it soon will turn blue
'Cause everything you need
Everything you'll ever need
Is only to believe
In this circle of life
Believe
