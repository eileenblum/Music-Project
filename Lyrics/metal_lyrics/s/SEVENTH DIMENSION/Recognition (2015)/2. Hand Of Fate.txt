Waiting for a calling to me
Which path am I destined to take?
Or could this be all?
One is born
"What's there for me?"
Don't let emptiness stand in your way
It's a brand new day soon

I promise you, my friend
Inside this maze
We'll find our way
Because this time's been given
To breed our hope
Our meaning of life

Hand of fate
Come guide me away
To what I do need
To fill my life with meaning
Find the key
For then you will see
That there's hope for all
We all have a reason to live

Even though the sand is running
Through the hourglass of time 
Don't let the time daunt you
This day is yours to enjoy
Despite the gray confusion
That you might bear inside
The time will come for you too
To find where you belong

Rise, morning sun
Make me discover my path
Look up the reasons
For me to move on
Guide me, my...

Hand of fate
Come guide me away
To what I do need
To fill my life with meaning
Find the key
For then you will see
That there's hope for all
We all have a reason to live

We may spend our lifetimes
Searching for what gives us hope
Just don't crave for more and more
(More and more)
For this life is way too
Short to spend on feeling remorse
Trust the hand of fate
To guide you home
