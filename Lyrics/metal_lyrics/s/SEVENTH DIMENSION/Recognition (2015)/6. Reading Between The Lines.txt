With lack of knowledge
We seem to look away
An issue here to stay
New troubles showing
Never to repeal
It emphasizes the reason
We must comprehend

It's not a trial
Forever has been for real
It's time for us to heed
Procrastinating our very final goal
A bad behaviour and no control

Hear the crying whale
As we wash all the seas away
Overriding bio waste
Now wither away

A cursed continuum
We keep forgetting we're in
A structure made by man
Oil-painted oceans
That needs a helping hand
Approaching the darkest of times

Hear us
We have to stop this idiocracy
Reading between the lines so we can't see it
Help us
We need to return to how it used to be
Reading between the lines as we conceive
We need to change

Status quo
The maintenance of mankind's nature crust
Crumbles to dust
("What will happen to the nutrition and our crops?")
The recipe of disaster is
Made through manufactures of lust
("So how will we escape the rising waters?")

Evidence have shown the turning point
By failure of laws and bold treat
("But what about the maladies afflicting our nations?")
Should we fear the only path we haven't tried so far?
We need to defeat
("And what about the devastating impact upon the ecosystem?")

See the pollutions blast
They will stay put
Since we don't
Give a damn

And till the very last
Forest burns
It'll define our essence
As Earth hardly can breathe anymore

Hear us
We can figure out how to end this
Reading between the lines so we can't see it
Help us
Remove our blindfold, let's open our eyes
Reading between the lines as we conceive
We need to change
