The end of days
Renders my thoughts
Engulfed in fright
A restless mind
Will rest in this cave tonight
So much concern
To fall asleep and wake again
Not as myself
No longer as a friend

The innocence is clear
As I see myself through these eyes
But behind this mask of fear
I fear that it is time

The rage of unconsciousness
Is flowing through my veins
Such a clean and deserted mind
Getting filled with desires of hate
This mystery of running free
While in a state of sleep
Please, someone wake me up
And help me to break free

I can no longer hold this shame inside
I don't want to be the one
Lift this burden of mine
'Cause this man of hate
Is the progeny of my fate

Here I am, all split up
Two minds sharing a grail
Bringing death but to each other
Desperate mind, make this ghost
Vanish from my soul
I can't live within two minds

As my will attempts to break
Through nature's force
Seeing life from the other side
With a bitter taste of remorse
A living dead is how I feel
Inside this shell of shame
This cell, sealing my peace of mind
This innocence I claim

I can no longer hold this pain inside
I don't want to be the one
Lift this burden of mine
'Cause this man of hate
Is the offspring of my fate

Here I am, all split up
Two minds sharing a grail
Bringing death but to each other
Desperate mind, make this ghost
Vanish from my soul
I can't live within two minds
