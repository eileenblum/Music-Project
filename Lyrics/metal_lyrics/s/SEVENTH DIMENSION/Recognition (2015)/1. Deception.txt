Swallow the shame and guilt kept inside
Leave the senses that burns you alive
A special retreatment we can't figure out
This false impulse will send you down
Conflict in manner of faked expressions
Behold this loop of continued impressions
Renew the outcome in words you relate
With a risk of higher heart rhythm and rate

Letting you to be the one
(That you always want them to see)
Automatic lying machine
(That you always want to believe in)
A systematic shallow deceive
(That you always want to achieve)
In your hands to fully succeed
(That you've now created)
(To fulfill your desired needs)

(Sinking) Sinking lower
(Control) Can't control it
(Slower) Thinking slower
(Tonight) Tonight
This infection
Deception
Puts your life in decline

Talking the talk
Won't stop for anything
Inside your mind
Lies will disguise it
Deciding to
Interfere what's real
Your heat momentum
(Momentum)
It condemns you
(Condemns you)

Some mystical you
Fuels the riddles
Twisting reality
Seems to fit in
All mystical through
Unknown falsehood
Revile and pain
Defined in your name

You're wanting us to believe
(Remembering it's just fantasy)
Inspire the rest to deceit
(Cause a better sense to live in)
From your words to our doubting ears
(A final try to appear)
Losing bonds due to fake reveals
(All the way from joy and)
(Happiness you failed to give)

(Sinking) Sinking lower
(Control) Can't control it
(Slower) Thinking slower
(Tonight) Tonight
This infection
Deception
Puts your life in decline
Decline

"To fool us you must fool yourself first
How can you possibly believe in yourself?
Somewhere deep inside you must feel regret
Someday you must get really tired of digging your own downfall
Keep telling yourself your imaginations are real
And you'll end up losing it all
Before you're ready to cut your make-belief
Prepare for a decline
Deception is on the line"

(Sinking) Sinking lower
(Control) Can't control it
(Slower) Thinking slower
(Tonight) Tonight
This infection
Deception
Puts your life in decline

(Fading) Senses fading
(Control) Can't control them
(Illusion) An illusion
(Nightmare) A nightmare
This perception
Deception
It's fake
You're living a lie
