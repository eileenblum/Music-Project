(Come back to me)
The whispers of dreams
Splattered out right in front of me
Transcended to memory of you
A light struck down
To bring hope again
To bring me some hope again

Twisted shapelessness
Shadowing down on me
From my pitch blackened love
Trying my best
To bring you back to life again
Here with me

Whenever to go
Where to look
Where to find
Where to hide

And where to start
And what to defend
I've always been told to
Never quit until I really understand

Imagination, a cult of sorrow
From when I face the sky
Deciphering you
See, forever see
Is the only option
Left for me

Whenever to go
Where to look
Where to find
Where to hide

And where to start
And what to defend
It's just so easy to
Pretend to accept the past

Subconscious internal seal
Renders from fiction to real
The wind is changing
Abstract visions come true
Will remain a secret
In memory of you

This finally made me see
How fate and hope can reveal
Minds that are concealed
Inside their own atmosphere
I'll do what's best for me
On my way out from here

Surreal patterns has taken me here
The path that took me away
From my atmosphere
I'll do the rest, oh
Things to be said and done
Life has begun
