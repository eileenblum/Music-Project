When the guilt brings you alive
But the pain seems to remain
Will the light of luck arrive?
Or will it stay the same?
Now the hourglass is turning
And the leaves falls down to
The ground around you
But the pride won't give in
As the tide is turning
Your mind keeps burning
On and on it will

Go
Mirrors turning on

Demons of lust unlocks the gate
Brings forth seeds of pain and hate
The blind judgment that you do
Leaves nothing but despair in you
Unless we're all willing to change
We shall prepare for a fall
If we never cross that path
We'll never learn to fall

The answers circling around 
There are so many questions to make
This consciousness I have found
Is scaring me
Help me demon
Save my pride from leaving
I refuse considering
That I may have been wrong
All the children crying
More people dying
As the hate keeps growing
On and on it will

Go
Mirrors turning on

Demons of lust unlocks the gate
Brings forth seeds of pain and hate
The blind judgment that you do
Leaves nothing but despair in you
Unless we're all willing to change
We shall prepare for a fall
If we never cross that path
We'll never learn to fall
Off the edge

Facing the truth
Hard reality
Tell me, angel
Tell me what you see
On the other side of the wall
I need to know
What could draw me there
Will I dare to go through a change?
Turning the mirror

No more
Facing me at last
Equinox, help me
Keep us from falling
