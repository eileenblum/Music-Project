Can't see a thing
Upon the hill
The fog is perfectly still
Wind blows outside
It creeps up behind
The feeling that
Someone's inside

Oh, mercy
Let me be
Insanity
Is daunting me

Sounds start to fade
Thunder decay
I am fading away
Anguish, despair
I am afraid that darkness
Is here to capture me

Oh, mercy
Let me be
Insanity
Is haunting me

The waiting is here
It's scaring me
That's all that there is to fear
Embracing me
The closure is near

This disquiet is my common thief
I still don't know what to do
When it's here for me
I can change
Just let me try to break free
Wasted all my years
What will happen to me?

Right in front of me
I see this white cold gleam
I finally see
This is what it seems

Oh, mercy
Let me be
Insanity
Is frightening me

The waiting is here
It's scaring me
That's all that there is to fear
(The waiting is here)
Embracing me
The closure is near

"I wish I should have lived my life true to myself, not the life others expected of me
I wish I didn't work so hard
I wish I'd had the courage to express my emotions and feelings
I wish I had stayed close to my friends
I wish that I had let myself be happier, that I for once cared for myself
I wish I had fulfilled all my opportunities I came across
I wish I never should have taken my family for granted
I wish this won't hurt"

Mortality
Is killing me
Death scenery
Soon sent to eternity

The waiting is here
It's scaring me
That's all that there is to fear
(The waiting is here)
Embracing me
The ending draws near

One last falling tear
Blinding me
It's blurring in front of me
(I wasted my years)
Now facing me
The Raven is here
