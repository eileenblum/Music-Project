[The Dreamer:]
I've arrived at a green flowery field
Stretching as far as I can see
I know that this is only a dream
But everything seems so real

The grass softly
Waves along with the hot breeze
It pushes me onward to the blue horizon
I walk down the hills blooming with oxeyes
Each step guided by the wind

Blinded by light, I hear a calling
Then appearing before me
My one, my dearest Rose

With arms wide open
I embrace you with love
My wish came true
Now I'm not leaving you
Many years have passed
But don't let it deceive
I simply won't let you go

[The Rose:]
I knew that you would find me again
Been waiting for so long
Heart's racing as you're holding my hand
The first time since the leaves of fall

[The Dreamer and Rose:]
I simply can't believe
That you're here with me
Once again by my side
Ineffable love of mine

With arms wide open
I embrace you with love
My wish came true
Now I'm not leaving you
Love brought back again
No, I'm not letting go
We will remain you and me

Our love from the past
In harmony once again
