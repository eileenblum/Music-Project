[The Dreamer:]
My senses may seem feeble
But my passion is so strong
Willing to let go of my past
Letting go of everything
Disconnecting

Some distant rumbling can be heard
My life is to be split in two
My feet are numb and I can't move
I do this for us
Take my hand
Oh, please take it
(Please, Rose)

How can this be?
This world is now falling down on me
Help me, please
I need to stay here with you
How can this be?
I am trapped within this dream you live
I'm disconnecting from reality

Is this worth to die for?
Life turned upside down
The more I think about it
The more concerned I get

Is this worth to live for?
Can't seem to retract
Nothing to turn back to
Nowhere to return

How can this be?
This world has forsaken you and me
Help me, please
I need to stay here with you
How can this be?
Her lost soul is staring right at me
You're the only one I need
You are the only one I need
