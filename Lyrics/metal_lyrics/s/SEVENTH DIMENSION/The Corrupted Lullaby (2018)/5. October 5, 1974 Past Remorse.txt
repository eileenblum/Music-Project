[October 5, 1974]

[The Dreamer:]
Yet another day will pass us
With rejoicing and with bliss
Filled with love up to the brim
Just like the days when we first met
This day is like any other
Filled with passion and such lust
Though our words clashed into each other
The flame went dim and swallowed us

Don't walk away
Let's settle this the right way
Don't walk away
Don't walk into the heavy rain

You are nowhere to be found
The darker clouds tumbles in
Seen within, oh
There is no time for these games
I know you are angry with me
Just get back home safe

Yes, I have done wrong
It's not just my fault
Am I to be blamed
That you might be long gone?
In this moment, feeling anguish
Where are you now?

Don't
Don't turn away from me
This isn't the time to give up on us
Please, show me now
You're still with me
And don't say goodbye
Don't leave me alone here
I won't sleep tonight until you get back
What, if something happens to you
Am I supposed to do?

Shedding tears like nothing else
This must be a dream of mine
No, this can't be real, oh
I let my fury control
My mind overrides in rage
I can't switch the page

I can't believe it
Though I have seen it
Knowing my faults gives
A darker meaning
No, if it wasn't for the fighting
You'd be alive

Don't
Don't turn away from me
Don't walk to the light
Show me mercy
Please, show me now
You're still with me
And don't say goodbye
Don't dare to give up now
Don't walk to the light
Show me signs of life
Then suddenly
Heart stopped beating
She left me behind

I won't go on
Not without you
How can I let go
Of the one I love?
