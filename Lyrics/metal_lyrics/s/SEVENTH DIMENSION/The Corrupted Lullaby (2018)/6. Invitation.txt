[September 1989]

[The Dreamer:]
Darkened mind all the while
I'm here all by myself
I shout whatever comes to mind
Hear me cry for the while
My thoughts are all in overdrive
I'm too lost to be found now

In my reality
Self-loathing is what I feel the most
Self-pity and anger will keep haunting me
A man is drawing near
He claims to know what I've been through
He claims to know a way to set me free

A land where I can be free
(The man I used to be)
Invitation, invitation
A key to unlock my dreams
(It's worth taking the risk)
Invitation, invitation
A new era draws near
(To the man I used to be)
Invitation, invitation
A gift to unlock my dreams
(A new world to be seen)
Guide me to the land of my dreams

This gift may be able to reanimate
The one that I held so dearly and so sound
A man to enable my dreams to come true
Thus some things will never be the same again

A land where I can be free
(The man I used to be)
Invitation, invitation
A key to unlock my dreams
(It's worth taking the risk)
Invitation, invitation
A second thought to reveal
(What really matters to me)
Invitation, invitation
A song would fade me to dream
(A place where Rose would appear)
A reflection of my dream
