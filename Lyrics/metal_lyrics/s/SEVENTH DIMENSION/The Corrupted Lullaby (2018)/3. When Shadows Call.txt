[The Dreamer:]
Misty morning unveils my despair
Exposed in an open bed
Unknowing of what I will do
Unwilling too
Memories, they inhabit me
Persisting pain every day
I'm waiting for the storm to come
Will I dare to go?

Just one last attempt
To seal me away
To be gazed upon nevermore
But then, light suddenly fills the room
A calling out for me

Light
Shivering right through me
A piece that died just came back to me now
Speak
The voice I want to hear
Is there a chance to reunite?

I won't let go
If I hold your hand one more time
I won't let go even for one night
When shadows call
I will know you're still around

Questions arise
Is there a way to find you?
So where do I begin?
Is this even real?
My living state
Might be the hindering reason
Do I dare to give in?
I won't return

What if I'm wrong?
What if you're unreal?
I can't risk to end it all
There are ways to be found

Light
Shivering right through me
A piece that died just came back to me now
Speak
The voice I want to hear
Is there a chance to reunite?

I won't let go
If I hold your hand one more time
I won't let go even for one night
When shadows call for me

[The Rose:]
You will find a path leading here
Our place to unite
A remedy to our pain
Just you and me and nothing else
Immortal divinity is the title of our story
So now, take my hand
Find me

[The Dreamer:]
Do speak to me
I need some guidance
Though I will find you soon

Light
Shivering right through me
A piece that died just came back to me now
Speak
The voice I want to hear
I know that we can reunite

I won't let go
If I hold your hand one more time
I won't let go even for one night
I won't let go once I find you alive
I won't let go of you I adore
When shadows call for me
