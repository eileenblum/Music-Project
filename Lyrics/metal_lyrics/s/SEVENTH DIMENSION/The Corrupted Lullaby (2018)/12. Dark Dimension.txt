[The Dreamer:]
Here
Floating in the air
Inside this empty space
Staring into black
As I long to see her face
I'm calling out her name
An empty ghost
What's there to blame?
(Why?)

I, I reach out my hand
Through the white and shiny mist
That reflects her face
That's fading away
Another day has gone
But what happened to you?

Tell me, dear
Tell me why my hand falls through your face
And those eyes
Where I found love, now start to decay
All the time
I spent on dreaming being here with you
Tell me now
Why I'm falling through

Help
I can't find a way of healing this day
Make me stay here with you

As she drowns
In seas of sorrow, I hold my breath
Swimming to
Save the one I longed for my whole life
Getting near
I reach my hand as she fades away
One last kiss
Without detection, leading to tears

Save her now
God, curse this day
Tell me now
Why she fades away

Dark dimension raised from sorrow
In this once beautiful place
This place that made
Me unite with that lost life
Supposed to be a holy grail for me

This magical world
Transcending away
That eternal dream
Is darkened from light
Corrupt lullaby
You trapped me in this world
If I can just go back
I'll start over again

Lily
If I'm given one more chance
I will turn around
And tell her I was wrong
I am through regretting the past
Please, help me escape
From this corrupted lullaby

If I'd be given one more chance
I would turn around
And tell her I was wrong
I am through regretting the past
Please, help me escape
From this corrupted lullaby

Light
Fading grace
Allow me to escape
