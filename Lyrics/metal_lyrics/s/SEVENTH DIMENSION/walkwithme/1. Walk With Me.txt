Here I walk among the dust
Falling down from humans crust
Blood will cover the ancient lands
That now are fed by egos hand
The bodies fall, the children cry
But in this land all tears will dry
They'll grow up to carry it on
Until mankind is ready to fall

Who's responsible, who is to blame?
Swallowing shame, we're all the same
Stand and say that "We're to blame"
You will go down, it remains the same
A man will follow, gathers a group
Supposed to be salvations troup
Rebellion starts, voice of the law
But you will always draw the shortest straw

Walk with me and you will see
Life is not just you and me
Let's wash away these coloured stains
We could maybe change a mind
We could maybe change a heart
But everytime it's someone's fault

The human heart is dry again
Pumping blood just to be spilled
The guiltiness is just a friend
That will just support your will

Tell me what it means to be alive
But livin' it wrong
Tell me how it feels to hold the knife
But waiting to throw
Tell me how you mean you live life right
Without the regrets
Tell me you wouldn't be alive
If you would blame yourself

Walk with me and you will see
Life is not just you and me
Let's wash away these coloured stains
We could maybe change a mind
We could maybe change a heart
But it is always someone's fault

The human heart is dry again
Pumping blood just to be spilled
The guiltiness is just your friend
That will just support your will
What if tomorrow, we will fall
When the guilt will begin to call?
What if tomorrow, we will know
That regret's upon us all?
