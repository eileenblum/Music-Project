He looked retarded drunken hill billy
Something much darker lurked in Pig Farm Willy
Offering money and closing the deal
Skinning and grinding into sausage meal

Grinding the girls Pig Farm Willy
Grinding the girls Pig Farm Willy
Grinding the girls Pig Farm Willy

Ho's disappear from the streets but who cares
Our boy Willy is out honing his wares
Come to the party streetwalker or stripper
Little did they know they would wind up in the chipper

A video trial he rots in his cell
Public and jury wish him to hell
Plotting and scheming because someday he might
Walk free to continue his grinding delight

Do you think you can dig me up a date for Saturday Night
