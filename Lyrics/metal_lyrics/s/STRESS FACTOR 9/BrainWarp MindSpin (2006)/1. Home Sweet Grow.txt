A billion dollars a billion more
High pressure sodium that is what in store
Gold medal snowboard glaucoma Christ
Cambie and Hasting Street you know the price

Do the neighbours know
Home Sweet Grow
The DEA might know
Home Sweet Grow
Interpol must know
Home Sweet Grow

Foil on the window electric bills
Home depot potting soil you know the drill
British Columbia my industry
They bust the tunnel but they wont get me

Hundred tables plant for every pot
Fans and vents a very crafty plot
The lights are hot four hundred watts
A nightmare to the landlord the circuits start to fry
Accidental fire the neighbourhood gets high
