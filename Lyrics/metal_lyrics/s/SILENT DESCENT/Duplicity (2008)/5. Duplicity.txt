She asks to look at her, but only with her eyes,
Can I ask you a question? No.
Sitting there as if you don't already know,
You act on innocence though its obviously what you lack the most.
Untouched, "unbreached"... best described as perfect,
You offer everything just by looking at me.

I feel the vibes as the pulse runs through me,
It never was mine, it never was right.
I feel the bass in my veins like the blood running through me,
It excites yet offends me.
I can't put up with this much longer,
Feel your waist as the bass grows stronger.
Sifting through the lies, never was surprised,
Tangled in your eyes and unwinding the ties.

If this kills me then I have succeeded,
Pain is nothing new to me.
Dreaming of the skies now I believe in it,
Singing from duplicity.

Does the path soon come to a close?
Don't know where it began,
I feel the sand creep in beneath my feet,
Opening my eyes I clutch to the words:
Don't look back - don't look down.
