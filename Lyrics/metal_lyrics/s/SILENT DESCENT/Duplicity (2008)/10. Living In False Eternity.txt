I walk through my valley in ignorance,
The path I walk ever changing its direction,
From light to dark, from deep to heart;
I looked forward. Everything swirls and blurs,
A perfect blend between light and dark.
I see clearly up to one step forward,
And take paths winding.

Thoughts compelling me to move forward; I look back,
I see clearer for miles, but I've hardly moved.
Yet in reality I'm pushed towards the unknown,
Ghost of paths I should've taken.
I spy with my little eye something beginning with death.

Descending into silence,
The obsession is in us all.
You are the drug that inhales me,
Yet I live to watch you fall.

I walk forward now in the path of regret,
Seeing mirrors surrounding facing back.
Sun gleams on what should've been.
Flowers of past, withered and trampled upon;
My eyes comforted by something new,
A rose, the deepest red you could see or feel
I wonder how to approach.

Hundreds of paths of purity gleam in front of me,
I decipher whether to approach the idyllic.
As I walk the path turns brown, nothing seen before,
I set my hand upon the flower;
It changes colour making me feel like God.

My hands are bound in red
My hands are bound in red
All I see is green

I open my arms and it consumes me,
A new power rushes through my veins.
The strength in my chest has gone,
But everywhere else thrives.
