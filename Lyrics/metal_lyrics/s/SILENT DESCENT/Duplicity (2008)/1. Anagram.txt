I open the box and there's candlelight,
The snake holds on, but now I can fight.
Suffer, or let it go,
Then take it away, 'cause no one knows.

This is hurt,
The meaning of pain.
One chance,
No means to start again.
If everyone lives,
Nobody learns.
Nobody learns.

Once again I dream alone,
I stand here broke, departed.
I look at you and see myself,
The fire in your eyes.

Now I'm sleeping under pressure, I can't sleep.
Seeking through mess, you blame me.
If the fire goes away, I can't see.
Should have fucked the rest and you shouldn't blame me.

Now focus what I want to be,
Knowledge is power, I can't breathe.
Never find a way, stuck with the same name, same game,
And I'm nothing to me.

Once again I dream alone,
I stand here broke, departed.
I look at you and see myself,
The fire in your eyes.

And in my dream I'm on my knees,
I say to God this ain't what I wanted to be.
He turns and says to me:
Let live without your lies.
