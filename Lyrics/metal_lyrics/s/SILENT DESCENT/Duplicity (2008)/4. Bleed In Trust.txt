Bleeding in trust internally deep,
The trust that bleeds you results in the tears you weep.
Crying alone, blame it in good faith.
No one has the same amount of respect.

False gratification given, you know you are right,
You've beaten them away; you know you've won the fight.
The darkness around you is your newfound home,
Cold, dark, isolated, you wanted alone.

Vengeance burns in the mind; it's what you now seek,
Playing and tormenting, you want to put it to sleep.
Chances now come and you close the door,
With the seal of your "soul" and mark of a whore.

A glimmer of light you allow to shine through,
Change the rules, and respect something that's true?
But has also bled in trust, and not mine they seek,
Still not letting light through, eternally deep.

Ask no questions. Tell no lies.
Ignorance is bliss, were you ever surprised?
Examine and obsess, it all comes true,
Bleed the cunts like they did to you.
Fuck all you fuckers.
Fuck hypocrisy.
Fuck all these mirrors.
Fuck... Fuck it's me.
