I'm living in a dream world, where I achieve nothing
Push out my dreams into the real world and let me feel something!

What's worse, fear or laziness?
Break some boundaries because my brain can't handle this
They're speak, speak, speaking to me
Give me something stronger to help me sleep

Laying awake, laying awake
I'm trying to fight but it's taking its toll
Laying awake, laying awake
They're buying your body but they're selling your soul
Laying awake, laying awake
I drown my sorrows but they take control
Laying awake, laying awake
I'm trying to find it

So I listen to the voices! Voices!
And they won't let me sleep
And they're making all my choices! Choices!
Sitting behind my eyes as they speak
Voices! Voices!
And they won't let me sleep
They're making all my choices and decisions
Breaking promises I can't keep

What's worse, fear or jealousy?
Voices screaming as they get the best of me
I can't get through tomorrow when I'm stuck on today
The dreams I had turn to grey

Laying awake, laying awake
They're buying your body but they're selling your soul
Laying awake, laying awake
I'm trying to find it

So I listen to the voices! Voices!
And they won't let me sleep
And they're making all my choices! Choices!
Sitting behind my eyes as they speak
Voices! Voices!
And they won't let me sleep
They're making all my choices and decisions
Breaking promises I can't keep

I know I don't need you but I need to let you go
I know I need to, yes I need to, I need to let you go

Need to let youâ¦ go!
Thoughts are thickening
Veins are rippling, God it's crippling
I've been searching my soul and it's sickening
It's gotta make sense in my mind to feel fine

So I listen to the voices! Voices!
And they won't let me sleep
And they're making all my choices! Choices!
Sitting behind my eyes as they speak
Voices! Voices!
And they won't let me sleep
They're making all my choices and decisions
Breaking promises I can't keep
