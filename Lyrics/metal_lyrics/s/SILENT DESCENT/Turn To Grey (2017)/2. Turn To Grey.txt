Am I alive? Or have I expired?
Between sleep and consciousness
I'm sick of being tired

As the lights I see, bleed and turn to grey
Remember me for the noise I make
Don't let me fade, don't let me fade away

I'm the undesired son, I'm sorry mother
Thank you for the footsteps father
So proud of you my brother
There is a truth in sorrow, love is a liar
Staring at my ceiling all night long
I'm sick of being tired

As the lights I see, bleed and turn to grey
Remember me for the noise I make
Don't let me fade, don't let me fade away

I tilt my head back, I feel my heart beat
From lines on the mirror, my squeeze left for me
It takes all the bad then gives it all back
It feels like I'm drowning, it's harder to breathe

I tilt my head back, I feel my heart beat
From lines on the mirror, my squeeze left for me
It takes all the bad then gives it all back
It feels like I'm drowning, it's harder to breathe

I tilt my head back, I feel my heart beat
From lines on the mirror, my squeeze left for me
It takes all the bad then gives it all back
It feels like I'm drowning, it's harder to breathe

As the lights I see, bleed and turn to grey
Remember me for the noise I make
Don't let me fade, don't let me fade away
