Bitter sweetness one of life little luxuries, in skin and sweat
Though the craving is phenomenal, it's a pleasure that I'd regret

For the moment the pain is gone
Just for the moment she relieves me of my mind

'Cause she's my medicine
But I'm not the kind of guy to meet her mother when
I have kissed her with this mouth
Tastes sweet not innocent, but I'm not worth the time of day
Her daddy say to stay away, stay away, stay away from me

Another beverage, another blow to my resistance, she lets me in
Little angel wants a demon, so I'll drown this girl in sin

And for the moment that pain is gone
'Cause when she's under me she feels like she is mine

'Cause she's my medicine
But I'm not the kind of guy to meet her mother when
I have kissed her with this mouth
Tasting her innocence, but I'm not worth the time of day
Her friends say to stay away, stay away, stay away from me

She said what are you rebelling against?
What are you rebelling against?

She said what are you rebelling against?
What are you rebelling against?

What have you got?
What have you got?
What have you got?
What have you got?

'Cause she's my medicineâ¦

'Cause she's my medicine
But I'm not the kind of guy to meet her mother when
I have kissed her with this mouth
Tastes sweet not innocent, but I'm not worth the time of day
Her daddy say to stay away, stay away, stay away from me

She's my medicine
But I'm not the kind of guy to meet her mother when
I have kissed her with this mouth
Tasting her innocence, but I'm not worth the time of day
Her friends say to stay away, stay away, stay away from me
