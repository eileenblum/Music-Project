Sun gleams on what should've been
Lighting up sights I should've seen
Shouting back you can't hear me calling
Life has been spent watching you falling

And as I get older the embers getting always colder
Youth is forging boulders and climbing up upon my shoulders

I'm blind, can't somebody see, this light that's shining for me?
My verse I to thee bequeath, I'm just renting this air that I breathe

Memories in a cigarettes haze
See those dreams we used to chase
Further back the greener the grass is
Look at life through rose-tinted glasses

And as I get older the embers getting always colder
Youth is forging boulders and climbing up upon my shoulders

I'm blind, can't somebody see, this light that's shining for me?
My verse I to thee bequeath, I'm just renting this air that I breathe
