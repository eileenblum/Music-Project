People's roles, people's status
Selling their souls for minimum wages
Mock my goals my expectations
Yet they're lost, they're stuck, they're fucked
They're suffering, suffering, suffering
I bare my soul, I lose control
I'm suffering, suffering, suffering
And no it's never gonna stop!

Yeah! I can't hide it
Guess I'm a sinner not a lover
And I'm like yeah! But I like it
God damn I'm a bad motherfucker!

See the way they're staring at me
Sin and misery
Pain that pleases my soul
I'm indestructible though
And it's never gonna stop when I'm like

Yeah! I can't hide it
Guess I'm a sinner not a lover
And I'm like yeah! But I like it
God damn I'm a bad motherfucker!

And what you gonna do?

The life I lead is conductive to my health
It's in the blood I bleed and a burden to my wealth

The life I lead is conductive to my health
It's in the blood I bleed and a burden to my wealth

The life I lead is conductive to my health
It's in the blood I bleed and a burden to my wealth

The life I lead is conductive to my health
It's in the blood I bleedâ¦

Yeah! I can't hide it
Guess I'm a sinner not a lover
And I'm like yeah! But I like it
God damn I'm a bad motherfucker!

Yeah! I can't hide it
Guess I'm a sinner not a lover
And I'm like yeah! But I like it
God damn I'm a bad motherfucker!
