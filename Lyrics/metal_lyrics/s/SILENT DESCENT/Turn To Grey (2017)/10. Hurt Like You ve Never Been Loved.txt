Sun is lost!
Every night!

Sun is lost every night to darkness
Ebony skies conceal every noxious tryst

She sucks the life out of me, the devil's on her knees
She'll make you hurt like you've never been loved
Love like you're going to live forever

She sucks the life out of me, the devil's on her knees
She'll make you hurt like you've never been loved
Love like you're going to live forever

Sun is lost!
Every night!

Sun is lost every night to darkness
Ebony skies conceal every noxious tryst

She sucks the life out of me, the devil's on her knees
She'll make you hurt like you've never been loved
She'll make you hurt like you've never been loved
Hurt like you've never been loved
Hurt like you've never been loved
Hurt like you've never been loved

She sucks the life out of me, the devil's on her knees
She'll make you hurt like you've never been loved
Love like you're going to live forever

She sucks the life out of me, the devil's on her knees
She'll make you hurt
She'll make you hurtâ¦ just like me

She'll be the death of me
She'll be the death of me, I've come undone
God bless all her bastard sons
For we are those who won't repent
Led by the blind and arrogant
Pain just strengthens my resolve
This two-faced liar's getting old
Reaper watching with intent
Come forth and silence my descent
