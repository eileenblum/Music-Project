Old man sitting by the bar
Wondering where life went and where his memories are

Bar keep, I'm finished, pour me another Guinness
With God as my witness, I made this place what it is
A toast to the sinners and all life's anti-winners
The low-lifes, the drinkers
The rebels, the over-thinkers

Where the graves end
Where the graves end
Where the graves end
Take a bow, there's nothing I can do to stop this now
Where the graves end
Where the graves end
Now my life is turned upside down
I used to be somebody in this town

Drinking with his picture upon the wall
Not the man he once was, this old decrepit fool

Bar keep, I'm finished, pour me another Guinness
With God as my witness, I made this place what it is
A toast to the sinners and all life's anti-winners
The low-lifes, the drinkers
The rebels, the over-thinkers

Where the graves end
Where the graves end
Where the graves end
Take a bow
Where the graves end
Where the graves end
Now my life is turned upside down
I used to be somebody in this town

Scumbags in the alleys, rapscallions in the street
A ritual for a Saturday, our Wembley in Northfleet
There's devils in the darkness, not a moment I repent 'cause
This is my silent descent
