Under the eagle!

Breathe in, breathe deep
I'm no insomniac but I wish I could sleep
I've sinned, deceived
I'm no religious man but I wish I could believe in something better

This feeling I'm craving, my body it's breaking
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I am addicted, I'm addicted
This life that I've been chasing, not given, I'm taking
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I am addicted, I'm addicted

It seems this feeling isn't fading away
I still feel it burning inside of me
It's changing to grey, no breaking away from this

Nothing left to lose
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
Still rising and I'm still standing under the eagle
Nothing left to lose
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
Still grinding, God I'm still standing under the eagle

This fire, my 'cause
I am the weight that waits for my pause
No time to wait for the signs, preparing to fly gotta make this mine
Lighting up the dream machine
Breathing deep and hold it in
Duplicity, mind games
You're moving on I'm turning to grey
You're moving on I'm turning to grey

This feeling I'm craving, my body it's breaking
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I am addicted, I'm addicted
This life that I've been chasing, not given, I'm taking
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I am addicted, I'm addicted

It seems this feeling isn't fading away
I still feel it burning inside of me
It's changing to grey, no breaking away from this

Nothing left to lose
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
Still rising and I'm still standing under the eagle
Nothing left to lose
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
Still grinding, God I'm still standing under the eagle

Nothing left to lose
Nothing left to lose

This feeling I'm craving, my body it's breaking
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I am addicted, I'm addicted
This life that I've been chasing, not given, I'm taking
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I am addicted, I'm addicted

It seems this feeling isn't fading away
I still feel it burning inside of me
It's changing to grey, no breaking away from this

Nothing left to lose
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
Still rising and I'm still standing under the eagle
Nothing left to lose
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
Still grinding, God I'm still standing under the eagle
