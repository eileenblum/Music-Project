[feat. BjÃ¶rn Strid]All hands on deck, all hands on deck
She's about to take on water!
Mind the sails, mind the sails
Brace yourself!

Get on your knees and start to repent
This is a vortex, she is a vortex
This is my end

It's the calm before the storm
Poseidon rises through the fog
To take me

That bitter taste you leave that makes life harder to swallow
I know you were looking for something
I know you were looking for something
And you expect me to break but my bones are not hollow
I know I was looking for something
I know I was meant to be something more

This is my end, my silent descent
This is a vortex, she is a vortex
Get on your knees

It's the calm before the storm

That bitter taste you leave that makes life harder to swallow
I know you were looking for something
I know you were looking for something
And you expect me to break but my bones are not hollow
I know I was looking for something
I know I was meant to be something more

Harder to swallowâ¦
Meant to be something more!
My bones are not hollowâ¦

Get on your knees and start to repent
This is a vortex, she is a vortex
This is my end, my silent descent
This is a vortex, she is a vortex

This is a vortex, she is a vortex

I know I was looking for somethingâ¦ meant to be something more!

That bitter taste you leave that makes life harder to swallow
I know you were looking for something
I know you were looking for something
And you expect me to break but my bones are not hollow
I know I was looking for something
I know I was meant to be something more

Meant to be something more!
