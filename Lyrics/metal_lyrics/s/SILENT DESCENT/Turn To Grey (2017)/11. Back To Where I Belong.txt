Fading away, right back to where I belong
Savour today, tomorrow the money's gone
You know I made it? Singing all my songs I got so far
But now I've faded right back to where I belong

My back is breaking, my mind disintegrating
My soul is smothered by sin (smothered by sin)
Death is debating, devil is adjudicating
God knows the trouble I'm in (God knows the trouble I'm in)

Spare me some change so I can sedate myself
Spare me the same stories about my health
Time's never wasted when you're wasted all the time
Remember that one?
Back to where I belong

Fading away back to where I belong
Our soul resides back on those boundless songs

My back is breaking, my mind disintegrating
My soul is smothered by sin (smothered by sin)
Death is debating, devil is adjudicating
God knows the trouble I'm in (God knows the trouble I'm in)

You know I made it? Singing all my songs I got so far
But now I've faded, right back to where I belong
