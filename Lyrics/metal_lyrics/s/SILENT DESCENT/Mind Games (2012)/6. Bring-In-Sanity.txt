Confused, wrecked and doing what I do best,
Why do I always have something to obsess around?
Let too much past, too much within,
Open up to weakness and let people help themselves.
A fear of applying myself to anything that will push me,
Truth be told I'm nothing, I'm shit,
Just another fucking mug looking out for himself.
Reaching for the liquor - liquid courage is my pride,
Time is never wasted when you're wasted all the time.

I will never live a dream, never feel affection
Just in case the infection.
I hate so hard, I reduce my sanity to its knees.
Fuck living your dreams, fuck feeling afucktion?
Just in case the infection.
I hate so hard, I reduce my fucking sanity to its knees.

'Cause am I that shallow that I'd say anything,
Just to get her on her knees?
She'll get what's coming to her,
And make sure that she's my everything.
Then bring-in-sanity.

How can you ask for diamonds, when all you wear is pearls?
So cut up is my conscience, from filthy fucking girls!
A load off my mind is my load on your face,
Spitting was never an option.
Mind games is pain but my game's insane,
So open up wide and swallow my pride.

A pathetic excuse to reach for a dream!

It's sad but true but love to fuck,
And fuck the love, a fact of life.
