Malevolence neutralised by my tongue;
Knowing when to spit and when to lace my words.
The groups that flow and build in time, they shine,
Will I ever break the wall?
I walk upon my own,
I covet and lick the stars.

If you can't breathe in shallow water,
Why lay face down in the rain?
If you can't breathe in shallow water,
Why would you lay in the rain?

If in doubt, if in sight, if in time.
This is fact, this is free, is it mine?
Though I'd hate to take the pain of loss,
And what was not,
I'd love to taste your vanity.
And the cunt that seals success and all riches,
But I can't break the wall!
I walk upon my own,
I covet and lick the stars.

Open the Skies
