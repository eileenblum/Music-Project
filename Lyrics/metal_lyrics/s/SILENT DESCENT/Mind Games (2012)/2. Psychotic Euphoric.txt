If she said she loved she lied
Life's just porn with a story-line
And this is all that it's ever gonna be
As we play with words
With words
What it will say is not what it's gonna think
This curse of tongue's
We've all been jinxed.

Watch them come and go as they come and go
Youthful faces mindless eyes.
Watch them come and go as they come and go
Withered mouths that they'll dispise.
And when you thought you'd figured it out
The picture-perfect faces
That all the mind erases
But it was all inside your head.

A little bit of blood for a little bit of beef
A little broken half-heart incomplete.
Don't think it'll make a difference if you have a bit of fun
That's why pencils have erasers that's why god invented guns.
Couldn't resist the drama, couldn't resist the scene
Couldn't keep your motherfucking dick in your jeans.
As you looked into her eyes, her ass and her tits
I hope you tasted my fucking cum on her lips.

Why do we waste time
Falling in love
Don't waste time speaking
Cos you talk too much.
So let the drug burn till all effect are gone
Dreaming's better than living
Cos it makes me, yes, it makes me god.
