IÂ´m standing alone,
opaque walls around me
am I was never there?

Wash the continence of responsibility.

Move colour across the glass, intoxicate
break down the game
intentions turn to grey

Move colour across the glass, intoxicate
break down the game
intentions turn to grey

save me from myself
give me something to blame
consume to the point
I am not held accountable
it was not of me
if my thoughts were irrational
and so we play the game
give me something,something to blame!

Wash the conscience of responsibility
and IÂ´ll fit in with my own duplicity

Move colour across the glass, intoxicate
break down the game
intentions turn to grey

Move colour across the glass, intoxicate
break down the game
intentions turn to grey

Move colour across the glass, intoxicate
break down the game
intentions turn to grey

break down the game
intentions turn to grey
intentions turn to grey
