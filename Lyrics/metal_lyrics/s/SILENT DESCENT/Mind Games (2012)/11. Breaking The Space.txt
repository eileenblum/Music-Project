Eat. Defecate. Sleep. Procreate.  Fuck.

Metaphorical bricks that need climbing through,
And not flying that trip but preparing to.
But how long can you sit and wait, before it's too late,
Because I've seen it too late.
Shit!
Keep face 'til there's an intervention,
Keep face and push to get a mention.
The space that breaks inside and mesmerized.
It's ecstasy and then it will die.
It's ecstasy and then it dies.

Watching the sound
As it's lifted from the ground.
Surrounded by the objects that they've put in place.
Watching the sound,
It all comes crashing down.
Now you're creating the wall,
Breaking the space.
