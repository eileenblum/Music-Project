Last chance to make something of this,
Nothing is the same as it was before.
Don't believe in anything anymore, speaking for, sorry for, fucking whore!
With memories as good as a lie.
This is mine until it s over.
And I'll never, I'll never wake up!

Ceramic pillows on a pale floor,
Wasn't breaking the boundaries to get where I've been before.
Pick myself up from this hole I'm in,
Self induce the corruption or destruction of sober thoughts.

So breach? So weak. This slide enlightens me.
Nothing in life is free,
And I feel it falling from me.
This hoax, this light. I'm ashamed to call it mine.
Who believes in this shit anyway?
Tomorrow will never be today.

Engaged, eating away.
I won't let it win but I'll fuck it away!
The years erode,
And I thought I'd live forever.
Sit tight, hold onto your prize,
Next thing you know and it's gone.
Delay your senses 'til you don't know what is going on.
