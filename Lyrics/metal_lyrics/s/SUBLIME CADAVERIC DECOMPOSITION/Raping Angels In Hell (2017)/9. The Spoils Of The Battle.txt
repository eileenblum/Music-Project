All the livid steeds of the apocalypse
Cast humanity into the bottomless pit
Torrents of blood must overspread the earth
Dreams of battle and heroism spreading as a living organism

War-horses breed on the borders
It's write upon the sun in letters of fire
The sounds are in the air heard as they were voices
The psychopathic dreams of repressed wishes

The hallucinations evolves without being changed
Over the piled-up corpses the spoils of the battle
Destined for a crown of eternal glory
Look at the bare face of death and accept the abyss of inner loneliness

Dreams of battle and heroism spreading as a living organism
War-horses breed on the borders
It's write upon the sun in letters of fire
The sounds are in the air heard as they were voices
The psychopathic dreams of repressed wishes

Flags and streamers waved upon this charnel ground
Death had done its work

A world-empire subdue the world
And the soldiers spoke their word
The kingdoms rise and fall
The kingdoms rise and fall

The grass grows thick on the graves of the defeated
And no one holds the victor to account
The victor to account

In these fantasies of mass mortality
Life seemed banished
Nine grams in the back of their head
Birth is indebted to death
And nothing has importance
It mixed blood with all colours
Under the sword of the conqueror

A world-empire subdue the world
And the soldiers spoke their word
The kingdoms rise and fall
The kingdoms rise and fall

The grass grows thick on the graves of the defeated
And no one holds the victor to account
The victor to account

In these fantasies of mass mortality
Life seemed banished
Nine grams in the back of their head
Birth is indebted to death
And nothing has importance
It mixed blood with all colours
Under the sword of the conqueror
