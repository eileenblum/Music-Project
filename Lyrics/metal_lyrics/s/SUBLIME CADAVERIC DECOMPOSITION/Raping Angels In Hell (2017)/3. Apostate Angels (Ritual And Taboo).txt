Everywhere the ritual and taboo
Confronting the shadow maws
Hidden nature had left their traces
The skin was mottled

Red and white
The skin was mottled
Red and white

Unconscious fantasies completely revise
Our motions of what our poor bodies can endure
Rediscovery of lost primordial images
To penetrate the underside of life
And to bow to the common consensus of the traditions of primitive man
Just emerged from primate stage on the throne of the abomination

Red and white
The skin was mottled
Red and white

Everyone has his assigned role
No one had a choice
Two parts of the same whole
Victims as well as executioners
Body writhed, smuggled against each other

Skin against skin
The mask is stripped off
Slave of the one and master of all

Determine your emotional make-up
If you would say audibly all you had done in thought
But when the despotic prince ceases to uplift his arm
It is fear added to fear
The steps of the temple of virtue are flooded with blood

Perverse lusts of the apostate angels
Perverse lusts of the apostate angels

Everyone has his assigned role
No one had a choice
Two parts of the same whole
Victims as well as executioners
Body writhed, smuggled against each other

Skin against skin
The mask is stripped off
Slave of the one and master of all

Determine your emotional make-up
If you would say audibly all you had done in thought

Perverse lusts of the apostate angels
Perverse lusts of the apostate angels
