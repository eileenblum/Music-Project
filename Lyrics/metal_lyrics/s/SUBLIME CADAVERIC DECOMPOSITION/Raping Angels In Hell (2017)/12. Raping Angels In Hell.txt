The dancing master
Pursue his studies in hell
Each squad adopt the tribunal of the Inquisition

As naked
Champions
Smeared with
Slippery oil
Every diabolical group and sect
Sleep with Beelzebub

Breaking with a loud snap
The hasp of the chastity belts

To unfold the fresh leaves
With our powerful stems

Skin splits, blood pours
Pierced by our keen lances

Washing away the stains
They carried

Well-trained
In bodily exercise

The vile instructors
Of the seraphim

Swinging
In their hands

Their hunting-crops
Enlarges and grows red

While the cherubic packs

Swallowing in their jaws
The mouth of our guns

Spotted with trails of smoke

Then licking their chops
To catch every last drop

The groan from the victim
When the monarch opens fire without warning
The slime squirted
Into all
The bled dry orifices of their bodies

We don't fight by proxy
A legion of devils desire to sully

Gathered for the battle
Splashed with fresh blood

With the beast for witness
The task of raping angels in hell

Wallowed in infamy
We donât give a damn

The palpitating nymphs
Round their sire

Lapping up the wax
On the feet of the tyrant

Their everlasting
Eccentric tortures

The universal
Lubricious postures

The demons melted
Into the lambs of God

Martyrizing the pious
Wanking their emperor

Horned outcasts
Shall crown at last the bloom

The sexual assault
Of the holy platoons

The nephilim turned against the motions of the heaven

Spoiling virgins exposed, they break their wings and bones

Dwell content in fire, going on the war-path
In the first circle, that surrounds the abyss

The penitent maidens repelled with cum shots
To be marked on the forehead with our new sap
The baptism of semen of their imperial head
The beloved child faces for protection raised

Back to the inferno the command of the armies
Molesting the blessed, serving their majesty
The incubus promise, the hallowed demise
The myriads of birds of pain troubling the air with cries

Impel me where
The devil
In silence
Rests
