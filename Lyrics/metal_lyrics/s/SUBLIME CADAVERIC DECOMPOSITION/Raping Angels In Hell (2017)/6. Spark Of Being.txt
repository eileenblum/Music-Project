Creating a life
Infusing
A spark of being

Into the world as a
Self-inflicted wound

And feel the duties

Of a creator towards
His creature
This monstrous
Image of myself

You are now to me
Flesh of my flesh

I ardently
Wished to extinguish

That life
Which I had bestowed

I still prefer
Emptiness
And the sterility

Creating a life

A spark of being

Into the world as a

This image of myself

You are now to me
Flesh of my flesh

I ardently
Wished to extinguish

That life
Which I had bestowed

I still prefer
Emptiness
And the sterility

Unto my children
I will make amends
For being their father

And unto all the future
For this present-day

That insanely arrogant
Right to bring someone
In this slaughterhouse

The world is not progressing
But is twisted in pain
Everywhere
Finger on the trigger

There is no
Action of man
In this life that
Is not the beginning

Of an unpredictable
Chain of consequences

The crushing loss
Of cherished illusions
Through the contradiction
Of expectations
Of reality

There is no
Action of man
In this life that
Is not the beginning

Of an unpredictable
Chain of consequences

The crushing loss
Of cherished illusions
Through the contradiction
Of expectations
Of reality

Unto my children
I will make amends
For being their father

And unto all the future
For this present-day

That insanely arrogant
Right to bring someone
In this slaughterhouse

The world is not progressing
But is twisted in pain
Everywhere
Finger on the trigger

Not for the world
Not for heaven or hell
But to spare my offspring
