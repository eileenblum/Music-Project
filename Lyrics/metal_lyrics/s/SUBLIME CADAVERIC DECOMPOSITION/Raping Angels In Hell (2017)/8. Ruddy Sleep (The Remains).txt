Too messed up
To have a useful life
Medicalized selection
Has been asked for

Rendering the useless
Superfluous
The remains will be
Swept out
Of existence

Nothing ever dies
Except what is born
In the end
The only
Thing that counts

Is what was
And not what
Could have been

Caught in the trap of the mother's womb
Imprisoned in its dead cocoon
Inside this cage of skin and bone

Her whole body wanted to
Vomit this useless life

Caught in the trap of the mother's womb
Imprisoned in its dead cocoon
Inside this cage of skin and bone

Left at the gates of existence
Only entered
In order to leave it

The human species were not so precious

One had to preserve it down
To its last vile portion

It ain't no murder killing beast like that
Staying alive has to be earned
