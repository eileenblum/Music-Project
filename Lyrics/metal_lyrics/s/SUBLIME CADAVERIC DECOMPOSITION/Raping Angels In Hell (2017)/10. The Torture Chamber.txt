Once more

The prince who rule the world retrogressing
To cave-dweller times
Everywhere there is nothing
But torture and murders
Butchers take care of the butchering
Loose the illusion
Of a fucking millennium of peace
And once more

Each new day expecting things
Worse than the day before
The blood is flowing
And there is no end
To the mourning
You can never comprehend
The bounds of a human being

What millennium is it out of doors?
Dead the dead, out of sheer hatred for life

Could not it be even worse?
The stench from
The torture chamber

What millennium is it, out of doors?
The stench from
The torture chamber

By the implacable laws
Of warrior tribes

Earthly lords, as well as heavenly gods
In the midst of the dissecting room
Order the dreadful customs, and
Sadistic deviations

To assail the earth
Snatch it out of the universe
Make a general darkness

Turn this globe into a second sun
Set fire to the world
By celestial rays

Everything deserve to perish
Make a crystalline planet
Cleansed of all life

But let hell exists
It would be too unfair
If there were no
