At the last audit
Whence we draw
Our sum of guilt

In blood-red letters
In the purlieus
Of the deep

The forensic examine
That parts
That man conceals

And disembowel us
Until all the blood
Had drained
From the victim

Our entrails are spilled out of
Our leathern and bones

The silver sickle doing
The honors of the house

The skill of the doctors
When the curtain fell on the last act

The organic symphony stopped
On the scene of the crime

The scalpel scraping
Carve a furrow broad in our flesh

Marking the last signet
The medico-legal psalmody began

We said our last farewells
Our career is done

And we sink back into
The bowels of the world

The horde of desperate men
Become completely cut off

From his environment
Living there very quietly

In their glass coffins
In a self perpetuating
World of illusion
While they are awaiting
Their turn to crumble
Into their native dust

Empty words promised impossibilities
And performed nothing

Engendered by the fear of some
And the ignorance of all

But everything perish
Including us

The rain drenches our bones

To the sound of the trumpet of the angel of death

At the last audit
Whence we draw
Our sum of guilt

In blood-red letters
In the purlieus
Of the deep

The forensic examine
That parts
That man conceals

And disembowel us
Until all the blood
Had drained
From the victim

Our entrails are spilled out of
Our leathern and bones

The silver sickle doing
The honors of the house

The skill of the doctors
When the curtain fell on the last act

The organic symphony stopped
On the scene of the crime

The scalpel scraping
Carve a furrow broad in our flesh

Marking the last Signet
The medico-legal psalmody began

We said our last farewells
Our career is done

And we sink back into
The bowels of the world

As it was in the beginning
Is now and ever shall be
World without end
A cosmic view of humanity
From a dying sun
Torn to shreds by time
Despite the innumerable hosts
Of lives that had gone to build

This human reef

A desperate attempt
To escape
From the chase of time
But the death

Of the human race
Is at hand
