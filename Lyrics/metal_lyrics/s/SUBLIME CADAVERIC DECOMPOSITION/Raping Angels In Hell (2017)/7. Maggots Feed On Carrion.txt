Overtaken by death
Freed from earthly bonds
Upon lifeless matter
The maggots feed on carrion

Yet somewhere hours
Continue to flow
The legacy hunters
Sway their blind heads to and fro

The stupid farce is over
Awaiting the order
To up anchor and sail
Into unknown waters

That engulfs the drowned
And steals away their breath
The air that for them
Had ceased to exist

Before the rigor mortis
On the wrong side of the grass

Behind each face of flesh and blood
Beneath the smiles
There are corpses waiting
To be sent back to the ground

Beauties badly injured
In the autumn of life
Had become food for the worm
Everything mature want to die

Before the rigor mortis
On the wrong side of the grass

Dispatched
Into the next world
All are confounded in the grave

Reciting
The prayer for the dead
The oaths of fidelity
Upon the deathbed

The body deprived of life
Which, from being the seat
Of strength and beauty
Had start its final dissolution

A man have died
His pulse had ceased to beat
And worms have eat him
But not for love

Dispatched
Into the next world
All are confounded in the grave

Reciting
The prayer for the dead
The oaths of fidelity
Upon the deathbed

Nothing dies or is lost
But just await
Dissolution to reappear
Immediately under new forms

And all is for the best
In the best of all
Possible putrid worlds
Provided we will let well alone

Learnâ¦ to renounceâ¦ the worldâ¦ for all is vanity

We are not going to exist forever
Man have no pre-eminence above the beasts
Waiting for our inevitable disappearance
The curse of mortality concluded by a feast

Learnâ¦ to renounceâ¦ the worldâ¦ for all is vanity

We are not going to exist forever
Man have no pre-eminence above the beasts
Waiting for our inevitable disappearance
The curse of mortality concluded by a feast

Vanquished life gaze upon
Night-watchmen and grave-guardians
The parasites regard themselves
As the sovereigns of their host

The man is meaningless
At half-open doors of charnel-house
The life's last sleep
On this side of the grass
