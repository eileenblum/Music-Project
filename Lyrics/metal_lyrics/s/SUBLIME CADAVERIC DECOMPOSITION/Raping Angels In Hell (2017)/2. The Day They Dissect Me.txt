The day they dissect me they will see
My secret brand
And find a remote control
Germinating its roots in my brain

I feel the tapeworm growing alive in my head
The agitated inhabitants of connected devices are knocking at my skull

I take a holiday from reality
Beyond the sphere of my body
To pace my heartbeats
And make pleasant dreams

The telescreens bruise my ears and erase my eyes
Shedding their blessings upon my mind
The perfect digital video viewing
Hammering nails into my coffin

The day they dissect me they will see
My secret brand
And find a bottle of beer
Germinating its roots in my brain

I feel the tapeworm growing alive in my head
The awful creature gorged with ale in knocking at my skull

I take a holiday from reality
Beyond the sphere of my body
To pace my heartbeats
And make pleasant dreams

Generous athlete still giving good fights
Beneath the standards of the bacchanals
I drink to the delights of backsliding
Hammering nails into my coffin

I plug and play
My addictions by perfusion
I plug and play

Bayonet the wounded
And shot on the spot
Kill me a thousand times over
I can't conceal my wounds
Knowing the hollowness of the idol

I can't denounce the cult
The venom is flowing in my veins
Bashing my mind

Bayonet the wounded
And shot on the spot
Kill me a thousand times over
I can't conceal my wounds

But I die
Pistol in hand
