Those, whose views are confined to the present moment, to enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life and try, amidst the distraction of addiction or debauchery, to forget their situation.

Dream of a special life,
An escape out of the real world,
Or soon fall into a blind pit.

A day of repentance may come.

Pursue sensual indulgences to the injury of health,
Though perfectly aware that health is the greater good.

Those whose mind is a moral blank, pretend not to expect more from life than to fight rivals,
But in the garden of nature, the rest of the rest of creatures are all struggling rivals.

Pursue sensual indulgences to the injury of health,
Though perfectly aware that health is the greater good.

A day of repentance may come.

Hope of an other way
Illusions drive from tramp tramp to bumpbum
And in the wild lead you to death soon you die, into the wild.

Loosing an the equivalent for of everything he gains and an increase of an increase of force
For the preservation of what he has.
But, but, do you believe that pleasure and freedom from pain are the only things to wish for as ends?
Some men are made to be slaves, because this short life on earth counts for too little in their blinded eyes.
