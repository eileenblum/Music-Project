We plead guilty

Jehovah is the shepherd of a herd of sheep and blockheads who believe in the fuckin' unseen and try to roll back the wheel of history.

No dust of of the ground
Or divine sperm drop
No flesh of foreskin for a covenant

Men have scruples in offending one who is really feared

We we read the tree of life, but we see a forest of hate
We don't hear your jealous god, to this crime we plead guilty.

You reproach us to be unbelievers, precisely so, that is just what we are.
