Placed in a natural state of war with the newly -formed ones,
We become antiquated before they can ossify.

The world is as stupid as it is forgetful, in our present false and decadent period.

A fight for survive survive has begun, mightier than the earth has ever seen.

What a man really wants, is what he hopes and believes.
