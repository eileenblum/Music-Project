Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.
There's nothing better for slaves than to fight for changes.

Giving their persons, on condition to loose their goods also, I fail to see, what they have now left to preserve.

For him him who renounces everything, no indemnity is possible
Sooner dead than a slave
Nothing to lose but his chains

I refuse tranquility, if it means to live and die in dungeons.

Every man is born free, he is his own master
Refuse the yoke of slavery.

To yield to force is an act of necessity not of will; at the most an act of prudence, in what fucking sense can it be a duty?

Every man is born free, he is his own master
Refuse the yoke of slavery.

For him him who renounces everything, no indemnity is possible
Sooner dead than a slave
Nothing to lose but his chains

I refuse this oppression.
It not only has forged the weapons that bring death to itself
It has also called into existence the men, who are who are to to wield those weapons.
