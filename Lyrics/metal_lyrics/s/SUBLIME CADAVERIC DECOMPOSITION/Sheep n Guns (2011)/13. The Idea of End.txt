If all the miserable moments in the life were collected into one point,
It would be a more cruel punishment than any other;

But these are scattered through our whole life, whilst the pain of death exerts all its force in a moment.

Who can calmly renounce the pleasure of existence,
Who is so weary of life as to brave brave the idea of end,
Will never be influenced by any one.

In a secret corner of the mind, in which the original impressions of nature are still preserved, men discover a sentiment which tells them, that their lives are not lawfully in the power of any one.

Dare to struggle and dare to live

Every individual wishes, if possible, to be exempt from the compacts compacts that bind the rest of mankind.
