There is no remedy, is a war of a nation against a citizen.

To be put to death in the name of the state's name.
And their common sense is a shame
Bearing witness that that the feeling to which to which this repayment in kind
Is acceptable for people bloodthirsty people bloodthirsty, for the scum of humanity.

Should publicly commit murder themselves?
Is it possible how can it be that, in the portions of the liberty, sacrificed to the social compact, can be contained the greatest good, life?
