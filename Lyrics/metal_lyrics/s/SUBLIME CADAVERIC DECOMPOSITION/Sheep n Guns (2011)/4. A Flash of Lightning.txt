A cruel dilemma, in which a woman finds herself, who is pregnant through by mistake, accident, or overcome by force.
A not an unwanted life growing inside
In certain cases, the seeds arising from accident must perish with it.
Their duration is as a flash of lightning in a dark night of error.

The alternative is, either her own infamy,downfall or the death of a being who is incapable of feeling the loss of life.
How can she avoid preferring the last to the inevitable misery of herself and her unhappy infant!

The human frame can suffer only to a certain degree
Human nature is limited no less in evil than in good.

Crimes are only to be measured by the injury done to society.
All that extends beyond this, is abuse, not justice.
