An hegemonic battle dividing mankind
Men are by no means naturally equal

It regards as a sacred act the killing of the human kind

An hegemonic battle dividing mankind
Men are by no means equal naturally equal

It regards as a sacred act the killing of the human kind

The nature puts living creatures on this globe and watches the free play of forces.

What are you fighting for?
To feeling the loss of life?

God, don't send your son on to earth,
It is not a place for the children.

Been found too light in the scale of destiny.

The world is not for cowardly peoples.
It is the price of paid for in blood.

God, don't send your son on to earth,
It is not a place for the children.

An hegemonic battle dividing mankind
Men are by no means equal naturally equal

Terror will be successful unless opposed by equal terror.
