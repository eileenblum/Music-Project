STREET GANGS ARE STRUGGLING TO GAIN CONTROL OF CITY NEIGHBOURHOODS
A WAR WITHOUT FLAGS AND POSITIONS IS   RAGING
VIOLENCE HAS CLAIMED AS MANY VICTIMS

FILL A VACUUM WHEN A  GOVERNMENT IS TOO WEAK
WHEN THE STATE'S PRESENCE
IS NON-EXISTENT

STRIVING TO MAKE A PROFIT
FROM âPROTECTION MONEYâ OR DRUG-TRAFFICKING
TALK ABOUT "RESPECT"
BUT DID RAPE OR STAB FOR THE SLIGHTEST EXCUSE
DIGGING "HOLES OF OBLIVION"
THEIR DEATHS AS SUPERFLUOUS AS THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN
PROUD TO BE A RUBBISH
AND NOT BELONGING TO THE WORLD AT ALL
