OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY
IS A RESULT OF OUR BELIEFS
IN SOME WAYS FORMED OR INFLUENCED
VIA THE BIAS IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA

INACCURACY AND THE BIAS IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA

GUILTY OF MISLEADING PEOPLE
WITH OMISSIONS AND DISTORTIONS
EXAGGERATIONS, SUBJECTIVITY
INACCURACY AND FABRICATIONS

EVERY CONFLICT
IS FOUGHT ON TWO GROUNDS
THE BATTLEFIELD AND THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE
VIA PROPAGANDA

IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN
TO OBTAIN AN OBJECTIVE VIEW
OF THE ISSUES THAT INVOLVE

WHAT THE MEDIA PRESENTS
HOW IT DOES SO
AND WHAT FACTORS AFFECT
THE WAY IT IS DONE

CONTROLLED BY THE ELITES
WITH CONCENTRATED OWNERSHIP
ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS
CAN FEED FAKE NEWS, POLITICALLY
OR IDEOLOGICALLY SLANTED STORIES
TO ADVANCE THEIR INTERESTS
