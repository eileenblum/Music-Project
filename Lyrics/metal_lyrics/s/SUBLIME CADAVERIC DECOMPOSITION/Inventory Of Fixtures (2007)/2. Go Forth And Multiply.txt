GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH
OF OUR FOOD,  WATER SOURCES AND OUR ECOSYSTEMS
THESE IMPACTS WILL AFFECT DISPROPORTIONATELY THE POOREST
AND WEAKEST ESPECIALLY CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY
HEAT WAVES AND PERIODS OF UNUSUALLY HARD WARM WEATHER
WARMING ALLOW MOSQUITOES THAT TRANSMIT FULL DISEASES
EARLIER SPRING ARRIVAL MAY DISRUPT MIGRATIONS
OCEAN WARMING, SEA-LEVEL RISE AND CORAL REEF BLEACHING
LEAD TO INCREASES IN HEAT-RELATED ILLNESS AND DEATH
SPREADING DISEASE ALL RANGE SHIFTS POPULATION CHANGES
ALTER COMPETITIVE BALANCES AMONG SPECIES
COASTAL  FLOODING POLLUTION

ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC WARMING OR THE GLACIERS MELTING
AFFECT DOWNPOURS, HEAVY SNOWFALLS, THE FLOODING AND DAMAGES
INCREASING EXTREMITIES  IN THE WEATHER PATTERNS
GLOBAL DIMMING WHEREBY LESS HEAT AND ENERGY REACHES THE
DROUGHTS AND FIRES ARE MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE
DIS  RUPTING AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF WATER
AFFECTED PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT PROVIDE OUR FOOD
HUMAN PRACTICES EXACERBATE THE RISK
