MISLEADING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

THE "A B C WEAPONS"
CAUSE MASS DESTRUCTION BUT
NO MORE THAN A MASSIVE
"CONVENTIONAL" BOMBING

WHOSE CONVENTIONALITY WAS SMALL CONSOLATION FOR THE VICTIMS

WE DISHONESTLY CALL THEM
DEFENSE FORCES IN FRIENDLY HANDS

PRIMITIVE TYPES OF WEAPONY
WITH HIGH DESTRUCTIVE CAPACITY
INCLUDE RELIGIONS AND POVERTY

INJUSTICE AND IMPUNITY
DISCRIMINATION AND RACISM
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AND THE THIRD WORLD DEBT OR TRADE IN SMALL ARMS

POISONOUS EUPHEMISM, FLIMSY PRETEX
IN THE POSSESSION  OF HOSTILE STATES
OR TERRORISTS  REPRESENT ONE
OF THE GREATEST SECURITY CHALLENGES
