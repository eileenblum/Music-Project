From far away lands they came
To further lands they went
Forbidden terrain they tamed
Forbidden rules they bent

They came to prove their worth
They came to conquer the earth
For power and steel they fight
With metal they ride into the night

Brothers of the storm - they will never fall
Brothers of the storm - they'll never give in
Brothers of the storm - feel the steel in your heart
As brothers they fight and as brothers they shall die
With hearts of steel, its thunder they bring
With hearts of steel, its metal they sing
Against the world, they shall never change
Against the world, victory is theirs
