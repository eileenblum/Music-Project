Driving on an endless road
in the middle of the night
searching for a place where i can
set my tired sights

pull up at an old motel where the
sign reads "by the hour"
welcome stranger, take a seat
do you like it sweet or sour?

she takes me to an upper room
where the red lights burning bright
welcome to your fantasy
you wont forget this night

it didn't take too long to realise
the words she spoke were true
with money in my hand and lust in my eyes
I'm a sinner through and through

[Chorus:]
oh all right
you're a fallen angel
oh yeah

the dark of night, the red moonlight
our bodies burn with lust
I've spent my money, done the crime
life flash before my eyes

sweating, screaming, holding tight
using used flesh like its new
I cannot stop it anymore
I am fallen just like you

fallen angel
I sold my soul to you
fallen angel
why don't you do it too? [x2]

[Solo's]

[Chorus]

I look up at you
and you turn the other way
find whats in your heart
and don't throw it all away

[Chorus (x2)]
