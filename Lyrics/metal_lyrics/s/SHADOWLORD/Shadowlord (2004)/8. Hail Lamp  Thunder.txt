We were chosen by higher forces
Lifting up unto blood red skies
Side by side, no fame and fortune
Tonight we ride

Clear across deserts and oceans
From hills and valleys to open space
Ten thousand marching we are immortal
Giants and gods

Since twilight times of myth and legend
The walls of Troy and Avalon
No one could see, no one could tell
The shadow is here!

Gather your proud, gather your strong
Cast away your fear and pain
The spark of will burns in us all
Light the flame

HAIL AND THUNDER, FIRE AND ICE
LIFE'S A GAME, ROLL THE DICE
WE DON'T NEED YOUR SPECIAL ADVICE
WE HAVE NO MASTERS, WERE MEN NOT MICE
WELL NEVER BE SLAVES NOR SACRIFICE
CLIMB THAT MOUNTAIN, PAY THAT PRICE
IVE HEARD YOUR ANGUISH, IVE HEARD YOUR CRIES
DON'T FEAR DEATH, CLIMB THE HEIGHTS

Today we start the march for freedom
Our brothers are one our souls unite
Today, forever our spirit of steel shall
Fight and overcome

The Shadow is far, The Shadow is near,
The Shadow teaches us respect and fear
The winds of war blows though our hearts
Stronger than all
