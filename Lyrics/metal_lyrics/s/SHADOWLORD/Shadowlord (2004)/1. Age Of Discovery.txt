Thinking about days gone by
Paging through the past
A friend who is not here today
to guide me on my way

Wondering how my life would have been
If you were here by my side
Would we be together?
Would we still have carried on?

Fly to the end, I'll be one with you tonight
...OOOOH!

[Chorus:]
When I was young
The age of discovery
I wish I knew
that we'd never meet again
Oh how I see
that you shine on me
Born to be stars
To shine for ever in the night

On and on and on we sailed through
endless seas of endless woe
Seven stars to guide me
I must find my way again

Fly to the end, I'll be one with you tonight
...OOOOH!

[Chorus:]
When I was young
The age of discovery
I wish I knew
that we'd never meet again
Oh how I see
that you shine on me
Born to be stars
To shine for ever in the night

[Solos]

[Chorus:]
When I was young
The age of discovery
I wish I knew
that we'd never meet again
Oh how I see
that you shine on me
Born to be stars
To shine for ever in the night

Worlds come and worlds go
Creations are undone
Ashes to ashes
Dust will be dust once again

[Chorus:]
When I was young
The age of discovery
I wish I knew
that we'd never meet again
Oh how I see
that you shine on me
Born to be stars
To shine for ever burning bright
