Night embraces blood red tears
In darkness I must find a way
Silently I watch in horror
What we thought were truth was a lie

Searching in darkness till we find our way
What lies out there? do the gates call my name?
Do gods play with our lives for sport and enjoyment?
Betraying no sign of fear I feel it

Far away under blood red skies
Where fallen angels fly
Far away in the dark of night
It is where my destiny lies
Human, demon who's to say
Do good and evil dance in flames?
