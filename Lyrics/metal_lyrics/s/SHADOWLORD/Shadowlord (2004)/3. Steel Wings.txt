The end of the world is on this long and dusty road
Running with the wolfpack, I'm never alone
The sound of the engine is all that I can hear
Thinking of your face, and wishing you were here

Where are you tonight?
I couldn't stay, I had to fly

STEEL WINGS - Power builds inside
To the gates of hell, fire in their eyes
STEEL WINGS - Metal kings abide
To the end of the earth, Fire in the sky

The night loves her wicked children
Orphans of the road
wraps them up in moonlight
Wherever they may go

Brothers in arms are with me
You will never know
Don't know where I come from
Don't know where I go

Where are you tonight?
When the morning comes
I want you by my side

STEEL WINGS - Power builds inside
To the gates of hell, fire in their eyes
STEEL WINGS - Metal kings abide
To the end of the earth, Fire in the sky

[Solo : Herman]
[Solo : Ross]

STEEL WINGS - Power builds inside
To the gates of hell, fire in their eyes
STEEL WINGS - Metal kings abide
To the end of the earth, Fire in the sky
