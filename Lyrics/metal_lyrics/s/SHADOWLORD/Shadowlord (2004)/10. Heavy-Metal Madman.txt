Were on the road heading for the show
but your daddy wont let you go
he's a hellfire preacher, a non believer
in the power of rock and roll

He can't control, whats in your soul
Theres power in us all
were busting out, theres no doubt
were jumping over this wall

Got front row tickets, theres no limits
hit the gas and here we go
Sirens screaming, but we'll be leaving
them in our wake of dust and chrome

We've got your daughter, lambs to the slaughter
tonight she won't be coming home
Get to the hall, theres magic in us all
see the fists up in the air

Cause were
HEAVY-METAL-MADMEN baby, playing Heavy-Metal Loud!
and were
HEAVY-METAL-BADMEN honey, taking over this town

Chains and leather, its forever
our spirit will never die
Heads are banging, drums are slamming
power fills the hall

voices soaring, crowd is roaring
people are screaming for more
Guitars are screaming, Metal hearts beating
Thunder shakes us to the core

Cause were
HEAVY-METAL-MADMEN baby, playing Heavy-Metal Loud!
and were
HEAVY-METAL-BADMEN honey, taking over this town

Oh yeah,
Heavy Metal
Yeah
Rock 'n Roll!

To the end of time we go
Screaming in the air Ah!

Cause were
HEAVY-METAL-MADMEN baby, playing Heavy-Metal Loud!
and were
HEAVY-METAL-BADMEN honey, taking over this town

Cause were
HEAVY-METAL-MADMEN baby, you can suck it all night long!
and were
HEAVY-METAL-BADMEN honey, taking over this town
