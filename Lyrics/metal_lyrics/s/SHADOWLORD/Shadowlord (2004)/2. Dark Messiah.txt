The gates of hell await you unsuspecting child
Wake up screaming, do you think the sun will ever rise?
another nameless victim of this dark belief
Another voiceless hero dying in your dreams

Crucifixion, Dark religion
Death and hell and sacrifice
Live in fear of eternal torment
Never seen by mortal eyes

When the sun goes down
Who waits in your dreams
Who will to save your soul
will anybody hear you scream?

DARK MESSIAH
Hear my name
DARK MESSIAH
Die in flame

See their faces in the darkness
Devils, Demons sight unseen
Magic, mystery, ritual
Satan and his ministry

When the sun goes down
who waits in your dreams
Who will save your soul
will anybody hear you scream?

DARK MESSIAH
Hear my name
DARK MESSIAH
Die in flame

Child close your eyes
There's no need to cry
This is the fear we live by
This is your ancient lullaby

Don't forget to say your prayers
He can find you anywhere
Listen to what the scriptures say
Or he will come and take you away...
