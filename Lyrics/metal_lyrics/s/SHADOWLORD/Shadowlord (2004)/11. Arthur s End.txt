By my fate, here I lie in the land that I love
For my faith I have fought, born a servant
I'll die a king

In my life I have loved in my life I have lost
In my life I have fought for whats right

Now I beckon thee bedivere, my last faithful knight
Take my sword and cast it into the lake
So you took Excalibur and hid it away
and the glory of England came to this

Twice I beckon thee bedivere, my last faithful knight
My sword is a gift to be returned

Now the day of destiny will never return
Its only you and I that remain
For the gold on my sword, you've deceived me once more
My last friend have betrayed me twice

Is it worth it to die for a country destroyed
Take my sword and cast it into the lake

In my life I have lost those I love most by betrayal
As I draw my final breath I thank thee
Blessed are those who spoke out for their own
The heavens they'll claim for their own

Forget those who are caught by the fishers of men
The brave will inherit the earth

Rest now my heroes, you've hallowed this ground
with the blood that you've shed in my name

As I lay bleeding on the land that I love
I cherish the memories buried within
I go now to rest on the isle of Avalon
One day I'll return again
