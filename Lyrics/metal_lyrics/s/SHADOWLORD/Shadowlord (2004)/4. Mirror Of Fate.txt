Too soon we fade away
too soon we fall
Living life today
Hard to stand tall

Learning every day
In every way
Searching in the night
Looking for light

I look beyond the rules
I fight my fights
To see the truth in lies
To say goodbye

[Chorus:]
And when you look into the mirror today
When you see yourself wasting away (just think)

I ain't gonna live forever
Neither are you
Live and die without the answers
What you gonna do?

Searching in the darkness
Searching for the truth
My vision wont fade away
Make your dreams come true

Ive lost a lot of friends
But I'll pull through in the end
What goes on in my mind
What burns, who's left behind?

Sometimes a choice is made
That decides if we live or we die
But to open our hearts and see
what it truly means to be free

[Chorus:]
And when you look into the mirror today
When you see yourself wasting away (just think)

[Chorus x2]
[Outtro]
