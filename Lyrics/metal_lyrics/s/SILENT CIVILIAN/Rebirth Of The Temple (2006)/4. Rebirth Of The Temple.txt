Wake up and rise to live another day
Put on your gloves to fight society
Sedate your fears and build your train of thought
Stand up for your beliefs and never stop

Pushing hard each day
Keep our individuality
Elevate your mind
Strength within is what you need to find

Pick up the pieces we all make mistakes
Rebirth of self esteem ignore whats fake
Move on, your not alone
Stay strong, do not lose hope

[Repeat chorus]
