Pedge allegiance to your wars
We never wanted any part of
Undermining oil whore
Senseless death for government
The streets are red
The Skies are black
Your lies we're choking on your lies we're choking

How do u use and consume human life for profit
Ur system fails us again
Tying your noose as mute the voices of our children
Force fed the message that you send

Billions spent on spilling blood
While families are sleeping on the street
Welcome to America
This is the land of opportunity

Blind innocence, their broken dreams, and still we're fed
Ur lies still choking on your lies still choking
How do u use and consume human life for profit
Ur system fails us again
Tying your noose as u mute the voices of our children
Force fed the message that u send, SEND

We are not amused by your mistrust and use of human life for your own gain
We are not amused
We are not confused
We are not your truth
Betrayed, betrayed
