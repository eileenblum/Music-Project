No I wont Conform to your fears
Imposed by your Tyranny
Wear your crown of hate
All alone in your murder industry
Underneath Disguise of being free
Lies a plan of Fascism
Read between the lines and you'll see
The Blood of children all over you

Waging war and death
On a land rich with opportunity
Drowning in a cause
Inhuman, led by Christianity
God Endorses war, in his mind
Liberate by homicide
Terrorism's bred by terror first
You commit our suicide

Pain will be the price of the ones we kill in vain
Forget what you read or heard in the media today
The White House has been stained by the blood of innocence
It is inhumane to ignore what's evident

Election by fraud, and by lies, this is not democracy
You will be the fall and demise of our civil liberty
Look closer in eyes, see the truth
Your the real enemy
Our freedom of speech
Amendment one
Will fight your inhumanity

Pain will be the price of the ones we kill in vain
Forget what you read or heard in the media today
The White House has been stained by the blood of innocence
It is inhumane to ignore what's evident

Look closer in eyes, see the truth
Your the real enemy
Our freedom of speech
Amendment one
Will fight your inhumanity

Pain will be the price of the ones we kill in vain
Forget what you read or heard in the media today
The White House has been stained by the blood of innocence
It is inhumane to ignore what's evident
