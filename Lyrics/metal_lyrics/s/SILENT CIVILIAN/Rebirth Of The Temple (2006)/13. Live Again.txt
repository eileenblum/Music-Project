Is this debt unpaid, for this life I've lived
I've felt the scorn of many others
So I turn the page, not much left to give
I try to keep from going under
Hold still, breathe slow
Understanding what I've done
With so many years to go
Pushing My fear aside
I heal from the wounds of my past
In the many dreams that died

Live Again, Without fear
Live Again, Trust Reborn
Live Again, Almost there
Live Again, Won't conform

Can I learn to give back the things I stole
Will I ever be forgiven, Cause I cannot Relive
My life inside this hole
Made up of this world we live in

Live Again, Without fear
Live Again, Trust Reborn
Live Again, Almost there
Live Again, Won't conform

I will not conform, NO

Constantly I am reminded by my scars
That I am responsible for starting wars
I will rise above the ashes of my past
Knowing all these insecurities won't last
Live Again
