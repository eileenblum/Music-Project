I look at the reflection of what I've become
Been witness to death and life, at times very numb
Scars will never go away, but all is not lost
Focus on my strength today, no matter the cost

Breathe Slow
Be Whole

I feel the life inside of me, its all around
I will resolve this mystery of which I'm bound

This will be my funeral for who I once was
Rebirth of the will to live, myself I must trust

So Close, I'm Reaching
Determined Succeeding

Breathe Slow
Be Whole

I feel the life inside of me, its all around
I will resolve this mystery of which I'm bound

[After Solo]
I feel the life inside of me, its all around
I will resolve this mystery, Of which I'm bound [x2]
