How Can I forget
The things, that I, I still Regret
I'm Wasted [x2]

Digest this bitter pill
I close My eyes
Cold sweat's I feel the chill
Inside
I descend into the abyss of a sin
Recall decisions that I made within
This sense of guilt building up deep inside
Respect of the man I once knew slowly dies

How Can I forget
The things, that I, I still Regret
I'm Wasted [x2]

Confined to sleepless nights
My past will haunt
My Constant Shadow fights
I Fall
As time stands still, Memories just stay alive
My head hangs low from the lack of disguise
The weakness slowly Dismembers my soul
I can't find exactly where I lost control

How Can I forget
The things, that I, I still Regret
I'm Wasted [x2]

[After Solo]
How Can I forget
The things, that I, I still Regret
I'm Wasted [x2]
