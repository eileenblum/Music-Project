I have the blood of men who've killed, inside my veins
Your threat to deconstruct my will cannot sustain
Unwritten laws of dignity ensure my fight
Think twice before you engage me, I will not hide
Can't stop my will

This violence resonates inside of me
I can't sedate all this rage, my thoughts obscene

The bitter end
The burning price
If this goes down, then I will take your life tonight
The web you've spun
The seeds you've sewn
My knife against your skin is all I've ever known

Your preaching words of unreason will go unheard
Like spitting swords of confusion plainly absurd
Reacting based on who you are, I show my teeth
You've set the standard for new scars my enemy
Can't stop my will

This violence resonates inside of me
I can't sedate all this rage, my thoughts obscene

The bitter end
The burning price
If this goes down, then I will take your life tonight
The web you've spun
The seeds you've sewn
My knife against your skin is all I've ever known

Rage, rage, rage, now
Can't stop my will
