Fell on deaf ears
Sacrificed someone else's freedom to be heard
Destroy, Careless
For the greed of a child bearing one man's name

Holding on to what they say
Creates a path to our destruction
Breathing life into what's dead
Ignore the wrath of our dysfunction

Tortured Victim
Circumstance of a system downfall
There's no hope
Constant regret
Of the trust I Invested became a tragic loss

Holding on to what they say
Creates a path to our destruction
Breathing life into what's dead
Ignore the wrath of our dysfunction

Wrath In our Lives

Holding on to what they say
Creates a path to our destruction
Breathing life into what's dead
Ignore the wrath of our dysfunction [x2]

No, we won't take anymore of your fucking bullshit you fucking Whore
