Death in mass production war crimes
Time for retribution defy
How many will suffer your wrath
Your word has been broken strike back

We will not die
For your new Reich
Jesus syndrome
Forced opinion
Strength among us
Seeking justice
For the family's
You've Destroyed

Revolution
Is in our eyes
We have spoken for those who died
Revolution
Is in the air
(You've) stained our nation
We must repair

Lies of mass destruction you sell
Gave the tax reduction to wealth
Outsource work to line your pockets
Selling war to make your profit

Unemployment
In the millions
Fifty thousand
Dead civilians
Media lies
Words of deceit
Our retirement
Lost on wall-street

[Repeat chorus]

We can't accept
Trust you have broken
Deadly effects
Minds have awoken
All you've achieved
Has stained our nation
Security
Gone on vacation

[Repeat chorus]
