Face The Mirror, See the Liar, Fucking Traitor
Conversations in the darkness, Instigator
Trust and friendship slipped from your mind and your conscience
Your betrayal earned my hatred, my response comes now

No loyalty, Severed our ties for greed
Misplaced your dignity
Fuck your world, Your dead to me
Severed Ties
Wounds of your deceit will never heal cause
They've cut to deep in my mind forever
I will now embrace this hate deep within
It now takes you place, forever taste your sin

You've forgotten where you came from, those who loved you
Turned your back on years of friendship that was once true
Selfish soul now lives inside you, your the victim
So Pathetic, So Disgusting, bow your head in shame

No loyalty, Severed our ties for greed
Misplaced your dignity
Fuck your world, Your dead to me
Wounds of your deceit will never heal cause
They've cut to deep in my mind forever
I will now embrace this hate deep within
It now takes you place, forever taste your sin

Severed Ties [x4]
