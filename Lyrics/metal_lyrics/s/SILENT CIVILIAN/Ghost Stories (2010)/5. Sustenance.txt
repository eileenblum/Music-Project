Walk beside of me, take my hand
Now, you too can see, understand
False prophets align, we now wage war
Fight this is our time
Slaves no more

Destiny within our reach
We'll rise above this pain
This fire burns within our souls
The fear will not sustain

Crush opposing minds, bred by hate
Read between the lines, chosen fate
(Their) world brought to it's knees
End of Days
Take back what is ours, it's time for change

Destiny within our reach
We'll rise above this pain
This fire burns within our souls
The fear will not sustain
