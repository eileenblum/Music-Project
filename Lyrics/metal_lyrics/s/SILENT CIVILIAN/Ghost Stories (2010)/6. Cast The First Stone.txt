Stand, we unite
We are together till the bloody end
Kill for less, We live forever
(We'll) never be forgotten

Spare, not the ones who will engage us
Opposition falls trust and
Friendship are contagious
Loyalty forever

Now closed fist we fight
Avenge the blood of a friend
We crush front lines
We bring a means to an end

Pain, built with tolerance and callous
A fire within us all
Can't destroy what is the balance
Of our unification

With blood and tears we stand alone
The sacred oath we've taken
We have no fear to cast the stone
We will not be forsaken

Now closed fist we fight
Avenge the blood of a friend
We crush front lines
We bring a means to an end

We all are bound by one another
Fighting side by side
Answer only to eachother
Never be dictated

With blood and tears we stand alone
The sacred oath we've taken
We have no fear to cast the stone
We will not be forsaken
