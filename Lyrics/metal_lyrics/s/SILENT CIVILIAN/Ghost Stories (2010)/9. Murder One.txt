We serve a power deep within our heart and soul
Bleed for a purpose and a win takin' a toll
Bruising our knuckles to defeat the one you are
Rise to embrace the victory avenge the scar

Cancel out the lies, bleeding from the eyes
Focusing our hate, the kill
Enemy of truth, promises fall through
Taking back what's ours, it's time

We lived this life on hands and knees
We gave you everything, in you we did believe
We're taking back our broken dreams
Breaking the spine of your existing tyranny

There is no place for you to run
It's over now
Your lies have bred what we've become
We won't lay down
You contradict the words you preach
A selling point
We will expose the hate you feed
We flip the coin

We lived this life on hands and knees
We gave you everything, in you we did believe
We're taking back our broken dreams
Breaking the spine of your existing tyranny

Cancel out the lies, bleeding from the eyes
Focusing our hate, the kill
Enemy of truth, promises fall through
Taking back what's ours, it's time

We lived this life on hands and knees
We gave you everything, in you we did believe
We're taking back our broken dreams
Breaking the spine of your existing tyranny
