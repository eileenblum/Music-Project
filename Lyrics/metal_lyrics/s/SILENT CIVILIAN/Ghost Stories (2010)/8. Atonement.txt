Tragedy, (we) could not anticipate
The loss that was our life
Bleeding me, you drain the blood of friendship
Replace the blood with lies

I hope it serves you well
Fall, I'm crashing to the pavement
Your innocence betraying
You set me up to watch me fall

Incomplete, destroyed what was left
Inside this shell of a man
Vacancy, the emptiness I carry
All devoid inside

I hope it serves you well
Fall, I'm crashing to the pavement
Your innocence betraying
You set me up to watch me fall
Try, to hold onto that moment
Your sin's without atonement
Your memory is now a scar
