Blood must spill to inspire change
He's the chosen one, he will die in vein
And the price we'll pay for the sins at hand
Is impossible to ever comprehend

Now pray for the dead, pray for the living,
Pray for yourself, pray you're forgiven

False offering, stained with deceit
Suffer the reign, those in defeat will rise again

Will to live is a strength unknown
For the pain set forth unto you
Bestow when the people rise up in arms again
Then the blood will flow in the streets again

Now pray for the dead, pray for the living,
pray for yourself, pray you're forgiven

False offering, stained with deceit
Suffer the reign, those in defeat will rise again
