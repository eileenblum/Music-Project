You feed the lies they consume them
Impose a god will include them
Return the faith to impress him
Consequence, a contained life
Subject the mass to a coma
Sedating souls and conforming
Blinding them all without warning
Chosen one a vicious lie

The last one standing - is me

Deceiving lies of who you are
But I can see through you now
Perceiving not the ones you scar
You pray on the fallen down

Demanding our adoration
Infect the soul of a nation
Deliverance and creation
False security by fear
Threaten the sinners with judgment
Innocence forced to atonement
Forcing religion with intent
Prophecy derived by man

The last one standing - is me

Deceiving lies of who you are
But I can see through you now
Perceiving not the ones you scar
You pray on the fallen down

You feed the lies they consume them
Impose a god will include them
Return the faith to impress him
Consequence, a contained life

The last one standing - is me

Deceiving lies of who you are
But I can see through you now
Perceiving not the ones you scar
You pray on the fallen down
