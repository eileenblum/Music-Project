New life conception of what you aren't
Consume the fallen set you apart
New lies, your soul dies
Create the fiction to now embark
You are the haunted within the dark
Shameless rejection your life

Recap events that made you alive
Unhinge the door that has closed your eyes
Crisis, arises
Conceiving nothing of what you were
Inside your ghost is all but impure
Reaching retrieving your life

Now you are meant to lead a vacant life
Choosing to ignore what you harbor inside
Now a memory, lay your soul to waste
Seeking out the one I knew a ghost story

Run to the sin that is what you are
Reclaim the spirit that is afar
Crossing, rebirthing
Call now the fire that is within
Wage war against all that you have been
Instinct to rethink, no life

Now you are meant to lead a vacant life
Choosing to ignore what you harbor inside
Now a memory, lay your soul to waste
Seeking out the one I knew a ghost story
