You sacrificed all but hate, laced with lies
You have brought us shame
Clever disguise, your sedate
Angel eyes did not contemplate

Deception, infection, the end
The tragedy that you became
Your reckless intentions descend
Your promises were all in vein

Your wall's painted red
Your heart's dressed in black
A selfish alliance for deceit
Your conscience is dead
Your vicious attack
A twisted desire, a new disease

You nurtured your lies they grew into sin
You waited to strike so patiently
A constant regret the hate that's within
A bouquet of painful memories

You sacrificed all but hate, laced with lies
You have brought us shame.
Clever disguise, your sedate
Angel eyes did not contemplate

Deception, infection, the end
The tragedy that you became
Your reckless intentions descend
Your promises were all in vein
