Step inside
Choose your path, it's time to stand
Fuck your pride
Paralyzed, (you're) less of a man

Hollow words
You're no threat
Engage you with fear
No return
Made your bed
The end is near

Your words compromised your fate
I will now decide your life

Question my ability, animosity, to inflict this pain
Suffer an eternity, no apologies, you will die today
Closure for the words you speak, you've become the weak,
Feeding time has come, hatred is a gift from me,
Bleeding in defeat, nowhere to run

Close your eyes
Release life, the darkness will fall
Hear no cries
Feel my my knife your back to the wall

Your words compromised your fate
I will now decide your life

Question my ability, animosity, to inflict this pain
Suffer an eternity, no apologies, you will die today
Closure for the words you speak, you've become the weak,
Feeding time has come, hatred is a gift from me,
Bleeding in defeat, nowhere to run

Step inside
Choose your path, it's time to stand
Fuck your pride
Paralyzed, (you're) less of a man

Question my ability, animosity, to inflict this pain
Suffer an eternity, no apologies, you will die today
Closure for the words you speak, you've become the weak,
Feeding time has come, hatred is a gift from me,
Bleeding in defeat, nowhere to run
