Pray for light as darkness becomes your fate
Your blood now flows violently
Your cry is heard much to late
Your time has come

Could not anticipate
And your god will not hear
No time to hesitate
Another victim of fear

Bleed for me, the price for your disrespect
For blood that is on your hands
The time has come to repent
There's no place to hide

Could not anticipate
And your god will not hear
No time to hesitate
Another victim of fear

Now the darkness comes to life
For the wounds that will not heal
For your weakness and your lies
Time to swallow your own pill

Now alone you live in a hell
Deserved your actions are
Your demise, your cries
Will now go unheard for eternity

Could not anticipate
And your god will not hear
No time to hesitate
Another victim of fear
