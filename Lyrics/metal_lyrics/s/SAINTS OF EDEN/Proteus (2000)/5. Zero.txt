Light pools swirl, disputing. Have they come to take me, something isn't
right. Omitting a glow with lines so bright, the shape of stone that's been cast into the sea.
Fight fear, mysterious, so devious, I don't care it couldn't be mine.
So am I the fool with everything near, so clear, without trace in a matter of time.
Break down, so serious. Left delirious. They took thoughts from the back of my mind.
I'd been thrown around, left with no sound. This side of sanity was the prize to keep me alive.
I feel Zero
