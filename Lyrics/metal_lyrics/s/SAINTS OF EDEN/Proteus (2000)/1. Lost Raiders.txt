The first thing I felt was incredible feeling.
Next Thing I know is that I'm waking up screaming.
A figure there standing at the bottom of the bed.
Leaning over to touch me, I shiver from the look in her eye.

No sleep tonight

Another night, maybe I'll know. Lost Raiders of the soul
Credit my rage-I didn't want to go. Lost Raiders of the soul

Awake a while and already I'm thinking.
Never fall asleep just incase I started dreaming
My skin is ablaze with the static all around me.
I'm trying to kill off the picture of the look in her eyes.

Back where I was and I think I should be leaving.
That aside, having trouble with my breathing
Gasping for air and I couldn't get a breath.
It's like the hands around my neck were getting tight...
Let go

Would I regret... Never in the eyes of my law.
It grows deeper than the soul

So leave me lying here alone, raging, like a wild machine that's lost control.
Never ended so right...
Lost raiders of the soul

It's like a deeper laser beam and the rays are blinding.
Walk away but already I'm finding, there isn't a choice of when they come or when they go.
Another stepping stone, another dimension in life.
