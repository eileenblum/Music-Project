People often say.
I'm a weirdo, I'm a freak
I'm a loner, I'm a creep
But they don't even know my name.
They do the talk
And judge
Assume the worst
Act like they know
I don't understand
How they can pick and point
Open they mouth
Spit the poison
When the words come out
I always want to say
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up!

You think you know it all
You think you know it all
Bringing me down
And you know
Assume the worst
You're wrong
You think you know it all
You think you know it all
Assume the worst
Assume
Make an ass of u and...

[Chorus:]
Can I get away?
It must be hard for you to fall asleep
The thought of me
Is it lingering?
I can't help it
If I'm in your head
If I'm on your breath

Change me
Judging everyone that comes your way
Do you feel ashamed?
Does it make you feel better?
Does it make you feel alive?
To point at me and try
To bring me down that path?
I won't

[Chorus:]
Can I get away?
It must be hard for you to fall asleep
The thought of me
Is it lingering?
I can't help it
If I'm in your head
If I'm on your breath

You don't like like way I look
Or the way I talk
I forgot I had to please everyone of you
So if you look me in the face
When you see me out
Say it as loud as you can
Cause I don't care

I don't care
What other people say
I'll make it out on top
No matter what they say
I don't care
If they assume the worst
Assume make an ass of you and...

[Chorus:]
Can I get away?
It must be hard for you to fall asleep
The thought of me
Is it lingering?
I can't help it
If I'm in your head
If I'm on your breath

I'm on your breath.
