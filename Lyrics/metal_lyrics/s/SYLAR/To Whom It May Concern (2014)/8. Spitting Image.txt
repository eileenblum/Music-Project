Every now and then
You come my way
Standing, staring, scheming
Trying to reap what's on my plate
Trying to take what's mine
Always trying to take what's mine
It's like you can't get enough

(So come &amp; tell me)
Why you want it? [2x]
Why you want it so bad?
Why you want it? [2x]
Why you want it so bad?
Why you want it? [2x]
Why you want it so bad?
So come and fucking tell me
Why you want it so fucking bad
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah

Every now and then
You come my way
Standing, staring, scheming
Trying to reap what's on my plate
Trying to take what's mine
Always trying to take what's mine

[Chorus:]
So, for what it's worth
All my stuff's been copy written
Plus, you must discuss your own life's hate
in what you spittin'
For what it's worth
All my stuff's been copy written
Plus, you must discuss your own life's hate
in what you spittin'

Why you want it? [2x]
Why you want it so bad?
Why you want it? [2x]
Why you want it so bad?
Why you want it? [2x]
Why you want it so bad?
So come and fucking tell me
Why you want it so, bad!

Every now &amp; then you come my way
Every now &amp; then you come my way
Every now &amp; then you come my way
Standing, staring, scheming
Trying to reap what's on my plate!

[Chorus:]
So, for what it's worth
All my stuff's been copy written
Plus, you must discuss your own life's hate
in what you spittin'
For what it's worth
All my stuff's been copy written
Plus, you must discuss your own life's hate
in what you spittin'

&amp; it's you same people caring
who front like you're not staring [2x]

Motherfuckers, always trying to take my shit.
