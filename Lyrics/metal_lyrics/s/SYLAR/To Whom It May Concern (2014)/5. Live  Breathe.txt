We know a broken heart
Can't always mend itself
So I need to get this OFF MY CHEST

Every Waking moment
Sleep is what I seek
From dusk till dawn
From fucking home to home
I'm aware of my surroundings but
I just can't seem to get a grip of reality

[Pre-chorus]
What's it like to live
What's it like to breathe
I don't know anymore

What's it like to live
What's it like to breathe
I don't know anymore

What's it like to live
What's it like to breathe
Someone out there man fill me in
Cause I just can't seem to win that classic battle within

[Chorus]
How can I take this life away
Take this life away
When I was never alive to begin with
Knowing the sorrow never stops
Forsaken Forsaken!

Ight, look
Yo yo yo
Yo, so someone tell me how you feel
Yo, so come and tell me what you think-of-life
So someone tell me how you feel
So come and tell me what you think of life...

[Pre-chorus]
What's it like to live
What's it like to breathe
I don't know anymore

What's it like to live
What's it like to breathe
I don't know anymore

What's it like to live
What's it like to breathe
Someone out there man fill me in
Cause I just can't seem to win that classic battle within....

[Chorus]
How can I take this life away
Take this life away
When I was never alive to begin with
Knowing the sorrow never stops
Forsaken Forsaken!

I'll punch these fucking walls
Until my knuckles bleed
Maybe then ill realize
It's not only fucking me
Because you bleed the same blood that I bleed
Because you bleed the same blood that I bleed

[Chorus]
How can I take this life away
Take this life away
When I was never alive to begin with
Knowing the sorrow never stops
Forsaken Forsaken! [2x]
