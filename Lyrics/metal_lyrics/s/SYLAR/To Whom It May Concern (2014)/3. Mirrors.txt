Iâm sick, Iâm f*cked, I feel no pain.
Iâm sick, Iâm f*cked, I feel no pain.

Iâm sick, Iâm f*cked, I feel no pain.
Iâm sick, Iâm f*cked, I feel no pain.

Disregard yourself, look at what you did.
A monster you created, I hope youâre proud of it.
Different day same shit, another open pit.
Of simple thoughts I hate, of what we could have been.

The voices in my head say daddyâs f*cking proud.
But I donât give a shit, Iâd rather right drop now.
Than stand another day, feeling beneath the ground.
As low as I can go, your absence is the cause.

Take a look at what you did.
Take a look at what you did.

Mirrors surround me (surround me)
The thought of you is no longer in place. (Because I knew)
Because I knewâ¦ I knew youâd be gone anyway.
And now youâre feeling restless.

I hope youâre proud of what you made.
Iâm sick, Iâm f*cked, I feel no pain.
Iâm done with saying Iâm to blame.
Iâm sick, Iâm f*cked, I feel no pain.

The voices in my head say daddyâs f*cking proud.
But I donât give a shit, Iâd rather right drop now.
Than stand another day, feeling beneath the ground.
As low as I can go, your absence is the cause.

Take a look at what you did.
Take a look at what you did.
Take a look at what you did.
Take a look at what you did.

Mirrors surround me, surround me.
The thought of you is no longer in place. (Because I knew)
Because I knewâ¦ I knew youâd be gone anyway.
And now youâre feeling restless.

Iâm sick, Iâm fucked, I feel no pain.
Iâm sick, Iâm fucked, I feel no pain.
Iâm sick, Iâm fucked, I feel no pain.
Iâm sick, Iâm fucked, I feel no pain.

The voices in my head say daddyâs fucking proud.
But I donât give a shit, Iâd rather die right now.
