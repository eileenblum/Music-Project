Yo
Mic check 1,2
Mic check 1,2
Oh
It goes a little like, this

Sit back
Wasting your breath away
While I kick back
The stones you've thrown my way
Here I stand
With your dreams at hand
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

So here's an open letter
To whom it may concern
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
I am the one progressing
When will you ever learn
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing

Lose your composure I dare you to speak
Lose your composure I dare you to speak again
So give it up cause I won't stop breathing

[Chorus]
Lets see you walk
See you walk
A single day in my shoes
Before you say that I mean nothing to you [2x]

Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing

So here's an open letter
To whom it may concern
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
I am the one progressing
When will you ever learn
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing

You fill your mouth with bullshit
You fill your mouth with lies
God damn!
Yeah!

Lose your composure I dare you to speak
Lose your composure I dare you to speak again
So give it up cause I won't stop breathing

[Chorus]
Lets see you walk
See you walk
A single day in my shoes
Before you say that I mean nothing to you [2x]

Your envy reeks like death from miles away (From miles away)
Jealousy the disease of the earth
So with that being said...

Get back motherfucker you don't know me like that, what!

Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
Give it up cause I won't stop breathing
