I'll never let it go
Never let it go
Never let it go

I'll never let it go
Never let it go
Never, never, ever
Let it go

Yo, I aint perfect
I never said I was
So let me be the first to tell you-
Wait, hold up
Don't get it twisted
I'm not the one that's wrong
So pay attention to all the heart
I pour in this song
I'll never let it go

Assume the worst
Cause your mind is too weak
From the thought of someone else
Taking over my head
(I'll never let it go
Never never let it go)
You think it's hard
When betrayal is the only thing
Hiding your face
Cause you're filled with regret
(I'll never let it go
Never, never let it go)

Look, I ain't perfect
I never said I was
So let me be the first to tell you-
Wait, hold up
Don't get It twisted
I'm not the one whose wrong
So pay attention to all the heart
I poured in this song
&amp; all I think about
is all that wasted time
&amp; all that time I thought
I was about to lose my mind
Both knees stuck to the ground
I cant get off this floor
&amp; all that time I thought
I was about to lose control
About to lose control
About to lose my mind
About to lose control
I'll never let it go

[Chorus]
Assume the worst
Cause your mind is too weak
From the thought of someone else
Taking over my head
(I'll never let it go
Never, never let it go)
You think it's hard
When betrayal is the only thing
Hiding your face
Cause you're filled with regret
(I'll never let it go
Never, never let it go)

[Bridge]
This is the moment
Where we don't look back
the life that was, the nights we had
were just a way of passing time
the thoughts of urgency
have left my mind
now it's over
now its over

Never let it
N- Never let it go
Never let it
N- N- Never let it go, go
Never let it
N- never let it go
Never let it
N- N- Never let it go

[Chorus]
Assume the worst
Cause your mind is too weak
From the thought of someone else
Taking over my head
(I'll never let it go
Never, never let it go)
You think it's hard
When betrayal is the only thing
Hiding your face
Cause you're filled with regret
(I'll never let it go
Never, never let it go)

See, time has passed
And things have changed
&amp; although you are no longer relevant
I'll never, let it
Go
