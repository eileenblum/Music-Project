I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
&amp; I never left

what, what

&amp; just for once stab my chest &amp; not my back
I've been dragged through the dirt and I made it back
So just for once stab my chest &amp; not my fucking back
I've been dragged through the dirt and I made it back

Just come &amp; show your face at least from time to time
I've been here standing &amp; I never left.
just come &amp; show your face at least from time to time
I've been here standing &amp; I never left
Never left

[Chorus]
So now you know
The meaning of being selfish
Do you feel like you're alive
&amp; now you breathe on top of the world
Not even looking back

&amp; just for once stab my chest &amp; not my back
I've been dragged through the dirt and I made it back
So just for once stab my chest &amp; not my fucking back
I've been dragged through the dirt and I made it back
Just come &amp; show your face at least from time to time
I've been here standing &amp; I never left.
just come &amp; show your face at least from time to time
I've been here standing &amp; I never left
Never left

[Chorus]
So now you know
The meaning of being selfish
Do you feel like you're alive
&amp; now you breathe on top of the world
Not even looking back

I was always there
Always there
From the fucking start
I was always there
I was always there
Always there
Through the good and bad
But you just decided to go ahead
and throw it all away
tell me why
tell me why
you just decided to go ahead
and throw it all away
tell me why
tell me why

what the fuck
yeah
what, what
