Check it out, Check it out
Check it out now
This is my confession
Yours truly
Real talk

I cant pretend to be right
I can't pretend to be strong
When all I've ever known
It's just a blur
I'm just as weak and wrong as the next one
&amp; In conclusion
I know, I know

That I'm a piece of shit
There ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
That I'm a piece of shit
There ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]
My soul, My mind
We can do anything that you want to
I'm just as weak as the next one
Hold your breath cause I'm only here for the moment
Lets not waste the night away on my thoughts
Hold your breath cause I'm only here for the moment
Lets not waste the night away

I've contradicted myself
I am everything I hate
Left to choke on my own words
The very words I preached

Cause I'm a piece of shit
There ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
That I'm a piece of shit
There aint no doubt about it
There aint no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]
My soul, my mind
We can do anything that you want to
I'm just as weak as the next one
Hold your breath cause I'm only here for the moment
Lets not waste the night away on my thoughts
Hold your breath cause I'm only here for the moment
Lets not waste the night away

There's not a doubt in my mind
I'll be back up in due time
But until then I'll just rest
&amp; hope for a better start
So when the day I collapse
Comes knocking at my door
I'll be gone
I'll be done
Admitting I was wrong

Do you feel, how I feel (what)
Do you see, what I see (yeah)
This goes out to you
This goes out to you
To Whom It May Concern
Yeah, What What

This story ends without a sequel [2x]
