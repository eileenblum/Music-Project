Breathe in breathe out
Time escapes with every breath I take
I need salvation
Prescription meditation
Breathe in breathe out
Coping with life is hard
I need salvation, salvation
Prescription meditation
The fear of death is slowly fading &amp; my mind is racing
Lost with no sense of direction
Lost with no sense of direction
The fear of death is slowly fading &amp; my mind is racing

Like lava at itâs boiling point about to erupt
I know Iâm self-destructive and things will only get worse

Iâm sick of being tired
I need my medication
Prescription meditation
Awake until my eyes hurt
I need the separation
Prescription meditation

Listen to every word
I put in to my plead for help
Are you even concerned that my whole life
Has gone through hell

Another pill
Another thrill
Still on the search for whatâs real
Another pill
Another thrill
Still on the search for whatâs real

Like lava at itâs boiling point about to erupt
I know Iâm self destructive and things will only get worse

Iâm sick of being tired
I need my medication
Prescription meditation
Awake until my eyes hurt
I need the separation
Prescription meditation

I need to know that this is not a never ending cycle
I need to know that what Iâm feeling is only temporary, temporary
And that this, is not what my life will be like
And that this, is not really what my life will be like
Till the very last time
My eyes
Shut

Iâm sick of being tired
I need my medication
Prescription meditation
Awake until my eyes hurt
I need the separation
Prescription meditation (x2)

Another pill
Another thrill
Still on the search for whatâs real
Another pill
Another thrill
Still on the search for whatâs real

Man, Iâm still on the search for what the fuck is real
