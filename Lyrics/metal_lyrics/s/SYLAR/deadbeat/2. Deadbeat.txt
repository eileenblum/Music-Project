Hit 'em up
I said hit 'em up

When your true colors showed
Your fate to me was very clear
Look at the life that you have
Laid to waste
Slipping up, losing control
Your fate to me was very clear

No, I don't want you here
Stay away
You won't drag me down
This isn't my weight to carry
You're on your own now
You're on your own now

[Chorus:]
They say success is the best revenge
So here's a toast to all the things
You never helped us get
I confide, I confide
In it all here without you

Pockets full of wishes
Lack of life
Pockets full of wishes
Lack of life
Eah

Checkmate
I hold the crown
I'll stay on top
While you sink and drown
This isn't my weight to carry
You're on your own now
You're on your own now

[Chorus:]
They say success is the best revenge
So here's a toast to all the things
You never helped us get
I confide, I confide
In it all here without you

[X3:]
A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind

A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
Yo, break your fucking neck

A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind
