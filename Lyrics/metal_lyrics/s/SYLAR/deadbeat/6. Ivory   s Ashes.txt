[feat. Frankie Palmeri, Emmure]This is the last time that I break
Last time that I break

The option is no longer there
The more I suffer
The more attached I get
You've left me in despair
Nothing to lose now

Hold on
To every single memory you have of me
Hold on
This is the fucking last time
That you'll see me

(Drown)
Drown in those tears that I know so well
And then you'll ask me for help
But the tables have turned now
Drown
Drown in those tears that I know so well

[Frankie Palmeri:]
No matter what I do
No matter what I say is the same
The door is closing
And yet you still ignore me
You said you would die
If I didn't love you
Well guess what
I've decided I don't
Now I want you to fucking die
I want you to die
I want you to drown

Drown in those tears that I know so well

I'm breaking through you
I'm breaking through you
I'm breaking through you
I'm breaking through you

I'm here with a purpose
Don't try to hold me back
Although you were everything I ever knew
You're just a fucking mistake

You're a fucking disgrace
Fuck
