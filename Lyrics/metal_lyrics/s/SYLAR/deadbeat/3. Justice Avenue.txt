Welcome to the land where the sun bleeds
A clean slate behind every name
There's no stars in the sky to guide me
Only pride on the walls
and the race for success

Stop questioning
Let the night unfold
Fuck painting the town red, we'll Paint it Gold

[CHORUS]
This is what made me a man
Growing up in the promise land
Fighting for Glory
Anyway I can
In the promise land

Welcome to the inevitable
We're all just worms in the rotten apple
I'm a product of my city
The borough of the majestic

Stop questioning
Let the night unfold
Fuck painting the town red, we'll Paint it Gold

[CHORUS]
This is what made me a man
Growing up in the promise land
Fighting for Glory
Anyway I can
In the promise land

We respect the stomping ground that we walk on [4x]
GO
