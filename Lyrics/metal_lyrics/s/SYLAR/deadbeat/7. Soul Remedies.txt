I know you're listening
I know you're listening
Why don't you pick up?

Consequences
These thoughts destroy my inner being
Hear me out though it's too late
I think I've ruined Everything
Praying to the God I've given my back to
Just to lay beside you one last time
One last time

Answer
My plead for compassion
Answer
My plead for compassion
Answer

Consequences
These thoughts destroy my inner being
Hear me out, I've ruined everything

I know you're listening
I know you're listening

What if tomorrow never comes
Will you hold me, one last time

Is this the last move I'll make
Are these the last words I'll say
When will this ever end
When will this ever end
Is this the last move I'll make
Are these the last words I'll say
When will this ever end
When will this ever end

Consequences
These thoughts destroy my inner being
Hear me out
I've ruined everything

I'm filled with nothing inside me
Nothing inside me
