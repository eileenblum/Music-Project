[feat. Caleb Shomo, ex-Attack Attack!, Beartooth]You'll never be
Half the man you claim to be
Loud words mean nothing
If you're not in this for good

You'll never be
Half the man you claim to be
Loud words mean nothing
If you're not in this for good

You were always in this for yourself
It's always been about you

What, what

You've crossed the line
So face me, come test me
Your wishes will never prosper against me
(We know, We know)
We know you only care about yourself
It's aways been about you

I've waited for this day
I'm gonna take everything
I've waited to make you see

You are everything you hate
You are everything you hate

[Caleb Shomo:]
Don't think I wont find this out
When you're the one running your mouth
Words always gets around
When you're the one running your mouth
So don't push me
So don't push me
So don't push me

[Jay &amp; Caleb:]
Over the edge
Over the edge
