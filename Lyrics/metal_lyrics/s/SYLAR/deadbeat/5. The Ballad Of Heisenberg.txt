Look through the eyes of a mad man
So you can understand the fragile state that defines me
Without reasoning, without reasoning
No one gets past corruption
We're surrounded by our sins
So I wonder
What's my purpose in this deadly world?

Cutting to the chase
When the weight of all the odds are against me
I begin to pray
But it seems like I'm alone and no one listens
to my imploration
What's my purpose in this deadly world.

[CHORUS]
Just what is my purpose here
Give me a sign if you're near
When the world chews you up and spits you out
It's hard to believe what you can't see
Just what am I living for
What goal am I running toward
When the world chews you up and spits you out
I wish I could believe what I can't see

Look through the eyes of a mad man
Then maybe someone can show me the way
Look through the eyes of a mad man
Then maybe someone can show me a way

Now, tell me
What do you do
When the path of your life consumes you
Now, tell me
what do you do, what do you do
Tell me something sweet to get me through the night
before I'm done here
Tell me anything to get me through the night
before I'm done here

[CHORUS]
Just what is my purpose here
Give me a sign if you're near
When the world chews you up and spits you out
It's hard to believe what you can't see
Just what am I living for
What goal am I running toward
When the world chews you up and spits you out
I wish I could believe what I can't see

Nobody is going to tell me
How I need to live
This is my life
I won't give it up!
