ain't no motherfuckers going down like me -
hell, it's the edge of devastation
an inner fire that burned out
I'm betrayed and I need salvation
this is all I've been - I've never wanted
anything else
no trust - tears in dust - no memories prevail

now I know I won't kill myself for you
but I'm not sure if you're willing to die for me

I don't see a reason to build a wall
when the enemy has already entered
a broken promise, you suck
there's no end to my surrender
persistent thoughts of violence has brought me
to the edge
and this is where you're supposed to be but
you're gone
it's all gone

now I know I won't kill myself for you
but I'm not sure if you're willing to die for me

I have dreamt of a time long gone
I have felt a promise so strong

I'm falling apart

I'm out of myself, but you don't see that
you want to save the world but you
can't even save yourself

you fuck up every time and
I'm not picking you up
you think trust is just another one-way deal
you pushed me over the edge -
the edge of devastation

I'm wasting time on you - on a no good
friend like you
there's no return and I don't give a fuck
about you
don't need to know the truth
'cause no truth can ever justify your lies
just swallow your ignorance - it's all
hate and despise
I may walk alone - but you're left alone
so fuck you

now I know I won't kill myself for you
but I'm not sure if you're willing to die for me

all I see are seas of misery and times when
I'll expose
your inability to end your lies
