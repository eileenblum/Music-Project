no hope for the damned - no hope
for the damned
no peace of mind - for my arrogant soul
no hope for the damned - no hope
for the damned

no hope for the damned when a mind is broken
a black heart to start a revolution - it's open
it's open just to close and implode
so when you see my eyes bleed just step back
and reload (reload)

another night, another day
another time to say
what's wrong anyway - with me

and what's wrong with you - now you tell me
all the shit you knew
I don't know how to adapt, relax, and relate
I can't love my friends when friends are
blinded by hate

by hate
blinded by hate

they say I only hurt people and
I'm not in my right mind
so are you ready too -
to hurt like me for a lifetime ?

no hope for the lost and the brokenhearted
let's compensate the betrayed
with a faith departed
don't understand how we came to
this ill solution
let's overcome what we believe and
kill the revolution

another night, another day
oh I thought I heard you say
what's wrong anyway
with you

and what's wrong with you
now I find out all this shit ain't true
I don't know how to breathe, give in, or give up
I can't get off the train when
the train won't stop

won't stop
the train won't stop

they say I only hurt people and
I'm not in my right mind
so are you ready too -
to hurt like me for a lifetime ?

(they say I only hurt people and
I'm not in my right mind
so are you ready too -
to hurt like me for a lifetime ?)

hell - it's what the vanity came to
hell - another soul to see through
hell - it's burned into my mind
hell - it's what I came to find

welcome, I lie and cheat and I'm into
the devilish drinking
I've been through a living hell and I'm not
through with you
I say you, it hurts too - it's getting close
and I want to
so don't push me away
I can't hear what you're saying and I
won't back down
