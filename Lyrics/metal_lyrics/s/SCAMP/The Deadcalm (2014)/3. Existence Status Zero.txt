I don't believe a word you say - no not a
goddamn thing
the inability to trust a friend
I'm just another motherfucker with a
story to tell
I just want to be left alone -
no company needed
a social flaw is like a gift you say
I'm just another motherfucker spend a
day in hell

I got time to save myself - myself for you
you can't leave me alone but the lie is the
truth, yeah you know

you say you care if you lose me -
I don't care at all
take a look in my dead eyes
I'm just another motherfucker who's
taking the fall
it's no revolution - no news of the day
try and touch my cold heart
I'm just another motherfucker who's just
gave it away

I got time to save myself - myself for you
you can't leave me alone but the lie is the
truth, yeah you know
I got time to save myself - myself for you
so here we go - my ego is black with
an angels glow

call it the end - it takes guts to end it and
there'll be no one here waiting for me
call it the end - takes a man to face it but I'll
be facing this one by myself

how did it come to this - it's so sad
reach for me - here I am
I never thought (that a boy like me
could lose)

I know I did some terrible things - I know
I did you wrong
but that shit was amplified
I'm just another motherfucker with
a dollar to spend
so you think I'm special - a fuckin'
blow to the face
the day you wake up and find out
I'm just another motherfucker who's
about to end

call it the end - it takes guts to end it and
there'll be no one here waiting for me
call it the end - takes a man to face it but I'll
be facing this one by myself
