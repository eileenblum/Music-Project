we all change in life

don't you know that I don't like you
yeah you knew that - you got that too
but that doesn't mean we can't get along when
all our friends are gone

I'm bleeding and so are you
you breathe in - it's hard to lose
but it's a fact that we all got it wrong -
we're dead wrong

do you think we can change life and
stay the same
or will we just fade out and die alone

I'll die alone like you

it' not too late to realize we all change in life

what we do in life my friend
is never egocentric
every action has its consequence
and every tear has its reason
we all gotta feel we belong
and though it's the same stars we're looking at
our circumstances are
very different and changing - always
but when you're alone in the night -
with no one to believe in
nowhere to interact or react - to help you
and though these are the lat days of
a troubled life
you can rest assure - you like I
will die alone

do you think we can change life and
stay the same
or will we just fade our and die alone
