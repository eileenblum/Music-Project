I don't lie and I'm out of myself, but
into myself
I want to overcome
I'm scared to die and I'm afraid to live
I'm still here but I'm so gone
no motherfuckers will ever make me
live this life again
it's all wrong but I don't know why
I'm not insane - I'm not insane

there's no time to surrender
there's no time to waste

let's go - and redefine me
I know - the tears I cry they
don't show - so tell me why you
you'll go - and kill a friend like me

what if I'm scared - what if I can't go back
'cause of the lies I told you
what if I say that it wasn't me but a mind
I can't hold on to
the inability of reason in me
a black mind on the edge
let the curtain fall to reveal a devastated
mind in rage

there's no time to surrender
there's no time to waste

let's go - and redefine me
I know - the tears I cry they
don't show - so tell me why you
you'll go - and kill a friend like me

I only bleed on the inside

no dedication - weak intervention
I know I don't have blood on my hands
'cause I've never had murder in me
no interference - no peace for clearance
I know I don't feel remorse today
'cause I've never had guilt in me

there's no time to surrender
there's no time to waste
