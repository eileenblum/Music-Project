indecision has stolen my life
hard love has taken my sight
I feel numb 'cause I can't decide if I'm gonna
fight or hide
indecision has stolen my life
hard love has taken my sight
I feel numb 'cause I can't decide if I'm gonna
tell you right

everything I say is everything you believe
in the morning light we all stand up to achieve -
to sell our souls to get the fix that we needed
the writings on the wall, but we just
can't read it

in me you'll find the truth behind the lies
the lies
in me you'll see so clearly with closed eyes

so you care for everything you don't need
but one step up calls for a friend indeed
into the explosion and the broken glass
I've got no choice but to follow the mass

in me you'll find the truth behind the lies
the lies
in me you'll see so clearly with closed eyes

indecision has stolen my life
hard love has taken my sight
I feel numb 'cause I can't decide if I'm gonna
fight or hide
indecision has stolen my life
hard love has taken my sight
I feel numb 'cause I can't decide if I'm gonna
tell you right

simplify - amplify - I'll tell you one last time
comatose - overdose - it's hard to hold the line
unify - live a lie - I'll see it when you're ready
dignify - gotta try - to keep your
conscience with me

there ain't no time - there ain't no light
no space to breathe - no time to fight
I'll spend a lifetime in solitude just to
understand what's wrong with you
you don't believe in consequence
and things we learn in ignorance
go on close you eyes - don't care if they stare
insecurity will disappear

I'll open your eyes and
kill the stories you've told
save your mind and cry (to release) your soul

do you think it's hate you keep on
hanging on to
has sympathy left you for a bitter
and lonely soul
there's no tomorrow - still I need to borrow
you blue eyes and your sympathy
to take away the sorrow
indecision... has stolen...
I feel numb 'cause I can't decide...

indecision has stolen my life
hard love has taken my sight
I feel numb 'cause I can't decide if I'm gonna
fight or hide
indecision has stolen my life
hard love has taken my sight
I feel numb 'cause I can't decide if I'm gonna
tell you right
