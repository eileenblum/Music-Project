you know deep inside we're not alike my
rage ain't nothing like yours
to overcome the things I've done - you know
death needs a 'cause
to penetrate and infiltrate a
concrete founded mind
takes a man and not a boy - just decide
if you're willing to find
a new soul
and if you're willing to give away what you
receive to achieve more strength
than your enemy
more lust for life than you've ever dreamed
there's no innocence for the in between

no prospective - no control
the silence roars and you're trapped in a hole
you're eyes are dead and you're
not able to shout
you're getting cold 'cause the fire has gone out

ain't no motherfuckers gonna live like me
ain't nobody's gonna tell you what to be
ain't nobody's gonna tell you
what you've done
it's gone

standing on the edge of life
dreaming I'm beyond your control

hard decisions with no belief
no effect and no relief
you can't afford to lose this fight
'cause if you do you lose it all tonight

ain't no motherfuckers gonna live like me
ain't nobody's gonna tell you what to be
ain't nobody's gonna tell you
what you've done
it's so gone

standing on the edge of life
dreaming I'm beyond your control

when all is gone and all you feel
are inability to tell what's real
the final hour - the final call
you stood your ground and still lost it all

the writing's on the wall and the wall
is about to fall
no stars will ever shine on me again
a perfect way to go - the wrong way is
all I know
no love for a burned out soul with no belief

you know deep inside we're not alike my
rage ain't nothing like yours
to overcome the thing I've done - you know
death needs a 'cause
to penetrate and infiltrate a
concrete founded mind
takes a man and not a boy - just decide if
you're willing to find home

standing on the edge of life
dreaming I'm beyond your control
standing on the edge of life
dreaming I'm beyond your hope

beyond hope - beyond belief
beyond all reason
