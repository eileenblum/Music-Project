you are lonely now my friend, 'cause every fire
burns out in the end

you say you feel betrayed by someone
who is beneath you
you say you feel devastated
nobody's ever touched your mind nor your heart
you'll never cry when someone's watching

Adrian

you are lonely now my friend, 'cause every fire
burns out in the end

even in the dark it seems you're hiding
from something
even in the daylight you're afraid
so don't say it - don't say it
you hope to die but you're afraid to

but you are dead

no time as the sun sets - no more decisions
no more regrets
a black tear from a snow white heart
the hand has been dealt and
you've played your card
Adrian - my long time friend
I guess it's over now - it's the end
no more smiles - no cheap thrills -
no more stories in the hills
don't cry it out - it's too late
you've had your chance - you had it made
there's no more sun for you

you won't tell and you won't say
you're dead
