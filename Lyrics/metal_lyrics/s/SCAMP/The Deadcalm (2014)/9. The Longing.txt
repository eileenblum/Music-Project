am I blind, am I afraid to be everything
I've ever dreamed of
well I don't even have the guts to see
if there's another sad person
going down like me
I'm standing in a pool of blood
and that's despair I fuckin' tell you
am I fading to infinity or just paralyzed
there's no ability

you say you don't give a fuck
what I do with my life
but won't you please look back and...

won't you wait for me ?
won't you wait for an old friend like me ?

in time - they say that time can heal you
but I'm already behind
all dark with a soul to see through
a mind to reach and a face to hate too
blood in my eyes so I can't cry with you
I'm not afraid that they'll see me
the wrong choice, but the right solution
hard effect that explode in confusion

you say you don't give a fuck
what I do with my life
but won't you please look back and...

won't you wait for me ?
won't you wait for an old friend like me ?

desperate times calls for desperate measures
and a desperate man that's what I am
no love to lean on - no friend to call on
no innocence to share at night

there's no sleep till peace is found
but my anxiety is bringing me down
a hard life, but life is hard
want to be idolized but I'm not

am I alone in here ?
am I alone in fear ?
all my time I spend waiting on something
I'll never be

you say you don't give a fuck
what I do with my life
but won't you please look back and...

won't you wait for me ?
won't you wait for an old friend like me ?
