it's just nothing - what's out there
lonely dreams and arrogant affairs
what we want ? we always want more
social inability - life's a bore

you're so bored

no relations to cure our lonely hearts
no restrictions will keep us locked
in boredom we act - in frenzy we stray
long live freedom - we threw it all away

what we said - was never meant to unfold
our worst enemy - was when the truth was told

burning skin, dead blue eyes
we live to kill, so afraid we are
can't go back now, we can't roam free 'cause
what we did was never told so
a poisoned mind, weak heart and soul
a night gone wrong, one wrong step
have no beliefs now and no regrets
the angry mob they just want to lynch us
Justice be done - no innocence
cannot hide, no where to go

for people like us
we're born weak - but with good intentions
strong - but with bad connections

so much went wrong, but we tried to do right
though every time we tried, we'd always
end up in a fight
look up to the sky - it's another shade of grey
it's the same damn love that we are missing
every day

what we don't see
while the rain just keeps on pouring
down on me
is all the hate
but I'm weak
I let the bad times hurt and my friends in need

inner fear - anxiety
when someone's standing next to me
read the line - never shine
it all become so clear
when we decide the goal is where we say it is
and the cold is just imaginary
ignorance I bliss
we lost time - a lost mind
we swallow in our misery
right now - right here
a lost love seemed oblivious
look into the mirror - always too hard on myself
are we trying hard enough to pull ourselves
out of hell
no belief - no relief
just an ever dying fantasy
reaching out - blacking out
where's the overload of ecstasy ?
every road we take it seems to lead nowhere
but every little dream is just another way
out of here

walls are craving in - the room is
getting smaller
the hole is getting deeper
walls are getting taller
it's all a blur - a blacked out hole
we couldn't lose it - 'cause we've never
had it all

what we said - was never meant to unfold
our worst enemy - was when the truth was told
