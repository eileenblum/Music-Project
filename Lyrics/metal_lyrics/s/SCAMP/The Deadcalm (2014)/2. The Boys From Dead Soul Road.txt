what they say you can trust - a memory
swept to dust
and you'll pay all you owed to the boys
from Dead Soul Road

right you are to just pull the trigger in an
overload of ecstasy
the train's coming - better jump or get on it
is there another way - another day
no time - no hesitation
over night you'll loose it all
for every move there's a bill to pay
for every night there's a game to play

what they say you can trust - a memory
swept to dust
and you'll pay all you owed to the boys
from Dead Soul Road

ignorant and arrogant - for every rise
there's a fall
extravagant - insane with hate
say another way - another day
mind blowing and stoked in love - you lost it all
a dead soul will come along to intervene
and cut you clean

you feel no pain you say ?
you'll feel this all the way
you're blinded

is that a tear I see - is that a heart
you won't sleep tonight, but you'll come apart
I swear - you'll come apart
I'll take you away from here - it's no way...
no way to live your life
empty with fear and dry of hope
it's cold though your blood is boiling...
open your mind

open you mind and fucking see what it's about
the truth and not your illusion
a second of love and a thousand tears
no other way - no other day
the very moment you crack the code is the
moment you will meet
the boys from Dad Soul Road

what they say you can trust - a memory
swept to dust
and you'll pay all you owed to the boys
from Dead Soul Road
