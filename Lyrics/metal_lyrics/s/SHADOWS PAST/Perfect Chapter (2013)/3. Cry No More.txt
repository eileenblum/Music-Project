I don't wanna live in this world, which we live in right now
Couldn't help but overhearing, that you think there's still time
I can't see myself in this world (buying time with crime)
That's why I'm getting up in the morning (to shorten my life)

Light in my eyes. Fool in disguise...

I don't care about the future, don't care about the past
Don't wanna be a slave in, this world that will not last
It will not last...

I don't wanna cry no more
Over this old land
The sky grows darker, darker day by day

Talking 'bout the short amount of time that we've been here
Look at all the damage we have done throughout the years
When will we learn to (accept all the facts)
Where we never seem to (stop the pollutions)
It will not last...

I don't wanna cry no more
Over this old land
The sky grows darker, darker day by day
