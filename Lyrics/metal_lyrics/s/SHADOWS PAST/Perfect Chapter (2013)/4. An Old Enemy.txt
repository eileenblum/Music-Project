I can imagine my life alone
A blue day like this, rainy and cold
But sometimes I feel like, I'm growing too old
Just walking through daytime, answers unfold

All the demons I have faced along the path
Still I fight the same old enemy with all my heart

Why can't you see, that I've changed my way
Though I still get mad, I will work my way through
My destinyâs calling, ain't calling for you
My power of reasoning, you're a fool!

For the promises I failed to realize
I will face my dark dominions, standing first in line
All the demons I have faced along the path
Still I fight the same old enemy with all my heart
