This unfaithful echo's deep inside
Sometimes inaccessible and hidden behind walls
Thin and unexpected (totally transparent)
A fake dissection, and now I turn away

Painful wounds that never heal, I feel them
Fear the sentence I'll receive
The scars run deep

Though I keep on searching for some answers in the void
Never seem to realize it's easy to move on
I deal with my soul (memories of sorrow)
Shameless and shallow, and now I turn away

Painful wounds that never heal, I feel them
Fear the sentence I'll receive
The scars run deep
