Do you, feel my life is real?
Strange kind of a magic dream
Some kind of stubborn resistance
makes me feel alone

Still I will find the reason to move on
and not stay blind, I'm done with those years
You will follow me always, forever free
Wherever I Go!

Can I put my trust in you?
And not be played like a fool
Some kind of stubborn resistance
makes me feel alone
And I know I'm falling
into my darkened soul again!

Still I will find the reason to move on
and not stay blind, I'm done with those years
You will follow me always, forever free
Wherever I Go!
