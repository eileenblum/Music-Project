From the dark caves of history
My old memories are, looking back at me
Oh how I fear them, I fear those times
They still haunt me, they pull me down

I can't believe what I have done to me
Don't understand why sorrow never leaves
I am trapped again, trapped inside my pain
And this karma thing won't let me be

Can't change what I've said
I can't change what I've done
No I can not turn back the time
But I'm trying to climb this ladder of life
To reach, the safe place in mind

I'm sick and tired of being in this world
All of the things that I have to learn
And if I learn them, how will they change me
Will I lose my own way to see things?
