I'm sick and tired of my life
Still I manage everything, that's a fact
I'm doing fine. Down on my knees

Grief and sorrows, all for more
Same story as I told before
I'm doing fine!

I'm still here, waiting in the wings
Never again, will I show you who I am

I can't handle the facts of life
Mourning when I see a friendly smile
I'm doing fine, down on my knees!
