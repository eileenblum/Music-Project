I ask you, this question I've always had
Do you believe in love?
You gave me, the answer "I still believe"
How can it be so?

We didn't make it, because we didn't trust our minds
Can I learn something from this, before I turn all blind?

Agony, makes me numb, and makes me bleed
'Cause I can't take the pain away
It won't be leaving me
But maybe if I turn away, maybe if you turn away...

How can you, go back to what you once had
That's not love for me
Do you believe that he's in love with you
Maybe you should put him to the wall

What can I do, when you don't seem to listen
To a single word I say...
