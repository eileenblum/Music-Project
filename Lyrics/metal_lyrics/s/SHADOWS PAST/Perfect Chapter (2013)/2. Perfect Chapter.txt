You read me like, an open book
Don't know just what to say
I try to use the same, same pages as you read
But the only thing I feel is greed

On and on, the story goes, but the end I fear

I know I am not the only one who's letting go
But I surely wish it wasn't so
I used to know you like, the perfect chapter
But now I will no more hear your laughter
If you only knew how much I miss you
Please turn back one page, 'cause I am a fool

On and on, the story goes, but the end I fear

I know I am not the only one who's letting go
But I surely wish it wasn't so
Turn another page again, and find out who I am
Still hopeful that we will meet again
