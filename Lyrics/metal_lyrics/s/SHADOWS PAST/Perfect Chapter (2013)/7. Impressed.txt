Every day I try to be
What I'm not instead of being me
If I asked you, would you dream along to save the song
Instead of leaving me alone?

I can impress a lot of people in many different ways
Wish though I could express myself in any other way

Stay, forever more, I'll try to find the bearing hand behind the black door
Try, to take my hand, and I'll try to hide my darkened soul washed out on the floors...

Is there another way to breathe?
Is there another way to feel so free?

I can express myself in any other way...

Stay, forever more, I'll try to find the bearing hand behind the black door
Try, to take my hand, and I'll try to hide my darkened soul washed out on the floors...
