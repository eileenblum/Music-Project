I hate you fall, always making me disbelieve
You never let me have a flow on life
Some of a few making themselves a decent deception
Me myself, on the other hand
I'm born and raised in perfection!

Why is it, you don't wanna face the truth?
Maybe it's because you're scared to realize
and sacrifice your life, you have built up so nice
Don't wanna throw it all away today...

I'm too scared to take my life from you
Please go on and help me
Why do I pray to the one over me
When I known you'll make my life a living hell!

We are losers, point the direction into perfection
We will go on, into each others fists!
If you do have, one little question, you could tell it to me
I will answer, as close as I can
