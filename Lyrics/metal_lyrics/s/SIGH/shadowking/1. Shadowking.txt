I've been killed for the thousandth times
Eternally, I hurt
My dead body's cold
I'm silent, do not make a sound
Nothing is real but how can you tell?
I am the king, I am the king, in my world!
My soul will never be saved
But I will dig my own grave
I will be your eternal slave
I will be your eternal slave

I am king in my world
I am death, I am life
I am the king of the shadows
I am hell, I am heaven

I've seen the light all through my life
I'm eternally dead, I'm eternally dead!
Though I know it's my fate
Living life with hate
I close my eyes
My soul has died

I am the king in my world
I am death, I am life
I am the king of the shadows
I am hell, I am heaven

I've seen the light all through my life
I'm eternally dead, I'm eternally dead!
Though I know it's my fate
Living life with hate
I close my eyes
My soul has died
