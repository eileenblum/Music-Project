The days of misfortune now have gone
I'll say goodbye to my miser
All the black dreams they belong to the the past
I'm ready to wear my divinity
You know it's a trip with no return
May infidel be your name
You are going to get what you deserve
Even if your soul will be scorched in flame
My condemned soul will be caged in
With all my memories to be annihilated
In my blood the seed is planted
The shame in fear won't change its fat
You know it's a trip with no return
Enter our hall of fame
You are going to get what you deserve
Even if your soul will be scorched in flame
Don't forget your soul belongs to us!
High on this fortress I'm standing tall
The calls from depth I will cleanse them all
In a world of ice I will crawl
In the shelter surrounded by the crimson walls
Don't forget your soul belongs to us
Pay the price. Please stop it!
