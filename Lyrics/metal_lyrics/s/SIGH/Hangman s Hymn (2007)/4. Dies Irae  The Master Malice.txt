I hear their call from beyond
O so near
O so far
I am so right
But I am so wrong
Where to go
When to go
All the sins are justified
Will they ever learn
Poisoned virtues want me tamed
Poisoned virtues want me burned
I know who I was and I will be soon
Sword of salvation slashes my soul
Only the lies will help me survive (in hell)
They poisoned my flesh
They poisoned my blood
I know who I was and I will be soon
Sword of salvation scorches my soul
Blame me if you want and set me free
They blinded my eyes
They deafened my ears
Glad to burn in hell
Come see me Master of Malice
Glad to be caught by a spell!
Come see me
Destroyer of the light
Glad to burn in hell!
And then come taste my blood
Glad to be caught by a spell!
And please praise all my sins!
Beyond my sorrow
Beyond my fear
Beasts are born so brave but blind
Beyond my shame
Beyond my tears
Beasts are born to fight their gods
Beyond my love. Beyond my hate
Beasts are born to bite my eyes
Beyond my anger
Beyond my thorns
Beast with horns will be born

[Guitar Solo by Rob Urbinati]

I am the one to deny the destiny
To deny the deliverance
I am the one to deride death
To divide their dreams
I don't need fear or I don't need shame
What's the point of salvation
when nobody will be saved?
I don't need fear or I don't need shame
Whats the point of salvation
when we all know where we're heading for?
Glad to burn in hell!
Something has died inside (of me)
Glad to be caught by a spell !
When I'm feeling so down
Glad to burn in hell!
How can you change me so deep?
Glad to be caught by a spell!
Hear my whine and see me weep
