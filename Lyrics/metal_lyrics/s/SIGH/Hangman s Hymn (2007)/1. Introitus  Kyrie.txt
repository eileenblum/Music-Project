Introitus

I, defier of the deliverance,
I, denier of the destiny,
I divide the golden path,
I deride the losers' wrath,

Let it be done!
I know what I have to do.
Why do you hesitate?
I know what I have to lose.
Let it be done!
It's time to change my fate.
Before it's too late!
Before it's too late!
Born again, born again!
What do you mean?
Born again, born again!
Please tell me!
Born again, born again!
Take what you will!
Born again, born again! You know what you have to lose!
I know what you have to lose!

Take me to your promised land,
I need to achieve my golden plan,
Take me to where you all stand,
I am ready to take my holy chance,

I, guilty for indulging all my lust,
I, guilty for discarding all my love,
I'll be reborn through the deadly kiss,
I'll be reborn for the eternal bliss,

I hold high infidelity,
I hold high inhumanity,
With the Midas Touch I seek,
For eternity I'll be free

Born again, born again!
I know I can't resist,
Born again, born again!
Yes, I'll be born again!
Born again, born again!
So take what you will!
Born again, born again! You know what you have to lose!
I know what you have to lose!
