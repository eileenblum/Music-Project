The skies are red, so are the dead,
Annihilation by incineration,
Fiery hell, the midnight funeral held,
As the black smokes reach the sky.
They shouted out,
I heard but I had to cover my ears,
Though my ears are already deafened by fears,
I still had to cover my ears.

They want it all, they'll take it all,
From the victim of reality,
Born cursed, raised in lies,
Though I'll die with bestiality,
They call it a sin, they call (it) a crime,
Even the stain of blood,
Fear the reaper, curse the deceivers with a spell,
See the cauldron in hell.

Do you believe what I tell you?
All my blood now swallowed in fire,
See my torment in my eyes that are dead,
See my torment in my lies, (oh) so bale!
Do you believe what I tell you?
In the soulless grave where nobody sleeps,
I fear the reaper,
I curse the deceivers,
But where is the curse?
Feel the fear's birth.

Do you think I'm the only one to be lost;
On the path they paved with the past?
Do you think I'm the only one to know;
The truth, few, or none has ever seen?
Do you think I'm the only one to go;
On the path they paved with their prey?
Do you think I'm the only one,
Do you think I'm the only one?

Die blind, death behind you will die,
In the scorching nightmare, the smoke fills the air,
A funeral in red, black are the dead,
Die blind, death behind you will die,
The fire storms everywhere,
The fear spreads to hell we're led.

Under their crooked claws,
Comes death, so cold and clean;
The ring-giver is now a bringer of disaster,
A bringer of misery, a bringer of misfortune.

They preyed my blood,
It's black and bleak,
It's the blood of (the) beast born just to feed,
I prey my heart to play my part,
I know it's just a fairytale untold in pain,
To breed the sheep and destroy the seeds,
The seeds that I sow I'll have to reap myself,
Forced to bleed to feed their greed,
This is a mass funeral in red!

Vice on virtue,
Victory on vanity,
Fire is so cold though my blood is boiling in my veins,
Vice on virtue,
Victory on vanity,
Answer me now,
I will laugh in pain.
