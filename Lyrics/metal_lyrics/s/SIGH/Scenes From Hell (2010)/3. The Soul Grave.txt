Standing brave, feeling proud even if enslaved, when my anger and rage burns,
I won't be saved.

This land of sins, forgotten in pain, may this be thy grave!
The skies are a red that is redder than blood,
Then blood starts to rain on this land of greed.

When I finally close my eyes,
I will see the truth,
When I finally speak the truth, the wisdom shall be born.

The reign of terror covers this land then all shall be my slave!
The skies are a red that is redder than blood,
Then blood starts to rain as you bleed.

Can you feel my regret in pain,
When the truth is denied, only the greed shall remain.

The soul grave,
The cold grave,
The soul grave,
The soul slave.
In the soul grave,
I shan't be saved,
In the soul grave,
I am a soul slave!

I will die not to die,
I will live not to live,
A life lives in death,
When a life dies in death,
Seek your way,
Your way to die,
Choose your way, your way to die,
I will die not to die,
I will live not to live,
I'm a sayer of the prayer,
I'm the prayer of the cursed,
I'm the prayer to die first.

Pain to gain, forever insane,
If darkness ever comes,
Praise the dark, the dark in vein,
Follow the blind, (the wisdom) you'll find.

This land of sins forgotten in pain belongs to none but the brave!
The skies are a red that is redder than blood,
Then blood starts to rain, your fate you await!
The skies are dark, as dark as death (that's) seeking its revenge,
Obedience in misery, never again,
Dawn of a victory.

Stranded and lose without any hope on the road to hell I'll pave,
The skies are a red that is redder than blood,
Then blood starts to rain on the land I (did) create!
