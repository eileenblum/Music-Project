I refuse to follow the path of the righteous
As I believe in the power of Izanagi
Forbidden knowledge I will unleash
My curse will last for eternity

The word is death, your own death is stalking you
Torment of hell, an infernal spell cast upon you
Trapped for eternity, it's your destiny
Your fate lies in the cruelty in my eyes

Kegare Sawari, the symbol of obscenity
In tales untold except in dread whispers
Eating your flesh and draining vitality
Travelling across the inverted river

Seven altars, seven stones
Seven hells, seven graves
12 dolls, 73 nails
Rokudougohei the inverted blade

Now I release all of my spite
Which lurks in the very depth of my being
Secret rite of Izanagi held at midnight
Calling forth names with ancient meaning

Cursed for eternity, where your soul will languish
Before Izanagi's power you fools are vanquished
Daiitoku rages from the three-sided altar
Making a straw doll to bring about your fall

DIE!

Vomiting blood you're condemned to hell,
the stake will seal the curse inside
In shoulders, shin and in the heart I impale the doll five times
May you and all your kin be annihilated by my curse
The light of life fades as the midnight rites are versed

Let the blood-flowers bloom
Burn, wither; your blood is red
Let the blood-flowers bloom
Torn to pieces; your blood is black
My spell will seal your fate

With all my malice and hate

FEAR!

Summoning Fudo to appear, Shikiouji
21, 33, 49 Izanagi

annihilation,

incineration,

Now the fatal seven keys are locked

Reincarnation of the infernal spirit

Now I release all of my spite
Which lurks in the very depth of my being
Secret rite of Izanagi held at midnight
Calling forth names with ancient meaning
