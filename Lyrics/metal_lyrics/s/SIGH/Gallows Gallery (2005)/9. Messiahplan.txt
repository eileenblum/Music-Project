I am coming home, home or was it (an) illusion
Death is soothing my life, soothing my death, I have been trapped

Born out of the emptiness (to which) song I will return
I'm coming home before I decay in this hell

I am coming home, home that fell in confusion
A lie is not a lie that used to be a lie, I have been trapped

I'll turn into (the) empiness, Yes, I shall be the one
I'm coming home before I decay in this hell

To the place now I cannot return, to the time now I cannot return
They become my knights but I'm coming home
They will take my life but I'm coming home

I am coming home, home full of delusion
I'm saving my soul, I'm killing myself, I have been trapped

Now I see the emptiness, I know their lives are old
I'm coming home before I decay in this hell
