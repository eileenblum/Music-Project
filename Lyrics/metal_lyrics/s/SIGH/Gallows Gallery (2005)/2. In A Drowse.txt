I'm going away from those beautiful days
In a drowse life of pain, in a drowse (I'm) going insane

I'll tear it away, (I) won't hear what they will say
In a drowse life in pain, In a drowse (I) live in vain

I walk into darkness that seems to last forever
In a drowse I'm a clown. In a drowse.
I indulge the bitterness, in sadness I endeavor
In a drowse I'm a clown. In a drwose.

I'm fading away upon this final stage
In a drowse life in pain. In a drowse (I'm) going insane

I'll tear it away, (I) won't hear what they will say
In a drowse life in pain
In a drowse (I) live in vain
