Years passed me by, but the way still not shown to me
Years passed me by, but the fear won't leave me be
In the prophet's dream, hate is love, death becomes life
And madness won't redeem, I'll need a wisdom they posess

To the fire To the wind To the earth
To the moon To the sun To myself

Remembrance scared me so, I had to embrace the dark within
Vowed divinity, let them know, let it begin
(I'll be) at one with the void when my breath turns into wind
(I'll be) at one with the void and my death becomes their sins
