O, will you ever, will you ever lean I did repent
O, will you ever, will you ever yearn for the end

(You're) just too young to know, too young to face it

Soul, once holy, now so guilty, awaiting to fall
(The) saint, once he was a savior, now a sinner, to bring it all

(You're) just too young to know, too young to face it
