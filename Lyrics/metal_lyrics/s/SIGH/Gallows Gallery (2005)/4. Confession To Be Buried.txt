(I) can't give a confession, As I can't live within silence
I don't need compassion to soothe me
I don't need a confession to soothe me, It confuses me

Tease me, Gods of sins, forgive me and tear my wings
Leave me or let me in, praise me for (the) song I sing

I don't believe in your filty death you fear
I don't believe in this life to be here
I don't believe in gods to judge me
I don't believe in hell to scortch me, (but) it scares me

I kill the light, I have a life, life that is gray
In a lie that is known to me

I bear the cross, I thought it lost, In a summer's frost
I will freeze to death

Confession must be heard, revelation you shall learn
Confession must be heard, in this hell you shall burn
