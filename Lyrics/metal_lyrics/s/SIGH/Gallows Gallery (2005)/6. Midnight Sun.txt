I've seen the midnight sun before I was born
Born of fire
I've seen the midnight sun, once death on the land forlorn
Forlorn in desire
I've seen the midnight sun, a shapeless unborn torn by a liar
I've seen the midnight sun, poisoned by its thorn it'll take my higher

Burn the midnight sun, so far away
Burn the midnight sun, from day to day

I've seen the midnight sun, pleasure to be done
Known in their tongue
I've seen the midnight sun a song to be sung
Sun in their tongue
