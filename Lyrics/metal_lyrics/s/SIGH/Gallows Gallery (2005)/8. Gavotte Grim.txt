One Autumn Night
Dark silent night,
Until the moment,
I will never forget,

The veil of death,
Over my places,
Did take them two,
The dying bodies I loved,

With my own fear,
I will disappear,
When devils sneer,
I will make it clear,

They speak to me,
So tenderly,
Lives that should be,
I will never see,
