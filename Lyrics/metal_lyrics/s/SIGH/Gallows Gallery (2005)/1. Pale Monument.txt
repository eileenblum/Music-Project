I close my eyes in the colored wind I used to feel
I close my eyes with an angel impaled that I have sealed
I gouged my eyes, so filthy as me, you cannot see
I gouged my eyes to not see what I have to see

See what is lost eternally, live in me
(I'm) trying to burn it al inside of me
Burn what is lost just in this place I used to be
(I'm) trying to burn it all.. it's killing me

I close my eyes in the colored wind I used to feel
I close my eyes with an angel impaled that I have sealed
I saw the light which used to be mine, I saw their sign
I saw the light that made me blind but still I am alive

See what is lost eternally, live in me
(I'm) trying to burn it al inside of me
Burn what is lost just in this place I used to be
(I'm) trying to burn it all.. it's killing me
