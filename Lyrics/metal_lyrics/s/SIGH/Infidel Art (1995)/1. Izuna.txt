Unto the unholy mountain of Izuna
Where all evil silently dwells
One hundred and twenty days of torment
Now I will enter into this hell

I can see it, I can hear it, I can feel it
Even though you will never sense it

The revelation of Lord Izunagongen
The fox of the skies, the fox of the earth
Breathing into the secret seals, for retribution
All my enemies shall be miserably cursed

I was chosen, I was given, I was bestowed
By our mighty Lord of Izuna

Daitenbaku, Shoutenbaku, vengeance from above
My avatar of hatred will crush them into pieces

Days of austerity, so bellicose, I shun the feeble
I am gazing in the face of power unknown
For I am sensing the flux invisible
From the blaze of death, read the epigram shown

The power from within the word itself
So flawless, how beautiful our lord is
The secret sign, summons destruction
Supremacy, the highest right of the gods
