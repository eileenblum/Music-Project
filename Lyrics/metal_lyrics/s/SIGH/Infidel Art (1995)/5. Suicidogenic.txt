We will help you die... I will do it before I go insane,
It kills all my pain, the most positive way to put it to an end,
No one shall take my life, I will use my own knife.

The second is the Byou, all the pain you've got,
All the sickness you suffer from, all the sorrow felt,
The Rou is the third, your fear of getting old,
You will lose your youth, your flesh will decay,
The fourth is the Shi, something you may fear
You live so you die, you never live again,
The Shou is the first, the cause of all your pain,
You live so you suffer, why don't you die?

Nothing but death can save from these three other ordeals,
Nothing will ever change, and I will be deranged

Deep silence, eternal darkness, discard all your hope,
Deep silence, eternal darkness, we all are destined to die!
