I am standing in the wilderness - looking up to the sky
I am thinking of the day - when I finally die
I can see my coffin burning - before my very eyes
I feel my soul slowly fade away - as I deeply sigh
Listen to my song of shadows - for my end
Oh, I will hail my destiny - my darkest friend
I am welcoming the tragedy - that will set me free
With my past, with my last elegy - inside of me

The wind doth weep, my eternal sleep, I am dying inside
The hopeless eyes, the mournful cries
The devoured light, I am rotting inside

I have no fear of death
The ravens are waiting for my final breath

The dignified death of which I am proud
Beneath the ebony cloud, I am shedding blood-tears
In my dream, I hear myself scream
Nothing to redeem, I am breeding my fear

Fear? what is to fear? Death isn't what I fear
How many days lie ahead of me?
Should I live with this dying body?
The shadow is slowly creeping
With awe inside as I'm sleeping
What a beautiful sight

I am listening to the silence - the unheard scream
I am losing my own past - in the darkest dream
Bleak is my mind, blind are my eyes - the internal death
Cold is my blood, as my misery - is put to an end
