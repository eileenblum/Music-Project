[Music: Mirai, Lyrics: BÃ¥rd Eithun]

My acquisition of an illusory defilement
Holy expurgation, tell me how values influence you
Measure of man and intrusive commandment
Compunction, is it all getting through?
I am Law, I am Right
Threshold of pain, like you ever lived in vain
Might is relative, might is right
Will to power, a goddamn fight
Well developed through Nitzschean conspiracy

[Hammond solo by Mirai]

Your God is omnipotent, why then indulgent?
Extinction of absolutes, sedentary idolatry sent
Through Dionysian worldview
Will be divided by reason, understood by few

I am Law, I am Right
Threshold of pain, like you ever lived in vain
Might is relative, might is right
Will to power, a goddamn fight
Well developed through Nitzschean conspiracy
