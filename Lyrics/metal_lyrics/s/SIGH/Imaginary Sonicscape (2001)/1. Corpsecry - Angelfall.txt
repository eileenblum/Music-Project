[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

[Minimoog Solo by Mirai]

Diabolic desire is burning so higher
Leading me to this place I may deserve this
The price I have to pay
For what I have done

Bloodstained is the glory of the days that are gone
The stories that are never told
So dread and cold
Tribulation for what I have done

Thousands of lost souls once innocent and pure
They are after me behind my back
Will death ever save me from this nightmare?

Until the moment my kingdom did fall in the
Illusion through my fear or my tears
Confession eternally sealed in my remorse

[Bridge:]
Scream for love, Scream for hate
Scream for life, Scream for death

[Chorus:]
Buried secret never touched
Insanity trapped in the curse
Hear the corpses cry!
Souls laid to rest
No place to hide
Next is my turn
Hear the corpses cry

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]

Souls that I've hunt haunt me
Now I've got no eyes to see
Murders justified by insanity
Souls never purified eternally

Diabolic desire is burning so higher
Leading me to this place

[Bridge:]
Scream for love, Scream for hate
Scream for life, Scream for death
I may deserve this
The price I have to pay
For what I have done

[Bridge:]
Scream for love, Scream for hate
Scream for life, Scream for death

[Chorus:]
Buried secret never touched
Insanity trapped in the curse
Head the corpses cry!
Souls to be laid to rest
No place to hide
Next is my turn
Hear the corpses cry!

If you think they're gone
Then I must say
Pestering Past is heard in the corpsecry
Laughter will be interrupted by the
Fear of their vengeance
Now I hear the corpses cry!

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]
