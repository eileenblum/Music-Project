[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

[Hammond solo by Mirai]

Primal impact in the sonic galaxy
Collapsed by beauty, collapsed into fury
Reached insanity beyond mortality
Astral infinity to find the reason to be

[Bridge:]
Through the eyes of a hawk I will see
The para-future when I'll be free
Through the eyes of a hawk I will see
Cosmic heaven where I will be

[Chorus:]
Help me, Help me please
I'm drowning in the middle of the dream
Hear my plea, hear me scream
I'm drowning in the middle of the dream

Waves of eternity in my heartbeat
Collapsed by beauty, collapsed into fury
Predicted destiny beyond my sanity
I will NEVER find the reason to be

[Bridge:]
Through the eyes of a hawk I will see
The para-future when I'll be free
Through the eyes of a hawk I will see
Cosmic heaven where I will be

[Chorus:]
Help me, Help me please
I'm drowning in the middle of the dream
Hear my plea, hear me scream
I'm drowning in the middle of the dream

[Minimoog solo by Mirai]

[Hammond solo by Mirai]

Return to the chaos, in the dreamsphere
Return to the chaos, dreams of the dead
Return to the chaos, dreams I fear
Return to the chaos, with no regrets
Return to the chaos, in the dreamsphere
Return to the chaos, in the sonicscape
Return to the chaos, dreams I fear
Return to the chaos, in the sonic chaos

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]
