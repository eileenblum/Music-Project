[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

[Female Chorus: Chie K.]

Please open my eye, the third eye
Please open my eye, I shan't deny
Please open my eye, scarlet lies
Please open my eye, I shan't defy

The pseudo deaths I've been going through
And remembrance of the past catches my soul
The truth is raped, Escape the world that I knew
And remembrance of this future catches my soul

Please open my eye, the third eye
Please open my eye, I am blind
Please open my eye, death inside
Please open my eye, it's so bright

Don't believe what you hear with your ears
Don't believe in the fate that you fear
I am blind but I know the truth is here
I am deaf but I know Revelation coming near

[Chorus:]
I am the Sun, I am the Moon
I'm living in the Scarlet Dream
Born in heaven and raised in hell
I'm wandering in the Scarlet Dream

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]

Please open my eye and it begins

[Minimoog solo by Mirai]

Please open my eye, the third eye
Please open my eye, I shan't deny
Please open my eye, scarlet lies
Please open my eye, I shan't defy

Soon I'll reach the sea of love behind the lies
Then I'll touch IT as the inner light guides
Don't be late, catch the words they try to hide
Don't belong to the world before your eyes
