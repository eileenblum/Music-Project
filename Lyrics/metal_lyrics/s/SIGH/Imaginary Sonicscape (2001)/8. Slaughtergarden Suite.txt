[Scene I: At Dawn]

[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

Serenity in a moonshine, blood red, celebration for the dead

Die at my slaughtergarden, My eyes won't succumb to your filthy lies
Die at my slaughtergarden, Bred in hate, full of drive to destroy

[Guitar solo by shinichi]

Sign of death with a heavy breath, monstrous visions, far beyond your imagination

Die at my slaughtergarden, My eyes won't succumb to your filthy lies
Die at my slaughtergarden, Bred in hate, full of drive to destroy

(Facing) absolute violence, Abominable sentence
Personal vengeance, beyond my tolerance
Accidental genocide, sacrifice my pride
Collision inside, destiny I divide
Never forewarned, Insanity's born
Darkened thorns, reason to be torn
I'll just let them know [x4]

[Scene II: The Dead Are Born]

[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

Existence cursed, abominable fate
Distorted lust armed with hate
Frozen emotions uncontrolled and caged
Vengeance rising in a deformed rage

Call me whatever you want
Cruel monster with a bloody hunger
Inhumane demon from beyond
(You'll) lie in a coffin six feet under

Vengeance to the world full of lies
Through the pain the victims suffer from
No mercy given to the chosen sacrifice
No love given as the beast (asleep) rises

Through the torture I will give
Through the pain, the reason to live
The dead are born against the light
The dead are born
The dead are born, to nobody
The dead are born, at night so bloody
The dead are born, through the pain
The dead are born, to live again

[Scene IV: Slaughtergarden]

[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

Die at my slaughtergarden, Say good-bye to your filth life
Die at my slaughtergarden, Vengeance to the world full of lives
Die at my slaughtergarden, Say good-bye to your filthy life
Die at my slaughtergarden, God is denied when my victim dies
