[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

Despise me, Deprive me of my Pride
(It) used to be my bride, When I cry, when I die
I'll be denied by my disguise
So vile...

My eyes, cold as ice
None shall overcome the horrible destiny
Sympathized but paralyzed
When identity is lost death may be the only way to ease me

[Fender Rhodes solo by Mirai]

Tear me apart til I die
Tear me apart, sacrifice
Tear me apart and hear my cry
Tear me apart to kill my pride

Something I'll have to lose
In return to reach the truth
Something I can't lose
Even if my death is abused
Something I'll have to lose
In return to reach the truth
Something I can't lose
Even if I'll never be soothed

I will never believe in those lies
Nothing sacred, Nothing divine
When pondering on the life fragile
Helpless resistance I will resign

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]

Finite is my life, still searching for my shrine
As long as I feel so scared
The mask which I wear, My fear is leading me nowhere
Now my life is a farce I cannot bear

Tear me apart till I die
Tear me apart, sacrifice
Tear me apart and hear my cry
Tear me apart to kill my pride

I don't need the dreams to believe in
As I know I'll never be relieved
As I see the fantasy is a deceit
As I know no one shares my grief

Despise me, Deprive me of my pride
(It) used to be my bride, When I cry, when I die...
I'll be denied by my disguise
And I wait for the sunset
Waiting for the sun to set
