[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

[Female Chorus: Chie K.]

Dancing to the ancient rhythm midnight
Come with me and I
Start to create a new life
It requires another death
Seeking for a pleasure through pain
Secret pleasure I gain
Nothing sane, nothing insane
Life requires another death

You have to realize that a creation of life is a creation of death
Midnight ritual, so sensual
One-way trip to heavenly bliss
Midnight funeral, so bestial
One-way trip with my deadly kiss

Ecstatic transformation, Anti-mass annihilation
Sensual reincarnation
Life requires another death
Easy mass procreation, Imaginary expiration
Constructive incineration
It requires another death

[Chorus:]
I'm always ready to come to heaven or hell if you'd call so
I'm always ready to loose the beast that can't be my foe

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]

Enthusiastic, you'll be the beast
Beautiful, lustful, I'll be the beast
Now I'm ready to feast
Life requires another death
Hypnotized by lust you scream
No love needed in the rite supreme
Ecstasy in this sanctuary so heavenly
Don't be afraid to destroy

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]

[Hammond solo by Mirai]
