[Music: Sigh, Lyrics:Mirai]

[Chorus: Yukito O., Hibiki K.]

Scream, I'm trying to scream, But will they hear my shriek?
Dream, or is it a dream? Resistance that is so weak
Visions turning red, confusion inside of my head

[Chorus:]
Now I see the light in the flame that is my burning pride
Drowning in the middle of the miserable dream
Nostalgia tears my flesh
Love was taught, Taught by death
Hate was sought, sought by life
Drowning in the middle of the miserable dream
But dream is fading away
Love was taught, Taught by death
Hate was sought, sought by life

Dying, am I dying? Will I be buried with my past?
Crying, I hear them crying, when my heart is beating so fast
Fears grown in my sight
The place where I'd hide

[Chorus:]
Now I see the light in the flame that is my burning pride
Drowning in the middle of the miserable dream
Nostalgia tears my flesh
Love was taught, Taught by death
Hate was sought, sought by life
Drowning in the middle of the miserable dream
But dream is fading away
Love was taught, Taught by death
Hate was sought, sought by life
