[Music: Sigh, Lyrics: Mirai]

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]

Once beloved now lost forever
Wings of Angel torn by malignance

Why wasn't it me?
Living in a shadow of death
I wish it was a dream

I won't believe in salvation, (I) shouldn't be saved
I wait for my condemnation in the cold flame
Repeated suicide in imagination, Watch the coward pray
Unexpected destination, a miserable slave

Die with a hope of live in despair
Death you're dying, Life you're losing
Spiritual suicide, Life I denied
Light the night divides, Pride I denied

[Bridge:]
Now I set a fire to cremate
The treasure that will never be the same
I won't wait for the fate, lost in this shade
Past will never change, too late to be saved

Life light as a feather, so is mine
Why wasn't it me when angel smiles
So I'll live on the lies when my conscience dies
How could I stand the slaughter in this paradise?

[Chorus:]
Bring Back the Dead, in this sorrow
Bring Back the Dead, regret will grow
Bring Back the Dead
As their voices get higher and the leading light glitters
Bring Back the Dead, Now I see
Bring Back the Dead, What it means
Bring Back the Dead
Until the moment my existence perishes in eternity

[Guitar solo by Shinichi]

Eternal regret I own't forget
What I want (is a) punishment, for the dead
Why wasn't it me
Living in a shadow of death
I wish it was a dream

I am the one who is guilty but I can't see
Nothing is the same as it used to be, silence is my plea
Helpless slave to destiny, I'll never be free
Shattered is my humanity, Eternally

Die with a hope or live in despair
Death you're dying, Life you're losing
Spiritual suicide, Life I denied
Light the night divides, Pride I denied

[Bridge:]
I have no future, for which I would live
I live in the dreadful past to forgive
My sin, spawned by inner feelings I have killed
I cry out of the loneliness to be filled
What I want is a punishment, demon inside of me
Now I see no way to embrace this reality
Now I see no reason for me to be
Suicidal words are chanted repeatedly

[Chorus:]
Bring Back the Dead, succumb to fate
Bring Back the Dead, that's what I hate
Bring Back the Dead
No matter what they say I'm the only one to blame
Bring Back the Dead, I'll watch them pray
Bring Back the Dead, We'll meet in the end
Bring Back the Dead
That is the only hope that can ease my eternal pain
Bring Back the Dead, to succumb to fate
Bring Back the Dead, that's what I hate
Bring Back the Dead
Now you're gone but I want to know what should be done
Bring Back the Dead, I'll watch them pray
Bring Back the Dead, What'd they say?
Bring Back the Dead
Though I know it's nothing more than death as a human...

[Hammond solo by Mirai]
