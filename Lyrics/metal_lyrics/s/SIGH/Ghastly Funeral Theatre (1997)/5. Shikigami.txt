I, I curse all who get in my way
I, I'll slay their very souls
I, I command the spirits to obey
I, I will let them die in woe

a parchment scroll or a piece of wood
I pour my life into them and become as one
there is no method of escape for them
spirits called by the dogs' blood spell hunt my enemies
exacting my vengeance on your feeble life

on your life...
shikigami

I, I let people fear my shikigami
I, I am jaki himself
I, I call upon abominable kegare
I, I will be the king

throw a paper bird to the south and it will fly true
for when the paper bird comes, it's the end of you
you will die in agonising pain
vermin will feed on your cold remains

feeling it coming from above, it will take you...
there is no way to break my curse...
