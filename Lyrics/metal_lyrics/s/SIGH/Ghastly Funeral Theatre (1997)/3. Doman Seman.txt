nine stars, nine palaces, my curse...

the symbol of death for you
(is) the symbol of power for me

nine letters, nine words, evil verse...

the sigil of doman empowers me
for you are the one who is doomed

five elements: fire, water, earth, gold and wood

five lords: north, south, east, west and centre

the sigil of seman enlightens me
for you will burn in the eternal flame

I point at the air and chant the mantra of destruction!

(my) violent desire rises from the depths of my darkened soul
evoking the storm that destroys everything, to black chaos I call

nine stars, nine palaces, my curse will kill
nine letters, nine words, evil verse will kill
five lords: north, south, east, west and centre
five elements: fire, water, earth, gold and wood.

fight: fly high - the doman, fly high - the seman

the sigil of doman filled with my hate, your fate is sealed
the sigil of seman burns with my anger, your life is doomed

in the middle of the night standing in the old shrine
feeling thousands of spirits crawls inside this body of mine
