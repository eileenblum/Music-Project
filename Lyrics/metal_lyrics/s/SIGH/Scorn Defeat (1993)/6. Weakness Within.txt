Change... my sin, weakness within,
Destruction of the body will begin, weakness within,

Touching their mind, weakness within,
The existence resigned, weakness within,

Lurking in the brain asleep, I'll win, weakness within,
Affected by the spirit, it'll bring weakness within,

Touching their mind, weakness within,
The existence resigned, weakness within,

(They'll) start to realize their power inside,
The change of the existence they once denied,
In remembrance 2000 years agom
Astral energy beyond now glows,
