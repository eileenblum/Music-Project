Seemingly locked behind endless eternity,
The avatar of evil is coming out of serenity,
Vioce that can't be voice is piercing through your deafened
ears,
The end is near, but death is not what you fear,

Even your existance the throbbing ground denies,
The only thing I know for sure is everything was just belied,
there is no more night or day, is it the price we have to pay?
Life is worthless, death must be the easiest way,

Please for me toll a knell,
Nothing can stop this painful yell,

In the blackened sky the moon is shining red,
Praying for a merciful end, we are all soon to be dead,
For the dying world who will toll a knell?
What more can I tell?

Even your existance the throbbing ground denies,
The only thing for sure is everything was just belied,
there is no more night or day, is it the price we have to pay?
What were you going to say? Death must be the easiest way,
