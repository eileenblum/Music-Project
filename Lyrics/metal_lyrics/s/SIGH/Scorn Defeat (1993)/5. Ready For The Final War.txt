See the plough show their destiny,
Disorder and chaos, let all the light disappear,
Lord god, prepare for our blasphemy,
The winged warriors take their black spears,
Five evil lords will finaly ascend,
Against the light vengeance now begins,
Reign of the light will soon come to an end,
To shambhala will all our sins,

Into the night of depths,
When rago shines into the skies,
They will regret, the tenth planet,
The king of destruction now has come,

A lunar eclipse on may 5th,
Mandala of stars telling the disaster,
Kongoyasha, fudo, gundali,
Daiituko and gouzanze,
Calling forth all the evil lords,
Now they're ready for the final war,
They take invincible swords,
Bow and arrow, hear their steel roar,

The ground trembling with the lightning and the thunder roar,
The moon is fading behind the black desire,
Gundali in the south, kongoyasha in the north,
Behind fudo flame of karura burning higher,
(Daiituko) spreading plague to kill all that stand left,
Under rago all this world is facing the catastrophe,
Into the nothingness where even the darkness can't exist,
So just cry in this debris...
