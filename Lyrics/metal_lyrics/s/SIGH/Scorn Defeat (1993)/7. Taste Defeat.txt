My fading will...
Mortal or immortal? It doesn't matter to me,
I've found the secret, I've found the key,
Death means nothing, life means less,
The key to go beyond it witch I possesse,
Deny the things in which you beleive,
God is as small! Death won't releive,

Listen to what I say,
You don't want to know what I say,

Who dare stand before me?
I am a son of eternity,
Give up your body to know,
The hidden truth that lets it go,
Forget those pseudo salvations,
Who needs worthless reincarnations?
O my lord in the shadow, please... show me the way,
The way,

Listen to what I say,
You don't want to know what I say,

Just leave it off, I'll see through those lies,
Give up your souls, the eternal (symbolic) eyes,
Leaving for the land where nothing dies,
Feeling no fear, the evil inside,

Your blinded eyes, now they will see,
What shall rise, and what will be,

Castle in the air which used to be real,
Now you can't tell just what was real,
All the faiths you had are falling down,
Taste of defeat, defeat of yourself,
