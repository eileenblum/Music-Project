So I've chosen death...
Hearing the mourners cry, seeing my body lie,
The symbolized iniquity, journey into eternity,
The funeral is for me, it is meant to be,

Calling of the moon...
My flesh will turn to dust, it's my lust,
Six words I'm going through,
The worst place I will be,

Under the full moon, at my funeral,
I'd leave here soon, at my funeral,
Recalling all my sins, at my funeral,
So my journey begins, at my funeral,

Leaving my body behind...
Seeing my coffin burn, this is what I yearn,
My funeral will end, and my soul will descend,
Into hades to burn, to scorn defeat...
