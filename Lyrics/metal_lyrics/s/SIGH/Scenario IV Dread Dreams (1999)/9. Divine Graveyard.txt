[Lyrics by Mirai]

Remembrance is carved in my cold blood
Instinct awakened in my inner depth so deep, you weep
Your life is mine, Your death belongs to me, You'll see
When the instinct awakened, insanity becomes sanity
Violent nature seeking for blood to be shed, as I said
What is the difference between me and them
Castrated and tamed, but you're the same
Killing game, horrible fame
Beg for my mercy, scream in fear
Cry for help they won't hear

In the name of the almighty God
Punish me, Deny me, Curse me if you can
In the name of the almighty God
Torture me, burn me, scorch me if you want

Behind a mask I am hunting your life, why was I born?
Behind peace I am ruling your death, Diabolic existence
I won't be chaineed any longer, I won't be tamed any longer, I will never
I will take what I want, I will take what I need, what I need!
Diabolic domination, Profanation, Evil insemination, Sworn desecration
Thirsty for blood, Thirsty for killing, Thirsty for death, Thristy for pain
