[Lyrics by Mirai]

All my misery and all my hate
All my regrets and all my fate
To my breast I'm holding them all
What you hear will be the executioner's call
All my blood and all my tears
All my anger and all my fears
To my breast I'm holding them all
What you fear will be the executioner's call

All my reasons and all my treason
All my illusions and all my disillusions
To my breast I'm holding them all
What you hear will be the executioner's call
Buried is my beautiful death and
Buried is my miserable life
My precious life was poisoned and then my death
My death will be raped

I was dreaming in the darkness when they called my name
Never save me please!
Rising is my vengeance when my death collides and life fades
Never save me please!
I was dreaming in the darkness when they called my name
Never save me please!
Rising is my vengeance it is DIABOLIC SUICIDE!
Never save me please!

Confusion starts to rise and
What I've done is a sin to win
Mercy isn't a key to me as
Light is in my hand and darkness is in my hand
When the candle burns out and
When the flame of life burns out
It's the beginning of the end
It's the beginning of the vengeance, my friend

Hidden feelings invoked, I'm choked, now I need a sacrifice
I will sacrifice myself to achieve my goal, time will come tonight
When another love is born and when another death is born
Souls will be torn, my thorn, and let them go
They're forgotten and forlorn
