[Lyrics by Damian and Mirai]

I am the demon, cold-blooded demon
Bloodthirsty, hateful and cruel
Controlled by something living in my head
I am the demon, miserable demon
Fire burns in my head
Nobody saves me, nobody can

Bloodcurdled scream, shrieks in my head
Another nightmare, another death
My mental terror, my endless pain
Where is my sanity or am I INSANE!!

War inside my head
Fire burns within
There's no end in sight
Neurotic state I'm in
Time to take my life
Summoning the end
Pistol to my head, but I fail!

There's no remorse, there's no sympathy
Just a broken life of misery
There's no escape, this fatal insanity
My soul is damned for all eternity

War inside my head
Fire burns within
There's no end in sight
Neurotic state I'm in
Time to take my life
Summoning the end
Pistol to my head, but I fail!

I'm screaming to be free again

To end this pain and suffering

I am the beast, I'm the slave of my mind
And I am condemned to this torment for life

Life becomes death as I'm approaching the time
And my mind will be brutally torn apart
Death becomes life as I'm crucifying myself
Crush my existence and burn my soul's scar

Death... is teh answer
Death... without remorse
Voices telling me to do it again
Voices screaming out my name

Do it right now
Do it right now
How could I save my soul when I was born just to die
How could I save my soul when I was born just to die

I'm screaming to be free again
To end this pain and suffering
I can't end this game
I'll wake to do it again
