[Lyrics by Mirai]

You deserve the Soul desert
The 4th desert, You will see
The 4th desert, the Blackened eyes
The 4th desert, You will see
The 4th desert, their final words

The Punishment, tribulation, the price you have to pay
Life beloved, life blessed now lost again for eternity

the warm blood that was shed is the symbol of their coldest death
What you have robbed is dignity of the precious life they bred

You deserve the Sould desert
The 4th desert, You will see
The 4th desert, the Blackened eyes
The 4th desert, You will see
The 4th desert, their final words

Night after night, haunted by its death your fear will never be soothed
Drained is the blood warm and red cold death which they won't choose

No tears left to shed when love was bred
No tears left to shed when the mind was dead

Come with us and see their bodies lie, Feel the fire in their eyes
Come with us and see their bodies lie, Hear their screams in the night

They do not need love anymore
They do not need hate anymore
You will never ever!
Subliminal hell surrounds you, now you scream!!!

Fire still burns in their eyes you won't forget their painful cries
Fire still burns in their eyes for your sin and you're gonna pay the price

It's a bloody sanctuary, bloody and so cold
It's a bloody sanctuary in the age of the gold
Silence falls onto their dreams, Dreams of the lost
Sacrificial funeral. Funeral of the past

So I insist...

Shattered hope, broken will, so still, the Sanctuary you will lose
Unexpected death which they won't choose
Your compassion they will refuse
