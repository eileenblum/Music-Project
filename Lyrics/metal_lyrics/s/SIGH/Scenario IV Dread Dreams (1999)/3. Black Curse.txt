[Lyrics by Taiki, translated to English by Mirai]

In the night of red moonlight
I will pray for you again tonight
Black candles, carved with your name
I'll light them now, the eternal flame

I am calling the Devil's name!

You will never hear God's voice here!

A black doll is tied up with invisible rope, malevolently unholy
And then you will lose yourself, in the dark, so slowly

You will soon find out

that you can't escape my BLACK CURSE

When this nightmare is over
You're buried
Six fee under you won't see anything
six feet under you won't hear anything

You are buried!
