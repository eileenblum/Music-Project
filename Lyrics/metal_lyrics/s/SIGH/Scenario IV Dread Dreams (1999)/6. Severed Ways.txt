[Lyrics by Kllljoy]

Prey on the helpless
Punish those different
Make them regret
Their own existence

Cannabalistic urge
Consummate the dead
Inferior way of life
The massacre spreads

Lover and victim
One and the same
Unholy ritual
Severed ways

Human waste displayed
Sickness wells up inside
Trying to kill a part of yourself
While the innocent die

When the terror is over
Images burn in our mind
The horrors committed
Live forever as a sign

Lover and victim
One and the same
Unholy ritual
Severed ways
