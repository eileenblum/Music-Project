in my head... the laughter comes again
and the voices that compel me to hunt
...to think the unthinkable...
...commit the unspeakable...

I wait for the dark, weapons at my side
talons of demons from which you can't hide
I look for prey as the night is falling
I smell their scent, their blood is calling

beyond all morality into insanity
I plunge my knife in you again and again
torture your corpse before it's cold
I seek to devour your life and soul

scream if you want no-one will hear you
all your tears will not save your life
your dying body will be mine to use
I cut out your weakness with my knife

through my blood shifts a hate I can't resist
take my vengeance on your naked corpse
I celebrate your death, (your) life extinguished
hail horror hail!

'kill for me, just kill for me'
every dark corner seems to know my name
the voices grow louder in their infamy
your fear is my pleasure, death is just a game

beyond all morality...

shall I hold your funeral?
cast petals upon your soft white breasts?
to settle amongst the dying blood
like all the rest, like all the rest...

the silence of the night shall be your requiem
there'll be only one mourner at your funeral
...I celebrate your death...
...as I lay you to rest...

the blood on my hands is a sign of divinity
I am not a beast, I am a god!
I'll rape your soul like your virginity
judgement will be done...

death is what I give, I need to live
to laugh at despair, to smile at grief
rejoice, I leave you no other choice
I have death's face, the devils voice
