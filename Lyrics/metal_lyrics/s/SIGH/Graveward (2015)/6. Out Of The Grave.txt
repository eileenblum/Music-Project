Surrounded by darkness and nothing I can see
No light, so night, but I know where I am
Hard to breathe, hard to scream
Lying in the coffin
Hard to breathe, hard to scream
I can hardly move

A smell of blood, a smell of death
Fear starts to grow inside, I had to hold my breath
A Fear of torment with a fear of death
I know death comes so slow, it's the second death

Out of the grave I must get
Out of the grave but it's too late
Out of the grave I must get
Out of the grave but I see no way

I'm choking on this fear, I'll die blind
Without being noticed
I'm going out of my mind
I hear the dead calling my name but what can I do?
I hear the dead calling my name, they're whispering to me

I'm gasping, but no one will hear me
I'm gasping, but no one will save me
I'm losing my sanity
I feel the dead wait for me

No hope is left
No time is left
Only a slow death I have to die awaits
So slow and so cruel, and it's full of pain
I just cannot stay sane
