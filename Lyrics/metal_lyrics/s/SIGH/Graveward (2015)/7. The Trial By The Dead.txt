Since I have tasted the thing called wisdom
Since I have touched the truth
Since I have met my destiny
My fear keeps growing inside of me

I wasn't aware that my eyes were shut
Before my time is through
Like plagues silently it spread
It will choke me until I'm dead

I'm on my own
So far away I have come

When I reached the land of bliss
The gate was already closed
Of Father Time, why don't you just let me walk out of this?
Why are you so cruel to me?

Since I have opened my eyes
Since I have stopped covering my ears
Since I have discarded my disguise
All I can do is breeding my fears

I stand all alone
So far away I had to come

I've been keeping walking alone
I know I have come too far
I've been keeping walking alone
I know there's no turning back

I live in a dream
Then I die in a dream

Do you know why I had to welcome my demons
With those dreams to be gone
Do you know why I had to welcome my demons
With those fears to be gone
