Woke up in a dream and I'm still in a dream
I'll never get out anyway
(I was) born in a dream then I live in a dream
(I'll) die in a dream any day
Please wait for me until I am ready
Ready to face the fate which I have to face
Please wait for me until I am ready
Ready to chase the fate which I have to chase

Into the pit of hell I'll fall
Lost is my glory still I recall
Into the pit of hell I'll fall
All of my pains I'll take them all

Let me out, Out of this dream
Let me out, I am living in
Let me out, I wish I had known that
I'd be a dweller in my own dream

Let me out, Out of this dream
Let me out, I am living in
Let me out, I have to let it done
But when I'm out, this world shall perish

Am I living in a dream or am I just dreaming
It does not matter as it's the same anyway
When I die in a dream, the dream will die
I can kill the dream, yes any day
The end of this dream is the end of this world
Destined to perish, destined to be forgotten
Before we see who the dreamer is
Before we see who the believers are

Let me out, Out of this dream
Let me out, I am living in
Let me out, I wish I had know that
I'd be a dweller in my own dream

Let me out, Out of this dream
Let me out, I am living in
Let me out, I have to let it done
I will take the whole world with me
