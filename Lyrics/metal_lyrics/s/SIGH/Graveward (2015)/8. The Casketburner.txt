Only the world within me changed
Nothing else, they all are the same
The sentence is death
It's the end of the game
The sentence is death
It's the end of my fame

Why me? Was it meant to be?
Remains with no soul is all I see
Please forgive my sins
All of my sins
Before my time in hell begins

My blood is running slow
Please don't let me go
But God told me so
The graves are vacant now

My casket burns
My casket burns
My casket burns
You watch it burn

My prayer won't be heard

Is this the silence I've been looking for
Is this the darkness I've been looking for
All the walls are now painted black
To show them that I was once alive

No one else feels my pain
Some day you will see
No one else feels my pain
You will see that you're the same

Why me? Was it meant to be?
Remains with no soul is all I see
Into the swamp my soul will sink
Wait for me, I need time to think

I did not want to know
I did not want to know
I did not want to know
The graves are vacant now

The Casketburner lights my casket
The Casketburner, the fate to met
The Casketburner, the fire to be set
The Casketburner burns my casket
Burn in this flame, turn in your grave
