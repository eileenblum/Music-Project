[I. The Message]

Pray for my soul
Then hang me please
Pray for my soul
Then angels weep

Who's to blame when it's all the same
Remember I'm not the only one to warn you
Behind the light, Crawls the night
I live like the dead then die like the living

What do you mean when you say you fear your fate?
What do you mean when you say you know it's too late?

I am so cold

Will you fear the day to come?
In the end blind I'll become
Will you fear the day to come?
In the end blind I'll become

Death is empty, Death is filthy
Death is cold, Death is somber
Death is eternal, Death is certain
Now the circle is closed
I wish I was innocent enough to believe in such a fantasy
I wish I was tamed enough to be pleased to keep living in this cage

I feel cold...

[II. Foreboding ]

[Instrumental]

[III. Doomsday]

Will you fear the day to come?
In the end blind I'll become
Like I was warned
What will it be?
How will it be?
