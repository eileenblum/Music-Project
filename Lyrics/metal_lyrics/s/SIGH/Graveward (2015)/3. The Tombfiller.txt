So many signs, the symbols of your end
You may have not noticed but here I am
I have been always with you since your birth
A birth of death, a birth to be cursed
You fear the night, now you fear the light
The light that blinds your innocent eyes
After your're gone, nothing will remain
Even your death shall perish in flame

Die, die, die, I'm a bringer of your fear
Die, die, die, my intention is clear
Die, die, die, you may die twice
But this is the first death you will die
Remember my  name, I'm a bringer of your disaster
Remember my face, It's time to face your master
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
So many times you have seen me

You know my name, you've heard my voice
You have seen me, you have seen what I did
But you don't know my face
Although you think you know it
It's too late to pray, too late to be saved
After your body rises from the grave
I am your curse, a curse on your birth
You should know I have been always with you
Once you're buried, there'll be no rebirth

Die, die, die, your time is running out
Die, die, die, as destined from the start
Die, die, die, your world to fall apart
After you're gone, nothing will remain

Ghosts around you, they died in scorching fire
Burned, burned, burned to death on funeral pyre
Once you're chosen, there will be no escape,
Your soul is taken, it will never be the same

The souls set free to rest in peace
The souls set free to be served as my feast
The hungry children I will feed
I'll come from behind when you expect the least
The souls set free to rest in peace
The souls set free to be served as my feast
The hungry children I will feed
I'll come from behind when you are blind

Let me be your eternal bride
Let me be your light so bright
Let me be your eyes inside
Let me be your fear in sight
