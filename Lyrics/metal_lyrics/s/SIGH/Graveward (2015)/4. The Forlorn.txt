My face so pale
My eyes so stale
My body so thin
My skin so grim

Can't you see me?
I'm standing here
Or can't you hear me?
I'm screaming out so loud

Lying on the bed
With the sign of the dead
Where am I?
People are weeping but why?
Who am I to see me die
Who am I to see them cry

Can't you see me?
I'm standing here
Or can't you hear me?
I'm screaming out so loud
I remember the nothing
I remember not a thing
What's happened to me?
What's happened to my body?

I am not dead!
My hearbeat still...
I am not dead!
I am here, I am gazing at myself
I am not dead!

Storms in my head
Oh if I am dead
Who am I to see me
Lying on the bed
I'm so cold, I am freezing in the dark
I'm so cold, I am shaking in the dark

Chained, maimed, tamed, and enslaved

My fading words, can't you hear
Yes it's me, I am here
I'm so cold, save my soul
Hear my plea, Save me please
