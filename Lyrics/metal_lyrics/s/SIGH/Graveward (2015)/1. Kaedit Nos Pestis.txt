Desecrators, here's our warning
You tamed like a sheep and chained up like a dog
You will never stand long, our justice will be done
You will never stand long, there is nowhere to run

Don't let them pave your way
Don't let them stand on your way
Don't let them hear what you say
Don't let them judge your day

You burned your book, soon you will burn yourself
You spiitted on your grave dug by slaves
You set a fire on your puny soul
You set a fire with your filthy blood

Don't let them steal your wrath
Don't let them feel your wrath
Don't let them guide your path
Don't let them light your path

Lost on your way to the dark
Your pain is all we see
Don't you ever play with fire
We were born in hell

We stand with our pride, our forces you'll never see
Now leave, the feeble filled with lies
With our black hammer we will smash your dream
Now leave, the feeble with no faith

Don't let them count your sins
Don't let them count you in
Don't let them rape your soul
Don't let them reap your soul

Lost on your way to the dark
You'll be cursed for eternity
No time to beg, no mercy given
We were born in hell

Faithless believers
Drown in your weakness
Shameless deceivers
Drown in your greed
