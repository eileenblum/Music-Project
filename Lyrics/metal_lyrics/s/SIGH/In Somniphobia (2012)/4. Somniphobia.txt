Nocturnal visions invade my sanity,

Colours I have never seen,
Shapes that should not have been,
My limbs that I am losing,
My mind this fear is confusing,
My sight, but I see with no eyes,
Mark my words, which now mean nothing but lies,
The world within my imagination,
(Going) through the transformation

Yes, you're a blind man,
Lost in the dark
You wish to wake but how?
Yes you're a blind man,
Caught in the cage,
You wish to find the way out.

The world as we know it,
I never doubted,

Stumbling on my only reward,
Do I belong to something,
that's not the same (any more) as it used to be,
Something (once) called an emotion,
I'm so sure that is long,
Much longer than my existence,
I'm so sure that is old,
Much older than our existence
