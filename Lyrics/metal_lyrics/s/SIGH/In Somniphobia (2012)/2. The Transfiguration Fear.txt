I can't believe what I have seen,
I'm not a fool to cling to the hope
It's a yoke which I have never asked for,

None shall break my silence,
None shall ever deny it,
Are you afraid of nothingness,
like I am?

No matter how much I'm screaming out for,
That is invisible and insensible,
Waiting for this moment,

(Chorus)
Into darkness you're falling,
Into (the) fire,
The end of torment I'm calling,
See the world, it's to disappear
Into darkness you're falling,
Into (the) fire,
The end of fear I'm calling,
Feel the world, it's to disappear

All I could do was to pray,
Though I know it won't pay,
Once caught in this dream, you'll never escape it,

Now the candle is burning out,
Destined from the beginning,
If it's a sin, I'll welcome it
Who shall bleed on it?
When you find it out, it's too late,
Waiting for this moment
Waiting for this torment
