A midnight frenzy,
We'll let it begin,
It's an unholy orgy,
So full of sins,
It's a rite in ecstasy
Not to be seen,
It's a filthy ecstasy
For our queen,

A heretic anthem we will sing,
Nightmare in the shape of a snake
with the two black wings
A chosen icon that was once called king
A filthy ecstasy they will bring
(To) a tell-tale symbol we will sing,
It's a symbol of fire, yes, fire!

In the dead of the night,
You will die tonight!

So be it!

Ring the bell,
Close the book,
Quench the candle,
We are born of fire!
