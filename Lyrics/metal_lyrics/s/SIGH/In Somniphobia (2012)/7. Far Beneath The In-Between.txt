Phantasmagoric visions behind my eyes
Cosmic voices echo deep in my mind
Ancient chanting in an alien tongue
Dementia transfer has now begun

Beyond the wall of sleep and dream
Nightmares crawling of shapeless things
I know not what I do to myself
I'm no longer in control of myself

Tentacles coiled around my brain
Invisible force drives me insane
Amorphous beings that are using me
To do such horrid ghastly things

[Chorus]
Far beneath the in-between
Can no one hear my cries - hear my screams
I know not what I do to myself
I'm no longer in control of myself

I am a vessel for these horrors to stir
Possessed by an evil not of this earth
Sadistic torment I commit in their names
Upon the innocent now caught in my wake

[Chorus]
I'm now -
Far beneath the in-between
Thru the threshold of these terrible dreams
So surreal is the blood I now spill
in the name of old gods that thrill to kill

Charming black slime
Twisting my mind
The demon star
Madness now born
