Amnesia, they call it, but, they don't know
what it is..
Please don't leave me alone,

My eyes glaze as my mind fades,
Save me from this never-ending hell,

They came from somewhere, somewhere else,
From the place we do not know,
Strange visions, now they grimmer,
As my memories become dimmer,

Don't tell me it's unholy,
Don't tell me it's so heavenly,
It'll come to me, though slowly,
It'll come to me, it scares me,

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that I'm losing my
head because
I saw it with my very eyes!

Ugly and completely unknown,
The sinister memories brought by
oblivion,
Fear me, hate me, torture me and
you'll kill me,
terrorize me,

Don't leave me alone,

No, I just can't escape myself,
Please don't leave me alone,
Trapped inside of myself,
Save me from this never-ending hell,

In a myth on in an endless dream
Fear of the unknown creeps behind me,
Remembrance is emerging in the brain-fever,
So hypnotic, so terrifying as my coma gets deeper
