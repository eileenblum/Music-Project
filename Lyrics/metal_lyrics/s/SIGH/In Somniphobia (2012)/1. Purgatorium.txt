What did you see in my eyes of eternity,
The illusion lies in the false serenity,
The evil seeds, they are to be sealed,
Forever in oblivion, not to be revealed,

I Live You Die
You Shall Know Why
I Live You Die
Your Life Is Mine

My words, my curse, my cries unheard,
My words, my curse, my lies to be learned,

Obsessed with dreams of madness,
They shine like stars above me,
The lies are piled in front of me,
I live, you die
Obsessed with dreams of madness,
They'll fall like stars above me,
The truth keeps whispering me,
I live, you die

(I feel) what is lost that used to be there for sure,
Struggling with no hope to walk out of this,
Surrounded by darkness that lasts forever,
Drowning in weakness built upon the deception,

Blame me now for what I have done,
Blame me now for what isn't done,
Blame me now for what I have done,
Blame me now for what is gone,

The repeated lies became the truth,
Facade in this fear I will soothe,
Ugliness (behind) beauty,
Truth behind lies,
Only the brave shall escape the curse to enslave
