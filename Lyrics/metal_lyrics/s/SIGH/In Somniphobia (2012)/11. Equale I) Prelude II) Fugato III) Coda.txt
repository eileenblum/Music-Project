[Prelude]
I am waiting,
But I am shaking,
I can't refuse it, I can't choose it,
When our God is there to abuse it,
I am gazing at the fear inside of me,
I am gazing at the fear that cleanses me,

[I]

[Chorus]
Kill me now, I don't need to plea,
Kill me now it's meant to be,
Kill me now if (it's) written in your story,
Kill me now I'll drown in my glory,

In the end only (the) sorrow waits
Today you're tamed tomorrow hook bait,
It's the end to which you have to cling,
It's the bliss that only death can bring,

I wish I'd keep on dreaming of
The past which I have to believe in,
I wish I'd keep on dreaming of
The past which (has) gone forever,
Maybe it's too late, now (only) the dark
awaits,
My fate, Their hate,
All my fear will turn to their tears,
All my fear, the means I hear,

[Chorus]
Kill me now, Until the fear fills me,
Kill me now, the glory I'll see
me now, To my fate I'll bow,
Kill me now, kill me now,

I had to see what I had to be,
Breathing through the sentence I get,
I am still yearning to be free,
Begging on my knees, I should be not,

[II]

I know it's nothing but a dream (in which)
I am let to live then die,
on what they give,
on what they design,

When I think of (my) fate to come,
I'll face the sentence I get from,
The fate, the method I'll succumb (to),
Blindly numb, I'll become,

Drowning in my pain and nothing to remain
Poison in my vein I'm striving in vain,
No one's divine, (I see) no sun to shine,
No use in crying when the salvation's mine,
Burning is my tongue,
Burning is my tomb,
Burning are my eyes,
Burning are my dreams,

Or is it nothing but a dream in which
I am let to live then die,
on what they give,
on what they design,

Now look at the reaper behind me,
I pray for my soul to be damned forever,
Until the moment they finally find me,

I pray for my soul to be damned forever,

Let me bleed on (this) endless nightmare,
Let me bleed on (this) flesh that I tear,
Let me bleed my own blood,
That is curse forever,

Omnia Vanitas, the reaper's there,
The believer's prayer is the deceiver's bane,
Omnia Vanitas, the redeemer's scare,
The believer's prayer is the deceiver's bane,

As I see their sign divine,
Life of mine will never shine,

[III]

We all are cursed,
By the curse none shall ever escape,
When we find it out,
It's too late,
There's nothing we can do,

Nothing but a farce,
Nothing but a one-night dream,
Or should I say nightmare,
We know it,
All of us,

I'm sorry but I have to go now...
