Buried in the tomb once filled with glory,
Fall to the thrall, it comes so slowly,
Defeat is in your eyes,
The old deceit now despised,

Once written, once warned,
The life to be torn and the lies to be scorned,
Shattered hope, shattered dream,
Was it a trap as it seemed,

You crawl then you fall to be a thrall,
Defeat in your eyes that is so gall,
Deceit in you lies, that is so gall,

Prepare yourself to be hammered in hell,
Or did you think you'd rule in heaven?
Keep on dreaming though you'll end up in
screaming (weeping)
With the vanity you sell,
Your fate on fire,

[Chorus]
FALL TO THE THRALL
Your fate is on fire, the trap behind you,
FALL TO THE THRALL
The bait for the liar, that will blind you,
FALL TO THE THRALL
Your fate is on fire that will blind you,
FALL TO THE THRALL
The bait for the liar, that will grind you,

Cruel fate you shall await
(But) You're deaf, you're blind
to the scythe behind
Defeat is in your eyes,
In this hell, you'll never survive,

Time to beg on your knees,
You bleed but none shall hear your plead,
You're lost, you've crossed the line of fire,
The fate you choose, the game you lose,
You crawl then you fall to be a thrall,
Defeat in your eyes, that is so gall,
Deceit in your lies, that is so gall,
