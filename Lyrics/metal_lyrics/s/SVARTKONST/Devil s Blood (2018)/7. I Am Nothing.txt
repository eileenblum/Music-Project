The will to leave it all behind
Just close your eyes, kill your mind
Let it go, numb yourself
Fuck it all, it's all in vain

O' You make me feel sublime
Rid these demons from my mind
Wizard of Doom just take my hand
Cast Your wicked spell on me

Higher, I get higher
I feel nothing, nothing at all
I am nothing, nothing at all
Almost reachable, yet I fall down

Close your eyes, kill the pain
See the void, numb yourself
Let it go, kill the pain
Fuck it all, it's all in vain
