Children of death, children of doom
Open up your hearts
For the burning light of darkness
For an endless night

The deeds of fire, will illuminate our path
With truth at the edge of our sword
We slice the throats of usurpers

Rise from the dark, into the light
We must destroy every deception in our sight

Ascend from the flames straight to the pit
Ferocious just like fire, we are the serpents spit
Pierce the sky, blades of truth
Black light burning, engulf the night
Serpent hearts shooting for the stars
Black light burning, no returning

Black light burning, engulf the night
