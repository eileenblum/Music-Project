The nectar of life, the essence of purity
Defiled and dried, tumbling, spiraling down

With broken bones, you drag along
The boiling sun will show no mercy
Plains of death, aimless wander
There is nothing to reap, there is nothing to seek

The fire burns inside these broken limbs
Ashen bones crumbling like sand
The drought is upon us all
As these hollow rivers run dry

Life abandoned
Giving way for the deadly sting of the scorpion
Abrasive winds of sand
Leaving nothing but oblivion behind
