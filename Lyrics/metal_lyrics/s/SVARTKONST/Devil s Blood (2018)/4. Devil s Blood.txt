Tear it up, tear it open
I watch you bleed, and you watch me

Rip it up, rip it out
The Devil's affliction, I'm in your grace

Tear it up, tear it open
I see you drown, my hands are tied

Rip it up, rip it out
Malevolent being, unholy revelation

They say that one day you will understand
As I am, helplessly, watching you die
The pale face, a fading light, this final night
Drop by drop it manifests, the Devil's blood
