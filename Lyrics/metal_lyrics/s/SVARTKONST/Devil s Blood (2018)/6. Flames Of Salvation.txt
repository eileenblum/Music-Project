Blighted thoughts have made their mark
A scorched and fragile husk remains
Blinded by fear, forlorn I fall
Hopelessness grasps my throat

A wretched but imminent path
Through fire I must tread for the cure

Affliction takes its hold
Oppression, succumb to the power
The fire burning eternal
Release me, the flames of salvation	

Twisted, burning roots, burrow through my spine
Paralyzed I stand in front of the faceless void

These marks will never fade
From the shackles around my wrists
I have swallowed the key to my freedom
Through fire I tread, my corrupted catharsis
