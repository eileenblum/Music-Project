An era of righteous murder
Condemned by unholy faith
Am I the wretched? Or salvation in disguise
A bloodless mender but a scholar of the black

The masses gather, famished are their souls
Ashen hunger like ember in their eyes
Heathen blood cleanses their thirst
Obscuring thoughts born from lies
We are disciples of the black

To feed their faithful demons
My death becomes a lie
The tide has failed me, the harvester is here
Screams of sorrow echoes through the night
The purge has begun

As the smoke rises high, blackening the sky
The reaper - hear my call, drawn to the light

Doubtful whispers in agony
Peaceful lies as my breath draws near

To keep obedience the circle will remain
To justify the means to our end
