Visions of death brooding at the gates
Gazing into the flames, burning my eyes
Scorch this fallen flesh, cleanse my soul

The enemy inside, burning the temple
A hail of arrows - pierce my skin
The enemy inside, my flesh my bones
Dead as nails, malignant disease

Curse my flesh, curse my bones
I drink my own blood, the taste of bitterness
Curse my heart, curse my soul
Staring into the mirror, the unknown staring back at me
