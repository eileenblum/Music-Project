I feel your relentless presence as a boiling fog
Staring wide-eyed upon the altar of destruction
With jaws infectious with unholy disease
Consume thy flesh, guide the blade of judgement

The final sweep of the axe
Beheaded snakes of Christ
Coagulated blood of lies
Lingers, it lingers no more
Cloven hoof, cloven tongues
Black moon for evermore

The time has come to awaken the raging beast
Hear my hymn, ascend from the darkest of depths
