Merciless Death, there's nothing left
God of Doom, it all ends soon

A part of me is dead, nothing as it seems
A part of me has died, none of this is real

Walls closing in, eaten from within
Life escaping me, death will set me free
Darkness from within, this battle I cannot win
Unavoidable doom, death will set me free

Every path it's all the same, every step and every way
Merciless Death, take my last breath
Wherever I may turn, my mind and body slowly burns
God of Doom, it's all too soon

I feel the cold strike through my bones and pierced by horns
My body's dying, there's no denying my crown of thorns
I feel so old but yet so young, what have I become
My flesh turns rotten, will I be forgotten
My dying time has come
