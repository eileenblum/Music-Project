Since December, I have been living in this dream
I remember a morning dressed in screams
Since December, nothing is really what it seems
From the embers of a heart and grinding teeth.

Kill me like a river
Drag me with your stream
Strike me from the mirror
Visit me in dreams
Leave me when I need you
Come when you're unseen
When I think about you
Nothing's what it seemsâ¦

Since December, your face is fading in the grey
Can't remember the sounds of things you say
Since December, my tears are fading in the rain
Your descendants, left to deal with pain.

Kill me like a river
Drag me with your stream
Strike me from the mirror
Visit me in dreams
Leave me when I need you
Come when you're unseen
When I think about you
Nothing's what it seemsâ¦
