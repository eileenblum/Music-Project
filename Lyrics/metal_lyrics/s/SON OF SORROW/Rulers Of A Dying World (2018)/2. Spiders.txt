Whispering the words
That will find you
Line you up to take care of me
Gone I am; the breeze!
It comes for you, it speaks to me

And it takes no more than this
In the shadow there's a hiss
And I feel the darkness here within
And the spiders on my skin

Feeding from the grief
Of a 1,000 lies
You shared with me way to soon
Gone I am; the sins!
Magnifying, please stop cryingâ¦

And it takes no more than this
In the shadow there's a hiss
And I feel the darkness here within
And the spiders on my skin

Heaven, take me from this web
Heaven, free me â take my soul
It's a reason to implode
No escape from this black hole

And it takes no more than this
In the shadow there's a hiss
And I feel the darkness here within
And the spiders on my skin
