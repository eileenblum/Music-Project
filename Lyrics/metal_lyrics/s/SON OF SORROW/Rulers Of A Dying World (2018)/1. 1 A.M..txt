Castles in the air, another day goes by
But I can't stand here simply seeing day goes by
I know the dreams I had and know they're not like this
But I can't stand here, then simply ignore the blissâ¦

All I want is never here
Things I cherished things I feared
Break this skin and bring me home:
Chill my bones!

I am the one
That lingers in the night
At 1 AM my deepest sins now seem to fight
I am the one
That made will from a might
At 1 AM my deepest sins now seems so bright

Don't have the face, the style, the weight, the voice, the age
But I won't stay still and not bring this to the stage
I cast away the dreams to see what I became
One direction that brings me into the flamesâ¦

All I want is never here
Things I cherished things I feared
Break this skin and bring me home:
Chill my bones!

I am the one
That lingers in the night
At 1 AM my deepest sins now seem to fight
I am the one
That made will from a might
At 1 AM my deepest sins now seems so brightâ¦
