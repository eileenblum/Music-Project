Fill the void her father left her with
When he ran away
Going all the way to see
The things that lift her feet

To try something before her eyes
To see if she won't go
I know it served her well that time
But now the sky is grey

She's sinking in monotony
The ropes won't let her go
I hurt myself by promising
I'd love to see her go
Seething in monogamy
Her heart is almost gone
And it goes, and it goes and it goes and it goes onâ¦

Just to get, just to get a piece of you
Don't forget the dirty things you had me do, so
Just to get, just to get a piece of you and
Don't forget the empty shell you left me with.

Feel, the emptiness inside of me
For following your pace
You twisted me in such a way it
Felt like crying on your face

Is it frozen deep inside you?
Can I bring you to this place?
A place where it is you and me
There's nothing else you need
"It's flesh and blood you told me"
But I know that inside
In the void, if you try and you cry you can find meâ¦

Just to get, just to get a piece of you
Don't forget the dirty things you had me do, so
Just to get, just to get a piece of you and
Don't forget the empty shell you left me with.
