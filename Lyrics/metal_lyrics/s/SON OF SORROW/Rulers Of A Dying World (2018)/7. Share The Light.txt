I closed my eyes
and lay pretending
everything is fine
Try to deny
that we're descending:
never cross the line

We became three
Love never-ending
Takes its toll in time
Despite the joy
And the breaths taken
I've been missing you

And now that darkness comes and horror is skin-deep
Around me all the shades are dancing
They haunt me in my sleep but then I see your face
and then we share the light: silence.

We are two souls
Growing too old
damaged control
but we have shown
That we can strive
we never falter
that we are the light

And now that darkness comes and horror is skin-deep
Around me all the shades are dancing
They haunt me in my sleep but then I see your face
and then we share the light: silence.

Days go by
won't denyâ¦
that I lose control
Sometimes I
Want to... break!
