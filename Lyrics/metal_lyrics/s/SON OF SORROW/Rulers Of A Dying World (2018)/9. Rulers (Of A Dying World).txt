One decision,
No precision
For the targets that the promise held.
World is scary,
From the aerie
Life is managed as the sun is set

There's a fly and it cries as it sees that its fate is sealed
And the prey tries to pray as it's tied in this eerie silk
And the master that slays, starts to play, and it feeds it milk
'Cause to feed what you eat doesn't mean that you're free from greed

We are a million
People at once
We are the ones that
Prayed to the sun
We are legion
Allegiance to none
We are the ones that
Wait for the One

Every day is a game to play
End the reign, come the rain that saves us!

We are a million
People at once
We are the ones that
Prayed to the sun
We are legion
Allegiance to none
We are the ones that
Wait for the One
