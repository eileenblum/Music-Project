You live your life pretending
everything is fine.
You speak your lies defending
that you're always right.
Empty and hollow, gazing
in the depths of time:
And you feel it arrive, and you don't know that I'mâ¦

Always, always here
Always, through pain and fear
Always, always here
Always, to dry your tears

A faceless execution
of a soul denied
of the only salvation
ever known as right.
Your lifeless shell is crumbling
in the maze of life,
but you still feel alive, don't worry because I'mâ¦

Always, always here
Always, through pain and fear
Always, always here
Always, to dry your tears
