A forgone memory of silence at the heart
Of living sentiments hidden by the dark
Of settling sands that speak of voices now unheard
Of setting suns that fadeâ¦

Long live destiny
Bringer of the truth, slayer of the truce
Long for thy remedies
for the tomb of Ruth, journey through the night.

I whisper to the silence in my mind
I whisper. Hear the void that's left behind
I whisper. Procrastinate denial
In this winterâ¦

A lone, lost enemy has broken through the veil
to lands of mirrors that echo we're the same
he sparks the light of change, engulf the life in flames
pyrocumulus, insane

Long live destiny
Bringer of the truth, slayer of the truce
Long for thy remedies
for the tomb of Ruth, journey through the night.

I whisper to the silence in my mind
I whisper. Hear the void that's left behind
I whisper. Procrastinate denial
In this winterâ¦

Faith in extinction
Faith in extinction
There's no distinction
Faith in extinction
