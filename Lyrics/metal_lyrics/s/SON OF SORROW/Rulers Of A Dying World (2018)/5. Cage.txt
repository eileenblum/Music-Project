We're living in a rotting cage
It fades away just as we age
It doesn't matter to which god you pray.

We're living in a rotting cage
And every day we turn a page
It doesn't matter what you do or say.

You're tall, you're small
You think you're great
You're full of love, you stink of hate
But you'll all queue
Knocking at the gates.

You think you're here
'Cause there's a plan
That we're looping in a coil
But then your loved ones
Sleep in beds of soil.

On and on your life goes on
Ignore the writings on the wall
The end is nigh but you are high
On life, behold:

The things that mattered are exposed
When your body is disposed
And the things you cherished most
Are gone.
