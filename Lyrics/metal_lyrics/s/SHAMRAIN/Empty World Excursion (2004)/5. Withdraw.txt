i cannot sleep
and the night comes
always darker
a thin threatening sound
i cannot recognize
long gone is the world
you live in
so hard to remember
the colours of the sky

countless days here inside
reality is drifting away
i feel like choking and I donât know how
how to make through one more day

i cannot see
how i got here
to point of no return
the memories lie
so far away from me
long gone is the world
you live in
so hard to remember
the colours of the sky

the world is dead to me
so I close myself in
apart from reality
i'll give in
