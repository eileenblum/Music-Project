things will never be the same
what i had i'll never find again
you took it all away from me
all my will to live

i hear you but i won't let you in
i hear you cry and whine something

there is so much what i regret
there is so much what i would change

i will never find a way
i feel i failed again
i tear apart and i collapse
with nothing more to give
