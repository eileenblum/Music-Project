Touch her eyes
Close them now
Let the night
finally fall
Everlasting flow
of pictures and
fading memories
now wither away

And in my dream
I saw a figure motion my way
Spreading it's wings
to wave

Everlasting flow
of pictures and
craving memories
never wither away
Close her eyes
It ends now
as the night
finally falls

And in my dream
I saw a figure motion my way
Spreading it's wings
to wave goodbye
