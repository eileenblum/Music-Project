It's still like a dream
the worst nightmare
that I've ever seen
Only this time's for real
This time's for real

I have to do this on my own
lay you down into your eternity
I try to keep you alive
in memories, deep inside
I try to keep you alive
I can't let go, can't let go

All of my love
it died with you
and all my dreams
can now ever be true
They died with you

I would give anything
if I could once more see your face
I would give my everything
if I could once more feel your embrace
