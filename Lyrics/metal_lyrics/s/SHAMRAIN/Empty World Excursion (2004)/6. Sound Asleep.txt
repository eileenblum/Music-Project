While whole world was asleep
you stayed awake
to sing a lullaby
for us all

While whole world was asleep
everything changed
in a trice
The breaking dawn turned
back into night

Quiet is the air now
as if we all
had stopped breathing
Quiet is the world now
as if we all
had stopped feeling

And pale white
snow came down
