Speak to me now
Share a few words
Distant echoes into my isolated world
From your mute coldness
give me a prayer
of something better

In my dreams
I feel helpless
You draw your claws
to tear off my eyes
Push me aside
with an absent smile
Your look
a stabwound in my heart

And when I saw you standing there
for the last time
So fragile you were
Then I saw right through your eyes
Saw what you hide
