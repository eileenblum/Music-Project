Distant you are
A soul unattainable
and most delicate of all
Evermore hiding
Behind an unseen veil
That closes off our heaven

I want to feel, what you feel inside
Your world I want, to unite with mine
I want to see, the secrets you hide
Your world I want, to unite with mine

Unspoken you are
Remote and soundless
Frail behind your wall
Evermore floating
Deeper into the night
That closes off our heaven
