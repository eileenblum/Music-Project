You live inside a dream
You hide from the life
Inside a fragile shell
I hear a silent cry

All light escapes
a void behind windows
In their eyes blind
I blend with gloom
I cannot stay
I'm a stain on your facades
In your small world
my faith is doomed

You cut me with
your fingers razorsharp
as you try to show
just how much you love

All light escapes
a void behind windows
In their eyes blind
I blend with gloom
I cannot stay
I'm a stain on your facades
In your small world
my faith is doomed

Deep inside I know
You'll always conceal
A wish impossible
You're not coming back
