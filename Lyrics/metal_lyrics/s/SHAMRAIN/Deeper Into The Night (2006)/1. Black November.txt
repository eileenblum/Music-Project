Within this quiet room
Sleep is only an illusion
Silence falls over the roof
Black november swallows all the light

Behind dazed eyes
My heart bleeds
Behind dazed eyes
I can't feel anymore

Within this inert season
Painful memories take hold
Shadows wind in each other
Silent figures on the wall

Behind dazed eyes
My heart bleeds
Behind dazed eyes
I can't feel anymore

Smiling in an old photograph
I don't remember how that felt
A face of a stranger
Smiling in an old photograph
Am I still here?
