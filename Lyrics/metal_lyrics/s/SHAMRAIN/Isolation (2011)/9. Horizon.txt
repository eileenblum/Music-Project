In the evening
The figures are moving
Blood rushes to my head
It becomes harder to accept
The person I am becoming

How can we be free
There's nobody on our side
There's no more desire, reasons
The dark stains mark the mind
Black horizon welcomes
The horrors of the night

In the core of the soil
They are waiting
I hope you could wake me up
When the time is near
In the evening
The figures are moving

How can we be free
There's nobody on our side
There's no more desire, reasons
The dark stains mark the mind
Black horizon welcomes
The horrors of the night
