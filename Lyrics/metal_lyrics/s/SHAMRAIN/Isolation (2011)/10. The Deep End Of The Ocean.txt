Wailful has the world become
Ever since you went away
Alone in our haven
You gave yourself to the waves
Day after day
I follow you to the shore
Dazed by the enticing calls
The deep awaits

For you I endow my devotion
All I have left within
For you, the deep end of the ocean
For you, I give my life
All my scars
All this useless time
