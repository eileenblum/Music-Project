Quiet down the noise
Cloud the shine that blinds
All confusing words
Turning my mind
Entangled and strange
I'm falling
I'm falling over the edge

Slow me down
I cannot stay still
Slow the world down
With all this tension
I cannot hold on

Worn-out and useless
Veins filled with rush
When all the light's gone
I can't hush up
I'm breaking through the door
I'm falling
I'm running into evenfall

Slow me down
I cannot stay still
Slow the world down
With all this tension
I cannot hold on

Lift me up
I'm down in a hole
Take me back to the room
Where I belong
To start over again
Over and over only to fall
Down once more

Slow me down
Extinguish these flames
Slow me down
I'm fading away
Slow me down
I'm too much alive
Slow me down
I stay aside
I apologize
