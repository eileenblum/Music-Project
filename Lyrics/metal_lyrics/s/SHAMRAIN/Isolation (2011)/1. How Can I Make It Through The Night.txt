Walls coming onto me
The veils are closing
If only I could go outside
Don't want to sleep tonight
No more distracting dreams
Blank eyes staring

How can I make it through the night?

Behind the window
Strangers talking
Lovers walking
In this morning
I can't make a sound
World outside
A distant memory
I have withdrawn

How can I make it through the night?
