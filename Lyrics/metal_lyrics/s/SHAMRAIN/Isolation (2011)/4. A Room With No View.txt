White bright circles
Under the eyelids
They've come to take me
I shiver, what do they speak?
I do not know

These violent dreams
I'm so afraid
No way back
In a room with no view

Now I'm older, you've stayed still
A permanent state
I wanted to tell
How it started
I could not tell
That I don't remember

These violent dreams
I'm so afraid
No way back
In a room with no view

Another day
Behind these doors
Another day
And stranger we become
