You name it
I have them all
I haven't slept in two days
I've been too scared
Of all the terror that awaits
Makes me gasp for air

Noise outside
Keeping me awake
It's the call of an endless rain
Noise outside
Keeping me awake
Everything as it has
Always been

Fly with birds
The pure white doves
Leave the darkness underneath
This world I do not understand anymore

Noise outside
Keeping me awake
It's the call of an endless rain
Noise outside
Keeping me awake
Everything as it has
Always been
