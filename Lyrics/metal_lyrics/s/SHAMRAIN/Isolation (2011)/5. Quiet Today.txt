I remember that night
Like from another life
Behind the shroud
Bounding me outside
The air is cool
My mind on a journey

It is quiet today
Like it was yesterday
And the day before
The artificial lights
Are hurting my eyes

I remember that night
It was from my past life
Little did I know
What was to happen
In lives to come
The air is cool
My body like a cage

It is quiet today
Like it was yesterday
And the day before
The artificial lights
Are hurting my eyes
It is quiet today
In this world
Painted white
Within the crowd
The artificial lights
hurt my eyes

Endless late april days
The words are all worn out
Nothing much to do today
The dreams of you are forever
