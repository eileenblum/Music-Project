Small halos dance
On rain soaked trees
Waiting to fall
With the last leaves
I try to catch them
All my desires slowly flow away
With the last leaves into a stream
Into an ocean of my banished dreams

Distant echoes grow
I can see the glow
Behind shadows
Chase the clouds away

You stargaze
Dreams for the blind
Long and fear
In a play surreal
I'm not here
With you anymore
In reveries
You are drowning

Distant echoes grow
I can see the glow
Behind shadows
Chase the clouds away
