Haunting eyes
Shine in the dark
Ghosts of bygone haze
Become alive
And we count the days
Until twilight

In my dreams I see birds falling down
In my dreams I see trees burning to the ground
And all the people befall a heartsore fate

Fading light
Blends with the gloom
If only my dreams weren't true
Not this time
And we could stay here
Pass this night

In my dreams I see birds falling down
In my dreams I see trees burning to the ground
And all the people befall a heartsore fate
