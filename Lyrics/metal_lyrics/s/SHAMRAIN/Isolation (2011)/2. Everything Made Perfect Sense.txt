Slipping in and out of
Going back and forth through
Consciousness
Is this where I should go
Floating out of window
Should I stay

My guideline is missing
Moments don't make
Much sense to me now
Speaking in the distance
Sirens go all silent
Please save me

We drove up the hill
Among the people
We drove up the hill
Among the animals
I felt light and
The fear was gone
Everything made perfect sense
