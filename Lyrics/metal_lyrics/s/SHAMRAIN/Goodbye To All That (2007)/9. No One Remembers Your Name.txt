Alone
As we are
Among millions
Living in haze
In here no one cares
And no one remembers your name
Escape all this
There must be a place
Where birds still sing
Escape all this
There must be a place
Where vanished beauty
Lies within

Helpless as we are
There is no use
To beg for relief
In here no one listens
No one hears your voice

Maybe there's someone
Who remembers your name

Alone as we are
Among millions
Maybe someone remembers your name
