Where are you now?
Thought I heard your voice
Like outside of all time
Thought I saw your shape
Here near by me
It happens all the time
I guess you're out there somewhere
Today I remembered your (sad) smile
And how it used to be before

We dream of an ocean
Once bloomed in our hearts
The words are dead now
She haunts me apart

You came and stayed
Slept through the days
Carried a fragile mind
Season of woe
Dwelled too deep
And didn't let you go

We dream of an ocean
Once bloomed in our hearts
The words are dead now
She haunts me apart
