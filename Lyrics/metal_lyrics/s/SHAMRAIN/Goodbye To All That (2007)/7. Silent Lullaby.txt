Your eyes staring glazed
Vitality you fell to waste
Is it ever coming back?
Itâs stained and disgraced

Reveal your endless hate
You're not the only one in pain
Under pouring rain
A life under pouring rain

Lay inert all day
Without desires
Pass out mesmerized
To the sound of silent lullabies

Words scribbled down
In distress and in haste
Plain white pages
Stained and disgraced

Reveal your endless hate
You're not the only one in pain
Under pouring rain
A life under pouring rain

Lay inert all day
Without desires
Pass out mesmerized
To the sound of silent lullabies
Inside those walls
No one will ever find you
