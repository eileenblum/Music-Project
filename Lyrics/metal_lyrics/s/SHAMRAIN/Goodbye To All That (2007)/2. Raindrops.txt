The light is bleeding out of me
I can't close my eyes
When tomorrow comes what's left of me?
Is this the road I have to take?
Why won't you come and save me
From this place today?

I bend my head down
Close my sight out
And I hear the sound of raindrops
On the window glass again

Once it all was different
Life has grown colder by the time
And it's all confusing up my mind
Is this the road I have to take?
Why won't you come and save me
From this place today?

I bend my head down
Close my sight out
And I hear the sound of raindrops
On the window glass again
