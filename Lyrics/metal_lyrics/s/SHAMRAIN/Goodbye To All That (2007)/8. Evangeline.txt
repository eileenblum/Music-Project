Crying faces stare
Faith forsaken eyes
Sending silent pleas
Crying faces stare
Through my skin
Into my heart

In these secret rooms
Forsaken souls
Hide in their graves
They pounder in a rush
Screaming for a life
That never was

Leave, you must leave now
When they come
Your soul will be killed
Leave, I will help you leave now
When they come
They'll leave with your will

Close your eyes
I have the key
Give me your hand
It only hurts a little while
And you will float
Cross the gardens and skies
Into a home that never was
And will never be
