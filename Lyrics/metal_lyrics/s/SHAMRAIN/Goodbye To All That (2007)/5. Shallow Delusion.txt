In the corner of the room
Creatures smile shallow
Shrouded faces shine no warmth
Shapeless reflections
Haunting my wasted eyes
I shiver with poison
Seeping through my skin
Every moment slipping away

At the doorway of the room
Inanition shines hollow
I'm falling into a black hole
Strangling cold hands
Stealing the air tonight
I dangle blindfolded
Reaping the strings
Every second soaring away

Screaming out loud
Waking the dead
With an end
Silent night arrives
It's coming
Death has no sound
