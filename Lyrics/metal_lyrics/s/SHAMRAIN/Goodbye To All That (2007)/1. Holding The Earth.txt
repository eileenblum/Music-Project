Can you ease up
For a while now
Before you burn out
For holding the earth
On your own

I am not that strong
But i think i can carry on
For some time
Together we will
Hold the earth

I have lost my faith
I'm just holding on
You know i used to be strong
But every waken hour
I'm scared we will fall
We canât hold it anymore
We canât hold the earth
Anymore
