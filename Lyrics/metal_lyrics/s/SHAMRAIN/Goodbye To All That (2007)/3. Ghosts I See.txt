Tonight she roams again
With the evening shadows
Under streetlights shining in red
She enters the house
Steps in my bedroom
Uninvited, pale white
Keeping me awake all night
Whispering words inside my head
"Help me, hold out your hand
Pull me out of this place
I'm not ready to leave
The world you live in"

Returning every night
With the hopeless wish
To live once again
She leaves notes on my door
On my window ledge
The same two words written down
A plea from the dead
"Help me, hold out your hand
Pull me out of this place
I'm not ready to leave
The world you live in"

Chase the fiends away
Before i fall in
Say no words to me
Before i fall in
