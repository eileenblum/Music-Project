So deep I have fell
these dreamy dimensions
under your spell
where all is perfect
in soft clouds I've drowned
a deepest kind of slumber
my feet have lost the ground
Will I ever wake up again?
Will I ever fall down again?

Still something's missing
My core still aches
Longs for bygone moments
Quietly withers and breaks
I descend further away
Slowly begin to fade
Inside this world I am astray
Will I ever find home again?
Will I ever be whole again?
Will I ever wake up again?
Will I ever fall down again?
