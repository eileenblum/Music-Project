I really have to leave now
can't stay here anymore
no more
We've come too far
Not another day no more
There is no return
No words to explain
No excuses left to make
There is no one to blame
There is no one else to blame but me

I've lost myself
and I lost you
Things are not well
I know you see it too
No they're not well
I know you feel it too
There is no return
No point of going on
All excuses that we made
There is no one to blame
There is no one else to blame but me
