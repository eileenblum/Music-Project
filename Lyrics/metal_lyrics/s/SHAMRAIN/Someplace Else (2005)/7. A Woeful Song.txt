One bleak moment
Heart ever aching
A plaintive whisper
My endless craving
Shards of glass
Under my skin

Buried in snow i found you
Deserted and left to pine
Buried in snow i found you
Cast aside and left to die

One fleeting touch
Soul ever aching
A woeful scene
My world breaking
A universe blue
You still adorn

Buried in snow i found you
Deserted and left to pine
Buried in snow i found you
Cast aside and left to die

Heartbroken emotions
That dwell within
My fading memories
Of the sweetest of all
