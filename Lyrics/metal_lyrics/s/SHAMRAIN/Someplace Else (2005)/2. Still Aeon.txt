In these futile moments
how slow the numbers change
The waves of the past swallow me
Shadows on the wall
Dark figures wave at me
Pale angels weep
and sing a siren song

I'm tired of it all
of this dead end life
waiting for your call
I've languished too long

In these timeless hours
in the shell of loneliness
inside walls that suppress me
I hear the sound of my heart
I know I'll never sleep again
I hear the sound of my heart
I know I'll never dream again

I'm tired of it all
of this dead end life
waiting for your call
I've languished too long
I've languished too long...
