Whisper my name
so I would know
Touch my skin to show
that I'm still alive
Break these fetters
the world has grown
around my heart
abandoned and cold
How can I live without you
There is no love without you

I've tried to become alive again
to get out of this night
I've tried to become alive
to live with a dead soul
I have tried

I cannot forget
I'm weary to try
Now all my emotions
wither and die
I feel numb inside
Break these fetters
the world has grown
around my heart
abandoned and cold
I cannot live without you
There is no love without you
