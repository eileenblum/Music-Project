To hear a thousand screams
To drown inside my dreams
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your shape within

To find and lose again
To stray in the dark
To let my heart explode
I can't let go

Shades of blue
swallowed you
Now I am sinking as you were
My voice was mute
as I called you
You left my heart empty

To touch the clouds
To feel warmth again
Your aura still paints
the sky and unveils
your beauty

Shades of blue
swallowed you
Now I am sinking as you were
My voice was mute
as I called you
You left my heart empty
