Knowing without acting, talking without speech
Inevitable damnation, the blame interchanged
Poor children, you are doomed
You can't be saved, you won't be saved
Neglected beyond rescue
You were dead long before you were born

Heading for disaster
Too late to respond
Heading for disaster
This world is death
No recollections, only regrets
Of parents inflicted, irresponsible deaths
If only they did, instead of debate

The children be spared, of this merciless fate
No one can save them now
It's long dead and gone
The burden of a conscience
Is knowing it went wrong

Farther
Farther
Farther
Into damnation

Poor children, you were doomed
You could'n't be saved, you were'n't saved
Neglected beyond rescue
You were dead long before you were born
You can't outrun time

The pendulum is our foe
No second chances
Our world is dead
