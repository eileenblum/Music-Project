The tale of Erida, who descended to the earth
The goddess of hate, the goddess of pain, who wants it all be burned
She uttered a pain-filled scream, provoked insanity
Blood-lusted rage, inhibition fades, desert humanity

Thirst for battle in their hearts
It's tearing them apart
The hunger can be stilled
Only when blood is spilled

The men are fighting, fighting to the death
The weight they're bearing, it's heavy on their hearts
Erida, she's smiling, she's feeling content
But still not satisfied, anger is all she has

Thirst for battle in their hearts
It's tearing them apart
The hunger can be stilled
Only when blood is spilled
