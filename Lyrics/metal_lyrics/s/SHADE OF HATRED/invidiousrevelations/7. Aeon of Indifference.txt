No sense of purpose in my life and you're the one to blame
Everywhere around the world, for them it's all a game
The least you could've done for me is given me a name
I would've gladly brought it all to shame

Apathetic manics
You created me
Apathetic manics
You're the reason I don't care

Why you're sitting on your thrones still
When you let the whole world turn to shit

The aeon of indifference,
It never ends now

You talk, you talk, you bitch, you preach, but nothing ever changed
Decisions based on dominance, it always stays the same
Doing what's best, forfeit yourself, there can be little gained?
Your delusional dictatorships, like fantasies deranged
Arrogant, incompetent, you bastards who reign the world
Arrogant, incompetent, you bastards will be smothered by your herds
