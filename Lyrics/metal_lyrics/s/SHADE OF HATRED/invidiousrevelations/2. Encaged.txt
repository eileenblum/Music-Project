Thunder clouds
Rolling in
Lightning strikes
Feel the fear under your skin

Nowhere to go
Nowhere to hide
Can't hold us off
Inevitably we'll get inside you

Pathetic little creeps
Depressed and deprived
Drown in your sadness
Crying won't get you through the night

Take a look outside, it's a black and burdened day
Mindless apothic fools wander around like a plague
Discover your own ways, the strength inside
There really is no need for us to simply walk in line
So come on up and break the chains
Escape the hollow nothingness of life encaged

Don't let the world deceive you to be what you did not mean to
Create yourself and own world, you're not alive just living a lie

Thunder clouds
Rolling in
Lightning strikes
Feel the fear under your skin

Nowhere to go
Nowhere to hide
Can't hold us off
Inevitably we'll get inside you
