On an April day, in the warming sun
A man arrested, for witchcraft
They hanged his wife before, now he's at stake
He has already chosen, a certain death

We will make you take this plea
More! Men, increase his agony
More! Facile words easily said
More! By standing mute you'll be pressed to death

The price of xenophobia

Nothing but breath, a persistent spirit
He'll play the martyr, for a false belief
The pressure rises, his eyes are bulging
No tears are shed, no cry escapes

More
More more more

We will make you take this plea
More! Men, increase his agony
More! Facile words easily said
More! By standing mute you'll be pressed to death

The price of xenophobia

He refused to budge, not unlike us
A silent warrior, against majority
Being unique, means being left out
In this world, has anything ever changed?
