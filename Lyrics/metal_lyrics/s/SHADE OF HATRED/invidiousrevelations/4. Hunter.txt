They chose you, from all the others
Precious as a gem never to be rediscovered
They chose you, from all the others
Conforming by them I really can't be bothered
They change you, to be like the others
Overprotection I can't risk being smothered
They change you, to be like the others
Just be relaxed and you won't be slaughtered

Murder, manipulating humankind
Murder, oppression of the fragile mind
Dehumanization
Suppress identity
Dehumanization
A matter of security
Dehumanization
No wolves among the sheep
Dehumanization
Your mind won't be free

Alone in the dark
The hunter comes to play

The hunter, the hunter, the hunter comes to play
The hunter, the hunter, the hunter comes to play

You can run, you can hide, there is no help for you
Once chosen as victim, there is nothing you can do
So precious, a trophy, there is nothing more to you
Here they come, still faceless, motionless approaching you

Be someone, be special, be who you want to be
Don't you change for no one, even society
Social groups and mind games, almost deliberately
Brainwashing the people, is anyone really free?

They chose you, from all the others
Precious as a gem never to be rediscovered
They chose you, from all the others
Conforming by them I really can't be bothered
They change you, to be like the others
Overprotection I can't risk being smothered
They change you, to be like the others
Just be relaxed and you won't be slaughtered

I chose you, from all the others
Precious as a gem never to be rediscovered
I chose you, from all the others
Ugly as hell by them I really can't be bothered
I hunt you, away from the others
Overprotection I can't risk being smothered
I hunt you, away from the others
Just be relaxed and you won't be slaughtered

Murder, manipulating humankind
Murder, oppression of the fragile mind
Murderous intention
No way to hold it back
Murderous intention
I won't hold it back
Murderous intention
No way to hold it back
Murderous intention
I won't hold it back

Alone in the dark
The hunter comes to play

The hunter, the hunter, the hunter comes to play
The hunter, the hunter, the hunter comes to play

You can run, you can hide, there is no help for you
Once chosen as victim, there is nothing you can do
So precious, a trophy, there is nothing more to you
Here he comes, still faceless, motionless approaching you
