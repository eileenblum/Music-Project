Well, here I am in this prison cell.
Wrongfully accused of being something I am not.
Soon they're going to lay me down in an open field, probably naked.
They'll put an increasing weight upon my body, until I confess.
But I won't.
I won't give in, they won't hear anything from me.
No cries, nothing.
I will play my part 'til the very end.
Stand my ground against their false beliefs.
I will be silent, 'til the end.
