Born, raised, versed, imbued
Holy scripture I've pursued
A circle unified of
Brother, sisters, fates divine

Within these harbouring walls
Deception cannot harm
Where hearts are filled with love
Iron minds, reinforced
Bear onto the earth
Sovereign hallowed law

Open wide your eyes
To heaven's searing light
You heathens sanctified
Evangelist I

Set in stone, I made my choice
Though I never heard the voice
A might divine
This spirit holy, surging through me

Where have I gone astray?
On bleeding knees, I did pray
My ambivalence
It leaves me hollow, cold, dismayed

They begin to speak in tongues
A preposterous display
My doubts remain unsung
Buried until another day

Beyond my home I've come to learn
Bridge by bridge they start to burn
My ignorance
Fed to the pyre, rising higher

Arts exiled came to me
Science and philosophy
Enlightening, frightening revelation
Wrenched my spirit free

Look upon us!

How could I've been so blind?
And blazed the trail for lies
I've sown the barren seed
Of a ruinous rotten creed

To dust the wings of faith
Arising from the flames
Anew, I'm standing tall
Etched into the ground

I cast off my former robes,
with sodden steps, I tread into a new dawn
