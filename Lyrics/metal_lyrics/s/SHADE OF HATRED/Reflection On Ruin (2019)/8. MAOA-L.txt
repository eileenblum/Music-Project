No remorse

Pouring rain, a bleak autumn day
This unburdened soul did wither away

Horrible fate, a fierce struggle in vain
Wrenched from this world in a sickening state of dismay
By this monstrosity, this unscrupulous filth's revolting salacity

How we've seen all the cruelty in this being
Amongst us, yet devoid of empathy
Serpent tongue, generic face
How indistinct and commonplace
Beguiling words, you found a way

Out of your cage

How they have failed
Those entrusted with your restrain
Now, can they explain?
Live with this disgrace?

How could it be that this bastard roamed free?
How can we forgive harbingers of such agony?
I'd sentence to death
Willing to sacrifice my very humanity

No remorse
None

Bitter hearts engrieved
Left to mourn in disbelief
Yet this woe, I know
Can't ever be relieved

Now my mind's eye is tormented when I
Think of this night, I imagine her mortified cries
The echoing screams
Face filled with tears craving eternal release
