Lo, lo and behold
As tapestries of time
Unfold and decay
Before my eyes
Here, here I now stand
Upon the torrid sands
Revelation floods the mind

Oh, such wasted potential
To heal the essential...

...Life
Denied
By sway
Of beguiling coin
Our home
This sanctuary
Is laid to ruin
To waste

Blackened days, all daylight fades
Yet we won't shed our cancerous ways
A drowning haze, the skies ablaze
Man plunged into forlorn graves

Walk with me
I'll make you see
Our weakness and hypocrisy
Perceive with me
As mankind bleeds
To where this apathy might lead

No use for regret
It's much too late
Chant your prayer
While you suffocate

When do winds of change turn to storm
And bring motion to the gears of revolution?

Tremor!
I feel the quavering
Tremor!
Heralding the end
