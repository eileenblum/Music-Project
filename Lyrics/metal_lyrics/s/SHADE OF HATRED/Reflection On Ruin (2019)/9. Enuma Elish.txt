From abyssal chaos born
Abzu, Tiamat, came forth
Churning a primal storm
Enigma, creation
Tremors in the coiling seas
Of primordial legacy

Their primordial legacy

Three of a might grandeur
Enki, Enlil, Anu
Triad, reigning ones
Countless kin, pantheon
Dwelling in the ocean one
Bastion, Tiamat

Anger grows, Abzu sows
A most sinister approach
Heirs reduced, down to foes
Engulfing rage, they shall know
Vile intention, now shown
Caught in the undertow

"My slumber disturbed
They all... must burn"

"I bear them no harm
Enki, heed my alarm"

Hand of Enlil, stride forth
Towards the far waters
To lay waste upon the All-father
Abzu's demise achieved
A bride bereaved

His bride bereaved

He: Lord of raging winds
Harbinger of violent storm
Marduk: son of Enki
Revered, mountain born

Carving through the waves
Woeful maternal rage
Eleven fiends, she creates

Defeated, tattered, torn
And from her broken corpse
Earth and sky, he'll form

"When the sky above was not named
And the earth beneath did not yet bear its name
No field yet formed, no marsh to be seen
When of the gods, none had been called into being"
