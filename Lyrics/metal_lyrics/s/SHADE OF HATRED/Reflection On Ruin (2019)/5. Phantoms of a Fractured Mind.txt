Sleepless nights
Haunting terrors
The fabric of reality
Seems tattered
A fog in my head of countless echoes
Once distant and far, seem close

Cries
Clawing away
The veil, torn to rags
Receding lucidity is breeding ferocity

I've come to this place
Forlorn. In desperate need
To put my mind at ease
I beg of you, please

Because far too long I've harkened to their calls
Convincing me there's menace all around
I can't make sense of this madness in my ears
You ask me why I'm here, well...

Aid I've come to find
Craving to define
What is real and what is conjured by my fractured mind
Breaking all the chains
The fire in my veins
Is tearing through my skull and driving me insane

I've completely lost the reins

Well, my friend, there's one thing we can do
All this time we've waited just for you
Sign these forms. Our sessions can begin
His gentle features fold into a grin

All this time the whisperings bore seeming of the dead
Now a gentle face reveals her wardening instead

I bolt from my seat
Reeling on my feet
I meet his gaze
Staring straight through their deceit

The blink of an eye
A violent desperate cry
I throw myself upon this fiend
Attempt to take its life

The doors fling open, others storming in
With twisted limbs and terrifying skin
Grabbing both my arms, searing pain
I'm lost, encaged, never seen again
The needle finds a vein
