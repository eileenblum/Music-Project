The wells are poisoned
The herds lie sick
Progress did cast us
Into a black abyss
Fear amongst the young ones
All weary, hope deprived
Bearing marks of relentless strife
In slums filled with broken minds

The heat, scorching my face
Meadows ablaze
Lightning scars the heavens

The oceans disgraced
My earth defaced
Now fire burns our sky

Abort your cancerous ways
Retract your felonies
Scorned! Reveries erased
Plagued! Our bleak, dismal fate

Upon this tower high
Marble stone and cleaner skies
Like gods above mortals rise
The callous, cruel and heart deprived

You've crossed the Rubicon
Generations dead and gone
Below we sing, in unison
Laments to the dying dawn

Our breaking of chains
Violence in vain
For a haven far beyond our reach
You're safe from our cries
Astray from your eyes
Soundly you'll go to sleep

Abort your cancerous ways
Retract your felonies
Scorned! Reveries erased
Plagued! Our bleak, dismal fate

No mason could ever forge passage
Across this crevice of utter madness

Your care-naught philosophy
Beyond all reasoning
Relentless agony
Condemned... eternally
