A scourge is looming in the West
Peace and love it does not comprehend
Obsessed it is, consumption and greed
None can stand the force of this consuming stampede

Our ways are imperilled
A legacy defiled

We call upon the ones who hold the faith deep in their hearts
As one, we'll rid the world of the impure
You prey upon the ones who feel they don't belong. Filth!
Machinating minds with promises grandeur

Conquest, brutality remains
The only way to ascend and free this place
Behold the devastation of our righteous cause
Obtained through sacrifice of the ego

Our lives, expendable
Serving greater good

We call upon the ones who hold the faith deep in their hearts
As one, we'll rid the world of the impure
Twisting of perception, erasing their own thoughts
Urged upon a path, eager to meet your god

"What prevents you from attaining martyrdom and the pleasure of your Lord?
Look around you when you sit in comfort and ask yourself: If this how you wish to die?"

We call upon the ones who hold the faith deep in their hearts
Brothers, time to be the liberators we have sought
Consumed by the searing hatred you have wrought
Now they follow blind to drench the world in blood

Valiant and just
Confused and exploited
Calling out to us
Sent to a noble death
Sent to a pointless death

Now I strap martyr's fire to my chest
My cry, enraged I thunder
Wreaking desolation with my last breath
My corpse be torn asunder
