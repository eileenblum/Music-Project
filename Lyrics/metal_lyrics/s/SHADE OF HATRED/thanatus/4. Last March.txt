Centuries have passed
Calm we stood tall
Brothers side by side
Shepherds of the earth

When two creatures came in
To sound the alarm
They speak of betrayal
Meeting of the guards

They have done us evil
They have bled our brothers dry
Let us march into our doom
Our last march into fight

All the trees are trembling
As we're passing by
We will be remembered
Even if we die

As we reach the edge of the forest
We behold the devastating truth
All around us lay our fallen brothers
They were all cut off by their roots

War, let them know the meaning of pain
War, don't let it be in vain

They have done us evil
They have bled our brothers dry
Let us march into our doom
Our last march into fight

For victory
Victory
