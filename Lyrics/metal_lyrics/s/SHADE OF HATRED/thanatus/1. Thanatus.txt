I must fight the curse
Pronounced upon my world
Averting the bane of my existence
How can I live my life if my dreams are caving in?
I can not go on

I, I must live, you'll die
Surfacing the darkness inside me
I, I must live, you'll die
Surfacing the darkness inside me

Thanatus, the drive to die
Instinctual self-infliction
Thanatus, prepare to die
The path to self extinction

Even with all my might
I will never win this fight
You hold me in your grip so tight
There is nowhere to run or hide
Feeling sick inside
Breaking down my mind
What an ugly sight
The ending of my life

You, you must live, I'll die
Surfacing the darkness inside me
You, you must live, I'll die
Surfacing the darkness inside me

Thanatus, the drive to die
Instinctual self-infliction
Thanatus, prepare to die
The path to self extinction
