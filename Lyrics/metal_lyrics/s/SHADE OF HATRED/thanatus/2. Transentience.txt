Now you feel
How I feel
Accept your fate
Eradicate
Slaughterer
Of the herd
This is me
Through your veins

The human will is so easy to break
Effortless to manipulate
I broke through your defence
Transentience

I can control you
Control your feeble minds
Do as I command to
Everyone will die
I can control you
Control your feeble minds
Do as I command to
Everyone will die

No one left
To behead
Filled with hate
Decapitate
Here you go
Served me well
Last man down
Now useless shell

The human will is so easy to break
Effortless to manipulate
I broke through your defence
Transentience
