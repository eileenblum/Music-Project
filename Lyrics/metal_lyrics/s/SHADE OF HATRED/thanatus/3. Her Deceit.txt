Do you even know who you're conforming to?
All because you believe that what she says is always true
Fall to your knees then and take a bow
But be aware that you are never good enough for her anyhow

Kill her, burn her, hate or rape her
It's all the same to me
Think for yourself, it's human nature
She could never really set you free

Live your lives in utter shame
What you have whispered in the ear will be proclaimed
You think that she is good, and that she is great
But contradiction has always been her biggest trait

Open your eyes
See her lies

There I see her stand before me
She's not going to take me in
Her angels are calling for me
I'm happy with my life of sin
Burn! Let the fire burn her down
Let the fire burn her down
Let the fire burn you down
Burn you down

Open your eyes
See her lies
Open your eyes
See her lies
Lies
Lies
