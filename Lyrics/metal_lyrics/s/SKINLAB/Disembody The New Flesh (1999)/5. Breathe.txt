I'll give you just a little x3
of my time yeah
I'll give you just a little x3
of my time
Time, time, time, time, time, time

What do you want from me?
Just let me breathe a little
What do you want from me?
Just let me breathe
What do you want from me?
Just let me breathe a little
What do you want from me?
Just let me breathe
time, time, time, time, time, time

Just let me breathe

I feel you breathing down my spine again and that's OK
Try and to bleed me, but you bore me with you sympathy
Try your weak conversations on me
Got me confused on someone else becouse I don't give a fuck

Just let me breathe x2
Dont you know it was a force of denial?
Just let me breathe x2
Dont you know it was a force of denial?

I'll give you just a little x3
of my time yeah
I'll give you just a little x3
of my goddamn time
Time, time, time, time, time, time
