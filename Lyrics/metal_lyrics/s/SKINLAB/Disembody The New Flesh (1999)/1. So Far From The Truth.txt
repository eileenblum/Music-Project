I know you fear me
I know you fear yourself
I know you fear me

So far from the truth
I let you slip away x3

So far from the truth
I let you slip away x3

So what the fuck you want to be? x3
Am I subhuman, am I him?
So perfect subhuman
Now I stay true to myself

I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting for you
I'm still waiting for you
For you to fall, fall
So far from the truth
Fall, fall
So far from the truth

So what the fuck you want to be x3
Am I subhuman, am I him?
So perfect so human
Now I stay true to myself

I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting for you
I'm still waiting for you
I'm still waiting x6
for you to fall, fall, fall, fall

So what the fuck you want to be?
Stay true to yourself
