I name my pain, my blame
I name my pain, my blame

At a step of the eyes of rancid queen
Pour acid on the bees

I name my pain, my blame

Immune to scars 
is what you think
is what you think

Spread the ashes over disease
Spread the ashes over me
Spread my ashes over me 

I name my pain, my blame
I name my pain, my blame

Throw away nothing at all
Spread the ashes over disease
Spread my ashes over me x3
