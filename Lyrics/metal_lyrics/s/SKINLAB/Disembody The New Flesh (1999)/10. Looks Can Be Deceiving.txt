What you concieve 
What you believe

Don't fool yourself
Don't ever let it get the best of you

Well, I saw
I've seen it all
I've seen it all, my friends
I saw 
I've seen it all
I've seen it all, my friends

What you concieve
What you believe
Might not be true
Don't ever let it get the best of you

I saw
I've seen it all
I've seen it all, my friends
I saw 
I've seen it all
I've seen it all, my friends

Save yourself
No you can't rely on no one else
No you can't count on anyone
To get you through in the end
