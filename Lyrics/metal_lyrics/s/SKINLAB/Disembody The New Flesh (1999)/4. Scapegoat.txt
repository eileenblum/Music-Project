They try to bring me down
I'm tired of wearing this sorrowed frown
Try to escape to myself
Try to relate to you

You try to bring me down x2
Try to relate to you
I'm not your fucking scapegoat
You try to bring me down x2
Try to relate to you
I'm not your fucking scapegoat

Say what you want, scapegoat x6
I'm not your fucking scapegoat

You try to bring me down x2
Try to relate to you
I'm not your fucking scapegoat
You try to bring me down x2
Try to relate to you
I'm not your fucking scapegoat

Say what you want, scapegoat x6
Scapegoat
