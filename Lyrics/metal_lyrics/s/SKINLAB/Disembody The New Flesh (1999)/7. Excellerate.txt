Would you like to see my flesh in pain?
Cross the line stain my arms in flames
Would you like to try and take the pain?
Self indulgency

Crossing the line
Excellerate
Building your tolerance
and bearing all the extremes

Excellerate x3
I take all the tic and the needle with in the addict with in x2

Would you like to see my flesh in pain?
Cross the line stain my arms in flames
Would you like to try and take the pain?
Self indulgency

Crossing the line
The threshold of pain
Building your tolerance
and bearing all the extremes

Excellerate x3
I take all the tic and the needle with in the addict with in x4

Would you like to cross my flesh in pain?
Cross the line to excellerate
Would you like to try and take the pain?
Cross the line to excellerate

Crossing the line
My threshold of pain
Building your tolerance
And bearing all the extremes
