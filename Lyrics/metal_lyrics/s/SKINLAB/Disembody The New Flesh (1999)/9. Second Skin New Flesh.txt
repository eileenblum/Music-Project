Now I peel my skin
Now I shed my skin
Now I peel my skin
Yeah my second skin
Now I peel skin x2
No more shedding skin
Now I peel my skin

You don't have the love it takes to give it all anyway 
I'm through shedding skin
Sick of running thin
Are you so called friends?
Are you there in the end?

No more shedding skin x3
No more...

You don't have the love it takes to give it all anyway
You turned your back on me 
Why'd you give up all that we've built together

I should've known when you told me it was hos before bros
Why, must it be like this?, be like this?, be like this?

Sometimes I look back on the times we had
The reason that you quit was something else
Sometimes I think all the times we had
The thought of all that shit just makes me sick

You turned your back on me
Why'd you give up all that we've built together

I'll never forget the day you told me it was bros before hos
Why, why, why?
