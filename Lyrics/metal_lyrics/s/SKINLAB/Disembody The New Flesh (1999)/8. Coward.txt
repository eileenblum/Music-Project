Lies 
When I see your face I despise
28 years gone by
Pictures to remind me, that you weren't there for me

Cries
See your face in my eyes
Looking to your eyes
Nothing to remind me, becouse you weren't there for me

Bleed through the mouth of your spine x2

Coward
I hate myself for loving you
Coward
I blame myself for loving you
Coward
I hate myself for loving you
You leave me selfless

I hate myself for loving you
I blame myself for loving
I hate myself for loving
You leave me selfless

Bleed through the mouth of your spine x2

I hate myself for loving you
I blame myself for loving you
