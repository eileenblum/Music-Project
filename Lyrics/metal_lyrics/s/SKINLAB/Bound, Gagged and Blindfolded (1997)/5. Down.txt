I've got a low self-esteem today 
My inner strength is slowly seeping away 
Won't someone come and wake me?, problems I have 
I feel no life, I feed the pride, don't take my self-esteem 

Break down my walls of pain 
Break down my walls of pain 
Break down my walls of pain 
Won't you lay my bitterness? 

With my eyes seperated by day 
I'm alone 
With nothing to call my own 
So alone 

Throw it away 
I'm so lonely 
Throw it away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
I'm so lonely 

Celebrate the aging of my new skill 
Won't you celebrate the aging of my old skill? 

Somebody told me I was wasted 
Somebody told me I was gone 
Somebody told me I was useless 
Somebody told me... 

I've got a low self-esteem today 
My inner strength is slowly seeping away 
Won't someone come and wake me?, problems I have 
I feel no life, I feed the pride, don't take my self-esteem 

Break down my walls of pain 
Break down my walls of pain 
Break down my walls of pain 
Won't you lay my bitterness?
