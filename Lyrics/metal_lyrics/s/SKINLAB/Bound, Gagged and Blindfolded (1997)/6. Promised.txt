Everything I have said to you 
You could not take away 
And everything I've done to you 
You let me seep beneath your skin 

But you try and you try to burn me 
Oh, let me black malice 
You'll see your darkness, rusted gun to your head 
Won't let you love again 

Time won't heal these wounds 
Won't love 
Yeah, I promised you I would not do it 
I promised everything to you 
But you try and you try to burn me 
Oh, let me black malice 
Won't love again 

Time won't heal these wounds 

Yeah, I promised you I would not do it 
I promised everything to you 
Won't love again 

Taking whole 
Let my soul 
Thank you Jesus Christ for letting me live 
Taking whole 
Let my soul 
Thank you Jesus Christ for letting me live 

Taking whole 
Let my soul 
Thank you Jesus Christ for letting me live 

Won't love 
Won't love 
Won't love again
