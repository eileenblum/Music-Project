Am I disabled to you? 
What's my dysfunction to you? 
Open your eyes and kill me 
World war inside of my head 

You feed this hatred burning inside me 
Yeah, I took her off them, a weight of life, oh 
Oh, won't you let me take you for granted? 
Just fuck it away! 

Now father, can you hear me? 
God damn it, help me, help me 
Dear mother, can you feel me? 
Just call me, spoken to me 

Am I broken in this part of me? 
Am I worth this war inside my head? 
Just fuck it away! 
Just fuck it away! 

Am I disabled to you? 
Am I disabled to you? 

Am I broken? 
Am I worth this? 
Am I broken? 
Am I worth this? 
This motherfucking race 
You breed a race of hate 
You breed a race of hate 
You breed a race of hate 

Am I disabled to you? 
What's my dysfunction to you? 
What's my dysfunction to you? 
What's my dysfunction to you? 
Am I disabled to you? 
What's my dysfunction to you? 
I work the same as you do
