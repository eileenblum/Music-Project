You're stumbling 
Wake 
Yeah, you motherfucker, stumble 

Wake 
You're stumbling 
Wake 
Yeah, you motherfucker, stumble 

Yeah, my region's mine so I'm living of hatred 
You didn't suffer as long as she was running away and away and away 
You motherfucker, stumble 


The Art Of Suffering 
And give this world 
Of all suffering 
My eyes see you're unpure 
Of the unsaid 
If I walk away 
To my own proud space 
What would you do for me? 
What would you do? 

And if I corrode 
And if I corrode away 
What would you do for me? 
What could you do for me? 

And give my life a shame 
I'm so fucking proud 
I can't believe the things I've done to myself 
I can't believe the things you've done to me 

And if I corrode 
And if I corrode away 
What would you do for me? 
What could you do for me? 

Away 
How do you feel? 
Away 
How do you feel? 

Empty... crawling again, yeah! 
Broken in shame 

Away 
How do you feel? 
Away 
How do you feel?
