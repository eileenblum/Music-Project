The more I put you, believe thee or believe me 
You didn't feel like you're the one that doesn't care 
Yeah, could you mind and believe it's not forever 
So tell me that the little think you aren't who you're under 

Stumbling on one thing 
Stumbling on one thing 
One day you're stumbling, yeah! 
You motherfucker, stumble 

If I could jump right through your life 
If I could scream right through your cries 
And when I woke right over you 
You're stumbling, you're fucking stumbling 

Wake 
You're stumbling 
Wake 
Yeah, you motherfucker, stumble 

If I could live with no more lies 
If I could scream right through your cries 
And then I woke right over you 
You're stumbling, you're fucking stumbling
