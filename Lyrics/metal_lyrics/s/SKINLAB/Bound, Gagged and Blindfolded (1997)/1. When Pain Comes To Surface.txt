What does it take to be a man? 
The complex of a little man 
When your life ain't so perfect 
When your pain comes to surface 

Want you... want you to be yourself 
But you don't even know yourself 
Don't even like yourself 
Pain comes to surface when you... 
Pain comes to surface when you... 
Complex of a little man 
Complex of a little man 

Pain comes to surface 
Pain comes to surface 
Life ain't so perfect 
When your pain comes to surface 

Want you... want you to be yourself 
But you don't even know yourself 
Don't even like yourself 
Pain comes to surface when you... 
Pain comes to surface when you... 
Complex of a little man 
So blind you don't understand 

Pain comes to surface 
When pain comes to surface 
Your pain comes to surface 
And your life ain't so perfect any more, yeah! 

Come on... bitch 
Come on... watch the motherfucker burn 
Come on... bitch 
Come on... watch the motherfucker burn 

Come on... what does it take to be a man? 
Come on... watch the motherfucker burn 

So come on, what does it take to be a man? 
With your complex of a little man 
And your life ain't so perfect 
When your pain comes to surface
