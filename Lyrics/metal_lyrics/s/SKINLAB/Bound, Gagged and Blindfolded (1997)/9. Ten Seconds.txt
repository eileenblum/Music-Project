Ten seconds before your suicide 
Ten seconds before your drive, will you survive? 
Ten years gone by, still I wonder why 
Sterilize these four walls of my mind 

Now that I'm alone 
There's nothing left to get me through a time 
The pain goes on and on and on and on 
Sterilize these four walls of my mind 

Who am I to blame? 
Always a part of me 
When nothing feels the same 
Ten seconds to your last breath 

Always a part of me 
Always a part of you 

Your world will never be the same 
So close, but nothing left to gain 
All I have is a memory 
So pure, so fucking pure 

Your world will never be the same 
So close, but nothing left to gain 
Ten seconds to your last breath 
I'm counting my ten seconds 

Will never be the same 
Will never be the same 

Who am I to blame? 
Always a part of me 
When nothing feels the same 
Ten seconds to your last breath 

Always a part of me 
Always a part of you 

Your world will never be the same 
So close, but nothing left to gain 
All I have is a memory 
So pure, so fucking pure 

Your world will never be the same 
So close, but nothing left to gain 
Ten seconds to your last breath 
I'm counting my ten seconds 

Will never be the same 
Will never be the same 

Ten seconds before your suicide 
Ten seconds before your drive, will you survive? 

Now that I'm alone 
There's nothing left to get me through a time 
The pain goes on and on and on and on 
Sterilize these four walls of my mind
