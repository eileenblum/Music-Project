All the love I give to you 
You take away 
And all the love you bring to me 
I take away 
Release the pain 
From all the love that I give 
Don't take away 
From all the love that I give 
Yeah, I've been through denial 
Yeah, I've been self-deprived 
What will it take... 
What will it take... 
Of my friends? 
Of my friends? 
Of my friends? 
Of my friends? 
I've been through denial 
I've been self-deprived 
What will it take to feel again? 
No, you can be working on me 
Don't take away 
All the love that I give 
Yeah, I've been through denial 
Yeah, I've been self-deprived 
What will it take... 
What will it take... 
Of my friends? 
Of my friends? 
Of my friends? 
Of my friends? 
I've been through denial 
Yeah, I've been self-deprived 
What will it take to feel again? 
I've been through denial 
I've been self-deprived 
What will it take to feel again? 
Of my friends? 
All the love I give 
Of my friends? 
All the love you give 
Of my friends?

Of my friends?
