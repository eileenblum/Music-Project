I know you fear me 
I know you fear yourself 
I know you fear me 
So far from the truth 
I let you take away 
I let you take away 
I let you take away 
So far from the truth 
I let you slip away 
Oh yeah, you slip away 
So what the fuck you want to be? 
So what the fuck you want to be? 
So what the fuck you want to be? 
Am I subhuman? 
Am I him? 
So perfect, so human 
So I stay true to myself 
I'm still waiting 
I'm still waiting for you 
I'm still waiting for you 
For you to fall... fall 
So far from the truth 
Fall... fall 
So far from the truth 
So what the fuck you wanna be? 
So what the fuck you wanna be? 
So what the fuck you wanna be? 
Am I subhuman? 
Am I him? 
So perfect, so human 
Now I stay true to myself 
I'm still waiting 
I'm still waiting for you 
I'm still waiting for you 
I'm still waiting 
I'm still waiting 
I'm still waiting 
For you to fall... fall... fall... fall
