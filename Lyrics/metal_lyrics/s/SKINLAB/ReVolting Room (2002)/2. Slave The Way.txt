Everybody got their own opinions, right?
Everybody got their own desicions, right?
Everybody got their own ass on the line
Everyone slave the way, pave the way, slave
All the people scream!
Everybody made their own decisions, right?
Everybody made teir own opionions, right?
Everybody put their own ass on the line
Everybody got their own religion, right?
Everybody got their own addictions, right?
Everyone slave the way, pave the way, slave
All the people scream!
Falling further and further and further away
Slave the way, pave the way, slave
I can not live whe I'm force fed
Slave the way
I can not live when I'm forced in society
Falling further and further and further away
Slave the way, pave the way, slave
Everyone slave the way, pave the way
