Purify through and through
Justify what you've been through
Cleansing hands two and two
Wish I could save you from yourself
To late to save you from yourself
Wish I could purify you
Wish I could save you from yourself
Which I could purify you from yourself
And I feel sorry
Wish I could purify you
And I feel sorry for you
Wish I could save you from yourself
And I feel sorry
Wish I could purify you from yourself
Newborn hands, stillborn eyes
Innocence never question why
Emptyness for suicide
You need to save you from yourself
Can not take this back?
Now you feel it?
Can not take this back?
Save you from myself
Wish I could purify you
Wish I could save you from yourself
And I feel sorry
Wish I could purify you
And I feel sorry for you
Wish I could save you from yourself
And I feel sorry
Wish I could purify you
And I feel sorry
Can I take this back?
Now you feel it?
