What's wrong with my head?
Disturbing thoughts inside
These voices telling me
These fighters aren't my friends
Disturbing anxiety
What's wrong with myself
and social anxiety?
My friends are still the same
and social anxiety
You put me down
Look at me now, we look the same
Can't you see that it's killing me?
It's not the way life's supposed to be
What's wrong with my head?
This pain is killing me
I can't explain the way I feel inside
(It doesn't matter anymore)
What's worng with my head?
This pain is killing me
I can't explain the way I feel, the way I feel inside
You put me down
Look at me now, we look the same
What's wong with my head?
Can't you see that it's killing me
It's not the way life's supposed to be
I can't hide behind the words not real
I drown myself in my misery
Isolation is telling me,
everything I've never known
Isolation is telling me,
everything I've never known
Isolation it tells me everything
that I never knwe about myself
Keeps me alive
Can't you see that it's killing me?
