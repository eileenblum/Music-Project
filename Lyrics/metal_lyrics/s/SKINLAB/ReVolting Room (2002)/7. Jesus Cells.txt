Nothing will ever change my ways
I'm living on something that's better than Jesus... What gives?
Nothing will ever change the way
I'm trippen on something that's better thatn Jesus... What gives?
Now I'm leaving and my faith has turned to blood
Now I'm leaving and my faith has turned to dust
Now I'm leaving and my faith has turned to blood
Now I'm leaving...
It's my faith that turns to blood,
It's my faith that turns to blood..
Am I losing strength?
Am I losing faith?
Am I losing strength?
Am I losing faith and blood?
Nothing will ever change, nothing will serve my change
Always seems to fall
Always seems to fall away
Nothing will ever change, nothing will serve a change
Nothing will ever change...
