Take as needed only for pain
I don't take it just to take away the pain
I need it to help me get me through the day
I bring it now I need it
but I take as I need it only for pain
I need it
can't get my life in shape
help me please
So forgive me
Take as needed
Take as needed only for pain
Fuck that shit till the bottle is empty
I need it to help me get me through the day
I bring it now I need it
but I take as I need it only for pain
Take as I need it
Take the pain
Take as needed
But it won't be the death of me
And now I've fallen
How much do I have to go?
Do I take as I need it only for pain?
Fuck that shit till the bottle is empty
I can't take it not another fuckin day
I need it can't seem to break away
I feel it when I need it
But I take as I need it only for pain
