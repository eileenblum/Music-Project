You're one of us
We're one of you
Coming together through native tongue
Respect for me, Respect for you
How do we even know where we survive
Nothing can seperate now that your one of us
Believe in me, Believe in you
All that shines through leaving me scarred for life
Now that your one of us nothing can seperate
Decieving me, Decieving you
All comes around when our planets collide
Nothing can seperate now that your one odf us
Now that your one of us
Believing me, Scaring me
What do you even exspect from us?
It's killing me, it's killing you
All this technology takin our lives
All thie technology feeding outr families
You're one of us, We're one with you
Now that you're one of us
You can seperate
You can seperate us now
