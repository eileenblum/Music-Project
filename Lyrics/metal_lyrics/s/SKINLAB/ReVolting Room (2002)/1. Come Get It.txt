So come and get it , come and get it, take it from me
If you want it bad enough you'll try and find away
So if you need it gotta take it take it from me
I got it all, I got the cure for your disease
So just forget it, just forget what they say
It doesn't matter, no it doesn't matter anyway
It's just another, just another fucked up day
Look in the mirror see the product of society
One chance, one time to admit it
You can't resist because your so goddamn addicted
The light's not so bright unless you abuse it
You can't admit that your a goddamn loser of life
I'm not crazy
It's just mixed emotions
and I gotta get em outta my head
I'm not crazy
It's just mixed emotions
and I gotta get em outta my head
So come get it, come and get it form me
If you want it bad enough you'll find a better way
Just to get a... just to get another fix
I got it all, I got the high you can't resist
You dont get it, you just dont get it you see
You got your problems , yet you blame then on society
You don't get it you just don't get it you see
You got your problems,  but you can't blame then on society
Last chance, last time to admit it
Got to admit that your so goddamn addicted
the light ain't so bright unless you abuse it
You can't admit that your a goddamn loser
I'm not crazy
