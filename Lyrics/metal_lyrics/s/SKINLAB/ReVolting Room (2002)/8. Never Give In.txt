I've been trying my whole life
and I'll be damned if I turn back now
How could I  throw all this away?
It's just to late to turnback now
I've been down for all this time
and I've only come this far
So now I'm never giving in
with no regrets at all
No regrets at all
How can you trust anyone when you can't even trust yourself?
How can you love someone whern you can't even love yourself?
How can I refuse all this?
All I know is that it's to late to turn back now
Good god I know that times are changing
All the faces changing
Evreything revolting
Never give in
For what? For what?
All I know it's to turn bak now
I know that things are changing
I've seen this place before
I know I'll probably be back soon
I'm never turning back now
I'll never turn my back on you
I know I've seen your face before
I know I'll probably see you soon
I'm never turning back now
No I'll neverturn my back on you
I'll guess I'll see you on the other side
For what? For what?
Well I guess I'll see you onj the other side
I know that things are changing
I've seen this place before
I know I'll probably be back soon
I'm never turning back now
I'll never turn my back on you
I know I've seen your face before
I know the tide is coming soon
I'll never turn my back now
I'll never turn mty back on you
I'll guess I'll see you on the other side
Why does it have to be this way?
I'll guess i'll see  you on the other side
How could you put us all away?
I'll guess I'll see you on the other side
I'll guess I'll see you again someday
For What? For what?
All I know it's to late to turn back now
