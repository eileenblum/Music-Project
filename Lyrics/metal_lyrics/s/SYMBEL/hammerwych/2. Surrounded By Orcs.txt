Surrounded by orcs with hateful tongues
their speech songs are horrid
their faces are worse
surrounded by orcs
you cannot escape
hemmed in by orcs encroaching each day
you weep for your childhood
so pure and afar
surrounded by orcs
the light fades away!

In dreams you would call for a white elvish blade
to drive home your vengeance
the heart of your hate
youâd burn every bridge
so thereâd be no escape
creatures with masters hate those that are free
those without worth seek the basest decree
Give them no quarter
keep them away!

Surrounded by orcs
the light fades
away!

Shara-ishi uruk lab ghash dumpuga
shakhburz uruk lab ghash dumpuga
thrak ufum uruk lab ghash dumpuga
mokum-ishi uruk lab ghash dumpuga gar!
