Screech the ghouls of deepest wynter
The wolves howl as I prowl the perimetre
Cursed with Negative maegen wounds
We search our servile souls.

Tears rain like blood from Thunor's sky
(leave) grief bleached bones behind.

Smash through wooden shield like snow
Our swords will cut with Woden's words
Weep and ask your god for help
Upon your virgin lips.

Tears rain like blood from Thunor's sky
(leave) grief bleached bones behind.

Woden... Thunor.... Tiu..... Freo

Hail them.... Wassail!!!

We're here, your there,
In here, in there,
Come here, we're there
In here, we're there.

(Heed the) screech of deepest wynter.
