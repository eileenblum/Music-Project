A song of heathen defiance and a redefinition of faith.

Take a new look at god
In the dust it's the wrong way round
Speak the place names and days
Let the honey drip from your tongue
The dew that runs from the before
We're not scared of believing
In the gods of before
Inside us they are breathing
We can wake them all
A wise man knows himself
And a fool knows the rest
Universalism sets our eyes in the sand
I know where the cool blue air
Waits for the children
Just be there,  in how you feel
Just be there, await the steel
We're not scared of believing
In the gods of before
In our lands they are breathing
Time to wake them up
In our lore...
In our hearts....
In our minds...
Don't be scared of believing
In the gods of before
In our lives shallow breathing
I and I and us.

I pick up the spear that our
Ancestor has thrown
Clean it of its darkness
Ignorance and corruption
And throw it on
Newly shined
For another 1500 years.
