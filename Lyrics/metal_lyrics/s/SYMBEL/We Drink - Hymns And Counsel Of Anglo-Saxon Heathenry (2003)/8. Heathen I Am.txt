Of the ancestors shunning the missionaries, and that same spirit in us today.

I feel through the ancient sunsets
I breathe in the wind and the trees
I once had the girl and the hillsides
And a fighting family
I loved my family
And my sword.
I think of whoring 'til sunrise
I think of the day I will die
I know my path is destined
I trudge it with a smile
I laugh with the beautiful children
I cry with the wrinkled hag
I cry...

Heathen yes I am
Heathen yes I will
Accept what we are
Heathen through our death

I don't need your salvation
Your god is not for me
I once had the girl and the hillsides
And my family
Take it as read
Despite what you said
I have no need for change
I cry...

This is my way
There's no contest
I hail all the gods of the wind and the rain
Of pleasure and pain and more
I climb to the top of the hillside
My beautiful girl at my side
I swing my sword at the sky
And we cry...
