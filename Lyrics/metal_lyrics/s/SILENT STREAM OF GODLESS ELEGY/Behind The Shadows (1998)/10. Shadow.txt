Hey you, I'm watching your steps for a long time
The sun stretches your shadows to me
I know you have no power
Without sight,
without thoughts
With feeling of cold fear

Hey you, you've forgotten something on your way
You've forgotten yourself, my friend
I think, you're going to fall down to knees today
Awfully tired in your shadow
