Ze stÃ­nÅ¯ hÃ¡dÃ¡m, ve dne snÃ­m,
Z ledu a zemÄ, to smÃ­m jÃ¡.
A svÄtlu noci uvÄÅÃ­m,
V ohni a snÄnÃ­ se mstÃ­m jÃ¡.

Z plamenÅ¯ hÃ¡dÃ¡m, ve dne snÃ­m,
Z ohnÄ a kostÃ­, to smÃ­m jÃ¡,
Z kamenÅ¯ hÃ¡dÃ¡m, v noci bdÃ­m,
Z dlanÃ­ a peÅÃ­ se mstÃ­m...

[English translation:]

I HAVE TWO SHADOWS

In the fire I burn
While you sleep.
Daytimes you revenge
In a sheen,
The pain of your breath,
The scream. Through herbs
And hair you beam.
Dreaming
In a fervent coal,
From wind you guess,
From broken bowl,
Cracking
And crying, you wail,
From ash you trail.

I have two shadows.
Guess while you sleep,
Give you the sorrow,
You must believe,
I have two shadows...

From shadows I guess
And daytimes sleep,
Also from ice
And land and the deep,
In night I beiieve
In scary dream,
Inside the fire
My revenge will beam.
From flames
I guess
And daytimes sleep.

Also from fire
And bones and the deep,
From stone I guess,
Night without dream,
In palms and feathers
My revenge will beam.
