We shall Go...

no God can Stop the steps
no Hands can Mute Silence
he Lives in Dirty thoughts
he Rapes the Clearest ones

We shall go - so let Bells Ring
We shall go - through Endless Plains
We shall go - through Beautiful Gardens
We shall go - through Pain and Ecstasy
We shall go - Armoured in Blood
We shall go - Loaden with Guilt
We shall go - Knowing of Sin
We shall go - through Pleasure and Pain

virginal Blood of Thoughts
of Those afraid to Look
blushing Shame of Your own
Unbelievers in Presence of God

Cross on the hill Pulled Down
Irons loosened Eyes open wide
everything Sacred is Dead
the Jaws are opened and We ? Shall Go !

delighted Bow Down in thoughts
unscared before Devil's Scream
conscious hiss Call never Ends
no doubt for Faith he will Ask

We shall go - so let Bells Ring
We shall go - through Endless Plains
We shall go - through Beautiful Gardens
We shall go - through Pain and Ecstasy
We shall go - Armoured in Blood
We shall go - Loaden with Guilt
We shall go - Knowing of Sin
We shall go - in Pleasure and Pain
