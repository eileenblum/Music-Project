Pope Is the Best among my Friends
with his Help I Finish my Work
building an Idol in the Face of God
and Held he'll be in his Arms

Cry of Glory - I Shout through his Mouth
Cry of Glory - hides Away the Sun
Cry of Glory - hides Away all Sights
Cry of Glory - Forever it shall be Eternal...

i'm the Devil's Eye
i'm Everywhere...

Pope is the last among my Friends
with his Help I Finish my Song
crushing Down the Idol Facing the World
and Hell will Rule Forever in My Heart...

Archangel of Reign supreme
Messenger of Light unseen
Watcher of the Gate Disease
Lucipher my Soul's Relieve
i'm Nowhere
finding Sight where No One Seeks
i'm You...

Cry of Glory...
...Eternal

i'm the Devil's Eye
i'm Everywhere...

i'm Devil's Heart
i'm Everlasting Light
...Eternal
i'm your God's Son
i'm You
...Eternal...
