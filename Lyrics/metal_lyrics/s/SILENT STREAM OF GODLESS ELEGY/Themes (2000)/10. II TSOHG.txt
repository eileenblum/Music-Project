i'm the Master of Fears
you are in the Room
i am in Your Head
you're on the Ceremonial Bed
i am a True Ghost
and you're Not the First
i'm the Master of Fears
you are in the Room

obey me your Master of Fear
cause You must Wait for Me
Blood keeps flowing in Your Head
as i approach our Wedding Bed
cause i am the True Ghost
and You are Not the First

i'm the Master of Fears...
Not the First...
