do You think about Love ?
so What do You think about ?
do You think about Life ?
so What do You feel within ?

all the Things You see accumulate
the Beauty in Thee fades to gray
nothing Is pure and stays the Same way
so What do You feel Inside ?
empty Words You say eradicate
all Things You feel too Late

Lovin' on the Earth
like a Cancerous spider in Your Heart
a Tombstone for the Pure ones Dead
all the Filth was Beauty in my Eyes
Everything died
now that Love Lies Bleeding
of Hate and Pain I Cry
now that Love Lies Bleeding
splendour Blinds my Eyes
now that Love Lies Bleeding
Everything dies
now that Love Lies Bleeding

do You think of it Now ?
so where's Your Hatred now ?
do You think of the Times ?
so What do You think of Them Now ?
all Things You see I consecrate
Poison, there's Poison in Them

Lovin' on the Earth...

Love Lies
do You think about Death ?
so do You think about Love ?
so do You think ?
Love Lies Bleeding...

Lovin' on the Earth...
