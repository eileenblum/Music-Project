My hair of black flax
My voice of bull horn
Harvest your wheat before I get my crop
And let evil spirits go

My beard a field of corn
My breath a dust of hooves
Harvest your wheat before I get my crop
And let evil spirits go

The rain of my tears
Shall drown your anger
So pound in the skies more than I do
And let evil spirits go
