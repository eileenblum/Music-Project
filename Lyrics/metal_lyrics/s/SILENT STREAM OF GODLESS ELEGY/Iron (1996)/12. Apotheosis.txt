(He must come to Stone Sky)

Blind, I don't want to See the Truth
striping Crust of Time
I knew he hadn't been Right
he must Come to Stone Sky

I will Wait till late at Night
I will Wait for my Faith
in Dream Colours aren't Real
in Dream I feel Despair

I See crocks of Glass
all's the Truth full of Lies
I want to find Way to Die
to Fuck your Stone Sky

I don't want to See the Truth, I don't Want

I will Wait till late at Night
I will Wait for my Faith
in Dream Colours aren't Real
in Dream I feel Despair
