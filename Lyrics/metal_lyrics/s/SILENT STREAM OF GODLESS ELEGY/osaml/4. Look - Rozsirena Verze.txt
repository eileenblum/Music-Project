When you fly - like a bird - like a string - you are
When you tune - like a wood - like a flute - across sky

I'm playing - and flying - like a bird - like a string
I'm stretching - I'm sounding - like I'm in the wind
Look at me boy when I dance

I'm dancing - blossoming - like a flying leaf
I'm basking in the sunshine - boy look at me
Look at me boy when I smile
Look at me boy when I dance

Look at me boy - I'm singing
Look at me boy - I call wind
Like a forest like a flute
I'm hiding under tones
Soil and sound - bang and tree
Will stroke me when I'm dancing
Soil and sound - bang and tree
Will stroke when I dance

Look at me boy - I smell sweet
Look at me boy - I'm breathing
Like a meadow I turn green
Like a flower never seen

Playing - flying - like a string
Stretching - sounding - in the wind

Look at me boy - I'm singing
- I look at you - girl - singing
Look at me boy - I call wind
- I look at you - girl - call wind
Like a forest like a flute
- Like a forest like a flute
I'm hiding under tones
- you're hiding under tones
Soil and sound - bang and tree
- Soil and sound - bang and tree
Will stroke me when I'm dancing
- will stroke you when you dance
Soil and sound - bang and tree
- Soil and sound - bang and tree
Will stroke me when I dance
- stroke you when you dance...
