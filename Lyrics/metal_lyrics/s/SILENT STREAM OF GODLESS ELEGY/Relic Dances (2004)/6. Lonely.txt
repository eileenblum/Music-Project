Lonely at night - dark - bellman and time - snow under feet

Lonely in snow - cold - and under ice - tarrying white fate

Lonely - by day and night - crying in room
Only calm that remains at the end of day
Lonely - golden corn stooks - lightning from sky
And again one more cross at the end of the day

Lonely at day - shine - midday witch comes - for lonely child

Lonely at home - calm - and somewhere out - tarrying your fate

Lonely - by day and night - crying in room
Only - calm that remains - at the end of day
Lonely - golden corn stooks - lightning from sky
And again one more cross at the end of the day
