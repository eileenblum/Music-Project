I would get up, get up, my beloved, go to the fields
We'll cut the grass, we'll spread the hay
Now, my love...
I would get up, get up, my beloved, run to the hills
We'll bake the bread, we'll dress our wounds
Come, my love...

I would dance my love
Take me
This evening I would dance my love
Take me
We wear down this night
I will close my eyes
Kiss me
This evening I will close my eyes
Kiss me
We wear down this night

I would get up, get up, my beloved, go to the fields
We'll cut the grass, we'll spread the hay
Now, my love...
I would get up, get up, my beloved, run to the hills
We'll bake the bread, we'll dress our wounds
Come, my love...

I would dance my love
Take me
This evening I would dance my love
Take me
We wear down this night
I will close my eyes
Kiss me
This evening I will close my eyes
Kiss me
We wear down this night

I would dance my love
Take me
This evening I would dance my love
- dance my love
Take me
We wear down this night
I will close my eyes
Kiss me
This evening I will close my eyes
- come my love
Kiss me
We wear down this night
Alone I twist a wreath
For you
- for me
My darling now I twist a wreath
- alone
Alone
I mourn for you love...
