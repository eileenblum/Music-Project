Hidden deep - in mother earth - together - but not as one
In pure love - so close they stay - together - but not as one
Now hidden deep - in mother earth - but not as one - they dwell

Now - deep - in mother earth
Hidden deep - in mother earth - but not as one

Now we pray to our gods - to make a miracle
To fall together - in doom's embrace both as one

The only what remains of them - two drops of blood blazing
In the first one flame of her - in the other flame of his
Together - but not as one

Now we pray to our gods - to make a miracle
To fall together - in doom's embrace both as one
And now hidden deep we are - in mother earth together
