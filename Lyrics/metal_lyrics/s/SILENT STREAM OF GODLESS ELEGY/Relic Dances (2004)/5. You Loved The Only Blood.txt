Grim reaper came - from mountain peaks
Came to the boy and his young girl
Grim reaper came - from fiery hills
There's only one who can survive

Crying is heard - black death comes now
There's only crying - there's only child
Crying is heard 'cause she's coming now
You loved the only blood

Tearful time came - plague walked away
And you have a scarf at door flying
Tearful time came - 'cause she took her
'cause nothing stays the same as was before

The bell is heard - singing from hill
It can bring life the same as it can kill
The bell is heard - whispering the doom
You loved the only blood

Twenty years have passed like a raft down river oder stream
Beautiful girl came into house with her beloved boy
Crying is heard again - it was her love
Which brought that happiness into your heart

Reaper comes now - from mountain peaks
You want to meet him with a smile on lips
Reaper comes now - from mountain peaks
He wants to meet you as he wants to reap

The bell is heard - singing its grief
It's only sin what your life has achieved
The bell is heard - singing its grief
You loved the only blood
