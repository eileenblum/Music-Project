From three directions...

And the one from the west rides on a robust steed
Into their heart he put his war art
Under the hooves of horses he planted dragon's teeth
To prevent everybody from taking their pride

Silent wind is singing that people live now
Silent wind is singing to show us the way

And the one from the east led a bull
Into their heart he put his ploughed fields
From under the hooves of bulls he reaped dragon's teeth
To prevent everybody from taking their pride

And the one from the south came barefooted
Into their heart he put how to be a wise
Then he changed the teeth into people with his hands
Nobody will attempt to take our pride now

Silent wind...

From three directions the best ones stood here
To see a new nation through themselves
From three directions the best ones stood here
Nobody will attempt to take their pride

Silent wind...
