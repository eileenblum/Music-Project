I know - I know this tale
Find out - this is the end

I know - I know this tale
She's alone - with her pain
I see him - see him mad
Indeed I know - this is the end

This morrow I awoke little bit sooner
By the strange sense I'm guilty of a sin
Goin' away to the field I'm workin' at all the day
Oh god, could you rescue me?

Why not?! Why not my god?
This is the way - how to kill her pain
I see her - but I don't dare
To face her doom - to face the end

Oh my god! Am I blame?
Crying lake... oh god, could you rescue me?
River is getting dark red like scale in our bed
Am I blame? Oh god, could you rescue me?

I know - I know why
She couldn't try to - try to fly
We all saw her - but didn't dare
Try to, try to fly...
