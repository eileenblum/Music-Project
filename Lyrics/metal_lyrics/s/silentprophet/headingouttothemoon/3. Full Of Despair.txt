[Music: Arthur Maia, lyrics: Arthur Maia, JoÃ£o Duart]

A glimpse of reflection 
And I see the light 
I wake up from a deep nightmare. 
People around 
They walk through the dark 
It seems that they're all blind. 

There's no regret 
I look through their eyes 
And just see no sign of life. 
Living in hell 
Following one's mind command 
And waiting for a promise Land. 

I try to run 
Against people flow 
Ahead to a place of my own 
Nobody sees me 
And no one believes me 
About all the lies they have told 

Mystical words 
From fire arise 
Controlling all hopeless soul's life
I hear angels crying 
Where babies are dying 
The abyss of death burns my eyes. 

No!
No we can't fight in this war alone. 
We must protect our angels from the ones 
Who are struggling to make us their own 
Building a fortress to stick on his Throne 

Devil's fire is burning their hearts 
By the words that take those people's mind away 
Devil's hand is on command 
Of the path to false promise Land 
Leading their way... 

I'm aware
Now we can put silence away 
We're ready to fight! 
For freedom we fight! 
The voices are led by our own minds 
Full of despair
