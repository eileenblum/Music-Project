[Music: Arthur Maia, lyrics: JoÃ£o Duart]

Walking the bounds of the Earth 
We see some prophets that rule 
This world of terror 
Spitting the truth 
What is truth after all, my friend? 

What is calling for you? 
Is this your will at all? 
(Take this doubt from me) 
Your silent screams of Anger 
Or deceivers that reign by playing God? 
(Silence fills my spirit)

Follow the fallen Angel 
Claim the power you have 
Behold a new man whose creed is his will 
Hear that voice that calls you now

What is calling for you? 
Is this your will at all? 
(Take this doubt from me) 
Your silent screams of Anger 
Or deceivers that reign by playing God? 
(Silence fills my spirit)

Fog of illusions 
They brought the confusion 
To every mind, 
Leading them straight to the darkest days. 

What is calling for you? 
Is this your will at all? 
(Take this doubt from me) 
Your silent screams of Anger 
Or deceivers that reign by playing God? 
(Silence fills my spirit) 

So this call is up to you 
The insurrection's yet to come 
With many screams of anger 
But in silence you'll reign without any gods
