[Music and lyrics: Arthur Maia]

Every time I close my eyes 
It seems I come back in time 
Somewhere, somehow, 
When I dreamed to fly through the stars

My mind goes on a long road 
Just a glimpse of my past and still 
Bring me tears, I can't deny 
Sweet memories that always come back 

On my face I can feel the breeze 
Washing my yearning innocent tears 
Staring at your genuine smile 
Calms down my wishful heart 

Small seeds turning now to old trees 
Grown on a perfect ground 
Witness of our never ending love 
Watered by the falling rain 

Smelling a sweet perfume 
You come from an old house's door 
A place where my spirit may go 
When I follow you through above 

On my face I can feel the breeze 
Washing my yearning innocent tears 
Staring at your genuine smile 
Calms down my wishful heart 

Opened eyes, back in my senseless life 
Without your touch sadness comes into my eyes 

I wish I could see you one last time 
To say how much I miss you after our goodbye
