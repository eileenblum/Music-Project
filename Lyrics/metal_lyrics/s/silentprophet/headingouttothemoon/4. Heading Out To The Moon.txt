[Music: Arthur Maia, JoÃ£o Duart, lyrics: JoÃ£o Duart]

Many men, millions minds 
Leaders dictating the truth 
And I wonder why they lie
Even when we can see through them 

And the voices of deceivers 
Only make us blind 
But when silence comes to your mind 
(inside your mind) 
We shall rise again 

So we're rising 
Heading out to the Moon 
Where the silence 
And peace remain 

They darken all our dreams 
Making us weak on this fight 
But somehow we'll see the light 
Inside the shadows today 

And so on we get to know 
The life they make us live 
And the reckoning is near 
(inside our mind) 
When we rise again 

So we're rising 
Heading out to the Moon 
Where the silence 
And peace remain 
So we're rising 
Heading out to the Moon 
Where the silence 
And peace remain

What if I once have cried when I couldn't say that I love you 
I'm not ashamed of it 
So let me take you, dear 
Out of the illusions of Earth 
In a space travel somehow 

When the world starts to break 
And there's someone to blame 
Then we see we're alone 

When there's no place to rest 
We head out to the Moon 
Where the silence remains 

Heading out to the Moon we fly 
Where the silence remains 
Heading out to the Moon we fly 
Where our thoughts can be heard 

When we reach the silence 
The answers will be heard 
We just need to reach the silence
