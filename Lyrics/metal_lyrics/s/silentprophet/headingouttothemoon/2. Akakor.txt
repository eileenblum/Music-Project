[Music and lyrics: Arthur Maia]

Born of a sin 
Became forest King 
Master of the thirteen gates 
A land no one sees 
A place of mystery 
Protected by the jungle spirits 

Mesmerizing eyes playing with people's minds 
Conveying truths through all those lies 
As trained dogs following their master 
Blind through the maze, maybe it's too late! 

OH! 
Open your eyes! 
Look all this beauty 
Go! 
Go one by one 
Don't look behind 
Don't call me guilty 
I led you to your sacrifice 

No one will find the way back! 
This land is all mine 
The treasures I found will be lost with me when I die! 

OH! 
Open your eyes! 
Look all this beauty 
Go! 
Go one by one 
Don't look behind 
Don't call me guilty 
I led you to your sacrifice 

The legend lives on 
Akakor was told 
The greatest empire of all 
The king's still alive 
Protecting the gates 
Of madness that he creates 

OH! 
Open your eyes! 
Look all this beauty 
Die! 
Die one by one 
Don't be afraid 
You are the guilty. 
You tried to steal my paradise!
