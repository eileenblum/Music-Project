[Japan bonus track]

In the shadows
I've been waiting
Waited so long
And attended the line

My frozen tears like
Diamonds they shimmer
In my eyes
Now I've lost all of my pride

These years have
Blinded my eyes
Like flames they burn inside
All of my fears have
Opened up my eyes
To see the truth of believing

My broken dreams are
Made of sorrow
I can hide them nowhere else
Than in my memories
These stories of life
Believing and waiting
Do i have the time to across the line

These tears have
Blinded my eyes
Like the flames they burn inside
All of my years have
Opened up my eyes
To realize the truth of believing

The truth of believing

These years have
Blinded my eyes
In the flames
I'll burn inside
All of my fears have
Made me realize
What's the truth of believing
