Here I am
I writing this letter alone
I'm sorry that it's stained
By my tears

These words I wrote
Brought up the pain again
Memories still haunting me
I can't get Through at all

You better stand and think for a while
Read through these word I wrote
I've never begged you stay before
Is there a time to look behind?

Its too late
To bring you back into my life
Since I have dwelled
In my sorrow

My greatest fall
Was that I let you go
I hope there is sometime
Something more

Oh no
