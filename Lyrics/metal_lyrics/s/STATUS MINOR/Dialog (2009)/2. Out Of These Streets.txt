So many days I have
Been so weak and confused
If I will try harder
I will find words to scream

So many days I have
Been fading to oblivion
Somedays there will be more
And now I know the Truth

So these years do not matter
After all I see it so clear
If these steps I took open another
Door to see something real

Too many days we have
Lived in this room together
How many days have we
Search for another truth?

Too many, too much
Your blindness made me give up
My mistake, my promise
I will give up again

So I tried to find another way
Out of this reality
Maybe someday I'll find someone other
Who helps me out of here
Away from these streets
Out of these streets
Out of these streets

You think you'll find the way
But you have toy stay
You have to stay
