Walking onwards through my life
Bitter, grim smile upon my face
Climbing up while I'm sinking down
Still never gaining ground

Step by step, inch by inch
Pressing forwards, fighting on
Deafened by the roaring wind
Brought back from walk to crawl

Striving to display my worth
Live the dream, I've been told
Glory is within my reach
Lust and greed, I'm unbound

Shackled down into my chair
Transparent walls are caving in
Keep on running, there's no time
No time to look behind

Like a drone I turn this wheel
Outstanding results: faster, more
Exalted part of winning team
Improve before you fall

I'm tired to display my worth
Live your dreams like you told
Always staying out of reach
Too much speed, crashing down

Reaching towards the burning sun
Ashes in ground
I'm falling away but wheels still turn
Spare parts eager to fix the machine
They will be tomorrow
Consumed by the names of your desire
