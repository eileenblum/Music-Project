I've been waited for years
To open up my mind
I've been held back by fears
Before I opened up my eyes

Maybe tomorrow will answer my call
I will follow you until I fall

I've been cheated with tears
Before I learned to recognize
You have played this masquerade
I can see it now with clear eyes

You can hold on
And steal my dreams
Hide 'em in the shadows
And make believe
Fed by your lies, tied down by deceit
Do you hear my scream?
I'm so scared
