I hear your words
They make no sense
I'm telling you
Open your eyes
And understand
There's no way through

Chains are broken
I am roaming free
To live a dream you never will

Driven by devil
Babe why don't you join me for a ride?
Splitting my face you'll see
A shining maniac smile

I am free
No one stands in my way
Come with me
I want you

Can't you see
I have chosen my way
Like the wind
No promises to break
You can beg
But you cannot make me stay
Tonight the world is mine to take

The way you move tells me
What you want to do
No wrong or right
Nothing more than me and you
Go at full speed
Oh this is what we need
Hold my hand tight
Just for this night...
