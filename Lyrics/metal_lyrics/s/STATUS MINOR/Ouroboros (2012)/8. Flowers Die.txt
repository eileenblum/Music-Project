I'm staring through the wall
Your words ringing in my head
Something is different, I know
I can't erase the words
I can't take away the pain
The pain that made you go
I must walk alone through the snow

If I could fly like a bird
Beyond the seas
I would overcome my pride and tell
How I long for days we shared
How I long for sleepless nights
The nights you showed me why
This can't be our last good-bye

We just let the flower die
Just let the flower die

Summer on my skin
Cooled down by the ice within
I feel my life passing by
I slowly close my eyes
And I'm thinking of you
How it all can sound like a lie
Can we still be us if we try?

I smile and play the game
Try hard not to go insane
I'm held under lock and key
I remember every word
I recall all the hurt
When you told that I am not me
Can I finally go and live free?

And just let the flower die
At last I am alone
I'll walk home, become something better
Won't run across the street
I won't knock on your door
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hold you in my arms
It is too late
It is our last good-bye

Let the flower die, let the flower die
I won't knock on your door
Let the flower die
I don't want to see your face again
Just let the flower die
Don't wanna hold you in my arms
It is too late, it is too late

Just let the flower die...
