End of the day, suck out the joy
Of what I hold dear
Hate burns inside, make it the fuel
But don't let it rule
Those who are near

False expectations
I can't meet, they rule my life
Not what we want to be
Turns harmony to strife
There's no surrender
In a way we both are right
Talking things through is for fools

Forsaken hope in your eyes
Devoured by the fire
Smile, the pain in disguise
Feeling like a liar
Poison, it burns inside

I walk my way, all for themselves
Here I'm the law, my own reality
We are the same, within our worlds
The reason divine
Can't walk with me

Forsaken hope in your eyes
Devoured by the fire
Smile, the pain in disguise
Feeling like a liar
Desire to control's a crime
Resentment we are breeding
We can't conform all the time
Hearts will end up bleeding
Poison, it burns inside

Should I let one flower die
To grow another one?
Could they prosper, side by side
Coexistence, it can't be doomed to fall

Pain disguised...
