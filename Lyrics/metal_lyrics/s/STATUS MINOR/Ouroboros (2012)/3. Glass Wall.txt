Who are you
What are you doing to me?
I am losing control
Should I go?
Is it safer to stay?
Insecurity is eating me

No fear of going down tonight
You gave me a reason to fly

Every day
Fingers pressed tight
Against the glass wall
Are you true?
Am I after shadows like a fool?

Tell me why
All I know is your name
Feels like a changeling
Standing in your place
All the days
When we played our game
Lose their meaning
Upon your skin

Once more I'm wide awake at night
Under the glass moon light
The dawn approaches
Boils my blood
I can't wait to feel it again

If I never feel again
Your trembling sigh
I will lay down today
And never rise again
Tracing paths on your skin
I feel so much
More alive than ever felt before...
