In darkness I lie
Cold hand
Is clutching my heart
No sweet lullaby
No way, it tears me apart

Snake in paradise
Delight turns to woe
The smile in your eyes
Why can't it let me go?

Those eyes, that gaze
I feel so hollow
It burns in my heart
It hurts my soul

I'm praying for night
To take away my pain
But instead I fight
To find you again
I need to find you again...
