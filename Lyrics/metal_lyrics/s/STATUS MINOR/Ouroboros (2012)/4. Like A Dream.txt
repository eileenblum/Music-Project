A glimmer of stars in your eyes
Words sweet like honey
I know they are true
The rainbow is ours to follow
Through innocence
We find paradise

Like a dream
All that I've ever been asking for
Like a dream
No we won't be gone by tomorrow
Gone by tomorrow

I hadn't talked 'bout forever
Now I know that we are going there
Before I had thought that I'd never
Learn what it feels like
When you share

Your life with someone else
And give willingly away
Your precautions
For trusting someone
Open up your heart
And lay bare your hidden pain
Now I'm doing all that for you

Call of eventide
I want you by my side
Lifelines intertwine
Until the end of time...
