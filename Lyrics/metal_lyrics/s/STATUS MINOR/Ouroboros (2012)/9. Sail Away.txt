Longing for dawn
Silent screams, I listen
Feel like a god
Next moment, eyes glisten

I never thought I would break
That I could not take the fall
You taught me pain unlike
Anything I Have felt before

Tell me when we meet again
Could we restore the fire that died?
Let me down, help me drown
I know I won't come back this time

Now, I must go
Finding paths to be followed
Dragged down no my by the chains
The chains are gone
No longer on my knees
I will let you sail away from my life

The darkness is too deep
I'm hopelessly lost in oblivion
The hatred in my eyes
Dried out, won't guide me home

Leave me be, set me free
I sincerely ask you to go
I will die if I cannot fly
I need to become myself
Please understand me

You sailed away from my life
You sailed away
You sailed away from my life
We sailed away

Now I've seen it all
Now I've had my fall
I have led myself astray
You may think that you are right
Rejoice at my heart contrite
I will tell you one more time
It was our last goodbye

I will never play the game
Or I will surely go insane
I know I was meant to fly free
Leave the suffering behind
Walk away, don't be blind
I know I'll find the way
Smile on my face I will say

Just let the flower die
At last I'm alone
I'll walk home
Become something better
Won't run across the street
I won't knock on your door
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hold you in my arms
It is too late
It is our last goodbye...
