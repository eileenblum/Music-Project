I play you, allay you
This game is mine, has been all night
I'll use you, seduce you
Morning comes, you're cast aside

Blinding light of dawn, can't be undone
Wash away the blood and clean my gun
Nevermore sincere, it's all a lie

Torn inside
The stain of shame - must reveal it
Can't confide
And risk destroying the facade

You evade me, you doubt me
Is it true or merely in my mind?
I'm frightened, dead tired
From keeping all the guilt within, confined
I'm withered, so broken
Here is my gift to you

When I look into your eyes, I feel
Deep inside you know we are not real
Confidence and trust deserve to die

Here we stand
Apart yet together
We had our dream
Cast down to hell

Here we stand
Apart yet together
Cast to hell...
