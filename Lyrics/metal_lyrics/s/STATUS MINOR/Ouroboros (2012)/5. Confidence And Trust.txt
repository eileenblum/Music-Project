Blinding light of dawn
Can't be undone
Wash away the blood
And clean the gun
Nevermore sincere
It's all a lie

When I look into your eyes, I feel
Deep inside you know we are not real
Confidence and trust deserve to die

Torn inside, the stains of shame
Must reveal it, can't confide
And risk destroying the facade...
