Went to a gay-club
Sent by a friend of mine
He knew a little lady
Waitin' for me inside

I said, ";Man, don't be kiddin'!";
I don't want to change my style
Could not believe my eyes when
I saw who I have found

Lady, tell me what to do
What can I do
Lady, I need a doctor
To help me to cure
My longin' for you

See you later
That's what she said to me
I could not believe that she gave me her key
See you later
The only fact I know
I can't let her go
See you later

Like a cat in a lonesome alley
Like a wolf in a midnight town
I've been struck down by confusion
Straight here in my heart
