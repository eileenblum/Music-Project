...UPRIGHT LIAR

Human genius rules the world
Explores the depth and height
Enables us to use the word
To give us peace of mind

I'll need all strength, I'll fight against a demon
Who's leading us to deep disastrous down
Dressed in white his lips make folks believe him
He's the man to choose again to wear the nation's crown
At any time, at any place
Old spirits with old thoughts
Unstable crowd is mesmerized
Salutes an Upright

Liar
Arms in motion
Liar, merciless urge

Like a number on the tumbling dice
Not aware of where you'll lie
At the end you'll pay the highest price
Boundless blame will bare your name

Too many brains are stormed, their hearts are burning
Mind surrenders, passion strikes the truth
Words taste sweet as honey: Eat by learning!
I'm a lonely soul of doubts fearful of the news

Mind pollution
Phrases squeeze my ears
Rage escorts my tears

At any time, at any place
Old spirits with old thoughts
Unstable crowd is mesmerized
Salutes an Upright

Liar
Arms in motion
Liar, merciless urge

Like a number on the tumbling dice
Not aware of where you'll lie
At the end you'll pay the highest price
Boundless blame will bare your name

One's tongue in one's cheek
Praying words while the conscience sleeps
Mental dying all around
Bleating sheep the shepherd found

Big brother loves his siblings without mercy
He pretends to keep them snug and safe
But once a week on dreadful bloody thursday
You can hear the whip tormenting disobedient slaves

Mind pollution
Phrases squeeze my ears
Rage escorts my tears

At any time, at any place
Old spirits with old thoughts
Unstable crowd is mesmerized
Salutes an Upright

Liar
Arms in motion
Liar, merciless urge

Like a number on the tumbling dice
Not aware of where you'll lie
At the end you'll pay the highest price
Boundless blame will bare your name
