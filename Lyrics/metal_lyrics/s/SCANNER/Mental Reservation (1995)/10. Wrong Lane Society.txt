I made my decision to let nothing undone to
escape out of this hell. After several trials I
reached the top of the volcano one day,
living my people and some slaughtered
creatures behind. It took me 2 months until
my float ran ashere at a stony coast. I had
returned to civilisation. Cities were rebuilt
and the people had learned how to handle
the radioactive contamination. The society
did not change too much. Still there was
poor and rich, the difference between the
colors of skin and the money was rulling the
world again. Just the population in each city
had increased to an amount of 50 millions
because living in the outlands was not pos-
sible. I was one of over 6 millions unemployed
people in the city and the government had
still no idea to solve this problem. There was
an explosive mood under the troop of unem-
ployed people and most of them damned
this...

...WRONG LANE SOCIETY

Spend my life in misery
And stand it going on
But recently I got this dream
Lasting all night long

Woke up to my damned disaster
Expected nothing new
But someone there's been kidding me
He tidied up my room

No stink and no poisoned cockroach
No dust of ages
Either found my boots nor blue jeans
That's why I tried to escape

Living on the wrong lane
Welcome to the ball of pride and glory
Living on the wrong lane
Take what the mob gives to you
The mob gives to you

Walking through my strange dream
People stared at him
At first I didn't recognize
I showed my nude pin

I was called Mr. McDonnald
Relleased from by mess
Was treated like millionaires
When I reached downtown

Could buy me some silken clothes
No need to pay cash
Was invited to Hilton Hotel
Changes I could not explain

Living on the wrong lane
Welcome to the ball of pride and glory
Living on the wrong lane
Take what the mob gives to you
The mob gives to you

Folks I'm gonna tell you honestly I have this dream
Captured in a symphony of living easily
Enjoyed my life like it had been before I reached that realm
Boring situation if I'd become a rich fat man

No silken socks and no credit
No golden cages
Wanna live in my dirty chamber
Don't care if life's trash remains

Living on the wrong lane
Fuck off to the ball of pride and glory
Living on the wrong lane
Give what the snob's gossip needs
