One year later I found a job at eddy's chip-
repair. The work was not bad and many peo-
ple brought whole data-consoles to our ser-
vice center. One day I recognized Albert
Twostone on the screen of a data-station I
was going to repair. Although I could not
understand what he was talking there was no
doubt that he was candidate of the next
election for governer. The new governer was
Albert and within a period of 3 month our
city lay under an embarge of all other cities.
He brought on a crisis which was accompa-
nied by his campaigne to selve this problem
with the weapon he had developed himself:
the quarks-streamer. It was a hot sunny day
when I started the engine of my small jet-
beat and Albert started his first quarks-

...20th CENTURY CRUSADE

The orange is peeled, rapped are the brains
Hopes are all lost
Apocaliptic: "Live and let die"
Love's dying first

Blessed is the power of death
The ultimate god and leader
Respectfully called: the best
Ruling their mind's fateful disease

Watch out - Lurking in the dark
Stay tuned - Set your controls and hark

Hell arised to demise it's legacy
No prayer to pray
Heaven waits, hesitates, looks for a better deal
Johnny - boy, a shepherd boy, and the lamb
Marked off the way
But the beast from the east obviliating them now
Broke the seventh seal

Upcoming fears, horror of cries
Kicking your ass
Approximate lie, nipped at it's rise
Don't cause a mess

Seer, or thing of evil, where does my fortune lie?

Watch out - Lurking in the dark
Stay tuned - Set your controls and hark

Hell arised to demise it's legacy
No prayer to pray
Heaven waits, hesitates, looks for a better deal
Johnny - boy, a shepherd boy, and the lamb
Marked off the way
But the beast from the east obviliating them now
Broke the seventh seal

Who made who
Who released the beast
Who breaks through
To fire first - danger
Born just to be lost

Cursing with joy spit out of hell
Agression and hate
Satanic forces are tolling the bells
Sealed is the fate

Blessed is the power of death
The ultimate god and leader
Respectfully called: the best
Ruling their mind's fateful disease

Watch out - Lurking in the dark
Stay tuned - Set your controls and hark

Hell arised to demise it's legacy
No prayer to pray
Heaven waits, hesitates, looks for a better deal
Johnny - boy, a shepherd boy, and the lamb
Marked off the way
But the beast from the east obviliating them now
Broke the seventh seal

There is not much to tell anymore. Clinton
Island lies under a dense stratum of clouds
wich did not change for month now. Down
from the cliff I watch the ocean. More or less
hopeful to see survivers one day. And at
some days it seems to me that God's face
breaks through the stratum of clouds and a
tear sliding on his cheek sets out to fill the
ocean.
