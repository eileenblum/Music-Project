Hundreds of thoughts were storming my
brain. The night head already spread out it's
cloth above the landscape. The willage of
Clinton Island with it's appreximately 200
inhabitance lays peacarful in the valley. Not
giving a hint to the terrible past of it's
inhabitance. Still I had not found a wife. And
once again I was captured by thoughts from
the hidden past right...

...OUT OF NOWHERE

Here I am at a standstill
No move I'm biding time
Desultoriness in my proceedings
Cought by her spell I'm coming

Out of Nowhere
May wounds be sutured without scars?
Out of Nowhere
Hatred to nurture?! So damned you are!

Still we live in the world
We're judged by the colour of skin
Plated with silver and gold
The radical changes in fits of spleen

And now more and more fed
With depressions backed
We're crying but nobody hears
Coming out!
Now I see I'm blind!

Out of Nowhere
Isn't the future termed by stars?
Out of Nowhere
Hatred to nuture?! So damned we are!!!

Die!

I remember... once I believed in God
But he left me in the lurch
Now I return, I build my own kingdom
I'll make your desires burn
And all the nightmares come true

Sweet lullabies

Darling, I've been held in your arms
Hear the truth, the freedom's bell
See this lie through the eyes of my hell

Here I am at a standstill, no move
Can't you see I'm crying out
There's no sun in the shadow of unrequited love
Caught by it's spell I'm raving mad
Keep the silence, I'll make it burn!

Out of Nowhere
May wounds be sutured without scars?
Out of Nowhere
Hatred to nurture?! So damned you are!

Out of Nowhere
Isn't the future termed by stars?
Out of Nowhere
Hatred to nurture?! So damned we are!
