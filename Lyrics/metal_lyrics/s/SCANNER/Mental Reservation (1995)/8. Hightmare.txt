While years were passing by on the Island a
troop of childer was growing up, bare of
any experience of war and dictatorship. All in
all we lived in a peacarful and self-sufficient
society. Meanwhile I had become president
of our little nation. And Clinton Island was
our little kingdom. But one day all children
were spirit away. Dark clouds were handing
above there volcano at that time and it might
have been a sign of satanic mights. And at
one night during the rainy season some
strange creatures sleeped out of the volcano
down to the village. Like paralized and under

...NIGHTMARE

Welcome to your joyful plotted nightmare
Yeah, this cute horror-trip was booked for you
Don't dare to flee before this night
Has climbed it's gorgeous peak
Enjoy the games of shadow-mights
The growth of satan's seed

Coroner's dance
They've come to lead you to the dark
Coroner's dance
Your life is at stake
No chance to awake
Out of your Nightmare

One sperm caused your total incarnation
Millions let their life for you to live
Now tables turned the other way
Your body for a soul
Still caught in hell to be released
With your infernal fall

Coroner's dance
They've come to lead you to the dark
Coroner's dance
Your life is at stake
No chance to awake
Out of your Nightmare

So every time you close your eyes
Beware to fall asleep
Cause creatures from the other side
They gratify their greed

Coroner's dance
They've come to lead you to the dark
Coroner's dance
Your life is at stake
No chance to awake
Out of your Nightmare
