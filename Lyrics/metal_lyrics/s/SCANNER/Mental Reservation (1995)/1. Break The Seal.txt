The past deleted. What's left are my mem-
ories. They threaten to vanish more and
more before being told the first time. So I will
try to escape out of my MENTAL RESERVATION
to record what happened. We lived in
peace 'till the day the earth burst open and a
dark appearing creature gave a crystal - key
to a little boy called Boris Jay. Boris was
taught by the creature how to use the key
and to...

...BREAK THE SEAL

It's the hour, the cypher for rebirth
A poisoned arrow is darted
Liberation, one hope against the dearth
Striving for help, but the factions started
The screams of pain - struggling in vain
To terminate over again

Look, man, how it's growing, this child
The chosen one
Listen, a raven cawing
Run wild, your time has come

Here, take the key
Open the gates of hell - Break the Seal
Fear, grant it, train people's mind
You'll make it real

Listen, how it's talking
Talk wild, going insane
Brave child, just keep on walking
You, child, who deals with the pain

Here, take the key
Open the gates of hell - Break the Seal
Fear, grant it, train people's mind
You'll make it real

Watch the red sunrise as the ground
Melts down
The final scene closely
See the final act more explicitly
Wait for the curtain to fall then follow it
To the rise

Read are all signs, trodden down the trails
The cryptograms of destruction
Last aggression this time unveils
On your way you got no obstructions

The screams of pain - struggling in vain
To terminate over again

Look, man, how it's growing, your child
The chosen one
Listen, a raven cawing
Run wild, your time has come

Here, take the key
Open the gates of hell - Break the Seal
Fear, grant it, train people's mind
You'll make it real
