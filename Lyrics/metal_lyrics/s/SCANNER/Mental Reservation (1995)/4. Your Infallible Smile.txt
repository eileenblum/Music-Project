[In these days of horror my vital energy disappeared. Even my sister, who gave me strength 'til then, was not able to beware myself from my surrender, anymore. One day she left us to support a medical convoy on the way to zene-66. Four days she resisted the fallout. Then they brought her back. Now, in my darkest moments I try to remember our sunny days, Eileen, and I'll never forget your infallible smile.]

We believed time would relieve all pain
Took an oath to honor faith forever
A willow, witness of secrets when
Childhood's dreams and wishes were told

Not wasting thoughts on sorrows
We shared a joyful time

Eileen, I'm wrestling for answers
All right the wind sighs goodbye
Eileen, there's no more tomorrow
With your infallible smile
Nothing remains but my tears

You made me fell I could let a rainbow rise
At a cloud-darkened grey sky
You've been my laughter, my sadness, a tender touch
I perceive your still lasting scent

You walked the stairs to heaven
One way too much that day

Eileen, I'm wrestling for answers
All right the wind sighs goodbye
Eileen, there's no more tomorrow
With your infallible smile
Nothing remains but my tears

You walked the stairs to heaven
One way too much that day

Eileen, I'm wrestling for answers
All right the wind sighs goodbye
Eileen, there's no more tomorrow
With your infallible smile
Nothing remains but my tears
