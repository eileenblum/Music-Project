A garden divine
With birds singing everywhere
The beast had lain in wait
To snatch you away

This creature is mine for eternity
I won't give it back, turn around
I'll take your life for disrespect
Don't dare if you want to survive

Surrender, it's just been my second thought
I will fight until the end to reach you again
No surrender, a word without any sense, now
Cause I won't leave you alone
Out in the dark on your own
So I decided to win the fight 'gainst the elements
Till the ferryman dies

A beautiful place
With red roses here and there
They had turned to black
When we walked to the trap

You've entered the reign of darkness, dear
Masked well as your big paradise
That's where you're led by your dirty greed
This victim now's paying the price

Surrender, it's just been my second thought
I will fight until the end to reach you again
No surrender, a word without any sense, now
Cause I won't leave you alone
Out in the dark on your own
So I decided to win the fight 'gainst the elements
Till the ferryman dies

Try what you want but you won't succeed
I'm a thousand times stronger than you
The ferryman is gonna bring you back
Be clever, your chance is too low

Surrender, it's just been my second thought
I will fight until the end to reach you again
No surrender, a word without any sense, now
Cause I won't leave you alone
Out in the dark on your own
So I decided to win the fight 'gainst the elements
Till the ferryman dies
