Blue heaven, the sky's wide open
The ocean lies still
I try to convince emotions
To follow my will

Then leaving my sorrows ten light-years behind
To free the prisoner out of my mind

Out tar, but still much too close
To my hard driven brain
This town pretends innocence
While it's watched from this way

Always alien
Mother earth is not my mum
Somehow miserable
I wish better days to come

Far from a distance calling
The forgotten one
It seems I'm an angel fallen
Down from where they come

Lost since my wings are broken
I am overdone
It seems that it was unspoken
That I'm here for fun

Always alien
Mother earth is not my mom
Somehow miserable
I wish better days to come

Far from a distance calling
The forgotten one
It seems I'm an angel fallen
Down from where they come

Lost since my wings are broken
I am overdone
It seems that it was unspoken
That I'm here for fun
