Once I used to call you friend
Thought I could change our fate
How serious this story ended
I noticed much too late

Sinner and saint, a stone on my way
Wrapped in a clothing of changes
Rival or friend, just faked 'till the end
Choking on lies. never knew what's meant

Look at me. I'm free
And the reason's: You are history
Blimey, so free
Look how joy 's takin' part of me

Different places, different times
When I needed help or advice
None of your statements was good enough
To justify their price

Sinner and saint, a stone on my way
Wrapped in a clothing of changes
Rival or friend, just faked 'till the end
Choking on lies, never knew what's meant

You were the master and I was the fool
I don't think, now that was pretty cool
Tables turned, they dig your grave
Have a look how a bad girl behaves

Sinner and saint, a stone on my way
Wrapped in a clothing of changes
Rival or friend, just faked 'till the end
Choking on lies, never knew what's meant

Look at me, I'm free
And the reason 's: You are history
Blimey, so free
Look how joy 's takin' part of me
