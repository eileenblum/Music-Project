When she asks the mirror
Hey you, is it me
There's always just silence
From her soul's deepest sea

She's lost in a world so strange around
Quiet senseless, no explanations found

So she started working on some things
A good help for everyone
She felt like an angel of fortune
Having done mercy

Sister Mary
Ordinary
Wipes out every stain of creation
Sister Mary
Poisoned Gary
Judged twice, Gary died under her immaculate eyes

She knows to tell what's right or wrong
But doesn't know her hands belong
To her body and her mind

She whispers God would lead her hands
He's gonna tell her till it ends
Who's the next who should be dying

So she started working on some things
A good help for everyone
She felt like an angel of fortune
Having done mercy

Sister Mary
Ordinary
Wipes out every stain of creation
Sister Mary
Poisoned Gary
Judged twice, Gary died under her immaculate eyes
