Blimey, I'm sitting wondering
Why I'm sweating like I do
I did not move myself for hours
So I got no explanation

The air that I breath's getting hotter
And I can't stand it here no more

I don't wanna grumble but we've got December
White Christmas was usual this season

Come, fly like an eagle as high as the sky
Take a look of our world from above
And tell what you see, is it bad, is it wise
What we all do nowadays

No one cares, if they lie to you
Good reason why you should worry
They say: Climate had sometimes been changing
And our world Was quite alright

But I never believed in the words they were telling
Cause bullshit can't taste like sweet candy

Come, fly like an eagle as high as the sky
Take a look of our world from above
And tell what you see, is it bad, is it wise
What we all do nowadays

Let's fly like an eagle as high as the sky
Take a look of our world from above
And tell what you see, is it bad, is it wise
What we all do nowadays
