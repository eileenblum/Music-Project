Now it's over I still can't believe
It sounds like a bad fee-faw-fum
Day by day all his geese were swans
Till his sticky end has come
The game was his love, his soul and joy
It acted in an underhand way
He didn't fight like Killkenny cats
He just run to make his play

Rien ne vas plus
Rouge ou noir
Faites les jeux madames et monsieur
La taute ou la nombre
Jour les cartes
Le dernier coup

Stop it you fool
Don't be blind
Stand up and go away
Stop it you fool
Open your mind
Don't be a loser

He bet on horses, on soccer, on dogs
He gained all his money away
The ball was dropped into the wheel
And so it went round day by day
The game sucked his life
He drew a blank
His look was quite good every day
The devil now things sweet lullabies
And he takes the damned gambler away

Rien ne vas plus
Rouge ou noir
Faites les jeux madames et monsieur
La taute ou la nombre
Jour les cartes
Le dernier coup

Stop it you fool
Don't be blind
Stand up and go away
Stop it you fool
Open your mind
Don't be a loser

He abandoned to despair
He backed down, that's what he could
Was a gambler day by day
Breaking down, that's just the end
He abandoned to despair
He backed down, that's what he could
Was a gambler day by day
Breaking down, breaking down
