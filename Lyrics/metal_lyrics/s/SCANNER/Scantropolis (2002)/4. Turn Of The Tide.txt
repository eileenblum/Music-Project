Now at the point of entry
We're blowing the dust away
We all have crossed the border
On our common way

And I'm relieved I reached the ferry
To the virginal shore
But what I see and what I got
Did not change towards before

Just some of my memories obscure from afar
The smell of the centuries ascends to the stars
And we left some more traces behind
Put a thousand-years-bundle aside

Turn of the tide
You, child of the ages
(Child of time, gift divine)
Turn of the tide
You're the mirror of changes
(Step by step, no regret)
Wisdom drifts on you

Our world 's a stormy island
Where stranded hopes cannot leave
Man's past is extensively violent
We're acting like what we believe (in)

And I'm relieved I reached the ferry
To the virginal shore
But what I see and what I got
Did not change towards before

Just some of my memories obscure from afar
The smell of the centuries ascends to the stars
And we left some more traces behind
Put a thousand- years-bundle aside

Turn of the tide
You, child of the ages
(Child of time, gift divine)
Turn of the tide
You're the mirror of changes
(Step by step, no regret)
Wisdom drifts on you

And I'm relieved I reached the ferry
To the virginal shore
But what I see and what I got
Did not change towards before

Just some of my memories obscure from afar
The smell of the centuries ascends to the stars
And we left some more traces behind
Put a thousand- years-bundle aside

Turn of the tide
You, child of the ages
(Child of time, gift divine)
Turn of the tide
You're the mirror of changes
(Step by step, no regret)
Wisdom drifts on you
