Seems everything in vain
It's one more time the same
You stand alone again down and lonely

Best friends have said good-bye
Without good reasons why
They stayed as long as they got their thrill

Forgotten and forgiven
That's how it often ends
At least we stand together
Good fellows hand in hand
Forgotten and forgiven
No hurts and no more pain
New friendship starting stainless
Like sunshine after rain
Like sunshine after rain
So hallowed be my name

A few days later on
Good feelings are all gone
When silence arises again
Forgotten and forgiven
That's how it often ends
At least we stand together
Good fellows hand in hand
Forgotten and forgiven
No hurts and no more pain
New friendship starting stainless
Like sunshine after rain
Like sunshine after rain
So hallowed be my name

Susan, Gary, Jill and Larry, some uncommon friends
Cause they are gonna leave you while you'd need them most

D.D., Steven, Lee the demon, suckers all the way
Next time I'll think twice before you're gonna waste my time

I am what I am
Just acting like I can
Mistaken, forsaken again

Forgotten and forgiven
That's how it often ends
At least we stand together
Good fellows hand in hand
Forgotten and forgiven
No hurts and no more pain
New friendship starting stainless
Like sunshine after rain
Like sunshine after rain
So hallowed be my name
