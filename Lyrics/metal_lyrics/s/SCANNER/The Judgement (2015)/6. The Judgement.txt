Someone said and I believed 
"Wealth is what you need" 
As victim of my circumstance 
I had a fateful greed

Certain habits long aboard 
Too hard to sacrifice 
Misled by the devilâs voice 
I knew Iâd meet him twice

When all the angels have been slain 
And the priests are dashed with pain 
The fragile bridge over troubled water of sins collides to the abyss

Watch the churches burn 
Itâs the devilâs turn 
Satan pulls the strings 
Look what tomorrow brings

Nearly I had everything 
That wishes could provide 
My darling wore twelve diamond rings 
She was my silken bride

When all the angels have been slain 
And Wall Street hustlers are your saints 
The fragile bridge over troubled water of sins collides to the abyss

Watch the churches burn 
Itâs the devilâs turn 
Satan pulls the strings 
Look what tomorrow brings

When all the angels have been slain 
And nothingâs left worth to retain 
The fragile bridge over troubled water of sins collides to the abyss

Watch the churches burn 
Itâs the devilâs turn 
Satan pulls the strings 
Look what tomorrow brings
