Time has come to wake up 
I am bugged life is a slut 
My boss a nag what a mess 
Like a prisoner caught in a trap

ItÂ´s enough stand it no more 
Point of return escape from my own 
Screaming out burning out 
Now or never away from my throat

Quit my business to cross the boarder 
On my way back, back to the roots

Run, Fight 
Fight for your right 
Fuck the bastards 
Leave them behind 
Run, Fight 
Flash of delight 
My Salvation 
Run, Fight 
Fight for your right 
Fuck the bastards 
Leave them behind 
Run, Fight 
Flash of delight 
Recreation

On the road donÂ´t look back 
Feel immortal wind blowing my head 
A new start no more rules 
Escaped from nightmares and bloody fools

Quit my business to cross the boarder 
On my way back, back to the roots

Run, Fight 
Fight for your right 
Fuck the bastards 
Leave them behind 
Run, Fight 
Flash of delight 
My Salvation 
Run, Fight 
Fight for your right 
Fuck the bastards 
Leave them behind 
Run, Fight 
Flash of delight 
Recreation

On the road straight to hell 
Till the evil tolls the bell 
All for one, one for all 
Heavy Metal is the goal

Quit my business to cross the boarder 
On my way back, back to the roots

Run, Fight 
Fight for your right 
Fuck the bastards 
Leave them behind 
Run, Fight 
Flash of delight 
My Salvation 
Run, Fight 
Fight for your right 
Fuck the bastards 
Leave them behind 
Run, Fight 
Flash of delight 
Recreation
