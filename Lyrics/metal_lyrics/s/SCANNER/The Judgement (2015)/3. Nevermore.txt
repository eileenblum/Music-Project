And the Raven never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting 
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demonâs that is dreaming 
And my soul from out the shadow that lies floating on the floor 
Shall be lifted-

Distinctly I remember 
It was in a bleak December 
I was nodding, nearly napping 
When there was a rapping at my chamber door

Deep into the darkness peering 
I stood there, door opened, fearing 
Hesitating then no longer 
"Sir" said I "or Madame, truly I implore"

Darkness there and nothing more 
Just the wind cried "Lenore" 
Then there was a stately raven 
Stepping in nohow craven

Perched on a bust sat the raven of yore 
Croaking the word he said: "Nevermore" 
Asked for his name on the Plutonian shore 
Croaking again he quoth: "Nevermore"

And the bird sitting lonely 
On the placid bust spoke only 
That one word and nothing more 
While dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor

Darkness there and nothing more 
Just the wind cried "Lenore" 
Take the beak from out my heart 
Tear the shades of grief apart

Perched on a bust sat the raven of yore 
Croaking the word when he said: "Nevermore" 
Asked for his name on the Plutonian shore 
Croaking again he quoth: "Nevermore"

Darkness there and nothing more 
While my heart sighed "Lenore" 
Eagerly I wished the morrow 
To release me from my sorrow

Perched on a bust sat the raven of yore 
Croaking the word he said: "Nevermore" 
Asked for his name on the Plutonian shore 
Croaking again he quoth: "Nevermore"

The raven the rave the raven of yore 
Croaking the word he said: "Nevermore" 
Plutonian Plutonian Plutonian shore 
Croaking again he said: "Nevermore"
