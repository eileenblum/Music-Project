Hoist the sails
To ride the storm
Pirates of Tobago
We might die
Or we might fall
You never know
The destinyâs call

Face in the mirror
What can you tell?
A little to lose!
So what

Nothing to fear
But fear itself
Raising a tornado
Like a ghost
Out of the dark
We put out to sea
As fast as a shark

Face in the mirror
Whatâs your advice?
Nothing to lose!
Alright

Hooray
Ahead
Boarding our enemies
Hooray
Attack
Swords high to the sky

Hooray
Ahead
Another legendâs born today
Hooray
Attack
Legion of the bleeding sun

Sword to sword
The fight goes on
Blood will soak the mermaids
Our treasures
Lie ahead
Rotten and evil
We take every bet

Face in the mirror
What do you see?
Youâre so ugly!
So what

Hooray
Ahead
Boarding our enemies
Hooray
Attack
Swords high to the sky

Hooray
Ahead
Another legendâs born today
Hooray
Attack
Legion of the bleeding sun

[Choir of pirates:]
Face in the mirror
Whatâs your advice?
Nothing to lose!
Oh, nice

Hooray
Ahead
Boarding our enemies
Hooray
Attack
Swords high to the sky

Hooray
Ahead
Another legendâs born today
Hooray
Attack
Legion of the bleeding sun
