The story I want to tell you 
Begins where most searches end 
Messages I was receiving 
Written by Luciferâs hand

So when the sun was rising 
I followed the call 
No more chance to turn back time 
That day was my fall

I should have known this better 
The menace was real and so true 
I should have known this better 
The voice of the devil was you

Youâve taken all of my habits 
You changed what I used to be 
The monkey on my back 
Jumped fatefully on me

So I will do it finally 
What a man can do 
I will pull the trigger now 
To get rid of you

I should have known this better 
The menace was real and so true 
I should have known this better 
The voice of the devil was you
