Wind rushes in my face 
Searching a hidden place 
Destroy the enemy 
Command to set us free 
Crossing the endless oceans 
Sailing on the galley 
And I know 
Blood will spill today

Smell of death 
Sates the air 
Agony 
Here and there 
Fate inside a hero 
Willing men 
Give their lifes 
Leave behind 
Children and wives 
Fate inside a hero

Poseidon rock the ocean be with us 
Show your power as your sword is thrust 
Through the hearts of the enemy 
Among us please show us the glorious way

The Time has come right now 
To see the end will grow 
In our glory 
For we destroy the evil 
And as the battle ends 
I fell down to my knees 
And I Pray for our liberty

Smell of death 
Sates the air 
Agony 
Here and there 
Fate inside a hero

Poseidon rock the ocean be with us 
Show your power as your sword is thrust 
Through the hearts of the enemy 
Among us please show us the glorious way

The ocean's stained by blood 
The foe he gave his life 
Victory is our's today 
They paid the price 
Once tortured and mistreated 
We see the liberty rise

Smell of death 
Sates the air 
Agony 
Here and there 
Fate inside a hero 
Willing men 
Give their lifes 
Leave behind 
Children and wives 
Fate inside a hero

Poseidon rock the ocean be with us 
Show your power as your sword is thrust 
Through the hearts of the enemy 
Among us please show us the glorious way
