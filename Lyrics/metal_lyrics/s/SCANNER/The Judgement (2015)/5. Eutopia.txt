Iâve got a time machine 
Itâs oh so true 
It drives me anywhere 
And guides me through

Guides him through the time

Iâve sailed the seas across 
The galaxies 
And found a place to rest 
For all eternity

I have seen the dust of ages 
Kingdoms rise and fall 
The legend of the son of god 
Can claim Iâve met them all 
Eutopia 
End of the brave berserker 
Eutopia 
The Promised Land to set us free

Donât lag to take your seat 
So you and I 
Escaping through the time 
Can reach the place of mine

Passing gloom and glamour 
Weâll meet the cursed ones too 
In permanent possession 
They damn their vital doom 
Eutopia 
End of the brave berserker 
Eutopia 
The Promised Land to set us free

So if you take that pill 
Itâs coming true 
The raise of consciousness 
Will lead you too

You will see your granny growing 
Your grandsons bitter fate 
The genesis and source of life 
The end of all that hate 
Eutopia 
End of the brave berserker 
Eutopia 
The Promised Land to set us free
