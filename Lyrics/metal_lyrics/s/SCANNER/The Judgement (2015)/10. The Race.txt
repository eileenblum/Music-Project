See the rushing crowd of people 
Hurries to a place to go 
Anxious about wasting too much time

Seems they hasten to a shelter 
From a raging wind and storm 
In the thick of things I can find mine

Have a look what happened to us all 
The only choice you have is stand or fall

Ere my last day yet to come 
I swear this oath right to the sun 
As writ large in my face 
Iâm here on earth to win the race

Wondering who will pay the bill 
For the common entry fee 
For the play-offs of the madden crowd

Finally itâs how itâs always told 
Most precious things in life are bearing gold

Ere my last day yet to come 
I swear this oath right to my son 
As writ large in his face 
Heâs here on earth to win the race

Pressure to get higher grades 
Each a victim of his fate 
Always on the run weâre having fun

Shooting rampage here and there 
Society of dump-and- burn 
Brave new world is far from charity

Keeping up the pace until youâre old 
Wise words have no chance of being told

Ere my last day yet to come 
I swear this oath right to the sun 
As writ large in my face 
Iâm here on earth to win the race 
Before my last day yet to come 
I swear this oath right to my son 
As writ large in his face 
Heâs here on earth to win the race
