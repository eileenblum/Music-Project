Another piece of meat 
Rotting in the heat 
Slaughter, endless pain 
Lakes of bloody rain

Ruandaâs everywhere 
People do not care 
Warlords wearing suits 
Will never die in boots

New York, Tokyo or Berlin 
Satanâs friend is already in 
As lord of profit heâs the king 
And blood defiles his signet- ring

WARLORD 
Look me in the eyes 
Designated ruler of seductive lies 
WARLORD 
Devil in disguise 
Capacities extended for the genocide

With tons of hidden cash 
Success is never bashed 
Invited to the feast 
Wall Street feeds the beast

New York, Tokyo or Berlin 
Satanâs friendâs already in 
The lord of profit is the king 
And blood defiles his signet- ring

WARLORD 
Look me in the eyes 
Designated ruler of seductive lies 
WARLORD 
Devil in disguise 
Capacities extended for the genocide
