Dew-drops on the jungleâs fern 
Sunbeams touch the leaves 
Dirty blackened faces stare mean

Battalion of the underdogs 
Determined now to win 
I hope the lord will have an eye on me

At 8:15 (eight one five) the enemy 
Was caught in our trap 
Resisted just to keep the faith 
No chance to get way back

Loss of horizons 
The enemy was killed 
On just an ordinary day

He was the one and only 
Who reaped the fruits of glory 
Dangerous, he felt divine 
And when I met him later 
Though all the years passed by 
Dangerous and he still was fine

The legionary 
The legionary 
The legionary 
The legionary

Told him: Dear, itâs not my cup 
I had to leave the pack 
My conscienceâs hurting just too much 
So donât expect me back

Loss of horizons 
My fate was sealed 
On just another ordinary day

He was the one and only 
Who reaped the fruits of glory 
Dangerous, he felt divine 
And when I met him later 
Though all the years passed by 
Dangerous and he still was fine

Loss of horizons 
His fate was sealed 
On just another ordinary day

He was the one and only 
Who reaped the fruits of glory 
Dangerous, he felt divine 
And when I met him later 
Though all the years passed by 
Dangerous and he still was fine

He took a thousandâs breath 
Defied the shades of death 
Dangerous, he felt divine 
And when I met him last 
He had the coma cast 
Motionless, he crossed the line

The legionary
