Decadence in a dream of confusion.
If we dare, we can step into the sign.
I wanna see the lights of thousand lies.
I wanna suffocate and breed the night.

Bring me down on my knees. I have
waited for this. I wanna be yours to
please. Cause you are my master, the
reason I still breath. Breathe.

I leave my flesh in the hands of my
maker. I feel the scent of a kingdom yet
to come. When all is gone, we can't go
back to life. When all is done, there's
nothing to deny.
