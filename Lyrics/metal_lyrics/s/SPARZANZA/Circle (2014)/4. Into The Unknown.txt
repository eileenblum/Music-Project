My world has been left behind. I see the
shadows passing by. No longer will I be
a part of this. My exit, my demise.

It feels like it's my time to go. Feels
like I'm walking on burning coal. My
memories flashing right before my eyes.
My demons, in disguise.

Everything seems so unreal.
Everything seems to be broken.
All that I know will disappear.
Into the unknown.

I'm lost, I slowly drift away.
The sun is gone now, the skies are grey.
i meet the darkness, without fear. I try
to stay here, to stay alive.
