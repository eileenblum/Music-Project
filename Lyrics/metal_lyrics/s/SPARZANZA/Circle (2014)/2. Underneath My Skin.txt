Memories reflect like a mirror. Pictures,
forever stained in my mind. Shadows
walk behind me every step I take. Faces
stare upon me every night and day.

It cannot be seen, it can't be heard. My
scars they have healed but I still hurt.
I will always carry this burden within.
Forever underneath my skin.

Searching for some kind of reason.
Waiting for days that just won't come.
Everything I ever had turned into dust.
Everyone I used to know damaged my
trust.

All the voices inside my head. All the
sickness that hides in me. Makes me long
for the final rest. This is not who I
wanna be. No this is not me.
