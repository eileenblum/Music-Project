This is where we used to play
No sorrow in our hearts
The sound from yesterday
Beating strong like a gong

It feels like another life
Long before I was hurt by lies
Then it all went away
To be gone out of sight

Away it's all been swept away
Away the darkness seize the day
This pain like poison in my veins
Please forgive me as I go away

I go through it all in my head
What you said what could've been
I think about all the tears we shared
When our innocence came to an end

Sometimes I hurt myself to feel alive
But I'm still numb and empty inside
This darkness never ends
I'm dead but still breathing

Away it's all been swept away
Away the darkness seize the day
This pain like poison in my veins
Please forgive me as I go away

I wish nothing would have changed since then
I wish everything could stay like then
But I know there is no turning back
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

Away it's all been swept away
Away the darkness seize the day
This pain like poison in my veins
Please forgive me as I go away
Please forgive me as I go away
