I feel the cold blood inside. What's in
my veins cuts like knives. My soul of
black dies inside. Got no air to breathe.
No pain to feel.

When the silence sounds so loud. And
darkness shines with blinding light. In the
crowds I feel alone. No turning back for
my soul is black.

I hate the truth I have found. I try to
hide from my own mind. The void
within is calling me. Now I'm left
behind. These eyes are blind.
