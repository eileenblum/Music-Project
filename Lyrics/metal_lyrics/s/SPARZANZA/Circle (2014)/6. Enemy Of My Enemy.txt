To all who instigated. For you I'm full
of hatred. I love the panic in your eyes.
Everything you taught me was a lie. The
world is damned, now everything must
die.

I fear nothing, I'm born of hate. And
you're all about to see supremacy.
When I push back the strain, I feel no
pain, feel no empathy. The enemy of my
enemy is my enemy.

My wrath, resurrected. My vengeance is
perfected. You can't believe what's in my
mind. Squeal like a pig, no one hears your
cries. You are the scum, all that I despise.

I fear nothing, I'm born of hate. And
you're all about to see my supremacy.
And when nothing remains, I end this
game with no sympathy. The enemy of
my enemy is my enemy.
