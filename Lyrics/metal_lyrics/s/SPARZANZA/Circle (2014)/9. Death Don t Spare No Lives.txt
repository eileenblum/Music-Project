I am here to still my thirst for blood and
see you suffer. You will pay for all your
fucking lies. You'll have to die. Constant
burning, no relief. Grinding pain, tearing
your soul down. I will have to seal your
fate. Blessed with evil, fueled by hate.

I will shut your eyes. Untouchable.
Untouchable. Death don't spear no lives.
Untouchable. Untouchable.

Never again will I feel alive. Those days
are over. Never again will I see the
light. I'm scarred forever. Path is chosen.
Eye for an eye. Can't back down, your
destiny is mine. Everything is all too late.
Blessed with evil, fueled by hate.

I will get inside your mind.
