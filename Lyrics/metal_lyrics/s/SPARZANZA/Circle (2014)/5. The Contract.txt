I see no meaning of life, I'm just a
lesser version of myself. So lost without
a cause, I'm always drawn to where the
darkness dwells.

I'm falling down, I am far beyond
redemption. Hell's reaching out with an
offer of temptation.

I give up my soul. A contract in blood.
I'm out of control. Awaiting the flood.
A contract in blood.

Let there be no more light when all hope
is gone I'll seal your fate. Deep in the
dead of the night we will step into the
burning gates.

You're falling down. You are far beyond
redemption. Hell's reaching out. Can't
escape from your damnation.
