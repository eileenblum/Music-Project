I fell into the bottomless pit. Only
surrounded by pitch black night. I couldn't
breathe, I couldn't stand straight. Then
hell was draped in blinding light.

I have waited for this nightmare. Now
I'm here, where it begins. Embracing my
sins. I was lost within obsession. Without
a chance to win. Do what thou wilt.

Behind the gate, lost forever more.
Never to see another break of day.
Blessed are the sick. A poison to the
soul. Never to leave, always to stay.
Do what thou wilt.
