It is a waste of time
Women on my mind
Crossing the bridge alone
I'm the desert son
I was tied and bound
Lost what I found
Left in the desert now
On rattlesnake ground

I WAS BORN TO RUN
UNDER THE SUN
I'M THE DESERT HIGHWAY SON
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE

Behind the cactus shade
I can be myself
Driving until I'm gone
I'm the desert son
