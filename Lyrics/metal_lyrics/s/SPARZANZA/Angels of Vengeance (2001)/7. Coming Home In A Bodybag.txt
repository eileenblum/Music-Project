As the morning mist begins to rise
I see the sunrise in the skies
And I'm asking myself why
Why do people have to die
The only one that come this far
In this place, the eve of war
I don't know what I'm going to do
I'm not sure I'll pull this through

I AM THE LAST IN LINE
I AM LOST IN TIME
I AM THE LAST IN LINE
I AM LOST IN TIME

As the darkness falls across the land
My memories turning into sand
I am standing for a reason
Until the dawning of a season
Many names are long forgotten
A touch of death, a smell of rotten
All of me is just tag
Coming home in a bodybag
