God, I feel ashamed
So I'm standing with my face against the wall again
Nothing's quite the same
But I'm aching for the day to come and say my name
Hear the words I say
And you'll listen to the prayer of a wicked man
Step aside my friend
And I will show you everything you got to know

ON THIS DUSTY ROAD I'VE TRAVELLED
ON THIS SOLID GROUND I'VE DIED
YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET YOUR MAKER
HE'S THE ONE FROM THE OTHER SIDE

I can help you know
'Cause I'm standing in the corner of your darkened mind
I can show you how
Hear me saying it's for me to know and you to find
Got to give it back
Try to see the things you've seen and never see again
Blinded by the truth
But he will show you everything you got to know
