Feel me come inside your brain
Come on let me feel the pain
Try to squeeze it hard from the beginning
Morning of erasing heads
Coming closer to your beds
It'll be the first time you'll see it

I SAID HEY, STAY AWAY
I WILL TRY TO TAKE MY PAIN AND BLOW AWAY
WANT TO HELP ME TO SURVIVE THIS
GOD I KNOW, HOW I DIED INSIDE
I CAN NO LONGER STAY INSIDE YOUR MIND
WANT TO HELP ME TO SURVIVE THIS

Nothing really touches me
Nothing happens, can't you see
It'll be the first time I see it
So goddamn beautiful
Got a heartache full of lust
Try to squeeze it hard from the beginning
