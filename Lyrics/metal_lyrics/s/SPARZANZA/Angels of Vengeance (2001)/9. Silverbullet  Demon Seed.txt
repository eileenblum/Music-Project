As I'm left alone again
With my head up high
I will never be the same
I will never die
If you ever find yourself
In my situation
With my constant lack of health
And my aggressions
As I'm watching down on you
With eyes of fire
Like a bullet coming through
Aim even higher
When I'm breaking up the face
As I'm smiling
They won't even find a trace
Are you hiding

I'M LEFT ALONE AGAIN
I'M BRINGING OUT THE DEAD
I'M LIKE A SILVERBULLET
I'M COMING THROUGH YOUR HEAD

As I'm left alone again
With my head up high
I will never be the same
I will die
When I'm breaking up the face
As I'm smiling
They won't even find a trace
Are you hiding
