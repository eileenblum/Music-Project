You've made your move
Under the sunlight
Which way to turn
And so you stumble
I am the one
I am the chosen
And here I am
There's no surrender
Fed up with lies
Feel my passion
Behind the wheel
Keep your face on
I am the son
Son of the sun
That's who I am
I'm no pretender

YOU'RE WELCOME TO MY KINGDOM
FEEL SO ALIVE
THIS IS THE CROSSROAD KINGDOM
WHEN YOU ARRIVE

Shining like gold
It's almost magic
I am your wound
Life is so tragic
I am the one
I am the chosen
You've bled for years
I'm getting closer
Lights fade away
Under the moonlight
I know your way
Praying for freedom
I am the son
Son of the sun
Increase your speed
Fight for survival
