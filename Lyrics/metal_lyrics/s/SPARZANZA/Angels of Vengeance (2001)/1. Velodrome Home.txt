I cannot fail now
I was born inside the sun
I've got a big machine that keeps rolling in my mind
I'm getting high here baby, and I think you'll go there too
Feeling so goddamn heavy, I'm riding my own road

I GOT TO I GOT TO GO
SON OF THE VELODROME HOME

I cannot breakdown
I believe I'm dealing death
Liquid pleasure, your wish will come alive
I'm getting high here baby, and I think you'll go there too
Feeling so goddamn heavy, I'm riding my own road
