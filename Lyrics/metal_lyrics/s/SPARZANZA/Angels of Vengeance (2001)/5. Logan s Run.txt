I've been trying for so long
To find my way back again
I don't know where I'm from
I don't know where to begin

I'VE LOST MY WAY
I'VE LOST MYSELF
I KNOW I COULD, BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
I'VE LOST MY SAY
I'VE LOST MY THINKING
I KNOW I SHOULD

I've been running for so long
To find my way back again
Now I know I have to be strong
So I can be just the same
