When she caught his eyes, it was a matter of time
Could never run away
He was staring at her, like he'd done before
She would never stay
Like a spreading disease, he was trying to please
The voices in his head
And he knows where she goes, and he knows that she knows
What he wants to say

SHE'S BREATHING NO MORE
AND NOW SHE'S GONE
HE'S LAUGHING SHE CRIED
HE FEELS ALIVE

She was just a brick, in his fucked up game
Amanda was her name
Beyond space and time, in a twisted mind
Nothing seems to real
With grey clouded skies, deep in his eyes
He could never feel
And he knows where she goes, and he knows that she knows
What he wants to say
