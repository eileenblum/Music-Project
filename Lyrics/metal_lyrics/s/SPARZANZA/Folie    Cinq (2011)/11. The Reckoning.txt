The Reckoning is to begin. I feel alive, gonna pay back for your lies. Don't go outside, don't try to hide. I'm gonna get you either way, you will see. No disregard, I'll get you hard. No time to wait, you have triggered hate in me. The time is right, the time is now. You're sickening, this is the reckoning.

I have heard it all before. Now you're faced against the wall. 'Cause I'm finished with your lies. I am gonna cast the stones. Gonna do it all alone. A righteous way to die.

The Deadening is choking me. I'm searching for the reason of my killing-spree. Don't hesitate to be afraid. I'll bring you the darkest day in my crusade. The new elite is incomplete. You're crucified, this burning hate will sacrifice. The heat is on, the heat is here. Your sickening, this is the reckoning.
