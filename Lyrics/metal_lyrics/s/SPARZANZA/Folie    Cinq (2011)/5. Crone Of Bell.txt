Red river dreams turned out to be another journey wasted. A place of death emerging from the blood that she tasted. Watch out, when the shadows sings she will take you one by one. Get out of here, before everybody's dead and gone.

From the shadows she will come. Into darkness you'll succumb. While her voice is getting stronger. She has caused you all the pain. She has emptied all your veins. Now you're going straight to hell. She's the crone, the crone of Bell.

Black hound, rabbit head - was the beginning of a bloody curse. Sound of beating on the walls, and things went from worse to worse. Knock, knock, it is getting near so just take us away from here. In the name of the lord, who are you, and what do you want?
