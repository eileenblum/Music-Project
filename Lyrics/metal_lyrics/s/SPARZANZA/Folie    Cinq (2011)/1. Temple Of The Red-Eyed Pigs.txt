When the end is near, the dead shall walk the earth. But the time is here, when death replaces birth. Your blood is mine. There's nothing you can do. You walk the line. 'Cause you know they're out for you.

I am the last man standing. We all die when he's commanding. And we die so hard. 'Cause we try so hard all in vain. I am the last man bleeding. Blood to the gods that we're feeding. In the temple of... Temple of the red-eyed pigs.

When the ground is crossed by the shadow of a man. And the day is here, start running if you can. Your blood is mine. As you look them in the eyes. You walk the line. And you know you're bound to die.

I am the last man standing. We all die when he's commanding. And we die so hard. 'Cause we try so hard all in vain. I am the last man bleeding. Blood to the gods that we're feeding. In the temple of... Temple of the red-eyed pigs.

God knows you walk alone. Carrying every stone. God knows how hard it is, And every bitter lie. Have crushed you and your life. And now you're bound to die.
