Through weary eyes. I see your lies. And truth hits hard. In my disguise. There is no life, pain is all. And when you speak I walk away. I turn the brightest day to grey.

I got misery on my side. I got no place left to hide. Once again. Hell... Hell is mine. If you wanna take the devil's hand. If you really wanna understand. You have to know. Hell... Hell is mine.

Full of despair. A notion of death, my final breath. I grasp for air. A sky turning red, awakes the dead. And when it ends I fade away. Born in the dawn of decay.

I got misery on my side. I got no place left to hide. Once again. Hell... Hell is mine. If you want it you will have to bleed. If you want it you will have to feel. The pain inside. Hell... Hell is mine.
