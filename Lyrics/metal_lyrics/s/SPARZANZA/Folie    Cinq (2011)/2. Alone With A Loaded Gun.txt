I don't quite understand my actions. I don't quite understand what's wrong. Stench of sweat and tears. It's time to face my fears. The taste of metal in my mouth. I feel abused. It's hard to face the truth. A day anew.

Can someone save my soul. Can someone save me now. I'm alone with a loaded gun, please stop me.

I just wish that I was that headstrong. And I wish I could stay with you. I'm cold, my hands are shaking. I'm down, my body's aching. The taste of metal in my mouth. I feel abused. It's hard to face the truth. A day anew.

Can someone save my soul. Can someone save me now. I'm alone with a loaded gun, please stop me.

I've suffered long enough, and when all hope is gone. I'm alone with a loaded gun, please stop me.
