Close your eyes and you will seem the perverted side of me. Step inside to my world of misery. You got to leave your pity life behind. I will be your master and you'll find. That there's no way out of here. There's no way to disappear.

I know you will believe. I know you'll be relieved. So come here, don't get scared. Follow me. With darkness in our hands. The night comes to an end. We'll set the pigs free. So follow me.

You know it's understood. Doing well by doing good. It is your turn to write the word, you know you should. I'm not your devil and I'm not your god. But I'm deep inside your weakened heart. There is nothing left to learn. Just to pray that the world will burn.

I know you will believe. I know you'll be relieved. So come here, don't get scared. Follow me. With darkness in our hands. The night comes to an end. We'll set the pigs free. So follow me.

"Look down at me and you will see a fool. Look up at me and you will see a god. Look straight at me and you will see yourself."
