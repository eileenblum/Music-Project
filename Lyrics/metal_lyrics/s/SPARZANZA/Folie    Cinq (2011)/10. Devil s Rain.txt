Turn the page. And bind your rage. You've made your own cell. It's black as the night, black as the sky, black inside. Close your eyes. Now roll the dice. And play the game of treason. It'll bite at your back, bite at your back. One, two.. Three, four... Five, six... six, six...

This time you have gone too far. Who the hell do you think you are. When it turns to a life in vain, by the Devil's rain. You're not in heaven nor in hell. 'Cause you got no soul to sell. You are cleansed to a life in pain, by the Devil's rain.

End draws near. When hell is here. Try to stand the fire. It is burning your skin, burning your skin, burn your skin. All in vain. So taste the rain. It is a bitter feeling. When it keeps falling down, keeps falling down. One, two... Three, four... Five, six... six... six...

This time you have gone too far. Who the hell do you think you are. When it turns to a life in vain, by the Devil's rain. You're not in heaven nor in hell. 'Cause you got no soul to sell. You are cleansed to a life in pain, by the Devil's rain.

For blood to shed, for blood to come. I cannot pay for what I've done. For blood to shed, for blood to come. Our darkest days have just begun.
