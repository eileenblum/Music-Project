I'll bring your life. Take the pain, make you whole again. Like a knife. Slitting through your open veins. You know you're one with the prince of lies. When you're tasting the demon's desires.

I'll make you scream. Intense it burns inside of you. Now you're in heat... the Phoenix down. I'll make you scream. Because my fire makes you weak. The Devil's crown... Phoenix down.

Feed your lies. Make the truth your reality. How he tries. To fill your soul with his agony. You know you'll pray on your bleeding knees. To the one who holds the key.

I'll make you scream. Intense it burns inside of you. Now you're in heat... the Phoenix down. I'll make you scream. Because my fire makes you weak. The Devil's crown... Phoenix down.
