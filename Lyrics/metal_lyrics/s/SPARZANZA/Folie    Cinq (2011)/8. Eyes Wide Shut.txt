So, you're dead with me. Names carved in stone. Been here for so long, our minds are getting old. The end is closing in. The end is closing in.

Death is the scent I'm feeling. Blood is the drug that gets me high. I've opened the door to your soul, like a cut. With my eyes wide shut.

Now, we walk this trail, to where we will belong. Weak, frail and so pale, still we're feeling strong. The end is closing in.
