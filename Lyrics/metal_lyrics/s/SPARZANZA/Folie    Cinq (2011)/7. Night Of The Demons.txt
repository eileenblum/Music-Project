I failed to understand, how to get away from hell. Stuck in the underground, where only darkness dwells. At the point of no return, at the gates where all is said. I thought I saw angel, dancing with the dead.

Night of the demons. You know that they will hunt you down. Night of the demons. Preaching black sermons. You know they're closing in on you. In the night of the demons.

I took what Satan gave, I knew the price to pay. And now I'm damned to hell and hell will be my grave. For eternity, wrath will tangle me. Pain is everywhere, and death won't set me free.

Night of the demons. You know that they will hunt you down. Night of the demons. Preaching black sermons. You know they're closing in on you. In the night of the demons.
