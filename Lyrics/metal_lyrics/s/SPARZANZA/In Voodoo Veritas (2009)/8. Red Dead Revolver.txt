Don't try to walk through the fire
Don't try to understand the liar

You know I am a true believer
I believe in things you've never seen
You know I am a stone cold killer
Unable to feel what you feel

Say goodbye or get on my side
Don't even try to give in
'Cause it's over now
I watch you fade, watch you fade away
One step back and you're mine
On the other side

No, you cannot lead you will follow
No, your pride you will have to swallow

You know you are a true deceiver
You know you are made of lies
You know you are a stone cold killer
Unable to hear their cries

Say goodbye or get on my side
Don't even try to give in
'Cause it's over now
I watch you fade, watch you fade away
One step back and you're mine
On the other side
