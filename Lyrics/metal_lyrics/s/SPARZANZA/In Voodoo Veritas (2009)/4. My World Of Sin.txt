You can't see right through my eyes
I can't believe you used my own disguise
You've lost, wanna play again?
It is a waste of time, don't try it twice
Now throw the dice

Come with me and learn what's real
I know it's not from me you steal
I don't mind if you go astray
Just don't look back, 'cause we will never change
It is all the same

There you are stripped and naked
Down on your knees (beg me, please)
Your god knows that you are forsaken
Cause I let you in my world of sin

What's at stake? I know you'll loose
A bitter way for you to find the truth
Wanna know what's behind the blinds
I see your life fade in the grains of sand
And the dead mans hand

There you are stripped and naked
Down on your knees (beg me, please)
Your god knows that you are forsaken
Cause I let you in my world of sin
