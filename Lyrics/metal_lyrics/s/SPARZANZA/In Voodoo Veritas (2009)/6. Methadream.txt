Can't come about
Cause I'm down and out
My arms and legs to numb to stand up

I've had my doubts
And I've heard the sounds
Of something coming closer, coming down

I have swallowed every pill
But the pain is yet to kill
My mind is getting numb so numb
Methadream
I have swallowed every lie
I convinced myself that I
I saw the truth but I saw a dream
Methadream

Left in a haze
Been gone for days, and days
I just can't seem to find the right ways

I have swallowed every pill
But the pain is yet to kill
My mind is getting numb so numb
Methadream
I have swallowed every lie
I convinced myself that I
I saw the truth but I saw a dream
Methadream

Blood taste in my mouth
Bad dreams going round and round
