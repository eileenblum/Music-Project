I don't need anything
'Cause everything I've got
Don't mean a thing
I don't need anyone
'Cause everyone I know, compares to none

Rise, rise
All the places I have been
Rise, rise
Earned in sweat and paid in sin

I've been searching for the truth
And I know I have to choose
Been away for far too long
Now I'm gone

I have been rising again
But everything I see I can't attain
I have been everywhere
And everywhere I go, to much to bare

Rise, rise
All the bridges I have crossed
Rise, rise
Fucked for life and always lost

I've been searching for the truth
And I know I have to choose
Been away for far too long
Now I'm gone
