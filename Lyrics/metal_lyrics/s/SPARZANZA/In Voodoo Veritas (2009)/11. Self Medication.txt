I am craving for another
You're my one and only mother
You're exploding in my veins
Taking all my pain away

All night long my world is burning
In the pages I keep turning
I can't find no other way
Than stay in pain and fight in vain

It's all in the back of my head
It's all in your head

When you come inside
It's time to stop the lies
Youâre my only god
Self medication
When it takes me down
I'm gonna walk that line
'Til my body stops
Self medication

Seeking for another thrill
Still I have this time to kill
Memories coming back to me
Still I have this urge to feed

I am craving for another
You're my one and only mother
You're exploding in my veins
Taking all my pain away

It's all in the back of my head
It's all in your head

When you come inside
It's time to stop the lies
You're my only god
Self medication
When it takes me down
I'm gonna walk that line
'Til my body stops
Self medication
