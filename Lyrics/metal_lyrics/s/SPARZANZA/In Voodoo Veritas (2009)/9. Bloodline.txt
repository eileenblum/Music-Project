I'm feeling weak
I know what you think
What you think of me
Say what you feel
No kin will ever come from me

Can't find nothing to leave behind
Don't try to change my mind
Last hours of my time
I'll soon be gone

And I donât wanna last forever
I'm letting go
'Cause everything ends
And I sure can
End this with my life
I'll die with my bloodline

I shed no tears
I am what I am and I face my fears
Why canât you see?
No kin will ever come from me

Don't feed me with your filthy lies
Can't change me even if you try
Last hours of my time
I'll soon be gone

And I don't wanna last forever
I'm letting go
Cause everything ends
And I sure can
End this with my life
I'll die with my bloodline

Everything ends
And I'll end this with my life
Cause everything ends
And I'll die with my, with my bloodline
