Struck down by the power to feed
From the backbone to my spine
Caught up like a bird in a cage
By the contract I have signed

It flows through my veins
It will end my days

Oh god I hate this life
And the one it turned me into
And I hate those times
Just waiting for my blood to dry
Save my life
Cause I've been lost between these walls
I've been tied down
By the poison

Fucked up by the circle of life
I have come to my destination
Worn out by the sands of time
Like the headstones in a line

It flows through my blood
I have understood

Oh god I hate this life
And the one it turned me into
And I hate those times
Just waiting for my blood to dry
Save my life
Cause I've been lost between these walls
I've been tied down
By the poison

It's today or tomorrow
And I feel so fucking hollow
And I wish that I was born again
