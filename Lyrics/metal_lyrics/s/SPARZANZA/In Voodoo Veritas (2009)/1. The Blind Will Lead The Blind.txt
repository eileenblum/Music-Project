Second to none
One by one they're gonna fall from the skies
Wing clipped by their holy god
To be welcomed by the prince of lies

Standing in line
One more time I'm gonna give you all that's mine
Pushing the pace, get into the maze
Gonna play this game for one last time

Don't fail me now
I try to show the way but I don't know how
Don't waste my time
'Cause the blind will lead the blind

Letting the pain get to me
It's getting much too dark to see
Pitch black and no way back
Throwing the key it's such a great relief

Don't fail me now
I try to show the way but I don't know how
Don't waste my time
'Cause the blind will lead the blind
