Hey man don't listen to what others say
'Cause if you don't youâll find a better way
Heaven might be good
But it's in hell you will end you days

Hey man don't go there, you don't wanna know
Don't go inside or you'll be all alone
And if you got to run
You better run as fast as you can

Gather around me
Gather around me
I'm preaching to the masses
I know about the truth
And I know that the truth is revealed
For the very first time

If nothing I can say can end your wrath
You'll find you're walking on the left hand path
And if you find it easy
You will know you have found your way

You want to know that what I say is true
Does number 6 mean everything to you?
God might be nice
But the Devil was the one you knew

Gather around me
Gather around me
I'm preaching to the masses
I know about the truth
And I know that the truth is revealed
For the very first time
