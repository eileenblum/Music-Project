I see your demise
Right there before my eyes
Ain't gonna compromise
I'm gonna stand my ground

I'm second to none
I'm on my own
Keep fighting this war alone
Suicide
Black Gemini

You paid all your debts
You paid with death
And carved it into stone
Black Gemini

Revealed your master plan
Not only cash in hand
The one with aces high
I'm taking back what's mine
