Did you see my hatred rise?
Did you feel my rage inside?
I try to be calm
I'm pushing it down, pushing it down
But I get so fuckingÂ furious

Out of my mind
You will feel it 
You will taste it 
Come on

I WILL BE THE ONE THAT HUNTS YOU
I WILL BE THE ONE THAT ENDS YOUR LIFE
YOU BETTER KEEP ON RUNNING
YOU ARE THE PREY, YOU'RE GOING DOWN

What goes around, comes around
I've shut my eyes, but not this time
I'm ready to fight, I'm crushing your pride
I'm bringing you down, 'cause I feel so fuckingÂ furious

Out of my mind
You will feel it, 
You will taste it
Come on

I WILL BE THE ONE THAT HUNTS YOU
I WILL BE THE ONE THAT ENDS YOUR LIFE
YOU BETTER KEEP ON RUNNING
YOU ARE THE PREY, YOU'RE GOING DOWN
