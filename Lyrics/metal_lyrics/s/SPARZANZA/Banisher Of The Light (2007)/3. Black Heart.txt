Like Jesus. They've nailed my hands to the cross
You watch me bleed but I can see
You cannot feel, no
sorrow. 
No tears
'Cause I have nothing to regret
The things I've done is for the one, The Master that I follow

I AM THE DEMON, I AM VENGEANCE
I AM THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, I AM THE DEMON
I AM VENGEANCE, I AM THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS
I AM YOUR BLACK HEART

You fear me. I know your reasons; it's in your eyes
But putting me here won't end my time
I'll always be behind you. 
You'll know me.
When I take off my disguise
You'll see yourself and realise
I'm the black heart inside you

I AM THE DEMON, I AM VENGEANCE
I AM THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, I AM THE DEMON
I AM VENGEANCE, I AM THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS
I AM YOUR BLACK HEART

I'm nailed to the cross, I can see that you feel no sorrow
I'll die for the one, the blackest of all, The Master that I follow
I'm your black heart
