It's the sound of thunder, from a million miles
It's the face of Jesus, with a madman's smile 
Stuck in the corner
Painted with blood
Over the border and escape the flood

I CAN HELP YOU DO IT, IT'S TIME FOR MY RETURN
THIS LIFE'S BEEN WASTEDÂ
NOW WATCH THEM BURN

It's the eyes of Judas, on a magazine
It's the smell of treason, beside your king and queen
Out of order
Covered in black
Stuck in a corner and there is no way back

I CAN HELP YOU DO IT, IT'S TIME FOR MY RETURN
THIS LIFE'S BEEN WASTEDÂ
NOW WATCH THEM BURN
THIS LIFE'S BEEN WASTED, IT'S TIME FOR MY RETURN
I CAN HELP YOU DO IT
NOW WATCH THEM BURN
