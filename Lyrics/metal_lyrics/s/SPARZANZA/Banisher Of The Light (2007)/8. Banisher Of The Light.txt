On a leash, do as I please
Under my command
You will learn, I will teach
Can you feel, what is unreal?
You're about to see, all the evil that's in me
And I can't control my anger
I just can't control my anger

AND I CAN'T CONTROL MY ANGER,
I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF WRONG OR RIGHT
AND I CAN'T CONTROL MY ANGER,
I'M A BANISHERÂ OF THE LIGHT

Not the first, you're not the last
Take a deep breath
Pray to god, I'll do it fast
What will come and what has been
You can never win
You're my remission of sin
And I can't control my anger
I just can't control my anger

AND I CAN'T CONTROL MY ANGER,
I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF WRONG OR RIGHT
AND I CAN'T CONTROL MY ANGER,
I'M A BANISHERÂ OF THE LIGHT
