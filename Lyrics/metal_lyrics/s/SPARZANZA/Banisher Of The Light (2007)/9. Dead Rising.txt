There is no chance in hell
When you've burned your bridges
Only time will tell, If we lost our chances
Where in time could I be?
When I smell the fi re, There are things I shouldn't see
And it's called desire

So bring it back, So bring it back, Now bring it back
So bring it back

DEAD AND RISING, COMING BACK FROM A SHALLOW GRAVE
COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD TO HAUNT YOU
DEAD AND RISING, AND THE TORTURE NEVER STOPS
COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD TO HAUNT YOU

There is nothing more to tell, Wiping the blood of your knife
Only time will tell, When you roll the dice
Where in hell have you been? Writing your name on a stone
Tell me what you have seen, When you're pushing the bones
Shovel by shovel, Blood and gore

DEAD AND RISING, COMING BACK FROM A SHALLOW GRAVE
COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD TO HAUNT YOU
DEAD AND RISING, AND THE TORTURE NEVER STOPS
COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD TO HAUNT YOU
