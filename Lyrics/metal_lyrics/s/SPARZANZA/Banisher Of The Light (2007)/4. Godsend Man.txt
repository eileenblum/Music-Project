Bloodstained hands accept my offer
Ravenous I search for more 
Leaving you on the fl oor to suffer
I'm pitch black evil to the core

Godsend man 
Born of fools Preaching to the mass
Obey my rules Godsend man 
Get on your knees
You will find salvation in me

ONE LAST PRAYER AND YOU HIT THE FLOOR
HE HAS BEEN THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING AND HOPING FOR...
BUT NOT ANYMORE GODSEND MAN ACTING LIKE A WHORE
GODSEND MAN ALL I WANT, WANT, WANT IS MORE

Join me on my road to ruin
Hard to wander, hard to walk
Nothing you can do will stop me
Don't beg me on your knees like a fucking dog

Godsend man 
Born of fools 
Preachin' to the mass
Obey my rules Godsend man 
Get on your knees
You will find salvation in me

ONE LAST PRAYER AND YOU HIT THE FLOOR
HE HAS BEEN THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING AND HOPING FOR...
BUT NOT ANYMORE GODSEND MAN ACTING LIKE A WHORE
GODSEND MAN ALL I WANT, WANT, WANT IS MORE
