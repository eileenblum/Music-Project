Give it, give it a go and tell it to my face again
How could, how could I have known that everything I've done is in vain?
And I've been touched by the hands of god, you will feel this
I am not sure you've understood, who my god is

YOU TOOK WHAT WAS MINE, BUT NOW IT IS TIME
BODY &amp; SOUL
I WANT YOU IN MY CONTROL

How can, how can it be so fucking hard to understand?
Now you, now you will see why they call me Satan's hand
And I've been touched by the hands of god, you will feel this
I am not sure you've understood, who my god is

YOU TOOK WHAT WAS MINE, BUT NOW IT IS TIME
BODY &amp; SOUL
I WANT YOU IN MY CONTROL
