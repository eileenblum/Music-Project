I feel my wings have been broken, I just can't feel the pain
I feel the words are unspoken, It just don't mean a thing
I don't care what you need, But I'm gonna make you bleed
Nourishment to your greed, I'm gonna make you fucking bleed

SOMEBODY SAVE ME, LEECHES ON MY SKIN
I'M DYING FROM WITHIN, BUT WHY CAN'T YOU HEAR ME
WHY CAN'T YOU SAVE ME, AND THE LEECHES ON MY SKIN

I feel my eyes have been blinded
I just can't see the pain
My eyes have never minded
It just don't seem the same
There's no way you'll succeed
'Cause I am gonna make you bleed
You will follow, I will lead
I'm gonna make you fucking bleed

SOMEBODY SAVE ME
LEECHES ON MY SKIN
I'M DYING FROM WITHIN
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU HEAR ME
WHY CAN'T YOU SAVE ME
AND THE LEECHES ON MY SKIN
