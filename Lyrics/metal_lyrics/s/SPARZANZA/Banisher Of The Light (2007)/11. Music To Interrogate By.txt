There is time for you to save
So why don't you dig your own grave
And if you want me to, I'll even come and help you
There is space for you to make
Like you did before, it's for you to take
And if you let me to, I'll even show you how to do

GOD DAMN HOW QUICKLY YOU FADED
I'VE NEVER BEEN INTERROGATED
DESPITE AND DESPAIR, GOD DAMN HOW QUICKLY YOU FADED
I'VE NEVER BEEN INTERROGATED
DESPITE AND DESPAIR

There is much for you to say
So why don't you ask my mind to stay
And if you're asking nicely, you will feel my anger rising
Where is the time for you to save?
When you're digging your own grave
And if you want me to, I'll put the dirt back over you
