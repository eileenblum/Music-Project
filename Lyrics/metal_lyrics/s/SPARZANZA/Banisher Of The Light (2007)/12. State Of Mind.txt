I feel like Iâm drifting away, I feel like Iâm losing control
Buried in a 6-6-6 feet deep grave
Donât know the reason at all, Drained of the water
The Water that stains my soul, Stained, getting harder
Harder to keep in control

Feel like an angel
But Iâm lost in a room full of hell
Anxiety is standing by my side
Watching and waiting

I FEEL IT SLIPPING AWAY
AWAY FROM THE LIFE THAT I KNOW
IâM LOST IN A 6-6-6 PACK STATE OF MIND
DONâT KNOW WHO YOU ARE, WHO AM I

Enslaved by the drinking
Liquids that cleans my mind
Sights in the distance
That I cannot leave behind

I FEEL IT SLIPPING AWAY
AWAY FROM THE LIFE THAT I KNOW
IâM LOST IN A 6-6-6 PACK STATE OF MIND
DONâT KNOW WHO YOU ARE, WHO AM I

Buried in a 6-6-6 feet deep grave
