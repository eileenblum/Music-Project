Looking over my shoulder
I keep staring at the sun
Even though I know my saviour will come from the barrel of a gun
I got to make you believe, I am the one that you need
I got to make you believe, You should've listened to me
Stop wishing, you see
You better listen to me

HE STARES AT ME, EVEN THOUGH HE CAN'T SEE
I CAN SEE HIS EYE, THE EYE OF A NEEDLE
SCREAMS MY NAME, FROM INSIDE MY VEINS, I CAN'T FEEL THE PAIN
I AMÂ CHASING THE DRAGON

Trying to find a wagon, That will take me out of here
Even though I know my life's been wasted by chasing the dragon
I got to make you believe, I am the one that you need
I got to make you believe, You should've listened to me
Stop wishing, you see
You better listen to me

HE STARES AT ME, EVEN THOUGH HE CAN'T SEE
I CAN SEE HIS EYE, THE EYE OF A NEEDLE
I AMÂ CHASING THE DRAGON
