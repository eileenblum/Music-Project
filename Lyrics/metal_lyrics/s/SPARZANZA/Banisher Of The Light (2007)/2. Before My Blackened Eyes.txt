I close my eyes but the demons won't fall asleep
They wander around, in the blink of an eye, I'm weakÂ again
And all this time 
Been fighting the dark inside my mind
And all my crimes 
Are haunting me now, they just won't die

AND BEFORE MY BLACKENED EYES
THERE'S A WORLD THAT I DESPISE
AND THE SUN WILL NEVER RISE
BEFORE MY BLACKENED EYES

I've closed the door to
the other side of me
The stones on my chest are making it hard to breatheÂ again
And all my life 
Been struggling so hard day and night
And how I've tried 
To find out how to get by

AND BEFORE MY BLACKENED EYES
THERE'S A WORLD THAT I DESPISE
AND THE SUN WILL NEVER
RISE
BEFORE MY BLACKENED EYES

AND THE DARK INSIDE MY MIND
IS DRAINING ME FROM LIFE
AND THE SUN WILL NEVER RISE
BEFORE MY BLACKENED EYES
