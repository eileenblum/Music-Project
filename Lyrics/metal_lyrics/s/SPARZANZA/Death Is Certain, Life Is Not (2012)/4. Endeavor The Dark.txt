I endeavor the dark
Forever in loneliness we drift apart
Where eternity lies
I'm closing my eyes under the fading star
I endeavor the dark

I look into the blackened sky
And the world is passing by
Flashing right before my eyes
As I slowly drift away

I'm already gone
I can't see the sun
There's nothing but dead space 'round me

I endeavor the dark
Forever in loneliness we drift apart
Where eternity lies
I'm closing my eyes under the fading star
I endeavor the dark

When I reach the other side
I've abandoned all the light
As I'm losing all control
I surrender to the night

For all of my time
I've wasted this life
There's nothing but pain inside me

I endeavor the dark
Forever in loneliness we drift apart
Where eternity lies
I'm closing my eyes under the fading star
I endeavor the dark
