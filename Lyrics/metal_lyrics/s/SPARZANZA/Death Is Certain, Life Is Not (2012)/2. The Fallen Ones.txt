I am one with the dark, the forsaken
I am one where pain has left a scar
Chose the left hand path, chose blackness
And forever I will wear the mark

Death is in my eyes,
A reflection of my mind
Death is in my veins, 
You see me with disdain
Drank the blood from the devil's fountain
Took a leap from the top of the mountain
When I enter the dark it will be to succumb
With the fallen ones

You cannot understand, I am hollow
I will never be the son of man
Nothing is what it seems an illusion
I am sworn to the dark, in its command

Death is in my eyes,
A reflection of my mind
Death is in my veins, 
You see me with disdain
Drank the blood from the devil's fountain
Took a leap from the top of the mountain
When I enter the dark it will be to succumb
With the fallen ones
