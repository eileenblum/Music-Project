Seeing red in the dead of the night
I am going to the end of the line
I'm done I have lost all control
So I'm ready to give up my soul

As I walk among the shadows blind
The storms inside my head arise

I found salvation with the devil by my side
I got a raging desire
A revelation of a darkness open wide
I walk into the fire

Met the dead and the dead is mine
I have written down these words in stone
In the shades where their bodies lie
Wish that I could leave but I don't

As I walk among the shadows blind
The storms inside my head arise

I found salvation with the devil by my side
I got a raging desire
A revelation of a darkness open wide
I walk into the fire

I am your demon

I found salvation with the devil by my side
I got a raging desire
A revelation of a darkness open wide
I walk into the fire
