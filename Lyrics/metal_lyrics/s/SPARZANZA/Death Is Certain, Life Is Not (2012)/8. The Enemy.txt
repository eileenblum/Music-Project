Just another death
Just another soul
All that's in despair
Is in my control
The blackest of the black
In the end of days
Now take another step
Where all darkness lays

I am the enemy, the ancient one
Creator of suffer and pain
I am the entity, the fallen son
Revoking the seals of my chain
I am eternity, the prince of lies
My legions of doom will converge
I am the evil, the master of sin
The flaming inferno begins

The flood is gettting close
This is judgement day
Bringer of disease to a world of hate
Prejudice and pain with the fall of man
Earth will turn to dust
Perished by my hands

I am the enemy, the ancient one
Creator of suffer and pain
I am the entity, the fallen son
Revoking the seals of my chain
I am eternity, the prince of lies
My legions of doom will converge
I am the evil, the master of sin
The flaming inferno begins
