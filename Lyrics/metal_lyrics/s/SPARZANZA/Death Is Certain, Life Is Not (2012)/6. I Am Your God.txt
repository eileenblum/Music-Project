We're the righteous, we cannot fall
We will get them and make 'em crawl
You know we are not like them, we'll die for our true cause
We're the sacred ones, we're the divine
Take their dirty pride, eye for an eye
It's time, it is time for you to finally abide

I am your God
Stand up for me
I am the one
You better blieve
This life, this fight
Is gonna end here tonight
I am your God
Stand up for me

Building hate cause this is a war
Raising hell like never before
We walk, we walk the path of righteousness once more
With our heads high we will prevail
We're salvation, we cannot fail
Tonight the weakened ones are left in our trail

I am your God
Stand up for me
I am the one
You better blieve
This life, this fight
Is gonna end here tonight
I am your God
Stand up for me
