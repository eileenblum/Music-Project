Temptation in the devil's night
Revealed to me, so shameless
I'm getting cold by the Midas touch
Resist is useless
I have lost it all
I'm the leper, I'm the decease
This will be such a sight

If I was a sinner, if I was a saint
Preaching of love but believeing in hate
Would you embrace me and give me your faith now
If I was a killer, if I was insane
Giving you pleasure then giving you pain
Could I invite you to join me in sin

Revelation of the demon's crest
Concealed to me in darkness
The Devil's backbone is by my hand
As I'm looking for the answers
Going in and out of consciousness
Desperately trying to gather strength
I am Legion

If I was a sinner, if I was a saint
Preaching of love but believeing in hate
Would you embrace me and give me your faith now
If I was a killer, if I was insane
Giving you pleasure then giving you pain
Could I invite you to join me in sin

Outcast of darkness, shackled, enslaved
You can't save me
I'm a god
I'm above
You're a lie
I have won
Baptized in fire, revealing the truth
You will hate me

I'm a god
I am all
You despise
You will fall
If I was convicted, if I was to blame
Nothing would matter, nothing would change
Forever in darkness, forever in pain

If I was a sinner, if I was a saint
Preaching of love but believeing in hate
Would you embrace me and give me your faith now
If I was a killer, if I was insane
Giving you pleasure then giving you pain
Could I invite you to join me in sin
