Feeling like a walking dead
A million thoughts inside my head
We're about to lose it all
Forever damned to lose our souls

Nothing left is sacred
We're dying with the falling sun
Because the end has just begun
All the lies, all the pain, overflowing with hate
Nothing else but death remains
When all is said and done
When the world is gone

You're smiling as you turn the knife
Its only darkness in your eyes
We will see the final day
Before the flood will come our way

Nothing left is sacred
We're dying with the falling sun
Because the end has just begun
All the lies, all the pain, overflowing with hate
Nothing else but death remains
When all is said and done
When the world is gone
