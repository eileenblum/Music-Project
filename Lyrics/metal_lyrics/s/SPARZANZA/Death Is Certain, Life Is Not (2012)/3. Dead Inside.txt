What is in death
What is in life
Will never turn these wrongs to right
I thought I knew
I saw wounds that bled
But I didn't know
What was in your head

Sickness
Hate
Blackness

Got a poison in your mind
It tears you down
You are dead inside
You are dead inside
In a second you will fall
And hit the ground
Hatred clouds your eyes
When you're dead inside

One taste of greed
So bitter sweet
A turn ito the path where good turns bad
You've built a wall
And no one gets near
A heart of stone
You are all alone

Sickness
Hate
Blackness

Got a poison in your mind
It tears you down
You are dead inside
You are dead inside
In a second you will fall
And hit the ground
Hatred clouds your eyes
When you're dead inside

In death, in life, in hate and strife
In soul, in mind, in truth and lies

Sickness
Hate
Blackness

Got a poison in your mind
It tears you down
You are dead inside
You are dead inside
In a second you will fall
And hit the ground
Hatred clouds your eyes
When you're dead inside

In death, in life, in hate and strife
In soul, in mind, in truth and lies
You are dead inside
