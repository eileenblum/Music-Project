All that we know
All we've been told is to deceive us
But in the end there's nothing left to say
I've turned my back, I walked away from retribution
I was wrong, didn't know
Now I can't pretend

We all shall watch the world go down in flames before our eyes
And as we watch it burn we're losing all we've got
For death is certain, life is not

Taught to believe
Taught to receive the spirit of the ghost
But nothing in this world could heal my soul
Left alone I suffered, soaked in sweat
I have hurt
I have healed
Now I can't pretend

We all shall watch the world go down in flames before our eyes
And as we watch it burn we're losing all we've got
For death is certain, life is not
