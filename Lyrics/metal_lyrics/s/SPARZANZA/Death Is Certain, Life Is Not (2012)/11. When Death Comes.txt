I feel so numb, bitter and weak
I can't pretend life is for me
Been trapped in the dark for so long now
It's time to leave, time to get out

When death comes, I will welcome it
Feeling tired and sick of this
When death comes it will leave with me

This world is too cold, I'm surrounded by lies
It's been so long since I felt alive
This strife is in vain, the suffer and pain
And slowly my soul is getting drained

When death comes, I will welcome it
Feeling tired and sick of this
When death comes it will leave with me

So sick of life
So black inside
Alone, I walk this earth alone
So sick of life
So down and out
It's time to step into the fire

When death comes, I will welcome it
Feeling tired and sick of this
When death comes it will leave with me
