Drive like a man in a Chevy '69
Steal the gas, 'cause you haven't got a dime
Drive it off a cliff and fall down
Go straight ahead and steal another one

BURN ALL THE BOOKS THAT SPEAK OF GOD
DESPISE ALL THE GIRLS THAT MAKE YOU HARD
HERE AT THE PLACE WHERE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
YOU'LL BURN WITH THE KINGS ON KEROSENE
BURN, SET YOUR SOUL ON FIRE
TELL THE TRUTH THAT YOU WHERE BORN A LIAR
DOWN AT THE PLACE WHERE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SIN LIKE THE KINGS ON KEROSENE

Get up on the back, and ride the demon
Go up high, while it carries you home
Down on the track, in the realm of evil
Get yourself a trophy, at Lucifer's dome
