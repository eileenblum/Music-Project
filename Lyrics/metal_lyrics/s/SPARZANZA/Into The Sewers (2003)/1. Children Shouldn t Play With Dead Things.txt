It's gonna take a little time to make it to the other side
But I've been there before
If you think you're gonna find a way to take it
And I won't go there no more
This shouldn't be the things you're looking for
As far as I'm concerned
This shouldn't be the path you're going
By the way I've learned, by the way I've learned

IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
YOU BETTER TELL THEM WHILE THEY'RE WAITING
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ANTICIPATING
AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE SPREADING OUT THEIR WINGS
CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS

If you believe the things I've seen on the other side
You wouldn't go there at all
Do you think you're gonna find a way to make it
And still survive their call
It shouldn't be the things you're aiming for
You better let them sleep
It shouldn't be the way you're chosing
The creatures of the deep, creatures of the deep
