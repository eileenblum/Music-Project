Welcome to this dream again
It is all in your head
It will let you feel insane
Hold you to your bed
Digging deeper in your in mind
Behind your eyes
Getting darker, feeling blind
Never see the light
Now... is the time

TO DIE AND TO GET DOWN AGAIN
I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE YOUR PAIN
ANYWAY
TO LIVE AND TO GET UP AGAIN
I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE YOUR PAIN
ANYWAY

Run your hands across your face
It is taking shape
Like it knows you're stuck in a maze
Feeding on your hate
Now... is time the time
