It is so easy to be blind
When there's something you want to find
But it can be so fucking hard
When she's coming from behind
She is below the burning sun
She's the one with the golden gun
The one beyond your darkest dreams
Isn't always who it seems
You better hide
Run for cover
Right from the source
They are the others

THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE, SO YOU BETTER GET OUT NOW
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO FIND, SO YOU BETTER FIND OUT HOW
TO GET OUT, TO GET OUT, TO GET DOWN, DOWN, DOWN
INTO THE SEWERS

It is so easy to fall down
It's getting harder to crawl out
But if she's taking your throne and wears your crown
You better know what it's all about
She is below the burning sun
She's the one with the golden gun
The one beyond your darkest dreams
Isn't always who it seems
You better hide
Run for cover
Right from the source
They are the others
