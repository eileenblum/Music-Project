Wondering what you are
Wondering what you do
Out there in the dark
God, I'm so afraid
I am terrified
'Cause you wear the mark
I can't see through that horrible face
Feel the heat from your merciless grace
Kindead, Kindead

BORN OF SIN
RAISED ON THE SUN
SUMMON YOUR KIN AND DIE FROM MY GUN

Turning out the light
Reaching for my gun
Longing for the sun
Dreaming 'bout a world
Where I'm all alone
Please, be gone
And I scream from the top of my lungs
When I dream 'bout the world where you're from
Kindead, Kindead
