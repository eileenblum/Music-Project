Give me your hand and I will take you home
Give me the sun and I will make it explode
Hand me a jacket and I'll make it look cool
Make me a star so that I can fall
Lend me some money, I will win some more
Shed me a tear, later on when I'm broke
Lend me your body, c'mon spend the night
Make me a man so that I can die

NOW, LISTEN TO THE SILENCE SCREAMING
WHAT YOU HEAR IS WHAT I'M CRAVING
NOTHING! FOR A PRICE I HAVE TO PAY
AND AS YOU WATCH THIS BLIND MAN STARING
HEAR THIS MUTE SAY WHAT HE NEEDS
KNOW! THIS IS THE PRICE TO PAY FOR GREED

Tell me what happens with a millionaire
When all the lights burns out in his eyes
I wanna know that the man I'll become
Can make a living, when I'm gone
Let me sleep with all the women on the street
So I will hurt the ones I really love
Give me three wishes, I will wish for three more
I wanna have it, I want it all
