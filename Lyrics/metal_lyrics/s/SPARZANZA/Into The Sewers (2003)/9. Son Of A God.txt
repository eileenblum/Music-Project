God, help me please
I've got a bad disease
I try to close my eyes again
I try to go
A long way from home
I'll take your light, I'll take it away
I'll put your life out
I'm gonna take it any day
You won't even see me coming
Stop running!

I'M THE MESSENGER OF DEATH, AND I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR BREATH 'TIL THE BREAK OF DAWN
STOP RUNNING, TURN AROUND, LISTEN HARD AND YOU WILL HEAR MY SONG
I'M THE SON OF A GOD

God gives me sights
In the darkest of nights
I try to be the one I should
I try to see
What he wants me to be
I am the light, who takes it away
I'll put your life out
I'm gonna take it any day
You won't even see me coming
Stop running!
