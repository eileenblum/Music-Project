Hear the distant cry for help from beyond
I stare at the wall
Hear the twisted face of hate sing a song
The demons call
Brother, tell me where am I
I can't see because I'm blind
We're all bound to die someday
Brother, tell me where am I

WHEN I SEE MYSELF IN THE MIRROR
I SEE A REFLECTION OF A BROKEN MAN
I WILL NEVER BE MYSELF AGAIN

See the hands of death coming up from the ground
I'm sick of it all
See the twisted face of pain all around
Your life is gone
Brother, tell me where am I
I can't see because I'm blind
We're all bound to die someday
Brother, tell me where am I
