Leading the wolves to a better place
And they're waiting for him to come
Standing on the brink of emptiness
'Cause they're waiting for him to come
Trippin' away one afternoon
And I'm waiting for him to come
He's seeming so distant, yet so close
And they're waiting for him to come
Lead me to him
Feed me to him
I'm waiting for him to arrive
It must be some kind of reason
That he's the god of the season

I'VE GOT A LONG WAY, GOT A LONG WAY NOW
I HAVE TO FIND MY WAY BACK SOMEHOW
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE KNOWS WHERE I AM
... ALREADY HOME

Discover the secrets about his names
And they're waiting for him to come
Running away from the man in flames
'Cause they're waiting for him to come
Given away to the southern sun
And I'm waiting for him to come
The best thing you can do, is run
And they're waiting for him to come
Lead me to him
Feed me to him
I'm waiting for him to arrive
It must be some kind of reason
That he's the god of the season
