Your children are gonna die
In the arms of our perversions
Your children are gonna die
Their youth will soothe our lust
Enslaved to our will
We donâ t need no guide
To lead us to the throne
To the throne of insanity
We've built a world
Where your children are gonna die

We wash our bloody hands
With your children tears
We feed our desires
With their innocence

See the fear
In their eyes
Hear them, theyâ re calling your name
Feel the pain
In their cries
Hear them, theyâ re calling in vain

Your children are gonna die
In the arms of our perversions
Your children are gonna die
Their youth will soothe our lust
Enslaved to our will
Your children are gonna die

We donâ t need no guide
To lead us to the throne
To the throne of insanity
We donâ t need no guide
To lead us to the throne
To the throne of insanity

See the fear
In their eyes
Hear them, theyâ re calling your name
Feel the pain
In their cries
Hear them, theyâ re calling in vain

Feel the pain
