Take a gun
Shoot you down
Take a gun
Kill yourself

So you wanna die
Make this day the final one
Leave a world of reality
For a place of eternity

Take a gun
Shoot you down
Take a gun
Kill yourself

No one cares
About your destruction
No one cares
About your suffocation

Take a gun
Shoot you down
Take a gun
Kill yourself

You the one that no one cares about
Your life is an agony
See the death in your cursed eyes
Feel the flame burning your mind

Take a gun
Shoot you down
Take a gun
Kill yourself

No matter your silence
Suicide donâ t need no reasons
Say goodbye to your enemies
Itâ s the last time you will

Take a gun
Shoot you down
Take a gun
Kill yourself

Die, you the one that no one sees
Your life is an agony [x4]

So you wanna die
Make this day the final one

Die, you the one that no one sees
Your life is an agony [x2]

Die, Die, Die
You the one that no one sees
Die, Die, Die
Die, Die, Die
You the one that no one sees
Die, Die, Die
