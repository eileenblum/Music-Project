Millions are dead in the name of God
Millions are dead on the fields of war
For the flag of a nation

Millions are dead for their difference
Millions are dead in the gas chamber
For the color of their skin

Millions are dead for a piece of land
Millions are dead on the road to exile
In the streets of hate, for liberty

Millions are dead in the name of God
Millions are dead on the fields of war
For the flag of a nation

Millions are dead for their difference
Millions are dead in the gas chamber
For the color of their skin

Millions are dead by the will of a man
Millions are dead blinded by illusions
Misled by promises, sacrificed for a king

The ground is cover with blood
Slaughters and genocides
In the silence of the world
Dead scream for revenge
The ground is cover with blood
Slaughters and genocides
In the silence of the world
Dead scream for revenge

The ground is cover with blood
Slaughters and genocides
In the silence of the world
Dead scream for revenge
Dead scream for revenge [x4]
