See the flame of our modernity
Burning all the plains around
These are the last days.
Extinction flows like a river of blood
Earth faces a bleak future
These are the last days.
Self destruction
Death is what we've left behind
Self destruction
And the sun will no longer shine

See, the earth is dying
See her burning
See her bleeding
See, the earth is dying
See her burning
And mankind doesnât care

Earth is lying lifeless on dead plants,
With fallen trees thrown around
This is the last breath.
Our poison is running trough her veins
Rain, the earth is shedding tears
This is the last breath.
Self destruction
Death is what we've left behind
Self destruction
And the sun will no longer shine

See, the earth is dying
See her burning
See her bleeding
See, the earth is dying
See her burning
And mankind doesnâ t care

Save the planet
Kill yourself
Save the planet
Save the planet
Kill yourself
Save the planet

See, the earth is dying
See her burning
See her bleeding
See, the earth is dying
See her burning
And mankind doesnâ t care

Self destruction [x8]
