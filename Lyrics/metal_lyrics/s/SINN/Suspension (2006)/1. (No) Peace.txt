It's time to fight the invader
To raise the flag of rebellion
No peace as they live
No peace as they breathe
Kill the enemy
It don't matter women children
Bleed for what you believe
Die to be free

Gonna give death to your enemies
Gonna bring pain into their families
No peace as they live
No peace as they breathe
Kill the enemy
It don't matter women children
Bleed for what you believe
Die to be free

Gonna give death to your enemies
Gonna bring pain into their families
Gonna give death to your enemies
Gonna bring pain into their families

No peace

It's time to fight the invader
To raise the flag of rebellion
No peace as they live
No peace as they breathe
Kill the enemy
It don't matter women children
Bleed for what you believe
Die to be free

Gonna give death to your enemies
Gonna bring pain into their families
Gonna give death to your enemies
Gonna bring pain into their families
Gonna give death to your enemies
Gonna bring pain into their families
