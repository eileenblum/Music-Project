God is a faschist and Satan a Nazi
Different names for a single lie
Different names but only one hate
Only one hate
God is a faschist and Satan a Nazi
Different names for a single lie
Different names but only one hate
Only one hate

See the gods fed on the men's hatred
See the men thirsting for their deadly desires
Servants kill blindly
As masters enjoy the widespread blood
Men trust the lie
A promised land for their souls
They hate for a word
And kill the unbelievers
The flag of intolerance is floating proudly
The slaughter has just begun

God is a faschist and Satan a Nazi
Different names for a single lie
Different names but only one hate
Only one hate
God is a faschist and Satan a Nazi
Different names for a single lie
Different names but only one hate
Only one hate

Men live and die controlled by their own hatred
The ghosts they fear were born from anger
Hegemony of fear
Supremacy of hate
Dictatorial faith

The evil hides behind a mask of blackness
The good draped in an immaculate whiteness
Opposites colors
United in war
Demons and angels are waiting for your soul

Men created god to their image
Too coward to bear the sole guilt
Men created god to their image
Ignorant and proud
Avid and sanguinary

I have no master
And I'm the master of no one
I assume my weakness
Donâ t need no scapegoat
Iâ m slave of myself
And bear the sole guilt
I donâ t need these lies
To know the way to go

Only one hate [x8]
