Still remember the pain

Silent screams are burning my mind
Frightened faces are watching me
Shadows are dancing before my eyes
Blood on the walls
Fear grows stronger everyday
Nothing can ease the pain
Stifling air, canât breath anymore
Claustrophobia

Broken bones, shattered skulls
My body and soul are bleeding to death
Groans of agony fill my realm
Fill my realm of suffering
Faceless men and war machines
Are spitting out death and darkness
The ghosts of hate are smashing my dreams
Violence murder and terror

Still remember the pain [x4]

Silent screams are burning my mind
Shadows are dancing before my eyes

Fear grows stronger everyday
Stifling air, canât breath anymore

I close my eye
And i wonder why
Iâ m stranded in hell
I close my eyes
Wishing nothing
But just to forget

Still remember the pain [x4]
Still remember [x3]
The pain
