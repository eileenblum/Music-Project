Hear them screaming in vain
Searching an answer for their bloody tears
See them running in vain
Trying to escape to their deadly life
One by one they're falling in the maze
Blinded by illusions
No one realised freedom meant suicide
Now they're creeping in the dark depth of fright

Come and taste you savior's corpse
But who's gonna ease your earthly pain
Come and drink your savior's blood
But who's gonna save you from yourself
From the day you were born till the one you die
Suffering is the price you must pay for life
No angels to take you away from this hell
No heaven beyond for the peace of your mind

No heaven beryond...

Hear them screaming in vain
Searching an answer for their bloody tears
See them running in vain
Trying to escape to their deadly life
One by one they're falling in the maze
Blinded by illusions
Noone realised, misled by their masks
Freedom meant suicide
From the day you were born till the one you die
Suffering is the price you must pay for life
No angels to take you away from this hell
No heaven beyond for the peace of your mind

No heaven beyond...
