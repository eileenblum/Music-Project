Breath of the past blows at my ears
As tears of memory are reddening my thoughts
Frightened silhouete standing in the wheel of time
Frightened silhouette lost in the mist of life
Blind stepping in the maze of doubt
Gone from home for such a long time but never reaching the end
Hand in hand with eternity
I walk on the traces of memory
Back to the past
I guess there's no other way

In promised land I want to rest
But in my dreams ring the loud steps of the fugitive
Can't stop the past attraction
Can't stop the run
Schemes are still the sames
Carry the weight of yesterday
Hand in hand with eternity
I walk on the traces of memory
Back to the past
I guess there's no other way

Can't stop the past attraction
Can't stop the past attraction...

Breath of the past blows at my ears
As tears of memory are reddening my thoughts
Frightened silhouete standing in the wheel of time
Frightened silhouette lost in the mist of life
Blind stepping in the maze of doubt
Gone from home for such a long time but never reaching the end
Never reaching the end
