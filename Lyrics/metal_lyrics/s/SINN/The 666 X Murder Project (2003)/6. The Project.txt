I'm the voice of your obscenity
I'll give you the means of your pornography

The blood of the innocence will color our union
Babies sacrificed on the altar of your desirs
Is not the crime better in pain
Sing and dance the death and its silence belong to you

I'm the blood
The blood of the offense
The face of the torment
I'm the scream
The scream of the demons
The arm of the affront
I'm the blood
The blood of the offense
The face of the torment

Come with your will
In a breath we leave
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Here stands the ghost of your obsessions
Rocked by the sweet sound of some agonies

The blood of the innocence will color our union
Babies sacrificed on the altar of your desirs
Is not the crime better in pain
Sing and dance the death and its silence belong to you

I'm the blood
The blood of the offense
The face of the torment
I'm the scream
The scream of the demons
The arm of the affront
I'm the blood
The blood of the offense
The face of the torment
I'm the blood
