[Music by : Ron. Lyrics by : Mike]

Multifarious mutants
they cross the brain
the inferno of your morbid mind

Damnation of immortal souls
perpetual - caustic septic vitality
damnation - deformed incubus
perpetual damnation

Mutilated dimensions
creations of subconsciousness
wood of putrefying souls
pylon of blasphemy
caustic bloody priest
cauterized to the cross
suppuration freak
loot crippling innards

Carnage feast
maggots infest eyes
mutilated corpse
eternal deformed

Mutilation by ghouls
deformed by pin and chain
vomiting suppurated innards
Captive in an image
of your own dreams
eternal fate
immortal phantasm

Damnation of immortal souls
perpetual - caustic septic vitality
damnation - deformed incubus
perpetual damnation

In a maze of despair
reek of putrefying souls
carbonized your mangled innard
cauterized malicious heretic

Mutilation by ghouls
deformed by pin and chain
vomiting suppurated innards
