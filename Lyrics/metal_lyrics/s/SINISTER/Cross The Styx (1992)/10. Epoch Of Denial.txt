[Music by : Ron. Lyrics by : Ron]

Epoch of denial
Visual deceit
two horned grown in man
disembody thee

Entreaty of lies
from her melting face
insolent contempt
to divide god's ways

Rise to the horns of capricorn
burn at the stake witch burn
inside the womb dies her unborn
melt into one repent

Execrate the human whore of beast
rise from the blackened soil

Reborn the epoch of truth
torture purified the soul
virgin cleansed from demon seed
no longer alive but free

Sacrifice
innocent life
your fear of god
is fed by superstition

I summon on thee
victims of inquisition
gather and feed from the corpse

[lead : Ron]

Submit to the call of the beast
rise from the blackened soil

Reborn the epoch of truth
torture purified the soul
virgin cleansed from demon seed
no longer alive but free
