[Music by : Ron. Lyrics by : Mike + Ron]

Unleashed from the swarm of mortality
arise in darkness where blackened souls dwell

Shapes of darkness will abide
the sound of death remains in emptiness

Among the void twilight remains
filled with spawn of blasphemy

Obscure vortex of morbid wrath
full of milignant mutations

Bestial luminous sembiance
source of abomination
consuming souls perpetual
horror beyond description

Descended in a new dimension
reborn in harassement
journey beyond eternity
travelling through this world of doom

From the burning depths they appear
lardaceous goo mutations
swarming among ancient spirits
spawn havoc creations

Descended in a new dimension
reborn in harassement
journey beyond eternity
unholy world of doom

Life like afterbirth - invoked semblance
inept creature - leave now seance ends

[lead : Andre]

My mind is going places
abandoning the body
envisioning my casket
hollow mortal remains

[lead : Ron]

Drawn tighter to the vortex
which center_s hell_s dimension
disclosure of agony
beyond the vacuum pylon

Malignant mutations
piercing my soul
amalgamation with agony
life slips away

Enter now the world of doom
