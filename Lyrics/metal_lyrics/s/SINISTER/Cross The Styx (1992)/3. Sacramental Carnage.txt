[Music by : Ron. Lyrics by : Mike]

Sacramental carnage
ultimate rejoining in the abyss

Cauterized sect fuse as one
final break-through the old world

Descended souls will dwell
into the crypts of emptiness
purified by massacre
eternal harassement

Surrounded by blackened sky
skin burns away
luxurious fire will unleash mortality

The hallowed path
far beyond
the occult of life

Immortality beyond the innerself
the soul is all that remains
dead another state of being
enter eternal bliss

descended souls will dwell
into the crypts of emptiness
purified by massacre
eternal harassement

[lead : Ron]
