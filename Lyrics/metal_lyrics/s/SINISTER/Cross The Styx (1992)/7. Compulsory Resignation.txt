[Music by : Ron. Lyrics by : Aad]

Assault your own blood
to indulge spiritual illness
possessive hands clamp
obsessed eyes force resignation

Mental collapse shall rule

Used innocence
marked for life
self-respect has been taken away

Abhor against masculine contact
painful remembrances
cross your progression

Fight innerself will pursue you
thrown away information
no one wants to listen to you
you have the wrong attitude

Compulsory resignation

Horrible pressure on the brain
self-blame manipulates your nerves
a wall of hatred grows around
damn the past forever or is there
any hope for improvement

[lead: Andre]
[lead: Ron]

Compulsory resignation
