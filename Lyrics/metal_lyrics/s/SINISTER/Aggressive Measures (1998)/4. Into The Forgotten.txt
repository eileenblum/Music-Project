Struggle within, no use kneeling
Cry out to god, soul abuser
Victors of pain, gather the sin
Together we are, hell we're in.

Into the forgotten
Into the darkness
Into the abyss
Paralysed, you stand by my side

Seeds of darkness, now grow in me
Final damnation upon the weak parts in me

Deny the fiction, born out of illusion
Raised by the wicked
Another time, another place
I would be grateful

Into the forgotten

Struggle within, no use kneeling
Cry out to god, soul abuser
Victors of pain, gather the sin
Together we are, hell we're in.

Into the forgotten
Into the darkness
Into the abyss
Paralysed, you stand by my side

Deny the fiction, born out of illusion
Raised by the wicked
Another time, another place
I would be grateful

Christ, nailed to the cross
Christ, nailed to the cross
Into the forgotten

Savior of nothing
Lost in illusion
Soon you will see
No more fantasy to seek.
