Unleashed by the fire
I'm your deepest fear
Burning in your mind
Opposite of heaven
Truth no near
Rulers of this world
In number they are seven

Emerged with hate
Soaked with blood
Everlasting pain
You have had not.

Useless being
I'm your deepest fear
Embraced by the devil
Feed me your anger
Find your true desire
Slaviors
In number they are seven.

Satan's spawn of endless rage
In times unknown, of the endless age.

Emerged with hate

Emerged with hate
Soaked with blood
Everlasting pain
You have had not
