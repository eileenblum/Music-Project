Meaningless cover of the soul
Ignorant slave of the mind
Trapped till I grow cold
Fleshless with the unknown entwined

Slave to nothing, till death,
I'm cursed and trapped in my body

Free of this life, demanding blood
Free of this life, demanding pain
Free of this life, demanding flesh
Free of this all, the fleshless will remain

Slave to nothing, till death,
I'm cursed and trapped

Weakness surrounding the world I see
Slaves of flesh, chained in reality
Caught in this body, sin guides the way
No way out, fleshless I'm free

Crawling - human waste, flesh - dominates
Achieving - ignorant greed
Destructive - disease starts to breed

The only way is to step into the unknown
The only way out is to die

Passed away lost from the flesh
Oneway trip, there's no return

Chained in reality - chained

Meaningless cover of the soul
Ignorant slave of the mind
Trapped till I grow cold
Fleshless with the unknown entwined

Passed away...
