Shades of darkness, staring at my misery
Blood follows the blood, my fate has already been sealed
Corridors of pleasure, a passage to hell it seems
Where am I, what have I done, to be here in this place.

Painfull screaming to your god
Useless sinless thoughts
Eating cadavers to stay alive
Existing, but not living

Screaming to oblivion

Eating cadavers to stay alive
Existing, but not living

Raging ghouls, burning flesh
Living vomit, is this a test

Creation of hate, destruction of peace
Demise of time... Chaos brings order

Raging ghouls, burning flesh
Living vomit, is this a test

Screaming to oblivion

Corridors of pleasure,
A passage to hell it seems
Where am I, what have I done
To be here in this place

Raging ghouls, burning flesh
Living vomit, is this a test

Chaos
Chaos brings
Chaos brings order
