Hear me, centaur of life
Destroy this land, full of pain
Candles burning inside of me
My eyes are closed, yet I see

Lust versus ratio, rage against peace
Violence controled by fear.

Face the demons of the past
Portend a lost continent
Follow the tracks to carnage
Forever it will seal your fate

Beyond the superstition
No man's land
Beyond the superstition

Hear me, centaur of life
Destroy this land, full of pain
Candles burning inside of me
Who am I to decide

Lust versus ratio, rage against peace
Violence controled by fear.

Face the demons of the past
Portend a lost continent
Follow the tracks to carnage
Forever it will seal your fate

Beyond the superstition
No man's land
Beyond the superstition

Face the demons of the past
Forever they will seal your fate.
