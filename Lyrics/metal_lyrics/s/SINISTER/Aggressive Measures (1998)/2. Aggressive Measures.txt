Million pieces gathered, for the puzzle of hell
Staring in the eyes of death, regretting to tell
Suffer mimic, mime of the dead
The time has passed, obtain the facts

Million pieces shattered
For the puzzle of hell
Persisting ways of nature
Regretting to tell

Suffer mimic, lord of death

Twisted words, temptation of sin
Spheres of time, so vivid
Dreams to become,
The ultimate aggression
