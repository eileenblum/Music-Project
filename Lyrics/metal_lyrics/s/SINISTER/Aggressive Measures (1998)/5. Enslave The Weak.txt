Dark ancient souls took hold of my body
Controlling my mind, heart and soul destined death.

A grey mist appears in my mind
Darkness descends

Enslave the weak, descend with hate

Falling into despair, emptiness to time
Rulers of the undead ripped by my side

A grey mist appears in my mind
Darkness descends

Enslave the weak, descend with hate

Come forth and confess the crime
Lose your flesh, now is the time

Enslave the weak
Enslave the weak

Betrayed and deceived, act of a liar
Spoke with a serpent's tongue
Betrayed and deceived

Words, compromising acts of emptiness
Deeds of damnation called upon yourself
In the true domain no words, just thoughts
Fantasy, what your life has left behind

Rise weak sheep of the lost sheppard
For he is damned and you are free

Furious demons enslave the flesh
Collecting slaves for future times
Apocalyptic sings rise in the evening sky
This holy war, the end of a sacred reich

Falling into despair, emptiness to time
Rulers of the undead ripped by my side

A grey mist appears in my mind
Darkness descends

Enslave the weak, descend with hate

Come forth and confess the crime
Lost your flesh, now is the time
