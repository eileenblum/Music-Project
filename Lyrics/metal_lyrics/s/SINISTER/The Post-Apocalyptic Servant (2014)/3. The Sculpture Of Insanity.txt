The sculpture of obsession
Determined to reveal
The neglected worship
of a so-called god

The sculpture of delusion
The carnal saints must die
to work on progress
for the statue of real hate

Sculpture of cutted flesh
Made to obey the sinners
Mandatory madness
for every human brain

The sculpture of delusion
increases the filthy mind
with hate towards the holy
and fear of Thy Father

The sculpture of hate
created by mincers
Flesh becomes art
Mutant skin decoration

The sculpture of insanity
created by butchers
A feast of limbs and bones
taken from the morgue

"Sculpture of insanity
Sculpture of cut flesh
Sculpture of insanity
A sculpture of rotten mash"
