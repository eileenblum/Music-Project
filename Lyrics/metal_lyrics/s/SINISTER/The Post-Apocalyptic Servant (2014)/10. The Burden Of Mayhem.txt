Cruelty of sentiments
Collision of independant forces
War men on death patrol
riding on dead horses

An army of slaves
made of rotten flesh
Marching to the chaos
Fighting for last breath

Cult of a ridding disease
Conduction of the pain
Grotesque fear of mayhem
World chaos to maintain

Entering the chessboard
for carnal objects to kill
Rebirth of despair
Eternal burden to fulfil

"The burden of Mayhem
The burden of Mayhem
The burden of Mayhem
Eternal burden to fulfil!"
