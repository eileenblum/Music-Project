Through a valley of chaos
an angel comes
In her hallucinating slumber
she's hobbing to the prom

With a litthe of conscious
she's hoping for a wonder
A feast of death
is what she finds

With her blue eyes
marked by depths of fear
She feels the sorrow
while she's looking for peers

Wandering in loneliness
Desperation takes control
The dark atmosphere
creates the perfect fail

Playing tricks with evil
there is hope to live
But mortal and weak
the masquerade of the angel
will be revealed

"Masquerade of an Angel
Pain revealed bydarkness
Fading away the pain
Also this life will end"
