Struggle of opposites
See the bleeding Gods
Death needs no angels
Skewers in His scrotch

Eaten to the tail
Only remainders are left
The spreading wings of fear
killed for theft

Theft of dark influence,
the perception of pain
The gods fight a wa
for the malicious, to retain

Feathers circling
Stick through the heart
A blood-soaked dress
The pain of wrath

Darkness will reign
Death is heir apparent
Surviving the struggle
Giving commandments

"To allow the acts of God
The underworld shall fall apart

A solution brought with pleasure
A stick through the heart
To abandon all intruders
All done by the macabre God!

The macabre God!"
