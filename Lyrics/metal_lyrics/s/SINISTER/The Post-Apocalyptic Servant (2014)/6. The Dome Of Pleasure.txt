Discrepancy of death
In the Dome of Pleasure
Bloodhound instinct
A killers breath

A swirl of organs
Gutted from the body
Murderers conflict
A forlorn massacre

No aim for life
But comprehension for mutiny
A game of death
A pleasure to survive

Caged mutants
Spreading limbs
Failure of evolution
Overcome its disease

The Dome means salvation
No acceptance for survival-mode
in all their shrines
This is pleasure

"The Dome of Pleasure
The Dome of pleasure
Be arranged

The Dome of Pleasure
The Dome of pleasure
Deranged"
