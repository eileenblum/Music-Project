The flesh infused with chems
and ready to be cut

The skin of a crippled
The legacy of wrath

Raincoat against all fear
A protection of the flesh

They need precise incision
an act of distress

Permitted by the absence
of a mortal in live

Preparation of the future
in the gloss of a knife

Here is the saviour
to watch over the undead

To hold life and pain
for there is no better dread

"Cut! Decision! Death!
Permission!

Gap! Disease! Skin!
Displease...

...The saviour! The pain will increase!"
