After a million year break
mankind survived in vain
By the lack of a rich soil
Only black vegs are obtain

For there is nothing left
then despair and an endless sight
The force manipulates them
"your own flesh is a delight"

The zest for life becomes less
Emotions drained by the Grim
Primary urgencies of existence
for the salvation of Him

The end of all that conquers
the beginning of damnation
They will all suffer under
common sad desperation

"The zest for life
drained by the Grim
The end of all that conquers
Desperation of new times"
