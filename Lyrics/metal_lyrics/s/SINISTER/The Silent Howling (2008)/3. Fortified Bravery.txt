To rise from the underworld, preserve the sands of time
Deity, jackal, savior, god, killed by all the others
Hunger for the souls of men, it burns forever more
Deity, jackal, savior, god, left forever dead

Continue the assault, defender of the realm

Born from this dying body, everlasting suicide
Chrine of worship, fight with fear, the gods will seldom listen
Warlord, liar, king or queen, salvation is my church
I say he rose from hell, this order is my curse

This is my legacy, this my curse, erase this secrecy
This is my legacy, this my curse, erase this secrecy, fortified bravery

Disturbed emotions, ravaged thoughts, sheer destruction, oppressed with secrecy
Nuclear fear and pearls of light, unfinished work, fortified bravery
Increased devotion for these honored dead, subversive menace, requisite facts
This is my legacy, this my curse, erase this secrecy, fortified bravery

Blind are those who follow, remainder of this world, retreat from agony
Blind are those who follow, campaign of misery, back sliding history
Blind are those who follow, vague registration, pure reincarnation

Once a blessing upon mankind had become a curse
Revival of the wicked, reflections of his work
Prophet of deception, chaos running deep
Onslaught upon mankind, diversion of the weak

To rise from the underworld, preserve the sands of time
Deity, jackal, savior, god, killed by all the others
Hunger for the souls of men, it burns forever more
Deity, jackal, savior, god, left forever dead

This is my legacy, this my curse, erase this secrecy
This is my legacy, this my curse, erase this secrecy, fortified bravery

Blind are those who follow, remainder of this world, retreat from agony
Blind are those who follow, campaign of misery, back sliding history
Blind are those who follow, vague registration, pure reincarnation
