One collective body and one collective mind
All where perished one by one
The anger in his work, the anger in his crime
Resistance to pain by the grace of god

Grotesque union of flesh and stone
Accusation of heresy
To where the children have fought
Here... in the palace of the fates

Palace of the fates

Entering a state of collective consciousness
Souls touched by heaven and the grace of god

Is this real... Or just an act of god?
Nature of this reality, intensify their agony
One collective body and one collective mind
All where perished one by one

Death does not exist, not exist in this reality
Torments by the grace of god

Purity of their christian innocence
Centuries of conflict, death does not exist
