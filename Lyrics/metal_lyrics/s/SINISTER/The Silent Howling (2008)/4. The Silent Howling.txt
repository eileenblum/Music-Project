A vision of power, confirmed by lunacy
Driven by anger, no signs of secrecy
Rely on what they want or what has not been seen
A future so desperate, untold yet still to be

For the blood on my hands, riders of death
Rely on what they want or what has not been seen

A contract of power, deformed by purity
Perfume of hatred, dismal atmosphere
I am what is left of it, I am their history
A future so desperate, untold yet still to be

For the blood on my hands, riders of death
Rely on what they want or what has not been seen

The silent howling, provoked conspiracy, malicious vagrancy
The silent howling, it has not yet been done

Scraping the flesh of nature, for this has not been told
Scraping the flesh of nature, for this has not been told
Scraping the flesh of nature, for this has not been told
Scraping the flesh of nature, artificial empathy

Beast of burden, for this has not been told
Mandate of violence, for this has not been told
Cruelty of art, for this has not been told
Malicious deformity

Path of no return, together as one
Crusader of the realm to where the demon has won
Path of no return, together as one
Crusader of the realm to where the demon has won

The silent howling... the silent howling... the silent howling...

Path of no return, together as one
Crusader of the realm to where the demon has won
Path of no return, together as one
Crusader of the realm to where the demon has won

A vision of power, confirmed by lunacy
Driven by anger, no signs of secrecy
Rely on what they want or what has not been seen
A future so desperate, untold yet still to be
