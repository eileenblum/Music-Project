Gathered here tonight with blessings from the gods
Worship those who are within the community of the speaking truth

All that is said, all that is done, within the silent law
Strange visions, past of violence, slow down and fade away
A force to be reckoned and laws to obey
Ritual of isolation when flesh will be clay

If it bleeds... if it bleeds...

They are the ones who betrayed our own beliefs and act as charlatans of their own demise

Chaotic structure within the balance of the dying gods
This world will see that they are next the next to be
One in the chamber, conquest of power from the dying gods
No one to trust, no one to blame, for them to see, paying the price of immortality

If it bleeds... stirring of paranoia
If it bleeds... values of antisocial
If it bleeds... morals of hollow idols
If it bleeds... we're gonna kill it
