Patching the consciousness of one, being reduced to none
Slowly going insane, disorientation remains

Increase the quality of their ritual dead
The new corrupt bodies of the inflicted are covered with infected blood
Freeing the unstable sompound inside, everything they contained was absorbed
Decomposing corpses of the wretched people had been knifed and tossed into graves

Masses of corpses are left behind
Sullying the flesh, republic of the grave
Masses of corpses are left behind
Sullying the flesh, republic of the grave

The existence of the firstborn legend, a black heart, cold as ice
A clear tendency towards sadism and destruction
Raw material for corporeal manifestation, driven by primary impulses
This is a fate worse than death

Masses of corpses are left behind
Sullying the flesh, republic of the grave
Masses of corpses are left behind
Sullying the flesh, republic of the grave

Patching the consciousness of one, being reduced to none
Slowly going insane, disorientation remains

Republic of the grave... republic of the grave... republic of the grave

The existence of the firstborn legend, a black heart, cold as ice
A fate worse than death

Patching the consciousness of one, being reduced to none
Slowly going insane, disorientation remains

Republic of the grave
