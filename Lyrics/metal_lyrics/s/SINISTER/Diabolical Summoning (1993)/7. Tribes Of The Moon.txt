Enter the refuge of the nightbreed
Behind the immortal gates
Below the forbidden tombs
The ancient catacombs

Baphomet infernal god
Baptize me with thy blood

Ceremony to transform
Occult sepruchral rite
Judge me with thy blood
For cabal is my name

Time has come
for my ancient transfiction

Secret city
The cemetary Mydlan
Tribes of the moon
Natural world left behind
like a nocturnal dream
Tribes of the moon
Monstosity with immortality
Embraced by the tribes

Baphomet infernal god
Baptize me with thy blood

Black prophecies
written on the tomb walls
Forbidden signs appear
from the hands of time
Roaming mortals
are meat for the beasts

Secret city
The cemetary Mydlan
Tribes of the moon
Natural world left behind
like a nocturnal dream
Tribes of the moon
Monstosity with immortality
Embraced by the tribes

Baphomet infernal god
Baptize me with thy blood
