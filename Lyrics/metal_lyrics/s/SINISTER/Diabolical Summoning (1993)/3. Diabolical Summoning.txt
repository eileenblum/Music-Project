Black pentagrams resurrect
as a dark treacherous death
reflects the eyes of everlasting disgrace,
a burning sky with dreadful shapes
Nocturnal sign of blasphemy,
sacrilegious prophecies
Reflections of forgotten fright,
they disturb the silent night

Come forth demon gods
Diabolical summoning

Sunken valleys of the dead
Desert of nocturnal tombs,
beholding occult prophecies
The aeons from the underworld

Diabolical summoning

See through the eyes of existence
Ritual of the ancient spheres

Chaldeans above the lost temple of Ur,
governed by the celestial gouls
Burning demons of the deep an unnatural existence
Threatens chaos from the abyss
Unzoned hostile waste beyond
Altar of madness has turned blood red
Diabolical summoning in ancient tongue

Diabolical summoning

I call on the serpent of the spheres
God of evil spells lord of thou hostile hordes
They are mighty children, ancient ones are thee
They are seven, they are seven times seven
seven cities fallen in ruin
They are the flood which rushes through the land
I pray to the eternal INFERNAL MAJESTY
Open the gate, open unto me

Black pentagrams resurrect
as a dark treacherous death
reflects the eyes of everlasting disgrace,
a burning sky with dreadful shapes
Nocturnal sign of blasphemy,
sacrilegious prophecies
Reflections of forgotten fright,
they disturb the silent night

Come forth demon gods
Diabolical summoning

Chaldeans above the lost temple of Ur,
governed by the celestial spirits
Altars of madness have turned blood red
Diabolical summoning in ancient tongue

Diabolical summoning

See through the eyes of existence
Ritual of the ancient spheres

Open the gates and rule thy earth once more
