Blood flows over me
Feelings of excitement
A pleasant ache

Scenery of flesh
Bodies bounded by rotting
Paradise of pain
Screams they numb me

Crucified immortals,
mutilated and impaled
Suffering is everlasting,
lamentation of the damned

Appearance from the guides of death
Fire among the blackened shapes,
beholding sodomizing gouls
screams and pleasantness

All disappears as I scream at the wind
Glaring light blinded the eyes,
an angel calls unto me
Embracing her naked body,
bestial vitality awakes

Bodily contortion
Impalment of the flesh
Cut throat, ejaculation
Innards receiving cum

Blood flows over me
Feelings of excitement
A pleasant ache

Scenery of flesh
Bodies bounded by rotting
Paradise of pain
Screams they numb me

Crucified immortals,
mutilated and impaled
Suffering is everlasting,
lamentation of the damned

Appearance from the guides of death
Fire among the blackened shapes,
beholding sodomizing gouls
screams and pleasantness

All disappears as I scream at the wind
Imprisoned by the blackened sin
