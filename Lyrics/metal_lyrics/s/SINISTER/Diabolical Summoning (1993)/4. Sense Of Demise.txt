Burning cross appears, symbolizing death
Black waters stir, a painful sight
Secret faces overarc the spheres
The wind groans, seance repeats

Gorge of night, unseen woods
Shadows cast out, purgatory winds
Desert moans a silent scream
Burning cosmos, sign of the beast

Through the spheres before time
Immeasurable dimensions
Full of anger, desire and lust
The secret faces overshadow it all

Gorge of the night, unseen woods
Shadows cast out, purgatory winds
Desert moans a silent scream

Nightmares hunting the innerself
Visions reflections of an afterlife

As I fall down on my knees
Raise my left hand in the signs of the horns
Seance starts, I scream in ancient tongue
Invocation, appearance in black
Faceless one, guide of the night
Prince of the evol spirits in the air
Lord Pazuzu let my share thy wings
Show thou world, make my visions live!

Nightmares hunting the innerself
Visions reflections of an afterlife

Hunger for dimensions of the dragon lust
Huge bright flames roar within the horned dog

Dragon bull creator of lacivious lust
Pure pleseantness laughter in disguise

It roams in thee, my demon seed
Vigorous power abominated strength
Locust legions from a chaotic realm
Hostile horde a possessive dream

Hunger for dimensions of the dragon lust
Secret knowledge, a burning dream
Unspoken words, ancient quest rejected

Dragon bull creator of lacivious lust
Pure pleseantness laughter in disguise

It roams in thee, my demon seed
Vigorous power abominated strength
Locust legions from a chaotic realm
Hostile horde a possessive dream

Secret knowledge, a burning dream
Unspoken words, tortured minds
Ancient quest, still unknown
What is true? Sense of demise
