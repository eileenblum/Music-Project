Shadows of sadness dazzle me deep inside
Tears are falling, as the winter captures my mind
Darkness surrounds me as reach out in emptyness
Running through a maze, a desert which holds the pain

The sands that blinds my eyes,
has hurt me deep inside Entonglement, trust fades away
Nothing to hold besides enduring pain

Merriment has forsaken me
Obscure dreams of degrading times
Countless thoughts possessed by remembrance
Forgiveness, will it cross my path?

Midway in my life journey, I went astray
My heart is filled with fear
as fate shriveled and shrank

Captured by madness, rigor mortis of the mind
Faith has been ripped apart
like a heart that_s bleeding fast
Innerself keeps burning from visions of the past
A future seen so desperate is there a way to escape
Isolation is consuming me
Struggling a way of life

Mystical illusions
Days of darkness are haunting me
Mystical illusions
Despising the destiny

Mystical illusions
Days of darkness are haunting me
Mystical illusions
Despising the destiny

The endless grief is growing
like clouds combining
Been shackeled in the everlasting past

Shadows of sadness dazzle me deep inside
Tears are falling, as the winter captures my mind
Darkness surrounds me as reach out in emptyness
Running through a maze, a desert which holds the pain

Mystical illusions
Days of darkness are haunting me
Mystical illusions
Despising the destiny

Essence of life it all falls apart
been shackeled in the everlasting past
