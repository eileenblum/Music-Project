Arise from beyond an obscure gate
Awaken from the ancient slumber
Graceful phantasm of the netherworlds
Mortals have summoned in Enochian tongue
Diminish until the stars benumbed
The opened mysteries of creation
Arise, appear before before the covenant
Parttakers of the unified wisdom

Unknown ancient knowledge locked behind the stars
Hypocrisy is shackled in the elder dark

Dark is the evil among the wicked
Blackened eyes stir up the wrath of sin
Lord of the abyss maybe magnified
Whose name among ya is wrath!

Arise from beyond an obscure gate
Awaken from the ancient slumber
Graceful phantasm of the netherworlds
Mortals have summoned in Enochian tongue

Unknown ancient knowledge locked behind the stars
Hypocrisy is shackled in the elder dark

Mighty sands enter into the third angle
Garnished with myriad ever burning lamps
Spirits of older mighty in the trapezoid
Conclude us receivers of the mysteries

Queen of Hades beholder of fateful sin
Sacred lust the never ending ecstasy

Mighty sands enter into the third angle
Garnished with myriad ever burning lamps
Spirits of older mighty in the trapezoid
Conclude us receivers of the mysteries

Demon appears
Beholds the face of death
Smiling with contempt
Fulfiller of lust
Magnified wrath
Partaker of hell
Seals of false honour
Unified wisdom
Absu left his mark

Diminish until the stars benumbed
The opened mysteries of creation
Arise, appear before before the covenant
Parttakers of the unified wisdom

The visions are so mighty yet been unseen
Never ending shadows full of eternal pain

Dark is the evil among the wicked
Blackened eyes stir up the wrath of sin
Lord of the abyss may be magnified
Whose name among ya is wrath!

Arise from beyond an obscure gate
Awaken from the ancient slumber
Graceful phantasm of the netherworlds
Mortals have summoned in Enochian tongue
Queen of Hades beholder of fateful sin
Sacred lust the never ending ecstasy

Mighty sands enter into the third angle
Garnished with myriad ever burning lamps
Spirits of older mighty in the trapezoid
Conclude us receivers of the mysteries
