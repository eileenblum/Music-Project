Master, sovereign lord
Of the great abyss, I summon thee
Come forth from the burning pain
The ancient slumber
O'divined lord of emptiness

Servant of the black wreaker of havoc
Stir up vexation, art of the damned
NOW BURN IN ME!

Master, I ride the whirlwind
The dragon flames which surrounds my soul
I have become the deathless one
Furious with hate
Sword of the beast awoken to slay

Slaughter of the weak
Glorification of blasphemy
Torment to the rats
And garland to the wicked

Great spawn of the worm
The abyss roars with hate
Powerful manifestation OF SATAN

Diabolical sons of pleasure
The tools of destruction
Arise for I'm thou lord DIVINED

I am the sign the blood of vengeance
Spirit of the horde, covenant of death

Slaughter of the weak
Glorification of blasphemy
Torment to the rats
And garland to the wicked

Servants of the black wreakers of havoc
Stir up vexation, art of the damned
NOW BURN IN ME!

Master, I ride the whirlwind
The dragon flames which surrounds my soul
I have become the deathless one
Furious with hate
Sword of the beast awoken to slay

Great spawn of the worm
The abyss roars with hate
Powerful manifestation OF SATAN

Diabolical sons of pleasure
The tools of destruction
Arise for I'm thou lord DIVINED

Master, sovereign lord
Of the great abyss, I summon thee
Come forth from the burning pain
The ancient slumber
O'divined lord of emptiness
