From the breath of Lucifer I'm born
Hell's creation, death in the purest form
Lord of demise, clandestine demigod
Scornful saint, the curse of humanity
UNSEEN DARKNESS
UNSEEN DARKNESS

I ride the blackened night of blasphemy
To devour souls perpetually
I burned the witches at the stake alive
And pulled the switch of the guillotine

I made the world burn in black
As lava made them scald 'till death
I was the voice of the son of sam
And the knife in the rippers hands

I'm blitzkrieg, I'm war
Consume lives for ever more

From the breath of Lucifer I'm born
Hell's creation, death in the purest form
Lord of demise, clandestine demigod
Scornful saint, the curse of humanity

I am the pain and suffering of mankind
I'm death itself the horror of life
UNSEEN DARKNESS
UNSEEN DARKNESS

I ride the blackened night of blasphemy
To devour souls perpetually
I burned witches at the stake alive
And pulled the switch of the guillotine

I made the world burn in black
As lava made them scald 'till death
I was the voice of the son of sam
And the knife in the rippers hands
I'm blitzkrieg, I'm war
Consume lives for ever more
UNSEEN DARKNESS
UNSEEN DARKNESS

I am the sword of KINGU, the slaying death
I'm homicidal destructive rage
I am the pain and suffering of mankind
I'm death itself the horror of life
UNSEEN DARKNESS
UNSEEN DARKNESS

Deadly fatal disease starvation of the weak
Catastrophes, eternal world of doom
Painful deadly screams hail me into bliss
Incineration, combustion of life
Rejoiced in me

Violated, mutilated, cauterized
Raped, choked, murdered, sodomized
Outrage, stabbed, decapitated
Painful deadly screams hail me into bliss
Incineration, combustion of life
Rejoiced in me

I'm riding on the air and roaring in fire
I'm possessing fate, thou world I devour
Stare in the eyes of death
See I fought I'm fratricidal  (??????)
Rigor mortis, I PUT TO DEATH
I PUT TO DEATH
