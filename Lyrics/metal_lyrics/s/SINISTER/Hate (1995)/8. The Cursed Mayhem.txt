From beyond death they rise in furious hate
Malicious demons harbingers of scornful wrath
The awoken pain
Dark waters stir the abyss roars with hate
Damned souls scream in agonizing pain
I summoned up the mayhem of oblivious times

Smeared the blood upon my face
On my throne of human waste
Bloodfeast my carnage rite
Bodies slaughtered to sacrifice

Bow down before the ABSU fiends
Wanderers in the land of waste
Beware, I conjured thee
Thou will suffer and unseen

I'm the author of all pain
Transformed to my ancient soul
Dragonbull with a body of flames
Lustfull skin as cold as ice
I burn from thou desire
Give me pain and thou fire

THE CURSED MAYHEM
THE CURSED MAYHEM
Reborn from pain and hatred
Breeding the new aeon of the beast

THE CURSED MAYHEM
Doglord and dragonbull breeders of the goat
Lord of abomination unseen behemoth

I'm the author of all pain
Secret cult of the stars
Mad and howling covered with blood
Yelled the names of the ancient ones

Screaming proudly at their rite
From beyond death they rise in furious hate
Malicious demons, the awoken pain
I summoned up the mayhem of oblivious times

Smeared the blood upon my face
From the efforts of human waste (????????)
Bloodfeast my carnage rite
Bodies slaughtered to sacrifice

THE CURSED MAYHEM
THE CURSED MAYHEM
Doglord and dragonbull breeders of the goat
Lord of abomination unseen behemoth
THE CURSED MAYHEM
Reborn from pain and hatred
Breeding the new aeon of the beast
