I invoke thee, nameless beings
Children of the underworld
Covered with blood
Embraced by fire, ANNU spawned

Call upon the dead
They were and once more will be
Warriors of KUR
Rulers of the black earth

Screaming demons
Children of the serpent god
VENGEANCE IS SWORN!

Wreak vengeance upon them
Secret covenant will have revenge
From the depths the nameless will rise
The seven lords reborn in UR
The cold burning sword beholds the wrath

Suffer - in pain
Suffer - bleeding
Suffer - to dream

Covered with blood
Embraced by fire, ANNU spawned
Screaming demons
Children of the serpent god
VENGEANCE IS SWORN!

Call upon the dead
They were and once more will be
Warriors of KUR
Rulers of the black earth

Secret covenant will have revenge
From the depths the nameless will rise
The seven lords reborn in UR
The cold burning sword beholds the wrath

Suffer - in pain
Suffer - bleeding
Suffer - to dream

AWAITING THE ABSU
AWAITING THE ABSU
AWAITING THE ABSU

VENGEANCE IS SWORN!
Invocation in unknown words
Screamed in forgotten tongue
Ruins of UR rumbling
The seed of rebellion reborn

Necromantic art from the kingdom of Woe

CTHULHU sleeps and dreams the burning pain
PAZUZU plague gods, shaped from the blood of KINGU

Calling of the spirits who dwell in the lost
Dark shining world of the ancient horde

Covered with blood

Embraced by fire, ANNU spawned
Screaming demons
Children of the serpent god
VENGEANCE IS SWORN!

Wreak vengeance upon them
Secret covenant will have revenge
From the depths the nameless will rise
The seven lords reborn in UR
The cold burning sword beholds the wrath

Suffer - in pain
Suffer - bleeding
Suffer - to dream

AWAITING THE ABSU
AWAITING THE ABSU
