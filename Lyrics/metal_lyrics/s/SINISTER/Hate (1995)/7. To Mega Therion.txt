Evocation of mass destruction
Dimensions opened mayhem enshines
Catastrophes, natural terrors
Total chaos
The world welters in blood
TO MEGA THERION
TO MEGA THERION
666

Rivers of blood overflown
With human waste
Rains of fire
The earth will burn

Armageddon, days of darkness
Judgment day, who's to judge
Antichrist, the beast of mayhem
King of kings, death of the world
TO MEGA THERION
TO MEGA THERION
666

Holy carnage, explosion of hatred
Demons are slaying, warfare of mayhem
Brothers of darkness
The servants of the beast

Rebels of the wasteland
Do what thou wilt
Shall be the whole of the Law
When darkness enshines

Divination of the flames
Breed of the bestial race
Legions which are sworn
Reborn to reign this war

LUCIFER, bringer of light
Ineffable king of hell
SATAN will be victorious
In the battle of Armageddon

Rebels of the wasteland
Do what thou wilt
Shall be the whole of the Law
When darkness enshines

Demons are slaying, holy carnage
Brothers of darkness
The servants of the beast

Armageddon, days of darkness
Judgment day, who's to judge
Antichrist, the beast of mayhem
King of kings, death of the world
TO MEGA THERION
TO MEGA THERION
666

Divination of the flames
Breed of the bestial race
Legions which are sworn
Reborn to reign this war
Nazarene decapitated
Jehovah screams in flames
Carnage of the christian god
The war is almost won!

LUCIFER, bringer of light
Ineffable king of hell
SATAN will be victorious
In the battle of Armageddon

Heaven's kingdom devastated
Carnage of the christian god
Jehovah is slaughtered
LUCIFER REJOICED -
- TO MEGA THERION
