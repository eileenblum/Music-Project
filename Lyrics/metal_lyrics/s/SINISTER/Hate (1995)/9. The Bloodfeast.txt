Embraced by death to count immortality
Raging infectious malice
Family driven by lunacy

Massacre of symbols, THE BLOODFEAST
Helter skelter, revelation 9

Death will surround them
To secrecy they're sworn
Creating days of destruction
Mayhem, violence, pure paranoia
In massacre reborn

Massacre of symbols, THE BLOODFEAST
Helter skelter, revelation 9

To secrecy they're sworn
Creating days of destruction
Mayhem, violence, pure paranoia

MANSON, commander of death
Reincarnation of wrath
Both SATAN and Christ
Curse the world by it's sin

Embraced by death to count immortality
Raging infectious malice
Family driven by lunacy

MANSON, commander of death
Reincarnation of wrath
Both SATAN and Christ
Curse the world by it's sin

Mutilation by knifes, the bullet secures
Consume to relax in the slaughter
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE

Personalities symbolized, social insanity
Driven to distraction
Ruled by morbid
MORBID THOUGHTS
MORBID THOUGHTS
RULED BY MORBID THOUGHTS

THE BLOODFEAST
THE BLOODFEAST

To secrecy they're sworn
Creating days of destruction
Mayhem, violence, pure paranoia

Massacre of symbols, THE BLOODFEAST
Helter skelter, revelation 9
Massacre of symbols, THE BLOODFEAST
Helter skelter, THE BLOODFEAST
