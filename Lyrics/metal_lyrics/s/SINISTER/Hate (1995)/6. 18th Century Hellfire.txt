Gathered in black
Embodied in blood
Cult has summoned to celebrate
Adoration, a hellfire's feast

Lascivious lord in thou name we feast
Bring us rapture lord of disease
Commencement of the ceremony
Hellfire's ancient pagan rite - RITE

Rise up - infernal lord
Divined abomination
Rise up - blackened angel
Lascivious one- Appear!

Lascivious lord in thou name we feast
Hellfire's ancient pagan rite
All've gathered in blackened fire
To celebrate, TO BLEED FOR SATAN

The earth's grown black, ancient dawn
Sacred spells, screamed in tongue
Blood unleashed to rejoice
Ritual sacrifice

Vomit upon the cross
Demean the enslaver
Blasphemy and disgust
The permanent ecstasy

O'terrible lord of darkness
Surround us with thou stench
From thou bestial breath
ASTHAROT - Rise

Gathered in black, embodied in blood
All've gathered in blackened fire
To celebrate, TO BLEED FOR SATAN
Sacred spells, screamed in tongue
Blood unleashed to sacrifice

Vomit upon the cross
Demean the enslaver
Blasphemy and disgust
It's real it's ecstasy (???????)

Embodied in blood
Ecstasy off the hellfire's feast
