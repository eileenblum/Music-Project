Hatred, violence, a deadly terror
Teutonic knights, embraced death
The sky turns red, the world will burn
Days of darkness, oblivious prophecy

The lightning death, armed with hate
Prophet transgressor, a demon from the past
The marching terror, purify the world
There's no salvation, the enslaver enslaved

Emerging from chaos
Mass destruction, pure holocaust
Root out the rats in the chambers of death

Hatred
Hatred

Hatred, violence
THE EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS

EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS
EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS

Legions from hell
Marching through a malicious world
Root out the lambs, incinerated on the cross

Hatred

Hatred, violence
THE EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS

EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS
EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS

Hatred, violence a deadly terror
Teutonic knights, embraced death
The lightning death, armed with hate
Prophet transgressor, a demon from the past
Visions of a time where chaos runs wild
Malicious terror uncontrolled
The apocalypse unfolds
I saw the world burn in hate
Pure chaos can't be enslaved
I saw demons in my dreams
Awoken from their deadly sleep
I saw it all under blood
The everlasting holocaust
Destructive forces reign
In chaos, violence and hatred
