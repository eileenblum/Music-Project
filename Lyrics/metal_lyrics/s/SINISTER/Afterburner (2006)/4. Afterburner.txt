Atrocious crash, altitude of terror
The skies are red, assault on civil liberty
Theft and deceit, weak quest for revenge

Invade and destroy their prideless land
Invaluable words of trust
Written laws of ethnic cleansing

Towards the inwards, invidious and beloved
Irrelevant violence focused on the balance of time

[Repeat 2nd verse]

Kingdom come, or just some lunacy?
Monster of urban history
Atheist, or a freak of nature?
Morals set aside, a living philosophy

[Repeat 1st verse]

Afterburner - Unrelieved and unbound
Afterburner - Uncalled and uncared
Afterburner - Unallied and unalike
Afterburner - Black mark in history

[Repeat last verse]
