20 years ago my anguish sealed an oath
Found on the steps of the demon church
Fiercely hunted by the secret society
War against the underworld for 1,000 more years

Rulers of slavery
Relentless tragedy
Become the sacrifice
Hate their empty hearts

[Repeat 1st verse]

Silently they marched, spreading their disease
Gruesome art spread out, tangled in blood
Lugubrious atmospheric design, a feast for the
dreadful
A social higher awareness will end the status quo

[Repeat 2nd verse]

Bizarre and unique lies
Suspicion of the lead
Frantic rage and fright
Into submission

When all is lost
Buried underneath
Strange change of faith - inside my deepest hate
Into submission,
Pray useless prayers towards your fictional god,
Only the penitent man will pass

[Repeat previous verse]

[Repeat 1st, 3rd, and 2nd verses]
