In the battle of the obscure
Tragic death, so suddenly
Slowly unlatches the leather strap
Roaming mortals, so divine

Deadly intention, with the will to kill
Eyes locked, your heart pounds

The grey massacre, a familiar sight
Substance of fire, the visible truth
Modified version of an alternate reality

Deadly intention, with the will to kill
Eyes locked, your heart pounds

Grey massacre...[x3]
...Seared into his flesh
Grey massacre...[x3]
...Seared into his flesh

I see this world, I see it dead
Accumulate and multiply the victims of the dead
What always was, will ever be
Dark risen force, repeated history

[Spoken word:]
It's all the more tragic, that they were young
But they lived very, very long lives
They could not have expected, nor they would have wished to see
As much of the mad and macabre as they have seen that day
For them an ideal summer afternoon drive became a nightmare

Grey massacre...[x3]
...Seared into his flesh
Grey massacre...[x3]
...Seared into his flesh

I see this world, I see it dead
Accumulate and multiply the victims of the dead
What always was, will ever be
Dark risen force, repeated history
