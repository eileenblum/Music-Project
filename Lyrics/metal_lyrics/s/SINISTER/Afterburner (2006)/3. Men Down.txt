Infinite sense
Nothing to lose
A sacred war
I feel a stoke,a mindless blow, occult seance
Judas or savior? Reality or dream?
Is this the day of reckoning?

Contradicted sacrifice
Sacramental doom

Sinner among the saints
Hazard of suspicious thought
Upheaval or denial?
Prostitue of morality

Uphold the threat
Messenger of death

[Repeat 3rd verse]

Obscene and obscure
Regain, rejoice, or burn

Perish from this land
An endless war
A horrific rack
Incapable whore

No concrete goals
Nor an abstract thought
Impaled through standards
The enemy laughs

Men down [x3]

Perish from this land
An endless war
A horrific rack
Incapable whore
