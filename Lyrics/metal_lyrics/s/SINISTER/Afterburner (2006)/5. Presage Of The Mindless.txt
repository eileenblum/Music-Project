hear me roar, god of infidelity
Be obedient to the past
See what others might have not
Hear me roar of the infinite wrath
Revenge is a virtue
Blood red murder
Hear what others might have not
See the pain from the infinite wrath

Strange values presently among us
Right is wrong, day is night
Misbehave of leaders and their sheep
Follow me, I'll be your king
Confirm your lack of faith
Confess or be forgotten
Concede to your weakness
Follow me, I'm be your king

Feast upon the living
Wisdom will be destroyed
Like a gun calling for duty
Or a knife pierced throughout your throat
In sickness and in health
Death is upon your side
Hail Jesus, god of sin
Step aside, I am your king

Burned, stabbed, and slaughtered
Senseless lunacy
Like a stream of everlasting pride
Enshrine this sign

Wake up from this dying world
Lesser man of life
Dreaded by the unholy
Not a king, just a lie

Officer of a lesser god
Gutted in your church

Sacramental weakness - Historic failure died on the cross [x3]

Officer of a lesser god
Gutted in your church

[Repeat 5th verse]

An obvious explanation
Yet difficult to see
Manipulated offspring
Children of misery
Confirm your lack of faith
Confess or be forgotten
Concede to your weakness
Follow me, I am your king

Sacramental weakness - Historic failure died on the cross [x2]

Presage of the mindless...[x3]
Gutted in your church
Presage of the mindless
Like a stream of everlasting pride
Presage of the mindless
Enshrine this sign, everlasting pride, fulfill the lie
