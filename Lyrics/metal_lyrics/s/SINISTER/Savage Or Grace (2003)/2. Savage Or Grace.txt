[solo: Pascal]

Adapt in flames, infant lies
Gallery of circumcision
I see this world, drowned in blood
Abidance the new arrival
Absurd abuse, abused absurd
Abysmal device of fictive horror
Cross of death, whore of life
Current way of evolution

Savage or grace
Countless trips through time
Savage or grace

Fierce nights, lack of empathy
Concede, your immortality
Cultivate, the seeds of death
Decapitate, to bury the rest

Savage...savage or grace [2x]

Whores of the light, redeemed by vice
Benevolence pride altered by lust
Forever to slay...
Savage or grace

Savage or grace
Cryptic state of flesh
Savage or grace

[solo: Pascal]

Fierce nights, lack of empathy
Concede, your immortality
Cultivate, the seeds of death
Decapitate, to bury the rest

Savage...savage or grace
