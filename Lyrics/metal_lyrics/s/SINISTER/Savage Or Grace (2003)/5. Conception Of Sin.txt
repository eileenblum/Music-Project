Drowning
Choke on it
Embrace the current
Recognize the high
Instant frame denied

Submerged
Captured by a turning pivot
Fluids leave the drain 
Spilled in after life

Devious kill
Gentle reap what's sawn
melt into the boiling blood

Departing from accepted ways
Overcome by superior force
Oblique answers, direct questions
His tone became menacing

Stream of consciousness
Flow of thought
Ill predictions
Lambent tongues of flames

Ominous rumbling of discontent
His black heart connected another black deed
Dark undercurrent of hostility
Characterized by immortal deceit

Tongues
Of flames
Alongside
The Conception of sin

Devious kill
Gentle reap what's sawn
melt into the boiling blood

Stream of consciousness
Flow of thought
Ill predictions
Lambent tongues of flames

[solo: Pascal]

Choke on it
Embrace the current
Recognize the high
Instant frame denied

Submerged
Captured by a turning pivot
Fluids leave the drain 
Spilled in after life

Stream of consciousness
Flow of thought
Ill predictions
Lambent tongues of flames
