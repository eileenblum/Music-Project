Sanctions, everlasting lord
Cold fingers around my throat
Hell, luxurious place of emptiness

Face down, head to the ground
Ten years of suffering
Enter speak and die
Acts of ecstasy

Apocalypse in time

Grotesque pile of ancient entities
The horns of the shrew are raped and slashed

Sanctions, everlasting lord
Cold fingers around my throat
Hell, luxurious place of emptiness

[solo: Pascal]

Face down, head to the ground
Ten years of suffering
Enter speak and die
Acts of ecstasy

[solo: Pascal]

Apocalypse in time

Grotesque pile of ancient entities
The horns of the shrew are raped and slashed

Aad - drums
Rachel - vocals
Alex - bass
Pascal - guitars
