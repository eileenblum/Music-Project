Enter, this cloud of sudden dreams
Assembled, or what so far it seems
Asylum, residence of fear
Purgatory, driven by hatred

To seek the truth, behold an resurrect
To purge in flames, rejoin and recollect

Vigilante, bringer of death
True renegade of deformation
Cursed, blessed or butcher?
Collapse rewind

Venture, without regards of loss
The absence of conditional behavior

Massacre
Birth rewind
Death applied

[solo: Pascal]
