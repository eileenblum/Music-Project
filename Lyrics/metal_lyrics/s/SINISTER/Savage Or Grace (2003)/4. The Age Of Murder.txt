Contempt the mutant mystery
Wrath, release this wrath on me
Seek, what no man tries to see
Find: worthless killing spree

Contempt
Wrath
Lust...Ecstasy

Circus of relentless vice
Killed, Thrilled in draconian times

The age of murder

Symmetry, a freak of nature
Ignored by the rotten flesh

Killed, thrilled, blood spilled
The price of disaffection when the reaper raids his victim
Rapid rape, ravished rage
The sound of gospel to cover what's been done

The age of murder [3x]

Soul assassin, sinner of sins
Everlasting ecstasy
What if this is real?
Proclaimed to stay alive

[solo: Pascal]

The age of murder

Contempt the mutant mystery
Wrath, release this wrath on me
Seek, what no man tries to see
Find: worthless killing spree

Dark prophecies, fictional chaos
Journey of rebellious ghouls
Mutants stare at the voids of darkness

The age of murder, historical fact

Symmetry, a freak of nature
Ignored by the rotten flesh

Killed, thrilled, blood spilled
The price of disaffection when the reaper raids his victim
Rapid rape, ravished rage
The sound of gospel to cover what's been done

The age of murder
