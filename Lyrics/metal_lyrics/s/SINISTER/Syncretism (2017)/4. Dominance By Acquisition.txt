Divine statues
Symbols of the sacraments
The book of insanity
Sanctimonious and virulent

Defile the church
Priestly perdition
Ready for bloodshed
Dominance by acquisition

Slaughter day has arrived
To end all indoctrination
Unbound ambition
For a total eradication

Defile the church
Priestly perdition
Ready for bloodshed
Dominance by acquisition

Destroying all symbols
The rotten holy smell
Break down the pillars
The church will burn in hell

Redemption of the church
And all religious pieces
Mass incineration
Holy ground decreases

Dominance by acquisition
Immense seas of blood
Dominance by acquisition
Burn the ancient ruins
Dominance by acquisition
The unholy aftermath
Dominance by acquisition
Destroy the so called God
