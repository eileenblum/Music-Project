Church smeared with blood
Dripping delectation
The crusade of destiny
A soaked destination

Building on the icon
With church filthy remnants
Dilapidated frames
Creating the penance

Moored to a ruin
In a blood-red sea
Among cadavers of faith
A well-deserved defeat

Exacerbating the war
With the battery of hate
Blood-soaked pieces
The unholy cross of faith

Build on monstrous pieces
In the blood-soaked domain

No land will be holy
When death treads its terrain
Build on monstrous pieces
In the blood-soaked domain

[2x]
Blood-soaked domain [2x]
Dripping remnants of faith
Blood-soaked domain [2x]
Blood dripping crosses of hate

[2x]
No land will be holy
When death treads its terrain
Build on monstrous pieces
In the blood-soaked domain

Church smeared with blood
Dripping delectation
The crusade of destiny
A soaked destination

Building on the icon
With church filthy remnants
Dilapidated frames
Creating the penance
