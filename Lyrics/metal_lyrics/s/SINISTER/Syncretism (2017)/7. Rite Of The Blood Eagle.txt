Sacrifice according the rite
Head nailed to the ground
Ribcage beaten and cracked
Lungs ripped from the wounds

Choking till death follows
The suffering is not enough
The torment gets intensified
Salt treatment peels the skin

Silence must be guaranteed
During flogging of the sinner
Shredded flesh from the body
And sacrifice of the inner

Death flight to Valhalla
Floating on wings of blood
Bird made of human bones
Oppressed by the Upper God

Bird mate of human flesh
The blood eagle awakes
Death flight to the upper terrace
Rite of the eagle plaques

Rite of the blood eagle

The blood eagle awakes
Maimed creature is what is left
Gore mass of carcass remnants
The rite of the afterlife is staffed

Silence must be guaranteed
During flogging of the sinner
Shredded flesh from the body
And sacrifice of the inner

Bird mate of human flesh
The blood eagle awakes
Death flight to the upper terrace
Rite of the eagle plaques

Sacrifice according the rite
Head nailed to the ground
Ribcage beaten and cracked
Lungs ripped from the wounds

Bird mate of human flesh
The blood eagle awakes
Death flight to the upper terrace
Rite of the eagle plaques
