Judgment day
Has come for the leader
After untold whipping
Nails penetrate the bones

Hanging on his cross
Final seconds are there
Thinking about the torture
He gets his kiss of death

Through his cut eyeballs
He sees the red haze
Drowning in blood
Life comes to an end

Blood dripping everywhere
Along the spiny whorl
Bone crushing melodies
From the tortured head

Judgment day
Has come for the leader
After untold whipping
Nails penetrate the bones

Convulsions of Christ
Drowning in blood

Convulsions of Christ
Now the liar is death

The end of a major scam
The start of something new
Stylized craziness
Voiced by rituals and death

Hanging on his cross
Final seconds are there
Thinking about the torture
He gets his kiss of death

Through his cut eyeballs
He sees the red haze
Drowning in blood
Life comes to an end
