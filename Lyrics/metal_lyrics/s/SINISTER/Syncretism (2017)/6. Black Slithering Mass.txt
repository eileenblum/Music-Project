Nocturnal beings
Summoning chaos
Blasphemous laughter
Black slithering mass

Feeble man hiding behind the cross
Praising their savior that once was

Darkness descends upon their very souls, invert the cross.
Annihilate! Thy book of lies will be erased, accept, fate, exterminate!

Dragging out the helpless ones, branding those of sin,
Blasphemous fire raging within

Asphyxiating darkness
Pearly gates of heaven
Embrace damnation
Biblical revelation
Apocalypse salvation
Accept fate exterminate!

Nocturnal beings, summoning chaos
Blasphemous laughter, black slithering mass
