A canonical opinion
The sacrament of death
His work defined
Written in filthy words

The approach of church
Totally deranged
A psychosomatic unity
Of obedient saints

The canonical rights
The canonical rights

Canonical rights
Preserved to death
Canonical rights
They will regret

Canonical rights
The script will fail
Canonical rights
A lucid tale

The realm of fairy tales
Faithful to canonical rights
Abuse of followers
Molesting of clear minds

The approach of church
Totally deranged
A psychosomatic unity
A feast of obedient saints

The canonical rights

Preserved to death

Canonical rights

Canonical rights
A lucid tale

A canonical opinion
