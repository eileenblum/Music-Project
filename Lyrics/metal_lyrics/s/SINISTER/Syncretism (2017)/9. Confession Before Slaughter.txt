In the deep caverns
Underworld of faith
Abusers and molesters
Confidence or hate

Feeding the inmates
Compulsive brains
Pierced by betrayal
Collecting all gains

Abusers and molesters
Confidence or hate

Preaching insanity
The book of death
Concocted fairy tales
Ready to be shred

Before the libricide
They should confess
Their indoctrination
Creating of mass

A signed statement
Confession of lies
Starting the slaughter
Till all faith dies

Confession before slaughter
Caverns of blood
Underworld of death
Confidence of wrath

D-day has arrived
Grabbing the sword
Creating a bloodbath
To end the cause

Confession before slaughter
Confession of lies
Confession before slaughter
A bloody demise

A signed statement
Confession of lies
Starting the slaughter
Till all faith dies

Confession before slaughter
Caverns of blood
Underworld of death
Confidence of wrath

D-day has arrived
Grabbing the sword
Creating a bloodbath
To end the cause
