Drink from the sacred chalice, cursed by the feeble flesh
Take the knife, slit your wrist, let the blood flow freely
Become a vessel, the channeling of chaos, demonic entity reborn in human flesh

Ave, Ave Antichrist
Sanquinem bibimus
Corpus edimus

Drink!
Drink from the sacred chalice, cursed by the feeble flesh
Destined to destroy all in its path
Shunning the light

Drink!
You die and become again
Reborn in blasphemy for eternity
Until all light has faded

Ave domini inferni
No beginning, no end

Unhallowed blood
Nothingness, emptiness

Unhallowed blood
Devoid of life

Unhallowed blood
Demonic entity reborn in human flesh
