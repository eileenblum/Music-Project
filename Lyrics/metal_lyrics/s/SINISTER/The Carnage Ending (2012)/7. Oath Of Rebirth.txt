Cross of the wicked
Victimized by cruelty
Death or disease
Renewable for Satan

Born in fear
Captured by hate
In Hell they come
To enjoy and suffer

First time death
Reincarnation
Oath of disbelief
Oath of rebirth

Penance by pain
The second coming
Rearrange life
Damage by God

Oath of rebirth
Born in fear
Penance by pain
Sober sphere
