Bodies - rotten - carnal

Beaten on command
Succumbed under pressure
Pile of limbs
Assumed dead

A visceral mass
Organs shredded
Lifeless objects
The carnage revealed

The weight of death
Immense decay
A brutal stench
The burden of a massacre

Cauterized bodies
Total annihilation
Millions of dead
The work completed

Bodies - beaten on command
Rotten - a visceral mass
Carnal - the weight of the dead
Carnage - cauterized bodies

The carnage ending
The carnage ending
The carnage ending
The carnage ending
