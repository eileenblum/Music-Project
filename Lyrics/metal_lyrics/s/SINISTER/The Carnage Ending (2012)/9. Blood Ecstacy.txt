A war between tribes
In a world far beyond
Where only death dwells
And fire reigns

The ultimate predators
Fight a bloody battle
One with wings, one with claws
In a unheavenly domain

Blood ecstacy
Blood ecstacy

A slaughter without weapons
Killing with strength
Bodies marked with scars
A complete massacre

Beast against beast
There will be no victory
In this eternal oppression
Only hope of surviving
So never lose

The axe will swing
The sword will slay
The knife will stab
The blood will flow
