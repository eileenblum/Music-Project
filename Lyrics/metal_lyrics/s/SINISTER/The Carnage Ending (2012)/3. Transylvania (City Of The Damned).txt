A place surrounded by darkness
Damned with plagues and fear
Streets flooded with chaos
Created by the creatures with wings

The swarm falls into the deep
A herd of damnation ready to feed
Veins boiling for blood
Mighty teeth piercing the flesh

Prepare to unleash new life
Showing to God he is not the only one
Slimy cocoons filled with hate
Waiting for the sign of their master

A one man army
Sent as the left hand of God
With special weapons to kill
The redeemer of the weak

The first day of your death
Fighting a hopeless battle
Against the new breed of sickness
A force of the underworld

Thinking how to end this war
Surrender to the teeth of madness
To become the demon
You hunted with passion
