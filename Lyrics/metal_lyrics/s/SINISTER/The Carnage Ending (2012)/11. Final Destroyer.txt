From the ashes of depraved skulls
The common smell is intoxicating
Dark clouds form the mortuary
Dungeons of dead are illuminating

Under pressure of vengeance
The frontier is far beyond imagination
Believers have fallen down
As part of the Devil's creation

Funeral of the conversed is arranged
A casket full of rotten lies
Buried six feet under
Or cremated after demise

Final destroyer - the crusade of death
Final destroyer - lies from their head
Final destroyer - the unworthy breed
Final destroyer - let the unknown breed

Finally the curse of holy salvation
Is broken down by the last ride
He wields his scythe of death
Blessed with his immense pride
