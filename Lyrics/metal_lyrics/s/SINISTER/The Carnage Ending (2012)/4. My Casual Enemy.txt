Abstraction of the mind
The way to survive
Enemy of your god
Murder among the wicked

Forlorn and avoided
The sickness from within
Through a dark journey
The inner conscious is found

Evil has no complaints
Incubated for a reason
To object the filthy mind
Filled with hate and prayers

Penetrated to the core
The mastermind has delivered
The one which I never met
My casual enemy

My casual enemy
Uses pain for a trial

My casual enemy
The motion of denial

My casual enemy
Faith is a felony

My casual enemy
The flesh which I'll never be
