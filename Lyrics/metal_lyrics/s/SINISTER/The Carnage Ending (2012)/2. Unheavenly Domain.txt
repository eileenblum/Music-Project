Daylight disappears
Behind venomous clouds
A landscape so spooky
And silent like death

Battalions standing in line
For a quest of no return
Armed with weapons
With no mercy in their hearts

Unheavenly domain
Where death dwells
Unheavenly domain

Marching forward
To the field of madness
Obey to your commander
The slaughter can begin

Legions are facing
No time to bleed
Kill in the name of your saviour
Kill in the name of your God

The smell of defeated flesh
Floats over the battlefield
Skeletons in open graves
Marked with no names

Useless relics
Are eaten by vultures
No memories will remain
Of this massive killing
