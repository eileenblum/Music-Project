Regarding the imagery
I declare war
To abusers and molesters
Their soul will burn

regarding the holies
The circus of faith
Their vulgar images
Of death and pleasure

Regarding the imagery
Decapitated bodies
Artillery against the saints

Sick-making imagery
Of child abusers
Results of celibacy
Thy father will be condemned

Their conspiracy will end
Torture their skull
Beyond recognition
Burning flesh of the holy father
