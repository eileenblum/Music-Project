Restricted manners, blinded by the truth
Symbol of salvation, the god of emptiness
Acts of desire, a shallow grave called life
Rebels of the wicked prepared to face the lie

Moralistic suffering
Moralistic afflicted by the sins of war

Moralistic suffering, i am the written pain
Moralistic suffering, despise thy soul

Future wars, collected by the past
A frenzied rape and cold blooded murder
Substance of terror, killed by acceptation
Rebels of the wicked prepared to face the lie

Moralistic suffering, i search the wings of death
Moralistic suffering, i am the risen pain

Prepare to face and lie

Restricted manners, blinded by the truth
Symbol of salvation, the god of emptiness
Acts of desire, a shallow grave called life
Rebels of the wicked prepared to face the lie

Moralistic suffering
Moralistic suffering
Afflicted by the sins of war
