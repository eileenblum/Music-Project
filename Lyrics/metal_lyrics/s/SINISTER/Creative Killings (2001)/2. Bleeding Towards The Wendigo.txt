Summon the myth of a reckless world
The beast is slaughtered by the hands of sickness
Question the myth and the ancient summoning
A disgusting sight, this diabolic ritual

Bleeding Towards The Wendigo
Carnage Dreadful and forgotten

Bastard of history, the pistol pray
Hanged on the gallows free, transfixed by fear
Warned by the tribe, a useless try
Escape to victory or wait and die

Question the myth and the ancient summoning
A disgusting sight, this diabolic ritual

Dismembered by a primitive myth
Lost souls, conquered and warned
Territory settled, trespass and be consumed
