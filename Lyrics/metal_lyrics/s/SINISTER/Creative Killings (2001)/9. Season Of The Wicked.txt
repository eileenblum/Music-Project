Selected by a secret cult
Judged and approved, opinion given
Reasonable ricks, superior pain
Praise this cult and reverse the cross

Crown of charm, passage of lies
Church of fools, gluttony rules
Eternal gospel, grace demise
Is this the way to die?

Season of the wicked

While the fog is clearing, and the goblin reigns
Death embraces me like a vicious king
Unreasonable risks and terrible pains
Unleash this cult, while the goblin reigns

Season of the wicked
Season of the wicked

Am i a cruel survivor
Homicidal maniac
Hear the call of descending demons
And the roar of the infinite wrath
Unreasonable risks and terrible pains
Death embraces me, forever the goblin reigns

Crown of charm, passage of lies
Church of fools, gluttony rules
Eternal gospel, grace demise
Is this the way to die?

Season of the wicked
