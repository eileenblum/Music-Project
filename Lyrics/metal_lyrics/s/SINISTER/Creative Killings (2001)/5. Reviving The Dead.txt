Deep inside a malignant world
A fight is starting to merge
Two symbols, two nations
Divided yet they are one!
Balanced between fear and
Pride, a quest for flesh

I've seen it all
Genocide and chaos
Aggressive impact
Tools of separation

I've seen it all
The falcon of desire
Ethnic horror
Tools of separation

Reviving the dead
Confined by virtue

This pain is haunting me
Nightmares are hunting me
This is no way of life
I can't sustain this hell
One symbol, one nation
Opressed yet they are one!
Balancing between hope
And despair, lack of reality

I've seen it all
Genocide and chaos
Aggressive impact
Tools of separation

I've seen it all
The falcon of desire
Ethnic horror
Tools of separation

Reviving the dead
Confined by virtue
Reviving the dead

This pain is haunting me
Nightmares are hunting me
This is no way of life
Opressedâ¦yet they are one!

Ethnic horror
Tools of separation
Reviving the dead

Reviving the dead
Reviving the dead
