I've seen the blackest decade
In human's history
Apocalyptic sights
Dark anguish revealed
In the dawn of time
Symbolic execution
Witness the brutality
Of a changing world
Divided we fall!

This hunger is craven
Death of the innocent
Designed and formed by a madman
Painless is the gothic wrath

Call of the raven
Ravished bodies
Fled as a craven
By the sword of wrath

I'm the horror
External torment
Desolated crime
Early gothic horror

I'm the hunger
Internal rabid
Desolated crime
Early gothic horror

Changing world
Evolved through the tide,
The tide of time
Struggle, the carnage is complete

I've seen the blackest decade, seen
Through the eyes of the present
Released by the burden of lust
Provocation of the flesh
Independent and proud
I walk the path of doom
The carnage is complete
I've seen the blackest decade
Released by the burned of lust
As i open the wound

This hunger is craven
Death of the innocent
Designed and formed by a madman
Painless is the gothic wrath

Call of the raven
Ravished bodies
Fled as a craven
By the sword of wrath
