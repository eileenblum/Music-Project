[1]
Wreaking havoc and destruction
Swarms of these foul beasts
The light of the cross
A portal of faith

[2]
Steered by their master
Fulfillment of gods will
These wretched souls now reside in the depths of hell

[3]
The fulfillment of gods will
Suffers in the dark abyss of woe
Once living humans
In oblivion they dwell

[Repeat 2]

[4]
Like an everflowing dream
Contained with a wrongful death it seems
Sensual vices she was given to lust
Infamous, not much left to trust

[5]
The eternal fire of anger
Besieged by the condemned
Drenched in the blood of man
Denying life after death

[Repeat 3]
[Repeat 2]
