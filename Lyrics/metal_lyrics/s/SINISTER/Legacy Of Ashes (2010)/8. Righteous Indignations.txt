Destined to face the ominous specter of death
Harvester of souls severs the tie that binds body and spirit
Punishment of the damned

Judged for their grievous suns
Culmination in a surge of fury
Unbaptized children drowned in the river Styx
Punishment of the damned
Righteous indignation
Punishment of the damned
Righteous indignation
Punishment of the damned

Assessing damage done
Their bodies fused and worn
Inside they lay within
A path of unforgiven sins

Blotting out the sky
These fiends are forged from fire
Violence again the cross
Contain their devious lust
Their anger burns so hot
Full of mud and filth
Once pacified, tangled in the web of lies

Assessing damage done
Their bodies fused and worn
Inside they lay within
A path of unforgiven sins

Destined to face the ominous specter of death
Harvester of souls severs the tie that binds body and spirit
Punishment of the damned
