[1]
The sin of sodomy within the seventh circle
Her hapless wretched soul torn apart
Circle of heresy, a thirst for war
Now left for dead to be consumed

[2]
Screaming ancient incantations
Mindless creatures serve as beast for war
Religious signs and deformation
Now left for dead to beÂ consumed

[3]
Tamed by the fallen
The ruling class of hell
Relentlessness of a starving hound
Circle of heresy, a thirst for war
Now left for dead to be consumed

[Repeat 2]

[4]
Into the blind world with a bloody revolt
Charlatan of desecration, bow for me you whore

[5]
Into the blind world
Death is all I see
Into the blind world
Death is all I see

[6]
Stabbing and killing
In greater numbers they will come
Destined to face the ominous specter of death
Begging and raping
Unholy sins of the darkened path
Bow for your master, eternal flame of fire

[7]
Into the blind world
Death is all I see
With common blindness comes this great mystery
Their frail bodies are left behind
Contain this intolerable rage
A part of this dying kind

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]
