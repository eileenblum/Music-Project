[1]
The sin of sodomy
Imprisoned and ruined
Defend the honor of his master
The seventh circle
Now stricken and broke
Indulging in the pleasures of both

[2]
The sin of sodomy
A righteous lobotomy
The sin of sodomy
Now stricken and broke

[3]
Enveloped in the tumultuous winds of lust
Soul filled with grime and smut
A repulsive trail of rot in her wake
Vestal virgin, no doubts whoÂs soul to take

[Repeat 2]

[4]
The wrath of god
Wrongful death it seems
No matter if it is wrong or real

[5]
What is forgotten?
What will return?
Is this the path of endlessness

[Repeat 2]

[6]
The sin of sodomy
