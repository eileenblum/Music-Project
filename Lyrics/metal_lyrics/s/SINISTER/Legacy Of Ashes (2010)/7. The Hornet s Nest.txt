Trial of jesus acts of disbelief Menacing madness crowned to a king of thievesAs blood runs with mercy, all hope is lostGrand finaleÂcrucified to the cross Splitting and paringInnocence is lostMutually exclusive confined to the swordRaising the infants, the demon still awaitsThe burden of mankindÂinfiniteÂfull of hate The Christian soul seeing sin for what it isFake ideas and tribulationThe demon still awaits The hornets nestThe hornets nest Being exiled from the council of godsVisions of the afterlifeIn secrecy they are sworn  The hornets nestThe hornets nest
