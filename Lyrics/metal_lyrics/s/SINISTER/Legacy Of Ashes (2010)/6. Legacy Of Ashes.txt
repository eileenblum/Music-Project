Denounced as a heretic for his atheists beliefs
Scourge of the earth, emperor of the Huns

Drenched in the blood of man
Defend the honor of his master
Different crimes of flattery
No tenderness just butchery

Legacy of Ashes
Legacy of Ashes

The third choir of fallen angels
They keep haunting me
Different crimes of flattery 
The beast is still inside of me

Legacy of Ashes
Legacy of Ashes
Legacy of Ashes
Legacy of Ashes

No soul may pass without confronting the beast
These bloated miscreants on their blood I feast

Drenched in the blood of man
Defend the honor of his master
Different crimes of flattery
No tenderness just butchery

Legacy of Ashes
