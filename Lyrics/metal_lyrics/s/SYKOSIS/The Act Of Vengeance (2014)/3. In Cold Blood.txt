Bow down
I'm up from a low
I never thought that this would be real

I can smell your fear
And I
Can smell your dirty ass from here
Rape me and eat me alive
Mind fucked and don't care if you are dead or alive
I never cared
I'll ruck you too
I never thought I'd kill
These memories of you

I can smell your filth
And I
Can smell your dirty ass from here

Bow down
I'm up from a low
I never thought that this would be real

I can smell your fear
And I
Can smell your dirty ass from here
Rape me and eat me alive
Mind fucked and don't care if you are dead or alive
I never cared
I'll ruck you too
I never thought I'd kill
These memories of you, of you, of you, of you
These memories of you

I can smell your fear
And I
Can smell your dirty ass from here
Rape me and eat me alive
Mind fucked and don't care if you are dead or alive
I never cared
I'll ruck you too
I never thought I'd kill these memories of you
I never thought I'd kill these memories of you
