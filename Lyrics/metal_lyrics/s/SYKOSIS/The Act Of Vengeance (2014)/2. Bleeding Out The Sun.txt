Push
Look me in my eyes
Transformed from what I used to be

I look in the mirror
It looks nothing like me
I can't stand this feeling
When I look right at you
I see the death in your eyes

I'm bleeding out the sun
The sun don't lie
Bleeding out these memories of what I've become

Bleeding out the sun
The sun don't lie
Bleeding out these memories of what I had
I wash away these memories I have of you
With these razorblades
Have I come unglued
You are nothing but a punishment
Of what I use to be

I look in the mirror
It looks right back at me
It looks nothing, nothing like me

I see the death in your eyes
Transformed from what I used to be

Push
Look me in my eyes
Push
Look me in my eyes
