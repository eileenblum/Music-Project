Bleeding hearts and crying eyes
You filthy bitch
I'm sick of your lies
I can't stand what you've put me through
Now I follow your every move

You won't even know that I'm there
And won't even know that I care
You'll be pleading for your last breath
As my face will be the last vision

You
You are a liar
I
I will gain from the pain
When it all fades away
You will burn another day
But at least we tried

I can't help myself
I will follow you to the end
I can't help myself
Will you follow me to the end?

How can you say you love
When I can smell your filth

Bleeding hearts and crying eyes
You filthy bitch
I'm sick of your lies
I can't stand what you've put me through
Now I follow your every move

You won't even know that I'm there
And won't even know that I care
You'll be pleading for your last breath
As my face will be the last vision

You
You are a liar
I
I will gain from the pain
When it all fades away
You will burn another day
But at least we tried

Bleeding hearts and crying eyes
You filthy bitch
I'm sick of your lies
