Oh
It was so nice to meet you
Will you spread them legs there for me
I wanna see
What you have there waiting for me
I don't care

I stand here with a grin
Your blood on my face
I can no longer wait here
'Cause I don't care

It all fades away
Nobody cares
I'm locked inside my mind
I'm running out of air
They can't hear you scream
They won't hear you cry
The only thing that you know you're about to

Oh
It was so nice to meet you
Will you spread them legs there for me
I wanna see
What you have there waiting for me
I don't care

It all fades away
Nobody cares
I'm locked inside my mind
I'm running out of air
They can't hear you scream
They won't hear you cry
The only thing that you know you're about to die

Why can't you see what we have done
The bloodstains on the wall tell the story.
