Move
This sacrifice
Determination
Alienation
Domination
Dedication
Intimidation
Sacrifice
This sacrifice I live alone
Loneliness I call a home
The strength I find
I make it my own

I fight
For my life
I fight
For my life

Standing there with integrity
Intimidation
Sitting there eye to eye
Ready to throw down
We'll be friends in the morning
The respect we both earn and gain from each other
Throw down
The sacrifice
Determination
Alienation
Dedication
Equals integradation
I will win
I will fall
I will live
I won't fold

I'll fight
For my live
I'll fight
For my live
