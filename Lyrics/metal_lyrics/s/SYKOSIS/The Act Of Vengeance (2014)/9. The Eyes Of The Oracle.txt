Locked in a world that we can never understand
There's no way out of here
I will lose it all to have you under control
Lost and powerless
As is sit here feeding off your neglect
I profit from your lost souls
Bow down
Before the one above you
I'm here to beat you and to control
This will always be a memory
You will always be a memory
I will always be a memory
I live on the thrill
The hatred
The light
The power
It keep me burning inside

Bring me the eyes of the oracle
I wanna see you suffer in hell

You have been released from this hell that I have put you through
Find my way out of here
1,000 years for all your tears
Sounds like a deal to me
Where is the escape
As I sit here
You are free from living in my memory
Now you are lost and powerless

Bring me the eyes of the oracle
I wanna see you suffer in hell
