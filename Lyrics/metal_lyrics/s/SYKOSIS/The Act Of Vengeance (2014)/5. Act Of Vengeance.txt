I'll dig you up
So I can kill you again

You said it's unconditional
My life revolves around you
Why can't you see what you've done
Our lives have just begun

Living in this madness got to me
I'm sick of living in fear
What will we do with ourselves?

Now our lives are the truth
Wipe out everything you know
I am the tyrant in control

Wipe out everything you know
This is a goddamn warzone

Breathe in this hate
You have been exposed to
I will take you

We have you in control
Your life now isn't worth living for

You said it's unconditional
My life revolves around you

Dig you up just to kill you again
This is my revenge
I'll light you up
Just to watch the flames
I wanna see you burn

Your lies have all got to me
I just want the truth

Breathe in this hate
You have been exposed to
We have you in control
Your life now will be worth living for

Reach for the sky
Reach
Reach for the sky
Reach
We
We are the victims
Of this system
That has lost all control of
Me and you
They no longer tell us
What to do with life
With life
