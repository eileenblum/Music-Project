Keep running your mouth
You better stop
Yeah, I can't stand you anyway
It's take everything I got
Not to knock your lights out
You step to me
You better bring a game to play
The pain in hand
It won't go away
Keep standing there talking your shit
All's you have to do is commit

This might be
This might be
The end of the line
And I saw your eyes
Filled with tears and lies

And I saw your eyes
Full of fear and surprise

This might be
This might be
The end of the line
And I saw your eyes
Filled with tears and lies

This is no longer your kingdom
This is no longer your kingdom
