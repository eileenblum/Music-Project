Left out here in the cold
Nowhere to call my home
I lost everything, everything

The I â I found you
My mind's racing
Going nowhere
Feels like I'm barely alive

I love everything about you
But sometimes I can't stand you

This will be the end of me
If you leave
This will be the end of me
'Cause I remember you
Will you remember me?
Was it all a dream?

I locked in these memories I cannot escape
These lies will be the death of me

I love everything about you
But sometimes I can't stand you

Why do you look at me with all this hate?
I plead to you this love will stay

I love everything about you
But sometimes I can't stand you

This will be the end of me
If you leave
This will be the end of me
'Cause I remember you
Will you remember me?
Was it all a dream?
