Now your nightmare becomes
As real as it gets
You judge and don't know
Shit
And talking about

You scream and you shout
What's your problem
'Til now your nightmare becomes

It's all in my head
You judge and don't know shit
Ready to drop the bomb

I can't hear you
Ready to drop the bomb
Are you ready
Ready to drop the bomb
I can't hear you
Ready to drop the bomb

Now your life will fade away
Your life will fade away
You better get inside
Now this blood has been shed
This death is so real
Is this the end?

What
What have I done?
This is all because of you
Or is it in my head?
