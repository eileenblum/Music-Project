This is the life we chose
Your life is unaware
My life is ending now
I can't stand you
When push is coming to shove

My life is over anyway
I can't stand you anyway
I'm burning now
You are the ones whose leaving

This is the life we chose
I am the one who's bleeding
This is the life we chose
This is the life we chose

Your life is unaware
My life is ending now
I can't stand you
When push is coming to shove

Your life is unaware
This pain you gave to me
I can't let it out
Overcome my past
Overcome
This pain

Overcome my past
Overcome my pain
Deja vu
