You may have a smile now
But it will be mine in the end
The day you came to me
My system shut down

This world will never know
How much you killed me
Somehow I pushed through it all
Without
Without you

You no longer control me
Liar
I will live the life of a free man
Your voice is haunting me
Your face is all I see
I can't take this anymore
You
You left me here to die
On my own
You left me here to die
All alone

Waiting here
Sitting here alone
This voice is haunting me
Why won't it let me be?
Good thing I found you
Before it killed me

Now look what we've become
And look what you've done
My mind is not alone
There is no control
Realize it's ending

Pick up the pieces
And move on
Well how can this world be so cruel
To let me lose someone like you
Everything's different but stays the same
I can't live in this world without you
Without you
The light remains on
'Til you bring me back home
