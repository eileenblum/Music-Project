Looking through the eyes of a mad man tonight
As a dead man walks in the room
The killer's here

Where are we going
Where are you going
I can take it from here

The eyes of madman ride tonight
The ghost of a killer
Decides tonight

Killing the innocent now
You will die
As I look into your cold dead eyes

Your soul has left its temple
Now it's mine
Breeding the filth
Killing the wise
We dine on the blood of the suicide tonight

Did anybody see that?
How did we get here
Where are you going
No one get out of here alive

The ghost of a killer
There's no hiding tonight
Where are you going
There's no place to hide

Breeding the filth
Killing the wise
We dine on the blood of the suicide tonight
The ghost of a killer decides tonight
