Screaming, crying, laughing, dying
We are not animals
Why can't you see
What you've just done

Your life has just begun
Trade you for this blanket of diseases
For this life that you've mistreated
They're lining up as fast as they fall

We're killing the wise
You better not run
The white man has come
To take our land

Creeping and crawling and pushing and fighting
Trying to save our land
I'll die for everything that you see
For the blue skied and the land
You killed so carelessly

Payback's a bitch motherfucker
Hate this life we life is rented
The sky is our mother
The earth is our father
One day she's gonna take it all back

We ruin this life with pollution and genetic modification
And one day she's gonna take it all back

Screaming and crying, laughing and dying
We'll rise to fall
This is life
It will never be the same
