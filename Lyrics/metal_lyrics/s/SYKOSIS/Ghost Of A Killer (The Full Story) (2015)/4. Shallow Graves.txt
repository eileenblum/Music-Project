Caught in a world that never gave a shit about
Me and you
This life goes on inside my mind
Your death

It all becomes inside my head
Your pain
I cannot be there for you
If you aren't dead

My twisted mind ends with you in a shallow grave
When your caught in a world with a twisted imagination and mind

You don't know what's up
You don't know what's down
You just live your life living your living to die

How could you betray me
You were never this way until you met me
You'll never see what this is about

How can you be shallow
Why can't you see
Shallow
Caught in a world that never gave a shit about
Me or you
This life goes on inside my mind
This death becomes so real inside my eyes
This pain
How can I be there for you
If you aren't dead?
