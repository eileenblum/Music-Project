This knife is twisting turning
Into my back and spine
You are
You are
You are no friend of mine

You push I pull
Bleed it slow
Bleed it slow and cold
Why can't you see you're killing me
This part of me has died slowly

Why can't you see it's killing me
Why can't you see this died in me

I've killed before
And I'll do it again
Don't patronize me
You came to me
What am I doing here

You came to me
I came to you
What am I doing here
Let me kill you
You are the one who walked away
I am the one who's here to stay

Why'd you leave me
Why'd you leave
I hope you see me
In my dreams
