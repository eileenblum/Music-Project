The execution went wrong
Nobody's dead
They're looking for you
They're looking for me

They'll chop off our heads
Now everything's fucked
No one is safe
They're pointing at me
And looking at you
But never see

I, I'll kill you
I, I will survive
'Cause I watched you run away from my help

And now I will never know
I'm never gonna let this go
Let it go

I can feel them watching
I can hear them breathing
I can feel them coming

Come take me away
'Cause I know that you will always be
Right there
The one that's deep in my heart
And I know you will never go

You will be here
You will be next to me
'Cause I know one thing you will never be
The one, the person
I need in my life

And that's fine
'Cause I don't really mind
It comes from the hatred that's burning ins

As you set me free
As you set me free
What is wrong with me
'Cause I know that you will never be
The one
The person I need in my life
And that's fine
'Cause I don't really mind
It comes from the hatred that burns deep inside
