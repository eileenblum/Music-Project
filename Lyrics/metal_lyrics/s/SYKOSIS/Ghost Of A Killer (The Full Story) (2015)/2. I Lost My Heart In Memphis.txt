What the fuck was I thinking
Burned out by the candlelight
Screaming with the fear of fright
Bleeding
No this isn't right
Where'd I go wrong
Why can't I see
What's come over me

As I clear the way
Lined up before me
Watch what you say
I'm an animal
How can you be right before my face
Why can't you see
Never be replaced

Why can't you be all that's really there
Why can't you see

Who you really are

Hatred towards humanity
Let me see all all I'll be
I believer never see

Lost my heart in Memphis Tennessee
What you mean
Look at me
Hate me
Judge me
Every time I see something
I believer and never see the pain
And never see the way
And every time you ask yourself
Would you do or die

Never see the time
Never see the time fly
Lost my mind
Never to be found
All I see is all I found

Went to the crossroads
All I found was a little bit of dirt in a small ass town

Lost my mind
Never to be found
And the pain is hard to swallow
Lost my mind
Never to be found
All I see is all I found

Everybody thinks of suicide
And everybody wonders what it's all about to die
Hatred towards humanity
Life loss is a gift to a demigod
And the pain is hard to swallow
I'm gonna kill you
Bury me
Burn it down
