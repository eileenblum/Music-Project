Filter to open my eyes
Realize my own demise
Set aside and watch the tide
Wash away this burning world
It's killing you
But it's killing me

Was long ago
Never seen what you believe
Your heart is bleeding
I don't want it anymore

Killing me
It's killing you
Fight fight fight

Every time you put me down
I'll fight fight fight
Every time you knock me down
I'll fight fight fight

I cut the rope and ties we had
With the knife you stabbed me in the back with
So you can wrap that thing around you neck
And just go
And just go

Use your imagination
The eyes are the window to you mind
So open your eyes and see the light
Right fucking now

I hate this pain
You'll never see and never believe in me
You'll say
You'll never see and never believe in me
Fuck you
