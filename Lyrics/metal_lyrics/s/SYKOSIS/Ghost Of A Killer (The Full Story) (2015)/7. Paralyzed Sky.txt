Realize your paralyzed skies inside my mind
We will never know
These scars will never hide
Inside my mind for those 12 days
As you stay

You just stayed away
Never know what you meant to me
And never see the pain
We will never know

And never see this side of me
I hope you found someone who is better
And I hope
I hope he really cares
'Cause I'm sorry that it didn't work out
But I want you to know
That I
I loved you more than you will ever know

I loved you more than you
And I found someone else who's better
I found someone who really cares

I don't want it anymore
You can take this heart with you
Why do I wanna know
What a horrible person you ended up to be

I don't love you more
That you will know
I don't want it anymore
You can take my heart with you
Rip this flesh right from me
I have died inside because of you
