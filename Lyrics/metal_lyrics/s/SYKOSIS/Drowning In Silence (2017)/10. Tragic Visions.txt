I sense that something is wrong
Tragic visions deep inside my thoughts
I don't belong
I felt all alone
All along
It's crashing to an empty hault
Something tells me it's my fault
Something tells me it's my fault
Something is wrong
It's crashing to an empty hault
Tragic visions
All alone
All along

She looked me in my eyes
Said I don't wanna die
There's not enough time
I wish she was still alive

You can take away all the pain
But it will never cure me
This light is blinding
That haunts me
It's deafening
There's no one left to blame
When it's all the same
Reflections left in shame
Bearing through these tears
After all these years
You disappeared
All that's left is the stench of fear
This is not the way it has to be
I'm not your hated enemy
You'll never get the best of me
I think not

She looked me in my eyes
Said I don't wanna die
There's not enough time
I wish she was still alive

She looked me in my eyes
Said I don't wanna die
I was left in confusion
Repeated by these memories that use me
And I can't seem to stop this abuse
It's taken its toll on my body
She's still here
I've escaped this fear
And after all these years
There's no more lies to adhere
And I know I will fall
From time to time
And I know I will fall in my own
She's still here
I've escaped this fear
