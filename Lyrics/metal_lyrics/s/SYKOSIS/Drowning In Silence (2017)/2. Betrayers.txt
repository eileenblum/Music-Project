The face of which you see portrayed to be your friend
You'd be rather disturbed by the skeletons hiding in their closet
Welcomed with open arms we treat them like our own
They scavenge through our homes the second our backs are turned

Follow me into the dark
Never be heard again whispers are the same thing you tell your friends

I'm lost and I've turned to stone
Can you see me
I've escaped from the unknown
But I'm still breathing
You turned your back
Now I'm all alone
Can you hear me
We've come to our crossroads
'Cause you betrayed me

Every grin hiding behind a false set of teeth slithering through the grass
You're the snake searching for its next attack
The cries behind your lies like hands around my neck
The deepest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers just like you

Remove the scales from your eyes
Imagine life if you were blind
Every liar has his day
Tonight it's your demise
Follow me into the dark
Never be heard again whispers are the same thing you tell your friends
