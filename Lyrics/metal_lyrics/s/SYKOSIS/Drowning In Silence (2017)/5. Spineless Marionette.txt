Apocalyptic now
See the world through my eyes
Abomination
The devil in disguised

Cry for abortion
What's one more life an epidemic
'Til souls reach the sky
You're reaching for salvation
Behind this cult of creation
Placed coins upon their eyes
A burning river of lies
Chosen to fight against our own rights
Fill in the blank
Your ballots been bast tranquilized
They're forgotten
An M16, WMD
Clinging flesh of my machete
You're the parasite
Magnified by the sunlight
One sting and you'll parish
But only one of us dies.

Darken my eyes to escape the light
A reflection of remorse as leaders rejoice
Gather around the table
They'll decide your fate
Another soldier has fallen
Another ally replaced.

Born into war but not by choice
Capture the enemy then take their life
Abuse of this powder can't contain this power
Now we are the enemy
We hope to destroy.

Show no hear
Your god is here
Everyone will have healthcare
But you can't have it for free
You must pay the penalty
Land of the free
Home of the slaves
Follow in suit
You will obey
Just pretend that you are safe
March them straight into their graves
And you're worthless
And you're spineless
Don't you think that we've had enough
And you're senseless
A pile of shit

I think that your time is up
You're all the same
And it's such a shame
I'm not a pawn in your mindless game
Deceive the nation
Fill the syringe
One more time
Shot of adrenaline
Your pupils double in size
Control the public
They tell you what's wrong or right
Laced with a lethal dose
Another loved one has died
They strip us of our prise
While they take away our rights
If they are an addict
You're their addiction
Sedation will save you
It's the new American dream
Zombify the public and silence their screams
Another year gone to waste
A new population of disgrace twiddling their thumbs
While their brains grow numb
Can't seem to remember
All they do is forget hiding behind their keyboards
With no self-respect
Even if we build a wall
Rig the election
You won't notice at all
A generation of mindless mutes
Spill their blood
Conceal the truth
Force-fed the forbidden fruit
Stem cell behind doors when the doctors in town
So open your mouth
You'll swallow then down
Now be a good by
Obedient, chained to the ground
It's man against man in the animal kingdoms
No time for remorse
Grab your weapon of choice
Believe he died for our sins like make believe
Then rose once again
A fable of guidelines used to take control
A spineless marionette
A new world order
