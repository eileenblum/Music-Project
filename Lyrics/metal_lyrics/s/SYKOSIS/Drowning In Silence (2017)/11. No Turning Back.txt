You turned your back
And once again you abandoned me
Through all the trauma
The hurt gets the best of me

I believed your lies and thought you were my everything
Just like suicide I was blind
You tied the rope for me
I bleed a dream for the day
Where you would disappear
Just let me go
Let me be
Please just set me free

You're all I have
But I can't take this anymore
There's no turning back
Just like before

I can't believe that this was all a dream
My eyes will always burn
And I can't believe that nothing's what it seems
My eyes will always fucking burn

I can't believe that this was all a dream
My eyes will always burn
And I can't believe that nothing's what it seems
My eyes will always fucking burn

You left your mark on everything
And said you'd never leave your little fables
They always stole the breath from me
You tried to hide and connive
And always said you'd be right by my side
Your promises conceive the death of me
Just like suicide I was blind
You tied the rope for me
I bleed a dream for the day
Where I can honestly just let her her go
Let her be and just set her free
This is the end

There's no turning back
On all our misery

I can't believe that this was all a dream
My eyes will always burn
And I can't believe that nothing's what it seems
My eyes will always fucking burn

I can't believe that this was all a dream
My eyes will always burn
And I can't believe that nothing's what it seems
My eyes will always fucking burn

My eyes will always burn
My eyes will always fucking burn

I can't believe that this was all a dream
My eyes will always burn
And I can't believe that nothing's what it seems
My eyes will always fucking burn

I can't believe that this was all a dream
My eyes will always burn
And I can't believe that nothing's what it seems
My eyes will always fucking burn
