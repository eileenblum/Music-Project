And there was peace
So that makes you rather understand it
You're missing the point
Misleaded
Has you misdirected
Got it comprehension
You're understanding that a misdirection in your voice
And it leads to a choice
That you can't hide no longer

Reasons you try and love
Your reasons as the loved ones start to say goodbye
Your voice is trying but you'll lose your mind
But you'll never be coming our alive

You complete all these lucid
Keep on comprehending
You're second-guessing yourself over again.

Why'd you have to go?
This pain is all too real
You died way too young
Can you tell me how to feel?

So can you tell how to feel
When I feel everything inside
It's like these demons
Oh, they're hiding as they push right in my mind
To see the things I don't want to see
But I can never believe
I can't erase
I can't complain
But I can't understanding
It's like everything inside has grown apart
And for a moment
When I'm starting to get it right
It's like it's taken away right from the start
And I never had a chance from the beginning

Why'd you have to go?
This pain is all too real
You died way too young
Can you tell me how to feel?

Can you tell me how to feel
When I have lost everyone I care about
You helped me leave
When I say there's nothing that we can't believe, break.

I can only take so much of this
How many more will I commit
I can only take so much of this
How many more will I have
Will I only have to miss you?

Why'd you have to go?
This pain is all too real
You died way too young
Can you tell me how to feel?

Why'd you have to go?
You died way too young
Can you tell me how to feel?
