I hate you and everything about you
I hate you and everything that make you you
Do like it when others lie to you?
Do you do it to feel alive?
Does the game get you off?
Have you lost who you are?
Would you crate another lie
While I was under the knife?
Are we still here?
Can you convince me to believe anything
Are we alive?
Please, don't call me anymore
I just want to be alone
Why can't you just go away
And take the pain that you make, make?
I just want you to go away
I don't want to care
I wish you were never there
Just take me back in time
Moving inside my mind
Can I erase you with the black from a gun
Will the bullet be enough to silence my tongue
Are we still here
I've take all that I could give
Are we alive
She smiles
She sings
She beings the worst out in me
Your spirit drifts away
How can you be so sure?
When all there is is questions haunting at he core
A better life you crave
Well, mine is filled with hell
You're poison to my health
The venom doesn't sting
I know that I could leave
But I kind of like it here
The hell that I've endured
What can you put me through?
The truth is its useless believing
Something is there
I'm not saying
I'm pretending I'm saying
I don't care
Take this all of me
Left this odyssey
End this tragedy
Escape misery foreshadowing my dreams
I am forced to relive them over
This is all
Let them be
Overcome over me
Get away
This is life and you cannot handle everything
That you have been through
Let this place just burn as the palace turns
Nobody's right
You're thinking why
This is life and you cannot handle everything
That happens out of nowhere
You have got a lesson to learn
It's your choice
I wish you the worst
