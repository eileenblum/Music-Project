It's been ten years
And I'll never forget the sound of the gun fire
The bullets flying by my head
When I wake up at night
I'm dripping in sweat reliving the day the ground tore through my flesh
The countless sleepless nights
Crying in my bed
I should've done this or I could've done that
But nothing can bring them back
I don't see things the same anymore
I'm a different person now than I was before the war

Why am I still here?
Just tell me
Just tell me why?
Noe everything that I've been through
Whey did I make it our
And why did the others lose to live this life
This life I love is full of drugs and pain
Why can't I seem to get out of this place
Is this really it
I cannot believe this is why
All the sex, the money, the drugs and the fame
Please tell me this is not why I'm alive
Oh god
Now I look up into the sky
I am the one that has to deal with the thoughts and the dreams
At least you could do is tell my why.

This is killing me on the inside
I'm tired of these dreams
Release me from this pain
So I can live again
I wish that I could bring them back
So file could be the same

Release me from this pain
So I can live again
I'd trade places if I could
And no, I'm not misunderstood

Release me from this pain
So I can live again
The chosen heroes looking down
I live my life to make you proud

Release me from this pain
Take on the world
Now it's our turn
We're indivisible
Pushing as one
Flowing ahead
Just as long as you're clear
Where is the life I had?
It's only began
Rest assured
You will learn sooner or later
Our world shall burn
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
They'll always know to remember us
Now is the time
Can you feel it?
Get up
Now is the time
Can you feel it?
Jump up on your feet
Now march to the bear
Silence is the only thing that we have left to retreat
Silence
Oh god
Oh why
Reach for the ammo
Reload the gun
