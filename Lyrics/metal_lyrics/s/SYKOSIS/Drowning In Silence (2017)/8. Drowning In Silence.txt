Everyday I take more strain
I try to look away
What's staring back at me
This life I live of agony
The hell that lurks inside of me
Can't seem to get this right
I fight through another night.

I'm reaching towards the end again
A place where I can sleep forever
A few more pills to break this cycle
My body has grown numb
No taste left on my tongue
Wake up feeling cold again
Deceit from lies are soaking
It seems I've lost another friend
Back and forth
When will this end
My hands they feel like ice
But burn like fire
Everything that I desire
Crumbles to dust
Am I the liar

Choking on the air I breathe gasping
Now my lungs they seize
So much pain
I cannot see
I will be death of me

Just can't kill what's inside of me
I will be the death of me
Don't get to close
I should have known
The monster unleashed has a mind of its own
Don't come too close
Or else you will know the hell
That is scorching
Has taken my soul
Don't leave me now
To you I'm just a ghost
I'm drowning in silence suffocating
All alone
I should have known
That my antidote eligos
Illusions intensify
These chemicals one more time

So you won't suffer the torment I endure
My times expired
Hanging on the edge
I'm slipping off again
Fighting for my life
Cancel all my plans tonight
