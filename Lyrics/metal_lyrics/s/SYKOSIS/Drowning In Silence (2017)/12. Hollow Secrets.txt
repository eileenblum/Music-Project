I bare these scars
I declare war on you
You betrayed me
But now I wear these scars as proof
Help me believe what's right
How do I know it's not a filthy lie
Whispers in my head
Tragedy in my mind
It's tearing me apart
You can't take what's mine

It's mine
It's mine
It's mine

These demons in my head
They tear me limb from limb
The clock is ticking down
I'm running out of time

You know it's going to cost you
You know it's almost over now
You know it's going to cost you
You know I'll never be the same

Every time I see your face another day
Another lie kills me
I would walk through a thousand knives
Just to feel the pain
Just to feel I'm alive, alive, alive

I will walk alone
I will stand alone
I will never back down
This worldâit tries to tear me down

You know it's going to cost you
You know it's almost over now
You know it's going to cost you
You know I'll never be the same

The rage I have inside
Shakes the monster within me
This aching agony
Paints its smile in my face

My mind's racing
All my life I've been forsaken
Now I'm lying here vacant
Now my hate has been awakened

My mind's racing
All my life I've been forsaken
Now I'm lying here vacant
Now my hate has been awakened

My mind's racing
All my life I've been forsaken
Now I'm lying here vacant
Now my hate has been awakened

My mind's racing
All my life I've been forsaken
Now I'm lying here vacant
Now I'm lying here awake
Lying here awake

If you could only see
How far we have flown
Just to fall again

If you could only see
How far we have run
Just to crawl again

Then I looked inside
And I washed away the tide
I see the fear lost in your eyes
It's so familiar when I hear your cries

Then I looked inside
And I washed away the tide
I see the fear lost in your eyes
It's so familiar when I hear your cries

It's almost over now
It's almost over now
Break these chains
Just to stay alive
