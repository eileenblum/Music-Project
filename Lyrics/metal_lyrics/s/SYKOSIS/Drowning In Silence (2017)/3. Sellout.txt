You can't kill me
There's not enough devotion to follow through
Maybe you missed the point
You better ask someone
Got your ducks in a row
But your head up your ass
You're in the clouds now
If you only took a moment
To reflect on everything
You've said and done to me, neglect

You wanna break me
You wanna lead me
You wanna leave me out to die
You wanna take this
You wanna make this
You wanna leave this hole in my life

You are prestigious
You are contagious
You are the reason I won't quit

I can't stand you looking at you
It makes me sick

You are the cancer in my life
You fucking sellout

You sold me out
You told me now
And I am sure
I'll bleed you out

You wanna break me
You wanna be me
You wanna leave me out to die
You wanna take this
You wanna make this
You wanna leave this hole in my life

You are prestigious
You are contagious
You are the reason I won't quit
Looking at you
You make me sick

You are the cancer in my life
You fucking sellout

You can't break me
There's not enough devotion to follow through

Maybe you missed the point
Let me spell it out for you
Get your act together
Or get the fuck out of my face

I've had enough of all your bullshit
You're worthless
You're spineless
Now just leave
