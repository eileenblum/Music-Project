People deprived of homes dispossessed of all rights
Souls deprived of bodies hypnotized by this sight
Witness your death in silence hottest show in your life
There must be something after to reward the deprived
Threshold of pain over, step over threshold of pain

I have been taught to fear real pain, real death
Now it seems so clear I believed stupid tales
I had my chance and lost it but I feel no remorse
Easy escape they promised to the one who will cross
Threshold of pain over, step over threshold of pain

How damn right you were people who lived like there was no tomorrow
Because there is really no tomorrow come on it's all over anyway
