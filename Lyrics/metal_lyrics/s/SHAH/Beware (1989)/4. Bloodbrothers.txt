Emptiness taking me over here it comes future life
Painful memories follow me at night
So much time spent together on the way to the top
Can't you see, it's too late fighting stupid war
War blood brothers slay

Horrible shadows of never haunting me all my life
Thundering roar of the battle three, four, fire!
You better die than surrender dead return to the fold
Gnash your teeth, cry in vain fighting stupid war
War blood brothers slay

Emptiness taking me over here it comes, future life
Painful memories follow me at night
Just for nothing blood brothers die
