You are dying, nothing left for you laughing voices whisper in my sleep
Fucking bastard, seeking sacred truth blinded by your fake beliefs
Can't remember things about my past wide awake I don't know where I am
Something happened in the dead of night deafening silence rips my brains

You're the last in this world feel eternal guilt
Now you are looking into blazing eyes of death
Die Total Devastation!

Everlasting present just collapsed it was so easy so quick
Thrown into deepest ever gap realize your fate unique
Had no time to comprehend the change simply no trace of any life
Odd and isolated thought remains human losses justified

Thinking you are crazy want to know why
You're the last to answer you're the last to die
Fire killing fire die at my command
Crying victims dying world's coming to an end
Thinking you are crazy want to know why
You're the last to answer you're the last to die
Die it is over dying in the dust die for what you lusted praise death am I dreaming
