Deadly midnight hour no one is in sight
Dark demonic powers make you step inside
Once you might have taken slightly different turn
Know where you end up soon you will have to learn

His insane cry terrifies
You inside holy voice of heaven
Where are you where the hell are you?
So beware he is everywhere
So beware I'll tell you the end of it some other day

Can't see in the darkness don't know where to turn
Wrapped in total silence you are the chosen one
It's for you to go forward to survive
Want to see tomorrow want to see daylight

You will hear him shout
Going to kill you going to kill you
You will hear him shout
Going to kill you going to kill you
