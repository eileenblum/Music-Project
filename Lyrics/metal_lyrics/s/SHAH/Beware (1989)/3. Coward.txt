Feel no cold, feel no pain, cry out never hear
Sitting in the corner staring at the wall rosy dreams forgotten
What was right turned wrong hiding from reality all emotions gone
Coward fucking coward!

You are lost no friends hard to make them care thought you were clever
Laughed at all the rest listened to the others making a pretence
Lived from peoples charity never even guessed
Coward fucking coward!

You are stuck just stuck can't move on no escape no return.
Visions of the past fighting back agonize in your head
Apathetic smile will depressed fear to life, fear of death
Tear apart your soul you don't mind if you live or you die
Feel frustration time will pass, you know what I mean
That is life sink or swim painful memories fade away
Leaving shadows on your face prisoner of life
