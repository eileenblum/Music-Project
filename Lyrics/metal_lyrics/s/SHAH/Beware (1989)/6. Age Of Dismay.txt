Time has come, it's the end, soon you will meet your maker
See your death, it's for real, you are going to die
Think of your fucking life, now you must remember
All your crimes, bloody crimes, long-forgotten crimes

In your anguish you pray and the harder you try
In the Age of Dismay absolution denied
Too late to start again Age of Dismay
Corrupted minds prevail Age of Dismay
Too late to end this game Age of Dismay
Society of slaves Age of Dismay

You were born in this sweet perfect outsider
Soon you've learnt how to kill innocent at night
Never thought of the pain you would have to suffer
Memories of your past wouldn't let you die
