Don't mind to be blind O.K lead me, be so kind!
Tired of all this crap, bloody fucking crap beware AIDS, or you are trapped!
And if you fuck, curse and drink believe me not, think what you think
Get it fools get it right we live in hell, it's gone too far
We'll soon be dead, no way out if we all sinned, let's die together!
Save the human race useless prayer

If we found the way out come on does it matter now?
Drink more beer and your fears go down the drain my dear friends, don't fuck my brains
What can I do if, all the time men murder men in broad daylight
Don't know why, can you tell you're watching me and try to help
Fuck off and die go to hell want some fun in this nightmare!
Save the human race useless prayer
