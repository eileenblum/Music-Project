The scorching heat the raging mob despite my cries they wouldn't stop they are starving for bloodshed
I can't resist I can't prevent they realize what they have meant it'll follow me like nightmare
I know that you were doomed I know it can't pause
You have to bear your cross you have to please them

They need your bread they need your pain but I believe you will regain
And your name will be a prayer they had a chance but now it's gone
Before the death you are alone they will pay for their betrayal
I know that you were doomed I know it can't pause
You have to bear your cross you have to please them

And I can only feel remorse
Crucified mortified it's my fault you should die
Through the thorns through the grief bring the crowd new belief
Through the time repeat a lot name of God name of Lord
When I see the crowd kneel can you feel what I can feel
Please forgive me God forgive me Lord forgive me and trust
