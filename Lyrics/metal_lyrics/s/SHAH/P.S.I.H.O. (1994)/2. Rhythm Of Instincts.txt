I can strike a chord inside you it can take you out of cell
You can get a basic impulse I can give it losing myself
I can feel no sense of pleasure you've got power of the keys
In the rhythm of the heat in the heart of the beat
In the time of the speed and the power

We go out in the world instincts never stop distance is too long
I know it is more then real abstract from the holding ties
You know justice will be punished reflect in your fevered eyes
I can feel no sense of pleasure you've got power of the keys
In the rhythm of the heat in the heart of the beat
In the time of the speed and the power

We go out in the world instincts never stop distance is too long
You will rise pulsing world rhythm of you basic chord
