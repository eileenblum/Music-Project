An enigmatic branch of you is conceived in the depth of your psycho space.
Your personality decays layer by layer refracting your inner world and there appears new dreadful reality.

Lugubrious universe echo persistence illusion
Saint temptation memories in the spheres of confusion
Man of Earth distance reverse movement gets the power
Get separated eliminate unknowable hours
Dangerous mind sensible blind aggravate your sharp shift
And just common relax don't get the facts you must believe in lie
Sharp infection infection sharp reaction affection
Shift illusion pollution shift collision despite the sign

Meditation on attack psychedelic reflection
Now approaching the flag in your own hallucination
Man of Earth distance reverse movement gets the power
Get separated eliminate unknowable hours
Dangerous mind sensible blind aggravate your sharp shift
And just common relax don't get the facts you must believe in lie
Sharp injection sharp reaction affection
Shift illusion pollution shift collision despite the sign of fevered mind

Men living still premonition a line of shadow tracks
Memory out leave behind apparition behind my spirit sound
Side by side taking myself taking me evermore dead
Gap grows deep disconnection attempt to follow mind
Over the flesh through the verge interaction inherit missing past
Side by side taking myself taking me evermore dead
