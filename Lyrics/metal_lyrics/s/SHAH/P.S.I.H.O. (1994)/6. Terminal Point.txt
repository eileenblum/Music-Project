When I see the Earth forsaken can't believe this painful sight
I just think we're all gone mad we took all that could be taken
Never gave back what we might we whose idols are long dead
Because the ultimate is our turning point don't you feel terminal point don't you feel terminal
Seeking starving hiding from the pain crying bleeding centuries in vain
Perished peace is lame excuse collapse waits for us

Suffers from the suffocation feeds the ravening human race breathes through the cancered lungs
Ever coming termination never coming virgin grace through the hell to regain once
Because the ultimate is our turning point don't you feel terminal point don't you feel terminal
Seeking starving hiding from the pain crying bleeding centuries in vain
Perished peace is lame excuse collapse waits for us

First play then pay all the slogans have been turned to none
I foresee the sorrow I foresee the waste-land
One knows way out but he holds his tongue come on have a good time now
