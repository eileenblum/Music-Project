Distance of innocence among the drifting death obscurity millions miles away
Signals of memory remember it myself forever wait of shortest fate
Break out relation change so real imminence

Calling my freedom and revelation dead I see my distant suicide
Freedom last order and ever coming death forever stay in obscure side
Break out relation change so real imminence

From the men and from Messiah from the pain and from desire to abyss and to the fire before the coming
Distance of innocence among the drifting death obscurity millions miles away
Signal of memory remember it myself forever wait of shortest fate
Break out break out break out break out
