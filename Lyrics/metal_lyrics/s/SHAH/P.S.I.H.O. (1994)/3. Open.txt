Aggravation of the lies you fall hard to realize
Nothing will matter nothing will save all you feel covered with shroud
Your desire to revive will be stronger then your life nothing but power nothing but will
You are still shift of relations comes raise your voice your damned choice

Situation should be solved come on pride to be involved
All you remember all you forgot you possess freedom awaits for you
Raise your voice your damned choice after years of gloom leave four horrors behind
Pay to whom you owe don't stay blind

Penetrate through the words touch what no one can see
Stay aloof from crowd you are free now you are free
