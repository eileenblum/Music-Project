The man steps out of life and though his body died he thinks there was the time when could start again
Ferocious smile of instant gloom the rare gifts of dormant doom and many things that passed me by
Before I died no more tears like falling rain no more life inscrutable days
No more fears like boring obsession every passing day

The man afraid of life his fortune looks like mine but though he thinks of time when could start again
Ferocious smile of instant gloom the rare gifts of dormant doom and many things that passed me by
Before I died no more tears like falling rain no more life inscrutable days
No more fears like boring obsession every passing day

P.S.I.H.O.
Dead you dead man I feel it leading me away to I don't know where
And here I come to feel the cold of winter in my head the night is long the light is dim
Pay out for fruitless soul so glad that's over
Now I know and here comes endless cold
P.S.I.H.O.
