Passing time erase the lines saint time makes me believe in destiny
You can hear planet voice to rebel is your choice
Endless torture waits for you you can't leave before you knew and we must sacrifice

Hunting time parts you and me lasting crime you have too much to justify
Restless spirit placed in cell let you out toll the bell
Gushing whisper pours from sky seek the prayer to survive and we must sacrifice

Knowledge we bear pride of my race all that we have so unreal it seems
You your life deprived of past this game has no law escape from danger
You alone in darkened world you long to know more here come the changes
Seek prayer to survive feel changes
