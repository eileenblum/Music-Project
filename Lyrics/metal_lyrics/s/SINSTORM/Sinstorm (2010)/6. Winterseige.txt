I gaze upon
Their faces
Of those who would defile
No chance we'd reconcile
We await their slaughter
The winter winds begin
If not our hate that takes their lives
The winterseige begins.
Rise

Rise!!!
From the highest peaks of mountains
We storm their frozen Force.
Their bodies fall like beaten slaves
Send these cowards to their graves
This is the war of winter

This is the wintersiege.
Nothing stops our killing now
This wintersiege this solemn vow.

Vow.
