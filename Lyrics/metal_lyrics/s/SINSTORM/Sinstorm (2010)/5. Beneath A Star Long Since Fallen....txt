Gaze across the desolate plains
Void of life
The earth veins have dried ,no remedies tried,
What happened that night when hell would decide

Convictions held strong that a savior will come from
Beyond the stars to save everyone
If only they knew... where their star ... fell from,
If only they knew ... the pain that's begun.

Invocation that falls upon deaf ears
How is it possible to appeal
To the eyes and ears of divinity.
Waiting for a sign to reveal.
Fall!!!

Beneath... a star... long... since... fallen

Beneath... a star... long ... since... fallen
Fallen from grace...
Without a trace, our lives were erased,
This is the tale of human disgrace.
Beneath... a star... long ... since... fallen
