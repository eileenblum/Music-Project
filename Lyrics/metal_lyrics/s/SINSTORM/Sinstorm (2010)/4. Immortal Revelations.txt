Waiting, for the dead to rise and march forth
Grieve mine eyes arise to defend, the fear that the fallen are soon to ascend
Spreads like ravenous venomous hate, and all who still live shall share the same fate
Misery, darkest acts of contemplation
Agony, beg for death before salvation
With my final breath I recall a night of horrid dismay
The clouds conceal the heavens from the mortal sons of earth
Strikes of thunder lacerate condemning mortal birth
Written on the faces of the children who are lost
Disbelief at their own fates the paths that they have crossed, revealed!!!
Revealed to mine eyes a path from which I cannot return.
The way we were, so innocent, so young, concealed was the darkness within me, as wind and time flow the sands
Break away, dreams of pure madness too vivid and real the line of reality in shade,
Festering cries of religious intent revealed to me the very truths of a desperate kind of greedy hate,
Anticipate of wealth for mortal kind
What does it matter I say clenching my chest alone and shriveled tonight.
Surrounded by eyes of vultured intent revealed to mine eyes
Collapse of pure spirit, to a world full of fear
Inevitably certainly rise
From the voice of the wind a warning to all
Prepare to lose your lives!

Faced with the trials of ancestors past
And the outcome remains the same
We walk the same path from dusk to disgrace
Our humanity decays in vain.
