Feel the winds of ages past, frozen we march toward the sky
We wait for a sign, facing a truth I could never deny
Journey ahead, through a path as old as death, miseries, and pain
Follow me as I transcend, as you are now so once was I, as I am now you soon will be
Prepare to die and follow me
Close your eyes feel death embrace your putrid corpse from this bloodstained place
Alone your soul is withered cold confused in pain in frost and snow
Helpless to the random will of time, as if you had a hand in your worthless
Fate remains the guiding hand twisting reality toward the end
Alone your soul is withered cold confused in pain in frost and snow
My time has come my flesh dries below my grave rotting the earth
A bitter wind rips at this barren world, silent and cold
Feeling my body ripped from my soul... transcending dimensions
No mortal lies, no worthless cries, slowly the light fades away from my eyes
Feeling my body ripped from my soul... transcending dimensions
The path ahead is aeons long, a solemn end to a starless sky, a battle that none can ever win
Struck with a fear unsurpassed, a silence that could pierce your soul, unable to comprehend this end,
As your ashes never were. Arise and transcend Death.
I never knew my final day was here, that all I knew would disappear,
If I could live another life, I would accept my dreaded fate!
