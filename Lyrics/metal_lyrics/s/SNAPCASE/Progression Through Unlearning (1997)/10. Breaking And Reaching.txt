I run and i fall while the world keeps on running,
running right by them don't bother to lend a hand.
they want me to follow, but i can't understand.
and i'll wait, i'll wait, but they don't acknowledge me.
i've bought the answers even when i disagreed.
breaking...breaking my inhibitions...reaching...reaching my destinations.
when your sinking you'll learn to edify.
treat yourself like someone, give someone a piece of your mind.
regrets are token of what had gone untold.
you're only special when you break from the mold.
breaking...breaking my inhibitions...reaching...reaching my destinations.
