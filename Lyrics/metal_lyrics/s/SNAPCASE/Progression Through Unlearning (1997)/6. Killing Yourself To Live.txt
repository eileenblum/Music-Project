you're poisoning the sole essence, poisoning your whole existence
for the substitution of cognition, walking around like the living dead.
killing yourself...killing yourself...why do we kill ourselves to live?
wafer thin, new role models suffer yourself caught in a fashion spin.
full subscription, false admission, walking around with an empty head
a standard wage, routine daily, overindulge and live inside a cage.
repetition of blurred vision. minimum gain from the blood we shed.
