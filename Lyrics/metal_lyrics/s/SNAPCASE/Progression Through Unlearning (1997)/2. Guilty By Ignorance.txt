the life you live ignoring who, ignoring who you're giving money to.
and you , you support the corrupt industries and companies who don't think to care.
guilty...guilty...guilty by ignorance.
no feeling...no substance...killing...you're killing through your ignorance.
so understand they kill, they kill for the sake of capital gain.
and your blind consumption fuels, fuels the corporate fires of destruction.
because you don't care to know that your life steals life.
so take a look at your empty conscience because ignorance is not innocence.
you...have...become, you've become the enemy to those, to those victims of greed.
to those victims.
