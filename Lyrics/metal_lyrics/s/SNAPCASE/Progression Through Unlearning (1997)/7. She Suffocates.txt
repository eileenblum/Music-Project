we don't see her behind her molded worth, 
and she excepts it, or regrets it. we consume her shell.
she must refuse his pride. this world she must defy...defy
they will sell her as a mindless game,
and you're a winner when you own her. what we expect is vain.
doors don't open and she suffocates,
and she will teach us and makes some changes, but we don't learn a thing.
we don't see her...we don't see her...we'll consume her, but we don't see her.
