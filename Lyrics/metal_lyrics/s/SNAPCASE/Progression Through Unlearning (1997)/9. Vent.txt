so it's been a bad day. everything seems grey. my upstairs is out of place.
i need to be by myself, rely on no one else. only i can erase the slate.
all of the walls i've built to protect me seem to fall
down all around and i see things so differently, down
is the taste of the day but things will change.
i can be strong....keep my head up.
time, all i need is some time by myself. i need to
go where there is no one to come and try to find me. 
my feelings must open up and vent, breathe.
i can be strong...beat frustration...keep my head up...accept my feelings now.
so there will be better days. saced getaways are the means of my escape.
then i will collect my thoughts or lose them if i chose. i control this game.
