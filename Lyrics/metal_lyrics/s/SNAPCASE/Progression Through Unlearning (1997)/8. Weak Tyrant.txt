open your hands. clenched fists, black eyes and weakness inside, inside your mind.
you're scared that you can't hide your fear of that which reveals weaknesses.
so you hide your insecurities through hatred, anger, and intimidation.
self-destruction, embrace nothing, it's digression.
go...go away from here.
no...no progression.
through your violence it brings us all down.
we have fallen through your anger.
weakness is the weak tyrant.
