now i can walk through those, through those fires that burn in the path of my dreams.
my soul is, my soul is my savior, my autonomy, you tried to steal it.
you had me shut down, but i'm alive since i have found...
faith...moves, faith moves the mountains as fear runs into the ocean deep.
take me far away from here. i've come to claim my confidence and my will.
you've had me down, had me standing in my own way,
a blinded coward, but now ill follow my lead.
learn to walk beyond those who have walked all, walked all over you.
so i have found my voice through perseverance,
and left the choice to speak the words that have gone unsaid.
