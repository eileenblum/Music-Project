because i can't feel what you feel. i'm afraid to see whats real.
cause one can't go on, go on being beaten upon.
and i can't see how lucky it is to be me.
and i feel ashamed because your life is my worst dream.
through windows we look but we cannot feel
the anguish, suffering and harsh ordeals.
no sense, no sense of empathy is this the way, the way it has to be.
and you, you look to me, you look to me for sympathy
and what can i say? i might know if i felt the pain.
but we just look away we look away to ignore the pain.
through windows must break the pane.
through windows we see you...through windows we can't feel.
