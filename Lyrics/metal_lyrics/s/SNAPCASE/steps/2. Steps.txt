i want to live my life, live it my own way. over throw the shame, 
the shame you dealt, brought me to my knees.
always trying to please you instead of living for me
you...say...you say you knows what's best for me.
time...change...the time has come for me to change.
and you controlled my dreams. you never asked me and i never agreed, 
to your requests, goals, destinies. i abandoned you and now i'm free.
i...live...for...me.
now i, i live my life, live it my own way, forget yesterday.
no expectations just my ambitions. Identity, the choice is up to me.
