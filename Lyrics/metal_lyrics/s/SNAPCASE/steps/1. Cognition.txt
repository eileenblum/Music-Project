this is the way i get when i'm unhappy with myself.
i feel my mistakes pounding in to my head, 
lying to my conscience believing that I was misled.
there's things I've learned now since time's passed on.
still i hurt, when will regret be gone.
gone are the days of feeling good within my soul
and I'll gain self respect by gaining self control.
i've got a feeling that i could beat this game.
then I wont have to...
why do i do the wrong thing over and over again?
when it seems the outcome never makes any sense.
i've got a feeling that I could beat this game. 
then I won't have to...feel the shame.
