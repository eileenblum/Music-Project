innocence, innocence stripped from mankind.
people acting like animals to suppress their own kind.
the family structure has fallen, forcing us into troubled times.
broken homes, battered children, 
the more we advance the further civilization declines.
crown of thorns...objects of desire
crown of thorns...the things we think pick us up
drag us down...polluting our minds.
crown of thorns...the hands of the puppeteer.
crown of thorns...who pulls our strings.
whose life's blood flows among us, sheds no tears.
life...death...love...hate...enemies...reward...steal.
