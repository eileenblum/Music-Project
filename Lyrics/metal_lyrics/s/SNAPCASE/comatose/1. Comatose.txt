land of the free, home of the brave.
to the system we exist and as slaves to our trades
power to the people or the machine on top.
as the life of the working man starts and stops.
power to the people or the machines that we are.
real control is at the hands of political czars.
land...of...the...free...
we must make the mission impossible, mission unstoppable.
painting by numbers, unfinished, unclear. too late, apocalypse is here.
