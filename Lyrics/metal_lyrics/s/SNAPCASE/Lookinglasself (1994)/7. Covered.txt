as the dark clouds move in, it's stealing the sunshine.
warm rain falls down soothing the earth's mind.
the thunder crashes down, the power, relentless sound.
the sun burns holes in the surface of covered souls
covered, the dirt, the rain corruption bleeds the vein.
all i can see is mist through the trees.
the clouded sky asks who's going to die.
her windy spirit, we're all trapped within it.
lightning pierces through, electrifies heaven's view.
god's children sanctify, looking into nature's eye.
