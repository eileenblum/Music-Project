because i love you, i don't have to see.
because i don't know you, I can't know me.
because i don't know why, but i'm willed to die. 
possessed to be, i killed you in me.
and i'm to blame. i killed the flame. 
persist to try, i'm living a lie, living a lie, living.
my passion's deceived.
