another's...life
another's life is taken, your descent forsaken.
and i don't know why you cant prioritize.
scared, helpless and weak.
it's not her fault that the children won't speak
forests, animals, ourselves and now others.
look ahead to our sisters and brothers.
tomorrow's world can't die.
we've got to be the catchers in the rye.
