incarnation, bring it to life , bring it to life embody the soul.
the soul, the spirit the essence of life.
life's now absent in our consciousness.
in this world death just exists.
i know that we can live today but tomorrow's more important
the future looks despondent, don't mean its hopeless.
carpe diem is great with focus and duration.
it's time to live again...incarnation.
associate the masses in a world that's worth existence.
endure the pain, universalize the message.
we've got to kill the fear that halts us in relations.
it's time to live again...incarnation.
i'ts time to live in a world worth living, a sense of hope a sense of feeling.
recognize death, life is celebration. start today...incarnation.
