all that i wanted was a space to rectify, 
to rid deception, to sift and purify.
filter out the desecrated...sift...sanctify what she created.
dying with a goal in mind to save me
from that which contaminates drives us to misery.
die, with a goal i'm dying.
life, live in natures harmony.
contaminated, filter those who desecrate.
intent to survive, to sift purify.
