anger...burns
anger inside...make my mind...burn.
i'm on fire, smoke runs through my veins.
ignited by the ignorance of those not insane.
there's no bridge.
your sacrilege spaces us miles apart.
adrenaline, pressure builds, can't connect to your heart.
anger inside...makes my mind...
burn...theres no bridge
