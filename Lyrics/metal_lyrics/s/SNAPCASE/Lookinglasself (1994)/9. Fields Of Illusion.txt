caught as i run. i question my existence. i put myself on trial.
confronting my values, deciding my verdict, accepting my fate.
fields of illusion, i...fear...the...path...that...has...yet...to come.
surrounded by the fire, the flames that hinder my search...for knowledge.
abstract shadows haunt me as the dark clouds block the light of truth. 
behold the power.
all i see are these images, as the specters of ignorance dance around me, 
refusing my mind to be free. fields of illusion.
sitting there in the darkness wondering if the sun...will ever rise again.
one day these shackles that bind me will fall to the ground.
you can try to fight me, but the truth will be found.
