alone, all by myself in fear of failure,
unable to see who I am, who's my savior.
and i don't know why, why i've come here
to the place of condemnation, my existence remains unclear.
but i have broken through, through whats enslaved me.
abolish your guilt wall, realization allowed me to be free.
and my self confidence has taught me virtues.
your power was my weakness. my weakness was your power.
me...do they need me? you...do i need you?
