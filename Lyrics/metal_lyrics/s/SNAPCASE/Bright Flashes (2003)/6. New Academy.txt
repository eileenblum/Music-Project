Today's the first day for the new academy.
A life to pioneer.
We worked.
We won.
We're moving on.
No time to take a breath now.
A celebration for our crew on mission one;
A mission one won't forget.
We lost that world and gained a hope.
No time to take a breath.
We're looking at our past.
I don't know if it's lost for good, and can it really last?
But we won't, no we won't watch it.
Were looking down on this sphere that we had to leave;
A self destructive land.
We worked.
We won.
We're moving on.
No time to take a breath.
We set a fire today;
A fire without a flame;
A flame without a hope.
But we won't, no we won't watch it burn!
We're asking what we left.
We're asking, who we are, and what we're destined to become.
But we won't, no we won't watch it burn!
