Makeshift tourniquet will serve as your answer.
Clutch paramedic will be your constant call.
Keep alive all of your people.
They all need someone to bleed on.
You possess the breath of life;
Keeping alive.
Air induced poison slows our circulation.
Life support system calms palpitations.
You possess what's keeping us alive, this breath of life.
