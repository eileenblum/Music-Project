Five - Four...
System countdown will begin.
Will you honor your thoughts?
With ignition switches flipped, are you true to your word?
But we'll tell you once again.

Four - Three...
Don't be a deceiver because you know you'll be left to burn.
And you hold on to nothing when your feet never leave ground.

Your devotion is on the line.
Can you commit and sustain?
And when the take-off engines run, are you willing to die?
But we'll tell you once again...

Three - Two...
Don't be a deceiver because you know you'll be left to burn.
And you hold on to nothing when your feet never leave ground.

Five - Four - Three - Two - One...Go!
Kiss the ground one last time.
