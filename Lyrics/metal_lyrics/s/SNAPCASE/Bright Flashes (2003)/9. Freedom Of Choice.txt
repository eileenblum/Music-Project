victim of collision on the open sea
nobody ever said that life was free
sink swim go down with the ship
but use your freedom of choice
i say it again in the land of the free
use your freedom of choice
in ancient rome there was a poem
about a dog who had two bones
he picked at one he licked the other
he went in circles till he dropped dead
freedom of choice is what you got
freedom of choice is what you want
then if you got it you don't want it
seems to be the rule of thumb
don't be tricked by what you see
you got two ways to go
