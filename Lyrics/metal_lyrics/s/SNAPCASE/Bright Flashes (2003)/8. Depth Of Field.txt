Well the field is wide open with endless new lands and infinite landscapes
for us to create now.
Yeah, I want to live in another light.
Yeah, I want to live.
Here the walls keep closing as we suffocate, but a door just opened wide.
We can't let us die.
We must prepare for a time to rise and then we'll face the truth.
We'll face ourselves.
