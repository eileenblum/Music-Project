The opposition, carcinogenic sweat that hides.
The persecution, these hidden walls keep us aligned.
Yeah, they keep us in line.
Fourteen hours more.
Covert tonight.
The operation, a covert plan to get outside.
The consecration, an archetype of a will that shines.
Shining alive!
Will you die or can we keep you alive?
When there is a machine gun on every corner, you won't see me.
When there is a federal eye in every household, you won't see me.
When your every move is monitored, you won't see me.
And when it's all too late, you won't see me.
