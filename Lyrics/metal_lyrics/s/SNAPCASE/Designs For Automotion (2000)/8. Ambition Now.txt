the most high and sacred a love to die complete commitment your spark, 
your fire for this i will not, give in its untainted, no conditions this is so sacred, 
it's so sacred and it sets the tone and the rhythm of your life live your life 
and i won't dissolve under those distractions of and those temptations of false endeavors 
no matter where your at now it takes you back home again 
to your safety and your true meaning distractions down, ambitions now
