can you... feel your heartbeat, are you living? 
your mind is unsung because you're not driven 
you need to rise up and personalize your existence 
you need to wake up and activate the dreams of your soul 
idle, revolt, hero, your hero is yourself 
they'll break you in, they'll break you down 
and leave you down with nothing you lose yourself 
and learn from them whatever they wish to teach you 
you need to rise up and revolutionize your thinking 
you need to wake up and activate the dreams of your soul 
idle, revolt, hero, your hero is yourself 
you know your dead and it's you your deceiving 
you need to find a way, to yourself, 
find a way, to make yourself live, to make yourself live 
you need to rise up and revolutionize your thinking 
you need to wake up and activate the dreams of your soul 
you need to find a way to make your self live
