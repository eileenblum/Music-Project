can you sleep, it's on your mind 
you're full of doubt to lose your cool or rock for light 
it's up to you you're spinning now, your head's a blur 
you better stop and look stop and look around 
because here it comes don't scare yourself 
your twentieth nervous breakdown is on the verge a breakdown, 
you're too neurotic uptight and too tense to function 
you look for help and heads are turned all alone can't hide yourself, 
your too exposed you must perform the clock is ticking, 
now's your call you better stop and look stop and look around 
don't you want to, get away and blow it off? 
the easy way and leave yourself with nothing empty 
could've beens and regrets it's all you've got it's all you've got now
