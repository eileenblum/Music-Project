so diluted, cannot see a spirits crying, 
my cultures dead and we force them underground what we consume, 
are conventional personalities what eyes can't see, 
are genuine identities consumer culture, 
buying traditions customs stolen, 
to novelty items stay deeply rooted, 
don't let your eyes burn clean 
don't detest your differences 
don't disguise, unique features 
don't despise your eyes 
don't defy your kind 
don't refuse your mind
