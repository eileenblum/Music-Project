build temples to your dreams take time to break the static 
you need to chase a challenge shake things up, 
blame nothing find something to wake your spirit 
you need to push your boundaries fall, fall into yourself when, 
when the sky is falling down you're tied to your routine life 
a safe existence a life of dull compliance 
embrace the child in your mind wake your creative process 
you can't condemn your wonders break the static chase 
some challenges embrace, challenge awake, 
embrace, challenge shake things up and live again 
time to shine on and shine bright your headlong voyage 
into the unknown daring missions 
to wake your senses escape mechanical existence
