don't paint us the perfect picture we have visions of our own
don't give us the safe interpretation we want, we want to know the ugly truth 
we're not down to die and be this typecast culture 
we're not down to die and be the faceless soldiers
don't sell us the perfect image we'll struggle to find out ourselves 
we want the unpopular challenge we want, we want to test our intellect 
we have learned this devotion we are programmed, conditioned senseless, 
senseless emotions we have lost our desire to think alone we're not down
