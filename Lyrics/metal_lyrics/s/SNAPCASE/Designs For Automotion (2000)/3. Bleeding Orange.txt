why, do i work here? eye, electric eye on my back who's the next one down?, 
to be the perfect clone to be the perfect drone, 
to be the star employee ten cent raise, 
ten cent raise work five times faster you pressure me, 
no apologies you just enjoy your power 
someday i'll be my own boss work for myself, 
work for myself ask of me, a faceless devotion fill my head with dreams, 
of company advancement bleed our colors, 
this is not my life bleed our colors, 
it's just my job a message, from the bottom of the ladder
