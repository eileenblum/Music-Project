think twice, take time and realign 
be careful of how you've misused your design ten times, 
ten times you've risked it all 
this time there's no one left to suffer your fall 
we are nothing, this is you alone we are nothing, 
this is you unlearn to learn to change your ways 
are you afraid of what your heroes would say 
believe and bleed your weaknesses this time, 
this time you have nowhere to defect you cover 
your scars with fresh blood restraint 
is the measure of true strength 
restraint is the measure of your fate
