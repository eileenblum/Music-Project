surrender now or disconnect, she's lost herself, 
her self respect shes head in hands and she knows 
that she's slipping her time is now and alone is real too short of breath, 
too numb to feel and she knows that she's sinking, 
sinking now's your time to face your fears 
you have to make a leap of faith he disassembles her, 
a cloud hangs over her so toughen up, 
it's time to hear you out tears may fall, 
but you'll save yourself and now's your time, 
to face your fears you have to make a leap of faith, 
and time may heal she'll die for him, 
and he gives her nothing he'll lie to her, 
and she gives him everything take, take, take break, break, break
