At midnight we make our move
And moonlight will guide our steps
The armed eyes have been removed
The spotlights, we'll time the sweep
Surveillance; we blacked it out
Pariahs are thousands strong
Reclaim identity
Escape plan proceeds through the night
Rebel forces have turned out
Infrared, they see us now
Adrenaline will test our nerves
And androids, the chase is on
The next step, we'll block them out
This barricade will buy us time
Through smokescreens, we're on the move
Reclaim identity
The dark cloud has almost passed
This mission has gone as planned
Pariahs are in control
Reclaim
Rebel forces have turned out
