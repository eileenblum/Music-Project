The opposition
Carcinogenic sweat that hides
The persecution
These hidden walls keep us aligned
Yeah, they keep us in line
Fourteen hours more
Covert tonight
The operation
A covert plan to get outside
The consecration
An archetype of a will that shines
Shining alive
Will you die or can we keep you alive?
When there is a machine gun on every corner
You won't see me
When there is a federal eye in every household
You won't see me
When your every move is monitored
You won't see me
And when it's all too late
You won't see me
