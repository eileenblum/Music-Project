Show, we live to need the need to show
Because we'll stand and be counted tonight
Hide your head to stay alive
Hide your head from your eyes
A promised land calls for a will to die
Protect this mission into the dead of the night
And we'll save your soul, you know
Time, we're running out of time
So we'll stand and be counted tonight
Turn away to see things right
Turn away to save your life
A promised land calls for a will to die
We'll save your soul
We'll stand and be counted
