The year is twenty seventy-one.
One drum by law has just begun to beat.
You'll be informed on what you'll be,
And correspond if you want to live.

Everywhere, people move to the cadence of just one drum.
Time is here, of what we feared, synchronized by the prosperous ones.

Working class, caste system, adjust.
Pushed down, down, down.
Executive hands are red again, 
But correspond if you want to live.

Everywhere, people move to the cadence of just one drum.
Time is here, of what we feared, synchronized by the prosperous ones.

People move (everywhere) to the beat (everywhere), to the beat of just one drum.
People move (everywhere) to the beat (everywhere), to the beat of just one 
drum.
