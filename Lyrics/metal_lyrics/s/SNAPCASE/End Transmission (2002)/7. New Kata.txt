Come on and find your way out
Day in, day out it's about
You've got to carry that weight now
You have to break through the bars
Someday it's time that you break through
Some days you're just messing around
Someday it's time to learn change
Change things around
And you know that you're not alone
And you know that you share a common fear
Someday it's time to learn change
Change things around
Hey angels watch for our night
No reason left for a fight
This land's been stripped of it's lifeblood
We need to escape from this world
Does anybody know a way a body could get away
Does anybody know a way
Isaac Brock, tiny cities are made of ashes
