We've got the plan
We've got the escape plan blueprint
It's not for those who don't believe
It's not for the self-indulgent
It's not for the ordinary
It's not for complacency
There's hope for a revolution
Get off of the assembly line
We've got credentials right here
We've got the power right now
We've got the plan
How about a new domain?
It's not for those who don't believe
With no time for imagination
No desire for taking charge
No care or motivation
Revolt for evolution
Get off of this planet now
We've got the escape plan blueprint
Get off this planet now
There's hope for a revolution
Revolt
