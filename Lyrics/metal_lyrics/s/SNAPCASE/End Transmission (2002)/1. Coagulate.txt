No tickets to this show, baby
Just one to a room
Are you up for a blood transfusion?
Commit and go
Who shot the shot to break the blood clot.
You can die, maybe and test your resolve
Slaves are saved through converted vessels
Of the most sacred blood
John the Baptist's head was taken
For his faith was strong
Can you defend the didactic army
Without breaking down?
Can you transfuse?
