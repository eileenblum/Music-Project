Suspect device has informed us of discrepancies
Limiting potentials
Synthetic lives enforced by genetic clones
Technology complicates simplicity
Illuminate a realized potential
Terminate idealized hype that keeps us down
Down are the hearts
Down are the minds
Down is the state of the state we are in now
Now it's the end
Now it's in sight
Now is the start of a future domain
Let's start the end
Faithless commanders lead the faithful to didactic
thoughts
Defining what's civilized
Indigenous lands are stolen by the takers
History repeats itself
