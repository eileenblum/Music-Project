I see white
Bright flashes of souls of those I know
They are so bright
They are so controlled
They won't let go
And this vision
It returns when the sky is exposed
Yeah, can you see them?
Fearless lights of souls
We're airtight
And with a lust for life
We lose that world
Immortals, now catch your breath and reopen your eyes
And this vision
It returns when the sky is exposed
Goodbye to you, domain
I fly away
Leave you with a glimpse of light
I fly away
Leave you with a saddened joy
I fly away
