Standing breathless upon a sea of faces
Wondering the forthcoming present
The dreams were never so real, so cold
And the elements whirling in infernal chasm

Pain was too strong to hold the demons in the brain cage
A senseless parallel between you and your own suffering
Parts of live crawling down in secret moments to the end
The eyes open you see behind the veil of assurance and blindness
To reassure a force of life and separate the promised throne

Essence locked into limbs unsorted
Aggravation is the law in such a distorted place
It's not mentioned in these perfect times I see
It's not mentioned, in these the key would be

According to the rush inside the swarm
A frenetic member must be named and then
Lurking and annoyed of being held
It shows his force of fear
Holding his breath for fading into other sense
Transparent glass he gazed through
But destroying the own will with hate
Must release in some a beast
Essence works into limbs unsorted
Aggravation leads the flow in such distorted wastes
