Yes I eat
Shit is given
Not only produced
I'm away from this now
But putting up with it is still the rule

Here look
Come on the cliff
Civilization of tied Sysiphes
Even not pushing their rocks no more
Just looking them in rise by a force
Which no one wants to know the origin

They believe it helps
Strange scene
You knew, this is the cliff of knowledge
And so the fog disappeared
But I saw black

Listen mommy what's that factory?
It's been built for the work of daddy
Mommy's silicone breast pointed in the distance
Son's silicone filled brain lost his chip and he was lost

The temple of intellectual abilities is a telemarketed temple
Poured by the web of the great collective spirit
The truth is absolute
And everybody say it everywhere
The cliff is always desert...
