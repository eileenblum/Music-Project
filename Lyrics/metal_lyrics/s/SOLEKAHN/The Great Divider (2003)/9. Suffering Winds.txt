At dawn the mist leaves
The fields of battle unveil the hallowed profaned
Under heaven man believes he will be saved, heaven failed
Amongst suffering winds tormented souls betray the opposite side
The curse is one deliverance for the blessed one
The ones who sought the light

Curse the fire offers
To the medium ones
To the opposite blood
Away to fulfill their own

Blinded by the thorns my entity will burn
Into dust I'll return, into ice then I will shine
Few paths are known on the way to purity
The purity of the own, what they worship is it worth?

Again we failed
Untold, but long ago...
