Afraid of closer empty rooms
And parting with it also in euphoria
The danger is to feel too soon
The taste of anger, imagine it fools you

Afraid of darker empty shells
Constant sentences don't lose you
A part of yourself in entrance
A part of yourself but hidden

Parts of time in segments don't go together
But I remember a full motion
Parts of lives in segments don't go together
But I remember the purpose of all, now...
