With my mind I opened the circle
And enter the unknown

An efficient experience in evolution

Closed to life in the false term
Reactive to the strange waters

And a genuine convoy to drizzle
In the veins that lead to control

Appearances are lost for short moments of void
Underneath cables washed by circles an eye sees
No eye sees in these depths
