In illuminating gravity of flashlights and of glimmer
The foreground will be filled with poison
In elevating hated in terror and in constant tale
The string will be broken and mold

Humans can't see the future and this lack should not be my ruin
But trust in the opposed won't be bearable
As in my own side all hope failed

Embracing the end, closer and closer but the falling will be endless
Through sentences in past times to present, life is gathered in one key
The choice of path
