Mountains to rubble. Stones to dust.
The earth quakes in its foundation.
We lie covered in rust.
We fear its flame and tusk.
Its growth will handle us.
We cover deep inside and wait for our own time.
The coal. The magma.
Its sky. Its land. Its grime.
Reborn for one last time.
We rise armored in rust.
