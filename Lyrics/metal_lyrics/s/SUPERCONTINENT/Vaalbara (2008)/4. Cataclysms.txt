Time halts as the granite landscape collapses
Time halts as the granite builds toward the sun
Broken Crust. Unsettled lands.
Removed from the masses. Gasses unleashed.
Fumes are freed as time passes.
Continents come unmoored.
Our blood our skyline.The land refutes our sun.
Mountains birthed from the soil.
Our blood is dirt. Our purpose kept unsure.
We wade through mud and clay with night as our lure.
Time halts as the granite landscape collapses.
Time halts as the granite builds toward the sun.
From above. Unseen unheard. Once a streak now a crater.
The cinders glow. The ashes settle.
Our landscape now a graveyard.
