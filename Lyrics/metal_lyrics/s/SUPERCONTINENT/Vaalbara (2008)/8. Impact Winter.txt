Split to the core where rivers of flame run for miles.
Exploding skyward. Darkening the sun.
All is cloaked in shadow.
An ashen blanket lay quiet on the land.
A promise of sunlight never forgotten.
A promise of sunlight never repaid.
What we need to grow.
What we need to live.
The clouds forever dense.
They stayed.
