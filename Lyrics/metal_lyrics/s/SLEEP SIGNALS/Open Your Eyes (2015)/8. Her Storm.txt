This rain won't stop
Just keeps pouring off of your cheeks down to our feet
It keeps adding up, surrounding us
The sky is turning red
It's happening again
And I can't make it stop
There's no hope anywhere near us
It's storming outside, it's storming outside
When it's good, it's great, but when it's not all I feel is this hate
It's storming outside, I'll be running late tonight
She's drowning and pulling him under
The sorrow, the pain
The feelings, no wonder...
Depressed with an empty hole in their hearts
Kicking and screaming like the lightning and thunder
Well, it doesn't make much sense
To come so far and then leave with so many regrets
Make every moment count and be thankful that you're around
Because what we have is true
Don't let this consume you
