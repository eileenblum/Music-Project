Early morning
Can't open my eyes
Hit the alarm, it's time to rise
You stare at me like I should burn and die
Is this deserved?
Let me know so I can try
To keep this love story we wrote page by page and note for note
She opens the door
Says she doesn't care anymore and just walks away
Made some mistakes last night
Drank too much and started a fight
Say what you mean, not what you don't
You can't take it back when everyone knows
Made some mistakes last night
Walked home in this city of white
Say what you mean, say it with me now
You can't take it back when everyone knows
Days gone by with no reply
Where are you?
Are you dead or alive?
All alone here while you're out living your life
So take what you need and then let's make this right
So I can try to keep this love story
