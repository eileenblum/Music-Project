This may take some thought
To realize who you are and who you aren't
You're not what you see in their eyes
A reflection that's always haunting you
Why do this to yourself?
Just to be like everybody else
Don't let them tell you about the past
You and I both know you were a different person then
Which way to go?
To lead or follow?
Lead and they will follow you
I will never walk away
I found the one, I found my place
But we're going nowhere with so many moves to make
Together we can do anything
We'll keep searching
Let's go, you're worth more than you know
Entering the room
With our heads held high, we'll make it through
I reach for your hand and you take mine
Starting a fire that will never die
Try not to burn yourself just to be like everybody else
I told you I will never walk away
