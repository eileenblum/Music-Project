It's all for you
We've done what you've asked of us
So we can bask in your benevolence
We created a pedestal and traded common sense for vanity
All your flocks of uninspired sheep
Do they make you feel less empty?
Here's to your plastic perfection
Here's to the vain and insatiable
Here's to the loneliness
Because you know you're dead inside
Here's to you, my dear
Now the time has come for me to break your chains, to find my own way
You'll never change, you will always be the same
Full of conceit and self-regarding
I need to stand for what I believe
You're the one that I'm escaping
It's all for you
(Here's to you)
Here's to our emptiness, our shallow insecurities and...
(Here's to you)
Here's to our high desire, our pursuit of wealth and power
Here's to your plastic perfection
