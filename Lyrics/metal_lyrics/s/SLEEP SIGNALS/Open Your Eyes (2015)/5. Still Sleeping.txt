Now I know that I've been dreaming
I've been asleep for far too long, for so long
And I know if don't wake up, I'll never truly be alive
I am lost in the dark
The walls are closing in
It's my fear I won't wake up again
These colors so vividly paint me in a scene
A scene that's not so different from reality
And I believe everything I see in my dreams
Reality is that I'm still sleeping
I don't know if my eyes are open
They've been closed for far too long, for so long
And I don't know if anybody else is here
Or am I all alone?
Reality is that I am still asleep
And we are asleep, our life is a dream
But sometimes we wake up just enough to know that we're dreaming
I am lost in the dark
The walls are closing in on me
My only fear is that I won't wake up again
