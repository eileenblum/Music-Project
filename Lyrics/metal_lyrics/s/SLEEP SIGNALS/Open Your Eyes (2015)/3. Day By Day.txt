It seems like we have so much time
Dance party on the floor every night
Where am I?
I'm moving under the lights
All these chances that we take
All the memories that we make
You never know, yeah, you never know
So be careful if you do look back
You might fast-forward
What you spend in the past, you lose in the present
Then the future doesn't seem so far away
When everything is changing it's easy to get lost
That's why we live day by day
Ready to go we're up for anything
Just name your price, doesn't matter what it is
So, where am I?
I'm still moving around
All these people that we meet
All the nights that we don't sleep
