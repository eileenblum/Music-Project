It's your choice
Take me back, but do you know where back is?
Will there be consequences someone overlooked?
Is there a room?
Or will I rot outside as you forget me?
Joining the others who were thrown into the grave
Can you ask yourself what am I thinking?
I thought you completed me
I could hide behind your pretty face
But I don't need you now
Without you I am so much more
I can finally see these things as my life becomes clearer
You say that you know, but you won't until you let go
Of everyone that you love and everything that you own
Find your way through the darkness
Don't be overlooked
I'm trying to
Step after step I'm getting farther from you
But then I trip and fall back down into the grave
It's my choice, I won't go back
It's my choice, I'll dig my own grave
It's my choice, I'm letting go
(Bury me and just let me be)
(Bury me, this is all I need)
(Bury me and here I will stay)
(Bury me and just walk away)
I can finally see these things as my life becomes so much clearer
You say that you know, but you won't until you let go
You say that you know, so just let this go
Let it go
