Stay close now
You are fading
Please hold on, help should be nearing
If you can hear me, trust the words I say
It's never okay if you're the one that ends up this way
Just know that I won't leave as long as you're still breathing
Like the life of this rose clenched in my fists
Squeezing so hard the thorns break my skin
With blood on my hands, falling to the floor
These carpet stains, they can't be ignored
Every time that I try to do something right, it's like that something dies
So go on and cause it
The tragedy, it's my misery
Through all this time, no one else has arrived
I'll see what I can do
It's just me and you
No promises as I enter your wounds
Digging deeper for you
Deeper than you ever knew
