On a midnight drive
No destination
Speeding through this fog is like I'm running over ghosts that appear in my headlights
I know I'm trying to focus on the lines
But I get lost in the back of my mind
With no bags packed, a phone that's dead and cracked
Notice in the distance someone stands on the side of the road
The stars are shining bright
Do you need me tonight?
I'm sorry I can't stop
Someone learned the hard way once
The stars are shining bright
Do you need me tonight?
I wish that I could help
But I'll just pass you by
On a midnight drive, no destination
On a midnight drive
What now?
I see you but know what I've been told
Just keep looking forward with the pedal to the floor
You wave and shout
With locked doors, no stopping now
You were just a blur in my mirror on the side of the road
I'm sorry, I can't stop
