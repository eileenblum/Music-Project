i stare possessed
past the gates of hell
blessed devil spirit
engulfed in fire

terror
far beyond the
concept of christ

do you possess
the will
to kill to kill
from hell's shadows
it rises

carries the essence of my being
into the hellish form
of murdering art
deranged spirit eternal

the timeless splendour of chaos
