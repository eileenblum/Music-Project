hunted down, become the prey
no borders shall restrain my aggression
there is nothing

who then shall save you
you have been decieved

you have been decieved

grasp the will splendid hatred eternal

the adrenaline flows swiftly
and violence controls my movements

die again, die again
under the wings of blood
die again, die again
let the blood flow

shall pain be my mistress
or create the blood filled path
that i desire
