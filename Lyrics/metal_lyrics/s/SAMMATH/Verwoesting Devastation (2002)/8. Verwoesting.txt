absolute terror
mayhem in our world
once the soul of god

curches now burn to the ground
who's sheep flee from their shephard
what is this fiction we call faith
i see what i choose, no god shall stand before

verwoesting
enraged i shall aim to kill
verwoesting
fury, i am wrath

revel in the sphere of war eternally

how long until terror once again reigns
and trenches fill with the blood of men

until the earth spins no more and withers
away eternal darkness
all of which that was made so easily
destroyed
mould the face of misfortune with hypocrisy
supreme fear not to take distance from
and to raise a fist
in the eyes of this dimension i shall defy
and crush
