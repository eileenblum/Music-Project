the end is the end as you fall
trapped in the void of death
from where on to the stars
only death is real

the second before death
when the treshold of
pain no longer matters
who shall guide me then
no one but me, no one but me

there is nothing to save you
death
and it's hypocritical prayers
that should enlighten me to the tunnel
when i should be the tunnels form

shall the brother of mankind within
lessen my pain when then i am pain
fertile life end

i look upon your corpse with disgust
so this is one of your gods creatures

are you waiting for heaven
expecting to be free from sin
when there is nothing
