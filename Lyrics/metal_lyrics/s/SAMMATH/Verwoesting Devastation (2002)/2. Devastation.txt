terror and death
from the sky
all out attack
all that one can see, turned to rubble
thousands are dead, the battle draws near
no retreat

war
nothing clear at all in sight, war
cold fear, into no-mans land, rifles held high
the devil's burning sky

rush forward, aim to shoot and kill
machine gun fire, aim to shoot and kill
countless bullets hit your body

to almost certain death, live or fall
to bleed and die

aim fire, is this battle your turn to die, war
shiver with fear, there is no escape
the end comes slowly
order of death, trenches knee deep in blood
in unending glorious war
unending glorious war
