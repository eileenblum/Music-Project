in the purest form of evil
where the claws of satan reach

the claws of satan reach
smothered by thoughts of the devil
the edge of the universe
where no soul yet has been
the darkened paradise

taken to hell's dominion

satan infinity

who is not lost within infinity
has taken his thoughts upon life
and spewed them upon his soul
die

to the glory
of the birth of chaos

satan infinity
