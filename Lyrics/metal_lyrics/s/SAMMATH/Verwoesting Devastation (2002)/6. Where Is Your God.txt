i resent
and sin again and again
saviour who never was
and shall never be

wrath unfolds upon us
but not by god

seeking the stars
for your salvation

resent

feeble saviour
dragged to hell
holy no more

in your hour of death
where is your god
in your hour of death
where is your god

the fist in the face of god
do you expect him to wait for you

as you fall to the ground
