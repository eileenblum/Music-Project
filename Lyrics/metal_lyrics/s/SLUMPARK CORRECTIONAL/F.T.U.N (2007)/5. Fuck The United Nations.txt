Filth atrocity dominate freewill
Fragment Hopeless Twisted Pain
Worldcourt seizecrown Fatlords cokeheads
Blood Stains red spots Guilt trip clowns
Thieves Intruders new age Fascists
Peacerights hellrods sentence crime
Evil Roaming earthlings nightghost
Warm up fire up endless war
Fuck the united nations
Screwing every nation
Fuck the united nations
World by world invasion
Starving hunger illness deathface
Famine little-kids naked bones
Troops assaulting sacred symbols
Top-hill shooting terror schools
Mission swat-team world war fifteen
Missiles shotguns chemical bombs
Warefare poison monochrome sunset
Extinct dying human breed
Fuck the united nations
Screwing every nation
Fuck the united nations
World by world invasion
