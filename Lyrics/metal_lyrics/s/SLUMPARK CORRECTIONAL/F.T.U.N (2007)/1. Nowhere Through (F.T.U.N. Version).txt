They taught me to hate you
They walked me though every step
They taught me to scorn you
Inhaled through every breath
They told me to fight you
While they laugh watching me
They told me to break you
When they're done torturing me
Sanity no more a friend
Thoughts refuge to a bitter end
Living hell no escape
A rush of fire that gets to you
Nowhere through
They taught me to watch you
They're messing inside my head
They taught me to fear you
They said that you want me dead
They own my senses
The shit that I have become
I fear my vengeance
Afraid of whats to come
Sanity no more a friend
Thoughts refuge to a bitter end
Living hell no escape
A rush of fire that gets to you
Nowhere through
It's time for you to go
It's time for you to go
It's time for you to go
It's time for you to GOOOOOOOOO!!
