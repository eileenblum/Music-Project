Live it all the myth
This plan never fits
You say there is nothing personal
But I see it through the mist
Barbwires tightening
In a state of rage I'm trapped
Come brag about this shit
You've done - yeah so I believe
Hey - don't throw your shit on me
I've got enough to see
Thats not what I believe
Set me free
Don't throw your shit on me
Good will won't do for me
Good deeds don't make me breath
(mother fuckers) sin for me!
Bullshit is what you hear
It's rooted deep within
Through the distant creeping days
(fuck) you know how it's always been!
Switching sides in frenzy
You don't know which side is which
Waiting for your sentence
Give it all for one damn sniff
