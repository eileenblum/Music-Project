oh dear piano player
can't you just play that tune one more time
can't you just pull your shit together one more time
then we could dance this horrible night away
and we'll keep the rhythm of this song with the motions of our
hands on each others bodies
and the way our lips will move saying sweet nothing
the straight black and white feeling
has turned into a boring shadow of gray
