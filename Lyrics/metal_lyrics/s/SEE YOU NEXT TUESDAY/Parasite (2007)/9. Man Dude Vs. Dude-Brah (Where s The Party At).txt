I know romance
I know fucking romance
you will see endless compassion
as devilish charm spews from my fucking teeth
and you can't hear anymore than the increasingly faster beat
of your slowly rotting heart
a device that pumps evil liquids through your skin
and out your teeth and drowns me
in your lake of lies the lies and deception
and the past memories that won't leave my head
