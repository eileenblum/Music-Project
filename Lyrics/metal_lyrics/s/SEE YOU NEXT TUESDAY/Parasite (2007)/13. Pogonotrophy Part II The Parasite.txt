apart every mistake that I had made with you
haunts me every moment of my life
just a picture of your undying beauty
can bring me to my knees
close the windows turn down the lights
slit my throat and turn away
it's time to forget everything
time to sleep
watch me as I light this match
and set fire to these bridges I built
I will burn down everything I ever had
there will be nothing left
the blood mixed with bitter tears
these nights are hell
hell is  every night
I am the only one
I am everything you need
I am your children's father
I am all the love
I am the other half
I am the world
I am heaven
and now I am in hell
