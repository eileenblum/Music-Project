The way you fucked me up
a kind of poetic karma
and as I sit at the bar with my friend Con
he tells me I deserve it all
he "says now you know how it feels to be complete"
"I don't feel like that" I said "I am now in hell"
he replies "you did before you fucked up
and had her you felt complete before you fucked up
then you lost her
you see now you know what its like to be complete"
