"you will never get rid of me"
those are the words you said
I'll go to sleep with that
and the echo will haunt my dreams
my wake up shivers
which are a result  the cold sweats
are the only thing to save me
from all the horrors that lie in my head
this is my nightmare
reliving ever word you said
welcome to my nightmare
this is my mew home
