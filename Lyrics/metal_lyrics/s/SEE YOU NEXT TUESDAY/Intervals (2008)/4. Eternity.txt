My compassion is all that I have left
But my depression is a different story
So now let this wave of guilt crash over my beaten body
And sweep my existence into an ocean of misery
I stare out at the moon
With my heart stained with pain
I then come to realize
I have forgotten how to live
As I drown in the abyss, I await salvation
