Reality is knocking down your door
And it pounds into your head how bad you fucked things up
You scorpion woman, you have the devil's mouth
And you have scales for skin
And a snake's venom isn't as potent
As the deceitful sounds made from the hole in your painted on face
You're a tree bent by the wind
