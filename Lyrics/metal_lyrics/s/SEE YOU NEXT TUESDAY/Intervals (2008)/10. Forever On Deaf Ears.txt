Keep your hands holding your hands I won't be there to hold them for you
I'll write the most breathtaking words you've ever heard spoken to you
These are only wasted emotions
These will be words on a page in a chapter in a book that will never be read
by your eyes
You will never know it existed
Much like me, you're nothing
Then I will sign this letter "Yours Truly, Your Nothing"
And I'll place this on a shelf for you to find some other day
Someday that it might actually mean something to you, but I doubt it ever will
