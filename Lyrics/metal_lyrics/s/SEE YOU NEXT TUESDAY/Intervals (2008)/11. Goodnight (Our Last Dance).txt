We spent the whole night watching the stars
We spent the whole night wondering what we are
And you finally saw I'm the dark horse
And you finally confess that you
Have no place with me in my world
I'm the dark horse
Come now dear and join me for one night under these bright stars
And we will take one last dance to that beat of silence
