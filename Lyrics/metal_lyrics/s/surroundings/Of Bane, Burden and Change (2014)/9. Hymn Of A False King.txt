You keep flogging a dead horse
Expecting blood from stone
Those weathered hands must eventually break
Your mouth so full of rust
I'll take an axe to its throat
To ensure that you
Taste the blood
As it seeps from formaldehyde inflicted wounds
Wear your fingers
To the bone
Upon a broken back it'll carry the weight of this world
For all of this to become my empire
A parting gift of a false king
Distance has made you all so jaded
Everything without a number is beginning to fade
We came for the taking of the kingdoms built into the sky
Constructed upon fractured bones
Tear
The flesh from bone
Open your eyes
Strokes down an empty canvas
Make way for a facade of hollow ideals
Heave through punctured lungs
As your empire burns to the hallowed ground
Sifting through the smoke
Buried within these ashes
Is the keys to change
Now wake up to the destruction that you have created
Step back
Stand back
And bask in the amber glow
Of a fallen sovereignty
Wrongdoings and failed intent
Brought forth an overdue demise
Distance has made you all so jaded
Everything without a number is beginning to fade
We came for the taking of the kingdoms built into the sky
Constructed upon fractured bones
I'll find peace, I swear
I'll find peace, oh I swear to you
