This may well be
The last time we set sail
Considering our lives hold
An alternate course
All the while to the same end
Save your breath, just listen to the waves
I'll traverse these seas alone
We've fallen apart
Upon these malicious waves
Through the boneyards
And the dust
I look to the horizon
And delve so diligently
Into the wreckage
Searching for anything
To understand the reasoning behind
This departure
But as the storm approaches
I withdraw my hold
For I have, no place within a company of thieves
I turn
And sail away
Sun at my back
Toward my end
This is our demise
The slow decay
As my vessel breaks
Wind tears my sails
I crash, into the ocean
This storm upon me
But amidst the chaos
I find peace
