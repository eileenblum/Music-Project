Left Alone
Echoes bounce around a desolate scene
Before my tired eyes, these empty rooms once so bright
Now lay dormant
I guess that's life
Retreating through a void of resentment
For myself and anything I stand for
I scream at my reflection
Until the glass breaks
Old streets will always sound the same
Highway cars and distant passing lights
Laying here for just a while longer
I'll stare at the stars
Until I hear your name
This world once held beauty
Within the curiosity
Of an innocent mind
Picture frames now vacant
Shadows dance through the age old sills
Generations of memories
Are within these ancient walls
This was the closure
I've been searching for all along
Our mouths sewn shut
Torn in two, against our will.
