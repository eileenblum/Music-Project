You and I
We've been around for a few summers now
In different towns
We still call home
With a lust for adventure
And a fire in our eyes
The burdens in our chests
Keep us alive
We roll on through
Living day to day
With nothing but our names
Guidance seems to grow
Along with the darkness that sleeps
While the sun controls the skies
Can we just stop this loneliness
With the rise and fall of my lungs
I exhale and close my eyes
To live, is to love
To love is to...
Day in and day out
Just existing
With everything to loose
Let's spread our wings and find greatness buried in this earth
Let us bond together
And never remember the wrongs we commit
But learn from those lessons
And search for solitude and peace
With our backs to the sun
To live is to love
To love is to grow
Persistence can overcome anything that you desire most.
Idle hands, grow restless
Our backs to the sun
We set out with the skies to accompany us
Take my hand
We could get lost for years
