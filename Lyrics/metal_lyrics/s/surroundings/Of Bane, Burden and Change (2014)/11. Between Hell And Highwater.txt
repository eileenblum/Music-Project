Live, love, learn
And remember those dear
Forget the failures and push on forward
We step into the nameless
Holding back the potential
To become the ghost
Breathe that cold air
Days spent staring out to sea
In hope of an answer
To my desolation
Questioning the transgression and hollowness
Holding me down is the past that I have orchestrated
The path I have walked alone
Has been my guidance
through the days spent feeling numb
Staring for hours into isolation
Live, love, learn
Shadows shift the light through the windows
They dance with such elegance
Upon the cold ground
Realising that, I have been
Burning this candle at both ends
For far too long
This path I no longer walk alone
Though isolation, has been my guidance for a damned long time
I no longer feel numb
I don't feel numb
Live, love, learn
