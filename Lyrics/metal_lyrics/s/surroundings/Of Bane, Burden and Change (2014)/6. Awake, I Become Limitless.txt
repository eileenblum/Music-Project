Awake,
Feel the blood flow down to your fingertips
Another day spent,
Paying to live with hours of my life
Winters air, chills my bones
Tears away the layers of warmth
I've constructed from destruction
I never want to wake again.
Is this your excuse
Please tell me the truth
Should have never given in to you
On the inside you feel like falling to pieces
Never in this life feel like giving up
Tell me the truth
The truth is
I find no joy in life
Or the prospect of claiming mountains
And carving my name into this world
Standing on the edge of breaking
I suppressed the desire and drive for ambition long ago
I suppressed it long ago
For the first time in months
The air that used to chill my bones
Brings hope
Brings solace
I grow restless
I'll tear right through those mountains
I'll climb to the highest of heights
I'll scream at the sun
I'll scream at the sun
