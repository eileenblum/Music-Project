[feat. Ryan Bowles of Prepared Like A Bride]The sun sets over our forgotten streets
Turning away any chance at hope
Leaving us with nothing to believe in
Moving toward the right direction
I'll carve my own path
I will decide on my own fate
And the roads to take
To get there
Proving to myself, there is
More of a reason, to push forward
And not live in desolation
Letting go of past hurts and sorrow
The path we chose
Is beginning to crack
Beneath our fractured feet
Through clear sight
I'll turn this life around
Stand upon solid ground
And take the path less travelled
I won't be silenced
When stone hits the skin
Lace the, pathway with gold
A life's work, shrouded in grey
Those walls, begin to crumble
Everything we stood for
Now lays in ruin
The sun rises
To turn away the fear
The night sky brings
False truths backed by deceit
I am not ignorant
And I do not wish to be silenced
My voice shall be heard
And I'll remain on my own two feet
My voice shall be heard
Your forever lost, amongst the trees.
