Call me a sceptic
But this life were living in
Is nothing without the will to push forward
The longing desire to be pushed away from everything
To leave this place behind
And transpose to infinity
Abandoning what lies in the wake
Leaving nothing but a memory
Of where I once stood
Never thinking about
The actions that I take
And Consequence that follows
Leaving the rest behind
To dilute in the misery
I am a ghost
Left alone in this world
Product of my choices
You cannot change
That which you refuse to combat
To live in the past
Is to relive and regret
To live in the present
Is to forgive and forget
Let me go
Let me drown
Let me live
Let me breathe
I am not alone
