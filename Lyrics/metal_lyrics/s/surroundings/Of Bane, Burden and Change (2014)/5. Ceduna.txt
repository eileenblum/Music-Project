[feat. Jayme Van Keulen of Statues]Looking back
Reflecting upon the choices we've made
The hardships we claim
We all rely on desire to shape our selfish nature
Obscurities, we find fascinating
Of childhood memories, absence shines through
I stand back and witness this genetic trend.
Forever destroying, what I took for granted
Failure will drag me down
There is no poetry in this
We cannot erase
The experiences
We have been dealt
For it makes us who we are today
Canvas stripped clean,
Erased back to where we began,
Red ink colours the page,
The fire of my mind portrayed across the images we create.
The sunset hits your aged face,
I see the look in your eye,
Once there was an ocean between us,
Now brought together through the dissolution.
Your confidence wavers as you strike a match to light your cigarette. And your hands shake,
And tremble and there,
There aren't any words I can offer.
I swear I know your name.
But it's all for nought,
And I bare this on my own.
Believe in what you say,
It's safer to drive alone.
There's a delicate truth in our words. But so fragile.
And so,
I walk away.
