Each day gets longer
With every movement an agonizing step

We watch with nothing but despair to
Comfort us
Seeing you grow weaker
It Only makes things harder

We are not permanent
But we canât let you go
Not just yet

The scent of rose
Drifts across the room
(the scent of rose)
Our farewell,
Our last remaining embrace

(last embrace)

Your time has come
And we are all weary as the soil covers
Your expanse
Our last remaining visions fade

Gaunt, by blurred eyes

Caused by the never ceasing tears

You will remain
You will remain
You will remain remembered
And not be forgotten
For you are he, who liked the scent of rose

Capturing your life
Being a part of who you were
Makes us who we are today
I'll hold my head high
Knowing that you lived so free
You lived so free

The scent of rose
Drifts across the room
(the scent of rose)
Our farewell,
Our last remaining embrace

(last embrace)

Your time has come
And we are all weary as the soil covers
Your expanse
Our last remaining visions fade
Gaunt, by blurred eyes
