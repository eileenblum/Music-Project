Reveal the poison
Covering
Everything
Like malice gripping it's hand
To choke out impurities
Zig zags coursing through our veins
What stand now to purify
Lead the thoughts just a bit further
To a conclusion you can't deny
It all come to this comes
To what is not defined
What you see worth living for
When death is justified

That's right
Just keep it in
Make sure it hits you right here
Push past the surface and
Reveal the
Fear

[Chorus:]
You act like you've won and
There's Nothing to fear
There's no longer restraints
To hold you here
And I will define
What you'll never be

Never be

That's right
Just keep in
Make sure it hits you right here
Push past the surface and
Reveal the
Fear

[Chorus]

You act like you've won
And theres nothing
To fear
There's not longer restraints
To hold you here
And you'll go on with
Life day by day
Following suit
With the masquerade
