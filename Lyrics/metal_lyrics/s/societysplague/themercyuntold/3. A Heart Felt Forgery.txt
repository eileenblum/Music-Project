Look me in the eyes
When you say those words
Something pure and Just?
No only hurt
Take a leap of faith
Only to fall face down

You showed me yourself
And I watched you fall down
You compromised yourself
And all of your beliefs
For what?

[Chorus:]
Don't follow me
Cause I can see
You're not the one
You claim to be
And I will not falter

I'll watch you drift away
Into your
Own insecurity
And Broken is all you'll be

The words were right
But the intent was flawed now
The time was here
And just as quickly gone

[Chorus]

And I'll watch you bleed for me
And Broken is all you'll be

Look me in the eyes
When you say those words
Something pure and just
No
Only hurt
Take a leap of faith
Only to fall face down

You showed me yourself
And I watched you fall down
You showed me yourself
And I'll watch you bleed for me
