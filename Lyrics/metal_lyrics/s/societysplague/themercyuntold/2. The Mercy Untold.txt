One life and another
Million to lose
This is where it all begins
Think about your life
And everyone you love
What would you
Give up for them?

I'll just ignore the lies
Pretend that it's alright
Just look past your face
I know it's not alright
How can I believe
In something that seems so naive
When even my own truths
Seem only to deceive
Me and I
Don't know
Where to hide
Just keep on running until
The thought subside
One more seconds gone
Another moment lost
Just think what could've been
But never mind the cost

I'll just ignore the lies
Pretend I know what's right
Even though I know
That I can't win this fight
The gears that turn with
A ticking vengeance in mind
Forcing bliss on us all
The echoes far behind

What is there to lose
You cannot stop these hands
Collecting on the debt that
Every life demands
So take advantage of
The time that we have left
Before your time will come

[Chorus]
To watch it all fall down
As it all fades away
Where do we go now
When we should have
Held on
But what matters now
As it all fades away
And the hand stops

I'll just ignore the lies
Pretend that it's alright
I'll just look past your face
I know it's not alright
Just let it go
Just let it go
Sit here and Wait
I know how hard
Is is to look past this
For something more to believe
and not my own

[Chorus]

You cannot stop
These hand from ticking away
They're counting down
Counting Down
