Local offerings did not suffice 
Bastards ruined this world
Torrent of hate is on its way
All that will survive are the ones who ruled before

Undead calling humming in our ears 
"The mindless bastards' way must come to an end"
Distorted thoughts of paralyzing force
The path is clear for me
The massage inked with blood

When the death is feeling near
And the black blood embarks 
The doom of man so clear
I will remember the day they rise

Diabolic, ancient spheres of hate

The oath is signed with blood 
We are the nameless ones
Raised for all to see
The punishers unleashed

Armageddon shall start here
