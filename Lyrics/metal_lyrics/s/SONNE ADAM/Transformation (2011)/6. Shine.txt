Underground, amidst society 
There we are lurking, regaining form
Violently through ancient rites

See the banner of hatred rise
Hear the cries of Jehovah's whores 
On with the battle, no remorse 
Ignoring proclaimed emotions 
Through our eyes hate will shine

Now you weep
Your tormented soul is mute
The end of preaching 
We ram your teeth inside
Taste our hate, for our hate will finally
Drain your life away
