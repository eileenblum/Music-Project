Beyond this realm lies the throne of the tyrants and slaves
Righteous drip the meaning of suffering, pain, torment and death

The skies were always dark
But the stars blinded their sight
The graves so deep, their numbers are vast
When the righteous dream they speak our name with tongues 

We who worship the black
The emperor's throne will fall into our grasp

We see inside their suffering
Beyond reasoning and doubts 
The sky was always darkened, Their light was just a lie
The truth revealed in flames
Our aeon has begun

We arise into their harts where there was a void
When their eyes are coming clear they will see hate
Our worlds will penetrate, spirit free inside
Now they see their darkest path
The age of blackened hate has begun

We who worship the black 
It dwells inside, forever breeding mankind
