Through the air and sand time will arouse
Spirits of justice, crushers of the thrones
For too long the farce has taken place
The snakes of hatred have been set free

Rage circling the mind
The key of blasphemy is at hand
Open the gates, set him free
The circle gathers once more

Stricken, pounded to a void
Chanceless against his might

The fear of man now reality
Our absence of caring makes you condemned

Finally he walks among us
To command our thoughts
Possessed I sing his words

The final day has arrived 
Upon your doom we thrive
