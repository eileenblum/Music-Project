See the fools that walks the earth as blind
Watch them dying rotting in the ground
the call you hear, the sights you see
Salvation of mankind through darkened ecstasy

Burn the land and let the flames fly high
Let the black smoke fill the sky
Choke the idols, block the sun
Let the era of enlightenment arise

Sacrifice all the living so the sky 
will be black and starless
Let their screams fill your head with bliss
The dying moans from heaven
Set the black blood land in flames 

There is no place for your god today
For there is nothing to behold in darkness
Take trip inside your mind
Can you see the truth revealed

We bring the message of despair and death
And through the fire the cleansing will begin
Choke the idols, block the sun
Let the era of enlightenment arise

An age of terror has been set
The age of tyranny is upon 
You will be cleansed by fire
Dust will cover holy lands

The demolition is complete
Feral victory achieved 

Now the massage is conceived at last 
Drowned in flames your soul is pulverized
Crush all morals, meet your doom
As our hammer of justice will strike

There are no survivors, no one shall escape
Drums of war tremble the earth once more
Choke the idols, block the sun
Let the era of enlightenment arise
