Carry him inside 
Listen to his words of wisdom
see his truth is absolute
His eyes so dark
They stare from beyond

The path is a test for the followers beyond death
to see the reality you must leave the flesh behind

Many corpses found nearly rotten
Every one of them appearing no inside my dreams
Their eyes so dark
they watch me from beyond

I summon the elder one into the circle
Appear before me I command

The ground shatters as I whisper the spell
The sky is darkened in this blessed day
A gate opens to this world
From beyond the stars they come
The day of doom begun
Swarming death will spread like fire
Fire burns the sky

Their screams echoes the night
All of their kind possessed
Human forms evolves into brain dead slaves
