Can you see your grave as you walk into the future
Can you see the skin to an empty shell
Beyond the flesh lies nothing

The scars you carry
Will they feed the living
Will your shadow hunt them
Beyond your living days

Time grow shorter and shorter
Lust is faded, forgotten
My legacy will cast upon all that is living
Every time I die I claim my birth in blood
