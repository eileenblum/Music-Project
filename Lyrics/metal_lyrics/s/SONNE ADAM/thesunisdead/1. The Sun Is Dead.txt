As I rose
From the slumber of ages
I witnessed the source of life
Shining for aeons
Fueled by hatred
Hailing the end of life
And the cycle of earth
I shall procreate my sins

So I pray
For the darkened clouds to cover the sun

Determined I prevailed and conquered
Once again life has ceased, the sun is dead
My emotions are long gone
No remorse - nothing human inside
