A spawn has risen from the vermin inside my tomb
Many many years in the future
He returned to the point where it all began
Reborn in my image somewhere back in time
I gaze the living from the beyond, my form does not belong to me anymore

Trapped in his shadow
I watch and remember unspeakable deaths
Cries crafted by a claw
And yet I ravish in my insanity
The spawn, my king is darkness incarnate
Enslaver of men
And where he walks
The ground turns to nothing again

Hater of mankind
Summoner, dark the sky

I am him, the deceiver
Trapped but yet i am free
From death I escaped, chained in immortality

Hater of mankind
Summoner, dark the sky
