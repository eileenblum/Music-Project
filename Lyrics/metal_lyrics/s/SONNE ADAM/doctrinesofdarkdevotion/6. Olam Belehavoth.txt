Black, his eyes were black, yet aware to this world
The deceiver of the desolations, the bringer of death

I will follow his call
Set the fire in the temple
Cast the flames into your scars
Relive the pain of the ages

His dedicated and passionate disciples
Followed the call from beyond
Into a future and despair
Into the endless chamber caves
Where they stare into their hollow form
And their blood flows through the stone

Sorrow may lead the blind into darkness
But with conviction I carved my way through their flesh
Their path to a great nothing, my destiny into the stars

I will follow his call
The flames, a testimony of glory
The temple remains on the blood-red soil
Here he stands before you, the bringer of death
