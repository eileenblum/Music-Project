Born to live as a shadow of the might
Born to live as a serpent of a dying light
Behind his eyes there is a serpent thrive in chaos
He never fell from the heavens above
Nor did he case out, he chose the fall

Black is the vision
As he rides, the night sky greets him with a storm
The left hand path, a fall into the darkness
And into glory, glory and might
He who once fell from heaven's grace
Shall rise again to conquer the sky
Reborn improved, all actions made, a part of the master plan

He climbs within an endless circle
Stare through a blood red mask
He who chose to rot, shall rise again as gods
