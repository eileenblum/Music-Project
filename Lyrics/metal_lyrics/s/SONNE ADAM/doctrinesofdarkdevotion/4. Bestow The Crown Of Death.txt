Aeons decayed the life
In prenumbra I lay my coffin
Banished, I am the illusionist
Devoted in eternal persuasion

Alas, your eternal fate
Of tragedies
A call to atonement
Through fire it shall pass

salvation comes like plague
Obey all laws of disease
And when reality shows
Its abysmal form
You will be conscious of
The war of your inner self

With pride you tend to accept
The crown of death
To end all ridicule
I shall rot in my tomb

Salvation comes like plague
Obey all laws of disease
