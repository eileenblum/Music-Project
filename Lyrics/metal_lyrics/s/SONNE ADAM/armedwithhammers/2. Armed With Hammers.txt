Rotting existence of malicious domains
Defined by mortals and slaves

A place where screams
Echo the night
And the day is gone
For eternity

Drowning in your sea of sins

We come to end the reign
Armed with hammers

We come to end
The reign of man
Armed with hammers
Hate and might
