Evil omens
Shall praise the end
Evil omens
Spoken from a sole mind
Sickening yet true
My words of undone hatred are seizing me

Ash and dead remains
Prepare to meet your rivals
Battle of the ages is at hand
Reflect the darkness into the seeds

Blood of the holy ones
With blood I mark the way of the unclean

Swift thoughts of darkness
Out of the body
Into the void
