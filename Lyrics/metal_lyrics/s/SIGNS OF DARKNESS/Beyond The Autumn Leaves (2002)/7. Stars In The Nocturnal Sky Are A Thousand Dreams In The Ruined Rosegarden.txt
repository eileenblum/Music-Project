In darkness the moon rises, and lights up the valley. 
Iced mountains and frozen springs, 

echos run through the forest, where a river of grief glows. 
Snow and frost covers the landscape with a grim dark smile.

Thousand years of torture for the souls in the twilight zone. 
Stars in the nocturnal sky are like a thousand screams. 
An icon of never dreamed dreams. 
Damned until the end of times.

This eternal winter
please let me die, 

indepible grief.

Close your burning eyes and sink with me, 
now the sun has left my life. Forever grief. 

Snow has covered my heart for good, for good.

Cherish me, oh let this be. 
Look at me, I desired thee. 
Lonely cold dark sympathy.
Lonely cold dark sympathy.

Swallow me, oh let that be. 
You're the one, you said to me. 
I feel love surrounding thee, 
breaking weaves of apathy.

In the night the sky is full of stars, 
those thousand screams. 
As tears fall its black and darkness 
rules my heart and hunts.

It's like a romance in december, 
in the heart of an eternal winter. 
She was mortal, 
a beauty unique.
