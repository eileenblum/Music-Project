Feel my love, feel my hate. 
Feel my pain, deep down inside. 
Down inside of me, my heart's grieving
Down inside of me, my soul is greiving

I know I'm shattered by the night that's gone 
I want to see inside of you. 
I know I have to live this life without you 
I want to be inside of you.

It's like a mirror 
calling from that wall. 
But I can't see my face. 
Only your reflecting embrace.

Do you feel pain for someone else's joy? 
Do you feel my mother depth? 
My nocturnal depth.

The night has come. 
If like candles blown out by the winds. 
The winds of agony, of pain 
howling from islands of misery, of happiness (yet they are my islands). 
From depth's to... depths of my heart. 
My mother depth.

No, not one moment in this night may be unused. 
No, not one star will be unrecognized... 

Yes...
they are far away from the sun. 
Far away from the moon. 
But are they not as distant 
as that from us?

O come my friend... 
can I call you friend? 
Can I call you that.... 

What? you'll reply... 
can I call you depth.... 
my mother depth?
