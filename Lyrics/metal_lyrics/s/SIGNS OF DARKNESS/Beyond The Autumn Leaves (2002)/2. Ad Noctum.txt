Let me into your arms, 
let me wander through your thoughts. 
Open your heart and seeâ¦ 
these winds of passion from me. 

The morning sun is not for me, 
this is the night of the last caress. 
Please give meâ¦ oh give meâ¦ 
tenderness.

The night shall take away the pain, the fear for life. 
The stars shall guide his way. 
The night shall take away the pain, the fear for life. 
His dreams shall never come again.

Ad noctumâ¦ thatâs where he shall stay. 
Ad noctumâ¦ where he shall stay.

Walking in rain of tears towards, oblivion. 
In my imagination we are as one. 
Lost in this world of so called, divinity. 
Aloneâ¦ not yet broken.

Bring forth the days of eternal sunset 
and let it fade through the fingers of loneliness. 
Bring forth the days of slumbering rain and howling winds.

Enterâ¦ drunk with fire, 
the place where magic moments join again. 
Far above the stars, 
where the weeping turns into numband, 
where gentle wings 
spread in itâs glorious firmament. 
Feel the serpent fangs, 
bend into the of faith of meaningless words.

Hear the venomous voice whispering. 
Seering through the airâ¦
Emerge into darkness 
and rise above the ancient sky.
