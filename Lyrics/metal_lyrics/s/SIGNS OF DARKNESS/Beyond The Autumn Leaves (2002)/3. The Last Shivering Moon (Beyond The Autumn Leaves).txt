Close your deep dark soul 
and dance with me 
underneath the ancient trees 
of the sleeping forest, 

where shadows return to the eternal night. 
I cry alone 
and remember that long last kiss.

To feel the silence 
I walked into the mind of the lonely one, 
and once again 
it made me mortal.

The weeping angels cry along. 
Thorns captured the iced sun. 

The stars screamed together. 
Never was pain so close to fear.

Oh.... I find myself
lying in a bed of autumn leaves. 
Screaming for grief. 
Screaming for the one I was.

Oh.... I find myself
bleeding to death, waiting. 
My eyes filled with emptiness. 
My leaving soul freezes.
The touch of God is as cold as ice, 
my leaving soul freezes. 
And I fear... I fear.... 
I saw the last sunset forever.

The last shivering moon shines on my body. 
Primal fears at the end of life. 
My mind dwells in thoughts and memories.

Deep within my heart, I feel the sorrow. 
Deep within my soul, I feel the fear.

The portal opens in harmony with misery. 
This is the last of me that shall rest here.

Last emotions flow away. 
My eyes slowly close. 
My last breath finds his way, 
into the lonely night.
