L'amour et la haine, les vivants et les morts
Everything I'll remember will be lost in the gates of eternity

Forever I'll be there, until death takes us apart
mon amour, ma haine, your affection and torture
Our souls are bound by the blood of our eternal love
The desire for my bride is the pain of (the) unknown presence

Her lips, your kiss, the world may burn, but I'll
be there, always,... standing for you
Embraced by dreams, beyond love... a kiss of
sorrow and grief

"And the sun dies, there will never be another dawn
The sun is the blood red earth... The night has become
eternal... Once there was spring, now
an everlasting winter"

"In the twilight the shadows die, where angels once
where mist, my heart filled fear,
my bride stolen, become a bride of evil..."

"Hear me, Fenris, I have the sword with powers
unknown... made by the forest, the spirits and nymphs"

The sky turned black, snow feld down
Darkness marchess the earth
my ice-shaped heart melts

In a battle with night and day, darkness
concours me, chaos ruled
The flight remained for seven days
Domination of a world unknown

In the battle I killed him, his bleeding corpse burned
and I embraced my bride...
Embraced by dreams, beyond love
A kiss of sorrow and grief
