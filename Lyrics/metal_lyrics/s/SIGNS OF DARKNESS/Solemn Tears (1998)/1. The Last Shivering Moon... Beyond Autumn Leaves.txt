Close your deep dark soul and dance with me
underneed the ancient trees of the sleeping forest
Where shadows return to the eternal fright
I cry alone and remember that long last kiss
To feel the silence, I walked into the mind
of the lonely one, once again it made me mortal
The weeping angels cry along
Throns captured the iced sun
The stars dreamed together
never was pain so close to fear

Oh,... I find myself,
lying in a bed of autumn leaves
screaming for my grief
screaming for the one I was

Oh,... I find myself,
bleeding to death, waiting
my eyes, filled with emptiness
my soul,... leaves me

The touch of God is cold as ice
my leaving soul freezes...
and I fear...
I fear I saw the last sunset ever
the last shivering moon shines on
my body
Primal fears at the end of life
my mind dwells in toughts and
memories

Deep within my heart
I feel the sorrow
Deep within my soul
I feel the fear

The portal opens in harmony with misery
This will the last of me to rest here

Last emotions flow away
my eyes slowly close
my last breath finds his way
into the lonely night...
