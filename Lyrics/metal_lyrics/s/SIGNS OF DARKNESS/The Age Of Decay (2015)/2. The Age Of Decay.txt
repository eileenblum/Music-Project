This is the age, the age of decay
The age of decay
One world, one song
Descend into the hollow-hearted soul-departed once more

The age of emperors

One word, one song
For the way of tears
Transcend the Rubicon
Shallow life for the signs of darkness

Penitentia agite
La morte est supra nobis
Penitentia agite
Towards the nebular blizz

Penitentia agite
La morte est supra nobis
Penitentia agite
The denie

For the coming of chaos
For the raise of the end
For the flames in the fire
This is the age of decay
