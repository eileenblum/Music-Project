"I'm a New Age Nomad"... "No, you are not"

From out the digital towers in white, a scream hunts silently through the night
It tells us the story of a portable linguistic attitude
Post ironically events
The immene spectrum
The rise and ruin of that day

Out of that fantasy, this illustre blond girl created that open public toyland
Digitally constructed buildings
Broad spectrum antibiotics

Unsatisfied after intense nudity
Bleeding questions at the end of the tunnel

"I'm a New Age Nomad"... "On this moment, you are"...

At the end of the tunnel, only one question survives: "Will I overcome this shame when I touch your screen?"
