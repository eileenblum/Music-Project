Lost in this world, no more emotions
Can't find the things that sculptured my soul

Hear the questions from the heart, search the answers on my face
I said (I think): "I'll never walk away from you"
But you did, again and again

Can you forgive me, the mistakes I am
Can you give me what I always needed

"Feel this, what is it"
"It's my heart and its broken by you"

Lost in this world, only one more emotion
I found that thing that sculptured my soul
