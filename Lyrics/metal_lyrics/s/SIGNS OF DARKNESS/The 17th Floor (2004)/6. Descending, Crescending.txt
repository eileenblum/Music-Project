Mesmerizing thoughts, the eternal butterfly effect
Descending, crescending neon light entertainment
The lost Pearl Harbour entity
I finally found some space between the desert waters and the oily battlefields

[1]
The concrete I'm cruising, the freezing highway
To wash our hands in ebony coloured water
The concrete I'm surfing over crowded places
To clean my soul... is only one enough?

[2]
Soul descendants, spiral architects running late into the night
Ghostly evidence of a portrait created out of mists and raining tears
Early morning, late night neon light adventures
Scarring the wirth man in the black dress, pulling the rope

Maximalizing pain, onwards salvation

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]
