Welcoming the elevator light from the 17th floor
They're marked in grey essence blurring
Twisted in doubt-soft contact turning
The earth awaits-for that it's craving

Tears for fears-fear your tears
Laugh inside-inside your laughs
Pure fantasies-fantasies are pure
Awaiting the third-the third awaiting

At this time the story was told about a man and a girl so cold
For her the essence is that, the fact she needs a manin her bed
"living this life", she says, "earning money for the love instead"
This is it, she always needs, with this she loves the ones she feeds

Bitterness unfolding, tears weeping, the new world essence shining
Performing live, feelings feeding the emptiness inside of you

Welcoming the elevator light from the 17th floor
They're marked in grey essence- visions are blurring
