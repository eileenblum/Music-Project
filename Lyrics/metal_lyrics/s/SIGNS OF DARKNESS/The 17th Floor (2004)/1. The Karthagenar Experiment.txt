The Karthagenar experiment unfolds the new millennium.
The clash upon the four shores,
In this little human sculpture
Morphological disasters, endlessly carrying...

Faceless mirrors beyond the burden of time
This critically ill world carrying thousands of them
Faced towards only one end-point
This miscouraged minds, overwhelming desires
Enter this open public toyland

Sea of dream painted dogma's, a whirlpool of non-identified flying words
Thoughts, miscouraged minds, powerful forces expiring hate in untasteful sentences

Moreover, I bend to the floor, kissing the feet of this blond girl
Yet to construct an artwork in grey

Published data on computers, pure portable public powers

The Karthagenar experiment unfolds
