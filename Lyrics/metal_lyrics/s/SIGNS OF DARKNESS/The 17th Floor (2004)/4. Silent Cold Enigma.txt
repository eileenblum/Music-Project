Scarring the circle of dreams and trading the passion of beauty for an emptiness wandering in the evergrey

Forever lost in the spiral, oh so black
Buried but conscience in a grave of illusions
See what circles above and drowns in misery
The crimsons sky that thou once loved, expel your ancient story

"Oh wandering, slumbering sky, forsaken is your graps
I descend into the rippling pond, the stars my faithful guide"

Aligned with tears the soul beholds the tragedy and the cold sting of th lake, her breath, her touch, a stone upon the shore
Foundations lie beneath me as the sky betrays my final thoughts
The enigma of this deep dark end, will carry me once again

"White feathers towards the pantheon, song unsung from the timeless Meridian
March into the creation of the Eyeless Ophidian"

A sense of godless truth surrounded by infinite seas
Midnight mists, areas in black, do not crawl around my back

Oh hope for light shines bright; not in this heart of stone, but in this head it mourns
