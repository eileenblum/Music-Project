The colour of evil and disease
It can by so beautiful
Every day a passion to see
Not crave to be mine

The warm desire of the heart
Irresistible for me
I see the blackened rose
My passions may not be
My mind is creeping
Immortal love

The colour of evil and disease
It can be so beautiful
Every day a passion to see
Not crave to be mine

The warm desire of the heart
Irresistible for me
I see the blackened rose
My passions may not be
My mind is creeping
Immortal love

I'm inconsolable
