In the shades of the moon the plain whispers
The creeping mist, unveiling winter
Black chantings enshrined in the hearts of the ancients
Their souls untouched by the words of the

Prophets of the light
The temptation of Christ
Our traditions return
Battles to restore

The plain recalls the smell of war, the taste of blood
The war-cry brought back by the mighty raven
Listen to the sound of the howling winds
Towards the wintry sky she rides

"I call the raven upon me, just like in ancient times
Behind the battle I see her, she's the driver of the coach
Just like the raven, I'm marked by signs of his horns
And for the raven of the battlefields the legend will not fall

Thorns of grief entwined by the moonlight glimmer
My blood and tears blend into one another

The warrior occurs his journey to the village from where
He was banned, the sound of the raven strengthens his
Desire, his beloved, his only son marks his grief

Am I mortal is it my soul that shall behold the highest
Truth, or is it my body that shall reach the red sky

"As darkness slips away, the nightmare will occur
By dawn he sees the eternal snow between the trees
The mist, the raven, the river...
The empire of the sleeping forest"

Marks in the snow, the river cries
The sky turned red, his beloved dies
Black chantings enshrined in the heart of the ancient
His soul untouched by the words of the

Prophets of the light
The temptation of Christ
Our traditions return
Battles to restore

The plain recalls the smell of war, the taste of blood
The creeping mist, unveiling winter
Frozen by grief he kneels besides the river
The countess lures him into her shooting arms...

Together they ride towards the wintry sky
