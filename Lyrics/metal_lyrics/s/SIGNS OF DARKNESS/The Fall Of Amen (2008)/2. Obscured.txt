Obscured bye the hands that will unlock this shrine.
Obscured by visions in ice, the hand that is divine.
Obscured bye the hands that will unlock this shrine, the hand that is divine.

Thousand of flags waving in the night,
survivals in the community of war.
With the soul instead of heart departed,
the man in sin, si marked in hatred.

Temptress shiver as he will rise.
Watch out for images in ice.
Temptress caress my eternal life.
Watch out for the dancing knife.

He's alone not knowind why these hauting screams are following him.
For the years have passed, the screams are stronger, he's locked inside.
They are alone not knowing why he's hunting them down.

Obscured bye the hands that will unlock this shrine.
Obscured by visions in ice, the hand that is divine.
Obscured bye the hands that will unlock this shrine, the hand that is divine.

Thousand of flags waving in the night,
survivals in the community of war.
With the soul instead of heart departed,
the man in sin, si marked in hatred.
