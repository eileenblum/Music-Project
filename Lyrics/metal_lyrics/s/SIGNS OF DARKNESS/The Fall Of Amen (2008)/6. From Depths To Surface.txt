Scarred and so we are marked. The red, the sky, the crimson divine.
Dark, the eye, the lies are forsaken by the grand and grotesque.

Search for the divinity divine, we are the cameleon's inside.
Hiede yourself in colourful farewells, the poison envy's you.

Welcome searing dark, home of all and nothing.
My mercuy mind reflects the dead eyes.
Well performed, a unique dance,
Into the well of purity.
