There aher those one's that are condemned for the lust for death, 
throygh the gates they enter the garden of Eden.

Invade the world with a serpent's tonque.
Bring foeth the war against uniformity and lies.
Analyse the essence, the secrets of lust and despair.

There aher those one's that are condemned for the lust for death,
through the gates and crush the garden of Eden.

TAste the tears, listen to the words.
The stars, the ancient awakened.
Prophets of emptiness listen to the voices.
embraced by the hunger for fear.

Stand up and march for thes essence in life.
The serpent's lament hear it all and sing.
Our voices carried and spread by the winds.
Before our feel the age unfolds again.

There aher those one's that are condemned for the lust for death, 
Through the gates and the age unfolds.
