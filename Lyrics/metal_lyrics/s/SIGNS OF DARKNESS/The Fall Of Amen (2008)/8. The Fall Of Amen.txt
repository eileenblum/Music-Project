Welcome this bitter ending at the end of all wars.
Battles over ages, all believers scream for remorse.
Warriors for honour and prife, watch them fall like stars.
Enter the tunnel of howling winds, riding storms.

Depressed are the sick on a joourney to another world.
With a funeral face. I'm full of sin but no remorse.
hear the voice in my head, screaming for liberation.

Embedded in a world of mysterious feelings,
taken form faliing memories.
Dark little voice driving you inside,
creating a war full of emotions.

The Fall of Amen.

Welcome this bitter ending at the end of all wars.
Battles over ages, all believers scream for remorse.
Warriors for honour and prife, watch them fall like stars.
Enter the tunnel of howling winds, riding storms.
