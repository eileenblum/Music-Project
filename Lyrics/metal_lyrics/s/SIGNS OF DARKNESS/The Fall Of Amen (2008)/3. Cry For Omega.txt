Impulse to action, Burning from thoughts to flesh.
Deep crimson and the darkest blak, it ends like this.

"Are you trascending?"
"Go into hiding, please!"
"Are you trascending?"
"Left flames hide my smile!"

Impulse to action, Burning from thoughts to flesh.
Deep crimson and the darkest blak, it ends like this.

Cry for the insane, crush through the barricades.
Astral physics, the meaningful vapour.
Watch the immense storms, coming for you!

Impulse to action, Burning from thoughts to flesh.
Deep crimson and the darkest blak, it ends like this.

"Are you trascending?"
"I travelled only in grey, i'm Omega"
"Are you trascending?"
"ou found the nomad, nomad no more"

Impulse to action, Burning from thoughts to flesh.
Deep crimson and the darkest blak, is time to disconnect.
