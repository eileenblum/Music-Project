Envy is unable to be decoded.
You' re willing, the earth 's spinning.
Changing for the worls 's spinning.
You' re willing, the aerth 's spinning.

Decoding the essence, the matrix of solitude.
Correlations, escryptions in the cold ebony oak.

Soft contact, fading, disappearing, loneliness.
Survivors of this world wide war.

Decoding the essence, the matrix of solitude.
Correlations, escryptions in the cold ebony oak.

Do not forget the pictures scarved in your soul.
Survivors of this world wide war.

Envy is unable to be decoded.
The eyes they are something to belueve in; "Let's get cold".
Changing, for the worls 's turning.
Punish this feeble rece; "Let's get old".
