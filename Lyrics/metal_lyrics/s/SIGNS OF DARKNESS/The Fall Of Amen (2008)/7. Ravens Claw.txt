Flying towarsd the wintry sky, these wings embracing the morning light.
Wandering about the ancient spells taht where cast onto these men.

Somewhere between these millions of men, there's this one who holds the key.
Who sings the songs of hate ad fear, markedby the sound of sorrow.
The gates of torment and misery will open for him.
Survivors on this wicked world behold his haunting scream.

I was born in the year of the devilish one.
We are the stronger ones.
Here we gather, those wicked one who stands beside you
Watching the eveningsun, crying this misery song.
We were born in the yar of devilish one.
I'm the stronger one.

Somewhere between these millions of men, there's this one who holds the key.
Survivals on this wicked world behold his haunting scream.

Flying towarsd the wintry sky, these wings embracing the morning light.
Wandering about the ancient spells taht where cast onto these men.
