Hear the cry of the insane crushedby the hammer of loneliness.
the frozen ones underneath in the surface.
Cold and broken, seduced by the voicesof suffering, behold the morning madness.

The water inside, divine as the chalice.s wine.
The ice above, unvreakable as the chains of faith.

The eyes gazing in depths for a hundred years more,
from heart and sou departed, crying the song of misery.
Soldiers od hate waving the banners of victory
Riding onwards the glorious sunset.

Suffer, the world will not be spoken.
The voice of them have been banned forever.
Try to summon the forces of nature to be free.
The season will not listen to the song of defeat.

Hear the cry of the insane crushedby the hammer of loneliness.
the frozen ones underneath in the surface.
Cold and broken, seduced by the voicesof suffering, behold the morning madness.

The water inside, divine as the chalice.s wine.
The ice above, unvreakable as the chains of faith.
