listen to the music when the fair is in town,
lovely little fools and the crowd all around,
watch out for the old man at the edge of the way
who sells these little things that you need every day:

war, sin, vanity, the tragedy within.

watch these little creatures run and creep everywhere.
horrible features that amuse, noone cares.
there's another old man at the edge of the way
who sells these little things that you need every day:

war...
