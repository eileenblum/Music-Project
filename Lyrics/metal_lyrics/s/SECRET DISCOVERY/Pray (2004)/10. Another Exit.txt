my heart beats faster,
the world is turning round and round,
the edge comes closer,
another exit to be found,

my voice sounds weaker,
I call your name but you don't hear,
feel like an angel,
I'm flying...

high, so deep inside me,
retrace my whole life
to remind myself of you.

I'm falling deeper,
no way to stop, no place to hide,
here where I go now
just trying to reach the other side
two worlds colliding,
took one step back got further down,
feel like an angel,
I'm flying...

high, ...
