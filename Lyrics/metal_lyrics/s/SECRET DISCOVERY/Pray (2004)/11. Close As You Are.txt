I see you lying in the sun,
I thought to love you could be fun,
I like to watch you come along.

you seemed to be the queen of all the queens,
I don't know if you really know what it means,
I wish you could be mine tonight.

I know nothing more to say,
I wait for a better day,
I know there's nothing more to do.

close as you are now (so close but still far away),
I feel far to far away from what I love.

I see you dancing in the dawn,
it hurts, just another thorn, so close to me, yet still alone.
my blood boiling in my veins, I hope for another chance,
I think you won't come back no more.

I know...
