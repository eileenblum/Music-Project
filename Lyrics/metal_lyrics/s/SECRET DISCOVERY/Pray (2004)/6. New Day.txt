I see the tears inside your eyes
I did never want to disappoint you
too many rules too many lies
I know someday I'll miss you
but I don't wanna be one of you

I don' wanna lose you
and I don't want to lose control
I just want to hold you
to feel a new day

so many places left to go
so much misunderstandings
there's so much left I want to know
I know someday I'll miss you
but I don't wanna be one of you

I don' wanna lose you
and I don't want to lose control
I just want to hold you
to feel a new life...
