today is a good day to remember
I see the clouds are moving fast
I know the world is changing every single day
then I look back, look in your eyes
and smile...

you want some of this, some of that
you want it all and nothing less
you are so young, you are too young to know...
some of this, some of that
nothing more and nothing less
you are so young, you are too young to know...
the time

I know the day will come to tell you
I know the time will come to explai
Iknow you've got the right to know just who I am
and I'll be there, always for you,
I swear!

you want some of this...

look at me I'm here to come
I've been waiting far too long
all the words have to be spoken
look at me Im standing here
to face the day that's coming near
nothing more has to be broken

you want some of this...
