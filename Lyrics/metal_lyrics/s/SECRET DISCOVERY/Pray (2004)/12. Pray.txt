nothing will be the same, everything's gonna change,
I will never forget your face.
I won't forget the time, such moments hard to find,
hand in hand with you into the light.
so many things to feel, but which of them are real,
what are words, when you lose your aim?
so many things to do, but which of them are true?

nothing will start again, everything's got an end,
in my heart you will ever last.
I won't forget the days, in my memories sleeps the trace
of a wonderful, wonderful past.
so many ways to talk, so many ways to walk
just to carry away the dark.
so many things to do, but which of them are true?

leave me here and go away for the last time,
leave me now and let me pray for the last time...
