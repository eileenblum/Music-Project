You and I, me and you
At the point of no return
Love is a lie, love is blue
And the blue things never burn
Who's gonna catch you when you fall?
The frozen stars above
Keep on shining on to you

We're moving down, down down
And the world keeps turning
On just from the start
I keep my favorite moments
Deep inside my heart

Jesus Christ, neon lights
And a call from outer space
Throughout romance, hold me tight
While the falseness burns my faith
Believe in television lies
Like action movie heroes
Waiting for a happy end

We're moving down, down down
And the world keeps turning
On just from the start
I keep my favorite moments
Deep inside my heart

Inside my heart
