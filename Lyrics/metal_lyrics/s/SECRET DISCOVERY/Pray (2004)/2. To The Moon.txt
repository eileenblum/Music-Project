the night is smooth, the shades are grey
the city lights shining on my way
just like a child the day is getting old
and in the sky I see your face in gold

I pray to the moon
I pray to any star above
I pray to the moon
pray to your heart

when darkness reigns and daylight fades
I walk this way, passing through the gates
I smell the trees, the wind is blowing strong
and what I feel tonight keeps me going on

I pray to the moon
I pray to any star above
I pray to the moon
shine in my heart

the night is fading
the sun appears
goodbye my darling
hello my fears

I pray to the moon...
