I remember days
We used to dance barefoot on the graves
Talk about love and future
Finally waiting for another winter
I remember times
We felt sorry about the things we love
About crimes we didn't commit
Just to be guilty for anything

What are you looking for
What is it worth
Was it really worth
What do you think?

Everything
Everything everything changes
Everything
Everything everything changes
But I always stay the same

I remember signs we didn't want to see
Friends we didn't want to lose
Goals unable to reach, we lost
While living somebody else's live
Longing for the day to come
When nothing really matters anymore...

What are you looking for
What is it worth
Was it really worth
What do you think?

Everything
Everything everything changes
Everything
Everything everything changes
But I always stay the same
