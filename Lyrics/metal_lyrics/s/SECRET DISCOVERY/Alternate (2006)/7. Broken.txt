Now I'm here to start again
To come back where it all begun
I try to walk but still I'm weak
Now I'm aching just to achieve
I feel tied but not alone
Finally I am my every home
With every demon who lives within
As my companion to lead me in

I was afraid to break again
For every demon lives within
I was trying to hide
All the pain in my head
But now it's all I got as a friend

When everything's broken
No word left unspoken
And I'm trapped to the end
My heart can be stolen
But love's left unbroken
I can face it again

All the lights went down on me
Only shadows surrounding me
I've lost control in every sin
Now I'm wondering how to begin
I feel tied but not alone
I follow the traces that I know
With every scar across my heart
As an award for another start

I was afraid to break again
For every demon lives within
I was trying to hide
All the pain in my head
But now it's all I got as a friend

My doors are open
For love left unbroken
From a spark to a flame
My heart can be stolen
But love's left unbroken
I will face it again
(I was trying to hide
All the pain in my head)
I will face it again
(I was trying to hide
All the pain in my head)
