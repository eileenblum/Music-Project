The second time
No need to be afraid
Even if I'd loose
No other way I'd ever choose
But I'm still bleeding
A perfect kiss
Is all it ever takes
This secret bliss
I'll never take it from your heart
But I'm still bleeding

Is it better to walk away
Than to fight another day
Than to keep all your ideals
You'd loose the other way
Is it better to walk away
Than to blow all your fears
...Away

A different view
Coming from inside
I cheat myself
Just to pretend to be the same
But I'm still bleeding
A crying heart
Being blessed for more
Hurting still
Forever leading me astray
But it's still beating

Is it better to walk away
Than to fight another day
Than to keep all your ideals
You'd loose the other way
Is it better to walk away
Than to blow all your fears
...Away
