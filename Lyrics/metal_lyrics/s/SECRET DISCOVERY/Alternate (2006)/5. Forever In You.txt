Never cry for love that's dead
Since love is seldom true
Changing his fashion from blue to red
From brightest red to blue
Love was born to an early death
And is so seldom true
What affection you prefer
I give it all to you

But you should know to carry the things
That you love in your heart
And you should try to keep it all...

Forever in you
All the tears that cannot lie
Forever in you
All your fire that cannot die
Forever in you
Try to keep it all inside
Try to keep your dreams alive
Try to keep it all inside
Forever in you

The prettiest smile you can afford
To win the deepest sigh
The fairest words on truest lies
Pass on and surely die
You will stand alone, my dear
When the day turns into the night
And you will see the things so clear
When black turns into white

But you should know to carry the things
That you love in your heart
And you should try to keep it all...

Forever in you
All the tears that cannot lie
Forever in you
All your fire that cannot die
Forever in you
Try to keep it all inside
Try to keep your dreams alive
Try to keep it all inside
Forever in you

You should know, and you should try
Forever in you
You should know, and you should try
Forever in you
