You got to rise me up
You got to bring me down
You got to feed my soul
You got to break it all in two
I need to feel you now
I want to touch your skin
I like to see your face
I want your heart to let me in

And I would lie for you
Forever be your sin
And I would die for you
Would be the trap to drag you in
Just for a while, a lifelong while

Did anyone believe
Did anybody say
That anyone around here
Is just feeling the same way?

You got to wake me up
You got to spin me round
You got to break the ice
You got to tear it all apart
I would betray myself
And I would be your dog
Would be the one to blame
'Cause you're the sweetest judge to me
Just for a while, a lifelong while

Did anyone believe
Did anybody say
That anyone around here
Is just feeling the same way?
