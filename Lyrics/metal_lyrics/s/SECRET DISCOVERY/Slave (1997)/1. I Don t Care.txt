The same old words, but I don't listen
don't touch my nerves, I don't care
I watch the sky and I feel nothing,
and I don't care about who I am
Don't be the one in my life, in my hnds, in my head telling me who I am
Don't be the one, flashing back what I miss from myself waht I can't give back to you
I feel nor hate neither pain,n I'm so far away
I don't reflect that I'm here, I stand over me
And all religion inside me, I can't feel it
and all religion inside me I don't feel, I don't feel
Don't be the one in my life, in my hands, in my head telling me who I am
Don't be the one, flashing back what I miss from myself what I can't give back to you
