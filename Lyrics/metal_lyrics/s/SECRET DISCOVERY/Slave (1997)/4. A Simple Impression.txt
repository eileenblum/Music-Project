Don't have to hide your face, belive me
It's just the storm my child and nothing more
Don't be afraid of the trees
Coming down to touch
You know I keep your warm, warm and secure
You know I keep your warn

It's a simple impression
Just a visual obsession in you mind
It's a simple impression
That destroys what I love

What do you see my child
Frightening you
Your skin it feels so cold, and I shiver
We're getting close to home, in some minets more
But I don't feel your breath
You're dying
You did ignire my words

It's a simple impression
Just a visual obsession in you eye
It's a simple impression
That destroys what I love
