I know a place where we can go after all
where the grass grows wild, green and strong
there where nobody can know who we are
waht we did and what we want, believe me
You should believe in waht I say: serious day
you should believe me when I say: serious
I know a place where we can hide after all
where the air is clear, mild and warm
far away from our fate, whar we've done
doesn't matter where we'll go, believe me
You should believe in waht I say: serious day
you should believe me when I say: serious
I see the mistrust in your eyes slowly die
I can feel that your care disappears
Now I'm sure your mind's made up loving me
take my hands and close your eyes ...
You should believe in waht I say: serious day
you should believe me when I say: serious
