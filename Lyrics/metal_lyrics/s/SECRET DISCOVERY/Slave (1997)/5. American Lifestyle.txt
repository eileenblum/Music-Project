When I see you dancing now,
when I hear your smile,
there's a feeling I detest,
what could be behind this
and I open you the door
just to let it in,
this feeling that I mean,
to come over me
just a feeling, just a try
to be one of you,
and I really ask me why
to accept your rules
I don't need the American Lifestyle
and I don't dream the American Dream
and I don't live the American Lifestyle,
I don't need...
And I dedicate myself,
like a modern toy,
to some moments of delight,
to some days of joy
then I start to realise
what I leave behind,
and I ask me where I am,
where I lost my pride
just a feeling...
