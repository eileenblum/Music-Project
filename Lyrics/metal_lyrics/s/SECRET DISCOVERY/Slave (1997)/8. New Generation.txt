It's just the energy of hate, disappointing me
it's just the simple wy of fate, it's so real
I watch it all with my own eyes, my sensulity
completely different to yours, seems so unreal
It's just the energy of lies, swallowing my dreams
it's just the end of boring days, it's so real
I watch it all in different ways, my sensulity
completely different to yours, seems so unreal
I can fly .... I'm the child of a new generation
It's just the energy of rage, laying waste my head
it is the death of shining lights, so real
I watch it alll ...
I can fly ... I'm the child of a new generation
