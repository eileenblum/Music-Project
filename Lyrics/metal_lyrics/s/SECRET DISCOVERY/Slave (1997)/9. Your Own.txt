Sorry that I ask you now
sorry but I want to know
why did you expect that it's yours, yours and onl yours
sorry that I ask you now
but someone has to do somehow
how can you believe that I'm yours, like everything you have
I am not your own
Think about everything ou do
and paint the sky forever blue
but one thing you should know; that me I am not your own
think about all that you possess
it's not as much as it seems to be
keep it all in mind and stay forever blind
I am not your own
