The dust is darkening the sun, all around is bathed in grey
the air is dry and warm, the silence's swallowing my steps
the day is slipping away while my fear grows up and I wish I could leave
but I don't have no choice, it's simply in vain, I have to stay
Kill me ...
Now is away what I love, noone can see what I miss
I lost the pleasure in me, what I own is only disgrace
the god of justice failed, holy ruins of a broken force
and everything that remains, all I have, a bitter taste
Kill me...
Why should I be the last one
and I don't want to begin from the start
Kill me ...


Thanks to pill for sending track #4 lyrics.
