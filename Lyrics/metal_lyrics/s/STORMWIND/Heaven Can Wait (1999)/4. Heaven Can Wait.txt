What's the meaning of some broken wings of sadness?
What's the meaning to live with a lie?
When we walk along with spirit in our hearts,
as the eagle flies and hunts without a sound!
We change our destiny, if we just forgive ourselves
Why blame someone else and put yourself in shame?
We change our destiny if we listen to our hearts,
no shadows of the past can make you wise!

Echoes from my father's voice, leading me to a different choice!
The lonely hunter always search, mark my words!
Knocking on heaven's door, we always ask for more!
Now it's the time to make a choice! To choose a way!

What's the meaning of some broken wings of sadness?
When we walk along with spirit in our hearts!

Free like a flying eagle! Heaven can wait!
I'm changing my destiny! Heaven can wait!

Look in the mirror, see into yourself!
The burden of your soul, makes your eyes cold
Reflections from your childhood, shows how you act!
Seek the lonely way of light, and face your inner fear!
