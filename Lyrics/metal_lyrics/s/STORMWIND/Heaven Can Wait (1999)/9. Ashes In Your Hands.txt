Ashes in your hands
Hold on to your dreams
Show me your truth
Show me your beauty!

You will always stand alone forever
that's no reason to leave
Everyday changes the future, to the past
and your eyes tell me more!

When the angels pass you by! (Fly!!!!!)
Leaving ashes in your hands
See the sign and break the line!
Soon your tears are streaming down

Bringing sorrow, bringing pain, it's all the same
and I let it pass me by
Your heart is broken, very sadly
Another chance to set yourself free!
