To blind to see! You don't break free!
Hungry desire! Walking through fire!

Wild as a cat, she came dressed in black
A skintight dress, why don't you confess?
She's right by your side, and you can't deny
I'm sure you would ask for more!

The night comes in, you fulfil your dreams
She aims at your heart, right from the start
Her senses are sharp

A shooting star, who didn't go far
Born in the street, where she's taken retreat
She always defeats

She came out of darkness! Playing her game!
Nice and sleazy, she eats you so easy
