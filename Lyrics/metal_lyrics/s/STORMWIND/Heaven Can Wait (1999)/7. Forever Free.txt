I'm seeking for answers, wherever I go
Tears of pain, drive me insane!

Who am I to judge!? As no one is perfect
I accept myself, and everything around!

(I'm) standing on the edge, I'm taking the chance!
(I'm) smashing the walls, abandon the ground

Forever free! I finally see!
The shadows of past, will disappear, at last

Forever free! I'm crossing the sea!
Far and beyond, under the sun, I'm free!

Who am I talking to? It's no one else there
Why be afraid, I know the way!
