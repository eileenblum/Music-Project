Like a shooting star from heaven, you came into my life
Always loving and so joyful, you chase my shadows away
You're the one for a lifetime, I can't imagine it without you
You always talk to some stranger, inspiring me to live in danger!

I can't imagine
I can't imagine it without you
I've got the wind now honey
I've got the wind beneath my wings.

It's our magic night!
And you're my starlight!
You're my everlasting heart of love

It's our magic night!
And you're my starlight!
You're my guiding light of love

Your eyes are filled with passion
but you always waited too long
It's almost like an illusion
You take my breath away
