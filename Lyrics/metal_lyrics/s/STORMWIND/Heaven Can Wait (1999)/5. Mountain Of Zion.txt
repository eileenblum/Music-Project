The pilgrims passing
Through the gate of Zion

Traditions passed on, so easy to lie on

Christ was aware,
It was the last supper
The prayer of despair
Still heard at the Wailing wall

Mountain of Zion!
Betrayed and accused

Oh Lord forgive them
They didn't know better!

Endless caravan
at the desert well

The Holy Water
Flowing to save us from hell

The star of forgiveness
Shines over Jerusalem

The prayer of despair
Still heard at the Wailing wall
