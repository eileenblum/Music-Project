Escape your dream, that you believe in all you see to be true

Forever bound, to a destiny, (that) you can't receive
in your heart

Hypnotizing, analyzing, eyes!
Essence burning, curious searching!
Why put the faith in tomorrow and let it all go!

In the eye of the storm! Where do you belong?
When you crossed the border on your own!

In the eye of the storm! Who's keeping you calm?
The wind of conscious passing through your gun!

Who doesn't search, for the promised land, through snow and sand,
the Holy Land!

Living a lie, no dreams fulfilled, you're lost without, the key!!!
