I'm flying on a wave of silk, crusing
Through a
Forest dream
The smell of wood in the air, grasping
My sense in a sensual flair.

In the eye of the storm, my flyer is born!

[Chorus]
King of the mighty sea!
Crusing on my flyer dream!
No agony, just liberty my soul is free!

Surfing on a silver stream
Loosing my heart to scream!
No agony, just liberty
I'm finally free!

The endless water seemed to lift my
Dreams into a endless eternity
Whoever may cross my waves, my flyer
Will ride on their water streams

In the Eyes of the storm, my flyer is born!
