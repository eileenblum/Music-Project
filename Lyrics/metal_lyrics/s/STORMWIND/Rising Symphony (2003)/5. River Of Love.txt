First impression allways last
Is it all about sympathy?
Am i the mean who controls
My emotions
And never shows my true sides?

Hear me out
Give me light in the night
Is it all about compassion?

[Chorus]
River, river of love!
I could see it in your eyes!
River, river of love!
I only need your gentle touch!

I'll conquer haste
Before it's too late
I will face my true fate
Who lacks the courage before
It's too late!
Could this be my last chance?

[Chorus]
River, river of love!
I could see it in your eyes!
River, river of love!
I only need your gentle touch!

A cold wind is blowing in 
Our solitary world
True fate!
