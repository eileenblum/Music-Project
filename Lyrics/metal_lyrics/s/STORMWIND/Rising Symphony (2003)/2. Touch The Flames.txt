Ashes to ashes a life of compassion
It's time to learn from our mistakes
Feel its essence like another lesson
Be true and leave your behavior

Beware of the signs!
Beware of the eyes that look turn away!
Learn of the prophet who's prayer
Remains!

[Chorus]
Touch the flames! Face to face!
Let your heart be free again!
The anger will tear you apart
The truth is never too far

Touch the flames! Face to face!
Let your heart be free again!
Set your emotions free
Wherever you may be!

Open the gates! Face your faith
And leave your contempt forever
Fatal Attraction, curious seduction
The coldhearted seek the dangerous
Way.

Beware of the signs!
Beware of the eyes that look turn away!
Learn of the prophet who's prayer
Remains!
