As years pass by, memories still remain
Broken Dreams of yesterday
Words that fade away
Seasons of changes
Turn my wind away
Eyes of change hold me once to stay
Without a broken heart
Will i face it all again
I'll just close my eyes and hear my
Soul's prayer!

Eyes of change!

Eyes of a tiger swept my feet away
Weakness of desire hold me once to
Stay power of decision without
Supersition inspired by her eyes,
Fire and ice!

I'm on fire, with desire! Eyes of fire! Take
Me higher!

[Chorus]
Eyes of change
She wants to make it! My mind will
Face it! Two Different Faces!
She wants to have me though my soul
Betray me!

Emotions of my hope,
Faith and romance
Hold me in her trace.
I'm ready to take a chance!
As years pass by memories sill remain
Dreams of yesterday words that fade
Away
