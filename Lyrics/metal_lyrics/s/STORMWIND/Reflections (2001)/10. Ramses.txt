The slaves were begging for their
Freedom
While they built his Empire
Gods messanger received the ten commandments
While the people lived in sin

Ramses said:
In the Eyes of Ra!
An Empire to die for!

[Chorus:]
Ooh Pharao! Ramses is gone!
(Let it be heard!)
The Royal Falcon...
Fled into the Sun!

Who can forget when the parchments were found!?
The Words of Wisdom were revealed!
Even the Church feared
The message of the Gospel!
A Revelation of mankind!

Let it be written... Let it be done!
