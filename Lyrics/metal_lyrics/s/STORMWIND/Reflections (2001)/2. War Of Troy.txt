Ooh Eris Goddess of war
A golden apple a fruit of discord!
Zeus said Paris will choose!
Blickering Gods the Troyans will lose!

Helen was gone before the morning sun!
Thousands of ships set sail for Troy!

[Chorus:]
War of Troy! King priams fall!
Cassandra was ignored
The fall of Troy!

They followed their Hearts!
Watched by the Gods!
They opened the Gates! A burning fate!

Just behind the whispering wall
Many Legions prepared for the war
The seige of Troy lasted Ten years
A wooden Horse that no one feared

Thousands of Ships quietly returned
Warriors of Troy soon learned.
