Where 's the Truth behind that black wall?
Why living in a Dream that I recall?
Why do I feel anxious &amp; afraid?
Seeking a reason to betray?

I'm chasing reasons, against the clock
All the Memories are coming back
I reveal the Secrets in my Mind
Memories that I deny!

Soon the words of Truth shook the Air
You never tried to hide your despair!
You 're the Treasure of my Heart &amp; Soul
Like the Seasons change &amp; the River flows

I'm chasing reasons, against the clock
All the Memories is coming back!
I reveal the Secrets in my Mind
Memories that I deny!

[Chorus:]
Reflections of Reality
I will never be too blind to see!
In all my Hopes &amp; fears
Are You the one that I hold Dear!

Wings of tomorrow!
No prayer of my sorrow!
No reason to hide!
Leave my Memories behind!
