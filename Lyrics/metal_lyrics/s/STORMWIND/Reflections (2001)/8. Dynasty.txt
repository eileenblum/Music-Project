Without fear
Without guidance from the Stars!
A thousand years reign
Of a single Dynasty!
Through the Fire
Through dark periods of war!
They hold their fortress &amp; their Rock!

Throughout Centuries, Their Principality
Kept their identity, always Free!

[Chorus:]
Destiny of a Dynasty!
Loyalty kept them Free!
Through the guidance &amp; Trust
Of it's Princes!

Destiny of a Dynasty!
Centuries of Liberty!
A Golden Flame &amp; Spirit
Protected their shields!

They ruled their Land
With Passion in their Hearts
What goes around always comes around!
At the threshold of the third Millenium
It will Celebrate their Loyalty

Throughout Centuries, Their Principality
Kept their identity, Always Free!
