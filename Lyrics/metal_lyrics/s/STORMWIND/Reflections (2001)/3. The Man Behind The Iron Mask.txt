In 1698 a man with a different fate
Was imprisoned in the Bastille
The prisoner was forced to wear
(guarded by two Musketeers!)
A solid Iron Mask!

He could never be released!
He remained a Mystery!

[Chorus:]
Who will find the man behind
The Iron mask? Respected by the guards!
A son of the King that no one ' d seen!?
Dressed in lace without a face!

Even at the Royal court
No one knew &amp; no one saw
The twin of the sun King!
The governor of Saint-Marguerite
Kept the secret in his sleer
He even called him " My Prince "!

The King never let him Free!
He remained a Mystery!
