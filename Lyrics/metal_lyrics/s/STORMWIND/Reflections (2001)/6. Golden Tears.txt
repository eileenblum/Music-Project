Before the dawn closes in
Before the Sun begins to rise again
Without fear it's all so clear
Pieces of a broken Heart
Ended where it should start!

[Chorus:]
Golden Tears! Of a broken Dream
Was it all meant to be?

No more Tears! I still can see
And my Spirit sets me Free!

Raindrops are falling gentle in Paris
Why couldn't things be easy &amp; fair
I even thought I saw through your lies
Living without taking care!
Hiding all my deep despair!
