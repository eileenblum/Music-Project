Only I alone can decide my fate
I've got to hold on before it's too late
Without sheding a Tear over your despair
Without showing my fear could life be fair

I conquer haste! I lead my fate!
I'm not afraid to find the Way!

[Chorus:]
With Light as my guide I will Master my fears
See through the Eyes of a New Life!
I have opened the Gates!
Now my Vision is clear! I will re-live
The Illusion! Once again!

The tunnel of Light leads to another Life
The circle is drawn with Eternity's knife!
The Wheel of Time is in perpetual motion
I dive (recklessly) into the Life giving Ocean!

I conquer haste! I lead my fate!
I'm not afraid... to find the Way!
