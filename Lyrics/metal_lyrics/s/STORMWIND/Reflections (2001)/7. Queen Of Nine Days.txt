The king is dead! Long live the Queen!
Lady Jane was lead to the throne
Everyone bowed &amp; curtisied to her
Jane began to shake, realized her fate!

The Duke made his speech
Announced the new Queen!
Jane dropped to her knees

[Chorus:]
Queen! Queen for nine days!
With such Spirit &amp; Grace!
May I govern to thy Glory!
This crown was never meant for me!

Queen! Queen for nine days!
Despite Mary's rage &amp; tears
The nervous council was hiding their fears!
Lady Mary was the rightful heir!

She took her throne
Those present kissed her hand!
She prayed for guidance
Her people were entranced!
Lady Mary claimed her Throne
&amp; raised an army of her own!

The Duke made his speech
Announced the New Queen!
Jane dropped to her knees!!
