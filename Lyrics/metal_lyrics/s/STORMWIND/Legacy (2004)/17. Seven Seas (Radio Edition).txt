Wind from my lost soul is heard
Like a whisper in the dark
I crossed the seven seas of love
And got my broken wings healed

When the sea reflect the moon again
Then your eyes will tell the truth

The shooting star begins to fall beyond the horizon

What about love?

I've got my reasons. You've got your pride
But no one can deny
Oh tomorrow yes tomorrow it will be gone
We got no reasons to hide the essence of our lives
Oh tomorrow yes tomorrow it will be gone..

was your heart wide open?
all i feel is sadness deep inside
What was right and what was wrong
Lost memories of the love we used to share

When the sea reflect the moon again
Then your eyes will tell the truth

The shooting star begins to fall beyond the horizon

True words..

I've got my reasons. You've got your pride
But no one can deny
Oh tomorrow yes tomorrow it will be gone
We got no reasons to hide the essence of our lives
Oh tomorrow yes tomorrow it will be gone...
