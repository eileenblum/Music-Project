I'm giving violence another flower
The wild ones are the richest
I can find more and more
My grief becomes my oxygen
It regenerates my dead cells

I sowed darkness and I love seeing it growing around me
(While I'm) passing away

Rebirth of my lost purity
The way they don't want me to be
Kill rationality
As if I were an animal
I'm creating a shelter to rescue my instinct

As if I were a human being
I am creating a prison for my life
Inside my body my soul lies in hell
This strain feeds and almost kills me
Tomorrow's already gone
I'm dying and...
