Invisible clouds of divine poison are blessing the Earth
No one will wash our souls anymore
Finally forgiveness is denied

No one will see the dawn again

A child's running among the bodies
His blue eyes are turning grey
Witness of the empire's fall
Hate has been spread worldwide

No one is innocent
It's our nature
We are just the last lines in the book of life

No way
We won't survive this time
We are just the fucked-up shit that destroyed the world
