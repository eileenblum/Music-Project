We need protection
We have the power to lose control
There's no heaven we can't find
If we don't dare to try

It's a kind of obsession
Like fog surrounding my heart
I can't move
I am waiting for the night
To come and spread my mind

Show me the way
To the gates of utopia
Show me the way

Pure isolation
The way I feel is so close to death
I'm afraid I'll burn my eyes
Against the rising sun

It's just a matter of time
The price for freedom
It's our life
I'm afraid I'll burn my eyes

I will never do anything against my will
