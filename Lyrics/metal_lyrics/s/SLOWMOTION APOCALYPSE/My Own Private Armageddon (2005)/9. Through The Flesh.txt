Death!

I would renounce the promise of a new life
Just to skim that freezing teardrop on your face
Your glassy eyes are tearing me
Last grains of life devoured by rising freeze

Life fading burns like the love that filled our veins
Now the flesh is bursting
The End bud makes his way cold
Through pleasure longing flesh
The Earth is starting a new cycle
And a white fire is purifying it

Deluded gods of the past

We are becoming a sacrifice to pain
If I could only make one more movement or fade

And overcome this ice
Come closer and smell the scent of your last breath
As love during our lives
In a moment death's embrace will make us unique

Bitter taste of gall remains in our mouths

Our love sublimates unbroken towards the empty sky
Before the colours begin to fade
I scream your name

Our love sublimates unbroken towards the empty sky
Before the colours begin to fade
Already without voice
I scream your name at the sky
