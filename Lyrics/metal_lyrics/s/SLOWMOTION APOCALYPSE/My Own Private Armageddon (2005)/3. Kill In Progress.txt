Collapsing lands of illusion
A final war for human submission
Domination
A master imposed
Firestorms erasing a world of worthless lives

New World Order calls for death
Erasion
To lead the masses to the end

A morbid presage of humannihilation
Burns in me

Media abuse
Mind rape
Fake freedom education
People are enslaved by technology
Emptiness is filling
The meaning of our life

Blindness will always make you bleed
You have just yourself to blame

A blind man
A life wasted in fear
Revelation
Denial of existence
Firestorms erasing a world of worthless lives

Through blindness we'll kill this world
