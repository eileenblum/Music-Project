Usurping the role of the angel of death
Everyone is fighting in the name of God
Misery
God forsaken mess
Injustice breeds injustice
Guess whoâs the enemy

Brutality
Foulness
Corruption
The second coming
The reign of chaos

Weâve been plunged into horror
Death of children
Daily entertainment
Innocents burning on the cross
The hardest challenge we face is critical thinking

Men breed hate
In the name of God
Lords of war
More horror is to come

Ready for the fall
Ready for the Inferno
For the truth

The golden age of earth exploitation
Is reaching the end
The progenies will pay
Human kind natural born slaves
Is this the annihilation from whence new life will spring?

Dreamland born with bloodshed
Please God bless the slaughter

Come on!

Is the mass grave
Some sort of cradle?
Shall the future be born
On a river of blood?

Men breed hate
In the name of God
If the answer is God
The question is wrong
