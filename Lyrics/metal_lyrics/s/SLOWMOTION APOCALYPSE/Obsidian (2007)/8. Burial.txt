Like fading darkness
My hell of fears awakens me suddenly
Sometimes I think
Filling this emptiness with anger is the key
I cannot wait
The time has come and thereâs no way back
Not for me

No future plans
No filthy promises of glory
For those who try to see
The shape of things
Will change if put under a new light
My new reality

Welcome to my burial
Welcome to my insanity
