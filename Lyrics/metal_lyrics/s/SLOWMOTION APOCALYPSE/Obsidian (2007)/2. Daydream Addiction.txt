Disillusion is where my hope began
Forget the promises they sold us
And put reality in front of your eyes

The world is burning down
And weâre so far from the truth
The world is burning down
And again my fears are coming true

Simulation of happy ending lives
You worship what you canât afford
Your mind is getting screen-burnt

My fears turned into reality
My fears turned into somethingâ¦
My fears turned into reality
No place for us
My fears turned into something I cannot believe

Daydream addiction burns your mind
Slowly committing suicide
Daydream addiction burns your mind
Your life is under control

Obey the new god
Thatâs what youâre taught
Buy your salvation

Carried by the blue light
The great work is done
We are all addicted
And we dream of...

Your life is under control
