Load!
Fire!

Itâs my fucking war!

Come on!

Once again I feel the strength is growing inside me
No time to waste I know my enemy
I need to channel my hate and focus on my target
I seek the truth I have to try to find a path that leads me to the light

The fuel for my hatred

This is the way day by day I fight against my fears
I need to burn all my hate as a sacrifice to my faith
The crowd is bleeding anger
Tonight weâre burning inside

It is a masochistic way to feel alive
Our hearts will bleed but the anger will survive
No way to avoid this just look into my eyes
If I canât be myself Iâd rather die in the fight

The fuel for my hatred
Is human kind
My speech is my weapon
Itâs time to fight for our beliefs

The fuel for this hatred
Is born from the pain
I feel when I realize
Lifeâs worth less than cash

My hell burns under the sunlight
And the pain feeds my will
Through the ashes of your fears follow your dream
Itâs time to fight for our beliefs

An overdose of pure anger
Is running in our veins
Our speech is the weapon
This is our battlefield

Legions of the extreme
