Rivers of blood
And tears will feed your fears
No matter how long it takes
I will break every one standing in my way
I will show no mercy
If you spit on the way I am
If you dare you will pay
With your life

âCause of the passion I feel
I canât forgive your betrayal
You donât have the right to shut
My voice in the name of your truth

The time when I awake
The demons inside my heart
It will hurt like a blade inside your neck
Itâs too late to repent
No remorse will stop my hand
I will look in your eyes
Watch you die

Iâm the avenger
Hunting you
I raise my metal axe and I
Kill you
This is the end
You canât stab me twice
Iâll cross an ex
On your fucking face
You liked my money
So you shook my hand
No respect
For my esteem
Donât try to tell me
How I should behave
I know what I want
I know my way
Donât push me too far
On my evil side
Careful with what you handle
This is dynamite
Iâm sick
Iâve had enough
You eggheads
A pathetic bunch
Pseudo-intellectual-fashion-driven-brains
Stop your claims of dogma
Or just fuck-off and die
Youâre the portrait
Of another lie
Youâre notâ¦
Youâre not God
Youâre notâ¦
Youâre not a fucking god!
The self-portrait
Of another lie
The self-portrait
Of another lie
I canât forgive yourâ¦
