Catabolic devastation
Unexpected inner fear
New perspective born from this
Departure from myself

The end of this process
Itâs something I canât see
This inner fear is killing me
The rise of agony

A kind of private day of doom
Pain is everywhere

Fear! Fear!
Growing in my head
My mind my hell
What a fucking trick!

Iâd better kill the liar
My newborn dirty twin
Itâs I against me
Me and my disease

Inner fear
Force injected pain
Burying me alive
My body is my grave

Post-traumatic damage
Decreasing self-esteem
I am losing grip
On my reality

I cannot understand this
Whatâs happening to me?
I know this is the way
My ego talks to me

Iâve got to focus on my needs
And dig inside myself

Inner fear
Force injected pain
Iâm still alive
Iâm back from the grave

From my grave
With renewed strength
Back to life
Itâs time
To kick ass again
