Salvation
Thatâs what you long for but cannot buy
Cursed inside your life
Normality makes you believe you are part of
The finest selection of the human race
Itâs only business
And soon you will realize youâre dead

This is the way you want to die

They will provide you with a loaded gun
And you will always think youâre free to aim it
At whatever you like
Just pull the trigger and win

But you are the target
And they will not fail
You are just another face
You are already dead
Itâs a downward trip towards implosion
Is it too late for a change?
Too late to know where you are
Too late to know who you are
Failure is your guide
