In my eyes
Burns the flame of instinct
I refuse to follow any rule
This is for the sake of hedonism
They control your will
They control desire
They erase the power of your dreams
Fathers of all shame
Throwing dirt on what we love
You must be destroyed

Instinct will keep us alive

Under their eye
Under their control
You canât seek the pleasure itself
Follow the diktat
Submit and punish yourself
Spread the disease
Induce hysteria
Transform the pleasure into pain
Sell them your body
Stick to their model
Itâs your contribution to what
We need to destroy

This is for the sake of hedonism
You must be destroyed

Spit on
The lies they are spreading
They deserve to die
With the lies theyâre spreading
They must be destroyed
