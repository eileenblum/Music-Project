Choked by the pressure
Inside this glass cage I canât breathe
Trapped like an animal
Developing sickness
I canât just wait for my defeat
I am trying to escape from a slow decease
Again I feel the thorns in my head
I canât control my behavior
Iâm hanging onto life

And I...
Hurt myself to death to feel Iâm alive
Rebirth through self-destructionâs what I crave
Beware my practices âcause I...
Hurt myself to death only to survive

A matter of perception
A thin line between pleasure and pain
Is this what they call insanity?
A self-blessing in grief
I always liked the taste of my blood
But this doesnât mean I will stand here
Waiting for you to destroy my life

I am just hanging onto life
And I hurt myself to death to feel Iâm alive
In this world
Out of control
Free to decide
To die
