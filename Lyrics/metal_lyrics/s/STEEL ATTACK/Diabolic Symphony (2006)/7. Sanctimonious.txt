I gaze at the darkened sky
Calling out inside in search of guidance
What is truth, what is a lie?
How we are to know as you keep your silence?

It's so hard to solve this maze
To get the pieces right

I deny your existence
As I'm at the top of the world
I beg you to help me
As I begin to fall
The mortal man â your creation
Needs to see to believe â sanctimonious

Sleepless I suffer through nights
Just a glimpse of existence
My soul for a sign
What is righteous, who deserves your light
How are we to learn as you keep us blind?

It's so hard to solve this maze
To get the pieces right

I deny your existence
As I'm at the top of the world
I beg you to help me
As I begin to fall
The mortal man â your creation
Needs to see to believe â sanctimonious
