Sleep child, sleep now
Leave me now for your dreamscapes
Dream child, dream now
Beyond the haze your dream awaits

It is real now, the world you're in
A barren, cold and gruesome place
A veil of mist, a cold caress
Afraid to die you pray to wake

Soaring in a dream of illusion
Somehow you know â the end is near
Horrid visions all so elusive
So cold and alone â you're embraced by fear

You try to scream, but there's
No sound from your voice
In the sky the last star is falling
All fades to silence, no echoes resound
And no one can hear you call

You know it's a dream
Yet still you're afraid
Never to wake up again
"If I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take"

Soaring in a dream of illusion
Somehow you know â the end is near
Horrid visions all so elusive
So cold and alone â you're embraced by fear
