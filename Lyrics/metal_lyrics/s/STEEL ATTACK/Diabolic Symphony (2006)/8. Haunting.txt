I hear your voice
When I'm dreaming
Whisper my name
I see your face, know that you mean
I am to blame

Nothing is what it seems
I never meant you to harm
Something went wrong

I never meant to hurt you
Never thought what I did was wrong
I tried my best to save you
I wasn't there, now you're gone

I still can see, the fear in your eyes
A desperate stare
Entreat my help "don't let me die!"
I tried my best, I lost the fight

Nothing is what it seems
I never meant you to harm
Something went wrong

I never meant to hurt you
Never thought what I did was wrong
I tried my best to save you
I wasn't there, now you're gone
