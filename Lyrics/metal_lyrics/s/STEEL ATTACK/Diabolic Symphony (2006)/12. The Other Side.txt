Don't walk alone child, in the dark
Cause out of darkness, demons rise
In the moonlight, in the mist
Evil is lurking â staring eyes

Save'em
From all evil and all bad
Save'em
Help them safe to home and care
Save'em
From all evil and despair
Save'em
Make them sour above all bad

Don't walk to close child
To the house on the hill
It's possessed by powers
From the other side
Keep on walking
Walk away from the mansion
The house and it's powers
Will be gone at dawn

Save'em
From all evil and all bad
Save'em
Help them safe to home and care
Save'em
From all evil and despair
Save'em
Make them sour above all bad
