Welcome to the world of no tomorrow
A reign in blood, despair and sorrow

A world in constant shadow
A world of constant pain

As the sun goes down
In this barren land
As the sun goes down
In this winter hell â so cold!

Welcome to the world of no tomorrow
A reign in blood, despair and sorrow

A world in constant shadow
A world of constant pain

As the sun goes down
In this barren land
As the sun goes down
In this winter hell â so cold!

Lady of winter, what have we
Done to deserve your grace?

As the sun goes down
In this barren land
As the sun goes down
In this winter hell â so cold!
