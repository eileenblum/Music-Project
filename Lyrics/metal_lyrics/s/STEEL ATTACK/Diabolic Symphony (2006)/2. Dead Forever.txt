As I travel the path of my darkest dreams
The demons of my conscience is haunting me
For all malicious deeds, all I've said and done
For all the scars to deep to overcome

"Now it is time to bleed for your sins"
"For all vicious, evil deeds you've done"

In another dimension
A world down below
You wish to be dead forever
To make up no more

In another dimension
You're trapped down below
Unbearable never ending pain
Forever more

Merciless visions of what will come
A voice in my head â "you'll become undone"
Rancorous laughing, speaking the words
"Never again will you see the sun"

"Now it is time to bleed for your sins"
"For all vicious, evil deeds you've done"

In another dimension
A world down below
You wish to be dead forever
To make up no more

In another dimension
You're trapped down below
Unbearable never ending pain
Forever more
