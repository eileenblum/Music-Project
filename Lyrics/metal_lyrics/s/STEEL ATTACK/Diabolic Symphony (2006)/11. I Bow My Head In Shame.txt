Let me be, leave me alone
You dance of the edge of
The border of wrath you are blind
To blind to see the anger deep inside
It's taking control
I can't help what I become

There's no tears in my eyes
Even though I am crying

All is black out of control
Hidden deep within my soul
The anger in me is not mine
Another me â another time

Now it all begins again
Starting all over at
The point where it died
Staring eyes
I bow my head in shame
For what's done
I am the one to blame

There's no tears in my eyes
Even though I am crying

All is black out of control
Hidden deep within my soul
The anger in me is not mine
Another me â another time
