Oceans of fire, skies darker than black
Welcome to hell there's no turning back
It's time for you to die again again again

In sulphur flames, forever burning
Excruciating, forever yearning
To die for real to end this ever lasting pain

Dreaming, I must be dreaming
I can't remember dying
Screaming, I must be dreaming
I can't remember dying

Relentless torture, I can't close my eyes
As I see my self repeatingly die
I see and feel the pain again again again

I suffer I'm broken I'm bleeding inside
A voice repeating it is time to die
I kneel and beg for mercy
End this nightmare now!

Dreaming, I must be dreaming
I can't remember dying
Screaming, I must be dreaming
I can't remember dying

Welcome to my world
Welcome simple mortal
A taste of pain to make you bow
Subjected to my force
Welcome to my world, welcome simple mortal

Someone please
Someone please release me â bring me home!

Dreaming, I must be dreaming
I can't remember dying
Screaming, I must be dreaming
I can't remember dying
Dreaming, I must be dreaming
I can't remember dying
