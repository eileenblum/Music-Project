I am forever searching
This impossible maze
Lost to this world I'm crying
My mind's in a haze

I suffer the pain of earthly hell
In violent pain I scream

Lost and confused I am
The circle of life is spinning
On and on and on
So hard to comprehend
When we're gone the world keeps turning
On and on and on

We live to serve and to hail
An invisible god
Never seen, still we're afraid
To bleed for our carnal sins

I suffer the pain of earthly hell
In violent pain I scream

Lost and confused I am
The circle of life is spinning
On and on and on
So hard to comprehend
When we're gone the world keeps turning
On and on and on
