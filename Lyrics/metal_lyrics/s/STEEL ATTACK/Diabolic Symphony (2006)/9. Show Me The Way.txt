The road of life I am bound to travel
It's hard to know which way to choose
Which one will lead to a higher level?
One way for glory, one to lose

It's such a labyrinth I feel astray
No one to guide me, to lead the way

Show me the way
The way through this maze that's called life
Which is leading me astray
Show me the way
The way through this maze that's called life
Which is leading me astray

Nothing is without a reason
It all is meant to be
It's all a part of the game
A game of a million endings
Make a choice, either way you loose

It's such a labyrinth I feel astray
No one to guide me, to lead the way

Show me the way
The way through this maze that's called life
Which is leading me astray
Show me the way
The way through this maze that's called life
Which is leading me astray
Show me the way
The way through this maze that's called life
Which is leading me astray
Show me the way
The way through this maze
Leading me astray
