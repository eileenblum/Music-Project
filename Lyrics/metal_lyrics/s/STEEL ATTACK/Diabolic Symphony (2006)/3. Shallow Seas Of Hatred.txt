My eyes wide open, still I am blind
To all that's in my way, to all that's not mine
To anything that is weaker then I
To anyone less strong
God help me I'm sorry, I'm vicious no more
I beg you, forgive me, I know I was wrong

Lonely are the path I wander
My pride is far deom what is was
Shallow are the seas of hatred
I feel I will drown, I'm out of control

The lies I have spoken to set my self high
The pain I have caused for the sake of my greed
Remorseful I wish it all to be gone
All to be undone
God help me I'm sorry, I'm vicious no more
I beg you, forgive me, I know I was wrong

Lonely are the path I wander
My pride is far deom what is was
Shallow are the seas of hatred
I feel I will drown, I'm out of control

Lonely are the path I wander
My pride is far deom what is was
Shallow are the seas of hatred
I feel I will drown, I'm out of control
I will drown
I'm out of control
