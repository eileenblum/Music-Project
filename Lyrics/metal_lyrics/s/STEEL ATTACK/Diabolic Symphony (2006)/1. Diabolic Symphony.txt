Through timeless space I'm falling
Trapped in a void
Tormented souls are calling
From diabolic soil

A distant horizon of fire
Disharmonic chime of bells
Silhouettes are rising higher
"Seven towers of hell"

"I feel"
Spirits of profanity descend upon my soul

A diabolic symphony
Enchanting me, calling my name
A diabolic symphony
Written in blood is my destiny

A constant pressure to my head
A pounding inside
Dividing my soul and my body
My god it cuts like a knife
Am I in hell? Am I dead?
Am I dreaming? Am I alive?

"I feel"
Spirits of profanity descend upon my soul

A diabolic symphony
Enchanting me, calling my name
A diabolic symphony
Written in blood is my destiny
