This is the end of the world
This is the day that we all heard
The falling shadows they has come
And so they went out for us
But they didn't burn our eyes
The world is passing away

But the truth will remain
Beyond the gates of time
Now the true light will shine
And it will blind my eyes

So now what have we become
We, we can see it all so clear
We have no time left to fear
We cannot go on like this
Make us fall and we will rise
Lead us to a paradise

You have to brake, the chains of power
You have to stand up and fight
The holy sword will rescue us all
Fight with fire and we hear the call

Wings of faith come take me away
Wings of faith my soul will remain
Wings of faith come take me away
Wings of faith my soul will always remain

This is the end of the world
This is the day that we all fear
The falling shadows they has come
And so they went out for us
But they didn't burn our eyes
The world is passing away

But the truth will remain
Beyond the gates of time
Now the true light will shine
And it will blind my eyes
Wings of faith come take me away
Wings of faith my soul will remain
Wings of faith come take me away
Wings of faith my soul will always remain

[Solo]

We are calling can you save us
We are calling the wings of faith
We are calling can you save us
We are calling the wings of faith

We are calling can you save us
We are calling the wings of faith
We are calling can you save us
We are calling the wings of faith

Wings of faith come take me away
Wings of faith my soul will remain
Wings of faith come take me away
Wings of faith will always remain
