Now its day
But soon the night is here
Again and I will pray
For a night without no fear
Tormenting my mind I'm so scared
Slowly tearing me apart
There is no more will I most kill
Screams of anger all around
This cannot be reality

I destroy and kill
Is this reality?
I destroy and kill
Is this reality?
Or just a fantasy?

The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation
The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation

The beast within
Commanding my mind
Hold me as a prisoner
Who has lost control of time
I am trapped and lost inside a cage
I cannot escape the beast
The key to freedom disappeared
Searching for the holy path
Escaping pain and misery

I destroy and kill
Is this reality?
I destroy and kill
Is this reality?
Or just a fantasy

The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation
The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation

[Solo]

I hear those voices talking
But there is no one there
I hear those voices talking
Please make them disappear
I hear those voices talking
Cant take it any more
I hear those voices talking
Fight the unholy war

So many man before me
Has fallen down and cried
So many man before me
No matter how they tried

The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation
The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation

The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation
The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation

The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation
The beast of no religion
The beast a mysterious creation
