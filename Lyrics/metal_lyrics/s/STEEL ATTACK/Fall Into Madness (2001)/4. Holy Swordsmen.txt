They saw the morning stars
Glowing up the crimson sky
I had to wait for many days
And as the darkness passed by
The light is here
And all the shadows disappear

Out of the dark and into the light
I'm Getting ready for the eternal fight

The children of the damned
Including faith
Sometime it's hard to understand
When raising hate and fury
They say you are
Made of power made of steel

Out of the dark and into the light
I'm Getting ready for the eternal fight

Holy swordsmen, the masters of Steel
Holy swordsmen, must fight the unreal
Holy swordsmen, the masters of Steel
Holy swordsmen, must fight the unreal

The enemy is gone
Steel metal brought them down
No need to be so mistreated
Gods will to have it done
There is no more reason
Cause war is out for the season

Out of the dark and into the light
I'm Getting ready for the eternal fight

Holy swordsmen, the masters of Steel
Holy swordsmen, must fight the unreal

Holy swordsmen, the masters of Steel
Holy swordsmen, must fight the unreal

[Solo]

They had to bring the damned down, to quiet their cries
To bring the Valley peace and calm, to end all the lies
They search for the truth the wizard of salvation
Will give the people what they want

[Solo 2]

Holy swordsmen, the masters of Steel
Holy swordsmen, must fight the unreal

Holy swordsmen, the masters of Steel
Holy swordsmen, must fight the unreal

Holy swordsmen, the masters of Steel
Holy swordsmen, must fight the unreal
Holy Swordsmen
