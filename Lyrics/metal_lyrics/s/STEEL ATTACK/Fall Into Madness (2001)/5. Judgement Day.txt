Masters of universe are crossing the highest hills
Faster than light
I cry for freedom again, it seems like the time stand still
Magic and wonders on their way to the Promised Land
Lead them to us
Today is the day my friend, the prophet will make it end.

He was told to be fair and brave
He was told to be free again

Fly away with me to a quiet peaceful place
Take my hand and we will leave without any trace
Fly away with me and we will fly so high
Take my hand and we will touch the sky
The Judgment Day

Message of victory in glory and pride we live
So now they say
The war is over now, we believe in the master's words
Guardians of twilight are protecting us from our sins
Saved by the grace
It's time to fly away, to a silent peaceful place

He was told to be fair and brave
He was told to be free again

Fly away with me to a quiet peaceful place
Take my hand and we will leave without any trace
Fly away with me and we will fly so high
Take my hand and we will touch the sky

[Solo]

He was told to be fair and brave
He was told to be free again

Fly away with me to a quiet peaceful place
Take my hand and we will leave without any trace
Fly away with me and we will fly so high
Take my hand and we will touch the sky

Fly away with me to a quiet peaceful place
Take my hand and we will leave without any trace
Fly away with me and we will fly so high
Take my hand and we will touch the sky

The Judgment Day
