Destroy and kill you can see him arise
Traces will burn in the sky
Beware O mankind cause you might die
He will not care for you're tears

Dressed in black with weapons of Steel
He's ready to fight and attack
Beware O mankind cause you might die
He will not care for you're tears

He's turning the sun blinded by darkness
He follows the trace of mankind
The freedom is gone no longer near
Is a message from hell you can hear

When the fireballs are kissing the clouds
Humans in terrible fear
So hear the mighty call of his sword
Now you will obey the black lord

You cannot destroy the empire of rage
He feeds you with pain as you fall
So hear the mighty call of his sword
Now you will obey the black lord

He's turning the sun into darkness
As he follow the trace of mankind
The freedom is gone no longer near
Is a message from hell you can hear

Destroy and kill you can see him arise
Traces will burn in the sky
Beware O mankind cause you might die
He will not care for you're tears

Dressed in black with weapons of Steel
He's ready to fight and attack
Beware O mankind cause you might die
He will not care for you're tears

He's turning the sun blinded by darkness
He follows the trace of mankind
The freedom is gone no longer near
Is a message from hell you can hear

[Solo]

Take control of your life before it's to late
Get into the fire get rid of you're hate

He's turning the sun blinded by darkness
He follows the trace of mankind
The freedom is gone no longer near
Is a message from hell

He's turning the sun blinded by darkness
He follows the trace of mankind
The freedom is gone no longer near
Is a message from hell you can hear
