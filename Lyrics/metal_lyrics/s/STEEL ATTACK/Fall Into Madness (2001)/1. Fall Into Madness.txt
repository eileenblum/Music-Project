I'm facing the ground I am calling the angel of faith
Into dawn without no fear
I will fall into madness but I try to avoid the mess
I'm on the edge I have no choice

With struggle and fight I'll hope to achieve
Some kind of satisfaction
I do not fear the anger
Set me free and you will see

Time to run I'm touching the sun
I'm fighting for mankind I'm fighting for freedom
Time to run I'm touching the sun
I'm fighting for my life but I don't know how long I will go on

I will sink into sorrow but I will never give in
Its time to see the angels cry
I have no visions I'm not the one who can see
See the sword defeat the weak

With struggle and fight I'll hope to achieve
Some kind of satisfaction
I do not fear the anger
Set me free and you will see

Time to run I'm touching the sun
I'm fighting for mankind I'm fighting for freedom
Time to run I'm touching the sun
I'm fighting for my life but I don't know how long I will go on

[Solo]

Now I can see all the shadows behind me
They are paralyzed by the light
I can't return now I must face the fear
All suddenly when it stood clear to me
Like a vision in the sky
Now I can see the calm before the storm

Time to run I'm touching the sun
I'm fighting for mankind I'm fighting for freedom
Time to run I'm touching the sun
I'm fighting for my life but I don't know how long I will go on
