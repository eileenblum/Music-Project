Show a little faith there's magic in the air
Beyond the gates of time we fly so high
Fight for glory and pride will come our way
Never surrender, if we do, we are done

Never look back
We are ready to strike and attack
Never look back
It can be our final attack

We are defenders of the crown night and day
For all that's in the world we fight until we die
Because the darkness now has blinded my eyes
But for the full price I shall give it to you

My lord
The king
The world
The lust of the flesh

My lord
The king
The world
The lust of the flesh

In a world of hate and lies
We search for the truth
But we have not found it
The future is dead
And everything is lost
We can't defend our self
How hard we try
We can't defend the crown

The morning fills the air with silence I am lost
I'll try to reach for the stars in the sky
It's time to close the final chapter in the book
There goes my pride it was my life they took

My lord
The king
The world
The lust of the flesh

My lord
The king
The world
The lust of the flesh

In a world of hate and lies
We search for the truth
But we have not found it
When the future is dead
And everything is lost
We can't defend our self
How hard we try
We can't defend the crown

[Solo]

In a world of hate and lies
We search for the truth
But we have not found it
When the future is dead
And everything is lost
We can't defend our self
How hard we try
We can't defend the crown

In a world of hate and lies
We search for the truth
But we have not found it
When the future is dead
And everything is lost
We can't defend our self
How hard we try
We can't defend the crown
