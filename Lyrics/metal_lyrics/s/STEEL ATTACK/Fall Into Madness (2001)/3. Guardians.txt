Into the dark I search for the way
I can't return one day
Give it to me I need it now
Mighty guardians of hope

I follow the light into the dark
The path seems so unreal to me
I know I will find it soon

I had a vision I am the one
I need deliverance
Come set me free so I can fall
Into the hands of faith

I follow the light into the dark
The path seems so unreal to me
I know I will find it soon

I'm waiting
I'm searching for eternal life

When I come to the land of twilight
I will search for the one
The one who fires from the sky
The guardians of hope

I'm on a mission come take my hand
Save me now mighty one
Now I can see the land of twilight
Waiting for me to come

I follow the light into the dark
The path seems so unreal to me
I know I will find it soon
Into a world that already shines
This seems so unreal to me
I know I will find it soon

When I come to the land of twilight
I will search for the one
The one who fires from the sky
The guardians of hope

[Solo]

I'm waiting
I'm searching
I know I will find it soon
I'm waiting
I'm searching
I know I will find it

When I come to land of twilight
I will search for the one
The one who fires from the sky
The guardians of hope
