Into the night there's no more fight
He knows the difference between wrong and right
This time was wrong now he's strong
Because the war went on so very long

Push them aside
Show them who's the man
So open wide
As only a warrior can
Push them aside
Show them who's the man
So open wide
As only a warrior can

The smell of death from your own breath
There is no turning back just follow the path you set
The destiny is calling you
This challenge will make it so good for you

Leave it all behind
Let the wind take you away

Ride away from the war
You don't need it anymore
For peace you will fight
Separate wrong from right
The attack from the steel
Into good
It will heal

Surprise them all
And make them fall
Do not be afraid
Just finish your call
Steel them down
Attack the one
The one who think he is
The evil ones son

Push them aside
Show them who's the man
So open wide
As only a warrior can
Push them aside
Show them who's the man
So open wide
As only a warrior can
Ride away from the war
You don't need it anymore
For peace you will fight
Separate wrong from right
The attack from the steel
Into good
It will heal

[Solo]

Push them aside
Show them who's the man
So open wide
As only a warrior can
Push them aside
Show them who's the man
So open wide
As only a warrior can

Ride away from the war
You don't need it anymore
For peace you will fight
Separate wrong from right
The attack from the steel
Into good
It will heal

Ride away from the war
You don't need it anymore
For peace you will fight
Separate wrong from right
The attack from the steel
Into good
It will he...eal
