There were peace and calm 
In the village of Agabha 
The church bell rang 
And the sky was so blue 
No clouds to be seen 

Hama was his name 
A warrior he could become 
When the time was right 
When darkness would appear 
And it should 

So then a stormy night 
They were attacked 
And Hama took his sword 
Going out to war 
To face the fear 
To kill the enemy 

TO FIGHT THE RULERS OF THE DARK 
THE RAIN FELL LIKE TEARS 
OF DRAGONS IN THE PAST 

THEY WERE THE RULERS OF THE DARK 
SLAYING MANKIND FOR PLEASURE AND FOR FUN 
AND SO THEY DID 

The war went on 
For 40 days and 40 nights 
The hope was lost 
When Hama seemed to fall 
He cried out in pain 

And so at last an enemy 
Came too close in agony 
And Hama was just in his way... 

THEY WERE THE...

I cry for you my friend...
