Far beyond the horizon 
Away from the rising sun 
Between the stars of Zion 
The first battle has been won 
Now meet the mighty dragon 
And save the Promised Land 
Got to fight a thousand pagans 
With only the sword in his hand 

The Kingdom you will save 
To the warrior so brave 
You will enter the throne 
To get your final crown 

You're a warrior 
You're a savior 
With the sword and the skull in your hand 
You're on a mission 

Write the final chapter 
On the conqueror's day 
All you ever were after 
To send the dragon away 
The path lies wide open 
For the Promised Land 
You have been chosen 
To lead it with your hand 

The Kingdom you will save...

You're a warrior...
