Everything seems so different now 
Nothing is the same 
Different people come and go 
And no one is to blame 

Trust nobody on your journey into the source 
Just beware and load your powers for the course 

Use your sword for the bold 
And the fire to heal your soul 

Searching the right way in your imagination 
But listen up and follow the destination 
Use your sword for the bold...

Thunder and lightning are calling 
Calling your name 
Visions and signs are appearing now 
Is this only a game 

Follow the stars in the sky so high 
Learn the book and you will never die 
Use you sword for the bold...

DON'T BE ANXIOUS AND WORRIED MY FRIEND 
BELIEVE IN THE FAITH BECAUSE THERE IS NO END 
GRAB YOUR SWORD AND DON'T BE AFRAID 
In the Ilands of Gods they say      

Now finally you've reached the island of wonder 
No more failure, just listen to the thunder 

Use your power and your mighty sword for the bold 
And the fire to heal you soul 

Paradise beyond all human sense 
Never more used to be so tensed 
Use your power and your mighty sword for the bold 

DON'T BE ANXIOUS...
