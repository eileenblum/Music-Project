A child cries in pain, Griefus is his name
He wonders who will make the dragon tamed
Evil shadows all around
Steel again steel is a migthy sound

An old man is sitting and waiting for the sign
Striking the hot iron, obtains a scorch
The sun burns his crown, he?s getting weaker
A drop of perspiration is falling from his check

He looks at the sky, waiting for the sign
The last mission of the ancient gods
Embers are raining on his feet
The sky turns red, can you feel the heat?

Fairy tales, do you know how they will end
The merciless saviour shall always remain

You will make a migthy sword of steel
Release its powers and the ground will quake
A great warrior from the promised land
Shall receive the gift and leave for the dragon?s lair

An old man...

Fly away with your white winged horse
To the darkest place, set your course
Fight yourself through the battlefields
Demons armed with swords and shields

Figth for mankind, defeat all the pain
The merciless saviour shall always remain

You will make a migthy sword of steel
Release its powers and the ground will quake
A great warrior from the promised land
Shall receive the gift and leave for the dragon?s lair
