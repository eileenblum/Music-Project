Imagine the darkest cave 
Visited only by the brave 
So mysterious and damp 

So far away 
Beyond the mountains and the seas 
Magic atmosphere in the air 

Deep in there, what will be found? 
The smell is a stench never felt by man, before 
It's too calm to be real 
Curses from ancient times lie here asleep 

The gate of freedom, they say 
Can chase the fear away 
And rescue mankind from slavery and pain 

It was written in the book 
The vision came real 
A sign in the shape of a star appeared 

IF YOU BE QUIET NOW 
YOU WILL HEAR A  
WHISPERING VOICE 
FROM TIMES THAT HAVE 
PASSED AWAY LONG AGO 
AND YOU WILL FACE  
THE MAGIC OF 
THE DRAGON'S SKULL 

As you stand 
At the entrance, you will see 
Eyes glow in the dark 

You'll be afraid 
But go on 'cause if you stop 
Your story ends 

Deep in there, what will be found? 
The smell is a stench never felt by man, before 
It's too calm to be real 
Curses from ancient times lie here asleep 

The gate of freedom, they say...

The dragon at the gate 
Will try to make your journey short 
So fight my friend 
Fight and save us all
