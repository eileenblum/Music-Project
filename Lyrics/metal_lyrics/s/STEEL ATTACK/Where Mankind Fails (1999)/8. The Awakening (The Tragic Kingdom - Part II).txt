Arise arise from the dead 
You lie asleep 
It's time for you to wake up 
Prepare the mighty fight 
'Till the very end 
Forget all the pain and all the sorrow 

Got to be brave, got to be strong 
To beware of the storm 
It's time to wake up and follow the sign 
Buried deep inside of your mind 
Never more to fail 

You try again to saddle up 
And keep it hard 
Until they beg you to stop 
Now they are going down one by one 
Beware of Be-Lou, Dwengil's only son 

Got to be brave, got to be strong 
To beware of the storm 
It's time to wake up and follow the sign 
Buried deep inside of your mind 
Never more to fail 

Listen to the wind 
And feel the quiet space 
The enemy survivors they all went away 
They leave without a trace 
They leave without a trace 

Awake from your sleep 
Before it gets too deep 

Listen to the wind...

The light, I see the light 
Oh, it shines so bright
