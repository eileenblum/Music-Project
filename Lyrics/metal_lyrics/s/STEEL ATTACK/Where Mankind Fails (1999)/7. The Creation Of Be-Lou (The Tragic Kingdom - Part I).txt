U are Be-Lou, the last one 
The last one with the power 
The power to break all evil 
But you just don't know it yet 
Let the demon show you the way 
The right way to justify, 
The right way to justify, 
The right way to justify...mankind...

To the survivors of mankind 
That's rotten to the core 
The evil one with the twisted mind 
Has not yet been born 
So you stay in your misery 
With your powers so unknown 

You're inside an evil trap 
With a power to set free 
And the demon in your lap 
He will make you see 
With burning eyes like fire 
And harmony inside 
Be-Lou stands stronger and higher 
Into glory he will ride 

Release the force 
The demon leads you 
Into the source 
The goods will feed you 

To the survivors of mankind...
BE-LOU, BE-LOU 
YOU ARE THE ONE 
BE-LOU, BE-LOU 
ALMIGHTY DWENGIL'S SON 
HERO, HERO 
PLEASE YOUR FATHER 
HERO, HERO 
THROUGH FIRE AND WATER 

He stands on the highest mountain 
Ready for the fight 
The blood boiling in his veins 
Something was not right 
With magic full of wonder 
With lots of hope and fear 
Tragedy pulls him under 
With a body to repair 

Release the f orce...

BE-LOU, BE-LOU...

Beware of Be-Lou he will rise again this time completed and full of revenge...
