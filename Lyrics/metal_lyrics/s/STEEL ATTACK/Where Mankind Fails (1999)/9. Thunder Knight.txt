Crossing the seven seas so far away from home 
Mighty warriors your future has been told 
I have talked with the angels 
I have seen the future in my vision 
It's time for you to regain the Holy Land again 

Thunder Knight 
Raise your sword 
Oh, Thunder Knight 
When the time has come for you 

Thunder and lightning are holding the truth 
The light will show you the right way through the dark 
Behind the walls of deliverance 
Now meet the enemy without any fear 
It's time for you to regain the Holy Land again 

Thunder Knight 
use your sword 
Oh, Thunder Knight 
When the time has come for you 

Within the heart of every man 
There will be a time of wonder 
Holy soldiers fall on your knees 
Lightning and shadows, such a beauty 
Now the time has come 
Now you all shall burn 

THUNDER KNIGHT...

Now you'll burn with me!
