Sit down and listen 
I'm going to tell you about a place 
Which existence was so long ago 
And far away 

A small and funny village 
So full of laugh and joy 
Until a cloudy day 
When everything has burst away 

Take my hand and we'll go back in time 
Just before the evil rituals 
Hold on tight and read my mind 
So you wont forget what I'll say 

I can tell you 
About the evil forces 
That came down from the hills 
To kill and slaughter man 

But instead I beg you 
To keep your heart clean 
And make sure that the opposite 
Remind you of what I'll say 

Take my hand and we'll go back in time 
Just before the evil rituals 
Hold on tight and read my mind 
So you wont forget what I'll say 

NOW! HELP ME FIND A WAY 
TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND 
THE WAY THAT MANKIND'S SELFISHNESS 
WILL MAKE PEOPLE ALL BANNED 
QUICK! GIVE ME ANSWERS 
TO ALL MY UNSOLVED THOUGHTS 
OR IS IT REALLY SO IT IS 
THAT WE WILL NEVER LEARN...AT ALL?
