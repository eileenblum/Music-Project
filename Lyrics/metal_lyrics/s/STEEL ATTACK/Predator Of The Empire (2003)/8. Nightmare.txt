You can see me all alone
Lost in the shadows lost in the night
Climbimg out of a crypt
The only rule i ever need
It's my motivation to survive

Walking around with death
Mysterious force in my eyes
Walking around with death
Mysterious force in my eyes

It will be
It will be your nightmare
You will fear now
For your life

Now you're in my secret world
This is your life it never ends
In the land of the dreams
They will keep you alive in everlasting time
Chained and tied to my soul

Walking around with death...

It will be...

Do you ever wonder if this is real
Or do you think you are just trapped in a nightmare
Ha ha ha ha

Walking around with death...

It will be...
