I hear voices in my head as i lay my soul to rest
This can not be real
In the future you'll be there
Come with me and you'll be free
This can not be real

I am alone
I must be strong

Come take me
Come touch me
Come take me higher than the sky

I can not change my life i'm at the bottom of this world
Come take me away
Is this the way it all should be
So this is reality
Now i can see

I am alone
I must be strong

Come take me...

Higher than the sky
This will be the one

I am alone
I must be strong

Come take me...
