Here i am the greatest dragon slayer
I have searched for you for many years

You can run but you can not hide
I will track you down again
The taste of blood and death
In the air i can feel

I see the fear in your eyes
With the sword in your heart you slowly die

Catching the dragon
And let it taste the steel
And as the dragon dies it's almost unreal

I'm fighting for my king until the end
If i can with my blood i will serve him
Preparing for the battle
For the kingdom of the night

I'm fighting for my king until the end...

The heart of the dragon to the king i bring
And i will collect the champions ring

Catching the dragon...

I'm fighting for my king until the end...

I'm fighting for my king until the end...

The work for the king is now fulfilled
And only the dragons blood is spilled

Catching the dragon...

I'm fighting for my king until the end...

I'm fighting for my king until the end...
