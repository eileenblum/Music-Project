You better have an easy living to show them
So waste your time with peace and love
You better run if the evil is near you
He shows no mercy don't show no fear

Heaven can wait if the god is waiting for me
Heaven can wait the heavy metal god will wait

Heavy metal god the one and only
Heavy metal god let me be
Heavy metal god he will show me
Heavy metal god set me free

You better face the reality
There is no god with wings of steel
A metal chorus symphony
Up in the sky makes it real

Heaven can wait if the god is waiting for me...

Heavy metal god the one and only...

A masquerade behind your face
We need a life and we wane be free
They crucified the evil him self
The metal god will be free

Heaven can wait if the god is waiting for me...

Heavy metal god the one and only...

Heavy metal god the one and only...

Heavy metal god !
