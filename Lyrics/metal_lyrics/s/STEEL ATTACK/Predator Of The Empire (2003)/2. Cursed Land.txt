All is quiet in the neighbourhood no one really understand
I told them death had come to town to bring us down one by one
Here we are under the evil spell
That will bring us all to hell
There be no trace no marks left behind
It will take away your mind

Cursed town
Cursed town

This is the price we really have to pay
We won't survive another day
The curse we all have waited for
We do not have to wait anymore

Cursed town
Cursed town

Steal away our souls steal away our mind
Leaving nothing but emptiness behind
Running from the light into the night
Leaving nothing but darkness behind

And the legend also says there will be another day
It will come every thousand year
To bring the town more fear
Raising from the ground a cursed town is found
Searching for an answer of this town
Every thousand year it returns with fear
To make a visit in this cursed land

Cursed town...

Steal away our souls steal away our mind...

Steal away our souls steal away our mind...
