I will be searching for the last key to the heavens gate
Nothing to hide from just to accept this is my fate

My saviour he will take me there
The angels are my guide
Almost like a fairytale
When we're walking side by side

So many questions
So many reasons waiting for answers to be told
So many reasons
So many questions why we are out there in the cold

The seventh son is the holy one always on the run
No-one knows what i become cause am the chosen one
The seventh son is the holy one always on the run
No-one knows what i become cause am the chosen one

Deep in the shadows
I finally reach the end of the line
Now i am forever
The seventh son with a magic sign

My saviour he will take me there...

So many questions...

The seventh son...

My saviour he will take me there...

So many questions...

The seventh son...

The seventh son is the holy one always on the run
