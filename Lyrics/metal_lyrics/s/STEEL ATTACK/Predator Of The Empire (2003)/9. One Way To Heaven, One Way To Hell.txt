There is only one way to heaven
There is only one way to hell

In beetween there's nothing at all
Into the emptiness you fall
If you don't choose choose the right way
In darkness you forever stay

You can always see the light tonight
If the path you choose is right

How you will live is how you will die
You can't foul heaven with a lie

You can always see the light tonight...

There is only one way to heaven

There is only one way to hell

There is only one way down
And up you'll never ever come
Now its time to make your own choice
Listen to your inner voice

You can always see the light tonight...

There is only one way to heaven...

Treat your enemies like a friend
You will see that it will pay of in the end
Learn the difference between wrong and right

And you will fly with iron wings to heaven tonight

There is only one way to heaven...
