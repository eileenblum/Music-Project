I have seen the darkness it belongs to me
The key to evil is to desecrate the world
The fire within will keep me alive
You better hide your flame looks deep inside your soul
Come share my bed of fire take my burning hands
Crying it out time to relieve your soul

Under the sky blow up my mind
Keeps me alive i will return again

Falling higher thunder and lightning
Falling higher into the dark
Falling higher thunder and lightning
Falling higher into the dark

The time will tell us who's the one to blame
The touch of evil is burning like a flame
Destruction and hate you know that's my fate
As the wind shall blow we're searching high and low
Enslaved forever by the fury of the dark
So now we're on our way... again

Under the sky blow up my mind...
Falling higher thunder and lightning...

Under the sky blow up my mind...
Falling higher thunder and lightning...

Into the dark
Thunder and lightning
Into the dark
Thunder and lightning

Falling higher
Thunder and lightning
Falling higher
Into the... into the dark
