What hides inside the mind be evil or be kind
It's like an evil force that posses our mind

We need to get this feeling out
We need to get this feeling
No fear no need to scream and shout
Shout!

In the flames of fire we will burn
To change the pain and we must turn
For the peace inside we learn
There is no point of no return

Forced by the past of our lives we had a chance to survive
The emptiness inside our souls will be the battle for every one

We need to get this feeling out...

In the flames of fire we will burn...

We need to get this feeling out...

In the flames of fire we will burn...

There is no point of no return
There is no point of no return
There is no point of no return
Shout!
