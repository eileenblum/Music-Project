Five warriors raise their steel
We are free no longer sealed
We arise with a different face
In the darkness
Far away from grace

Don't hide yourself show them who you are
Cause we got the curse
We love the sound from the swords of steel
And our souls will be healed

In the storm we will arise
High in the sky
Never surrender
In the storm we will arise
Until the end

Bounded to the metal scene
More secure than we ever been
United we are strong and brave
The metal world
We will save

Don't hide yourself show them who you are...

In the storm we will arise...

Don't hide yourself show them who you are...

In the storm we will arise...
