I was alone against the world
Unwanted, abandoned, left to die
Forgotten, minstreated and abused
Lord I wonder why?
I had to give my life for the sins of human kind

Tears in my eyes mixed with the lashing rain

[CHORUS]
Take me to back to the gates of heaven
The road is so painful and long
Back to the gates of heaven
It feels like forever, I wonder why????

I see baleful, dark eyes, staring at me
I can not hide?
My father in heaven
IÂ´ve never done any harm to anyone!
I gave my blood
I gave my flesh, I ask for help
You turn around

The sins of human kind
Tears in my eyes mixed with the lashing rain

[CHORUS]

I have to give my life for the sins of human kind

Tears in my eyes mixed with the lashing rain

[CHORUS]
