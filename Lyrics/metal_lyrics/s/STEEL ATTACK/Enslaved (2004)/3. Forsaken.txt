As I turn to you for a helping hand you turn away
I guess that I live or even got born was my mistake
DonÂ´t know if I get through to you the moments that I pray
Am I forsaken to evil to bad, why donÂ´t you answer me?

I want out, so please show me the way
Help me take to the sky, set me free
Show me the way

What can I do to memerize you, what can I say
Am I a brick in your game, the one to blame, ease my pain!

I want out, so please show me the way
Help me take to the sky, set me free
Show me the way

[CHORUS]
To live forever is my course, my destiny
I donÂ´t want this any longer
IÂ´m bound to this without a chance to rest in peace
I rather die in flames
Mortality is what I want and what I need
I wish that I was stronger
So I could rise again at last and to be free
Release me from the pain

I donÂ´t want this no more, let me in to your heavenly abode
To this world I am useless, I am nothing at all, end it now!
Come take me away, donÂ´t you make me stay, hear me now!
What is left to attain, what is left to achieve, why donÂ´t you answer me

I want out, so please show me the way
Help me take to the sky, set me free
Show me the way

[CHORUS]

I wonder how this became mny destiny
I wonder why you have forsaken me

DonÂ´t know if I get through to you the moments that I pray
Am I forsaken to evil to bad, why donÂ´t you answer me?

I want out, so please show me the way
Help me take to the sky, set me free
Show me the way

[CHORUS]
