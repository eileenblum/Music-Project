"You will scream, you will cry
I will keep your pain alive
In the realms of hell when you die"
Outcast from heaven
Superior to us all
-The power of Satan, once the right hand of God

Feed my immortal hate
Feed my immortal hate

[CHORUS]
Far removed from God and light of heaven
Mankind divided, good and profane
Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!
The seed of immortal hate is sown

Feed my immortal hate
Feed my immortal hate

"YouÂ´ll be hurt and youÂ´ll bleed
From your suffering I feed
The realms of hell you can not leave"
Ever-burning flames
Endless screaming souls
Infernal region my dark abode

Feed my immortal hate
Feed my immortal hate

[CHORUS]
