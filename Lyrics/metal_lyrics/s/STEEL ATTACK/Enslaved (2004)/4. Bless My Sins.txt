Never, it is never too late
To late for redemption
YouÂ´re always to be forgiven
No matter what youÂ´ve done

Wicked, vicious deeds
ItÂ´s all right in the name of our lord
"Jesus Christ I did it in your name
Therefore I can not be blame"

[CHORUS]
Glory to our lord
Hail to you, forgive my sins
In your name we fight our wars
We kill for you and hope to win

Salvation, the key to freedom
A god sent permission to set yourself up
In judgement of of lives
"Divine is thy kingdom
Show me the way, be my guiding ligh"

[CHORUS]

- Why is evil good in the name of god?

Forever, forever safe
As long as you follow his way
Safe from the flames of hell
Just remember to pray

[CHORUS]
