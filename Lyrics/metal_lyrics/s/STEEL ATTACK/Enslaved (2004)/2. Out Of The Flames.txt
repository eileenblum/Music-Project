I am the one to follow
Satisfy my every need
Or meet the fear, meet the sorrow
I am god, I am good indeed
YouÂ´re to obey my every wish
And all I ask from thee
Or meet the crimson fire flames
In eternal purgatory

Eternal pain

All you do, you do for me
To praise my goodness so divine
Never seen but I am real
To my vision your eyes are blind
You shall deny me nothing
No matter what I ask for
From my wrath thereÂ´s no escaping
For any mortal soul

[CHORUS]
I am god, I am good
Please my will or suffer
I am god, I am good
You shall not have no other
God, just me itÂ´s my game
Please my will to keep your soul out of the flames

Do as I say or there is no way
Your soul will be spared
Be devoted to me
Be faithful and pray
IÂ´ll save you from despair
At the end of it all
IÂ´ll let the heathen bleed
I am the one to follow
Satisfy my every need

Eternal pain

[CHORUS]
