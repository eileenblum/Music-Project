The night is black
I can not see in front of myself
ItÂ´s getting colder
I feel astray, donÂ´t really know where I am
Through the mist I see a light
I feel afraid, I feel so cold
What is this that I see? What stands before me?
In the misty light silhouettes arise
Shapes of evil, soaring

I see myself, wish I was blind
I wish to be somebody else

[CHORUS]
I hear a voice, an evil voice, whispering words
DonÂ´t understand what is spoken, I just feel the pain

The rain is falling, keeps on pouring
It is washing my sins away
Like out of nowhere the sun is rising
And the demons flee my head
Except it seems to me I can not lose
The most vivious of Ã©m all
The enemy in me, my evil self
The darkest part of my soul

I see myself, wish I was blind
I wish to be somebody else

[CHORUS]

I see myself, wish I was blind
Sometimes I wish that I was dead

[CHORUS]
