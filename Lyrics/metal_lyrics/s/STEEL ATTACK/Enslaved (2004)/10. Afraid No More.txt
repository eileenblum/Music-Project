[Bonus track]

Good and evil
The battle rages on
WeÂ´re all sinners
GodÂ´s creations
CuÂ´z somewhere somehow on the path of life
We are forced into false directions

[CHORUS]
I am not afraid no more
For my sins I will die
I am not afraid no more

Through this endless waste
IÂ´m bound to fly
A tranquil moment to ease
I hope in heaven I wonÂ´t be denied
A solace to my grief

[CHORUS]

No matter what
You canÂ´t undo what is done
ItÂ´s all written down in the book of past, forever
Tell me, tell me, tell me why it has to be this way
Set us free, just let us be!
To avoid your fall

[CHORUS]
