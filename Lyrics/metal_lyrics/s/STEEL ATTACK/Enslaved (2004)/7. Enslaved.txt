No more enslaved!

Here I am your humble servant
ItÂ´s time for you to give some answers
To the questions of my mind!
Here I am, one of many mortals
Tell me now because I no longer wish to be blind

Forgive me father for my sins
IÂ´ve lost my faith in you

[CHORUS]
I am no more
A am no longer your slave
I am no more enslaved

IÂ´ve been wandering towards your light all my life
With broken wings I struggle hard to take to the sky
Falling down neglected by your grace
I come to realize my life it is a lie

Forgive me father for my sins
IÂ´ve lost my faith in you

[CHORUS]
I am no more
A am no longer your slave
I am no more enslaved

Follow me or thereÂ´s no way to be free
Why should you decide the way we live our life... set us free!

Forgive me father for my sins
IÂ´ve lost my faith in you

[CHORUS]
