As nighttime falls
Another dreamscape reveals
Morpheus calls
From his world of make believe
Sometimes he let us see
Sometimes he let us know
Know what is to be
What the future holds

"God of dreams I have to know
What is to be, you have to show
Show my future now

[CHORUS]
When you dream youÂ´re in my world
The last dream it is eternal
The final destination, the place to rest in peace
When you dream youÂ´re in my world
The last dream it is eternal
So when you die you will be dreaming forever

Dreaming so sweet
All is warm and beautiful
In a flash itÂ´s all gone
The light is fading, the dark is total
Sometimes he let us be
Sometimes he claim our soul
For all eternity
Forever more

"God of dreams I have to know
What is to be, you have to show
Show my future now

[CHORUS]
