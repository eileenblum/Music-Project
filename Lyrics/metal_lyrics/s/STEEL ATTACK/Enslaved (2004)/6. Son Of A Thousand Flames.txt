In the distance thereÂ´s a light
My wish is to be there and I reach out
Shadows of darkened souls are soaring over me
Speaking words of hatred, telling me to leave

Leave this place, your soulÂ´s not welcome
No evil deeds have you done

What am I doing here, where am I
I need to find where I belong
A voice from nowhere, I ask its name
And it speaks to me

[CHORUS]
I am no one, I am all
I am the son of a thousand souls

I need to find my way to the light
And get away from this forsaken place
The shadows of darkened souls arenÂ´t shadows anymore
Hideous creators telling me to leave

Leave this place, your soulÂ´s not welcome
No evil deeds have you done

What am I doing here, where am I
I need to find where I belong
A voice from nowhere, I ask its name
And it speaks to me

[CHORUS]
