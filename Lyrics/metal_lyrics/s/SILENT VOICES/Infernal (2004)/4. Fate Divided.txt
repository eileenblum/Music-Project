The Western sky is burning red
The earth is on it's knees
Shadows bound to the promised land
With their mighty war machines

Beneath the surface
something lies inside
through bitter eyes they watch
No hope insight
Silent prayers echo from the din
As they search for the light

Can you hear them crying
Fate divided-Their lives are torn apart
Their dreams have been denied
Fate divided-They live with broken hearts

From the birth
of mankind
He has ruled the earth
With terror and lies
As the mighty prey for the weak
And we are
Fed to the machine

Can you hear them crying
Fate divided-Their lives are torn apart
Their dreams have been denied
Fate divided-They live with broken hearts

They won't hear us crying
Fate divided-Our world is torn apart
Our dreams will be denied
Fate divided-We are cast into the dark
