From ahead the thunder roars
Below- the raging waves of sea
in the blackend sky
He's bound to carry on
Into the source of desperate pleas

He hears the call
To carry on
into the dark horizon

In his heart burns the fire of the dawn
And in his veins the ancient blood
He is the child reborn from the flames
He holds the destiny of all

He sees it all
In the horizon
The endless shores of Avalon

To relight the world again
He dives to the dragon's den

Avalon-Shine your light to the heart of darkness
Cary on- Through the raging fire
Avalon- Bring peace to the world of madness
Cary on- The flames are burning higher

In the heart of the darkest den
Lies the serpent's lair
The temple of chaos and dismay
The source of all despair

He fights them all
A flaming sword
Slaying the cursed horde

The flames rise up to the sky
As the serpent's fire up strikes

Avalon-Shine your light to the heart of darkness
Cary on- Through the raging fire
Avalon- Bring peace to the world of madness
Cary on- The flames are burning higher

Avalon-Shine your light to the heart of darkness
Cary on- Through the raging fire
Avalon- Bring peace to the world of madness
Cary on- The flames are burning higher
