Imprisoned by my thoughts
Enslaved by my hate
there's nothing left to say
Yes, I will make you pay
The flames rage inside
The fury will be my guide
You shall drown in pain

Had enough of your lies
You have gone too far
You've crossed the line now
And I will take you down
The fear in your eyes
And your useless cries
I shall unleash my hate

Fire-Burning Higher

From the ashes of your wasted life
I shall rise to the raging sky
I will leave behind this world of lies
On the wings of rage

Had your chance my friend
Now prepare for the end
No more words, no apologies
The wounds are too deep
The fire in my eyes
It will never die
Consumed by my rage

Fire-Burning Higher

From the ashes of your wasted life
I shall rise to the raging sky
I will leave behind this world of lies
On the wings of rage

Fire-The Holy Pyre
Feel it burning ever higher

From the ashes of your wasted life
I shall rise to the raging sky
I will leave behind this world of lies
On the wings of rage
