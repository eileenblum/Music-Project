In the darkest debt of my mind
Lies the spirit of the otherside
Whispering words of insanity
As it invades more space in me
How can I sleep at night
I hear the voice I cannot fight
The shadows draw on me
It all seems so unreal

And as the darkness falls
I feel it as the change begins
I'm losing all control
And forced to pay heed to the call
My reflection's not the same
The mask of death's on my face
My soul's consumed by fear
I see my fate so clear

Drowning in an endless night
Staring my demons in the eye
Casting shadow on my mind
Taken over by he infernal mind
