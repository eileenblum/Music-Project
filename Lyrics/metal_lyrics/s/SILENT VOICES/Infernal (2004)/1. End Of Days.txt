Can you feel it burning up inside?
Can you hear the demons
screaming in your mind

The end is drawing near
confront your darkest fears

Blood will fall like black rain
torment of souls-infernal pain

Soon we will see
the fall of the stars
at the end of days
dancing away
into the tune
of the end of days

Does darkness appeal to you
the curtain that hides the truth
describe what you feel inside
all the signs can be seen
but we're blinded by our greed
Where do we go from here

There is no turning back
Once the final die is cast

Soon we will see
the fall of the stars
At the end of days
Dancing away
into the tune
at the end of days
