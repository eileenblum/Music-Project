After the day, that changed the world
Nothing remained, nowhere to go
For possible grounds, fights till the end
We canât give up

If you canât keep up, this is your end
A big lack of space, where live can go on
A huge crowd of men, made homeless at once
You canât give up

Death threatens all our lives
In nuclear wastelands we hide
The losers in games, of power and might
But be aware, we will return â Weâll fight!

We are the Last Division alive â Alive
We are the lost â Invisible fights
We are the Last Division alive â Alive
On the fields of radiation

Forced to maraud, to plunder and wreck
Injured from fallout, from bottom to neck
Heading for shelters, an infinite trek
We canât give up

Within a few minutes, weâve lost half the world
At least for the moment, and centuries to come,
Half the mankind, a final deadly run
You canât give up

Death threatens all our lives
In nuclear wastelands we hide
The losers in games, of power and might
But be aware, we will return â weâll fight!

We are the Last Division alive â Alive
We are the lost â Invisible fights
We are the Last Division alive â Alive
On the fields of radiation
