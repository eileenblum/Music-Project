All your life, you have been
On the run â Always!
Take your time, think again
Fuck the world â Forevermore

Hundreds of years
Nothing has changed
No rising call for freedom
People in fear
Do not see
There is nothing to loose

The source of grief â The root of all evil
The source of grief â Enter the pain
The source of grief â The root of all evil
The source of grief â Goinâ insane

For the last time, in your life
Look at your homeland, the reason for strife
Die for your leaders and act as a tool,
Abused as a weapon, you ignorant fool

For the last time, in your life
Hug your children, kiss your wife.
Fight against men, much closer to you
Than the bigwigs you die for â and your opponents do!

Leaders in peace â Leaders in war
Rip of inferiors brazen
People in fear â Are victims for free
If they donât stand up united

The source of grief â The root of all evil
The source of grief â Enter the pain
The source of grief â The root of all evil
The source of grief â Goinâ insane

For the last time, in your life
Look at your homeland, the reason for strife
Die for your leaders and act as a tool,
Abused as a weapon, you ignorant fool

For the last time, in your life
Hug your children, kiss your wife.
Fight against men, much closer to you
Than the bigwigs you die for â and your opponents do!
