Our world to be destroyed,
Our lives: On the edge!
The threat, to overshadow:
The ones who know theyâre right

Their stories are unproven
But theyâre forced on everyone
For minds with ultimate morals
There ainât no compromise

Not city of angels nor city of sin
The last place to be when ideologists win

Dystopia â The city of nightmare
Dystopia â Freedoms last resort

They claim a deeper meaning
To overcome everything else
Indeed, when theyâre in power
You can convert or die

No proofs can change their mind
Blind faith: Uncurable
Try ânâ get away tonight
The cityâs gonna fall

Not city of angels nor city of sin
The last place to be when ideologists win

Dystopia â The city of nightmare
Dystopia â Freedoms last resort
