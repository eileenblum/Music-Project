Suffer a system never caring for you
Oppression for many, power and money for few

Out in the streets â Freedom is burning
People start making a stand
Out in the dark nights when historyâs turning
Dissidents dare to defend

United â Weâre heeding the call
Brawling and fighting but suffering and dying alone
United â Tear down the walls
Torture, oppression, distress and fear wonât go on
As time marches on

Misstaught by censors, cheated by power and rules
Enlightened victims widely enforcing the coup

Out in the streets â Freedom is burning
People start making a stand
Out in the dark nights when historyâs turning
Dissidents dare to defend

United â Weâre heeding the call
Brawling and fighting but suffering and dying alone
United â Tear down the walls
Torture, oppression, distress and fear wonât go on
As time marches on
