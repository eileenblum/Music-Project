Prologue:
And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each,
Came down from heaven upon men;
And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail,
Because its plague was extremely severe.
[Revelation 16:21]

Chaos sets the stage
As the ground starts to shake
Who pushed the button,
Made the world like livinâ hell?

The stroke comes very quickly,
The stroke comes very fast
The seventh angel arises
To desecrate the human race

Buried in the ashes of destiny
Stars disappearing into a flaming sun

Under bleeding skies
The extinction of all mankind
Under bleeding skies
To dust we will decay
Under bleeding skies
There will be no forever
Under bleeding skies
Nightmare turns into reality

Days disguised in darkness
Days disguised in blood
Red colored horizon
When it all comes to an end

A million shattered voices
Drowning into tears
A million souls unite as one
Suffer the pain â forevermore

Buried in the ashes of destiny
Stars disappearing into a flaming sun

Under bleeding skies
The extinction of all mankind
Under bleeding skies
To dust we will decay
Under bleeding skies
There will be no forever
Under bleeding skies
Nightmare turns into reality
