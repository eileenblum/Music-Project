Into the morning sun
Somehow heâll find our way
Riding the dry wind, dust in his eyes
Cursed the day

Night â Night steals the light away
Now is the time to break free
Judgment day has passed away
Awaken at dawn â Dead land ahead

Law! Law! Law of the Badlands
Innocence lost â I am God â I am king of the land
Law! Law! Law of the Badlands
My fist of hate raised high to strike you down
To strike you down

He is the ruler â The savior
Thy kingdom come
Roams through the wastelands, takes what he needs
Save the world

Night â Night steals the light away
Now is the time to break free
Judgment day has passed away
Awaken at dawn â Dead land ahead

Law! Law! Law of the Badlands
Innocence lost â I am God
I am king of the land
Law! Law! Law of the Badlands
My fist of fate raised high to strike you down
Iâm Badlands Law

Law! Law! Law of the Badlands
Innocence lost â I am God
I am king of the land
Law! Law! Law of the Badlands
My fist of fate raised high to strike you down
To strike you down
