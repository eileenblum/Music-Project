You canât get over â Canât kill the pain
Your heart is wounded â You are going insane
You feel the anger â Deep in your mind
So rage and fury â Dictate your kind

Forget the killing â Forget the pain
And take the pictures â Out of your brain
You tried so often â And always failed
To force your mind â Get back on trail

See the hero with an empty face
See the warriors left for good

Far beyond the winds of war
Hear the roar from distant thunder
Far beyond the winds of war
Pleading cries from six feet under

See the hero with an empty face
See the warriors left for good

Far beyond the winds of war
Hear the roar from distant thunder
Far beyond the winds of war
Pleading cries from six feet under
