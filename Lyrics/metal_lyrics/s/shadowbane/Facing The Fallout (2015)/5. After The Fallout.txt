The world after the fallout
Just isnât the same
People are livinâ like bastards
Fighting for shelter they claim

Castoffs with infernal bleedings
Horrible tremors and pain
Stray alone through the wastelands
Covered by deadly black rain

Fighting goes on
Each one on his own
Fighting goes on

After the Fallout, every promise is void
Invisibly hunting all alive
No-one escapes here â nowhere to run
Only tyrants will survive

Leaders inside the shelters
Decide who can live, whom to eat
In times of contamination
Healthy ones serve them as meat

The fear of the nuclear winter
Causes many to fly
However the fields of radiation
Will kill everybody who tries

Fighting goes on
Each one on his own
Fighting goes on

After the Fallout, every promise is void
Invisibly hunting all alive
No-one escapes here â nowhere to run
Only tyrants will survive

After the falloutâ¦
After the falloutâ¦
