after the day, that chanced the world
nothing remained, and nowhere to go
for possible grounds, fights till the end
We can't give up
if you can't keep up, this is your end
a big lack of space, where live can go on
a huge crowd of men, made homeless at once
You can't give up

death threatens all our lives
in nuclear wastelands we hide
loosers in games, of power and might
but be aware, we will return, we fight!

We are the last division alive,
we are the lost, invissible fights
We are the last division alive,
on the fields of radiation

forced to maraud, to plunder and wreck
injured from fallout, from bottom to neck
we're heading for shelters, an infinite treck
We can't give up
within a few minutes, we've lost half the world
at least for the moment, and centuries to come,
half the mankind - a final deadly run
You can't give up

death threatens all our lives
in nuclear wastelands we hide
loosers in games, of power and might
but be aware, we will return, we fight!

We are the last division alive,
we are the lost, invissible fights
We are the last division alive,
on the fields of radiation
