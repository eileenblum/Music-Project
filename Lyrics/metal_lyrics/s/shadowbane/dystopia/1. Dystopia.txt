our world to be destroyed,
our lives: on the edge!
the threat, to overshadow:
the ones who know they're right

their stories are unproven
but they're forced on everyone
for minds with ultimate morals
there ain't no compromise

not city of angels nor city of sin
the last place to be when ideologists win

Dystopia
the city of nightmares
Dystopia
freedoms last resort

they claim a deeper meaning
to overcome everything else
indeed, when theyâre in power
you can convert or die

no proofs can change their mind
blind faith: uncurable
try 'n' get away tonight
the city's gonna fall

not city of angels nor city of sin
the last place to be when ideologists win

Dystopia
the city of nightmares
Dystopia
freedoms last resort
