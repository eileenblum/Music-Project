all your life,
you have been
on the run
always!

take your time
think again
fuck the world
forevermore


hundreds of years
nothing has changed
no rising call for
freedom

people in fear
do not see
there is nothing
to loose

the source of grief
the source of all evil
the source of grief
enter the pain

the source of grief
the source of all evil
the source of grief
going insane

For the last time, in your life
look at your homeland, the reason for stife.
die for your leaders and act as a tool,
abused as a weapon, you ignorant fool

For the last time, in your life
hug your children, kiss your wife
fight against men, much closer to you
than the bigwigs you die for - and your opponents do!

leaders in peace
leaders in war
rip of inferiors
brazen

people in fear
are victims for free
if they don't stand up
united

the source of grief
the source of all evil
the source of grief
enter the pain

the source of grief
the source of all evil
the source of grief
going insane

For the last time, in your life
look at your homeland, the reason for stife.
die for your leaders and act as a tool,
abused as a weapon, you ignorant fool

For the last time, in your life
hug your children, kiss your wife
fight against men, much closer to you
than the bigwigs you die for - and your opponents do!
