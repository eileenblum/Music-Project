See to sky and see ground
Now time of burn will be come
See the ablaze in my sorrow
Time of sacrifice will be come
A storm will come and ablaze be strong
Time of final war will become
Final war will be come
Years of war will be come
War for change your fate will be start
Who'll be alive? nobody
Everyone will be die
Unknown war between you and die
No time ..from here get out
