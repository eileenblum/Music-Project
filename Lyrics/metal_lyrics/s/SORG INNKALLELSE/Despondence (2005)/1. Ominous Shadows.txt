Ominous shadows above your head
Ominous shadows forever with you
Seeps into you pores; forget what you have been
They are trying to take it all
And you are in place consumed by time
Twist your mind and smashing your dream
Everything it seems as though it never existed
You wont change your way
Never ending maze
Into the dark end
You are moving
