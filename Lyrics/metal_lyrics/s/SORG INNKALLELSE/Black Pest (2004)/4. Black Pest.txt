Wrath in my corpus in born
Death and destruction will still reign
Blood will stained the sun red
The black battle comes with wind
Bloody world; black pest; devastating
Black tortures you will feel
See battle field and no fear
Sacrifice is pleasure
Gray shadows fill your head
On slaught of evil
To destroy this earth
The final fight started
Feel the presence of death
