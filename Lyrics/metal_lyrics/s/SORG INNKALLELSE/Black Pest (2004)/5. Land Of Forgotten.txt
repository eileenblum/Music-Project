Endless maze way
I wont change my way
Into the forgotten land
Journey ; misery
Moving slowly
For another life
Land of forgotten dusted I pray
The tears in my eyes
And move slowly
Dislucid grief ; darksides
Everything in dust and dark
Feel the loneliness
Endless clouds
I wont change my way
Endless maze way
