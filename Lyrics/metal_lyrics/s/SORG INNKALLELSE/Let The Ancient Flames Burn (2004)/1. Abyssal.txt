Look at the abyss; your heart in the abyss
You scratch your eyes and cut your mouth
Your screaming to the sky an spellbound
Down on your knees and think about death
You'll die and you'll be in the abyss
It is the law
Now its your turn
The blood comes down upon your eyes
Now you can feel the abyss
Just cry to skies;drink some mortal water
It is the law
Be penitent and calm ; your heart in the abyss
