Ehen the deep darkness approach
And when the sun have not the light
And sky throws up storms to avenge
You will feel the pain that burns your flesh
Hear call of darkness is frightfully ; frightful
And light is downing forever chained in it
Angel is crying ; they can not flying
Night of doom has come ; mankind is buried
Killing in altars ; end of it all
And you will down into the hell
You will go in the paralyse frame
And forever chained in it
