Faithful mourners who has die
Preachers mourners what you want?
Bastard mourners are crushing my soul
Leave me alone; preacher cry
Religions will be destroy
Now I can feel the end
Leave me alone; preacher cry
Relief me of this mourn
This mourn is putrid me
I will go to the deep
Wherever not to be everyone
Mysteries are not real
They are lie ; are bogus
