Live in fear for your floating in blood
Burn in black ablaze; flames for you
Your blood means the .....
Into ocean of corpse in the blood
I crash all man for punish you
I obscure your soul we are still killing
Lord of dark forest
My lord will be remembered
My lord it will be known
From the deep beyond the flames; see my power
Let the ancient flames burn
I summoned the infernal forces
The sign of my lord engraved in the burning flames
Satan's wish is my command in the dark sky
