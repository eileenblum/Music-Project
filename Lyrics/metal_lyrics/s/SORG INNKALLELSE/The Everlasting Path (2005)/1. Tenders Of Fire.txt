Drowned in fire flames; blood &amp; bleed
Disprayer of dust; born in fire flames
Destroyer of your fate;despots of castleland
Born in  fire flames; tenders of fire
You can't moving; you chained in the ring
You are sacrificed for the fire flames
In the castleland despots is fire
Fire will burning humanity
Born in way of fire; float in blood into die
I can see fear in your eyes
You will burning in the fire flames
You are sacrificed for the fire flames
In the northland despots is fire
