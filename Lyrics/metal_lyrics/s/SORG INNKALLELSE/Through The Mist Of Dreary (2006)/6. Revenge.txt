Black heart ; dark thoughts
Awaiting for revenge
Never forgive
Eternal hate ; endless wrath
The heart full of hate &amp; grudge
Awaiting for revenge
No time to compensation
Lay in ambush to you
No way to escape
Eternal hate that never fail
We come with frost &amp; burning hate
Grudge from many years ago
Grudge ; revenge
Our last hope your death
No time to compensation
Awaiting for revenge
Our dream which came true
Burning with black fire
Grudge ; revenge
