Under the moonlight
Everything is frozen
Frozen river
Coldness assault you
Imprison breath
Screaming; no sound
Absolute silence
From the depth of winter forest
In the darkland
Night in the mountains comes with fly of raven
Sombre wind is blowing
Snow dust on your face
Shadows running to hunting you
Sound from the depth
Death orchestra play in silence
Feel the power of nature
The dark power of nature
