Across the misty field
Beside the ancient lake
Fog far above the lake
Eerily howling winds
Hiding in fog
In the deep darkwoods of north
Forward in the fog
The pure light of fear
An unreachable point
Gloomy times of pain
Depressed &amp; confused
As nothing I here stand
Floating in the fog
All of my dream is freeze
Mist of my mind
Forward in the fog
Voice of sad &amp; sorrowful
Hiding in fog; forward in the fog
