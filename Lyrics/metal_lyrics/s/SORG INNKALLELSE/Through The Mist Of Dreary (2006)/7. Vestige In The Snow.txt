Into the cold &amp; darkness
Always at night
You going...
To rear the vestige in the night
Between the trees
In the north snowy dark forest
Far beyond the mountains
Bloody vestige in the snow
Sky; full of clouds
Gray sky; unknown place ; endless...
You going
Endless vestige in the snow
Hidden in the fog
Despondent &amp; sombre into the darkness
No feel the fear
To rear the vestige in the snow
