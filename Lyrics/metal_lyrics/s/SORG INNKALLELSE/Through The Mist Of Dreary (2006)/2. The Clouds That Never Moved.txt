The clouds that never moved
I see the horizon
Dark &amp; endless
Covered by gray clouds
Sadness &amp; silent from past to future
The clouds that never moved
All over sorrow &amp; darkness
Desperate &amp; tired to seek for nothing
Dispersed thought covered by gray clouds
Close my eyes; sleeping in sadness
Dark &amp; silence
Damned on me forever
Fogy &amp; dark; gray clouds
Asphyxia feeling
The wolf howled gloomy song of cold frost....
The winter kingdom
