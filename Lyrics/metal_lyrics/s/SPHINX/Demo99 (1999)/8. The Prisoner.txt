[Iron Maiden Cover]

On the run kill to eat
You're starving now you're dead on your feet
Going all the way nature's beast
Do what I want as I please.

Run fight to breathe it's tough
Now you see me now you don't
Break the walls
I'm coming out.

Not a prisoner
I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was.

I know where
I'm going ... out
If you kill me it's self defence
If I kill you then.

I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye
I will defy
You'll be afraid when.

I call out your name
I'm not a number
I'm a free man
I'll live my life how.

I want to...
You'd better scratch me from your black book
Cos I'll run rings round you.

[Smith/Harris]
