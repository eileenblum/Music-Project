Seeking and murdering
Devouring the meat
Misanthropic awakening

In the name of the father you'll suffer
You will crawl, mentally aborted
The time of your death is now coming
You will die, spiritually castrated

Eating your entrails out
As a hungry vulture
No one can hear you
Your voice is paralyzed

Cutting and beating
Causing mass carnage
You wish not to be who you are

You can beg but you will not survive
I can't wait for your brain cells to die
When I cut off this head I despise
I can see that you're not more than flesh
Now you're dying you won't resurrect
On your knees for a god I reject
Decomposing and locked in your grave
Sacrificed!
