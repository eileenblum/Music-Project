Manipulating, controlling, vicious beast
Creating a false religion
Forever to live in pain
Forever to burn

Obeying swallowing slaves
Blinded by lies
The religion, so obscene
Ready for annihilation

They're having no right of surviving this game
Feeding my hate on their fast growing pain
No one will see that what's wrong will be right
Salvation comes in a slow way to die

Begging for mercy
Their god is deceased
Tortured in hell
For his hypocrisy

Forever to live in pain
Forever to burn
