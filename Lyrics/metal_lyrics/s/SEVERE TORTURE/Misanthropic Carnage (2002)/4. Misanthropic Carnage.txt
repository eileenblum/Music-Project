Spiritual obscenity
Creates my desire to kill
Victims lay down screaming
Ready to be butchered

I open their eyes
For them to see
How I start eating
Of their flesh

Mental sickness
Overrules my sympathy

Misanthropic carnage
Molesting each and every part
Mutilating their souls
Until they'll fear the light
Misanthropic carnage
Slaughtering humanity
With their useless, fucked up minds
They'll crawl for me and die!!!

Fucking the wounds
Of the half rotten cadavers
With sickened disgust
Of what they believe
Sexual fulfillment
As I cum in their lying mouths
