One by one
I'll slit their throats
For I am the commander
My knife penetrates
My hunger for death grows
Blinded by evil I slaughter

Pain for the ones
Who praise the messiah
You're meant to suffer
Meant to suffer

No excuse to live
Only a price to pay
For everything done
In the name of god

I'll watch them scream the things they believe
But their words are soft and weak

I'll smash
Their lying mouths
Take god with you to your grave

Pain for the ones
Who praise the messiah
You're meant to suffer
Meant to suffer
