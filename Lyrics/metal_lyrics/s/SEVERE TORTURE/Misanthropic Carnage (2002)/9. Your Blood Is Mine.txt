Son of god, I'll slay you
It's time for reality
And for mankind to see
There's no truth in your words
The scars on your forehead
Are the proof of mass betrayal
Finally crowned to bleed
Sent to your final destiny

All the days of your existence
Weren't enough to take over my soul
I'll kill you instead : you vermin christ
The wounds on your skin
Infected, rotting
You don't feel the pain because your mind is bleeding

Your blood is mine

Veins sucked empty
Swallowing madness
Your words of salvation
Nothing but a lie

You will not convince me
You will not break me

Defending your fake identity
