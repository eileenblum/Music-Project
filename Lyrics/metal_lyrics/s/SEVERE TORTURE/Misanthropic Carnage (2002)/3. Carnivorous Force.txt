Voices in my mind
Driving me insane
Visions of mutilation
Of all divine thoughts
Spreading chaos and death
Mass genocide
Seeking human beings
All are meant to die

To end in misery
To suffer and rot
To see with their own eyes
The downfall of god

Blood's gushing out
Their genitals removed
There will be no forgiveness
Their death is approved

Slaying the masses, consuming with pleasure
Caused by the fact, that their thinking is wrong
Righteous killing, of all what is living
No one will stop, this carnivorous force

To beg for forgiveness
No hope to create
Forever being confronted with hate
Suffering endlessly, they will always bow
Where is your savior?
Where is he now?

Carnivorous force
