Time to start my rage
Hatred running inside
So many lives to take
To mutilate
I pray for them to scream
Look me in the eyes
I will tear and rip and eat
Until they die

Down on your knees to the ground
Crawl for me bible child
You are infected therefore
You should die, existence denied
These souls are nothing to me
Nothing more than prey
I grow each time I kill, day after day

Consuming the dying, devouring the dead
Consuming the dying, devouring the dead

No sign of your god, he ain't here
To see your last hours
This world is no place for him
It will be devoured
