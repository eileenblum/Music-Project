I was born from the darkness
Spawned on the earth
I am here to slaughter
And make an end to the insanity

I see a painful existence
I see religious lives
I see souldomination, blessed by god
This failing creature in their heads

They bow, they kneel, they serve him
But they won't see the light at the end
They beg, they scream, they fear me
I won't stop till I'm done with killing

For those who stand in my way
I will never rest a day
Until mankind is no more, kill their gods
And rape their whores

Enshrined in madness
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Time passes
More and more, lives are lost
Unholy father, where are you now
I'll cut of your head
Before you bow
Enshrined in madness

They bow, they kneel, they serve him
But they won't see the light at the end
They beg, they scream, they fear me
I won't stop till I'm done with killing
