Randomly selecting the victims
Devoured by bloodlust inside
Carving the skin from the bodies
Removing entrails from inside

Gnawing the flesh
Till the bone is exposed
Charcoaled and rotted
This corpse is enclosed

Hidden away from the light
Darkness revealed in my eyes

Gnawing the flesh
Till the bone is exposed
Charcoaled and rotted
This corpse is enclosed
Consumed a number of fatal diseases
O look in my eyes when you are
Hacked to pieces

Strains of saliva
Trace back to the wound
Tongue penetrated
Gash breathing, blood splashing

Shattered, the remnants of life
Severed, the legs at the thighs
Puncture the body, lock to the strain
Forcefed with lust and profanity
All that remains

Wait to be fed through this strain of cadavers
Through skin and blood replenished
Sedated forever

Drain them from life as they cave in
One solution is there for the bodies infected
Now reduced or enslaved in
The strain of cadavers, life force to the feeding

Consumed a number of fatal diseases
O look in my eyes when you are
Hacked to pieces
