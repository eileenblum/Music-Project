Unconditional annihilation, no death denied
Dragged down in our perpetual downfall
Do not seek shelter in these lies
Swallow down your impotence father
Your glory cannot save me now
Unbound by manmade laws and traditions
Deceptive hope of infertility remains

For we too, will shed innocent blood

Bridges burnt and the memory
Long gone, all left behind
Thriving on the hatred that is
Buried deep within me
My claim, your soul is mine to
Erase the past, for the present
Seems bleak and the future is dead
These stakes are high, lest we forget
Annihilation: the criterium
Accomplishment: divine

Slaughter will proceed until eradication is completed
Commencing through the stages, reducing the criteria
Slaughter will proceed until eradication is completed
Commencing through the stages, reducing the criteria
Slaughter will proceed until eradication is completed
Commencing through the stages, reducing the criteria
Slaughter will proceed until eradication is completed

Burning. Stabbing. Sawing. Beheading. Shooting.
Strangling. Drowning. Hanging.

Dead

The herald of renewal
This renaissance in blood
Not knowing, not seeing
Not comprehending what is to come
This renaissance in blood

Burning. Stabbing. Sawing. Hanging.

Dead
