Realm of many lies
Believers slayed in millions
Losing their lives to them,
Who came and bashed a kingdom
There is no remorse for slaves,
Living under religion
Digging their own graves,
I will be pleased to help them
Many years of madness, all to sacrifice
Close your eyes and see the darkness
By my hands, decree of darkness
By my words, decree of darkness

Blood will be on my hands,
You will nothing but die
Endless feeling of fear,
As I take out your heart
I will not bow for any crown
I will not bow for any crown

More death comes to this earth as you will see
No more time for remorse so you will feel
Nobody needs your presence, nothing built up to lose
So don't act like a coward, it's too late for you

So see the darkness rising
Burning every cloud
Everything turned into shadow
And all the lights go out

This is your new existence
As empty as it was before
There is only one difference
You live in my world now you whore

Never rest upon your god, who is dead and lifeless
Who is burning in my domain of darkness
By my hands, decree of darkness
By my words, decree of darkness
