Blind as they follow
The hook, line and sinker
Nourish the vile
To be cleansed in disgust
Nailed down, coffin shuts
Feeding on the facts of the insane
Total system shut down
All sense for reason fades
Suicide on my command
No choice is left but to obey

This void of chaos seems to never end
Erase the faces till they are nameless
The hideous offspring of a dying world
Still procreating to increase in numbers

The airwaves carry infected frequencies
Remote controlled lobotomy
Diecast our new world, defection
Dissected or vasectomy
