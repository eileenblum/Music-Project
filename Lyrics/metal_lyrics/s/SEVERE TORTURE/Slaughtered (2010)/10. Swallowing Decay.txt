buried underneath the ground
parts already decomposed
lifeless human meat all to be exhumed
flesh appears above the ground
what was once inside a tomb
now belongs to me for my gluttony

i like to eat cadavers
i must consume the dead
i desecrate the graves where all these corpses rest
i feed on severed limbs
pus dripping peeling skin
festering intestines
until my hunger is fulfilled

i pounce upon the restless pray
genitals brutally removed
my voracious mind fully uncontrolled
the taste for vaginal decay
makes me yearn for some more
ripping of the head, ready for the final course

i have to disembowel
impelled to mutilate
i cannot fight the will inside to violate
the pleasure of ingesting
the urge for human flesh
the preserving hunt for meat is coming to a head

give me your flesh , let me devour it
give me your flesh , let me devour it

without retching i devour
the carnal reeking mess
i stuff my self with every corpse i can get
dead entrails all for me
i'm swallowing decay
i need more rotting festering remains to excavate

give me your flesh , let me devour it
give me your flesh , let me devour it
give me your flesh , let me devour it
give me your flesh , let me devour it
