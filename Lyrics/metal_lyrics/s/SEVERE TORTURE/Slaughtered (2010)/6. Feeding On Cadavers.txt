crosses are lurking on gods holy ground
cadaveric stench overwelming
craving for flesh
of the half decomposed
digging my way to salvation

coffins appear
rampantly cave in the tomb
feverish labour rewarded
clothes are removed
of the rotting, now found
vestigal entrails devoured

empty graves
where corpses once lay
bloodstained caskets surround me
bodies exhumed
remnants consumed
there is no peace for the dying

sorely will be
the horrendous enormity
a profusion of intestines taken
restless i eat
all whats offered inside
yearning for more rotten meat to dismember

hunger uncontrolled
i clear out the tomb, then search for more
corpses unpreserved
unwholesome diet when dinner is served
tasteful carrion
ulcerous organs , my satisfaction
ingestion of the flesh

empty graves
where corpses once lay
bloodstained caskets surround me
bodies exhumed
remnants consumed
there is no peace for the dying

feeding on cadavers
