blood dripping , the bowels splashing
eyes gazing into death
kneedeep in feces, the horrid taste of
this foul sanctity in gore

foaming at the mouth, just from what i see
the lust inside uncontrolled
all these corpses left for me
impaled, chopped up, violated
beaten to a pulp

slaughtered
no one will stay alive
you will be slaughtered
no one will survive

bluntly hacked , defile and conquer
peel the eyelids off her face
one fist inserted, internal punches
a sack of meat, waiting to be filled

this world of pain for only a few to see
here comes the future
die in agony
lifesblood, through pain you'll be reborn
every fucking orifice, ripped and torn

slaughtered
no one will stay alive
you will be slaughtered
no one will survive

nothing will survive
there is no chance to stay alive
undiscriminated hate
no one will stay alive, you will be slaughtered

slaughtered
no one will stay alive
you will be slaughtered
no one will survive
