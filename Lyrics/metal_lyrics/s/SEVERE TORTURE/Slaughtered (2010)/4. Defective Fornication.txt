heavenly father forsaken
the unholy presence of godly intent
no souls will go to your chapel
once blood is spilled and feasted on

guilty of sin
growing illness within
the life of a bastards worth nothing to me

killing with hate
torture their faith
death is what perverted liars awaits
credulous mother of divine incest
lavish praise for the whore of gods
unfold your legs of deceit
receive my mutilation

guilty of sin
growing illness within
the life of a bastards worth nothing to me
killing with hate
torture their faith
death is what perverted liars awaits

submissive fornication
repulsive lamentation
convulsive resignation
sententious desecration

son of disease
down on his knees
father and mother dead is all he sees
minions of grief
do not believe
a life of misfortune is what you'll receive
