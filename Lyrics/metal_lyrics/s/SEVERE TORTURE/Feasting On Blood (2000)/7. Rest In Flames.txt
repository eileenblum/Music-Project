Do you feel holy while hanging on the crucifix?
Wearing this stupid crown, you are not my king

Followed by believers, followed by slaves
Living in cold darkness, may you rest in flames

You are nothing, and never will be, 
for you are jesus

You'll be dead
Your eyes bloodred
Forsaken and hanged 
Time to rest

I condemn you to everlasting suffering
On your knees to god, what a foolish way to die

You are dead
Your eyes bloodred
Your body stonecold
christ is no more

As I burn down the crucifix
All I see is darkness
And the stench of lies and death
jesus is hate

Nothing to remember
Nothing to praise
Nothing to worship
Nothing is what you are
