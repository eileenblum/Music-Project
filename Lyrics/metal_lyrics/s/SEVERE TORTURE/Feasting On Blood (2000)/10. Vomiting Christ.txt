With the smell of rotting flesh
I walk the path of torture
As the creator of sin and lust
These slaves of god I slaughter
I remember their mistakes
A mental strangulation
Whores of christ and god
You will be forgotten

I'll kill you one by one
Disbelief grows
christ infected brains
Start to decompose

Vomiting christ, I'm feasting on your blood
Vomiting christ, left by your own to rot
Vomiting christ, I'll shit on your remains
Vomiting christ, you were never there

As I decapitate your carcass
Your wings are bleeding guild
How does it feel to die
You slave of jesus christ 

I'll kill you one by one
Disbelief grows
christ infected brains
Start to decompose

Vomiting christ, I'll tear your soul apart
Vomiting christ, The destruction of your kingdom
Vomiting christ, Cry and bleed for me
Vomiting christ, Vomiting christ...
