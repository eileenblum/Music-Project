And as loathsome beasts we disgraceNot mourning for those once neglectedTheir formal identity contrivedAs unavailing effort to escape reality Malicious disturbance of the mindFeeble personalities fated to die Self-sacrificing undignifiedOnly to mislead the weak Redefined identityDisloyal to divinity Lack of awareness causing demiseInfatuated by a fake disguiseVulgar deceiver controlling their mindsSo unfaithful, so provoking Redefined identityDisloyal to divinity
