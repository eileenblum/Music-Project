Buried with the deadA gruesome fearThese corpses feed on my soulInsanityAs we wither, our bodies turn to dustEnclosed, embedded.All we cannot see is lost Gazing in the eyes of the deadThe time has come for us to be dismemberedEnticed by this cruel fateThe hatchet is buriedSworn to eliminate The stage is set, my eyes, they cannot seeBoth legs now brokenBody numb and the barrel of the gunIs pointed there right at me All we see, is the darkness of the light, don't stop meAll we see, is the darkness of the light, don't stop me These demon walls can't containThis raging anger insideAs they feast on the deadThe wait is over These corpses feed on my soulInsanity No chance to fight them offAlways outnumberedDown for the countDead and left behindRavaged and slaughtered
