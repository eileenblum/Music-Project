Interruptive provocationof sacrificial nihilismSlaughtering without compunctionAgonizing, final torture Revocation, extinguish all hope for salvationDissipation, destroy their entire creation Terrifying congregationChristian eliminationAdulation, worthless gloryReprobation of the holy Sworn vengeance Anti-holy confrontationBitter ending of religionFable human fabricationMorbid servants fornicating Sworn vengeance In the name of nothing, they prayTo a leader conceived by rapeMother Mary, whore of GodTake home your dead children Vengeance upon the weak
