Dead to All, Pride of ManPure redemption fadedCatatonic, my existenceThe next turn awaited Consuming my mind, the beauty of my descentTake hold of your flameRepeat it, offender Helpless cry, dismal dreamsWretched souls awakenHated by all, resisted by someThis desolate wasteland For I will kill again Consuming my mind, the beauty of my descentTake hold of your flameRepeat it, offender Murder Tragic, senses failingIlluminating withinSoul by soul, thus I revelTendrils, blessed in sin Can't seem to stop the will to take hold of your soul For I must kill again Consuming my mind, the beauty of my descentTake hold of your flameRepeat it, offender Destroying my mind, the beauty of my descentTake hold of your flameRepeat it, offender
