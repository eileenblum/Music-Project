Dogmasomatic nausea Repellant dismayProvoking, they prayInferior race of putrid slaves The sickness beginsAs they fall on their knees for godAll that awaits is impurity My stomach turnsWith every move of their tonguesDogmasomatic nausea In swarms they have spreadIncestuous and uncleanPsychic dislocation, so deviant Unceasing phrasing their thoughtsWhy can't they seethat their words cannot be?Forlorn... Unceasing phrasing their thoughtsWhy can't they seethat their words cannot be?Giving me reason to kill Perishing hatePerfidious god depositionDown your knees, my saviourCast aside your dissentionYou are now just one of nothingonce in hell,You're dying and dying and dying againOnce in hell,You're dying and dying and dying... again
