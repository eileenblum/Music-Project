Decisive, the end result is clearOur future has come to an endThe tables turned nowToo late for final sacrificeThe Hills of Megiddo are near Relentless, this fury has becomethe scourge of our supremacyA silent witness, the bearer of it allWe all succumb to our own destiny To face the powers that beWe'll end this journey, and see, only,That the anger never diesTo fuel the hatred we can not seeFor we are blind Notions of vengeance, obsessing the protagonistWe play the lead in this unforseeing partVacate the lies, The parrish of our wounded hearts. And serenity is torn asunder I must have died a 1000 deathsErase the past I must have died a 1000 deathsErase the pastThe pain of life I am obsessedBlessed be We play the lead in this unforseeing partVacate the lies, the parrish of our wounded hearts And serenity is torn asunder To face the powers that beWe'll end this journey, and see, only,That the anger never diesTo fuel the hatred we can not seeFor we are blind
