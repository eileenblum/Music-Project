Me against the world in tyrannyOdious, bleak vision of the worldEnslaved, a den of iniquityHands grasp for the sickness to unravel As the world now turns, and we see the liesBow to this twist of fateLife ends, total retribution The gloves are offThe exchange of blows beginsSafety in numbersTime to fight something One of manyMany of none, a replicaThe vicious cycle, is a coda As the world now turns, and we hear the liesPredestined suicideAll ends, in remembrance The gloves are offThe exchange of blows beginsSafety in numbersTime to fight somethingA relentless forceDivide the herdThe massesThe path you wish to crawlEntangled lies, the charlatans doctrine Propagate your faithDisseminate like a cancerThe bowels of distress, we utilizeTo victimizeThe seeds of my dismay The table turned and time is countingAll pieces fall, so watch them tumbleTo the groundOur fight goes onThis'll soon be over Disconsolate, all signs of weaknessTerminatedDivide and conquerMeans to this endYou spread the liesNow we must fight Something...Everything...The opposition.
