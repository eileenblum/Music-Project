Nameless faces, their treacherous deceitCountless villains take their chance, for victoryBetrayed, and marked for deathBound for destructiondefeated they stand, the hunt is now over Where are they now?A legion, IncalcubleThis solace, my villains are all dead,all vanished, a token Burn these bridges, no traces left behindRetrace these steps never takenThis pain is an ever winding road that I must crossI'm left for dead midst these soulsI'm left for dead midst these souls Brace for this tidal fearNo mercy you will find, compassion is denied.Nameless corpses without identityCountless villains, deceased, and face their destiny Where are they now?A legion, IncalcubleThis solace, my villains are all dead,all vanished, a token
