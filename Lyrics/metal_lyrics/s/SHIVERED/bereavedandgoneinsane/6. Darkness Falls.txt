Red
All I see is heartless
People are covered in blood
Whole world disgust me
I'm afraid that
Sick I am or sick you are

Motionless
No light in sight
Frozen thoughts are engaging
Darkness falls for once for all
So close my eyes and take me home

Thread
Everyone is a thread
I feel safe no more
Voices won't hush in my head
I'm afraid that

Sick I am or sick you are

Overcoming the pressure
Fever kicks in
The eyes are looking
Mind is raging
I want to be alone
Just leave me alone
