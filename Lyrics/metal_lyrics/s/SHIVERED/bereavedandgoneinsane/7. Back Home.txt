Back home
So long winter
Shadow of memories
Follows me down
I know something is not alright

Years have passed
I lost everything
Pride
What's left is withered piece of flesh

Nightmares they comes alive
They wants me to change my mind
Nightmares they comes alive
They wants me to change my mind

I came late
They are gone
Now I'm on my own
Silent wind blows
Dead in motion
Psychological torture
Oh, what I did wrong?
Oh, God, it hurts
How could you just watch me suffer?

I made it
Though sickness burdens me
I never loved again
'Cause sun won't shine again

They made my scars
They let the pain flows
But this is not my end
I'll wait until I fade out

After years of isolation
Unknown voice has woken me up
Now I'm back home
Volunteered to risk the fear
To complete what I left undone
