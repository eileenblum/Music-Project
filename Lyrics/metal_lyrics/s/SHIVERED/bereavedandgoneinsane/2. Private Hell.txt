Bind my hands
Try to break me
You can't change what I am
It's me who decide

The anger in you
Motivated me
To endure your hate
My voice is my own

Fire up the gun
Let my flesh bury in freedom
People can't deny what they see
You're on your own to make your private hell

You can take my eyes
But you can't take my thoughts
You have me tied up
So show me what you got

I won't become a filth
You can't haunt me
You're wasting your time
Point the gun and shoot

Just let the justice decide
Then I see you erasing out
For a second your throne will become your grave
And the hell that you made will crumble on your head
You have not seen the rage of freedom!

We struggle to believe
That world is not a place
To live in peace
