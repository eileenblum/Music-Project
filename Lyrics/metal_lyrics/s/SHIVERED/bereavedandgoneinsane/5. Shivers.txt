If I could die this time
I'll haunt the world
And I'll take you back
We can be together again
Would you come?
I'm waiting for you
In this empty room
Magics will happen
If you open my wounds

Her demons
Distracts me
My demons
Punish her
On her knees

Shivers made me blind
Vision is uncomfortable
Her coldness
Frozen me
I can't make a move
My tongue is possessed
My mind is restless
