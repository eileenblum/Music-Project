The beauty of her
It hides the real evil within
It gives your soul a taste
A flavor of eternal pain

It grows
The girl
She haunts

She came like
Doomsday sun
Devoured my whole broken heart
Then left me with the sins
I told her stay away
But without her I'm lost

She caused a darkness
Then loved me ruthless all over again
The taste behind her kiss
A flavor of eternal pain

Doomsday here
All alone
I've been waiting for so long
