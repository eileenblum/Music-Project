Another door closed on me
Another reason to stay
I gather all my feelings
I ripped them up and watched them bleed

I don't need emotions
I don't need love
They are worthless when you're alone
You fight to survive
I fight to die
I'm sick of being sole

Suddenly everything disbanded
All the dreams I've been looking for
The sky turned grey and I cried
For the tragedy that won't be healed
From the holy love that lead to obsession
They grow my despondency

I tried to be like others
I colored my rusted soul
I calmed my weak depression
And tried to socialize

I don't need emotions
I don't need love
They are worthless when you're alone
You fight to survive
I fight to die
I'm sick of being sole

Cringe dread, cringe death
Break the nerve
