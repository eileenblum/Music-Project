Your words
In a shape of a noose
Evident in my mind
Your coldness
Plagued me from the core
Inside out
I relied on your light
I dropped my torch
Now it's all dark

My life
Your rejection
My fall
You watched me hanging
Your stone
Shaped heart
It crushed mine into pieces
In your silent
I can't breathe
In this season
Of fallen leaves
Are aware of what have you done?
With your words you disfigured my heart

Bedridden
Forever in this corner
I watch the crowd pass by
No one comes in
Doctor give me another shot
My mind it still function
I promise it won't kill me
I'm just sick of feeling
Put me to sleep
