Drenched in the rain
Motionless heart
I told my loved ones
Itâs my time to go

A restless desicion
Being on my own
So far away
I said goodbye

Iâm a leaver
Take this gift from me
Iâm a leaver
Would you sing for me?
Iâm leaver
Say your mystery
Through the night
Iâll fade away

The last night before I go
I burned my memories
Then I felt so empty
Inside
A restless desicion
Being on my own
So far away
I said goodbye

I wrote my last words
Hang it on the wall
Donât ever come for me
Iâm forever gone
