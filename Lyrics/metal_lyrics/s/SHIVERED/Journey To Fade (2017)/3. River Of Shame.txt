Failure
Be my sympathy
Itâs hallow in my capacity
If you come
Iâll melt to the ground
Yes Iâm ashamed and defeated
If you come
Itâll rain
And Iâll be the only one who cries
If it rains
My wounds will appeal
And Iâll be the only one who dies

Disaster
Be my only friend
Stand by my side and let me rest
Today might be my last day
To say that Iâm defeated

If you come
Itâll rain
And Iâll be the only one who cries
If it rains
My wounds will appeal
And Iâll be the only one who dies

Hurricane
Take me far away

I have lost my self
And lost control
Drowning in a river of shame
