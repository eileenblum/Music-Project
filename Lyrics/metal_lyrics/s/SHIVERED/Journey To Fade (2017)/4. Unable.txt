Time is rushing to itâs core
In front of me a hanged rope
All the moments are flashing above
Put me into the mental state of mind

From the darkness of moon
To the pitch black sun
I waited until I rememberd
The moment of truth

Dead promise
Dirty lies
I compromised
When you said goodbye
I clenched my fist
When you gone away
I was unable to follow you

Doomed in the circle of life
Victimized by mysefl
How I end up empty inside
Feeding myself with lies of past
