Your soul is pale as mine
Tangled into darkness
Iâm waiting for you to make my horizon darker

Beyond you a solitude of gloom
Beyond me a wreckage of doom
We both together can be life and death

When the black turns to white
Transfer my breath to your lungs
I step away from this life
And open up a way for you

Take this blood of mine
And let it flow through you
Accept my tiny wish
And let me live through your shell

Words fail to explain you
Halo in your eyes
Illuminates my inner darkness
Over and over again

Beyond you a solitude of gloom
Beyond me a wreckage of doom
We both together can be life and death

Iâve been betrayed
Iâve been betrayed before
You are my trust
You are my light when itâs dark
You are my darkness
You are my darkness when itâs calm
