Beneath the fallen one
A fire burns
Some of them survive
Some of them might dies

Like a hole
Right between your core
It drains your feelings
And makes you feel empty

Do you hear them
Itching on the surface
When you scream
They make you bleed from the inside

Do you feel the change
Or you got used to it?
Itâs crazy how much today
Made yesterday a better day

A song for the fallen
Rainfalls on my mountain
I stand on the edge of life
Look down through your heart

Our world an abandoned city
Storm passed us by
I swore I wonât let you go
On the day we lost our minds

We are the fallen ones
Survivors
Can you feel the world around you?
Cause mine is dead as before

Do you hear them?
They want to kill us all
They said it thousand times before
Do you even care?
