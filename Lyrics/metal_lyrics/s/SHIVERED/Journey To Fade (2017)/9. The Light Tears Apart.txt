Plauge
Halo of death
Wrapping the citiy
Once they get in you
You canât escape anymore

Creep out
Losing mind
Creep in
Screaming
Creep out
They are coming
Light tears apart
Be prepared

Dark illuminate the light
All the shades die
You canât hide in the darkness
Lower your true colors paint them black
So we can identify you

Tense
Twisted sickness
Drifting in your head
Once they get in you
You canât escape anymore

Creep out
Losing mind
Creep in
Screaming
Creep out
They are coming
Light tears apart
Be prepared

Dark illuminate the light
All the shades die
You canât hide in the darkness
Lower your true colors paint them black
So we can identify you
