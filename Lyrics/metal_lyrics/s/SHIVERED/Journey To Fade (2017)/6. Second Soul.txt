Empty of tenderness
Numb and cold
I know the methods of harm
Moon is lost tonight

Leave a mark
On my soul

You were my second soul
Why you sacrificed yourself to save my soul?
You had control over my anger
How could you disappear and die?

Unusual reactions
My mind is dead
Methods wonât work this time
Sun is lost this dawn

Leave a mark
On my soul

You were my second soul
Why you sacrificed yourself to save my soul?
You had control over my anger
How could you disappear and die?

Impact of delusions
The pressure is hard to hold
Blood will shed tonight
I close my eyes to come to you
