A jounrey to fade
Regressions took me back
Where I used to be on my knees
I wake up and exhale last nightâs pain
My river is filled up with ache and sorrow
You left in me

I go deeper deeper deeper deeper itâs all hollow

I feel itâs my time to explode
Iâve taken enough pain of you
Thereâs a panel on the wall
It says you reached the end of line

No reasons left for me to stay
All my hopes are laid in grave
Thereâs a darkness in this room
And only you can shine it through

Weeks has passed since you gone
Everything has turned upside down
I can tell you know about it all
Thereâs an evil in this home
She wants me die in any moment
For no real reason

I go deeper deeper deeper deeper itâs all hollow

I feel itâs my time to explode
Iâve taken enough pain of you
Thereâs a panel on the wall
It says you reached the end of line
Eyes are growing in the walls
Watching me drown
Their mouth are shut
And they awaits fall

They know my name
They know my pain
I want them go blind and burn away
