Disease of unknown
Implicated me
I sense no color
In this painted life

Red sky is calling
We all going to die
Red sky is calling
The crowd are dying

Give me a reason
To be loved
When everything is hated and violated
Give me your sight
Let me see, if this world is bright through your eyes

Everything I touch is numb
Lack of being alive
Tonight Iâm going somewhere
Somewhere but not here

Red sky is calling
We all going to die
Red sky is calling
The crowd are dying

Tell them Iâm drowned
My grave is nowhere to find
Tell them Iâm gone
Tell them I canât be found
