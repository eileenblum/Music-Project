A way to nowhere
Outcast and nameless
Astrayed to the darkness
With engaged mind

Concentrationâs Lost
Dreams are too far to reach
Dejection rise
Hopes are leaving with no trace

Fable of these emotions
Comes from lack of freedom

So you are my savior
Why you came so late?
They broke my wings
So I canât fly away

Do you know a way out?
They have closed the gates
I wonder if you can help me out
Eradicate me out

Time has slowed down
So lost in this momentum
Recurring negative thoughts
They have engaged my mind
Concentrationâs Lost
Dreams are too far to reach
Dejection rise
Hopes are leaving with no trace

Fable of these emotions
Comes from lack of freedom

I see the threats are coming
As Iâm caged inside this room
I scream out
My freedom has been killed
