Sleepless night time
Silent noise
Self made darkness
Comes to take you out

Sudden fear
Paralyzed you
The same fear
That you made yourself

You volunteered
To suffer for them
Now they force you
If you decline

Your desire for lust
Has become your death
Now you have been chosen
Sacrifice yourself for lust

Sing a song
For your misery
Sorrow will lead you to your grave

Unsettling disturbing visions
Have made you gone insane
You scream all the day
For the dread they caused you

Dance with the sound of sorrow
Youâll be alright
Watch the sky as it turns to red
Your end is near
