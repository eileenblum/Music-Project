We all are digging our graves
By wasting time
Unaware of time when we die
Our foolish greed

No matter if you win or lose
Your fortune wonât rescue you
Life is a short cruel game
If you donât play it, it will play you

You will rust
Beautiful
Time wonât wait
You canât stay young
So donât look back
Cause death is behind you
Darling

We seek for each others blood
Nothingâs enough
We lost ourselves in the wealth
Our foolish greed

Run, donât stop, the hourglass is running out
