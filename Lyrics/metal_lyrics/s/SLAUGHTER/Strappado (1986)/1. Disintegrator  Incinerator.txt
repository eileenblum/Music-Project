[Disintegrator]

One thousand miles per hour
like the streak of light
lightening smashes silence
blinding in the night
fireballs from Hades
colliding with the earth
witness frantic comets
the age of Hells rebirth
Smashing the sound barrier
break open suns at will
gaining on you faster
leaves jet planes standing still
scorch the moon to cinders
melt metal into lakes
Disintegrater likes it
Disintegrater takes Hiroshima was no match
dwarfed by this desolation
the haulocaust was nothing
by Disintegraters salvation
the Earth is smashed to pieces
universal rise and fall
the stars are now a waste land
Disintegraters called

[Incinerator]

Make way for the Incinerator...
In suits they were dressed,when the button was pressed

they fed upon semen,the governments a demon
they left us bleeding and sore,in the hands of the
incinerator
In the bible we looked while our cities all cooked
the mutants didn't learn towards Satan they turned
while the wind ripped and tore from the wrath of the
incinerator

[chorus:]
Incinerator
wood for a feast
Incinerator
when you expect it least
Incinerator
didn't learn from the past
Incinerator
to nuclear war we're cast...

And now the molds cast from mistakes of the past
we're all melting in this hot cauldron of sin
and through all his blood and gore comes the
incinerator

[chorus]
[repeat first verse]
[chorus]
