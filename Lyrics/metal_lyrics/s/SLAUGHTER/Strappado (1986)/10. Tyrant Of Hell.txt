Lord of the underworld
Plotting all your deaths
Set ablaze the gates of Hades
Fire in his breath
Rapes the sky of all the thunder
Mighty is his hand
Grand tormentor, iron king
Ruling hell's hot land

Tyrant of Hell
Torturing you slow
Tyrant of Hell
Extracting what you know
Tyrant of Hell
You're on the brink on doom
Tyrant of Hell
Is coming for you soon

King of the labyrinths
God of death and pain
Blood it flows free of vengeance
Fire in the rain
Christian god is so helpless
Taunted by the sins
Disembodied, holy spirits
The wicked always win

Tyrant of Hell
Torturing you slow
Tyrant of Hell
Extracting what you know
Tyrant of Hell
You're on the brink on doom
Tyrant of Hell
Is coming for you soon

Lord of the underworld
Plotting all your deaths
Set ablaze the gates of Hades
Fire in his breath
Rapes the sky of all the thunder
Mighty is his hand
Grand tormentor, iron king
Ruling hell's hot land

Tyrant of Hell
Torturing you slow
Tyrant of Hell
Extracting what you know
Tyrant of Hell
You're on the brink on doom
Tyrant of Hell
Is coming for you soon
