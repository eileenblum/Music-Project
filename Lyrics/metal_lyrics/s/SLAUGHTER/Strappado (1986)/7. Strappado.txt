Prepare yourself for torture
Prepare yourself to scream
this is no bloody story,ain't no f****** dream
Arms are tied behind your back
hands tight in a rope
suddenly your hoisted up,
shoulder blades get broke... Strappado
Put on a pair of Spanish boots
time to soak your feet
plunge them into boiling oil,
fried alive in your seat
Dangle up on sky hooks
Strappado drives you mad
Arms rip off,you slam to the ground,
pains the latest fad...
Strappado
