Shaking badly from your fear
Sweating madly, death is near
Time to die, your time has come
Now I got you on the run
Our to kill, I maim to please
Gonna drive you to your knees
Total killoff, life subside
I won't stop until you've died

Reach plateau of horrid fear
Attack, no mercy, shed no tear
Leave you flipping in the mud
Maim to please, I taste your blood
Sink my blades into the sweet flesh
Skin you slowly, bleeding mess
Total bloodsport, maim to kill
Die to please, your blood will spill

Shaking badly from your fear
Sweating madly, death is near
Time to die, your time has come
Now I got you on the run
Our to kill, I maim to please
Gonna drive you to your knees
Total killoff, life subside
I won't stop until you've died
