Like cancer he can kill from within
penetrates with evil and sin
hunts like a vulture for skin
slowly he infiltrates in

[chorus:]
Parasite legions-sucking your blood
parasite demons-drain plasma flood
parasite leeches-you'll never know when
parasite legions-sucked dry again

Like a snake he creeps in without sound
picks up your scent on the ground
infecting your weaknesses now
infiltrates sweating brow

[chorus]

Like a rapist forcing you all the way
like a parasite feasting on prey
weakens until you collapse
like a fool you fell into his traps

[chorus]
