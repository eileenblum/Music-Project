Into the dream world slowly I creep
into the land that I go when I sleep
This time I'm trapped and cannot return there are
certain things a mere mortal can learn
Wildest fantasy at first it feels good
slowly things happen not the way they should
You can control it and your ripped wide apart enter my
nightmare,it's only just a start
Jump out of bed And you're fully awake
feeling a tremor as the bed shakes
you realize it now and you muffle your scream you
awake in the hell we all know as "the dream"...
