One foot in the grave
Now you're almost dead
Close the lid on your face
Nails pierce through your head

Straight down you will fall
Into the black hole
Dirt surround your face
So take your last breath

Time to take control
Tear the lid of this box
Gasping for some air
Climb out of this hole

Fill in the wretched pit
Time to run like hell
Climb those fucking gates
At last I am now free
