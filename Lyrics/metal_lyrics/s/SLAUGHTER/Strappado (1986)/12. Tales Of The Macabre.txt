Listen to my tales of mayhem
that my mouth does spew
a horrid tale of gruesome hell
that's in the future for you
Twisting,turning,mind on fire
a fate you can't escape
hear my tales of the macabre
your f****** souls shall be raped
A few are willing to do my killing
a mindless,zombie race
laced with poisons,packed with guns
I bare all swords and mace
Decapitation will not be swift
I'm gonna deal the wretched blow
Hades assassin,killer supreme
lurk in the shadow of the crow
Tales of the macabre
Tales of the macabre
Tales of the macabre
Tales of the macabre

1, 2, fuck you

YEEEEEYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...
