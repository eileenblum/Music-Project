[Japanese Bonus Track]

You know my life has been through some changes
Seems some people don't want to hear my point of view
Lots of others, lots of others think that we got lucky
But you know brother, we all have to pay our dues

[Chorus:]
But the world's got problems and that's a fact
Let's open up our eyes
That's what matters, let's cut the slack
And let's all realize
If we all could stand together
And we all could live as one
If we stop all this fighting and set all our sights on love
It'll be a perfect world

From L.A. to New York City
There's a day in day out routine of what you've got to do
Please allow me to make a suggestion
Do whatever, whatever, whatever you've got to do
To make it through

[Chorus]
