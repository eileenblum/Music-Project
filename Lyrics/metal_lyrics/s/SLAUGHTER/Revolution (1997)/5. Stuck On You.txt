On my way to work in the morning
I got a flat on my car
I took some days off cause I had decided
To walk around at the mall
You don't see the snap shot baby
I've got the right to choose
It's a freedom of choice now honey
I got nothing left to lose

[Chorus:]
I'm on my way to the big time
What ya see is what ya get won't ya be mine
Hear the world call my name
You could be there too
Because one things for certain baby
Whatever happens I'll be here stuck on you
Stuck on you

I'm sittin' down on the couch
I'm at home now
I had a pint of ice cream
I jacked up my music up a lot louder
The police are at the door
I hope you can see yeah, yeah
It's all kinda under control
You should know me better than that cause
I always pay my toll

[Chorus]
