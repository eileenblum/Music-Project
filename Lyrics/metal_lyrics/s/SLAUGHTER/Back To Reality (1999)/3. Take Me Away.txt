Well your life seems zero and your past seems dense
Future falls from promise, what makes sense

Heaven Helps those who go and help themselves
The gates of heaven possess endless wealth

[Chorus:]
Take Me Away, Take Me Away, and Take Me to the sky
Take Me Away, Take Me Away, and Take Me to the sky

Living your life benefits mankind
No place for sorrow so don't you waste your time

Heaven helps those who go and help themselves
The gates of heaven possss endless wealth

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus]
