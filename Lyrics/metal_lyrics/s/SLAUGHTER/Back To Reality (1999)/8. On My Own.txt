Trying not to remember, but the memories lead rightï»¿ back to you.
Right back to you it's hard to face the reality
when you know there's nothing left to do

Many roads I've travelled, still I'm alone,
wishing I could share this moment with you

Still I can't deny that I want you back,
you've got me down on my knees,
cause now I need ya, more than you know
and here I am on my own.

No one knows what I'm feeling,
and it's not easy withoutï»¿ your love.
This emptiness that surrounds me,
cause you all that I'm thinking of.

Many roads I've travelled, still I'm alone,
wishing I could share this moment with you.

Still I can't deny that I want you back,
you've got me down on my knees,
cause now I need ya, more than you know
and here I am on my own.
