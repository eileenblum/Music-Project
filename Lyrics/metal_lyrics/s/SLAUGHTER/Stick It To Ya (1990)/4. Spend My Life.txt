I've been livin' in
This lovely world
Wishin' I could find
Someone to love
Hopin' someone would
Come from above
Change my life
Then I noticed you there
You were my angel
Sent from my despair
I know that you are
The lady who cares
I wanna spend my life with you
I wanna spend my life with you
I think of all of those
Sleepless nights
It's like the earth
Was standin' still
You know I hardly had
The will to survive
I wanna spend my life with you
Only with you baby
I wanna spend my life with you
You know you're my little angel
I wanna spend my life with you
Don't you know
I wanna spend all of my life with you, babe
Cause you gave me
All your loving
And baby I know it's true, ya
Cause you're the only one for me
Baby I'm the one for you
