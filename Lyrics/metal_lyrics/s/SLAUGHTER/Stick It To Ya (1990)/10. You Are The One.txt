Lookin' back on time
Ooh we had it made
Together we had the world
Just you and I
It begins to fade
Now I spend my time
Wishin' you were here with me
Oh I wanna tell you now
Wanna tell you now
Just look into my eyes
You are the one
The one I need
To make my dreams come true
Oh you should know
I love you so
And I can't go on without you
I walk the streets alone
Starin' into space
Ah you never told me
Why can't we talk it out, oh
All of these lonely nights
I lie awake waiting for you
Just waiting for you
Won't you come back for me
And let my fantasy come true
Just me and you
You know you make
My dreams come true, yeah
You are the one
Anytime day or night
You know it's alright
with me, yeah
