People try to push me
Around and around
They tell me what's goin' up
I tell them what's goin' down
Why don't they leave me alone
I'm just high on life
Just livin' on the edge
That's what I like
Ya don't fool me or rule me
I know better
Ya don't fool me or rule me
I can't take anymore
That's not enough for me
Cause if you want me,
You got to prove that you're true
Don't want nobody messin' round
Behind my back
Doing things that they do
Ya like to sit, rap, talk about it
Chit chat and smile
Kinda gossipin' about the scene
I don't want none of thatThat's where it's at
Come on, grow up, that's what I mean ya
You don't show me
How you feel
You try to hide it
But I'm seein' right through your lies
You don't know me
Well I'm packin' my bags
Cause that's not enough for me
