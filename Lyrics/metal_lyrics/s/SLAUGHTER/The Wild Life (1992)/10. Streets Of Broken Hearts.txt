Tonight,
I wish that you were here,
the thoughts and dreams were near...
I won't forget you.

Was it right?
The feelings from above,
I thought we called this love,
I won't forget you....

But those were empty promises,
and now I live in loneliness, oh girl,
Oh, my darling, It's so true.

[Chorus:]
I guess I'll walk along the streets of broken hearts again.
That's just the way we feel if all things are left unsaid;
All alone,
we'll walk the streets of broken hearts.

Girl, if we only let it show
but we will never know,
but I still miss you.

It's been so long
so long we've lived our lives.
I kissed your lips goodbye
and I still miss you.

But those were empty promises,
and now I live in loneliness, oh girl,
oh my darling, It's so true.

[Chorus:]
I guess I'll walk along the streets of broken hearts again.
That's just the way we feel if all things are left unsaid;
All alone,
we'll walk the streets of broken hearts.

[Guitar Solo]

But those were empty promises,
and now I live in loneliness, oh girl,
oh my darling, It's so true

[Chorus:]
I guess I'll walk along the streets of broken hearts again.
That's just the way we feel if all things are left unsaid;
I guess I'll walk along the streets of broken hearts again.
That's just the way we feel if all things are left unsaid;

Oh, girl, broken hearts again...
Oh, girl, broken hearts again...
