Ya know I'm headin' on out
Gonna take a little ride on the town
With my 350 runnin' hot
Nothing's gonna bring me down
I look over and over to make sure the man's not on my trail
So, I put my foot on the gas--hammer down to the nail

[Chorus:]
Ya know the weekend has arrived
Got a six gun at my side
We're gonna shake this place
'Cause that's the way we want it
Shake this place when you're goin' too far
Shake this place, gonna push it to the limit
And we're never gonna stop

You know my juices start flowin' and the good times start to roll
I've got my mind wide open and I'm gonna stick around for more
I look over my shoulder, let me tell ya what I did see (uh-huh)
Two of the opposite sex, hot and nasty lookin' at me

[Chorus]

I see the sun comin' up, put the sunglasses on my eyes
I'm gonna stay up through the day 'til the day turns back into night

[Chorus]
