You live your life tryin' to make ends meet
Just one mistake and then you're out in the street
Growin' tired, but you keep hangin' on
Here's a message to you my friend
Just search, you'll find the way

[Chorus:]
Now you're on your own, anywhere is your home
Keep on movin' on
Don't look back, just be strong
Now your life is your own
Keep on movin' on
Times they change

It's so simple you don't realize
You get those chances only once in your life
Alone and cold, but you keep hangin' on
Here's a message to you my friend
Just search, you'll find a way

[Chorus]

Times they change my friend (change)
If it was up to you, you'd never see the light
It makes no difference--ain't that right
But now you're really seeing what I'm talkin' about
Hey, you change those ways, oh yeah

[Chorus]

Times, they'll change my friend (change)

[Chorus]

Times will change
