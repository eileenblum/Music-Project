Let's start this party with a little direction
Raise your hands, c'mon and stomp your feet
We're all lookin' for complete affection
Forget your chairs, c'mon get off your seats
Let's all go and set the world on fire
Everybody stand up and unite
All of this twisting and turning and screaming and burning
This show stays open all night

[Chorus:]
Out for love
You know we're out for love babe
Love, love, love
Out for love
You know we're out for love

There's no control, it's like a fatal attraction
C'mon up just run through the aisles
No one can stop you, it's a chain reaction
So crank it up, this audience has got style
Let's all go and set the world on fire
Everybody stand up and unite
All of this twisting and turning and screaming and burning
This show stays open all night

[Chorus]
