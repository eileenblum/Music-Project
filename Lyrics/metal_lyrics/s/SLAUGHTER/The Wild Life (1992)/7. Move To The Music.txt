I'm in the mood
It's time to go out tonight
You're feeling good
Pulsating, going faster than the speed of light
I feel it touch me
Oh, don't ya know
That it's never loud enough for me

[Chorus:]
You've got to move to the music
You've got to live on rock 'n' roll
You've got to move to the music

Don't ya know it's good for your soul
Out on the town
Saw this girl she looked so fine
I'll tell ya now
Oh I love it
When I feel her body movin' close to mine
I feel it touch me
Oh, don't ya know
That it's never loud enough for me

[Chorus]

Can you feel it

[Chorus]
