Oh yea

It's so good to see you now
It's been so long since we've been together
You kept in touch somehow
You always found a way to be thereâ¦yea

I wish that I could stop the hands of time between us

All the days gone by
Do you remember when
We were the best of friends
All the days gone by
You know that memories never fade
As your watching all your days go by

They go byâ¦ oh yea

Looking back on younger years
That's what are hopes and dreams are made of

Oh

All the laughter and the tears
it's the feelin' of love that make us

Oh Oh yea

I wish that I could stop the hands of time between us

All the days gone by
Do you remember when
We were the best of friends
All the days gone by
You know that memories never fade
As your watching all your days go by

Ooooâ¦ all of the feelins
That we had before but through the years

Oooâ¦ those were the times

Oh yea

Alright

Whoa

The memories we share
You cant erase them from your mind

All of the days gone by
You know that memories never fade
As your watching all your days go by

They go by (they go by)
They go by (they go by)
They go by (they go by)
They go by

Memories never fade
As your watching all your days go byâ¦oh
