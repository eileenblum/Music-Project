From out of the dark 
The travelers approach us from the east 
That tells tales of old 
Stories of the gold and the feasts 
Don't know where they'll be tomorrow 
Aint gonna stop on the way 
Don't show the meaning of sorrow 
Who knows how long you will stay 
In an Unknown Destination 
Twenty-four hours a day 
In an Unknown Destination 
The only place we know 
Where win, lose or draw you can rage 
Many see the light 
while others choose not to agree 
The courage of the brave 
While many others save it for their needs 
Don't know where they'll be tomorrow 
onna stop on the way 
don't show the meaning of sorrow 
who knows how long you will stay 
Twenty-four hours a day 
In an Unknown Destination 
The only place we know 
e win, lose or draw you can rage
