Look into my eyes and tell me 
Is there anyone there? 
You point your finger and 
blame the world on me 
do you really care? 
Alone 
Alone 
Take us back to where we belong 
days last forever 
dream, life's not as bad as it seems 
And we all stand together 
As long as you don't let it all pass you by 
It'll be Alright 
It'll be Alright 
Now tell me mister, what's your 
point of view? 
Do you feel that way? 
I guess your past, it must be 
catching up on you 
Do you feel the pain? 
Alone 
So you talk to yourself 
Alone 
If you listen to your mind it yells 
Take us back to where we belong 
Where the simple songs and the 
days last forever 
Where all you have to do is 
dream, life's not as bad as it seems 
And we all stand together 
As long as you don't let it all pass you by 
It'll be Alright 
It'll be Alright 
Echoes of voices of all the people 
You once knew, they call your name 
You turn to look and find but 
there's nobody there 
Gazing out your window, tell 
me what are you looking for? 
It'll be alright 
Know all your problems are 
falling down like winter rain, 
ike winter rain, like winter rain... 
Ahh-Ahh-Ahh-Ahh 
Ahh-Ahh-Ahh-Ahh 
Don't ya know every 
things gonna be all right 
Take us back to where we belong 
Where the simple songs and the 
days last forever 
Where all you have to do is 
dream, life's not as bad as it seems 
And we all stand together 
As long as you don't let it all pass you by 
It'll be Alright 
It'll be Alright.
