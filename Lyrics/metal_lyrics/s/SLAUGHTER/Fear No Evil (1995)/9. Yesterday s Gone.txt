Jesse works till midnight in nowhere USA 
Pumping gas checking oil on a lonely interstate 
Walking down the highway, he looks up to the sky 
And he asks Dear Lord how will I make it by? 
You know he didn't have a nickel to his name 
Although he had a one way ticket just the same 
Yes, you know it's true, it's time to 
leave those things behind you. 

[Chorus:]
Treat everyday like Yesterday's Gone 
Treat everyday like Yesterday's Gone 
Ah move along, Yesterday's Gone 
Yesterday is Gone, gone, gone, baby it's far gone 

With a bag thrown over his shoulder 
Jesse had to hitch a ride 
All his friends said he's crazy, you'll 
never get to the other side 
With a hope and a dream and a 
promise, that's really all he had 
But he don't care 
Aint nothing gonna turn out that bad 
You know he didn't have a nickel to his name 
Although he had a one way ticket just the same 
Yes you know it's true, it's time to 
leave those things behind you 

[Repeat Chorus]

Yea ain't that right boys - C'mon hit it 
Many times I've wondered where Jesse is today 
Is he on top of the world or knockin' at heaven's gate 
The one thing I remember as I look up to the sky 
Was the look on his face as he waved goodbye 
He said Yesterday's Gone 
Yesterday's Gone...
