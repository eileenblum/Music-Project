NY city bout a quater ta 5 
She gets up and she leaves the room 
She hits the subway and she risks her life 
And dresses up in cheap perfume 
Ah whatever is good for ya baby 
Cuz family didn't treat you right 
Ah whatever is good for ya baby 
That's all I want, as you're walkin oh so right 
So many other sweet delights 
Cuz baby you'll be Searchin, 
Searchin, Searchin through the night 
Cuz baby you'll be Searchin, 
Searchin, Searchin with all your 
might for Mr. Right 
Hey now lady when ya gonna learn 
You said ya need to go and find yourself 
Played with fire, but now ya got burned 
Your broken hearts still on the shelf 
Ah whatever is good for ya baby 
Cuz family don't treat you right 
Ah whatever is good for ya baby 
That's all I want, as you're walkin oh so right 
So many others sweet delights 
Cuz baby you'll be Searchin, 
Searchin, Searchin through the night 
Cuz baby you'll be Searchin, 
Searchin, Searchin with all your 
might for Mr. Right 
Baby you'll be Searchin, yeah 
Baby you'll be Searchin, Searchin 
Cuz baby you'll be Searchin, through the night 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Cuz baby you'll be Searchin, 
Searchin, Searchin through the night 
Cuz baby you'll be Searchin, 
Searchin, Searchin with all your 
might for Mr. Right
