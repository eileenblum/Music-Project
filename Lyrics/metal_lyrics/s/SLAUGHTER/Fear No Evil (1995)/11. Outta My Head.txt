You've taken my heart and my soul 
I was capturned from so far away 
I've never known anybody 
Who could tease me and leave me 
this way 
I wanna touch you now 
I wanna wrap my lovin' arms around you 
Ya said you needed a man like me 
I'm goin' out of my head over you 
Now I find myself sitting so lonely 
Outta My Head over you 
But every time I keep finding I'm only 
Outta My Head, over you 
Outta My Head 
Outta My Head 
Your unspoken promises 
You seemed like my destiny 
Oh don'tha know you mean the 
world to me baby 
You're everything I need 
Your unspoken promises 
You seemed like my destiny 
Oh don'cha know you mean the 
world to me baby 
You're everything I need 
I wanna touch you now 
I wanna wrap my lovin' arms 
around you 
Ya said you needed a man like me 
I'm goin' out of my head, over you 
Now I find myself sitting so lonely 
Outta My Head, over you 
But everytime I keep finding I"m 
only Outta My Head, over you 
I wanna touch you now 
I wanna wrap my lovin' arms 
around you 
Ya said you needed a man like me 
I'm goin' out of my head, over you 
Now I find myself sitting so lonely 
Outta My Head, over you 
But everytime I keep finding I'm only 
Outta My Head, over you 
Outta My Head 
Outta My Head
