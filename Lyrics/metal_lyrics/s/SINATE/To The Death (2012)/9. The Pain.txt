Undying hatred has built up inside
A rage I can no longer hide
There's no denying the depth of this pain
I know I'll never be the same

You will never know
The pain
The pain

RAGE!
PAIN!
HATE!
PAIN!

I fucking hate this!
I fucking hate this!

Lost all control, the temper rapture burns
No time to think of who I'll hurt
No one is safe now, not even myself
the repercussions of my living hell
