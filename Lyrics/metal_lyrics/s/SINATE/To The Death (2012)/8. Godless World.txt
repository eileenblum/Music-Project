God fearing lunacy paves the way
For all this never ending war
Opposite believers, all must be killed
Rich and poor
Single minded tunnel vision
Their only view
Ignorance on all sides
Oblivious to the truth

All of your gods want war
Only your gods need more
To settle religious scores
Poisoning lives in a godless world

All generations inheriting pious hate
Brainwashed to the point that war
Is the right choice to make
The end of this deadly cycle
It seems will never come
Until a time when all false gods
Are worshipped by none. Not one
