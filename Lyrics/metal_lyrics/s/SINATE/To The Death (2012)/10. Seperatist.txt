This one comes from me
From the blackness of my heart
Straight out to you
In such a hateful fury
No need to name names
You know who the fuck you are
Your names not even worth the spit
You're just a worthless piece of shit

Deceiver, your nothing, a fucking liar
Never again will you betray my trust
And if you do then die you must

So quick to judgement
You do nothing for yourself
I'm succeeding in my life
What have you done with yours?

Deceiver, you're nothing, a fucking liar
When you're at your worst, please come ask for help
There'll be no hesitation, I'll send you straight to Hell

You're someone I can gladly say
I wish a slow death upon
I never want to see you again
Useless fucker begone
Just FUCK OFF!!
