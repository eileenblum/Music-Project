I can see it coming
I'm not unaware
Why do I not stop it
Why do I not care

Seizure!
Seizure!

I've done this to myself
Time and time again
When will this madness stop
Not before I'm dead

Fear consumes my body
Death is feeling near
No way to turn back now
Gone my time ends here
