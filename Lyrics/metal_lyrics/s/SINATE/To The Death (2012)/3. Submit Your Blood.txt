In the darkness I sense my becoming
Essence of my true self shown
I am a monster deranged by my intent
I do not feel, show no guilt

Pure evil flows through my veins
Unleashed, Hell is brought upon you
I will keep you with me always
From this life until the next

You will die for my sins
There's no escape
You cannot run from this

rapturous I feel as I feed on flesh
I see the fear in your eyes
You know how that you will die
The broken will of your soul submits

Submit your blood!

And when I have you in my arms
You will know the embrace of death around you
And if you think you're gonna die quickly
Well you better think again bitch
Cause this is gonna be slow

Of violent sins I have committed
None are as pure black as this
I am immune to the morals of humanity
This well of lust overflows

Now as your life slowly fades away
You see the insanity in my eyes
Of all the things that I've done to you
The worst is yet to come

You will die for my sins
Your soul is mine
There's no escape from this

You beg me for your life, but you won't make it
I'll grab you by the neck, and fucking break it
And when you finally die, we'll celebrate it
I'll lay your body down, and fucking rape it
