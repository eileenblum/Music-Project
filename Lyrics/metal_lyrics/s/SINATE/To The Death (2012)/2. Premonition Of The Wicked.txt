War, creator of madness
Born in Hell, but raised with steel
These memories black, they'll never heal

Spawned in the depths of darkness
Just another number, the nameless
Premonition of the wicked
And you'll never see it coming

Hidden
Take the shot
Bullet strikes
Your life is gone

Incarcerated, nothing left for me here
Retaliation, I'm the one they will fear
War, created this madness
Annihilation, killing those with my life
A mock existence, they're the ones who must die

Defenseless victims in target
No remorse, women and children
Bodies riddled with bullets
Bodies dropping like flies

Born in Hell, but raised with steel
These memories black, they'll never heal
War, creation of madness
No emotion, watching as they fall
Destroy the masses, kill them all

Spawned in the depths of darkness
I am the one, the nameless
Premonition of the wicked
And  you never saw it coming
