In the age of dark, a disease prepared to strike
There was no warning, nor no sign, it happened overnight
Spread like lightning, millions dying, gruesome findings
They could not stop it
Where did this Hell come from, is this the end?
Entire cities are wiped out, almost everyone is dead
Epidemic, devastating, killing half of the population

The black death
Infecting
Mystery killer

A sudden fever, spitting, vomiting blood
Livid pustules erupting, they knew their time was up
Melting from the inside out, pain and suffering
They're dead in hours

The black death
Nature's wrath
Death toll is still rising

Bring out your dead!

The most feared disease on Earth, is surely to return
But after all these centuries, is there anything we've learned
Mankind overpopulating, without doubt there will be
Extermination

The black death
Impending
Witness now the horror

The black death
Destroyer
Set the world on fire
