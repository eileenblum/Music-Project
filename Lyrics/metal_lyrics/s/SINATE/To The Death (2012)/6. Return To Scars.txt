I have been broken for so long
There is nothing left to lose
Of all the paths in life
Why is it this I choose?
To be held a prisoner
Depression's hands of doom
My shattered mind knows now
That certain death comes soon

I never wanted this at all
Thought I was invincible
Now I watch as my life fades away
Can I please start again?

Is there any hope left for me?
Or was my fate decided before
If I can only find the key
I might be able to unlock the door
I've been tempted to take my life
But there's something holding me back
There's got to be more to it than this
A better life to be had

I can see the light
I can't give in without a fight
There's only one thing left to do
I have to face up to the truth

I've looked death straight in the face
And conquered the fear I'd known
But although I try to erase
The ingrained scars are still shown
There to remind me of the past
Or are they marks of hypocrisy?
Because wherever I choose to go
My demons are haunting me

I cannot go back to that place
I'll never live through that again
Temptation is luring me
Tell me, will I ever be free?
