The great heathen army, invading, avenging
for the death of Odin's king
The Earth will be soaked in blood
Set out to punish the meek and the wimpish
Ideals that stand for everything that is despised

The strategy, supremacy
The prophecy, has come to be
Untouchable, unstoppable
Brutal destructive forces
Leaving the land aflame in it's wake
A fearsome king, awe-inspiring
Hellbent on total conquest, Valhalla will have to wait

Fight or die or conquer, clash of the cultures
Followers of the white Christ steamrolled by trained killers
The reign of terror, sacrifice the prisoners
Battered, bleeding, burnt and smashed
Surrounded by their dead

Left every village, smouldering, deserted
Brutal and ruthless leadership, not one life was spared
A proven ritual, witnessed in battle
Curse of the blood eagle
Enemies filled with fear
