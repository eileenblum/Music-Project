I've stepped into darkness
Within it I find
A new kind of being
And my piece of mind
The pain I can handle
The torture unfolds
Cos I know that I have
Secured my soul

That's why I serve my side

Black shadows mask my memories
What I should have been
But darkness shrouds my vision
What I am, I shall remain
You cannot imagine
The pleasure I take
In watching you crumble
When my anger awakes

That's why I serve my side
Step out of the light
That's why I serve my side
Step out of the light

I, will only bring you pain
You, will never feel the same
No one will her your scream's for help
Evil, is what I'm all about

That's why I serve my side
Step out of the light
Step out of the light
