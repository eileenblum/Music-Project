Killing
You only live for death
Reason
You have no reason to live
Worthless
Your life as it is
Justice
Is too fucked up to see

That you're hunting,
Around this town, ridding life
No one can stop you
Enjoy these times

A psycho society, is what we live in
There's too many chances, that have been given
There's no one around, to let you in
Just like the rest
You're a victim

Raping
Society is weak
Seeking
For easy prey to take
Laughing
While you inflict all this pain
Living
Are these lives that are deranged

And these lives that you take, are not just one
You don't understand
You were never even loved
