I've had it up to here with you
And all the shit that you've brought
Into my life, now it ends
Just to think I thought you friend
How the fuck did you think
You'd get away with what you did,
And what you said, and what you've done,
I'll take no more, come get some

I'll smash you down from your imagined state
Drag you down from reality
Show to you the real way, the real life
And what it all means
The memory of pain lasts for days
But you've not seen the brutality
That I'll deliver, and I will
The pain you'll feel, will last for years

Betrayer
King of betrayal
Betrayer
King of betrayal

So if you think your gonna get
Away with this, think again
I'm on your trail, I'm on your case
I'll track you down I will avenge
Betrayal is not a thing
I take to heart very well
Now you've added murder in
I'll make your life a living hell
