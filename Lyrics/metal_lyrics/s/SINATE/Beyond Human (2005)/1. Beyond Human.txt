Suicide
The next evolution
Soon to die
By your own infliction
Self Demise
Became your religion
Life's a lie
No point in living

Beyond human
Return of the next level
You are never going to reach
The final death ritual
Take you to the to the kingdom of god
How the hell can you believe

Abandoning
Your only children
Left alone
Lost in confusion
Your beliefs
Are so strong
You can't expect
That your wrong
Your fucking wrong

Indulging
In mass suicide
To join the
Hidden craft
To take you to
Heaven's gate
You can't evolve
It's too late

Beyond human
