Destiny has delivered me to fate
I have nothing to give you but hate
Unsuspecting victims they now await
My remorseless anger to inflate

Your final vision
You see dementia in my eyes
One last incision
To hear you scream before you die

Nothing can stop me from my addiction
To make everyone a victim
Of my hatred and my murderous ways
More deaths until the end of my days

Your still body to be disposed
I have to make sure no one ever knows
Of the pain I've brought upon you
And the future chain of murderers I'll pursue

Many more to die
The same way that you lost your life
And not one will survive
You'll die
