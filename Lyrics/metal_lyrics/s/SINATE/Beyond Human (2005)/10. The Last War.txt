Demons of Hell
Rise up against the righteous
Prepare for the kill
Show them the meaning of darkness
Satan has called
Gather your weapons for battle
Evil's on board
Unleashing the forces of chaos

Satan's taking control
It's the last war
Conquest over gods world
This is the last war

The war against god
Punishing those who are faithful
Revenge is at hand
Ripping the wings off angels
Fire and stone
Arrival of Hell upon earth
Victory's close
Dominions are changing hands now
