Under blood red skies, I hear the Sirens calling out. I hear them calling my name.
But when the lust turns into hate, the skies will blacken at my will.
Don't think, just bleed. I rid the earth of you. I rid the earth.
I used to be just like you. I used to reach out to anyone that would take me in.
No longer will I succumb to the wants and needs of a soulless harlot.
You lack conviction.
Drowning in a sea of remorse has taken its toll on me for the last time.
I've found myself washed upon the shores of desperation, lying at your feet.
But now the tables have turned, and I'm calling for blood.
I want your head on a fucking plate.
I used to be just like you. I used to reach out to anyone that would take me in.
No longer will I succumb to the wants and needs of a soulless harlot.
Goddamn Siren.
Don't think, just bleed. I rid the earth of you.
