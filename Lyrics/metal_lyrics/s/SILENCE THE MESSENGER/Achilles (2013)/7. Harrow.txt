Save your apologies for one with open ears and an open heart.
Too little, too fucking late. This bridge has been burned.
Don't you fucking dare tell me that everything will be okay.
I'm not believing in the words you say.
I've learned my lesson now I live to see another day.
When you look in the mirror, are you content with what you see?
Does your reflection show you what you used to be?
Too fucking late, this bridge has been burned.
I never wanted it to come to this. Now I owe you nothing.
Fuck your apologies, I've given you everything when you deserve nothing.
When you deserve nothing.
Don't you fucking dare, just save your apologies.
You really thought that you had got the best of me?
I'll tear your goddamn life apart and you'll lose fucking everything.
When you look in the mirror, are you content with what you see?
Does your reflection show you what you used to be?
I never wanted it to come to this. Now I owe you nothing.
Fuck your apologies, I've given you everything when you deserve nothing.
When you deserve, when you deserve nothing.
Too fucking late, this bridge has been burned.
This bridge has been burned, too fucking late.
