I am your executioner, a taker of lives.
I will never be satisfied, unless you're choking on the fucking floor,
begging me not to take your meaningless life.
This is not a dream, this is a motherfucking nightmare,
and now I'm never waking up.
I can't feel a goddamn thing.
You've woken the leviathan.
The blackest depths of Hell are in my eyes.
Come see this suffering.
The blackest depths of Hell are in my eyes.
Come see this fucking agony.
I remain king of everything you fear.
So take a bow, and say your final prayer.
How much more? How loud will you beg for me?
I am king, and nothing will hold me back.
I will never be satisfied, unless you're choking on the fucking floor,
begging me not to take your meaningless life.
I have prayed for a moment with God, and in return, I'm greeted by a sinister voice.
It's something deep inside of me, a hate that I want you to see.
You won't wake up from this nightmare.
I remain king of everything you fear.
So take a bow, and say your final prayer.
I am your executioner, a taker of lives.
