Open up. Welcome the Serpent into your home.
If you knew why I was here, you would pray for life in fear.
I've come to take what's mine.
Death is at your door. It's time to dance with the Devil.
No amount of pleading, no amount of screaming will prolong this massacre.
Am I, or are we, in Hell? It's time to dance with the Devil.
Open up. Welcome the Serpent into your home.
Death is at your door. It's time to dance with the Devil.
I find solace in the oceans of blood that I've left in my wake.
I bring tyranny upon your existence.
An orchestral arrangement will serenade us,
painting beautiful images in our heads as I cover these walls with your blood.
No amount of pleading, no amount of screaming will prolong this massacre.
Am I, or are we, in Hell? It's time to dance with the Devil.
Am I in Hell, or is Hell in-fucking-side of me?
