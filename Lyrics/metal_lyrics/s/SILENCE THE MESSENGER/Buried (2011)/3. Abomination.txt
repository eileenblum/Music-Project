You've been entombed and hidden from this world under six feet of remorse for your actions. But don't you reach your hand up through that dirt, 'cause I'm not bringing this one back to life. I know I've been here before this is Hell, and now you'll keep your head below the roots. Do as I've done, and watch this all decay. I've wasted so much time on what was inevitably a failure. The taste of blood from damage done is a constant reminder of this overwhelming defeat. And now you'll know what it's like to watch it all burn down. By God you'll know what it's like to watch it burn. And I've been here before this is Hell. Do as I've done, and watch this all decay. This is Hell. This is Hell and I'm never coming back. I've left this dying, bleeding, wasted far behind me. Now this abomination rests without life, and now you're hidden from this world, abomination. I've wasted so much time on what was dead from the start. By God you'll know what it's like to watch it all burn down. Watch as I embrace your absence with a grin on my face. I've taught myself from pain held too close, never again. Now this abomination rests without a breath of life. Now do as I've done and watch this decay.
