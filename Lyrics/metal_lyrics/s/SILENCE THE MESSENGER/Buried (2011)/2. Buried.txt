This is the last thing you will ever know. This harlot has found a resting place for every wasted moment. Nobody will know that you existed. Death will do you no favors. This is my absolution. This is my liberation. No more desperation. Dead...I've thrown away everything that you are. I belong to a future of my choosing. Every move you've made has been well documented. Your shackles of idiocy won't restrain me. So fear me, fear this. Fear everything you couldn't hold on to. Fear me, fear this. I want the world to see me bury you. So fear me, fear this plague.
