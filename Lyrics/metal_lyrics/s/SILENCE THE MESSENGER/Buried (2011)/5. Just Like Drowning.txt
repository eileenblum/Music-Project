If we were meant to stand on opposite sides of this river, then I will burn the bridge that leads to you. But what you're missing is misery, and I can't wait until your world is destroyed. You've gone too far. Now I'm surviving harsh reality, while you're just living a lie. We've resurrected the truth, but is it too late? Why did you take so long to explain this? And what a beautiful day when you finally come to your senses. I've been defined by circumstance, but not by choice, and now I've become the abandoned. And when I reach for the surface you turn away. I'm plagued with thoughts of regret eating away at my flesh. Day in, day out, I live this nightmare. I'm plagued with thoughts of regret eating away at my flesh. Put your cold, dead hands around my throat. What's one more round of suffocation when we're already dead? Now I find myself at the top of this mountain. With no reward for myself, I've been reduced to erasing your face. Slit the throat of what I'll never have, and with it's death, comes my release.
