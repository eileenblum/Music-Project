A long, hard road lies before me, but I can't see the end. The road to recovery is paved with broken glass but I must walk it home. The footprints that I've left lead to a broken past. I'm at the end of the rope been given, but it's all that I have. This is the face you forgot to remember. A lesson learned in carelessness, and as a result we must live with the choices you've made. Now I'm buried in shades of gray. Save me...Now I have been leaving a blood trail, and I'll let the dogs hunt me down. So this is it, I stand here with nothing left to lose. Now that I've got nothing to lose I'm still just buried in shades of gray. Who would've thought this ran so deep? This web I weave is filled with contradiction. I'm buried in shades of gray. I'm redesigning myself. This is a lesson that we've learned from being careless. So won't you riddle me this: Oh God, when does it end? When? Return. How does it feel to be a piece in my puzzle that should not even exist? I still reach out for an answer, any sign of hope. I know that I'm coming back empty-handed. Now you will see...everything I've done is for nothing, but I will leave a blood trail, let the dogs hunt me down. This isn't dead, this isn't over yet you bitch. Return.
