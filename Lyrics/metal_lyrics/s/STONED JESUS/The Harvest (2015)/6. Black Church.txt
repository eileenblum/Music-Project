Worn and confused, miserable man
You've got your blues, routine and pain
You found your sanctuary, a house on the hill
You got no doubts now and you never will
Yeah

Now when you're here, leave all behind
Cliches and fears of common mind
You searched for freedom, a place serene
We've got to offer what you've never seen
Yeah

The path of life had gone astray
Ruin and decay
Devoid of sins, nothing to lose
Not knowing what to choose
Your soul is lost, you're not the one
You don't know what you've done
The undertaker lights his torch
Welcome to Black Church!
