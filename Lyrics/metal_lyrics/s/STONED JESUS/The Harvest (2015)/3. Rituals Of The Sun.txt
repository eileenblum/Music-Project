Voices from the Past, buried in the dust
Wisdom that we knew so true
Buried in our grief, blessing the belief
Worship to the stars and Mars

Wisdom that we hide, bury deep inside
Waiting for the day to come
Waiting for the sign to commit in time
Rituals of the Sun as one

Rise up and fight for your Kingdom!
Stand up and fight for your King!
