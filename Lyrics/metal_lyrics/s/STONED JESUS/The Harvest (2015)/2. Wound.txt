Getting outta my cage, feeling fluids of rage
Coming onto the stage where the show is on
Waiting for the hurray, wasting another day
Comes the mutual abuse, we don't need an excuse
Like the dogs on the loose we go swinging on
Now the bruises are shown, you'll be never alone

All these words unspoken leave another wound

Trying to open my mouth, but the words don't come out
Even silence's too loud in this altered state
Tired to keep it in, you are my phantom limb
Now the balance is down, he is wearing my crown
I can't say what I found, it would hurt us all
And the harder his struck is the deeper you stuck

All these words unspoken leave another wound
All these resolutions leave too many wounds
