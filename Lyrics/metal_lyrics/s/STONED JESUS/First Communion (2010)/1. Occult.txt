Have you seen the stones from the sky?
Have you heard words that are unspoken?
Have you watched the rivers gone dry?
Have you felt balance is broken?
Fearless wrath and filthy deceit
Bear mighty's Heaven redemption
Those who are lured with wrong pagan creed
Face favor of the God's nation

Now we hide in forests and caves
We are the blasphemous children
Our witchcraft is saving the day
time will come to end kneeling

There will be no resurrection, no Messiah's will
The ones who priest anothers are unholy still
With sacred cross they carry God's name to your home
No witness to their cruelty but cathedral's dome, yeah
