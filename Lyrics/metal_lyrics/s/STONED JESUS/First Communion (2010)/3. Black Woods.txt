I, the Wizard of the Night. 
Know all things beyond the light. 
I know every human flaw. 
I watch darkness deadly grows. 

In this darkness, in this gloom. 
Dwells the Master of my Doom. 
If I follow all the rules. 
He will take me to his Black Woods. 
Oh yeah.  

Sun dims slowly like the fire. 
Moon dies in it's funeral pyre. 
All is silent, all beholds. 
As the path to Hell unfolds. 

From the south side side of the sky. 
Without asking reasons why. 
Comes the Master of my Doom. 
Now he's taking me to Black Woods. 
Oh yeah. 

Sun dims slowly like the fire. 
Moon dies in it's funeral pyre. 
I did what I wanted to. 
But forever closed in Black Woods. 
Oh yeah 4x 

Won't somebody tell me what the fuck is going on. 
I think I'm in trouble, I don't know where I belong. 
Soul's teared up in tortures, body's filled with merciless fear. 
I was wrong, it's not my fault, what am I doing here. 
In Black Woods. 

Time to pay the price, to look what you've got for what you sell. 
This place's even worse than burning pits of Bible's Hell. 
You were wrong, you chose your path, too late, it's turn to loose. 
Forever imprisoned in this magic of Black Woods. 
Yeah. 
Yeah!
