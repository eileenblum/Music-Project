This beautiful skin you have just drives me insane 
I cannot sleep, cannot eat, and you are to blame 
Your black eyes are cruel but I want you to be mine 
And one of these nights I swear 
I'll drink your red wine, yeah! 

You're crawling behind the trees, I smell your perfume 
Why are you doing this to me, my sister of Doom? 
Your thousand admirers are waiting in line 
But I'll be the first tonight 
To drink your red wine! 

Thorns of rose are no longer sharp 
You know this is time 
To create the tainted potion of 
white milk and red wine 

There's no-one beside you now, you've nowhere to run 
I won't hurt you anymore, my work's almost done 
You were too proud of yourself - that's your only crime 
Now I fill my bottles with Your magic red wine! 

Thorns of rose are no longer sharp 
We know this is time 
To create the tainted potion of 
white milk and red wine, oh yeah
