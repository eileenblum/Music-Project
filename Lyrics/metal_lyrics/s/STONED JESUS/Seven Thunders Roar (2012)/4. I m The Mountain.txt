Days go by but I don't seem to notice them. 
Just a roundabout of turns. 
All these nights I lie awaken on my own. 
My pale fire hardly burns. 

Ahhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhh

Never fell in love with the one who loves me.
But with ones who love me not.
Are we doomed to live in grief and misery.
Is it everything we've got?

Ahhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhh

I'm the mountain, rising high. It's the way that I survive.
I'm the mountain, tell my tale. The greatest story's now for sale.
I'm the seaside, I'm the waves. I'm the one that makes you crave.
I'm the valley, I'm the hills. Look at me im standing still.

I'm the mountain, I'm the plains. Tell me now am I insane. 
I'm the spirit, I'm the source. I'm the root I am the doors.  
I'm the road, long and hard. Running out of my heart. 
I'm the mountain, climb me up. And we never gonna stop. 

I'm the locker, I'm the key. I am who you want to be.
I'm the reason, I'm the blame. I will never be the same.
Mirror mirror tell the truth of the old ones and the youth.
Of the things we hide deep from ourselves.
Mirror mirror show me now what will I become and how.

For now I'm just a Mountain. 
I'm the Mountain! 

Down the road that leads me to the Headley Grange
I see a figure of a young man
He's torn with doubts, mistakes, his selfishness and rage
But doing all the best he can 

I'm not so blind to see. 
That this young man is....me.
