I'm an Indian
You can tell me by my eyes
I'm an Indian
White people always lies
You brought deceases, hunger and greed
You took our horses, women and seeds
But I'm an Indian
Stepping out on the path of war

I'm an Indian
You will never conquer me
I'm an Indian
Won't falling on my knees
Your stupid gods never help you this way
This is my land and here I stay
'Coz I'm an Indian
Stepping out on the path of war

Why did you do this I don't know
You had to leave, you had to go
Now you're all damned, yes you all cursed
With every day it's getting worse
