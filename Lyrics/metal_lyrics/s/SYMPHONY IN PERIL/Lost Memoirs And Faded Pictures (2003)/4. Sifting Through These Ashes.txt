there is much to be gained from the disregarded ways of the past.
how futile we have been in our new ideologies.
fighting against what we have become.
burying us a under a cloak of religion.
collapsing fragments of life have fallen down around us.
on our knees we try to piece things back together.
parts like sifting sand slip through our fingertips.
within these ashes lies beauty forgotten.
search us to find what has been lost within.
reveal what we do not see in and of ourselves
