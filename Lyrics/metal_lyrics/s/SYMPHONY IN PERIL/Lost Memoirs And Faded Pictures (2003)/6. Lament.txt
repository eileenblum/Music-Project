let's not let the sun go down.
to me, tonight is like a farewell from a silent yet beautiful dream.
why do I have to run away?
i want to stay with You.
i don't seem to want to understand.
it is so cold inside this shelter that I call home.
laying naked in the winds of reform.
dragging my feet and covering my ears.
i want to escape, to break out of this norm.
i am crying for more.
