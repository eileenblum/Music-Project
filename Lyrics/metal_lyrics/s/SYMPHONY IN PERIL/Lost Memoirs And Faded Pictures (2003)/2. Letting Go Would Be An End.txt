this moment will bring us there as we drink from each other's eyes.
as i slip further into a tranquil time of abandonment,
i find that it would be a relinquished dream not to stay.
within my buried heart there is a fire that is burning with an emotion,
unsealed by no other.
to let go at this point would be an unforgiving end to this affair.
like a blanketed child i am covered with wings of adoration, it is so warm.
these eyes are shut for fear of opening to an end.
i know i can't hold on forever but stay long with me
