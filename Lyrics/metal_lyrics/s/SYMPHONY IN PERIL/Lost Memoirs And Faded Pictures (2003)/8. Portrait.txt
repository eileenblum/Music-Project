we serve god in the image that we have painted.
honor and reverence has been filtered through the sifter of our minds.
cultural influenced thinking
and misspoken word have distorted the truth.
so many times we have taken a past experience
and allowed it to carry us to the future,
while new revelation is placed on the backburner.
then we wonder why illumination is so dim in our lives.
the more extensive our comprehension of god's greatness,
the greater god can move upon the canvas of our lives,
to paint a portrait of honor
