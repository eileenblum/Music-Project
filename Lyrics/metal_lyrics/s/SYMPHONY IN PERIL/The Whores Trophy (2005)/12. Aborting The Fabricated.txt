Each time you break me, my heart grows fonder.  These passions inside yearn for your ways.  Nothing more needs to be proven to me.  Bury your fist in my chest, and rip out this plague.  Revitalize this life within.  Eradicate the scales and open my eyes.  My life is in your hands.  I have prohibited the faulty words that have echoed around me.  Erroneous counsel I strip away in order to invite your whisper.  Confine me by your love.  These restraints I invite to rid the vanity of self-reliance.  I live this life for you.
