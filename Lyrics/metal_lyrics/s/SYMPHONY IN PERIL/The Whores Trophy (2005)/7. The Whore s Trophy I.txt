You try to allure us in scarlet.  A killing time for the disposable and deceived.  From this cup is the blood tainted by the formation of depravity.  Dieting on your new wine.  What a mystery you have become.  Captivating us by the savor from the golden cup.  We are left drunk with a new doctrine.  Your prostitution will collapse that which makes us your harlot's embrace.  I decline this bitter taste.  Our lamps lie half empty, yet we will refuse and watch your burn.
