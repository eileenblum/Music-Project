Perverted by her beauty, enticed by her charm.  Come again.  Come again to the cup of blood.  Deception comes in a form of another.  Come again to the cup of blood.  Dripping from your lips is the new doctrine.  Don't turn away from your first love for the love of another.  She is a liar, deciever, manipulator. my Jesus come, my Savior come, my Lord come.
