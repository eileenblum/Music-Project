This methodology has tied you down.  Walking the fine line.  This line has become your threshold, a strategic inflection point between the truth and religious entanglement.  Discernment has been lost in translation due to pride's open door.  What is left is a scarred tommorow due to forgotten yesterday.  Your days are no longer lined with scarlet thread.  This garment's structure has been woven by a new manmade routine, leaving the truth behind.  When will you die?
