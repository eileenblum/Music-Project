Yours eyes peirce right through me, unvieling the hidden elusiveness within.  These patterns you witness have become my crutch.  Your eyes are your ammunition.  Your gaze is killing me.  A substantial blood loss that is not my own and it is pouring out of me.  This assault will bring me strength, increasing stability not to collapse.  This is a dagger to the heart, an unrelinquishing torture, but this soon will assemble me.  You murder face to face.
