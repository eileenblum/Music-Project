Let's wash tonight away down the river of discarded thought, embracing the moment and letting go of every apprehension.  Can't tonight be about us?  I just want to look into the windows of your soul and get lost in you.  I want to unleash this desire inside.  Yeah, even the ones we tend to forget about.  Let's wash tonight away down the river, and letting go of everything and everyone but each other.  Let us not deviate from the script that we write in each other's eyes.  It is becoming hard to breathe.  If I could hold onto this instance, I would.  The night fades, will our love?
