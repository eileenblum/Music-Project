Close your eyes
Wait for them
Excorcise
Evil whims

Walking dead
Have no soul
When they touch you
Feels so cold

"Hold your breath baby
we're roaming here tonight"

The thirteenth of November
A haunted friday night
The graveyard gates swing open
Crypts all spring to life
Rotting hands dig upwards
Searching for moonlight
The fog rolls in so thickly
It creeps into your mind

Walking dead
Have no soul
Walking dead
Feels so cold

Frozen winds of winter
Pound like an icy hand
Morbid lifeless armies
Devour all they can
Nightmares you once feared
Aren't nightmares anymore
Plunge the knife into you chest
And join the hungry horde

Walking dead
Have no soul
Walking dead
Feels so cold

Nightmares you once feared
Aren't nightmares anymore
The frozen winds of winter
Taught you the final score
The thirteenth of November
The fog rolls in on time
You and your friends shall rise
And join the feast tonight

Walking dead
Have no soul
Walking dead
Feels so cold

Walking dead
Walking dead
Walking dead
