Welcome to darkness....

Take me away
Away from the window
Keep me in chains
Hide me in shadows
Don't want no light
Shining on me
Experiments failed
Now sunshine blinds me

Long live disciples of night
Long live disciples of night

When I was young
They took me from home
Chained me to darkness
There's no light in my soul
Now I am older
Become of age
Vengeance inside me
Has grown into rage

Long live disciples of night
Long live disciples of night

Church bells ring louder
I am on the street
Signal dedectives
Who will never find me
For I live in the graveyards
Imbedded with souls
I never existed
And that leaves you cold

Long live disciples of night
Long live disciples of night
Long live disciples of night
Long live disciples of night
