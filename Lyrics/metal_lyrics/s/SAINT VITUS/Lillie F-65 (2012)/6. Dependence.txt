Woke up sick, again today
A new gash on my face
Can't remember what I did
Now the pain sets in

Don't know if it's night or day
It doesn't really matter
I just need a little crumb
Anything to keep you numb

Woke up sick, again today
It doesn't really matter
My end is here, nothing else to do
I depended on you
