Why do I scream at them
They never listen
Why do I beat my head
against the wall
I made a simple plan
They complicate it
Now they're near the edge
Let them fall

Why do they make my life hard
It's so damn easy
But still they choose to fight
Among themselves
And when they cry about
Their poor existence
The only one who hears them
Reigns in Hell

This rise of mysery
Is never ending
It feeds upon
Corrupted souls
I stand within its wake
And watch the suffering
As the hand of pain
Keeps control
Why do I scream at them
They never listen
Why do I beat my head against the wall
I made a simple plan
They complicate it
Now they're near the edge
Let them fall
