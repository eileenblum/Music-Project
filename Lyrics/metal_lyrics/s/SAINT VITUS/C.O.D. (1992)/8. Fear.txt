In the dark recesses
of your little mind
I begin to breathe
It's getting near my time
As the bloody rivers
flow through your veins
I am growing stronger
You'll never be the same

If you think I'm nothng
You better think again
Once you get me started
You will never win
You'll feel me inside you
When you're all alone
Common sense will leave 
Then you're mine to own

Feel me 
I'm part of you
Feel me
I know you do

Now you're sweating ice
You shake everyday
And it gives me pleasure
To watch your world decay
As you split your seams
And your nerves are shot
You cannot face the world
All control is lost
