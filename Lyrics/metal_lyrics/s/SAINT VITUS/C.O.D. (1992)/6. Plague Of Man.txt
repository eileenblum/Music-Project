Come and listen to my tale of woe
My final downfall came not long ago
I have got a disease that breeds tears
It's been plagueing man for years and years

Everybody here knows how it feels
When the heartache grows beyond unreal
All you do is think about that girl
Then the madness cracks your eggshell world

Everything around you falls apart
We have lost the race right from the start
Nothing left inside a washed-out brain
Weighted down forever by her chains
It's the plague of man
