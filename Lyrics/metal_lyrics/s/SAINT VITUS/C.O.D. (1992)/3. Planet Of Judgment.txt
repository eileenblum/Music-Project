Stranded here, a thousand light years, away from home
Blackened clouds, fill their horizons, storms to come
They cut down their forests with steel jagged blades
And poison their air
Scorning the surface with nuclear waste, nature crys
We saw them fight their, wars again, they never won
So unwise, so surprise, their own demise
Pain and starvation throughout their nations, unjustice prevails
Falling from grace, destined to die, we wonder why...
"Heed the warning, time is dawning, come ye faithful,
meet thy maker... it's (his) time"
Stood there helpless, saw their sun set, so relentless,
The very last time
What made them wander, this trail of sorrow, that has to end?
Signs around them, plian and simple, they chose to pretend
Now nothingness is all that remains, a pity and shame
Should've learned to, follow the rules, if you decide
To play the game
Planet of judgement
