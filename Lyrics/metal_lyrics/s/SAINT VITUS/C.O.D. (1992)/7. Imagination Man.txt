Listen to me
A teller of tales
Of knights in black armor
And maidens in veils
Gather 'round me children
Gaze upon the sky
Imagination takes you
Higher if you try
Backward through time
You travel with me
To days of king Arthur
And dark history
Beware
Draw your sword
I can smell
The scent of war
Crusades won
Battles lost
Innocence
Pays the cost
Heroes die
But legends remain
History tells us
Again and again
Gather 'round me children
Gaze upon the sky
Imagination is the
Only way to get high
