I am the screaming star
You don't remember
I am the jone who started
The fucking game
I am the screaming banshee
That you don't recall
I am the one who
You think has lost it's name
Listen and you will hear
That I have been there
Keep your head alive
I'm the only one
Take a good look around
I am there, man
I am the one who's left
When it's said and done
You try to ignore me
But that won't work, dear
I am the tortured sound
Within your ear
Just like the needle, hot
Piercing inside
I will change your life
Control your fears
