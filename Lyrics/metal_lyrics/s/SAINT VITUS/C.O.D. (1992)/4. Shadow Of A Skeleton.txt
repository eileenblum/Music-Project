By the moonlight
I arise
To set you in my sights
You can't touch me
Don't even try
For I'm the ruler of the night
Like night-shadows
I can't be seen
So I can infect your dreams
Grisly settings
Are my home
Feel the fear in your bones
I'm walking as a skeleton
You're in my way
I'll take your precious mind; and
Turn it to clay
Out in the shadows
You'll run into me
Just like a velvet chill
I am inside thee
Call me fear, call me terror
The name it matters not
Once I work my way inside you
I am all you've got
Bring me happiness
I'll give you pain
And leave your fuckin' body drained
You're the one who
Asked for this
Next time think before you wish
After nightfall
I'll be there
To take your mind into my lair
Are you dreaming?
No this is real!
Self-made agony, you feel
