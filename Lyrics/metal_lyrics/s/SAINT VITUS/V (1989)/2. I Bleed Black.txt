Open my veins
I do it everyday
I live in a dark world
Where death is just an L.A. game
Feelings of caring
Are something I lack
Slice me wide
I bleed black
No one comes close
Nobody dares to care
I can tell by their eyes
They're just a bunch of fucking
Unaware squares
They can't tel just where I'm at
Slice me wide I bleed black
They say I'm crazy
I should be locked away
But no bars can hold me
Still spread my decay
Hurt my bad side
I'll make you crack
Slice me wide
I bleed black
