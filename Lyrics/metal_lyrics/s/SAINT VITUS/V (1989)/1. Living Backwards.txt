I've been gone forever
Lost in my own zone
Wandering a wasteland
Trapped here all alone
No one here to help me
No one even cares
So I became the ruler
of the land of despair
Tried ti catch the fast lane
But I was left behind
Now I'm only chasing
The colors in my mind
Dreams were made for mortals
None were left for me
So I'm living backwards
The past is all I see
The past is all I see
