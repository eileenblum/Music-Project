"I'll give you the creeps!"

Creepy feeling deep inside
Makes you sweat, burns your eyes
It's behind you, then it's not there
Drives you crazy, pull out your hair

Try to live a normal life
Too much pressure, too much strife
You missed the edge, you're locked away
Live with your fears everyday

Creepy feeling deep inside
Staying with you, runs your life
Doctors let you out today
They say you're cured, you're just not safe
