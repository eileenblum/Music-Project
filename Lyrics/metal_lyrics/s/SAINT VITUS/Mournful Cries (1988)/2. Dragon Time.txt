Frightened people listen
To a dragon's growl
It's sleep was disturbed
Now it's time to prowl
Off in the distance
Villages burn
Frightned people running
Next, it's their turn

It's dragon's time in the village tonight
People screaming filled with fright
No way to save their simple homes
Dragon't breath is burning bright
Lighting up the darkest night
Leaving desolation all around

Ancient wings unfolding
The lair's come alive
Ancient lips are cracking
As they're grinning wide
Taking to the air
With gleaming yellow eyes
Driven mad by hunger
In search of any life

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat first verse]
[Repeat chorus]

Leaving desolation all around
