Skull and crossbones ï¿½ a field of black
Thunder roars ï¿½ lightning cracks
A phantom ship ï¿½ she appears
Lost horizons ï¿½ suddenly near

Neptune please help me
Don't want no burial at sea

Hear their laughter ï¿½ bloodless shrieks
Tell yourself ï¿½ dead men can't scream
One legged spectre ï¿½ riding high
He's commanding ï¿½ the rape of the sky

Neptune please help me
Don't want no burial at sea

Twilight killers, blood stained teeth
Guiding you into the reef
You are smashed to bits, far below
You're one of us now, you've got no soul

Join the dead men ï¿½ who cannot die
Committed forever ï¿½ to soar 'cross the sky
Skull and crossbones ï¿½ a field of black
Laughs insanely ï¿½ but no one laughs back

Neptune please help me
Don't want no burial at sea
Neptune please help me
Don't want no burial at sea
