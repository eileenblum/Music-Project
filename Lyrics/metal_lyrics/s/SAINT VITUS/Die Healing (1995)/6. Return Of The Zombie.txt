Crack the surface
I arise
hungry again
my gray insides
can't wait
can't wait to begin

arise, arise

You send the same ones
to hunt me again
a foolish try
you cannot kill
what's never been
I shall feed tonite

arise, arise zombie

The little ones
taste the same
it makes me smile
and the holes
in front of my skull
shine with something vile
I leave no marks
I leave no trace
just a body, drained
and in the morning light
you'll find
not even a stain

Arise, arise
