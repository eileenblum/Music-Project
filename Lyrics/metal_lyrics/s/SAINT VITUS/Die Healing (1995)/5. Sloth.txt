Can you feel the evil
can you hear the wail
the sound of destiny
sharpening its nails
the scent of corruption
from a race called man
the beast now declares
it's time to bloody the land

Beware The Sloth
Beware Here comes The Sloth

Can you hear the war
can you feel the plague
as it slowly moves
along the path you've made
now it's right behind you
you can run no more
it's time to pay the piper
time to settle the score

Beware The Sloth
Beware Here comes The Sloth

Realize you're the mother
of this demon you face
you have given birth
to the end of our race
you look for someone to blame
but only dead are around
the beast knows you by name
in his wrath, you go down

Beware The Sloth
Beware Here comes The Sloth
Beware The Sloth
Beware Here comes The Sloth
