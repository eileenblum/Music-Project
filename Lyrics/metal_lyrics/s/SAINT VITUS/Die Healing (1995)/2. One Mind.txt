Release your head from the world
keep yourself underground
no one understands your mind
grown tired of screaming
and talking to the walls
no one understands your mind

Humans programmed like robots
making sure you don't belong
no one understands your mind
live with the constant knocking
from the fools at your door
no one understands your mind

Searching hell for the exit
never to be found
no one understands your mind
if you could stop the world
you would take your leave
no one understands your mind
