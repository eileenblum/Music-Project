They never saw
the indications
they never saw
her eyes go vacant
and now she lives
on medication
she's got a lifetime
reservation

She's hooked up
to a machine
so they can watch
her sick brain scream
electro-shock
therapy
is all she needs
to keep her happy

There's no way out
once you're in
there's no way out

The catacombs within her
bleak and dreary mind
altered just for research
she's lost all track of time
she lives in unreality
knows not even her name
the world around her changes
but her cries still sound the same

Insanity
is contagious
I speak
from experience
they never saw
the indications
they never saw
my eyes go vacant

There's no way out
once you're in
there's no way out
of the asylum
