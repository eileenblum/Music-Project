Foggy morning drifting 'round you
Blackened haze
You can't see past your trembling hand
Pounding footsteps right behind you
Every day
Shadows from an empty man
Look behind you

Echoed screaming in your ears
Constantly
Reaching for your loaded gun
Ringing in forbidden fears
Suddenly
Look behind you as you run
Look behind you

Turn the corner, dead-end street, you can't go on
What are you gonna do?
By yourself right from the start
You live in doubt
Everything was all dreamed up by you
Look behind you
Look behind you
Look behind you
