Life has become too much for you now. it's so pathetic, you're nothing new. We've caught up with you now. this life is up, I'm gonna end it slow. You plead for release, but I'm never gonna let you go. Your time is up, life's at an end. No one will cry when I take you. Your life was worthless, you're better off dead. Dead. No tears for you, these actions leave me numb. Now the pain starts to sink in, as you feel it. Rip away the flesh, to show what's inside. Ripped from the chest, taking my time, I loose control. I won't let you die. Not yet, I'm gonna keep you alive and make you regret everything you've ever done. You hope it's over soon, it hasn't begun. I won't ever stop, take on the world for all that I've lost. For all I've lost. I'll never fucking stop. I will never fucking stop.
