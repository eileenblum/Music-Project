I am the end of everything you've ever wanted. I'll kill your dreams and make you fall. You were so fFucking stupid, you never learn; just shut your mouth. These words don't mean anything when you can't back them up. A scalpel is the answer to the problem that we share. It aids in cutting through your neck. It slices through so slow, to make sure you feel every inch. Enjoying in the work I've done, I almost forget your loved ones. Your seeds wiped off the earth, the babies die before their birth. The world is the reason for everything I do. After you're done, they'll witness every part. This is the way I solve everything. I have nothing left to lose, hiding in shadows, waiting to bring death to those who don't deserve to live. Feeding on fear now, I'm yearning for screams, yearning for screams. Taking the ones that come near, so many ways to inflict the pain, so many ways to inflict this pain. There's so much power in submission. Now, now she begs for your child's life. Beg for their lives.
