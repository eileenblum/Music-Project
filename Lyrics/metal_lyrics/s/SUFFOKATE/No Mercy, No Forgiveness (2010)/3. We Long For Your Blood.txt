Dismemberment - it's how I get revenge. I'm taking the pieces I value. Here comes the chopping block. Your neck is next, just hope the blade makes it through. Eyelids torn off, to let the truth in. This aggression stems forth from my frustrations. I want to hear your last goodbyes. Don't look around for a rescue, 'cause we all want you dead. This storm of hatred can't be stopped now, and you're gonna suffer. No one is gonna save you now. This soul is blackened, no light shines in. The last chance of life you had left just came and went, like a bullet through the chest. How does it feel to be strapped down? Life's almost over, stop breathing, you're out of luck. This is what happens when I left it all go. No one is spared. I hear the voices. "Hack the head," they beg me. "Saw through the neck," they're screaming. We long for your blood.
