Hatred has consumed me, my black heart's full of rage. Empty inside - this life is fucking pain. The world is breeding such despair. How can this life exist? All should pass, none deserve this. We kill ourselves, but never fast enough. No purpose in life - no mercy in life. Honoring no god, no creed. Your false prophets will not save, save me. Condemning all of us - I will hurt mankind. Sights of death will fill our eyes, you who believe will die. We know there is no heaven, no hell. No god would let us live, we spread like cancer. Not afraid of death, I welcome it. Awaiting my destruction, condemning all of us - I will hurt mankind.
