Choke on these words, you don't deserve to live. Breathe it in - it overtakes you. Your lungs, they start to fill. My new obsession is a constant urge to kill, setting my sights on you. Twist the knife and open the wounds, they won't close. Now you float, you fucking float. Power is addicting. Your life's in my hands. Holding your head down, just breathe, breathe it in. Spreading disease and treachery, tonight is goodbye. Pressure is building, waters weight on your lungs. Too blind to see you're worthless, you're all worthless. We are a plague upon ourselves, in the end we mean nothing. I hate this place and everyone here. Come at me with all you have, I want to take you all. I hold no preference for life, nothing is strong enough to take me, I know I want this; taking on everyone. Nobody will stop what I have become, because you see I can't give it up now. Here come the last thoughts you'll ever think, it's time to sleep. Eyes closed forever.
