These eyes are cold, it seems all has changed. What once was is now dead. Hollow, empty yearning for the past. A time when all was well, before this plague had spread inside. When did we fall? When did we die? The scars never seem to heal, but still we strive to find something. We never will. Why can't we see it will never be? Every time taking a part of life, they'll never get it back. Try to move forward but stay in the past, some just forget to move on. Leaving behind broken ones, how could we be so blind? The ones we fear are inside of us, we knew not how horrible we are. These things we do, these things we look past. Importance fades as excitement comes, memories forgot in the thrill. This has broken me, but I won't go, but I wont go. We are the guilty we should pay. Becoming the nightmare.
