This has been pushed down for too long. I can't stop it now, you will all pay for what you've done. Murder is what you deserve. I'm the last thing you're gonna see before you die. One by one you're going to fall. Mark my words, I'm gonna take you all. Tonight's the night the knife will start talking, each cut's slow so you feel it. Taking the time to take your life. Torture is a sight to see. Not so smart now, look what you've become - reduced to pieces. Don't cry to me, revenge is necessary. A spreading disease; a disease. This will hurt you more then it hurts me. And this will be the end. This was your choice. I'm getting my revenge.
