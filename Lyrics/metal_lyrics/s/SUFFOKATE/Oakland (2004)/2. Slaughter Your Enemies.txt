exploded
nourish this flame its been built on the ones we hate
never knowing a last cry destined to bleed
gates of fire come back brutality beat down
with a vengeance of taking you
i can't
i could not wait for your death
lets face this lets face this GO
lets face this fucking defeat
lets face this fucking defeat
lets face this fucking defeat
lets face this fucking defeat
defeat defeat
all that i must know is was it all worth taking my life
gates of fire come back brutality beat down
with a vengeance of taking you out
in the dark of my eyes to the front of blade
when i was cut off it faded away
nourish this hold it close nourish this don't ever let it go
remember remember to
SLAUGHTER YOUR ENEMY [4X]
just kill the lights i just can't wait
just listen why i just can't wait
I'm buried alive
