earn your life you should have tried in the ruin of my heart
this time i prayed and nothing changed i waited for nothing
this time just die NOW right now
chosen one prayed for a scared that who sets the truth
i am a wound i recreate the night of your life is sealing your fate
every crisis faced right now
try
torn away i don't know torn away
i infected the truth i have crawled from the earth
times up for payback and brutal shot is what will paralyze you now
to the world of everything turn away from the execution
move this shit
all i know it never dies been detached from the strand and numb like a wound
from what i know and where i have been
go alone stay away from me go alone every crisis faced
Silence the world a cover up for the witness
testing me don't come around overbearing i can't wait
for death now overjoyed everyday simplified now I'm back
and you can come threw
alone
