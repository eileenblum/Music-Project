lets light a spark a new world war for uncontrol no will no way
i will not pay for bastard ways i am the anger that destroys this fucking place
no purpose for taken over i will end lives your time is up I'm taken over
push till they break you'll play the victim i play the pistol and paralyze
you'll play the victim i play the pistol and paralyze your life
i will not rot i will reject
overjoyed for broken terrors what the fuck your sadness kills me I'm the only
one (fuck you)
angels die in time will pay for immortal ways this time it war one for pure
return i wait as shadows set i see this whole world die
all i have left has been taken away
all i feel is hate all i feel is pain in this world all i see is hate in my
fucking world i must kill this life
