I've been betrayed
This entrance - will silence the hype - learn from me - i will infect you all
i hate this - every single time - controlling my state of mind payback for only ones who leave
payback for only ones who speak time is slowly burning from your brutal
turmoil
there is no reason for this right now i tried
Burning eyes-stay inside my fate dies beautiful eyes closed for good
something i loved-
id rather die then be torn away Burning eyes stay inside my fate dies
beautiful eyes
closed for good something i loved betrayed,betrayed,go away,betrayed
Coward
your done for good coward liars destroy your friend
no more waiting I've almost healed now
