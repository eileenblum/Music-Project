Trust has failed
dark skies faded quickly i did not know
then i bury pieces of you in shallow holes
i will arrange a death by fire please save me this time
based on your words of soiled truth and i will fade away
for the chances you never got to know and my betrayal
dark skies faded quickly i did not know
then i bury pieces of you in shallow holes
in my shallow grave i await betrayal
embrace this pain built on my world
its give or take when you play this game
your time is up
unscarred we break
silence forever silence
