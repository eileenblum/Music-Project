End of life on this day we await are own deaths then we looked to the sky
and the sun goes red and something will never change End of life on this day
we remain alone and still we remain alone yet still we remain undeafted
i demanded life in the time of a outbreak entrails of bloods
forever marking this day a straight line round up
murder all who crosses me and in time you will
remember this
there life mean nothing and one day you'll hail me
upon the days your blood smeared on my fist
silently awaken unholy deeds you should not speak
end of life on this day we await are own deaths
then we looked to the sky and the sun goes red
and then we will all die
long misery decapitation each burden crosses my mind again
i will tolerate this execution it burns,burns,burns,burns
and forever will not clear your mistakes and in time they all fall
upon these days immortal plague of death for the ones who stand in my way
your final breath will be heard by me your life will soon become incomplete
i wont die till you have faced defeat i wait for the day are paths will cross
so you can witness my wrath you'll bow on your knees in hopes i set you free
you'll die with no remorse from me
you'll die forever pain
you'll bow on your knees for forgiveness
