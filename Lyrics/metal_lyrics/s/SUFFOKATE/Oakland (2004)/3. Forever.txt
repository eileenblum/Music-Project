welcome to my shadow I've been here forever
waiting on your presence still i stand unbroken
i have always believed this and you were so fucking cruel
in your darkest of hours you will be waiting alone
[4x] power-molds-static [2x] static
Dark trials dark trials
and your wounds they make me numb
my fatal shot
cause i have a war in me-overlooked for so long
and the cost is your life its done
a mainline,a function
the joy of dishonor-bleed for the weak one
that made you hollow in life-hollow in life
i have waited for so long
[4x] fatal shot
my fatal this fatal the fatal shot
