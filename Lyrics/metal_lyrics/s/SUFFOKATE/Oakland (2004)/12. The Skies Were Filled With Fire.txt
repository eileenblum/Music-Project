End your life â embraced by the flames
When will the bloodshed ever end
Millions will die as this plague unfolds

You'll be marched face to face â the battle has began
A war of angels searching for souls â that they will never own
Blood will flow threw the streets â theres fires all around
This will be the end

Millions will be cursed by your ways â your greed your jealous
The heavens fade away

In the time where all gods die â as you pray for truth inside of are embrace
This will be over soon
The screams of misery â a thousand condemned souls
Cut my throat and walk away

I bring this plague forth â as a warning sign for you
We will watch the heavens fucking burn
Will watch it burn â as darkness nears
All hope is lost

Embraced with broken arms that will never catch you
We all know that this will be the end
Embraced with broken arms that will never catch you
We all know that this will be the end

This will be extinction

From white to red i will paint your heavens
From white to red i will paint your land

The skies were filled with fire â all hope had been lost
All hope is lost
