we must make this sacrifice
and these eyes will watch you die
the accomplishment of this casualty
your hopes and dreams fade away
round one/let em all fall/let em all/they will not resist
reality has came around now undecided no longer can i
control fate ,i cut rip destroy to terminate your fucking life
you will drowned in your sorrow for centuries
overthrow the ones who are weakening
departure,the passing, for the souls I've released
an exit wound is a bloody scene
duel yell
i live to watch the blood fall
streams of red
all in dyer pain
suffering of the masses
no justice no peace
i despise-all the ones who have doubted me in life
i despise-all the ones who have failed me again
and when they come back/cut em off
eye for and eye
carnage/hatred/death the cycle of life
in science gun shots of revenge scatter blood all
over the place
annihilation/sweeping through
passing over/a million souls
eternal sleep/ rotting lives
carnage/hatred/murder/death
