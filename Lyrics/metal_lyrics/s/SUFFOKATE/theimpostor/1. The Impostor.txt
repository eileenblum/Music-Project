The crown is mine
Uncovering the eyes of the blind 
Victims of your ignorance and vanity
Your Mouth 
gaped and over flowing 
choking on a phallus of lies 

My prayers for vengeance 
Will be answered in due time

Your acts
Examples
Of the child still inside 

My prayers for vengeance
Will be answered in due time

Your acts
Examples
Of the child still inside 

This crown
This crown 
This crown
This crown
Will be mine
This crown 
This crown 
This crown 
Only worn by the divine 

This crown
This crown 
This crown 
Will be mine 
Be mine

Your reflection in the water 
Consumes your weak and ignorant mind

Lost
Scared
And Searching for what you've lost inside 

I'm gonna cut your throat mother fucker 

Now alone and distracted
Ive Beheaded you on the throne 
Just another example 
For the next bitch in line

Dumping your body
In the trenches 
Amongst the filth and grime
Your bodys now
Covered with blood
From victims of mine

Your voice infecting
weak and innocent minds 

My voice
Immortal
Everlasting 
Transcending time 

This crown
This crown 
This crown 
This crown

From your hands to mine
Only worn by the the divine 

This crown 
This crown 
This crown
From your hands to mine 
Divine
