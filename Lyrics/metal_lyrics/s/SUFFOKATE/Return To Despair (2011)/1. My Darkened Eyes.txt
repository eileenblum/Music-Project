Do you remember the way we used to feel
Before we changed, before our eyes were truly opened
I miss those days I miss the ignorance
Before we lost the light that's in our eyes
I miss the innocence I miss it all
I don't believe in hope I just believe in pain

I can see everything and everyone for who they are

I can see everything and everyone for who they are

I can see everything and everyone for who they are

Not six not seven not hell not heaven
Not six not seven not hell not heaven

I am a series of small victories and large defeats
Incomplete, obsolete I can't feel a thing
There is a place in my heart that cannont be filled
I miss the innocence I miss those days
Id rather forget its easier then when I give a shit
This pain is constant I see no miracles
There's nothing left for death to take away

I see no miracles.
