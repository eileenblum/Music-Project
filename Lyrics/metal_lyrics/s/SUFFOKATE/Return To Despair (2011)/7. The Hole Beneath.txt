I'm standing on the edge watching the world fall apart
We finally see the truth
I watch it all turn black

The sky is falling on me
I'm waiting for the end of days
As this hole beneath me grows
I see the end I wait for it to swallow me

SHAKE THE GROUND

Nothing will last forever, nothing is what we are
Nothing is what we will become
Nothing will last forever, nothing is what we are
Nothing is what we will become

This plague has no cure
The things we love will die
We are alone in this life
We finally see the truth
I watch it all turn black

The sky is falling on me
I'm waiting for the end of days
As this hole beneath me grows
I see the end I wait for it to swallow me

SHAKE THE GROUND

Nothing will last forever, nothing is what we are
Nothing is what we will become
Nothing will last forever, nothing is what we are
Nothing is what we will become

Nothing will last forever, NOTHING IS WHAT WE WILL BECOME

Nothing will last forever, NOTHING IS WHAT WE WILL BECOME

Nothing will last forever, NOTHING IS WHAT WE WILL BECOME

Nothing will last forever, NOTHING IS WHAT WE WILL BECOME.
