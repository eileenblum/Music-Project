Return To Despair

We are the ones who will darken above
We are the ones who will tear down the sun
Knowing nothing but this hate we feel inside

We are all lost

You can't turn back time don't try
You can't turn back time
You can't turn back time
So many of us are incomplete

We are the ones who can't feel a thing
Those words I used to believe in have lost
Lost all there meaning

Now I'm standing here screaming
All the times I've wanted to end it all
I know you know what I'm saying
I've thought it through a hundred times over

Return To Despair

Everything I use to belive in
Has lost all of its meaning
We are the ones who will darken above
We are the ones who will tear down the sun
Knowing nothing but this hate we feel inside

We are all lost

You cant turn back time
You cant turn back time

This place is driving me fucking insane
Let it all go

FUCK EVERYTHING

FUCK EVERYTHING.
