Burning a hole inside of myself once again
I can feel the fire spreading
And it won't, it won't ever end

BURNING, BURNING

Burning from the inside out

BURNING, BURNING

Everyone fades away
Every time I close my eyes
More and more just burn to ashes
With the hope of a new light
That ends when I close my eyes
Time has come and gone
Memories asre a thing of the past
I'm holding on so tightliy
But I feel I'm losing my grasp
I'm losing my grasp
Everything is starting to fall
It begins to collapse on top of me
It's crushing, its crushing me down
I can feel the weight
Crushing me down, crushing me down
Crushing me into the ground
I am empty
This shit's hopeless
I am empty
Always hopeless, always hopeless
Burning a hole inside of myself
I can fell the fire spreading
And it wont, it won't ever end

BURNING, BURNING

Burning from the inside out

BURNING, BURNING
Everyone fades away
Time has come and gone
memories are a thing of the past
I'm holding on so tightly
But I feel I'm losing my grasp
Time has come and gone
Memories are a thing of the past
I'm holding on so tightly
But I feel I'm losing my grasp.
