Born into this everyday is another problem
Born into this everything has become nothign

I can not fill this void endless

I wanted something more form life
There's no solution it's fucking endless
Nobody's really alive
Just waiting, just waiting

Waiting to die

All that you see will soon perish
We all fade away
Decaying faces surround me

We all turn to dust

What has happened to mankind
No way to stop what has begun
No way to turn back time
No light to bring us back
Blacken the sky, life is underserved

FUCK THIS

There is no light to bring us back
I hoped for so much more
But now I don't belive
I don't belive in anything
Nobody's really alive
Just waiting, just waiting

Waiting to die

All that you see will soon perish
We all fade away
Decaying faces surround me

We all turn to dust

The darkness consumes us all
And soon we fade
Decaying faces surround me
We all turn to dust

The darkness consumes us all
And soon we fade and soon we all fade away
Nobody's realy alive
Just waiting, just waiting
Waiting to die
All that you see will soon perish

We all fade away.
