Bury me
So no one knows where I am
Away from the world away from you all

Bury, bury me

I don't ever want to be found
I have no faith, I have no faith
I have no faith in this world, it lets me down
I have no faith, I have no faith
I have no faith in this world

No time to justify the reason
I don't want something to belive in

I have no faith, I have no faith

I have no faith in this world it lets me down

Everything's falling apart and all the time has stopped
Everyone's face is dark

All I belive in is hate, there is no change to escape
I will be buried today

Everything's falling apart and all the time has stopped
Everyone's face is dark

All I belive in is hate, there is no chance to escape

I will be buried today

I have no faith, I have no faith in this world it lets me down

I have no faith, I have no faith

Hell is behind my ruined face.
