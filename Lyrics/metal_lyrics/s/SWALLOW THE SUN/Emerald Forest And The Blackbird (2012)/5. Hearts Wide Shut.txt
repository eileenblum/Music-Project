Talk to me with words of sorrow, 
the only words I learned to know. 
Be still my bleeding heart, while I hold my breath 
and wait for it to pass, but it never will, never has.

Your loving light will only wake them, 
make them appear from their hiding.
Would you make them disappear?
But no one can, not even you.

I crossed the oceans of tears 
and sacrificed all these hearts 
on the altar of you. 
But these same ghosts will haunt me
until my last days,
one by one risen from their graves
telling me I'm not worth being forgiven
for the all hearts wide shut.

The white veil falls upon your face 
covering the scars and tears.
And as you walk down the aisle 
the marble steps end, and you fall. 
I won't be there to save you; 
I'll let you fall, just like the others before.

I crossed the oceans of tears 
and sacrificed all these hearts 
on the altar of you. 
But these same ghosts will haunt me
until my last days,
one by one risen from their graves
telling me I'm not worth being forgiven
for the all hearts wide shut.
