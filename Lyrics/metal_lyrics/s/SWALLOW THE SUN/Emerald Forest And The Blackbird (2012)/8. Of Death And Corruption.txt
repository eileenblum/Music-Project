Felt my back bleeding, 
heard the song of a siren;
the forerunner of death and corruption.
I've already hit the ground,
nothing you said was true.
Were all the vows meant to be broken?

Some wounds will never heal, 
some day even queens will die. 
Some day even nations turn their backs 
after the chants of devilish mouths.

Lie deep in your lies, keep telling you love me; 
the chant of death and corruption. 
I still hear the words that let me down, 
something deep inside you died that night.

Some wounds will never heal, 
some day even queens will die. 
Some day even nations turn their backs 
after the chants of devilish mouths.

That night showed your true colours, 
pure blackness and filth. 
Once loved, once admired, 
dead to the world from now on.

Some wounds will never heal, 
some day even queens will die. 
Some day even nations turn their backs 
after the chants of devilish mouths.
