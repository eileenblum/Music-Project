We turn away and erase the pain,
let it lie in the deepest shades of guilt and blame.
Cover it under these chords so shallow,
hide it between lines so narrow.

But the words are just too strong to speak, 
they will only destroy us.
Like two towers we stand,
stand strong, but hurt.
Until we crash down with only one word.

Where is the end of these emerald woods, 
the first light of the new morning?
Have we walked too far in this gloom 
to sense the pure heart of doom?

We left our souls in the cutting room 
and play the roles of silent killers.
Here we stand at the edge of truth 
and still let the cold paint our skin.
And blinded we step straight back into hell.

But the words are just too strong to speak, 
they will only destroy us.
Like two towers we stand,
stand strong, but hurt.
Until we crash down with only one word.
