You are nothing but a shadow
of the beauty what you used to be,
blank painting with silver frames.
You know when things turned all so wrong?

Afraid to tell the truth, locked inside yourself.
I promise this won't hurt you, 
at least as much as all these lies.

You are nothing but a shadow
of the beauty what you used to be,
deceitful and shallow; yes, 
you know when things turned so wrong.

Dim line between two broken hearts,
long road to perdition.
One will stand, one will fall.

See the stars, touch your scars,
face the dark eye to eye.
Touch the stars, feel the warmth,
my love, this cut is the deepest.

Dim line between two broken hearts,
long road to perdition.
One will stand, one will fall...

You are nothing but a shadow
of the beauty what you used to be,
deceitful and shallow; yes, 
you know when things turned so wrong.

See the stars, touch your scars,
face the dark eye to eye.
Touch the stars, feel the warmth,
my love, this cut is the deepest.
