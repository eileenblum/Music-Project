I yearn for your soul,
I yearn for your skin.
The blaze in my eyes 
shines bright as the great northern skies.
I'll catch you when the night falls,
morning calls.

Close your eyes, make a wish.
You know it's never going to happen. 
In this place we all die alone.
Hate, lead the way!

I yearn for your love,
I yearn for your blood.
The blaze in my heart 
lies deep as roots in this ground.
Take me into you,
take my hand, or I'll kill again.

Close your eyes, make a wish.
You know it's never going to happen. 
In this place we all die alone.
Hate, lead the way!

They want you,
and I'll catch you 
when the morning calls.

Close your eyes, make a wish.
You know it's never going to happen. 
In this place we all die alone.
Hate, lead the way!

Close your eyes, make a wish.
You know it's never going to happen. 
In this place we all die alone.
Sleep well, my dear!
