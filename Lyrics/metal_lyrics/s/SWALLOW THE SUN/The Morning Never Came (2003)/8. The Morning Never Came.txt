[Lyrics: Raivio]

One night it happened
The morning never came
It has been snowing ever since
The plague of cold harvests the land
And only few still wait for the sun
Cities are buried under white curse
Remains of the man lay on the glacial ground
The monuments of ice curve upon us
Leading our way to the bitter end
One night it happened
The morning never came
The clocks tick anew this same hour of dark
And if we had only known
That it would last forever
We would have forgiven ourselves
And let the snow bury us together
One night it happened
The morning never came
Now it's been seven years ever since
The season of dark fell upon us
And only few still wait for the sun
