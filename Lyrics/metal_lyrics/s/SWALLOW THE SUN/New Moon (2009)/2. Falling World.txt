Hold me, this world is falling down on me
Feel it, is it the dead or death
that walks among us?

Close your eyes but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away

Hold me, few more steps and I will fall
Watch me, I'll take you with me
Too sad to leave alone

Burden on my shoulders, the curse of man, no stepping back
I'll take you there - no life, no cries, no more sleepless nights

Close your eyes but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away
