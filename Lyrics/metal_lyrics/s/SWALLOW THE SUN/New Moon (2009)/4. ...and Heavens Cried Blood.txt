And heavens cried blood as
I swallowed the poison from her lips again
And heavens cried blood
I felt no regrets for her death

No need for sympathies, what she got is what she deserved
She blackened the world, she blackened the sun

These drops of blood won't wash away your sins
I buried you deep to forget the pain
But every night I see you through sleep
Another cold night, neverending hell

Skies opened, red started to flow
It is murder
Sun shed its last rays, the seraphs fall
The angels are gone
The end will surely catch us all

And heavens cried blood as
I swallowed the poison from her lips again
And heavens cried blood
I felt no regrets for her death

Skies opened, red started to flow
It is murder
Sun shed its last rays, the seraphs fall
The angels are gone
The end will surely catch us all

Sun shed its last rays
The end will surely catch us all
