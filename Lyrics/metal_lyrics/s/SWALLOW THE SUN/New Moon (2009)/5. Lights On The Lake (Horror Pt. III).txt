Father, why did you drown me here?
In these waters
And father, why did you leave me here?
In deep waters
Father, it's getting darker here as the years pass
And father, I'm the whispers on the lake
Lights on water

My child, I carry the burden of sorrow with your soul
The songs you gently sing to me
But the love was never stronger
than the grief of your unholy price

I curse you forever in your watery grave, you passenger of evil
For taking her away from me
The blood of your arrival, cutting knives and shadows
A ceremony of pain
Through living flesh to the dead, both in my bloody hands
But only one cried

In blazing fury I carried you through the woods
While the trees tried to stop me in horror
Your cry echoed on the lake as I laid you down on the boat

The tears made circles on the still water, the circles made the waves
The waves raised the tide and made the rain fall
Raised the lights on the lake

Through the mist, further on the lake
In the eye of still water
Into the deepest pit you silently fell
Slowly in the throat of dark water
