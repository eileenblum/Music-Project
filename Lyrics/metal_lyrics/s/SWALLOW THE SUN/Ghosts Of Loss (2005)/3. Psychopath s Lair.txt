Wash your hands
And light the candles
Turn the lights out
And I'll turn the music on

I'll serve you food you've never tasted before
And after the midnight hour
I'll treat you like a real man should

This is a portrait of a clear mind
The profile of my kind
I'll bring flames on your face
And when I'm done
You'll become one of mine

Her eyes shine like the glow of the sun
As she poses without a shame
But if only she could know
Where she has come...

This is a portrait of a clear mind
The profile of my kind
I'll bring flames on your face
And when I'm done
You'll become one of mine

I'll take you down to psycopath's lair
I'll drag you there, to the psychopath's lair
I'll take you down, down to the psycopath's lair

This is a portrait of a clear mind
The profile of my kind
I'll bring flames on your face
And when I'm done
You'll become one of mine
