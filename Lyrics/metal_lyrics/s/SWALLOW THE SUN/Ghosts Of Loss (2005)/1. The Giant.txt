Falling from my life deep to the sea
Drowning from living to the depths of me
Like the water that burns in my lungs
And the light that slowly fades above me
I'm bleeding rivers and they carried me to the sea
Crushing in this pressure, turning to stone

Roots rip my flesh and fill my skull
As worms dance around my drowning body
Feasting for the one that has gone...
But I'm arriving, closing the door, ocean floor

Seven steps from my cradle
Closer to the end with every breath
What is this hell that was made for living?
I am arriving

The giant has grown too big inside me
Mountains of black stone, a volcano of dirt
When it went wrong? Why am I here now?
But not for long...

Climbing up from this nest of nothingess
My faihthful steps behind me
Marking my trail with circles, a path for you all
We've been ripped out from the womb
Through blood and pain into this life, and we cry
Ripped out, given, but made to be taken away

I've been hiding this giant for too long
And it's grown like a parasite inside me
Under this shadow I've been walking
Now it's taken over me, and she...
The pure girl, leave me before it's too late
Or I will cut your wings

For I can't control this that burns
It flows inside, through my every vein
It fills my fingers and burns my throat
Chains my heart again
Insane pain

I throw myself into this stream
And let it take me down, underground
Here I end, from here I begin
The line is broken like my fragile body

Flesh rots before the giant's eyes
As he awakes from his silent rest
Rips open my chest, steps out from this crest
Don't take over me please, leave this lonely man,
Please leave.
