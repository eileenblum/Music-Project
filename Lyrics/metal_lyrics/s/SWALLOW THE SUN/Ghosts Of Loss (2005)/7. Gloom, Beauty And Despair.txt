The velvet fog came after the sun wept her last rays
Shedding her tears for the night,
The night she'll never see
The all-seeing eye, the dead light of luna
Watched as the gloom gently closed the flowers
But the ones I laid upon her
Stayed open to mourn my loss

The night air never hurt so deep
As it whispered praises of despair
To keep in this lonely heart

These fingers cut the wet flesh
Bleeding red rivers through my face
On my weak kness I wept, but death stayed there
Until I lost her to gloom, beauty and despair

Please open your eyes
Please don't fade away
I won't let you leave me
I'll follow you through it all
Wherever it will lead me
I will follow

Deeper into the pain
Further away, for her
I step down to where tears remain
Over the frozen rivers
Through the land of the dead
Forever lost and bound in woe
Of my ropes of sorrow I wouldn't let go
They hanged me to this place I fell
Alone and blind I travel in my hell
Forever and forever and forever alone
