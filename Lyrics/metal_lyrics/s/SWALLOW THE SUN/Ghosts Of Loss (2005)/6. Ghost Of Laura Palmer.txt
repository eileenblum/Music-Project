The fountain runs quiet
Through the emerald steps and lavender air
The statues praise the beauty of hers
Flowers bloom around her marble breasts

Silver drops of the open night sky
Light this ruined garden
The vines hanging on pillars and walls
Gather the light over the water

Cold serenity lies within these secret halls
Embracing me in her essence
The air so calm and still, and her voice
Leading me deeper, deeper inside

Through the water and floating leaves
I'm following her soft call
Into the throne of her fertile loins

In the flame she was moving slow
Whispering passionate words
As she breathed frost
Out of her warm, wet mouth
She felt like the ghost of Laura Palmer
