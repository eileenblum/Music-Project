It came with the nightfall
The dark that swallowed the stars
One by one it painted them black
And brought horror to our hearts

It came down in the shape of rain
A wall of black waters
Spreading the end to the earth below
And I ran and left them all

Away from those dying voices
I escape the eye of the doom
The triumph of fear and ending lives
And I left them all and ran
Until I reached the shore

The waves greeted me with majestic mourn
To the sea I shed my last hope
And the ocean carried me away

The sound of ending world was fading
Until I only heard my heart in despair
Closed my eyes and fell into a sleep
Relieving dream of the distant sun

"Awake" whispered the sea
And my tearful eyes were open
The crystal night sky shone like water
The roof of eternity, ballet of million stars

But as I turned my eyes down to the horizon
The stars were fading one by one...
