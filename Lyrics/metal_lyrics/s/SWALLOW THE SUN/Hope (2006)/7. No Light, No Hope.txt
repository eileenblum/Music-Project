Fall deeper and deeper
Don't forget what you have done
Did I ever say?
Some things can't be undone
Fall into my darkest thoughts
No light, no hope
My dagger in your heart is the mark of my true love

Venomous lips and poisonous words
That's what you are made of my dear
Eyes wide shut, left to rot
No regrets

Fall into my darkest thoughts
No light, no hope
My dagger in your heart is the mark of my true love
