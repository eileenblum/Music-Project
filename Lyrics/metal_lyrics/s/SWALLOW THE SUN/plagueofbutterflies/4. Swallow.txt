If I stay to quiet, 
I can hear her walking by, 
Death cold air is moving, 
Like the touch of her hand

Respect dying, towards our eyes, 
Earth dies, flowers dead, 
Silent whispers slowly flow, 
The silence from beyond

You'll come with me my precious light, 
You stalk me through the shadows, 
Just swallow the dark

You'll come with me my precious light, 
You stalk me through the shadows,
Just swallow the dark

I've fought to take you back, 
Cause my day is still burning

My scream is flowing through hands, 
But your flesh igniting

I'm taking you down to the hole, 
Bring on the scum for the flames

You'll come with me my precious light, 
You stalk me through the shadows, 
Just swallow the dark

You'll come with me my precious light, 
You stalk me through the shadows, 
Just swallow the dark

If I stay to quiet, 
I can hear her walking by...
