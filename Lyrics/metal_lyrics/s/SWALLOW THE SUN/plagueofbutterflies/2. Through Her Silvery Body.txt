You'll awake life
Through perceptive light
In the face of your offense
Bearing scarlet bark
The second moon is
Dropping her silver tears
The gaze, the sway, you'll pay
Through the summer, lost in pain

Through her silvery body
Grazing scars
Her skin enchants me
Towards the doom of spring
So I find her
In milk white light
In this silver frosted night
I place you in coffin moonlight

I'm haunted by your touch
My soul passing you
You'll save my fear from this shame
I know I ought to take your flame

My touch will freeze your love
Enthroned on your skin
I offered to cross the water
My blood curls, taken from light

My heart bleeds for
Her restless sleep
I should fake a yawn
Before I go away
And when she lies silent
Her beauty lights the room
But now no other man
Will taste her loins of doom

I'm haunted by your touch
My soul passing you
You'll save my fear from this shame
I know I ought to take your flame

My thoughts will freeze your love
Enthroned on your skin
I offered to cross the water
My blood curls
