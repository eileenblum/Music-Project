My heart greeds for frozen stars
Deep black universe upon me
I'm enchanted by this warm light
Yet nothing can melt my cold soul
The lakes, my silent lovers
Whispers from the deep black waters
Ice would keep the ghost's silent
Their mournful song freezes my heart
Come down where the embers burn
Let the night embrace you
And just before the morning haze
You will disappear without a trace
Seasongs change but the sorrow stays
Symphony is getting louder day by day
When the fog raises the dead again
Disharmony of crushing bones
Will take away my pain
