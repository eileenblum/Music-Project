"Saint Peter, save me and send me down to hell
For I will find her there, where moonlight catches her scarlet hair
Where she sings, and black ravens circle above her in the burning air"

Silence your heart before it tears you apart
Keep your eyes on the distant thunder
Unfold your wings against the dark

"My heart thrown to the lions
My soul fed to the wolves
Arise, Arise, Arise!
Walk on your altar of sacrifice
And let the blood for her"

"My heart thrown to the lions
My soul fed to the wolves
My body left for the winter
My eyes for the night"

With you came the whole of world's tears
The space between the heartbeats
Is where I felt you
A small death each and every time

I stand straight at the form of my faith
To keep the last of my honour
But my legs won't carry me anymore
Paralysed before the eyes of a hunter
I open up my veins for the parasites to come

Silence your heart before it tears you apart
Keep your eyes on the distant thunder
Unfold your wings against the dark

"Saint Peter, save me and send me down to hell"
