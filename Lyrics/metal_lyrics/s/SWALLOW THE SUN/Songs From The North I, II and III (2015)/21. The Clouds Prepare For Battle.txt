The black winds lift my wings, on my command
I turn my eyes to the North, against the distant flaming sky
The pressure of the air, and the weight of the clouds on the horizon

I have no more fear in me, nor tears to resist
I rise above you and take your throne
...of fear

"I turned my wings towards the dark, and your armies
Threw my soul into the eye of the storm, to feel your force
But you were less than nothing as an enemy of mine
I arose through the shadows and the fires of hell"

"To look you straight in the eye, in this stillness before the storm
One more time, before I raise my hand
As these clouds prepare for battle
Under my command"

I rise through the clouds with wrath in my eyes
Through the temples of the skies, under the stars
Upon the night sky, above the living and the dead 
Through the black night of the souls, into the fiery throne

This darkness grew my wings too mighty to break, too strong to fall
I have no more fear in me, nor tears to resist
I rise above you and take your throne
Through the black night of the souls, into the fiery throne

"I turned my wings towards the dark, and your armies
Threw my soul into the eye of the storm, to feel your force
But you were less than nothing as an enemy of mine
I arose through the shadows and the fires of hell"

"To look you straight in the eye, in this stillness before the storm
One more time, before I raise my hand
As these clouds prepare for battle
Under my command"
