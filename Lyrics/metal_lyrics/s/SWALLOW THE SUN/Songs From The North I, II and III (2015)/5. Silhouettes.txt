I painted my heart black, just to cover the darker shades
Framed by tears so think from ashes, oil and blood

Winter solstice night, but in my soul the dark won't step aside
Increased with these long stretched hours, from seconds to years
Until years become centuries

Lonely silhouettes moving on the wall like wounded birds
With their crooked black claws, dancing around my throat
Wounded in the hands of winter, I froze to death for her
Outcast form her embrace, I bled to death for her

But I shall return, I will haunt her in her dreams

I rise like a morning star, strike down the holy ones
Who betrayed their hearts for the crown
That melted over their eyes

I shine like the North star, and blind their weak eyes
Fill them with my sorrow
And curse them in my arms

You threw me down the throat of hell
Tied my hands and burned me with your tongue
Drowned me in the nothingness
Into the abyss of your poison well

Lonely silhouettes moving on the wall like wounded birds
With their crooked black claws, dancing around my throat
Wounded in the hands of winter, I froze to death for her
But I shall return and sing you back to sleep...
