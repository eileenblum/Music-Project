It's getting late my old friend, it's time to go now
Say goodbye to all we had and set these torn sails away
You broke me down to pieces, like you always did
I'm ready to sleep now

This tomb of my heart turned happiness to dust
Days changed to lifetimes of promises and rust
All friends around me 
From happiness and dust
And I'm ready to go now where I won't be lost
Happiness to dust

Have you come to take me home?
Last rays of the evening sun
With the dream, to where I belong
To the meadows of unsung songs
I'm scarred for lifetimes in here
Worn down in these battles
I'm ready to sleep now

I dragged all these shadows behind me
Until they grew into a part of me, but I never wanted it to happen
All the steps I took, I took them for the happiness of others
But they all burned me down, burnt like an empty book

I unfolded my wings to their darkness
Stepped into all those rooms of shadows
Took those silver bullets to shield their hearts
But I'm too wounded now from these battles
Please let me fall into a sleep of beauty for a while

It's getting late my old friend, it's time to go now
Say goodbye to all we had and set these torn sails away

Worn down in these battles
I'm ready to sleep now
