Wind across the barren land
Lift my wings from the desert sand
My spirit is broken, but not my hands
To write these lines in the sand

Deceivers, unbelievers
Fall on your knees
And pray for the winds to come
Undying and defying North
WInter bless your child
I'm coming home

Sun burns my eyes in this strange land
Vast fields of sand from where I stand
My ships are gone, but the sea will carry me
Under your skies

Deceivers, unbelievers
Fall on your knees
And pray for the winds to come
Undying and defying North
WInter bless your child
I'm coming home

The starlit night sky, with unknown patterns above
Abandoned on these far away shores
Left alone with the memory
Of the trees, the snow and the lakes
Tonight I will catch the wind
And escape this land of burning sun

Deceivers, unbelievers
Fall on your knees
And pray for the winds to come
Undying and defying North
WInter bless your child
I'm coming home

Wind across the barrel land
Lift my wings from these desert sands

Deceivers, unbelievers
Fall on your knees
And pray for the winds to come
Undying and defying North
WInter bless your child
I'm coming home
