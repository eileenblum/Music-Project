Oh Mother North, eyes like blue sapphires
I'm lost in your wilderness, in your arms
From your love my heart has been forged
Eternal nights, to ever-light
To winter's throne

"Niin laulut Pohjolan kun sammuu, hiipuu hiljaa
Hallatar kun viljaa lyÃ¶, ja yÃ¶ tuo kuninkaan tuon talven maan
Niin routaan kaivtaan, lepoon omaan maan
Ja laulut Pohjolan mukaan vain saan"

Oh Mother North, lakes like blue sapphires
Under your skies, into the wild I drown my sorrows

At the midnight hour of sacred light
The magic of these woods, so alive

The shadows of the giants in a silvery dark light
From the snowy trees ahead
And their slow march closer to the flaming night skies
To touch the tail of fire

But their roots hold the secrets, these melodies
Echoes from the past, nothing here will last
But the songs from your journey
You will bury with your heart.
