We fall like leaves from the skies
Down with the sun
North winds are taming her down
Chased away for a lifetime

Into the twilight
Away with the light
We are the children
Who stare into the night

"We are the ones
The children of the setting sun
We are the ones
Who pray upon the fading light
We are the ones 
The children of the setting sun
Who pray upon the night"

Summer is fading like time
Runs through your fingers
And night will harvest us down
Before the words of goodbye

Into the twilight
Away with the light
We are the children
Who stare into the night

We fall like leaves down from the skies
Down with the sun
And storms will arrive and harvest us down
Down with the sun

We pray for the night
To give us one more sunrise
To shine from our eyes 
Before the summer dies
