Arise with the new dawn's hour
Breathe in the air so blue
Nightmares of yesterday's sorrows
Disappear into the light anew

Here today, gone tomorrow, it will be
Leave your ghosts behind
...for a while

Night came with warm tears
Now the drops of morning dew

"Arise with the new dawn's hour
And let your eyes reflect the dark..."

...away with the first light of the day
Let it wash your tears away today
And all that will remain

'Nothing here will stay the same"

Not even this pain

Here today, gone tomorrow
It will pass with time, and leave its mark on you
Embrace this early hour

Silent trees and still horizon
You will find it here
When the wind lifts you broken wings

"Arise with the new dawn's hour
And let your eyes reflect the dark..."

...away with the first light of the day
Let it wash your tears away today
And all that will remain

"Nothing here will stay the same"
