Speak through the silence,
Lay down your crown,
Lay down your fight.

And when you speak
The words of silence,
Walls will crumble in
And skies open.

And when you speak,
You speak with silence,
And I carve each word you
Sing on my stone wings...

And the light will pour in!

The fires are burning
Under the starlight,
Through veils of golden light,
The sails so pure, so white.

Through the river of death
I carry you, my love.
Breathe in the night,
My arms alight.

And when you speak
The words of silence,
Walls will crumble in
And skies open.

And when you speak,
You speak with silence,
And I carve each word you
Sing on my stone wings...

And the light will pour in now!

I threw this iron crown
Into the eye of inferno
This lake of fire,
This pit of ghosts

Breathing in the dark,
Exhaling the dust of stars.

In this shrine of silver light,
On the edge of the moon,
You sing to me.

The river flows deep through
My heart and through my eyes
As you turn into the light,
The dust of silver stars.

And when you speak
The words of silence,
Walls will crumble in
And skies open.

And when you speak,
You speak with silence,
And I carve each word you
Sing on my stone wings...

And the light will pour in!
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings now.
