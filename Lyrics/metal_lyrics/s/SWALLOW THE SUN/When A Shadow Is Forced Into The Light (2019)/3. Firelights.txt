I'm drowning in this black
Stream of sunken dreams,
Under the water I'm breathing in.

I'm breathing
The phantoms,
The nightmares.

And the firelights
Upon the waters burning,
On the isle of time where golden
Torches burning bright.

Touch to realize now
All tides of dark are turning.
Trust in the night now,
Inside the fires burning bright.

I'm floating upon this black
Stream of broken dreams,
Upon the water I'm bleeding.

I'm bleeding
The phantoms,
The nightmares.

And the firelights
Upon the waters burning,
On the isle of time where golden
Torches burning bright.

Touch to realize now
All tides of dark are turning.
Trust in the night now,
Inside the fires burning bright.

Pull me under,
Under these black waves.
Fill my lungs with your fire.

Their poison ropes cut into my hands!

Drown me down to your abyss,
Blind my eyes with your blades.
I drag you with me into these flames
And all that remains are ashes
Of phantoms, of fears.

And the firelights
Upon the waters burning,
On the isle of time where golden
Torches burning bright.

Touch to realize now
All tides of dark are turning.
Trust in the night now,
Inside the fires burning bright.
