You're the island
In the sea of time,
I'm the ghost ship
In the night.

In the eye of the storm
You're the lighthouse,
I am at the edge of the world
Beyond the walls.

Death tore out the flesh from my bones,
Left my soul so pale and hollow.
My hands reach into the void
Where you used to be!

Built my armour from the bones of them angels,
Breathing out the arrows of God.
My hands reach into the void
Where you used to be.

You're the island
On the broken sky
I will keep my sacred vows

Under moonlit skies
Here on the black earth
In the fragments of an empty heart
Where you used to be

Death tore out the flesh from my bones
Left my soul so pale and hollow
My hands reach into the void
Where you used to be
Built my armour from the bones of them angels
Breathing out the wrath of God
My hands reach into the void
Where you used to be

Riding on the edge of the world
Now free like the racing clouds
Circling around the halo of the moon
Like the birds of the night when touched by the sun

You're the island
In the sea of sky
I'm the ghost ship in the night

In the eye of the storm
You're my lighthouse
I'm at the edge
Of the world
