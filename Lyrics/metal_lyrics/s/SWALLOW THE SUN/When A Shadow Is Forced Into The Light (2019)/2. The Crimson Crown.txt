The crimson crown
Fell from the blood red sky
Through the golden clouds.

Out from the crown
Grew mountains and the skies,
Out from the diamond drops
The sea and stars.

Upon the circle
Shines the all-seeing eye
Between the Earth and
The crimson crown.

Shines through the golden clouds!

The forest sleeps so quiet
Like flowers in your arms
As the white swans of the night
Fly by the bridge of stars.

And I bow before the moon
And I pray to the skies,
When mist falls on your garden
Bless your temple of the star.

And the night falls like silence,
And the night like velvet silence.

In this temple of the golden nightingale
These flowers still weep so silent,
Dance around the gentle moonlight
With the touch of the summer wind.

And the lakes glimmer silver
Like the tears from your eyes,
But there are no goodbyes
Just light between the stars.

Sing for the night,
Sing for the morning rise
Like birds of the night upon
The light of the Evenstar.

The Goddess of the Sky,
A lighthouse in the night.
These temples won't fall
Built on a crimson crown.

Out from the crown
Grew mountains and the skies,
Out from the diamond drops
The sea and stars.

Upon the circle
Shines the all-seeing eye
Between the Earth and
The crimson crown.

Shines through the golden clouds!
