Left my heart on the battlefield
Nothing left to fight for
Strip down all my beliefs
Nothing left to die for

It's too late
To dream again
Of tomorrow without the dark that will remain
Within me

Please light, don't let me win
When I walk into night without you
Please light, hide deep within
Where the shadows can't reach you
Please light, don't let me win
When I walk into night without you
Without you, into the eye

And it's too late
To turn back again
Walk beside, along the light
In the dead of night
Within me

Please light, don't let me win
When I walk into night without you
Please light, hide deep within
Where the shadows can't reach you
Please light, don't let me win
When I walk into night without you
Without you, into the eye

The bridge I built from these empty arms
No life or death will tear these hearts apart
Echoes over aeons of time
Upon the stars
Upon the stars

Please light, don't let me win
When I walk into night without you
Please light, hide deep within
Where the shadows can't reach you
Please light, don't let me win
When I walk into night without you
Without you, into the eye

Empty rooms
But you never left
Empty house
But you never left

Empty heart
But you never left
Empty arms
But you never left

Empty rooms
But you never left
Empty heart
But you never left
Never left
