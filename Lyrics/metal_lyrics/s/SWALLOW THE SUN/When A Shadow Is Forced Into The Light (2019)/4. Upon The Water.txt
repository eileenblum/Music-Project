Upon the water the song of
The birds still echoes silent,
Low tide is gone forever.

Forever!

Cast all the demons in the sea,
Into the abyss of the Earth.
To the sleep of the wild sun
I want you to bury me, bury me!

Upon the water the song of
The birds still echoes silent,
Low tide is gone forever.

Forever...

Below the starlight
Pyres are burning above the water,
White ships are gone forever.

Forever!

Cast all the demons in the sea,
Into the abyss of the Earth.
To the sleep of the wild sun
I want you to bury me, bury me!

Upon the water the song of
The birds still echoes silent,
Low tide is gone forever.

Forever...

The April skies
Singing songs of goodbye.
Farewell tonight,
Leaving with the tide.

And the fire burns
At the edge of the dawn,
And the nightingale
Shines upon the water.

Cast all the demons in the sea,
Into the abyss of the Earth.
To the sleep of the wild sun
I want you to bury me, bury me!

Upon the water the song of
The birds still echoes silent,
Low tide is gone forever.

Forever...
