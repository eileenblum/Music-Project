Inside the night
there's a firelight
between the worlds,
at the edge of dark.

Inside the fire
there's a blinding light,
the flame that burns
between the worlds.

At the edge of the dark!

When a shadow
is forced into the light
it rips through your chest
and burns like a fire.

When a shadow
is forced into the light,
and the blood of the serpents
will burst under brightest stars.

And the wings will carry
these shadow and the light,
and the scars like diamonds will
cut through the veil of night.

The clouds apart
and new stars alight
between the worlds,
in the sea of the sky.

The sun and moon shines
from your eyes, lead me home
through the map of skies
from the edge of the night.

When a shadow
is forced into the light
it rips through your chest
and burns like a fire.

When a shadow
is forced into the light,
and the blood of the serpents
will burst under brightest stars.

And the wings will carry
these shadow and the light,
and the scars like diamonds will
cut through the veil of night.

At the edge of the dark,
at the heart of the dark,
at the edge of the dark.

Where I stare the night
straight in the eye and the
demons of deep will arrive.

From the wounds they bleed out
their black blood like oil
and I spark the flame of the night.

And I will melt these chains
and forge them as a crown,
drag those shadows to the light

From the heart of the dark,
at the edge of the dark.
From the edge!

When a shadow
is forced into the light
it rips through your chest
and burns like a fire.

When a shadow
is forced into the light,
and the blood of the serpents
will burst under brightest stars.
