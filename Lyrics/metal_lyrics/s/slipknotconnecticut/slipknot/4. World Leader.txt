Man plagued by fear, the voice he hears tell him to crucify, by the lies he has told
Never asking why locked in a spell, spawned of hell he is playing the Devil's game
The wars decreed fulfilling the need of he who cannot be named
World leader Dead leader

Things have changed in the world today no one gives a fuck about what the people say
Ring leaders in the circus of nations toying with people's ties and relations
Do not leave a question of doubt in your mind do not look now we are running out of time
Going to do it now kick down the door let them know we do not need their attention no more

The head of stater makes prices inflate then you ask yourself why was he elected
Monuments erected, then impeachment you cry he will starts a war no one asked for
Then he will sit back and watch and laugh then he will retire
When it is down to the wire and count all the money he has.
