How it thinks and what it sees will never be known to you and me
How he lives and how he survives how he lives to torment in our lives
For any sane guy would think you too abhor this beast

Steaming drunk and proud of hate preparing the world to meet their fate
Got his guns and his god exterminates an angry mob
Wars fought never won nothing ever could be done
Another victim of police war going to try we will even the score
Hate in blue hating you hate in Blue hating you
