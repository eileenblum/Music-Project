Some inner fury has got a hold on me ties me up would not let me free
Pain it makes me hate I wonder now it is too late thoughts of death psychotic dreams
Alter his thoughts to swim in the mainstream
Do not let him think he will be okay give him a pill, he will be okay

Living life by the will of others; damned to hell
Put some flowers in the padded cell perish in a cell
Keep him away from his life's contentment: damned
To therapy to reduce the resentment-psycho cell hell

Crucify me with your lies what we say what we do; you despise
Ignorance: the showing of is in your eyes open up, understand realize
Out of control, with a pathetic vengeance mind decay with a life sentence
Dehumanized by doctors lies pain is there, it is in his eyes
Alter his thoughts to swim in the mainstream
Do not let him think he will be okay give him medicine, he will be okay
