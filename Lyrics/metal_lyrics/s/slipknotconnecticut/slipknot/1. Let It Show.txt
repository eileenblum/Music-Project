You are denying the truth, it is what we know
Hide behind lies, do not let it show
Face the reality you cannot even see
Is it them you hate or is it just me?
If you are with me, let me know
If you are against me let it show

Next time you look open your eyes
Imagine the pain, wrapped up inside
Face the question I am going to repeat
If you are with me, let me know
If you are against me let it show

Nights I could not sleep thinking about secrets that you would keep
And all the little things that went slack in front of my faith and behind my back
Now I am deaf to these words that you said I never heard but it is the thousandth time you said it
Next time you do you are going to regret it let me know, let it show
