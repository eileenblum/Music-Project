These day are long and
The years fly by
Dazed and forgotten
I held on to your heart
This was never my vision
Things were supposed to be different

Searching for hope
Searching for light
Went against my instincts out of spite

Searching for hope
Searching for light
All the money in the world wouldn't make it right

Oh! The thoughts of me failing,
Plague my dreams
All this regret grows constant
With no end it seems
So I keep falling from grace
One foot in the grave
This was never my vision
Things were supposed to be different

Searching for hope
Searching for light
Went against my instincts out of spite

Searching for hope
Searching for light
All the money in the world wouldn't make it right

You wait for something different
It never seems to come

You wait for something different
The battles never won

Searching
Searching for hope
