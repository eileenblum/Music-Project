I'm fighting from the fire again
The whole time I was spread beneath the ashes
I'd rather leave but if we had to go back
I'd take all of you

Maybe my foundation was
Poured to be cracked open.
I watched the light find its way in.
Maybe my life was meant to be tested.
Cause who you learn from, we follow.

I wanna step out of your shadow
But when I do there's no sunlight
Pressed against the wall
We can't stop breaking
These nights are never promised to us
(Who we are)

I can't wait to be born again
I belong here
I was meant to be condemned for your fears.
Sometimes you need to look down
To find faith again
I'd rather see you die than watch you choke.
I'd rather see you die than watch you grow.

I wanna step out of your shadow
But when I do there's no sunlight.
Pressed against the wall
We can't stop breaking
These nights are never promised to us
(Who we are)
