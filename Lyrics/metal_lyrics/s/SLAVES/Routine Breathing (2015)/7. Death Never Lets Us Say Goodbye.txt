[Verse 1]
Try to remain whole as we spiral out of control
The weight of the world takes its toll
Thereâs gotta be a reason Iâm still breathing
Iâm still here

[Chorus]
Screaming âTake me!â
I should just bite the bullet
Taking aim at everything we love
Take me!
Oh, the thirst for power leaves us so devoured
Surviving myself

[Verse 2]
Itâs hard to make sense of this mess
We canât high five death
We know better than that
Still we pushed to the edge
Iâm struggling with the fact
That Iâm still left
But people have died for less

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The writings on the wall
Why not me? Why not me?
The writings on the wall
Why not me? Why not me?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The writings on the wall
Why not me? Why not me?
The writings on the wall
Why not me? Why not me?
