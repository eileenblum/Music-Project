[Verse 1]
Chatter, no self-esteem
Preserving me, could not believe
The way that you have treating me
So convinced yourself of your own worth

[Pre-Chorus]
Dying inside, waiting for rebirth
You know I'm gone, so far gone

[Chorus 1]
You said, you said I'm haunting you
I can see it in your eyes
Our hearts were one
But after some time
Demolished by your fiction of love
You said I'm haunting you
You lie and lie again
Deceiving your lover
Your best friend
This will never be me again

[Verse 2]
Suppressed by the need to chance
And waiting
Maybe waiting's not working out
Maybe it's time to turn around
And finally walk, walk, walk on the ground
Cause you know who you are

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Dying inside waiting for rebirth
You know I'm gone, I'm so far gone
So far gone, so far gone

[Chorus 2]
You said you said I'm haunting you
I can see it in your eyes
Our hearts were one
But after some time
Demolished by your fiction of love
You said I'm haunting you
You lie and lie again
Deceiving your lover
Your best friend
This will never be us in the end

[Bridge]
Dying inside
Dying inside
Dying inside
Dying inside

Your cries hold strong through the night
I'm on my knees begging with all my might
(Dying inside, dying inside)
Your cries hold strong through the night
Tell me now I'm gonna win this fight
(Dying inside, dying)

[Chorus 1]
