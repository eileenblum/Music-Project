[feat. Kyle Lucas]Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh
Okay well I just keep expecting
It's all a phase
She said she needs some space okay well I just need a change
Somewhere I could go lick my wounds
Sew my heart right back together
Sew my heart right stitch in two
Double cross me, you cross my mind
Harpin(?) on this loss of mine
I say I'm fine but I often lie
I don't wanna kill time but the clock won't die
Uh, I'm just at a loss for words
Looking back I fell in love for who I thought you were

You shoulda killed her from the start
So keep crying
So keep crying
(You'll get what you deserve)
At the hands of your work
You get what you deserve
You get what you deserve

We were never built to last
Taking the high road is letting go
So much for better or worse [3x]
(I fell in love with who I thought you were)
You'll get what you deserve

You should have killed her from the start
So keep crying
So keep crying
At the hands of your work
You get what you deserve
You get what you deserve

You made a bet
So let it out
Don't be surprised
Whatever what he decide
You made your bet
Don't be surprised
When the words are said
You'll get what you deserve

You shoulda killed her from the start
So keep crying
So keep crying
At the hands of your work
You get what you deserve
You get what you deserve

Don't think I'm not gonna come after you, bitch
