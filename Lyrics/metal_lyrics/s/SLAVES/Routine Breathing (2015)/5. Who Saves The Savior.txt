[feat. Spencer Chamberlain of Sleepwave]Who saves the savior?
[8x]

And this is [?]
Just another lost cause, so far from Hell
So far from Hell
This wasn't forever planned
Wasted come from out of Hell
Well they look to the sky

So cold [?]

Who saves the savior?
Who saves the savior?
Who saves?

[?] around the fire
Splitting [?] the same mistakes
We never changed

So cold [?]

[?] but I'm still not the same, I'm not the same
I'm just a scheme you couldn't wash away
Couldn't wash away!

Who saves the savior?
Who saves?
Who saves the savior?
Who saves?

Where's the [?]?

We'll look to the sky (Look to the sky)
Our hearts should seal the ground
We'll be look to the sky (Look to the sky)
We'll be look to the sky (Look to the sky)
Our hearts should seal the ground
