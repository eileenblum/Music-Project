[Verse 1]
They say it's hot in the spotlight, too much for some
So enjoy the shade
Cause your sparks will fade
Oh me? I'm doing just fine
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
They said it was over, they said I grew colder, they said it was over

[Chorus 1]
Cause we are, we are the real ones
Will we refuse to run and hide?
Watch us pour our hearts into every note
While they fall to the side
(Cause we are)
Fight fire with fire
Only lessons learned
Rise above the ashes
From the bridges burned

[Verse 2]
Let's sing in a city of ruins
Walk on through the trail of dirt
Call it justice or call it
Call it justice or call it revenge
So love, have we suffered enough?
So now we'll kill what we love
Tore myself apart
Before, before anyone else could

[Chorus 2]
Cause we are, we are the real ones
Who will refuse to run and hide
Watch us pour our hearts into every note
While they fall to the side
Cause we are
Fight fire with fire
Only lessons learned
Rise above the ashes
From the bridges burned
Fighting fire with fire
Only lessons learned
Rise above the ashes
From the bridges burned

[Bridge]
Tore myself apart
Before anyone else could
Tore ourselves apart
To find out who we are

[Chorus 1]
