Behind closed doors we lit a fire
From behind the same door we're self defined
Locked away in the prison in our minds
Well this time I'm gonna try
Runaway, runaway this time I'm gonna try
Runaway

Tear me open and reach right in
You'll see the truth cause you'll end up hating
Everything will be fine in the end
And I'll believe it, I won't have to pretend

I feel like life has become a long map
That leads me to you night after night
I see the marks up and down your arms
It's like a road map to
Maybe I'm just as lost as you
Well find a way through

Maybe I made a cliche
Wanting to die this way
I'm not trying this is (.....?)
Am I here or just standing in line
Addiction isn't overcoming for a place seen in time
My heart is higher but in your arms
I feel alive
In your arms I feel alive
And now I'm addicted to you
I've never felt so alive
