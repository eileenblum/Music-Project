[Verse 1]
The farther I go, the further you get away from who we really are
I choose a different route, a different path in life
Praised by many, but still labeled an outcast

[Chorus]
The things that last never happen overnight
These calloused hands built the foundation of my life
Abandoned for love, left with no advice
How quickly we change overnight

[Verse 2]
Make me out to be the bad guy
How long can I wear the blame?
Sick of feeling wrong
Why do they judge me all the same?
Nobody's perfect, trying to justify myself to the ones who will never, never understand
Who will never

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Torture myself, that's what I feel I'm worth
Torture myself, well aware that the pain is somewhere else
Torture myself, that's what I feel I'm worth
Torture myself, well aware that the pain is somewhere else
(Somewhere else)
It's somewhere else
(Somewhere)
It's somewhere else
(Somewhere)
It's somewhere else
