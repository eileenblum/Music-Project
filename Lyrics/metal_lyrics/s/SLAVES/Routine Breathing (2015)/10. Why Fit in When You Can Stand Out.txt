Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark

The star of our own tragedy
Still we carry on oh so casually
(We are, we are)
Never broken, always being beating, left for dead
Until their bleeding heart's beating
We are

Whisper or shout
Why fit in when you can stand out?
All the things we go through just to be heard
We scream at the top of our lungs (Oh, oh)
We scream at the top of our lungs
Until the voice is heard

And there are times, when the darkness wins
Oh, and there are times, when I don't mind
Criticize, who are they?
Outshine the box
But life alone, but life alone, is taking the risk

Whisper or shout
Why fit in when you can stand out?
All the things we go through just to be heard
We scream at the top of our lungs (Oh, oh)
We scream at the top of our lungs
Until the voice is heard
Until the voice is heard

Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
Leading the march
We're not leaving till we leave our mark
