[feat. Tilian Pearson of Dance Gavin Dance][Verse 1]
They tell me hold on
But pain like this he suffers so long
And truth be told
If we ever did where would you be?
(Where would you be?)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's just the blame that you aim to
Even all the times I sang to just to keep you holding on

[Chorus 1]
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far

[Verse 2]
If you want, it could be my fault
I could be your masochistic scapegoat lover
I tore us apart, no way we can take it back
I lose my part for nothing
Lonely summers killing me because
There's still a fire when I think about you
I try to drown it, but I know it's no use
Nobody does it like the way we use to
Oh, whoa oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's just the blame that you aim to
Even all the times I sang to just to keep you holding on
And all these moments with you that make me feel like I'm
Brave
(Please stop)

[Chorus 1]
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far

[Bridge]
I got the message; you got the message
(Cold)
Now that we're all alone
(Cold)
I got the message; you got the message
(Cold)
You're never coming home

(Oh whoa, oh)

[Chorus 2]
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang

[Chorus 3]
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest by far
I wanna go back to the days in our car
Where we sang the loudest

[Outro 3x]
