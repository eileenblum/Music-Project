My mind, my mind (My mind)
Always drifts to you
Too tired to sleep, too exhausted to faint
My mind
Nightmares, oh (Nightmares, ohh woah oh)
So..
(So..)

It's the picture of you leaving, ohh woah oh
The thirst is so endless
So..
So..

Our time, our time
We get lost in this life (So..)
Our time, our time
We get lost..

Our time, our time (So..)
We get lost in this life
Our time, our time
We get lost
(We get lost)
(We get lost)
