[Verse 1]
What a crying shame
I can't escape these haunted hallways
The ghost of myself
And everything I love
And pushed away

[Pre-Chorus]
Come hell or come high water
I'm miserable as sin
And this position I find myself in
It's never dead
Oh, so they say

[Chorus]
Talk of the devil and he will appear
Burdens so heavy every day it becomes more clear
Drowning in my addiction
Drowning in my addiction

[Verse 2]
I try and stand strong, but I always give in
Wish I could escape myself
This evil intent, evil intent
To kill what I love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
This vicious cycle comes full circle
But I'm still here
And I never knew love
Cause happiness is fair
Cause happiness is fair
So they say

[Chorus]
