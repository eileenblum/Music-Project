(I've come too far to let this go)

Watching the bombs explode
Through a window looking down upon myself
And when the lights are low
I'm seeing red again
(I'm coming for you, ready or not)

This is my call to arms
But they'll never know
All the hate I'm feeling
I'm fighting back this time
(I'm gonna rise up)
I'm taking back what's mine
Ready or not

Feeling my art exposed
To the rhythm of the awful things I've done
When the lights are low
I remember they're not the only ones
So keep your chin up son
You're on your own now
You ignited the flame
It wouldn't stop burning
This fire inside
All the people you're hurting
(Ready or not)

This is my call to arms
But they'll never know
All the hate I'm feeling
I'm fighting back this time
(I'm gonna rise up)
I'm taking back what's mine
Ready or not

This ends today
I've come too far to let this go
I've come too far to let this go
And I'm not going to be afraid today
I've come too far to let this go
I've come too far to let this go
(I've come too far to let this go)
I'm coming for you ready or not

This is my call to arms
But they'll never know
All the hate I'm feeling
I'm fighting back this time
(I'm gonna rise up)
I'm taking back what's mine
Ready or not
