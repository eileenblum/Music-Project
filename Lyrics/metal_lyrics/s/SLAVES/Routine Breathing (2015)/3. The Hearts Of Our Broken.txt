[feat. Garret Rapp of The Color Morale]All this love in my bones
it's hard for me to speak
and your words mean less now when you talk to me
all I ever wanted was rushed
gave into my addictions when all I wanted was love
a few words spoken, but I'm still broken
(broken)
you left me bruised and broken
my heart is black and blue
I stand alone on this lonely road
you left me bruised and broken
my heart is black and blue
and every time and every time that I look in my mirror I give right into you
broken people
like you, like me
we are the ones who can't ever seem to carry whole
for all the way
with all our holy peace
we know we sleep but why do we stay

I search for a new light
it means our time
through ...
every time they try to box me in
I search for a new light
it means our time
through ...
when they box me in
