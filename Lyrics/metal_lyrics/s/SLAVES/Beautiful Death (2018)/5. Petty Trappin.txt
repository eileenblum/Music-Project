I've heard everything you're saying makes no difference to me
I am only getting better save your pity

You left the topic
You wish that I quit
Deep down you know that you'll never be me
You're wasting your time you're wasting your energy

You say I'm everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine
Everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine

I'll stare right here in my only doing what I need to do
Giving concern to who will come and go and need me most

Ain't nobody doing me like that
Don't go saying shit you can't take back
I don't know it's perfect I agree
I'm working on it trust me

You left the topic
You wish that I quit
Deep down you know that you'll never be me
You're wasting your time you're wasting your energy

You say I'm everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine
Everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine

You think you're clever
Saying words under your breath
Yeah
It gives me pleasure
Knowing you could never do just what I do
Only getting stronger now
Holding me, gone
No time for you to put me down
Your move, I'm done

You say I'm everything you despise
I'm everything you don't like
I'm everything you don't like

You say I'm everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine
Everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine

You say I'm everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine
Everything you despise
Everything you don't like
Open my eyes
To see yours fixated on mine
