I always felt uneasy when we were in the same place
Taken back by the feeling that this could all go away
She said baby I would never do what those girls do
Funny I'd only hear that when it benefited you

Did I get too close
Didn't mean to have your true colors exposed

Wait
Did you ever take a moment just to think
About anyone anyone other than yourself
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold
One day it's gonna hit you you're alone
I won't be there won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now

It's your eyes that told me you were in it
All the flags that were red I told myself they were tinted
Then I noticed that you couldn't stand the sight of your own shadow
Like the devil on your shoulder couldn't stand to wait much longer

Did I get too close
Didn't mean to have your true colors exposed
Imperfections start to show
That's when I wanted you more

Wait
Did you ever take a moment just to think
About anyone anyone other than yourself
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold
One day it's gonna hit you you're alone
I won't be there won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now
Give me back the love I wasted now
Now
Now

Wait
Did you ever take a moment just to think
About anyone anyone other than yourself
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold
One day it's gonna hit you you're alone
I won't be there won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now
Now
Now
