I know I see this all the time
I see the trouble in your eyes
Trouble that money can't fix
And you still dig your ditch

I usually fall for that same old cycle
You see it in white and black and I'm in the middle

Well I don't want the same
Maybe I should explain
I've been through this before
Get it all off your chest
No need to pretend
That you won't come undone come undone

You used to tell me every day
You know exactly how I get
That's right I know how you get
That's why I'm walking away
I've learned from this broken down rebuild from it
You can say you're different but it's clear you're still the same

I usually fall for that same old cycle
You see it in white and black and I'm in the middle

Well I don't want the same
Maybe I should explain
I've been through this before
Get it all off your chest
No need to pretend
That you won't come undone come undone

I've learned from this broken down rebuild from it
You can say you're different but it's clear you're still the same

Sleep in the bed that you made
I know that someone with save ya
They're gonna see all your lies
Ain't no crying to tonight
It's gonna catch up right
Where I know it's gonna hurt you more

Well I don't want the same
Maybe I should explain
I've been through this before
Get it all off your chest
No need to pretend
That you won't come undone coming undone

Watch you coming undone
Watch you coming undone
Watch you coming undone
Coming undone
Coming undone
