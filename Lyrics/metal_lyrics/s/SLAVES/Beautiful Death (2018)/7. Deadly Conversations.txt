I check my messages way too much
Knowing that you won't reply
As soon as I give up
Is when you try to stir shit up

I don't wanna see you with someone else
I'm not waiting on the shelf
It's now or never and nothing else
What's the point of reaching out

I don't need I don't need another fail if you are not mine
I don't need you don't need you if you're not here by my side

Do you think I wanna hear about your newest little thing
Well fuck that and fuck the fact it's not me so I guess that means you win

I don't wanna see you with someone else
I'm not waiting on the shelf
It's now or never and nothing else
What's the point of reaching out

I don't need I don't need another fail if you are not mine
I don't need you don't need you if you're not here by my side
I don't need I don't need another fail if you are not mine
I don't need you don't need you if you're not here by my side

Endless conversations with you in my head
Going through the scenarios where we try this once again
There's no middle ground we're on separate sides
Until then don't bother don't call alright
You put these speed bumps into my life it only takes a night

I don't need I don't need another fail if you are not mine
I don't need you don't need you if you're not here by my side
I don't need I don't need another fail if you are not mine
I don't need you don't need you if you're not here by my side
