Never done it the way I should
So impatient misunderstood
I've always let a girl dictate my feelings yeah,
Too distracted too direct too numb so I neglect
The things I should protect I'm ready for what is next
I've made mistakes you've made a judgement
Focused on a life of substance
I'm tired of waiting I know I need to face it
I'm building I'm zoned in I'll never be complacent

I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been

They say hurry up and wait haha hurry up and wait
Eyes on the gold and every time I see the gold I froze
Best cards in the fucking deck but I fold
It's like I'm stuck in a place that I can't call home
And I ain't circling the block no more
Why do I do this to myself over and over again

I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been

I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been

And I could almost touch the sky
Keep my head down it's my time
No feeling done asking why
Keep my head down it's my time
I'm ready for what is next

(Like I've never been)
(Like I've never been)

I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been

I'm on the way up
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been
Nothing can hold me
I need to be patient
Patient like I've never been

(Like I've never been)
(Like I've never been)
(Like I've never been)
(Like I've never been)
