There's no hope in a city where the vices all turn wild. She can't find her love, oh, that girl she turns to designer drugs. Both the walls are closing in now, what kind of home is this? What kind of home have we made? Where are you now? (Where are you now?)

So put the crown around my head, so put the noose around my neck. Oh, they praise us to watch us die, forever young in your eyes. [2x]

Look at the mess we have, oh, the blood is on your hands, coming clean is easier said. I'll be damned like you, oh, I'll be damned to the end like you. Maintain your sanity as you hide being your new family, your new family.

So put the crown around my head, so put the noose around my neck. Oh, they praise us to watch us die, forever young in your eyes. [2x]

No, I can't shake the feeling as we watch them all die. No, I can't shake the feeling as we watch them die.

Move back and forth as the hole gets bigger. [2x]
Everything catches up, what an example the both of you set for us. Everything catches up, what an example the both of you set.

So put the crown around my head, so put the noose around my neck. Oh, they praise us to watch us die, forever young in your eyes. [2x]
