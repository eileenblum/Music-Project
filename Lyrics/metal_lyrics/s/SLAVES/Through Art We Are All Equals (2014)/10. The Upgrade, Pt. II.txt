The devil wears a white dress
Oh, she cries for something better
Her tears never hit the floor
All she wants is something deeper

Left stranded, still standing
From the joy it brings

Just another drama queen for the masses
Fading in the limelight
Just another drama queen for the masses
Girl you do it alright

Give up the ghost
Time to put it all to rest
Dig your own grave
Oh, you're dying to impress

I poured my soul into it all
And that's more than I can say for yourself
A man who desires revenge
Should dig two fucking graves

Just another drama queen for the masses
Fading in the limelight
Just another drama queen for the masses
Girl you do it alright

Give up the ghost
Time to put it all to rest
Dig your own grave
Oh, you're dying to impress

I want you all to myself
And I barely made it out alive
I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing
I've got nothing to lose
Let's give the devil his dues
Let's give that motherfucker his dues

Just another drama queen for the masses
Fading in the limelight
Just another drama queen for the masses
Girl you do it alright

Give up the ghost
Time to put it all to rest
Dig your own grave
Oh, you're dying to impress
