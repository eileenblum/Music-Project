Intro - [4x]
Stuck between the voice
Stuck between the voice
And the echo

It's time to let my mind go
And I'm willing to fade away with you
If this is how I'm saved
Then let it be

[2x]
God stopped listening
Cause the wolf kept crying

Take the air from my lungs
Put it in her's because
She's the one who deserves to live
The one that I pray that god forgives

pray that god forgives [3x]
pray that god
She's the one who deserves to live
he forgives

Can't stop who I've become
My love will never be sung
It's the pain before pleasure
Now speak for the glory of one

Open your eyes [2x]
You deserve better
Now give it your all

Take the air from my lungs
Put it in her's because
She's the one who deserves to live
The one that I pray that god forgives

pray that god forgives [3x]
pray that god
She's the one who deserves to live
he forgives

Why can't my words keep us afloat?
Why can't my words keep us afloat?
If we drown let me make it for you
If we drown let me make it for you

I never knew love until you
I never felt love until you
So why'd I throw it all away?
Why it coming unglued? [2x]

Change me for all the times
You hated me crimes [2x]
Watch the world burn in her eyes
If we destined to be damned [2x]
Stuck between the voice
And the echo
