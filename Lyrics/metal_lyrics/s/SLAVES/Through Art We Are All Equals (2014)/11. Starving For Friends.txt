[feat. Vic Fuentes]I miss the days of being on fire, damn
Riding around with the ones that keep me inspired

I miss the days of feeling on fire
Riding around with the ones that kept me inspired

But I could've been wrong, I could've been right
And none of you seem like friends tonight
See I was just waiting for the moment to take me away
It's just one of those days, oh yeah

Can we let it go?
Will we ever let it go?
I feel the only way to let it go is to say I'm sorry

Don't make me wait for a falling star
I've been afraid that the blood in my heart
Won't sing for me a melody that's ours
Drown me in the rain, I'd sink and swim for you

You were the only saving grace I ever had

You poison me
I'm burning colors, I can see the change
I can tell the bitter taste
I'm two-faced and I can't see straight
But don't pretend to run away
I know you hear me

Just another kid that can't let it go
Just another story for the books
How did I fall off track?
How did I let you turn your back on me?
Back on me

Don't make me wait for a falling star
I've been afraid that the blood in my heart
Won't sing for me a melody that's ours
Drown me in the rain, I'd sink and swim for you

You were the only saving grace I ever had

If I'm home by sunrise, will my eyelids fade?
I'm too tired now to save my problems for another day
'Cause I've spent my whole life between fear and faith
I don't know if I've been screaming in the dark or dreaming

It's plain and simple
I don't know what I was thinking
I miss my friends
The ones I'd die for

Don't make me wait for a falling star
I've been afraid that the blood in my heart
Won't sing for me a melody that's ours
Drown me in the rain, and I'll be there for you

You were the only saving grace I ever had
