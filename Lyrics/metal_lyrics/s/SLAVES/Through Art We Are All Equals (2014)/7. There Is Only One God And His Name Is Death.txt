The farther I go, the further you get away from who we really are
I choose a different route, a different path in life
Praised by many, but still labeled an outcast

The things that last never happen overnight
These calloused hands built the foundation of my life
Abandoned for love, left with no advice
How quickly we change overnight

Make me out to be the bad guy
How long can I wear the blame?
Sick of feeling wrong
Why do they judge me all the same?
Nobody's perfect, trying to justify myself to the ones who will never, never understand
Who will never

The things that last never happen overnight
These calloused hands built the foundation of my life
Abandoned for love, left with no advice
How quickly we change overnight

Torture myself, that's what I feel I'm worth
Torture myself, well aware that the pain is somewhere else
You can root for the villain, I'll take that title, I'll take the heat now and be your rival [2x]

The things that last never happen overnight
These calloused hands built the foundation of my life
Abandoned for love, left with no advice
How quickly we change overnight
