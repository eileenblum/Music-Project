They love you when the lines get blurred, our hearts become the source
as we push through all of these feelings, failure always disappoints.

Oh it's nights like these where it's all in my dreams. How long
should I take my mistakes? These apologies fall on deaf ears
How in the hell did I get here? I'll claim the role I was born to play.

How many times should I repent? How many apologizes are needed? I was
obviously defeated. Broken and beaten they had me focused on leaving,
I wore my heart on my sleeve, the whole world saw me bleedin', uh. I seen it all,
I've been there and I've done that. Counted me out, but never counted on my comeback.
Now I see the snakes and all the rats up in the mouse traps, this gonna be the
soundtrack for anyone who bounced back. I want that throne, go and get that crown, pest.

[?]....[?] for everything is gone, I saw them for who they truly are.
Still I rise, still I stand, so put the crown in my hand.
