[feat. Natalie Craig]How could you leave and watch us
Face this life alone
Both our hearts were yours to mold
So open and free
But everything we've lost
How did the words make it worth it

How did the words make it worth it [3x]

I know what it's like to hurt when we're alone
I want to tell the one that follows in my footsteps
They aren't the way, so turn back
Set the course to watch them fall
But these cuts are deeper after all
Twenty-seven years, my heart still hurts, it still hurts

How could you leave her, she was perfect.
Now all your dreams, they reek of failure
Still the older we get, the more broken we become
Can someone show me how to love (show me how to love) [2x]
Watching mistakes, I feel I'll never know love

How could I be like you
I'm not over everything I made
Yet it day to day
Just to let them fall

Just to be something in your eyes [2x]

How could you leave her, she was perfect.
Now all your dreams, they reek of failure
Still the older we get, the more broken we become
Can someone show me how to love (show me how to love) [2x]
Watching mistakes, I feel I'll never know love

How could you leave the watch us
Face this life alone
Both our hearts were yours to mold
So open it free
But everything we've lost
How did the words make it worth it

How could you leave her, she was perfect.
Now all your dreams, they reek of failure
Still the older we get, the more broken we become
Can someone show me how to love (show me how to love) [2x]
Watching mistakes, I feel I'll never know love

Can someone show me how to love (show me how to love) (continuous)
I'll never know love
