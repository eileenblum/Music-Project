Can't let it be all I've done
Can't let it be all in vain
Gave up the war to watch it fade
Can't let it be all I've done
Won't let it be all in vain
Gave up the war to watch it fade

How do you erase the memories that give us hope?
Now bitter and gold, all the lies that we hold
Step out of the shadows, step out of the shadows
To a life worth living again, to a life worth living

No words can ever replace where I've been
Can't stand the thought of you going through it alone
Those who stand for nothing, fall for everything [2x]

How do you erase the memories that give us hope?
Now bitter and gold, all the lies that we hold
Step out of the shadows, step out of the shadows
To a life worth living again, to a life worth living

Can't let it be all I've done
Can't let it be all in vain
Gave up the war to watch it fade
Can't let it be all I've done
Won't let it be all in vain
Gave up the war to watch it fade
Can't let it be all I've done
Won't let it be all in vain
Gave... she looking down on me
