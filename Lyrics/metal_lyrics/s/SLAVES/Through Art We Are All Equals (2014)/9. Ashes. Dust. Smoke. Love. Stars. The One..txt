I watched her eyes burn bright, but I could see the despise. We sank beneath her with every track. She screams 'til she's blue in the face, there's no room for her under the stars we feud for.

We're still not getting past it, hoping these issues dissolve, but they take another form, these problems just evolve. [2x]

The frown behind her smile, the pieces we can't force to fit. I can't fake another love when the outcome is so quick. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Watch the smoke fill our lungs, watch the smoke.

We're still not getting past it, hoping these issues dissolve, but they take another form, these problems just evolve. [2x]

I watched her eyes burn bright, but I could see the despise. We sank beneath her with every track. She screams 'til she's blue in the face, there's no room for her under the stars we feud for.

Watch her turn to dust. Watch her turn to dust. You're covered in the blood after you stabbed my fucking heart out.

We're still not getting past it, hoping these issues dissolve, but they take another form, these problems just evolve. [2x]
