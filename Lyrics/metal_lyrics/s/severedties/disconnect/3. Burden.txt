This is my last apology
This time I'm accepting me for me

Beaten and broken down by the ones we love the most
Passed by like a fucking ghost

I am a slave to the doubt in my own head
I'm a burden to everyone I've met
I am a slave to the doubt in my own head
I'm a burden 'til I'm dead

Am I good as dead
Or dead as God
Enslaved to my own mind
By a past that keeps me confined
Am I good as dead
Or dead as God
I know I'm a burden at best
In the world's eyes a fucking mess

When I'm awake
I'm not myself
Trapped inside
I don't want my mind

Looking to the sky
I replay my life
Trapped from inside
I don't want my mind

I am a slave to the doubt in my own head
I'm a burden to everyone I've met
I am a slave to the doubt in my own head
I'm a burden 'til I'm dead

Am I good as dead
Or dead as God
Enslaved to my own mind
By a past that keeps me confined
Am I good as dead
Or dead as God
I know I'm a burden at best
In the world's eyes a fucking mess

When I'm awake
I'm not myself
Trapped inside
I don't want my mind
When I'm awake
I'm not myself
In my head
Is where my body lays dead

Dead as God
Dead as God
Dead as God
