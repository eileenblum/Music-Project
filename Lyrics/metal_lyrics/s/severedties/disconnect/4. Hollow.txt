Empty in my head
I see your world's end
You'll be brain dead
Empty in my head
Such a waste
Goodbye friend

You can forget everything I said
You left me hollow, I'll leave you broken instead
I gave you every chance
But I was left for dead in the end

In the end

As I lay awake I'm screaming inside
The sounds echo in my mind
Everything you did to me
After everything I did for you

I never asked to be your enemy
But you tore into me
Stood by me only at my best

Some things will never change
And you can't force what's not there
Some things will never change
No matter how much you care
And I know that it's not fair
But we can't go through life scared
Well in the end you'll see
All the damage and pain you caused me

How could you walk away
When you swore you'd stand by me
Well I'll give you a taste
Of what it feels to be two faced

I'm left hollow on the inside
Empty and nothing more
I'm left hollow on the inside
But you're rotten to the core

Some things will never change
And you can't force what's not there
Some things will never change
No matter how much you care
And I know that it's not fair
But we can't go through life scared
Well in the end you'll see
You should have never gave up on me

Hollow inside
Hollow inside left with a broken fucking mind
