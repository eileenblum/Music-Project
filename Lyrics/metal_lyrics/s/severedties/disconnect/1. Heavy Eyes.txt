I've sunk so low
But it's the only place I know
Hell is in my head
My mind is painted red
I'm sick of feeling alone
Every night wearing my teeth to the bone
So I'll keep repeating that line
Everything gets better with time

I'm a nervous wreck
Full of past regret
And I'm scared to death
Because I don't have much time left

Every time I close my eyes
I feel the low from the high
And even though I swear I do
I don't want to die

I know I'm low, why do I feel so at home

So at home

I know I'm low, why do I feel so at home

Every time i close my eyes
I feel the low from the high
And even though I swear I do
I don't want to die
I wish I could go back and press rewind
But I know that I can't change time
Even though I wasted all the best years of mine

I need a sign
My hearts breaking and I'm losing my mind

I need a sign

Losing my mind
