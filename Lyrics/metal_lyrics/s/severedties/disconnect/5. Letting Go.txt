I'm sick of being sorry
Living a life never there for me
I hope you don't forget me
Because letting go is never easy

I've made mistakes
I've paid my debts
Time to get out of this
Escape this hell
Lost in transit
Found my exit
Lost and alone
But still somehow at home

Made mistakes
I've paid my debt
Time to get out of this
Escape this hell

Far from perfection
Not worth your attention
It's time to let myself grow
This time I'm letting go

Lost in transit
Found my exit
Lost and alone
But still somehow at home

Never enough
I'm not the one
Never enough
Seem to fuck up everything I touch (everything I touch)
Give all I have and receive none

I've made mistakes
I've paid my debts
Time to get out of this
Escape this hell
Lost in transit
Found my exit
Lost and alone
But still somehow at home

Never enough
For anyone
Never enough
I'm fucking done

I'll get through this the same way I've always known
Lost and alone but still somehow at home
I won't regret the time I've spent
In the end my heart is turning black
I don't want you back

This time I'm not moving on
There's a difference with letting go
I can't promise I'll be alright
I'm trying my best just to get by
