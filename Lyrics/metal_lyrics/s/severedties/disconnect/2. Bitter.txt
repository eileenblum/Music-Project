I can't get your voice out of my head
The last words before you left

No you never gave a fuck about me
Now I can't let you go, I'll never know
I can't get your voice out of my head
The last words before you left

Am I supposed to say I don't regret a thing
Like I've lost the feeling of pain
Am I supposed to say I don't regret a thing
Guess I never knew the right words to say

So get fucked

Throw it all in my face
Everything that I can't fucking take

So throw it all in my face
Everything that I can't fucking take
You'll turn away
As I'm engulfed by the flames

Deep down these are the thoughts that are killing me
Deep down these are the thoughts that are killing me

Am I supposed to say I don't regret a thing
Like I've lost the feeling of pain
Am I supposed to say I don't regret a thing
Guess I never knew the right words to say

So let's get one thing straight
I'm sick of playing your games
I don't care if you scream my name

So let's get one thing straight
I don't give a fuck if you're screaming my name

Am I supposed to say I don't regret a thing
Like I've lost the feeling of pain (Don't forget about me)
Do you remember what you said to me (Do you remember what you said to me)
Nothing in life could ever end happily (Don't forget about me)

I can't get your voice out of my head
The last words before you left
