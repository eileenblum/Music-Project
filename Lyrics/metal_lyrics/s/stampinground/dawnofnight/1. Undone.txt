The animal kingdom we would see it undone
The theft of millions of lives humanities conscience demise
I am on fire with indignation when I contemplate the humiliation
The endless pain and exploitation the degradation of a whole nation

It is impossible to hide such genocide even more difficult to justify
You do not even try to sift through the lies the media feeds us to sanctify
Gnawing at the bones of the slain cannibals rejoicing in hurricanes
Of blood, guts and pilfered life our deity the glistening knives
