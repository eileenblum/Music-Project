I have found the kind of strength about which you can only dream
An upright pillar of indignation that will never lean
At risk of sounding self-righteous you only need look at me
To see a mind that is focused on living life peacefully

The fire that burns in my veins self perpetuating from within
Will know no restraints in its desire to win
The battle that's been fought is to be my own man
Going against the dogma taught wherever I can

Dragged kicking from the womb gagged and bound at birth
Dispatched blind to our doom never realizing life's true worth
In the cores of our being there is an anger and a pride
Which only needs freeing and will not be denied

We are leached of our very life force and cast before fierce winds
Like the living dead we wander and wonder why we begin
A life so insane and pointless that for many is just a dream
But your dull direction-less existence will never be enough for me
