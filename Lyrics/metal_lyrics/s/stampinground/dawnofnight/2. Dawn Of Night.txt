Prejudice the shadows stalking society
Suspicion and fear perpetuating misled anxiety
Rise of the right a weeping sore of infectious hate
The dawning of night malignancy insatiate

A sucking pit of negativity
A quagmire of ignorant lies
Dragging us down inexorably
The corrupt laughing as innocents die

Nurturing the seed of darkness in the mind
Lighting a blaze to attract the blind
Like lemmings they plunge into its flame
So ever willing to delegate blame
