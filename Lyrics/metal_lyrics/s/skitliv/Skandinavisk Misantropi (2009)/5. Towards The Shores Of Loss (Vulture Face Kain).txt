The arrow
Told me
I am under stars
As sweet as being
But the stars' faces
The implant is
The Merciful Dust
The slick face of the unborn
Exhausted head
In the peace of the trip
The spurs stutter "chaos"
Or "love"
But only the lonely
The axe
At which click you
At fucked faun play
Makes faces
Of stairs and stars
But the train is dead
Your faith
"I wonder who makes the sea?"
"I wonder Ur?"
The neck smells nude
And the pain and love
After the woman blossoms
At streams
I see moths fail in polite twilights
The broken banks
The horses fall
The beautiful pool
Buy grace in installments
Give fox fox fox
Frost broken face
Vulture face Kain

Craving the unlimited nothingness
The seeps through the eyeballs of life
Sanctified by the hand of the Lord
The one that kept his secrets and
Balanced the unforgiven challenge
That I hoped to wear on my shoulders
Nothing else came through these walls
Except the screams that shattered
Your dreams

Sagacity of wanton strangeness
Coming up on the ever yielding lifelessness
In through the holiness of His miseries
Slaying the by-products of the eternal screams
To whatever cleverness you tried to balance

Retributions and dull confirmations
Kept clean for your own contributions
Slowly I saw your face of Hell and touched every way of it

Pollutions never came that easy
When Satan stared back in anguish
Dissolutions where always pure as ice
How can you now cast the dice?
Like sharpened knives of dried up shells
The informations from you was dreadlife
In its own depravity it called out
To shared visions of the sky divisions
How could I ever go this way?
How could I ever love your eyes?
Mishandled nothings of dying cavortions
Hell or Heaven was never an option

Probability is non-negotiable
Inside those cracked up bells
And came crashing in flashes
That once was you and me
They piled up Jesus-like bombshells
The mystery of the one soul given
Of all I craved
Of all I behaved
Hell or Heaven was never an option

For us
