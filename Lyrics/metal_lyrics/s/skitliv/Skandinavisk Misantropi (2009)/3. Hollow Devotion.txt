In the 1569 eyes that I see through
The real intention comes alive
So hopelessly lost in hopes all of you
I wish you all could see what I see

This world is empty as empathy

With eyes like poisoned snakes
I burn at the core of redemption
Like sick animals I'll put you to sleep
And see that this world is nothing

Incineration as healing
A wound of ecstasy
The hand that caresses
By death I give life

To enjoy everything
enjoy nothing
To know everything
know nothing
To own everything
own nothing
To be everything
be nothing

I Am the Breath of Go
