I see four suns in the sky
My limbs becomes a rope of madness
I have been awake for days on end
Trying to unravel the secret of that one great pain

There's an evil sickness inherent in humanity
Lord Christ saviour or death, just death
Descending angels â too fucking late
Face the emptiness for everything is nothingness

The procession of empty faces moves
On a path of dying dead death
The indifference of mankind â ekler meg
Souls already rotting and turning to dust

Hear the wailing, the mourning, of that ONE soul
The great emptiness that awaits us
Through forests deep and barren woods
Through the minds of dead philosophers
Towards the great nothingness
