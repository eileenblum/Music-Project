Intense burning hatred
Overwhelming pure disgust
Hear my oath of vengeance
You shall pay the price, the cost of blood
Useless, now forgotten
Leave you twisting in the wind
No love, only hatred
Pray I never see your face again
Out of my shadow, and into the flame
Gone are the comforts you once knew
Unending hatred, the fire burning bright
I seek the pleasure in your doom
Hear my oath o vengeance
Pay the price, the cost of blood
Thrash
Cut out your forked tongue, beat the blood from your wounds
Reveal the serpent that you are
My desire, you drown in your own tears
Gone is your place within my heart
