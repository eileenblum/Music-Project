They are the vultures, sent from the harvester of souls
Born of the flame down below, infernal
Destroy the righteous and the kind
I welcome them to take my life, this night
Come demons, feed upon my soul
Summon the darkness make me whole, evil
I am your instrument of death, the reaper
Horrid blasphemies now take control, becoming more creature than man
Spewing forth from the hell below, possessed by demonic legions
I offer no resistance, the demons now inside
Seduced by the fire, for veil is my....Rock
Drowning beneath the tide of chaos
Tempt and corrupt me to the bone
Savage, infected, a life of darkness
Twisted, unholy, abomination
Slave to the demons
Disciple, horrifying creation
Gorge upon my soul
Become the demon
