I am the darkness, your shining light
I now control you, your life is mine
Pray to the heavens, I keep you alive
You are the helpless, the sheep in the snow
Longing for shelter, domination
Weak and so feeble, you'd die on your own
Praise the day for I have saved you, I now rule your life
Now bestow your gifts to me, your body and your mind
Know your days are always numbered, I decide your fate
Oh give thanks upon to me, for the breaths you're allowed to take
Sick is your complete devotion, as if I'm your God
Live for me your fucking savior, as if I'm your God
I hold your pitiful life in the palm of my goddamn hand
Your release from servitude is the day that you're fucking dead
I am the darkness, your shining light
I now control you, your life is mine
Pray to the heavens, I keep you alive
You are the helpless, the sheep in the snow
Longing for shelter, domination
Weak and so feeble, you'd die on your own
