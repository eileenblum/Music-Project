Born to extinguish light from eyes, despoiler of human life
Force of destruction fury and fear, oceans of bloodletting and death draw near
Bred only to fight and to kill, my axes swinging arcs of death
Unholy bloodshed and chaos, your lungs choke and fill with your last dying breath
Rabid aggressor, frenzy of violence
Exuding evil and deadly malice
Skulls hanging from chains, crowns of slaughtered kings
Cries of headless victims, haunt my every dream
Born to extinguish light from eyes
I am the despoiler... of human life
Die, die, die, my blade deep in your chest.
