Face the onslaught, unrelenting
Overpowered, start the killing
Bleed the victims, stain the earth red
Burned and blackened, leave them all dead
Kneel before the sword or die upon it
Spill the blood of our foes
Know the carnage dies long after you
We kill the ones that you love
Living to kill, unwilling to die
What once was yours now becomes mine
When weapons raise and the blood starts to flow
You stand, you fight, you die
Upon the weakness in your soul we feed
Upon your fears, delight
Obliteration, smash your walls to the ground
We bleed you and yours dry
Burn the remnants of your demise
Face the onslaught, start the killing
