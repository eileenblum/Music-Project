Dreadful affliction, revolting infection
Breathing repugnance and death
Hear the cries, the putrid sounds
The beauty of the plague upon your tongue
Distorting every face, with foul disease
The lord of the rotten marches on
From waste there is no escape
Embrace, accept the plague
Live eternally rotten, as maggots seal your fate
Vermin eat your flesh, skin falling from bone
Delight in your sickness, now rot and decompose
Repulsive salvation
Bow before the filth, your rotting god
Worship the divine decay
Delight in the rot, the disease and pestilence
Praise the lord of the plague
Bow before the filth, your rotting god
Worship the divine decay
Delight in the rot, the disease and pestilence
Praise the lord of the plague
Infested you cry out in ecstasy
Rats and maggots cleanse your flesh
