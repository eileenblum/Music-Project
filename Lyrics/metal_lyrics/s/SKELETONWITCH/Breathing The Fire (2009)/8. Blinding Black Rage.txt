Diabolic intentions, pleasure among the sick
The only pain relevant is the pain that I shall inflict
Countless numbers of victims, returned cold to the ground
Forever in a shallow hell, dead they make no sound
Exhausted and weary from the digging of graves
Now light the bodies, set them all ablaze
Those still begging for mercy, those still clinging to the light
Cry out in horror, throw them in the fire
Flesh is now burning, eyes liquefy
Death your salvation, arise and you shall die
No mercy, no pardons, no sympathy this night
Upon the winds of bloodshed I ride
Upon the winds of bloodshed we ride
Dominate, exterminate, annihilate mankind
Contempt for the living, kill every form of life
Kill every form of life
Blinding black rage, desire to kill
Blinding back rage, a storm of bloodstained steel
Dominate, exterminate, annihilate mankind
Contempt for the living, kill every form of life
