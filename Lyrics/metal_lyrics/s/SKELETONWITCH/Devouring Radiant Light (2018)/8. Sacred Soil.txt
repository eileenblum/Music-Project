I cage my demons beneath sacred soil
Before they envelope the sky
And as they claw for their upheaval
I birth blackened wings and fly

We are the harbingers of fire
Clinging to the crux of life
We are the painters of the world we desire

To wear the face of another is to betray the mortal coil
And in the space where you find nothing
You must discover what makes blood boil

This is a call to arms
Speak the witch's language of fury and rage
The time to ascend is nigh
The strength, the will, the light
Fan the flames, become one
Ascend
