Rising into the air becoming one with the luminous sky
Discovering worlds that lie beyond
Escaping the cage created by mundane minds
The tiresome repetition of a dying star
The strength must come from inside
The furious spirit of the burning heart
May it burn forever on
Giving shades of color to a faded grey world

Diseased is the heart of the spirit that forever withers
Rise to take control, build a kingdom of lavish vigor

Life is for the living, forge a light that will never darken
The mind is an arrow, it's the sharpest tool in the quiver

Release the sensation with a force that will never weaken
The binds of the sheepish are the shackles of an utter failure
To quell the temptation of the wolves that are on the prowl
Is to delete dedication, the shades of vega fading into the night

Time is dying a horrible death
We must create the world that we want to see before the lights go dim inside
There is no turning back
It's time to bare the torch of the sacred fire that burns within our souls
The fear of death slipping through my hands causes me to clench my fists and hold to this closer than ever before
Clench my fists, bare the torch
