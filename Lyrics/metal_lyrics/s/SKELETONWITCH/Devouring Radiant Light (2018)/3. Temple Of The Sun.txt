Most things fade with time
The foundations may crumble and the world unwinds
But through these eyes of crimson light
Rebuild an empire and dwell within
Passion breeds progress, progress feeds lives
The rejection of a tainted world breeds the fire

We do not gleam for you but shine for ourselves

Most things fade with time
The foundations may crumble and the world unwinds
But in our minds our temple is divine
Construct the altar and worship the fire
The fury of the human heart illuminates the path
Shadows in the temple of the sun, echo the howl

The light, it shines through you
The light, it becomes you
