A veil of bitter cold and a river of endless filth
Feasting upon the weakened
When the body disintegrates inside of the frigid vault
Listless eyes buried in the skulls of the horde, denied

Rise for the dead of night
Our apocalyptic flight
An inch away from certain death
Into the ether

Follow the road that's set before
With perseverance ever more

The shroud that has consumed the last glimmer of light
Tearing down the mantle of this frostbitten life
Inside of the frigid vault, listless eyes buried in the skulls of the horde, denied

The vault of the withering
Enshrined by the will of our sacrifice and time
