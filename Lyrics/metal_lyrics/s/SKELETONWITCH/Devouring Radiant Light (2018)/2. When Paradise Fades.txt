Hollow visions from hollow eyes
Burning bridges, sever the binds
When sullied hands desecrate the canvas
The winds shall burn, the winds shall burn

Life becomes aimless when flightless is the mind
When paradise fades and the blood runs dry
The sky will crumble into oceans of lost time
Washed away is all the desire and all of the light

This kingdom is what you make it
And as the roots grow deep, they begin to birth passion
Fall into the depths, breathe it in
And let the heart yearn for its ardor
Remove the veil and let the eyes cut deep into the earth
