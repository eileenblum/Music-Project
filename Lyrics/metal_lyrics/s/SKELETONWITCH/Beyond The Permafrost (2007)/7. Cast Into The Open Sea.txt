Once loved rejected
Why bite the hand that feeds
Fall now down to your knees
Ask not for receive no mercy
Silence your pleading
Deaf ears to your cries
Death now certain for thee
Cast into the open sea
Cast out erased from the land
Wither and die
Die alone
I long not to see the deep fed
But lust to see you consumed
Die
