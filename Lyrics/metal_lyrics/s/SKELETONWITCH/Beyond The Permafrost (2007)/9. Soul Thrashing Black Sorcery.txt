Fear the blackness
Fury of death
Cower before the storm
Swirling inferno
Glorious evil
Suffer before the horns
From the shadows
Bathed in blood
Longing to burn your soul
Fearsome fleshless hideous reaper
Cataclysmic evil
On pestilence and death it feeds
Reaping souls for eternity
Adorned with the mark of the beast
The witch stands before you now
Burning in demon light
Condemned to serve the black
It cares now for your cries
You fall before it now
Grovel with your last breath
Your god can't save your soul
Gaze into the face of death
On pestilence and death it feeds
Reaping souls for eternity
Adorned with the mark of the beast
Soul thrashing black sorcery
