Evil one now arise
As the witch has prophesized
Once cast down now return
Spread the seed unholy birth
Inverted crosses burn
Light the way to the horns
Unholy birth
Satan spawn
Baptized in flames
Born demon seed blasphemy
Baptized in flames
Surfacing the one with wings
Razor claw
Hooves for feet
Pure evil taking form
Darkness falls across the earth
Men will die
Men will burn
No mercy the hellfire
Baptized in flames
From black womb evil is born
taking lives from conception
Born of death mother slain
Taking hold of evil's reins
Evil one now arise
As the witch has prophesized
Once cast down now return
Spread the seed unholy birth
Inverted crosses burn
Light the way to the horns
Unholy birth Satan spawn
Baptized in flames
Born demon seed blasphemy
