Shadows of vultures drawing near
To feast upon the dead
Ripping flesh from splintered limbs
Eyes from severed heads
Through broken blades and broken bones
Destroy our way to glory
Breaking those that oppose the witch
Send them to their graves
Leaving none alive
In torment all must die
The weak plead for their lives
Revel in death and demise
Shadows of vultures drawing near
To feast upon the dead
Ripping flesh from splintered limbs
Eyes from severed heads
Leaving but rotten remains of the defeated
But rotten remains of the defeated
