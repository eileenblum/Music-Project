Unwelcome you invade
This land is mine
You ways forced upon me
My way of life
You've come to conquer
You will be slaughtered
Return you to your maker
Cut down with violent hatred
You shall choke on your own blood
You fall before me crushed into dust
You've come to conquer
You will be slaughtered
Return you to your maker
Cut down with violent hatred
Limb from glorious limb you die
I separate you from your life
