Incinerate all deemed holy
Eradicate the righteous from my life
Evil now rains down upon us
Like fire from the sky
Heaven burns
Demon rising
Angels now reduced to ash
Unholy slaughter
God is dying
The age of Satan has come to pass
Evil taking over
Satan now has won
Holy spirit burning
Praise the wicked one
Incinerate all deemed holy
Eradicate the righteous from my life
Evil now rains down upon us
Like fire from the motherfucking sky
Evil taking over
Satan now has won
Holy spirit burning
Praise the wicked one
Fire from the sky
