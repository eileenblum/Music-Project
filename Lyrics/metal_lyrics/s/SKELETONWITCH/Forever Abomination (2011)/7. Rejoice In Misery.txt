Dark Gods Arise From The Blood Of Sin
Exalted Demons, Reapers Of Flesh
Legions Of Woe And Pain Undeniable
Unleashed Upon You Far Worse Things Than Death

Your Fears Are But A Waste Of Suffering
Die Now And Cry No More
Explore The Pleasure Within This Agony
Die Now And Cry No More

Embodiment Of Soul Shredding Misery
Phantom Of Torment And Death
Deity Of Pain And Glorious Suffering
Bring You To The Limits Of Your Flesh

Sent Forth To Rid You Of Your Soul
Stripped Of Your Innocence
Through Pain Beyond Control
Suffer In Anguish And Despair
Rejoice In Misery, Submit To The Servents Of Hell

Your Soul Shattered, Your Spirit Torn Apart
You Now Present Your Gift Of Blood
Your Flesh Discarded, No Body Only Pain
Your Life, Your Soul Is Mine
This Torture Never Ends
This Torture Never Ends!
