You Dare Raise Up The Cross
You Fall Now Before The Sword
No Surrender, No Mercy
Die Beneath My Blade
The Fear Of Death Cold In Your Heart
You Cry Out To Skies Above
Hold Your Tongue Or It Shall Be Ripped
Pulled From Your Head

I Am The Heathen, Dead Is The Trinity
Gone Is The One Divine Christ
Repulsed By The Light, Your Weakness Abhorent
Suffer The Believers Of The Lie
You Pray To The False, To The One True Deception
Once Again Your Words Upon Dead Ears
Shackled In Vain By Invisible Chains
You Choke Upon Betrayal, Now You Die

You Dare Raise Up The Cross
You Fall Now Before The Sword
No Surrender, No Mercy
Die Beneath My Blade
