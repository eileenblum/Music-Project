Descend into this dark realm of chaos
Plunge below the reaches of all fear
Delve within this black art of bloodshed
Sink beneath insanity, exist within this Hell

Blessed with the curse of a murderous mind of malignant evil
Tear you apart with hideous insanity
Terrified, you suffer alone

Poisoned mind of deliberate slaughter 
Controlled by the darkest of lights
Eliminate the soul of humanity
Desecrate the chosen form of life

Your last breath on Earth 
Spent in soul clutching horror

Descend into the dark realm of chaos
Sink beneath insanity, exist within this Hell
