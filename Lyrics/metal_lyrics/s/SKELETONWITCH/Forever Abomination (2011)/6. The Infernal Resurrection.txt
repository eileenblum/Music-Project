Destroyer Of The Righteous
Turn A Blind Eye To The Fucking Light
Submerged, Entwined In The Darkness
One With The Demon Inside

Infernal Resurrection
Earth Born Flesh Twisted Into This Beast
Wretched, Wicked, Demonic
On The Blood Of The Holy Ones Feed

Confess To Me All Of Your Sins
Know Your Blood Shall Wet My Hands
I Long To Be Tge Ender Of Your Life

Delieverance, Behold Your Serpent Of Salvation
Blasphemous, Malevolent Bringer Of Demise

The Stench Of Blood Upon My Breath
Through Cruelty With No Limits
Deliever You  Unto Death
Now Soon To Be A Corpse

My Desires Have Turn To Blood
I Now Condemn Your Flesh
Release You From This World

Take Of Your Body
Drink Of Your Blood
Forever Abomination
Forever Cold

Destroyer Of The Righteous
Turn A Blind Eye To The Fucking Light
Submerged, Entwined In The Darkness
One With The Demon, The Demon Inside
