I, Of The Forked Tongue
Father Of Lies
My Skin Of Deceit
Coughed, From The Bowels Of Hell
Break You Of Your Will
Down On Your Fucking Knees
Tear, Your World Apart
Your Soul Now Lost
Suffer Unto Me

Great Deceiver, Born Of Heathen Blood
Welcome To This Place Of Pain
You Dream Of Angels, I Am Your Demon
The True Cause Of Your Suffering

Damned Now Forever With Me
Fall From Grace
King Of Corruption
Deny You Of Faith

I, Of The Forked Tongue
Father Of Lies
My Skin Of Deceit
Coughed, From The Bowels Of Hell
Break You Of Your Will
Down On Your Fucking Knees
Tear, Your World Apart
Your Soul Now Lost
Suffer Unto Me

I Am The Deepest Sin
Evil That Never Ends
Disciple Of The Deep
