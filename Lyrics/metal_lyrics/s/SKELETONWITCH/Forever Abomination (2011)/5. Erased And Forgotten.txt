I As The Shadow, From Chaos I Descend
Prepare To Be Parted From Your Flesh
The Foul Stench Of Fear Now Surounds You
I Leave You A Soulless Husk Of Man

Running Wild Consumed With Blood
A Cold Chill Creeps From My Spine
Your Face Erased, Forgotten
Removed From The Eyes Of Time

You Shall Right Your Wrong

My Hands Tremble
Not Wth Fear But Desire
To Still The Heart That Beats In Your Chest

Through The Power Of Blood-laced Vengeance
I Am To Punish Your Flesh
Deliever Unto You Eternal Darkness
Crushing, Killing, Brin You To Your Death

Your Complete Annihilation
From My Hand To Your Tomb
Against The Will That Cannot Be Stopped
My Vengeance Now Is Your Doom
