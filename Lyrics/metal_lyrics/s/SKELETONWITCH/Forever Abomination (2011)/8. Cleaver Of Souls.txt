Disciple of madness, defiler of flesh
Bringer of torment, seeker of death
Spawn of the dark one, the cleaver of souls
Ripped from existence, now your blood goes cold

Chaos turns the wheels of my desire
I am the darkness, I am the storm
Unleash unending slaughter and destruction
I am the darkness, I am the storm

This mind of unspeakable horror
These hands of unstoppable pain
My breath gives life to your destruction
Revel in the salt of your remains
