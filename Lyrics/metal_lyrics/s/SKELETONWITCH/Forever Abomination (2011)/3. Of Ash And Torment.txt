Burn For Your Betrayal
For Your Lies

Suffer In The Fires Of Hell
Blister In The Pain
Burn Forever In Damnation
Tortured In The Flame

You Shall Never Know Of Flesh Again

Bound To This Fate You Suffer
Tortured Within This Domain
Commit Your Flesh To The Fire
Your Soul Condemned To The Flame
For I Am The Path Of Torment
Through Me Everlasting Pain
Burn In The Darkest Of Fires
Burn For Eternity

Your Soul Not Bound To Heaven
Of Ash And Torment You Shall Dwell
Burn In The Depths Of Damnation
Consumed In The Circle Of Hell
