The heavens bleed with fire
Demons sent forth from Hell's domain
Darkness, unleash the will of Satan
Dead, this kingdom of decay

Burned and beheaded, the remains of angels
Unholy Legions, shredding sacred flesh
Slaughter of the righteous
Destruction of the holy
Monstrous perversion, wickedness

Drink the blood of the crucified angels
Praise the name of the unmerciful goat
Rip the heart from the soul of the innocent
Hang them from the cross around their throat

Curse the light, now become of the darkness
Bewitch the heavens under evil's spell
Decimate sacred spirits of divinity
Torch the heavens with the flames of Hell

Drink the blood of the crucified angels
Praise the name of the unmerciful goat
Rip the heart from the soul of the innocent
Hang them from the cross around their throat

The heavens bleed with fire
Dead, this kingdom of decay
