I Stand As Death, Fixed
Consumed In The Taking Of Life, Your Mind, Spirit, Your Body
Fear Holds Tight As You Die

Through Eyes Of Torment
Now Stare Into The Face Of Hell
Your Life Spent On Your Knees
Reduced To The Failure Of Prayer

Pray For Forgiveness, Pray For Mercy
Have Faith That I Will Rape Your Soul

Your Life Of Devotion Now Useless
Your Years Of Blind Faith Are But Lies
Your Tears Are But Drops In The Ocean
Your Faith Is To Suffer, By My Hands Now You Die

Soul Abandoned
Now Ripped Away
Your Faith Is A Failure
Dead In Your Grave

Beg Of Your God Now To Save You
Spare You From My Wicked Hand
And Yet Your Prayers Go Unanswered
Your God Is Not To Blame, Your God Does Not Exist

Your Life Of Devotion Now Useless
Your Years Of Blind Faith Are But Lies
Your Tears Are But Drops In The Ocean
Your Faith Is To Suffer, By My Hands Now You Die

Die!
