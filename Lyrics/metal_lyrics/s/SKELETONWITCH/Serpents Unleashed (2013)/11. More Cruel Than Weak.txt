There shall come a time when every man must show their worth
A time to stand and fight, dominate this rotting earth
This darkness gives me reason
From this evil I draw strength
To welcome death over failure
To curse the name of defeat

My hands my own salvation, my cause of victory
Triumph only comes to those, to those that possess the will
To confront, annihilate the enemy
Crush, destroy and kill
Vicious determination
A will stronger than death
To remain clawing and scratching
Until I draw my last breath
If I must go down, I will go down fucking hard

My spoils won't be denied
I shall take what I desire
I stand more cruel than weak
Through hatred I survive
Speak not to me of saviors
I reject the word, the false
No allegiance to the myth
For I am my own god

Triumph only comes to those, to those that possess the will
To confront, annihilate the enemy
Crush, destroy and kill
This darkness gives me reason
From this evil I draw strength
To welcome death over failure
To curse the name of defeat
The witch is my salvation
Through evil victory
