Ravaged, withered, defeated
Broken, weak, lost, forgotten
And when the cold wind blows
My time to wither and crumble
I will control my fate
To time I will not suffer
I'll die by my own hand
I will not wait for death a feeble rotting end
I will not bow down to time
I'll be the one to end my life (that's right)
Rot away

My body home beneath dead leaves
Alone into the darkness
Upon this frozen ground I bleed
Returned to the earth
The wind, the ice take back my flesh
Fade away

My bones one with the winter cold
The cold
The cold
And when the cold wind blows
My time to wither and crumble
I will control my fate
To time I will not suffer
