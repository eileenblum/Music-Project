A mind plagued with madness
Thoughts bathed in bloodlust
In search of the one true darkness
Soul now wreathed in chaos

Horrid blood soaked nightmares
Evil behind dark eyes
These dreams now forged into action
Tear apart the flesh, spill the blood
Die

Blade on the flesh, blood on my hands
Those of the dying become the dead
The breaker of bone
The butcher of life
The shadow of death
Your blood is mine
Your blood is mine

A mind plagued with madness
Thoughts bathed in bloodlust
In search of the one true darkness
Soul now wreathed in chaos

Horrid blood soaked nightmares
Evil behind dark eyes
These dreams now forged into action
Tear apart the flesh, spill the blood
Die
