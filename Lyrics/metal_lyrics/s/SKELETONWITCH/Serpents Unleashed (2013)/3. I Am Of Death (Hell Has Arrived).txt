I am the venom, I am the serpent born of flesh
I am of carnage, I am the dark one, killer of man, I am death
Architect of your destruction
Your soul lost, hell has arrived
Paralyzed by ultimate horror
As the hope fades from your eyes
You become my sacrifice
I am here to take your life
Silence now your final cries
Know your fear for it is I
Darkness now surrounds you
No light shines from your eyes
Your end now but an earthly hell
Your pain of the divine
Savagely destroy you
I rip through bone and flesh
A monument to misery
Salvation only death
Only death
Your soul led to the fire, Your body to the ground
Rot in the earth
You belong now to the darkness, Your eyes forever closed
Now join the dead
Now join the dead
I am the venom, I am the serpent born of flesh
I am of carnage, I am the dark one, Killer of man, I am of death
