Save your prayers there is no god here
Cry out as demons walk this earth
Evil ascends from dark dimensions
Open the gates of hell

Drowning in this crushing misery
Drenched in the beauty of pain

Bound within the chains of torment
Suffer now in unspeakable ways
Take your place among the damned
Cursed until the end of time

Your flesh tortured for eternity
Butchering the human carcass

A torturous hell awaits you
One of blood and sacrifice
Forgiveness now escapes you
Your time is due, your flesh the price

Your pain is everliving
As above now so below
Your suffering unending
Everlasting, no mercy shown

Eternal horror,
beyond broken you're stripped of skin
Embrace the slaughter
Resurrection now die, die, die again

Bound within the chains of torment
Suffer now in unspeakable ways
Take your place among the damned
Cursed until the end of time

Drowning in this crushing misery.
Butchering the human carcass
