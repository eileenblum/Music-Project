I am the demon cloaked within the light of darkness
Wretched one of heart so black
The bitter cold of death surrounding
Fear within your soul
A mind enraged with one desire
See your flesh burned from your bone
Unleash the storm of your destruction
End your life in fire, in flame
Beast from the blackness
Oh darkest hell
Hands moved by the tongue of the serpent
Bringer of vengeance
Blind to forgiveness
Suffer in the fires of repentance 
Now burn
From flesh burn to ash
From ash then to dust
Your life now feeds the flame
Choke on the ashes as you die
Your fate but a living cremation
Suffer burned alive
Your flesh now gone to ash 
Consumed in the fires of vengeance
Your sins purified in the flame 
Your bones reduced to dust
All black
