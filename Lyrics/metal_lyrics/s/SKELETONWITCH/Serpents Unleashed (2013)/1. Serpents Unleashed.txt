A thorn within the goddamn crown
Evil that will not sleep
Demonic, defiant, eyes of burning chaos
With darkness at our side
Evil at our command
Crush the weak and feeble, their place within the dust
Rain fire from the shadows
Striking hard and fast
Vomiting the blackest hate
The spawn of wickedness
Wickedness
My soul an empty vessel
One that only blood can fill
A testament to viciousness
Destroy as serpents unleashed
Sew the earth with the dead
A thorn within the goddamn crown
Evil that will not sleep
Demonic, defiant, eyes of burning chaos
With darkness at our side
Evil at our command
Crush the weak and feeble, their place within the dust
