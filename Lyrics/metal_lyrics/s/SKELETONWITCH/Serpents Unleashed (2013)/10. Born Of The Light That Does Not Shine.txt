Oh lord of the night
From under the darkness rise
Spirit foul upon the wind
Carried forth on rotten wings

Demon of flesh
Wicked, breathless, old
Born of the light that does not shine
Not of the dead, yet not alive

Drinker of blood
A leech upon your soul
Infernal filth of God's creation
Cursed eternal damnation

Taker of flesh
Never-ending hunt for blood
From the darkness now unleashed
To feed upon humanity

The one you fear shall feed in the moonlight
Your time of flesh now ends
Demonic deeds your blood is sacrificed
Your time of flesh now ends
Your time of flesh now ends
Die in unholy slaughter
I now demand your blood
Eyes void of light your soul now abandoned
Life is ending, body drained and cold
Drained and cold
