The sun fades to blackness, the moon to blood
Stars fall from a darkened sky

In the name of torment
In the name of death and pain
Curse the crown, deny your god or die

The evil that once was
Now re-emerge from the abyss
Feel the grip of darkness
Death's hand around your throat
No life is safe from the slaughter
Children now struck dead
Thunder from a cloudless sky
This earth now but a grave
Your body feeds the crows

The pale horse and the rider death
Hand down the final blessing of extinction
Kill them all, leaving none alive
Apocalyptic slaughter of the living
Your cries are met with silence
Call upon your god as you suffer
Oh how blind are the eyes of faith
Destroyed by the will of the demon

The sun fades to blackness, the moon to blood
Stars fall from a darkened sky
