Black clouds arise and surround
The righteous men and their thrones
Swarms of pestilence
Breaking the horizon
Ready to fill their bodies
With the flesh of the
Dead

[Chorus]
Let their voices call
For their heroes
Liberators set on
Annihilation of your morality
Bring them to their knees

The false pretense
Can only carry
You so far before it shatter
Leaving all the self inflicted
Misery exposed for all to see

Go mold them
With your words
The signs will point to
No consent
When the will fails
Then so does
The cause you
Gave your life for
The only cage you've built
Is your own

Accept the lies you're given
And never question
The words they force fed
The young and innocent
