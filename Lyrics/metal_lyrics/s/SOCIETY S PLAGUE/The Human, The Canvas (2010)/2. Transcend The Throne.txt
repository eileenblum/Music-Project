With open eyes I see now
That every turns brings nothing
But destruction and ignorance
Take my hand I will
Guide you through this storm
Have faith in what I give you
When all you know is torn
When you step through
The path I laid before you
Will you remember

[Chorus]
How can you save me
When you can't save yourself
What do you believe
When you watched it come down
You brought this on yourself

When it opens up
And you look towards the sky
You will see mercy
Denied
See me as I bleed
You brought this on yourself
