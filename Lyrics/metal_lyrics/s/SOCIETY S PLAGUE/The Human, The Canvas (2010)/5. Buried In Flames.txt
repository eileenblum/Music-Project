Don't sit there so forlorn
The bitter taste will subside
Regret is the poison for the assertive one
Who ascends above
The trivial embellishments
And makes the most
Of the loss
Now is the time
Make it count
Run as far as you can
Let courage
Be your strength
And none will break you

[Chorus]
I'm stuck here again screaming for the flames
The silence only makes me wonder
If the fate of all
Were in your hands
I'd see your body burn

No this isn't my time
I will watch
The flames
Consume the night
