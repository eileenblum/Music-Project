Again
Falling faster into
This disaster
Awaiting the response
So typical of you
Reminding me of the thoughts
I thought had washed away
The sight lingers more
And you smell of faint deceit
Open your eyes the repressed
Thoughts you once had come to life
Around you see there's no way out

[Chorus]
Remove yourself
And you will see
Your ignorance
Is what keeps you free

Lies of the broken
Spitting their words
Forsaken and
Spreading their curse

Making it harder to be
What you've tried to show
Burning away inside me
What you could never be
Waking your tongue around
Dripping with envy

[Chorus]

Lies of the broken spitting their words
