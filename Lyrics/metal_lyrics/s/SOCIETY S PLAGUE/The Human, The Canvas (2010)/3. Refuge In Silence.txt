It's not with apathy
That I am humbled
Buy the sound of the voices
Reaching into my
Soul this time
It's not about the pain
Every breath you take in
Is just a mockery
I am not
The one to overlook
Ill put your faith back in it's place

I am the martyr
Tearing your temple
In search of the freedom
You will deny me

[Chorus]
When the silence
Takes over me
Just know that's it how it has to be
