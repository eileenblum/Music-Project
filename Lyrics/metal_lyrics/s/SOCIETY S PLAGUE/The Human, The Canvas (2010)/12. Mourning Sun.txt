Redemption never felt so good
As it does right now
But just one time I wish I could
Be my own self
You put us into
This silence
Where I can hear your voice say
You are wrong

[Chorus]
And I want you to see
The sacrifices
That I've made for this
And I want you to know
That this is so hard for me
To leave the ones I love

Temptation never was so hard
Until I gave in
To all the possibilities
I've worked so hard for
You put us into
This silence
Where I can hear your voice say
You were wrong
