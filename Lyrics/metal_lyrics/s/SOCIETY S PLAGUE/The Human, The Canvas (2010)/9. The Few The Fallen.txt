Show me what makes you stand up
When everything
Turns to ashes

Paralyzed
By my own senses
Holding me up by the throat
The signs all are overwhelming
Mistakes and mistakes building
Hold on to what you can when
Everything is stripped away
The Lies and fights and blood and tears will
Flood the lungs they breathe with
Hold on when the time comes
You'll see that
the pain was not in vain

Hole up in your own perception
Wrap yourself in the lies that shield you from
The life you've forfeit
For what?
Well not me not anymore
This time is mine
I will stand up fot
The ones who cannot stand themselves

[Chorus]
When your destruction comes will you crawl
On your hands and knees
When this moment comes will you
Stand up and Fight

Stand up and Fight

Or will you fall like the rest

[Chorus]

Will you let this moment define you?
Or will you let it break you
