Welcome
Into an existence
Content without questioning limits
You decide
What is it all worth
To see or uphold
The ignorant
This is your life
So paint it
How you see fit

[Chorus]
So if you won't open your eyes
You're a fool
This time has never been so crucial
This is your chance
To prove you're more
Than another stain on the human canvas
The human canvas

Just believe
And let the doubts subside
This is an invitation

Welcome into an existence
Where no one believes in resistance
This was your life
To transform
You could've been so much more
Than you could ever believe
Until you fell
