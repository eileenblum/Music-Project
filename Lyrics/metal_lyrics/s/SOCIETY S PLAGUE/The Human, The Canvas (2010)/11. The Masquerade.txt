Reveal the poison
Covering
Everything
Like malice gripping it's hand
To choke out impurities
Zig zags coursing through our veins
What stand now to purify
Lead the thoughts just a bit further
To a conclusion you cant deny
It all comes to this comes
To what is now defined
What you see worth living for
When death is justified
That's right just keep it in
Make sure it hits you right here
Push past the surface and
Reveal the fear

[Chorus]

You act like you've one and
There's nothing to fear
There's no longer restraints
To hold you here
And I will define
What you'll never be

You act like you've won
And there's nothing to fear
There's no longer restraints
To hold you here
And you'll go on with
Life day by day
Following suit
With the masquerade
