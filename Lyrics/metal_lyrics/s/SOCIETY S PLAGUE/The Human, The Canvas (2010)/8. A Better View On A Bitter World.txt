See through
This constant struggle
Blinding you from what
Matter the most
Escape the prison you're in
The walls of your regret
The freedom calling you
If only you will stand

Escape
The prison you're in
The walls are holding you in

Do what it takes to make you
Move on from what will take you
Away from everything
Think about the failures and
Release yourself from that fall
The poison in your words
And forget
The ones who brought you here

[Chorus]
Just keep it coming know knock me down
And I wont let you keep me down this time
This isn't what my life's about
The final say is mine

Disgusted
With your deception
The signs ring out like
The lies you spit

[Chorus]

And I know what
It means to suffer
The the pains and trials that
We must
Endure always
But to stand
Is to have survived
This truth will survive
