Going to the show to play out of control daemonic rock and roll
All I need is a bag of weed and some acid please
But we ainât got no money ainât got no ride out
But when we arrive it will be time to get
Wasted Daemonic Rock
Wasted Last Ones Up

It swirls magnificently I have held court with the acid king
I have met the rainbow wizard and the dark lady massaged my bones
Daemonic Rock suck my cock
Detroit metal punks we do not give a fuck

Roll up we pull up all of us show up all the natives throw up
Baldy says no he says we got to go we had to sleep in the forest
Fuck your pretty town we will burn this city down
When we get back to the wasteland it will be time to get
Wasted Daemonic Rock
Wasted The Last Drop

I have seen the light and it is out of sight
Do you know what it is like to be dead it feels alright!
They are whispering to me deathly visions flash constantly
Body parts scattered amongst my room
Make good decorations for Halloween
Daemonic Rock suck my cock
Detroit metal punks we do not give a fuck
Fuck you you bet your motherfucking ass!
