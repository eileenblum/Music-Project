Strip me down tear off my clothes
Dip me in the bath that glows
Acid Bath
Take me in and fuck me up
Strip me down then cut me up
Acid Bath

Grandmas house is where I stay
Hitch a ride if your going my way
Drink some beers and pump some iron
Have a beer stay for a while
Polaroid I like your smile
I will paint your skull grey

Drill a hole into my skull
Drip it in makes me so dull
Acid Bath
Strip me down tear off my clothes
Dip me in the bath that glows
Acid Bath

Feeling woozy from that drink?
Do you think my apartment stinks?
Going to drag you to my bedroom
Now I am going to have my way
Cut off your dick and put it away
Along with the shrine of bones in my closet
