666 I am of the Devil I am of the Devil in Hell
Take me down take me down the river take me to where Satan dwells
Sign my name on the parchment sign my name inked in my own blood
Bow down now to your new master lick my buttocks for I am your new god

666 I am of the Devil I am of the Devil in spells
In a trance watch the flame dance through the crystal realm
Deeper now into Absu memories from a past life
All alone in the darkness Devil has entered my mind

My eyes roll back and they turn black I am inside but I am not quite here
Personality shifts and morbid thoughts drift and nothing at all seems clear
I have pulled the moon and it shows me soon that something draws ever near
I must wield the axe I must take it back and harness my constant feat the fear
