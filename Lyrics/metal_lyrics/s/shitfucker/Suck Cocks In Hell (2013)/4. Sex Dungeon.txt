Mysterious murders, Blood stinking odours
Seep through the cracks of the floor
Hard luck booze runners gun slinging mothers
Going to take you behind locked doors
Sex Dungeon

Down the stairs you feel scared you shall see light nevermore
Start to shake start to ache as you feel the dampness of the floor
Chained shackled leather straps restrain you are fucking chained
You are shackled you will never see your family again

Chained women bleeding
Some dead with rats feeding
On their carcass evermore
As you look up he lifts his hood up
Flesh fresh rot right off the skull
Sex Dungeon
