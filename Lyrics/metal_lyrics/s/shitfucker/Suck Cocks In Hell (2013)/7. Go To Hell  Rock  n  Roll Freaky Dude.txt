It is never too hot for leather unless it is too fucking hot
Trapped in the eyes of thy neighbour infernal mother of death
She chokes on the smoke of our unholy tokes
Through the hole in her throat she stares through my window
And stands on my lawn you cannot understand her
Because she speaks in daemonic tongues
Trapped in a glance with the living corpse that lives next door go to hell

Play it loud play on ten play it so you wake the dead
I have awakened the mother of the reaper
Who has unleashed the darkness fever
Through my brain down the drain
To the pits that have no name
Where the most rotten pieces of shit finally go insane go to hell

(Alright all you fucking shit soldiers I want you smoking weed, take LSD
and turn this shit up on your stereo loud!
If you got that awful granny up your ass
telling you your hairâs too long, you playing too loud, and that you are wasting your life?
You look at that old bitch and you say you are going to die and you are going to  SUCK COCKS IN HELL!)

They always laugh at me and spit into my face
They say I look like the weird one Gay thing from outer space
But now when I look at them deathly fear has left its trace
Now I am the one laughing as I mutilate their face
Rock and Roll Freaky Dude

Old women who stick to old tradition steer clear to stay out of my way
As they pass the start to mumble fast about the strange man and begin to pray
They always scoff at me with the utmost disgust and disgrace
Even my own granny says I got a wasted brain
Rock and Roll Freaky Dude

The people ask if I am a rockstar the children ask if I am a vampire
Their mothers ask to suck my cock and then they ask me to stab them to death
The little children how I want to kill them
And suck their blood young lives for the master
I am the pastor of darkness because I am the rock nâ roll freaky
Fuck the virgin for satanic love haunt this town living death in my frown
Fucking hatred for god above Hail Satan! Kill for master!
