[performed by Shitfucker]Shiny webs laced with eggs
Tiny legs that like to spread
Children that mothers dread
The ones who know what it's like to be dead

Araknid
Araknaphobia

See the children scream
They scream while they dream
See them choke and gargle blood
When they make bubbles it's such fun
We're on the loose
We're on the run
That splattered pig is what we've done

Araknid
Araknaphobia

Hear them bad boys play
The anguish they display
Feel our fangs sink into you
We pump our poison into you
When you see us you will run
From fucking spider devil punks
