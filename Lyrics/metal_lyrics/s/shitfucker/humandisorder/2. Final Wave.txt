Who will fight the war when all soldiers are dead?
Not me motherfucker!
Get your son instead

[Chorus:]
Who gets to choose who will live or die?
In the game of war, generals play God

Each generation is promised its war
but who will fight and what for?

Who will live or die?

Each generation is fucked by police bastard
Rotting corpse in a grave next to your mother

[Chorus]
