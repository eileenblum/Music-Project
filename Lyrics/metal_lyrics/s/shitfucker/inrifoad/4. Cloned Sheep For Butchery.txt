A perverted God created man
To kill and choke the earth of blood 

Populace is now plugged in
Fed to be content
Silent under mass control
Until our lives end

Masses now plugged in
A vegetated state
We are all in line
We share the same fate
All cloned sheep for butchering

Your sick God sits in his throne
and masterbates to our disposal
