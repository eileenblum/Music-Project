IN MY HEAD THERES SCREAMING
AND LETTERS SPELLING FOAD
I FUCKING WANT IT ALL
INTAKE THE POWER LOAD

MY SOUL DEPARTS MY BODY
TRAVELS THROUGH MIST AND FOG
MANIPULATING YOUR MIND
YOU CANNOT SEE ME AT ALL

OBSESSED
POSSESSED
I SEE ALL

OBSESSED
POSSESSED
THROUGH THE EYES OF THE WOLF

I PROWL
WHENS ITS TIME YOU WILL ARISE
MY OBSESSION WITH POSSESSION HAS LOST CONTROL
AND I SHALL SEND YOU INTO FORGOTTEN REALMS

I FEEL IT DEEP INSIDE MY HEART
ITS POUNDING NOW
PULSATING, THROBBING MEMBER IS POUNDING NOW
DEEP INSIDE YOUR BOWELS
I PENETRATE WITH FORCE
YOU'LL BE A LEATHER MAD DAD
YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

OBSESSED
POSSESSED

OBSESSED
POSSESSED
THROUGH THE EYES OF THE WOLF

I HOWL
WHENS ITS TIME YOU WILL ARISE
MY OBSESSION WITH POSSESSION HAS LOST CONTROL
AND I SHALL SEND YOU INTO FORGOTTEN REALMS

HEY
ALRIGHT
