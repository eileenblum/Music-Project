THE FUTURE HAS IN STORE FOR US A COLD AGE
THE AGE OF NUCLEAR FROST

YOUR APPENDAGES FALL OFF
THEY BURN BLACK AND START TO ROT
EVERY ORIFICE STARTS TO BLEED 
DRIPPING, CRACKED BLISTERS BLEED

FLAKES OF ASH FALL FROM THE SKY
BLANKETS BODIES PILED HIGH
FROZEN GRAVES WITHIN THE SNOW
RADIATE AND START TO GLOW

I DREAM OF BEING DEAD IN NUCLEAR FROST

ITS A COLD AGE ON A NUCLEAR PAGE
THE AGE OF NUCLEAR FROST
