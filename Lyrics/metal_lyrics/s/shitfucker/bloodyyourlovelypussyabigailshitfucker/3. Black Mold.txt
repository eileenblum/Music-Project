[performed by Shitfucker]At the house where no one goes
If your not punk or metal you can F.O.A.D
Beware, Be scared, you better not go there
Because we stick to a strict Shitanik code

In the basement the earth shakes
Through the cracks it penetrates
The mold it forms upon the wall

The black festers in our brains
In our veins and in our names
The stench of death followed us this far...
Black Mold

You made the wrong choice
This house is cursed
The Devil's in the past
Revel fast and burnt
See the carving upon the wall
Blasphemous shit sigil, Devil's call

In the attic the walls slant
In the dark we start to chant
The mold it forms upon the walls

Portal to another world
In the darkness it unfolds
As we stare into the mold...
Black Mold

Stare into the black
You're on your back
Paralysis
You bet your life to the abyss
