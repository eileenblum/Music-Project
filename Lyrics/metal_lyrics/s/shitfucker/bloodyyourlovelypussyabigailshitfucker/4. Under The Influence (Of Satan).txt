[performed by Shitfucker]It starts with a spark
An interest in the dark
An undying will
Like a potion potent to kill

It leads to an obsession
Of primeval questions
Forgotten and lost
Through infinite dimensions

Under the influence of Satan

It lives in this town
Where everybody drowns
In a cesspool of shit
The hatred it fills you 
The violence it fuels you
and leads to the kill
When the blood is spilled
All innocence is lost
Get to the top at all costs

Under the influence of Satan

Rock is my religion
And Satan is my God
If this is not your code
Then you can fucking F.O.A.D
I am a hard rock bastard
Who chose the fuck off path
Now get on your fucking knees
And suck my fucking ass
