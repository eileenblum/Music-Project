I close my eyes to feel the breeze flow between my fingers
I remember the days, the life we've now lost
Now only memories remain
I've run through the land of lost souls
For sometime I've been searching for you
You're the one I've been dreaming of
To summon your soul again

Where are you
Wherever you may be
I will come for you
I promise you this, I promise you this

A looming sense of familiarity
I have been here before
Unaware of the 'cause
Blind to the cure
Let all I am just fade away
Fade away

We didn't swim we didn't try
I watched you go and I can feel us sinking
We didn't swim we didn't try
This bed of roses bares thorns inside

There's not much more, that I can do I've prayed for years in darkness
Until a voice appeared from silence you came echoed by the pain

I can't escape from this place in my head, I wish could take back those things I said

I summon your soul

Did you write me in your future, blood sweat and tears for ink, now you've left me outside in the rain our dreams left to sink

Where are you
Wherever you may be
I will come for you
I promise you this, I promise you this
Where are you
Wherever you may be
I will come for you
Just give me a sign because you need to know

A looming sense of familiarity, I have been here before.
Unaware of the 'cause blind to the cure
Let all I am just fade away
Fade away

We didn't swim we didn't try, I watched you go and I can feel us sinking
We didn't swim we didn't try, this bed of roses bares thorns inside

This feeling of pain runs deep within
Your shadow hanging over me
Your breath on my neck, you whisper my name, we only part to meet again
