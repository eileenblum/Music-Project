Beaks of twisted coal pour out
From it's twitching eyes
Permeate each aching hole
To feast upon the night

My bed of needles holds the pillow
Casket for my skull

Emaciated hollow screeching
For my rabid heart to swallow

Sever the hope that already fades
Perish the thought of leaving this place

Coils of seeing veins that have long burrowed through
Blood soaked skin beckons the call
I want to dance with them all

I feel you crawl under my skin, your touch so familiar, it kills me inside, burns me alive buried me deep underground
I feel you crawl under my skin, like you've been here before,
I know this place there's nowhere to hide, the pain it grows deeper inside

I see death as a comma
And not a full stop
So I'll see you in her my old friend
By my hand you shall rot

The sonnet of singing bones is entirely smothered with guilt
This thirst can't stay un-quenched
All that you love shall fucking wilt

Withered ropes entangle me between the rotting trees
Old and twisted willow bulging blood and misery

Sever the hope that already fades
Perish the thought of leaving this place

Coils of seeing veins that have long burrowed through
Blood soaked skin beckons the call
I want to dance with them all

I feel you crawl under my skin, your touch so familiar, it kills me inside, burns me alive buried me deep underground
I feel you crawl under my skin, like you've been here before,
I know this place, there's nowhere to hide, the pain it grows deeper inside
