Cast out by the one she loved
Isolated by guilt
Tortured by sorrow
Embrace the dark powers that be

Ivory skin and lips drip with blood
Enchantress you're so bewitching
Your beauty vicious as is your scorn
She waits for me

Embraced by night
Free from the light
In darkness my heart forever held
Held by deaths hands
Souls of the damned
Unhallowed be thy name

Are you this dark that I've been dreaming of
Tell me what do you fear
Confide in me bare me your soul
Are you just as lonely

Let the moonlight entrance you
May the dawn never come
Look what you've done you've left me this way
Unhallowed be thy name

As we fall lower than the virtuous
Fall further than the righteous still
Be absorbed by the mortal desire that lurks in us all
Temptation be one with my soul again
Temptation be one with my soul
Be absorbed by the mortal desire
Embrace the dark powers that be
Deliver this evil from me

Ivory skin and lips drip with blood
Enchantress you're so bewitching
Your beauty vicious as is your scorn
She waits for me

Are you this dark that I've been dreaming of
Tell me what do you fear
Confide in me bare me your soul
Are you just as lonely

Embraced by night
Free from the light
In darkness my heart forever held
Held by deaths hands
Souls of the damned
Unhallowed be thy name
Let the moonlight entrance you
May the dawn never come
Look what you've done you've left me this way
Unhallowed be thy name

Let the moonlight entrance you
May the dawn never come
Look what you've done you've left me this way
Unhallowed be thy name

With these selfish hands I pray, to be released from this spell,
It's all in vein, the only name, I grace, resides in hell
