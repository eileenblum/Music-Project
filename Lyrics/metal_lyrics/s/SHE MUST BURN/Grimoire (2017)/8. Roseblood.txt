Back to the fire, gateway of hell
The flakes from the embers falling down
This flaming figure burning alive
Giving your life to this miserable night
I see the fear, sorrow and pain in your eyes
And now we're paying the price for your insufferable lies
Suffer deeply, much more than before
The flame at your back rises up from the floor
Cursed, doomed, enslaved and entombed
Piercing the heart it reopens the wound
This life of destitution, lonesome and hurt
Bound by the one to hold its curse
Goddess on fire lights up the sky the smoke pours from your eyes
Molten sacrifice lasting 'til light
Giving your life to this
Miserable night
I see the fear sorrow and pain in your eyes
And now we're paying the price for your insufferable lies
Suffer deeply, much more than before
The flame at your back rises up from the floor
Cursed, doomed, enslaved and entombed
Piercing the heart it reopens the wound
This life of destitution, lonesome and hurt
Bound by the one to hold its curse
Hold its curse
