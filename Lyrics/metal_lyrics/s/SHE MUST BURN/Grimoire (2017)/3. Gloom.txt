Wrapped in black, strapped and imprisoned, destined for merciless independence
Ornate by your masters design, infested endearment, Shamed and left in despair

Exiled in misery, left entirely alone
Without a name to label such obscurity
Ever so intriguing, deeply cut by the loss
Spawned from this hate and stripped of all your purity

No reflection, abolished immortality
Your life is shit and that's just the reality

Oh, you suffer beautifully
And that's just the reality

Sound the melody that's sung down your chest
Through its hollowest caverns
It's loneliest chamber impressed
Though it longs for a rhythm

Dragged to your grave
Snatched from your worthless existence
Left to burn in the fires of hell

Impairment of vision, blind of sensitivity
You servant of the damned, such an insignificant being

Wrapped in black, strapped and imprisoned, destined for merciless independence
Ornate by your masters design, infested endearment,
Shamed and left in despair
