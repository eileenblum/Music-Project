I'm in the darkest place
I've ever been in my mind
Seeking these things that I've now forgot
To find myself and who I used to be
Hell is your home and you found it in me

I take my curse to the grave
To live a life full of regret
Will this nightmare come to an end?
Just leave me here. I want to forget

I've watched you walk away, so many times before
How has it come to this?
The distance between us, draws us so much closer
Have we been down this road before?

Out of sight, out of mind

When I remember you, I will not weep you'll lay there forever
When I remember you, in death now you sleep, resting in peace

These days are endless and the nights are sleepless
I can't believe that it's come to this
The distant memories of my past now haunt me
Like a knife to my chest. A noose 'round my neck

I bare this pain until death
Living a life full of regret
I wish we'd never met, I don't have to go
Just leave me here. I want to forget

I've watched you walk away, so many times before
How has it come to this?
The distance between us, draws us so much closer
Have we been down this road before?

Out of sight, out of mind

When I remember you, I will not weep you'll lay there forever
When I remember you, in death now you sleep resting in peace

Now that you're gone
I'm left alone
You left me here
To die on my own
