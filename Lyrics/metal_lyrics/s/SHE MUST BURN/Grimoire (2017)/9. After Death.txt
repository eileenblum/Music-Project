Ravens claws pierce through my chest
It's beak relentlessly devours the rest

Who be the lord of these ebony beasts
Forth they are sent Valkyries
Black arrows cut through the cold misty eve
Gathering souls from the severed remains
Glance upon flesh with thy glistening eye
Gather whatever is required this night

Pick the flesh from the bones and bare all to see
Where am I to go from here
Oh raven oh symbol of death, you keep tormenting me, casting my shadow so bleak driving me deep, deep in to madness

Moonlit eyes cast the passageway into your soul, illuminate your
Past for your fate to unfurl
Let me guide your spirit be one with the wind, enticed by the Shadow of doubt

Since death I've feared the worse, speak and tell me if I'm blessed or cursed

Black marble are the eyes of the raven, speak and tell me if I'm blessed or cursed, a sign of misfortune as I breath my last
Carry my spirit from life, into death

Pick the flesh from the bones and bare all to see
Where am I to go from here
Oh raven oh symbol of death, you keep tormenting me, casting my shadow so bleak driving me deep, deep in to madness

Moonlit eyes cast the passageway into your soul, illuminate your past for your fate to unfurl
Let me guide your spirit be one with the wind, enticed by the shadow of doubt

To behold such beauty repulsing
The stench of death is truly revolting
Her silhouette drifts, gracefully floating
I wish to leave no secrets
