I can't hold it down, pretending I am all that I'm not
You're the thought drifting through my mind
Again, from dark till light

This was meant to be. Finishing each other's
Sentences. I hope that you know how much you
Mean to me, but I guess it don't even matter!

You say I'm losing grip on what's important
Don't be so fucking critical! These are my choices,
You have broken me down for the last time

[Chorus:]
I walk this path alone, the ever lasting romance
I'm still so blinded by the darkness
Recreate the dream

Pupils ablaze, with echoes of all the lost tears
The sound burns in the deep
But the hallows hold my heart

Shards of speech penetrate,
Like freshly sharpened blades I cut you out

The dark forest consumes with its sad eyes,
The moon watching ever over dancers
Convulsing to her mournful tune. Midnight
Looms and slippers shatter, glass penetrates
The beast promises to find her.
Aching fur trapped in the howling night
Quiet as a child now sleeping in demise
The skin of those now lost and once caressed
They were lovers without knowing, blackened
By regret

This endless maze, inside my head
The lord of evil, king of the dead!

Pores swelling with sorrow, her bones reaching
Out for home, secrets she could only know,
But I guess that's just the way it goes

That's just the way it goes

[Chorus:]
I walk this path alone, the ever lasting romance
I'm still so blinded by the darkness
Recreate the dream
[2x]

Blinded by your love for lies, your love lies
