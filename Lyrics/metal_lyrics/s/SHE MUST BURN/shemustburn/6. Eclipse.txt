With your hungry glare, behind the webs
Where you cast your spells
The things that you say,
They drive me insane
The book will not burn,
The book will not burn
How I see you crave his porcelain
Ever so much all some more
Supple flesh where dreams pursue

[Chorus:]
Empty souls they surround me
Haunted faces, worn out places
Calling me home, calling me home
How your eyes have adorned
Such sadness now, I'm never coming home,
Coming home

This shall be, a finely flippant funeral,
The wolf salutes me
Haunted thought, emptiness,
Holds me from sleep

Acrid fumes are rising over me, let go,
Floating down the crimson ravine,
So let darkness take me in
Burning flesh will sting my nose,
As misery finally streams
A thousand unsung screams inside,
But no tears are left to hide
I'm losing my mind

[Chorus:]
Empty souls they surround me
Haunted faces, worn out places
Calling me home, calling me home
How your eyes have adorned
Such sadness now, I'm never coming home,
Coming home

I'm so at my best baby,
When my teeth are sharp as shit
We could hang together,
Kicking each other's chairs away

Choking till no air is left
How I see you crave his porcelain
Ever so much all some more
Supple flesh where dreams pursue

I'm only half alive,
But I've seen plenty of things
That have scared and destroyed my eyes
I've been dying to find out all the reasons
That I left my sanity behind

I've been trying to wash blood off my hands
Still soaked in the innocence of you
There's a stench of filth left in here
There's a stench of pain

We've been turning the other cheek
For too long, a life of sin
That's brought old habits home
But we're still only half alive
