Evacuate my life, evacuate the afterlife.
It's so much worse when you smell a smell
You know so well, even so
I don't know what to say to you,
I try to speak
But you start twisting my words again
The dread of facing another day
Everything is so black.

I live a life of loneliness, filled with pain
Living life with nothing
Surrounded by dismay, unthinkable shame

I will run and I will hide,
All the pain she felt inside
I want to scream, I want to cry
Why can't I let her die?

Let her die!

I don't know what to say to you,
I try to speak
But you start twisting my words again
The dread of facing another day
Everything is so black

I'm lost in life, you've lost me, I'll run and hide
Away from all your deceit and lies
Forget me once, but don't forget me twice
Who is this that you want me to be?

Who is it that you want me to be?

Late night thinking, not blinking, I'm sinking
Re-thinking my choice of words
It's so absurd

Disbelief, in the reincarnation of Aphrodite
Love deceased, you bury me in sorrow,
I took your heart with me
I sleep beneath the soil, deep below the trees
Blinded by tears
My lips are laced together,
They can't be torn apart

I don't want to go back
To the life I was living before

I will never see the sun again!
Fuck(!) this life!
Fuck(!) this life!

Evacuate my life, evacuate the afterlife
It's so much worse when you smell
A smell you know so well, even so
This will end.
