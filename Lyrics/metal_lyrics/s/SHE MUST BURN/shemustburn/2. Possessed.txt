Oh darkness bring me dream
Crows of slumber looking over me
The misery of ever leeching purpose,
Cut out from everything he loved
Bound to my body I feel it changing in me,
When will the inner demon be released?
God will do what he must suffice
It's haunting me, take me away
Because it's hurting me
I hear it whisper my name,
Talk to me the same way,
I'd rather you weren't deceased

Breathe in, breathe out
Let go, give up, don't fight this
Breathe in, breathe out, (just) let go
You can't control this

[Chorus:]
Light up my soul, set me on fire
Unhallowed this grave
This mess that you've made
Persuading me how to feel
Take me away from all of this death
Embracing the demon on my shoulder
Even so you murmur my name

You will not take, no you will not take
You will not take me away

Spellbound whimpers erupt from the dark
You can't lace together,
This love that sadness tore apart

I see your face, let me in

Forgive me, for what I have done
Take me away
Can we not be what we were before?

I feel it carving its name on my bones
You won't let me forget
Now that I am his home
Breathe in, breathe out
I can see your eyes fading away
The tears are found in the shadow of leaves
No peace for the living, fuck all for the dead

Falling down from hell again,
Forgetting you all, take me away
Talk to me the same way,
And your blood will hit the wall

[Chorus:]
Light up my soul, set me on fire
Unhallowed this grave
This mess that you've made
Persuading me how to feel
Take me away from all of this death
Embracing the demon on my shoulder
Even so you murmur my name

You will not take, no you will not take
You will not take me away

Even the darkest night will end
The sun will rise again
The restless, the weary, the comfortless,
Will rise again

The dead will rise again
