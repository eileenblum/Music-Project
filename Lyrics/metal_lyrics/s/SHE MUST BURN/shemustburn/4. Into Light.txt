I'll forever be, just an unfinished design
A complication of the heart and mind
My soul is screaming out 'I want desire!'
'I want desire. I want to burn forever in the fire'.
Say it again, say it again, how this is really living?

The best times in my mind,
Are spent in places like this, believe in me
So say it again, I won't let this be. Say it again!

Can you feel it? Almost taste it?
The passion for life, Oh it's burning inside
I want it all, I want it all, I want that fire
We are the fire and embers, burning together
Burning forever,
Fire and embers (fire and embers)
I will always, yes I will always remember.
