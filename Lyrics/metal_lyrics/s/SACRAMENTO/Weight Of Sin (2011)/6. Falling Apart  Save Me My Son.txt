A whisper flows
While wind freezes my face
Sat down my feet get wet
Dry salt draws a smile
Is just a thought bringing life
Messing my mind makes me cry

Push, do you realize the pain
Push, the bladeâs cutting my skin
Stay inside canât let you out
Would you grant me one more chance?

Save me my son
Canât do this alone
If by giving out my life
Will help you from dying
I could close my eyes to open yours

Iâve jumped inside
Opened my eyes
Tried to grab its arm
Disappear again
Reaching out, above
Swimming up
Dragged down

Can you imagine the pain?
The blade is cutting my skin
Stay inside canât let you out
Would you grant me one more chance?

Save me my son
Canât do this alone
If by giving out my life
Will help you from dying
I could close my eyes to open yours
