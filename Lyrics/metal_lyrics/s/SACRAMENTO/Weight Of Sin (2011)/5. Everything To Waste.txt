Clear is the mirror you see yourself
No stains, no cracks, unmarked
Blurred the image you see in it
So dry, so cold, soâ¦
Nothing would ever harm you
One wrong decision could fade everything to black â¦

Wake up, open your eyes
Say now, how this would end
Everything to waste! 

What would you fight for?
It doesnât have to be that way!
Stay asleep and dream forever
Nothing would ever harm you
One wrong decision could fade everything to black â¦

Wake up, open your eyes
Say now, how this would end
Everything to waste!

Wake up, open your eyes
Say now, how this would end
Everything to waste!
Nothing would ever harm you
