Youâd enter to a world
Unknown for all and cold
Feeling alone
Canât find a hand to give you warmth

Not even shadows will be shielding you at home
So lie your head down
Start believing, you are nowâ¦

Take a spin into the world
Mayhem begins to rise
Should I move on or just wait for the next stop

First you had it all
And now
Youâre about to lose it all
Leave it allâ¦

Thereâs no balance in the life you chose for your own
Now that youâre out there
Have realized you have no one.

Take a spin into the world
Mayhem begins to rise
Should I move on or just wait for the next stop
