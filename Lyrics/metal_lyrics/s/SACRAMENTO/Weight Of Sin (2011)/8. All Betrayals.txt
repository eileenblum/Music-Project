Scratching on that soil
Digging out the lie myself
Digging all of my confessions
About honor, a bunch of fools unearthed

No control
To killâs to live
That armor destroys bodies
Once loved now abhorred

Lungs bleeding inside out
Screaming

At bottom now on top
As the winter blows my guilt on your death
Consequences could unfold
All betrayals hidden under your skin

That deceptive truth again
Filling the void we all bear
Has made this burden turns to rage

Against the flow WE RUN!
Pursued by deceit
Like strings pulling marionettes
Rageâs taking over you â¦!

At bottom now on top
As the winter blows my guilt on your death
Consequences could unfold
All betrayals hidden under your skin
