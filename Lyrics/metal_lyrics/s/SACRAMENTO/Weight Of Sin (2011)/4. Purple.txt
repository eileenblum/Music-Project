Rain comes down and walks with me
It becomes my only companion
Not letting me here all alone
It wonât freeze my dying hopes

Open your eyes
And try to realize
They wonât get too blind
To face what lies behind
Then suddenly all turns Purple

Let me here
Let me stay
Sitting by your side
Talking of the past

Open your eyes
And try to realize
They wonât get too blind
To face what lies behind
The loneliest I walk, the stronger Iâve become
Feeling Purple, feeling Purple
Are you there!

I could not say goodbye...
Your voice still sounds in my thoughts
Now that youâre gone
But still here inside
They wonât get too blindâ¦ to face what lies behind
Tainted all Purpleâ¦

Burning Inside, getting too blind
A stronger color making easy a way out!
Making easy a way out!!!!
