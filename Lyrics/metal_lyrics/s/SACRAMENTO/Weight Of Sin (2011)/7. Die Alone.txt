Say how could I be reborn
From all these ashes
Iâll know how to see again
My so wounded soul
From the shadows I will sing
My long affliction
And I wish I could sleep along...

I feel like falling
My voice doesnât tremble
Not afraid to return
To stay and remain
Half dead half alive and
I just want to

Die alone
Through an endless dawn
Die alone
To never come back
Die alone
Iâll remove my skin for a brand new life

I forge myself the fate
What to do to believe
Behind these lights I will relive

I feel like falling
My voice doesnât tremble
Not afraid to return
To stay and remain
Half dead half alive and
I just want to

Die alone
Through an endless dawn
Die alone
To never come back
Die alone
Iâll remove my skin for a brand new life
