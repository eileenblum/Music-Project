Becoming everything I hate
Not standing for the things Iâve prayed before
Illusions kill my faith in you once more
Beware the one that speaks for all

Take me away
Find a place where we can go

Entrance to paradise has been denied
Moonlight disguises betrayal... oh so sweet it is
Can you feel it again?
Hesitate and tremble to temptation
Bounded to this destiny I will fall

Take me away
Find a place where we can go
Take me away
Take me somewhere I belongâ¦.

ââ¦how could I ever forget?
The reason why he brought me here
Now I have to understand â¦
Now I must survive...â

Take me away
Find a place where we can go
Take me away
Take me somewhere I belongâ¦. Now!
