Waking up I saw
Those shadows passing on
I donât like them
They wonât let me live alone!

A thousand hands
Covering my forehead and all
Their stinking breathe
Burns my head makes me throw up it all!

Leave me hollow
Steal all from myself
Blow the oceans
Dry the earth away!!

Waking up I saw
Her shadow passing on
She was not lonely, No!
There were more surrounding me!

A thousand hands
Covering my forehead and all
Their stinking breathe
Burns my head makes me throw up it all!

Leave me hollow
Steal all from myself
Blow the oceans
Dry the earth away!!

Leave me hollow
Steal all from myself
Blow the oceans
Dry the earth away!!
