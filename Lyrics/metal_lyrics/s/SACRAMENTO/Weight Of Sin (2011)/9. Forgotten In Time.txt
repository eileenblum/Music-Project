How the sun burns those black eyes as cold as winter snow
&amp; how the light ...flashes that white skin so damned scarred

Whyâs so hard to make you stand again
Thereâs no will to survive
Come inside my chest and take my heart
Itâs so frail

Falling! Inside the circle of your doubts
Crying! Among the crystal silence
Searching! Above the ocean and the stars
Giving! One caress, then hit back!

Ohâ¦ can you hear them?
Say â¦ if she has one more chance â¦

Whyâs so hard to make you stand again
Thereâs no will to survive
Come inside my chest and take my heart
Itâs so damn frail

Just searching for the clearest spark in the night
Unburying answers forgotten in time
Is silence now who wants to speak?

Falling!
Crying!
Searching!
Giving!
