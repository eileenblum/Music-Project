And I hear these voices
That I canât really explain
They whisper something
They have frozen all my thoughts

Somehow they lead me
To have control no more,
To scream in silence
In the middle / of nowhere

And again they appear
I can hear them stronger now
They are melting memories
See them how they become real

Here in this desert 
Just got sand on my hands
No wind to blow hopes
I canât stay forever here

Seems thereâs no way out
I set my soul to fate,
Get used to this home
And I let the death embrace... you
