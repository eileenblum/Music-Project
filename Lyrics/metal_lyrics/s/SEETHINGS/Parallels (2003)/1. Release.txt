A body moves in front of you
can you tell just who it is?
Somebody pulls the brakes for you
but do you know who that is?

Something acting candid and allowing you to feel

So can you sense the touch upon you making you feel uncomfortable?
And did you catch a glimpse of anger when you couldn't see?

Something acting candid and allowing you to feel another disillusion?
You know it must be real
caught around your hollow surface breathing in and I sense
somebody empty needing emotions that's why I'm here

did you ever think your sorrows could not be released?
And did you feel inadequate when you knew not why that was?

Try to focus straight and then try to settle down
it will come to you and then you know it must be real
caught around your hollow surface breathing in and I sense
somebody empty needing emotions that's why I'm here

seething inside
breathing outside
nearly there and you know someone is always better or worse off then yourself

know you should
but you won't
can't allow to show your feelings
listen in
concentrate
bare your heart and mind for your own sake
and scream!
caught around your hollow surface breathing in and I sense somebody empty
needing emotions that's why I'm here

seething inside
breathing outside
nearly there and you know someone is always better or worse off then yourself
