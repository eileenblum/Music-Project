Perfect minds, sharing perfect views on life
surface lies, ignorance is bliss
impure minds, channelling collective thoughts
awoken truth, parallels of hope

come taste this truth so sweet, change is coming for you if you listen

All empty faces surrounding me, running away from truth
and all faded dreams that come back
parallel in this wait for relief, and it lifts me up, and lifts me up

Poisoned minds, poisoning the chosen ones
witness hope, becoming into dust

come taste this truth so sweet, change is coming for you if you listen

All empty faces surrounding me, running away from truth
and all faded dreams that come back
parallel in this wait for relief, and it lifts me up, and lifts me up, lifts me up, lifts me ..
Lifts me up!

And I try to not put up a front, and I'm trying not to wear a mask
And I try to not put up a front, and I'm trying not to wear a mask
And I try to not put up a front, and I'm trying not to wear a mask
And I try to not put up a front, and I'm trying not to, trying not to, trying
not to wear a mask

this is what I always feared, kind of overwhelming to be in this for real
Why should anybody care?
Sick life wins.
