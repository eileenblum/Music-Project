Confide in me until it's dark
'cause when I close my eyes I drift away
so bear with me for a while

and I said slow, we're moving much too fast
in the city tonightâ¦

If only I hadn't spent my time
looking through my hollow memories
you would have stayed with me for a while

and I said slow, we're moving much too fast
slow, another night has passed in the city tonight!

And the saying goes why? Can I ever trust you tonight? Will I ever stop
asking why? Another night has passed but this day will never end..
As the day breaks, nothing is the same
all the pieces have fallen out of place again
I can't reach you, nothing starts here, and the sun sets to another place in time
Tonight!
And the saying goes why? Can I ever trust you tonight? Will I ever stop asking why? 
Another night has passed away and it's day
