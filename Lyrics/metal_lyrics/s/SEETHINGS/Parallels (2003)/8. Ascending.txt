Here's the words I never spoke, a substitute for all that's worth never thought
that it would turn out all that wrong but â¦
Summer came upon our hearts filled me up and took me home
seconds filled with madness turned into a day or two

The things I knew most, the things I do best
It was the same that was taken from me
It's not a promise if you take it all away

Trying to let it go, time to make up for all that's lost
I'm seeing it differently, I see it in me

Washing off the ink and dust, masking all that scent we shared, bleeding slowly
ends where words  turn into sentences.

All that I knew, all that I did
came to be meaningless in their own way
am I the same now that I have walked away?

Trying to let it go, time to make up for all that's lost
I'm seeing it differently I see it in me
ascending the life I know starting I know
starting it over hands untied I see it's a different me, I see it in me.

I am stronger than I ever was, I can hardly explain, and nothing can take this away
but I still can't shake those words you said

That day a cloud's above me now a night's about to hide a cloud's above me now,
I try to hide

Trying to let it go, time to make up for all that's lost
I'm seeing it differently I see it in me
ascending the life I know starting I know
starting it over hands untied I see it's a different me, I see it in me.

Time to let it go, a cloud's above me now
Time to let it go, I see it in me
