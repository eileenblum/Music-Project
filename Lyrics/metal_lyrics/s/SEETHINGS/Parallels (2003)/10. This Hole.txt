I cannot live in silence, I cannot breathe without a sound, some other life is waiting
hoping for me join in

Time is a tool that's broken, it hasn't helped at all this time
something is missing out of the pleasures of watching me go to waste
cannot continue taunting my soul has bled for oh some time
just give me a reason to say, give me a reason for this hell

What will I leave behind me? A shadow, a trace of nothing?
But you who have felt my presence I hope you will feel a little something
I stare at the future, hoping the life I leave won't be missed inside
just colour my soul, colour my soul

To give life to this
hollow soul in this hole
when I stole time and emotions to be in this
hollow room of energy
it's not right but who can say what to do with it?

Casting a shadow on me, feeling it shrink my very soul
Nothing matters anymore, nothing feels just like before
seconds pass which is my last? Moment of truth will bring me in

giving life to this hollow soul in this hole
when I stole time and emotions to be in this
hollow room of energy
it's not right but who can say what to do with it?
It's bringing me closer, it's pulling me in, It wants me to go
it's pulling me, it's dragging me out of this, out of this hole

I cannot live in silence, time is a tool that's broken, time is a wound that
will not heal,
time is the one to save me, giving me, giving me life to this hole!

To give life to this
hollow soul in this hole
when I stole time and emotions to be in this
hollow room of energy
it's not right but who can say what to do with it?
hollow soul in this hole
when I stole time and emotions to be in this
hollow room of energy
it's not right but who can say?
