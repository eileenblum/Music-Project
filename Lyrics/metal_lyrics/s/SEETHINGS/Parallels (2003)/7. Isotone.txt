I'm right behind you, watching every step that you take, waiting for an honest
word to pass your lips waiting for the unjust sentence
I see it in you something very far from justice something I can taste and smell
and feel and hear even though your darkness blinds me

And you know they all listen when I speak my mind
and you know that is something you can't achieve
So I rise up above your spineless cause
and I wear a pride that you never thought was real

I am all you wish to be 'cause I feel it inside
I will not be checking in as it's in my blood

I know it's in you the jealousy that clouds your judgement, making every thing
you say become hollow, twisted and distorted from truth

And you know they all listen when I speak my mind
and you know that is something you can't achieve
So I rise up above your spineless cause
and I wear a pride that you never thought was real

I am all you wish to be 'cause I feel it inside
I will not be checking in as it's in my blood
I am what you fear the most 'cause I do it well
and I know you feel this too

I absorb your energy it keeps me breathing
I will stand to watch you fall to watch you fall into a state of teething
I adore the sacredness of being stronger
and I lurk behind a smile

I am all you wish to be
I have what you need to steal
and I know you won't succeed
'cause I see things differently
have I not been there for you?
Have I not stood up for you?
Can you ever let it go?
I am me..

I'm right behind you, watching every step that you take.
