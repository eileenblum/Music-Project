I take the blame, as you fall down! It's just because I know what's awaiting me
I let it go since life's unfair! It's undeniable that I am here to please you

Hide behind me, don't show that you are vulnerable
please feed off me now that I know I'm good for nothing
Reside in weakness, the bottom feels so shallow now
roam this landscape that you call yours

I know I've tried to make things right, it's simply for the sake of
tranquillity
Let's put this straight I've tried and I've tried, but despite my efforts to
resolve this here you complain

Hide behind me, don't show that you are vulnerable
please feed off me now that I know I'm good for nothing
Reside in weakness, the bottom feels so shallow now
roam this landscape that you call yours

I step aside, to watch your joy, that's one in a million things I love
I've said enough, I know what is good for you
I let it pass just like the rain, inside this aura where I feel safe
I've done enough to make you good for me
good for me â¦

You can never let things pass, it's always there right in front of you
can you ever let me in? And see I'm your saviorâ¦

Hide behind me, don't show that you are vulnerable
please feed off me now that I know I'm good for nothing
Reside in weakness, the bottom feels so shallow now
roam this landscape that you call yours

You can never let things pass
can never let it go
you can never let things pass
good for nothing
You can never let things pass
can never let it go
you can never let things pass
