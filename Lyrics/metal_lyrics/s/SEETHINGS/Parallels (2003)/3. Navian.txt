Sign me in, put me out, It's driving me insane to be in here
Check my pulse, read my stats, I'm turning into stone inside of here
'cause every little breath I take, you exhale
and every little step I take, you won't follow
and every little move I make sends you further away

Grant me some peace inside of here, before I tear my eyes out
bleeding inside what's it to you?

You are not! Worth a shit! Navian!
Things will flow if you cooperate
Lock me up! Beat me down! Navian!
You will never see the light of day

Seen it come, seen it go, and in the end it will disappear
everlasting sense of quality see it resides inside of me
'cause every little noise I make, you say no
and every little chance I take you retire
and every little move I make sends you further away

Grant me some peace inside of here, before I tear my eyes out
bleeding inside, what's it to you?

You are not! Worth a shit! Navian!
Things will flow if you cooperate
Lock me up! Beat me down! Navian!
You will never see the light ofâ¦
See me, I am here and I'm real, I deserve some peace of mind
Take me, I'm dying in my sleep, I am solely complete

No more promises! Bullshit lies don't mean much to me
No more travesties! I am here can you undertake?
