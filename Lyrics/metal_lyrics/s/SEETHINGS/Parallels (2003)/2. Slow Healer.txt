Slow healer
The world outside here burns when I'm not around
Wound receiver
could you be so kind as to let me In?
I feel cold as if it died ( you just don't think you can smile)
I am me but not the same (like you know? You've forgotten)
is it me or is it life?
My surroundings shape me
you say it best you say it right
right in front of me

Did you ever feel it go down on you?
Could you ever taste that world alone?
I know I never got that far this is true
suppose I would fail?

Warmth inside
could it be from thinking about life?
Silence stops me
from finishing what I set out to be
I've seen things behind my eyes (which you couldn't do without)
I have let it all pass by (that's what  you think? Look closer)
through the years that's passed me by
I have told myself to try
you say it best you say it right
right in front of me

Did you ever feel it go down on you?
Could you ever taste that world alone?
I know I never got that far this is true
suppose I would fail?
It's far enough for me now, I don't think so
I can let it go now, not a chance
I'm healing awfully quickly now, this is true
Suppose I would fail?

No I never listened your words are all beyond me and I know what's true
Come with me together, we'll ride it out forever to find out why
you can never see it if it's right behind you, you can never feel a thing
won't think about the future, the past is still the present
seething in the airâ¦

I'm calling in the sadness, shouting out to weakness, trying to summon all at once
I'm challenging emotions, questioning devotion; destined to bring it back to life
I'm calling in the sadness, shouting out to weakness, trying to summon all at once
I'm challenging emotions, questioning devotion if you're doubting me!

Did you ever feel it go down on you?
Could you ever taste that world alone?
I know I never got that far this is true
suppose I would fail?
It's far enough for me now, I don't think so
I can let it go now, not a chance
I'm healing awfully quickly now, this is true
Suppose that I failed?
