Calm like the ripples in the water, as the clouds above we shape and
reform put aside that pride within you, attach the silence to your past,
attach the rhythm to your mind

Fire, let me taste desire!

Star
ever glowing high above us, like the rain we pass on by and
return try to seek out ways to confide, attach the silence to your past, attach
the rhythm to your mind

Fire, let me taste desire!
Come
nothing's in the way follow me today to another place and find the unfound
carrying away
burden left astray time is never here

Illuminate me, I'm trying to figure out
ways to confide I'm blinded by this so illuminate me
and make me see things are not what they seem, I can't bare this no

More
hollow smiles on hollow faces, as the curtain drops they fade and
retreat, suck it up and turn the left cheek, attach the silence to your past,
attach the rhythm to your mind

Fire, let me taste desire!
Come
nothing's in the way follow me today to another place and find the unfound
carrying away
burden left astray time is never here

Illuminate me, I'm trying to figure out
ways to confide I'm blinded by this so illuminate me
and make me see things are not what they seem, I can't bare this
Illuminate me, I'm trying to figure out
ways to confide I'm blinded by this so illuminate me
and make me see things are not what they seem, I can't bare this no more

suck it up and turn the left cheek, attach the madness to your mind release the
reason in your soul!

Illuminate me, I'm trying to figure out
ways to confide I'm blinded by this so illuminate me
and make me see things are not what they seem, I can't bare this
Illuminate me, I'm trying to figure out
ways to confide I'm blinded by this so illuminate me
and make me see things are not what they seem, I can't bare this
Illuminate me, I'm trying to figure out
ways to confide I'm blinded by this so illuminate me
and make me see things are not what they seem, I can't bare this no more

I will not lay down, I am strong enough to hold
I will not lay down.
