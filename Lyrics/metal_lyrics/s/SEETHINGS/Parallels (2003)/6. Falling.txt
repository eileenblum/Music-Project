If i Hold my hands in front I can distort the truth But deep inside I know
I cannot hide for long this sideshow can't go on I'm hoping I am wrong
Without you I am lost but with you I forget

Locking myself away
will open the door some other day
Nothing in here is painless
I keep pushing myself away

It's in me, I know it this time
and It's me that crossed all those lines
I cannot help myself from falling this time

In light of what I know I sense I can't go through another day like this
The silence turns me off I have to make a sound to know I am alive
Without you I am lost but with you I forget

Locking myself away
will open the door some other day
Nothing in here is painless
I keep pushing myself away

It's in me, I know it this time
and It's me that crossed all those lines
I cannot help myself from falling this time
and It's me I know it this time
and it's me to cross all those lines
I cannot help myself from falling this time
and It's me I know it this time
and it's me to cross all those lines
I cannot help myself from falling this time

And I felt myself fall down
fell so far I hit the ground
Could I have prevented this?
I will never know for sure
I have said it once before
That I have to let things go
But if this is how it feels
I cannot hold on for long
I guess it could have been these thoughts
The very cause for me to fall
But I have not forsaken, not forgotten, not forsaken, not forgotten
â¦ this fall

Cold heart, cold mind inside of this cold life, cold night surrounding this
cold heart, cold mind I know it was cold life, cold night that left me no
choice..
