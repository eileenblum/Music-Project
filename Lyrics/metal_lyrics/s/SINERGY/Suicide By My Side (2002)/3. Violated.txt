You've come to me with your tears
But I just walk away in anger
I won't forget the years I lost
You took away my youth

You seek forgiveness from me
I close my eyes and pretend you're not here
I've moved one. I'm not afraid of you
I know you're weak

I'm here to tell you - you'll never own me
I will refuse you and laugh as you cry
You've violated but now I'm stronger
I take my life back and watch as you fall

Your time will come, so be wanted
I will be back for retribution
Your screams will help me fall asleep at night
And live through the day

I'm here to tell you - you'll never own me
I will refuse you and laugh as you cry
You've violated but now I'm stronger
I take my life back and watch as you fall

I've say goodbye to the pain
Your presence here cannot destroy me
You can try, but I will stand up
When you knock me down

I'm here to tell you - you'll never own me
I will refuse you and laugh as you cry
You've violated but now I'm stronger
I take my life back...

I'm here to tell you - you'll never own me
I will refuse you and laugh as you cry
You've violated but now I'm stronger
I take my life back and watch as you fall
