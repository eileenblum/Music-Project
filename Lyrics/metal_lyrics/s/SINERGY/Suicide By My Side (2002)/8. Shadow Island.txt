["Drakkar Anni":]
We are servants of the night
Stalkers, hunters, miscreants
Creatures of a black domain
Sleepless, sunless revenants

["Alan Morton":]
I will defy the separation
Of darkness and light, this I swear
Fuse them together, unite them as one
Power is mine!

["Aline Cedrac":]
Playing with fire, you're end up burning
Consequence for your mistake

["Drakkar Anni":]
We fear the day for the sun
Await the dusk, sacrifice
We roam the earth, take the flesh
Dwelling among Satan's lair

["Aline Cedrac":]
When darkness falls
They appear to blind eyes
When the shadows wake, silence breaks
We stand helpless

["Alan Morton":]
Death! I have brought death to light
Hell! Welcome to hell my dear

["Aline Cedrac":]
Fall! Your fallen fall from grace
Look what you've done

["Alan Morton":]
Come! Join me in damnation

["Aline Cedrac":]
No! I will not follow you!

["Alan Morton":]
Night will overwhelm us

["Drakkar Anni":]
Alone in the dark!

["Drakkar Anni":]
We are servants of the night
Stalkers, hunters, miscreants
Creatures of a black domain
Sleepless, sunless revenants

["Alan Morton":]
I hold the key to all that is evil
Crossing the gates into hell
I'm the creator, I'm the enforcer
You shall obey!

["Aline Cedrac":]
When darkness falls
They appear to blind eyes
When the shadows wake, silence breaks
We stand helpless
