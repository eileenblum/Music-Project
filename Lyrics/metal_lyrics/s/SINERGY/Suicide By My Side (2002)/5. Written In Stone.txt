I dwell on the times I've had
I can't seem to leave the past
I've lost who I am inside
My spirit has long since died

My eyes, they no longer see
My ears, they don't hear a sound
My lips, they have lost the taste
My hands, they no longer feel

Broken and torn am I withered and worm through time
So where do I go from here? Continue to breathe this fear?

Your eyes, never see me grieve
Your ears, never hear my cries
Your lips, never speak the truth
Your hands, never hold me tight

This isn't living, I'm only existing
I refuse to stay here and continue to live out this lie
So I shatter the hourglass, hoping my time will pass
Because I'll only be noticed when my name is written in stone

My soul is made of glass
Weakened from sorrows past
I've lost all the will to try
So I slowly wait to die

How long should I will regret? Why me? I have paid my dues
So lost, how can I be found? I wish time would heal my wounds

This isn't living, I'm only existing
I refuse to stay here and continue to live out this lie
So I shatter the hourglass, hoping my time will pass
Because I'll only be noticed when my name is written in stone

This isn't living, I'm only existing
I refuse to stay here and continue to live out this lie
So I shatter the hourglass, hoping my time will pass
Because I'll only be noticed when my name is written in stone
