Vengeance piercing through my heart
As I watch you kiss the dirt
And make you swallow your betrayal and sin
Though for now I say farewell
But one day I will return with a smile
As I spit on your grave!

I'm sick... tired of this abuse
I've played the fool for many years
Escape... shelter me from harm

Your lies... pushed me to the edge
I've finally reached my breaking point
Come here... meet your Nemesis

Vengeance piercing through my heart
As I watch you kiss the dirt
And make you swallow your betrayal and sin
Though for now I say farewell
But one day I will return with a smile
As I spit on your grave!

Taste this... swift thrust of my blade
It's laced with poison from my veins
Lay there... helpless and afraid

You bleed... I gaze with a grin
A taste of your own medicine
Your tears... please the beast within

Vengeance piercing through my heart
As I watch you kiss the dirt
And make you swallow your betrayal and sin
Though for now I say farewell
But one day I will return with a smile
As I spit on your grave!

Yes, right now I say farewell
But one day I will return with a smile
As I spit on your grave!
