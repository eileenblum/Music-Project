[Bonus Track]

This bloody road remains a mystery.
This sudden darkness fills the air.
What are we waiting for?
Won't anybody help us
What are we waiting for?
We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy.
It's a do or die situation - we will be invincible.

This shattered dream you cannot justify.
We're gonna scream until we're satisfied.
What are we running for?
We've got the right to be angry.
What are we running for when there's nowhere we can run to anymore?
We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy.
It's a do or die situation - we will be invincible.
And with the power of conviction there is no sacrifice.
It's a do or die situation - we will be invincible.

Won't anybody help us?
What are we running for when there's nowhere

Nowhere we can run to anymore?
We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy.
It's a do or die situation - we will be invincible.
And with the power of conviction there is no sacrifice.
It's a do or die situation - we will be invincible.

We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy.
It's a do or die situation - we will be invincible.
We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy.
It's a do or die situation - we will be invincible.
