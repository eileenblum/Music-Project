I've runaway once again
But this time it's forever
I'm going back to the one place
That I can call home

Every where I turn I find another dead end
So I crash and burn, just start all over again

Fourth world I am on my way
Let me fly beyond your gates
You're my last hope for escape
Grant me passage, give me freedom

I long to be where the stars in the sky are my footsteps
Where every cloud is a stair leading closer to you
Why died I leave you at all, can you see when it brought me?
I'm so ashamed of the path I have taken in my life

Fourth world I am on my way
Let me fly beyond your gates
You're my last hope for escape
Grant me passage, give me freedom

I can feel you in my veins
One step closer to your fortress

Fourth world I am on my way
Let me fly beyond your gates
You're my last hope for escape
Grant me passage, give me freedom
