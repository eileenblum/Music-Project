When I look into the mirror, what is it I see?
Reflection of my greatest enemy

When I listen to myself speak, was is it I hear?
Sounds of hatred, wasting all these years

Let me die before I wake
Living life was my mistake

Will this feeling ever end?
Loneliness, my only friend
Must be something I have done
It feels like I'm the only one

Who am I, what have I become? I don't recognize
I am everything that I despise

Let me die before I wake
Living life was my mistake

Lost the war inside my head
The strenght inside has met its death

Let me die before I wake
Living life was my mistake

Will this feeling ever end?
Loneliness, my only friend
Must be something I have done
It feels like I'm the only one

Me, myself, my enemy...
