Chaos is my wake up call
Another day of suffering
Waste time staring at the wall
Nowhere to go, no one to see

So many voices are stalking my mind
I can't sleep because they're screaming at me
I can feel eyes that are staring at me
Even though there is nobody here

I'm afraid to go outside
I don't want to face reality
I'm so paranoid inside
It seems like I'll forever be

I'm terrified, dead inside
If I'm dreaming, someone wake me
They've haunted me secretly, all my life
When I'm alone, uncontrolled
Madness leads my every movement
It's killing me, can't you see? I'm insane

Hate myself my everyday
I don't want to live to see the night
If my thoughts don't kill me first
I'm doing to end it with a knife

So many voices are stalking my mind
I can't sleep because they're screaming at me
I can feel eyes that are staring at me
Even though there is nobody here

I'm terrified, dead inside
If I'm dreaming, someone wake me
They've haunted me secretly, all my life
When I'm alone, uncontrolled
Madness leads my every movement
It's killing me, can't you see? I'm insane
