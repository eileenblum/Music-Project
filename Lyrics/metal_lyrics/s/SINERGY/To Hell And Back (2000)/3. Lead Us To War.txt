[Lyrics: Goss]

Lead us to war... ...war!
return home because war's where
the heart is
lead us to war... ...war!
a procession fallen into submission

Black skies surround everyday
there's no sign of the light that once
embraced us
Time is our enemy now
without warning it carries us far away
dig deeper intot his hole
falling faster and leaving
ourselves to blame
shackles of death hold us down
use the anger inside to keep us war

A violent struggle to break free
soon there will be some hell to pay
we've had enough, so let us be
we want to see the light of day

Lead us to war... ...war!
return home because war's where
the heart is
lead us to war... ...war!
a procession fallen into submission

Dementia slowly sets in
we lay lifeless, allowing it to grasp us
eating away at our souls
one by one, growing weaker every
moment
the end approaching so near
now at last we seek comfoft
in our madness
the night encompassed by silence
we have sunk to the bottom
of this nightmare!

A violent struggle to break freee
soon there will be some hell to pay
we've had enough, so let us be
we want to see the light of day

Lead us to war... ...war!
return home because war's where
the heart is
lead us to war... ...war!
a procession fallen into submission
