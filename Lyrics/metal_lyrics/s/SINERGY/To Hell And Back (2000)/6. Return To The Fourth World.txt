[Music: Laiho, Hietala]
[Lyrics: Goss]

I've been stopped at the crossroads
in danger of losing my way
there is only one answer
return to the fourth world

I am lost in reality
I have fallen off destiny's path
and i stumble upon the key
to open the fourth world

Beyond the deepest corner of my
mind
I unlock the hidden gate
and find myself back home
divine hallucinations come to life
I'm living out my dreams
right here in paradise

I've been stopped at the crossroads
in danger of losing my way
there is only one answer
return to the fourth world

I have found my reality
now I'm back on destiny's path
and I have returned
I'm here in the fourth world

You are the light that guides me
through
this world of darkness and despair
take me away and set me free
to where the night sky is my ground

Beyond the deepest corner of my
mind I unlock the hidden gate
and find myself back home
divine hallucinations come to life
I'm living out my dreams
right here in paradise

[SOLO 1 : Laiho]
[SOLO 2 : Latvala]

I levitate back to the world I know
where delirium counts for sanity
and I've been away for far too long
fourth world I am here to stay

Beyond the hidden corner of my mind
I unlock the hidden gate
and find myself back home
divine hallucinations come to life
I'm living out my dreams
right here in paradise
