[Music: Goss]
[Lyrics: Goss]

I lay down on snow covered sheets of
loneliness
and I weep, I'm crying out for you
I'm longing just to have one more
chance

And right now...

...My hands are reaching out to you
I stand here frozen with fear
my heart is shattering in two
please don't leave me here to live
alone
my world is grey without you
I am so lost, no where to go

Alone... I'm filled emptiness
alone... I call your name
alone... no hope remains
and alone I bid farewell
so long... I end my emptiness
so long... no name to call
so long... no need for hope
and so long, I leave this life

[SOLO : Laiho]

lay me down, this is my final resting
place
I have failed, I let you down my dear
this shame overwhelming inside of me

so goodbye...

...I have to leave my world behind
I've fallen too many times
can't take rejection anymore
now it's time to meet my destiny
I wont' be missed anyway
I'll fall into serenity

Alone... I'm filled emptiness
alone... I call your name
alone... no hope remains
and alone I bid farewell
so long... I end my emptiness
so long... no name to call
so long... no need for hope
and so long, I leave this life

[SOLO : Laiho]

Alone... I'm filled emptiness
alone... I call your name
alone... no hope remains
and alone I bid farewell
so long... I end my emptiness
so long... no name to call
so long... no need for hope
and so long, I leave this life

Goodbye...
