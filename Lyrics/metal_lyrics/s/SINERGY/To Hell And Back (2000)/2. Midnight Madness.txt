[Music: Laiho, Hietala, Goss]
[Lyrics: Goss]

Fullmoon staring at me tonight
time to feed my evil appetite
live or die at the strike of midnight
the choice is yours,
but you're running out of time

I have the touch everybody fears
my skin is poison ivy
I have the look that'll hypnotize
my eyes are lit with fire

My thirst grows stronger each night
no where to hide, I'll sense your
presence
near
this hatred burning so bright
I'll cum just to watch you drown in
fear

My wicked laughter brings you
to fall upon your knees
your anguish is relief to me
it is the fix that I need
I am a fiend for torture
I'm craving your demise
now that the clock has struck
midnight
this is the point of no return!

[SOLO 1: Latvala]
[SOLO 2: Laiho]
[SOLO 3: Laiho]
I have the touch everybody fears
my skin is poison ivy
I have the look that'll hypnotize
my eyes are lit with fire

I have you in my control
time to do exactly what I say
prepare to take your last breath
under my spell you'll suffer for you
sins

My wicked laughter bring you
to fall upon your knees
your anguish is relief to me
it is the fix that I need
I am a fiend for torture
I'm craving your demise
now that the clock has struck
midnight
this is the point of no return!
