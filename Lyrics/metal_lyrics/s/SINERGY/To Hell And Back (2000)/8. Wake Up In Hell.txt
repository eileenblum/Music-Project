[Music: Goss, Laiho, Lillman]
[Lyrics: Goss]

I can't go on
each second lasts forever
I stand motionless in sorrow
this must be the end
drown in waters black beneath me
I see nothing here but failure
though I still pretend

What am I suppose to do?
carry on or lose my will?

I've seen what hell is like
and you have put me here
this pain inside never ends for me
I cry myself to sleep
and when I wake I think
what am I living for?

[SOLO : Latvala]

Just when things are looking brighter
I get set back even further
back and forth, just try again
shame, the feeling that surrounds me
when I'm losing all control of
who I am and what I know
What am I suppose to do?
carry on or lose my will?

I've seen what hell is like
and you hve put me here
this pain inside never ends for me
I cry myself to sleep
and when I wake I think
what am I living for?

[SOLO : Laiho]

What am I suppose to do?
carry on or lose my will?

I've seen what hell is like
and you have put me here
this pain inside never ends for me
I cry myself to sleep
and when I wake I think
what am I living for?....
