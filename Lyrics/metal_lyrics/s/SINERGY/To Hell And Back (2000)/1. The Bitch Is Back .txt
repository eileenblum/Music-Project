[Music: Laiho]
[Lyrics: Goss]

Once upon a time there was a harlot
who had taken all she could
just one wrong look from a stranger
finally pushed her straight over the
edge!

Beware the angel of death
don't let her fool you
she is evil!
hear my warning
the bitch is back to show you
what she's made of!

She's known as the mistress of
mischief
the queen of the damned
rage flows through her veins and
pumps the blood of hate inside her

You will be the first of many victims
that she plans to terminate
she has chosen execution style
as the path to meet you fate

Just the beginning
of terror in the heartland
she is dangerous!
hearing voices
sadistic messages from
satan's minions!
She's known as the mistress of
mischief
the queen of the damned
rage flows through her veins and
pumps the blood of hate inside her
eyes of violet so hypnotic
just one look is blinding
her lips have been laced with venom
just one taste is deadly!

[SOLO 1: Laiho]
[SOLO 2: Laiho]

To her you are a waste of human life
and should not be allowed to live
murder is the drug she feeds upon
to satisfy her tainted needs!

She's known as the mistress of
mischief
the queen of the damned
rage flows through her veins and
pumps the blood of hate inside her
eyes of violet so hypnotic
just one look is blinding
her lips have been laced with venom
just one taste is deadly!
