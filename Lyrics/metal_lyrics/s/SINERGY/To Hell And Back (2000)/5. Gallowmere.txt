[Music: Laiho]
[Lyrics: Goss]

I have come to claim my throne again
seek revenge on you Sir Fortesque
though my army is beyond the grave
I shall cast a spell and watch them
rise

I call upon them to return
break from your graves unholy ones!

My name is Zarok the sorcerer
I just want to take back what's mine
lead my militia to overthrow this realm
you have intruded on sacred ground
you are blind to all it posesses
unaware of the magic it beholds

I have been TO HELL AND now I'm BACK
I will show no mercy, so beware!
may the demonds fallbefore you now
like the wheat before the sharpened scythe

You may have won the battle now
but I shall surely win the war!

My name is Zarok the sorcerer
I just want to take back what's mine
lead my militia to overthrow this realm
you have intruded on sacred ground
you are blind to all it posesses
unaware of the magic it beholds

[SOLO 1: Laiho]
[SOLO 2: Latvala]

You have been defeated, cast aside
this is my domain so don't return
I have achieved immortality
thanks to you beloved Gallowmere

Now on to take over the world
this time my mission will succeed!

My name is Zarok the sorcerer
I just want to take back what's mine
lead my militia to overthrow this realm
you have intruded on sacred ground
you are blind to all it posesses
unaware of the magic it beholds

My name is Zarok the sorcerer
I just want to take back what's mine
lead my militia to overthrow this realm
you have intruded on sacred ground
you are blind to all it posesses
unaware of the magic it beholds
