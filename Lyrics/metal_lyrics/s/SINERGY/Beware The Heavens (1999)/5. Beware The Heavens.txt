All is calm on the western front
civilian dreams fill the mornig breeze
listen closely, hear the prophecy
pretenders preaching, it's time to flee!

Hypnotic sermon striking naive minds
a congreation awaits command 
the mask unveiled now they realize
armageddon has seized the land!

October twillight setting in
Reborn into a new reality

Deciever of beliefs
believer of deceits
Beware the heavens 

[SOLO: Laiho]

Nothing remains of the western front
civillian dreams vanished over night
the mask unveiled now they realize 
armaggeddon has seized the land!

[SOLO: Laiho]

October twillight setting in
Reborn into a new reality

Deciever of beliefs
believer of deceits
Beware the heavens
