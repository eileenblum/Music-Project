Fantastic! Galactic! Dominion!

Beyond the sacred realm of common thought
lies a paradise, wicked to those of the light,
yet home to fallen angels forgotten and lost
in an empire of nothingness,
and without a trace of their kind

There is a passage I've found
a gateway through the clouds
fantasia one step away
to the fourth world, here we come!

An enchanted, entrancing, communion

A fantastic, galactic, dominion

Sensations slowly awaken
inside this fairytail dream
Feel rays of the sun from both sides
inhale aromas so sweet

Close your eyes to the outside and
look to the wishes which linger
on in your heart, here you can make them come true
A dimension unlike any other
a spellbinding whirlwind
of ecstasy, fulfilling your every desire

There is a passage I've found
a gateway through the clouds
fantasia one step away
to the fourth world, here we come!

A kingdom seldomly seen
visited by the elite
imaginations alive
in the fourth world here we are!

Endure the splendour within
where echoes never end
your beauty captures the eye
forever fourth world you are mine!
