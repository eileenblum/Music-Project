For what once was a dream
you have made reality
this evening our passion
will end in blood

Release through my blade
the sweetest red potion
only your veins posses

Drink of the wine
feel intense sensations
sweet red divine
fiery temptation tonight

I pierce the skin of thee
rejoice with the pain
and uniting in our sorrow
Burning obsession
pouring out like the rain
this salvation I desire
As the taste strokes my tongue
thawed is the frozen past
sweeping over me

Your scars a memory of my affection
the deeper the wound
the fonder my love

I pierce the skin of thee
rejoice with the pain
and uniting in our sorrow
Burning obsession
pouring out like the rain
this salvation I desire

I pierce the skin of thee
rejoice with the pain
and uniting in our sorrow
Burning obsession
pouring out like the rain
this salvation I desire
