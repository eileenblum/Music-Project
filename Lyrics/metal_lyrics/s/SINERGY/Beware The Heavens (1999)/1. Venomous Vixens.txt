I feel the hatred burning bright
In her black eyes using her enemies for fuel
I see scorn glitters in the grey eyes
of the spiteful one, contemptuous and cruel

What will become of this ill-natured poisonous pair?
See if you dare...

Their on the run, taking revenge on the world
Out to destroy, those daring to crosstheir path
No turning back, their reign of terror goes on!

Compared with these lolitas, every man is a fool
and the world is now honored that they dare to rule

Each victim begging for their mercy
as their mortal life is wasting away

Sooner or later this rampage will come to an end
Or has it just begun?

Their on the run, taking revenge on the world
Out to destroy, those daring to cross their path
No turning back, their reign of terror goes on!

Bow down, worship the queens of vengeance and fury
She-demons in latex taking pleasure form your agony
