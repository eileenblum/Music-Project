Daylight fading
dusk awaiting
swallowing my lucidness

Hell on earth
dreams turned to nightmares
petrified of existence

I see the shadows
even though there
is nobody else around

Take these memories
from me and place them
never to be found

I've been left here in ruins
no one listening to my plea
Can't escape the intrusion
swarmed with anguish and frailty

Can't I break free?
Drowning into hopelessness
Let me believe
in stability's caress
Torment I breathe
suffocating willfully
Cascading deep
this mirage I need

When the lights turn out
hallucination is my only friend
Heading down into a slumber
hoping I will meet my end

I've been left here in ruins
no one listening to my plea
Can't escape the intrusion
swarmed with anguish and frailty

Can't I break free?
Drowning into hopelessness
Let me believe
in stability's caress

Torment I breathe
suffocating willfully
Cascading deep
this mirage I need
