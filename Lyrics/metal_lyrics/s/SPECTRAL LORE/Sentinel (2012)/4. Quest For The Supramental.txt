This barren desert landscape, 
I must transform within my heart into a lush forest. 
But, I shall not bathe in its streams, caressed by its whispers. 
I shall breathe its air and cross in-between it. 

Man is something to be surpassed. 
Born of struggle, composed to overcome. 
Why not desire to break the circle of renewal? 
Not by leap of faith, but courageous vision. Integral and pure. 

I look for a truth that is whole. Indifferent of vantage point. Beyond the Ideas. 
That I shall feel within the crux of my essence. 
Draw me towards the point of utmost complexity. Of unlimited consciousness.
