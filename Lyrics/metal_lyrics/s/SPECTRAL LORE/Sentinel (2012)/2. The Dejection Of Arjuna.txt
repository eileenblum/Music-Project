"Seeing these my own people, arrayed for battle, 
my limbs collapse and my mouth is parched. 

I do not see any good in slaying them 
nor I desire victory, kingdom, or pleasures. 
Although these, with a consciousness clouded with greed 
see no guilt in the destruction of the family 
why should not we have the wisdom to draw back, O Jardana?" 

"That which really is, cannot go out of existence, 
just as that which is non-existent cannot come into being. 
The enlightened man mourns neither for the living or for the dead. 

One whose intelligence has attained to unity, 
casts away both good and evil works. 
Make grief and happiness, loss and gain, victory and defeat 
equal in thy soul and then turn to battle, O Bharata!" 

"If thou boldest the intelligence to be greater than works, 
why then dost thou appoint me to a terrible work?" 

"Not by abstention from works does a man enjoy actionlessness, nor by renounciation. 
He who controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, 
without attachment engages with the organs of action, he excels. 

Hearken, O mighty-armed, to my word, that I will speak to thee from my will 
for thy soul's good, now that thy heart is taking delight in me. 

I, O Gudakesha, am the Self, which abides within all beings. 
By Me, all this universe has been extended in the ineffable mystery of being; 
All existences are situated in Me, not I in them. 

Work done as a sacrifice fosters Me, who give you back fulfillment. 
Being absorbed in thoughts of Me, one experiences bliss. 
To those who are devoted, I give them the understanding by which they come to Me. 

Therefore, looking to thine own law of action thou shouldst not tremble; 
there is no greater good for the Kshatriya than righteous battle. 
Do not yield to unmanliness, O son of PrithÃ¢. It does not become you. 
Shake off faint-heartnedness and arise, O scorcher of enemies!" 

[compiled and re-arranged from the Bhagavad Gita as interpreted by Sri Aurobindo.]
