Now that I am finally faced towards the infinite, 
I feel I must sternly weight the components of my soul 
these shimmering gems I guarded vigorously as relics 
are they as real as the daylight's lukewarm smile upon existance? 

No embrace ever unconditional is, but kindled by the fire of capacity. 
The soul must endure for it, lest it be devoured by the Mouth of Judgement. 
Ordeals of pain and courage. 

I carry my offering through a dusty and worn road, 
marked by the endless procession of the wretched. 
Towards a ray of light, flickering fraily inbetween the blackness of doubt. 
It leads out of this cosmos, pointing into the abode of the heavens. 

Round and spherical in form, alive with divine intelligences 
complete their orbits with marvelous swiftness, 
emitting each a partial tone conjuncting into a total harmony. 
As a spindle their rims are woven together. 

I enter through a pearly gate to a mighty palace. 

"Of what essence art thou and what gift have thou brought to us?" 

"Of the essence of Star Dust I am, and I bring you Virtue, Duty, and Creation. 
I do not look at matter as plain, but unfold its essence towards the above. 
I do not look at life as disjointed, but as a web of cells in motion." 

"You are the Enlighted Templar 
You are the Guardian of Atlantis 
Deep within you lies the World. 
You shall remain for Ever."
