The weight of the World
Is crushing down
Everything to the core.

Despotically it protects
From straying into the void
Despotically it commands
For omnipresent strength.

I have fallen
From the weight of the world
And I am being pulled down
Towards the center of being.

It is as if Matter
Wants to hold itself together
In vain, against the cold estrangement
Of continuous expansion.

I rise to claim my Identity
Against the grind of amorphous clay
Pushing the soil down
Destroying the Rock with my fists
To see the Light of Day

~

Born to the world of Wonder
Of endless promise and finite, abrupt reality
With dreams directed towards the Higher dimensions
Inbetween deceptive phenomena and elusive noumena

The navel of Motherly love must be cut
To escape the inevitable demise
From the blazing hands of the Father

Without wanton belief and asuredness
The path to the gateway of cosmos
Is a small ray, deep throughout the inmensurable darkness.
