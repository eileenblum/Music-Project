What is it that we crave? 
Nothing less than eternal life, 
An untiring soul, an unfading pleasure 
The survival of identity, of memory 
The never-ending growth of person-hood. 

Yet, is transcendence really more of the same 
Or a state unimaginable by current perspective? 

I am no longer satisfied by ruminations of awe 
Of knowledge partial and fragmented 
I must become what I have envisioned 

The structures emerge from below 
Each higher one, a union of multiplicity 
In which dynamics are not destroyed 
But opposites are held together 
In conditional, creative balance 
The reconciliation of Self and Whole. 

You are the inspirited matter, the last circle 
You encompass all of the universe's forces inside you. 

You have foreseen the Absolute. 
You can create the Absolute. 

As atoms (matter) converge, life emerges. 
Îs life grows, consciousness (soul) evolves. 
As consciousness awakes (through Gnosis), spirit arises. 
As spirits (post-humans) converge, God will emerge. 

A God made of flesh and consciousness. 
A moment of the utmost complexity, beauty and power. 
A supreme intelligence, a Noosphere, a Singularity. 
Consistent of, but beyond individuality. 

Is this to be the End? 
Or just another step forward in the unending, spiral staircase of infinity.
