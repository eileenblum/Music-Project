Man's soul is an enigma. 
A part of the cosmos, yet so different to it. 

An eye that looks beyond the flesh 
A mind that creates a new dimension, 
That of forms and ideas. 

What is more natural, 
Than to walk even further 
On the uphill path 
That led us here. 

Wisdom soars through the ages 
The eye that sees the world as it is 
Made from it, yet not of it 
Owned by no one, it binds us as one 
Unveiling the eternal threads that connect us. 

The inner truth, beyond what is experienced, 
Is an object to behold, yet not an object in itself, 
But the relation in-between, the shadow and the sun, 
The word and the meaning, one being and another, 
The direction of the universe's flow. 
Î¤hrough Gnosis it is brought back into life, 
A cycle complete. 

Oh Godess, lead me into your heart 
Let me bring you pregnant light 
Let it descend through the heavens then again, 
To lay on the fertile seed of the future. 

Earth and Space. 
Body and Consciousness. 
Eros and Logos. 
Man and Culture. 
Parts and Whole. 

Emerging, all-encompassing, concentric circles. 

Show me these moments 
When the layers converge 
And inspiration forms. 

The right order for the path to the stars. 

Humanity needs a purpose that is outside of her. 
The mind flies away, out of this planet, 
Into far away galaxies, into timeless domains. 
What is our part in the greater scheme of it all? 

I yearn for transformation.
