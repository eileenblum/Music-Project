Worn down by the frantic stillness of modernity 
The soul yearns for desire 
One that is slowly fading, beneath the loss of meaning. 

So complex, conflicting, the wants of man 
The pleasures of flesh, nature's decree 

No less than the longing of the spirit 
For everything that is out of the world 

For that which destroys the predictability of this world 
For that which unchains the eternal laws, which prohibit 
eternity and infinity. 

These notions, existing only in the human mind, 
Rise above the programmed, unfolding matter of the cosmos 
Yet, they still emerge out of the flesh, dependent, 
And cease a moment after it fails. 

Are we truly then, a part of this world 
Or are we, the Children of Matter, 
Perishing aimlessly, by the hand of our own parent 
Their wondrous plane destroyed again and again 
For it is desire, not observation, that the soul is eternal 

Rationality speaks to my ego 
To battle with death, to hate the frail flesh 
To aim for the transfiguration of my being 
To conquer eternity and infinity 

The Cosmos speaks to my soul 
To embrace body and love, to be a sentinel of life 
And willingly join with All, in eternity and infinity 
Renouncing identity and person-hood 

Can these perspectives be reconciled? 
When every action sways towards one or the other 
Or is it self-deceit to search for a middle path?
