Aristoteles through the eye of Averroes. 
Averroes through the eye of Borges. 
Borges through the eye of Me. 

A line that passes through the ages, eroded 
By loss of memory, border of culture, consciousness isolated 
Partially pregnant, partially sterile. 

Let me become a bridge between the East and the West.
