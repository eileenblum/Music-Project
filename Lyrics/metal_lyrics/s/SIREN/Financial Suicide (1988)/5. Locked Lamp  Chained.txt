Can you find the answer if the questionâs not the same
To live or die in this world, on and all, it is the same
We are the sole survivors of a strong but dying breed
Masters of this massacre, weâre fighting for our creed

Please give me a program cusâ I canât tell who is who
Do you work for me, or do I work for you ?
You can try to buy me but you canât afford my price
Youâd better get outâ¦ while you can get outâ¦ with your life

Locked and chained
Weâre fighting for our song
Live or die
Ainât never gonna stop
Right or wrong
Weâre sworn by oath to rock
Locked and chained
Itâs really all youâve got

[Solo]

The meaning is irrelevant, if you cannot understand
We are the metal regiment, the masters in command
The driving force, the surging rage, unleashes in your mind
None other recognized today, thereâs so much more to find
