Throw out the rules
Throw out the fools
Wheels are in motion
Wheels are in rule

Bounce it around
Juggle the facts
Stand in the middle
Take up the slack

We play for keeps
We play to win
We beat you once
And weâll do it again

Weâre on a roll
Out of control
Part of your life
So where will you go ?

[Refrain]:
We are one
And we wonât fall down
We stand strong
And we wonât give ground
We stand strong
And we wonât fall down
We stand strong
Not givinâ any ground

Itâs so easy
But, itâs so heavy
The tide is turning
So get ready

Nobody tells us what to say !
Nobody tells us what to play !
How much power,
Does it take,
To rule and control ?

A new power unleashed
From parallel minds
Put under pressure
So weâre doinâ fine

Shappinâ it up
Cut out the fat
The same but different
We know where itâs at

Break in the bitch
Break her in hard
Use no discretion
No fucking regard

Weâre on a roll
Out of control
Part of your life
So where will you go ?

[Refrain]:
We stand strong
And we wonât fall down
We stand strong
Not giving any ground
Weâre movinâ on
And weâre pickinâ up steam
We canât go wrong
The American dream
We stand strong

Itâs so easy
But, itâs so heavy
The tide is turning
So get ready

Nobody tells us what to say !
Nobody tells us what to play !
Itâs the ultimate high,
Weâll never die,
Donât even try !

The power is here
Everythingâs clear
Nothing to question
Nothing to fear

The march has begun
Fun in the sun
Power is growing
Now that weâve won

Nothing to hate
Life is a breeze
Isnât it great
When everyone sees

What can you say
What can you do
Itâs the ultimate high
Too easy â¦ too cool â¦

[Refrain]:
We stand strong
And we wonât fall down
We stand strong
Not giving any ground
Weâre movinâ on
And weâre pickinâ up steam
We canât go wrong
The American dream
We stand strong
And we wonât fall down
We stand strong
Not giving any ground
We stand strong
