Misty Morning ... The sky above is grey
Fearless Warlord ... Arriving here today
His Steel beside him ... He`s come to make things right
Someone`s got some dues to pay , before the day sets into night

Cowards trembling ... Demons filled with fear
They know their time`s expired ... For the master is near
The fighting done ; the battle won ... The warrior
rides the plans
Yet he takes no gifts or gratitude , for the wicked once he`s slain

Unsung hero ... Martyr in the night
Dying in battle ... But living for fight
Mighty warrior ... Freedom fighting man
Unsung hero ... May his soul rise up again

Unknown Soldier ... Keeper of this land
Peace and posterity ... Left standing hand in hand
Throughout all the years ... a million lives he changed
Everyone in debt to him ... Yet no one knows his name

A rightous fighting man ... Few birds have shared his love
To battle fills his destiny ... Like a hand fills in a glove
Always been self conscience of the troubled ways of the earth
Rides onward hoping that the pure obtain rebirth

Unsung hero ... Soldier dressed in white
Without warning ... He draws his sword to fight
Stand beside him ... He`s come to make things right
Unsung hero ... Fade into the light
