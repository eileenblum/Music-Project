[Verse:]
Metal towers scrape the sky
The adventure rolls on in the mind's eye
High voltage pumping through the lines
The current, with my soul, intertwines

[Chorus:]
Lines of steel
How they control your life
Oh, it's real
And no way to stop the flow
Lines of steel
The framework of what we are
The cage is real
Intact and unbroken

[Bridge:]
These lines of steel bring only facts
Their meaning comes from deep within
The mentality that the posers lack
The epitome of deceit and sin
Our spider's web is now complete
Intricate and absolute
With tomorrow's dawn it's obsolete
Nothing in the world
Can stop the awesome progress going on

[Verse:]
Try as you may...there can be no escape
These lines of steel born to dominate
Fight like the storm...ride the mighty wind
Unstoppable power that comes from within

[Chorus:]
Lines of steel
Brought us to where we are
Can't you feel
The power is surging
Lines of steel
Reach out...caress the world
The cage is real
Intact and unbroken

[Bridge:]
These lines of steel bring only facts
Their meaning comes from deep within
The mentality that the posers lack
The epitome  of deceit and sin
Someday soon a new age will dawn
The steel we hold, so precious will be gone
What's done is done
We'll keep ourselves second to none
Only time will tell

[Verse:]
Musical alloys the blend of the best
A shocking performance the ultimate test
The louder the volume the less I feel pain
Uncontrollable feedback the ultimate gain
The watchful eye of security
Towering true in sovereignty
They're under stress-but they still support
Is our lifestyle becoming a dinosaur

[Bridge]

[Closing:]
Entropy's changing the world
And one by one
We've overcome
Now that we're under the gun
Phantoms cold and gray
Whisper across the hills
Where the children play
