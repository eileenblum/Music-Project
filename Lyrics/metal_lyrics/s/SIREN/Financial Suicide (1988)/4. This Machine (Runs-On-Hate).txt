[Moans]

You wanna chop em all to bits
You do and you know it
They can see it in your eyes
But you donât want to show it
Youâve got to reach the masses
You want them all on their knees
But youâre afraid
So let me tell you what you need

[Chorus:]
This machine runs-on-hate
If youâve come with love
Youâve come too late
This machine runs-on-hate
If youâve come with love
Youâve come too late
This machine
Canât you see (we)
Want to rule the world â¦
Ha â Ha â Ha â Ha â Ha â Ha â How

Move along now donât you cry
Just move aside or youâll be the first to die
Cut throats and â
Back-stabbers surrounding me
Consume their souls
And then I will be set free
Youâd be surprised
What this machine can do

[Chorus:]
âCus it runs-on-hate
If youâve come with love
Youâve come too late
This machine runs-on-hate
If youâve come with love
Youâll have to wait
This machine
Why canât you see
We want to rule the world â¦
Ha â Ha â Ha â Ha â Ha â Ha

This machine is running wild
It wonât forgive or be reconciled
Itâs a little (bit) late â
For that now bitch â itâs over
If you wanna roll
With the changes
Maybe you should
Just-Roll-Over
This machine â¦ [4x]
