Running through darkness escaping the light
Living depends upon finding the night
You can do it
Power and speed through narrow and straight
The strength of the load will determine your fate
Like a bullet

Stopâ¦ Take a look at yourself and youâll see
Innocence holds no equity
Youâd better get out while thereâs time
Nowâ¦ Is the time for a change to take place
The system to you is a slap in the face
It can wound beyond reason and rhyme

[Chorus:]
Like a bulletâ¦ You will slice through itâ¦
And they will fightâ¦
âCause they know you are right
Heroes live not a long life
But a life you must take
For our freedomâs at stake
Strikeâ¦ In the nightâ¦
Like a bullet

Officials in office, they break their own laws
âWe the peopleâ do try but we fight a lost cause
I can prove it
The corruption grows stronger
But what can you do
If you bring in the law you feel catch 22
Like a bullet

Fightâ¦ Take a standâ¦
Make your point and youâll see
Soon ye shall taste victory
Youâd better act now while thereâs time
Youâveâ¦
Got the power and now you have the grace
You look at your hand
And youâre holding the ace
You can cut through the antics of mine

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Double Chorus]
