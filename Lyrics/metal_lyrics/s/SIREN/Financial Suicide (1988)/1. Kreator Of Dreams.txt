Don`t close your eyes or you will not identify
The entity that besieges your mind
Take the journey through chaotic delusion
Leave Reality far behind

No one can keep control
For I can be neither friend nor foe
No chance now to escape
Your subconscious you have betrayed

The heavens fall or does the earth reaches for the sky ?
In this state of mind you`ll never know
You know that you`re a goner but can never really die
It`s just another part of my spectacular show

Come with me as I take you back in time
To see the past
It`s so real
But I can`t last
Look while you can cus` you won`t remember what you`ve seen
Don`t even try
It`s not allowed
Not allowed by me
Kreator of dreams
No I`m not fair
Nor what I seem
Kreator of dreams
