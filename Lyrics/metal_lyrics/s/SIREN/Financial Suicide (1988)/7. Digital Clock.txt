I can see into the future
Listen, can you hear me
Amidst the chaos and confusion
Inside your digital illusion
Our destiny unfolds before us
Like history has always told us
Time is running out
No hope in sight

Com â pu â ters â¦

Living in these times of terror
Subject not to human error
Without the card youâve no existence
Evil puts up much resistance
They know everything about you
They tell you youâre a number
If you read between the lines
Itâs all spelled out

[Chorus:]
Will we learn to live another way
Live another day
Can we unlock the door and live again
Or will it be the end

Not a mortal man
I control my destiny
I wanna blaze across the odyssey of infinity â¦

The world is burning all around us
Shadows of the past surround us
No yesterdays and no tomorrows
Just misery and endless sorrows
Now itâs over, donât regret it
Time is ending, so forget it
If I were you
I would be scared
The end is near â¦

[Chorus]

No one stops to wonder why
Theyâve forgotten how to cry
Itâs gonna be a lovely world â¦
