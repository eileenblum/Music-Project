I lay alone at midnites toll
Awakened in a distant dream
A demonâs laugh, an angelâs cry
A martyrâs painful scream
Shadow of the future
A tragedy to tell
His words echo footsteps
On his journey out of hell

Listen to my vice youâll hear it as your own
In the fire of my eyes your bloody past unfolds
Medieval swords, crusading plunder,
poison gas, your fathers under
M-16 shread your brother
atomic fate youâll know no other

Centuries have past you by
yet time is standing still
Your leadersâ lies from evil eyes
Still have you at their will
Oh foolish ones consumed by pride
you hate, you war, your children die
A thousand chances through greed are lost
Eternal darkness will be the cost

Your tragedies repeat themselves
How blind can you be
With much contempt I leave this world
To fester in disease
Pray forgiveness sinful ones,
Before the trumpets blow
Or wait until the final hour
An I will welcome you below
