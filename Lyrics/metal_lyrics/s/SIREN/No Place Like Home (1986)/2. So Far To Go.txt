The hammer forges binding chains
The sickle draws blood from my veins
I look off into distant skies
All I see is the red they force into my eyes
The pressure hastens my demise
Iâve heard thereâs so much more
Calling me to freedomâs shore
Should I entice such deadly fate

I crawl the ground in rabid flight
Blazing eyes search through the night
Razor wire of gleaming steel
Ten thousand volts the coiled blades conceal
I sense the dogs are on my heal
Canât tell my sweat from tears
A shadowed figure laughs and rears his head
Can be this the end

So many times when they have dreamed
Iâve sat atop the eagleâs wings
Across this land he flies so great and free
And there a lovely lady stands
She lights my way with torch in hand
She stands for liberty - and the free

Beyond the wall I run for life
Gunfire burning up the night
Iâve got to make a hundred yards
I know that they can only go so far
The blood of freedom now pumps through
my heart
Sweet freedom up ahead
I thought for sure I would be dead
Instead Iâm free

So many times when they have dreamed
Iâve sat atop the eagleâs wings
Across this land he flies so great and free
And there a lovely lady stands
She lights my way with torch in hand
She stands for liberty - and the free
