Sometimes it seems â it was never meant to be â
the answers so unclear
Thatâs when it comes to mind -
another place in time
Only the truth to fear

Certain things that you donât understand
Still your calling is your mindâs command
Someday you might see how
For the knowledge thereâs a price you pay
The truth is never very far away
So whoâs the victim now

When you get the feeling 
that youâve been here before,
maybe itâs just a feeling, or itâs something more,
like someoneâs calling you

if you have the time I think
That you can find the key
To unlock the door into your own worst misery

Part of what youâre looking for
is deeply suppressed in your dreams
Picking up the pieces in â nocturnal extremes
Nothing more â deep inside
Hidden realities you never face
In your mind â a place in time â your innerspace

Close your eyes â you are there
Happens as soon as you turn out the light
Without delay youâre on your way â
lost in the night

Another world â itâs another there
Keeping the balance between time and space
Leaving you with a memory that you can never erase

Iâve been screaming â no repeal
Am I dreaming â or is it real
Tell meâ¦

Now and then you wake and you wonder while
Itâs still fresh in your mind
And you donât know where it is
This funny place youâve been to
Another place in time

Iâm obsessed â afraid to rest
The feelings grow stronger and stronger
each day
Haunting me â taunting me â to go away
Iâm growing weak â afraid to speak
Still slipping further and further away
Coming back â still intact â but never to stay
Iâve been there â what a scare
I caught a glimpse of the horror in store
A world of pain â a world insane â no metaphore
Itâs another world â another place
Keep the balance between time and space
Leaving you â with a memory â
you can never erase

Iâve been screaming â no repeal
Am I dreaming â or is it real
Tell meâ¦
