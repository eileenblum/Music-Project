In forty-two the world has burning
A massive power play
The vicious war machine
Was turning faster every day
From evil minds did evil come
And searching ways to kill
Using underwater pathways
To perform their ill

Their U-boats came and took their place
In the deadly game
Running low in darkened silence
Terror built their name
The German Wolfpacks start to plunder
On the North Atlantic seas
The devastation from down under
Brought men to their knees

Their fate was sealed
Wrapped in steel
No escape 
From Iron Coffins

The Nazi-Terror from below
Didnât last for long
As time went by they could not see
The allies were too strong
Countless young men lost their lives
In a death without disgrace
The solemn sea would not reveal
Their final resting place

Their fate was sealed
Wrapped in steel
A frozen grave
In Iron Coffins
