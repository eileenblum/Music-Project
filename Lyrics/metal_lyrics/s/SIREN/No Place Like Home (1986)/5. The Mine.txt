We labor every day
Toiling our lives away
But freedom we wonât find
Weâre working in a mine
Dig, dig, dig, dig down deep
Digging in the ground for what others have found
Down, down, down earn your keep
The digging and blasting seems everlasting

Only a chance in a million
Only a chance in a million
Then we struck it rich
In the mine
In the mine 
Itâs all mine

But you shouldnât take chances
Donât be a victim of circumstances
Over and under
Kinda makes you wonder
How long will it last
When youâre spending it so fast

In the mine â in the mine
In the mine â in the mine

Sordid, greedy, aged, little prospector
Now, now, youâve got it made
More, more, more always going back for more

Only a chance in a million
Only a chance in a million
In the mineâ¦

Youâve got money to burn now
Iâm sure in time youâll learn how
What will you do
When thereâs nothing left to buy
Richer and richer kinda makes a pretty picture
Year after year till the assets
Are pilled pretty high

To the sky
In the mine
In the mine
Itâs all mine
