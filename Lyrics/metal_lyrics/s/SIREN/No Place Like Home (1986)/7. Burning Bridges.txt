We started the game out so young and naive

Now youâve grown older â Now youâve grown wiser

A back stabbing business we could not conceive

Why donât you stay here â Why donât you play here

Women in dark doorways inviting us inside
They tried to suppress us while they undressed us
Now thereâs nowhere left for them to hide

How could we know
What we could believe
You only meant to deceive

You and I know
Now thereâs nowhere left to go
The tables are turning

Forget all the people you once knew
Keep only beside you, friends you know are true
Building the future in my mind
Destroy all your hopes and leave you far behind

Burning bridges, burning in front of you
Burning bridges, burning behind

An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Some of the memories trapped inside your youth
Into the darkness we must ride
Out of a nightmare leave you in our stride

Burning bridges, burning in front of you
Burning bridges, burning inside you

Itâs not a secret anymore
Itâs what weâve been waiting for
To even the score

No way to follow, no way to return

Move only forward, - Move only forward

When you were younger it didnât matter

Now youâve grown older â Now youâve grown wiser

When you were younger it didnât matter

Now youâve grown older â Now youâve grown wiser
Nowâ¦
