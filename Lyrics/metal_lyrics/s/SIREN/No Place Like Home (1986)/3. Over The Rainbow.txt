And as I awoke
From where I did not know
A world so far away
Into the sky, into the sky
A finger from the heavens
My home took to the air
Whirling round and round
Into the ground, into the ground
Death to the witch â the wicked witch is dead
Death to the witch â the wicked witch is dead
Faces I have seen, my mind I have lost
A scarecrow, a lion, a tinman
What does all this mean

Ah ah ah ah â over the rainbow, over the rainbow
Ah ah ah ah â over the rainbow, over the rainbow

Onward we journied
Off to see the wizzard
To find a way back
Back to my home, back to my home
Monkeymen with batwings
Fear from the air
The wicked witch of the West
Gives me no rest
Death to the witch â the wicked witch is dead
Death to the witch â the wicked witch is dead

Ah ah ah ah â over the rainbow, over the rainbow
Ah ah ah ah â over the rainbow, over the rainbow

Ah ah ah ah â over the rainbow, over the rainbow
Ah ah ah ah â over the rainbow, over the rainbow

I leave the Emerald City
My ruby slippers bring me home
Now I end my journey
As I find myself alone
And as I awoke
From where Iâll never know
A world so far away

No place like homeâ¦
