Looking back on how it used to be
A faded love oh girl why canât you see
Youâre not the same
Look what youâre doing to me
The dreams we shared
The times we spent together
Endless love gone forever
How long can I go on

Youâve changed my mind
Whatâs happened to the times
You and me another lost love
As time goes by
Remember how it was
You and me another lost love

The lies you told
Burning in my soul
Your lips so warm
Your words so cold
Two as one
Now I stand here alone
Itâs hard to hide
The pain I felt inside
Looking back and now I realize
Youâre not worth the tears I cried

[Chorus]

In the night your tears fall into day
A voice so near and yet so far away
Begging me to come and stay
When I was young your cries rang in my ears
Love has gone and with it went my tears
On your own to face the lonely years

[Chorus]
