For unto us
A child is born
And His name shall be called Wonderful
King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Christ our Savior unto the world
Almighty God
The Everlasting
The Prince of Peace
Faithful and True
In Righteousness
He stands to rule
With a rod of iron
King of Kings 
Lord of Lords
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On Earth as it is in heaven
His eyes are like a flame of fire
And on His head are many crowns
He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood
And His name is called the Word of God

The First and the Last
The Lamb of God
The Lion of Judah
The Living One
The Living One
The Living One
The Living One
