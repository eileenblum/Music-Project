The end is only the beginning of the story
I testify in truth, the everlasting glory
The everlasting light
The everlasting name
The everlasting gospel, I proclaim
He who has an ear
Let him hear the words
Let him hear the music
Let him hear the call
Come all children come
To your father and His Son
And you shall be prepared
For the time he shall come
No one knows the day
No one knows the hour
No man sees the future
No man has the power
But when you see these things
Know that it is near...

The beginning and the end
Amen
