And God will 
wipe away
Every tear
From their eyes
There shall be
No more death
No more sorrow
No more crying
There shall be
No more pain
For these things
Have passed away
It is done
I am Alpha
And Omega
The Beginning
And the End
I will give you life
He who overcomes
I will be his God
And he shall be my son

And the lamb shall down with the lion
And the lion shall rule with the lamb
Stand and lead us forever
You kingdom command

Behold I Am
Behold I Am
Behold these words are faithful and true
Behold I Am
Behold my Name
