Look
Our Lord
Our Savior
Our King for evermore
In heaven and earth
You make all things new
In death
In birth
We have come to You
In all that you embrace
In all that you conceive
In all that you accomplish
In all that you complete
In all that you bestow
In all that you reveal
In all that you have shown
In all that you have healed
In all that is your glory
In all that is your name
In all that is your story
In all that is your fame
In all that is your love
In all that is your grace
In all that is your heart
In all that is your face
