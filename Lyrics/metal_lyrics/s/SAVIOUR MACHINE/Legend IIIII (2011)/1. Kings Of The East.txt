Coming is the dawn
Coming is the dawn
Coming is the dawn
Coming is the dawn
Coming is the dawn
The sleeping giant wakes
His slumber breaks
His vaunted legends rage
Their number shakes
The dragon nations wage
The art of war
Two hundred million plagues
Martching on
The kings of the east
The kings of the east
They gather to feast
They gather to feast
As they march towards the beast
The kings of the east
The kings of the east
They gather to feast
They gather to feast
As they march towards the beast
The kings of the east
The kings of the east
They gather to feast
They gather to feast
As they march towards the beast
