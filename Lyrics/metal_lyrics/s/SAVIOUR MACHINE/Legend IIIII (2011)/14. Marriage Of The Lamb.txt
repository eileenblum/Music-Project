Let us be glad and rejoice in His glory
The marriage of the lamb has arrived
and his bride is made ready
Blessed are those who are called
Blessed are those who are called to his hand
Blessed are those who are called
Blessed are those who are called to the marriage of the lamb
And the Spirit and the Bride say come
And let him who is, say come
Come to my children
Come to my bride
Come to my children
Come to Him
Come to Him
Let him who thirsts come and drink of the water
Of life and the seeds? from throne of the lamb
And he shall reign forever
And there shall be no night
And he shall reign forever
And we shall be in his light
And he shall reign forever
And there shall be no night
And he shall reign forever
And we shall be in his light
And the Lord God Almighty Stands
And the Bridge has taken His hand
