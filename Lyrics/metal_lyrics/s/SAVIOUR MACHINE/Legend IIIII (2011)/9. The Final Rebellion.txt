Satan come forth 
Come forth for my grace is empty
And the vengeance is mine
Satan come forth
Come forth to the everlasting fire
Prepared for your time

Come Satan you and your angels
Come face your hell and damnation
Come Satan you and your angels
Come face your hell and damnation
Come Satan you and your angels
Come face your hell and damnation

I never knew your name
Unto the burning flame
Lost is thy name 
To the flame
The Liar
Be silent
Be gone
Deceive 
No more
Deceive no more
Lost is thy name 
To the flame
The Liar
Be silent
Be gone
Deceive 
No more
Deceive no more
