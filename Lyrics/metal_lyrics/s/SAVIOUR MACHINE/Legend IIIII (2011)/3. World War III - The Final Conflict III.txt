And they fallen through sin
And they are bound together with him
For the  dishonor of God
And the destruction of man
And the destruction of man
Enter the Kings of the North
Enter the Kings of the South
Enter the Kings of the East
Into the mouth of the beast
Into the mouth of the beast
And he devours the earth
And he devours the flesh of men
And he shall stretch out his hand
Yet he shall come to his end
Yet he shall come to his end
The wages of sin is death
The wages of sin is death
The wages of sin is death
The wages of sin is death
Death
