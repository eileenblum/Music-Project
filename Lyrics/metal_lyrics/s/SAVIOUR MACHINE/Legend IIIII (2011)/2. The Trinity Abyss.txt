Life spills from the abyss
Crawl from my hand
Demons within
Go out to them
Go out to them
Go out to them
Go out to them
Call the nations
Gather them all
Unto the battle 
Unto the fall
Go out to them
Go out to them
Go out to them
Go out to them
Come one
Come all
Armageddon
Armageddon
My name Legion
For we are many
My name is Legion
For we are many
My name Legion
For we are many
My name is Legion
For we are many
My name Legion
For we are many
My name is Legion
For we are many
My name Legion
