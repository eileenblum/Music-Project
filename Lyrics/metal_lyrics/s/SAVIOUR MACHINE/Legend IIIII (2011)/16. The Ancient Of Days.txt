I am love
I am life
I am truth
I am the light
I am the way
I am the ancient of days
I am the voice of the thunder
I am all beauty and wonder
I am the fire that consumes
I am divine in my truth
I am the dawn of creation
I am eternal salvation
I am the author of time
I am forever alive
I am the power and glory
I am all wisdom and mercy
I am the judgement and wrath
I am the first and the last
I am the Lord everlasting
I am God of Israel
I am almighty and great
I am the ancient of days

I am I
In legend I lay?
