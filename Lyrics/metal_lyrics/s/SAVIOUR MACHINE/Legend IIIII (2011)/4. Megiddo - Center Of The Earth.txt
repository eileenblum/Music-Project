You can discern the face of the sky
But cannot discern the signs of the times
The face of the sky 
The signs of the times
The signs of the times
The voice of the age
Pronouncing the stage
Calling us all to the cults and our fate
Calling us all to the cults and our fate
All to the cults and our fate
All to the cults and our fate
That were foretold and came to pass
So shall the things that remain
The cults and our fate
So shall the things that remain
It is prophesy
It is absolute
Absolute
Absolute
It is his history
And his prophesy
It is absolute
Absolute
Absolute
It is our destiny
And our names
That is found
Where it stands on the ground
Of Megiddo
Where it stands on the ground
Of Megiddo
The course is chosen
It cannot be turned
