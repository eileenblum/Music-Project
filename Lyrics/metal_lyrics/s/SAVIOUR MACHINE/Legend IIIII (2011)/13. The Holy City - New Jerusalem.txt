And she has weathered all the violence of the storm
And now the sacred child of silence shall be born
And He has turned the thoughts of fathers to their sons
And now the voices of the prophets shall be one
Behold the holy city - New Jerusalem
Coming out of heaven as a bride prepared for Him
Behold the tabernacle of God is with men
And they shall be His people
And God Himself shall be with them

Come I will show you the light of the land...

Holy Holy New Jerusalem
She is coming
Holy Holy New Jerusalem
He is coming...
