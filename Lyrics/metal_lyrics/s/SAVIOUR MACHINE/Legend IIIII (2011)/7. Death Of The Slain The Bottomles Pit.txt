And they were cast alive
Into the lake of fire
Burning eternal night
Burning eternal night
And the others were killed
By the sword of His name
From the mouth of the King
From the mouth of the King
And the birds ate their flesh
As the sentence of pain
In the death of the slain
In the death of the slain

Leave us Satan
Leave us Satan
Leave us Satan...
