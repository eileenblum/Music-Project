In solemn tears of men, Jerusalem
In solemn tears of men, Jerusalem
In solemn tears of men, Jerusalem
In solemn tears of men, Jerusalem
And the faces of men gather blackness
As the mountains shall all be thrown down
And the violent raptures of his kingdom
Shall be lost and they shall not be found
In the black heart of the storm
Armageddon guards the dawn
In the valley of the bones
Armageddon binds the stones
The earth shall now disclose her blood
And shall uncover all her slain
The angels now cease to restrain
And shall unleash as vengeance reigns
The wrath of God shall now descend
To spill the blood of evil men
The true Messiah is at hand
To judge the living and the dead
Wait for His Son from heaven
Children of Armageddon
The valley of decision
The valley of decision
Time will be no more
Time will be no more
Time will be no more
Time will be no more
Apocalypse
They have rejected His mercy
Apocalypse
They have despised His love
Behold Apocalypse
They have denied His glory
Behold the fall
They have abandoned His law
And the songs of the temple shall be poundings in that day
Bodies shall lie in every place
And they shall cast their thought with silence
Not enough living to bury the dead
Not enough living to bury the dead
Not enough living to bury the dead
Not enough living to bury the dead
The voice of prayer
The sound of weeping
And lamentation fills the air
The voice of prayer
The sound of weeping
And lamentation fills the air
Unto the kingdom of heaven they cry
They cry
All hands will go limp
Every mans heart will melt
Terror will seize them
Anguish will grip them
And they will writhe like a woman in labor
And they will look at each other
Their faces aflame
In the day of heathen rage
In the day the heathen rage
Rage
Rage
Rage
And the nations come against the Lord and His anointed saying:
Let us break their backs the sons of flesh 
Lets cast away their courts from us
Here is the rebellion of man at it's end
Now the end of the rebellion of man shall begin
Multitudes, multitudes await in the valley of decision
Armageddon
Armageddon
Armageddon...

I am God 
I am Lord
And before Me there is no other
There is no other
There is no other
