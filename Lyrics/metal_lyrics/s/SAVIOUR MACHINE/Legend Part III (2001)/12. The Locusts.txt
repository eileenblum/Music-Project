The fifth angel sounded...

In the star that falls from heaven Is the key that is given to thee
To the shaft of the rising abyss and eternity...

The he opened the bottomless pit
And the smoke and the flame arise
And the sun and air were darkened by eternal night...

And in those days men will seek death
And death will flee from men...

Men will seek their death
And death will flee from men...

In the shape of raging horses
By the crowns upon their heads
In their faces lies the horror of the faces of men...

In the lion's teeth of iron
By their wings the sound of death
In their tails the sting of scorpions; to torture, to end...

Then out of the smoke the locusts came upon the earth
And to them was given the power to reign, to reign
Out of the smoke the locusts came upon the earth...

And as their king; the angel of the pit
Shall keep his name; destruction and pain
Destruction and pain...
