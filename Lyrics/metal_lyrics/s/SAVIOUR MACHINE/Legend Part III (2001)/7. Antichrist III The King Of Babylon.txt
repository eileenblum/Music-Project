"Lord, my God, grant me the power to bring your will
Lucifer, give me this hour to feed, to kill."

"In your name; I bestow your pain
By your face; I destroy his grace
Through your eyes; I create all lies
By your flesh; I rejoice in death."

"In your blood; I am anointed as Babylon."

"Thy kingdom come, they will be done
On earth as it is in hell."

"Unleash the beast; behold, the king of Babylon...
Embrace the slaughter; behold, the king of Babylon."

"Prey on the saints, feast on the martyrs
Reign on the slaves in the name of my father."

"I come in the name of the one true king."

"Babylon, Babylon, my beloved Babylon."

"All the world hail the king of the earth and the seas
All the world hail the king, hail the son,
Hail the beast; Lucifer."

"As the king of the world I shall reign by the hand
Of he who commands me to be...
As the king I shall walk in the dominions of pain
As a legion of flames follows me
To the valley of destiny."
