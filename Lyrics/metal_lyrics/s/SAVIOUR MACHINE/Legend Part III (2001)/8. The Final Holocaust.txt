"God save Israel."

Take them from the bondage and chains
Bind them to your holy name...

"God save Israel."

She has suffered the first
She has suffered the last
And her back has been broken
And her wings are collapsed...

"Israel, O Israel;
Her captives are calling,
Hear their prayers."

"God save Israel."
