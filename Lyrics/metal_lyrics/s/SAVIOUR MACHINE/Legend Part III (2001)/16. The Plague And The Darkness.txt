Then the fourth angel poured his bowl
Upon the sun and the flames came
And men were scorched with fire, in blasphemy...
The cursed the God of plagues...

Then the fifth angel poured his bowl
Upon the throne of the beast
And his kingdom fell in darkness
And in pain and disease...

"Repent of all your demons
Repent of all your deeds
Repent of wickedness
Disgrace and blasphemy."

"Repent of all your evil
Repent of all your crimes
Repent from this unholy
Betrayal and sacrifice."

"Repent from your harlot
Repent from your tyrant
The plague and the darkness
Have fallen in silence."
