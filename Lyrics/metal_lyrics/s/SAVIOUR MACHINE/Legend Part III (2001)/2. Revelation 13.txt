All his power; the dragon gave to thee
All the world and all the seas
Marveled and followed and worshiped the beast...

Apocalypse, apocalypse...

"Who is like beast?"
"Who is able to make war with him?"

Apocalypse, apocalypse...

He who has an ear; let him hear
He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity
He who kills by the sword must be killed by the sword...

Immortal Lord
Killed by the sword
Immortal Lord
