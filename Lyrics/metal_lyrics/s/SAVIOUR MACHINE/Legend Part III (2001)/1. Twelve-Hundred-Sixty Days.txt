The dragon enraged; time is engaged
The woman in place; time is erased
Until a time, and times, and the dividing of time...

The stones cry out of the wall.
Separation, desolation, tribulation, revelation...

The final walk with death
The violent heart of destiny
The covenant has wept
Rest in peace, rest in peace...

The deafening silence is sealed in the grave
Twelve-hundred-sixty days...
The suffering children's transgression remains
Twelve-hundred-sixty days...
The treacherous waters have vomited rage
Twelve-hundred-sixty days...
The woman anointed; She flies to her place Twelve-hundred-sixty days...

Into the wilderness; into it's face
Fly from the desolate; fallen from grace...

Weather the storm; clothed with the sun
Weather the storm; the flood still comes...

The flood still comes...
