"We have made a convenant with death
In blood we stand
The wound we cannot mend."

Weeping in this silent mutilation; it is slain
Speaking this unholy revelation; it proclaims...

Abomination of desolation
Standing in the holy place...

"I am a God, I sit in the seat of Gods
In the midst of the seas."

Beating on the altar, it is born in sacrifice
Breathing from the slaughter, it arises; antichrist...

Abomination of desolation
Standing in the holy place...

"I am a God, I sit in the seat of Gods
In the midst of the seas."

"We who mourn are betrayed
We who bow are enslaved
We who fight shall be slain
We who flee shall be saved
We who perish; insane
We who suffer remain."
