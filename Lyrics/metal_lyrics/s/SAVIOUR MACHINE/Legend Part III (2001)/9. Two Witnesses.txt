"Moses, my child I have watched over you
And you, Elijia I have heard your cries."

"The hour of redemption is upon you
The day of judgment comes
The gates to all of heaven are before you
My true anointed sons."

"Now, as your bodies lie in the street
The shroud of my witnesses
Called for the world to see."

"Rise, prophets rise; now, stand on your feet
Come to your father
Ascend in the clouds to me."

"Elijia, Moses, rise in my eyes
Elijia, Moses, my sons, come."
