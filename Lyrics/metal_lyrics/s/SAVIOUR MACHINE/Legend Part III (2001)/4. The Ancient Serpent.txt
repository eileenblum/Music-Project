Ten horns arise; the seven heads
Upon it's crowns and diadems
It's tail swept down unto the earth
The stairs of heaven; a third have turned...

The dragon stands before her cries of life
Bound to devour the child of light...
And now the serpent's crown shall be bestowed
Unto the beast unto it's throne...

The ancient serpent, the ancient son
The ancient horror, the ancient one
The ancient mystery of all iniquity
Is now complete within it's silent trinity...

"You were the seal of all perfection
Perfect in beauty, knowledge and wisdom
And you defiled your sanctuaries
By the multitude of your iniquities."

"And you were cast unto the ground
And I brought fire forth from your midst
And it devoured you from within
As it empowered all that is sin."

The ancient serpent, the ancient son
The ancient horror, the ancient one
The ancient mystery of all iniquity
Is now complete within it's silent trinity...

The age of grace is over
The legacy is fate...

The age of grace is over
As destiny awaits.
