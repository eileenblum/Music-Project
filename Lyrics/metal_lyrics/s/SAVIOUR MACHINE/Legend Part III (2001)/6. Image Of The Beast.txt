And his deadly wound was healed
And all the world was marked and sealed
In secret doctrines once concealed
The deities have now revealed
The feast; unto the beast...

In the face of tyranny
The eyes of all authority
It's nostrils bleed captivity
Through teeth of iron; in blasphemy
It speaks; the mouth of disease...

"God is dead,
His angels bleed inside my dreams,
Eternally bow to thee,
Kneel before your violent king
All shall worship me and the crown of the beast."

"Every tribe and tongue and nation
Follow thee or die...
Multitudes of all creation
Praise thee and arise...
Children of the origins immortal mystery
Apostles of the ancient order
Manifest the seas."

"Come to me;
Behold the image of the beast in ecstasy
Come to me;
Disciples of idolatry
For God almighty speaks."
