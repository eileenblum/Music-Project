[The Missing Piece From Legend Part II]

Behold the illusion of peace;
The devil's greatest lie beneath...
The time is now...It is our destiny
The time is now...It is anarchy...

Stand and behold the new world order is at hand;
The fierce  aggressors transform the face of the land,
Changing times and law, to infiltrate, to dominate...

Behold the ominous insurgents cry...
Let them come up to anoint the times
The time is now...And the nations realign
The time is now...A brave new world arise...

Stand and behold the new world order is at hand;
Behold the fourth beast; dreadful and powerful; and
It shall devour the earth, trample it down and break
It to pieces in the day of evil...

A king of fierce countenance rise,
The final world empire revived; the peace of rome,
The beast and its throne; it is turning,
Burning on its horns; ten crowns
And on its head a name : "the king of babylon..."

Stand and behold the new world order is at hand;
Behold the world empire through fire and blood and death
And the order of the beast commands...
Stand and behold the new world order and the call
To armageddon; the human race is over, ended
By the hands of the architects of time in the
Parliament of man; behold the federation of the world...

Behold the federation of the world...
