Behold the final solution,
Waiting in the shadows of indoctrination ...
The beast arise;
Rotting in the system of the antichrist ...

This is the tragedy, the ominous prophecy ...
This is the mystery of his identity ...
This is technology, the dark night of slavery ...
This is the enemy within its conspiracy ...

The lawless one has shown his face;
It is in place, it is in place ...

The seal of the one, the name of the son ...
the number is all we become;
The mark of the beast ...

Here is the new synthesis; it will be implemented;
Digital signals embedded within;
Beneath the skin ...
The flesh of man is chained unto
The terrifying legends of the hidden truth;
We are an omen bound to the flame
We are the sacrifice unto its name ...
Behold the face of tyranny, its image conceived;
Let he who has wisdom and understanding see
The mark of the beast, the mark of the beast ...

We are seduced by assassins
And then replaced by victim circuits ...
Trust no one, trust no one ...

The greater the lie, the more that it blinds,
Do not be deceived by the crimes
Of the killing machines;
The mark of the beast ...

The system has won;
Privacy does not exist,
Sovereignty is done ....
Big brother is dead and gone;
The antichrist is watching ...
