This is not the cross that bleeds, behold, this is a dagger,
Rising from the earth; the beast foretold; this is the nail ...
These are not the horns of a lamb; behold the voice of a dragon
Crying in the wilderness aloud ...

This is the veil of pain stained with murder,
It follows the trial of blood leading the other ...

Look in the eyes of a saviour's lies, dancing away
Listen to the signs of the prophet's cries preparing the way ...

"To the only people, and to the nations of the world to come ...
He who has an ear let him hear the voice of one: ...
As we face the greatest conflict history has seen
We must examine our dreams of the near future ...
It is time now to reveal the vision of his prophecy,
And to seal our souls against the forces upon us ...
The voice of God has spoken; the messiah is at hand,
And I am the forerunner of the messiah ...
For he will alter history forever as he stands,
And you shall worship the beast who is risen again ...
Crying in the wilderness; the image of the son
I shall proclaim, I shall stop the rain ...
He who has an ear, let him hear the voice of one:
I shall bring fire down from heaven above ..."

"He who as has an ear, let him hear the voice of one:"

"I will give the world the dream of life,
The keys of the blood ...
I will force the mark of the beast
Arise ...the prophet has come ..."

Resist this tyranny,
And all the madness within ...
