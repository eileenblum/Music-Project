And he shall deceive those who dwell
On the earth and in its hell
By the sign which he is granted
In the sight of the beast; calling all
To make an image of who shall fall ...
In the spirit of blasphemy,
In the harvest of blood ...
A fortress of tyranny claims the dawn ...
The great inquisition has surely begun ...
In the name of its father, in the name of its son ...
It spoke as a dragon; "A legend is one ..."
