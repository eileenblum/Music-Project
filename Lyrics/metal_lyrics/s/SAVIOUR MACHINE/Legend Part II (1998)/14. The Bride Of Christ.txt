The bride of Christ awaits
Fearless and faithfully ...
His infinite mercy ...

Behold the man of sorrows, the prince of peace ...
Behold almighty God, the king of kings ...

Behold the mystery, we shall not all sleep,
But we shall all be changed in a moment ...
For the trumpet will sound, and the dead shall
Be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed ...

For this perishable nature must
Put on the imperishable ...
And this mortal nature must
Put on immortality ...

For the lord himself shall descend from heaven,
The dead in Christ will rise ...
And we who are alive and remain,
Shall be caught up with them in the clouds
To meet the Lord in the air ...

And we shall always be with the Lord ... eternally ...
