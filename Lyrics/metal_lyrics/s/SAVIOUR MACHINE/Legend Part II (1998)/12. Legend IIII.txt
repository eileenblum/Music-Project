And the world caught its breath ...
And the bride receive the gift ...
And one who lives forever
Manifest to his saints;
The breath of life ...
Inscribed in separate body, glorified ...

Unless one is born again, he cannot see ...
The kingdom of heaven is calling to thee ...

"Spirits rise" ... the Holy Ghost cries ...
"Spirits rise" ... the legacy lies
In His eyes ... the Legend is life ...
