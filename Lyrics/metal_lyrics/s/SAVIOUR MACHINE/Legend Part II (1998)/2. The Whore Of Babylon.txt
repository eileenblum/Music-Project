Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot;
She is seated on the throne of many waters,
And all the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her ...

And I saw the woman sitting on a scarlet beast
With seven heads and ten horns, full of names of blasphemy ...

And on her hand, the name of mystery;
Babylon The Great, mothers Of harlots
And abominations of the earth ...

And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints,
And the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, bound in disgrace ...

Behold the final apostasy;
The heresy .. the maiden of blasphemy,
The sorcery ... the pagan idolatry,
The mystery .. the bride of iniquity

Behold, the center of demonic faith
The filthiness in the sea of black beneath her
Behold the true satanic nature
Defined in its allegiance to the new world order ...
Behold the ritual of the new age
And the multitude occult; the new crusades ...
Babylon reigns, Babylon reigns ...

Come, I will tell you the mystery of the woman
And of the beast which carries her ...
The seven heads are seven hills on which the
Woman sits, and they are seven kings within ...
The ten horns are ten kings who shall receive power
Together with the beast .. one hour ...

And they will hate the harlot; they will make her
Desolate and naked, devour her flesh and burn her with fire ...

And in one hour thy judgment will come; she will burn
As Sodom And Gomorrah on the day of the lord ...
Her smoke and fire will rise forever more;
Behold the whore of Babylon ...
