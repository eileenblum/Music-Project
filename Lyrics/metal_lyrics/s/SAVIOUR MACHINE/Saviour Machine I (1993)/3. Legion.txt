Legion moves over the land
Softly he whispers, his forces command
Naked she lies on the crucifix crying
the tears of the innocent die
The dragon slides between her thighs
The dragon breathes the fire
As blood drips from her eyes
Until delivered of the child

And all the leaders of the nations follow single file
And all the brothers of the legion drift upon the Nile
To face the beast in all its ecstasy
And dreams of out betrayal
As love will die within the force
That drains is from the grail
She drinks the blood of prophets
And she drinks the blood of saints
Between her legs they crawl in torment
For the souls they lay to waste
Upon the altar, the sacrifice begins
The dragon takes another, and feeds upon his sins
To live and breathe again
Under the night, Under the Liar
Into the night, Into the fire

Is this the coming of the day?
As the alliance of the dragon takes its prey

Is this the call of revolution?
Is this the fall of revolution of the soul?

Is this the cry from all corruption?
Or is corruption just a fortress we bestow?

And if you're looking for the Answer
And if you're looking for the Light that leads the way

Take my hand and I will lead you
Where the torture and the pain will drift away

Stay with Me...
