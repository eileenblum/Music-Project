Listen to the thunder of the forces we reveal
Listen to the voices of the children we conceal
Fortress of the universe is tearing down the wall
Breaking all dimension through the essence of the call

Out in the distance of all time and space
As the Force of the Entity reigns

Vision that transcends upon the spirit of the night
Lifts him over darkness then surround him in the light
Opening the Saviour through the heart of his Machine
Brings him to the convenant that takes him through the dream

Out in the distance of all time and space
As the Force of the Entity reigns

The Force of the Entity reigns on me
Reigns on the sacrilege hear of the Beast
Reign on me
Reign on the children that walk in the path of the free

Come before the sacred heart and sacrifice the mind
Come before the silent invitation to the signs
Let us enter frightened ones, supress the need to hide
Let us cross the river's streams unto the other side

Out in the distance of all time and space
As the Force of the Entity reigns

Reign on
Reigns on the children that walk in the path of the free
