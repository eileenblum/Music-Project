Love leaves the soul
Blood feed the man who stands
Alone in the grasp of the hands
That fornicate the land
That emulate the past
To infiltrate a man to tear his brother's flesh
Then drink his blood as we confess
Unto the crimes, we lay at rest
We lay at rest

Rest upon the hand, rest upon the fortress
Hold me in your arms, hold on to the dreams
And the cry to wipe away the tears

In a world that takes away the seeds
And takes away another
To fill its evil needs
In a world that takes away the dreams
When dreams deceive a man, insanity proceeds
In a world that's drowning in its lies
Which persecute his brother
For the color of his eyes
In a world that radiates the skies
Intoxicates the oceans
So watch it as it dies, Alone

No one is home, now one will answer the call
The cry, hear the cry
Comprehend the nature of your soul

The horrors of a child that slips into the night
Surrenders to the fight to find his senses won't reply
Unto the evidence he finds along the way
He dies along the way

My world has no more meaning
I've not much more to take
Hold me in your arms, hold on to the dream
And the cry to wipe away the tears

In a world that takes away the seeds
And takes away another
To fill its evil needs
In a world that takes away the dreams
When dreams deceive a man, insanity proceeds
In a world that's drowning in its lies
Which persecute his brother
For the color of his eyes
In a world that radiates the skies
Intoxicates the oceans
So watch it as it dies, Alone
