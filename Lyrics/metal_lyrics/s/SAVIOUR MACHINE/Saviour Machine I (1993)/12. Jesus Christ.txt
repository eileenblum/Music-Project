You are the essence of a life that needs to pray
You are the shadow of a man that bleeds away
You are the hopes and fears that bind us to return
You are the shattered dream that frightens us to burn

Jesus Christ - Vengeance is mine
Jesus Christ - Leave them behind
Jesus Christ - Vengeance is mine
Jesus Christ - Please, leave them to die

You are the reason for the wars that plague the land
You are the symbol for the cause in which they stand
You are the one who sits there watching as they die
You are the son of man that listens as they cry

Jesus Christ - Vengeance is mine
Jesus Christ - Leave them behind
Jesus Christ - Vengeance is mine
Jesus Christ - Please, leave them to die

Are you are the man who said to turn the other cheek?
Are you the one for this appears to be the weak?
Are you to lift us from this silent found rebirth?
Are you to take us from this stench that fills the earth?

Jesus Christ - Vengeance is mine
Jesus Christ - Leave them behind
Jesus Christ - Vengeance is mine
Jesus Christ - Please, leave them to die
Bring them to life

Without hate, without pain
Without suffering insane
Without death, without fire
Without lies that feed the liar
Without war, without games
Without fear to take the blame
Without fame, without power
Without drugs to heal the coward
Without violence, without rape
Without sickness, without plagues
Without judgment, without crime
Without hope, without time
Without two, without three
Without torture over belief
Bring us love
Let us see
Set us Free
