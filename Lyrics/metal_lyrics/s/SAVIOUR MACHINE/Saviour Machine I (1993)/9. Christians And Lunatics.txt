Shelter the mind of remorse
Wallow in the heart of the liar
Steal by the soul and the force of the nail
As they follow the body of fire

Knowledge reveals itself once
Making persuasion the knife
Leaving incurable thoughts of betrayal
As they're draining the blood of its life

Sickness and poverty run though the streets
Logic and sanity bow at its feet
Violence and prejudice rule all the land
Greed and politics kneel in the palm of his hand

Follow me in madness, follow me in fear
Touch me in your silence, rape me in your tears
Let the sea sadness free the chosen one
Legacy of horror, manifest the son

Born into vast plains of fire
Beyond the reach of infinite mercy
They stand in desperation
Nameless forever more...

Christians and Lunatics search for the light
Catholics and Mormons will fight in the night
Preachers and presidents steal from them all
Teachers and leaders awaiting the signs of it's fall

Follow me in madness, follow me in fear
Touch me in your silence, rape me in your tears
Let the sea of sadness free the chosen one
Legacy of horror, manifest the son
