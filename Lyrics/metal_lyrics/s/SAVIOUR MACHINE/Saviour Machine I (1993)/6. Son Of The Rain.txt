Rain, falls on the ones who remain
Calls unto those who will learn
The sky will burn, the sky will burn
Burning the sight from your eyes
Burning the blood from the brain
Turning the force of the skies
While watching the world go insane

Watching the sea boil from the rain
Watching the free die in the mire
Watching the world melt by the fire

That burns in the night, and burns by the light
that torches your face, and scorches your mind
Till you soul lays to waste in its tortured remains
Shelter the sane, Shelter the sane, Shelter the sane
From the Son of the Rain
Set the controls for the heart of the Son
Set the controls for the heart of the Liar
Set the controls for the Sons of the fire

That burns in the night, and burns by the light
That torches your face, and scorches your mind
Till you soul lays to waste in the tortured remains
Shelter the sane, Shelter the sane, Shelter the sane
From the Son of the Rain
