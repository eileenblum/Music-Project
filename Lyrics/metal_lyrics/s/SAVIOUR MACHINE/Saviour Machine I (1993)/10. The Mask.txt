Sounds in the attic
See inside the show
Watch as you go
Watch as you go

Trapped in some place
The entity fades

Watch them crawl on me
Claiming redemption
They're coming to your town

There's nothing inside
There's nowhere to hide

Assassination
When the Mask came off

Lurking in the doorway
I saw him hang by the power
Covered in scabs
Covered in scabs
Covered in faceless Masks of men

Assassination
When the Mask came off
