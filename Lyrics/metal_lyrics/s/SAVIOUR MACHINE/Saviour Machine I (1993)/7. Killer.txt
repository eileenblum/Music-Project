Killer, killer
Killer lives in silent dreams
Of genocide philosophy rebirth
Killer, killer
Killer lies in frightened eyes
Obsessed with words that terrorize the earth

Killer hides inside of the dead
Killer walks in fear of his own
Killer judges all that is said
Killer doesn't see what is shown

Killer is dying within
Killer is taking the soul from the man
Killer is stalking again
Killer is breaking the heart of his plan

Pray for the killer
Pray for his son
Pray for the killer
Pray for his day to be done

Killer's face is ominous
Killer's heart is black
Killer's mind is on the loose
Killer will attack
Killer can't communicate
Killer can't investigate
Killer will interrogate
Killer will annihilate

Killers run like insects to destroy the battle cry
Killers use their influence to animate the sky

Killer's high anxiety becomes obsessed with therapy
Killer's insecurity paints the wall with purity

Killers aren't diverted from their mission to destroy
Assigned to the demoralized
The course of dreamers hypnotized

Killer's promiscuity infects his false security
When forced to use his intellect
To trace the path of righteousness

Killers build their ladders to the sky
To stand in judgment over high
Across the galaxy of fear
That brings the criminal to tears

Stare into the killer's eyes
Stare into the killer's eyes

Stare into his eyes
Stare beyond his lies

Is it time for the end
For the wounds to be mend
And the servant to bleed from within

Is there truth in his words
Proof of return
Has the killer surrendered to sin

Has the killer betrayed
Has the killer enslaved
Has he stolen the eyes from his son

In the wake of the trial
In the hands of denial
Lies the killer and all that is one

Pray for the killer
Pray for this son
Pray for the killer
Pray for his day to be done
