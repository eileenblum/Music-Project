the possibilities they seem to offer
i've drawn the line of violation
the soul tranquility
these forbidden tears
that flow my way
are bent in emptiness
it takes a part of me
and holds my under
endlessly, possessing me
a rainbow soon appears
the colors fade to black
within the slash of fear
the others bleed together
shattered dreams, in eternal void
ask the question why
is this the speed of life
crashing evermore
within the speed of life
crashing evermore
