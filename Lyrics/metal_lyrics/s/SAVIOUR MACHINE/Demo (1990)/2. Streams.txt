It's the light that surrounds you
The light that commands you to fight
Fight to find the answer
Fight to the door
Through all eternal question
Through vision of no more
Tears of pain
Fears insane
Tears of pain
Bring the reign
My powers feed the streams
My powers hold the dreams
My love I lay upon you
My eyes have seen the king
Free the fighting within you
The fighting may take you to Hell
And Hell is all around us
The Saviour lies within
Within the soul the answer
The dawn of life begins
Touch the flame.
