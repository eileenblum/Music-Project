through the night, i see the door
i see the love transcending through
the air
through the pain, i call his name
i see the light can lift me from the
shadows
surrendering all that i have
vision, reflecting through all that i am
knowledge, conceived by the touch of
his hand
surrender for the answer
lies within his eyes
the door opens to vision beyond
rise, above the night
into the light
fly, arrows of desire
the clouds unfold, into my fire
by the grace of light
my soul awake, arise today
he blew the breath of life
into my hands, a prophecy
through the strength
through the soul
without fear, my destiny awaits
through my fate, they guard the gate
to drive the angel from the door
within you
transcendence in love will avail
unto the promise, the soul will prevail
into dimensions above mortal hell
