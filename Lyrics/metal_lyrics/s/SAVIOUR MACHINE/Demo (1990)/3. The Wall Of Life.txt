Is there no fear of God
Before your eyes
Through his law comes knowledge
Through his eyes seek immortality
Through eternal life
For passing judgement on him
You condemn yourself beyond
the wall of life...
Beyond the wall of life
My flesh will dwell in hope
Justified through words
Written on my heart
My truth abounds to his glory
My throat an open grave
We are justified by faith
Through him we have obtained
The access to his grace
In which we stand
My children, this is the final hour
And this is the Antichrist
He who denies the Father
and the Son.
