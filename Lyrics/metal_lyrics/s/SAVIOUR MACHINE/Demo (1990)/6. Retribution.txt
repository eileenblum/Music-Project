my remorse is endless
as i watch my children
perish by my hand
not even the tears from my
eyes can stop the fire
touch my bloodstained hands
wipe away the tears of retribution
born into vast plains of fire
beyond the reach of infinite mercy
they stand in desperation
nameless forever more
touch my bloodstained hands
wipe away the tears of retribution
