And the children shall lead the angels at play
In the fields of slaves.
For man is the hunted, accused and forsaken and slain
By his own domain.
The diamond's edge will cut the eyes of the paper mask
In paradise.
The fools of fortune paint their portraits
On carnal crimes and lonely lies.

The tides of war that crash within,
to break the heart and lash the skin,
A man awaits the child inside,
To end his bloody reign in time.

Love never dies - Love never denies,
Love never lies - Love desperately cries,
Unto the other side,
Unto the unborn child in your eyes.

Walk by faith and walk by sight,
You're sanctified with blood and light,
In days of roses, nights sublime,
The prince of passion lives divine.

Love never dies - Love never denies,
Love never lies - Love desperately cries,
Unto the other side,
Unto the unborn child in your eyes.
