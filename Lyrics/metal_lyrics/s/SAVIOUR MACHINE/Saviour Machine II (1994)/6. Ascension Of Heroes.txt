I've heard the silence of the angels,
I've seen betrayed my faith in men
And their conditions of salvation
In which so blindly they defend.

Touch the light that crawls from the page,
Ascension of heroes strengthen the saints
Ascension of heroes that call from the stage.

The tyrant, he lives and dies by the sword,
He has painted his face and tainted the lord,
Into the arena, his faith is restored.

The mortal storm of fear that wages their will
To take away your names will keep the phantoms
In their cages and cast the children into the flames.

Touch the light that crawls from the page,
Ascension of heroes strengthen the saints
Ascension of heroes that call from the stage.

I've loved you with all my heart and my soul,
The conflict within is leading me home,
The ghost and the godsend are standing alone,
The birth of a new world awaits in your hands,
With only your hopes and your dreams may you stand.

Ascension of heroes - Are waiting command,
Ascension of heroes - Awaiting the stand.
