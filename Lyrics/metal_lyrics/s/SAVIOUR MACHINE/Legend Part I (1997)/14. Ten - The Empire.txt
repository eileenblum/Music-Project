The beast shall rise from the sea of nations,
Aligned for the sign of the times.
The teeth of iron will devour the earth
That its fierce countenance crucifies.
Beneath the fire of the grand design,
The throne is burning inside.
Ten men, united the empire,
Revived, rising alive.

And they shall be of one mind and one power.
And they shall be given into his hand.

Ten kings will stand,
Ten nations will command
The empire of dreams.
One peace, one land,
One beast, one man.

A prince will rise from the ancient empire
To rule the dominion of pain.
He speaks the lies and by peace he destroys
To gain the unchallenged domain.
He shall go forth to conquer the stage,
Seven years, heaven's tears are sealed.
And let no man be deceived, for the day
Will not come until the one is revealed.

the man of sins is the son or perdition.
The prince of darkness will live under his name.

One king will reign,
One kingdom will remain.
The birth of the beast
In thee, in vain,
In he, insane.

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in hell.
