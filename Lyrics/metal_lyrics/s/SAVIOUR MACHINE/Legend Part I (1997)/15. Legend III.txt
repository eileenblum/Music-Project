I will rise through the earth,
I will live through the sea,
I will love you through the darkest age,
I shall stand in the way of the light,
I shall conquer this stage with the night.

I am the prince of the power of the air,
The son of transition.
I am the way in the silence of one,
"I am Night," A legend has come.

Follow me through the flame,
Come with me in the name
Of my father and the morning star.
I am the desolate one, sold to thee.
I am Lucifer's son, behold the seed.

Fallen from grace is the name of the Christ,
Idle the shepherd that leads,
Riding a white horse, the bringer of dreams.
"Ride away," A legend has come.
