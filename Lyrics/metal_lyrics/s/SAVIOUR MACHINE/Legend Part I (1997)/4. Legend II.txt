I will show you what must take place,
I who speak to you am He.
I am the Alpha and the Omega
I am the first and the last, I am alive.
I am the blood of the lamb, I am life.

I am the son of man,
The first born of the dead.
I have the keys of life and death.

I am why a legend is born.

I am coming with the the clouds of heaven
And every eye shall see
Through the darkness of the night.
I am the light of the world, come to see,
I am the king of kings, follow me.

He who believes in me
Shall live beyond the dead
For I am with you until the end.

I am why a legend is born.

A legend is born
