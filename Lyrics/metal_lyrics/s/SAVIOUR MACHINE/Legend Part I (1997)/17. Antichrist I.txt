My name - My face - My eyes - My rage -
My flesh - My blood - My father - My God -
My horror.

My mouth - My words - My image - My world -
My throne - My reign - My empire - My pain -
My terror.
My kingdom come, my will be done,
My power will call, my mark for all,
My forces will command, my law, my hand,
My legend, my thorns, my legacy, my horns.

My wound - My head - My sword - My death -
My body - My misery - My rapture - My mystery

My children - My sacrifice - My temple - My soul device -
My hatred - My sins - My life blood begins...

Behold, God's grace is gone, his face
Is all that I desire to see.
Behold the deceiver must come unto be.
Behold, I will drive the nails deeper into thee.

Until your rotting carcass covers me in blood.

Behold, time is legend, and history is time,
This hour is mine.
