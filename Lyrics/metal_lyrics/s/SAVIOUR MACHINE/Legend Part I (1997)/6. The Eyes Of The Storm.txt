This is history, the evidence is time,
The evidence is time.
This is the end, it is imminent,
It is imminent.

The course is chosen, it cannot be turned,
The way has been prepared,
The way has been prepared.

All the world is a stage
In the Eyes of the Storm.

We've been training since the fall of man,
The fall of man.
Peace is the elusive dream, we have turned,
We have turned
On ourselves.

We have not learned from the past
Nor have we seen the warnings of the future,
The warnings of the future.

All the world is a stage
In the Eyes of the Storm.

The world all of history has been
Moving toward is upon us, upon us...
