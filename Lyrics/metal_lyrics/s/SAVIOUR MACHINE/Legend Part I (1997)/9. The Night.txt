The events about to unfold
Are beyond comprehension.
In this hatred escalating
The fate is the same.
Here we stand defiled to the brink
Of our self-annihilation.
We are vicious animals
In a game with no name.

Behold the place of slaughter,
The earth is a tomb.
The smell of death upon her,
The child has torn the womb.

Let all of us prepare our doom.

Nowhere to run, no place to hide,
We cannot escape the night.

The perilous atomic rage
Shall usher in the age.
The wicked shall be turned to hell,
The wasteland in a cage.

Behold the forced abortion,
The murder in the air,
The atmosphere in motion,
The paralyzing fear.

Let all the men of war draw near.
