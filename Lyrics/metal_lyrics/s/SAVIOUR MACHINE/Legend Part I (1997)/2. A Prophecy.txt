I saw a lamb standing
As though it had been slain;
Seven horns and seven eyes remain.
The son of man, the first born of the dead;
Knowledge will pass through him
In a veil bound in ashes.

Blessed are those who hear;
Keep what is written for the time in near.
He who has an ear, let him hear
The footsteps of Christ
As he approaches the doors of heaven to return.

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven.
Lead us to the edge of life and death;
Bound by ears of wisdom.
Give us this day, give us the strength
To reach out and touch the of God.
