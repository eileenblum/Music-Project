I feel the power surrounding
the sound of my heart, in the night
I'm looking afraid in your eyes
I can hear the voice of the doom

Guardians Of SIGMA
We're saving Our stone, but

Nothing is sure until sunrise
Fire will burn your heart,
but you can stop it
Nothing is sure until we fight
Don't you know that all my heroes died

From ashes goes out the SIGMA
And now we can stop every wars
The sky is turning to dark
There's no time to loose, for my soul

Guardians Of SIGMA
We're saving Our stone, but

Nothing is sure until sunrise
Fire will burn your heart,
but you can stop it
Nothing is sure until we fight
Don't you know that all my heroes died
