Darkness...
Holy visions in this night of Sadness
I can hear my heartbeat in this Silence
Day by day I try to find my way
Madness...
When all you can see bring you to Sadness
I shut os up inside this prison
Every day I try to see your face

Every day has a meaning
Now I can hear your voice that calls me

Help me to beat him
You can't deny me
King of the nightmares
Help me to be free

Darkness...
Creatures of the night bring me to Fateless
I have lost the way to win my enemy
I'm searching the key to unlock this door

Every day has a meaning
Now I can hear your voice that calls me

Help me to beat him
You can't deny me
King of the nightmares
Help me to be free

[SOLO]

Every day has a meaning
Now I can hear your voice that calls me

Help me to beat him
You can't deny me
King of the nightmares
Help me to be free
