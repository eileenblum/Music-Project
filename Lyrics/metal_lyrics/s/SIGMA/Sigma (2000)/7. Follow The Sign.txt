Oh mirror show me
what my heart is looking for
More seas of tears,
I cried but now I'm here 
Give me a reason,
or something into believe
Down on my knees I wonder
what Lord is doing to me

Out of your cage
You're not a number
Breaking your chains

Follow the sign
Try to find the way,
you fly on the wings of fantasy
again

10.000 faces with no name
I meet before
Where is the sky,
where damns and angels fly?
Saints and sinners,
an answer is what we need
Don't break the spell,
look in my eyes and speak to me

Out of your cage
You're not a number
Breaking your chains

Follow the sign
Try to find the way,
you fly on the wings of fantasy
Freedom
It's only a word but should be reality,
for human being

[SOLO]

Out of your cage
You're not a number
Breaking your chains

Follow the sign
Try to find the way,
you fly on the wings of fantasy
Freedom
It's only a word but should be reality,
for human being
Run 'til the end of time,
you're searching a destiny
Free
Spread your wings and let your fantasy,
try to believe
