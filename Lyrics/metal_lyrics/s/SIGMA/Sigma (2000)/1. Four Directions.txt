Right, where the thoughts are free
Left is always screaming
You must understand
Up in the sense of God
Down is always crying
Choose your destination

Free to understand
Which is the way
It's not enough
Choose one of four directions

There will be Four choices
in every case For your own life
For your mind style
For saving your soul
No one tell you the way
Many voices in your brain
You can never turn you back
