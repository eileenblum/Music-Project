Early in the bed this morning,
no lights on the wall
All is changed, all was floating,
and you blind can't see

There's no moving you can do
Some is changed your faith
Change your faith at all

Walking, touching, silent speaking,
find yours shield and sword
No more castle, no more kingdom,
all illusion there

Maybe someone drives you mad
Laughing on your back
Laughing playing a game

Where are you now,
which is the right escape
From this labyrinth of minded walls
Why am I here?
The sense and the fears
I won't loose again and never more

Find two doors and choose the first
and stairs goes down and down
In the secrets, in the low floor,
someone screams your name

Now it is arrived the time
Clock strikes always "1"
All it will be done

Why don't you see,
too many things you leave
But no one is great as "human being"
If you will know,
to understand the way
And the morning light will shine again

[SOLO]

Where are you now,
which is the right escape
From this labyrinth of minded walls
Why am I here?
The sense and the fears
I won't loose again and never more
Why don't you see,
too many things you leave
But no one is great as "human being"
If you will know,
to understand the way
And the morning light will shine again

Four directions, four dimensions,
four positions, light wins darkness
Your directions, your dimensions,
your positions, thoughts wins madness
