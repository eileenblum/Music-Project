Ride like the wind
to the nowhere land
Sliding away
on the edge of the time

I see the stars come to me
I hear your voice that call me

Words in the wind
talk me about my faith
Air on my face
in this mystical night

I follow your voice in this silence
Don't smother my hope again

I'm running in the night until tomorrow
Flying on the road through this place
Playing again, until tomorrow
I'll find myself in this way

Mechanical
music beats on me
Moonlight on the lake,
the blur of landscape

I've seen this place whenever
I'll keep this faith forever

I'm running in the night until tomorrow
Flying on the road through this place
Playing again, until tomorrow
I'll find myself in this way

On the wings of destiny
I try to back again, again

[SOLO]

I've seen this place whenever
I'll keep this faith forever

I'm running in the night until tomorrow
Flying on the road through this place
Playing again, until tomorrow
I'll find myself in this way
Ride in the night until tomorrow
The sun starts to rise,
we will run again
We will ride until daylight
