Long will be the time of truth
Where the tails will be forgotten, by all
Out now you can see

There're too many lies
You feel
There're too many signs

There will be
another world and life
Without lies, hates and jealousies
No more tears
and no more fears at all
Where the law will be a legacy

No one will kill another
for a piece of bread Or having toys
for children
But now you can see

There're too many things
The worse
Never gives the paid

There will be
another world and life
Without lies, hates and jealousies
No more tears
and no more fears at all
Where the law will be a legacy

[SOLO]

You see
There're too many lies
You feel
There're too many signs

There will be
another world and life
Without lies, hates and jealousies
No more tears
and no more fears at all
Where the law will be a legacy
