I still remember you that night
Like a star you come undone
We broke that silent ice
I saw my soul alone
Living now the past behind
The turning point has gone
Fade away in a blink of eyes
Until we'll break these chains

I'll stand by you forever

When you're hurting hard inside
I can feel you coming closer
And when you feel cold outside
My heart is afraid

Can you hear me calling tonight
I am lost as a wandering blind

Fading memories shining bright
Like a star into the night
They are tearing me apart
I'm lost without you
Fading memories shining bright
Like a fire in the night
Now I know if it's true
I can't live without you
