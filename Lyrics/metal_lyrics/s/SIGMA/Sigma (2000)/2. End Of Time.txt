I can't see the future
But now I see wasted time
This makes me smile
See this strange poor people
Running away without home
I hear their crying
every day and night
Try to pray with me
'til the end of time

My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm fighting for a people
There's not much time
My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm killing for a people
'til the end of life

Push the first red button
Feel the death into my hands
This makes me cry
Think to nameless children
Blame me bad for another crime
I hear they cry
And that's the hardest price
Can you forgive me?
'til the end of time

My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm shooting for a people
There's not much time
My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm crying for a people
'til the end of life

[SOLO]
My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm fighting for a people
There's not much time
My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm killing for a people
'til the end of life
My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm shooting for a people
There's not much time
My time is gone
the battle has just began
I'm crying
