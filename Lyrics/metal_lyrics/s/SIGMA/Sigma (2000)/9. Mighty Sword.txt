The people wait afraid
The arrival of the "cruel knight"
"cruel knight"
The silence winds the night
And they are ready to the fight
oh no!

...and like in a nightmare,
you are ready to die
There's no time to pray,
now it's time to wake up
And kill to be free

Raise your mighty sword to the enemy
The blade reflect the moonlight
Lead your warriors to the final ride
You gotta fight until you die
until you die

The death is coming down
From every corner of the land
The blood is flowing down
But there's no fear into your heart

Thunders strikes the sky
and light up the field
You can see your enemy,
now it's time to strike him
And kill to be free

Raise your mighy sword to the enemy
The blade reflects the moonlight
Lead your warriors to the final ride
You gotta fight until you die
until you die

[SOLO]

...and like in a nightmare,
you are ready to die
There's no time to pray,
now it's time to wake up
And kill to be free

Raise your mighty sword to the enemy
The blade reflects the moonlight
Lead your warriors to the final ride
You gotta fight until you die
until you die
