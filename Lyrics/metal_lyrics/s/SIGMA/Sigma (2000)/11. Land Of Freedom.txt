Feel the fire
In my hands
Fell the power
Feel the strenght
Hear me screaming
On the hill
Now it's time
Stand up and fight

Now I can see you through the darkside
Now I can see you through my mind

Land of freedom is a place with no fear
Where you can find our shelter
Feel the power now surrounding us
And forever we'll be free

Burn these flames
Deep me inside
Steel the fire
The final ride
Hear the thunder
Up the hill
Armageddon
Is just near

Now I can see you through the darkside
Now I can see you through my mind

Land of freedom is a place with no fear
Where you can find our shelter
Feel the power now surrounding us
And forever you'll be free

[SOLO]

Land of freedom is a place in your heart
Where your mighty sword keeps silent
Feel the power now surrounding us
And forever you'll be free
