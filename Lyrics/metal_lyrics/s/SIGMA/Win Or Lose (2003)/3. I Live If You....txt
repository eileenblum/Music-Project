Largest than my eyes can see,
Deeper than the deepest sea.
Words are not enough to explain you all,
I mean I'm talkin' about love.

Touch me - Please me - Speak to me.
Over hills and over dales, I will be with you.

I LIVE IF YOU LIVE.
I CRY IF YOU CRY.

Remember when you will be alone,
I'd kill a thousand for one.
You're the one, who can makes me smile again,
I'm the relief of your pain.

Touch me - Please me - Speak to me.
Over hills and over dales, I will be with you.

I LIVE IF YOU LIVE.
You have my soul behind.
I CRY IF YOU CRY.
My mother's love is in you.
I LIVE IF YOU LIVE.
You have my soul behind.
I CRY IF YOU CRY.
You have my love inside.
OH-O-O-OH

[Solos]

Trust in me - Please me - Follow me.
Over hills and over dales, I will be with you.

I LIVE IF YOU LIVE.
You have my soul behind.
I CRY IF YOU CRY.
My mother's love is in you.
I LIVE IF YOU LIVE.
You have my soul behind.
I CRY IF YOU CRY.
You have my love inside. - My love is forever
