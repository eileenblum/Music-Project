Looking thru these eyes, what can you see?
Now these plagues are all on your screaming skin.
There is no safe place where you can go,
To recover, Holy water sanctified your sin.

In the name of God, why do we have to cry?
In the name of God, why do we have to die?

FAITH SHINES ON ME,
AND THE FAITH SHINES ON YOU!
AND BE SAFE IN A NEW BRAVE WORLD.
FAITH SHINES ON ME,
AND THE FAITH SHINES ON YOU!
AND BE SAFE IN A NEW BRAVE WORLD.

Now the heat is rising down the streets,
While the bloody demons stick their hooks in deep.
It's contagious, wind brings sound of bell.
Everybody has to carries his cross to hell!

In the name of God, why do we have to cry?
In the name of God, why do we have to die?

FAITH SHINES ON ME,
AND THE FAITH SHINES ON YOU!
AND BE SAFE IN A NEW BRAVE WORLD.
FAITH SHINES ON ME,
AND THE FAITH SHINES ON YOU!
AND BE SAFE IN A NEW BRAVE WORLD.

[Solos]

In the name of God, why do we have to cry?
In the name of God, why do we have to die?

FAITH SHINES ON ME,
AND THE FAITH SHINES ON YOU!
AND BE SAFE IN A NEW BRAVE WORLD.
FAITH SHINES ON ME,
AND THE FAITH SHINES ON YOU!
AND BE SAFE IN A NEW BRAVE WORLD.
