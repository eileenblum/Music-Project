All I want is just to live my life in peace,
But the worst is still to come, I wait for my rest.
I fell like a leaf carried by the wind;
Carried as far as the eye can reach! Oh, No!
Father don't leave me alone,
Can you guide my choice?
Father the night has to come,
Can anybody hear me?

Wearing your black dress to defend my lonely soul.
The die is cast and now is time to go away.
A long slope is the way to reach heaven, (or hell!)
Too many steps for my tired legs.

Father don't leave me alone,
Can you guide my choice?
Father the night has to come,
Can anybody hear me?

HOW CAN I LIVE WITH THIS PAIN?
HIGH WAS THE PRIZE THAT I PAID,
To live in this way!
HOW CAN I WALK DOWN THIS WAY?
FELLS LIKE A TEAR IN THE RAIN...
That's fallin' tonight!

Father don't leave me alone,
Can you guide my choice?
Father the night has to come,
Please Father tell me...

HOW CAN I LIVE WITH THIS PAIN?
HIGH WAS THE PRIZE THAT I PAID,
To live in this way!
HOW CAN I WALK DOWN THIS WAY?
FELLS LIKE A TEAR IN THE RAIN...
That's fallin' tonight!
