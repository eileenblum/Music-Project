In the battle I am the first but in love,
I am the last.
Silk on the body and gold in my hands,
But now what remain are grains of sand.

Where can I run with this pain in my heart?
I feel like a blind man, I'm lost in the dark.
No one can hear my voice in the night,
I wait in the dark for your light.

HOW MANY DAYS ARE GONE?
AND ANYWAY THEY ARE LOST.
PRAY FOR THE WASTED TIME,
LYIN' IN THE LAP OF GOD.

An ear of corn is more important than me,
Water is all it needs.
Sometimes I wonder why I have to survive
If all my past life was a crime?

Where can I run with this pain in my heart?
I feel like a blind man, I'm lost in the dark.
King of the mountains and of the blue sky,
Please lay your hands on me

HOW MANY DAYS ARE GONE?
AND ANYWAY THEY ARE LOST.
PRAY FOR THE WASTED TIME,
LYIN' IN THE LAP OF GOD.

"I'm ashamed for the man I was before!
Would you accept a pray from a man, who lived in sin?"

...A pray from a man who lived in sin?

[Solos]

HOW MANY DAYS ARE GONE?
AND ANYWAY THEY ARE LOST.
PRAY FOR THE WASTED TIME,
LYIN' IN THE LAP OF GOD.

HOW MANY DAYS ARE GONE?
AND ANYWAY THEY ARE LOST.
PRAY FOR THE WASTED TIME,
LYIN' IN THE LAP OF GOD.
