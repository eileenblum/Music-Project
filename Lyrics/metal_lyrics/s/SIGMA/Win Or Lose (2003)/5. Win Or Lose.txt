Don't speak and listen to what I say,
Sit down and look into my eyes.
In a low voice I know that you will pray,
Lost in the storm looking for bay.

Enemies died all long time ago,
Now I'm the last one in this place.
Like in a circle, there's no begin and there's no end,
Laugh or tears for me is the same.

Remember I'm waiting for your move!
There is one solution and you have to choose...

WIN OR LOSE

Sometimes the bill is more expensive than you wish,
And all I have wasn't for free.
I feel the power running into my veins,
But I can't fight against the wind.

Remember I'm waiting for your move!
There is one solution and you have to choose...

WIN OR LOSE
Eye for eye. - Blood for blood.
WIN OR LOSE
First and last real law!

Shadows are dancing all over the walls,
You are a screaming body with no soul!
Light on the right side! - Sun on my face!
But I'll never see it anymore...

[Solos]

Remember I'm waiting for your move!
There is one solution and you have to choose...
AAAAAH!!

Remember I'm waiting for your move!

WIN OR LOSE
Eye for eye. - Blood for blood.
WIN OR LOSE
First and last real law!
