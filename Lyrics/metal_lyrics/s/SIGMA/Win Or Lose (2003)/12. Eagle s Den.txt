King of a wild bunch, that's all I wanted to be.
Spending my time between women and crimes,
I like to work with my knife.

So much wine that I get drunk,
As much money as I want.
I speak and whatever I want will be under my feet!

IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
I'M HUNTING FROM THE NIGHT 'TILL THE DAWN
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
FROM DARKNESS TO THE SUN

As the wild tiger is proud when it catches the prey,
The seed of evil grows up in me every day!

Heaven's gates are closed for us,
No excuses for what we have done.
My destiny is surely to hear the hiss of a noose!

IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
I'M HUNTING FROM THE NIGHT 'TILL THE DAWN
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
DON'T SLEEP WHEN THE JACKAL COMES - Yeah!

[Solos]

Hmmm!
We are at the end, and now it's time to go.
Sure that I lived every day as it would be the last.

It's not so easy to accept,
That all this you'll soon forget.
I paid in blood one way ticket straight to hell! - Oh Yeah! Hell!

IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
I'M HUNTING FROM THE NIGHT 'TILL THE DAWN
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
FROM DARKNESS TO THE SUN

IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
I'M ON THE PROWL FROM NIGHT UNTILL THE DAWN
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EAGLE'S DEN
FROM DARKNESS I'LL RETURN - OOOH!

AH AH AH AH!
