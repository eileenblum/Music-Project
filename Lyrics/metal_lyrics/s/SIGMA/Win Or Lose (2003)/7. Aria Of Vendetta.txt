When I was young
There were no clouds in my sky
When I grew up,
I said: "you will be mine"
There are promises
I made to your heart
In the name of the Lord and the stars

Day after day
And night after night
I'm working hard
All for your eyes
But having not so much
All I have now is yours
Let me be your man and let me start

Long is the story, story of my life
Tell me why I paid this price.
Me and my loneliness,
Side by side walk down this way.

Yesterday I can't forget;
Today I don't know and
In tomorrow I believe.

Blow wind - Take me away,
From this land where...
Where I have nothing to say.
I'll miss you friends of mine,
I won't see you anymore.

For all the evil I have done,
And for all the good things
That I've never done.

WAIT! MY LOVE.
PROMISES ARE LOST IN VAIN.
ALL THESE PEOPLE WILL NEVER,
...NEVER UNDERSTAND MY PAIN.

Wait! My Love. Wait for me.
'Cause I'll be back
To let our dreams become true.
I'll work just for your eyes,
And no one will change our fate.

I will protect our love,
And who is against us
Will taste his red blood.

WAIT! MY LOVE.
PROMISES ARE LOST IN VAIN.
ALL THESE PEOPLE WILL NEVER,
...NEVER UNDERSTAND MY PAIN.

[Solos]

Long is my story, but it will end
When I'll have many to say.
My hope will never end,
Day by day I face the sky.

Don't forget that I'll be back,
Today or tomorrow
I'll have my revenge.

WAIT! MY LOVE.
PROMISES ARE LOST IN VAIN.
ALL THESE PEOPLE WILL NEVER,
...NEVER UNDERSTAND MY PAIN.

WAIT FOR ME, MY LOVE!
PROMISES ARE LOST IN VAIN.
ALL THESE PEOPLE WILL NEVER,
...NEVER UNDERSTAND MY PAIN.
