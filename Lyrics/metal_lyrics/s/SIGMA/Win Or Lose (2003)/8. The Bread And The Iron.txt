Voices and streets full of eyes,
This life is a race, and you have to run.
You, who have seen Your son dying,
You know what I feel hearing my child cry.

Tell me where I've to go.
Tonight I forgot the sign of the cross.
All I ask You is...

I heard someone call me liar,
My eyes on fire, now I'm alone.
My hands, that work all day
And the whole night pray, are now red with blood.

Tell me where I've to go.
Tonight I forgot the sign of the cross.
All I ask You is...

WHY CAN'T I LIVE WITHOUT BLADE IN HANDS?
FALLING RAIN CANNOT CLEAN MY SOUL.
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME IN THIS LAND.
ALL I'VE DONE WAS FOR A PIECE OF BREAD.

Tell me where I've to go.
Tonight I forgot the sign of the cross.
All I ask You is...

WHY CAN'T I LIVE WITHOUT BLADE IN HANDS?
FALLING RAIN CANNOT CLEAN MY SOUL.
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME IN THIS LAND.
ALL I'VE DONE WAS FOR A PIECE OF BREAD.

WHY CAN'T I LIVE WITHOUT BLADE IN HANDS?
FALLING RAIN CANNOT CLEAN MY SOUL.
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME IN THIS LAND.
ALL I'VE DONE WAS FOR A PIECE OF BREAD.
