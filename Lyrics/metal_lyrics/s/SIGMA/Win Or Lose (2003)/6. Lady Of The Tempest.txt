Suddenly I heard your voice,
Warmer than the desert wind.
I knew that I had no choice,
On my heart you had carved your seal.

Slave without chains - Can you help me?
Now it's too late - Shouting in the dark!

How can I judge what you have done?
Now that I've looked at your face.
Livin' every day as the last one,
No sorrow for our disgrace.

Slave without chains - Can you help me?
Now it's too late - All I can tell is...

OPEN YOUR LITTLE WINGS,
AND FLY AWAY LADY OF THE TEMPEST.
OF YOUR CAGE I HOLD THE KEY.
THE LADY OF THE TEMPEST IS FREE,
AS ALL OF HER SECRET DREAMS.

Love is a mysterious thing,
But it is an hard game to play.
Close our secret in this ring,
And behind the scene we'll remain.

Slave without chains - Can you help me?
Now it's too late - All I can tell is...

OPEN YOUR LITTLE WINGS,
AND FLY AWAY LADY OF THE TEMPEST.
OF YOUR CAGE I HOLD THE KEY.
THE LADY OF THE TEMPEST IS FREE.

Open your heart now,
I found the right way
For your love!

[Solos]

Open your heart now,
I found the right way
For your love!

OPEN YOUR LITTLE WINGS,
AND FLY AWAY LADY OF THE TEMPEST.
OF YOUR CAGE I HOLD THE KEY.
THE LADY OF THE TEMPEST IS FREE,
AS ALL OF HER SECRET DREAMS.

OPEN YOUR LITTLE WINGS,
AND FLY AWAY LADY OF THE TEMPEST.
OF YOUR CAGE I HOLD THE KEY.
THE LADY OF THE TEMPEST IS FREE.

Open your heart now,
I found the right way
For your love!
