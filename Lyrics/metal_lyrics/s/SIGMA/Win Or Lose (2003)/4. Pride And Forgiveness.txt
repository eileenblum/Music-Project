The shadow of my thought is flyin'
Towards the sea of memory.
My sin was to kill a man for pride,
So now I'm expiating

My soul was falling
Into my inner pain. - Oh!

I spent my life to pay my price.
I spent my life to fight for rights.
The Calling is my way of life.
Now I live to reach the God's Design.

The fate is drawing
A new high aim for me.

MY ANCIENT MEMORY WILL RIDE
ACROSS MY YOUNG AGE
AND MY FOOLISH PRIDE.
THIS BREAD IS STILL REMINDIN' ME,
THAT FORGIVENESS IS
FREEDOM FOR MY SOUL... (FROM MY SIN).

Feeling Grace in me,
Prayin' down on my knees;
For my heart, Mercy is the salvation!

[Solos]

I look with other eyes
What God dispose for me.

MY ANCIENT MEMORY WILL RIDE
ACROSS MY YOUNG AGE
AND MY FOOLISH PRIDE.
THIS BREAD IS STILL REMINDIN' ME,
THAT FORGIVENESS IS
FREEDOM FOR MY SOUL... (FROM MY SIN).

MY ANCIENT MEMORY WILL RIDE
ACROSS MY YOUNG AGE
AND MY FOOLISH PRIDE.
THIS BREAD IS STILL REMINDIN' ME,
THAT FORGIVENESS IS
FREEDOM FOR MY SOUL... (FROM MY SIN).

MY ANCIENT MEMORY WILL RIDE
ACROSS MY YOUNG AGE
AND MY FOOLISH PRIDE.
THIS BREAD IS STILL REMINDIN' ME,
THAT FORGIVENESS IS
FREEDOM FOR MY SOUL... (FROM MY SIN).

MY ANCIENT MEMORY WILL RIDE
