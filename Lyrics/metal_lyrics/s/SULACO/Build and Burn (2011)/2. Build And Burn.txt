donât even say what you donât mean
please donât even bother to look this way
the vines have been kind
cluing me in
on the hijinks in question
itâs weak fill
my ears
with shit
and then
shake my hand
while you burn
he will build
i know itâs heavy
get up and prove me wrong
a grim scene indeed
glad itâs not me
the haze and the crazy burning
sweating through the days
do it you wonât
too bad for you
so sorry for you
____________
i must find the next supply
i cannot fill
as hard as i try
