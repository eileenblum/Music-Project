hands and knees
iâm begging please
forgive me
i canât breathe
creep my way
and stand eye to eye
itâs not over
itâs never over
you just canât turn it off
thereâs too much going on
i canât see straight
my heads going to explode
all over the place
i think you know what i need
ease up the pace a bit
