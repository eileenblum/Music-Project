Running with the wind
On the heels of dreams
To strive and to create
To start over again
Building and growing
This bout should be gravy
These walls seem sturdy
They will come down, will come down
Must keep pushing
Not as easy at first glance
I could be passed
I'm winning the race
Enemy riding close behind
I'm still winning the race
You lose again, lose again
The glee is pouring out of me
Back to the beginning
