This nail is buried deep inside
Tearing through the roots
Let's resume the hunt, wait I'm tasting blood
Bad habits are hard to break
What's happening
Moving fast across the plains
Get it done before the dawn
So what if they stand afraid
So what if they stand alone
Sticks in my, sticks in my, sticks in my craw
Watching it all fall apart
Soon there will come a day
When it wont matter as much
