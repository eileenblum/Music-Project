A whisper in the wind, the lone chime
A tone I'll never hear again, the lone chime
The memories
Hearing sounds from down the street
Come back to me
Come back and set me free
By a thread with one left
Enough to sing one last song
By a thread with only one left
Enough to sing one last song
