Holding hands with the man who will surely ruin my whole life
Smile and laugh with the little ones
Waiting for a chance to shine down and take our minds.
Make your way with words carefree
That I can not explain
Let alone these but don't leave them alone
Get them home and crush all hope
Can't get away with this
You can't get away
Full of holes
Holding hands with the man
So full of holes
who will surely ruin my life
Smile and laugh with the little ones
You're so full of holes
Waiting for a chance to shine
