The sun comes up and the rain pours down
Behind the field is where he lives
While I sleep 
He awakes at the sound of the last drop
Lids fly open wide
Teary eyes start to cry
I'm afraid, but he's way too big to get inside
The earth shakes
I can not hide
Running from room to room
An eye in every window
Getting closer, breathing louder 
Running from room to room
Every window 
It leaves and returns with the rain
So where am I to go
An eye in every window
It leaves and returns with the rain
Still running from room to room
An eye in every window.
