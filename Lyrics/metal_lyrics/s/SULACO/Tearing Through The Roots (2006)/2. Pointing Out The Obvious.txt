I have said something you already know
And now your wheels are turning
On what sarcastic remark will spill out 
On what sarcastic remark will spill out your mouth
Damn you didn't know that you don't you know shit

Well you said something that you know it's obviously been pointed out
And now your wheels are starting to turn
Damn you don't know that, when you don't know shit 
Thank you again for pointing out the obvious
