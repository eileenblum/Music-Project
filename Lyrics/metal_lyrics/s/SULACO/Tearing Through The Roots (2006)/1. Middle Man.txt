Blowing up 
You need some help
I fly you buy
Price is a pinch
Middle man
Racing to get you what you need
Risking 
My own hide for your high
Don't know ( don't know if)
If he's (If he is)
Holding 
Or not (or not)
The middle man
Foggy road way hard to see
Drops give stoned eyes relief
The mission is almost complete
Hope you like better than before
