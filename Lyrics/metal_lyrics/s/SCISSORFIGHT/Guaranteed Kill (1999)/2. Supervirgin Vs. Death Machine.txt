Witch hunt
A social disease
Lights out
The killing spree
Has got to end
She stands
To stop this corruption
The spectre laughs
At the face of destruction

Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine
Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine
Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine

Hell bent
Don't get in the way
The planet's run
With the smell of decay
Air raids
A scene of disruption
The spectre laughs
At the face of destruction

Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine
Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine
Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine

I'll tell you all about it
Every city is now..
Count..
Down..
Out of control..

Witch hunt
A social disease
Lights out
The killing spree
Has got to end
She stands
To stop this corruption
The spectre laughs
At the face of destruction

Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine
Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine
Supervirgin Vs. Death Machine.
