It's not who you dance with
The back of the funhouse
She has hot pants
I thought it would be different
What we found
One way down
Lantern light in the night
In the trunk of the car
The sow is mine
The clown was wrong
It made us sick sick sick
What we found
One way down
Lantern light in the night
