Mountain man mountain man
Makes his living off the fat of the land
Mountain man mountain man
Drinks like a fish and hits like a ram
Mountain man mountain man
Out skinning beaver man whenever he can
Mountain man mountain man
Running through the woods with his dick in his hands
Hugh glass
Hauled ass
Up into a tree
Hugh glass
Found his ass
In the jaws of a grizzly
Alpine sunshine
Where's my scalp and where's my spine
