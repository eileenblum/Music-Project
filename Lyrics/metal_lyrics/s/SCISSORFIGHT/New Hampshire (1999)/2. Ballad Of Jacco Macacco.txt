Never in the history of dogfighting
Was it ever so exciting
As the day into the pit
Walked a monkey with a stick
The biting and the beating
Were not considered cheating
Ended in a flood
Of canine blood
Money
Put our money on the monkey
The monkey wins
Come on and place your bets
The monkey ain't lost yet
Victory repeated
Remaining undefeated
Wth the crowd screaming
The scary little demon
Throws a monkey fit
And monkey shit
Money
Put your money on the monkey
The monkey wins
