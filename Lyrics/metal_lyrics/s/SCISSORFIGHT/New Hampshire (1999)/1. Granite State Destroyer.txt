Weed, guns and axes
We don't pay our taxes
Because we don't exist
On any government list
We're survivalists
In the wilderness
Our battle cry
Live free or die
We've got a war to wage
Stand our ground
Mountain compound
When they storm the gate
We retaliate
You all will see
We make history
Our battle cry
Live free or die
We've got a war to wage
You want a war to wage
We'll give you a war to wage
