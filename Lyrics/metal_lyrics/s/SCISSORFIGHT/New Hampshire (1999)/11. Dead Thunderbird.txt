Horse hoofs kick the dust spitting in disgust
A shadow high is cast nothing meant that could not last
Ancient cycle flight glides into his sight
Crimson western sky misunderstood and so must die
Outlaw aimed high
And shot thunderbird right from the sky
Flying in the sun fire echoes from his gun
A shadow now is cast the bird is falling fast
Screaming all the way down crashes into the western ground
Skullbeak will see he always drinks for free
Outlaw aimed high
And shot thunderbird right from the sky
