Atmospheric skull
Haunting in this hull
Black flag flying high
Most horrible way to die
Terror of the seas
Unspeakable atrocities
Sounds of guns a'blazing
And shouts of 'l am amazing
The gruesome death of edward teach
Shark atlantic shore
Seen this ship before
Drink killdevil flips
And climb aboard the ships
Smoking hempcord fear
And loud the drunken cheer
Of pirates on the waves
Sending them to ocean graves
The gruesome death of edward teach
Carolina sound
Blackbeard has been found
Eight musketballs he takes
Until his neckbone breaks
Cutting off his head
Turns the ocean red
Trophy on display
As his headless body swims away
The gruesome death of edward teach
