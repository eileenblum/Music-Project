Blast from the past
The governor of mass. can fucking kiss my ass
'Cause this is the sound
Going up an down
Your Massachusetts turnpike
What does it take to get riot out of me?
This is the sound that nobody digs
Back to attack
Those rip off sons of bitches mastered stabbing backs
'Cause this is the sound
As my head is kicking
Like a time bomb ticking
What does it take to get a riot out of me?
Who's up for offing some kicks?
Who's up for offing some kicks?
This is the sound that nobody digs
Bad acid trip
The eye of chaos put the masses to sleep
'Cause this is the sound 'cause what they're doing to language is so fucking offensive
Who's up for offing some kicks?
This is the sound that nobody digs
They seek their objective
There's just one question
What the fuck were they thinking?
What does it take to get a riot out of me?
This is the sound that nobody digs
Who's up for offing some kicks?
