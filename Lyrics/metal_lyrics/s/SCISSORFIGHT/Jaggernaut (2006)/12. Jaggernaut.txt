Run that body up a hill
You know I left it sitting still
Drag that thing all over town
When they hang me cut me down
Jaggernaut
Don't you ever stop
Round and round and round again
On the jag that never ends
Shoot my mouth off like a .38
I'm gonna drag my knuckles
Like a dirty ape
Jaggernaut
Don't you ever stop
What do you know well look who's here
You know the end is always near
I'm gonna stagger down that shining path
I'll have at you do the math
Jaggernaut
Don't you ever stop
Charge me with excessive force
I did enough to kill a horse
Laughing as I trip that sling
Break my foot off in everything
Jaggernaut
Don't you ever stop
