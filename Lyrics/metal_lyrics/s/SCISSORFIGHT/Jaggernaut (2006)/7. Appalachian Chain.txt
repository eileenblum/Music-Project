Up here on a mountain at high altitude
We got an eye on you
And that's no joking
6,288 feet to the winter peak
And that's some mountain
Hey- what's it take to get you high?
And make a fool out of the sky?
See the farthest reaches of the horizon lights
In the distant night
And that's not changing
Locate the Atlantic with the naked eye
In New England sky
And that's so ocean
Appalachian chain
Driving me insane
On the elevation of the Appalachian chain
Rising elevation of the ultimate height
It is out of sight
And that's not changing
Adverse conditions in the atmosphere
We got to get you here
We got to get you here
