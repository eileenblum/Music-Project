You must be crazy
Trying to take what is mine
You wanted hostile
Well then you've arrived
Yell "hello kevlar!"
There's no place you can hide
It's on this foot that dead men take their last ride
Backstabber
I'll make you be what you are
Madre de chinga
It ain't good for your health
To play the sucker eighty-sixing yourself
It's with this fist that your face will collide
It's on this foot that dead men take their last ride
No idle threat man
I can promise you that
You stab our backs
And we'll be kicking your ass
