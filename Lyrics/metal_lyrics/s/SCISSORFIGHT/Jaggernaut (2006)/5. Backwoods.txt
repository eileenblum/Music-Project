Danger is the man
Dynamite in hand
Hold the deer heart skyward
River of the pelts
Ammunition belts
Hold the deer heart skyward
Killing without fail
On the hell bent trail
A bear and lion dog slaughtered
Carnage in command
Deathlock on the land
All that was found was slaughtered
I heard a crashing in the pines
Panic screaming up their spines
Just another casuality
Of backwoods motherfuckery
Bad destructive jag
Carcasses were dragged
Death rising up skyward
Caving in the head
Of the thing half dead
Death rising up skyward
