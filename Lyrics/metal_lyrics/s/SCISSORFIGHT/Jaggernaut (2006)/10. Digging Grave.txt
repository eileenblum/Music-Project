Looks like a bad one today
Was never trying to get caught
On this ride of renegade
That I'm just dying to get off
Whiskey bent and hellbound
Come and get me fuckers
You'll never hold me down
Keep on digging my own grave
When everything is crashed into
You go and run that
Loud mouth train
The drunken monkey on my back
Will get you
Whiskey bent and hellbound
Come and get me fuckers
You'll never hold me down
Down at the old colony
An alcohol apocalypse
Another late night injury
Lets get it on if this it
Whiskey bent and hellbound
Come and get me fuckers
You'll never hold me down
