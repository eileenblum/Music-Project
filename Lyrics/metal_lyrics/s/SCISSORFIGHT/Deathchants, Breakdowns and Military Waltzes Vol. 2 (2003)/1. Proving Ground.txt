Yes we're all gonna fucking die
Before you kiss my ass goodbye
Riding home the strangest kind
Massacre the mountain mind

Prove, prove, nothing left to prove
Prove, prove, nothing left to lose

Banshee screams for Saturday night
The screaming eagle will take flight
Went to freeze turns to ice
Sell the same wolf said twice

Prove, prove, nothing left to prove
Prove, prove, nothing left to lose

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yes we're all gonna fucking die
But before you kiss my ass goodbye
Right before I hit the grave
Get my kicks fuckin' go in cave

Prove, prove, nothing left to prove
Prove, prove, nothing left to lose

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
