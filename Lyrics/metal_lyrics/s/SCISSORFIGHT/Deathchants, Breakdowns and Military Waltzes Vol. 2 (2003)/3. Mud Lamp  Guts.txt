In a fiery crash
Thats where they met their fate
And when they hit those brakes, man
Guess a little too fuckin' late

Mother fucker exploded [x4]
Die, die, die, die

Could you die in a mother fucking minute
Mother fucker burned With those mother fuckers in it, they died
Watch 'em die

In a fiery crash
Thats where they met their fate
And when they hit those brakes, man
I guess a little too fuckin' late

Mother fucker exploded [x4]
Die, die, die, die

Could you die in a mother fucking minute
Mother fucker burned With those mother fuckers in it, they died
Watch 'em die
