Hangin' anyone they want
The hangman's ghost will haunt ya
Hear the drunken crowd all shout
All the alcohols run out

Riot on the Village Green
Riot on the Village Green

Look around
Who run this town
Watch us burn to the ground

Burn it down
Burn it down

The flames can't get no higher
Even the town drunk is on fire
This pirate that they hung
They'll pay for what they've done

Riot on the Village Green
Riot on the Village Green

Look around
Who run this town
Watch me burn it to the ground

Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down

Riot on the Village Green
Riot on the Village Green

Look around
Who run this town
Watch us burn it to the ground

Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
