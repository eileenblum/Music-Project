They're out there waiting
Waiting for me
The sound of voices
It won't let me be

All kinds of weather
On all terrain
They always call me
I never complain

Cadaver recovery man
I'm a cadaver recovery man
Cadaver recovery man
I'm a cadaver recovery man

The dogs can't find 'em
They know that I can
If the dogs can't find 'em, I can

I've seen the toughest cop faces turn green
I've seen them vomit on every crime seen
Sixth sense it always, it always knows
Grave deep or shallow or decomposed

Cadaver recovery man
I'm a cadaver recovery man
Cadaver recovery man
I'm a cadaver recovery man

The dogs can't find 'em
They know that I can
If the dogs can't find 'em, I can

Cadaver recovery man
I'm a cadaver recovery man
Cadaver recovery man
I'm a cadaver recovery man

The dogs can't find 'em
They know that I can
If the dogs can't find 'em, I can
