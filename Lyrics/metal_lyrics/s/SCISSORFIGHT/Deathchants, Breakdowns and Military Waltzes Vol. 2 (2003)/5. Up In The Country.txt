The city was sinkin'
So I got out been truckin'
On down a country road

Wasn't livin' until I found out
What country livin'
Is really all about

Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country

The seasons are leavin'
But I did stop believin'
Then I think I will stay
When the nights start gettin' colder
Light the fire early October

Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country

The snow is still fallin'
The country is callin'
The country is ballin'
The country is callin'

Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country

When the nights start gettin' colder
Cows in the barn its early October

Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country
Now we're gettin' down
Up in the country

Get down
