Cult Extraction is a ball
We're always ready just give us a call
No jobs too tough to take
Brainwashed they always break

We extract
Bring them back
Deprogram
And thats a fact

In their face and in the clear
We make people disappear
Been stabbed, maced, puched, and shot
We've come close but we never been caught

They say it takes all kinds
Do this to poison minds
We cut the bullshit we cut through the lies
We always use the art of suprise

We extract
Bring them back
Deprogram
Thats a fact

Be un in back (?) they know that they've been
They always lose and we always win
No jobs too tough to take
Brainwashed they always break

We extract
Bring them back
Deprogram
Thats a fact

Guaranteed that they never return
Long after the cult has been burned
No jobs too tough to take
Brainwashed they always break

We extract
Bring them back
Deprogram
Thats a fact

A fact, fact, bring 'em back
