This is an evil place.
Don't you ever come 'round,
'cause if you ever show your face,
I'll be tracking you down.

The most dangerous animal is me.
The most dangerous animal is me.

Feel the evil
coming down.
You won't see me,
you won't hear a sound.
Feel the evil
coming down.

Creep and crawl and beware.
Out here is where I lurk,
and if you ever come 'round,
it's gonna drive me berserk.

The most dangerous animal is me.
The most dangerous animal is me.

Feel the evil
coming down.
You won't see me,
you won't hear a sound.

Feel the evil
coming down.

Don't come 'round.

The most dangerous animal is me.
The most dangerous animal is me.

Feel the evil
coming down.
You won't see me,
you won't hear a sound.

Feel the evil
coming down.
You won't see me,
you won't hear a sound.

Feel the evil
coming down.
You won't see me,
you won't hear a sound.

Feel the evil
coming down.

Don't you ever come 'round.
