The blizzard's moving in.
Looks like you're wrong again.
When cabin fever hits,
it sends us into fits
of innkeeper's disease
and screaming in the trees.
The blizzard never ends.
The blizzard buries them.

Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards.

The buzzard's crashing in.
Looks like you're wrong again.
Again, he's flying high.
He's lighting up the sky.
The buzzard does not fear
the man in riot gear.
Harvest the skull of stone.
The buzzard grows his own.

Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards.

(belch)

Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards.

The bastard's riding in.
Looks like you're wrong again.
Coy dogs and catamounts,
whiskey in large amounts.
Madmen and motorbikes,
waterhits and waterpipes.
When they're not passing out,
they'll smash your face right in.

Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards, bastards - yeah!
Blizzards, buzzards and bastards.

[Spoken:]
Get the fuck off my car, creep.
You heard me. I think you heard me.
I think you heard me.
