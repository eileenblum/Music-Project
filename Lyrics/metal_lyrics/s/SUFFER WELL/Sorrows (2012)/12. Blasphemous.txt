Before you walk headfirst into this nightmare of lies
Remember how it felt to live afraid to close your eyes.

Nothing comes easy.
How do you expect this world to bend to their knees?

No respect, for humanity 
Hatred is your faith
Don't we believe in what you see?

Nothing is truthful
Now do expect this world to crumble to your feet?

Now! I want to see these cities burn.
I want this balance of ignorance to fall,
And now I want your word to be silenced forever and never to return.
Never return. Stay silent don't ever return. Never return. 
Don't you ever return.

Nothing is truthful
Now do expect this world to crumble to your feet?

Now! I want to see these cities burn.
I want the balance of ignorance to fall,
And now I want your word to be silenced forever don't ever to return.

So fucking disgusting.
This vengeance of pain you have.
So fucking misleading.
And now you're all going to hell.

Nothing comes easy. Nothing is ever truthful.

Now! I want to see these cities burn.
I want this balance of ignorance to fall,
And now I want your word to be silenced forever don't ever return.

So fucking disgusting.
This vengeance of pain you have.
So fucking misleading.
And now you're all going to hell.
