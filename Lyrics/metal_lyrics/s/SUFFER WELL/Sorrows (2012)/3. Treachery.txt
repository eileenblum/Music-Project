Now this is betrayal
Treachery for the rest of your life
How many lives have you ruined?
Misled by a martyr that you disown

All sense of purpose
All - infected intent
All - deluded sense of persuasion
Ripping forth with a choking regret

Sometimes you're trapped in the silence
Between what is wrong and what's right
I know you just need to cave in
Remove the skin and just leave it behind

Leave me behind
Walk away, leave it behind

Now this deception
Ripping out the heart from your chest
Another crack in the armor
Now I want you to save your breath

All - this wasted emotion
All - pathetic attempts
All - empty sense of devotion
Ripping forth with a choking regret

Sometimes you're trapped in the silence
Between what is wrong and what's right
I know you just need to cave in
Remove the skin and just leave it behind

Leave me behind
Walk away, leave it behind
Leave me behind
Walk away, leave it behind

I'm turning away from everything
Everything mattered to you
So save your breath
Just save your breath

Oh yeah

Sometimes your trapped in the silence
Between what is wrong and what's right
I know you just need to cave in
Remove the skin and just leave it behind

Leave me behind
Walk away, leave it behind
