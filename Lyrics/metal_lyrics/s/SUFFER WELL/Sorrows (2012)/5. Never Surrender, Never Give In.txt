There is no soul to break
I was cast aside before you pushed me away
And don't you ever think you are important to me
I'll erase you today

I've wasted all my time on you shallow faces
And now it's time to destroy them all

No one is safe
Never surrender, never give in
I cherish the fear on your face
Never surrender, never give in
Don't give a fuck who you know
Never surrender, never give in
I just want to see you fucking suffer

Suffer - suffer

There is no soul to kill
I know it's buried alive without a heart to fill
And don't you ever think you are important to me
You all make me ill

I've wasted all my time on you shallow faces
And now it's time to smash them all

No one is safe
Never surrender, never give in
I cherish the fear on your face
Never surrender, never give in
Don't give a fuck who you know
Never surrender, never give in
I just want to see you fucking suffer

Suffer 
Don't surrender, never give in
Don't surrender, never give in

I dedicate my life to make you all suffer
Suffer, fucking suffer
Suffer, fucking suffer
Suffer

And now it's time to smash them all

No one is safe
Never surrender, never give in
I cherish the fear on your face
Never surrender, never give in
Don't give a fuck about you now
Never surrender, never give in
I just want to see you fucking suffer

Suffer
Don't surrender, never give in
Don't surrender, never give in
Never give in
