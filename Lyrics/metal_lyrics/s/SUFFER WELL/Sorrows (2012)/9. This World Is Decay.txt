Give me a reason - a chance to shattered the earth.
Undeniable lust to break this fucking shell
That I've been a slave, so many years.

I've endured all the bitterness, aspirations don't mean shit.
Just want to feel what's real. 
Serve up a heavy dose of neglect.
And these ashes are venom. 
Spit in the face of those who choose to believe that things get better.
Just look around cuz the world is shit - decay!

It's just a shame
Some dreams just never lift up.
Never sheltered from your cold embrace. 
This feeling runs deep in my blood.
Still looking for higher ground 
But I'm losing the strength to walk against this flood.

Give me the chance to bring down the sky.
The devil is controlling my strings 
And the worlds are waiting to take on the night 

I've endured all the bitterness, aspirations don't mean shit.
Just want to feel what's real. 
Serve up a heavy dose of neglect.
And these ashes are venom. 
Spit in the face of those who choose to believe that things get better.
Just look around cuz the world is shit - decay!

It's just a shame
Some dreams just never lift up.
Never sheltered from your cold embrace. 
These feelings runs deep in my blood.
Still looking for higher ground 
But I'm losing the strength to walk against this flood.

This world is decay.
This world is decay.

Now just one more breath.
Oh God! Just one more breath.
Just one more breath to shelter me from this hell.

This world is decay.
This world is decay.

I've endured all the bitterness, aspirations don't mean shit.
That's right they don't mean shit - decay!
