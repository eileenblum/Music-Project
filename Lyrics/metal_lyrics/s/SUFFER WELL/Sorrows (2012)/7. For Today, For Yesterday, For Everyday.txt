Look into my eyes! Your sanctity's swarming!
You're just too fucking scared - but you just can't admit it.

You prey on the weak and impressible.
Now I'm going to burn your self righteous ministry.

I hope this keeps you awake at night. 
I hope you burn. I hope you burn.

Look inside yourself! Your preaching is lying!
You are no fucking god - just a misled prophet.

You prey on the weak and impressible.
Now I'm going to burn your self righteous ministry.

I know this eats you alive.
I hope you burn. I hope you burn. 

I hope this keeps awake at night I know this eats you alive.

Look into my eyes! Your sanctity's swarming!
You're just too fucking scared - but you just can't admit it.

You prey on the weak and impressible.
Now I'm going to burn your self righteous ministry.

I Hope this keeps you awake at night. 
I hope you burn. I hope you burn.

I hope this keeps awake at night I know this eats you alive. 

Now this path that you've chosen this battle of belief.
You think its god that you pray to but it's the devil that you see - 
or merely the devil that you seek.
