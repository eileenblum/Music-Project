This is not what you wanted? This is not what you fucking mean?
So cry for mercy I hope your ears fucking bleed.
Now you feel ten times worse temptation is a drug to hang your head on this curse.

Now I am hearing the sound again, the shrieking of your voice.
Ripping the layers of innocence. Now where did you go wrong?
Or where the fuck did we go wrong?
You'll be hopeless, you'll be damned by the chocking emptiness.

Behind your eyes, cold heart in vain, and you feel so alone 
Ugly and betrayed. You will seek, you will drown.
Deny your hopes and tears, just keep your demons safe?

Keep them safe! 

This is not what you wanted? This not what you fucking mean?
So cry for mercy I hope your ears fucking bleed.
You'll feel ten times worse, temptation is a joke to want a view from this curse.

Now I am hearing the sound again, the shrieking of your voice.
Ripping the layers of innocence. Now where did you go wrong?
Where the fuck did we go wrong?
You'll be hopeless, you'll be damned by the chocking emptiness.

Behind your eyes, cold heart in vain and you feel so alone
ugly and betrayed. You will seek, you will drown.
Deny your hopes and tears, just keep your demons safe?

Keep them safe!

Now where the fuck did you go wrong?
And where the fuck did we go wrong?
Now where the fuck did you go wrong?
And where the fuck did we go wrong?
