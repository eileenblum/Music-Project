You left with your identity of despair.
All that you admire, you fell in love with your sadness.
Now you do what it takes to get higher - so much lying.

Now you walk this road of regret - the only road I've gotten to see before.
No safety in passing. Never ascending till you sacrificed your soul
And there's no hope for you, there's no hope for your soul.

In time you still can't change this feeling (you stand alone)
Your eyes are shut your heart is closed.
And now you run from all your demons (where is your home?)
Your face is turning pale your skin is cold.

Your misconception of truth. Your wickedness will transpire. 
You fell in love with your weakness. Now you can't get any lower.
Now you walk this road of regret, the only road I've gotten to see before.
No safety in passing. Never ascending till you sacrificed your soul
And there's no hope for you, there's no hope for your soul.

In time you still can't change this feeling (you stand alone)
Your eyes are shut your heart is closed.
And now you run from all your demons (where is your home?)
Your face is turning pale your skin is freezing cold.

And there's no hope for us all.

And there's no hope for you. There's no hope for your soul.

In time you still can't change this feeling (you stand alone)
Your eyes are shut your heart is closed.
And now you run from all your demons (where is your home?)
Your face is turning pale your skin is cold.

Your skin is cold.
