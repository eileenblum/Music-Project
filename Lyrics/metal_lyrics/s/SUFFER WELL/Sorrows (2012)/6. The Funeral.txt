Wasting away the last breath of humanity
Infecting each other's minds
And now your sky is falling down

Give us what we want
Feed us what we crave for
Make it short and sweet
Because we rather stop listening

To the sound of mankind gasping for air
And now your halos are choking us to death

Right before our eyes
Our lives are being stripped away (away, away)
Right before our eyes
Ignore the warning, no escape

Give us what we want
Feed us what we crave for
Make it short and sweet
Because we rather stop listening

To the sound of mankind still gasping for air
And now your halo will drag us to our knees

Right before our eyes
Our lives are being stripped away (away, away)
Right before our eyes
Ignore the warning, no escape

(No salvation
No escape, no escape)
No salvation
No escape

We are the infected now turning back from life

So many dreams left from reality
And I'm so numb I can't care anyway
So many dreams left from reality
And I'm so numb I can't care anyway

God bless this funeral

(Right before, right before)
Right before our eyes
Our lives are being stripped away (away, away)
Right before our eyes
Ignore the warning, no escape
