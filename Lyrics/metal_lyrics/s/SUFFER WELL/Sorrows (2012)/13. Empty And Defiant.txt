Dead and silent.
No one hears when it's coming for me.
Empty and defiant - trust no one.
We all die from the same disease.

(Andy LaPlegua)
Morals mean nothing to me.
Don't live you life on your knees.

This infection will slip into your skull.
Into the terrible place where you'll dwell
I see no other way that can drag you down with me
Into hell.

My world is not fake. I scratch my brain.
Quick like yourself-Be what you praise. 

This infection will seep into your skull.
Wretched and terrible place where you dwell.
I see you no other way than to drag you down with me - 
Into hell.

Reflect eternal one 
I can't bare the sight of humanity 
Begging from its knees.

Morals mean nothing to me (Morals mean nothing to me)
Don't live your life on your knees. (Live your life on your knees)
This infection will seep into your skull.
Wretched and terrible place where you dwell.
I see you no other way than to drag you down with me - 
Into hell.

Reflect eternal one
I can't bare the sight of humanity 
Begging from its knees.

We will suffer the same infection.
And we will die (and we will die)
We will die from the same disease. 
We will suffer the same infection.
And we will die (and we will die)
We will die from the same disease. 

Dead and silent.
No one hears when it's coming for me.
Empty and defiant - trust no one.
We all die from the same disease.

This infection will slip into your skull.
Into the terrible place where you'll dwell
I see no other way than to drag you down with me.
