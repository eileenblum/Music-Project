&lt; What the fuck do you know?
Or it's that your anything at all?
Its follow the leader 
Remove them makes me reduce to a crawl.
I've seen this before
So much promise in your lies
How you give it away.
It was for a false sense of pride.

Survive while you can
The earth is sinking down. 
The earth is sinking down.

I can't remember who you are
and why you've been reduced to this?
This is gone too far. Yea this is gone to far.

Now this side of your face
The side of emotional neglect.
This life is ripped through your soul.
Obey your leader of death.

Who cares what yo know. 
Or it's that your anything at all?
Its follow the leader 
Remove them makes me reduce to a crawl.
Am I purpose of reform.
So much promise in your lies
How you fucked it away.
It was for a false sense of pride

How you fucked away your life.
Your time is ticking way. Ticking away.

I can't remember who you are
and why you've been reduced to this?
This is gone too far. Yea this is gone to far
