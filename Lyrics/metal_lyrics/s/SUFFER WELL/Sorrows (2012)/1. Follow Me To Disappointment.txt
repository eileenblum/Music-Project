I'm here
There's nothing you can say to me to protect yourself
I'll show you what it takes to be a martyr
I've died so many times to count

Join me at the bottom of the sea
Tied to weights just to sleep in the gutter
You know nothing is lost
Until you see your face becoming part of the mirror

I'll reflect on the hearts I fucking trampled
You think this is a beautiful life
There's no glory, no glamor, no perfection

Follow me six feet underground
With the rest of the bottom feeders
You know just how to dwell
When you see your face becoming one of the leaders

How many times have you prayed for this life?
This perfect life of disappointment
And you're disappointing everyone

I'm here
There's nothing you can say to me to protect yourself
I'll show you what it takes to be a martyr
I've died so many times to count

Join me at the bottom of the sea
Tied to weights just to sleep in the gutter
You know nothing is lost
Until you see your face becoming part of the mirror

How many times have you prayed for this life?
This perfect life of disappointment
And you're disappointing everyone

Follow me six feet underground
With the rest of the bottom feeders
You know just how to dwell
When you see your face becoming one of the leaders

How many times have you prayed for this life?
This perfect life of disappointment
And you're disappointing everyone
