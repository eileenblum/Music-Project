52 and more to come
You pay the prize for what you done
They try to get rid of me
Why canât you just leave me be?

Thereâs no place left to hide
I will defend what is mine
Donât try to run or Iâll hunt you down
Leave my turf or I will eat you alive

I donât hate them, but they hate me
(All I want is to be free)
Why canât you just leave me be?
Canât see why they want me dead
They even put a prize on my head

Thereâs no place left to hide
I will defend what is mine
Donât try to run or Iâll hunt you down
Leave my turf or I will eat you alive

Thereâs no place left to hide
I will defend what is mine
Donât try to run or Iâll hunt you down
Leave my turf or I will eat you alive

Eat you alive!
