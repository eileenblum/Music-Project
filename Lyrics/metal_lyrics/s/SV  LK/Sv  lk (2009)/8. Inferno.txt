A part of me died that day
The day everything went grey
Iâll never get back on my feet again

Free is all I want to be
Please, stop hurting me
Iâll never get back on my feet again

No more tomorrow!
Deep dark sorrow!

I cry rivers of tears
I drink oceans of beer
Iâll never get back on my feet again

You knock me down, I get up again
Canât stop the truth, my friend
Youâll never get back on your feet again

No more tomorrow!
Deep dark sorrow!
