Is this all you got?
Is this what they fear?
Is what you had in mind?
Is this what the fuzz is about?
Did you think I would give up that easy?
Did you thing I would lay down and die?
Now Iâll come for you all and Iâm running out of time

I donât believe a thing you say
You can all go to hell
Iâm afraid you have to go
âCause you made me feel like shit

It is my fuel
It is my passion
Hate is the reason for my every action
Did you think I would give up that easy?
Did you thing I would lay down and die?
Now Iâll come for you all and I wonât waste my time

I donât believe a thing you say
You can all go to hell
Iâm afraid you have to go
âCause you made me feel like shit

Iâm on my way
Iâll come for you all
Iâm running out of time
Facing the end of the line
Iâm on my way
Iâll come for you all
I donât believe a thing they say
You can all go to hell!

I donât believe a thing you say
You can all go to hell
Iâm afraid you have to go
âCause you made me feel like shit
