Canât grind me down, canât hold me back
Canât find a way to prove that Iâm the reason for this tragedy
No matter how much you lie, no matter how hard try
I donât care about your ways âcause Iâll always be on top of you

Like an anchor round my neck
You hold me down
Forever stuck in a web
Itâs time to go and I walk alone

Freedom is close but out of reach
Iâll find a way, Iâll move those rocks
Blocking the path to liberty
You better find your own way
You better make it on your own
You try to put it in reverse
But it only goes faster into disaster
Canât stop me now, canât hold me down
Canât stop the feeling of
Taking control of your destiny

Like an anchor round my neck
You hold me down
Forever stuck in a web
Itâs time to go and I walk alone

Like an anchor round my neck
You hold me down
Forever stuck in a web
Itâs time to go and I walk alone
