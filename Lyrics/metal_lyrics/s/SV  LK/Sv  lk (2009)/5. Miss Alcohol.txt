Hello miss alcohol, itâs me again
This time itâs you and me to the end!
Things getting critical, downright insane
Weâll take it to the end tonight

I can sleep when Iâm dead!

Hello miss alcohol, youâre my only friend
Too late to turn around, you and me to the end
Iâm drunk once again, but Iâm not alone
Itâs time to face the end and Iâll die alone!

I can sleep when Iâm dead!

Youâre my only friend
You and me to the end
Hello death, Iâm coming home
Told you Iâd die alone
