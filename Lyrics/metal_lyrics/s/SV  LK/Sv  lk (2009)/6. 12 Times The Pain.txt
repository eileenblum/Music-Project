Soldier of SvÃ¶lk I am
Armed with guts and noise
Action speaks louder than words you say
Well, thatâs me next to your eardrum
Screaming from the top of my lungs

Do you hear me screaming?
I cry out for more
I canât feel a thing
Give me 12 times the pain

My life! My choice!
My chance to get away from it all!
My turn to have it all
Iâll rise and Iâll watch you fall
The pain! I feel!
Now I know my life is real!
This life! Not fair!
Take a hit and see if I care

Do you hear me screaming?
I cry out for more
I canât feel a thing
Give me 12 times the pain
