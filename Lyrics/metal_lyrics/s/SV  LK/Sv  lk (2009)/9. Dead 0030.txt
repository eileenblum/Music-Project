Fear and loneliness paid me a visit
I can see now what they wanted
Told me Iâm dead, canât deny it
I canât feel a thing, itâs time to pay my dues!

Hate me âcause Iâm invincible
Canât beat me âcause Iâm half past dead!

Fear and loneliness now control me
I can see now what they wanted
Better off dead, canât deny it
Uncontrollable, I have paid my dues!

Hate me âcause Iâm invincible
Canât beat me âcause Iâm...
Hate me âcause Iâm unbeatable
Canât kill me âcause Iâm half past dead!
