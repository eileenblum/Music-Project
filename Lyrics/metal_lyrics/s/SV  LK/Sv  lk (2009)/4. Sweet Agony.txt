Oh sweet agony
Iâm waiting for you to come
Canât find no love in this life
Still Iâm searching all night long
Canât find no sweet relief
In this life I lead
Another night spent waiting
Iâm waiting for you to come

Oh sweet agony
Turmoil in my head
Why didnât you listen to me?
I told your love was dead
Oh sweet agony
What took you so long?
Now this life is over
Iâm back where I belong

Sweet agony
Take me home
Sweet agony!
I donât belong
I donât belong
I donât belong
Sweet agony
Take me home
Sweet agony!
