A week of heavy work is done
And here comes Friday
A week of dirty jobs is over

Theyâre passing slowly one by one
But here comes my day
And so Iâm looking for my lover

last week she said " just call me"
And then weâll do it all again

And as she heard her favourite song
Turn it louder now
She said and then she sang along
Turn it louder now
I hope I didnât get her wrong
Turn it louder now

The backseat of my car is black
Itâs made of leather
And itâs my castle and my home

I turn my head and all as once
I can see Heather
Stroke her blonde hair with a comb

She bites into my ear, I shudder!
I know weâll do it all again

And now she hears her favourite song
Turn it louder now
She says and then she sing along
Turn it louder now
I hope I didnât get her wrong
Turn it louder now
And so we sing our favourite song
