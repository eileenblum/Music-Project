All of sudden a lighting
Breaking the dark
A deep cut in the night
Hurting and blinding
Nearly ripping up my side

Rushing in like a tornado
Knocking me out
Turning me upside down
A desperado
Dusty skin and bleeding wound

You are the light
Something very special
Breaking the night
Something very special
You are the thunder the lightning
Something very special
Show me your love can be frightening

Give me your light
Give me something special
Breaking the night
Give me something special
