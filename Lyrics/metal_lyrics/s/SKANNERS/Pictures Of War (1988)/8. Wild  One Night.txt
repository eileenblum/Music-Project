All dressed in black
My hair combed back
The cigarette glows
Iâm the guy who doesnât speak a lot
Iâm the cool one, who can guess Iâm hot

An animal
A criminal
That spark in my eyes
Maybe a tiger in the jungle
If you see from that angle

Soon or late
If I can wait
No difference between
Next minute or even next year
As far as can be Iâll still be near

And Iâm wild wild wild
Fire in the forest
Raging like a tempest
Yes Iâm wild wild wild
Storm upon the ocean
Tossing up emotions

Youâre shining bright
Youâre nearly light
I stand in the dark
Two opposites in attraction
Only waiting for the action

I take a look at you, the way you dress
I donât know but I can guess
There is something that you hide

I see you clearly moving in the dark
Youâre afraid of every spark
Youâre afraid we could discover

One night
In search of alibis
One night
To follow bad advice
One night
To change the way you were
One night
To fall into despair

The haircut and tie just like a clerk
Getting ready for his work
Not the way we used to know you

I know it well, itâs always just the same
Change of look and change of name
Is it love or is it money?

One night
In search of alibis
One night
To follow bad advice
One night
To change the way you were
One night
To fall into despair
