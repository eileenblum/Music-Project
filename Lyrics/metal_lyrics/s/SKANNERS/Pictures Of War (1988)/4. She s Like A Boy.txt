It was dark around
Wrapped in fog that dirty place
So I could hardly see that face
Coming slowly from the darkness
Of that rainy evening
There was something in that voice
Making me so insecure
And I had to know some more

Ooh .......
Sheâs like a boy
Ooh....
Sheâs a raver

You can judge someone
By the haircut, by the step
By the power of the rap
By the way your hand is shaken
And still was searching
I was sure Iâd found a friend
By a look into those eyes
And I had the big surprise

Ooh .......
Sheâs like a boy
Ooh....
Sheâs a raver
