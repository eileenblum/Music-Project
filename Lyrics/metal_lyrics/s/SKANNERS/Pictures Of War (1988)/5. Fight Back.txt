What do you think and what do you do
When youâre caught in the act
How does youâre mind how does youâre blood
And your body react

Please donât tell me you pray
You fall on your knees
Please donât carry that blame

You have to fight back
Only to fight back

Better one minute of anger
Instead of a minute of fear
You donât have to be so much stronger
Your rival will soon disappear

Please donât tell me you shiver
And you run away
Please donât tell me you flee

You have to fight back
Only to fight back

Fight back......
