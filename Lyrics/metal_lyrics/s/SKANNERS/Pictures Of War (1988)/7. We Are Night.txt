I feel alright
The engineâs howling wild
The temperâs high
And the air is burning tonight

I feel alright
My chest is glowing steel
My brain is light
Who can hurt a body like mine

Come on with me
Weâre ready for a ride up to the skies
So fasten now your seat belts tight
Come on with me
Iâm gonna show you how my engine flies
Weâre gonna be the stars tonight

We feel alright
The darkness doesnât give us
A kind of fright
`Cause weâre a part of the night

We are the night
Weâre turning all the values upside down
Every sight we change, every sound

The day-light may say we are sinister
The darkness is making us bright
We are night......
