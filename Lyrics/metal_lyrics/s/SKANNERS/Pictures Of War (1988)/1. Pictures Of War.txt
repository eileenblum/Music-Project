The tank platoon is moving slow
We hear the rolling thunder grow
Over our heads a heavy cloud of planes

The aircraft-carrier in the bay
Is sending arrows in the sky
The buttonâs pushed, a way of no return

And so weâre shooting, weâre shooting pictures of war
Thatâs war
Weâre executing in the name of a star
Thatâs war
That will be shining alone in the sky
Thatâs war
And so weâre fighting only to die

We sleep in trenches bound to die
Rocked by a cannon lullaby
The actors of the final power play

And so weâre shooting, weâre shooting pictures of war
Thatâs war
Weâre executing in the name of a star
Thatâs war
That will be shining alone in the sky
Thatâs war
And so weâre fighting only to die
