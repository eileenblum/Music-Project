Youâre praying imploring and begging
You crawl on your knees
Youâre crying but I donât agree
Iâm not ready to please

Youâre trembling you sweat
You nearly just spit out your soul
A heavenly flight
Youâre raving `cause hell is the goal

Youâre flowing down the drain
Like dirty water
Drowning down the drain
Youâre flowing down the drain
Like dirty water
Flushed into the drain

You give me your word, youâre ready
To pay every bill
I look in your eyes, I can see
You are ready to kill

No way of return
The needle to deep in your vein
No way of return
Those stitches have poisoned your brain

Youâre flowing down the drain
Like dirty water
Drowning down the drain
Youâre flowing down the drain
Like dirty water
