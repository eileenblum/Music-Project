When the night is falling down
Living flashes on the land
Screams and shouts around the hill
Lots a mad splinters
The sparkling shields break the sky
The iron wheels of fear

Another beast of hell
Another nightmares coming `round
You hear the infernos bell
Vibrating in your body

The smoke of hell burning your eyes
In your hand lies death or life
Rolling like a thunder now
The sound of steel resounds
Beast of hell sucks open heads
The sackerâs coming just for you

Another beast of hell
Another nightmares coming `round
You hear the infernos bell
Vibrating in your body

We are the mark of death
We are the final spell
We are the missing bet
We are the beast of hell

Another beast of hell
Another nightmares coming `round
You hear the infernos bell
Vibrating in your body

Another beast of hell
Another nightmares coming `round
You hear the infernos bell

Beast beast of hell........
