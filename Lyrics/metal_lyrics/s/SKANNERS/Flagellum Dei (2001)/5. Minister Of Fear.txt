Lost in your nightmare
In the foggy harsh of a dream
In the darkest fold of your own brain

Something is creeping
Slowly up on your spine
Spiders nibbling and licking your mind

And then you meet
Me on the street to madness

Minister of fear
Minister of fear
Minister of fear

Shudder and cold sweat
May I introduce to you
My ambassadors? Shine of my court

Iâm the inventor
Of all the poisons on earth
Just a sip only a drip and youâll shine

And then you meet
Me on the street to madness

Minister of fear
Minister of fear
Minister of fear

Whom do you meet
On the street to madness
Just take a seat
Under these sheet of madness

Minister of fear
Minister of fear
Minister of fear
