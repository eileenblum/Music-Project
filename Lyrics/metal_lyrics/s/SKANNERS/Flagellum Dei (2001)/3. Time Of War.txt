Only can say try
Iâm sure to get you high
So listen to your leader
Freedom of defence
Only words of common sense

Moving to and fro
Itâs part of the show
The language of your body
The battlefield a dance floor
And we the corps of ballet

Powerful throw
A cutting blow
A nimble feint
We are stuck

In a time of war - so you better change
In a time of war - time to rearrange
In a time of war - does it look so strange
In a time of war - war

What youâve got to lose
There will be no use
To be a superstitious
No amulet no charm
Only rage will work

Dance into the mess
Get the proper dress
It makes you feel the power
Lightningâs out your eyes
Thunders of your mouth

Powerful throw
A cutting blow
A nimble feint
We are stuck

In a time of war - so you better change
In a time of war - time to rearrange
In a time of war - does it look so strange
In a time of war - war

Time time of war

Black winged angels - sulphur smell
Join this army - dance the hell
Ride the shadows - burn the night
Sow of terror - rip the fright

In a time of war - so you better change
In a time of war - time to rearrange
In a time of war - does it look so strange
In a time of war - war
