Iâm a soldier a conqueror
Trained to kill for this war
That will last till my last day, my dear

A job to do a game to play
That will take me far away
Making me wealthy and rich
You better believe me

Itâs my life smells of danger
Itâs cold inside
Itâs my life follow me

Iâve got my sword Iâve got my spear
Anxiety will disappear
When I ride to my next battlefield
Someone prays for you

Donât you pray donât you pray
Donât you think I gonna die
For my goal is far beyond the death
You better believe me

Itâs my life smells of danger
Itâs cold inside
Itâs my life follow me to see me win
Fame and glory Iâll give you
Fame and glory Iâll give you in the end

Itâs my life smells of danger
Itâs cold inside
Itâs my life but I see you cry and pray
You try to convince me
Fame and glory that will be my end
