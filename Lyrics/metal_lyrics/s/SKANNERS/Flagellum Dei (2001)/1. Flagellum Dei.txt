Thirst of fighting
Born to kill
Riding like hell for power and glory

A slaughterâs a pleasure
Only my sword I trust
My name is Flagellum Dei
Flagellum Dei

The terror is growing now
The invasion goes on
Iâm headingÂ´ for Rome
Grass no more growing
You see a burning landscape
Desperation is the seed
Of the Warlord
Flagellum Dei
Flagellum Dei
Flagellum Dei
Iâm the Warlord
Flagellum Dei
Flagellum Dei
Flagellum Dei

Ready for the attack
From the top of the hill
I see that man in white
Carrying his cross
Iâm torn between questions
My soldiers cry out
They claim for action, plain destruction

Iâm scared of this man
Yes Iâm scared of this cross
Iâm scared of this man
Yes Iâm scared, Iâm scared
Flagellum Dei...............
