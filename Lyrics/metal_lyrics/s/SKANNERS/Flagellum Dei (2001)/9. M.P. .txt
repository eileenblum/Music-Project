Hey, this is your story
No honour no glory
For a vile filthy liar

Youâre guilty of witchcraft
Youâre in the hells draft
Youâll end in the fire

The path you found
It takes you down
Rolling your crazy eyes
Youâre gonna die

Look, itâs getting dark
An infernal mark
Is under your tongue
No more chains to break
Your altarâs the stake
Youâll see you was wrong

How could you believe in
How could you believe in
The soul of a fool

The soul of a fool........

How could you believe in
How could you believe in
The soul of a fool
How could you believe in
How could you believe in
The soul of a fool

The soul of a fool........
