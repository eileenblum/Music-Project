Itâs just another day
Of this endless war
Here we are the Lords
The ministry of death

The night black and cold
The wings of the crow
Warriors are waiting
Thirsty of butcher
With burning axes
Rising from hell

There is blood in my eyes
Fire and steel on my way
There is blood in my eyes
Weâll never surrender no way

Attilaâs name
Fear is blocking your brain
Pray your own God
And you may save your soul

Iâll rip off your head
Â´Cos sipping your blood
I get the power
A wild crazy beast
Tearing you up
Iâm the evil

There is blood in my eyes
Fire and steel on my way
There is blood in my eyes
Weâll never surrender no way

There is blood in my eyes
Fire and steel on my way
There is blood in my eyes
Weâll never surrender no way
