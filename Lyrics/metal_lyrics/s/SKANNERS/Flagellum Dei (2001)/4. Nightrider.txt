Whoâs faster whoâs stronger than hurricanes
Pointing his eyes in the dark
Who never cares if itâs thunders or rains
Whoâs got the unquenchable spark?
What does he grasp in his hand
I see a bleeding heart

A fresh bleeding heart
Faster faster
On and on
Fly nightrider
On and on

Heâs got a message that could save his lord
Heâs got a life in the hand
Heâs got two rules only, his speed and his sword
Crossing those desolates lands
What does he grasp in his hand
I see a bleeding heart

A fresh bleeding heart
Faster faster
On and on
Fly nightrider
The night turns you on
Faster faster
On and on
Fly nightrider
Fly nightrider on and on......
What does he grasp in his hand
I see a bleeding heart

A fresh bleeding heart
Faster faster
On and on
Fly nightrider
The night turns you on
Faster faster
On and on
Fly nightrider
Fly nightrider
Fly nightrider on and on......

Nightrider........
