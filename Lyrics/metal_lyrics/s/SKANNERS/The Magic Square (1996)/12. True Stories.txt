There was a time
When the sky was blue
And in the fields
Gold corn grew
Coloured flowers
In a deep green
Like the old rainbow after the storm

Ooh ooh
These things were true

Nowadays we cannot see the sun
A grey sky impends over us
Because weâve done nothing to save the world

Ooh ooh
These things are true
Ooh ooh
Do something for you.....
