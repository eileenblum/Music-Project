They say that I killed a man
Everything against me
I donât have an alibi
I donât know where I am
I donât give up `cause Iâm innocent

Many electroshocks and X rays
The doctors have given up on me

Insane
Mentally deranged person
Insane
Never come back never come back

The tunnel of darkness in front of me
Is becoming a white madhouse
Weeping eyes and screaming voices
Destroy my brain

Many electroshocks and X rays
The doctors have given up on me

Insane
Mentally deranged person
Insane
Never come back never come back
