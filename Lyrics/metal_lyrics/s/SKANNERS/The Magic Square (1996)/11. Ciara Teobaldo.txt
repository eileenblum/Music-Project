I have been in the Holy Land
I have fought the Holy War
I have known a valiant knight
Who married a kingâs daughter

Three long years of hope and faithful waiting
Now sheâs crying in pain....but

Heâs returned, Heâs returned
But his false story breaks Claraâs heart
Heâs returned, Heâs returned
But when he reveals himself, sheâs gone

Sheâs thinks heâs dead
In the Holy Land

Clara springs out of the window
And Teobaldo comes to late

Heâs returned, Heâs returned
But itâs too late and sheâs gone
Hey, Hey
The eternal flames have taken her soul
Heâs returned, Heâs returned
But his false story broke Claraâs heart

Clara springs out of the window
And Teobaldo comes to late

Heâs returned, Heâs returned
But itâs too late and sheâs gone
Hey, Hey
The eternal flames have taken her soul
Heâs returned, Heâs returned
But when he reveals himself, sheâs gone....
