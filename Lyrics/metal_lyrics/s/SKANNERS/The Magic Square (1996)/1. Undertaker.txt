I Feel the heat
Deep in my heart, Iâm burning inside
In my mind thereâs an immense confusion
I donât understand
Shut up you fucking liar man

Where does this voice come from
My mouth is screaming
My eyes are bleeding red tears
In your Life there was violence, murder and every kind of crime
God judges right and were found guilty
Of everything youâve done

And now Iâll put you underground

Let me be free undertaker
Let me go undertaker
Let me live please please

Iâve repented and I want to change my mind
Who ever expiates his sins in this Life
Will be forgiven
But for you itâs to late
Youâll burn in eternal flames......

Let me be free undertaker
Let me go undertaker
Let me live please please
