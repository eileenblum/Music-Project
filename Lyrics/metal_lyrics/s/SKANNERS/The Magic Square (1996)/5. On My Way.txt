Itâs a strange rainy morning
And thereâs something in the air
I see a world without colour
But I donât care

I am looking through the door
I canât wait for you anymore

Let me be forever free
Let me go on my way
But where will I go?

Without you the world is wonderful
But I pray for you
Without you I may find truth
But I pray for you....

She was the shadow of my life
But now I can see the sun

Let me be forever free
Let me go on my way
I donât know where Iâll go

Without you the world is wonderful
But I pray for you
Without you I may find truth
But I pray for you....

Life is good and seems all right
But now Iâm here
I canât believe youâre gone

Without you the world is wonderful
But I pray for you
Without you I may find truth
But I pray for you....
