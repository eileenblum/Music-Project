The bass a rumbling thunder
You got to hear these drums
The troubles will go under
Thatâs why we go to...

Metal party is what we need
Metal party fun guaranteed
Metal party riot of sounds
Is all that counts

Fever when youâre rocking
Same fever when you roll
Black jacket and body stocking
Youâre gonna make me fall

Watch out for a metal party
For such a special thing
No time for lonely hearts to night
We want.....

Metal party is what we need
Metal party fun guaranteed
Metal party riot of sounds
Is all that counts
