When your mind is trying to explode
Just like a ball straight on for goal

You feel the power under your skin
Breakdown your face
Inside your head
You feel the power under your skin
Breakdown your face....

Hey Mister, what time is it?
Too many people die
Too many people scream

You feel the power under your skin
Breakdown your face
Inside your head
You feel the power under your skin
Breakdown your face....

Seems like a fucking demolition man
And nobody can be free
Thereâs no future but itâs not the end
Itâs a true reality.......

NA na na na na..........
