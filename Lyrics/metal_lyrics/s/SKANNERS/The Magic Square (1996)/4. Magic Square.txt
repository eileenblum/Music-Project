Up there the tower
The wind is so strong
Sheâs dressed in white veils

Her dazing eyes
Are looking to the ground
At once sheâs going with the wind

Oh ... Oooh....
Sheâs dying for him
Sheâs dying for love

Now Claraâs body
Is lying on the heart
Covered with her blood
But Claraâs soul is floating in the air
Searching its freedom

So in the castle youâll find
A magic square on the wall
This is the way to get its freedom
Oh ... Oooh....
You can resolve the riddle
The riddle of the square

The magic square inside your brain

Go to the front door
Go through the court
Then go upstairs to the left
Youâll find a passage
On the third floor
And youâll see the magic square

So in the castle youâll find
A magic square on the wall
This is the way to get its freedom
Oh ... Oooh....
You can resolve the riddle
The riddle of the square
