What I see, oh my Angel
Where we live thereâs always war
Too many sorrows but remember itâs not the time
To close your eyes
To make a wrong choice
Because I canât live without you

Fly oh Angel
Fly over the sea
Take me away to the future
Right in our fantasy

Too many people who are crying in pain
Tears flow from there eyes
Lots of people die
And the other can only survive

Fly oh Angel
Fly over the sea
Take me with you on the rainbow
Far from this destiny
