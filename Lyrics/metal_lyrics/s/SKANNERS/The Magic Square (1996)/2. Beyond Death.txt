Hey donât touch the light
Can only watch it
Everything youâve done was right
Everything will be rewarded

Beyond Death
Beyond Death
Beyond Death
Beyond Death

Wonderful town
No more destruction
Wonderful town
The promised land

Now I see the light
And itâs not a dream
I walk this one way street
To the gates of eternity

Beyond Death
Beyond Death
Beyond Death
Beyond Death

Wonderful town
No more destruction
Wonderful town
The promised land
Wonderful town
Lots of sweet sensations
Wonderful town
Only angelâs gangs.
