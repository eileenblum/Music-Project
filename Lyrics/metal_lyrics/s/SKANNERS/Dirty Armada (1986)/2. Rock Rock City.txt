My steps on the sidewalk
Dirty street of this old town
I'm gonna hear some more tonight
I'm dying for that sound

My God the noise is rising
I can hear it grow and grow
It's howling wolfs, it's thunder hell
The only sound I know

Rock rock city -- ooh yeah
We're moving to that beat
Rock rock city -- ooh yeah
Up and down the street
Rock rock city -- ooh yeah
Turn it louder in your car
Rock rock city -- ooh yeah
My religion's my guitar.....
