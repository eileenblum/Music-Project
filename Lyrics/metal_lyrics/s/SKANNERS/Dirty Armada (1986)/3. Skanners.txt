Life is creeping ` round deep in the mud
Life is nearly dying, oh my god
Free it let it flow in every vein
Let it reach the kernel of your brain

One more monster, he will reign the last
Giving to the world the final blast
Maybe it's a nightmare, it's a curse
He's the rule of the universe

Skanners no body nor face
Skanners no mercy nor grace
Skanners the last chance at all
Skanners can you hear us call

It's heavy metal time

Can you hear the thunder coming from afar
Can you hear the thunder, the breath of war....
