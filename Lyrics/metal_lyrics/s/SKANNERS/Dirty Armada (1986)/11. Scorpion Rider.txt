The night has com, the road is waiting
No time for silence in the woods
No more time for whispers, no more time for love
No more time to talk to the wind

The night has com, the road is waiting
Dust and mud will cover you
But they wont hurt your pride
Somewhere something's dying, in forgotten lands
Somewhere something's waiting for you...

Scorpion rider run and fight
There's something to defend
Something must be kept alive
To save us in the end

Scorpion rider run and fight
Run, don't turn your head
Rock and roll has to survive
When everything is dead

Scorpion rider flying in the sky
Scorpion rider flying in the sky

Save the only language
That's still loyal and sincere
It's your task to free our eyes
From the dust of hate and fear

Scorpion rider run and fight
Run, you'll never fall
Calling back the wasted time
In the name of rock and roll

Scorpion Rider run and fight, fight fight....
