Heavy metal

this way they come together
steel and fire

Shining more than bright
They melt into each there
Melting like two lovers
Steel and fire

And this is the way
That we could feel every day
`cause we are steel and fire

so don't be surprised
don't be scared
if the temper, the temper will rise
it's hotter than hot
it's brighter than bright
we're just setting the sky on fire

It's burning inside, desire
We're setting the sky on fire.
