Try, you've got to break the wall
And there will be the sky
Sky enough to live
Sky enough to fly

Spread your wings
Draw fire rings
And catch them

Black eagle dark queen of the air
You'd better beware
There's someone behind you
They're waiting for
Your weakest hour

Black eagle you'll fall
Tonight it's the night
You have just to keep your eyes open

Black eagle fly
Black eagle cry.....
