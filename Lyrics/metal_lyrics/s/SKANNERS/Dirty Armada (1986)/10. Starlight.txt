It lives in your body
The spaces it needs are so wide
The room of the universe is the room of your mind

It leaves you sometimes for a ride
In foreign skies
Coming back it touches your brain
They call it starlight

Energy, power, it's a free fireball
Energy, power, you can't catch no control
Every day faster, riding up to the skies
Every day stronger, hypnotizing your eyes.

They call it the queen
Of the stars in the universe
But it don't needs no warriors at its side
And the iron men better watch out
Not a sound, only a flash
And they'll malt like snow in the sun.
