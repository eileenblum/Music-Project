Thieves and liars
The players
Upon your screen
Gangsters and killers
The thrillers
You've always seen

They seem so far
Although they're coming to you
Every night
They're coming tonight.......

There is no barrier
To the master of fear
No kind of barrier

No space no age
For flames of rage
No place to hide
And when they ride
No higher tide

Shock shock TV shock.......
