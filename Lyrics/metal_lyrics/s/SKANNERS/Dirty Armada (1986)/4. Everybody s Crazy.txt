We are the wildest bunch
Of furious animals
Locked up in a cage
It's the end of our age

And all we need for lunch
The heart of an enemy
You have read the last page
It's the end of our age

The curse in our mouth
The lies in our eyes
The poison takes effect
We're getting crazy

Bites and scabs, scratches
Upon your skin
And what we feel within
Only fever
Only hate
Everybody's crazy
We're getting crazy
The whole world's crazy.......
