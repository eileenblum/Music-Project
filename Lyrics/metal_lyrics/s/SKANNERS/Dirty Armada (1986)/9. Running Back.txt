Games and toys just smiles and laughter
Everything seems to be so clean and nice
Games and toys what's coming after
Tell me haven't they got any price ?

Games you play in danger zone
Your body steel, your heart of stone
You're always alone
Running, longing for your goal
They burnt out your soul

Running back to find the key
Running back to liberty
Running back the time has come
Running back to where you come from.
