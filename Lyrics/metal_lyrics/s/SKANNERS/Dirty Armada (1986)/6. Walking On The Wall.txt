Walking on the wall
One by one and steel the same direction
You see
Something within is lighter than the air

It's a voice that's calling
It's a cry in my brain
Like an angel who's falling
But I know it's in vain
One by one and steel the same direction
You see
We're walking on the wall
Walking on the wall

And we feel the wind of death
Every time we turn our head
Every time we try to wonder
How and who's the master of the fate
We have to suffer

And a whip is coming down
Changing smiles into a frown
Every time we seem to forget
That we are walking one by one
Walking on the wall.
