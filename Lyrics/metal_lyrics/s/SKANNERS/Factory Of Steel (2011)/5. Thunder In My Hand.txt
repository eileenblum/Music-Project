Everything is going back
Lightning breaks the sky
Like a storm of steel

Time of glory is back
Full of revenge
And my eyes
Radiate energy

Justice will be done
Glory for those who suffered
Justice will be done
And the bell ring's in your death

Oh light, oh light in my eyes
Oh light is like thunder in my hand

We never gave up, never stopped
And the fire's burning my soul
Still burning strong
Young metal-eating beast
That shows no mercy

Justice will be done...

Oh light...
