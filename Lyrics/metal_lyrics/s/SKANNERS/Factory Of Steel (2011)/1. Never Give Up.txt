Now is the time, we are alone
Against everything, against everyone
Now is the time we are alone
With no defence but's all for one

Now is the time, we are alone
Against everything, against everyone
Now is the time never give up
Now and forever

Scream and shout like a mad dog
No remorse, we're ready to explode
Follow me now, do not cry anymore
And now scream and shout:
Never give up!!!

Streets on fire and broken lifes
Something inside me, terrifies me
I feel it I do it, I hear the sound
No lies, no fear of thundering

And many bastards with "pay to play"
Like dirty dogs, you sacrifice
No one will survive... only our sound
Only our passion

Scream and shout like a mad dog
No remorse, we're ready to explode
Follow me now, do not cry anymore
And now scream and shout:
Never give up!!!
