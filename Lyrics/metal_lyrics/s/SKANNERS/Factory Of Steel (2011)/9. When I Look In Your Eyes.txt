When the night come down
And waits for the death
I feel's like a liberation
And your body is cold
Ready to fly again
It's time to be free

Aahhh ahhh ahhhh....

When I look in your eyes
And I see something shining in the night
Now I am here again
Take my hand the light is waiting

I am close to you
Won't leave you alone
Your energy and freedom
Won't retrace your step
The undertaker is back
And carry's you through the light

Aahhh ahhh ahhhh....

When I look in your eyes
And I see something shining in the night
Now I am here again
Take my hand the light is waiting
