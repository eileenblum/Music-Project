When the darkness is coming
Everything has to die
Only the warriors
Will survive

No time to surrender
No time to gorget
I have to fight with my halberd

And the fire's still burning
Inside my heart
And the metal's returning
In my soul
And the fire's still burning
I don't care what they say
And the metal's returning
In my soul

When the darkness is coming
Everything has to die
Only the warriors
Will survive

And the fire's still burning
Inside my heart
And the metal's returning
In my soul
And the fire's still burning
I don't care what they say
And the metal's returning
In my soul
