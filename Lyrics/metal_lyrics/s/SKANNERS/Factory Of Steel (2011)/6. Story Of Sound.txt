I write this story in the name of sound
That has changed my life
It's no illusion, it's reality
It's the truth inside of me

Destination straight to my soul
Rolling and twisting my mind
That remembers the spirit of my past
This is what I have found at last
And the story will never end

Oh I cry, this sound forever
Oh I cry, forever together

It's always in my dreams
It's close, in my heart
Like a fire inside

And the flame still burns
Brightening my soul
The reason to survive
And the story will never die

I cry this sound forever
I cry forever and ever
I cry this sound forever
Now and forever
