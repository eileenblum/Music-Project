Shadows and dust
My eyes 're on fire
Penetrating lights like
Angry animals
Ready to sacrifice
The energy prepared on back

Lightning sound
Lights for you
Like a thunder
Like hell
I see...
Screams at me:
We are metalheads!

We rock the nations
Like hell
We rock the nations
The final spell
We rock the nations
My heart still burns, tonight

Now we are ready
To give you the power
Follow me, I'll bring you to hell

We rock the nations
Like hell
We rock the nations
The final spell
We rock the nations
My heart still burns tonight
