Smoke and fog in front of me
The time is coming, this is reality
Rolling in through the darkness
The steel factory is waiting for me

Flash and lights, noise of metal that rise
In my head, in my soul
The memory is still strong inside of me
Like a hellish beast without mercy

Like warriors ready for battle
Run to meet the cruel fate

Factory of steel
I never forget
Road to hell
Factory of steel
In a darkest place...
Factory of steel

In the night. I see the light breaks the sky
Steel and fire
I will remember forever

Like warriors ready for battle
Run to meet the cruel fate

Factory of steel
I never forget
Road to hell
Factory of steel
In a darkest place...
Factory of steel
