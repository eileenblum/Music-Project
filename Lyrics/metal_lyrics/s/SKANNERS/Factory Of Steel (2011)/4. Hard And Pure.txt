There were five really good friends
Hanging out in the streets
Searching for something now
Their dreams come true

Born in a metal square
Living to survive
Only sluts and fucking drugs
Every day, every night

Playing metal, sound of hell
Fame and glory, they found the key

Hard and pure
Blood and passion
Hard and pure
Straight in your face
Hard and pure
It's true emotion
Hard and pure
Defenders with style

After 25 years riding the same
Metal wave
The lights of the stage
Will be on again

All your heads explode
The rolling thunder grows
Inside only metal
We are hard and pure
