Something noisy like
A killing machine
I never look back
You are in front of me
I like to do something
You have to go down
You've got to give up
And now I'll show my gun

Give it up, ooh baby
Go down, baby, baby, baby

Tonight, tonight, tonight
I feel alright with you again, tonight!
Tonight... you are my delight, with you again
Tonight!!
When I feel your body is hot
I'm the Iron Man

You are here to ask me
For something more
And my beast is waiting only for you
Oh baby, I've got you under my skin
The Iron Man's riding
Like a wind

Give it up, ooh baby
Go down, baby, baby, baby

Tonight...
