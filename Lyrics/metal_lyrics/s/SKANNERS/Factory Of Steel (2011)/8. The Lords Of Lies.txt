These are the lords of lies
With eyes of fire
And with their chairs of leather
You promise glory forever

Hungry beasts well dressed and false
Are ready to suck it all
Just like filthy animals

The lords of lies
Only words, I will fight
Don't tell me why

The lords of lies
Like vampires in the night
Don't tell me why, don't tell me lies

And how much money is returned
False faces empty words
Killing all your ways
Killing your future
Never showing mercy for you

And the time is right
Nothing and nobody will stop me
And now I am free

I have always believed in myself
I have always fought against everything
Oh my lord I do not believe the stories
Because we born
Just to play rock 'n' roll
