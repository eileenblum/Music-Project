[Music: Drake/Wright, Lyrics: Drake]

Life is suffocating me
Nowhere to go, nothing to see
If I could see the end
Then I'd be free

Life is suffocating me
Nowhere to go, nothing to see
If I could see the end
Then I'd be free

So I live on today
Take all the chances that come my way
No one looks out for me
There's only one way it can be

Take it back with the swing of an axe
What's done is done as I'm drenched with blood
No remorse as I silenced their cries
Pain and anguish as they looked in my eyes
Release my anger through cathartic attacks
Hate returns so I always come back
Mind's been warped from the senseless violence
Day is done, ended by silence

Life is suffocating me
Nowhere to go, nothing to see
If I could see the end
Then I'd be free

Life is suffocating me
Nowhere to go, nothing to see
If I could see the end
Then I'd be free

I live to see another day
No one listens to what I say
I see what they can't see
That's how I was meant to be

Take it back with the swing of an axe
What's done is done as I'm drenched with blood
No remorse as I silenced their cries
Pain and anguish as they looked in my eyes
Release my anger through cathartic attacks
Hate returns so I always come back
Mind's been warped from the senseless violence
Day is done, ended by silence

Life is suffocating me
Nowhere to go, nothing to see
If I could see the end
Then I'd be free

Life is suffocating me
Nowhere to go, nothing to see
If I could see the end
Then I'd be free

Why, am I suffering
To this world I mean nothing
So I take it all back
I'm the reason that this world's black

Life is suffocating me
Nowhere to go, nothing to see
If I could see the end
Then I'd be free
