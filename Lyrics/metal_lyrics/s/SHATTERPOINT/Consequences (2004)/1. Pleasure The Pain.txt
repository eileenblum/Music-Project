[Music: Drake/Wright, Lyrics: Drake]

Born to waste away
Internal war is grave
And no one's there to heal my sorrow
Dead tomorrow
Road to nowhere
Faceless nightmare
The victimless rage that leaves me hollow
Non-conformity
Spreading my disease
Day by day my hate gets stronger
Days get longer
Beyond my misery
Confined in agony
Kill or be killed in damnation

On my way to pleasure the pain
An altered state of insanity

Sacrifice my life
Deadly euphoric strife
The hunger leads to my demise
Emotions die
Mind disorder
Mental torture
My head's left vacant, nothing's sacred
No serenity leaves me empty
Don't know what's wrong, don't care what's right
Lost deception
Violent perception
Last breath has been taken, unforgiven

On my way to pleasure the pain
An altered state of insanity
