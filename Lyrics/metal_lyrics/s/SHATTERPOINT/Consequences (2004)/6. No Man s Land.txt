[Music: Drake/Wright, Lyrics: Drake/Wright]

No man's land

Brave until you're nothing without us
Separate, initiate your fate
Enlist, 'cause you never asked for this
Say good bye son you're destined to die
Bravery will mean shit when you're dead
Don't be sucked into the lies you are fed
Don't be fooled or nothing here in no man's land

Become a pawn, kill as much as you can
The fear of dying leaves you dead where you stand
It's all or nothing here in no man's land

Went and took my life away
Taken out of the ground I lay
For this cost my life I pay
Just another in a crowded grave

Kill until you hit the ground
Mindless warfare, relentless sound
Sound of agony propels the deadly rounds
Lose control as death surrounds
Bravery will mean shit when you're gone
You've been robbed of your life
Don't be fooled because alone you will stand
It's all or nothing here in no man's land

Went and took my life away
Taken out of the ground I lay
For this cost my life I pay
Just another in a crowded grave

[Solo: Wright]

Went and took my life away
Taken out of the ground I lay
For this cost my life I pay
Just another in a crowded grave
