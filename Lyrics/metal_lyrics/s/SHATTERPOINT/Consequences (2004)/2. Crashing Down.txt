[Music: Drake, Lyrics: Drake/Baxter/Zeeman]

Crashing down torn by hate
You'll get yours throughout fate
You only had to make one mistake
Crashing down torn by hate
There's only so much one country can take
In the end we will not break

Until the end
You can take my life
Armed with pride
For those who died

Until the end
You can take my life
Armed with pride
For those who died

You tried to beak us down
In to the ground
But it's not that easy

You tried to beak us down
In to the ground
But it's not that easy

You tried to beak us down
In to the ground
But it's not that easy
It's not that easy

Crashing down torn by hate
They once stood tall but now lie in remains
These vivid memories carved in stone on my brain
Crashing down torn by hate
I hope you got your fifteen minutes of fame
He is the reason you go down in flames

Until the end
You can take my life
Armed with pride
For those who died

Until the end
You can take my life
Armed with pride
For those who died

You tried to beak us down
In to the ground
But it's not that easy

You tried to beak us down
In to the ground
But it's not that easy

You tried to beak us down
In to the ground
But it's not that easy
It's not that easy

[Solo: Wright]
