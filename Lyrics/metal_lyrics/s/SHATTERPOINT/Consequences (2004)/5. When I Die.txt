[Music: Drake, Lyrics: Drake/Wright]

[Solo: Dawson]

Numb agony
As I fade away
Here today
Gone tomorrow

But I won't keep myself down
I'm not finished, until I'm in the ground
Each step I take, gives meaning to those I've taken
To make a difference is the path I have chosen

Yeah, I won't be beaten down again
Take a look into my eyes
Forever, I will take my place in time
I'll be remembered when I die

Lost memories
Pain without serenity
Waste away
No more sorrow

But I won't keep myself down
I'm not finished, until I'm in the ground
Each step I take, gives meaning to those I've taken
To make a difference is the path I have chosen

Yeah, I won't be beaten down again
Take a look into my eyes
Forever, I will take my place in time
I'll be remembered when I die

When I die
When I die

When I die I'll go with pride
My fist raised high, all fear aside
Look into my eyes, I've told no lies
Hate relies on your fate denied
I was knocked down but now I rise
The scorn I drown keeps me alive
Not every man truly lives
But every man has to die

When I die
When I die

When I die I'll go with pride
My fist raised high, all fear aside
Look into my eyes, I've told no lies
Hate relies on your fate denied
I was knocked down but now I rise
The scorn I drown keeps me alive
Not every man truly lives
But every man has to die
