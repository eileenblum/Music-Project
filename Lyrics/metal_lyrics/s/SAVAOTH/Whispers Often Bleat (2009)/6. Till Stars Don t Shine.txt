Only dark, and winter is cold
Smells like blood upon the blackened snow
Countless height and ancient sea
Demons are the witness and their cruelty
Futile is my life waiting mortal signs of god
Your wrath is what to give
Your wrath to uranian one
Your face like inward wrench
Scares the cry in my thoughts
The stream of tears is fresh
Stops the time with no remorse
Land the day and see my trails
Is where to see my cosmic lies
Take the star against full moon
To close eternally my eyes
The serpent takes the sun
Conspiracy of the snake
Brinks the star against full moon
Leaves the garden through the gate
The rayless light will disappear
It's replaced by sombrous shine
Neither principle can forget the prophet's crime
Land the day and see my trails
Is where to see my cosmic lies
Take the star against full moon
To close eternally my eyes
Only dark, and winter is cold
Smells like blood upon the blackened snow
Countless height and ancient sea
Demons are the witness and their cruelty
