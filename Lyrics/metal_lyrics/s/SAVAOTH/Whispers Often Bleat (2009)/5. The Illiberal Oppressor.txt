Her eyes so pale witness of beauty
Innocence and weakness
The virtue of perfection
Flawless to embellish this valued sacrifice
To every illiberal oppressor
Wretched structures, wrecked and broken
Her beauty lost forever opposed to eternity
Her eyes so pale witness of beauty
Innocence and weakness
The virtue of perfection
Flawless to embellish this valued sacrifice
To every illiberal oppressor
Bring the razor upon the body
Bring the weakness of the cross
With the wisdom from wherein
Like the plot of a thousand lies
