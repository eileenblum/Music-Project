You are my virtuous whore,
My only costly courtesan
But I remain a slave of yours,
So weakly at your side.
I acclaim you with honor and pride that be hove to thee
Tell me tales of dejected pinfold
You, storyteller
Show me sham piety
But why do I accredit?
Just to embrace your body?
I curse you dripping blood on the cross forever
I acclaim you with honor and pride forever
Now he is dead on the cross dripping blood and this is forever...
Others have grails...
You have seas...
