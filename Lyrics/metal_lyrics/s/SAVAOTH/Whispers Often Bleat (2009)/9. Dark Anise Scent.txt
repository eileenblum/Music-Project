Prison is what I see as a prison cell
This seems so cold
My absinthe is all
My soleness and my second soul
Dark anise scent ruining my day
Prison seems as precise as my second hell
This seems so old
My absinthe prevails my madness and my sick soul
It's been so hard
Revealing my second nature and second soul
My eyes are open forever to see your fall
Prison is what I see as a prison cell
This seems so cold
My absinthe is all
My soleness and my second soul
