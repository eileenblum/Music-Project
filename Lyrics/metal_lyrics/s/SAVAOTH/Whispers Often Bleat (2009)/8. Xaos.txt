Alone as I sigh I remember you
No reason to lie you were the only way...
Forever and eternally I reflect the putrefied recommend...
Wistful am I?
The start of your longest journey, an indelible mark that will never
Fade away
Lone am I?
In the loss of the broken promise you couldn't keep
Grieved?
I am...
For my mortality and for yours...
Bewail this remedy again
Reminds me of the days when you draped my pure heart
Wistful am I?
The start of your longest journey, an indelible mark that will never
Fade away
Lone am I?
In the loss of the broken promise you couldn't keep
Grieved?
I am...
For my mortality and for yours...
Soleness and ratification...
You thrill the stream of my imagination...
Alone as I sigh I remember you
No reason to lie you were the only way...
Forever and eternally I reflect the putrefied recommend...
Wistful am I?
The start of your longest journey, an indelible mark that will never
Fade away
Lone am I?
In the loss of the broken promise you couldn't keep
Grieved?
I am...
For my mortality and for yours...
