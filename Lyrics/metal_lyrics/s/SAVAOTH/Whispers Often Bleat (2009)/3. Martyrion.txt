Father of lies, it's burning
Another reward...
I try the grand of Satan
That will remedy every mistake
I gibe the white, that would remedy every mistake...
I follow the road of sin
The beginning of Armageddon.
My fleece of sin
My play of the role
I smash their "grace" for him
Dark fall forever...
Father of lies, it's burning
Another reward...
I try the grand of Satan
That will remedy every mistake
I gibe the white, that would remedy every mistake...
I follow the road of sin
The beginning of Armageddon.
Do not cross my way
Or I'll rape your Jesus' offspring
Defective and lame...
To pray the grateful Satan
Get off my way
Your god is cause of laughter
Defective and lame...
To pray the grateful Satan
