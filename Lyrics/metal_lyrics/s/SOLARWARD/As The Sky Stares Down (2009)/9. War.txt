Scorched earth turns to dust beneath our feet
Vaporizing winds, their cold and lifeless breath
We'll never see the sky above so blue and clear
Its purity deceased, it bears the seeds of death

Boiling chaos
The light became too bright for the tired eyes
The air is too rough for the burnt skin
The new suns rise from the pits
This is the end of the world at last

Black clouds travel across the sky
Glowing fire consumes everything with no remorse
Death and destruction come from above
No salvation from the allcrushing force

Boiling chaos
The light became too bright for the tired eyes
The air is too rough for the burnt skin
The new suns rise from the pits
This is the end of the world at last

Crush the weakness
May its roots be incinerated
The sacred purity of nuclear fire
Spreads over the defiled planet
To burn the filth away
