When the day warmth starts to fade away
When the stars are drawn sharply in the sky
When the breath of night wind touches your face
When the crimson moon rises high

Sleeping nature, calm my boiling soul
Open up your gates, let me walk inside
Am I deaf or still I'll hear your call
Can I see the night's endless light

Still we stand in silence all as one
Those who've found the way through the darkness' tide
Those who've come to night realm and are gone
Nevermore they're back from the other side
