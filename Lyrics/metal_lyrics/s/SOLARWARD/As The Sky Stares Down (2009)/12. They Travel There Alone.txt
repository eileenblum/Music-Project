Dying nations, sleeping lands
Will the reign of chaos embrace our world forever
Or will the sons of their ancestors arise

So wake up and raise your stare, they travel there alone
Forged upon the anvils you have never heared of
They walk their ways with pride

All the words are said in vain
All the shields are cracked and all the swords are broken
Is that really so? Are they?

So wake up and raise your stare, they travel there alone
Showing confidence that hope cannot compete with
They'll walk their ways until the end
