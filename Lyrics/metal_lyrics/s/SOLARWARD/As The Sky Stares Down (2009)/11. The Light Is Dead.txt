Silent we stand blinded by the smoke
Of extinguished fires of sacred faith
Our figures of stone will turn to dust
That winds will carry away far beyond time

This world is cursed to fade away
The light is dead, the darkness comes
Embracing us, so deep we fall
Into the emptiness of no return

The ancient memories
The stone's still keeping them alive
Recall the glory times we faced the golden dawn
We drank our power
From nature's wells of harmony
The sky itself led us towards the rising sun

Standing in silent reproach
Recalling the moments of glory and pride
Remember the one that others have lost
Keep the one that others betrayed
