The darkest moment of the night comes
The time when the moonglow fades out
But the sunrise still waits for its hour
It's time to make a step into the twilight

A step into the world of shadows
Drawn in grey and black colours
The world of pure nature's sleep
That inevitably comes to an end

While the world around you is sleeping
You stand among the silent hills and shades of trees
Wake up and feel the awakening
Of the darkened realm you belong to
