Hollow plains and forests surround me
As the light sets the darkness in demise
Nothing breaks the silence around me
Fallen from the pale morning skies

Silence
So quiet you hear the snowflakes falling
Whiteness blinds you
Look up
Do you see the clouds flowing
Feel the pressure
From above

Now I'm leaving this place of suppression and pain
Where the life is disguised under blankets of ice
But after all I'll come back here and see it again
When the sun will enlight the pale morning skies
