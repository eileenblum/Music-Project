Primarity supreme, darkness eternal
That's from what we arise
So natural that no one would notice
Till the light of sunrise

Sinking in waters as dark as night
Suffocating with anger
Still we managed to stay alive
To become much stronger

Darkness eternal blindfolds our eyes
Each day it penetrates inside our souls
Coursing through veins as cold as ice
Slowly it flows but louder sound its calls
