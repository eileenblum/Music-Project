Misty horizon
Hides the unknown
This frozen land
Waits for your steps
Silent glaciers
Hard as stone
This frozen land
Waits for your steps

Do you feel strong enough to start this way?
Suffering and pain will be your only companions
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
So do you feel strong enough?

You roam through snowy storms and piercing winds
Towards the place where sky and ground unite
The one what dies and then anew redeems
Again
Again

Appraise your aim
Is it worthy of all that you can
From far you came
Will you turn back and suffer again
Once you've made
The choice that defined your life
Now it's your fate
To go where sky and ground unite

You roam through snowy storms and piercing winds
Towards the place where sky and ground unite
The one what dies and then anew redeems
Again
Again
