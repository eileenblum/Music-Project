Look into the darkened skies and see the moonlight drains
As the blackness concentrate around the lunar stains
Fading away like a smoke on the wind
Forever and now will the eclipse begin

Closing lid devours the moon so slowly and so grim
Inevitably comes the moment when the darkness rules supreme
Releasing the last weak and dying moonshine
The eye of the skies is now closed and blind

Remember the time
When the small moments of emptiness arrived

Faded shadows surround you
For the light will arise

Now the darkest moments passed, again the light will flow
Shaded circle of the moon anew begins to grow
From ashes arises the eye of the skies
Eternal its glow is and face undisguised
