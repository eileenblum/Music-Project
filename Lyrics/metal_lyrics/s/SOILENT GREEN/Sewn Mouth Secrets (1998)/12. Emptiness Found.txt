a cycle reborn and abused
pry into subconcious pain
find these fearful solutions
pride wears a mask of ignorance
speak these simple words of balance
losing tolerance... don't stutter a word
a kiss... a touch... a knife... my blood
progression... regression...
pressed for your time
my moves are silent
as i break through loses
i sat and looked and lost the days
no simple answers...
lend a spare hand
i'll leave behind
the darkened idea inside
a plague of neglect
to my brothers of the past
the struggle for delirium
a small white padded room
a cross-breed instinct
symptoms of a youth alone
left behind a soul-less behind
criminal in the eyes of all
slap to the face... for disgrace
a father's pride... fullfill this dream
i hate pride... not a part of my dreams
tension builds... idols destroyed
this instinct... release of all
glorify pain... for self high
hands of time... patient stride
teach others more... personal gain
these lovely thoughts
coated in silky sickness
a depressive contraceptive
for my actions
my body and mind stronger
at youngest point of life
let this tenderness i have
fall in flames
no release... grip... hold tight
the warm kiss of sensual delight
touch this smile...
the locked-down love
chained deep inside
a mistrust faith... i can't relate
lately i can't tolerate
repress myself... kept my mouth shut
no longer will i pain myself
i've got something inside
that i'll never hide
no drug-induced thought
not even an unsober word
my actions are pure...
make my discipline heard
i've lied here for the longest time
now is the time, make a stand
i push too hard, nothing too lose
will not get out... stand-off
