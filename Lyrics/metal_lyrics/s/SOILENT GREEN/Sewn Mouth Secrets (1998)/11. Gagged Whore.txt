innocence of the bruises on your face
now lay in this filth to display
gagged lungs... breathe the frost
the stench of incest
lay there quiet bitch
it was your choice
spitting in each others' mouth
that was the extreme for you
expose yourself with sticky fingers
while the roses sink into crimson
swallow the bitterness of my tongue
absorb the nectar of my discharge
as i watch the ecstacy run through you
stop with all the bullshit games
your life is at stake and you're to blame
things seem hard now
but you're dead to me
think about hurt
now i reflect that hurt on you
time for this game at hand
breaking down this norm
replacing all that's gone
grab by the throat
you pressured me into this
now you've gone too far
i'll take advantage of this time
making you a slave to anger
don't try slowing this hate
the power i hold is fate
white lace covered in indulgence
lurid body covered in shame
reflection of this degrading
mother of a new race
a kiss is nothing more than rage
perish amongst courtship
enchant the captor
mesmerize the beauty
blind only the unchosen
eyes drill through walls of flesh
looking upward with deep thoughts
repress... repress my love...
down on your knees you slut
prepare for this most tender fuck
i'll make you lust for cunt
silently violent
endear... endear your cunt...
shards of glass...
precisely cut
incisions made
smearing this ecstacy
on my genitals
stifled bitch
taped-up mouth...
screams unheard
yelling to make you choke
this goatish act...
tying these knots
of swift beatings on you
