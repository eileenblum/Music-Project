a child kneeling facing the corner
her somber dialect exposed
a rape enclosed innocence
will she ever feel the same?
a touch of battery and deviance
the sweat of sex urges more
drug-induced hormone a penalty
stupid mistakes made-
ignorant mistakes others make
picking scabs from fresh scars
making newer pain
this youth's thought twisted
with aggravation
she's punished...
they're to blame
sitting naked on the cold floor...
not knowing why
hold her hand through rape
she has grown to dominate
twist the minds of men
leeching off other's unjest fate
misuse to gain an easy taste
too drastic for space to conceive
tendencies of emotion pushed aside
to drown in depression
circle lapping in here head
orgasm for her pain
moving on... no regrets
these promises she can't keep
no room for expectations
sightless brain
hands of filth disobey...
actions that betray
a nakedness not to touch...
too much time for her
uncivilized
compromise this action
breathless kiss...
her hair in knots
inside-out and backwards
she puts her dress on
underwear still wrapped
around her legs
weakness overridden by temptations
beauty creates the ugliness of lust
urge of rejection i
n patterns of caressing
running fingers
over frost-ridden emotion
this blocked-out...
a dirty man's thoughtpleasure the price
not ungenerous...
being asked she resents
quit wanting and she'll give
