The aesthetics of this grace enslaved
Fears are worn proudly as a name
Progressive discipline in preventing this adapted action of disrespect
Conspiracy of a loyal soul that will gain self-awareness once given the fact
Stitches across the forehead
An example of your days of protest
Natural selection of pandemic proportion
Embraced for these slave intentions
This is where commitment happens
This is how we end our days
War-torn emotions of distant failures
Eclipse this sensation of conformity
Soothing the soul with a solitude
An inversion of these social barriers
Eyes covered by manipulated hands
An exposed terrain of exhausted reaction
An ownership of being
It belonged to the young
An unbridled vengeance
From a censored tongue
Initiate this emotion
Underbelly of a refined reprisal
Time to stifle this tired idea of wayward action.
