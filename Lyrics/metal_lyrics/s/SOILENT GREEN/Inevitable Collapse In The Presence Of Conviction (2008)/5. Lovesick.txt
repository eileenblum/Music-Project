Accustom to the disaster at the end of the day
Promises swarm in lies of respect
Another loveless scar of a haunting mistake
Useless screaming in a locked room alone
Favoring your selfish plague, this mark of rage
Vision of resentment, respect is to blame
Once on your back and forever on your knees
Pray for this lust and release our fatal disease
Tried to cope, unkind remarks, these terms left unsaid
Apology for the hunted, the hand that gave this wound
Mother tongue is making an overachiever of you again
Invested this time in breaking the neck of virtue
An ego that can bruise with ease
This pair of heart-shaped lips would tear out your heart
Skinned knees across hard wood floors
Pulled hair, bruised skin, argument then war
This is the way we pay respect for this sin
Fine line, hate divine
Focus in on this lost essence that will end up eating what you have left
Simplified this love, falling into these bad times
Fingertips on bruised lips
This time a kiss won't make it better
Love lies dead in our imitation of passion
Blood stained mind with hate filled design
Her head tilts back as essence flows from these wrists of love
Unsettled in commitments like these
For better or worse, now begging grace
In words of wrath, union of disaster
The non-sterile thought of this hated design
These examples have been placed in clear view before
Forcing this period of time we called forever
Unwinding to the sound of her stopping breath
Understanding the truth of our end.
