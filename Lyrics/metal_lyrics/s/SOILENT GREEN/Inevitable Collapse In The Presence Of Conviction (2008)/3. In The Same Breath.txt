Belittling has all the moments of prolonged embarrassment
Tainted pain has the capacity to be released in this annoyance
A self-relying action that none of us control
This spineless outbreak in limitless expression
Questioning the contemplated stare
Dismissed for lack of evidence
In fatal words comes this unclear aspect
Having this less admired stance
Adverse remarks from odd encounters
To override a template for this honesty
Inherit fearful unsaid terms
Bolt the locks, embrace for the law
Just can't help to even the score
Lock those doors and keep her gagged
It's the best bet to make them beg
Let's draw an X across our lips and play like nothing was said
Would you have kept this secret from tumbling off your breath?
Follow the numerous herds of stale encounters
A personal question of a journey yet achieved
Our acts of demands
Social bracket of put downs
Agree to disagree, have these days of misery
Sit back and let those feelings take control
Superficial reference to the things great and small
Serious pain from the laws that have made us fall
Time to ask for it back
It's all that you got
Strict words from weak discipline
Carried over from the last generation
Regarded as an envious outlook
A believer that models murder as a god.
