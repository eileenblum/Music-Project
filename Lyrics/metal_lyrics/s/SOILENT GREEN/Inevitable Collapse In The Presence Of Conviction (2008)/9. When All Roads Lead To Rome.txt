Belligerent association to these finer aspects of failure
The unbecoming attitude that leads to self-destruction, a comfort zone lost
Blind tolerance in this declining behavior
Undeniable negative facts, plain as day
Transcendence through this cynical adaption
Another one of those days calling for mercy
These desires of lost respect
Symptoms of inflicting regret
This empty experience
For a lonely, forged life
Deviation from attributes
This effect on the human mind
A lot less opinions
Diagnosed imperfection
These hands are tied again
At risk with discretion to another self-imploding disaster
Translate these actions over a course of aggravation
Climbing walls of tense concern
A contagious wave of invasion
Hallcincinating the improbable
Annoyed in tasks that are not absorbed
Declining a civilized sense of efforts
Insensible in the structure of life
Defy the limits of mental strategy
Timeless efforts of personal tragedy
One more time, like a blown fuse
Give me some space, all roads lead to Rome
Slicing the wrists
A silence spent
Run this epic lie
A final test
Breathtaking madness
Sidetracked in failing
Cry for this last sip of spilled wine
Soured compassion, unlikely retractions
Spoiled tongue from the jaws of spite
Impulse of failure
Confidence deprived
Persist after this hated stance
Emotional tirade
Into the mouth of real life
Commitment in words of oppression
Living out all the contradictions you have proposed
Hidden pasts find a way back in better times
Integrated into a puzzle of alliances with enemies
Hinder the wasted perfection, no logical question
Don't you just love the way contradiction rolls its eyes?
