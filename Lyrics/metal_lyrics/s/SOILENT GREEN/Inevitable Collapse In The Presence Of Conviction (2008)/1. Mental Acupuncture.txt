Time to assign the blame
Another technique
Bury the dead
Before plague makes it's name
Dealing with the world of authority
Step back and take that breath
No arguing over the quality
Apply to these corrective habits
Associated timeline of regression
Plainly the wish of the numb
Worked hard to beat the system
Victimized and still won
Over the hump, it's my turn now
I've fought hard to turn this around
Here's a tip that'll blow your mind
Carbine stock for keeping this calm
Force feed the ideas of positive awareness
Lending this strength to penalized stages
Now affixed to these perverted actions
Devoted plenty to this practical goal
Words must die in fated force
The life of this becoming now laid to rest
Evaluated for further development
In causing this outbreak
Antagonist that is hopeless in satisfaction
A contribution to this stagnated expansion
Retracted this violence instead of overreacting
Normal in the eyes of reason, an overrun anthem
Sometimes my silence can exhaust the confusion of others
Reminders of the way we have embraced our retribution
In time my devotion will lend bleeding truth to our oath
Repetitive behavior on the verge of personal completion
Wished and burnt it all away
Slamming doors with an attitude breached
Is this forgiveness that I have kept a quiet disease?
Kept this secret
For burning bridges
Only to swallow
Words of my own hope.
