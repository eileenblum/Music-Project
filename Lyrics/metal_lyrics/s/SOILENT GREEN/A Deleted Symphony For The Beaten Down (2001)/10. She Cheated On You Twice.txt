Love is just a word 
That is stepped upon 
Complications, to many 
Less fortunate one 
Turn around lies 
At a young age 
Smiling, telling lies 
Bittersweet rage 

Behind closed doors 
A whore amongst whores 
Try to be a true man 
Stagnated moral code 
Submission beyond 
Last temptation 
This gift of love 
Transcends into sin 

A child or man 
Cold heart in hand 
Grow through it 
Drastic changes 

She wanted to be mine 
But she lost her mind 
This bitter taste of remorse 
This love, a lost cause 

Sworn to freeze over with cold emotion 
Drowning her lips with an untold sort o kiss 
A non-temperamental manner to induce this self hate 
Too many days pass as you flirt 

The stab holes are too many 
Not enough to kill, should have made sure 
I've seen them slit their wrists in a coward's fashion 
Don't attempt, fulfill the after regret 
Your hate is weak, weakening your ambition 
Take your own life 

Feeling like someone pushed you to the end of a line 
Not a desire inside of you 
God damn this feeling, this love is growing more 
Got to reject it, can't neglect it 
An unforgiving touch that led to years of stress 
Cut with the knife of pleasure and pain 

One week of peace with your love 
One week of silence for your lust 
Lost in indulgence within a general frame 
Boy kicks girl...setting a lifetimes trade 

An unearthly weakness to override a quest 
She swore, she wouldn't tell 
These condescending words mean nothing 
She said she wouldn't lie 
This search for stability through a mental strain 
Cost of loss thru suffering 
Take an overdose of the quitters' game 

Hating this feeling 
To drunk...another drink 
Wash away the trouble 
Take away the pain 
Lack of sleep 
Chest tight Damn that loss 
Punishment of a third degree 

Believing she was real 
Buying her lust Tying her arms in the most uncompromising manner 
She wants more, she begs for more 
Taste this love of shameful literature 
A burden for the level of second hand stress 
A childhood picture coming to life 

These long-winded guilt trips are such an obsolete breath of life 
Got to bleed this contamination out of my soul 
A sense of uneasiness with to much kindness 
Somewhere in thee apologies the devil lurks
