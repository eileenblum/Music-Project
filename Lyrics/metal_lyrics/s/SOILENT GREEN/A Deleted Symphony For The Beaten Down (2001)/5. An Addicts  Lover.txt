Her mother used to hit her 
To an uncontrolled consumption of an absolute solution 
Experience with drug abuse 
Taking this drug of peace 
Slowly taking its toll 

Never question, love thru addiction 
Collecting this emptiness 
Recollect a calm self-centered guess 
Every broken promise 
To bleed the soul free 
Faith is not the answer 
A promise that must end 

Left her standing to face her own way 
Face to face 

Thought you could... 
Never thought you would... 
Fall this steep 

Overdose intentional 
5 or 6 times 
For reasons being to die 

Broken out fight 
Unable to focus 

Late night on knees 
Scraping scarred brush burns 
A lethal move for ecstasy 

Lying curled-up in the corner of the bathroom 
Hung over from the night before 
A wrong signal for an intertwined love affair 
Putting yourself in a disaster over a childish dare 
Eyes opening to smooth trail of blood on the floor 
Leading to the trash can next to the door 

You wanted to be intimate...he wanted to fuck 
Skill of prostitution down the drain for one more dose 

Indulge in the innocence of each other's addiction 
Sitting next to your mate doing drug time 
Vintage lust for a lost modern age
