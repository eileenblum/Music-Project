Murderer, absorbed in your flame 
To captors mind the eyes are dim to close 
Vicious attempt to let this pain be shown 

My breath knotted (grasping for air through lust)

Distinctively crimson a wonder of wretchedness 
Taste my thoughts 
Of untold taboo 
Avoid caress 
Touch of rape 

The saliva from your lips is glossy 
Shown questioned faces gain an erotic taste 
To die a thousand times before dying 
Pray once and die a thousand more 

Broken puzzle 
Missing pieces 
Choking words 

Murdering this sweet innocence 
Saving from these evil needs 
Tortured by a needless soul 
I'm someone to protect you 
Using all that's left for warmth 
Inserting into bloodied orifices 
Pale skin before the light 
Pale skin after the night 

Fondling yourself, look at me with deepness 
Enrage myself being for masturbation 

Anger strides with swift motion of hurt 
Feeding this grin of displeasure 
The stepping-stones of lust are drowned 
Licking the scars of your fate 

Background flashing with intensity 

Speechless figure With blindfold on 
Hands are removed 

Silhouette pulsing with deviance 

The moral part a canvas 
I am the artist You are my creation 

Red shocks this vulgar picture 

Cyprian angels mourning 
Condemned to weep impure 
Kindred of the plenty 
Whores that do touch night 
Our night of passion 
Caress you with love 

Cut your neck with words To fuck is rebirth 

Shower me with cynical words from the lips 
Orgasmic thrust with the help of strangling 
Arranging the use to position the body 
Hunger for more than this carnal meat 

She was innocent, she was in love 
Hate is a step, to take her life

Love makes weakness, all these sins 
To fuck is death, to fuck is pure
