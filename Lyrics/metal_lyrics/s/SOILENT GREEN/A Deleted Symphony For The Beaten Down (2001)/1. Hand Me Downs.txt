The unfortunate disposal of this unwanted advice 
An exhausted symbol in clarity through words 

Following a heart beneath a mind of wrong and rights 
Take a strong insight 

Respect is a diseased logic thrown to the wind 
A plotting thought that will destroy all mankind 

Yell until your head stops spinning 
Speak about an idea that will cease to exist 

Pass on this forgotten 
Tradition in morals 
An heirloom of time 
Stands more ground than vice 

Speechless phrases of an exhausted tale 
Myth of a galactic proportion 

Misunderstood overload of rumors 
Legions of disciples pointing fingers 
Judgment of contradiction to forever blind 
A change for better or in worse 

Plagiarizing from these books of life 
Might be doing what you thought was right 
Could be finding out it might be wrong 
Genetic remaster of the twilight zone 

Enemy...inside...a word...a lie 

An older generation felt their young should have more 
A breed sense of selfishness 

To stand a smart ground, to stand a ground at all 
To costly for a human fear 

The little points in time 
That seems like an eternity 
One moment of touch 
A taste of sexual retreat 
To numb a senseless anxiety 
An outgrown stage in life 
Never quite caught on 
Plagued by guilt and loyalty 

Lift the soul 
Into this orgasm of a lost variety 
Sexual discharge of past anxiety 
Anger at peak 
This landscape to old for time to change 
Generation X, the unexplained 

Praising heroes with hidden pasts 
You thought that this was good 
Only if you knew the truth 
Would it change the outlook? 
Your first time love To much left unfinished 
Just another chance
