All given hope's the same 
Now it's all time to kill the pain
Complaints covering a whining tongue 

Try to speak a mouth of truths 
To time to recollect for ill-mannered self-neglect 

Stand on your own two feet 
Stability a broken strand of string 
Outstretched, out of reach 

Not enough rest for this brainstaking quest 
These moods among the elite 

Sitting down...to re-examine mistakes 

Overly analytical war-gaming 
Slurring syllables, un-sober moment one use to regret 

Non-scapegoat mouth...oversee several ideas 

Losing it inside 
These words are like a dyslexic interpretation of the wrong 

A quiet moment for love gone bad
No time to waste for a second guess 
This look on your face
So pathetic 

Stealing fear from an innocent mind 
Distilled existence to collapse into tears 
All in your hands now 
Change it 

Don't be what others think or want 
Fuck the law, create your own 
The heretic, the witch, a martyr for the weak 
Shoved down lives of ambition 

Stop whispering the truth to yourself 
Under a breath of lies, a false disguise 
Spell caster of curse words 
Spoken stones to be thrown at guilt-covered society 

Give it till tomorrow 
Give it a couple days 

Blank face, lying smile 
Bothered by flawed events 

You only wished you hadn't given till it hurt 
A backward decision on your part 
Now this is starting over 
And less the man A selfish instinct overdose 
Re-assure the growth 

A traitor to your own words 
These bitter terms swapped 
Intentions never there 
Never to lend a hand 

Don't look back 
Behind your backs 
They grew to men 

Halt...permission to stand...a grown man 
Symbolize the rape of freedom 
The loss to see all
To decide on your own
