Spread this love of shame 
Forgotten realm of the hypocrite reign 

Honesty...the code to reload 
Aim the gun at the sin taker 
A new trait carrier 
Pass the sin on

All virtues denounced 
The word sin re-pronounced 
The meaning of a way of life 
Compassion filled lies to teach another in un-divine shame 

Break a silent mode 
Preach the breakdown laws 
Moral codes to whores 
Exist or be a tool for the new rule 
Just a blank faced reject 

This mouth shouts war...lies! 

Mouth full of words, nothing to say 
Not a fucking thing 
This target of disrespect, crawling down a stairway of sweat 
Self-tolerance, a skill to learn 
Forgive never forget 
Witnessing all that one could 
You should have been the first to go 

Sarcastic phrases bending on tongues 
Spoken tone of encouragement 
A spreading colony of disarray 
Unfaithful leaders...bending laws 

Do it different 
Again, in the same sequence 
Another drastic measure 
Another lost cause 
A lying smile to comfort 
Soothing unpredicted downfall 
Held close, non-reassurance 
Couldn't even trust your parents 

Word swapping like politicians 
Hatred speaks louder than all 

Maybe it's something more inside 
With yourself, problem solved 
Slit your wrist, save us all 
From your two-faced race 

Can't have your way
It's all the same, everyday 
Lick your wounds and obey 

Struggling to breath 
Noose tight, last choke 
Take a possible last breath 
Be the tyrant, the king 
The one who makes the change 
The trendsetter forever 
The taste of all un-truths
