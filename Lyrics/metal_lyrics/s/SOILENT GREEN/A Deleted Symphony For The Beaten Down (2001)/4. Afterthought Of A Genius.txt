A multitude of anger 
Ring out vulgar tone 
Obscenity fro your pride 
To isolate small flaws 

Down right inhuman 
On the moral ladder 
Escape the cutthroat pack 
Another trend has passed 

Ahead of the line of fools 
Preach to stand above 
To overcome a fault 
Explanation for the weak 
Envied idols die 
Thru these eyes of a jealous mind 
One more bottle of sin 
For this aggravation 

I've watched you lose your temper over small things 
A spoiled child's things 
Kill it all, kill the past, reunite for the final grasp of breath 
A gun in the hand of loyalty, sound of the trigger 
A child of betrayal 
The temper of the times 
Stepping out of this depression to exist 

Man bound to time 
Fighting to control 
Even the most uncontrolled 
Unbalance to extinguish 

No blame or fingers to be pointed 
Standards will be matched 
Live by these words and act on them 
The final note 
The final antidote 
To cause confusion among the masses 

Surpass these people once envied 
Resurgence of youth 
Hating all these promises never kept 
Broken hearts are for romantics 
A dream of love for the dramatic 

Untold form of resurrection 
Another list to re-enlist...understand the way of life 
Persistence will get word of reason 
Pass on a once forgotten tradition in moral praise 

The enemy within knowledge 
Re-molding this integral persona 
Wearing the guilt of dishonesty 
Trying to keep sanity 
Unable to grasp this skill 

This lack of passion 
One-night stands and master plans 
Or have you really forgotten what it is made of? 
Modesty covered with mediocrity 
Stabbing its way to the heart 
Giving up all the emotion in the world 
To have some kind of satisfaction 
Discipline, your natural selection, disposed of 
Disloyalty to high to understand 

The value of man declines once again 
A loss of progress...for this conquest
