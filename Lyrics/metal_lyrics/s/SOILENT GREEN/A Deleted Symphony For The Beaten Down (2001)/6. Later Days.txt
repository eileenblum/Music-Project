You said you didn't love me (a lie) 
You said you didn't care (my lie) 
I've spent an eternity destroying this (to myself) 
As if you weren't there (til I die)

I've lost this taste of inner rage 
A question overlooked from this day-to-day 
Now this time is running low, had to give it away 
Lost this sight, bring it back to life 
Another wasted second to burn myself inside 
Feel all rebuilding to make you repeat it all 

One more dose, another sip 
A few pills at the most 
Breaking this silence 
Of this secure nature 
Not enough rest 

Wondering as you sit and question what went wrong 
Never once offered sanctuary to a truthful cause 
Stop repeating a fault; an apology will end for now 
Slipping into this un-animated world of dizziness 
An empty representation of thought, mistreated wisdom 
Twisted lips speak in vain, for a purpose put to shame 
A double-edged purpose slaying everyone but yourself 
Time is of the essence...patience a blur 

A swarm of thoughts, can't catch a one 
Left empty-minded 
Sitting in these eyes of guilt, outraged 
This barrier for what remains 
Take the disadvantage, a fraction of this life 
Kept close with loss of most 
These lips of misfortune, kissed one to many times 
Taste the truth...the pain 
I've had to gain 

Planning daily...getting nothing done 
Open the hands of a mind-clasped identity 
Taste the bitter blood on these lips 
Taste the betrayal of your unfaithful kiss 

A hindered growth with a grasping head spin 
It will leave one bottled up with a fifth of sin 
To live inside these walls till the day I die 
Totally confined to love held close inside 

Damned to tradition 
Flawless untold superstition 
Trying to find salvation 
An escape from evolution 

Words on top of words 
Towering fortress of this inaction 

These cycles of distrust 
This disease that breeds disgust 
Another for old times sake 
Fell behind in the pack 

No chances, no patience 
Obedience in a mental fraction 

An example of excuse 
The virgin behind logic 
Intimidate this full restraint 
Sink into a lurid thought 

God is dead, love is dead 
Dark thoughts of this un-compassion
