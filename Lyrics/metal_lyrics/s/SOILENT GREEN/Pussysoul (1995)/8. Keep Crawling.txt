Cleanse The Tongue For Speaking
Only Dribbling Nonsense Of Actions
Confuse All The Understandings
The Presence Of All Are One
Backed Against The Word
With The Mind Misled
Release Thoughts Of Few
Stronger Than That Of All
Do Not Touch The Burned
Hands It Breaks The Solidness Of Skin
Enjoyment For A Purpose Am I Condemned To Less?
Better To Taste The Forbidden Fruit Than
Biting Ones Own Tongue
Joining A Deeper Place Inside Of Me, Play My Fear
The Purity That Tolerates Evil-Unpure
Mistake My
Actions And I'll Come Against Your Word
Falter Your Phrases And Fall Deeper In Your Own Shit
Listen To Others While You Lose
Dearest Friends
Simply A Mistake Of Your Righteous Selfish Way
Weakened Are The Many Lives In Which This World Is Built
Contradictory Points Of View Connected To Spirit
Sublime Domination, The Smaller Will Rise
Sacred World Of Continuity, Divine
Word Descends
Liberty Of The Denial
Bringing The Individual
Potential Above Its Head
Pretence Of Criticizing Joining
Words
Being Bickered-Among Fools
Allow The Torn Eyes-To Close
Values Are Among-The Wrong
Scabs On The Hands And Knees-Keep
Crawling
Do Not Touch The Burned Hands It Breaks The Solidness Of Skin
Enjoyment For A Purpose Am I Condemned To Less?
Better To Taste The Forbidden Fruit Than Biting Ones Own Tongue
