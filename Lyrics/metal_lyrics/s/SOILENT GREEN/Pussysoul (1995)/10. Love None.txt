Pattern A Train Of Thought
An Everlasting Word That Lies
The Heart That Feeds Anothers Game
Strings Attached To Control The Trust
Change The Ground Of Terms
Civilized Approach
I'd Rather Put My Hands Around Your Neck
Lies No Longer Believed
Excuses
Unaccepted
My Foot In Your Throat Will Suffice
Waste Of My Sympathy
Try To Change The Blame
Only Will Lead Ot Dangerous
Circumstances
The Problem Is You Bitch
