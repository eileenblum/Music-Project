Get Out, Of My Fucking Way
I Don't Have, Room Or Time For You
Waste Of Shit, You'll Never Amount To Anything
Stuck In, The
Same Deadend Spot
Never Helping Yourself, So No Reason For Me To Help You
What Will You Do When There Isn't Anyone
To
Blame Your Laziness On?
When Your In A Bind You Look For All Sorts Of Help
Don't Even Look My Way
Look My Way, And All I'll
Do Is Laugh As You Go Down
While Others Pass You By
Others Bust Their Ass While You Sit Somewhere And Relax
Too Bad You'll
Just End Up Last
No Respect For Others Who Do What They're Told
Leave Me Hanging On To Drag Your Ass Down Too
No Respect
For Others Who Do What They're Told
Leave Me Hanging With No Respect
And I'll Have Your Ass Hanging On A Cross
The Wrong Of
Way Is All You've Learned
No Concept Of The Right Way World
The Wrong Of Way Is All You've Learned
Changes Of Time Lead You
Away From The Right Way World
Kissing Ass To Get What You Want
Spoiled Ass Bitch, Bastard Cunt
Damn The Ones Like You Who
Get Their Way
That Way Is Wrong And I'll Make Sure You Get Fucked
Prison Life Is Where You Belong, No Wait! That's Too Good For You
Think I'll Just Stick You In A Box And In There You Can Just Rot
