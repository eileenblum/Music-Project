Weak
Thoughtless
Countless Fools Fall Game To The Selfish Way
Acting Out Lives But Their Own Ones
Betray Only Friends To
Move Forward In Social Game
Choose The Stupidity To Be
As You Fall Under Me
Do You Think Your Problems Mean Shit?
See
The Obvious, That Your Lost, Even In Your Mind
Everything You See Has Been Programmed
To Be Stigmatized, Civilized
Projects
Of Worthless
Illegitimate Bastards
Where Crimes Are Mastered
Your Mind Is Not Here
That's Your Mistake
You Think It's A
Problem Of Race?
It's Not Black Or White You See
It's Only Your Stupidity
Slowly Fade
Your Ignorance
My Dominance
