In your ignorant bliss
You did emerge,
A god of flesh in this world.

I ate the fruits of forbidden knowledge
Or discovered the hidden truth,
So cast me down to the lower plains.
Souls I saw descending.

Down to the lower plains
To a lonely planet
Souls I saw ascending
As I drank the stream of the stars.

Lux Fare,
You have seen different heavens
With different stars
And different moons.

My flesh descending,
My soul ascending;
Mine are the highest plains!

[GuÃ°mundur Ãli PÃ¡lmason 1998]
