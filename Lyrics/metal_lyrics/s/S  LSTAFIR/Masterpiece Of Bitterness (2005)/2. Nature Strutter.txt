Although I mourn that place
I would sacrifice the thought
Just to get near

1000 Miles above the ground
I somehow felt so tuned
My private mind faced mesmeration
No such prair I've come across
Such despair, I moved yet still in my steps

Although the time has fled away
I just wanted it to be so malicious
I injected it so deep, like dimensional
Drug in veins
I can't resist it

I see it here now
But still I'm nowhere near
I inhale it as my awe
I crave it beyond the shore
