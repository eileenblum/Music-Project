I've walked paths i swore not to take
I've searched ways that led to dark
It increased my sickness to the edge
I'm in a empty room
Searching it thru

Addicted to self destruction
I bleed with a smile

So sweet I kiss the knife
So hard I puke the smile
So come on, slay my dreadful soul

I brake the circle of oath
That I've chained around me
The deeper the deal is
The smoother the crush is

[AÃ°albjÃ¶rn Tryggvason '04]
