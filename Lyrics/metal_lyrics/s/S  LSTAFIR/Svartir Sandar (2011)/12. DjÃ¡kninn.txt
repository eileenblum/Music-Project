Ãg hef gengiÃ° langan veg,
Ã©g hef margan djÃ¡knann sÃ©Ã°
sopiÃ° seyÃ°i af hans reiÃ°i,
mikiÃ° reynt en get ei gleymt.

Ãokan geymir gamlar syndir,
hvÃ­tir hrafnar, svartir sandar.
SligaÃ° stolt fjarri heimahÃ¶gum.

BlÃ³Ã°bÃ¶ndin steyttÃ¤ skeri.
Brenndar brÃ½r aÃ° baki mÃ©r.
Langt er sÃ­Ã°an mÃ³dinn missti Ã©g.

Gamlir draugar hanga yfir,
skarttans sÃ¡lmar glymja Ã³tt.
Ãttinn boÃ°ar sortans endalok.

[English translation:]

[The Deacon]

I have walked a long road,
I have seen many deacons,
I've drunk magic from his fear
Tried so hard but can't forget

The fog holds old visions
White ravens, black sands
Over-strained pride parts me from home

Blood ties crash against the rocks
Burned bridges behind me
It's been a while since I lost my mind

Old ghosts hang around
The Devil's psalms thunder deep
Dread prays for the end of darkness

GuÃ°mundur Ãli PÃ¡lmason: drums;
