Ãru mÃ­na Ã¡ silfurfati fÃ¦rÃ°i Ã©g Ã¾Ã©r,
en Ã¾Ã©r fannst Ã¾aÃ° ekki nÃ³g.
RyÃ°gaÃ°ur Ã¶ngullinn dorgar Ã¾Ã³ enn.
ÃvÃ­ skarstu ekki Ã¡ fyrr?

HjÃ¡lpaÃ°u, hjÃ¡lpaÃ°u mÃ©r,
Ã©g las Ã­ augum Ã¾Ã©r.

Ãtal sinnum hlÃ³gum undir berum himni.
Einskis annars Ã©g Ã³skaÃ°i.
Blinandi fegurÃ°in yfir allt skein,
sjÃ¡lfum mÃ©r Ã©g bÃ¶lva nÃº.

HjÃ¡lpaÃ°u, hjÃ¡lpaÃ°u mÃ©r,
Ã©g las Ã­ augum Ã¾Ã©r.

Yfir hafiÃ° vindar feyktu Ã¾Ã©r enn Ã¡ nÃ½,
Ã¾vÃ­ varstu ekki kyrr?
Skildir mig eftir vegandi salt.
En aldrei Ã©g aftur snÃ½.

[English translation:]

[Honor]

I gave you my silver-dressed honor
But you didn't think it was enough
A rusty hook jigged still
Why didn't you cut it before?

Help me, help me,
I read in your eyes

We laughed innumerable times under a bare sky
I didn't need anything else
Blinding beauty shone over everything
Now I curse myself again

Help me, help me,
I read in your eyes

The winds over the sea brought you again
Why weren't you at peace?
You call after me carrying salt
But I never turn back
