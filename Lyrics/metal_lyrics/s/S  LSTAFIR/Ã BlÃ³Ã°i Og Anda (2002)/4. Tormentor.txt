Hellfire is erupting,
the day of torture is near,
sacred blood is flowing,
the Tormentor is here

[Chorus:]
Tormentor
Tormentor
Tormentor
We praise the Tormentor

Blood is spilling forth from the dead,
weeping mothers are cast into hell
to burn with their children,
in fire forever shall dwell

The days of the beast have begun,
and the heavens have fallen from the grace.
In the fÃ¶kking pits of bloody Hell
the Tormentor tortures god's race.

[Repeat chorus]

[GuÃ°mundur Ãli PÃ¡lmason 1998]
