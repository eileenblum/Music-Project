I woke up at 9 :30
Thinking I had already missed
The daylight
But it won't be here for
Another two hours.
It doesn't matter
I'll probably sleep through it anyway
I drift through my days like a zombie
Looking for reflections of her
In the grayness of it all.
The daylight only lasts for
A couple of hours
So I haven't seen any colors
For a couple of weeks.
It doesn't matter
I've always been into bleakness
Even my dreams are in black and white.
But maybe that is just because so are
The photos of her,
The last evidence that she,
Happiness really did exist.
