No I don't know where to go
No I don't know how to show
I just don't know it

I have made my final journey
I have made my peace for my own death
Tonight I'm all right through it

If you meet me at the war tonight
I'll show you I'll have death by my side
Golden dawn shall come upon you all
Come taste the venom it'll bleed from my eyes

One of us shall surely die tonight
I don't care, no I just don't care
Either way I die tonight
So I don't care
No I just don't care
