Have you ever felt the pain
Have you ever felt the shame
Have you ever had the fear
Did it hurt like hell for years

Have you ever been afraid
Have you ever gone astray
Is it ever hard to say
That it hurts in every way
Have you ever felt alone
Felt like you never had a home
Did you never see a way
That somehow would have let you stay

Have you ever felt the pain
Have you ever had the fear
Did it hurt like hell for years
Dripping down like rain your tears
Have you ever been on the edge
Have you ever fallen down
Have you ever lost your ground
Have you ever tried the pain

Is it worth the pain to keep on fighting
Is it worth the pain to keep on fighting for this

Maybe this is not the end my friend
Maybe I will see you again
