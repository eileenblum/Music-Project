When all is said and done
I think I'll be one
I've got a bucket of blood in my hand
And I just don't care

I wear my thorns for you
They cut all the way through
This is how I do it
It takes a lot to it, for you

I'm dying here I am
I'm trying here I am
I'm drying, I'm lying here I am

Here I sing my song
But it won't be very long
Come and shelter me here from hell
This ain't no fun

I've swallowed the last of my pride
Oh no longer will I hide
Cut away without a blink of an eye
Or I just might die
