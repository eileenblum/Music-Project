[feat. Patrick Somoulay]The force that you can receive is more than your own
But you've rejected it.

This time we'll see how hard you are praying...
You gnaw bones which were thrown on the ground
The voice of clarity can never reach your empty, hardened heads
The suffocation planted its seeds everywhere and choked your breed

Fight for the glory â but you will die anyway
Fight for the glory and suffer
Because of your weakness which is pride.

[Chorus:]
Take my disfigured hand, it will guide you to the place
Where the sun shines so bright that your eyes can't see the true god!

Ashes scattered the plague, it will finish the work
No pity for the enlightened
Ashes scattered the plague, it will finish the work
You're doomed your soul and flesh

Can you remember you said, "Your God is just a fake!"
But throughout this time you've been convinced in the opposite
Slaves in locked cages â is the only thing that matters
You will be saved â your only need is to free our sons
But theÑ'll not forget, no one will forget â your cursed lands
The choice you've made was a terrible mistake
Beware!

[Chorus:]
Take my disfigured hand, it will guide you right to the place
Where the sun shines so bright that your eyes can't see the true god!

Look at yourself, you are like a pathetic rats
Your fallen gods have never been so scared
So let this wounds kill your flesh
And fear will poison all your souls

-"Ominous fate will protect us from this adversity!
And give us strength to fight it back"
-"She doesn't hear you..stop looking up to the stars
Truthfulness of words will be proved by scars"
-"Oh, disgraceful life! What kind of shepherd will guide us?
And who will give us a new life?"
