You're not a woeful martyrs
You're not an exhausted warders
And at none of days
You were not so weak.

Contagious, like a plague.
Go bury yourself as deep as you can
Your wisemen were never felt so bad
Storm of fear will devour the seed of that sacred land
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!
Your gods are speechless.

Open your eyes! Open your eyes!
Your gods are speechless.

The Ruler is steeped in his sins
But, what can we say?
God's wrath is fueled by lies
His patience is overwhelmed
The Ruler is steeped in his sins
How much is he willing to pay?
He's just a man.

Your venomous words
Will crumble when you break the line
Your sacred patrons are not prepared for it

Blood doesn't spill from your veins
So why do you feel this pain?
We grab your life, pierce it with knife
But you fight â and we'll end this strife
Just look around and you would
Be able to regret

We'll erase you into ash
Therefore our sons will tear these chains
The storm will bring you death
Begin to dig the graves!
