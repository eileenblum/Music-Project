You'll suffer, his heart hardened once again.
We'll compel you to weep and obey!
The separation! Remember the darkness of this day
The acceptance of power that came.

Damn you all! We hear your cries,
For your cursed fate! Because it's dying.
The destiny â it gives you just nothing
You've lost your last chance...

The intrinsic thread of the fate leads to the gates
Abandoned city is on the remains
Now you forget, all preconceptions won't protect
There was just a shout "When will you finally stop"?

The arrows become alive in Heaven,
Lurking in your house, bypassing the closed doors and
Demonstrating you the power of the holy rage
(Holy rage!)
They'll listen to my will"

[Chorus:]
Remember the difference between us (forever)
The payment for your sins!
Differences between us. Remember them forever
Seek a new sense to breathe!

"I am â the true potentate of this nation
Do you think, the sun gives you all of this power?
No! It left you to die all alone
But you still adjure it for the protection
Naive fools!"

You'll suffer, his heart hardened once again.
We'll compel you to weep and obey!
The separation! Remember the darkness of this day
The acceptance of power that came.

Pluck it from your chest.

[Chorus:]
Remember the difference between us (forever)
The payment for your sins!
Differences between us. Remember them forever
Seek a new sense to breathe!
