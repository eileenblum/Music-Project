The sun will light your whole domain
And bring hope in your heart
You start to feel how pain goes away
But you forget that your gods are fake
Sky turns black and trampled their greatness

We'll stand on our truth â 'til you will not be on your knees
Remember that even on deathbed
The Hand of Mercy won't feed your lands!
Pray! Because all your sons are damned, like slaves!
'Cause all your sons are damned.

Darkness embrace you â you're trying to encourage
The Sun which gave you power to pretend you're alive
And bring hope in your heart! And makes you feel so secure!
But you're mirrored in lies! Deny our God!
The darkness conceal all your sinful lives!

Now You're an infection that soaked this cursed lands
Creator will gladly help to cleanse your defilement
Freedom is gonna be another illusion
Your Ruler scared â he saw the anger in His eyes

Small chance to save your people start to melt
Arise and pull the chains off from your neck
We'll level them and proudly pass on their lands

Your sun disappeared! Your idols will cry cowardly
And our blood will never be your prey
Deceit! You're bunch of Rascals
Fall in His name â dirty blood out of your veins
And when you fall asleep, we have stabbed the knife into your back

For everything you have done to our sons!
Our Saviour leads us to new livehood
And we'll find you in this endless night!
Life will never be just nice!

Trying to forgive â but we get only suffering
Living in His name â and we'll deprive the roots of your heritage

For supreme atoning vengeance!
Heart of your Ruler was hardened again
Remember all the harm, what you have done for years
You are surrounded! No save from His will!
