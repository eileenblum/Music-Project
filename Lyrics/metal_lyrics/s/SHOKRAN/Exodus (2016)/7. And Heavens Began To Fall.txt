[feat. Lauren Babic]You only consist of shame, you'll scream to your gods
You only consist of shame and blossom will surely die
You only consist of shame, you'll scream to your gods
You only consist of shame and you know it, it's your curse!

Heavens are falling on your heads
With rage of distant stars!
You'll feel his eminence like motion of voices annihilating the night!
And there's no solace in the world for you to cry
'Cause your world will die today, so step aside
All your lies will come back with imperious movement of His hand

Please, don't scream like you don't feel that this will end
And believe we will give you all pain from our sons

"Listen, I am ordered to say â falling deeper and deeper is direction of your way
Are you listening? Obey and get a life
'Cause I'm here and I'm your truly lord"

Follow your grave and then you're going to set yourself free â you're ready
Follow your grave, you spill the blood and tears, just go...

"We'll give you all you need to prove your rights
It's the moment of truth when we can't go to the light
We fell onto this sand, we will atone
We are powerless and we'll raise our arms to you!"
