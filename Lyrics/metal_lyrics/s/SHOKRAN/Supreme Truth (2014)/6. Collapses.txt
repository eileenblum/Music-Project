Drowning in ignorance of my thoughts
Approaching closer to the bottom
To the bottom of this gray world
To the bottom of this fallen world
I can see the light in the distance
The light that I needed
But I couldn't reach up to it
I wallowed in the mud
In the false and cruelty of mankind

All irreversible collapses
No hopes for a clean kind world
All decays
Decays from the inside
Look what we have done to our world

I'm drowning in oblivion of my thoughts
I'm already at the bottom
And the light shines dimly in the distance
The sea was filled with tears of children
River is full of people's blood
I'm already at the bottom
Sky is covered with dark clouds

All irreversible collapses
No hopes for a clean kind world
All decays
Decays from the inside
Look what we have done to our world

Drowning in ignorance of my thoughts
Approaching closer to the bottom
To the bottom of this gray world
To the bottom of this fallen world
I can see the light in the distance
The light that I needed
But I couldn't reach up to it
I wallowed in the mud
In the false and cruelty of mankind
All irreversible collapses
