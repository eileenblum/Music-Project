All your life being on a surface
You propelled the others.
You were too weak to refuse.
You left your daughter and sucked up to the top-brass.
You were breaking your spine ignoring the wish to breath.
You dreamed to be the greatest actor
But the only role you have
Is to be the shit rotting from the inside.
Get on your knees, Get your head up
Squeeze desires into the fist
Let them be the burden
With which you can destroy walls and barriers
Go straight ahead, follow your dream
follow your Soul
Break the jaws of those who dares to argue back with you
Crush the bones and break the joints of those who tried to stop you.
Itâs not scary to be mistaken
Itâs not fatal to lose
There is something more aggravative than the lie and even theft,
Something more wretched than killing and the death.
Indifference
