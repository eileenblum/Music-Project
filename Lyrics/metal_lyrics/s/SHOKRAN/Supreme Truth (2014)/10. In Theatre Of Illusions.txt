In theatre of Illusions
no faces are seen
and you are dreaming
as if you have never been born
(Never been born)

In theatre of Illusions
heat lightning stories
streaming
with fleshless shadows
sparking in darkness
horsing around

like sleeping people
iurd are flying
(Bird are flying)
upon the top of the World
the melody of oncoming Fates
Is bleeding

my inner vampire
awakened
by the bloody dawning

leeching
with soul
in Hope
maybe
all of this
is not vainly

In theatre of Illusions
heat lightning stories
streaming
with fleshless shadows
sparking in darkness
horsing around
like sleeping people
Bird are flying
upon the top of the World
the melody of oncoming Fates
Is bleeding
leeching with soul in Hope
Maybe
