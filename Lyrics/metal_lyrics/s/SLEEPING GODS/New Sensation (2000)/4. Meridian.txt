I feel like
I haven't a god in my life
But I am crying tears for
What thousand men did before
And their souls longed for mercy

Like a thousand dreams in one night
It wants me going insane
When the past came to hold me tight
And my soul longs for mercy

Hear my words I want to hall up high
Whispered out with the last breath
Remember me as a brave
And my soul feels your mercy
