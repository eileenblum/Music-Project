Now I scream my dream out
And my dream has always been you
longing for my sweetheart passion
the sweetest passion existing for me
My vampires' dream is an ocean of blood

And in my deepest desire
It lives the unite with your soul
It is my favourite daydream
Favorite daydream which comes true
My vampires' dream is an ocean of blood

I have walked through valleys and mountains
I've lived with people in all the centuries
I have seen the world through different eyes
But there is only one thing that remains
