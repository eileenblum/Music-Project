And a rat-racing begins
Turn a deaf ear to what I sing
Dated out of what I live
I'm not getting but I give
Where the flavour is

At night you hear me scream
Hear me laugh
in your sweet dream
Death as target, life as way
Hate as duty, love not to betray

I'm your madness see me grow
Guiding your blood, let it flow
What I feel and what I see
It is the pain of your reality
