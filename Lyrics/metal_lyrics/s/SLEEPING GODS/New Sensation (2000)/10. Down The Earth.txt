Down, your words they tear me down
Your negative thoughts are killing

Down, your words they tear me down
The mind is limited, heart stands still

The face it looks like a stone
Down, your words they tear me down

Your red blood in vain
Lie low the same

High and mighty the last word
High hand fallen down the earth
