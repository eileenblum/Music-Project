We are the reincarnation of innocence
We are the return of perseverance
We are the rebirth of the rising sun
Back in the time when all has begun
You and me as one

We are the angels, are the devils
live in heaven and hell

We are the angels, die little sorrow, leave our heart
We are the angels, die little sorrow, leave our soul
We are the angels, die little sorrow, leave our heart
We are the devils, we live in heaven and we live in hell

Recognize the brightest star in the nightfall
Find us again in the oldest of all murals
Read about us in the first story
Feel the miracle what is meant by being free
You and me as one

We are the angels, are the devils
live in heaven and hell
