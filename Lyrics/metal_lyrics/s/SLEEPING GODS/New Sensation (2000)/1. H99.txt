Now it's the time when mankind is dying out
If you believe in the words of the pessimists
I'll be high, I'll be down, I am full of pride
No fear, no doubts, just let it flow

Resurrection, the words' incarnation
...

It's the last year of the tides, 1999
Just enjoy the free fall to the end of time
I'll be high, I'll be down, I am full of pride
No fear, no doubts, just let it flow
...
I hope that we soon are in the 21th century
99 is not responsible for your destiny
I'll be high, I'll be down, I am full of pride
No fear, no doubts, just let it flow
...
Say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye, my friend
To your life, to the future and to your land
I'll be high, I'll be down, I am full of pride
No fear, no doubts, just let it flow
