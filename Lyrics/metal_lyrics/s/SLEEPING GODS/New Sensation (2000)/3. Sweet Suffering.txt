I am living here beyond the ground
In this dark, in this cold and lonelyness
I myself chose to lay me down here
It differs not from life with dead minds above

I enjoy my fate in sweet suffering
I long for the gods' gathering

No change when I make my presence felt
I am just taken by naivety and hope
I my self chose to lay me down here
It differs not from life with dead minds above

I enjoy my fate in sweet suffering
I am dreaming of something like... this
...No...

I don't believe you anymore
That we dream the same dream
I my self chose to lay me down here
It differs not from life with dead minds above

I enjoy my fate in sweet suffering
I long for the gods' gathering
