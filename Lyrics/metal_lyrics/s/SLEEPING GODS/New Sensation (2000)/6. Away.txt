Away
it takes him far away to a distant place
Away

A night on the tiles in the land of Nod
Take leave of your sences but gather up the threads
Are you in a fog or in the cold light of day
Feeling as right as rain
Our hearts bleed for him
Cheek by jowl with you
No one call a spade
It runs it's course with him
Do not run out of steam
You take our breath away
Take our breath away
The tail wags the dog
Do not swim against the tide
Gather up the treads
The sky's is not the limit
