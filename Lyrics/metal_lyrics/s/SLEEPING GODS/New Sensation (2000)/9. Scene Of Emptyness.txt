This scene of emptiness belongs to me
Keeps my mind deprived of sense
Anonymous thoughts torment my soul
With pain of desperation

Writhe with pain in fetter of condamnation
Fragments of past got cold shadows
Anguish of isolation breaks me
Lost strenghts can't fight against

Dive into the sees of illusion
Glisten in light of forgotten souls
Melancholy escape on a path leading
Into passionate waves of madness
