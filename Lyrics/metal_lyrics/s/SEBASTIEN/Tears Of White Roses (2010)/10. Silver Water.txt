Once upon comedy show - flattering drapers
Livin' your story so far day by day
You're like a medium ... link in the papers
Spiritous healing - the end of the play

You're like a silver and shine on the ocean
One drop of water can build mighty sea
Tower of light made of tears an' emotion
The day you die you can't for-a-see

When the echoes are fadin' ... devil knows of your tradin'
Cannot hold it much longer ... and who am I ... a whisper in your ear

Once upon tragedy show - darkening hollow
You know the actor in scatterin' roles
So many meanings but whitch way to follow
Life has no eye - it's only empty hole

When the echoes are fadin' ... devil knows of your tradin'
Cannot hold it much longer ... and who am I ... a whisper in your ear
Take a step closer to your heart ... you and I ... scary faces
Gettin' better an' stronger ... many times ... angry when you lie

Militia est vita hominis super terram
Contra vim mortis non est medicamen in hortis

Feelin' unknown fire
Dawn brings a wake-up call
Streamin' love for hire
Life is the paintin' ball

Lead me, my desire
Hold me an' make it hard
I know every liar
Tearin' me apart ...

When the echoes are fadin' ... devil knows of your tradin'
Cannot hold it much longer ... and who am I ... a whisper in your ear
Take a step closer to your heart ... you and I ... scary faces
Gettin' better an' stronger ... many times ... angry when you lie
