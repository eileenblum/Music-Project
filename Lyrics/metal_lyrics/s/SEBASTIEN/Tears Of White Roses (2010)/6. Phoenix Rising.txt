Face of a demon an' wings of a dreamer
Purple shining' lights of hell
I wanna touch you but you make me shiver
I'm a victim of your spell

Up to horizon get higher and faster
Drummin' thunder ... let it flow
Bring me your lightning and storm for a master

When the midnight running slow

Take a lead ... if you need ... a shelter
For depress ... could you press ... an enter

Like a rainbow Phoenix rising
From the ashes everyday
Beating wings are never lazy
On your overflying way

Out from the ashes of slowburning bridges
Bearing message for a men
The suns are wakin' like inhuman creatures
And you're leading alien

When your fear ... now it's near ... you dream on
Nice to meet ... on the street ... a demon

Like a rainbow Phoenix rising
From the ashes everyday
Beating wings are never lazy
On your overflying way...

Like a rainbow Phoenix rising ...
