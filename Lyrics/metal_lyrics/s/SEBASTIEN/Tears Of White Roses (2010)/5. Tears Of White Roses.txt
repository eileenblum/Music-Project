My tears are pouring down
Feeling your touch on a crown

Screaming dark after dark
Night cries in wolverine bark

Howling is nearer and beast what I'm facing
Singin' me lost lullabye

On the cross ... dying in its glory passion
Lonely rose ... left in pair of embers
As wind blows ... right in gloomy horror fashion

Open the door
What I'm looking for

My tears are pouring white
My tears are pearls of the night
Time goes spinning all around
Lost words are buried to the ground

Howling is nearer and beast what I'm facing
Singin' me lost lullabye

On the cross ... dying in its glory passion
Lonely rose ... left in pair of embers
As wind blows ... right in gloomy horror fashion
Open the door
I need it more and more

On the cross ...
