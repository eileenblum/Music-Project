Stealin' your face charm and bright
Cold wind in moony an' beautiful night
Traces of cream on your skin
Eyes like the dark clouds and ultramarine

Won't you get me come along
To see me bleed

Clear as the virginal snow
History trapped in the oceans below
Your lock refuses my key
An' swans without the wings are headin' straight to me

Won't you get me come along
To see me bleed
Our lifes are way too long
And out of speed

Lake of dreams - an' you're dancing on sunbeams
Head full of light, delicious feel to stay
Lake of dreams - gleamin' moment of your coming
I'm givin' up to all your sins... blazin' away

I like the sound of your name
Rings in the water and howls in the flame
Spins of the Fortune now comes
Hot wings are dyin' ... on the thunder drums

Stars are falling ... I'm always on the run
An' it makes me cry
Stressin' me now ... in the darkest pain
As you're walkin' by

Lake of dreams - an' you're dancing on sunbeams
Head full of light, delicious feel to stay
Lake of dreams - gleamin' moment of your coming
I'm givin' up to all your sins... blazin' away

Lake of dreams ...
... blazin' away
