Why
Please tell me why
Only night comes - and there's no morning

Please tell me why
Fever light now appears
And your face bright of the sweety scars

Roses grow
More than a thousand years
Last of your days - of your dying colour

So tell me why
Where is my morning star
Stayin' true deep in Crimson Wine

Tell me why ...

Stream
Love is like water stream
Springs on me - and your crying cold and chilling

Time stands still
And you are so unreal
When comes a day you're dying really
Roses grow
Feeling your lovely smell
And you're so far - you caught in the mirror

Can you see
Eternal agony
Can you feel meanings bright and clearer

Tell me why ...
