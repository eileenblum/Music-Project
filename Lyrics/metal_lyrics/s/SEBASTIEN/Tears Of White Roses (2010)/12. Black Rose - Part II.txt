Why
So many melodies
Ravens and crows
Screaming on a wire

Oooh, my Lord
It's me who's killing you
Mistreated clowns as I'm fallin' down

Haunted room
Covered by memories
Year after year beatin' scary monster

Foolin' you
Is like a suicide
Can't stand the sound of a Devil's smile

It's been only dream ...
