Immortal shade stands on the rocks
Two golden keys slip to the locks
Takin' the time in memory line

Glittering diamonds in your hair
Beamin' and sparkling' ewerywhere
Dead bodies have no place for a medal

Time horse gallopin' black'n'doom
And I know fate is coming to your room

Open the gate before it's too late
Memory runs like a wheel on your fate
An' when I die cover my head
I'll be your Romeo, be my Juliette

I saw the fool lovin' in vain
Among the ruibs in the rain
Waiting for you calling your name

Up in the sky reaching the star
Deeper and higher on too far
Look into face of Eternal Lovers

Bells ringin' in my empty room
Bloody stains on the rosy thorns

Open the gate before it's too late
Memory runs like a wheel on your fate
An' when I die cover my head
I'll be your Romeo, be my Juliette

Open the gate...

Your kissing hurts like a steel in a jar
Lay in the ash in fatal crash
What do you feel now right in the flash
