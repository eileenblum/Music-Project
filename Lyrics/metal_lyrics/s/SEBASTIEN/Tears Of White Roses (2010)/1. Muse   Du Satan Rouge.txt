Same old dragon story of desire
Scalet statue of the King
Born again of water, blood and fire
Satan's picture on a ring

Won't you to come...out of veil...won't you to show me stormy eyes
Won't you to be...Killer God...and your look is cold as ice
Comin' out of nowhere angelic sound
And your bloody traces yet to be found

MuseÃ© du Satan Rouge

Branches of the ancient oaks are smiling
Gesture of the irony
All the thrash'n'treasure slowly piling
In your festing' harmony

Won't you to come...out of veil...won't you to show me stormy eyes
Won't you to be...Killer God...and your look is cold as ice
Comin' out of nowhere angelic sound
And your bloody traces yet to be found

MuseÃ© du Satan Rouge!

Won't you to come...
