When I'm alone in cold windy day
You can make me feel ok
You've found me moaning mean in stony wind

In a night
During the time
I can't sleep and want to find
Why I'm lonely shadow lost in line

Searching'
Praing'

Save my heart
Dying angel in my arms
Is wathing me eyes to eyes
Silent heartbeat's wakin' my deep cry

Save my heart
Carry on the broken wings
As the dark winters dance to springs

I'm out of my own
You're cryin' for my soul of stone

Another day is waking me up
From a bottom of night time to the top
Save me, please, for my mind...listen to ground chant

Searching'
Praing'

Save my heart
Dying angel in my arms
Is wathing me eyes to eyes
Silent heartbeat's wakin' my deep cry

Save my heart
Carry on the broken wings
As the dark winters dance to springs

I'm out of my own
You're cryin' for my soul of stone

I got a soul of stone

Dying angel in my arms
Is wathing me eyes to eyes
Silent heartbeat's wakin' my deep cry

Save my heart
Carry on the broken wings
As the dark winters dance to springs

I'm out of my own
You're cryin' for my soul of stone
