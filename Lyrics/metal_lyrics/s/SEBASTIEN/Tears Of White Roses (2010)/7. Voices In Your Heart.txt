I'm not a stranger if you see me
For what I feel so bad
When distant voices start to screaming
Like frenzy crying in my head

The icy fingers cold an' freezy
You know it what I mean
The shadows chasin' me so sleazy
I gotta go to where I've been

... and as the time is passing by
Brilliant mystery is raisin' high ... ready to fly ...
to sky ...

I've found you in the eyes of freedom
reachin' black'n'blue
Two letters writen here - so read 'em
Unholy growing deep in you

... and as the time is passing by
Brilliant mystery is raisin' high ... ready to fly ... to sky ...

The time is passing by
Brilliant mystery is raisin' high ... ready to fly ... to sky ...

She comes in neverending cry
Just two hearts in harmony ... every beat ... dyin' for you an' me
