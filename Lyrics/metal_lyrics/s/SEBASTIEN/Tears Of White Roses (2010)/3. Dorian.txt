Shakin' hands I'm drowing down
The candle light
In the eyes of sorrow
Where I see my tomorrow

A misty shadow in the pit
Is facing me
Like a smile of ages
I cannot turn the pages

â¦ and uprising is the nightâ¦

Run away
When your heaven is falling
Down to your hell an' no one's calling
Torch in the heartâ¦ I'll wait for the drawing
Dorian's portrait

Innocence
Is a fate of crawling
Name of a rose an' lovers unholy
Get a feel when the soul is moaning
Love kills a hate

Hound of Paradise

A thousand words are in my prayers
All for escape
From the circle of your name
Rest in peace, Dorian Gray

The sound of days and lonely nights
An angel cries
From the tree on my grave
Savin' me it's too late

â¦ no one will remember my lifeâ¦

Run away
When your heaven is falling
Down to your hell an' no one's calling
Torch in the heartâ¦ I'll wait for the drawing
Dorian's portrait

Innocence
Is a fate of crawling
Name of a rose an' lovers unholy
Get a feel when the soul is moaning
Love kills a hate

Hound of Paradise

"It is the face of my soul."
"Christ! What a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a devil."
"Each of us has heaven and hell in him".

Run away â¦
