Laying alone
And in my heart the fright
Counting the hours
Before the morning light

But it's in vain
The only friend I got is pain
My soul is hidden
In the Shadows of my name

One minute over
I feel much older now
Rescue me faster
Before the light of dawn

And blow away,
Blow out the ghost that made me stay
Blow out the dust that's hidden me
For all these years

And at night when the whispers are louder
And the silence is all but a still
Inner sirens are topping my dawning
I wish I were dreaming this awaken night

My eyes wide open
I'm on the ship of fools
I'll share the colors
Of my devoted blues

'Cause through the night
I'm an eternal black and white
Watching the silent nighttime rainbow
Passing by

And at night when the whispers are louder
And the silence is all but a still
Inner sirens are topping my dawning
I wish I were dreaming this awaken night

Dusk and denial blend in a lullaby
Taste the regrets lurking behind a sigh
So dim's the light
So cold is the morning bound to thrive
When to the stillness drowning me I resign
Throughout the night

'Cause through the night
I'm an eternal black and white
Watching the silent nighttime rainbow
Passing by

And at night when the whispers are louder
And the silence is all but a still
Inner sirens are topping my dawning
I wish I were dreaming this awaken night

And at night when the whispers are louder
And the silence is all but a still
Inner sirens are topping my dawning
I wish I were dreaming this awaken night
