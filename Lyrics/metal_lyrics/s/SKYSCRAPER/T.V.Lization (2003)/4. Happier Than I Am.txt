Feel the weight of all the years gone
They're few but we're feeling so old
And everything that we have done
Was carrying someone else's stones
In silence we dream of what our lives could be
If we could have seen no one pulling the strings
And deep in our hearts we don't care what you think
But we still live for things we don't believe

If I could begin my life again
I know some things would never change
But the time I spent to live in vain
This time I'd use it all in different ways
And all the days I spent trying to be a perfect man
I'd use it to be happier than I am

And all the days I spent trying to be a perfect man
I'd use it to be happier than I am

Feel the weight of all the years gone
They're few but we're feelings old
And everything that we have done
Was carrying someone else's stones
And deep in our hearts we don't care what you think
But we still live for things we don't believe

If I could begin my life again
I know some things would never change
But the time I spent to live in vain
This time I'd use it all in different ways
And all the days I spent trying to be a perfect man
I'd use it to be happier than I am

And all the days I spent trying to be a perfect man
I'd use it to be happier than I am
