I was just a boy like everyone
And then I wrote another stupid song
About sex, drugs and rock'n roll,
About the pain and disgrace of this world
So one day I died by overdose,
Stealing tears from everyone
I became the number one on the radios
Now anybody can sing all my songs

One more dead hero was born
Knowing the fame after bring gone
Known by the radios, known by T.V.
Ready to be just another great dead...

Great dead singer

Hey! can you hear me? it's not a simple dream
This is a sad reality where T.V. tells the people how to live
You can see it everywhere
When I was there no one did really care
Now that I'm gone they all still cry
Today I am another thing you buy

I was just a boy like everyone
And then I wrote another stupid song
I became the number one on the radios
Now anybody can sing all my songs

One more dead hero was born
Knowing the fame after bring gone
Known by the radios, known by T.V.
Ready to be just another great dead...

Great dead singer
