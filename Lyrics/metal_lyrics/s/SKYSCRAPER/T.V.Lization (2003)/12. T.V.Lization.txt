Turn on the bloody screen, the show is goin'on
Don't need to be afraid, it's always far from home
If you don't like it you can choose another one
That shows another truth, the one you like know

Turn it on, turn it off, you're the king
Forget the real life, it's just insane and boring
You'll feel like if your problems were so far
You live day by day without seeing your life passing by

Take your feet off the ground
Don't try to understand
I'm sure you feel so fine now
But you are going down

When will you realize?
That this is not your life
It's all fake
It controls your mind and makes you blind

You smile, you cry
For some character's life
You live, you die
And behind a sea of lies you hide

Wake up man you're just another puppet
Completely under control
You love, you hate, you laugh, you cry
And you keep doing
You keep doing everything you're told
Wear it, buy it, eat it, breathe and watch it
You keep watching all this empty show
It fills your gaps, now it kills your mind
And makes you live just like a stone

When will you realize?
That this is not your life
It's all fake
It controls your mind and makes you blind

You smile, you cry
For some character's life
You live, you die
And behind a sea of lies you hide

See this poor man
He's feeling so strong
He can't see his empty hands
He is so blind
He's just another stupid guy
Who's a livin' in a T.V. life

Close your blinded eyes
Sleep, turn off your mind
Feel all your problems die
Freeze while the time goes by

Can't you see? it's fantasy
But your problems still remain true
You feel good. it's your food
It's the way out of your sad life
It's not bad but you let it possess you
You're livin' in lies that you turn into real life
You're still the same, without a change
You are turning your back to real life

When will you realize?
That this is not your life
It's all fake
It controls your mind and makes you blind

You smile, you cry
For some character's life
You live, you die
And behind a sea of lies you hide
