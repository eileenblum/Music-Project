Dies Irae, Dies Ila

Best regards
Crown of broken shards
Digging sores in my mind
Cruel and so kind
Come and face our demanded fate
Our delight and sorrow
Truly borrowed

Can you see the morning,
See the warning,
See the hope?
Can you see now
What was foretold?

Run! run for the day - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Run for the light - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Millennium

Ash and haze
Come and guide my way
Now the road is leading
Deep within me
Time has come
And the doom has sprung
Come and claim our freedom
Armageddon

Can you see the morning,
See the warning,
See the hope?
Can you see now
What was foretold?

Run! run for the day - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Run for the light - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Millennium

Can you see the morning,
See the warning,
See the hope?
Can you see now
What was foretold?

Run! run for the day - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Run for the light - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Millennium

Run! run for the day - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Run for the light - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Millennium

Run! run for the day - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Run for the light - Dies Irae, Dies Ila
Millennium
