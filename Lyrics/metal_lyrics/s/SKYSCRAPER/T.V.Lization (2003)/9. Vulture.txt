Bombs and bloodshed look like gold to me
For me it's money when it's what you read
You read the news not knowing what it means
It means I'm getting rich with the world's tragedy

If an angry crowd starts to fight I don't care if this is right
This is good if it's something I'll write on my distortion of life
Not the truth, not a lie

"Earthquakes", "murder" it's music to my ears
Years of wars become years of news you'll read
Read, read, read! I'm sure you will believe
While I'm getting rich with the world's tragedy

If an angry crowd starts to fight I don't care if this is right
This is good if it's something I'll write on my distortion of life
And I'll write
If somebody's idol just died, if somebody starts to cry
I just care if it makes people buy my distortion of life
Not the truth, not a lie

It's not the truth and it's not a lie
It's the easiest way to get all of you
Bloody, dirty, you say it's cruel
But you're having fun with what I do

If an angry crowd starts to fight I don't care if this is right
This is good if it's something I'll write on my distortion of life
And I'll write
If somebody's idol just died, if somebody starts to cry
I just care if it makes people buy my distortion of life
Not the truth, not a lie
