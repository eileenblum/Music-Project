All the tickets have been sold
The special guest is three years old
"A sex abuser", that's what I was told
A young man singing' his new song
Some virgin preachers say âit's wrong!â
They say âit makes the evil get too strong!â

How long will it last
I don't have to take it anymore

Take me away from this foolish complaining
And don't make me hear these whole stories again
So many real big problems remain
While you play with law wasting your right in vain

Truth is always in disguise
When social rules are not so wise
And we keep saying we're not what we are
Forbidden thoughts, forbidden sins
This moral lie in which we're living
Another trial, another vulture wins

How long will it last
I don't have to take it anymore

Take me away from this foolish complaining
And don't make me hear these whole stories again
So many real big problems remain
While you play with law wasting your right in vain

Take me away from this foolish complaining
And don't make me hear these whole stories again
So many real big problems remain
While you play with law wasting your right in vain
