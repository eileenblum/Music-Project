Before the sun rises up and while the shadows turn to light
Before they realize another day has passed them by
And in the end of it there's just another night
Without a single change, that's how they live their lives

And trough all the sad times they keep working hard
'Cos they all still have hearts full of pride

Even in misery and sorrow
They still can find will to smile
They don't give up, they stand so strong
But happiness is so far

Far, it's so far
They're still trying to escape from the dark
Far, it's so far
But there is so much hope in their hearts
Far it's so far
I know they'll never stop fighting hard
Far, it's so far
This is all just a matter of time

Even in misery and sorrow
They still can find will to smile
They don't give up, they stand so strong
But happiness is so far

Even in misery and sorrow
They still can find will to smile
They don't give up, they stand so strong
But happiness is so far
