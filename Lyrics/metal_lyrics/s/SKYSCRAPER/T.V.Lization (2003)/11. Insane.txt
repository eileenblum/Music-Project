How can you tell me what's right,
Making lots of mistakes?
Trying to hide from the truth you say I'm insane
You're feeling so tall
Finally you have someone to blame
You say it's O.K. but there is no change

So you send us to this madhouse
But the world is still the same
You say everyone is safe now
This way things will never change
Sometimes I laugh at what you've done
There's freedom on these chains

Insane, it's insane
You build up destruction, pain and hate
And keep saying I am...
Insane, I'm insane
Leave me here to live in peace
Inside here I feel free 'cos the madness is outside

And through the sleepless nights remember all you've done
Emptiness will show you what this madman tried to say

So you send us to this madhouse
But the world is still the same
You say everyone is safe now
This way things will never change
Sometimes I laugh at what you've done
There's freedom on these chains

Insane, it's insane
You build up destruction, pain and hate
And keep saying I am...
Insane, I'm insane
Leave me here to live in peace
Inside here I feel free 'cos the madness is outside
Madness is out
Madness is out
Madness is outside
