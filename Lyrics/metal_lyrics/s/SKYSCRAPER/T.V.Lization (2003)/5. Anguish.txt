Something inside is wrong
And something is taking too long
All these years made us so strong
Can't give up, so much has been done

There is still a strange sensation
There is still so much temptation
There is a fire inside that cheats the pain
And tells to believe it was not in vain
'Cos we have gone too far
But we're feeling like in the start
There's a hole inside our hearts

It's been a long time waiting
A long time of fighting
We're gone, too far to give up
A long time trying
A long time of dreaming
We're gone, too far to give up

There is still a strange sensation
There is still so much temptation
There is a fire inside that cheats the pain
And tells to believe it was not in vain
'Cos we have gone too far
But we're feeling like in the start
There's a hole inside our hearts

It's been a long time waiting
A long time of fighting
We're gone, too far to give up
A long time trying
A long time of dreaming
We're gone, too far to give up
