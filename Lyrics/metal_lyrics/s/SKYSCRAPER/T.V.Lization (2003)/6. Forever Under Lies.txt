You try to see the morning sun but now it's gone
And a pain inside still makes you feel so cold
Tears in your eyes show you that you are not so strong
And loneliness shows feelings you don't know

All your dreams are left behind
Your fears, your sadness made them die

How can you live your life if you can't see no reason for it?
Will you live forever under lies?
Will you be killed by the time or will you try to do it right
And find a real meaning to your life?

But you still dare to say that you're felling your life
Your life is just a stupid waste of time
You run, you hide, you die but you don't even try
You have already buried yourself alive

All your dreams are left behind
Your fears, your sadness made them die

How can you live your life if you can't see no reason for it?
Will you live forever under lies?
Will you be killed by the time or will you try to do it right
And find a real meaning to your life?

Your silence still cuts you
And something inside still hurts
You're feeling remorse
For things you've never done before

All your dreams are left behind
Your fears, your sadness made them die

How can you live your life if you can't see no reason for it?
Will you live forever under lies?
Will you be killed by the time or will you try to do it right
And find a real meaning to your life?
