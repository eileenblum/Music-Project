["The Art Of War Re-Armed" bonus track]Endless waste,
Our patience runs thin.
Here we stand ready.
Let the battle begin!

Hit back! Charge!
As the forces arrive.
Shove! Go! Push!
In the foes let collide!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

Darkness falls
And the screams fade away.
Home of the fallen
And the home of the brave!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!
