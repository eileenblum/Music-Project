Fast as the wind, the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way

Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lighting phantoms swarm
200 miles at nightfall, taken within a day
Thus earning their name, earning the fame

[Chorus:]
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving our dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale the with the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way

Leaving a trail of destruction to a foreign land
(Waging war with conviction)
Massive assault made to serve the Nazi plan
(Wehrmacht's pride, ghost division)
Communication's broken, phantoms are far away
Thus earning their name, earning the fame

[Chorus]

Pushing the frontline forth with a tremendous force
(Far ahead, breaks resistance)
Making the way for panzer corps
(Shows no fear, self-subsistent)
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, claiming the fame

[Chorus]

Panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving our dead, always ahead, fed by your dread
