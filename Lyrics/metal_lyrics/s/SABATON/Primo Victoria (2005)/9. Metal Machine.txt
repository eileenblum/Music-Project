I have a phobia
A fear of the dark
Afraid to shoot strangers
The animal talks

Guns scare me shitless
But love gun's my friend
The sentinel's coming
But is this the end?

Riding on this crazy train
I'm going paranoid
Watch me lose my mind
And break the law (breaking the law, breaking the law)

I'm a metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
I'm only metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The kings of metal ride the sky

Is this st. anger
The ultimate sin
Or have I really
A black knight within?

The gates of Babylon
Are open and wide
Shout at the devil
There's nowhere to hide

Fighting for the world to keep
The wild child in it's cage
Broke my metal heart
Against the wall (against the wall)

I'm a metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm only metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
I'm a metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
Come touch my metal machine
The kings of metal ride the sky

[Solo]

Come touch my metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
Come touch metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
Iâm a metal machine
The kings of metal ride the sky

I know my metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
Come touch my metal machine
No we will never fall
We're masters of the world
Come suck my metal machine
No we will never fall
We're masters of the...
