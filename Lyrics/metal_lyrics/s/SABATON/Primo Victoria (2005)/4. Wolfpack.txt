To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and Ingham
Leading the bury west

Took the short way in
The long route back convoy 92
Bury Gleaves and Ingham leading
Tankers to the west
And upon the north Atlantic
Lies the silence of the seas
On a quietst night in the darkest hour
The kriegsmarine appear

Above the surface it seems quiet and calm
Deep down below the wolfpack lurks

[Chorus:]
To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and Ingham
Leading the bury west
In their own track came the wolfpack
Gleaves led the conwoy
Into the hornets nest

At the crack of dawn the second day
Bury stands in flames
Half the convoy sunk or disabled
Heading back to shore
But below the north Atlantic
On the bottom of the sea
On the second night in the darkest hour
The kriegsmarine return

The wolfpack surface for a second time
To make the convoy face it's fate

[Chorus]

Under fire under water
May 42 when
Bury did fail the test
To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and the Ingham
Leading them into death

569 makes the contact and lead them
U-94 scores a kill in the dark
124 sinking 4 in 2 approaches
406 suffers failure on launch [x2]

In their own track came the wolfpack
Gleaves led the conwoy
Into the hornets nest

To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and Ingham
Leading the bury west
In their own track came the wolfpack
Gleaves led the conwoy
Into the hornets nest

Under fire under water
May 42 when
Bury did fail the test
To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and the Ingham
Leading them into death

Don't know what's waiting down below
The Wolfpack lurks, awaiting you
To follow, to bleed
It's time for you to return
They decide, oh no! Oh no!
The Wolfpack's waiting for them
Too calm, you'll see
Below the surface, waits for you
