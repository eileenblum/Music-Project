Kickstart fighter launch
Throttle set to full
Speed king race to win
Afterburners roaring

Ghostlike counterstrike
Takes them by surprise

Score 307
Israelis rule the heaven

Jordan attacks Israel crush that
Futile attempt
Control Jerusalem

Drive back surprise attack
Take the western wall
Next day make them pay
Over river Jordan

Syria last in line
Head for golan heights
Strike without a warning
See the Syria forces falling

Syria attacks Israel crushed their
Lines of defence
Ruling golan heights

[Chorus:]
6 days of fire 1 day of rest
June 67 taught them respect
Control Jerusalem

3 nations fallen in 6 days of war
Traitorous neighbours
Received as deserved
Under the sun in the dust of the war
1 nation standing stronger than before

First into Egypt and
Sent them to hell
Then turned their forces to Jordan
Climb up the mountains
Where Syria awaits
Break them in hours
Protect holy land

[Chorus x2]
