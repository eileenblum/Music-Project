Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Black shadow king, find the ring.
Search for the Halfling you lords of the dark
The hobbit with Sauron's ring he is your mark
Unholy light, in the night

Black knights of Sauron
You're made of iron
Black shadows of Mordor
Wield one-eyed shields

Unholy ring wraiths with armour of steel
Kings of the past to no one you kneel
Hearts filled with hate, that's your fate.
Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Ride shadow king, find the ring.
