Born with a heart of a lion, raving to space on your own.
Into the belt of Orion, g-forces bite to the bone

Speed makes your heart burn like fire
Speed makes your heart burn with lust

Challenges taking you higher
Ride fast and do what you want

Fast as the lightning, your life is at stake
You're the one that

Speeder, Speeder
Faster and higher, exciting desire.
Speeder, Speeder
G-forces bite to the bone

Out of this world you are racing
Into an asteroid belt
Challenges of death you are facing
Strongest kick you ever felt

Faster than light, ride through the night
No way to stop this machine
Asses have turned never return
Search for the world of your dream
