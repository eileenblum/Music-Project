Crack in the distance, a flash in the sky
It's getting dark, clouds gather power
You heard it coming from over the hill
It's time to run, time to seek cover.

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are riding his chariots of storm

Breaking the silence with powerful roars
Wind gaining strength, screaming tornado
First wave is over, don't hold back your breath
It sure coming back, second attack

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
The sky is on fire the heavens are burning in flames

THUNDER
THUNDER
STRIKING
THUNDER

A cold rain is falling, a lightning strikes down
Distance is dark, horizon is frightening
Massive strong lightning's are shaking the ground
Thor is upset, out slaying giants

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are out slaying giants tonight.
