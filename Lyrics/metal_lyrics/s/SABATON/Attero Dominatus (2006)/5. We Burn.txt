I've had a vision its clear to me now
I know what has to be done
Different religions cannot share a land
A plague and I have the cure

Chase them down, let them suffer in pain
Dig them down, theyÂ´ll be gone for a while
Evidence lost

We burn
Plunder and rape
Show them no mercy, just burn
Flesh turn to ash

Inspired by deeds that were done long ago
I know what has to be done
Filth of my land must be washed clean and pure
Now let the cleansing begin

Genocide?
Who will drag me to court?
ThereÂ´s no crime if you do not get caught
I am the law. We burn

Privates, sergeants and generals hear
It's our chance we've been waiting too long
Your orders are: to start to burn
