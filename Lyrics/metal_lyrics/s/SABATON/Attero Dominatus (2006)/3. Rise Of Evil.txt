A nation in despair, weakened by war, defeated
Lost their pride in Versailles
A former prisoner, with a vision or a grand delusion
Rise to power in the reich

Rebuilding an army
Make the nation proud
Disregarding the treaty
Secret plans for "lebensraum"
Start the holocaust

The reich will rise
Propaganda, the reich will rise
To last a thousand years

Burning books to spread, anti-semite propaganda
Who will stop the madman's reign?
Night of broken glass, send the Jews to Dachau death camp
On a path to certain death

The "anschluss" completed
On the brink of war
Act brutal with no pity
Be harsh, show no remorse
Start the warmachine

In the last days of peace
Europe holding it's breath
An invasion is coming but when will it start?
Who will be first to fall? who will be last to stand?
Who will stop all this madness that has consequences no man understand?
No man, no land!
