Here I am standing, darkness all around.
Thinking of past, taken my last breath, the air is cold as ice
No one close to hear my voice
Did not leave me with a choice
Heaven will you wait for me?

Will I find a way, will I find a place
Will you let me go in peace
Will I find a way to the other side.

Sad are memories from the life I lived
Cannot go on, cannot go further
I has to end right here
For the things that I have done
All the girls I lost and won
Let me rest in peace at last

Will I find a way, will I find a place
Will you let me go in peace
Leave behind those dark days
No I ask again will you hear my cries
Then you realize why oh why
I must find a way to the other side.

Hear them whisper calling out my name
The sentences is set, the hammer has fallen
I have paid the price
Sad to realize to late death was meant to be my fate
All this pain will follow me.
