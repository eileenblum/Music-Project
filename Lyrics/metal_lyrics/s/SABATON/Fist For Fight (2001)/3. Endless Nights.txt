Clouds are gathering in the darkness. Lightning strikes the
Earth. Evil forces celebrate Luciferâs rebirth
Necromancers, sacrifices, heâll be here for sure.
Drained blood from a thousand men, and now heâs back for more.

He will rise from a world down under
Bringing fire, plague, death and thunder
Summons creatures unknown to mankind
Demons of the past

Unholy rites. Assassins from hell
Cold endless nights upon us fell
The storm strikes our land with madness and pain
Winds of the damned drives us insane

Satanâs hordes are coming closer, now itâs time to pay
Riding on the wings of death searching for their prey
Now the time has come for mankind to prove strong or fall
Fighting against unholy creatures spawned in Satanâs hall

Trapped in hellfire he was burned
Once locked up but the wind has turned
Seeking vengeance in pain and slaughter
Back on earth again

Demons marked with the five-edged star
Haunt our dreams in this endless war
Killing children and raping women
Now itâs time to die
