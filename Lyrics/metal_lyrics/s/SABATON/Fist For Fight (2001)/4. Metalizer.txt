We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are
Breaking ground
The drum pounding faster than my heart, the vocals are
screaming extreme art
The passion for metal drives us forth, the best heavy metal
comes from north
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience
screams in ecstasy

Metal, Metal
Back with the vengeance
Metal, Metal
All that I need is heavy metal
Metal
Screaming together
Metal, Metal
Metal is all that I need

While hell bends for leather we stand strong, a rocker
can party all night long
the school couldnât teach us rockâ n roll, the school
couldnât help us reach our goal
We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are
Breaking ground
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience
Screams in ecstasy
