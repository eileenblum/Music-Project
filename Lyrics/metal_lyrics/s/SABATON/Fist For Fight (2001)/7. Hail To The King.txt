Once we lived in harmony, but it seems so distance now.
Even though it wasnât long ago, were all doomed to
Plague and death. Working hard from dawn âtil dusk. but
That ainât enough for him Product of unholy love, untrue
Brother of a king.

Know that youâll fail, now hear us hail
Your brother that you killed.

Hail to the king that brought peace to us all. Rise from
Your grave, hear our call. Weâll not forget that you once
Saved our land. Killed by your own brothers hand.

Pure evil and cruelty, the true nature of your soul.
Mercy and responsibility, words that you canât understand.
Your quest for total control will only end in your own fall.
Weâ will fight for our freedom, and our right to live.

Do it your way, soon you will pay
Debts with your own blood.

Stars so bright, dance in the night
Day come soon, hide the moon
Stars so bright dance in the night
Day come soon, killing the moon

Morning breaks itâs time to march, to the castle of betrayal.
Bring your sword, wield your armour, we wonât take this anymore.
Kill the tyrant he must die, for his falseness and his crimes.
Strike him down, and slay his guards, and his ministers as well.

Done it your way, now you will pay
Debts with your own blood.

Hail to the king!
