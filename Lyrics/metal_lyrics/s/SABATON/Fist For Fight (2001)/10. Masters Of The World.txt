Weâre a small crowd left to rotten, thereâs not many hard souls left
As the pop is growing stronger, will metal fade away

Will we be broken, will we go down?

No! Weâll never fall weâre the masters of the world
Get up letâs break those chains now and party all night long
No! Weâll never fall weâre the masters of the world
Get up letâs break those chains now and party all night long

As Iâm tweaking with my radio, thereâs disco everywhere
When I turn on my big TV, is hip hop what I want to see?

Have we been broken, did we go down?
