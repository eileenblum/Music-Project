[Bonus Track]Masters of the wind
Metal warriors number one
Sleipnir met the king of kings
Where all men play on ten
It's wrath of Thor
They are men at war
The sign of the hammers, our guide

It's a metal daze
As the outlaw's ways
Return from the warlord at last

Blood of the kings defender
King of the "gods of war"

With the heart of steel
And hell on wheels
The kings of metal lead us
It's the king of kings the crown and ring
Carry on, as our kingdom come

It's a call to arms
Our battle hymns
Today is good day to die
Sons of Odin call
In Valhallaâs hall
Let the blood of enemies flow

Blood of the kings, defender
King of the gods of war

With the heart of steel
And hell on wheels
The kings of metal lead us
It's the king of kings the crown and ring
Carry on, as our kingdom come

Blood of the kings defender
King of the gods of war

With the heart of steel
And hell on wheels
The kings of metal lead us
It's the king of kings the crown and ring
Carry on, as our kingdom come
