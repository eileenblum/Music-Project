As the great war is over and lost
He's been wounded in war, he returns with awards
Into battle again far from home
From a far distant land, our Marshal command

Home
Siblings sent to their death
His wife paid the ultimate price
Still 
As the war rages on
You are our guide

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel JanouÅ¡ek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

When the war has been fought and been won
Our Marshal returns, to be thrown into jail
Facing torture and years behind bars
When he's finally back, life in ivory black

Home
Siblings sent to their death
His wife paid the ultimate price
Still 
As the war rages on
You are our guide

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel JanouÅ¡ek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel JanouÅ¡ek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel JanouÅ¡ek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride
