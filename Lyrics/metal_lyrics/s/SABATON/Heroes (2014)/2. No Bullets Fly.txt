From down below one enemyâs spotted
So hurry up, rearm and refuel
But through the bomber's damaged air frame
See wounded men scattered and burned

Look to the right and then look again
And see the enemy in the eye
No bullets fly, spared by his mercy
Escorted out, out of harmâs way

Fly, fighting fair
Itâs the code of the air
Brothers, heroes, foes

Killing machine
Thunder in the sky
B-17
Flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the Cross he deserved

He risked his life 2 times that day
To save an unknown enemy
Escort to safety, out of the killzone
A short salute, then departed

Fly, fighting fair
It's the code of the air
Brothers, heroes, foes

Killing machine
Thunder in the sky
B-17
Flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the Cross he deserved

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Fly, fighting fair
It's the code of the air
Brothers, heroes, foes

Killing machine
Thunder in the sky
B-17
Flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the Cross he deserved
