See the Reich in flames
Try to save Berlin in vain
It's a road through death and pain
On the other shore, there's the end of the war

Who could ever have believed,
Seems like nothing's been achieved
Just to walk a day, go all the way
The fronts are closing in
As the end is drawing near, 
The 12th Army interfere
Open up a route, get people out, 
It's forces spread out thin

It's the end of the war
(Hold the corridor!)
Reach for Elbe's shore!

It's the end, the war has been lost
Keeping them safe 'til the river's been crossed
Nicht ein Schlacht, ein Rettungsaktion
Holding their ground 'til the final platoon
âHurry up, we're waiting for youâ
Men of the 9th and civilians too!
Dispossesed, surrendering to the West

Who'll survive and who will die?
Up to KriegslÃ¼ck to decide
Those who made it cross withou a loss
Have reason to reflect
It is not about Berlin, it is not about the Reich
It's about the men, who fought for them, 
What peace can they expect?

See the city burn on the other side
Going down in flames as two worlds collide
Who can now look back with a sense of pride?
On the other shore, there's the end of the war...
