War is coming swiftly
The borders closing in
We're a company of soldiers
Mere 40 rifles strong

All alone
Stand alone

Ardenner ground is burning,
And Rommel is at hand
As the Blitzkrieg's pushing harder
The war is all around!

All around
Hold your ground!

Fight all 18 days of battles,
No odds are on our side
Few will fight for all until the bullets are gone

[Chorus:]
We!
We will resist and bite!
Bite hard
Cause we are all in sight
We!
We take up arms and fight!
Fight hard!
Resist and do what's right!

No matter our fighting
The numbers will still count
We're outgunned and few in numbers
We're doomed to flag of fail

We fought hard
Held our guard
But when captured by the Axis
And forced to tell the truth
We'll tell it with a smile,
We will surprise them with a laugh

We are all
We were all

We were told to hold the border
And that is what we did
Honored were our orders
In despite of our foe

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gloria fortis miles
The Wehrmacht closing in
Adversor et admorsus
The Boar against the Eagle
Gloria fortis miles
The Wehrmacht closing in
Adversor et admorsus
The Boar against the Eagle

[Chorus]
