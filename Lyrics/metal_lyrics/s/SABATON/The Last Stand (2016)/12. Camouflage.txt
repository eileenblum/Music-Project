[originally by Stan Ridgway]I was a PFC on search patrol huntin' Charlie down
It was the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' close outside

Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said, "Wait.

If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge."
I said, "Well, thanks a lot."
I told him my name and asked him his
And he said, "The boys just call me Camouflage."

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big marine

Well, we fought all night side by side, took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran

And it was near the river bank when the ambush came
And I'd thought this was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on came buzzin' through a bush
And the big marineâhe just swatted it with his hand
Just like it was a fly

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big marine

When he led me out of danger
I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ, I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine named Camouflage

When I said his name a soldier gulped
And a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said, "You may be tellin' the truth boy,
But this here is Camouflage,
And he's been right here since he passed away last night."

But before he went he said, "Semper Fi,"
And said his only wish
Was to save a young marine caught in a mirage
"So here, take his dog tag, son.
I know he'd want you to have it now."

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big marine

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
This was an awfully big marine

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
This was an awfully big marine
