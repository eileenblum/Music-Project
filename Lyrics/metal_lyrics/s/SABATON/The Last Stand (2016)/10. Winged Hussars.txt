When the winged hussars arrive

A cry for help in time of need, await relief from holy league
60 days of siege, outnumbered and weak
Sent a message to the sky, wounded soldiers left to die
Will they hold the wall or will the city fall

Dedication
Dedication
They're outnumbered 15 to one
And the battle's begun

Then the winged hussars arrive
Coming down the mountainside
Then the winged hussars arrive
Coming down they turn the tide

As the days are passing by and as the dead are piling high
No escape and no salvation
Trenches to explosive halls are buried deep beneath the walls
Plant the charges there and watch the city fear

Desperation
Desperation
It's a desperate race against the mine
And a race against time

Cannonballs are coming down from the sky
Janissaries are you ready to die?
We will seek our vengeance eye for an eye

You'll be stopped upon the steps of our gate
On this field you're only facing our hate
But back home the sultan's sealing your fate

We remember
In September
That's the night Vienna was freed
We made the enemy bleed!

Storm clouds, fire and steel
Death from above make their enemy kneel

Fighting, power and grace
Death from above it's an army of wings

We remember, in September,
When the winged hussars arrive
