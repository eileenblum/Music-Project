[Bonus Track][originally by Status Quo]Avacation in a forreign land
Uncle Sam does the best he can
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

Now you remember what the draftman said
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

You be the hero of the neiborhood
Nobody know that you left for good
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

Smilling faces as you wait to land
But once you get there no one gives a damn
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

Handgrenades flying over you head
Missiles flying over your head
If you want to survive get out of bed
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

Shots ring out in the dad of night
The sergant calls (stand up and fight)
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

YouÂ´ve got your orders better shoot on sight
Your finger on the trigger
But it dont seem right
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

Night is falling and you just cant see
Is this illusion or reality
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now
YouÂ´re in the army now
Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now

Oh, oh, youÂ´re in the army now
