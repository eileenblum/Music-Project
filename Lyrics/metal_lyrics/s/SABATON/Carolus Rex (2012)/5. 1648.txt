[Swedish version:]

Europa sÃ¶ker fred, och ingen annan stred
Generaler ifrÃ¥n norr till verket skred
Ond
De plundrar
BrÃ¥d
De vÃ¥ldtar
DÃ¶d
Se hele BÃ¶hmen stÃ¥r i brand
En stad stÃ¥r kvar

En hÃ¤r mÃ¥ste mÃ¤tta sin mun
Till strid
(Genom strid)
Den plundrar sin vÃ¤g
Ingen frid
(Ingen frid)
NÃ¤r KÃ¶nigsmarck gÃ¥r fram
Som ingen annan man
Som ingen annan kan

Brand Ã¥ mord, ty BÃ¶hmen skall falla
KÃ¶nigsmarcks lag, lÃ¥t den stiftas i Prag
DrÃ¤nkt i blod, som svenskarna slÃ¥r sig fram
GÃ¶r onda dÃ¥d
Ger ingen nÃ¥d

ErÃ¶vrat stadens borg, en masslakt utan sorg
NÃ¤r de plundrat, brÃ¤nt och skÃ¤ndat/skÃ¶vlat pÃ¥ dess torg
Ond
Till mÃ¤rgen
BrÃ¥d
Till slakten
DÃ¶d
En stÃ¥r Ã¥ vÃ¤nter Ã¶ver bron
Staden stÃ¥r kvar

PÃ¥ Karlsbron tog stridslyckan slut
FÃ¶r mÃ¤n
(FÃ¶r de mÃ¤n)
Som kÃ¤mpat sÃ¥ hÃ¥rt
Genom eld
De plundrat och gÃ¥tt fram
Som ingen annan man
Som ingen annan kan

Slaget om staden vid Vltavas strand
DÃ¤r kriget brÃ¶t ut och dÃ¤r det tog slut
I trettio Ã¥r har kriget krÃ¤vt sin rÃ¤tt
FÃ¶r de soldaten som svor eden
FÃ¶r de Ã¥tta miljoner som har mist sitt liv
Finns det ingen trÃ¶st i freden

[English version:]

While Europe speak of peace, all other battles cease
There's a man who aims for more than he can reach
Blood,
All over
Prague
On fire
Burn
All of Bohemia set ablaze
Stand on their own

The road to the city has been blocked
Denied
(They're denied)
To enter the gates
Though they tried
(Though they tried)
When Prague was called to arms
They fought them on the bridge
Their freedom was at stake

Stand and fight, the city is burning
KÃ¶nigsmarck lost, stopped him at Karluv Most.
Stained by blood, their brothers die side by side
Did what they could
Died where they stood

Their city has been besieged, all hell on Prague unleashed
As the cannons crush the walls, the city shakes
Fear
Is spreading
Hate
Increasing
Death
And pain is all that Sweden brought
Rise and strike back

The walls of the city has been breached
Reclaimed
(They're reclaimed)
On that very night
Unsustained
(Unsustained)
They did it on their own
They fought them on the bridge
Their freedom was at stake

Unconquered city on Vltavas shore
Start of the conflict and end of the war
Unconquered city on Vltavas shore
Is protected by its people
And thirty years ago the war begun
It has returned to where it started
