Death, hard to ignore
One million lost five months into the war

Pain, fell one by one
Three years remained, it had only begun

Unable to restore
A map redrawn
Unlike what came before
The future of warfare has dawned

Do, what must be done
Send off your son, life cut short by a gun

Gas, cover the fields
Gone with the wind, reveal lethal ideals

And as the end draws near
November dawn
With losses so severe
Cease-fire, their forces withdrawn

Great war enter
Front and centre
Grand endeavour
Lost forever

Great war enter
Front and centre
Grand endeavour
Lost forever

And as the end draws near
November dawn
With losses so severe
Cease-fire, their forces withdrawn

November 11th settling the score
From 15 to 20 million
Almost half of the dead civilian
A new world will dawn from empires fallen
The end of the war to end war
