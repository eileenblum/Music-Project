[For Tony (RIP)--a true testament to the pleasures of heroin]

Bleed tears down for dead and gone, explain this tragedy
Injected dose of suicide, cleanse the self of worldly being
Destination lost in life, death now has a name
A trial of mortality ends, we have ourselves to blame
Walk softly in our crossing paths through concealed destiny
Lost regard for life or law results in tragedy
Everyone dies here, arise to kill another day
Affirmation for my hatred for mortality
I long to live another age, to experience what we can not
And see beyond the years without corruption or uncertainty
We'll enter a pure realm beyond
Affirmation of my hatred, trespass against me
Conflicting pathes of judgements passed result in tragedy
Walk softly in our crossing paths through concealed destiny
Lost regard for life, I destroy all I see
Thinking universal thoughts, not those tainted by deceit
A new realm beyond the wall of life, our degeneration has no meaning
It shall come and we shall rot like those tainted by deceit
Walking bags of piss and shit will have yourselves to blame
Building dreams on nightmares, you won't trespass against me
Steaming blood and stinking souls, at least a time that all is clear
As we struggle onward through this death
Expire without meeting our true selves
The masses cling to fallacy without the courage to feeling another way
It shall come and we shall rot like those tainted by deceit
Walking bags of piss and shit will have yourselves to blame
