"The forecast calls for destruction tonight, death for tomorrow, and 
Armageddon by the weekend.  This could be the end of life as we know it"

Cold steel, surgical dissection of memories lost to plague
Lay to waste the newly spawned
Our existance here has been dead and gone
Blood drenched nihilistic slaves, iniquity guides their path
Furthest point from purity reached to death
We're free...at last!!!
Once surreal dreams came true, smothered in a slumber unknown
Caustic, blinding, bleeding, light, choke a last breath and die
Exiled to a prison wall of death, placed by the hand of fate
The madness of oppression onset, insight has now been plagued
Counter creature now exposed, beast of madness and loss
Blood drenched nihilistic slaves, iniquity guides their path
Incessant depletion of life, loss becomes our way
Negativity carries us on and shall carry our carcass away
Bleeding, dreaming, conceding to crush ourselves
Lose regard for self-worth, fear no pain or wrath
Extract yourself
For all the bleeding, dreaming, conceding to crush ourselves
Lose regard for self-worth, fear no pain or wrath
Extract yourself corruption of our vision, blinding indecision
A black interpretation of our souls
Last expression, vast introspection yeilds a dissection of my soul
Cold steel, surgical dissection of memories lost to plague
Lay to waste the newly spawned
Our existance here has been dead and gone
Furthest point from purity reached to death
We're free...at last!!!
