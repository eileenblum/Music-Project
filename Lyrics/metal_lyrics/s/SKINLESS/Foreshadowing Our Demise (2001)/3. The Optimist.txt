"Life sucks, and then you die"

Here lies our fate, a bleakly stained disgrace
A cross between two worlds of liberty and hate
Nothing is forgone, we'll never see the dawn
Accept the consequence and kill the optimist
Banished, feel the scream, end of dreams
All is lost, all is lost...
Indiscretly bludgeoning the motion of our former selves
Subtlety has been erased, anarchy's in it's place
Gods have fallen, hate is calling, witness the fall of enlightened souls
Follow that instinctual urge, satanic freedom, Hell on Earth
Supressed feeling you've had since birth
Is ripping from beneath your skin
Abomination you've held within
Awakening, to a world without restriction
Freedom, escape the land of pain
Solution, sights set on suicide, eternity lies in question
Life is nothing but a failed intention
Silencing, erasing the voice of reason
Victimize, execute the pure of soul
Ecstacy is born in the blood of revenge
Horrify the weak, a reflection of themselves
Indiscretly bludgeoning the motion of our former selves
Subtlety has been erased, anarchy's in it's place
Gods have fallen, hate is calling, witness the fall of enlightened souls
Follow that instinctual urge, satanic freedom, Hell on Earth
Supressed feeling you've had since birth
Is ripping from beneath your skin
Abomination you've held within
