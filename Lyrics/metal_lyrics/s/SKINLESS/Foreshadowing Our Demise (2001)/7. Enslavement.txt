The hand on power thrives on the backs of slaves
The minds of millions suppressed and pushed into their graves
Into their graves...
Children wander, with removed eyes led to worship and told the lies
Bred in enslavement, born in servitude we'll take anything we need of you
Mankind exists in slavery - a value placed on expectancy
No hope, suppress what you feel - give in and follow what you fear
There must be another way!!  Not a value on expectancy
No hope, suppress what you feel - give in and follow what you fear
Mankind exists in slavery - another governs reality
Dismiss your dreams as a lie - enslaved, disgraced you will die
Asleep sense fleeing, drawn towards the light that is fading
Wake up to an end of reason, blind faith guides the path you are leading
As on our sorrow bleeds on blood and fear they feed
Repent, accept fallacy, deny the truth...you're free
Constantly entertaining delusion, delusion of our freedom
A better way, another day, another dawn, another age, another slave
