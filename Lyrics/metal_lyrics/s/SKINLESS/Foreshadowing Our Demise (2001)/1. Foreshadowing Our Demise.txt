"Sit back, slip on your absorbant undergarments, and let the mayhem begin"

No disspelling through retrospection
Unresolved woe, flash burn wounds infection
Light keeps dimming as wide eyes thicken
The dust I'm breathing burns
Mortal ties are synthesized, decipher scripts obscure
Conjectured spirits ruled this world
The dust I'm breathing burns
Decay, footsteps ahead of all
Degenerate with care
It came here to claim lost souls
And blow away the damned
Reality, deceit, bleed through my eyes
Fleeting insight of what should be
A blinding light will fuck humanity...
Depravation of our breath, the circle is complete
No time to speculate, to feel, to see, or even be
Roaches flock to claim their throne
As victors of what was
This tundra's theirs to rule supreme
Ashes, ice, and dust
Light keeps dimming as wide eyes thicken
The dust I'm breathing burns
Mortal ties are synthesized, decipher scripts obscure
Conjectured spirits ruled this world
The dust I'm breathing burns
