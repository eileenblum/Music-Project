"Rivers of gore, rivers of gore...ah hahahahah!"

Driving my automobile, watch out for that moose
Ramming it head on, turn over in a ditch
Nearly fatal blast, left me paralyzed
In my hospital room I'm waiting for the family
Children left unattended, they just want to chop my up
They are both laughing as my guts are strewn across the floor
Hacky sack heart and monkey in the middle liver
Hot potato pancreas, these are games with my guts!
Kick-ball kidneys, leap-frog lungs, soccar stomachs
Tennis ball tongues, tug of war intestines
Volleyball, baseball, and shot-put with my head
Testicle golfing, they're 15 under par, sanguine sports
Tug of war, my grandchidren do adore
Tug of war intestines
