Wielding the fire of hell in my hands
I set the world ablaze
They say theyâll fight to the death
Iâm here to assure their promise is kept
Expect a fight to the death
Their promise will be kept

Wanting to destroy everything in my path
I set the world ablaze
They say theyâll fight to the death
Iâm here to assure their promise is kept
Expect a fight to the death
Their promise will be kept

Take your life away
Fighting spirits in the mist
Flamethrower, soul stealer
Only death is real
Life is just a method
Birth is just the first phase
Of fading away

They disappear like ghosts
Refused passage and destroyed on their path
Redemption denied
Wasted land
Death is a relief
The gates close

They disappear, ghosts
Spirits denied and destroyed on their path
Purgatory would be a welcome end
Refusal, everything youâve dreamed
Unrealized, die a thousand deaths

The gates close

Fool yourself no more
Expect the worst and even worse will follow
Hate filled journey to the end

Gnawing their flesh
A drill through the fucking eye
I, the flamethrower

Take your life away
Fighting spirits in the mist
Flamethrower, soul stealer
Redemption denied
Wasted land

Death is a relief
The gates close
Itâs an inherent cynicism to be respected, not condemned
Falling apart, souls stuck between, in a casket and left to rot

Confined benevolence, contorted memories
Dark souls and black hearts unite
Lead us to darkness, glory awaits
