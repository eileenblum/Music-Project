Forked tongue
Speak in every language at once
In complete defiance of trust
Prophesize disease and purity
Spectral falsehood of divinity

Ear shattering fallacies, drop to your knees
Every orifice bleeds
Displaced and obliterated cells
Eradicated from this world

Struggle to recover a semblance of direction
Nervous system sonically destroyed
A pool of ruined synapse remains

Struggling to connect
Failing to recover again

The last sound heard
A formulated lie
A traitor of reality
Whose only purpose is to speak the lies
Survival is an atrocity
We speak the final truth
Committing Serpenticide
Destroying the enemy

Control? Relinquished
Reality, destroyed
A pool of ruined synapse remains
Struggling to connect
Failing to recover again

The serpent is oneself
Speaking the lies, a traitor to all
You live, youâve failed

Betraying your kind
By remaining alive
Destroy yourself now in a glorified suicide

A scourge of your own kind
Unknowing, you work hard to survive
Nothing controls like fear, destroy your self in a ceremony suicide
