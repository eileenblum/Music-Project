Awaken from slumber
Seize the thrones of power
Leading his minions
Purity devoured
Devotion to cruelty, guided by lies
Death of divinity
Renounce all loyalty and cut all ties

Striking from the darkness, powerful, impervious
Vessels of hatred, cauldron of sin
Lead us to darkness, glory awaits
Confined benevolence,
initiate the fall of Christ

Straight from hell, from the fire
I'll crush your sinners
You will die in the night
As your faith burns
Pray to God, as you cower,
We smell your fear
You will die, tonight,
The beast smells blood

I hear your faith screaming
The weakest ones are chosen first

Striking from the darkness, powerful, impervious
Vessels of hatred, cauldron of sin
Lead us to darkness, glory awaits
Confined benevolence, initiate the fall of Christ

Straight from hell, from the fire,
I'll crush your sinners
You will die in the night,
As your faith burns
Pray to God, as you cower,
We smell your fear
You will die, tonight,
The beast smells blood
Bridges crossed and promises burnt
Throughout your holy land
Gaze upon your savior now
A prophecy failed

THE BEAST SMELLS BLOOD!

Invert the cross, invert them all
Bleed them of all power
Initiate the fall of Christ!

Straight from hell, fro the fire
I'll crush your sinners
You will die in the night,
As your faith burns
Pray to God, as you cower
We smell your fear
You will die, tonight,
The beast smells blood
