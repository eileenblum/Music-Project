No honor, no code
Fighting for survival
What was unified fails
Devolved creation
With only one goal
Survival day to day
Hostile environment
Violent conditions
Berserk, amok, insane

Hardens mankind's fate
Empathy fades away

Blood, battle
There's no allegiance
Only to oneself
Friends, family slaughtered in terror
Not retribution or revenge
Blindly killing, possessed by fear
Berserk, amok, insane
Frenzied, desperate charge, rampage killer
Empathy fades away

Hardens mankind's fate
Empathy fades away

When only the ruthless remain
All benevolent acts have been in vain
Idealistic values sacrificed
What shall come to pass

When only the ruthless remain

Struggle, fail
There's no allegiance
Act only as one
Kill them all, even your own
Theyâll turn on you for less
Blindly killing, possessed by fear
Berserk, amok, insane
Frenzied, desperate charge, rampage killer
Empathy fades away

Hardens mankind's fate
Empathy fades away

Season of violence
Subjects of destruction
Dark valley of death
Souls extracted from this earth
Purgatory ends
For another to begin
Pulled down below
By an unknown force

Tortured, beaten
Malnourishment and famine
Diseased demise
Souls extracted from this earth

Religion erased
Beliefs debased

Burning heat, sears the flesh
Boils the skin, melts the bones
Organs liquefied, then evaporated

Soul has left, to be pulled back in
To a mortal hell that will never end

Impaled by the beast and left to rot

In time, you'll wait, you'll wonder, you'll die
In Time, you'll fight, you'll fail, you'll die

When only the ruthless remain
