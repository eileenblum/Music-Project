I witness the destruction, and condone every action
Feel the skin peeling away
As I'm suffering myself
An orgy of pain
Brought on by all of man

Orgasmic ocean of blood
Your skin falls away
You carve and cleave and peel away your life

Orgasmic ocean of blood
Your skin falls away
Waves of pain smash into your life

For all the sins of living
This is your redemption
Carve your destiny in the walls of time

Orgasmic ocean of blood
Your skin falls away
You carve and cleave and peel away your life

Orgasmic ocean of blood
Your skin falls away
Waves of pain smash into your life

Flaying addiction
Sharp blades, affliction
Artful carving, human butchery

Once you start the cleaving, youâll no longer need me
Extracted to a new world of ecstasy and pain

At once youâll get the feeling as your flesh starts peeling
This is what youâve waited for your entire life

I witness the destruction, and condone every action
Feel the skin peeling away
As I'm suffering myself
An orgy of pain
Brought on by all of man

Orgasmic ocean of blood
Your skin falls away
You carve and cleave and peel away your life

Orgasmic ocean of blood
Your skin falls away
Waves of pain smash into your life

Coming to an end
To be skinless is to struggle on
Keep carving, keep flaying
Your existence in a pile on the floor
Reborn, resurrected
Skinned alive, self inflicted
Pure death is addictive
