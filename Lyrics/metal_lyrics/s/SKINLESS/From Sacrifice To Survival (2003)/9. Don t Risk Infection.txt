You can't dodge the subject, are you infected now?
Mathematics and theology don't belong in the same sentence
I'll do fucking cannonballs into repulsion while you live your life
Trying to put your feet down in the middle of the ocean
Give up, there's no control
Today is the last day you should push the wheel
Which grinds your mind to oblivion until it fits the mold
Don't risk infection, save yourself now, gather all you've learned and 
forget it all
Now I'll go and capture dead souls, extinguish their flames and fuel the 
plague
Will away those boundaries, acceptance of what's told, I'll go and capture 
dead souls
Will away those boundaries, doing what you're told, I'll go and capture dead 
souls
Don't risk infection, save yourself now, gather all you've learned, and 
forget it all
You can't dodge the subject, are you infected now?
Mathematics and theology don't belong in the same sentence
I'll do fucking cannonballs into repulsion while you live your life
Trying to put your feet down in the middle of the ocean
Give up, there's no control
Will away those boundaries, acceptance of what's told, I'll go and capture 
dead souls
Will away those boundaries, doing what you're told, I'll go and capture dead 
souls
