Find a better way to die, fashion in the end in the likeness of the start
If it could only present itself in a way we could understand
The code cannot break, we will only hate
What we can't attain is an exercise in never ending pain
If we can hate, we must feel? Deathwork begins as we sow the seeds
We'll only know one way, one fate to live out everyday
Experience is just a game for us to hate and hate again
The need for what who and when? Nothing, nothing and nothing again
Triumph. Deathwork. No Resolve. The way it must be, now and forever
The code cannot break, we will only hate
What we can't attain becomes an exercise in never ending pain
