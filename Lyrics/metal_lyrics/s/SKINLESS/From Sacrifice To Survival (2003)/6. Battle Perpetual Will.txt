Massive insurrection, idealistic mutilation
A battle like we've never seen
Far beyond chemical warfare
The battle is fought within our minds
A passion for conquest and plague
Psychological war, fought on uncharted lands
Zealots have taken control, they want to murder everyone of us
Battle perpetual will, far greater then any holy war
Through dimensions that can't be won
A battle like we've never seen
Disparity between our souls
Zealots have taken control, destroying our way of life
Calling upon unseen forces
Obeying calls from unheard voices
Dimensions are conquered one at a time
Predetermined to take control
Zealots have taken control, they want to murder everyone of us
Are you willing to die for your cause?
The decision is made for you
Battle of perpetual will, far greater then any holy war
Calling upon, unseen forces
Obeying calls from unheard voices
Disparity between our souls
Zealots have taken control, destroying our way of life
Calling upon unseen forces
Obeying calls from unheard voices
Battle of perpetual will
