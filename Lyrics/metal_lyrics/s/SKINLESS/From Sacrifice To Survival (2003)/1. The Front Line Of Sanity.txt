Now my friend
We stand at the end
We've failed to find
The way out
The falling of messiahs and raising of funds
Is a procession of liars
Thieves and wrongs
The new order of the land is to live in fear
Now decide
Where you stand
Look to the edges of earth
It's barren land
The falling of messiahs
And raising of funds
Is a procession of liars
Thieves and wrongs
The new order of the land is to live in fear
Now decide
An altered form is coming from the crux of the human soul
The front line of sanity is changing for the worst
We can't return, we can't advance
We're stuck in perpetual doom
A parade of horribles has come into town
Grabs you from below and pulls you straight down
Come down, inside leave it to a fool to try and hide
The frontline of sanity is changing for the worst
An altered form is coming from the crux of the human soul
The frontline of sanity is changing for the worst
It's all too real when you can't feel we're in pain
The new order of the land is to live in fear
Now my friend
We stand at the end
We've failed to find the way out
This is not a passing movement, our cultures soon to fall
Seeing, being, bleeding is believing
We have had to end our lives
The time has come to stand
What is and will forever be nothing
The front line of sanity is changing for the worst
Grabs you from below, it pulls you down
