Undo the psalms to fulfill your minds craving to bleed
Fail to serve them
Serpents of time wait to stifle the lives you breed
We'll dissolve them, solve the problem for them
Revival of the wicket
I exist between awareness and sleep
Where your life falls means nothing to me
I've come to cut your life down at the knees
And you'll fall in a heap
Wondering what has brought you here
I crossed the line
I've come to cut your life down
With just a couple of swings the rest of us will go on
I've come to solve your problem
Undo the psalms to fulfill your minds craving to bleed
Fail to serve them
Serpents of time wait to stifle the lives you breed
We'll dissolve them, solve the problem for them
Accidents happen every day, this one will leave you completely unmade
Do you believe that all is lost?
Do you believe that you will be saved?
And you will feel everything, you're eyes roll back
Demons take you by the hand
Accidents happen every day this, one will leave you completely unmade
Bring this quarrel to a new level, a place we shouldn't be but can't avoid
You'll be unmade, you should have never come
It's about corrective action for mother nature's mistake
I've heard the calling
I've seen the dead
I've listened to every evil voice in my head
I won't stop until you're dead
