Beyond control, we are falling, out of control, there's nothing left
From sacrifice, to survival
The harvest is over, yet we are not saved
All have failed, its not what we've lost it's what we've made
Seasons change as do our perceptions
This cannot be our reflection
Diplomacy has been tried, it failed
Peace is nothing but a fairy tale
Bloodshed and war
The natural state of humanity
Peace is a dream that cannot be achieved, a lie, false sense of security
Grab your rifle and put down the signs
Hide your family and head for the front line
&gt;From sacrifice, to survival
It's the unfortunate but ever persistent state of affairs
The government and media market murder for a living
The worse things get the more profitable it becomes
Every drop of blood spills equals a significant financial gain
Discover and admit defeat to realize you are nothing but a change in ways
Life beyond needs, from sacrifice
The only thing we can  hope for is survival
The only thing we can hope for, from sacrifice to survival
