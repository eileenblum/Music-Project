Only intuition of reality can express the horror of my existence.
Devoured, born again day after day delusional montage of cascading lies.
Boundaries-
In Confines of Human Flesh
Elation-
Sanctify the act of death
Exalted
Corpses falling endlessly
Seasons
Cycle and return to waste
With diminished respect cut the ties from mortal life
Transgress these bounds of slavery
Crush the weakened human mind
Your savior and his prophets' identities revealed in vain
A whole new realm of knowledge through the downward scheme of the universe
Crush, human mind limitations of the past are swept aside.
Stepping through my mortal body, skin myself to release the soul of flesh.
Becoming my own divinity, no longer wallow through this emptiness
Crush the weakened human mind limitations of the past are swept aside.
Boundaries-
In Confines of Human Flesh
Elation-
Sanctify the act of death
Exalted
Corpses falling endlessly
Seasons
Cycle and return to waste
