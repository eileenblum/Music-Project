Raaaaghhhhh!
Gather in a circle we're going to play a game
Kneel around the cookie each with a stiffy we're ready to begin
This time it's not for pleasure you'll have to stroke it faster than ever
The last one to spurt eats the scum cookie so get ready, set stroke:
Whack off,
Rub one out
Drain your balls
Play with yourself
Spank your monkey
Drain your balls
Longevity it's a disadvantage here if you don't want to ingest jizz
It's a disadvantage here
We're just a bunch of guys but only one of us will devour the spuzz
Out of five only two remain
Three have splattered the cookie with cooze
Fatigue is setting in arms tired burning pain
They continue on with rosy palms
Finally a loser is decided
Last one to shake out the monkey
He stares down at the steaming mound he must eat it in the name of honor
