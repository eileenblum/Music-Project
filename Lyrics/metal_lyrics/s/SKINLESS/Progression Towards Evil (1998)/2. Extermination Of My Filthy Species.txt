Vision of apocalyptic extermination
Pathetic squealing human beings
Forcing the caustic destruction of everything perceived
Burning Cleansing Ending Human Existence
Standing in the midst of what existed, blowing away the ashes of humanity.
Chorus of billions of voices cry out in agony
Last one standing in the blackened dawn of a new era
Masterminding the omnipotent extermination of my own filthy species
Purifying and purging the rotten loveless ore
Resurrected in indefinitive form
Vision of apocalyptic extermination
Burning Cleansing Ending Human Existence
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, standing in the mist watching it all burn
