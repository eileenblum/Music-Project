Rip, staple bite babies!!!
I tear heads off babies and lick their soft skull caps
Spineless fetus round and supple
Suffocated within my duffel
Infant decay and rot
Suck the fumes through a straw
Dismembered in the hall
Spackle baby parts to the wall
Cutlet collage created facial features faded
Innard remains thrown aside into a meat-flesh pyre
Pulverized orphans galore
Rotting though the floor
Buckets to catch the spunk in piss their head will dunk
Bobbing for heads
Lick the soft skull caps
Bobbing for heads as their dunked in piss
