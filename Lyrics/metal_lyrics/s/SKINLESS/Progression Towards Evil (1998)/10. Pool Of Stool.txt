Pool of stool
I slipped and fell into a manhole
I discovered I was knee deep in doo doo
A wave of turds swept me away floating along with the poop and pee to a 
solid waste management plant
Here I sit with the shit
Here I be with the pee
Plunge me from this ca-ca doo-doo before I drown in this pool of stool
Pool of Stool
How can anyone stand this fucking smell
Plunge me before I drown
My nostril hairs are singed from the aroma of human dump
Here I sit with the shit
Here I be with the pee
Mouthfuls of slop my tongue starts to swell in the sewer my body rashing
Treat logs
Treat logs
Treat logs
Treat logs
The current too strong
Turds
Piss and scum are spinning and making me dizzy
Swallowed by turds
Swallowed by turds
Swallowed by turds
Swallowed by turds
