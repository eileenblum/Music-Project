Angry man walks through fields steps in shit, gets pissed off
Finds the cow that made the mess, kicks the udder, milk and innards spill
Carves out the belly, gouges out the neck
Climbs inside the carcass becomes one with the cow
Look at me I'm a cow I have killed farmer Brown
Now I sit here with the cows
I have killed farmer Brown
I hit him with my hoof, blood, he falls to the ground, dead
Gore in the farmyard,
Horrid mutilation,
I made my first kill,
Horrid Mutilation,
Blood in the pasture
Horrid Mutilation
Now I shall feast
Look at me I'm a cow I have killed farmer Brown
Now I sit here with the cows
I have killed farmer Brown
Now I sit here with the cows
I have killed farmer Brown
