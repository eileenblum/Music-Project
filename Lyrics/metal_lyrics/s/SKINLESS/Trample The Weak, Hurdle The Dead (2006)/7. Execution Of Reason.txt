Process of data in unconventional forms
Strife between instinct and a reality that's flawed
Revere an embraced mass hysteria
Having the power to nullify
The perilous nature of a rational mind is a blight
Vast burial pits
Seen it all before
Where is the argument when every side is wrong
Waves upon waves
Without regard
For the public execution of reason
Waves upon waves
Without regard
For the public execution of reason
Dispel the concept of winning
There's only degrees of loss
Overindulge on denial of self
There are only degrees of loss
Martyrdom's delusion has proven nothing at all
Equality of opposite extremes has proven nothing
Process of data in unconventional means
strife between instinct and a reality that's flawed
revere and embrace mass hysteria
Having the power to nullify
The perilous nature of a rational mind is blighted
