The whole of the world is crippled by the pain of focus
Advancement driving us to obliteration
Our punishment sought through history's reprieve
Self preservation giving way to a deeper sense of responsibility
Alleviate the burden
Equalize the imbalance of man
Inherent motivation to self cleanse
And self exterminate
What is left to save?
As virus spreads the land like manifest destiny
A unilateral disgust is what binds us
As one and against all
Cost for sake of comfort
We have nowhere else to go
And rightfully so
Exhausted every resource
And conquered every woe
We are left with nothing
There is nowhere else to go
The whole of the world is crippled by the pain of focus
Advancement driving us to obliteration
Our punishment sought through history's reprieve
Self preservation giving way to a deeper sense of responsibility
Alleviate the burden
Equalize the imbalance of man
Inherent motivation to self cleanse
And self exterminate
What is left to save?
As virus spreads the land like manifest destiny
A unilateral disgust is what binds us
As one against ourselves
Disavowed we scourge the earth
Through the ground burn deep in the soil
Leave no trace behind
For the bane and enlightening of man
Disavowed we scourge the earth
Through the land tear deep at the roots
The stars will breathe a sigh of relief
We won't be coming back
