[Intro]
From this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for
the inevitable day of Man's downfall - the day when he finally turns his
weapons against his own kind. When cities lie buried under radioactive rubble,
when the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland. And that day is upon
you... now!
[quote from "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"]

Forced insurrection out of the mist of night
Seeking the fog of a dawn gone wrong
Kill without conscience or consciousness
Single file cut through the storm
Adrenaline spawns aggression
Object overlord
Fueled by cannon fodder
Object overlord
Force the human slaughter
Object overlord
Feed the meat grinder
Death quota fulfilled
Flesh boils like fever
Fear is for the weak
Shrapnel burst frenzy
Rush across the beach
Blood carried by the tide
Covers faces and clothes
There is no distinction
Between friend and foe
Turmoil begets turmoil when there are sadists in control
Turmoil begets turmoil when there are sadists in control
Triumphs in tragedy as we reach the front lines
Foundations build a twisted canvas in hostility's design
Violent altercations driven by instinct alone
the reasons are irrelevant
There are no rules here
Only objectives to fill
Object overlord
Fueled by cannon fodder
Object overlord
Force the human slaughter
Object overlord
Feed the meat grinder
Find the death quota fulfilled
