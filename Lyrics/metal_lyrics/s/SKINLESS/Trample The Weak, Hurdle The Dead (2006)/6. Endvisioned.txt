Battlescarred and weatherworn
Light absorbs and nulls the schism between lines of emptiness and form
Indifference to death
Is not a reaction but rather a cause for alarm
Distinctive wisdom
No longer plagued by desire
When abandoned trappings of flesh
Indifference to death is a reaction
To the demands of time
Endvisioned
Realms beyond barbwire enmity and ironclad scorn
Obsolete in purpose
When will is not one's own
Existence falters
In the wake of illusions
Come to pass
Endivisioned
Realms beyond barbwire enmity and ironclad scorn
Obsolete in purpose
When will is not one's own
We are not here
Yet pain is proof of being
Life is a contradiction
A less than noble cause
Even in death when one forgoes the pleasure of creating victims
One becomes a victim oneself
Renounce the fixture of the summary
Declaration against tangibility
We are not here
Yet pain is proof of being
Life is a contradiction
A less than noble cause
Witness to the death of passion
And to the clarity of thought
Endvisioned
A spectre of the end when memory
Decomposed as fast as emotion
Endvisioned
Realms beyond barbwire enmity and ironclad scorn
Obsolete in purpose
When will is not one's own
