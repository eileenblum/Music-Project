When her last tears
Burnt on my lips
She had to die
I still can see in her eyes
The fear she had to bear

Stepped out of my life
Never to see
Repressed thoughts
Will rise to the surface
Abandoned to cause pain

A lump in my throat
A last heart felt embrace
I felt her warmth
and the tears on her face

The smell of her perfume lingered in my clothes
I looked at the framed photo
of us both
