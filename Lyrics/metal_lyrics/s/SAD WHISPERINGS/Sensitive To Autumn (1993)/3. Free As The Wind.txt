Your eyes show me the landscapes
which you have passed by
The sign of your colourful life
You're spreading your wings
and you just fly away

and I stare, I stare at you
from a distance I see you fly
Hit by your beauty
Your female feather dress

Descending you come to me

Gently I whisper in your ear:
"I go with thee on thy away"
Cause you, you're as free as the wind
and all living creatures are your friends

Girl you should fly forever
So much friends but who is close
It's what I often wonder
Am I close now or never?

But why worry why this fear
We're eachothers listening ear
So honest that we can't lie
Too unknown that we can cry

No worry, no cry. Take me with you
and teach me how to fly

You're as free as the wind
