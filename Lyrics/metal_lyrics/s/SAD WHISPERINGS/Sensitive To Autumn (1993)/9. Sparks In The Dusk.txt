Waved I to mysterious me
but me did not back wave
I thought I knew
I knew I thought

Wanted to escape from the chains I attacked
I want to help me.... fear is alone
Sing oceans of wisdom
Ring waves of strength

Children now little or nothing
and knowing their.... comforts of age
and the blind of the world
seek the sight of the right

While I saw.... you were walking
Wrapped in a scarf of thought
Your eyes gleamed out at me
Throwing sparks.... in the dusk

Remember you experience with my moods
When I November am
December me not
Or show me later Novembers
but April rather me remind

Flowers and sun and children
and air me show.... and littleness
by bigness know.... then god is me
Faces of different colours, the same deep inside

Every shape, size, sex imaginable
They make sounds, high and low

Emotions that are hard to see
Without them it would not tick

A faceless personality hides in the mask of others
Old patterns comfimation, stifled again and again

Sinking ever deeper to nowhere
it drifts to the immobile confused stagnant

A sudden jar.... and suddenly awareness shines
upon it
and it stirs and thicks and climbs and soars

And searchers and grasps and deep within and I is
found

Deep where dreams lay, I whished
Heart whishes, dream dies, promise fades
I saw a mirror but blind now am I
My heart dreams, whishes now ashes be

When will my I be found
peace in a confused mind
Gleame your eyes out at me
Throwing sparks in the dusk
