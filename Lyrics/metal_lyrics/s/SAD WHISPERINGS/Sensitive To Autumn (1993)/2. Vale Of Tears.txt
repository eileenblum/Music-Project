As a lie you came to me
Soaked in insecurity
It kept us in suspence
As a relief you left

Nuanced soberness
How can I forgive
after this obscurant
I felt in mourning depths

I saw her in your arms
I saw me in a vale of tears

I saw her in your arms
I saw me in a vale of tears. How can I forgive
I felt in mourning depths

Luminous darkness
Lustful vale of tears
as a lie you came to me
as a relief you left

Redintegrate my life
avoiding profundity
allianced with my fate
Recede to hate

I saw her in your arms
I saw me in a vale of tears
