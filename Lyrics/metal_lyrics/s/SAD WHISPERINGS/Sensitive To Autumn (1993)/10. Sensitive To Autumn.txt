The wretch is wretched with autumn
When leaves fall down and rot away
The season of depression sets in
All fog and rain, men come to nothing

Jarring notes fulfil the nothingness
Act of despair, merry tones
Don't disencumber you from the melancholy
But makes men to suicidal behaviour

Tears fulfil all dreams
As a leading thread
Running to subconscious
Denude all thee sorrows!!

Narcissism becomes a blockade
It is lost labour
Serve as a servant to your constrained manners
Humble, adherence to thy obsession

Whoe upon thee!!.... Slattern appearance
Halfway season yet, wistful as I lay
Time slowly passes by
Your head is in a whirl, loose your mind!!

and come to sense cause thousand empty faces
Don't fill an empty space
Cry and abate all the tension
Prevent the wandering

Mind is stygian
Dying for spring
To leave this misery behind
is to lay down and rest
