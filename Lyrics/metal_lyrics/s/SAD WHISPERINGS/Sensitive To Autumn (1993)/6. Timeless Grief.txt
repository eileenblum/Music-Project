I pull off the hands
from the clockface
Now I can enjoy my grief forever
Grief the clockround

Clockwise squealing
I float away
Sharing deep emotions
I'm wrapped in thoughts

Timeless Grief
I float away
Timeless Grief
I'm wrapped in thoughts

Sorting out the truth
of all suggestions
put the ears to the ground
Listen to the promptings of the hearts

Time and Tide wait for no man
and they will never do
as the man with shroud and scythe said:
I shall not loose time to call you on.
