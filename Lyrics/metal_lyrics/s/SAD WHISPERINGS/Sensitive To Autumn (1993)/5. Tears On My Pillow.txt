Bathing in the tears on my pillow
Which I cry out every night
Alone with my sadness
When I turn off the light

Buoyancy by day
Tearful at night
Alone with myself
With no future in sight

I release all my woes
Which I bottled up
I can't associate with my innerself
and there is the rub

Tear from me this entire life
I'm old tired and satisfied
A whole life lies behind me
I long for my friends who already died
