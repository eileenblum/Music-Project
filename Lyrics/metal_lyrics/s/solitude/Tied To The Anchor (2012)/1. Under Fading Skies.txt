I breathe the air and taste the poison
As the smell of death surrounds me
But still there's no one to hear my calling
Am I alone not to deny this
Are we all now dressed in destruction
Left here is only one more life to...
Take!
One more life then it all will be over
Pain!
Tortured by freedom she'll have her revenge

[Chorus:]
This direction is completely unacceptable
Everything we knew is slowly dying
Can't explain why we are shutting the world down
All I know is that we are under fading skies
We're under fading skies

Time and time again
We repeat the same mistakes
Footsteps of blood that been walked before
Now escalating
All your hate inside
To the place we live our lives
There is no second chance
Take!
One more life then it all will be over
Pain!
Tortured by freedom she'll have her revenge

[Chorus:]
This direction is completely unacceptable
Everything we knew is slowly dying
Can't explain why we are shutting the world down
All I know is that we are under fading skies
We're under fading skies

Everything we knew is slowly dying

[Chorus:]
This direction is completely unacceptable
Everything we knew is slowly dying
Can't explain why we are shutting the world down
All I know is that we are under fading skies
We're under fading skies
