I'm in the game now

I'm in the game now
And I have to follow through
Is this my destiny?
Will I make it all the way?
Or drop out to be nothing
Cause after all the effort
When I lay to rest I want to tell myself
It was worth it all the while

All eyes on me
I'm in the center of attention
Where I'm not allowed
To fail their expectations

I'm in the game now
I'm in the game now

[Chorus:]
This pressure is breaking me
Taking me down
Down into the blue
I need to stay focused to not fall astray
Breaking me down

I'm in the game now

All eyes on me
I'm in the center of attention
Where I'm not allowed
To fail their expeectations

[Chorus:]
This pressure is breaking me
Taking me down
Down into the blue
I need to stay focused to not fall astray
Breaking me down

I feel the weight of the world
Laying on my shoulders

All eyes on me
I'm in the center of attention
Where I'm not allowed
To fail their expoectations
Obsessed with the chase
But afraid of the achievement
All eyes on me

[Chorus:]
This pressure is breaking me
Taking me down
Down into the blue
I need to stay focused to not fall astray
Breaking me down
(Breaking me down)
Breaking me down
(Breaking me down)

I need to stay focused to not fall astray
Breaking me down
