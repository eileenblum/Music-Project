We became our own enemy
As we sat this world on fire
Turned ourselves all upside down
To watch today drown in fucking flames

And now it seems like we can't be cased
From the affliction we just made
I wonder is there anyway out?

Anyway out

Will we make it out of here
Or watch this situation get worse
Now it has come to that final day
When it's up to no one
No one but us

[Chorus:]
The end of all, is the end of us
We got to react
While we still have a chance
If tomorrow won't come
Will you have your regrets?
Make up your mind
Before it's too late

In spite all the defiance
No none seems to fucking care
And if not now when is the time
To pretend that we cared at all

And now it seems like we can't be cased
From the affliction we just made
I wonder is there anyway out?

[Chorus:]
The end of all, is the end of us
We got to react
While we still have a chance
If tomorrow won't come
Will you have your regrets?
Make up your mind
Before it's too late

Will we make it out of here
Or watch this situation get worse
Now it has come to that final day
When it's up to no one
No one but us

[Chorus:]
The end of all, is the end of us
We got to react
While we still have a chance
If tomorrow won't come
Will you have your regrets?
Make up your mind
Before it's too late
