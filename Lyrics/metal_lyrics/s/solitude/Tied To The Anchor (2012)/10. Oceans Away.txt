I give myself away to the unknown
Scratch the surface to look beneath
Discover things I've never seen
Find the purpose to the air I breathe

We're ridin' again
On the waves of our lives
To find us a place
We'll grow with the tide
As it rises to stay

[Chorus:]
Bring it on
I need to see it with my eyes
Give it all
Find the reason to why I'm alive
Bring it on
I will aim higher and higher
Give it all
I will reach the sky

Defying my senses
To see if there is more than this
Break all the questions
Let the answers speak to me
Even if it's oceans away
I'll be embracing it one day

We're ridin' again
On the waves of our lives
To find us a place
We'll grow with the tide
As it rises to stay

[Chorus:]
Bring it on
I need to see it with my eyes
Give it all
Find the reason to why I'm alive
Bring it on
I will aim higher and higher
Give it all
I will reach the sky

Something out there
Is waiting for me
Is waiting for us

I'll cross the seven seas
To find out what it is

[Chorus:]
Bring it on
I need to see it with my eyes
Give it all
Find the reason to why I'm alive
Bring it on
I will aim higher and higher
Give it all
I will reach the...

[Chorus:]
Bring it on
I need to see it with my eyes
Give it all
Find the reason to why I'm alive
Bring it on
I will aim higher and higher
Give it all
I will reach the sky
