[Chorus:]
If we could make everything go away
Would we take our chances
Maybe it never will be the same
In this last disaster

My feelings are overloaded
This situation got me hanging on a thread
And I'm afraid I might fall

Lined up around us is the marks of the past
As the sound disappeared
All our hope faded with it

It's an unbeliueveable reality
A life in chaos
Demolished by conflict

"Something to say"

[Chorus:]
If we could make everything go away
Would we take our chances
Maybe it never will be the same
In this last disaster

Again and again
The history repeats itself
Oh it never ends
Hate breeds fucking hate

Again and again
The history repeats itself
Oh it never ends
Hate breeds fucking hate

[Chorus:]
If we could make everything go away
Would we take our chances
Maybe it never will be the same
In this last disaster

If we're the ones who can make a change
We have to take our chances
Are we a part in this tragic game
In this last disaster

[Chorus:]
If we could make everything go away
Would we take our chances
Maybe it never will be the same
In this last disaster
