My sweet injection
You're my only addiction
This is my confession
My story, my dedication
(And I dedicate these words to you)

I put my heart into your hands
Cause I know you'll keep it safe
And all I've ever done
You always embraced it
With arms wide open

And I hope you understand
What I'm trying to say
The blood, sweat and tears I've shed
You gave it a purpose!

[Chorus:]
Tonight
You are the reason we're alive
You are the reason to give it all
Inside
You make me feel invincible
You are the reason
This will live, live forever

A day like this one I will always remember
The time of my life
Together we'll write history

Whenever death puts me to sleep
They say the rest is silence
But I rather keep this beautiful noise inside of me

And I hope you understand
What I'm trying to say
The blood, sweat and tears I've shed
You gave it a purpose!

[Chorus:]
Tonight
You are the reason we're alive
You are the reason to give it all
Inside
You make me feel invincible
You are the reason
This will live, live forever

I hope you understand
What I'm trying to say

I hope you understand
What I'm trying to say
The blood, sweat and tears I've shed
You gave it a purpose!

[Chorus:]
Tonight
You are the reason we're alive
You are the reason to give it all
Inside
You make me feel invincible
You are the reason
This will live, live forever
Live forever!
