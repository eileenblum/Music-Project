This is not how we ever thought it'd be
But no one but time could have told us
What to do
And with the output in our hands
We've seen a different side of love
Like all things does begin
Everything dies

All that remains
Are broken memories
The memories we have to keep
Forever stored in our hearts

[Chorus:]
Lay down your arms and surrender
Give up the fight
(Give up the fight)
Your words will get you nowhere
This is the end
(This is the end)

There's nothing we can do
But walk away separate ways
We knew it all the way
Miles apart I'll still remember the time we shared
I hope you'll do it aswell

[Chorus:]
Lay down your arms and surrender
Give up the fight
(Give up the fight)
Your words will get you nowhere
This is the end
(This is the end)

[Chorus:]
Lay down your arms and surrender
Give up the fight
(Give up the fight)
Your words will get you nowhere
This is the end
(This is the end)

[Chorus:]
Lay down your arms and surrender
(Lay down your arms)
Give up the fight
Your words will get you nowhere
This is the end
(This is the end)
