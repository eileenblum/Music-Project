Hear my words when I spit them out
Cause I'll only say this once and for all
I'm getting closer
With every second
That goes by
Nothing can stop me now
I am unbreakable
I am...

[Chorus:]
One step away from living my dream
And I, I give it all I have
I give it all I have
Won't stop till I am there
The last division is now

So this is what it feels like
To become the legend
Push, push, run and scream it out
I will never give this up

[Chorus:]
One step away from living my dream
And I, I give it all I have
I give it all I have
Won't stop till I am there
The last division is now

But as my soul smotheres out
My sacrifice takes its toll
But I can't stop not ever, not ever

Cards are fucking drawn!

[Chorus:]
One step away from living my dream
And I, I give it all I have
I give it all I have
Won't stop till I am there
The last division is now
