Have you ever felt
The fear of knowing how it all will end?
And if you don't
Would the truth scare you enough to make you shiver?

And these thoughts they seem to stay in me
But I would never walk away
This life we load with lies, with lies
Wasting time until it dies

I used to watch my step with a second eye
Still I was blind, I was blind
Now I see the beauty around me
Let it live within

How the fuck could I be that shallow
I'm afraid it's a growing sickness
We sowed the seed and now we cry for rain

Still pretending that we feel ok
Do the things that's been done before
To avoid the unknown
Is there something more?

Would it make any difference
If there was some clearness to all doubts?
Or would it be too much for us to handle
Too much for us to know?

And these thoughts they seem to stay in me
But I would never walk away
This life we load with lies, with lies
Wasting time until it dies

I used to watch my step with a second eye
Still I was blind, I was blind
Now I see the beauty around me
Seize the moment
Let it live within

How the fuck could I be that shallow
I'm afraid it is a growing sickness
We sowed the seed and now we cry for rain

Still pretending that we feel ok
Do the things that's been done before
To avoid the unknown
Is there something more?

We are falling faster
(We are falling faster)
We are falling deeper
(We are falling deeper)

We are falling faster
We are falling deeper
(We are falling deeper)
