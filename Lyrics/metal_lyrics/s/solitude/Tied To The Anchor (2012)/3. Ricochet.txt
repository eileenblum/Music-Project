Like splinters from a shell
We're thrown in different directions
I don't want this
You don't want this
There's no return on this ride
We pray, we wish and still we're hopeless
Don't leave me, you need me

Her words came crashing into my life
With both my hands tied behind my back
I never thought this story would end alone
Please wake me up from this nightmare

[Chorus:]
Save
(Save)
Save the last parts
Of my scattered heart
Stay
(Stay)
Stay forever
You're the reason I'm breathing

It seems I'm the victim
Of a misguided ricochet
I don't want this
You don't want this
A misunderstood situation
And now we're hanging on the edge
Couldn't see it
Now I feel it

Her words came crashing into my life
With both my hands tied behind my back
I never thought this story would end alone
Please wake me up from this nightmare

[Chorus:]
Save
(Save)
Save the last parts
Of my scattered heart
Stay
(Stay)
Stay forever
You're the reason I'm breathing

The sound of truth reaches out to me
I take the blow and it leaves me breathless
And I'm begging you, begging you please

[Chorus:]
Save
(Save)
Save the last parts
Of my scattered heart
Stay
(Stay)
Stay forever
You're the reason I'm breathing

Staaaaay!
