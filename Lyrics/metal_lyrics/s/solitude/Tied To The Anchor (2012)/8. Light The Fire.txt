I won't surrender
The last piece of my inspiration
The brightest flame I had inside
They took it away

When they say run you ask how far
There's nothing left, we've seen it all

[Chorus:]
Light the fire within us
And take back what's stolen from us
Fuel the flame
Break the pattern within us
And don't let this tear us apart
We're born to roam free

Every day is another trashed and wasted one
As I'm taking one step forward
It feels like taking two steps back
Cause if we live only to follow
Then we live only to die

When they say run you ask how far
There's nothing left, we've seen it all

[Chorus:]
Light the fire within us
And take back what's stolen from us
Fuel the flame
Break the pattern within us
And don't let this tear us apart
We're born to roam free

We are running, but what is the point?
We are moving, but the world stands still

In times like these
What is the purpose
If we live only to follow
We live only to die

[Solo]

Light the fire within us
And take back what's stolen from us
Fuel the flame

[Chorus:]
Light the fire within us
And take back what's stolen from us
Fuel the flame
Break the pattern within us
And don't let this tear us apart
We're born to roam free

Light the fire
Light the fire
Light the fire
We're born to roam free
