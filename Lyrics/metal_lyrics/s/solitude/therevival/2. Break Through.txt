Now I, can see it clear
How did we end up like this?
Let us explore the other side
Turn the page and have a look back
Here is nothing for us
Nothing that matter is that
We can start all over
We can break through

[Bridge:]
We can break through!

[Chorus:]
I can see you burn inside
Don't cry!
We might fail but at least we'll try
We can break through!
Let's break this wall!

STORM!
THE GATES!
STORM!

As the darkness falls
We stumble but we won't stay down
We will break through
And this I swear

WE...
WON'T...
STAY DOWN!

[Bridge:]
We won't stay down

[Chorus]

I can see you burn inside!
We might fail but at least we'll try!

Let's break this wall

STORM!
THE GATES!
STORM!

Lets break this shit down!

[Breakdown]
