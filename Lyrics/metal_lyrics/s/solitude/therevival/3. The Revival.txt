Let us search for the truth
Maybe you'll smile once more
Counting the days as they pass
Remember our mistakes
Remember the story of our time
All these dreams you have hidden
Seek and you will find!

[Bridge:]
Let me feel!
Like the only one!

[Chorus:]
As the days passes by
Leaving all the lies behind
I will tell you the truth
In the story of our time
Future came and took away
All the pain and misery
We still remain
We grow strong

[Bridge:]
Be strong!
Make your own faith!
Move out!
Turn things your way!

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
MAKE...
YOUR...
OWN...
FAITH!

TURN...
THINGS...
YOUR...
WAY!
