I can hear the sound of lost world
That who have entered my place
How could I be so blind
To let you walk the line

[Bridge:]
We're going at the wrong direction
We can
And it will be alright

[Chorus:]
What can I say
What can I do
With my mind
The things you say
Were only for you

Since I am here
You wish you've never had been here
Don't let it be a replay
Of your lonely cries

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solos]

We try
We will find out why
Hear me!

[Bridge:]
I hope we can find!

[Chorus]

With my memories!

[Outro]
