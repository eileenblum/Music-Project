Hear my words as I spit them out
'cause I'll only say this once and for all
I'm getting closer with every second

[Bridge:]
That goes by
Nothing can stop me now
I am unbreakable
I am

[Chorus:]
One step
Away from living my dream
And I
I'll give it all I have
I'll give it all I have
Won't stop til I am there
The last division is... now!

So this is what it feels like
To become the legend
Push, push, run and scream it out
I will never give this up!

[Chorus]

But as my soul smothers out
My sacrifice takes its toll
But I can't stop not ever, not ever..

Cards are drawn!

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]

One step, one step!
