I'm In The Game Now - And I Have To Follow Through - Is This My Destiny?
Will I Make It - All The Way - Or Drop Out To Be Nothing ?
Cause After All The Effort - When I Lay To Rest
I Want To Tell Myself - It Was Worth It All The While

All Eyes On Me
I'm In The Center Of Attention - Where I'm Not Allowed 
To Fail Their Expectations

im in the game now
im in the game now

This Pressure Is Breaking Me - Taking Me Down
Down Into The Blue
I Need To Stay Focused to Not Fall Astray

im in the game now

All Eyes On Me
I'm In The Center Of Attention - Where I'm Not Allowed 
To Fail Their Expectations

This Pressure Is Breaking Me - Taking Me Down
Down Into The Blue
I Need To Stay Focused And Not Fall Astray

I Feel The Weight Of The World
Laying On My Shoulder

All Eyes On Me
I'm In The Center Of Attention - Where I'm Not Allowed 
To Fail Their Expectations
Obsessed With The Chase
But Afraid Of The Achievement
ALL EYES ON ME

This Pressure Is Breaking Me - Taking Me Down
Down Into The Blue
I Need To Stay Focused And Not Fall Astray

Breaking me down
breaking me down

I Need To Stay Focused And Not Fall Astray

Breaking me down
