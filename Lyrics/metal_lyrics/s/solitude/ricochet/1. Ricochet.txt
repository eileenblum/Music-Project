[Verse]
Like Splinters From A Shell
We're Thrown In Different Directions

I Don't Want This - You Don't Want This

Theres no return on this ride
We Pray - We Wish - And Still We're Hopeless

Don't Leave Me - You Need Me

[Bridge]
Her Words Came Crashing Into My Life
With Both My Hands Tied Behind My Back
I Never Thought This Story Would End Alone
Please Wake Me Up From This Nightmare

[Chorus]
Save
Save The Last Parts
Of My Scattered Heart
Stay
Stay Forever
You're The Reason I'm Breathing

[Verse]
It Seems - I'm The Victim
Of A - Misguided Ricochet

I Don't Want This - You Don't Want This

A Misunderstood Situation
And Now We're Hanging On The Edge

Couldn't See It - Now I Feel It

[Bridge]
Her Words Came Crashing Into My Life
With Both My Hands Tied Behind My Back
I Never Thought This Story Would End Alone
Please Wake Me Up From This Nightmare

[Chorus]
Save
Save The Last Parts
Of My Scattered Heart
Stay
Stay Forever
You're The Reason I'm Breathing 

The sound of truth reaches out to me
I take the blow and it leaves me breathless 
and im begging you begging you please

[Chorus]
Save
Save The Last Parts
Of My Scattered Heart
Stay
Stay Forever
You're The Reason I'm Breathing
