[Lyrics: Knez Svitogor]

The night is breeding deep inside my soul,
The voices whisper and swirl
When my eyelids close,
I listen to your tunes of sadness,
Howling through deep frozen forests
Like the long lost divinity...

Visions rape my dreams,
As I fall into an endless chasm
Of inhuman fear and longing,
Spectral colours in all their splendour
Take the form of luminous flame
When the fire burns out and life fades away...

Snowfall... Shadows in the fog...
Like stones in silence I observe,

I enter through the gate hiding in my shadow,
From my fate I cannot hide,
I awaken my fullmoon colored visions,
After the dismal rise of the sullen stars,
They call my name from the past,
And I feel so old...

Harken Ye!
For what I can see,
Defies words and thoughts,
Eternally I shall walk
The hall of a hundred candles

Harken Ye!
For what I can see,
Defies words and thoughts,
Eternally I shall walk
With sleeping winds...
