Golden fields of ancient times
Endless chains of mighty giants
Velvet seas now touch the skies
Slava's flame shines so bright!

In these vastlands of forgotten worlds
I pray to gods to shield my soul!

When all seems to be lost
I sense the presence from above

While the night is descending in the forests of old
Her flame will shine through the rain and the storm
Walk her way while she flies in skies of thunder and gray

Follow the Silver path
Drawn by hand from above
It will lead you to
The lands of frost and gold

Gaze upon the shine
That warms this night
It will make your way
Through these vastlands of grey

Slava carry my song
Through the forests of Oak
Show me paths I can not see
Lead me to victory!
