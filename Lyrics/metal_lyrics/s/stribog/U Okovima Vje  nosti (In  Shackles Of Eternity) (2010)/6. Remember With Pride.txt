Voice reaching from the sea of storm
Sound of the ancients
Crushing the shores of stone
Carried by the raging waves
Â 
Voices of the past
Whisper of an ancient secret
And at the grasp of the mountain side they reside
Exhalting these glorious mountains
Â 
As aeons pass by
As your blood lies dishonoured
We shall reamin as the silent reminders
Winds of Frost, Winds of Ice
Remember us with pride!
Â 
Through the vast lands of Blue
Their voices thunder;
"We are creators of worlds!"
Â 
Idols of stone watch you from the shores
Their names now lay forgotten
Tainted and destroyed...
As the ancient rage is born
The strength of winds reforged
Â 
Â
