I'm always ready for; war I've got friends but more enemies.
I was trained to kill at will so please don't fucking test me. 
I've seen people make mistakes time and time again.
Please don't think you can step on my toes and get ahead.
I've got to look out for myself, because if I don't, who the fuck will?
I made a promise to myself: if I'm crossed its kill or be killed. I'm ready for your war. Please don't take my kindness for weakness; that won't get you far. 
I'm a ticking time bomb waiting to go off and I'm ready, I'm ready for war.
