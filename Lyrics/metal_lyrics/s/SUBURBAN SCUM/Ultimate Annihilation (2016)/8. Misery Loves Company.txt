I bought those lies you  sold and weld for a heart of steel.
Hard to let anyone in because I no longer feel.
All I wanted was honesty.
There for you and you there for me.
I felt the cold from your black soul, and I know misery loves company.
I'll strip the world right from your hands and make sure you can never kill again.
Just another man who fed your disease. 
Misery loves company. 
Now you feel the pain you caused you motherfucker.
May the fire in my eyes be your sentencing, and the hate in my heart crush everything.
Look me in the eyes when you fucking die.
Welcome to your death.
