Facet to face with reality. 
Consistency's just a memory.
Trapped in the walls of my own mind.
Lead a double life, pretending I'm fine. 
Oh, it gets lonely when all you have is yourself. 
I've tried to salvage love, but nothing's all I've felt.
Forced through fire.
Oh, it gets lonely when all you have is yourself. I've tried to salvage love; 
nothings all I've felt
I'm forced through fire.
