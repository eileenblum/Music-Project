Slaves to what surrounds us. 
Screaming for a change.
The doors are all locked shut.
Try and knock them down. 
You can't escape.
Pain is all I see. The harsh reality. 
This entire life is a death sentence and death is destiny.
Death is destiny.
It's one side and it's their side.
All our mouths are tape.
A barrel down the throat.
Freedom has been raped.
Tired of all the lies.
The murder
The deceit.
Fists to take them all. 
Blood will fill the street. 
If there's one thing I've learned in life I've live, it's that freedom is a fantasy, and death is destiny.
