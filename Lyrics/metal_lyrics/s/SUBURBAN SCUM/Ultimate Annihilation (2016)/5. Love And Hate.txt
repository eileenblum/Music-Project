[feat. Justice Tripp]You brought me down for too long, but the past is the past.
I'm moving full speed ahead and never looking back.
I have the power within to burn every bridge.
Now all you have are thoughts of what could have been.
Love can turn to hate in the blink of an eye.
I hope that my name haunts you as long as you're alive. 
Cause you needed more. 
You needed more.
You needed more.
I have the power within to burn every bridge.
Now all you have are thoughts of what could have been. 
I am your God at the end of the day. 
I'll be your biggest regret you wish you didn't throw me away. 
Love can turn to hate in the blink of an eye. 
I hope that my name haunts you until the day that you fucking die.
It's a story of love and hate.
