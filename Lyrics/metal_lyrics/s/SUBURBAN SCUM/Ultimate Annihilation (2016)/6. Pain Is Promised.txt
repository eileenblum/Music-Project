[feat. Gregory Falchetto]Take a look out the window, what do you see?
I see the fear rising but not in me.
Our entire existence is based on theft.
We take and take until nothing's left.
My persistence is strong and I'll fight the fight.
Taking control of my own life.
If I don't then I'll never find solace, and if there's one thing I know, pain is fucking promised.
Pain is fucking promised. 
I'll take your life before you take mine motherfucker.
Pain is fucking promised.
