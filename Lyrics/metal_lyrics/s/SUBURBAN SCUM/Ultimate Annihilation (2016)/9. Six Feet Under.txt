Everyone you loved you have forsaken.
You look inside and you're breaking.
Sacrificed dignity for selfishness. 
Wasted life, nothing more, nothing less.
Everywhere I look, people dropping like flies.
Killing yourself is not a way to die.
Nailed yourself to the cross.
I swear I'll feel nothing for your loss.
So you run away and hide your face in shame.
For the life you sacrificed for a one way game.
Your choices will catch up, and you will suffer for living the life that you did, six feet under.
I'll feel nothing when you die. 
Another hole in your arm and another hole in the fucking ground.
I'll feel nothing, when you die.
