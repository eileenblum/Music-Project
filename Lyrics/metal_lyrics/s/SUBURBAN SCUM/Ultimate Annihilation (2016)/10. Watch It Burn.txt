[feat. Brendan Garrone]You have the choice in life to crumble or get a grip. 
I've seen some survive, but I've watched more slip.
Attempting not to rot inside of this melting pot.
I've given all that I can fucking give.
Can I live?
Looking down with the world at my feet. 
I watch the sun rot the face of the weak and hear the words they want no to speak. 
This world's cursed eternally. 
We are facing devastation around every turn. 
We can either stand up or watch it fucking burn.
The negative is my sedative cause I can't see any benefit to hold out hope for a remedy so I sit negative is my sedative cause I can't see any benefits to hold out hope for a remedy so I set back an I don't feel a thing. 
Burn we'll watch it burn.
Watch it burn!
