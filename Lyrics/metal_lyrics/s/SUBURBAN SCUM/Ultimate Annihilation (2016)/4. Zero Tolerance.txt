Fuck the lies they tell.
This is a zero tolerance.
The problem in society is that no one gives a shit. 
Every man's out for the next man and then we fucking die.
There's nothing we can do to shake it, the bodies pile. 
At the end of the rope, or so it seems.
Humans sacrificed. 
We don't mean anything. 
It's a fucking mess.
