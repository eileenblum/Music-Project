As the distance between us grows,
Love still remains.
But I can't settle for tainted love.
I built this wall and doused the flames.
I watched the world pass their judgment.
I buried the blame.
As days go on,
I grow stronger and accepted change.
I am the wall of stone.
I am the wall of stone.
Alone, I felt so alone,
So I took that feeling and built a wall of stone.
Tired of putting you before me.
I fought our demons on my own.
Sometimes my knees grow weak knowing what we'll never be.
I let the memories sink and now I'm set free.
I am the wall of stone.
I am the wall of stone.
But maybe you're not to blame.
I knew you were fucked before I asked your name.
So maybe I've earned this pain.
You're no worse than the rest,
The fucking problem was me.
I let you do this to me.
Every second we shared,
Like a shot in the vein.
Left with nothing but shame,
I put you under this wall and carved your fucking name.
Pick my heart up off the floor because I'm worth so much fucking more.
I am forever.
Dead to me.
