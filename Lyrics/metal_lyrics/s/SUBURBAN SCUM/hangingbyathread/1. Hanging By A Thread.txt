Crucified again and again for all of my sins.
I see no light, only darkness.
Can't stand the fucking state we're in.
All I want is peace for eternity.
Life is torture, so it seems.
Life prison set me free.
I'm trying to break these shackles and chains,
Every time I open my eyes all I see is agony.
The streets flood in disbelief of what we've become.
This world is a graveyard lying under the sun.
We're so fucking weak.
We're just begging for mercy, as our lives are erased.
We'll just suffer forever, then we'll be replaced.
Every man for themselves inside of this living hell.
We're so fucking weak.
We're so fucking weak.
Buried alive.
