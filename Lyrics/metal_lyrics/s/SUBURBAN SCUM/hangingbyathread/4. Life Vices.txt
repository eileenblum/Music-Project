Fear runs in all of us,
Deep through our bones.
Between these empty walls I called my home.
Every breath I take,
Every move I make,
Temptation awaits.
I hold my own,
Carry the worlds' weight.
I won't make the same mistakes.
I stand alone in a world that wants to bring me down.
I bow to no man.
These hands remain unbound.
I try and I strive,
But someones always pulling me
In the opposite direction of who I'm trying to be.
I'm tired of running away,
Running away from the pain.
I'm tired of inner demons depicting my fate.
I'll never let my life slip away.
