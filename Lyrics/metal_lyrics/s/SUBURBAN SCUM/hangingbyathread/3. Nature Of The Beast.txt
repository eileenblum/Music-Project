Everyday life gets harder to find serenity.
Evil thoughts just weigh me down.
It's all depression, my disease.
All I want to do is live without an ounce of insecurity.
Chained to my mind.
That's the nature of the beast.
I've never felt so hopeless,
At the end of my rope.
I've never felt so desperate.
Life's taken its toll.
I've spent these days wasting away.
I can't be saved.
Why can't be saved?
Trying to breathe while self-pity swallows me.
It's like every step is one closer to death and I want to believe.
Believe that there's meaning in life.
I want to rise above the feeling of feeling nothing and never having enough.
I've spent these days wasting away.
I can't be saved.
Why can't I be saved?
Losing, losing, losing all I've ever loved.
I pray for the power,
The power to rise above.
