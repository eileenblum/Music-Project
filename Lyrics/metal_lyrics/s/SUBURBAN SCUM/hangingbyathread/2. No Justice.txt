Every time I try to breathe something else strangles me.
Filled with pain to the top.
All I feel is empty.
I've got too many questions that you can't answer.
I've got no faith.
Wasting time on my knees.
I'm living in vein.
What the fuck have I done?
If all men are equal,
Why do I look above?
Too many times I've closed my eyes and prayed to die.
Life's so unforgiving, I'm wondering why.
Is it that you hear me and turn your cheek?
Do I pray to a ghost who I'll never meet?
I'm living in vein.
What the fuck have I done?
If all men are equal,
Why do I look above?
I pray and I pray.
You never answer me.
Are we just waiting to die cause there's no justice?
I've been shown no love from the Heavens above.
