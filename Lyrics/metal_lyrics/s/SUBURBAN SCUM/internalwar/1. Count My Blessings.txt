Now I know exactly how it feels
To have your whole life stripped from you
Without finding something real
My past is buried, and so am I
It's a shame things couldn't change
Lord told me to count my blessings
Well I lost count and agony remains

Who to turn to while feelings so cold
I'm breathing fire while tasting defeat
A man can only take so much
At war with the world - At war with me

Life never changes
Feels like I'm stuck on repeat
Another blade sharpened so deep within
Reminding me of what I used to be

YOU FUCKING MURDERED ME
