I've done it once again
Sunk down to my lowest depths
I try and push on, easier said than done
Black clouds surround me
Stuck in a world with no setting sun

Buried alive, I try and free my mind
Nothing will ever change
I can't learn from my past mistakes,
And I'm the only one to blame

I drag these hollow bones down these roads I know so well.
Depression is setting in on me, and not a soul in this world can help.

Is there something wrong with me?
Inner peace is all I seek, but these blind eyes can't see.

I stand alone and cold, with my heart at my feet
I pray to the lord for my soul to keep
Because I'd rather fucking die!
