I take two steps forward,
That's like ten steps back
Trying to ease this pain
A shallow path full of misery
Yet a man who is destined for change

Trying to take what I can't have
Extending arms, but I can't grab
A broken soul won't face defeat
The only thing on a shark's mind is eat
Motherfucker!

I stride and stride through your lies
But there is no glory
A revolving door of bullshit
Always the same fucking story
As I sit here spineless
With my arms so cold
I try to break the foundation,
but I can't crack the mold

So keep running from all your problems,
Then blame your bastard son when you don't know how to solve them.

You'll do anything to escape the truth,
Which is why I'd do anything to escape from you
Clear as day, even the blind can see
You took the life you never had OUT ON ME

Why was it so easy for you to get up and abandon me?
