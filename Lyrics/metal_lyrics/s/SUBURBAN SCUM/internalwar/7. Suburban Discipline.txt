An innocent man dealt a guilty hand
Watched a world close their blinds
Best friends are your closest enemies
Yeah I've learned that over time
Roaches and rats surface &amp; feed just to get by
This place you call home will push you aside
just to watch you die

I can't take it
Living in a place where few relate
And the few I've trusted
Just turned their fucking backs on me
The lies they pile up
You were a snitch, not a fucking brother
When you see me turn my back
like you always did, you motherfucker!

I can't believe
How easily I was decieved
I can't believe
That I let you get the best of me

Same shit, different day
I just watch the world turn
Played for a fucking fool
They would rather watch me burn

Over the years these wounds have only grow deeper. I gave you truth, you gave me lies, no one can trust you either. And when you question what happens when we cross paths, this is the way you need it to be, now you can feel the aftermath.

I can't believe
How easily I was decieved
I can't believe
That I let you get the best of me

YOU'LL BURN IN HELL WITH ME
