I thought that I meant something
Now I'm left with nothing
Visions pass, memories
There's a hole where my heart used to be

I burned for you
Please don't extend your hand
I cried for you
Promises never last

Distance makes the heart grow colder
Goodbye drifter, now we're over

Now your body's vacant?
You swear you can't take it?
The cancer has spread through both of us
Now all I have is hatred

How the fuck am I supposed to breathe
When you swore you'd never leave?

DRIFTER!

LOVE IS DEAD! DEAD!
