The skin is the canvas and the blood is the ink.
The mind is the artist but the heart is too weak.

Can we pick up the pieces?
They are left askew across the void.
Can we assemble the fragments?
Or are we only authors of chaos?

Somedays you were right, I felt the death creep up inside.
Somedays you were right, but it was hard to agree
Somedays you were right and I finally realized.
The last goodbye was from me.Â 

Hold me close, till we disappear.Â 
Like eternity's cold hands.
Taking me far away from here.

We could never be.
Bend the world too your desires.
I would take your placeÂ 
I'm afraid of what I can see

Take me far away.

Drowning in a sea of empty promises
two souls set adrift like lifeless carcasses
Set down a river of historic misfortune,

I say goodbye to all we've shared together
as the night shrouds me in mystery.

Hold me close, till we disappear.
Like eternity's cold hands.
Taking me far away from here.
I'm sure you'll understand, cause we could never be.
Or even more so, we could never see eternity.

Turn up the heat, the radiance of your embers.
Filter's underneath as star-crossed lovers, sharing our passion of the galaxy.
