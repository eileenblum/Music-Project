Spectre!

I think this place is haunted!
The essence... of... your being!
resides! ...within these walls!

What was that sound?
was that you my dear?
I think I heard a voice...Â 
I'm not alone in here!

This can't be real.Â 
I think there's ghosts inside!
I can feel you around me,Â 
I can feel you inside!
This can't be real.Â 
I think there's ghosts inside!
I can sense you beside me,Â 
Forever haunting me.

I know you're still here...
I'm haunted by your presence.
I know you're still here!
Your dreams ofÂ ascensionÂ have faded! (through the doorway)

(This isn't real...) [4x]

This isn't real.
The ghost inside you is alive!
I can feel you haunting me inside!

This isn't real, I can feel the night breathing down my spine...
This isn't real, I can feel the night breathing down my spine...

I know you're still here...
I'm haunted by yourÂ presence!
I know... you're still here.
The light at the end of the hallway has faded...
Has faded!
