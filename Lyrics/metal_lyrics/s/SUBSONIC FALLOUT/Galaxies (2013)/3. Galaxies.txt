Reality, an illusion
we are a mere collection
of fluctuations...
in fabric of time!
I am the stars and the earth below.
I am the product of starlight.
I am the world around you.
I am the universe and all that's beyond!

I'm void of emotion, remembering what...
I've lost... I never knew... I could
reach across the universe.

I am enticed by the shining diamonds
of the cosmos... I am drawn to the center of the stage.
This is our final dance into oblivion...
the secrets spill out, spiraling down (into the abyss)

I'm void of emotion, remembering what...
I've lost...Â I am infinite, yet I've lost who I am
(And that's when I realized... we are!)

We are one in the same.
Star-struck, but passion's dying out
have I lost myself again, the way youÂ 
pull me in? (we stretch ourselves)
across the bitter end, as these words crash upon your lips
I swear I'm not the only one...
Shivering ghost... it's just a host
to the universe...

We are one in the same,Â 
star-struck, but passion's dying out...
Have I lost myself again,
the way you pull me in?Â 

From afar.
