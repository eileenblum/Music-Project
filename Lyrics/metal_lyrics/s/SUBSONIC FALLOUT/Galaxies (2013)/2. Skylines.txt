After all we've been through,
we were not alone.
A distant memory,
forever haunting me!
After all we've been through,
you've been beside me.
A forgotten love story,
your ghost is still inside me!

...And I am lost somewhere dark,
holding on... until...

(Until you) let go of all your dreams,
give up or you'll never have a fighting chance
you must let go of your passion, and let
the darkness do what it must.

After all I've seen,
something dark awaits me.
Dragging me from the surface
into the depths of reality.
Let go of all your dreams,
chasing those clouds until the sunrise.
We'll keep pulling those strings
and singing... you to sleep.

The monsters in front of me
are singing you to sleep...
The monsters in front of me,
are singing you to sleep.
The monsters in front of me
are singing you to sleep...
The monsters in front of me,
are singing you to sleep.
