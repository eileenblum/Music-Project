TheÂ architectsÂ will have their revenge!
From the cracks likeÂ consciousÂ weeds,
they return to take down what they've conceived!

I think there's something in the air that I'm breathing!
I won't breath!
The atmosphere around me is evading my lungs!
I'll save my last breath for the end!

How am I supposed to save you?
If I can't even save you from myself...
I am lost without you... falling (falling)
inside a world of my own creation.

TheÂ architectsÂ will have their revenge!
Their faces, blurred, and darkly shrouded!
You must learn to embrace your fate,
so just close your eyes and wait!

How am I supposed to save you?
If I can't even save you from myself...
I am lost without you... falling (falling)
inside a world of my own creation.

These eyes have seen prophecy!
There faces... blurred, and darkly shrouded in prophecy!

These eyes have seen prophecy.
TheÂ architectsÂ will have their revenge!
From the cracks likeÂ consciousÂ weeds,
they return to take down what they've conceived!
