Star-crossed, eternal...
subconscious minds manifest external!
Our lives intertwined in the fabric...
inseparablyÂ entangled in the endless void!

I'll keep you in my sights,
as I search for the horizon.
Don't wander from my eyes,
things get dark when you run from the light!

Somewhere lost in translation...
quantum processes beget the rise of galaxies!
Yet when viewed through human eyes...
There is no distance greater than between you and I!

Gravity has failed us...
who could have thought the laws of nature could be cast aside?
If there was one thing I thought I could count on...
It would be our understanding of causality!

Promise me you'll sing my darling.
Sing like I heard in my dreams...
Promise me you'll sing my darling.
Sing before I fall to sleep...

I see the beacons in the sky (where have you gone my darling?)
Like waves across the sea, I wander in search of you!
I will wander to... the edge of the universe!
I will find my way to you, even if it takes a thousand years!

Promise me you'll sing my darling.
Sing like I heard in my dreams...
Promise me you'll sing my darling.
Sing before I fall to sleep...

Promise me you'll sing my darling!
Sing like I heard in my dreams.
Promise me you'll sing my darling!
Sing before I fall to sleep!

Somewhere lost in translation...
quantum processes beget the rise of galaxies!
Yet when viewed through human eyes...
There is no distance greater than between you and I!
