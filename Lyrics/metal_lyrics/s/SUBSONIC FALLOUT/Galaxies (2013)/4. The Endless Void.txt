We are the infinite, we are eternal.
We are starlight, we are the endless void.

Somewhere lost in translation
quantum processes beget the rise of galaxies.
Yet when viewed through human eyes,
there is no distance greater than between you and I.

(...between you and I, between you and I)

We are the infinite, we are eternal.
We are starlight, we are the endless void.
