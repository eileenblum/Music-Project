We are the children of the stars
We are reborn, we are the chosen
starlight shines upon us
the heavens are within our grasp

(We) we are - an expression of the universe,
and I shall become infinite.

Cities born by the blessing of starlight
(Cities beneath endless skies)

The stars...Â 
align...
behold, the stars align!
(align)

Upon a billion burning flames
(celestial, awakening)
Look to the stars, whisper my name
(Every piece of you and me, forged from cosmic star debris)

We are held together by a cosmic string...
