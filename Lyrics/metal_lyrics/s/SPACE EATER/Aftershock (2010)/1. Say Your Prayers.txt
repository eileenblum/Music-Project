Greetings, insects
We've come for you all

Through the clouds they are descending
From the smoke with roaring thunder
Enslaving all who are defending
Master race will put us under

Building structures for their glory
Unknown ending still approaches
Bloody markings of this story
Crushing us all like cockroaches

Say your prayers, say your prayers

Distant gods of stellar presence
No remorse shown whatsoever
Quick enslavement is their essence
Never freedom, break free never

Exploitation to the fullest
Free experimental subjects
Earth will sleep among the ruins
They will leave in complete silence

Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your prayers

Say your prayers - fill the cups with your blood tonight
Say your prayers - hearts are out in the bright moonlight
Say your prayers - sacrifice to the gods of yore
Say your prayers - fuel sacred fire forevermore
