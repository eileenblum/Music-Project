Horizon's  now covered with many ships
The final countdown, all the vessels move
Disembarking starts and they're expecting us
They're deadly wrong that's what were here to prove

Prevent attack, there is no use
The dynamite has got short fuse
Death awaits for us up in the gloom
Up on these shores we will meet our doom

Out of water we're stuck in the sand
The fallen comrades are the only shield
Attempt to move on through the hostile lines
Ignoring bloodshed across this battlefield

Prevent attack, there is no use
The dynamite has got short fuse
Death awaits for us up in the gloom
Up on these shores we will meet our doom

Cannons roar and bullets sting to death
Rising up now for our final run
The chances of survival are so slim
Prepare grenades and charge 'til battle's won

Prevent attack, there is no use
The dynamite has got short fuse
Death awaits for us up in the gloom
Up on these shores we will meet our doom
