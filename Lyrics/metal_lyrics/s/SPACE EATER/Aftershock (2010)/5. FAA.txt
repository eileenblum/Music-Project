Temperature is rising, incineration starts
Sound of all explosions is shaking every heart
Time is right to panic as enemies have struck
Excessive pride has brought to this and now you're out of luck

Heat reduces concrete, steel and glass to ash
As all rest unprepared for the final clash
Terror falls upon, no time left to react
All vanished before your eyes in...

Flames across America, the outcome is severe
Rabid fires ablaze the skies, no one sheds a tear

Terror breeds new terror, safety's just a dream
Extreme deeds are answered with deeds just as extreme
Fear - a brand new feeling, detriment and pain
No sanctuary to be found in hours of disdain

Conclusion of a story, ending is complete
No one's left, not a soul, none to roam the streets
Apocalyptic sunset, nights that bring no rest
Rats will rule the ruins, cinders of the past
Fate has now decided to give final test
Solution to all problems is...

The answer to oppressive times. Hatred's full release
Flames across America, giant's on its knees

Land of grief disbelief vaporize before your eyes
All the flames are to remain
In barren wastelands created by human hands

Years of hate now culminate
Not seen before, now can't ignore
Deadly force just takes its course
Time slips away, It's pouring the final grains of sand

From fire hear the callings, curses of the millions burned
Lethal result of your blindness, once that all the tables turned
Screams of your agony will haunt you and your foes are laughing hard
Sacrifice for selfish interests as you play your final card

Turning everyone against you; awesome tactic, dare I say
Soon there'll be no allies left and the entire world will look away
