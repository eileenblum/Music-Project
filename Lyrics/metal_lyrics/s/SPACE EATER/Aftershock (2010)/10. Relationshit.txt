What have you done with your life?
Junk food and soda, wasted nights
Internet junkie, TV maniac
This kind of lifestyle causes schizophrenia

Where is your god?

The future is unreserved, soon weâll know
Monitored by them, reality TV show
What have you done to put a stop to this?
I know you canât remember, never before this have you seen

What is this state of the world weâve cast upon ourselves?
Relationshit
Your mind rusts on a shelf

Milions of people are hypnotized, building in chips in their hands, blindly obeying
Bankars dictate your lives with artificial economic crisis, currencyâs a lie

What is this state of the world weâve cast upon ourselves?
Relationshit
Your mind rusts on a shelf

And while you sit in your room doing nothing they claim on your soul, they take your freedom
Idle, you never even notice your shackles, embrace your fate, youâre caught in the spider web
