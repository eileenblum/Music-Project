Send in the task force
And give them no remorse
Surprise night assault will cast away their dreams
Silence is our land. To infiltrate the land
Behind enemy lines, divided into teams

Advance from river banks
Strong moral is in our ranks
Hostile ground might be covered with many traps
The path is clear ahead
And moon is full and red
Slowly approaching while minding our every step

Mission in jeopardy
Expecting what will be
Are we all alone or surrounded by enemy

ABORT [x4]

Abort and quick retreat
To avoid full defeat
Air support is missing but there is no time to waste
Nothing to pick or choose
All hell's broken loose
Dropping one by one, now we must make haste

Mission in jeopardy
Expecting what will be
We are all alone or surrounded by enemy

ABORT [x8]

We're returning the fire and taking the blows
From out of nowhere hits being thrown
Pushed back to river, the crossing to hell
Total disorder, every man for himself

No one is left to command
We've come to our fiery end
Jungle burns, blood being spilled
Completely aborted, objectives have not been fulfilled
