Seconds, and minutes, and hours, and days
Time passes by and you can't even notice
Laying in mud with blood on your hands
Struggle for life or death in combat
Wounded companions alone in the rain
Victims of war and human fiends
Completely numb and feeling no pain
Death takes its tool in these distant hills

Crush, kill, destroy. Your instinct will tell you how to survive
Crush, kill, destroy. Slaughter will start with the fall of the night

Rifle as pet and a friend in this frenzy
No one to count on, no one to trust
Command has been given and must be obeyed
Mission objectives: triumph or bust
Enemies now are closing with haste
Six rounds to go and hundreds of targets
Will you live to fight some other day
Or leave your bones in this god forsaken land

Crush, kill, destroy. Your instinct will tell you how to survive
Crush, kill, destroy. Slaughter will start with the fall of the night

History calls us to complete our fate
Win this war or perish before it's all too late
Calling us to go, in blaze of glory die
Foul smell of napalm, flames soon will purify

Freezing, screaming, bleeding
Sighing, crying, dying
