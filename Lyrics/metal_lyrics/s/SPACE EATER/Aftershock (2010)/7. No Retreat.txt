Fields outside the mountains are squealing under force
Clashes under twilight announce the coming wars
Winged abominations send shivers down the spines
Countless are the masses that march forward in lines

Now is the time for unspoken, sinister past comes awoken

Ruins on the river are the first lines of defense
Reinforcements needed, withdrawal makes more sense
The mighty walls must stand for malevolent attack
United in dark hour they'll be fighting back to back

Now is the time for unspoken, sinister past comes awoken
This last stand must prevail 'til the end.
We are still feeling the fear of defeat. No retreat

Passing dreaded tower, gaze of red eye to bear
Narrow path will lead them straight into spider's lair
Crawling through the ashes and the weight is getting great
Spewing smoke and fire, it is closer to its fate

Writing in gross tongues unspoken
The flames on the ring still unbroken
Fast towards the mind blowing forms
Climbing quick nearing the ending complete
No retreat
