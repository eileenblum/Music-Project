We have come a long way from the start
Obstacles transcended, goals fulfilled
Future's shining bright in front of us
Step by step our path will be revealed

Relentless power to be reckoned with
There's no stopping just full speed ahead
More strength we gather with each new day
Your eyes wide open in total dread

Electric force penetrates so deep
Bang your heads and feel the quantum leap
Jump into mosh pit you'll be losing grip
It strikes so hard now feel our quantum leap

Sonic walls we build for long to stay
Our reputation precedes us well
The wrecking crew that smashes all around
Unholy sounds creating living hell

Blasting forth, like bullets penetrate
Stomp weaklings as they fall aside
You'll feel compelled to march along with us
Join us on our never-ending ride

Electric force penetrates so deep
Bang your heads and feel the quantum leap
Jump into mosh pit you'll be losing grip
It strikes so hard now feel our quantum leap

Precise incisions in your brain
Intense convulsions as your limbs will shake
We'll leave our marks on all who come
Your blood will boil and your ears will ache

Memories are planted deep within
Our fearless legions will stand as one
When voice arises to shrieking heights
New believers made and then our work is done

Electric force penetrates so deep
Bang your heads and feel the quantum leap
Jump into mosh pit you'll be losing grip
It strikes so hard now feel our quantum leap
