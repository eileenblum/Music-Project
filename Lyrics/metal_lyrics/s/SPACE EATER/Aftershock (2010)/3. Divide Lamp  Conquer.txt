Do you always feel like second best?
Never getting enough space?
We always overshadow you
Well, you should know your place

Grasping for exposure and identity where's none
Cultivate your weakened minds and propagate we're done
But guess what?

We'll rule you in fear and we'll rule you in bliss
We will rule you in war and we'll rule you in peace

Sacrifice for useless cause when rest will stay the same
And you stupid dreams of glorious past before our ancestors came

Every idea of resistance will be beaten out of you
Blasted to oblivion and there's nothing you can do
But guess what?

We'll rule you in fear and we'll rule you in bliss
We will rule you in war and we'll rule you in peace
