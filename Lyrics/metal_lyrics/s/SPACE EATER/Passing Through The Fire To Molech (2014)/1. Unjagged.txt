[MatkoviÄ]

As your fist flies to his face
Noses bleed and jaws crack
Time is stretched out, senses boost
Animals you are

If you fought for a cause
By now, in rage you're lost

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

Prove your strength, ability
Feed your primal urge of "man"
Bones can never be broken
As much as your ego can

Attack, fight back
Live lies, never apologize

[Chorus]
Get up and fight!
Come here and fight!
Show the enemy your brute form
But you're holding back tears
Haunted by fear

Celebrate your victory
Or cope with the defeat
Still you live to fight another day
Attach a meaning to your life

Pure force, no remorse
Destroy, life's a toy

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

The circle ends
Days of glory are gone
Wheelchairs, beds and feeding tubes
Bruises have taken their toll

[Repeat chorus]
