[MatkoviÄ]

Sounds of leather boots
Tell the story now
Mothers of recruits
Tonight will wear black gowns

Adrenaline now rules their minds
Rushing forward death to find
Pierced flesh, can't feel the pain
You know only seconds remain

[Chorus]
Blood is boiling inside your veins
You will die today
Thousands of soldiers rush the plains
You will die today
There are no heroes, no names remembered
You will die today
Death without purpose, the grave you enter

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

Gaze upon the dirt
This grass was fed by blood
Give life back to earth
Corpses in the mud

Battle is now left behind
Thirst for revenge makes one blind
Briefing for the aftermath
Counter strike will draw your breath

Plans are shattered, all retreat
Generals await defeat
Flee over human remains
The sickest minds are entertained

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

Spending eternity between four stone cold walls
Prisoner of war, to your gods you call

[2nd chorus]
Blood is boiling inside your veins
You will die today
Rats will feast upon your remains
You will die today
There are no heroes, no names remembered
You will die today
Death without purpose, the grave you enter

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Time is aging and isn't it strange
How the memories devour after all these years

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

Freedom is nice, but war left a scar
Dead comrades' faces tear you apart
You want your justice, you can't settle down
Wage a war against the wearer of the crown

Adrenaline now rules your mind
Rushing forward death to find
Pierced flesh, can't feel the pain
You know only seconds remain

[3rd chorus]
Blood is boiling inside your veins
You will die today
It's back to battle all over again
You will die today
There are no heroes, no names remembered
You will die today
Death without purpose, the grave you enter
Your history fucked with your head
You will die today
This time you meet your final end
You will die today
There are no heroes, no names remembered
You will die today
Death without purpose, the grave you enter

Death
