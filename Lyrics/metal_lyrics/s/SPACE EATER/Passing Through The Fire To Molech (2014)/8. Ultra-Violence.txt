[MatkoviÄ]

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Cyrus called a meeting
We will all attend
Arising suspicion
Weapons have been banned

Enemies as brothers
Together will stand
Nobody's wasting nobody
United under his command

[Chorus]
Fear us
The streets are ours
We shall
Unite as one
Now set
All differences aside
Fear us
We'll run this town
We stuff
Fear down your throat
Can't stop
The ultra-violence

Sixty thousand members
All ready to fight
Three times less policemen
Show them all our might

Bang!
One shot, Cyrus' down, pandaemonium
All scatter, killer at large
Blame us and start the hunt

[Repeat chorus]

Flee across the graveyard
The subway's just ahead
The truce has been broken
They'll collect our fucking head
Only eight of us
Even small gangs are a threat
To get to Union Square
We'll have to spill some blood and sweat

[2nd chorus]
Warriors, come out to play
Lives taken away
Some want us alive and some want us dead
Through radio the word is spread

Fighting our way home
Got split up in the mess
Women equal trouble
Handlin' it's what we do best
They think we shot Cyris
The whole city's on our ass
But the Rogues are the ones who did it
How long can they last?

[Repeat 2nd chorus]

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

Home, and got the traitors where we want them
Cowards hold a gun on us, we confront them
But the truth is out, our name is clear
The executioner's here
Revenge

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

Those who attack us won't live to regret it
Stand against Warriors scared like a rabbit
We're not just good, we are best
This feeling will haunt you in hell
