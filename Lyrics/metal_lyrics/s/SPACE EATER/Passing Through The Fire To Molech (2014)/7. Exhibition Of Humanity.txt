[MatkoviÄ]

Imperfection is the proof that confirms existence
Evil is the exhaust of life
Death ends all, so it doesn't really matter
Dead, you can't witness the defilement of your corpse
It spreads like the plague of western civilization
Killing all opposed to the greatest of the nations
The ways of the pure as wrong as they may seem
Suppressed and forgotten like a bad dream

[Chorus]
What I've known
Of humans
Watered down
By evil man

Nazis, conquistadors, pseudo-communists, crusades
The most valuable of treasures forcefully swept away
Burnt in ovens, pierced by spears, thrown into pits
Laughter of the predators, rage sick
Crush the skull in bloody revenge
Deeds in the mirror, are you better than them?
Even if you cleanse the world of evil that men do
You're still left with destiny to fuck you

[Repeat chorus]

Burn houses of saints
Exhibit cut off heads on stakes
Exterminate them all
Resistance will fall
Women are all raped
Steal the children as your slaves
For mercy they call
Your flag stands tall

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Children die and men will cry when destiny sings
Lives are it's to claim, take no chances
Death will strike, you will not be warned, so fight
Be it a man or your fate

Deities that direct the movies of our time
I greet you with disbelief and hatred
We're hypnotized by moving images and sounds
While the bones of our brothers pile in garbage dumps

[Solo: Kozeljnik]

Imperfection is the proof that confirms existence
Evil is the exhaust of life
Death ends all, so it doesn't really matter
Dead, you can't witness the development of wars
This plague erases western civilization
Killing all man, regardless of the nation
Survivors have no knowledge of previous lore
Take their place in this circle like ancestors before

[Repeat chorus]
