[MatkoviÄ/DaniloviÄ]

Worker by day
Shinobi at night
Behold my creed
My clan trained me through life
Daimyo's call
Haste through the dark
Pursuing the mark

[Chorus]
I'll infiltrate, through the shadows
Burn your castle from inside
Is this the work of Oni
Your dying screams
Echo in the void

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Tanto ripps necks
Shuriken stars
Instant death
No mistakes, no scars
Techniques to survive
To sneak and to hide
To steal and to fight

[Repeat chorus]

[LukoviÄ lead]

Wander your chambers with stealth
Shrieking floors, see-through walls
Dare to cross my path and die
I set the flames free

Panic bursts among your men
Agonized, with fear in veins
Unaware of what hit you
My work here is done

I have claimed your life

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

The raid is set
Now I am the prey
Ronins have sworn
To never betray
But their effort's in vain
The trees are my sanctuary
Forever I'm safe

[Chorus]
I'll infiltrate, through the shadows
Burn your castle from inside
Is this the work of Oni
Your dying screams
Echo in the...
After I'm paid, I'll return to my home
Live my everyday life
This is the work of Oni
Your dying screams
Echo in the void
