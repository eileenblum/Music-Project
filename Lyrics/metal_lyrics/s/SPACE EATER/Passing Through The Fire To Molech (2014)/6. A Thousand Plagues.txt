[MatkoviÄ]

Death - the supreme disease
As well as the ultimate cure
With every illness in the book
Through my so called life I endure

Chunks of skin and flesh detach
State of mind and body match
Deep dementia captivates
Hades holds with open gates

[Chorus]
God sent upon me
A thousand plagues
Punishment fierce
Mercy, I beg

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

No drug can heal me
No drug can make my decay worse
Burning, itching, pain, all tissue dies
Cramps father my every move

Solitude, no comfort words
None of the painkillers work
Yearning for my final breath
As much as I'm scared of death

[2nd chorus]
God sent upon me
A thousand plagues
Punishment fierce
Mercy, I beg
What is my sin?
To Satan I've pledged
Biblical fine
Mercy, I beg

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Wait, mind clears
Glimmer of hope
No!
Smite by the pain
All hope in vain

This agony will never end

[Repeat 2nd chorus]
