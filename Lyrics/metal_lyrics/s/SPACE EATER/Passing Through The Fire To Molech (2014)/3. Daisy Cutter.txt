[MatkoviÄ]

Watch your doom in the sky
Descending with serenity
Dread wiped from your face, all in radius erased
Feeble civilians scream in agony

Thousands of pounds of metal attack
Heated corpses shattered by the blast

[Chorus]
Daisy Cutter

Trees turn to torches, and all living scorches
Feel the smell of your own flesh burnt by fuel
An infernal view through smoke and dust
Announces victory in this duel

Survivors suffocate in gas, smoke and dust
Bones of the slain remain to combust

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

I flew here in a chopper
From across the water
To cut your daisies low
And make you die all slow
Now i sit in my cell
My mind creates hell
Flash before my eyes
These memories never die

The cruelty of my deeds drives me insane
Hundreds of innocents slain by my hand

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

[Repeat chorus]
