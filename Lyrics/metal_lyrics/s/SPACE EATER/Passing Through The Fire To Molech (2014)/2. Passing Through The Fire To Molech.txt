[MatkoviÄ/DaniloviÄ]

Approach
The idol covered in mothers' tears
Taurus stares at you from the top of this temple of murdered heirs

Struck with dread, the gates now open
Emerging flames devour, smoke is choking
He welcomes you with arms wide spread
Towards your fiery doom slowly tread

Loud banging of drums
To overpower your wails
Submit your life
Inhale thy flames

[Chorus]
Passing through the fire to Molech

Oven of death, offspring eater
What blind fanaticism makes one take this detour?
No questions raised, too much to demand?
Perform ancient rituals Jehova condemned

The zealot swarm
In ecstasy cries
Opposed to him
All hope now dies

[Repeat chorus]

Mystery unsolved

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Is this a legend that never took place
Four-dimensional beings harvest energy of the human race

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

We are the children sacrificed
To Molechs of modern society
Loud drums played by the dark priests
Still silence our yells and screams

The setting, never it changes
History repeats itself
The scales just grow vastly larger
Still our screams unheard

[Repeat chorus]
