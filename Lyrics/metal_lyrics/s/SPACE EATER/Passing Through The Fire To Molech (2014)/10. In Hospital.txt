[MatkoviÄ]

Bed sheets smeared with blood
Hours become days
Imprisoned by a fault of mother nature's ways
Sniffing on death
The smell of decay
Become an easy pray

[Chorus]
Throwing up blood
Instruments of gore shredding my flesh
Ripping needles out of my veins
Collapse, betrayed by strength
Smell of urine stings
Counting the days
Inside this hospital
Empty sheets all that remains

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Planning the escape
Living for the day
Out on the streets, like a child to play
The great comeback to life
Features many downs
Betrayed and frowned

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: MatkoviÄ]

Stuck in my own fucking way
I'm the Sisyphus rolling stones
Mute, but got so much to say
I'm so blind, and there's so much to see
I'm so deaf, and there's so much to hear
My revenge is the spreading of fear

[Solo: LukoviÄ]

As I pull the knife out of your neck
Blood pattern on the wall occurs
It draws the sign of Satan
I realize that your eyes were not true
Agonized by the thought of killing you
And there is only one thing you can do
Die

But wait, what's this that you say?
A part of me still to this day lives in you
Tables have turned, shrugging I stare at your grave
Irony laughs at you
Swallow your pride for I've won this war
I've come to collect your remains
With your last bit of strength you fight, but it's too late
The vortex of time consumes you
