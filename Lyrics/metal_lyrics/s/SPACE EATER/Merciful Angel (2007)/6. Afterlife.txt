[music by Radisic and Sarsanski, lyrics by Radisic]

My life is over
Time is up for my existence
Where do I go now?
Destination from the visions
Closing chapter
Just another in the millions
Final laughter
Journey starts, the fall begins

I see sparks in the devil's eyes
The court supreme has found me guilty
Verdict unfair as it seems to me
Previous life stays behind - I must go now

No purgatory
The sum of my entire lifetime
No earthly glory
Savior hand I wouldn't decline
Desperation
Internal pain is overwhelming
Violation
That's why I died, that's why I'm leaving

My new home is burning me
Acid baths, cauldrons of death
Resistance is futile, just enjoy the pain
Previous life stays behind - I must go now

Fires in the pits of hell
Scorched every single time
Can't breathe, impossible to yell
Silence devours me

Previous life stays behind, previous life stays behind
Previous life stays behind, previous life stays behind - I must go now
