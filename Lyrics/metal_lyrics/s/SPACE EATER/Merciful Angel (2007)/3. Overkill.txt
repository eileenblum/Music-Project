[music by Sarsanski and Testen, lyrics by Radisic]

More radiation in the air
Each day new victims, it ain't fair
Moving through our lives in fear
And see the future crystal clear

Blistered corpses rotting slow
In the rivers poisons flow
Toxic waste where children play
This world's for sure on the path of decay

This world ain't moving, it's holding still
It's coming on us - overkill
I see a fire burning high
One more atomic lullaby

Pollution sweeps our mother Earth
Small chances for life's rebirth
Oxygen spite by venomous gas
Turning the air into a deadly mass

Alarm's ringing for final warning
The rich would say it's pretty boring
Fools don't know their lives are at stake
They're gonna make that fatal mistake

This world ain't moving, it's holding still
It's coming on us - overkill
I see a fire burning high
One more atomic lullaby

Perpetual shade of blackened sky
Darkness rules over this valley of cry
Still the factories are pounding faster
Leading us all to our disaster

This is it - overkill
Counting costs - overkill
Lasting pain - overkill
Dying world - overkill
