[music by Radisic and Sarsanski, lyrics by Radisic]

The all-consuming love for you
Brought brightness to my night
The moments for eternity
To remember all my life

Still I'm searching for that glow
But you simply went away
The mists fell down and I was lost
My life had gone astray

Searched for love found only lies
Will I ever see the truth in your
Deceitful eyes [4x]

Dealing with my shattered heart
Is the hardest task of all
I'm gazing at the empty walls
And waiting for your call

Gone are days of happiness
But I have found new sense
Still I'm yearning for that time
When all was so intense

Searched for love found only lies
Will I ever see the truth in your
Deceitful eyes [8x]
