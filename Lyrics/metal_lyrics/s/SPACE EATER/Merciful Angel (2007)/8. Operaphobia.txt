[music by Radisic and Sarsanski, lyrics by Radisic]

When I was a kid I heard strange noises
Some weird music coming from TV
What a horrific site it was
A fat lady was screaming at me

Don't scream at me
I hate opera!

What a hysteric reaction I had
Crying like rain that whole afternoon
It left lasting trauma in my little mind
Fearing fat lady would come for me soon

Don't scream at me
Operaphobia!
