[music by Radisic and Sarsanski. Lyrics by Radisic]

Fear the oblique eater of space
Hauling everything into its cold dark embrace
Invisible until it's too late

The shivering touch of the dark matter chills
Feeding on stars and the planets are killed
Even light can't escape this fate

Grinding us all to dust
The only thing sure you can trust
Gravity pounds as we're being devoured
In the black hole we'll see - SPACE EATER

Plasmatic bolts of regurgitated mass
Exhausting from sides of this astral caress
Compacted inside, from its twin it was torn

Continuum bent into strange forms
Disfigured is space and time is conformed
Swirling around, the new order is born

Grinding us all to dust
The only thing sure you can trust
Gravity pounds as we're being devoured
In the black hole we'll see - SPACE EATER

Close your eyes as the darkness will rise
Reaching forth for our souls
Reduced to spots in oblivious void
This density is much too cold

Molecular structure falls apart
Is this a chance for a new start
A passageway to another plain
The questions keep ringing in my brain

Grinding us all to dust
The only thing sure you can trust
Gravity pounds as we're being devoured
In the black hole we'll see - SPACE EATER

SPACE EATER
will devour you all!
