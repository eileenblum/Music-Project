[music by Radisic and Sarsanski, lyrics by Radisic]

A blind messiah leads our salvation
He paves the path of an entire nation
He's talking to people of unknown promised land
But we know there's nothing except lizards and sand

Fighting the battles and drowning in seas
In future of ours no one believes
Slowly dragging from one place to the next
All that we earned is eternal unrest

Telling us lies in the tone made to please us
He is the One, he is disguised as Jesus
Tainting our minds, that despicable liar
He is the One, the darkened messiah

Into abyss they will follow his word
Not stopping to think of things that they heard
Jump of the cliffs all on his command
How many more dead till we make a stand

Trembling in fear, disregarding the signs
Always pace up on the ongoing climbs
Constantly draining our money and lives
Promising heaven while we barely survive

Telling us lies in the tone made to please us
He is the One, he is disguised as Jesus
Tainting our minds, that despicable liar
He is the One, the darkened messiah

His powers shade what's true
We could never ever see the clues
Lifeless, on our knees
Hear the laughter from the dredged deeps
Sinking, holding straws
Weakened by his deadly blows
Lies are still the same
We're the only ones to take the blame - for our demise
