[music by Radisic and Sarsanski, lyrics by Radisic]

Iron birds are in the sky
From far away they have flied
To throw the bombs on my people
And kill them all or make them cripples
Sorry if we're not afraid
This particular nation you can't slay
We shall stay here with our pride
All you do to us is genocide

Bombs away, bombs away, bombs away
Bomb them all, the entire nation
Bomb them all 'til extermination
'Cause they're evil, they must die
Not one person must survive

Mission accomplished, or maybe not
Civilians' corpses stay to rot
Will you tell your kids how brave you were
You killed for a living without concern
Destroyed bridges, buildings on fire
Wounded man - one more liar
In your eyes all of us are filth
Ferocious beasts that need to be killed

Bombs away, bombs away, bombs away, bombs away

But on the ground you have stayed
Rescue mission also failed
Dead commandos lay around
Another sight for TV crowd
Don't you fly over our heads
'Cause it will be your shameful end
You don't realize, dearest dope
This holy land's your final stop

Bombs away, bombs away, bombs away
Bomb them all, the entire nation
Bomb them all 'til extermination
'Cause they're evil they must die
Not one person must survive
Bomb them all, the entire nation
Bomb them all without hesitation
'Cause they're evil, they must die
Not one person must survive
