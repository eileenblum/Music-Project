[music by Sarsanski, lyrics by Radisic]

Hidden in the fields, roads and cities
Lurk dangerous toys, long forgotten
Never rustin' away or being dismantled
Still perilous remnants of the battle

Horrific sites of bodies blown to pieces
Once living people gathered part by part
Collateral damage even in the peace time
Senseless victims of an insane war crime

One wrong step and you'll feel the blow
Lethal bite of death from below
Swept away leaving bloody trace
Death from below will explode in your face

Marking all the spots where they're found, 'cause
One wrong step's enough for detonation
No one can feel safe or protected
As long as they aren't traced or detected

One wrong step and you'll feel the blow
Lethal bite of death from below

Civilian convoys are threatened
Innocent children endangered while playing
Designed for annihilation
Of human force and mechanization
Landmines serve only purpose
Of cruel and cowardice warfare
Military industry thrives
But generals don't wonder where it will lead us
