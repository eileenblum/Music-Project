A world in tears
A night forgotten
Dreams of fire
Awakes our sleeping power
Fallen are the kings of yesterday
The princess of before watches in tears
This earthly nest, our shadowthirst
Behind this world the Dragons breath
The Daemons laughter echoes
Through the broken dungeons
Every man and woman a star
Gleaming eyes of fear adore
Dark mistress lust our whore
Every being a hidden god
The worlds collide
Open the gates of the night
The lust of the beast
As the hidden god arise.
