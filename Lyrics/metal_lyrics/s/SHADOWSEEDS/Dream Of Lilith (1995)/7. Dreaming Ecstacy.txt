Black water greets my windling journey
Deep down below the sun
The sky is no longer seen
Fear will never ever return again
Alone I will face thy night
In frozen woods so cold I'll walk
Where no one has ever been I'll rule
Follow me now, embrace the shells
Shadows emerging from silent halls
Arising beasts of eternal flames
Seven fires cleanse the sky
Dreaming ecstasy... set me free
We are the Dragon's blood
Outside time and space we stood
Let the fire flow in your soul
The red Dragon awaken is
Alone I will face my fright
Frozen landscapes once so near
Where I have never been
I must carry the sun through the shades
Cast upon this sea of agony
In nocturnal hours of my lust
Raptured I am losing ground
Only to win it back in thousands
As the sky turns from blue to red
We are the Dragon's blood
Outside time and space we stand
Let the fire caress your soul
The red Dragon awaken is
Dreaming ecstasy... set me free.
