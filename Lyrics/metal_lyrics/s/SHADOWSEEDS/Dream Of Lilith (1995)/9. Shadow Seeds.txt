[Part 1: The Eye Of Shiva]

[Instrumental]

[Part 2: The Black Diamond]

Rudis indigest'aque moles
Hear the Serpent's voice:
Your eyes shall be opened
And you will become a god
Sleep!
Let the darkness be your light
Fall!
Go deep inside your mind
Dream!
Be awake in your dreams
Take control of your will
Your passions and thoughts
Create worlds
Go from reality to reality
The end of the tunnel
Threshold to reality
The other side of the black hole
Transcend from morality
To divinity
This is the alchemy
Of the Black Shimmering Diamond.
