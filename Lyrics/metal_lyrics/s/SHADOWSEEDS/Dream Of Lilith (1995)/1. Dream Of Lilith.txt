Enter the gate to the nightside of dreams
Follow the roots deep underground
Ride the serpent to the depth of your soul
Find your way through the mist
The womb Of darkness
Is your open Eye
The gate to the force
Is the Dream of Lilith
In the dark forest you will find the cave
Where the princess of serpents rest
She's your mistress releasing your powers inside
Her breath is your fantasy
Through the womb of darkness
Your journey begins
The gate to the force
Is the Dream of Lilith
She awaits with desire
For your arising spirit
To meet the Dragon
The Dream of Lilith.
