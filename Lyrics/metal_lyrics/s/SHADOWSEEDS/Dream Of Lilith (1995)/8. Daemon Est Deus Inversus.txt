When you seek the pearl
And open the shell
You will find your heaven
Inside your hell
The tree you climb
Is the deepest well
The place you fear
Is where you dwell
When you are rising
You are the one who fell
When you've been told
You are the one to tell
You have to go far
To see what you are
The one you want to be
Are the devil you won't see
Daemon est Deus inversus
Nox est Lux.
