Night Of Pan
In the Desert of Seth
A formula of might
To interpret
The rising force
The deepest drive
A way to die
To be alive
The son of the sun born in ecstasy
To burn the bonds of humanity
Life and death conjoined in one
In the light of the lion serpent sun
The powers of lust released
With the ascending of the beast
Nightmares of the past
The pleasures of today
The Draconian Cult
Grows on the decay
Exalted in power
Of the solar beam
To make a reality
Of the Dream.
