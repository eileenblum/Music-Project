The world in war before eternity
The beast and the whore
Ascending from the sea
To preach the lore of blasphemy
And reach the score of infinity
The apocalyptic riders
Proclaims the second flood
A new world is born
Baptized in blood
The sign of the sun
Shine in lust and pain
Over the aeon to come
On humanitys lane
For treasure to gain
And the pleasures to reign
Apocalyptic riders
And signs to see
Proclaims the chaos
Of ecstasy
The sundemon Sorath
Announce the second flood
A new world is born
Baptized in blood.
