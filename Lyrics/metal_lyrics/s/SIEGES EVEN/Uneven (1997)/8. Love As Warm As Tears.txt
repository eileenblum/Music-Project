Walking inside your room  I feel as if I'm lost  it wast last year June
when you went out of sight  but not out of mind
and I had to stay and put the past behind  wandering around the brine
we're often used to stare at in summertime
I feel as if you stand on the waterside
don't you think there's something left untried  standing at the place we met
I agree to be as you said  have to laugh about myself  yeah I do; yeah I do
I should cry about myself and my sick behaviour
but I can't keep a straight face I don't know what I should do
I feel totally displaced  I feel out of place
what you've said to me left a strange flavour  but now I am amused
it seems, I hope, I feel that I'm out of danger  I just can laugh
driving the streets we drove  I feel you be my side  I make my eyes rove
but when I see the plain  where we used to stop at
a voice inside my brain said let curtains drop  that was the place of sorrow
this was the place of joy  here I forgot tomorrow
this was where pleasure and joy alloy  mission, seclusion - a kind of disolution
ruction, destruction - a falling reconstruction
vexation, collision - object of derision
tension, addiction - omnipresent friction  it was a time of sorrow
it was a time of joy  when I forgot tomorrow
it was where pleasure and joy alloy  love as warm as tears
it is a precious veil  love is as cold as dark fear  can be a hurting nail
