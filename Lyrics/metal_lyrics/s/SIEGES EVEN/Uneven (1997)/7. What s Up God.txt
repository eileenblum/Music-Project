Don't you bear the voices  calling for someone shaped like you
watch their fingers clenching  round the cross once misconstrued
what's wrong god  you became odd  this was your job  why did you stop
now you look helpless god  you're still mute  what about your son
we'd like to salute  we'd like to see the one  now you can show us your skills
it seems to be your chance  pull yourself up
oh, sorry - didn't know you feel sick  you're getting in retirement age
you're off, you're carried off the stage  you're said to be a mastermind
so if you feel inclined  get yourself going
oh sorry - did you know you feel sick  hey god, what is up
hey god, your glance is sad  sorry for asking, but is it your age?
"The one who's always there"  a new name, would be fair
excuse me, but now I know you're feeling sick
