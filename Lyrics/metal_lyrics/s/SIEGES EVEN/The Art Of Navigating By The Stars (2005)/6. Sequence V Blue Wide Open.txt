Riding on a sea spray,
Falling from the sky,
Riding on a sea spray,
Blue wide open sea and sky.

The sky is blue wide open
A grand vision to sink into
Lonely views to stir the eye
Moments of grace outside of the real
The sea is blue wide open
Completeness all around
One step further and the weight gives way
To all the dreams that are

Riding on a sea spray
Falling from the sky
Riding on a sea spray
Blue wide open sea and sky

just like an echo of light
Canned in the heart of the stone
A wayward pulse beating in the stillness
Beneath the snow something's breaking through

All in the wind through the Strait of Magellan,
Beneath the Southern Cross we sail the wild wild sea,
To reach all things out of reach, the promise of the name, on and ever on,
The distant harbor lights of ValparaÃ­so.
