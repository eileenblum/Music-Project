Somewhere in the city somewhere in the room
A silent man a work undone a plan that went astray
Somewhere in the lime light of a yearning reverie
Words have lost their meaning on the fragile stage of fame

The sky is starless for the ones who have failed
Going nowhere nowhere to go
Life has no kindness for the ones who have failed
Going somewhere anywhere but home

Sky without stars
Stars without sky
Sky without stars
Stars without sky

Somewhere in a wasteland on a windy railway bridge
A desperate girl is looking down on all she'll leave behind
Somewhere in a subway a vacant name an unknown face
Another everyday disgrace in the roundabouts of life

The sky is starless for the ones who have failed
Going nowhere nowhere to go
Life has no kindness for the ones who have failed
Going somewhere anywhere but home

Sky without stars
Stars without sky
Sky without stars
Stars without sky

The sky is starless for the ones who have failed
Going nowhere nowhere to go
Life has no kindness for the ones who have failed
Going somewhere anywhere but home
