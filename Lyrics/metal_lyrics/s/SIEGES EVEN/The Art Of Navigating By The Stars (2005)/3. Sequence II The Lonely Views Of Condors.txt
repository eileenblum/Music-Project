[Woman on voice mail:]
Hi babe, I'm glad you called. I've been wanting to talk to you, too. I miss you. Call me. Bye.

Sometimes it's coming over me
feels like a warm rain
Sometimes it's coming back to me
Like a memory
Just like the heat of endless winters
The cold of midday suns
It's the longest, the longest way a man can go
Sometimes it's more than I can take

Last night I spread my wings
Upon two worlds colliding
And somewhere in the monstrous distance
The world, it came down on me

Now I am soaring on lost latitude
A navigator with no chart
Looking down on all the colours that
Separate day from night

And all the demons in my head
Still permeate the sleep
I will feast upon their strange desires
Bring me something to keep the night away

And here I am
So close and yet too far from you
And here I stand
lost in the echoes of goodbyes
And here I am
Still with something left to lose

A world was lost the other day
And I am choking on the sediments
And all the things that could have been would have been
Are the things than will not let me grow

Drifting through the bitter echoes,
And the stillness far and wide,
All alone with the nameless phantoms
Chasing down a lonely road

Sometimes it's coming over me
Like a warm rain
Sometimes it's coming back to me
Like it's all destiny

And here I am,
So close and yet too far away from you,
And here I stand,
Lost in the echoes of goodbyes.
And here I am,
I'm so close and yet too far away from you,
And here I stand,
Lost in the echoes of goodbyesâ¦
Here I am! Here I stand!
I'm lost in the echoes of goodbyes!
Here I standâ¦
