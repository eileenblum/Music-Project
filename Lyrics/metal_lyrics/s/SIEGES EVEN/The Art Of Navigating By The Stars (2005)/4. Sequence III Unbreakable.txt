All around this fortress
Ran the rivers of the dead
Broke what seemed to be unbreakable
Unreachable
Drowned what seemed to be impregnable
Infallible
Cold September rain the summer's retreat
A tapestry of falling stars

This truth is small and truly trite
There's no such thing as permanence
But loss is like an undertow
Pulling you down pulling you down

Because to me, because to me you were unbreakable
Because to me, because to me you were unbreakable
Because to me, because to me you were, you were

Tonight I'm drilling holes
Into the blueprint in my chart
To drain the liquid shades of gray
That ran like rivers from my monument
To reach the core to breathe again
Find the long lost words
My credo and my curse:
"We few, we happy few"

When all the world turns into stone
And everything just stays the same
There's no safe harbour in our sight
Still we are, still we are,
Navigating, we're navigating by the stars.

Because to me, because to me, you were unbreakable.
Because to me, because to me, you were unbreakable.
Because you were, you were,
Nothing is, nothing was, nothing, ever will be:
Unbreakableâ¦
Because you were, you were,
Unbreakableâ¦
