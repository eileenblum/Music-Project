[Sound of hospital pulse machine]

Sunlight is drowning the half-light
As the feelings return
Strange and familiar a nocturnal fear
Appearing and disappearing

There is the river running deep
And it is floating through the veins
A nameless dread of the unknown
Temporary sight an apprehension
Vague yet saddening

Black angels guiding me
The sum of all my fears
Black angels owning me
Whispering through me

The ties are loosening

Black angels guiding me
Praise me with their charts,
Black angels carrying me,
Into the wordless into the neverland

All sights and sounds slowly dissolve
No gravity no memory

Far off stars in the afterglow
A god removes the veil
I'm holding in and I'm holding it out
Until the strangeness disappears

Last night I heard the waters dreaming
Stones were fast asleep along the riverbed

Let the waters wash all over me and let me dream again of something good
Let me dream again of something good,

Let me dream of sheltered places of precious moments
And of long-lost faces of truthful words that finally do make some sense
Truthful words that make some sense.

Lay out, lay out these maps before me
Let me trace again the borderlines of land and sea

Flood the tide pools and wash away the shores
No longer at the mercy of the waves just let me breathe again

Let me stand and bathe in the healing light
And one more time let me navigate just let me navigate by the stars

Roads and rivers a winding in a circle
Around the same old headstrong me
Outside looking in time and time again
Feeling the heat of a recurring dream

Will the view from there be frightening?
Will the view from there be frightening?
Will the view from there be frightening?
Will the view from there be frightening?
Will the view from there be frightening?
Will the view from there be frightening?
Will the view from thereâ¦
