The air is steam and fire
A lift-off to negate defeat
A victory imperfect, there's always more
It's all we've ever longed to reach
And all we've ever longed to see
Someday, somewhere
On a highway to the sun
With marvelled eyes, with blinded eyes we'll watch
The holocaust of our wildest dreams

From here to nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
From there to somewhere (somewhere, somewhere)
From the seas to the highest heights
From the moon to the lowest lows
From a spark to a raging fire
From the heart to the sateless mind

Stunned and amazed by what we are
We celebrate and name the stars
Expand, aspire, don't look ahead
The more we grow the less we see
The less we see the more we'll find
The light that blinds is darkness to our eyes

Through a telescope I dream
A summit in the sky blue snow
I'll carve my name into withered stone
It's all I've ever longed to do
And all I've ever longed to feel
I'd burn the midnight oil to get there
If I could only reach you now
If I could only name you now
The blind spot on a yellowed map

Stunned and amazed by what I am
To feel alive in some lonesome luck
Explore, desire, don't look ahead
The higher I go the less I see
The deeper it hurts the less I feel
And the heart of the matter is hardly to perceive

From here to nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
From there to somewhere (somewhere, somewhere)
From the seas to the highest heights
From the moon to the lowest lows
From cult to culture, from ape to man
From the hand to the hungry mouth
