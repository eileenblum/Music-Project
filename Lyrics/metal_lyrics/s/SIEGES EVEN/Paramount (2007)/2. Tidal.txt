You
A faun in twilight
Immaculate perfection

I
A god in half-light
A hero in a play

Pale blue scenery
Fleeting moments passing by
Dots and anagrams
In the sands of time and the wind

Us
A monument of sand to
Defy the odds

Us
A rampart made of dreams
That would not last

So tired without you
The sultry heat of summers gone
Melted hands of time
An enigmatic poem on our skins

With each changing of the tides
We renewed a fragile bond
We were blessed and we were cursed

A gush of water swept away
All we swore and all we said
Indelibly, unspoken spells
Unbroken hours slowly passed

We are
Ghost and shadows straining to be heard
We are
Like ships and waifs waiting for the tide
We are
Surrendered to the heat, surrendered to the wait
We are
Long gone with the wind

Listless summer days
Without care of where to go
Coming back to me
Tinted moments of our luck

Though we were too weak
Wished to pause the restless clocks
To hold life for a while
The peal of bells above the rain
(Made it end)

A gush of water swept away
All we swore and all we said
Indelibly, unspoken spells
Unbroken hours slowly passed

We are
Aching whispers, windswept memories
We are
Like birds in flight sleeping on the storms
We are
Not Daphnis or not Chloe anymore
We are
Long gone with the tide
