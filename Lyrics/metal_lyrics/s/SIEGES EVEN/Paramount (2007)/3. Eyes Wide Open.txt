Like a brilliant thief
You stole into the room
Night was so long
Now all the lights are way too bright

One small voice
Of conquest and doubt
One deep breath
Easily sweeps the stars away

A world of pantomime in black and white
A wingless angel on a willful flight

With eyes wide open - through an opened door
With eyes wide open - swim the river running deep
With eyes wide open - that chase the clouds away
In skies wide open - eyes of knowing, opened eyes, and they've already seen it all

Go out at night
Perplex the dark with light
Stretch out this life
To see what it is, what it means

Build a stronghold
Of keepsakes and air
And dreams you can cling to
After the magic has all gone

In places of turmoil and uncertain sights
Untouched you'll grow in the shadow of a wall

With eyes wide open - through a boundless room
With eyes wide open - the road unfolds ahead
With eyes wide open - paint your sky in red and blue
In nights wide open - I rest beside of you
Watching every pulse and the peace of your sleep

A world of pantomime in black and white
A wingless angel on a willful flight

With eyes wide open - through a boundless room
With eyes wide open - the road unfolds ahead
With eyes wide open - paint your sky in red and blue
In nights wide open - I rest beside of you
Watching every pulse and the peace of your sleep
