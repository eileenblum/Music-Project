Did you see - the lonely tree?
Crowded by the birds - bringing back old memories
Birds of prey - roaring near
Aiming at the shores - waging war on men
In the end - bridges burned
Arching cross the sky - mother dropped her little boy
I'm feeling - and dreaming
There will come a day when the cranes will fly again

I put a strip on its leg for prayer
One thousand cranes make you last forever
This is our cry, our bridge to the divine
Flying birds - they will touch the sun
Just let them fly - they enlighten the dark world
This is our cry, this is your bridge to the divine

Twist of fate - scorched to death
Apollo didn't know that they were messing up our world
God of sun - what went wrong?
On a summer day - all got covered by black rain

I put a strip on its leg for prayer
One thousand cranes make you last forever
This is our cry, our bridge to the divine
Flying birds - they will touch the sun
Just let them fly - they enlighten the dark world
This is our cry, this is your bridge to the divine

Fly away - fly away - touch the sun
Fly away - fly away - peace on earth
