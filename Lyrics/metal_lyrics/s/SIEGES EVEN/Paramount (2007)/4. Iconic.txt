Visions from above
Father's son on high
Sharing all his love
He's the one to make you fly

Christ the redeemer - an icon for mankind
Atop the corcovado mountain sky

Both his arms are open wide
Inviting you to see the light
open-heartedness - old virtues come alive

There is magic in the air
Enter on a higher sphere
Existential interlink between yourself and holy god

Turn around and look through my eyes
You may find the world's archetype

Distinct viewpoint of the world
Longing for a rest in peace
Moses brought the ten commandments to be learned

Watch me, touch me - I'm error-free, there can be no doubt
You're gonna see the world through different eyes
Different eyes are gonna change the world - you just have to

Turn around and look through my eyes
You may find the world's archetype - the holy ghost

Corco - corcovado, corco - corcovado
Corco - corcovado, corco - corcovado

Visions from above
Father's son on high
Sharing all his love
Standing there with open arms

Christ the redeemer - icon for mankind
Atop the corcovado mountain sky
Christ the redeemer - monument of hope, so high
Can you feel the magic high and low

Watch me, touch me - I'm error-free, there can be no doubt
You're gonna see the world through different eyes
Different eyes are gonna change the world

Turn around and look through my eyes
You may find the world's archetype - the icon of God
