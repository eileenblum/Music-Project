Like a demon, like a ghost
Balancing on nerves, dancing on the edge
Like a wheel or a dream
Spinning endlessly, spinning helplessly

A painted drama, a feverish restraint
An unspoken trauma in sweltering nights

Like a ray of light that stains a bitter sweetness
Into the darkest wine
A dark chimera wide awake
Sipping from the lifeblood

I drank, drank from you
I drank wine like blood
Blood like wine
And the magic sounds of inspiration

I learned, learned from you
A hidden secret
Black as rain
Moving me, moving on and on

This is the way of the mystic
Into the eyes of god
This is the weight the moves the hand
This is the hand that moves the stone

A ravaged beauty, unfeeling and unsafe
A power that resides in the labyrinth of sound

This is a fire that ignites itself
This is a mystery of art
So much more than craft or chemistry
Gabriel 'gainst Azrael

You spoke, spoke to me
A silent prayer
For the pain
And the driving force of desperation

You sang, sang to me
Haunting songs of hope
And songs of doubt
Moving me, moving on and on

A force like lightning over mountains
A permanent disease
It's you and me together
On a highway without end

I drank, drank from you
I drank wine like blood
Blood like wine
And the magic sounds of inspiration
I learned, learned from you
A hidden secret
Black as rain
Moving me, moving on and on
