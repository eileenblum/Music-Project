My friend
I've come to talk to you again
Like to answer your questions
I don't think that all is said and done
I remember our laughing
Don't you remember our playing in the woods
Ignore the burning warning-lamp
Try to be my friend
Nomore for friendship you have to pay
Water the barren tree
The wind tool away your memories
You're trying to understand what all this means
Kind of strangest dream
My friend
I know that we've changed
But is it essential?
I hope, you'll rethink and change your mind
Don't you remember our journey
I remember our hurting argument
Ignore the burning warning-lamp
Try to be my friend
Nomore
For friendship you have to pay
Water the barren tree
Cool water could quench our thirst, it could stop the worst
So why don't you water the tree?
Why don't you believe in me?
Sometimes I think you're the only one who understands
Sometimes your presence makes me crying
Water the barren tree
