Noise in my ears
You're talking but I can't understand
You should realize
Your problems won't be mine, don't attempt
I know why I'm just able to sleep
Words searching for
A way into my mind, but they won't find
A drug addict?
What a shock to hear this about you
I don't care
Recitative
A sold for the talking one, the lost son, who is not able to sleep

Trouble talker, just a talker
Trouble talker talk

I don't give a rap about your jeremiad
Fictitious speaking makes me mourning
And I know you won't change
Real compression
You'll never get from me, any comfort
I don't care
Piece of advice
Friendly I support saving thoughts
And I know you'll be able to sleep
I don't give a rap about your jeremiad
Fictitious speaking makes me mourning

Trouble talker, just a talker
Trouble talker talk
