You better should know
It isn't a show
It's not a gag
A song full of sense - extravagance
I've got in my bag
For my morphemes
That themes
Are no handicap
I live the life of a thinker
Have got all classics in my repertoire
I've got no choice
I prefer boyce
To classical art
Expressive sound
Scho"nberg I found
Left grandpa Mozart
I live a life with high standards
That's why I like being cultured
Can't you see it in my eyes
My education is no disguise
The reason why I'm talking over your head
I'm a grad
A good excuse I always use is my intellect
No doubt - you're out
That's a fact
Can't you see it in my eyes
My education is no disguise
The reason why I'm talking over your head
I'm a grad
