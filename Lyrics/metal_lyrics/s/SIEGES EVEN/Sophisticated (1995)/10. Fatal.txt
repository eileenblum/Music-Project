You always told me I was the only one
Aah - it's nothing serious "It's just for fun"
And while I try to understand
You whisper
"All I feel, I feel for you"
I believe you do
"I never want to hurt your feelings, but please remember there was something you said"
I always told you I practise tolerance
Now I recognize that was a fatal utterance
I always thought it would it would leave me cold
Wish I could stay
But I can't
I know it was my fault an I've to take the blame
And please don't say you love me - this would even mean more pain
Wish I could stay but my feelings force me to say
I've to go
Wish I could start it up again
But who can change what feelings dictate?
I talked without a thought
Don't want you anymore
