Searching my soul for the cure
To heal the wounds of earth
But who am I to tell them what to do
So I'm sailing around with my head on the ground
Searching for the cure
As the world moves on
Where's the switch in my mind
For the answers I can't find
To find and reest the bad of misery
And wish that there's a light that would end up my fight
I'm running out of timw
As the world moves on
So I keep searching my soul
To heal the wounds of Earth
But who am I to tell them what say
No help, no solution for my contribution
It's driving me insane
As the world moves on
