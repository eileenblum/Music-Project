Who am I and where do we go?
Does what I think and feel comfort with what I do?
I can be eye to eye with me
Joining the common dance
Joining the social trance
No hackneyed phrase like "I live life - I'm free"
No talking about great liberty
The wellknown face of the talker
Who thinks he's dropped out
Makes me feel sick
I keep on dancing
I keep on turning round and round
Who is able to say
He found his way?
Who knows how to behave
Not to become a slave?
Hallucination of self-realization
Indoctrination of civilization
Who are you to say
This can't be my way?
No hackneys phrase like "I live my life - I'm free"
No talking about great liberty
The wellknown face of the talker
Who thinks he's dropped out
Makes me feel sick
I keep on dancing
I keep on turning round and round
Who am I and where do we go?
