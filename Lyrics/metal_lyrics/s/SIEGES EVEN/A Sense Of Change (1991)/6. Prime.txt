[Music: Holzwarth, Holzwarth, Steffen. Lyrics: Stefffen]

Driven by a motive, impatient and absurd.
Conceited eyes focused on the path of least resistance.
Ignoring prohibitions the enlightened ones learn to doom indesicion.
Disbelief assails a patient heart as kings arise from plastic and disguise.

Can you define the drive, the cause, the longing?
Aspiration will breed frustration
when plans and aims are shattered
by hands grabbing for progress.

Strange ambition might lead to dacadence
With hubris heading for success, grabbing for progress,
and kings arise from plastic and disguise.
