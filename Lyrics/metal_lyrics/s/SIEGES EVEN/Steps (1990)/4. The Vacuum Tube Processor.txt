Nice multicoloured screen delivers multicoloured vision.
Black robe with praising hand changed from above -with mission

Superficial heads
Superficial eyes within
That look but cannot see
Dream a nebulous reality.

We live the postmodern world
With its trades of audio-comfort

You can change the programme:

A fast trip through various reality, exotic cake and spectral-colour shape
Just choose your enemy then focus and blast at him your energy.

Artificial heads
Artificial eyes within
That look but cannot see
Dream a nebulous reality.

You can change programme and throw away the key to reason.

[Lyrics: O. Holzwarth]
