Finally we have changed this place for good
Living in one world yet in different worlds,
Ain't got no fear of anything but fear itself
Indifferent eyes learn to live indifferent lives.

Where men degrade their wives and get away with rape,
Morality is a cynic passion play,
The old man stands alone in the hall of his asylum,
Brave yet afraid we keep holding our ground.

Corridors - narrow ways that lead to the island of alienation a sullen passage, an empty mind.
Corridors -Inside hospital walls, sterile school halls,
In the subway's neon light, in suburban towers of concrete and steel.
Corridors - Where we hide the instruments of the fear, where doubt resides,
Out of sight drift things that we love
Corridors - Impersonality walks endless corridors

Corridors - narrow ways that lead to the island of alienation a sullen passage, an empty mind.
Corridors -Inside hospital walls, sterile school halls,
In the subway's neon light
Corridors - Where we hide the instruments of the fear, where doubt resides.
Corridors - Estrangement walks endless corridors:
