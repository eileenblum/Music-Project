Life seems to be
A monotone groove
You dance with specific steps
Into a pre-defined direction.

Every point we reach
Is a point of no return.
Life is a one-way-road
Into a pre-defined direction.

Life is perpetual motion
Some steps in little circles
Some choose the spiral line
New old game with higher stakes.

We follow the gallery of preset
Consuming pictures about the norm
By stepping forward we regress
Instead of living real progress.

[Lyrics: O. Holzwarth]
