New life dawns - the inception of another link in a profound process
Alteration and progress, nothing remains the same
Like a from from the egg to the tadpole to the final stage
Everything develops, learns, there's always reason almost rhyme! 

Like a spirit staircase that someday, somehow will end
Even the world's life cycle ends when progression's altered (synthetically) 

I stalked the blissful fields of springtime, I comprehend and I remind
And I will taste the bleary bleakness of autumn time, in due time I will find! 

Genesis, search, consumation - no living thing is extempted
Confined knowledge cannot understand - harmonious symbiosis! 

Life cycles - almost everywhere!
Life cycles - permanent progress!
Life cycles - a higher contrivance...
