Find pungent suppression where dictators corrupt and controlSubversive elements in their constant resistanceCivil liberty falls prey to fatuous dictatesFatal ideals, legislative power and executive authority!  Paramilitary troops are the government's armTo hush up the injustice, who's given them the right?Repressive affluence versus flinching povertyMalpractice, where the andes extent  Await the holy father and his blessings promisingTalking democracy and charityAll at once all rays of hope are dashed in Chile's stadiumsAnd resistance is foremost written in the eyes of a hungry peasant child!  South American junta in blood drenched uniforms, hiding theirArrested opponents in foresaken jails undergroundA regime interspersed with old and exiled S.S.Passing laws and restrictions in their insanity  Another illegal election, another ruthless purgeAnd another restrained voice dies away within four walls of blood!Another mother's tear shed for another missing sonAnother rifle leveled at another unremitting enemy!Resist!!!
