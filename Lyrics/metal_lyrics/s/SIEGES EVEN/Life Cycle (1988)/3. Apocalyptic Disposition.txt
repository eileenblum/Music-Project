Call to arms, call to arms, antiquated symbol of brutality
Join the forces, join the forces - learn your lesson in annihilation
Accept the peace, accept in unconcerned -maintainin' political philosophy
Contribute your best, contribute your best and follow the doctrine-conformity 

Sophisticated theories of strategy - accepting the war
Awaiting the nuclear blow - as Nostradamus has forseen! 

Brave criticism, rationality
Serve the doctrine of strength and force, apocalyptic disposition
Fatal attitude - leading us to death
The grand illusion - apocalyptic disposition
Accept this paradox, immortal attitude, phrasemongers leading us to hell
Don't mind your rotten spirit, don't mind your rotten spirit - keepin' the world war calculation
Guard the simple Catechism-Darwinism-1999, welcome and advancing
Macho attitude - those who want to see the earth as a big Arlington! 

Accumulate the overkill potential, a paranoid phobia
Built the nuclear time bomb - the conventional battle potential 

Brave criticism, rationality
Serve the doctrine of strength and force, apocalyptic disposition
Fatal attitude - leading us to death
The grand illusion - apocalyptic disposition
