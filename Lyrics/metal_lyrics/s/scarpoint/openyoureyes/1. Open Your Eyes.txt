[Jens Kidman (Meshuggah)]
Interpret my way to be
Alone I feel like no one cares
Tears keep falling, the walls are closing in
Dark institution of agony and pain

[Jimmie Strimmel (Dead by April)]
Narcissistic people around me
Makes me weaker don't you see
Another day, became the prey
Feeling insignificant if I where to fade

[Chorus:]
[Anette Olsen (Nightwish)]
[BjÃ¶rn Strid (Soilwork)]
I believed, I believed you were my friend.
Thought you were there for me,
Open your eyes and see me,
Yes it hurts, to always come far behind,
To always be last in line,
Open your eyes and see me

[Henrik Englund (Scarpoint)]
Living with an empty hollow soul
During my darkest day
You came and gave me a reason
A source of safety and persistence
But all this time you slandered me

[Zak Tell (Clawfinger)]
I've been used and abused
I've been bruised I've been beat
And still I refuse to give in to defeat
Instead I stand my ground and I try to stand tall
With a fist in my face and my back against the wall

[Chorus]

[Martin Westerstrand (Lillasyster)]
Regn allt detta regn som faller hela tiden
Rinner ner pÃ¥ huden mellan jackan och nacken
BlÃ¶tte ner min trÃ¶ja och gÃ¶r huden kall som frusen skit
Men inget kommer dÃ¶da mig nÃ¤r jag vÃ¤l har kommit hit
FÃ¶r nu Ã¤r jag hÃ¤r, jag stÃ¥r ju hÃ¤r rakt framfÃ¶r dig i mÃ¶rkret mellan bilarna
Och vÃ¤ntar pÃ¥ att du ska brÃ¤nna mig
Du kommer aldrig klara att plocka mig ur tiden
FÃ¶r det Ã¤r mitt regn som faller hela tiden

[Tom Englund (Evergrey)]
When everyday feels like a trial
I hide within my shell

[Peter TÃ¤gtgren (Hypocrisy, Pain)]
Blood flowing through my veins
Seeking a way out
Am I stuck in this hell
Forever, tell me you so called friend

[Chorus x2]
