[performed by Sadistic Intent]Now I rise, to destroy this world / Vengeance lies, my flames will make you burn
Millions scream, unanswered prayers are never heard
Eternal darkness, darkness sets as I watch the world burn

Now I laugh, your slow decay is what I wait / Poisoned air, your body will collapse
You will suffer, a violent death so painfully
Time to die, total disaster the entire place is gone

Eternal darkness

Terror, death, destruction / Nightmares from beyond
Destroyed generations / The world has been left to burn

Now it's better to be dead / Than to live this hell I've planned
Was this all meant for you? / Or your own hell you are going through?

Your scream in fright, as you end this life / You cry and pray, but now you're slayed
There is no escape, from your mortal fate / Dead bodies smell, as you burn in Hell

Eternal darkness
