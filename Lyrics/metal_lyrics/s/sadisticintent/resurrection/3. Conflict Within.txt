[music by R. Cortez Lyrics by E. Chavez]

Trapped inside a body
I know has been torn apart
My soul floats aimlessly
Afraid to go back to the start

Searching for that
Certain something
I know lies deep inside
I looked for truth
And found the lies
Without hope
Then why survive

[chorus x 2]
Conflict builds inside of me
Should I try will it help
Try agai nto fail once more
Left alone all by myself
Should I give it one more try
Set myself for the fall
Show my feelings to the world
Take a chance to risk it all

Trapped inside a body
I know has been torn apart
My soul floats aimlessly
Afraid to go back to the start

Searching for that
Certain something
I know lies deep inside
I looked for truth
And found the lies
Without hope
Then why survive

Is this the end?
Do I have a chance?
My mind is lost
Conflict within

[chorus x 2]
