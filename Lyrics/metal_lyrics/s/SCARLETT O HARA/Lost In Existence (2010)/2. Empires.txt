Take it from me,
I've given in.
You're sunk in regret.
You're sunk further in than out.
Take it from me.
I've given in with all your secrets spilled out on me,
Spilled out on me.
To all my friends, 
There are no loose ends,
To all my friends,
There are no loose ends.
That look is dripping proof,
So stick to you,
That look is dripping proof,
So stick to you,
Stick to you.
Destroyed by true love,
You're breaking me out of something I might never know.
So clean yourself off,
Get your ass up and help me out.
Sing it out loud for the memory
Keep in tough while locked with these eyes underneath.
We'll sink to the surface.
Quit living just to walk with the dead.
We'll sink to the surface.
With no place to run from here.
We'll fall right in.
We'll sink to the surface
That look is dripping proof,
So stick to you,
Stick to you.
That look is dripping proof,
So stick to you
Stick to you.
Destroyed by true love,
You're breaking me out of something I might never know.
So clean yourself off,
Get your ass up and help me out.
Sing it out loud for the memory
Keep in tough while locked with these eyes underneath.
There's no self control left in these veins to tie these hands
Tie them back together.
There's no self control left in these veins to tie these fucking hands.
