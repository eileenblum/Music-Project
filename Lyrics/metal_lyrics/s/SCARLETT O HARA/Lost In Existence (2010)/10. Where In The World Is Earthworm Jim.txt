I used to be a Southern Gent
Given up on self respect,
When your losing your dress

Did you think you could touch me,
Did you think you were something,

Don't stop, believe you were right
This time 
Don't stop, believe you were right
To save a life
This will be our downfall
This is who we are, when we've lost all composure
They will never face a liar,
Is this what it means to lead but follow
To cover it up, is this what it means
To cover your eyes, to stay alive

Did you think you could touch me,
Did you think you were something,

I'll know to erase the past,
I will carry you out alive

Existing,
To make up for time that we did not have,
I'll know just who we are when we've lost all composure,
I'll know to erase the past

I'll know to erase the past
So I can finally see
Were lost in existence,
We've lost all composure
I'll carry you out of here,
Why cant they see, we've lost who we used to be,
But I'll be fine
