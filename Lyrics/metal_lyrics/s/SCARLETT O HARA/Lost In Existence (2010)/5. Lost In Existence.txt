These lines they follow like the boys that surround you
Hanging on to heartbreaks in hotel rooms
Good things come to those who wait, so what are we waiting for?
Cause I'll bring you to your knees.

This is what you're waiting for
I can make this decision on my own if you please.
Break to your knees,
Where you belong, where you belong.
We're just waiting, waiting for,
Waiting for the right move,
Waiting for the right move.
Burn out, burn out all the light
We can give it up for a night
Burn out, burn out all the light
Patience for the sun to rise.

These lines they follow like the boys that surround you
Hanging on to heartbreaks in hotel rooms
Good things come to those who wait, so what are we waiting for.
Cause I'll bring you to your knees where you belong,
Where you belong.
Where you've been asking me to put you from the start.
Where you've been asking me to put you from the start.

When the windows start to shatter.
(To put you from the start)
I'll keep fighting on till the pain fills the air.
Pray for, pray for me 
I must, must be dreaming.
There's no room left for you
We'll stay carrying on.
Pray for, pray for me 
We lost ourselves.
(So far)
So far (So far)
So far in existence.

We can bleed the statue, 
Bleed hate.
We can drain the pain away
I've been staring out the broken glass
Waiting for you to come back home.
I'll stay fighting on.
In this hand an empty note
(I'll stay fighting on)
(I'll stay fighting on)
When the window starts to fade
I'll stay fighting on.
I'll stay carrying on for a second chance, another start.
I'll stay carrying on to breathe in deep, breathe in new life.

This is what you're waiting for
I can make this decision on my own if you please.
I'll break you to your knees, where you belong
Where you belong.
