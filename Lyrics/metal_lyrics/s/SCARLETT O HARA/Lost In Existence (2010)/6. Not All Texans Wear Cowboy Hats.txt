We'll mark the days we quit feeling for
We keep drinking all our pain to sleep.
No sound of chapters ripping pages away.
Page by page,
It's too late to make you see
I'll stop when your hearts done beating
You can take the spotlight
You can take it from me, take it from me.

You'll be knocking at my door
I'm afraid, I am drained more than ever before 
Your tears could fill the air
But I won't drink it, no I won't drink it.

So open up your eyes
Have you gone blind?
Blame yourself, it's not me we're searching for.

Bet your ass I'll be fine
You will see. 
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Set to flame a disappointed memory.
I'm fine (With every light)
I'm fine (With every light)
Set to flame a disappointed memory.

It's too late to make you understand that 
I won't stop until I get you alone.
Finally accept that I make a better ending for 
What you've been wanting this whole time.
You couldn't get enough of the spotlight.

Watch me, watch me steal the spotlight.
Run from under those pretty heels.
Watch me, watch me steal the spotlight.
Run from under the pretty heals.
Watch me, watch me rip you apart like nothing
Watch me, watch me take you apart like nothing
Like broken branches,you're slowly falling apart.
Like broken branches, you're slowly falling apart, 
Falling apart.
