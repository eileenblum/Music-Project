You'll break
Don't walk past the lines.
They'll keep tearing you, tearing you
Cut that smile from ear to ear.
Piece by piece,
You'll just come undone.

We can't see where your heart has gone.
Send me, send me 
Where we took the wrong turn.
Where have you been, where have you been?
What have you done?
Dear God, what have you done to me?

My hands are weak
I must be rewind.
I can't trust
We can't, we can't keep holding off.
We are so far away, so far away
From these gates with 
Your hands kept high in the air
I swear, I swear I will break through.

I think I'll do this better than before.
The past is behind me
When the fame and money came I let her know.
Go chase the city lights
In fear that you might not live to see tonight.
I think I'll do this better than before.
The past is behind me
When the fame and money came I let her know.
I think I'll do this better than before.
The past is behind me
When the fame and money came I let her know.

You won't, you won't
Carry on
I'm so far
So far from you, so far from you.
