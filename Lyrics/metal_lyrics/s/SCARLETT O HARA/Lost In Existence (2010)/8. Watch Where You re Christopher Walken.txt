Keep hating yourself for what we don't understand.
Keep searching here, searching there.
You're just searching for attention.

Keep running your mouth
I have nothing to say
All bets are are off
Keep feeding on
You'll stay feeding forever.

We are so far from you.
We are so far.
We've fallen out, fallen out
Find yourself another plan.
Steady breathing, mark your steps
Don't break so easily.
You can find yourself, find yourself
You can find yourself another way out.

We're falling short of something new
And will we be honest with ourselves?
Don't make intentions desperate
I'll never let go, let go of you.


We fall too fast
Don't save me, I couldn't see it coming.
We fall too fast
Don't save me, I couldn't see it coming.
Don't save me, don't save me.
We are, we are so tempted
We've grown so sick of walking.
We're falling way too fast.

We've fallen out, fallen out of you.
Now watch us bow down. 

We're falling short of something new and speed things up
To watch them slow down.
Help me, we are so god damn far.
Help me, we are so god damn far from you.
