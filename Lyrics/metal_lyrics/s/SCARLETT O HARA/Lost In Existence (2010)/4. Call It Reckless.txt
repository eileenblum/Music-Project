Killing time with all the lies
You're wasting your time
You're killing time with all the lies
You're waisting your

You're wasting my time,
Just stop.
Let's all gather for
And take this time to look for nothing at all.
You're so pretty in a body bag.
You're so pretty in a body bag.
Let's make this last.
I won't wait for you
I won't wait for you.

So here I am killing time with all the lies.
You said you would leave it up to me.
Stop, stop we're going too fast.
Take it down a notch
So we can breathe, so we can breathe.

Doctor, doctor.
Doctor, doctor can you please confess?
This masquerade is killing me.
This masquerade is killing me.

So here I am killing time with all the lies.
You said you would leave it up to me.
Stop, stop we're going too fast.
Take it down a notch
So we can breathe, so we can

Breathe, don't sleep.
You're safe in these walls, I can't dream another day
Another day, don't sleep.
You're safe in these walls, I can't dream another day
Another
You steal perfection waiting at the door, waiting at the door.
This slight misconception, waiting at the door, waiting at the door.

You're so pretty in a body bag.
You're so pretty in a body bag.
You're so pretty with those eyes on your head.
You're so pretty in a body bag.

I can't sleep, with these hands around my neck
I can't dream, in a bed of regret.
