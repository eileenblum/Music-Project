Chase me, chase me
I'll break into your name, into your name
Chase me, chase me
I'll break into your name, with another drink

Pour it all down
The bottles looking so empty

Is this what you had planned?
Is this what you had planned?

Fall, fall on my footsteps
Follow me

You'll be following when the beauty fades

Beauty fades with all the games you play
Judging by the fact that I must be crazy
To believe change would come so easily

Beauty fades with all the games you play
Judging by the fact that I must be crazy
To believe change would come so easily

I'll carve the fear on your face
For everyone to see
Your escape is breaking in
You'll see its me breaking free

I'll break into your name
How does it taste,
I'll break into your name
My name in your place
My words in your way

I'll break, I'll break into your name
How does it taste

Beauty fades with all the games you play
Judging by the fact that I must be crazy
To believe change would come so easily

Beauty fades with all the games you play
Judging by the fact that I must be crazy
To believe change would come so easily

I'd like to say something before I head back home
You'll be wanting me when you feel so all alone
I'd like to say something before I head back home
You'll be wanting me, you'll be wanting me

Locked with my eyes
Keep in place you'll be slower
Than I could ever fall behind
This symphony is so far from over
