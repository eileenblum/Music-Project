Can you see we're living with the mess we made
And take the shape of what's left of us.
Make it seem like nothing (Like nothing)
We're walking backwards, we're walking backwards 
Was what I was trying to say.

Can't you see we're living with the mess we made
Can't you see (Can't you see)
We're going, we're going nowhere.

Light faces up like the blackest night
We watched the sun, we watched the sun.
Light faces up like the blackest night.
We watched the skyline.

When was, when was the last time you felt alive?
When was, when was the last time you felt alive?
When was the last time you felt alive?

Why don't you know what this is all about?

I can see (I can see)
I can see through your intentions.
They're breaking free, breaking me.
Can you see my faith is out of reach of you?

Collapsed with crushed lungs that sold out too soon
And give the attention to someone less deserving of
Lungs that sold out to soon and give the attention to someone else.

Can't you see 
What this is about, this is about?
You can't reach
Why can't you see, why can't you see?
Why can't you see what this is about?
