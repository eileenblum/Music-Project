Who has the right to take away?
What we know is ours
Because we bled for it, we died for it, that's all
Who has an explanation?
Or at least some kind of clue
A line, a quote, a speech, an answer
Our beliefs got us killed and that we knew
Pity seems to speak our name
Bound forever in our misery
Despite it all
it s still an eternal blasphemy
Take the time to think it through
Will we really find something true
That goes to show we're worthless, useless
Derelict with no restraint
Take us out into the pit
Enticing is the pain
And yet we slave to follow shit
My rage personified
It s dominating, humiliating
Your method of torture
You have nothing on me
You have nothing on us
You have nothing on them
Now your loss is a must
Derelict with no restraint
Take us out into the pit
Enticing is the pain
And yet we slave to follow shit
I hate you
You hate me
we all fall for the same beliefs
My rage personified
it's dominating, humiliating
your method of torture
You have nothing on me
you have nothing on us
You have nothing on them
now your loss is a must
I feel nothing, no remorse
for your decomposing corpse
Take a glance at hopelessness
forget that you will ever have a chance
For all of these things
I'm not the least bit sorry
Because I've learned what was needed of me
