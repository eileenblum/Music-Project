Hundreds of eyes peering at those who will stand and fight
A means to despise
To cradle a fist at the brim of your jaw
Head on towards a fist
Struck down with one blow
They have you surrounded
Between heaven and hell
Lies a core underrated
Your blood stains on his crown
Your blood drips down his mouth
Suffer a fate worse than life
Never a fate worse than life
Go serve your god well
Be sure not to fail or be destined to fall
Your blood runs down his hands
Your blood drips down his pants
Suffer a fate worse than life
Never a fate worse than life
Shot through the sky
Tearing apart at the clouds in our way
A religious fight
A chance to discover who you really are
Be sure not to fail this time
Your blood won't buy you out
Your blood will strip you down
Suffer a fate worse than life
Never a fate worse than life
