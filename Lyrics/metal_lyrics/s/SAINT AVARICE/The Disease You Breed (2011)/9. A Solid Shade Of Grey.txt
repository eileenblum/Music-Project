Somewhere behind the black and white,
There lies a grey,
Just an unfortunate being,
Now watch that grey just shed away,
His innocence,
His past,
He can no longer regret this one change,
Somewhere here there's blasphemy,
A chain of events I do not recall,
Now as they call beyond these walls,
I separate and recreate,
A brand new life, it waits for me,
It welcomes my screams,
All that we hide,
the black and white,
Soon turns to grey,
To die for something worth fighting,
It haunts us all,
Those who don't believe
