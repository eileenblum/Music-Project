What the fuck is happening,
Just another night full of shit,
Close my eyes as tight as I can,
This disease keeps haunting me,
I can't seem to get a wink of rest,
Toss and turn myself from floor to bed,
Slowly slipping in and out of sleep again,
Insomniac, that's what the creatures call me,
It doesn't really help the cause,
Lights out, I toy around and keep turning them on,
How long is this supposed to last
A day, a week, a month, a year,
This night will pass and I ll be here,
Daylight has come and all is clear,
I lie awake in bed,
I can hear you in my head,
Still trying to reason the last thing that you said,
So what was it you meant when you said that this would end
This void you left is killing me,
Wide awake, I can hear the birds now screaming,
Their screams turn into laughter,
My hands cupped tightly around each ear,
Now I wait for what comes after,
End my life from a day, week, month, year,
Night, pass, I m here,
Light, come, all clear.
