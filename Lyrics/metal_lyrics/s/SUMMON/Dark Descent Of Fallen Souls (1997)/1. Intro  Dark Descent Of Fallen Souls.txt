Cold Freezing Moon Deadens The Sky
A Baphomet Of Steel, Our Swords Collide
In A spell Of darkness We Chant
We Enter Into The Eternal Oath

A Radiant Infernal Glow
I Feel Your Powers Enter My Soul
Shineth As A Flame In Mist
Unholy Powers Manifest

May We Bare The Eye Of The Beast
A Trail Of Chaos Has Guideth Me
Him Who Liveth Triumphantly
With No Beginning, End Cannot Be

Lurking In The Darkness Evil Waits
Feel The Rush Unholy Hordes Create
As We Chant To Oblivion
Spitting Forth Satanic Verses, Consumption Of Soul

We Chant In Blasphemy
And Proclaim our Infernal Names
Can The Wings Of Wind Hear Our Voice
As We Call Unto The Night

Arise!

Saith The First, Move Unto His Servants
Show Yourself In Power
And Make Us Strong Seers Of All
I Stir And Summon Up The Mighty Beast
That Liveth Forever, forever, forever
