This time must come now as written
Blackest of day it shall be
Eve of anti-creation
When all ways of holy have ceased

Moon, stars, sun and clouds collide
Creating unholy eclipse
For this time is now as is written
Heaven's temple quiet and dark.

Heaven in a veil of sleep
They are not pronouncing judgements
They are not deiciding decisions
Veiled is the night.

At once the sign is given
Winged demons attack
Destruction of god's holy heaven
As fire turns everything black

Angels in their helplessness
Are raped of their purity
Sodomy and lust now reign
Prepare to hail your new god

Dethroned of all power
Eve of anti-creation
Judge of truth, father of fatherless
Oh, ancient ones, the gods of night

Stench of blood and singed wings
Unholy paradise
Satan masturbates upon the throne of god.

Thy lord kneels before the goat
And licks the hooves of the horned one
Satan laughs at his fate at hand
As god begs for a merciful eternity!
