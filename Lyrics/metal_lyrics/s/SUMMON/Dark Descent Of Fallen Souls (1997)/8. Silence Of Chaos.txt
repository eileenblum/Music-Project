Soul descends the darkened depths
Of whirling winds poised with hate
Nothing mass engulfed in flames
Devour all to empty fate

Torment, pain
The silence of chaos

Pain from a thousand undead souls
Burn alone in funeral lay
Darkened winds bring waves of hate
Spiral endless into oblivion

Under the towers of storm
My dreams wait to awake
Filled frost, thick with fog
Covered by dust time...

The mighty throne growled
And five thunders flew to the east
Deathless ones who ride the whirlwinds
Bring forth torment and pain...
