Of these sins...
I had a vision
Of a mind in seven souls
Dreaming of things that could be true
Wondering through the darkness
For things I'll never see
Can you feel something looming there
Beyond the realms you've never seen
A boundless void
Of interstellar chaos
A mind was breeding their stars
Sorting though the pieces, can you make sense
Of what was and what's become
Can you feel the path of lostlessness
Of these sins I have become, I have become
Of these sins I have become, I have become
Seem so distant yet so near
Minds always anywhere but here
Where does inspiration come with loss of one's self
Of these sins I have become, I have become...
Of these sins I have become, I have become...
Wondering through the darkness
Of what was and what's become
Can you feel something looming there
Of these sins I have become, I have become
Of these sins I have become, I have become
