Wings of the darkest descent
Fall from the realm of dark
From the blackest fall of creation
Doomed by its end
Winds of chaos blow through my soul
Wings of the darkest descent shall fall
Lurking evil shadowed darkness
Far beyond the light of day
Blessed be the wings of chaos
Blowing through your soul
When evil consumes my creation
Wings of the darkest descent shall fall
Black descends on the wings of the crucified
Black descends on the wings of the crucified
Black descends on the wings of the crucified
Winds of chaos rip through my soul
Fall of doom shall grasp my withered soul, nothing remains
My voice shall speak in ancient tongues of old
Darkness bestowed
Black descends on the wings of the crucified
Black descends on the wings of the crucified
Winds unto the chaos blow through my souls
Chaos of the demon wings unfold
They unfold
