Thundering hooves trumpeting our attack
Like an avalanche of death we descend
Descend in soundless flight
Attack with burning plague
One by one they've all come to die
The blood red skies
Raging flames to banish the land of the weak
Crucify death to their holy priest
Death to the angels
As war commence, countless death
One by one they've all come to die
The blood red skies
Countless death, over kill
Blood shall fill the skies
Angels slain, one by one
They've all come to die, die...
Satan laughs aloud as angels fall to die
Feel the wrath of evil burning from inside
Angels slain, one by one
They've all come to die, die...
Diabolic winds of hate charging through
A storm of steel and these eyes have seen
Beyond the dawnless realms
Countless death, overkill
Blood shall fill the skies
Diabolic winds of hate charging through
A storm of steel and these eyes have seen
Beyond the dawnless realms
Fall to die before a blood red sky
