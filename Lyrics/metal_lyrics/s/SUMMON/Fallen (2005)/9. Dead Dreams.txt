Listening... to the silence of the night
Staring at the blind sounds
Engulfed by eternity
Thoughts do burn, cannot trust the day
Listen now to the years of the coming decay
This is of dead dreams...
And the corners of my mind
And the thoughts that have come, come to be
Writhing with mistrust
Blame yourself to blame
Wrapped within the fall of innocence
Cursed by eternity
Time's been born, without a thought to say
What will the shadows prophesize forthtold
This is of dead dreams...
And the corners of my mind
And the thoughts that have come, come to be
Tears stain the sanctity of sorrow
When the visions of rust command for more
Winded by disform, caught within a dream
For we are dead dreams, for we shall take blame...
To a shadowy grave, its remnants begin to rot in pain
Begin to rot in pain...
