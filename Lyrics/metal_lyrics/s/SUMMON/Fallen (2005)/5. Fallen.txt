Fall down to the wrath of sin
To void to the center of time
Little bits of thought since we left hope
It's my own demise
Whispered to the darkness within,
Everything's its own creation
Black sun sinking down within the shade we hide
Black sun rising within the shade we hide
Bow down to see what truth is without a sound
What more, come to mistrust
Abandon all your hopes to pain
Arise my urge to claim the flame
Only to abandon all and throw it away
One thought, through a cloud of pain
Everything's it's own creation
Black sun sinking down no more fucking liars
Born to burn the blames will baptize
Condemned upon the soul for I am blind eyes
Of the fallen, like the silence of the night of the fallen
Of the fallen, like the silence of the night of the fallen
Desecration evil ripping chaos through your mind
Desolation, mark my soul in sin
Abominate, for the barriers are inborn
Born to burn, born to burn the flowers with rust
Born to burn the flames will baptize
Condemned upon the soul for I am blind eyes
Unto the fullest I evoke my lie
Fallen, like the truth of night without a sound, fallen
Fallen, like the truth of night without a sound, fallen
Immolation, absolute decimation
Vindication, to it's selfless fool
Abominate, the barriers are inborn
Born to burn, born to burn the flowers with rust
