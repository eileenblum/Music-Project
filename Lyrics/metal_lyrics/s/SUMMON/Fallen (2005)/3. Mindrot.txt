Out of control, like a mind ready to burst
Thoughts race in and out of my head
Oh it makes me wonder, what a fucking relief to be
To make you feel the hatred in me...
Oh how it makes me wonder
What blackened skin they see
Living in dead minds ever to decay
Agonizing, writhing, seeping in worlds disbelief
Straining to break free, don't put your shit on me
Strange face, one should seem so frail
In the dead cold night, all the while
The earth sinks to it's grave
For once I was you thought
Calling for your mind again
Strange face, sinks to it's grave...
Hold your hand high, for the world will try
To beat it down, in a dead world of decaying minds
A world of decaying minds...
Oh how it makes me wonder
What blackened skin they
Cold poison taints my blood
Acclimation soon be done, anticipation bare
The moment all realized, all doubts are pure despair
