Lets go
Lurking in the underground
For what it seems like years
Played with a lot of shitty bands
And drank alot of beers
Drunken metal holocaust
We've come to destroy your town
Leave your town in ruins with our
Crushing metal sound

Loud, loud as hell, fast as fuck
Loud, loud as hell, fast as fuck

Fifteen bucks for shitty bands
You can go and kiss my ass
Talk to me with no response
I'm too fucked up on grass
Drunken metal holocaust
Will burn this to the ground
Leave you in the ruins with our
Crushing metal sound

Loud, loud as hell, fast as fuck
Loud, loud as hell, fast as fuck

Fuck you band!

Loud, loud as hell, fast as fuck
Loud, loud as hell, fast as fuck

Get fucked!
