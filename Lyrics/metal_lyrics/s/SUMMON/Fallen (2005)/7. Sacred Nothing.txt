This is your life and it's ending day by day
Too consumed to see it ever near, near...
Always on, but always off, your mind becomes a void
Devouring time to seek a path, a choice must be made
Without options to choose, now drained of ambition
Feeling born to lose, born to lose... sacred nothing...
Endless past of the lostlessness
Ever circling, endless maze
Leading to the center of nowhere
Too consumed to see it ever near, ever near
Ambition draining, are you born to lose?
Born to lose... sacred nothing...
Endless path of the lostlessness
Ever circling, endless maze
Nothing sacred, but all is real
Ambition drained now born to lose
Nothing is sacred, lost in a sea of madness
Endless path of the lostlessness
Ever circling, endless maze
Nothing sacred, but all is real
Ambition drained now born to lose
