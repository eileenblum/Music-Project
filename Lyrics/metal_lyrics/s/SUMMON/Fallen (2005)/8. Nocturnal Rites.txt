Nocturnal rites, this is the purging of the soul
An invocation of torment dreams
Nocturnal rites, the rite of darkness is bestowed
Unto the temples of the flames
This is purging rite of darkness is bestowed
To bless my creation in its throes
Nocturnal rites, within the flames to sit beside
To never realize your dormant fate
Nocturnal rites, unto the darkness we are bound
Within the throes of serving pain
I condemn your soul to burn
Words are profane, from tormented screams
Die for the deeds of your own
Ways of unholy thought
I am but a dream
Come and feel my grave
Nocturnal rites, came once the serpent kissed the soul
Unto the depths of tormented screams
Nocturnal rites, I found my darkness in its throes
When torment winds condemn my
Darkness... to my... throne...
