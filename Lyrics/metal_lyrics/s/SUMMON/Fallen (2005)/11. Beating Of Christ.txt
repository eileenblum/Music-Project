Repent, for thoughts that have been taught
Cower, behind your worthless god
Torture, now will be your end
Your cross, is your only friend
So it be, the Christ of lies
Bow down, for it is your time to die
Sons of bitches, whores of Christ
Watch your savior bleed
Tearing at thy gamy flesh
To watch the blood flow free
Repent, for thoughts that have been taught
Cower, behind your worthless god
Torture, now will b your end
Your cross, is your only friend
Judgment
Laid down by man
Judgment, as the nail goes through your hand
