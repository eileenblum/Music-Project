I will use the sign of fire
To invoke my hate and wrath
With my heart I bleed the thoughts
The thoughts of burning death
Baptized by fire,of burning death
Into my world ablaze,reborn in hate,of dancing fate
Enter a world of dancing flames for it's far too late
Hear its lickering chant as Satan grasps your soul
Inhale the burning stench of death and scorch this mortal coil
Baptized by fire,reborn in hte
Oh,what blackened hate,unworthy souls to burn
Oh,what blackened fate,of hellish winds return
Unworthy souls do burn,unto my world ablaze reborn by fire!
Welcome to thy kingdom,of ever burning fate
Your soul will writhe in anguish,in this burning pit of fate!
