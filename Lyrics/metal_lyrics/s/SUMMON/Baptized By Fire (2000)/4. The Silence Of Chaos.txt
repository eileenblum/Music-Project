Soul descend into darkened depths
Of whirling winds poised with hate
Nothing mass engulfed in flames
Devour all to empty fate...
Torment,pain,the silence of ...Chaos!
Pain from a thousand undead souls
Burn alone in funeral lay
Darkened winds bring waves of hate
Spiral endless into oblivion...
Under the towers of storm
My dreams wait to awake
Filled with frost thick with fog
Covered by dust and time
The mighty throne growled
And five thunders flew into the east
Deathless ones who ride the whirlwinds
Bring forth torment and pain
