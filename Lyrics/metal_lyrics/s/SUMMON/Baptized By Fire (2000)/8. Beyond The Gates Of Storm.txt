Bundst bid amongst the temples
Of shame and torment sins
Blind we walk with father winds
Of knowledge long ago...

From an age of wrath and might
Sin of torment reign
Blackest depths of northern souls
Wallow in it's grave
Dark supreme amongst you all
I question who is lord
Bring to me a sorrowed path
Of unholy ways to come...

In an age of might and sin
Torment shadows reign
From black depths may mighty be
The souls of warriors lost
Welcome to my world of woe
Where sorrow reigns supreme
Blinded by darkness shadows be
Forever lost in time...

Open your soul and release
Your mortal desires unto me
Bestowed upon an ancient throne
Longing to be set free to ride
Amongst bitter cold winds
To ride with the storm
Hear the echoing call
Of blackest fate to be...

Feel the power of the darkest lord
Writhing in the north
Above who's powers shallth be
The mightiest of them all
To reign supreme amongst the false
Crushed into sands of time
Lost in decades of fate
Destined to never return...

World shall suffer
Bonds shall break
To times of unknown fates
Of what lies beyond these gates
Only times will tell
Of what lies beyond these gates
Destined I am to dwell
Alone and cold with hopes of
Promised fate...
