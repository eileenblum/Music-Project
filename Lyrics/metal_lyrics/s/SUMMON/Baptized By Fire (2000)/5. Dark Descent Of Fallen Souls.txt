Storming towards the shadowed ruins
Grimly face the hill of might
Darkness casts a mass shadow
Chilling blackness steals the soul
Amodst the blind shadow bound hills
Dark descent of fallen souls
Freezing dark possess your soul
To fly amongst the raven winds
Circle above the stones of sin
Feel the darkness now begin
Amidst the blind shadow bound hills
Dark descent of fallen souls
Dark tomb of eternal stone
Many spirits have come to rest
With dreams of sad souls longing for relief when
Their dreams are lost will thyeternity be unveiled
And the soul fulfilled...
Dark descending winds,of the blackest fallen souls
