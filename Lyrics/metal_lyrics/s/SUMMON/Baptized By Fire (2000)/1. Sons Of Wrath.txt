It hes returned through the darkness of the night
Darkness of unkind
Doubting the spirit of unworldy design
But its mustic wears on
Through age and time
Consciousness is lost of the demonkind
Conquer the world with our RAGE!
A day awaits,Exit to return later on
Wasting all this time on mere existence
Exit to return later on
Blinding darkness,nocturnal is the wind
Feel the rage and fury burniing from within
I am not anyone who feels for your repent
Now you will burn,now you will hate!
You'll never know,all the darkness
Lurking in these souls,ooaacchh!
What of all these years wasted
Spent yearning for the past
Nothing more than never was ever shalt defy
I am not anyone who feels for your repent
Now you will burn,now you will feel our WRATH!
Nothing sacred,Nothing Pure
Here holiness is destroyed
Now our time has come,may we unite
With our art we are the sons of wrath!
Oh,it has returned
Doubting the mist that returns at night
Conquer the mist with...our...RAGE!
