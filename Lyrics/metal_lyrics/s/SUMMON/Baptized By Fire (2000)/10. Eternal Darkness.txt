Into eternal darkness,Let's go!
Lost within this realm,
Void of warmth and light
Eternity calls to the winds of old
Eternal is the night
Eternity is at hand,shadows steal your fate
Lost for day in endless night far beyong the gate
Mystic seems to grow
Through endless days and nights
Eternal are the realms of old
Void of warmth and light
See the flames afar glowing in the night
I sense the end but much to come
For eternal is the night
Dark are the voids,absent of light
See the flames afar glowing through the night
I sense the end but much to come
For eternal is the night!
