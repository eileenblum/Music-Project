Cursed is your soul
Bathed in tears you've wept
Watch your world turn to Hell

Destiny has passed
Beyond a shadowed realm
Unhallowed souls. Darkness is near

Haunted spirits from depths of cold deface the sacred shrine
In blasphemy vomit upon divine throne
For I am one of these calling curses on the seed
Waiting for the darkness to return

Fire hellbound
Woeful and displeased
Unhallowed souls, darkness is near

High as hell, shapes twists unknown
It's only thee unseen
The darkness has returned

Brutal, obscene, blasphemy
Spew forth upon the burning cross
Left is nothing when fires have  ceased
Ashes desecrate the ground

Unworthy ones of the weakest souls, where eternity is a lie
The blackness caused my silence
Nothing ustains for the evermore and coil longs to depart
The darkness caused my violence

The void consumed my senses, dealing with shadowed thoughts
Unravel the knot that makes all reason fail, death beyond the void
Agonized by thee accursed facts beyond the shadowed realm
Immortal time cares not about the dawn
