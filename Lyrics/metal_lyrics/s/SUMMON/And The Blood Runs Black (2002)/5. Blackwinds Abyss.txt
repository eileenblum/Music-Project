Rise from the abyss. Infernal source of power
Rise to greet the horns of fire, beard the grand old wise
Portal of faith you maintain, living in longing of almighty one
Who descended here with a crown of victory
Of shade and other shades who have dwelled
Living souls, Stand clear of those, for their souls have longed for death

About their eyes are red wheels aflame and a soul as cold as ice.
In strange tongues their evilwords, forlorn to the naked soul.
Beckoning them with eyes ablaze
Wicked souls. Give up your thoughts of heaven and its pure rebirth

Join us in an end into eternal dark
Into eternal fire and ice
Father Satan, sin my soul to Hell
Take me through the unholy gates
To ride the wings of darkness,
Blackwinds of Satan rise. HAIL SATAN!!
Whirlwinds burst up from tear-soaked ground
Erupting the wake of my senses,
And though I fall as though seized by sleep
If thou could only think.

For the god you save may be yourself.
Breaking the deep sleep which filled my head
As though by force with rested eyes I stood
Peering out to gaze where I was sensing the eternal emptiness

Descending into sightless zones no laments can be heard
Except for the signs that trembled the timeless air of shadowy sadness
Nothing before me eternal, yet eternal I remain
Bearing the dreams of angels long ago
I denounce your golden worship and spit upon your book of lies
No God shall come before me
Break all the jewels you can, deface my crowded throne
See beyond my gaze and throw me to the depths
For I have seen through fire and ice,
Loss of innocence, terror!
