Is this a dream, Dream of infinity
Looking through the eyes of death what do you feel?
He who stares but never sees inside the addled mind of deep thoughts
Thoughts to be

Lost in dreams of one thousand deeds done
Burden with fear, fear of fate
Fall to the depths of those weeping with desire
Cold hearts of pain, bleeding to bestow
Longong for an end

Fall to the depths of viewless thoughts and thoughtless views
Self-realization obsessed by death
Death stares but never sees, lost in debt of a thousand deeds
Always is, never was myself

In a moment all thought is lost
All senses run dry
