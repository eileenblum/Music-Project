Cold freezing moon deadens the sky
A Baphomet of steel, our swords collide
In a spell of darkness we chant
We enter into thee eternal oath

A radiant infernal glow
I feel your powers enter my soul
Shineth as a flame in mist
Unholy powers manifest

May we bare thee eye of the beast
A trail of chaos guideth me
Him who liveth triumphantly
With no beginning, end can't be

Lurking in the darkness, evil waits
Feel the rush unholy hordes create
As we chant into oblivion
Spitting forth satanic verses
Consumption of soul

We chant in blasphemy
And proclaim our infernal names
Can the wings of wind hear out voice
As we call into the night arise

Say the first, move unto his servants
Show yourself in power
And make us strong seers of all
I stir and summon up the mighty beast
That liveth forever, forever, forever
