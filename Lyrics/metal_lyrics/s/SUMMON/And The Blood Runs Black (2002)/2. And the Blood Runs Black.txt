By blood I bring you darkness
Black as death's embrace
Hear the thunderous call
Through the bloodstained sky

For every path toward certain doom
Fall to your destined fate
And the blood runs black

Abyssually distorted
Man-made delirium
But why have I wandered
Beyond the gates of time

Eternal shadows, never to refrain
Ominous soul with vengeancing might
Only seen for the hope of today...
Lost in eternal darkness breeding...

Oh, left is souls of nothing
Nothing left to dream
Conquer the flame to witness unknown
Past the realm of time and pain

Burned are words tempted by flame

Vengeance soul, ominous dark,
Lost within a realm of lost souls unseen
Fierce with hatred
And the blood runs black... [x3]
