Counting out the days
Awaiting solutions arise
Never seen the darkness
Growing in your eyes

Shadows of the never way
Stretched across my mind
Unborn fetuses speak in strange tongues
Longing for what is known
Pain of the never way
It doesn't matter, do what's said...

Tortured demon spreading out
It's never been the same
Starlit dream of desolation
Give me something to blame

Crush the wills of the skeptics
And praise the one who awaits thee beyond...

Gave you all. I don't know
It's hard to not know yourself
Bleed. My heart's descension
Raging towards burning flames

Truth covered security
We've made a pact to deal with whom?
No one cares if our feelings survive
Pain soaked heart straining to bleed
Be true. You know, for what is real?
The ambition of those is placed upon your heart
Liek a crown full of thorns.
Nailing you down, they drink from your wounds
Sustaining their own lives, nurturing soul
Find your home, where happiness can be found.
