Blasphemy chaos might shall desecrate my soul
Sins of profane deviation unfold
For I am one of these and the darkness I have seen
Hear thee inverted echoing screams

For I am one of desecration, eternal dark
Raging fires of hell shall guard our souls
Far beyond a shadowed realm, ancient gods arise
Violently descend into the maelstrom

Descend beyond the northern winds
Summoned from a silent grave
As one with eternal black
Blackened winds shall suffocate

Figures in the mist whisper untold doom
Patiently awaiting for the darkness to return
Faith in spiritual holocaust
Proclaim your allegiance to the dark

Shadows spinning fast
Begin the spiritual desecration
Removed from light of godly grace
All impurities shall be achieved
