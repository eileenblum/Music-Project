Intimidated minds
Full of fearful thoughts
Corrupted by a world stained in sin
Suppress your life, withdraw your hopes
Living corpses with sterile thoughts
Deny the urge you have borne within in hopes that eternity awaits
Will the love of God shine its grace on thee?
From weakness they are born
Devoted and mindless they follow
Promise me tomorrow so I can waste away today
For every corner a turn to temptation
Stuck in an age of mortality
Trapped in years of servitude
Turn off, you're a feed machine
Enforcing one's loss of self
This plague does not accept thy deeds of every man's evil within
If thou are so powerful
Then who is creator of he?
In solitude you hear your fears, are they your own?
On a process of controlling thee?
Sidetracked and mindless meanings
Nothing here can last
Nothing here can last
But somehow it manages to survive
Longing for another mind to divide
And their words mean nothing
Their lives reduced to the worship of a dead God man
For centuries man has fallen prey
Of hypocrisies, pureness false
Bereaved unto the shadows
They question the value of their own thoughts
Frustrate breeding hate
Bring me isolation to cleanse the mind and soul
No hope, no dead gods
No thoughts from the sky
