Tomorrow became yesterday
Another deed has passed
What to do with the nothing who
Swaying towards time
Finds nothing new is nothing more than time
Conscious lost, confusion born, apathy evolves
Like a sad moment of misery, where no one seems to care
But all wants to help, all I want is truth, all I want is lust
Help me you're my antidote to numb the pain inside
Starlit dreams of desolation as one we abide
Help me you're my fix to numb the pain inside
Repressed emotions, begotten stare
All beyond the away
So much in my head yet still nothing to say
Talking in circles we find the edge of nowhere
And bored by its void...
In time all heal, in time all will grow
[Repeat]
[Repeat first verse]
