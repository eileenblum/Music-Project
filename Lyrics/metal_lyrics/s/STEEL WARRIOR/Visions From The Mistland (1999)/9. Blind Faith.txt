[Music: Steel Warrior]

Running against the time, trying to find
Only a place that would give me the peace
Without this pain, without this tears
The evil
Years go by, fear to fight
Taking my soul to the land of the sin
I can't understand
There's no heaven
Pray and cry for human rights
See this people fighting for all gods
While your brothers fall and die
Forever

Let's go to heaven now and we will be
Happy forever
Let's go to heaven now and we will be
Happy together

Blind, blind faith
Blind followers
Open your mind, there's only one god
If you don't accept, maybe you'll be lost

Blood has made our history
Disasters and glory
Perturbed minds wasting time of their lives
Flying to the false salvation
Sanctuaries
Temples of gold, madness and war
Victims of fate falling down on their knees
Screaming loud to the sky
Divine intervention
Comes and bring the justice to the blind
He can't see that God cries
While your brothers fall and die

[CHORUS]

[Solo: Boon and Andre]

Fire and thunders in the sky,
Thanks to the Lord
Children will just kill and die
Glory to the Lord
'Cause my virgin heart tells me
that heaven is for sale
Now I live imprisoned
In this foolish faith

[Solo: Boon and Andre]

[CHORUS]
