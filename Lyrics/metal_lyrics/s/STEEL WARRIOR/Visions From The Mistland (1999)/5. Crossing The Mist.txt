[Music: Steel Warrior]

Nightmares carry me to the secret gates
Where I can see colors of another rainbow
Black rain, cold wind coming from the other side
Paradise is far from here

Slowly and quiet the ancient hold my hand
And guide me through the shadows of that land
Flowers don't survive, when he touches
This strange world makes part of me
Burning in my heart

Across the mist, I found the other half of me
That thousand years ago walked alone through the rising sun
Guardians in their horses take care of my soul
This dream never ends, It borns again when I'm

Crossing the mist into the night
Lost and lonely in another land
Crystal tears in the sand
I need a moment to forget
All that I see behind the mist
