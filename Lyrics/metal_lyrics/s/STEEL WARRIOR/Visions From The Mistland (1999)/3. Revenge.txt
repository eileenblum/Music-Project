[Music: Steel Warrior]

Riding down the mountains
Renegades from the holy lands
Dust clouds and the horses' breath
This is the sign

See the flames in their eyes
Destruction is the law
No mercy to the enemies
This damned kings of war

Pride, fire and freedom
Under my blood
Revenge now
Peace is over in this town

I am the fate with a sword in my hands
The man without dreams at night
Good times so far, living in the stars
Scars of a past in my heart

[Solo: Boon and Andre]

[CHORUS]
