[Music: Steel Warrior]

In the ancient ages and glorious times
When the kings and queens reigned with their pride
Among the hills, there was a man
Nobody knew his name
They just called him the Steel Warrior

Force to kill all the beasts
Infernal demons that were in his land
Grew in a battle field
Wizards and witches killed with his steel

Fire and destruction brings the glory to his tribe
Every man could see the fury in his eyes
Blood in the strength, one by one, enemies fall down
Thunder is the sign of warrior

Born to be eternal
Immortal Steel Warrior
Force, he was invincible
Lord of destruction, master of steel

[Solo: Boon]
