[Music: Steel Warrior]

Flying alone, thorns in my heart
Feeling the wind, youth by my side
Kissing the sky
In distant lands, in distant suns
Memories of fate will join our blood
Between the clouds and
Dark, rain, shadows, blind my sight now
Time, wind, distance, ride away
Higher, every day

Son of an eagle, prince of the sky
Son of an eagle, prince of the sky, high
Son of an eagle, prince of the sky
Son of an eagle, prince of the sky, high
Away

[Solo: Boon and Andre]
