A million brothers coming
to the steel crusade
They will arrive
Pure hearts are by our side
Ancient wisdom,
laws of truth will never fall
Always breaking the walls!

Thrones of gold
made to the metal gods
Are waiting for these kings
When the justice will be done
The victory of steel!

See the crowd pounding wild
True metal music will never die!

Demons and angels rule the night
Melting their souls with metal
Fighting to keep the flame alive
Feeling the strength:
The Power Metal!
