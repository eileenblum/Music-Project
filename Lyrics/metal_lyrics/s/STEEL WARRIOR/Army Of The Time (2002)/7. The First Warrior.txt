Ancient warrior your home is here
Your loyal sword always serving the king
Friend of the nomads, storms and winds
Words of wisdom are your legacy

Mountains of gold
never buy real pride
Come to the war, or die!
Honor are blades
slashing through evil blood
Fight like a man, or die!
Freedom to me has no price!

We are warriors of time and dimensions
And your wisdom revive us to fight
Always holding the flag of redemption
With the shine of the moon 'till we ride

[Solo: Boon]
[Solo: Andre]

Ancient warrior forgive our faults
My fight is your fight, your blood is my blood
We are stronger in the council of faith
Forever together, forever we stay!
