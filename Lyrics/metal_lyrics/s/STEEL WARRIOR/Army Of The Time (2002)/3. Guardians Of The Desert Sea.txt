Sailor, fast, put the sails on wind
Go ahead in your deadly course
Hurricanes don't throw fear on me
To cross the sea like a hunter wolf

Horizon or coast,
reflecting the light of lightnings
The mystical sea walled by the storm

Sailor fast punish waves strongly
Show to all the high dare's cost
I'm the only master of the sea
Your last chance to go back to shore

Horizon or coast,
reflecting the light of lightnings
The mystical sea walled by the storm
Load up the cannons,
show them a vision of hell
Spitting the fire, burning the night

The guardians of the desert sea
Violent curses always fight not flee
Hearts with these leather wings
Spreading fear to be free

[Solo: Boon]
[Solo: both]
