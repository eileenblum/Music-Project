The time is right to get our swords
And cross this kingdom
through valleys of mist
Give me the bless of stormy Gods
To go beyond this Twilight Hills

Powerful wizard, give me the force
(Strength to go on)
The crowning of fire is done!

Guardians of Mistland, I say goodbye
The iron horses are back on the wind
Hold on your tears, warriors never cry
Fire and thunder, farewell ride!

[Solo: Andre]
[Solo: both]

Powerful wizard gave me the sword
(Strength to go on)
The warriors someday will return!

Guardians of Mistland, I say goodbye
The iron horses will ride to eternity
Hold on your tears, warriors never cry
Fire and thunder, farewell ride!
