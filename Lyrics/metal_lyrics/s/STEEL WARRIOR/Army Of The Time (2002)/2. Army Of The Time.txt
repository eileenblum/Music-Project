Mist
Vanished with the wind
The thunder's sons, now I can see
Four iron horses right on my way
Bringing war to this distant place

Sorcerers will damn us for thousand years
And now choose your side
Holding the candles our sacrifice
Beyond the sea

Frozen eyes, faces of many years of
Stormy fights
Glories taken by the wind
Hold the strength on your sword
Feel the magic all around us
Pray to your Lord
All you need is courage

Join us, and search
for the Mistland Power
Feed on all your dreams
And I'm here now
To ride through the time
With the legion
of these brave souls
And fight for all
Army of the Time!

[Solo: AndrÃ©]
[Solo: both]
