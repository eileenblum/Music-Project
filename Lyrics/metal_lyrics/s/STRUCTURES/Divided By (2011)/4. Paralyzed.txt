How does it feel to be on the top of the
World? It's not like your stage is any
Higher, any louder. You're still only 10
Feet above flat ground. Hell, I don't
Want to but I'll give it to you. Every face
Down there wants you. Although, they'll
Turn at the drop of a dime. Like wild dogs
we're all waiting in line for you to fuck
Up hard enough, so we can push you aside.
We've learned there's more to music than
Sound. And if you're listening, I hope you
Know we built this up from the ground.
Every remark with heart. We're not
Saints, but at least we're not fake. And if
You're listening, then put your hands up
In the air and sing. We're not afraid to
Finally speak our minds. We're not afriad
And we're no longer blind. We're not
Afraid to leave your bullshit scene
Behind. We're not afraid, we're not
Afraid this time. Train wrecks develop so
Slowly, and in due time this life will fill
Your heart with hate. In due time, life will
Reject your advances. We'll attempt to
Put the world on its axis. We don't know
Who you are right now. Hey now, this
Ain't about you but everything relies on
First impressions. So when the most we
Know was just your shitty town and
Your shitty friends. To simplify it, you're
So irrelevant. I'll say you're not worth
Shit, although the worls a market for
It. I just hope they see the problem with
This. I'll bite my tongue, this system is
Corrupt. So we'll just shake it off, and
Continue being underdogs. you're all so
God damn easily impressed. We don't
Know who you are right now. Hey now,
This ain't about you but everything relies
On first impressions. So when the most we
Know was just your bad tattoos, trends,
And underdeveloped pen stains you
Scribble to shit friends. I'll say you're
Not worth shit. Although the worlds a
Market for it. I hope that they see the
Problem.
