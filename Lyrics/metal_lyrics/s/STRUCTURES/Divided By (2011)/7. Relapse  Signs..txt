[feat. Frankie Palmeri Of Emmure]When I awoke in a pool of sweat, Not a
Thought crossed my mind that I was
Reading the wrong signs. This all so
Meaningless to me, and as endless as it
Seems, I've been turning the other cheek
To the thoughts that left me feeling
Weak. Every time this happens to me, I find
More than good reason in speaking
Slowly. Yet I refuse to belive that the
Truth is a life. I'm at fault for the decisions
I have made. I'm falling asleep. I
Swear I've seen this a thousand times
before. It's like a metaphor that I can't
Ignore, anymore. This is the last time I
Remember crawling on my knees in desperation.
I'm falling asleep again. Why
Cant I wake up? Time to wake up. Pretend,
Everything's fine. Relapse, one more
Fucking time. The grass is greener on the other side. 
All the time spent backbeddling seems useless because 
You never really get back what you've lost,
But I've spent my life at the edge of the
Clouds. Obsessed with the sound, I'll never look down. 
Why can't I wake up? Time to wake up. Pretend, everything's
Fine. Relapse. Dear dreamer, did you ever
Think to cover your tracks? Keep light on
The footsteps. Cause if the shoe fits, well
The fucking shoe fits... come to peace with
It and you'll breathe sanity, it never
Seems to come easily to me. Dear dreamer,
It's not my fault your life's a fucking
Nightmare. It'll slip right through your
Hands. Dear dreamer, it's time you rub
Your eyes and look at your sad reality.
