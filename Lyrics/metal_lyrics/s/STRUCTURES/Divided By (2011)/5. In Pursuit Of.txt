To amount for the travelled skies, I'm
Seeing picture perfect lines. Now breathe
In the masses, a carrier in our feat of
Tired dreams. Gravity holds us to a
Standstill. Look for the better signes.
We're all in pursuit of this time. It's all
Laid out right in front of me, looking
Back into absence. And I'll stop running
From what never chases me, when you
Keep your hands where everyone can
See... what's become of this place we once
Loved? They said it was coming... Oh fuck,
This is just my luck. We're all paid the
Fucking price. They said it was coming, oh
My god, now here it comes. Tides never
Brought the change we all thought that
They would bring. Now set the sky
Aflame. So tell me, are you gonna make a
Decision that you'll regret years from
Now? we're all in pursuit of, when you
Keep your hands where everyone can see
What's become of this place we once
Loved. you can back into absence. So bite
Your fucking tongue, cause you're out of
Control this time. Now let me teach you a
Thing or two about life. We've all paid
The fucking price. What's become of this
Place we once loved? What has happened
To this place that we once loved? Now
Here it comes.
