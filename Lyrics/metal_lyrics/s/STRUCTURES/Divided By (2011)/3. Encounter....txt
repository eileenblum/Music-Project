Our lives are nothing but a means to an
End. And when the ground cracks
Beneath your feet, you will find the only
Thing that's left is peace of mind, or any
Other fucking kind. I've been wreciting this
With an imminet gaze, and no I don't
Know if you've got it in you but life will
Be the fucking death of me. This is all just
A repitition. To everyone, make it a
Mission to be the change you want to see.
Lay down the foundation and where you
Wish to be. I promise that it won't be the
Place you'll find me. Get ready for the
Calm, before the storm. Buried beneath
The walls, get ready for the calm I say.
Have you seen the things that we've been
Seeing? Our lives are nothing but a means
To an end. Have you seen what I've seen?
Get ready, buried beneath the walls.
Today resigns the peace through our
Decisions. this is a calling to arms. we
Cannot face our decisions in favour of
You. This is a calling to arms, we cannot
Face our decisions. Don't you think it's
Time to go home? You're always running
From it. This is what it feels to be torn,
But death will beat you to it. Don't you
Think it's time to go home? this is what it
Feels to be torn and this is how it is... I bet
You never saw this coming.
