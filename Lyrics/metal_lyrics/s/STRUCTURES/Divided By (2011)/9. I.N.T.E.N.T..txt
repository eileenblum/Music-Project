Latley, I've been focused so plainly on
The process of moving forward. How life
Was never easy. How we're alone
Through it just like how we're alone and
This time we spend retreating back to our
Heads. For the greater good we were
Broken down, if you only have a few
Words make them count. I know that it's
Hard to grasp, but I won't let go. We've
Learned our role in the earth's tilt, we
Try to find some meaning left in sound.
They say that home is where you make it,
But home's a sad story when you're
Always alone. I'm not your fucking
Shoulder to cry on. I'm not the one you
Fucking rely on. It's so sad you'll die
Alone. I can see how the past holds
Meaning but it's still out of reach and
That's a simple fact. Second guessing
Yourself has never come so easily. It's
Not worth it. Move forward this time. it's
Not worth it. Latley, I've found my lungs
To be heavy, stopping me from moving
Forward. They never said it was easy, I
Hear them now. It's like we're all alone in
This time we spend retreating  back to our
Heads. It's all useless if we can't make
You see some sort of meaning. This was
Always our intent. Can you hear us now?
This was always our intention. For the
Greater good we're all broken down, in
One way or another. (Can you hear us
now?) And to those who weren't... well
I'll wish you were. It's so hard yet so
Important not to live so securley. Loss
Finds nothing but meaning. Latley, I've
Been focused so plainly. Latley, it's hard
To keep believing but maybe we're not
Alone in it and maybe we weren't broken
down in the first place.
