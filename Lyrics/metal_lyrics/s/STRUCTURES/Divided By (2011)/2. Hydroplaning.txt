We are all inclinded to life a separate
Way of life. Some say it's our downfall
But there are reasons why, we tread on
Different sides. And some say it's our
Downfall, if we don't keep to the right.
Always keep gold in our sights. Looking
Further into such things, there is no
Balance worth letting go. We can tell
That you're trying to swing at something
You can't hit it. The wind won't blow you
Back on your feet, when you're stuck on
Repeat. So here I stand perfectly aligned
With the other side. We can tell that
You're trying to swing at something you
End. What the fuck's wrong with all the shit
That you've been force feeding down the
Throats of others? Underneath the
Fucking covers, thinking that we
Wouldn't know. Why do you try to live a
Worthless way of life? I've tried to
Explain to you a half a dozen times. I've
Lied to you kindly half the time.There is
No reason to let ourselves go, pushing
Forward just to stay afloat.Try to
Stay afloat. We can tell that you're
Trying to swing at something you can't
Hit.The wind won't blow you back on
Your feet. When you're stuck on repeat.
Some say it's our downfall, if we don't
Keep to the right. We can tell  you're
Trying to swing at something you can't
Hit and it's coming to a much needed end.
And we'll never follow you because the
Road signs point us in the right direction.
Our sights will never align.
