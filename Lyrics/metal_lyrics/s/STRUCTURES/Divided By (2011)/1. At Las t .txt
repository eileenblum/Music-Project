And if you thought it was over then you better think twice
You've been given your last chance
Now face the fucking avalanche

And who the fuck are you to say that we're just wasting time?
There's no need to look back as we approach the finish line
Can't stand side by side, if you can't face the fucking avalanche
We're standing on top at last

At last
You'll have to face the fucking avalanche

Standing at the top of the world
At last
Looking down from the top of the world
At last
We feel alive
