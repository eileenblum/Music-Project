Looking down from the top of the world
It's inescapable to miss the fact that (fact that)
That we are all a whole and yet we feel so alone
(That we are all a whole and yet we feel so alone)

Pull these words from my throat
Or I'll surely choke on my own notes
Pull these words from my throat
As I stare at life through a window

Our persistence is insignificant on our own
But what would we do without it?
We focus inwards, dwell and sink deeper
While the picture gets bigger and bigger
There's so much more left in me
But all I seem to see
Is how the world tears at me (at me)

Life may seem cursed but there's always, always worse
And we are all but a fly to the universe

Pull these words from my throat
Or I'll surely choke on my own notes
Pull these words from my throat
As I stare at life through a window
As I stare (as I stare)
Our eyes stare at life through a window

We take advantage of the skies that float above
Until we see the world from a different perspective

Better perspectives are greeted with lessons of easing the stress
Giving rest to the restless

Ignorance is only bliss
If you don't give a shit about it

Ignorance is only bliss if you don't give a shit about it
Throw your fucking hands up and shout it!
Doubt it!
If you think you're right then think about it!
Throw your motherfucking hands up and shout it!

There's so much more to me
But all I seem to see is how the world tears at me

Our persistence is insignificant on our own
But what would we do without it?
We focus inwards, dwell and sink deeper
While the picture gets bigger and bigger

Pull these words from my throat
Or I'll surely choke on my own notes
Pull these words from my throat
As I stare at life through a window
Pull these words from my throat
Or I'll surely choke on my own notes
Pull these words from my throat
As I stare at life through a window

We take advantage of the earth below and the skies above
There's so much more left in me
But all I seem to see
Is how the world tears at me (at me)
