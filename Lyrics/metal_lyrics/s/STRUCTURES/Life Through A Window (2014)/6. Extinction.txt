There's a hole in the centre of Earth,
Where the rest of the world sinks, but I stand still
I never wanted to make a decision
We live like fish in a salt water prison
Hey! Hey!
When the iron sinks I will swim instead

Why are you waiting for the sky to have its fun?
The clouds don't always block the sun
Don't wait for the world to slip away
Don't wait for the world to slip away

I've been standing on top of a thought that exists
Withholding the pain till it's sent to my wrist
As every day grows older, another weight adds to my shoulders
Hey! Hey!
When the iron sinks I will swim instead
Hey! Hey!
Take another look inside your head
So who's the one with the mask on?
Cover your face at the thought of rejection
You, you are the one with the mask on
Find your fate before it's too late

Why are you waiting for the sky to have its fun?
The clouds don't always block the sun
Don't wait for the world to slip away (to slip away)
And now I'm staring at the clouds
Let the rain pour down and soak this stable ground
As long as life allows, I'll continue not to make a sound
Get off your feet and fucking move!
So who's the one with the mask on?
Cover your face at the thought of rejection
You, you are the one with the mask on
Find your fate before it's too late
Find your fate before it's too late
Get off your feet and fucking move
