Let's hear it for regret
It sticks on my mind like a secret, and it's caused so much pain
So let me explain why I've been drinking my conscience under the table
Swimming with scapegoats, I'm clearly unstable
There's nothing for me
So I will carry
The weight of all my past mistakes
Until I'm blue in the fucking face

It started storming when I left the heart that I was warming
It never just rains, it's always pouring

So listen up, I've too much pride to lay down and die
But I never got a chance to say goodbye
Let's hear it for regret
It sticks on my mind like a secret, and it's caused so much pain
So let me explain why I've been drinking my conscience under the table
I'm clearly unstable

Carry the weight (the weight) of your past mistakes
Until you're blue in the face from every step that you take

Tear me apart
This guilt is so frustrating
Tear me apart
Rewind to the start and...
Tear me apart
I wish I could say goodbye

I never got a chance to say goodbye
So when you feel like you've been losing in the long run
I'll be standing right beside you with a shotgun
Boom!

I will never come to terms with leaving
So take me home

I've got too much pride to lay down and die
We've been failing, every breath that we take
We've been failing, every step that we take

Tear me apart
This guilt is so frustrating
Tear me apart
Rewind to the start and...
Tear me apart
I wish I could say goodbye

Pray for the shores
The tides are changing
The waters are raising too high for my head to keep above
The difference was I still made it out

My conscience has some questions to ask (so call back)
They've been piling since the day that you left (so come back)
I've got a couple questions to ask
But there's no one (no one) to answer me back
I've got a couple questions to ask ( so come back)
My conscience has some questions to ask (so call back)
