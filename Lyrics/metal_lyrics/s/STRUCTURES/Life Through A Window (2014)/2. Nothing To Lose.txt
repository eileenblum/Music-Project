What did you expect?
No one can fix this
You gave up and now you're saying that it's worthless?
You can't speak (can't speak), you can't breathe
when you're living like you're six feet deep (motherfucker)
Oh, do something better with yourself
Stop placing your worries on top of a shelf
Take a good hard look in the mirror for help

Plan action that gives satisfaction
The rest is just a fraction and hate's an attachment to the world
Don't fear these words are just a form of advice
"Don't find a vice you fear"
You can't speak (can't speak), can't breathe
When you're living like you're six feet deep (six feet deep)
You did this to yourself so wake up

Get up, get up, get up
If there's nothing to lose
Then you've lost everything that meant something to you
Fall through this weightless mood
And pick yourself up like there's something to prove
Get up, you've got something to prove
Get up, you've got something to prove

No one can fix this
No one can change your life but you

You did this to yourself so get the fuck up
You've been asleep for far too long, so wake up

Get up, get up, get up
If there's nothing to lose
Then you've lost everything that meant something to you
Fall through the weightless mood
And pick yourself up like there's something to prove
Get up, you've got something to prove
Get up, you've got something to prove

Breathe, breathe
I can't breathe the air that you breathe
I can't breathe the air that you breathe
Breathe, breathe
You can't breathe when you're six feet deep
I can't breathe the air that you breathe
You can't breathe when you're six feet deep

What did you expect?
No one can fix this
You gave up and now you're saying that it's worthless?
You can't speak, you can't breathe
When you're living like you're six feet deep (motherfucker)
Oh no, quit living like you're six feet deep (six feet deep)
Oh no, quit living like you're six feet deep (motherfucker)

(Breathe, breathe)
Tell me that you're worthless
(Breathe, breathe)
Tell me that you're worthless
You've been asleep for far too long
And we wrote this song so you could sing along
You are more than just the hole you came from
Breathe, breathe
I can't breathe the air that you breathe
Breathe, breathe
You can't breathe when you're six feet deep, yeah
Breathe, breathe
I can't breathe the air that you breathe
Breathe, breathe
You can't breathe when you're six feet, motherfucker
I can't breathe the air that you breathe
Breathe, breathe
You can't breathe when you're six feet deep
