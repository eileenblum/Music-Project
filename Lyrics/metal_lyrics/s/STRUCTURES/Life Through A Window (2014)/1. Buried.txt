We're all the same
We bury the stains that remain on the clothing of yesterday
What can I say?
The steps that you traced led astray
We covered our tracks, to never find our way back
Don't try to force it
Don't try to force it in
Fuck this place
And fuck the entire human race
For setting lines that you can't cross or replace
So fuck this place
Oh, and fuck the entire human race
Create your own reign or be cast into space
The secret of happiness is still at your fingertips
And it's all in how you move in the dark-lit room that you came from
The structures don't change for anyone
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

(Fuck this) Fuck this place
And fuck the entire human race
For setting lines that you can't cross or replace
So fuck this place
Oh, and fuck the entire human race
Create your own reign or be cast into space

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
