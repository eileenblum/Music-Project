So here's the thick of it, I walked right into this
Hands up with no witness (witness)
I stood willing to make you fit and I swear you did
I tried doing my best to squeeze this heart from my chest
And now we're stuck with the rest of this distance, in every instance

It's time to reap what you have sewn
Because you know, you know you're growing old
(Get real, you're growing cold)

No one wants to die alone
I'm bitter at my best, as hopeless as it gets
Dilute your stress with the bullshit
Rethink everything
From what you need I know you don't need anything
From what you mean I know you don't mean anything
From what you see to what you...
Don't make me go home alone
No you don't see, you don't see anything

I wish, I wish my fucking absence wasn't the death of all my passion
Reaction: I can't help but feel distracted
You're growing old
You're growing cold
Rethink everything
From what you need I know you don't need anything
From what you mean I know you don't mean anything
From what you see to what you...
Don't make me go home alone

All my love will swallow me
And all my hate will be the death of me
All my love will swallow me
And all my hate will be the death, the death of me

Don't make me go home,
Don't make me go home,
Don't make me go home,
Don't make me go home alone
I wish my absence wasn't the death of my passion
I can't help but feel distracted
It's time to reap what you have sewn
Because you know, you're growing old
It's time to reap what you have sewn
You're ice cold, and no one wants to die alone (die alone)
No one wants to die alone
Go alone!

Don't make me go home,
Don't make me go home,
Don't make me go home,
Don't make me go home alone...
