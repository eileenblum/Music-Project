[feat. Drew York of Stray from the Path]It's the beginning and it's never ending
And I will mask myself as the solution to all life's mess
I've left you living in a world where you depend on me
I recommend you leave (peace)
And now I think it's time, time that you let go (let go)
Tired of living in a world where reception is low
Don't know your own bones (own bones)
After years of being trapped in your headphones

How does it feel to be alone?
Living in world that you don't even know
It's in the palm of your hands
Do you feel numb?
It's in the palm of your hands, so listen up

And now I think it's time, time that you let go (let go)
Tired of living in a world where reception is low
Don't know your own bones (own bones)
After years of being trapped in your headphones
Are you so blind you can't see anything at all?

Except the screen you've burned into the back of, the back of your skull
Do you feel numb to the touch?
It's an electric emotion that separates heart from the thumb
And heart from the lung (from the lung)
On the list of addictions it's still number one

We're a step back from evolution
But when life hands you lemons you make do
Four thousand years of living in fear but nothing held us back here
These open arms were built by satellite hands
But there's a hole inside this man
I hope you understand that the worst of both worlds is dependent on robotic arms

Are you so afraid of the dark, you sleep with one eye open?
Never to part ways with airwaves
Are you so inclined with your heart, you would give up the whole world?
Start over again
Start over and over again

It's the beginning and it's never ending
And I will mask myself as the solution to all life's mess
I've left you living in a world where you depend on me
I recommend you leave (peace)
And now I think it's time, time that you let go (let go)
Tired of living in a world where reception is low
Don't know your own bones (own bones)
After years of being trapped in your headphones

It's time, time that you let go (let go)
Tired of living in a world were reception is low
Don't know your own bones (own bones)
After years of being trapped in your headphones

Are you so afraid of the dark, you sleep with one eye open?
Never to part ways with airwaves
Are you so inclined with your heart, you would give up the whole world?
Start over again
Start over and over again
