Gone with the wind, you came unseen and left, unheard (unheard)
Deception hides in the face of the breed you created
The mess that you made will surely be swept off your feet and underneath
The carpet of our eyes
But enough is enough, with your lies

Because I'm young and I'm pissed off at the way you let the world run
Paid my prescription and then I hear that you gave it away
To someone who is truly not in need
I'll bite off the hand that feeds us shit

The mouth of the greedy and innocent would both go hand in hand
But one hand is missing, and the other one's kissing the asses of Americans

"Land of the free"
And home of the liars, deceit and Jesus Christ
I thought I heard you crying in the night
'Cause no one buys that shit you disguise as gold
The lies you told are growing thin with the world
They all sound the same
You promised a change
So clean up the mess that you've made

I will never see eye to eye with you
('cause all that you know is a lie)
I will always see eye to eye with you (with you)

You should call yourself a liar
'Cause all that you know are the fables you're fed

I will never see eye to eye with you
('cause all that you know is a lie)
I will always see eye to eye with you (with you)

Save your sorry breath
We're books on a shelf
Coated in wealth
The letters we're filled with are dressed in shit
Paper in plastic wrap
All we are is paper in plastic, on a shelf
Wrapped in golden lies

You came unseen and left, unheard
Deception hides in the face of the breed you created
The mess that you made will surely be swept off your feet and underneath
The carpet of our eyes
But enough is enough, with your lies

All you know is a broken t-t-t-telephone
All you know is a broken t-t-t-telephone
